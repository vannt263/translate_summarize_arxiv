    "interacting bosons in one - dimensional ( 1d ) or quasi-1d lattices are of interest in many physical contexts , ranging from josephson - junction arrays  @xcite to more recent experiments on ultracold bosons loaded in 1d optical traps .",
    "@xcite especially the latter ones offer the unique opportunity to fine tune the experimental parameters and realize in laboratory a wide variety of bosonic models where kinetic energy , inter - particle interaction and disorder can be varied at will .",
    "in particular , it is possible to tune interaction to such an extend that atoms essentially behave as hard - core bosons confined along 1d tubes with  @xcite and without  @xcite a superimposed optical lattice . in this condition",
    ", the huge repulsion prevents bosons from occupying the same position in space and induces a sort of pauli exclusion principle .",
    "it is well known that hard - core bosons can be mapped onto spin - less fermions by the so - called jordan - wigner transformation .",
    "@xcite however , since the jordan - wigner fermions are non local in terms of the original bosonic operators , the local bosonic hamiltonian is transformed into a very complicated non - local interacting fermion model .",
    "this approach simplifies in 1d tight - binding models with only nearest - neighbor hopping : here , non - locality is absent and the bosonic model maps onto non - interacting fermions , easily solvable .",
    "whenever the lattice is not rigorously 1d , i.e. , when more chains are coupled together or longer - range hoppings are considered , the corresponding fermionic problem contains complicated interaction terms that may become highly non - local when the number of chains increases .",
    "the difference between hard - core bosons and spin - less fermions is even more pronounced in the presence of disorder .",
    "indeed , non - interacting spin - less fermions in a quasi-1d system are always anderson localized for any disorder strength . on the contrary , hard - core bosons can become superfluid in the presence of disorder as soon as they can exchange among each other , a property that occurs already in the simplest case of a two - leg ladder .",
    "@xcite from this point of view , ladders of hard - core bosons represent an ideal case study to uncover the role of bose statistics versus fermi statistics in the presence of disorder .    from the purely theoretical side",
    ", we think this is an interesting issue .",
    "single - particle wave functions are always localized in a quasi-1d disordered lattice .",
    "it follows that any slater determinant built with such wave functions is localized too , so any many - body wave function for non - interacting fermions . on the contrary , hard - core bosons ,",
    "which like spin - less fermions can not occupy the same site but whose wave function is symmetric under exchanging two particles , can cooperatively act and give rise to a delocalized superfluid phase .    also from the experimental side ladder systems",
    "are of interest , as they can be realized with optical lattices .",
    "@xcite in realistic experimental setups , a two - leg ladder can be realized through a double - well potential along a direction ( say , @xmath3 ) like in ref .  , and a potential creating a cigar geometry in the @xmath4-axis .",
    "further superimposing a periodic potential along @xmath4 , one could finally realize a two - leg bose - hubbard model with tunable hopping rates among and between the legs .",
    "disorder can be introduced by superimposing a disordering lattice or introducing a speckle potential .",
    "we further mention that bosonic ladder systems are realized also in magnetic materials .",
    "@xcite for example , the disorder - free compound ipa - cucl@xmath5 has been found to be a prototypical @xmath6 antiferromagnetic spin ladder material , which can be thought as a system of interacting hard - core bosons .",
    "@xcite here disorder is introduced by means of random chemical substitution , i.e. , ipa - cu(cl@xmath7br@xmath8)@xmath5 .",
    "neutron scattering experiments have shown convincing evidences of the spin - analogous of a bose - glass .",
    "@xcite    given its both theoretical and experimental interest , we decided to study the phase diagram of a simple model of hard - core bosons hopping on a two - leg ladder with bounded on - site disorder by means of green s function monte carlo .",
    "@xcite in short , we find that the phase diagram as function of the density and the ratio between inter- and intra - chain hopping includes three phases : a localized bose - glass , a superfluid and , at half - filling , a so - called rung - mott insulator that seems to be always surrounded by the glass .",

    "the matrix elements @xmath0 and @xmath1 are the hopping amplitudes along legs and rungs , respectively .",

    "before considering the disordered case , it is useful to briefly discuss the clean system , where @xmath30 ( see also appendix ) .",
    "first , we consider the limit @xmath31 , i.e. , two uncoupled chains .",
    "in this situation , the ground state is a superfluid with quasi - long - range order for any density @xmath32 . at densities @xmath33 and @xmath34",
    ", there is a ( trivial ) `` frozen '' mott insulator due to the infinite on - site repulsion , which completely suppresses charge fluctuations .",
    "let us now analyze the the opposite limit @xmath35 . exactly at half filling ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath36 , there is one boson per rung and the wave function can be approximately written as a independent product of single - particle rung states as @xmath37 the system is in the so - called rung - mott insulator with a unique ground state and a gap to all excitations .",
    "@xcite at half filling , the transition between the rung - mott insulator and the superfluid takes place exactly at @xmath31 , since the inter - chain hopping represents a relevant perturbation that immediately opens a gap in the excitation spectrum , see appendix .",
    "this transition is of the berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless type , which makes it difficult to observe by numerical simulations on finite clusters .",
    "@xcite    now , if few bosons are added or removed to the insulating state , a superfluid is stabilized .",
    "therefore , at any other filling @xmath38 and @xmath39 the system will be always superfluid , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : stiffclean ] where the superfluid stiffness as function of the density of particles @xmath27 is shown for fixed @xmath28 .",
    "the superfluid stiffness starts to grow at low density , it reaches a maximum , and finally vanishes at @xmath36 at the rung - mott insulator .",
    "we conclude this section by mentioning that , for spin - less fermions at half filling , there is a transition from a metallic to a band insulator at @xmath28 , where a gap opens up .",
    "for all the other densities @xmath40 and @xmath34 , the ground state is metallic .",

    "the density has been fixed to @xmath44 . ]",
    "now we turn to the disordered case .",
    "let us start by the low - density regime of the phase diagram at fixed inter - chain hopping as function of the density and disorder . in fig .",
    "[ fig : hcb ] , we report our results of the superfluid stiffness as a function of disorder strength ( for @xmath43 ) and density ( for @xmath28 ) ; the low - density phase diagram is reported as well .",
    "we find that , for any finite disorder @xmath42 , the low - density phase is a bose glass that turns superfluid above a critical density .",
    "the trivial mott insulator with zero ( or one ) bosons per site is therefore always separated from the superfluid by the bose - glass phase .",
    "this is a remarkable result since , in a single chain with nearest - neighbor hopping only , hard - core bosons are equivalent to spin - less fermions , which anderson localize for any density .",
    "hence , in a two - leg ladder , hard - core bosons behave differently from spin - less fermions ; while the latter ones remain always localized , the former ones show a superfluid phase stabilized by the inter - chain hopping , as it was predicted using bosonization and renormalization - group techniques .",
    "@xcite the idea is that , in a strictly 1d geometry with only nearest - neighbor hopping , the statistics of the particles does not matter .",
    "however , whenever particles may be interchanged ( by non - strictly 1d paths ) bosons can form a superfluid , even in presence of disorder .",
    "we just mention that the same behavior holds also on a single chain with longer - range hopping .",
    "this scenario can be understood in very simple terms as follows . at very low fillings",
    ", the statistics of the particles does not matter so much and hard - core bosons , as free fermions , localize due to disorder , giving rise to the bose glass .",
    "this is because the length over which the single - particle wave function extends is short enough that the wave functions of two particles never overlap .",
    "as soon as the filling is increased , the particles get closer to each other and the single - particle wave functions begin to overlap . at this point",
    "the statistics of the particles starts to play a role . if the particles are fermions they will still be localized ( in @xmath45 ) , whereas bosons may stabilize a superfluid , as confirmed by our numerical simulations .    in the range of values of inter - chain hopping that we have studied",
    ", the effect of a larger @xmath2 in the low - density phase diagram is to slightly reduce the superfluid response of the system , as can be also seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : hcb ] .",
    "although the actual thermodynamic value of the transition between the bose glass and the superfluid may be rather different from the one obtained by our calculations , because of strong size effects , the present results give a qualitative correct insight into the phase diagram .",
    "finally , we would like to mention that the exact behavior of the transition line between bose glass and superfluid phases @xmath46 is hard to be found by numerical calculations .",
    "although an almost linear fit is found , i.e. , @xmath47 , a different power - law can not be excluded , as implied by the arguments of ref .  .      here",
    ", we want to investigate the effect of the coupling @xmath1 on the otherwise insulating ( anderson localized ) decoupled chains . generally speaking , for any value of disorder",
    ", a certain finite ratio @xmath2 is necessary to drive the system into a superfluid phase , hence the system remains in the bose - glass phase for small @xmath2 .",
    "however , for small disorder , the localization length of the bose glass is expected to be very large .",
    "this means that on clusters that are accessible to numerical simulations it may be very hard to see the bose glass region .",
    "this fact is indeed confirmed by our results on the superfluid stiffness as a function of the inter - chain hopping , see fig .",
    "[ fig : smalltp ] .",
    "rapidly , as a small @xmath2 is introduced , a large superfluid response is found for small disorder ( e.g. , @xmath48 and @xmath49 in the figure ) .",
    "it is also observed that , by a further increase of the inter - chain hopping the superfluid stiffness reaches a maximum and then eventually decays , since for @xmath50 the system decouples in a collection of decoupled rungs ( which are obviously not superfluid ) .",
    "moreover , as the disorder is increased , the superfluid response is suppressed , until the system can not attain superfluidity any longer and remains localized for any value of @xmath1 .",
    "( color on - line ) distribution @xmath51 of the gap as function of disorder strength and fixed density @xmath36 and @xmath28 on a two - leg ladder with @xmath29 sites .",
    "the clean gap is shown for comparison in the upper - left box as a blue bar . ]",
    "the effect of disorder on the rung - mott phase at density @xmath36 system is now discussed . from general grounds",
    ", it is expected that the presence of disorder will fill the gap with localized states , so to induce a transition to a gapless bose - glass phase . in practice ,",
    "given a ratio @xmath2 , the rung - mott insulator will survive up to a certain critical value of @xmath42 , where the gap will be completely filled and the system will become compressible . this situation is similar to the one of the bose - hubbard model at integer fillings  @xcite , where a direct transition between the mott insulator and the bose - glass phase is expected by decreasing the ratio between the on - site repulsion @xmath52 and the disorder strength @xmath53 .",
    "@xcite also in our case of hard - core bosons , we can make use of the argument based on the fact that , if @xmath53 is larger than half of the energy gap of the clean insulator @xmath54 , then the ground state must be compressible ; otherwise the system is incompressible with a reduced gap given by @xmath55 .",
    "in particular , for @xmath35 we have that @xmath56 .",
    "therefore , the gap will vanish around a critical value of disorder @xmath57 .",
    "these arguments should hold exactly only in the infinite system and large size effects are expected because this transition is of the griffiths type , i.e. , driven by exponentially rare regions which are locally ordered .",
    "@xcite on the other hand , on any finite system the transition from the gapped to the compressible phase will appear at a larger @xmath58 , since these exponentially rare configurations will be hardly sampled on finite clusters .",
    "we recently proposed  @xcite a method to alleviate the strong size effects that consists of computing directly the distribution probability of the gap @xmath59 where @xmath60 ( @xmath61 being the ground - state energy with @xmath19 particles on the realization @xmath62 of disorder ) .",
    "this definition of the gap distribution is introduced because in disordered systems the gap can be overcome by transferring particles between two rare regions with almost flat disorder shifting the local chemical potential upward and downward .",
    "these exponentially rare regions may be far apart in space and represent rare fluctuations ( lifshitz s tail regions ) , thus it is useful to imagine that a large system is made by several subsystems , each represented by a different disorder realization of our @xmath20-site cluster , and construct the gap by using the process of taking one particle from region @xmath62 to region @xmath63 .",
    "@xcite if such processes are allowed at no energy cost , i.e. , @xmath64 , the corresponding system will be gapless .",
    "one could define an alternative estimate of the gap as @xmath65 with all the disorder realizations @xmath62 and @xmath63 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : distribs ] , we show the distribution probability at half filling as function of disorder , @xmath28 and @xmath29 . for small values of disorder",
    "the gap survives , while for @xmath66 the probability to find zero gap is finite , which we interpret as signalling zero gap in the infinite system and a bose glass phase .",
    "we note that , when considering the case of the rung - mott insulator , this method performs a bit worse than in the case of the bose - hubbard model ( at integer fillings ) . indeed , for this value of the hopping parameters , we have that @xmath67 , giving rise to @xmath68 , which is much smaller than the value obtained by numerical simulations .",
    "however , we would like to mention that , even though the finite - size analysis of @xmath51 overestimates the actual value of the transition , it gives a sizable improvement with respect to the simple calculation of the average gap value in presence of disorder .",
    "the precise determination of the critical point is well beyond any numerical calculations and , therefore , we take advantage of the fact that its estimation can be done by using the criterion of ref .  , namely @xmath69 .",

    "regard , whenever the gapped state is doped with a few particles or holes such that their typical spacing will be large , those few carriers on top of the rung - mott phase will effectively see a disordered background .",
    "therefore , standard single - particle anderson localization arguments apply and the system remains insulating by localizing those few carriers on the lifshitz s tails that are in the mott gap . by further increasing the density of particles ( or holes ) ,",
    "a superfluid is eventually formed .",
    "this simple single - particle argument implies the presence of an intervening bose glass between the rung - mott phase and the superfluid .",
    "we proceed to test this argument quantitatively . in fig .",
    "[ fig : largetp ] , we report our numerical results for the superfluid stiffness at densities close to @xmath36 and @xmath28 .",
    "our data is consistent with a transition driven by density from the superfluid phase through the bose glass to finally end up with the rung - mott insulator .",
    "for example , for @xmath73 , the superfluid stiffness appears to vanish just before @xmath36 , however the region in which the bose glass takes place is very small . for @xmath66 the rung - mott insulator",
    "has already been wiped out by the effect of disorder , as observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : distribs ] , and , therefore , this issue can not be addressed .    by considering a larger value of @xmath2 we have two advantages : first , the mott gap is larger , such that the gapped phase is more robust , second , the localization due to disorder is expected to be enhanced , thus , enlarging the bose glass region at @xmath74 ( or @xmath75 ) .",
    "these facts enable us to provide further evidence in favor of an intervening bose glass in between the rung - mott and the superfluid as follows .",
    "we have performed simulations with a rather large @xmath70 .",
    "for such a value of the hoppings , we have that @xmath76 , such that the transition from the gapped to the compressible ( bose - glass ) phase is argued to occur at a @xmath77 . therefore , the system is expected to be gapped for @xmath78 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : largetp ] , we present our results for the superfluid stiffness as function of the disorder strength for several densities close to half filling . from these calculations",
    "we can easily see that , as the density approaches @xmath36 , the critical point where the stiffness vanishes gets smaller , leaving room for a large bose - glass phase in between the superfluid and the rung - mott insulator .",
    "given our results , we can draw the phase diagram for densities close to the rung - mott phase , see fig .",
    "[ fig : tp10 ] .",
    "notice that the large value of @xmath2 ( and therefore the clean mott gap ) ensures the existence of a truly gapped state at half filling .",

    "we have shown that the zero - temperature phase diagram is rather rich and contains different phases ; apart from the trivial mott insulators at @xmath33 and @xmath34 , that are totally frozen due to the hard - core constraint , we found superfluid , bose - glass , and rung - mott phases .",

    "it is just this umklapp that is responsible for the appearance of the rung - mott insulator at any finite @xmath101 . in addition , being marginally relevant , it opens a gap in a berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless fashion , which is hard to detect numerically .",

    "away from half filling , we should keep into account a renormalization of the symmetric sector that can be parameterized by a luttinger liquid parameter @xmath106 through  @xcite @xmath107 since the full density @xmath108 @xmath106 can be easily extracted by the static structure factor in momentum space @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the number of sites per chain . when @xmath111 , the umklapp scattering in eq .",

    "@xcite this would suggest that for @xmath113 a superfluid phase is stable , otherwise disorder is relevant and the bose glass occurs .",
    "according to the theory of the commensurate - incommensurate transition in 1d , we expect in the clean case that , as the density @xmath84 approaches half filling @xmath114 , which would imply that disorder becomes relevant already before the mott transition is approached in density .",
    "however , even if the density @xmath115 we should expect @xmath116 . therefore , whatever is the behavior close to half filling , it must be qualitatively the same also close to zero filling . we know that ,",

    "this also suggests that a harmonic - fluid representation is likely inadequate at low density , hence that the scaling criterium @xmath113 for the appearance of superfluidity may not work .",
    "seemingly , the same argument must apply close to half filling , so that it must not be surprising that the phase boundary between the superfluid and the bose glass goes smoothly and almost linearly to zero , see fig .  [",

    "<S> by means of monte carlo techniques , we study the role of disorder on a system of hard - core bosons in a two - leg ladder with both intra - chain ( @xmath0 ) and inter - chain ( @xmath1 ) hoppings . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the phase diagram as a function of the boson density , disorder strength , and @xmath2 is far from being trivial . </S>",
    "<S> this contrasts the case of spin - less fermions where standard localization arguments apply and an anderson - localized phase pervades the whole phase diagram . </S>",
    "<S> a compressible bose - glass phase always intrudes between the mott insulator with zero ( or one ) bosons per site and the superfluid that is stabilized for weak disorder . at half filling , there is a direct transition between a ( gapped ) rung - mott insulator and a bose glass , which is driven by exponentially rare regions where disorder is suppressed . </S>",
    "<S> finally , by doping the rung - mott insulator , a direct transition to the superfluid is possible only in the clean system , whereas the mott phase is always surrounded by the a bose glass when disorder is present . </S>",
    "<S> the phase diagram based on our numerical evidence is finally reported . </S>"
