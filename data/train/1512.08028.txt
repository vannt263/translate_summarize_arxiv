    "according to the comparison of the six lines , we can find that the influence of the bh spins and mean accretion rates is more significant on @xmath22 than these of the bh masses .",

    "furthermore , we adopt the keplerian angular velocity in the inner radius of the disk , while a more possible angular velocity is sub - keplerian , as well as that in the advection - dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) model ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "if the latter form is true , we can expect that the maximum of the mean neutrino annihilation luminosity will be smaller than the present peak value and the model will be more powerless to explain sgrbs .    in order to definitely examine the evolutive neutrino annihilation model , firstly",

    "the magenta points show the total neutrino annihilation energy in the duration @xmath0 calculated by observational data .",
    "we notice that all points are under our predicted lines , which means that our model can interpret the profiles in sgrb samples .",
    "moreover , the high bh spin or the massive disk is required for some high - luminosity or long - duration sgrbs .",
    "we further tested the consequences of this model by studying the distribution of the disk mass . in figure 3 , we estimate the disk mass with the given bh initial mass and spin for the sample of 30 sgrbs .",
    "we note that the disk mass of most sgrbs is less than @xmath72 , and in some special cases it is larger than the limits . even for the case of figure 3(b ) , there still exists one sgrb whose disk mass is larger than @xmath72 .",
    "it implies that the more extreme spin parameter or another energy mechanism may exist in the center .",
    "the results of figure 3 are generally in agreement with @xcite .",
    "we also plot the time evolution of the mean neutrino annihilation luminosity for lgrbs as shown in figure 4 .",

    "figure 5 displays the predictions of our model compared with the observational data of the neutrino annihilation energy @xmath83 for lgrbs .",
    "the lgrb samples come from the data in @xcite .",
    "some grbs with their durations being less than 2 s or longer than 300 s are not considered @xcite .",

    "all lines are truncated when @xmath88 .",
    "the magenta filled circles represent the lgrb data . in this figure ,",
    "more than half of the data are under our predicted lines , which means that the neutrino annihilation processes can power these lgrbs in the reasonable terms . although adopting extreme initial conditions , some lgrb data are still above or exceed the range of our lines , which reveals the limitation of the mechanism .",
    "to interpret these observed data , the alternative magnetohydrodynamics processes may be required ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "finally , as shown in figure 6 , we also study the distribution of the disk mass in lgrbs and in sgrbs .",
    "we can easily find that the disk mass of more than half of lgrbs is below @xmath89 , and others are beyond the limits , especially in the case of the lower bh spin parameter . even for the case of figure  6(b ) , there still exist some grbs whose disk mass is larger than @xmath90 .",
    "we can definitely eliminate the neutrino annihilation process in the center of those grbs , which also means that the magnetohydrodynamics processes of the disk or magnetars should be considered .",
    "we present the time - dependent mean neutrino annihilation luminosity and show its evolution with the different mean accretion rate and initial bh parameters .",
    "the possibilities of whether this model can account for the prompt emission and afterglow phases of grbs are visited by comparing with the observations .",
    "the results show that our model can interpret most of data except for those of some high - energy lgrbs , which may require alternative magnetohydrodynamics processes in these grbs .",
    "we further give the distribution of the disk mass by combining our model , fireball model , and grb samples .",
    "the results show that even for the extreme bh initial spins , there are still some grbs requiring the massive disks , which approach or exceed the limits in simulations .",
    "gamma - ray prompt emission is followed by the early x - ray afterglow lasting from minutes to hours .",
    "x - ray flares are revealed by _ swift _ @xcite as a common feature of grb afterglows @xcite .",
    "they are frequently observed in lgrbs ( @xmath91 ; @xcite ) and , to a less extent , in sgrbs @xcite .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite suggested that the flaring activities are observed in both lgrbs and sgrbs , and their observational properties are qualitatively consistent with the viscous disk evolution , so the origin of flares is considered as a hyperaccretion disk around a stellar - mass bh , as well as prompt emissions .",
    "they suggested that the gravitational instability occurring in the outer region of the disk may be the candidate for this variability . but @xcite argued that even considering the effects of the magnetic coupling and massive remnants of the disk , neutrino annihilation processes encounter difficulty in interpreting the x - ray flares lasting more than 100 s. this means that the bz mechanism in the disk model or magnetar model is the better candidate for grbs accompanied by the long - lasting x - ray flares . in consideration of the drastic x - ray flares observed in lgrbs , including grb 050724 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the more extreme conditions are required in our model , and the range of application of neutrino annihilation processes may be reduced especially for lgrbs .",
    "furthermore , the afterglows of grbs exhibit the abundant behaviors in the x - ray bands by analyzing the _ swift _ xrt data ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the unusually long ` plateau ' phases ( shallow decay phases ) lasting more than thousands of seconds are observed up to several hundred seconds after the burst trigger , and their plausible explanation is considered as the energy injection from a millisecond magnetar ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and it is difficult to achieve by the neutrino annihilation processes . actually , the plateau phases were observed in some grbs in our sample , for example , grb 070125 , grb 050904 , grb 090313 , and grb 090323 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "so taking the plateau phase energy into account , our results would be more restricted for lgrbs .",
    "it is worth noting that some physical conditions or mechanisms enhancing the neutrino annihilation luminosity could exist in this system .",
    "one of them is to increase the disk mass , the massive disks existing in binaries or collapsars is possible , especially for the binaries composed by @xmath92 nss ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "fortunately , the outflow may appear only for the very low accretion rates when the advective cooling can not balance the viscous heating ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    ", @xcite showed the effects of the vertical convection on the structure and luminosity of the ndaf around a stellar - mass bh in spherical coordinates .",

    "@xcite calculated the structure and neutrino emission of a two - dimensional , relativistic models and compared them with the results of one - dimensional simulations @xcite .",

    "<S> a neutrino - dominated accretion disk around a stellar - mass black hole ( bh ) can power a gamma - ray burst ( grb ) via annihilation of neutrinos launched from the disk . for the bh hyperaccretion system </S>",
    "<S> , high accretion rate should trigger the violent evolution of the bh s characteristics , which further leads to the evolution of the neutrino annihilation luminosity . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we consider the evolution of the accretion system to analyze the mean time - dependent neutrino annihilation luminosity with the different mean accretion rates and initial bh parameters . by time - integrating the luminosity , </S>",
    "<S> the total neutrino annihilation energy with the reasonable initial disk mass can satisfy the most of short - duration grbs and about half of long - duration grbs . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the extreme kerr bh should exist in the cental engines of some high - luminosity grbs . </S>",
    "<S> grbs with higher energy have to request the alternative magnetohydrodynamics processes in the centers , such as the blandford - znajek jet from the accretion system or the millisecond magnetar . </S>"
