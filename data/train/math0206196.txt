    ", this question asks for a comparison between the lower central series and the commutator series of a link group .    in one direction , levine showed that the vanishing of the milnor invariants of a link @xmath0 implies that a localization @xmath19 of its alexander module ( although not the alexander module itself ) vanishes , where @xmath20 $ ] is the multiplicative set of polynomials that evaluate to @xmath21 at @xmath22 ; see @xcite . a boundary link has vanishing milnor invariants , and its alexander module splits as a direct sum of a trivial module and a torsion module .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that all torsion modules with the appropriate symmetry can be realized .    in the opposite direction ,",

    "further , a geometric interpretation of milnor invariants in terms of cycles on seifert surfaces allowed cochran to conclude that the constructed links have nontrivial milnor invariants .",
    "as an elementary application of the calculus of claspers , we will construct a plethora of links with vanishing alexander module .",

    "as we mentioned in the introduction , we will construct links of theorem [ thm.2 ] using _ surgery on claspers_. since claspers play a key role in geometric constructions , as well as in the theory of s , we include a brief discussion here . for a reference on claspers and their associated surgery ,",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite and also to ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 2 ) ( where claspers were called clovers instead ) . it suffices to say that a clasper is a thickening of a trivalent graph , and it has a preferred set of loops , called the leaves .",
    "the degree of a clasper is the number of trivalent vertices ( excluding those at the leaves ) . with our conventions ,",
    "the smallest clasper is a y - clasper ( which has degree one and three leaves ) , so we explicitly exclude struts ( which would be of degree zero with two leaves ) .    a clasper @xmath54 of degree  1 is an embedding @xmath55 of a regular neighborhood of the graph @xmath56    @xmath57 in a 3-manifold @xmath41 .",
    "surgery on @xmath54 can be described by cutting @xmath58 from @xmath41 ( which is a genus  3 handlebody ) , twisting by a fixed diffeomorphism of its boundary ( which acts trivially on the homology of the boundary ) and gluing back .",

    "the six component link consists of a @xmath60-framed borromean ring and an arbitrarily framed three component link , the so - called _ leaves _ of @xmath54 . if one of the leaves bounds a @xmath60-framed disk disjoint from the rest of @xmath54 , then surgery on @xmath54 does not change the ambient 3-manifold @xmath41 , although it can change an embedded link in @xmath41 . in particular , surgery on a clasper of degree  1",
    "is shown as follows :    @xmath61 in general , surgery on a clasper @xmath54 of degree @xmath42 can be described in terms of simultaneous surgery on @xmath42 claspers @xmath62 , which are obtained from @xmath54 after breaking its edges and inserting hopf links as follows :    @xmath63      surgery on a clasper is described by twisting by a surface diffeomorphism that acts trivially on homology , thus we have the basic principle :    surgery on claspers with leaves of a resticted type has already been studied and used successfully in @xcite ( where the leaves were assumed null homologous in a knot complement ) , @xcite ( and where the leaves where null homotopic ) and @xcite ( where the leaves where in the kernel of a map to a free group ) .",
    "it is important to study not only 3-manifolds but rather pairs of 3-manifolds together with a representation of their fundamental group into a fixed group .",
    "claspers adapt well to this point of view , as we explain next .",
    "consider a pair @xmath64 of a 3-manifold @xmath65 ( possibly noncompact ) and a representation @xmath66 for some group @xmath56 .",

    "we will call such claspers @xmath68-_null _ , or simply _ null _ , if @xmath68 is clear .",
    "surgery on @xmath54 gives rise to a 4-manifold @xmath69 whose boundary consists of one copy of @xmath65 and one copy of @xmath70 .",
    "we may think that @xmath69 is obtained by attaching @xmath71 2-handles on @xmath72 , where @xmath73 .",
    "since the cores of these handles lie in the kernel of @xmath68 , it follows that @xmath68 extends over @xmath69 , and in particular restricts to a representation @xmath74 on the end @xmath70 of @xmath69 .",
    "we have @xmath75 .",
    "let @xmath76 ( resp .",
    "@xmath77 ) denote the cover of @xmath65 ( resp .",
    "@xmath70 ) corresponding to @xmath68 ( resp .",
    "@xmath74 ) . surgery on @xmath54 is equivalent to surgery on a collection @xmath78 of degree @xmath30 claspers , constructed by inserting hopf links in the edges of @xmath54 .",
    "each @xmath79 lifts to a collection @xmath80 of claspers in @xmath76 ; let @xmath81 .",
    "then , @xmath77 can be identified with @xmath82 .",
    "since clasper surgery preserves homology , the result follows .",
    "we will adapt the above lemma in the following situation .",
    "suppose that @xmath54 is a clasper in the complement of an unlink @xmath83 of @xmath26 components whose leaves are null homologous in @xmath84 , and let @xmath85 denote the result of surgery along @xmath54 on the pair @xmath86 .",
    "it follows that @xmath54 lifts to a family @xmath87 of claspers in @xmath88 ( the universal abelian cover of @xmath89 ) and that @xmath90 is obtained from @xmath91 , by surgery on @xmath87 , where @xmath92 .",
    "since @xmath93 , and clasper surgery preserves homology , it follows that @xmath94 .",
    "there are two known cases where surgery on a null clasper @xmath95 gives rise to a link @xmath85 with vanishing milnor invariants .",
    "\\(a ) if the leaves of @xmath54 are null homotopic in @xmath84 , then the constructed links would be boundary links , as was observed and used in @xcite .",
    "boundary links have vanishing milnor invariants .",
    "\\(b ) if @xmath54 is a connected clasper with at least one loop , then @xmath85 is concordant to @xmath86 , @xcite and also @xcite .",
    "concordance preserves milnor invariants .    with a bit more effort",
    ", we can arrange that @xmath96 .",
    "for this , it suffices to assume that each connected component @xmath79 of @xmath54 has a 0-framed leaf @xmath97 , such that the union of the leaves @xmath98 is an unlink in @xmath1 .    to finalize the construction of theorem [ thm.1 ] ,",
    "consider a pattern @xmath31 , and a vertex @xmath32 of @xmath31 such that @xmath99 where @xmath100 are rooted trees which are not struts .",

    "given @xmath31 as above , we will choose a clasper @xmath105 of degree @xmath30 such that its three leaves @xmath97 satisfy @xmath106 $ ] , for @xmath107 .",
    "then , @xmath36 is obtained from the unlink by clasper surgery on @xmath105 .",
    "finally , let us modify the above discussion for the construction of theorem [ thm.2 ] .",
    "given an @xmath42-pattern @xmath49 , let @xmath108 be a tree clasper of degree @xmath42 in @xmath84 , which consists of @xmath48 and @xmath109 leaves @xmath97 ( one in each univalent vertex of @xmath48 ) .",
    "there is a 1 - 1 correspondence between the connected components @xmath100 of @xmath51 and the leaves @xmath97 of @xmath108 .",
    "we will choose these leaves so that @xmath110 , and we will let @xmath111 be obtained from the unlink by clasper surgery on @xmath108 .    we need to show that @xmath111 has trivial @xmath42th alexander module . indeed , using the figures above that describe clasper surgery , it follows that clasper surgery on @xmath108 is equivalent to surgery on a clasper @xmath112 of degree @xmath30 whose leaves lie in @xmath113 .",
    "this implies that the @xmath42th alexander module of @xmath111 is trivial .",
    "we end this section with a comment on pictures . to get _ pictures _ of the constructed links ,",
    "one may use various descriptions of surgery on a clasper that were discussed at length by goussarov and habiro at @xcite . from our point of view",
    "though , these pictures are complicated and unnecessary , since not only claspers describe surgery adequately , but also the invariants which we will use behave well with respect to clasper surgery .",
    "this is the content of the next section .",
    "as was stated in the discussion of theorem [ thm.1 ] , we will not compute the milnor invariants of the links @xmath36 constructed via clasper surgery , but rather we will compute the tree - part of their aarhus integral .",
    "the aarhus integral is a graph version of stationary phase approximation that was introduced at @xcite . despite its intimidating name ,",
    "it is a rather harmless combinatorial object which we now describe .",
    "consider a framed link @xmath114 and let @xmath115 denote the result of surgery on @xmath116 .",
    "that is , @xmath41 is the 3-manifold obtained from @xmath1 by surgery on @xmath116 and @xmath0 is the image of @xmath7 after surgery . assuming that @xmath41 is a rational homology sphere ( i.e. , that the linking matrix of @xmath116 has nonzero determinant ) the aarhus integral @xmath117 can be computed by the kontsevich integral of the link @xmath118 by integration as follows : @xmath119 ( where @xmath89 is a set of variables in 1 - 1 correspondence with the components of @xmath116 ) .",
    "let us briefly recall from @xcite how this integration works .",
    "consider an element @xmath120 with @xmath121 a series of graphs that do not contain a strut whose legs are colored by @xmath89 .",
    "notice that @xmath122 and @xmath121 , the @xmath89-_strutless part _ of @xmath123 , are uniquely determined by @xmath123 .",
    "then , the integration @xmath124 glues all the @xmath89-colored legs of @xmath121 pairwise , using the negative inverse of the matrix @xmath122 . that is , when two legs @xmath125 of @xmath121 are glued , the resulting graph is multiplied by @xmath126 , the negative inverse of the matrix @xmath127 .",
    "let us adapt the above discussion when the link @xmath116 is one that describes clasper surgery .",
    "consider a null clasper @xmath131 of degree @xmath30 constructed from a pattern @xmath31 and let @xmath132 .",
    "let @xmath133 denotes the _ lowest degree nonvanishing tree part _ of @xmath128 .",
    "assuming that the pattern is nonvanishing , and after we choose string - link representatives of @xmath134 , we will show that        ( of proposition [ prop.min ] ) surgery on @xmath54 is equivalent to surgery on a @xmath136 component link @xmath137 ; see section [ sub.surgery ] .",
    "@xmath138 is a borromean link and @xmath139 consists of the leaves of @xmath54 . in the obvious basis ,",

    "consider a tree @xmath101 labeled by @xmath118 .",
    "if @xmath101 has a @xmath152-labeled leg , then it must either have legs labeled by all three edges of @xmath54 , or else it must have a leg labeled by @xmath151 .",
    "indeed , @xmath152 is an unknot in a ball disjoint from @xmath153 , thus the rest of the trees have vanishing coefficient in @xmath129 .",
    "consider further a _ vortex _ @xmath154 ( that is , a unitrivalent graph of the shape @xmath154 with three univalent vertices and one trivalent one ) whose legs are labeled by three leaves of @xmath54 . then , the coefficient of @xmath154 in @xmath130 is @xmath30 .",
    "consider further a tree @xmath101 with one univalent vertex labeled by a leaf @xmath151 of @xmath54 and all other vertices labeled by @xmath7 .",
    "recall the corresponding rooted tree @xmath100 which is a component of @xmath33 .",

    "this , together with the above discussion and the gluing rules concludes the proof of proposition [ prop.min ] .",
    "the argument is best illustrated by the following figure : @xmath157    the above proposition and its proof generalize easily to the case of claspers @xmath54 corresponding to nonvanishing @xmath42-patterns @xmath49 . in that case , if @xmath85 denote the corresponding link , we still have that @xmath158 which implies theorem [ thm.2 ] .    in the above discussion we have silently chosen dotted morse link representatives ( or equivalently , string - link representatives ) and we ought to have normalized the aarhus integral . but this does not affect the lowest degree nonvanishing tree part ."
