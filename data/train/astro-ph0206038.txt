    "two of the main questions concerning molecular cloud ( mc ) structure and star formation are a ) what is the origin and supply of mc turbulence ? and",
    "b ) what is the origin of the low efficiency of star formation ? indeed , mcs are known to be turbulent , with motions that are supersonic at scales @xmath3 pc ( zuckerman & evans 1974 ; larson 1981 ) .",
    "however , recent numerical simulations ( padoan & nordlund 1999 ; mac low et al .",
    "1998 ; stone , ostriker & gammie 1998 ; mac low 1999 ; see also avila - reese & vzquez - semadeni 2001 for the case of the global ism ) have suggested that strong mhd turbulence decays rapidly even in the presence of strong magnetic fields .",
    "thus , it appears that mc turbulence must be continually driven during the entire lifetime of the clouds .",
    "the driving mechanism , however , is probably not restricted to the stellar activity _ internal _ to the clouds , since clouds devoid of stars exhibit similar turbulent properties as clouds with stars ( e.g. , mckee 1999 and references therein ) .    concerning the star formation efficiency ( sfe ) , it is well known that it is low , on the order of a few percent with respect to the total cloud mass .",
    "traditional explanations for this low efficiency have been , in the case of low - mass , isolated star formation , that the mc cores in which stars form are magnetically supported ( i.e. , `` subcritical '' ) , so that collapse is delayed until the magnetic field diffuses out of the core by ambipolar diffusion ( see , e.g. , shu , adams & lizano 1987 ) however , there exist several recent suggestions that all cores are critical or supercritical ( e.g. , nakano 1998 ; hartmann , ballesteros - paredes & bergin 2001 ; bourke et al .  2001 ;",
    "crutcher , heiles & troland 2002 ) . on the other hand",
    ", it is known that turbulence can prevent global gravitational collapse of a cloud when the energy injection scale is smaller than the jeans length ( lorat , passot & pouquet 1990 ; klessen , heitsch & mac low 2000 , hereafter khm00 ) , while promoting `` fragmentation '' , i.e. , the formation of smaller - scale density substructures that can possibly undergo local collapse ( sasao 1973 ; tohline , bodenheimer & christodolou 1987 ; elmegreen 1993 ; vzquez - semadeni , passot & pouquet 1996 ; padoan 1995 ; padoan et al .",
    "2001 ; khm00 ) .",
    "khm00 have shown that the efficiency in numerical simulations ( measured as the fraction of mass in collapsed objects ) is large when the energy injection scale is larger than the jeans length , and low otherwise .",
    "however , it is possible , as we suggest in  2 that mc turbulence is part of a cascade coming from larger scales .",
    "thus , the description in terms of an energy injection scale smaller than the mc itself is probably not optimal for real mcs .",
    "also , this shows that the origin of mc turbulence and of the sfe are intimately related .    in the present paper ,",
    "we propose that _ mc turbulence originates from the same process that forms the clouds _ (  2 ) , and sets an upper limit to the sfe through the fraction of the total mass it deposits in regions with sizes such that the turbulent velocity dispersion becomes subsonic ( so that no further subfragmentation can occur within them ) , and masses larger than their jeans mass (  3 ) .",
    "in this section we suggest , without proof , a plausible scenario for the production of mc turbulence as a byproduct of their formation process . it has been proposed that mcs are formed by the convergence of large - scale streams in the diffuse ism ( elmegreen 1993 ; ballesteros - paredes , vzquez - semadeni & scalo 1999 , hereafter bvs99 ) .",
    "although the mcs formed in the global ism simulations of bvs99 were at the limit of the resolution , rendering it impossible to resolve the internal structure of the resulting clouds , one can infer it from other pieces of evidence .",
    "this cloud formation mechanism is analogous to the formation of shock - bounded slabs between convergent flows , a process which is known to be subject to fragmentation through nonlinear instabilities ( vishniac 1994 ) .",
    "this process has been simulated numerically by various groups ( hunter et al .",
    "1986 ; klein & woods 1998 ; folini & walder 1998 ) , showing that it generates fully developed turbulence in the shocked slab .",
    "therefore , one expects turbulence to be maintained for the entire duration of the stream collision that forms the mc . in this scenario , mcs _ and _ their internal turbulence are the consequence of a _ lossy _ energy cascade in compressible turbulent flows , in which at every scale a fraction of the energy is dissipated directly by shocks and the remainder is passed to smaller - scale structures ( kornreich & scalo 2000 ) .",
    "also , since the resulting mc is not confined to a closed box , contrary to the case of simulations of isolated clouds , and the compressible turbulence generated produces both excesses _ and _ defects in the density field , part of the material of the cloud can be dispersed during the process .",
    "numerical experiments aimed at investigating this process in detail are now underway using adaptive - grid and sph numerical techniques , and will be reported elsewhere .",
    "assuming that turbulence is maintained for the lifetime of the mc as described above , then the spatial redistribution ( `` turbulent fragmentation '' ) of both mass and the various energies it produces implies that only a fraction of the mass in the turbulent cloud can end up in collapsed structures , assuming that the total turbulent+thermal ( collectively referred to as `` kinetic '' ) energy is comparable to its self - gravitating energy . in this case , the kinetic energy provides support against global collapse of the whole cloud , while simultaneously it promotes the production of smaller - scale density structures through turbulent compressions , with the process repeating itself at subsequently smaller scales , _ until a change of regime occurs_. a natural scale for a transition regime is the scale at which the turbulent velocity difference becomes equal to the sound speed is just a characteristic scale for this to occur , there being a distribution of clump sizes at which the equality occurs . ] , denoted @xmath4 .",
    "below this scale , the turbulence becomes subsonic , and is incapable of producing further subfragmentation .",
    "moreover , at this scale , thermal energy becomes dominant in the support of the substructures , and thus the jeans criterion becomes the relevant one for determining whether a given density peak ( a `` core '' ) can become gravitationally dominated and collapse .",
    "given the statistical distribution of core masses and sizes formed by the turbulence , only a fraction of the structures of size @xmath1 will have masses larger than the jeans mass at this scale .    since the turbulent fragmentation deposits ever smaller fractions of the total mass in ever smaller - size structures , the present scenario implies that flows with smaller values of @xmath4 must have smaller fractions of mass available for collapse .",
    "this can be tested experimentally by setting up simulations with different ratios of turbulent to thermal enery , so that they have different values of @xmath1 . to do this",
    ", we use the simulations of non - magnetic isothermal turbulence of khm00 , which include cases with the same total kinetic energy , but forced at different scales , so that @xmath1 is different , and simulations with different amounts of kinetic energy , but similar @xmath1 . in fig .  1 we show the turbulent energy spectra of three of these simulations , and their sfe , measured as the fraction of mass in collapsed objects as a function of time .",
    "this figure shows that runs with similar values of @xmath1 have similar sfes , irrespective of their total kinetic energy , and vice versa .",
    "it is worth comparing with the proposal of khm00 that the relevant parameter is the energy injection ( or `` driving '' ) scale of the turbulence , @xmath5 .",
    "this parameter clearly affects @xmath1 because , for fixed total turbulent energy ( given by the integral of the energy spectrum over @xmath6 ) , injecting the energy at smaller scales forces a larger energy content per wavenumber range at small scales ( compare the spectra of runs a1 and a3 ) .",
    "however , we see that runs b1 and a3 , which were forced at different scales , manage to have similar sfe because they have similar @xmath1 .",
    "we conclude that @xmath1 is the main parameter of the turbulent energy spectrum controlling the sfe .",
    "we have shown numerical evidence that @xmath1 is a relevant parameter in setting an upper limit to the sfe ( other processes , such as stellar energy feedback , may contribute as well ) .",
    "however , it is most likely that other parameters are also involved . in particular , as the spectral energy distribution of the turbulence varies , the sizes of the density structures are likely to change as well .",
    "padoan ( 1995 ) made an attempt in this direction based on the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of the density field .",
    "however , the pdf contains no information of the mass spatial distribution .",
    "what is necessary is the density pdf _",
    "parameterized by region size_. this is precisely the kind of information contained in the multifractal spectrum , and which we are in the process of incorporating into the treatment .",
