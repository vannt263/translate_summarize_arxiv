    "<S> the main idea of our approach is sketched in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> we work with a basis of dressed states whose very definition incorporates the non - adiabatic processes . </S>",
    "<S> then , by introducing additional control fields , we can ensure these dressed states coincide with the desired adiabatic eigenstate at the initial and final time of the protocol . </S>",
    "<S> it is thus possible to do a state transfer by having the exact dynamics follow these new dressed states , even if the protocol is too fast to allow a naive adiabatic evolution . </S>",
    "<S> we illustrate this general idea by developing simple and effective pulses for speeding up adiabatic state transfer in generic @xmath0-system setups .         </S>",
    "<S> + _ general problem  </S>",
    "<S> _ we consider a general composite quantum system , comprised of source , intermediate and target subsystems , respectively labeled a , b , and c. the goal is to transfer some initial quantum state @xmath1 ( e.g. a qubit state ) from subsystem a to the target subsystem c. adiabatic transfer achieves this goal by constructing a time - dependent hamiltonian whose instantaneous eigenstates evolve in a way that facilitates the transfer . </S>",
    "<S> we start by assuming that one has constructed such a protocol . </S>",
    "<S> the instantaneous eigenstates ( hereafter referred to as adiabatic eigenstates ) and corresponding adiabatic energies ( both indexed by @xmath2 ) are defined via @xmath3 a subset of eigenstates has been engineered to form a basis of the a subsystem at initial time @xmath4 and a basis of the target system at the final time @xmath5 . </S>",

    "<S> the states @xmath10 and @xmath11 are not necessarily equal .    </S>",
    "<S> it follows that if the evolution is perfectly adiabatic ( i.e.  happens on a time - scale @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the smallest instantaneous energy gap of the system ) , the initial source state will be mapped on the final target state . </S>",
    "<S> however for @xmath14 , the evolution will not be perfectly adiabatic . </S>",
    "<S> it is convenient to move to the adiabatic frame where the adiabatic eigenstates are time - independent . </S>",
    "<S> the relevant unitary is @xmath15 . at each instant in time , @xmath16 maps the adiabatic eigenstate @xmath17 onto the time - independent state @xmath18 . in the adiabatic frame , the hamiltonian becomes : @xmath19 the operator @xmath20 generically has off - diagonal matrix elements connecting the various adiabatic eigenstates . </S>",
    "<S> the magnitude of these matrix elements increases as @xmath21 decreases , leading to imperfect state transfer . </S>",
    "<S> + _ correcting non - adiabatic errors  _ in order to correct the non - adiabatic errors , we look for a correction hamiltonian @xmath22 such that the modified hamiltonian , @xmath23 , leads to a perfect state transfer . </S>",
    "<S> for this scheme to be reasonable , we require that @xmath24 has no unattainably - large coupling strengths and that @xmath22 does not involve couplings that can not be experimentally implemented .    our strategy is based on the observation that the corrected dynamics only needs to evolve the system from the correct state at @xmath4 to the correct state at @xmath5 ( cf . </S>",
