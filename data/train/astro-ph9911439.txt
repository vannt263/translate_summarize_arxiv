    "major cluster mergers are the most energetic events in the universe since the big bang . in these mergers ,",
    "the subclusters collide at velocities of @xmath22000 km / s , and shocks are driven into the intracluster medium . in major mergers , these hydrodynamical shocks dissipate energies of @xmath3 ergs ; such shocks are the major heating source for the x - ray emitting intracluster medium .",
    "mergers shocks should heat and compress the x - ray emitting intracluster gas , and increase its entropy .",
    "we also expect that particle acceleration by these shocks will produce nonthermal electrons and ions , and these can produce synchrotron radio , inverse compton ( ic ) euv and hard x - ray , and gamma - ray emission .",

    "merger shocks heat and compress the intracluster gas , and these effects can be used to determine the geometry and kinematics of the merger .",
    "asca x - ray temperature maps and rosat images have been used in an initial effort to apply this technique@xcite .",
    "the cluster containing the radio source cygnus a is a particularly simple case ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cyga ] ) .",
    "this appears to be a fairly symmetric merger with a low impact parameter .",
    "the merger is at an early phase , with the merger shocks being located between the two subcluster centers .",
    "a hydro / n - body simulation of the merger@xcite is shown at the right in fig .",
    "[ fig : cyga ] ( not to the same scale ) . presumably , the fact that the merger shocks have not yet passed through the subcluster centers is the reason why the merger hasnt disrupted the cygnus a radio source or the surrounding cooling flow .",
    "the simple geometry of this merger makes it easy to apply the shock jump conditions to determine the merger velocity . from the rankine ",

    "\\label{eq : shock2}\\ ] ] for a symmetric merger , the merger velocity of the two subclusters is just @xmath9 .",
    "when the asca temperatures are used , this gives @xmath10 km / s .",
    "the radial velocity distribution of the galaxies in this cluster is bimodal@xcite and consistent with a merger velocity of 2400 km / s .",
    "interestingly , the collision velocity found above is close to the free - fall velocity of @xmath22200 km / s for the two subclusters if they had fallen from a large distance to their observed separation .",
    "this consistency suggests that the shock energy is effectively thermalized , and that a major fraction does not go into turbulence , magnetic fields , or cosmic rays .",

    "radio observations of supernova remnants indicate that at least a few percent of the shock energy goes into the acceleration of relativistic electrons in shocks with @xmath11 km / s .",
    "even more energy may go into relativistic ions .",
    "given that all of the thermal energy of the intracluster gas in clusters is due to shocks with such velocities , it seems likely that relativistic electrons with a total energy of @xmath12 ergs are produced in clusters , with perhaps even higher energies in ions .",
    "clusters are also very good storage locations for cosmic rays . under reasonable assumptions for the diffusion coefficient ,",
    "particles with energies @xmath13@xmath14 gev have diffusion times which are longer than the hubble time@xcite . although high energy electrons lose energy rapidly due to ic and synchrotron emission , electrons with lorentz factors of @xmath0 have long lifetimes@xcite,@xcite .",
    "thus , clusters of galaxies can retain low energy electrons ( @xmath0 ) and nearly all cosmic ray ions for a significant fraction of a hubble time .",
    "recently , i have calculated models for the relativistic electrons in clusters , assuming they are primary@xcite .",
    "[ fig : espect](a ) shows the electron spectrum in a cluster with a typical history .",
    "most of the electron energy is in electrons with @xmath0 , which have the longest lifetimes .",
    "these electrons are produced by mergers over the entire history of the cluster .",
    "this cluster also has a small ongoing merger which produces the high energy tail on the electron distribution .",
    "most of the emission from these electrons is due to ic , and the resulting spectrum is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : espect](b ) . for comparison , thermal bremsstrahlung with a typical rich cluster temperature and luminosity",
    "is shown as a dashed curve .",
    "[ fig : espect](b ) shows that clusters should be strong sources of extreme ultraviolet ( euv ) radiation .",
    "since this emission is due to electrons with @xmath0 which have very long lifetimes , euv radiation should be a common feature of clusters@xcite .",
    "in fact , the euve satellite appears to have detected all of the clusters it observed@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite . in clusters with an ongoing merger , the higher energy electrons will produce a hard x - ray tail ; the same electrons will produce diffuse radio synchrotron emission .",
    "such radio halos are seen in a number of clusters , all of which show evidence for ongoing mergers@xcite .",
    "bepposax observations show hard x - ray excesses in the coma@xcite and abell 2199@xcite clusters .",
    "coma has a radio halo and is undergoing at least one merger ; on the other hand , abell 2199 has no radio halo@xcite nor any evidence for a merger .",
    "it is possible that the hard tail in abell 2199 has some other explanation ; for example , it might be due to nonthermal bremsstrahlung@xcite .",
    "relativistic electrons and ions in clusters are also expected to produce strong gamma - ray emission .",
    "the region near 100 mev is particularly interesting , as this region includes bremsstrahlung from the most common electrons with @xmath0 and gamma - rays from ions produced by @xmath15 decay .",
