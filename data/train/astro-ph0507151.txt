    "the formation of stars and their planetary systems is generally viewed as a low temperature phenomenon .",
    "dark molecular cores at @xmath9 k collapse to pre - main sequence ( pms ) stars with surfaces at @xmath10 k surrounded by dusty disks with characteristic temperatures of @xmath11 k. these earliest stages of stellar evolution are studied primarily in the millimeter through optical bands .",
    "most efforts to understand the astrophysics of these stages treat gravitational , hydrodynamical and chemical processes of neutral molecular material in gaseous and solid forms .    however , three lines of evidence point to the presence of higher energy phenomena in young stellar systems , ranging from excited gas at temperatures of @xmath12 k , to highly - ionized plasma at @xmath13 k , to particles accelerated up to @xmath14 mev energies :    1 .   low - excitation emission line gas , which dominates the optical spectra of t tauri stars and was formerly attributed to hot outflowing winds , is now commonly thought to arise in magnetically funneled accretion from the circumstellar disk ( see review by hartmann 2001 ) . to conserve angular momentum , the accretion is accompanied by ejection of disk material in magnetically collimated jets seen as herbig - haro outflows ( shu et al .",
    "x - ray emission is ubiquitous in pms stars at levels that are orders of magnitude above those seen in most main sequence stars .",
    "these pms stars generally show high - amplitude rapid variability and the type of hard spectra that are associated with violent magnetic reconnection flares when seen on the surface of the sun , dme flare stars and other magnetically active late - type stars ( feigelson & montmerle 1999 , favata & micela 2003 , g \" udel 2004 ) .",
    "studies of the isotopic composition of components of ancient meteorites require either the injection of short - lived nuclides into the molecular cloud that formed our solar system , or _ in situ _ irradiation of solids by mev baryons in the solar nebula ( goswami & vanhala 2000 ) .",
    "radio observations show gyrosynchrotron radiation from mev electrons accelerated by magnetic flares in some young stellar systems ( g \" udel 2002 ) .",
    "together , these studies indicate that astrophysical modeling of young stellar systems , and particularly their protoplanetary disks , requires treatment of ionization , nuclear spallation , and magnetohydrodynamical processes in addition to processes affecting neutral materials ( see reviews by feigelson & montmerle 1999 , glassgold , feigelson , & montmerle 2000 ; hereafter gfm00 , feigelson 2005 and glassgold et al .",
    "high - energy photon and particle irradiation of protoplanetary disks may substantially alter the thermal , chemical , ionization , and dynamical ( e.g. , laminar @xmath15 turbulent flow ) state of the disk .",
    "long - standing mysteries in solar nebula studies , such as the flash melting of meteoritic chondrules and the presence of short - lived radionuclides , may be explained , at least in part , by these high energy phenomena in young stellar systems .",
    "planet formation and early evolution such as inward migration should be substantially different in an irradiated disk as compared to an isolated disk .",
    "disk solids will be affected both by the observed x - rays and by other high energy manifestations of the violent magnetic connection process that heats the x - ray emitting plasma .",
    "these flare events should produce shock fronts analogous to solar coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) accompanied by baryons and electrons accelerated to mev energies .",
    "for example , the solar x17 flare of 28 oct 2003 produced a peak fluence of @xmath16 protons @xmath17",
    "s@xmath4 ster@xmath4 mev@xmath4 around 1 kev and @xmath18 protons @xmath17",
    "s@xmath4 ster@xmath4 mev@xmath4 around 1 mev , as measured by the advanced composition explorer .",
    "this represents a rise of a factor of @xmath19 in particle fluence from the quiescent level and was accompanied by a @xmath20-fold outburst in x - ray emission with peak x - ray luminosity @xmath21 erg s@xmath4 seen with the goes12 satellite . when scaled upward to the @xmath22 ergs s@xmath4 flares seen in t tauri stars surrounded by protoplanetary disks , the inferred x - ray or shock wave heating may flash melt chondrules ( shu et al .",
    "2001 , nakamoto et al .  2005 ) and the inferred mev particle fluence may produce anomalous abundances of short - lived radionuclides seen in ca - al - rich inclusions ( cais ) of ancient carbonaceous chondritic meteorites ( feigelson 1982 , gounelle et al .",

    "the study of the effects of high energy products of magnetic flares on young circumstellar disks is being propelled by observations with the @xmath0 @xmath23 @xmath24 with its large collecting area and elliptic orbit that permits long continuous exposures .",
    "the vla radio telescope also provides direct measurements of gyrosynchrotron emission from mev electrons in some young stars ( gdel 2002 ) .",
    "feigelson , garmire , & pravdo ( 2002 ; henceforth fgp02 ) investigated the x - ray flaring of a complete sample of 43 solar - mass stars in the orion nebula cluster ( onc ) observed with @xmath0 s advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) in two @xmath25hour exposures during 1999 - 2000 .",
    "they found that solar analogs with ages @xmath26myr exhibit flares @xmath27 times more powerful and @xmath28 times more often than the most powerful flares on the contemporary sun and argued that such flares imply factors of @xmath29 enhancement in the mev proton fluence from the young sun .",
    "they conclude that this is sufficient to explain some of the important cai isotopic anomalies by _ in situ _ spallation reactions .",
    "the present paper continues this effort to measure flaring properties of young solar analogs directly and understand the impact on protoplanetary disks .",
    "the principal goal of this study is to obtain quantitative measures of the variability , particularly the impulsive flaring , of pre - main sequence analogs of our sun .",
    "we establish the frequency , duration and energetics of flaring , and strive to understand their effects on the protoplanetary disks that surround many of these stars .",
    "we then study the effect of the flares on the disk .",
    "our paper is based on a nearly continuous observation of the onc made with @xmath0 s acis detector over a 13.2-day period in january 2003 .",
    "known as the @xmath0 orion ultradeep project ( coup ) , this observation provides the most comprehensive database for studies of young stellar x - rays and magnetic activity ( getman et al .",
    "2005 ; henceforth g05 ) .",
    "due to strong dependencies of x - ray luminosity on stellar mass ( preibisch et al .",
    "2005a ) , we limit this study to stars with masses close to 1.0 m@xmath30 .",
    "section 2 defines the sample , ",
    "3 describes our extraction of flares from the complex x - ray light curves , and  4 outlines our spectral analysis procedures",
    ". results on the x - ray intensities , durations , frequencies , energetics and dependencies on stellar age and disk properties are presented in  5 .",
    "implications for effects of protoplanetary disk gases and solids are outlined in  6 .",
    "the coup observation , field of view , x - ray source detection , event extraction , x - ray properties and stellar counterparts are described in detail by g05 , who give extensive tables of source properties .",
    "the present paper gives a close examination of the subset of coup sources with masses @xmath31 m@xmath30 , which is roughly in the mass range of f7-g5 stars on the zero age main sequence ( zams ) .",
    "this selection permits comparison with samples of zams g stars from the pleiades , hyades and other stellar samples ( preibisch 2005b ) .",
    "twenty - eight coup sources in table  9 of g05 and two undetected stars in their table  11 have masses in the desired range giving a total sample size of 30 stars for our study .",
    "these sources are shown on the coup and 2mass fields in figure 1 .",
    "these masses were derived in g05 by applying the evolutionary tracks of siess , dufour , & forestini ( 2000 ; henceforth sdf00 ) to stellar positions in the hertzsprung - russell diagram derived from optical spectroscopy and photometry of @xmath32 onc stars by hillenbrand ( 1997 ) [ as updated in g05 ] .",
    "choices of mass tracks and spectral type to temperature conversions used in g05 were made to maximize utility and were not optimized for a particular study .",
    "the sample used here differs from that obtained by fgp02 , who also used the hr diagram of hillenbrand ( 1997 ) but applied the theoretical tracks of dantona & mazzitelli ( 1997 ; henceforth dm97 ) .",
    "the sdf00 calculations have different treatments of degenerate electron pressure , chemical composition and mixing length parameter from those of dm97 tracks .",
    "while the two sets tracks show similar performance with respect to dynamically measured masses ( hillenbrand & white 2004 ) , the sdf00 tracks were selected in g05 for their applicability to a wider range of masses for the full coup study .",
    "how well the stars selected here truly represent `` young suns '' depends strongly on the ability of models to predict accurate masses from temperatures and luminosities and upon limitations in measuring those quantities .",
    "compared to the dm97 tracks , the sdf00 tracks predict surface temperatures up to 600 k cooler and higher luminosities for @xmath33 m@xmath34 stars along the convective hayashi tracks .",
    "consequently , for a given luminosity the sdf00 age estimate is younger and the mass estimate is higher .",
    "the masses range from 10% to 100% increases over those predicted by dm97 .",
    "the result is that most of the 30 stars considered here lie below the @xmath35 m@xmath30 range considered by fgp02  only 7 stars are in common between the two samples .",
    "the samples would have more closely overlapped had we considered the @xmath36 m@xmath30 sdf00 mass range .",
    "another selection effect implicit in the use of the hillenbrand ( 1997 ) spectroscopic sample is the omission of heavily obscured onc stars .",
    "the highest extinction in our subsample is @xmath37 .",
    "thus , we exclude a number of obscured stars whose location in the @xmath38 diagram ( see e.g. , hillenbrand & carpenter 2000 ) predicts a mass around 1m@xmath30 .",
    "we also omit the weak - lined t tauri star gmr - a with @xmath39 and an inferred mass slightly over 1 m@xmath30 ; it exhibited extraordinarily powerful radio and x - ray flares during the coup observation ( bower et al .",
    "again , we believe that the omission of high-@xmath40 stars from consideration will have little or no effect on our conclusions regarding magnetic activity of solar analogs .",
    "it has the further advantage that soft x - ray absorption in our sample is never very strong with column densities @xmath41 @xmath17 .",
    "table 1 lists measured optical and near - infrared properties of the sample stars , and table  2 gives inferred properties such as effective temperature @xmath42 , bolometric luminosity @xmath43 , radius @xmath44 , mass @xmath45 , age @xmath46 , in addition to the @xmath47-band excess ( @xmath48 ) and the equivalent width of the triplet .",
    "we do not tabulate the errors in the table for clarity , but they can be significant .",
    "a recent analysis by hillenbrand & white ( 2004 ) found that pms stars of about 1m@xmath30 have luminosity errors of about 0.1 dex .",
    "this reflects typical spectral subclass errors ( of one subclass ) , photometric errors introduced both by observational error ( less than 3% ) , variability and extinction ( errors of @xmath49 10% ) .",
    "the choice of a particular pms evolutionary mass model will introduce a bias in source selection .",
    "hillenbrand & white found that the dm97 and sdf00 models both systematically underestimate sub - solar masses by 10%30% on average , with scatter of the same order .",
    "further , we note the very non  uniform mass distribution among the sources listed in table  2 : only one source lies between 0.95 and 1.09 m@xmath30 .",
    "this is caused by the quantization of temperature to 200 degree increments ( 0.02 dex in log t ) by g05 .",
    "a temperature difference of 200k corresponds to 0.2 m@xmath30 along the convective part of the evolutionary track in these models .",
    "this limitation of the dataset quantizes sample masses somewhat and results in a systematic shift in the attributed mass of stars , with masses between 1.31.0 m@xmath30 shifting toward 1.12 m@xmath30 , and masses between 1.00.8 m@xmath30 shifting toward 0.90 m@xmath30 .",
    "we can not limit the mass selection as tightly as we had hoped for stars younger than about log 6.5 yrs , but we believe these issues have little effect on our conclusions , other than shifting slightly downward the average x - ray luminosities as compared to fgp02 ( see also preibisch 2005a ) .    all quantities in table  1 are obtained from the tables of g05 where a full description of their derivation is given . throughout this paper , we refer to sources by their coup number which ranges from @xmath50 .",
    "the corresponding optical identifier is the star number in jones and walker ( 1988 ) .",
    "there is virtually no uncertainty in the association of coup and bright optical onc stars as the astrometric offsets are typically @xmath51   ( table 1 , columns 3 - 4 ) , although contributions to both optical and x - ray flux by lower mass close binary companions may be present . in two cases ,",
    "the optical field shows a visual double where only the brighter component is associated with the coup source .",
    "table 3 gives time - averaged x - ray luminosities selected from tables 4 and 8 of g05 .",
    "column 2 gives the number of extracted counts ( netcts ) from the position - dependent source region , after background - correction .",
    "columns 3@xmath526 give time - averaged luminosities in three bands  @xmath53 in the soft @xmath54 kev band , @xmath55 in the hard @xmath56 kev band , and @xmath57 in the total @xmath2 kev band  and the absorption - corrected intrinsic total band luminosity @xmath58 .",
    "the final column lists notes about each source .",
    "note that the two solar analog stars that were * not * detected by the coup ( from table 11 in g05 ) , jw 252 and jw 407 , are both close to other bright coup sources which raised the local background .",
    "jw 252 has estimated mass of @xmath59 m@xmath30 and an age of @xmath60 myr but lies in the wings of coup222 associated with jw 256 lying 3.8 to the ne .",
    "jw 407 has estimated mass of @xmath61 m@xmath30 and an age of @xmath62 myr but lies 3.4 to the ese of and in the wings of coup520 .",
    "coup520 is not associated with an optical source but is associated with 2mass 05351317 - 0517307 with an offset of @xmath63 .",
    "these stars are probably not qualitatively different from the resolved sources , and will not be further discussed in this paper .    in all but four cases , the optically - derived visual absorptions",
    "@xmath40 agree with the x - ray - derived column densities @xmath64 given the conversion @xmath65 @xmath17 obtained by vuong et al .",
    "coup241 , 314 and 1167 are discrepant in that they exhibit almost no counts below 0.8 kev and thus have high inferred @xmath64 value , inconsistent with the low reported @xmath40 .",
    "coup1539 is discrepant in the other direction possibly due to an unusually soft x - ray flare .",
    "we estimate that about half of the coup - detected solar mass onc stars possess circumstellar disks based on three criteria .",
    "first , three stars have proplyds , disks imaged in silhouette against the bright nebula or imaged in h@xmath66 emission by the @xmath67 @xmath68 @xmath69 .",
    "an additional 13 stars appear to have inner dusty disks producing @xmath47-band excesses @xmath70 over the emission expected from an isolated photosphere .",
    "third , three of these sixteen stars show significant triplet emission , ew()@xmath71 , which is a rough indicator of accretion ( flaccomio et al .",
    "2003 , sicilia - aguilar et al .",
    "the distinguishing aspect of the coup dataset is the unprecedented duration of nearly continuous observation .",
    "this allows a unique perspective of the temporal behavior of the x - ray sources . while flaring is ubiquitous among coronal x - ray sources , the temporal behavior of x - ray sources is complex . separating obvious flares and less obvious periods of variable emission , determining `` quiescent '' flux levels and quantifying the intensities of flaring have all been challenges .",
    "several groups have used different techniques to quantify variability in stellar x - ray sources .",
    "observations of stars by rosat were typically divided into fairly short observation intervals ( obis ) of order 3 ks .",
    "this prevented observation of flares from beginning to end but allowed observers to easily compare count rates among various obis and often define flares as the doubling of flux in one obi as compared to another .",
    "a more rigorous technique commonly used is a one - sample kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) test , but virtually every x - ray source ( star or otherwise ) varies if observed for a sufficient duration and with sufficient sensitivity .",
    "g05 reports that 974 of 1616 x - ray sources in the coup data set were non - constant at a confidence level of greater than 99% .",
    "the solar mass stars discussed here are all non - constant at a confidence of 99% .",
    "there is a plethora of other methods that have been used to determine variability .",
    "these methods include : distribution of binned count rate ( saar & bookbinder 1998 , gdel 2003 ) , n ",
    "@xmath72 deviation from the mean ( stelzer et al .",
    "2000 , wolk et al .  2004 ) , lagrange multipliers ( schwartz 1987 ) , poisson tests ( e.g. , maccacaro et al .  1987 ) , avalanche and cellular automata models ( lu & hamilton 1991 , lu 1995 ) , phase space reconstruction ( vio et al .",
    "1992 ) , ks visualization ( giommi et al .  1995 ) , wavelet analysis ( aschwanden et al .  1998 ; walker et al .",
    "2000 ; many others ) , poissonian structure function ( fernandes et al .",
    "2000 ) , time - frequency analysis ( vio & wamsteker 2002 ) and combined k - s/@xmath73 criteria ( fuhrmeister & schmitt 2003 ) .",
    "we sought a method that is not only independent of data binning but also identifies blocks of data in a specific , not statistical sense .",
    "we have chosen to employ a method to determine periods of constant signal similar to the bayesian block method discussed by scargle ( 1998 ) and used in g05 .",
    "the bayesian block technique segments the lightcurve into a sequence of constant brightness levels under the assumption of poisson errors in the signal .",
    "the change points between levels are established using an iterative maximum likelihood procedure based on bayesian principles .",
    "this method is explicitly designed to avoid binning of the observation into equally spaced time intervals .",
    "bayesian blocks do characterize the x - ray lightcurves remarkably well . as discussed in g05 ,",
    "the overall shape and number of bayesian blocks is fairly insensitive to the choice of confidence level .",
    "we adopt here a procedure very similar to bayesian blocks but without use of bayes theorem .",
    "the sequence of constant brightness levels is established by maximizing likelihoods under the poisson model in the same way , but our thresholds for establishing change points seek to minimize false positives to reduce fragmentation of blocks into many small intervals .",
    "these thresholds were established from extensive simulations of constant lightcurves at different count rates .",
    "we call our procedure , used both here and in other coup studies , maximum likelihood blocks ( mlb ) .",
    "further , we have made an attempt to overcome one of the main limitations of the scargle method  the fact that it segments a light curve in only two segments at a time ( the algorithm is then run recursively on each of the segments found ) .",
    "this is a limitation especially for finding faint impulsive events ( e.g. , flares ) , as a two segment representation in which one segment includes the event might not be statistically significant so that the segmentation process can not start .",
    "for this reason , our code tests both the two- and the three - segment hypotheses . for computational efficiency , only segments with @xmath74 counts are tested for the 3-segment hypothesis .",
    "we found that using one count per average segment occasionally produced too many short blocks .",
    "for analysis in this study , the two parameters of the mlb algorithm were set to require a minimum of 20 counts per block and a 95% probability for establishing change points . for other coup studies ( e.g. , involving much fainter sources )",
    ", other parameters may be chosen .",
    "the median observation in our sample contains 12 such blocks , five being the smallest number of blocks and 31 being the largest .",
    "the existence of multiple blocks tells us that the flux rate from all sources is non - constant at high confidence , but the number of blocks alone does not tell us anything about the type or level of activity detected .",
    "solar and stellar activity is often characterized in terms of `` quiescent '' versus `` flaring '' state . the latter state is sometimes divided into macroscopic distinct events and the superposition of many microflares or nanoflares .",
    "we consider only macroscopic flaring in this study .",
    "although many coup lightcurves exhibit frequent long roughly - constant periods of weaker emission between powerful flares , the term `` quiescent '' ( dictionary definition : `` marked by inactivity '' ) is a misnomer because the absolute activity level is often extremely high ; e.g. , @xmath75 in contrast to -6 for the quiet sun .",
    "we thus chose the term `` characteristic '' level to describe the typical emission between isolated flare events from a coup star .",
    "we term the single flux block of weakest emission as the `` minimum observed level '' ( mole ) .    upon subjective examination ,",
    "the blocks divided themselves into three types : i ) the * characteristic * level and blocks statistically compatible with the characteristic level .",
    "ii ) periods of flux `` elevated '' above the characteristic level with no impulsive morphology .",
    "iii ) periods of * elevated * flux marked by very rapid rises .",
    "we refer to only the third group as `` * flares * ; '' this was the only group exhibiting consistent morphology .",
    "specifically , all the events in group iii showed either `` classic '' flare morphology ( i.e. , a fast rise followed by an exponential decay ) or a symmetric morphology similar to that seen during euve observations of hr 1099 ( osten & brown 1999 )",
    ". we also found it useful to define an intermediate  * very elevated * \" level for unusually strong emission without rapid flux changes .",
    "the classification of x - ray variations from our mlb segmentation of the coup lightcurves is illustrated in figure  [ sample ] for coup567 .",
    "the top panel shows the binned lightcurve overlaid with the 25 mlbs used in our analysis .",
    "characteristic level    we established the characteristic level iteratively , first identifying the set of blocks that maximize the period of time covered by compatible blocks .",
    "a segment is deemed compatible with count rate , @xmath44 , if its count rate , @xmath76 , is between r/1.2 - 1.5@xmath72 and r*1.2 + 1.5@xmath77 here , @xmath72 is the standard deviation of the observed rate about the mean rate in the block . a reference count rate @xmath78 is defined as that rate for which the compatible time reaches a maximum .",
    "then characteristic segments are re  selected to include @xmath79 although there are cases in which it is very difficult , even for the eye , to define a characteristic level , this algorithm gives reasonable results . in the middle panel of figure  [ sample ] there are 11 characteristic mlbs .",
    "elevated level    elevated periods are defined to be slightly elevated and not associated with macroscopic flaring events .",
    "@xmath80    in the middle panel of figure  [ sample ]",
    "there are nine such blocks , only one of which is not associated with a flare .",
    "very elevated level    the remaining blocks are defined as very elevated periods :    @xmath81    these are intense enough that they are often associated with macroscopic flaring events . in figure",
    "[ sample ] , there are five such blocks .",
    "flaring    the key to identifying a flare by eye within a `` very elevated '' period is its rapid flux change .",
    "hence , it is natural to add the derivative of the lightcurve ( dr / dt ) ( or the second derivative of the photon arrival time ) to the criteria .",
    "the difference between successive block rates can easily be chosen as dr , but defining dt requires careful thought . a simple definition of dt as the interval between the mid - time of consecutive blocks would dilute truly rapid rises , especially when observation gaps exist .",
    "we instead choose dt as the shorter of the exposure times in two successive blocks . to prevent a dependence on rate , dr / dt",
    "is scaled by the inverse of @xmath82 . by plotting @xmath83 and the lightcurve simultaneously we empirically determined a threshold of @xmath84 s@xmath4 to be indicative of a flare .",
    "a flare is defined as a successive series of elevated blocks which include at least one very elevated block and one period in which @xmath85 in the bottom panel of figure  [ sample ] , we plot 24 values of : @xmath86    ten of these exceed our threshold , and seven are associated with very elevated levels .",
    "grouping the consecutive occurrences , we find three flares .",
    "the blue lines in the third panel of figure  [ sample ] and the similar panels of figure  3 identify the full durations of the flares .",
    "a weakness of this set of definitions is the rather stringent requirement of flare strength",
    ". only intervals for which the stellar luminosity rises by more than a factor @xmath87 above 120% of the characteristic level are definable as flares . in practice ,",
    "the smallest luminosity change associated with a flare is a luminosity change of a factor of three .",
    "flares moderately weaker than this are relegated to the `` elevated '' category .",
    "any activity that increases the overall flux by less than @xmath88 50% is completely ignored and accounted for in the characteristic data .",
    "the levels chosen for our definitions are admittedly subjective  especially the factors 1.2 and 2.5@xmath72 that enter in the definition of elevated vs. characteristic levels and the setting of the flare level @xmath89 at @xmath84 s@xmath4 .",
    "these definitions are tuned to match what we intuitively agree are significant flares .",
    "some probable flares are missed , such as the second very elevated period for coup1134 .",
    "some marginal events are also counted such as flares , e.g. , the final three flares on coup314 , where a low characteristic rate serves to exaggerate the rate of change . in testing several variations on these numbers to arrive at our final criteria",
    ", we found that some weaker flares are lost and others are found .",
    "based on this experimentation , we estimate that the total number of flares is reliable at the @xmath90% level with respect to variations in the criteria of equations ( 1)(4 ) .",
    "figure  [ lc14 ] , shows the lightcurves for the 28 solar mass sources in the onc .",
    "the lightcurves are presented as histograms with blocks of constant flux overlaid .",
    "a new block is used when maximum likelihood statistics indicate 95% confidence that the data are not consistent with a constant signal . the lower plot in each panel indicates @xmath83 between each pair of blocks .",
    "flares are indicated with lines above the lightcurves .",
    "much of the analysis of pre - main sequence flaring in this study will be based on spectral modeling of the coup source spectra in terms of optically - thin plasmas in collisional equilibrium . from this modeling",
    "we extract plasma temperatures , instantaneous luminosities and time - integrated energy output in the @xmath0 @xmath2 kev band .",
    "we assume elemental abundances follow the cosmic abundance pattern with 0.3 times the solar abundance .",
    "this may be a poor assumption as abundance anomalies and temporal variations have been seen in other magnetically active stars ( e.g. , favata & schmitt 1999 , brinkman et al .",
    "2001 ) and are present in some coup sources ( g05 ) .",
    "abundance effects will be treated in a later coup study , but their omission here should have little effect on our determinations of broad - band luminosities and energies .",
    "we employ the usual corrections as discussed in g05 to fit the spectra of the photons which arrived during characteristic periods to a two - temperature mekal plasma .",
    "mekal was used as a convention by the coup team .",
    "we found that if is left as a free parameter , there is a strong correlation between luminosity and ( luminosity increasing with increasing ) .",
    "this is due to a natural degeneracy in the problem : one can arrive at a uniformly good fit by increasing and the high temperature flux in parallel .",
    "for this reason , was frozen at @xmath91 .",
    "an exception was made when the fit was formally poor ; when @xmath92 , we allowed to become a free parameter .",
    "once the characteristic spectra are determined , we proceed with the remaining spectral analysis of each star .",
    "all photons that arrive during elevated periods are combined into a composite elevated spectrum for each star .",
    "photons that arrive during flare periods are separated to create spectra for each flare . except where noted , each of these @xmath88 70 spectra is fit by a one or two - temperature mekal plasma with and metallicity frozen to the characteristic values .",
    "we show an example of this fitting process for coup262 in figure  [ sampleq ] . in practice , four stars needed to become a free parameter regardless of whether characteristic , elevated or flare data were being fit . this could be due to high local extinction , to unusually high coronal temperatures , to a broad range of coronal temperatures or to poor extinction estimates .",
    "data for these stars should be treated cautiously . in addition , no spectral fits were performed for coup828 in flare because its proximity to a chip gap confused our flare detection algorithm .",

    "our definition is about a factor 10 times more conservative than that of fgp02 .",
    "we have instead termed these @xmath88 300 `` missing '' flares as  elevated \" level intervals ; this activity is not `` missed '' , it is merely accounted differently . since we are concerned with the effect on the protoplanetary disks , the relevant quantities are the duration , luminosity and temperature of x - rays during elevated periods .",

    "this is consistent with the definition that the flux is between 1.5 and 2.5 @xmath72 above the characteristic level , and luminosity changes are similarly limited to be between 1.6 and 2.6 times the characteristic luminosity .",
    "there is evidence that the periods of elevated flux are indeed associated with microflaring as the median temperature of the hot component of the corona goes up by 25% during these periods - from a median of 2.34 kev ( mad = 0.7 ) to a median of 2.93 kev ( mad = 0.7 ) - while the cool component stays constant .",

    "the luminosities and temperatures represent averages of each flare whereas the energy gives the total released in the event .",
    "the median @xmath97 was about 30.81 ergs s@xmath4 with the median temperature of the hot coronae of about 3.45  kev .",
    "the cool corona remained near 800  ev . the ratios of flare to characteristic luminosities , plotted in figure  [ ratio ] , show that most flare amplitudes are not extremely high .",
    "the median flare level is 3.5 times the characteristic level , and 90% of flares rise to less than 10 times the characteristic level .",
    "the luminosities of the peak blocks are another measure of flare intensity .",
    "table  [ tbl - brightest ] lists the spectral fits to just the peak of each flare ( if there were enough photons to yield a reliable fit ) .",
    "as can be inferred from figure  [ lum_hist ] , the peak flare luminosities are about 0.25 dex higher than the integrated flare luminosities ( median @xmath109 = -2.77 ) .",
    "this method of calculation has little effect on the relative strength deduced for each flare , the median ratio of the peak to characteristic luminosity is 6 .",
    "the largest change was observed during the second flare of coup1259 , when the ratio of the peak to characteristic luminosity soared to 80 .",
    "the median peak @xmath97 , was about 30.97 ergs s@xmath4 , while the median duration of peak blocks is about 10  ks .",
    "more importantly , the median plasma temperature was about 7 kev during the peak of each flare !",
    "the most luminous period is also likely the hottest portion of the flare and is therefore the most capable of affecting circumstellar material .",
    "there are no strong trends of the duration of flares relating to the luminosity .",

    "having determined the duration and the luminosity of each flare we can now discuss the energy released during each event . multiplying the full duration of each flare by its luminosity ( columns 3 and 11 of table  [ tbl - flares ] ) we calculated the total energy released during the event ( column 12 ) :",

    "the overall lightcurves are not consistent with all the x",
    " rays being produced by a single power law extending down to zero counts .",
    "the overall appearance of the lightcurves is a relatively constant characteristic level with sudden big flares .",
    "inspection does not show obvious low frequency signal which would be expected due to the superposition of intermediate and low - intensity flares as implied by a power law .    to demonstrate this in a qualitative manner with a simple simulation .",
    "we created a simulated 13.2 day lightcurve with a `` toy '' template flare ( rapid rise , 10-hr exponential decay and a distribution following a power law .",
    "the main free parameter was dn / dc , where c is the number of counts in a flare ( modeling the energy is beyond the scope of this study ) .",
    "simulations were performed with @xmath124 , @xmath125 , @xmath126 and @xmath127 , and created lightcurves by the superposition of flares . to compare results for high and low count rate sources ,",
    "the number of flares was varied from 100 to 4400 . for each power law index 100",
    "simulations were run at each flare quantity .",
    "some examples of our 43,000 simulations are shown in figure [ sims ] . by inspection",
    ", it appears that if all of the x - rays are produced by flaring and if the flares follow a single power law , values of the power law index of -1.7 would create more flares than are seen in our data .",
    "similarly , the power law index of -3 produces too few flares .",
    "if the sole source of the x - rays were flaring drawn on a single power law , the index would have to about -2.25 , which is too steep to describe the brightest flares .",
    "thus , either flare energies are better represented by a broken power law , or by a single power law overlying an x - ray continuum .",

    "scale flaring with @xmath66 values between 2.0 and 2.5 .",
    "a full quantitative comparison with the whole coup dataset is beyond the scope of this paper and would require more extensive work over a broad range of masses .",
    "the total energy release in each flare is nearly linearly correlated with the luminosity .",
    "the best fit to a linear regression is @xmath128 the mad of the fit is 0.38 dex and the rank correlation is correspondingly strong ( @xmath129 ) .",
    "since energy and luminosity are linearly related energy = luminosity @xmath130 duration , it follows that the duration is essentially independent of the luminosity of the event .",
    "as far as can be determined from this sample moreover , the energy and luminosity of flares are independent of age .",
    "we found 41 large flares during an average effective exposure time of 660 ks on 27 observed solar mass stars ( coup828 was excluded from flare searches because of its proximity to a chip gap ) .",
    "thus , we compute a preliminary average of 1 flare per star per @xmath88 435 ks of observing time . the true rate of flares is somewhat lower than this ; however , because the effective exposure time on some sources was limited due to dither and off  axis effects . while such effects lower the total number of counts observed , the overall sensitivity to flares is not compromised because all flares observed exceed the duration of the dither cycle .",
    "we argue that we are sensitive to flares that occurred on any of the 27 stars during the full 850ks observation .",
    "further , flares which occurred when the onc was not being observed would still have been detected as such if the flare lasted into the next observing window .",
    "although we can not detect any flares that take place entirely during perigee passage by @xmath0 , we do detect flares that begin during the perigee passage and extend to about 8 hours after perigee , when new observations start . since the median flare duration is about the same length as perigee passage , we miss about half of the flares that begin during perigee .",
    "the time between observations is about 57  ks , and there were five perigee passages during the observations , so we were sensitive to one half of the flares occurring during about 288 kiloseconds of perigee passages . applying these corrections ,",
    "we infer an average of 1 flare per star per 650 ks .",
    "this is consistent with earlier results for orion and much older clusters as reported by wolk et al .",
    "however the flare definitions used were less quantitative than those used here and biases in the data are unclear .",
    "specifically , wolk et al .  (",
    "2004 ) were more sensitive to faint flares that would be considered elevated in the current work .",
    "nonetheless , it appears that flare rates change by a factor less than 5 during the first 100 myrs .",
    "two stars , coup1023 and 1281 , show no evidence of flaring .",
    "coup241 , 1167 and 1159 only showed flaring in the extremely early or late observation intervals .",
    "eleven stars underwent two flares , one star was observed to have three , and another exhibited four . _ a priori _ we did not consider the quiet nature of coup 1023 and 1281 , or the active nature of coup 314 and 567 , anything more than statistical fluctuation in a random distribution of flares . on the sun however ,",
    "the observed power - law distribution of flare energy release is well characterized by the assumption that the solar corona is critically self - organized ( lu & hamilton 1991 ) .",
    "a result of this organization is a waiting time distribution ( lu et al .",
    "1993 ) between flares that is power law in nature with a slope of @xmath131 where the index @xmath132 is about 2.15 - 2.55 ( wheatland 2000 , norman et al .",
    "2001 ) .    to test",
    "whether stars in the sample were subject to a nonrandom waiting time , we assumed that all stars in the sample have the same behavior ( and thus that observing 27 of them for 850 ks is equivalent to observing one of them for 24 ms  the ergodic theorem ) .",
    "the distribution was simulated using a simple monte carlo model for the distribution of flares among the 27 stars . for each star ,",
    "the lightcurve was divided into 39 25  ks bins , assigned a random number to each bin , if the random number exceeded a threshold , we noted this as a flare .",
    "we set the threshold to trigger once per 625 ks ( 25 bins ) on average .",
    "one thousand datasets of 27 stars were simulated , each with about 41 flares in each dataset .",
    "the results of the simulation are shown in figure  [ monte ] .",
    "not surprisingly , the result is a poisson distribution centered between 1 and 2 flares per star with a few extra sources in the zero flare bin since it is impossible to have negative flares .",
    "a two - sided ks test fails to discriminate the ergodic model from other models ( probability that the data fit the ergodic hypothesis was 44% ) .",
    "thus , at the level of our data , there is no indication that the temporal distribution of flaring is anything other than random .      in our initial qualitative analysis of the bright flares in the dataset",
    ", we categorized flares by luminosity , duration and shape .",
    "specifically , the shape was noted as either , `` linear rise plus exponential decay '' , `` symmetric '' or `` spike '' ( i.e. , less than 5ks from beginning to end ) .",
    "there were also a handful of flares which were too weak to describe .",
    "eight flares were noted as symmetric .",
    "the first flare of coup1259 is probably the best example of a slow - rise roughly symmetrical flare . in two sources , coup131 and 1570",
    ", multiple symmetric events may be indicative of rotational modulation of long - lived structures in the stellar corona , rather than individual magnetic reconnection events ( these are detailed by flaccomio et al .",
    "three of the remaining five symmetric events are too short - lived to be rotational events ( durations @xmath491 d ) and are not seen to repeat .",
    "the temperature profile of the flares is critical to understanding their ability to penetrate circumstellar material .",
    "harder x - rays penetrate more material and can heat deeper into disks midplanes .",
    "a fundamental question is whether or not the flare plasmas of these t tauri stars share properties known in flare plasmas of older stars , including : l@xmath133 kt@xmath134 ( preibisch 1997 ) , l@xmath133 kt@xmath135 ( gedel et al . 1997 ) and kt@xmath136 is always around 0.8 kev ( sanz - forcada et al .",
    "2003 ) where t@xmath136 and t@xmath137 are the cooler and hotter plasma components , respectively .",
    "we have fit most of the x - ray sources as two temperature mekal models .",
    "we find a significant correlation between the hot and cool components of the characteristic x - ray emission as shown in figure  [ kt1kt2 ] .",
    "a similar effect was seen in rosat data albeit with a different instrument and for different stars ( cf .",
    "stern et al .",
    "1994 , gagn  et al .  1995 and figure  24 of favata & micela 2003 ) .",
    "the effect has also been noted in the time - integrated spectra of coup stars ( preibisch et al .",
    "2005a ) .",
    "at the characteristic levels , the soft component is weakly correlated with the characteristic luminosity ( correlation coefficients indicate @xmath63 probability of no correlation ) and the harder component shows no correlation whatsoever ( @xmath138 ) .",
    "however , the characteristic hot and cool coronal components are highly correlated : a linear regression fit gives @xmath139 kev , with a median deviation of 0.5kev about the fit .",
    "a key difference between this data set and the rosat results mentioned above is the hard sensitivity and corresponding lack of soft x - ray sensitivity of the chandra acis - i .",
    "thus , it is not surprising that we find a hard component median of about 2.3  kev and a median soft component around 0.9  kev , both much warmer than found with rosat .",
    "the temperature correlation breaks down during the elevated and flare periods ( @xmath140 for both flare and elevated periods ) .",
    "it is clear that the temperature of the hot component of the plasma increases as a star s flux level changes from the characteristic level to the flaring state ; the hot plasma achieves maximum heating when the star is at peak flux levels .",
    "the cool components do not change significantly .",
    "this evidence suggests that the breakdown in the correlation occurs because the flare is only manifest in the hot corona .",
    "the median of the hot component increases by over 50% to 3.45 kev during flares , and five flares exceeded temperatures of 100  mk ( 9  kev ) in their hot component .",
    "favata et al .",
    "( 2005 ) examined the brightest flares in the coup sample and found 100mk temperatures in half of the events .",
    "this is supporting evidence for a l@xmath141kt@xmath137 relationship .",
    "further , it implies that hotter flares than those witnessed during this 13.2 day observation probably occur on these stars . the cool component shift ( formally from 670 ev to 760 ev )",
    "is consistent with a constant kt@xmath136 as found by by sanz - forcada et al .",

    "we have reasonable disk and flare data on 26 of the 28 stars in the sample but lack @xmath48 measurements for two stars ( table  2 ) .",

    "the group of stars with passive accretion disks include the two obvious rotators : the star with four flares and another star with no flares .",
    "the subgroup without evidence of any disk also contained one star without flares and its remaining stars had one or two modest flares .",

    "nearby stars may contribute , but close to any given star , the x - ray emission from that star ( and any companion ) will dominate .",

    "although a fair fraction have disks and are still accreting , most of the stellar mass has already been accreted , following an earlier more active stage of accretion that probably occurred during the first several hundred thousand years of their lives .",
    "it is very likely that the nuclear irradiation that led to some , if not many , of the short - lived radionuclides occurred during this early period and not in the t tauri phase .",
    "we note that the meteoritic evidence for high energy processes that we attribute to x - ray flares takes place over an extended and complex period .",
    "cais are irradiated and melted during a brief ( @xmath160 yr ) protostellar phase , chondrules are melted over a somewhat longer phase ( @xmath29 yr ) , while grains showing spallogenic @xmath161ne excesses are irradiated over @xmath162 years .",
    "although the sample of young solar analogs studied here was selected to be unobscured @xmath163 year old stars , we note that both the younger coup stars embedded in the omc-1 cloud cores ( grosso et al .",
    "2005 ) and older coup stars ( @xmath164 yr ; preibisch & feigelson 2005 ) exhibit very similar x - ray luminosity functions and flaring behavior as the sample examined here .",
    "it is perhaps uncertain only whether or not x - ray emission extends to the very youngest class 0 protostars .",
    "we have examined a sample of 28 solar  mass stars observed by @xmath0 during a very deep observation and have quantified the lightcurves of the x - ray sources using maximum likelihood analysis . taking advantage of the extremely long and nearly continuous nature of the observation we applied quantifiable definitions to the lightcurves to identify characteristic levels , flares and intermediate states for 27 of these sources .",
    "principle among our findings is that young solar analogs spend about three - fourths of their time in a relatively well behaved characteristic state .",
    "this state can be well modeled as a 2temperature plasma with one component fixed near 850 ev and the other component of about 2.35 kev .",
    "this characteristic state is marked by good correlations among their coronal temperatures and bolometric to x - ray luminosities , but these relationships break down in the more active states .",
    "while the flares are well fit by @xmath7 , a power law index of @xmath88 -2.25 is required to match the shape of the overall lightcurves if they are purely the result of flaring .",
    "this broken power law is consistent with recent observation of rs cvn stars ( for bright flares ) and ad leo ( for fainter flares ) and indicates that the characteristic portion of the luminosity does not arise from flares ( or at least not the same kind of flares that give rise to the luminosity in the flaring state ) .",
    "the emission of the stable component represents about 0.03% of the bolometric luminosity .      1 .",
    "the median flare has a luminosity of about 10@xmath165 and releases about 10@xmath110 ergs with kt@xmath166kev .",
    "the peak luminosity of flares is almost 10@xmath167 and lasts about 10ks . during the peak of the flare kt@xmath168",
    "has a median of about 7  kev .",
    "2 .   the ratio of the flare peak to characteristic flux is less than a factor of 100 .",
    "flares induce a large change in the temperature of the hot coronal plasma component .",
    "we find no relation between luminosity and duration , nor do we see significant trends of luminosity with age .",
    "there is no statistical evidence that flares are subject to a waiting time between flares .",
    "the time between events can be modeled as a random occurrence .",
    "the duration of the flares themselves varied from less than an hour to almost three days .",
    "the cool component of the corona is unaffected by activity , with the median value of kt@xmath169 remaining between 710 and 900 ev in all states .",
    "the intensity and hard spectra found for onc solar analogs indicate that the resulting ionization of disk gases by stellar x - rays dominates ionization by cosmic rays or other sources by a large factor .",
    "if solar - type particle production is associated with thermal flares , the observed flaring rate inferred for the early sun is sufficient to produce many of the isotopic anomalies seen in meteoritic inclusions .",
    "x - rays do not account for all anomalies seen in meteoritic inclusions or protosolar analogs .",
    "although x - ray heating of gas above the midplane is significant and rotation ",
    "vibration transition of co should be easily excited . but",
    "this does not occur at rates significant enough to explain recent observations of very strong co signature in some t tauri stars .",

    "<S> in january 2003 , the @xmath0 orion ultradeep project ( coup ) detected about 1400 young stars during a 13.2 day observation of the orion nebula cluster ( onc ) . </S>",
    "<S> this paper is a study of the x - ray properties of a well - defined sample of 28 solar - mass onc stars based on coup data . </S>",
    "<S> our goals are to characterize the magnetic activity of analogs of the young sun and thereby to improve understanding of the effects of solar x - rays on the solar nebula during the era of planet formation . given the length of the coup observation we are able to clearly distinguish characteristic and flare periods for all stars . </S>",
    "<S> we find that active young suns spend 70% of their time in a characteristic state with relatively constant flux and magnetically confined plasma with temperatures @xmath1 . during characteristic periods , </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath2 kev x - ray luminosity is about 0.03% of the bolometric luminosity . </S>",
    "<S> one or two powerful flares per week with peak luminosities @xmath3 ergs s@xmath4 are typically superposed on this characteristic emission accompanied by heating of the hot plasma component from @xmath5 kev to @xmath6 kev at the flare peak . </S>",
    "<S> the energy distribution of flares superposed on the characteristic emission level follows the relationship @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> the flare rates are consistent with the production of sufficiently energetic protons to spawn a spallogenic origin of some important short - lived radionuclides found in ancient meteorites . </S>",
    "<S> the x - rays can ionize gas in the circumstellar disk at a rate of @xmath8 ionizations per second at 1 au from the central star , orders of magnitude above cosmic ray ionization rates . </S>",
    "<S> the estimated energetic particle fluences are sufficient to account for many isotopic anomalies observed in meteoritic inclusions . </S>"
