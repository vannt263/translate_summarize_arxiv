    "by the end of the fifties it was clear that meson - meson scattering plays an important part in the understanding of the forces between baryons . for energies below the two - kaon threshold",
    "it is sufficient to take into account the interactions between pions . at higher energies , heavier degrees of freedom ( kaon , eta , rho  )",
    "become relevant .",
    "pion - kaon scattering  with a threshold at about @xmath2 mev  constitutes the simplest mesonic system with unequal mass kinematics and carrying strangeness . for reviews of theoretical and experimental knowledge in the meson sector up to the late seventies",
    "see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .    in the late seventies and early eighties",
    ", it was discovered that the low - energy structure of green s functions of qcd can be determined systematically @xcite .",
    "the method  called chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath3 )  is based on a simultaneous expansion of green s functions in powers of external momenta and light quark masses , the latter taking into account the breaking of the @xmath4 ( n flavour ) symmetry of the strong interactions . in the context of @xmath5 the expansion parameters @xmath6 and @xmath7 are of the same chiral order despite the fact that the pion mass @xmath8 is about three times smaller than the kaon mass @xmath9 .",
    "chiral @xmath1 perturbation theory was applied to pion - kaon scattering in @xcite . in these references",
    "the results for scattering lengths and other threshold parameters are given only numerically . in 1987",
    "@xmath3 was extended to include nucleons , particles whose masses are non - zero in the chiral limit ( of vanishing quark masses ) @xcite .",
    "interactions of these heavy degrees of freedom with pseudo - goldstone bosons are not constrained by the full chiral group @xmath10 but only by the diagonal subgroup @xmath11 .",
    "there are therefore more unknown low - energy constants than there would be in the case of ` goldstones ' only .    in recent years",
    ", several attempts have been made to extend the range of application of the @xmath5 scattering amplitude to higher energies .",
    "in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite this is achieved by using unitarisation methods and dispersion relations .",
    "another possibility of partially including higher - order corrections is to take resonances into account explicitly @xcite .",
    "an s - matrix parametrisation that conforms with unitarity @xcite was applied to the data of two experiments on kaon - nucleon scattering @xcite performed at slac in the seventies and eighties respectively .",
    "the authors find evidence for the existence of an @xmath12-wave resonance @xmath13 , which constitutes an improvement in the understanding of @xmath14@xmath15 partial waves . the light scalar mesons and their possible classifications are of much current interest ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "the purpose of the present article is to calculate the pion - kaon scattering amplitude in the context of @xmath16 perturbation theory , where the strange quark mass is fixed by definition , to fouth chiral order and to find relations between threshold parameters where as much low - energy constants as possible cancel .",
    "an advantage of this approach is that the biggest expansion parameter ( near the threshold ) is now @xmath17 so that the chiral expansion is expected to converge more rapidly than in the @xmath5 theory .",
    "however , analogously to baryon @xmath3 , the number of low - energy constants increases .    in section [ symm.sec ] the chiral symmetry of the strong interactions is briefly reviewed .",
    "the role of closed kaon loops is discribed in section [ kta ] .",
    "the transformation laws of the meson fields are given in section [ efff ] and the general effective lagrangian is constructed in section [ efflag ] .",
    "section [ masses.sec ] is devoted to the chiral expansion of observables which can be extracted from the two point functions ( pion and kaon masses , pion decay constant ) . in sections",
    "[ methods.sec ] and [ scatter ] , we construct the isospin @xmath18 amplitude to fourth chiral order as a function of the low - energy constants .",
    "section [ counting ] concerns the matching of the @xmath16 with the @xmath5 amplitude and provides an expansion of the @xmath16 coupling constants in powers of the strange quark mass .",
    "low - energy theorems are given in section [ let ] and section [ summary ] contains the conclusions .",
    "in the limit of vanishing light - quark masses ( @xmath19 ) the lagrangian of qcd , @xmath20 is invariant under global chiral transformations .",
    "the @xmath21 colour matrix @xmath22 denotes the gluon field with associated field strength @xmath23 , and @xmath24 is the quark - mass matrix in flavour space .",
    "the action on the chiral up- and down - quarks , @xmath25 is defined by @xmath26 the gluon field and the heavy quarks @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are not transformed under the chiral group .",
    "therefore , these degrees of freedom are suppressed in the following .",
    "the vacuum of qcd is only assumed to be invariant under the isospin subgroup @xmath11 of @xmath31 . according to goldstone s theorem @xcite",
    "this implies the ocurrence of an internal @xmath32-dimensional subspace degenerate with the vacuum , the goldstone bosons . here",
    "@xmath33 and @xmath34 denote the number of parameters in the lie groups @xmath31 and @xmath35 respectively ( in our case @xmath36 and @xmath37 ) .",
    "the green s functions of the conserved currents as well as the scalar and pseudoscalar densities are generated by the vacuum - to - vacuum amplitude @xmath38 based on the lagrangian @xmath39 the external fields @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath12 and @xmath42 are hermitian colour - neutral matrices in flavour space , @xmath40 and @xmath41 being traceless .",
    "the lagrangian ( [ qcd2 ] ) is now invariant under _ local _ chiral transformations provided the sources transform as @xmath43 matrix elements of vector and axial vector currents @xmath44 can be obtained by deriving the generating functional @xmath45 with respect to @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are defined by @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "the role of closed nucleon loops is analysed in the context of baryon @xmath51 in @xcite .",
    "the situation is analogue in the case of kaons instead of nucleons .",
    "the general effective lagrangian describing the process @xmath52 is given by a chirally symmetric string of terms @xmath53 the term @xmath54 does not contain the kaon field @xmath15 whereas @xmath55 , @xmath56  stand for local lagrangians which are bilinear , quadrilinear ,  in the kaon field .",
    "the bilinear term can be written in the form @xmath57 where @xmath58 denotes a @xmath59 matrix - differential operator which contains only the pion fields @xmath60 and the external sources @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath12 and @xmath42 .",
    "the explicit form of @xmath58 is given in section [ lagdens4.sub ] .",
    "for brevity the fields @xmath12 , @xmath42 and @xmath62 are dropped in the following . with an additional source @xmath63 for the kaon field , @xmath64 and the vacuum transition amplitude",
    "is given by @xmath65 in the effective theory with pions only n - loop contributions are suppressed by a factor of @xmath66 @xcite . in the presence of heavy particles",
    "the situation is more complicated .",
    "first , there are closed kaon loops which are not suppressed .",
    "these loop contributions are real below the two - kaon threshold and , in a regularisation scheme which respects chiral symmetry , can be taken into account by a redefinition of fields and low - energy constants .",
    "this is always possible because  by construction ",
    "the general chiral lagrangian @xmath67 contains all chirally invariant structures .",
    "in particular , as we are only interested in processes with one incoming and one outgoing kaon , vertices with more than two kaon legs can be dropped .",
    "in other words , we only consider feynman diagrams with a single uninterrupted kaon line going through the diagram .",
    "the integration over the kaon fields can therefore be performed symbolically , @xmath68 if the low - energy constants are adjusted accordingly . here",
    "@xmath69 denotes the kaon propagator in the presence of pion and external fields , @xmath70 the above argument can be used again to justify the replacement of the determinant by @xmath71 .",
    "it s only after this step that the low - energy constants contained in @xmath54 are rigorously the same as the ones in the original article by gasser and leutwyler @xcite .    secondly , there are still unsuppressed loop contributions , arising from an internal kaon line , if the loop integrals are evaluated in the standard relativistic way . in the pion - nucleon case",
    "there are at least three different methods for evaluating such loop integrals in order to obtain the scattering amplitude to third chiral order .",
    "these methods , whose relationship has only been clarified recently @xcite , will be described in section [ methods.sec ] .",
    "to model the dynamics of the pion - kaon system by an effective field theory , the action of the chiral group @xmath31 has to be chosen in such a way as to represent correctly the low - energy structure of qcd .",
    "the fact that the isospin subgroup leaves the vacuum invariant ( in the chiral limit ) means that @xmath35 must be the stability group ( isotropy group ) of each orbit of the carrier space @xmath72 containing the pions .",
    "this fact already implies that each orbit of @xmath72 must be homeomorphic to the coset space @xmath73 which is itself isomorphic to @xmath74 ( the three - dimensional sphere ) and also to @xmath0 .",
    "it is convenient to select one representative element out of each equivalence class of @xmath73 defined by @xmath75 .",
    "this choice is unambiguous near the neutral element of @xmath0 .",
    "the action of @xmath76 on @xmath77 is then : @xmath78 where the compensatory field @xmath79 has to be chosen in such a way that @xmath80 is the representative element of the class containing @xmath81 , i.e. so that @xmath82 . because kaons have isospin @xmath83 , this compensator can also be used to define the action of @xmath31 on the kaon fields @xmath84 : @xmath85 \\rightarrow \\left[(v_{{{\\mbox{\\tiny\\hspace{-0.4mm}$r$ } } } } u_{{{\\mbox{\\tiny\\hspace{-0.4mm}$r$ } } } } h^+,v_{{{\\mbox{\\tiny\\hspace{-0.4mm}$l$}}}}u_{{{\\mbox{\\tiny\\hspace{-0.4mm}$l$}}}}h^+);hk\\right],\\ ] ] so that in our case @xmath86 the compensator @xmath87 does not depend on @xmath88 if the action is restricted to @xmath35 i.e. if @xmath89 .",

    "this can not be due to the fact that the authors of @xcite use older values for the @xmath5 constants , since the effect of this would be too small . in the @xmath5 case ,",
    "our calculation of the @xmath101 amplitude coincides exactly with the one in @xcite .",
