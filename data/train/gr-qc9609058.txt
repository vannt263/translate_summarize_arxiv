    "the extended series of measurements on the orbital decay of the binary pulsar have made it clear that angular momentum is radiating away from this system in agreement with the original predictions of einstein .",
    "but , the larger goal of direct detection of the waves and the development of such detection into gravitational wave astronomy still remains .",
    "direct detection of gravitational radiation is a challenging experimental and technological problem .",
    "the current state of gravitational wave experimentation will allow detectors to record any predicted event that occurs within our galaxy and the technology is at hand to allow experimentalists to record events from remote galaxies .",
    "we report here on the data acquisition and analysis procedures used for the allegro gravity wave detector , including the design of the optimal filter for burst signals and quantifying the uncertainties in estimating arrival times and signal strengths .",
    "allegro is located in the physics building at louisiana state university in baton rouge , louisiana ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "it consists of a resonant bar equipped with a resonant inductive transducer and a dc squid amplifier all cooled to 4.2 k. it was operational from june 1991 until january of 1995 with a duty cycle approaching 95% and an average noise temperature ( defined in sec .",
    "[ sec : datanaly ] ) less than 6 mk . figure  [ crossec ] shows a schematic of the antenna .",
    "the allegro detector was designed to look for pulses of gravity waves such as those from the collapse of a massive star .",
    "theoretical models ( although varying widely in waveform and strength estimates ) predict that stellar collapse to a neutron star or black hole would produce a burst of gravitational radiation with a duration on the order of milliseconds at frequencies near 1 khz . for a resonant mass detector , a passing gravity wave deposits momentum into a massive elastic body , changing the amplitude and phase of the existing vibrational normal mode motion .",
    "the elastic body in the allegro detector is a cylinder of aluminum alloy 5056 , 60 cm in diameter and 300 cm in length .",
    "it has a physical mass of 2296 kg .",
    "its first longitudinal normal mode is at 913 hz .",
    "all cylinder detectors are most sensitive to signals propagating in a direction perpendicular to the bar axis .",
    "the bar is oriented perpendicular to the plane of the great circle on the earth that passes through geneva , the location of the rome explorer antenna , and midway between baton rouge , la and stanford , ca .",
    "this orientation results in the axis of allegro being directed along a line @xmath1 west of north .",
    "the explorer detector of the university of rome is perpendicular to the same great circle and as a result is parallel to allegro .",
    "this means that a gravity wave should deposit the same amount of momentum into each of the detectors .",
    "attached to one end of the bar is a smaller `` mushroom '' resonator resonant at the same frequency as the bar , thus making a two - mode system of coupled oscillators ( referred to as the `` antenna '' )  @xcite .",
    "the mass of the resonator is small enough so that the effects of a passing gravity wave on it are ignored . facing the mushroom resonator but attached firmly to the bar",
    "is a superconducting pick - up coil with a persistent supercurrent .",
    "the distance between the coil and the resonator is therefore proportional to the distance between the bar and resonator .",
    "oscillations of the mushroom resonator change the inductance of the pick - up coil , modulating the flux through it .",
    "a dc squid converts the changing flux to a voltage .",
    "an off - resonant capacitive transducer , the calibrator , is attached to the bar at the opposite end from the inductive transducer .",
    "voltages applied to the capacitor applied forces to the antenna , which we used for a number of tasks .",
    "the calibrator was used to actively dampen the mode q s to shorten the recovery time after large excitations and to cancel positive feedback on the antenna produced by the squid  @xcite . under normal operating conditions",
    "the calibrator was used to excite the antenna at a frequency of 865.00 hz , far removed from either of the modes .",
    "this `` continuous systems test '' provides a powerful tool for checking on the health of the detector .",
    "the calibrator was also used to provide burst signals to the antenna allowing the detector to be calibrated and allowing a study of the effects of noise on signal detection to be made .",
    "the allegro detector model is illustrated schematically in fig .",
    "[ modl ] , where we include all of the relevant stationary noise sources .",
    "the equations of motion for this model are :    @xmath2    @xmath3    @xmath4 are the effective masses of the bar and mushroom resonator .",
    "@xmath5 is the effective length of the bar .",
    "@xmath6 represent the spring constants of the bar and mushroom resonator , @xmath7 their respective damping coefficients .",
    "@xmath8 are the langevin force noise generators associated with the dissipation coefficients of each mass and @xmath9 is the noise generated by a changing magnetic pressure from the superconducting pick - up coil on the small mass resonator .",
    "@xmath10 is the amplitude of the first longitudinal normal mode of the bar , while @xmath11 is the relative displacement between the bar and the second resonator .",
    "the last term on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ force ] ) is the component of the gravitational wave tidal force along the bar axis .",
    "the model shown does not explicitly include the superconducting circuitry or the squid .",
    "the voltage out of the squid is proportional to the relative displacement of the two masses : @xmath12 where g is a gain factor and @xmath13 is white noise from the squid .",
    "the time response of the antenna to a large burst signal provided by the calibrator is shown in fig .",
    "[ signl ] .",
    "the power spectrum of the stationary noise out of the squid is shown in fig .",
    "[ resp](a ) .",
    "the two resonant modes , seen clearly in the figure , are at 896.8 hz and 920.3 hz .",
    "we refer to them as the minus and plus modes respectively .",
    "figure  [ resp](b ) shows the antenna response to a large burst signal and ( c ) shows the ratio of the noise to signal which is the stationary noise treated as if it were due to a random flux of gravity waves exciting the bar .",
    "the voltage from the squid electronics is sent to a single lockin detector which demodulates and low pass filters the signal .",
    "the reference frequency of the lockin is set halfway between the normal mode frequencies of the antenna , thus shifting the frequency of the signal from the normal modes of the antenna to low frequency . because the lockin is set for a wide bandwidth , the frequency response of the detector over its entire bandwidth is monitored , enabling us to measure both the amplitude and phase of each of the resonant normal modes .",
    "it is due to the wide bandwidth that the continuous systems test can be applied to the antenna at a frequency far enough removed from the resonant modes as to not interfere with them .",
    "other data collected to help monitor the detector includes a direct low frequency signal from the squid , the status of the hardware and squid vetos and signals from two seismometers , one of which is located on the floor next to the dewar containing the antenna , the other on top of the vibration isolation table .",

    "the lockin is an eg`&`g par 5210 two phase lockin amplifier with reference frequency set at 908.5220 hz , although this changes if the mode frequencies shift by a couple of mhz .",
    "the reference signal is provided to the lockin by a hewlett packard 3325a function generator equipped with a high stability oscillator . after the lockin , the in - phase and",
    "quadrature output voltages are sent through an anti - aliasing filter ( cutoff frequency 40 hz ) and then to the a / d interface box ( a / d ib ) .",
    "the a / d ib was constructed by the lsu physics electronics shop and the gravity wave group .",
    "it controls the sampling rate of the data , converts the analog signals to digital data streams and sends the data to a vaxstation 3500 .",
    "an important factor to note is that before any data was collected by the a / d ib rigorous testing was performed on it . a sine wave of amplitude large enough to span the entire range of the a / d converters was input to each a / d and the output inspected to verify : ( 1 ) that the a / d converters responded properly , ( 2 ) that the time between samples remained constant and that no samples were missed , ( 3 ) that the data written to disk was consistent with the input signal .",
    "it was not until the data acquisition system ran for about a week without any problems that it was considered stable enough to collect data .",
    "a kinemetrics model 60-dc clock provides a 1khz square wave phase - locked to utc which the a / d ib uses as a counter .",
    "when the counter reaches 8 ms the data is sampled and sent to disk , resulting in a sampling time of 8 ms .",
    "data sampled includes : ( 1 ) the in - phase and quadrature output channels of the lockin ( referred to as @xmath14 and @xmath15 respectively ) , ( 2 ) a direct low frequency signal from the squid , ( 3 ) the signal from the two seismometers , ( 4 ) the status of the hardware and squid vetos and ( 5 ) the sample time in utc . the voltages out of the lockin are sampled with 16-bit accuracy , the others 12-bit accuracy .",

    "there are 4320 blocks in a full day s worth of data .",
    "a dec 3000 axp , clustered to the vaxstation 3500 , is used for on - line monitoring of the detector and analysis of the data .",
    "a week s worth of data ( about 875 mbytes ) is allowed to accumulate on disk and is then archived to 4 mm dat tape .",
    "two tapes are made using vms backup to insure the data is transferred accurately and one tape is made using vms copy which allows easy access to the data .",
    "one backup tape and the copy tape are stored in the lab , while the other backup tape is stored off campus .",
    "the data analysis programs read a block of data directly off of the disk . since the data is written to disk every twenty seconds",
    ", it is available twenty seconds or less after being collected . in this way problems with the detector or with the electronics",
    "can be identified and corrected quickly .",
    "this `` on - line '' monitoring capability does not affect the taking of data since it is a separate program running at a much lower priority than the collection routine .",
    "a single program , written in the language matlab , does the majority of the data analysis .",
    "the analysis begins by reading in a block of data , removing dc offsets from the in - phase and quadrature signal components and correcting for lockin gain",
    ". the program implements two digital lockins which mix @xmath14 and @xmath15 with reference frequencies set at the plus and minus resonant frequencies .",
    "the outputs of these digital lockins are the in - phase and quadrature components of the amplitude of each mode , written as @xmath16 where @xmath17 refers to the plus mode and @xmath18 the minus .",
    "the in - phase and quadrature components of each mode are then separately filtered with an @xmath19 order digital bessel anti - aliasing filter having a corner frequency of 2.35 hz . the filtered data is then decimated to reduce the amount of data handling .",
    "we keep only every tenth sample , truncating the data to an effective sampling time of 80 ms .",
    "the in - phase and quadrature components of each mode are optimally filtered for a burst signal ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : optfilt ] ) and the output squared and added to form the mode burst energies at each sample . representing the output of the optimal filter by @xmath20 @xmath21 and @xmath22 ,",

    "[ ben ] .",
    "it has become conventional in this field to express energy in kelvin .",
    "therefore , a `` mode noise temperature '' is defined as the mean value of the mode burst energy @xmath24 .",
    "burst energy is not to be confused with the energy in a mode as given by the equipartition theory .",
    "instead , it is a measure of the change in energy of the modes between samples .",
    "since the sampling time is much less than the `` random walk '' time of the antenna ( 8 ms compared to 40 mins ) the noise temperature is much less than the physical temperature of 4.2 k.    to reduce the amount of data handled , a threshold is applied so that only those samples with energy @xmath25 the noise temperature or greater in both modes are recorded each day by the analysis programs .",
    "each sample is tagged with the time in seconds from the start of the day . above this threshold",
    "there are roughly 400 - 600 allegro samples per day ( fig .",
    "[ hist ] ) . also as part of the analysis the average over each record of @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28",
    "is recorded along with the utc time of the start of each record and the raw low frequency and seismometer data .",
    "this information is used primarily for diagnostic checks on the detector .",
    "this is the end of the analysis unless there is to be a coincidence search with other gravity wave detectors , such as the explorer detector of the university of rome , or gro gamma ray data . before exchanging data",
    ", we first edit those excitations of the antenna that can be positively identified as something other than a gravity wave ( such as an earthquake or an electronic hiccup ) . next the mode noise temperatures ( fig .",
    "[ ntemp ] ) are calculated in six minute averages for the entire span of the coincidence search . the statistically correct way to combine the energy information from both modes is by forming a weighted burst energy @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the weighted noise temperature ( this is the overall noise temperature of the detector ) and @xmath31 are the previously mentioned averages .",
    "a threshold is applied to @xmath32 so that only samples with @xmath33 are kept .",
    "the factor of 11.5 was chosen so that the allegro event rate for the 1991 coincidence search with the explorer detector would be about 100 events / day .",
    "the consistency of the allegro detector is demonstrated by the fact that the same threshold produced about 100 events / day for the entire 3 1/2 years of continuous operation .",
    "consecutive samples above threshold are then collapsed into a single time and energy , creating an event .",
    "the energy assigned to the event is the energy of the sample in the series of consecutive samples above threshold with the maximum energy value .",
    "the time of the event is given by the time of the first sample in the series plus half the duration of the series , where the duration is defined to be the time of the last sample minus the time of the first sample .",
    "the sample time is determined by reading the utc time at the beginning of the record containing the event and then counting the number of samples ( at 80 ms between samples ) into the record to that event .",
    "then an offset is subtracted from the resulting time to account for filtering delays .",
    "figure  [ elist ] shows the final event list for a small section of data .",
    "the optimal filtering on allegro is done in the time domain so that it can be applied directly to the incoming data .",
    "we use the matlab _ filter _",
    "routine which applies the optimal filter to the data using the transposed direct form ii structure  @xcite .",
    "the filter coefficients which will maximize the signal to noise ratio for a sequence of data involving stationary noise are given by  @xcite , @xcite @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the vector containing the filter weights , @xmath36 is the inverse of the autocorrelation matrix of the noise and @xmath37 is the detector s response to the signal being looked for . in the following analysis of the optimal filter",
    "we will use a single underline to denote a vector and two underlines for a matrix . because the in - phase and quadrature components for each mode are statistically similar , they can be averaged to make a single correlation function for the noise in each mode .",
    "also , the in - phase and quadrature components of the signal vector are combined ( described later ) to form the mode response to a burst .",
    "the correlation functions of the two modes are not similar and therefore a pair of filter weights are created , one to filter the plus mode and the other to filter the minus mode .",
    "the details of creating the autocorrelation matrix and the response vector ( signal ) are described next .",
    "the signal vector @xmath37 is obtained by applying a very large calibration pulse to the antenna so that the low pass filtered and decimated output is essentially unaffected by the stationary noise .",
    "next , the mean value of the first few samples is subtracted from each sample in the signal array so that the amplitude just before the pulse hits the antenna is near zero .",
    "then , the squares of the in - phase and quadrature signal components in each mode are added and the square root taken to create the final form of the signal vector ( fig .  [ nsig ] ) @xmath38      the first step in forming the autocorrelation matrix for the noise is to form the autocorrelation function for one record s worth of low pass filtered and decimated data @xmath39 with @xmath40 the number of coefficients in the filter , @xmath41 the sample index and @xmath42 the time offset index .",
    "this is done every twentieth record for an entire day s worth of data .",
    "it is necessary to use such a long time span of data because of the long relaxation times of the normal modes .",
    "all events outside the thermal distribution are removed from the data before forming the correlation function as the presence of non - stationary noise will degrade the filter s performance .",
    "the length of the filter , @xmath40 , was determined experimentally .",
    "filter lengths of 20 to 50 decimated samples were tried and it was found that the noise temperature of the modes decreased up to 40 coefficients ( amounting to 3.2 seconds of data ) .",
    "after that , the noise temperature no longer decreased with increasing coefficient number so 40 decimated samples was chosen as the length for the filter .    next , the values of @xmath43 at each @xmath42 from each record analyzed are summed and the in - phase and quadrature components added to form the autocorrelation function for a mode .",
    "the autocorrelation matrix is formed using the matlab routine _ toeplitz _ such that the zero delay components @xmath44 lie along the diagonal @xmath45 here the in - phase and quadrature components are denoted with an @xmath14 and @xmath15 respectively .",
    "the inverse of the matrix is formed using the matlab _ inv _ routine @xmath46    having obtained the inverse of the autocorrelation function for the noise and the signal vector , the filter weights for both the plus and minus modes are formed by eq .",
    "( [ wz ] ) .",
    "the final form of the weights is shown in fig .",
    "[ optfil ] .      once the optimal filter is constructed the weights are normalized by putting a pulse of known energy into the antenna using the calibrator .",
    "a srs model ds345 function generator was used to provide 2 cycles of a 908 hz sine wave of constant amplitude to the calibrator at twenty second intervals .",
    "the energy deposited in each mode of the antenna by a single pulse is  @xcite @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the calibrator coupling coefficient for each mode , defined as the ratio of the current output from the calibrator to the input driving voltage and were measured in a separate experiment .",
    "@xmath49 are the mode frequencies , n is the number of cycles and v is the voltage zero to peak provided to the calibrator .",
    "a weighted burst energy is formed with eq .",
    "[ wbe ] .",
    "approximately 60 pulses were applied having an amplitude large enough so that the effects of stationary noise on the estimate of the resulting burst energies was small . after applying the pulses the data was analyzed as described in section  [ sec : datanaly ] to produce a list of corresponding events .",
    "the mean of the mode burst energies of the pulses was compared to the expected energy deposited in the antenna as given by eq.([cal ] ) and the filter weights scaled so that the two matched .    the filtering scheme causes a delay between the actual arrival time of a pulse and the recorded arrival time .",
    "this delay needs to be measured and removed from the estimate of the timing of events .",
    "a very large calibration pulse was applied to the antenna and analyzed to produce a filtered event .",
    "this event consisted of approximately 40 decimated samples similar to fig .",
    "the time ascribed to this event by the procedure described previously was 14581.672 seconds . examining the raw data ( after lockin and low pass filtering but before any processing by the analysis programs or decimation ) it was determined that the first signs of the calibration pulse effecting the antenna appeared at 14579.936 seconds .",
    "subtracting the two gives a delay of 1.74 seconds , which is then removed when the event times are recorded .",
    "it is impossible for a single detector to differentiate between a gravity wave passing through the antenna and excitations due to noise . at low energies the thermal spectrum ( stationary noise ) masks any signal , while above that",
    "a signal is indistinguishable from a burst of non - stationary noise .",
    "two or more ( the more the better ) detectors operating in coincidence , however , can greatly reduce the noise level by demanding that : ( 1 ) a gravity wave excite each antenna simultaneously within a few milliseconds , depending on the distance between them and ( 2 ) for similar detectors aligned with respect to astrophysical sources , such as allegro and explorer , the energy deposited in each be equal . unfortunately , noise sources add a degree of uncertainty to any measurements of event arrival time and energy with the result that one looks instead for a coincidence : ( 1 ) in a window of time which is much greater than the light travel time between detectors and ( 2 ) where the energy of a signal is no longer equal in each detector , but lies in some range which we shall show depends on both the noise temperature of the detectors and the strength of the signal . in this section",
    "we quantify the uncertainties introduced into these measurements by the stationary noise .    using the same parameters as described in section  [ sec : optfilt ] a series of calibration pulses",
    "was applied to the bar .",
    "a signal from the function generator was connected to one channel of the hardware veto so that at the same time a voltage pulse was applied to the calibrator a veto was recorded .",
    "this allowed the sample immediately following excitation of the antenna to be identified .",
    "the largest error this procedure can produce in the timing of the pulse is 8 ms which , as we shall see , is much smaller than the final uncertainties in the timing .",
    "the anticipated energy deposited by each pulse given by eq.([cal ] ) and their number for each calibration series are shown in table  [ caltabl ] .",
    "+    .the anticipated energy of each calibration pulse and the number of pulses applied at that energy for a given series .

    "call the event time assigned to each calibration pulse the `` arrival time '' and identify a `` pulse application time '' with the tripping of the veto . subtracting the arrival time from the application time produces a timing offset for each calibration pulse .",
    "figure  [ offset ] shows the offset for each pulse in the calibration series cal1_327 .",
    "the standard deviation of the offsets is a measure of the uncertainties in our timing procedures .",
    "figure  [ tunc ] shows the standard deviation of the offsets from each series of pulses , in effect plotting the timing uncertainty as a function of signal strength .",
    "of the nine data points shown , 7 are within one standard deviation of the mean uncertainty , and only the smallest signal ( still about @xmath50 ) is significantly different .",
    "what is surprising is that at the highest signal strength , about @xmath51 , the timing is no more accurate than at lower energies .",
    "the end result is that for signals above @xmath50 allegro s timing is accurate to @xmath52 second .",
    "noise sources acting on the antenna , both thermal and electronic , are stationary distributed with zero mean .",

    "the lowering of the background from 1991 to 1993 is attributed to two causes .",
    "first , the antenna was warmed to 15 k at the beginning of 1993 which may have reduced trapped flux in the superconductors or released some built up mechanical stress .",
