    ", we get @xmath452 in the last parenthesis the second term is dominated by the first one and the third term is dominated by the fourth . if we recall that @xmath453 , we get @xmath454 similarly , from ( [ ed.2 ] ) , ( [ ed.31 ] ) we get @xmath455 using ( [ ed.11 ] ) , we get @xmath456 see .",
    "this will be used together with the estimates @xmath457 in ( [ ed.3 ] ) .",
    "the differential form @xmath458 will change only by a factor of modulus one if we express @xmath50 in another fixed orthonormal basis and we will choose for that the basis @xmath459 : @xmath460 write @xmath461 and restrict to @xmath462 , where we sometimes identify @xmath463 with @xmath464 : @xmath465 then , @xmath466 @xmath467 taking @xmath383 until further notice , we get with @xmath468 : @xmath469 here , we used ( [ ed.8 ] ) .",
    "the first term to the right is equal to @xmath470 when @xmath435 and it vanishes when @xmath471 .",

    "the third term is equal to @xmath473 ( by differentiation of the identity @xmath474 ) and it vanishes for @xmath472 ( remember that we take @xmath383 ) .",
    "thus , for @xmath383 : @xmath475 when forming @xmath476 we see that the terms in @xmath477 for @xmath472 in the expression for @xmath478 will not contribute , so in that expression we can replace @xmath479 by @xmath480 . using ( [ ed.46 ] ) ,",

    "equivalently , by the same reasoning as after , @xmath55 should satisfy @xmath512 then @xmath513 and using ( [ ed.49 ] ) , we get @xmath514    since @xmath515 , the first integral is equal to @xmath516 the sum of the other two integrals is equal to @xmath517 noticing that @xmath518 we deduce that @xmath519 we next study the leading term in ( [ ed.53 ] ) , given by @xmath520 since @xmath521 belongs to the span of @xmath522 and @xmath523 , we have @xmath524 so the leading term ( [ ed.54 ] ) is @xmath525 which by ( [ ed.36 ] ) is equal to @xmath526 here , @xmath527 is the function appearing in proposition [ ed3 ] .",
    "let us first compute the limiting quantity obtained by replacing @xmath403 in ( [ ed.55 ] ) by @xmath528 . since @xmath529 , we get @xmath530 and @xmath531    we next approximate the expression ( [ ed.55 ] ) with ( [ ed.56 ] ) , using ( [ ed.39 ] ) and the fact that @xmath532 ( uniformly with respect to @xmath31 ) . the expression ( [ ed.55 ] ) is equal to @xmath533 here , @xmath534 so the last expression becomes , @xmath535 where the first two terms in the remainder are dominated by the last one .",
    "we conclude that the difference between the expressions ( [ ed.55 ] ) and ( [ ed.56 ] ) is @xmath536 , and using also ( [ ed.53 ] ) , we get , @xmath537 the remainder term can be written @xmath538 by ( [ ed.52 ] ) , @xmath539 , so the second term is @xmath540 which is much larger than the first term .",
