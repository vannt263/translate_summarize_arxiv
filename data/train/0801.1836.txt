    "@xcite it was found that the opening of the asymmetry gap in bilayer graphene leads to very small changes in the overall optical sum .",
    "here we consider the optical conductivity of such a system with particular emphasis on the optical spectral weight redistribution brought about by changes in the chemical potential , due to charging , and to the opening of a semiconducting gap . in the configuration envisioned here ,",
    "donor atoms are seeded on the upper face of a bilayer which is also placed in a field effect device so that the carrier imbalance in each layer is different as is the electrostatic potential .",
    "the structure of our paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we outline the theoretical derivation of the optical conductivity starting from the simplest nearest - neighbor tight - binding hamiltonian which includes terms associated with the biased bilayer configuration . in section iii , we present results for the case without the anisotropy gap , pertinent to the unbiased graphene bilayer . here , we have been able to derive a surprisingly simple analytical formula for the frequency - dependent conductivity for arbitrary choice of chemical potential and we have tested it against the full numerical solution and find good agreement , making this a very useful formula for experimentalists . in pure monolayer graphene ,",

    "is once again removed below @xmath9 and a drude peak occurs . in section iv",
    ", we consider the case of the bilayer with an asymmetry gap .",

    "the metallic behavior is restored and a drude peak occurs accompanied by loss of spectral weight below @xmath9 and the structure due to the doubly degenerate transitions is split , as before . the nesting feature at @xmath8 in the unbiased bilayer is now shifted to a new value and is broadened due to imperfect nesting of the energy bands .",
    "finally , we end our analysis with a discussion in section v.",
    "in order to derive and discuss the optical conductivity of biased bilayer graphene , we need to examine the form of the band structure and provide an expression for the electronic green s function . to this end",
    ", we begin with the hamiltonian for the system under consideration and follow the notation given by mccann@xcite and benfatto et al.@xcite for continuity .",
    "the single spin hamiltonian is given as :    @xmath10    the first two terms are the nearest neighbor hopping terms for electrons to move in each of the graphene planes , separately .",
    "the two planes are indexed by 1 and 2 , with a single graphene sheet having two inequivalent atoms labelled @xmath11 and @xmath12 , as the arrangement of carbon atoms on the two - dimensional honeycomb lattice provides for two atoms per unit cell .",
    "the operator @xmath13 annihilates an electron on the @xmath12-atom site with site label @xmath14 in the graphene sheet with label 1 and @xmath15 creates an electron on the neighboring @xmath11-atom site in the same sheet positioned at @xmath16 , where @xmath17 can be one of three vectors which point to the three possible nearest neighbors .",
    "these vectors are enumerated as @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 , where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the unit vectors of the triangular sublattice for the @xmath11 or @xmath12 atoms , and @xmath23 with @xmath24 the distance between two nearest carbon atoms .",
    "now in layering graphene sheets , there are several choices for stacking .",
    "the one under consideration here and in experiment , is that of the bernal - type stacking where if the atoms are labelled @xmath25 and @xmath26 in sheet 1 and @xmath27 and @xmath28 in sheet 2 , then the @xmath27 atoms are stacked directly over the @xmath26 atoms , but the @xmath28 atoms are stacked over the centers of the @xmath25-@xmath26 carbon rings .",
    "pictures of this structure can be found in several references@xcite and so we do not reproduce this here .",
    "note , however , that if we use the index @xmath14 to reference the @xmath26 atoms , then transferring this index to the @xmath27 atoms directly above gives rise to indexing the nearest neighbor vectors in the second sheet relative to the @xmath11 atoms and hence the vectors are orientated differently and labelled as @xmath29 .",
    "this stacking means that in terms of nearest neighbors associated with interlayer coupling , the @xmath27 atom is the nearest neighbour of the @xmath26 atom through a direct vertical bond .",
    "thus , in the hamiltonian of eq .",
    "( [ eq : h ] ) , the third term shows the hopping term for an electron on the @xmath26 site to hop to the @xmath27 site in plane 2 .",
    "the hopping parameter is given as @xmath8 and is typically about 0.4 ev . there is also a possibility to hop from @xmath26 to @xmath28 or @xmath25 to @xmath27 but these hopping energies are very small ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "hopping from @xmath25 to @xmath28 in the hamiltonian is another possibility and its energy is larger at @xmath30 ev,@xcite however , we do not display it in the hamiltonian as we drop this term to focus on the physics and results which come from the main interlayer coupling , the @xmath8 term , which is essential to the discussion of the bilayer configuration .",
    "furthermore , we are considering a biased bilayer structure which can give rise to the very novel physics of being able to tune the bilayer from metallic to semiconducting behavior , consequently the biasing is indicated in eq .",
    "( [ eq : h ] ) as a lowering of the energy on graphene plane 1 by an amount @xmath31 and the raising of the energy on plane 2 by the same amount .",
    "this results in the last two terms of eq .",
    "( [ eq : h ] ) .",
    "the quantity @xmath32 is referred to as the asymmetry gap .",
    "the hamiltonian transforms in the standard way@xcite to @xmath33-space and can be written as a matrix : @xmath34 where @xmath35 and we have followed the notation of mccann@xcite by using an eigenvector @xmath36 .",
    "the energy eigenvalues of this matrix define the band structure .",
    "as the bilayer has four atoms per unit cell ( doubling that of single layer graphene ) , there are now four bands and these are given by : @xmath37 where @xmath38 , 2 . of these four bands , the lower energy ones @xmath39",
    "are essentially the original graphene bands with low energy modification and the @xmath40 are higher energy bands reflecting the dimerized bond between @xmath26 and @xmath27 , which has an energy scale of @xmath8 .",
    "as the main low energy physics occurs at the two inequivalent @xmath41 and @xmath42 points of the graphene brillouin zone , the function @xmath43 can be expanded around the @xmath41 point in the continuum approximation ( i.e. , the limit of small lattice constant @xmath44 ) to be @xmath45 , where @xmath46 . with this approximation ,",
    "if @xmath47 and @xmath48 , we would recover the famous graphene band structure where @xmath49 is the form of the dispersion around the so - called dirac points , which are two - fold degenerate for the uncoupled bilayer .",
    "however , if @xmath47 and @xmath50 , the band structure around these points is modified to be quadratic in @xmath33 ( although still linear at larger @xmath33 ) and the degeneracy is lifted such that the dimerized bands are shifted by @xmath8 , as can been seen later on in our first figure .",
    "the presence of the bias energy @xmath32 , produces an energy gap in the band structure and a `` mexican hat '' structure occurs in the lower energy band @xmath51 with a minimum at @xmath52 at @xmath53 , where @xmath54 and a `` hat '' maximum at @xmath55 for @xmath56 .",
    "this will be discussed further in section  iv .",
    "this unusual band structure and the presence of the energy scales of @xmath8 and @xmath32 , gives rise to very rich structure in the frequency - dependent conductivity , as we will see .    with this hamiltonian , it is straightforward to obtain the green s function @xmath57 through @xmath58 or @xmath59 where @xmath60 , with @xmath61 the fermionic matsubara frequency for @xmath62 and @xmath63 , the temperature . for our calculation of the optical conductivity ,",

    "the retarded current - current correlation function is also referred to as the polarization function which we calculate in matsubara formalism as outlined by mahan@xcite and given as @xmath79 where @xmath80 is imaginary time , @xmath81 is the time ordering operator and @xmath82 is the bosonic matsubara frequency @xmath83 for @xmath84 and temperature @xmath63 . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : kubo1 ] ) @xmath74 is the analytic continuation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : pi ] ) to the real axis via @xmath85 .",
    "the current operator is the sum over sites of the site - specific paramagnetic current operator@xcite : @xmath86 in order to evaluate this , we require the particular current operator corresponding to our hamiltonian .",
    "this is found via a peierls substitution on eq .",
    "( [ eq : h ] ) , where the operators associated with hopping to a new site are modified as @xmath87 .",

    "the paramagnetic current is given as @xmath91 note that the hermitian conjugate piece has a minus sign representing a depletion of the current for hopping in the reverse direction .",

    "we first note the existence of a small tail below this energy and also note that the main rise is smeared .",
    "this is because we have used a finite impurity scattering rate of @xmath211 in all of our numerical work .",
    "it is clear that most of the states lost below the gap ( @xmath181 ) are to be found piled up in a region of order a few @xmath207 above it .",
    "later we will examine in detail this optical spectral weight redistribution .",
    "this part of the curve for @xmath162 is due to the @xmath136 transitions and their onset involves the singular density of states at @xmath207 for both initial and final states .",
    "the second peak in the dashed blue curve is traced to transitions @xmath133 and @xmath134 ( degenerate in energies ) and these involve a single singular @xmath189 either in the initial or final state but not for both , and the onset is at @xmath212 .",
    "it is also clear from fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ( top frame ) that this onset remains even for finite @xmath2 because the @xmath134 transition is never blocked by a finite @xmath2 value provided @xmath2 falls below the minimum in @xmath176 which is the case considered here .",
    "next we consider the dash - dotted black curve for @xmath209 . in this case , the @xmath136 transitions are no longer possible for energies less than or equal to @xmath213 because these states are occupied and can not be used as final states in optical transitions .",
    "the energy @xmath213 is very close to the onset for the dashed blue curve with @xmath0 which is at @xmath214 and , as a result , both dashed and dash - dotted curves are close to each other in this energy region .",
    "nevertheless it is important to understand that while the dashed blue curve is in principle encoded with the information on the details of the mexican hat topology , the dash - dotted black curve is less so as it involves , in addition , a sharp cut off at @xmath215 , which obscures some of these details .",
    "finally we note the transfer of optical spectral weight to a drude peak centered at @xmath125 due to @xmath142 intraband transitions .",
