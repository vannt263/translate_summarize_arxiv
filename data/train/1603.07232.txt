    "the dyson - schwinger - bethe - salpeter - equation ( dsbse ) approach to hadrons is a modern nonperturbative framework based on qcd as a continuum quantum field theory @xcite .",
    "phenomenological dsbse studies mostly make use of the rainbow - ladder ( rl ) setup , since this provides excellent value for money or , in other words , an optimal balance of richness and feasibility , e.g. , . beyond rl one",
    "can explore the infinite set of dyson - schwinger equations ( dses ) in symmetry - preserving truncation schemes , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "the dyson - schwinger equation ( dse ) for the dressed quark propagator @xmath8 describes how @xmath9 behaves at quark momentum @xmath10 depending on the dressed gluon propagator @xmath11 and the dressed quark - gluon vertex ( qgv ) @xmath12 ( the bare qgv is denoted by @xmath13 ) , which is depicted in the left panel of fig .  [ fig : gapequation ] .",
    "the right panel of this figure shows the definition of the quark self energy @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "@xmath15 denotes the free quark propagator , which serves as a driving term in this inhomogeneous integral equation and is also used to formulate a renormalization condition for the regularized integral @xcite . in all figures ,",
    "blobs depict dressed quantities , while dots depict the bare counterparts .",
    "in particular , the scalar part of @xmath15 is the current - quark mass @xmath16 . here and in the following , we assume all quantities to be renormalized and omit indices for simplicity .",
    "note that , due to the appearance of the inverses of @xmath8 and @xmath15 , the quark dse is nonlinear .    in rl truncation",
    "one makes the _ ansatz _ depicted in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : rl ] to replace the product of the dressed gluon propagator and dressed qgv by the product of their bare counterparts multiplied with an effective interaction @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "this function of the gluon momentum squared is then modeled and used to conduct sophisticated covariant studies of hadrons .    the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : rl ] shows the effect of this _ ansatz _ in the quark self energy as defined in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : gapequation ] .",
    "basically , one is left with known quantities and can solve the equation after making an informed choice for @xmath17 .",
    "the two - body bound - state equation in a quantum field theory is the bethe - salpeter equation ( bse ) , which is depicted in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : bse ] .",
    "ingredients are the dressed quark propagator , which one gets from solving its dse , and the amputated quark - antiquark scattering kernel @xmath18 , which is unknown a priori @xcite .",
    "the rl truncation , inspired and guided by the axial - vector ward - takahashi - identity ( avwti ) , leads to an effective - gluon exchange ladder kernel as shown in the center panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : bse ] .",
    "the avwti is the manifestation of chiral symmetry in the qcd context , and respecting it guarantees a correct in - principle as well as phenomenological setup of the framework with respect to chiral symmetry and its dynamical breaking .",
    "concretely , rl truncation satisfies the avwti and thus one automatically has a massless pion in the chiral limit , if chiral symmetry is dynamically broken by the effective interaction @xcite .",
    "the solution of the bse is the bethe - salpeter amplitude ( bsa ) denoted in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : bse ] for the pion by @xmath19 .",
    "it is the covariant analogue of a wave function and contains all information about the state @xcite .",
    "it is found at a particular value of one of the arguments of @xmath19 , the total momentum squared @xmath20 , which gives the bound - state s mass @xmath21 via @xmath22 .",
    "the ladder - truncated bse kernel again contains only known objects such that a solution is straightforward .",
    "the quark dse and meson bse are coupled , since the dse solution appears as input in the bse .",
    "we solve this coupled set of equations numerically in euclidean momentum space .",
    "the appropriate tools are all at hand and can be found in @xcite . in order to calculate leptonic decay constants of mesons , one has to compute a diagram as shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : bse ] , where the appropriate axial - vector current for @xmath23 is depicted as a black - yellow blob and denoted by @xmath24 for the pseudoscalar case ; the vector decay constant is obtained via @xmath25 .",
    "a very successsful and typical sophisticated effective interaction was given in @xcite , which we use also herein .",
    "the high - momentum behavior of the interaction is that of perturbative qcd ; its shape at intermediate momenta is determined by essentially two parameters : an inverse effective range @xmath26 and an overall strength @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "variations of these parameters change the interaction s shape as shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : dsesol ] @xcite .",
    "the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : dsesol ] shows a characteristic set of solutions of the quark dse in terms of the quark mass function , where @xmath16 assumes typical values for the masses of the up / down ( light ) , strange , charm , and bottom quarks @xcite .",
    "in addition to those , we also show the solution in the chiral limit , i.e. , with @xmath27 @xcite .",

    "we found that our results for decay constants do not change much from one parameter set to another , so they are robust in terms of their order of magnitude .",
    "however , some changes occur .",
    "for example , excitations can switch places as seen for the first and second @xmath1 excitation in sets i and ii .",
    "also , the smaller the numbers get , the more sensitive they tend to be to parameter changes .",
    "still , on the whole one can identify the relevant patterns and we turn to set ii for further analysis . by the size of the decay constants we match our third radial @xmath2 excitation to the missing @xmath5 and the fifth to the @xmath6 ,",

    "for the @xmath6 state we obtain @xmath103 ev .",
    "these predictions for the decay widths are about one order of magnitude larger than those from other approaches , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "a more in - depth comparison is thus necessary and will be published elsewhere .",
    "we also note that in terms of experimental sensitivity , the upper limits for these decays are , in fact , of the order of @xmath104 ev or less @xcite .    to check the @xmath8/@xmath3-wave assignment , we investigated the contributions from various covariant structures in the vector - meson bsa to the state s canonical norm .",
    "while @xmath105 is not a lorentz invariant , we can investigate the situation in the meson rest frame in which we solve the bse @xcite . upon inspection ,",
    "the picture holds , i.e. , those states with larger leptonic decay constants receive dominant contributions to the norm from @xmath8-wave bsa components . in those cases which we compare to @xmath3-wave states ,",
    "the dominant contributions are shifted to @xmath3-wave bsa components with small additional contributions from @xmath8-wave .",
