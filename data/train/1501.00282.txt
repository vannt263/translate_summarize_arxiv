    "the temperature anisotropy is found to be highly gaussian and `` statistically isotropic '' in the sense that nearly all statistical proprieties of the temperature anisotropy can be described by the angular power spectrum @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "however , it was found since _ wmap _",
    "1-year data that there is a deep cold spot ( @xmath2k ) in the southern galactic hemisphere along the direction ( @xmath3 ) with angular radius @xmath4  @xcite , which is further confirmed by _ planck _",
    "nominal mission data  @xcite .",
    "the cold spot is highly non - gaussian in the sense that the probability of the cold spot existing in the statistical isotropic gaussian universe is less than @xmath5 percent  @xcite .",
    "since then , the cold spot feature in the cmb map has invoked many observational and theoretical investigations .",
    "initially , it was suggested that the unsubtracted foreground contamination might be responsible for the apparent non - gaussian features  @xcite , but later studies  @xcite showed that the significance of cold spot is not affected by galactic residues in the region of the spot .",
    "it was also proposed that a spherically symmetric void with radius @xmath6mpc at redshift @xmath7 can produce a large and deep cmb cold spot through the late - time integrated sachs - wolfe effect  ( isw )  @xcite ( also known as the rees - sciama effect  @xcite ) .",

    "however , more detailed following - up studies  @xcite showed that the rees - sciama effect produced by such a void is several orders of magnitude lower than the linear isw effect therefore is not able to account for the observed feature .    the interesting non - gaussian feature of cold - spot also invokes theorists to investigate the plausible explanation from the early universe . by considering various cosmological defects in the early universe , refs .",
    "@xcite proposed that a cosmic `` texture '' ( i.e. a concentration of stress - energy and a time - varying gravitational potential due to the symmetry - breaking phase transition ) can generate hot and cold spots on the last - scattering surface , with the fundamental symmetry - breaking scale found to be @xmath11gev .",
    "however , by applying the bayesian method to _ wmap _ full - sky data , ref .",
    "@xcite did not find strong evidence of the texture model , neither completely rule out the possibility ( at 95% confidence level ) .",
    "it was also proposed that cosmic bubble collision , predicted by eternal inflation theories , can induce the density perturbation between our bubble and others , which can give arise to the localized features in the cmb  @xcite .",
    "but more detail data analysis  @xcite showed that the expected number of bubble collision is too few to account for the features in the cmb .",
    "alternatively , a cold spot may follow from a different trajectory during multi - stream inflation  @xcite or modulated reheating after multi - field inflation  @xcite .",
    "the above physical or astronomical interpretations of cold spot either fail at some level , or require fine tuning or exotic scenarios of the early universe . economically , some cosmologists would prefer to interpret the cold spot merely as a `` @xmath12 '' statistical fluke . in this paper , we will provide a natural and physically plausible explanation of the cold spot , through multiple - field inflation .",
    "if the inflationary trajectory is scattered by a feature hidden in the isocurvature direction , the inflaton loses some energy and thus inflation tends to be longer .",
    "therefore , it is possible that only a small portion of the sky hits the feature due to stochastic fluctuations , then that local patch of the universe experiences longer period of inflation and thus produces a cold spot .",
    "the mechanism is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : feature ] .",

    "in this section , we provide an explicit example of feature scattering to illustrate the physical mechanism .",

    "our analysis is not sensitive in the form of @xmath18 , as long as it successfully drives slow - roll inflation . for illustration purpose ,",
    "we choose a small field potential for @xmath18 : @xmath19 such a potential can be derived from brane dynamics of string theory @xcite .",
    "we will nevertheless not import anything other than this potential from string theory , but consider it as a phenomenological example .    to fit the observations",

    "we set @xmath28 ( one can always shift the @xmath29 parameter to satisfy this requirement if needed ) .",
    "the quantum fluctuation of @xmath30 will be crucial in the analysis .",

    "as we will show , the nonlinear mapping from @xmath30 to @xmath32 generates the cold spot on the cmb .    to explore the parameter space of @xmath25",
    ", we will choose three sets of parameters as three illustrative examples of feature scattering .",
    "* benchmark 1 : negative short feature .",
    "we set @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "the procedure of the calculation is also introduced in this subsection . *",

    "we set @xmath40 , @xmath38 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "the differences from benchmarks 1 and 2 are discussed .",
    "note that in the above benchmarks , the randomness in the potential needs not to be large .",
    "in fact , @xmath43 is already significant enough to bring observable difference .",
    "this is because , the isocurvature fluctuation control whether the inflation trajectory hit the feature . and",
    "once the trajectory hits the feature , the change of curvature perturbation will be order @xmath44 . as a result ,",
    "our mechanism is extremely sensitive to small features in the potential .",
    "the @xmath45 formalism @xcite will be used to investigate the cosmological perturbations from the feature scattering .",
    "the @xmath45 formalism uses the observation that different hubble patches during inflation can be approximated as different local frw universes .",
    "thus the cosmological observables can be calculated by exploring those local frw universes . especially , the curvature perturbation in the uniform energy density slice can be calculated by @xmath46 where @xmath45 is the difference of e - folding number between an initially - flat slice and a finally - uniform energy density slice .",
    "the curvature perturbation @xmath47 is then converted to the cmb temperature anisotropy following the standard theory of cmb . in this paper",
    "we will use the sachs - wolfe approximation @xmath48 .",
    "intuitively , the relation can be understood as : @xmath49 more precise relation between @xmath50 and @xmath47 can be studied by solving the boltzmann equations at recombination .",
    "note that @xmath45 has two sources : the quantum fluctuation of @xmath16 and the quantum fluctuation of @xmath51 .",
    "those independent sources can be studied independently , and they needs to be added together to make the total curvature fluctuation . in the numerical calculation , we will focus on investigating @xmath45 as a function of @xmath51 but we will add back a contribution of gaussian random field to account for the contribution from @xmath16 at the last map - making stage .",
    "the angular size of the cold spot is around 10 degrees . converting to horizon crossing time of comoving wave number",
    ", this corresponds to @xmath0 . note that in the observed cmb temperature power spectrum , there is indeed a dip at @xmath0",

    "( ) with three benchmarks , and calculate the e - folding number as functions of the position of isocurvature field @xmath52 .      in this subsection , we consider a negative short feature in the potential .",
    "we set @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "the size of the feature in the @xmath16 direction is relatively small ( compared to the case of benchmark 2 ) . as a result",
    ", the @xmath53 field does not have enough time to oscillate inside the negative feature .    before getting to the implications to the late universe",
    ", it is intuitive to check what was happening during inflation .    as an example",
    ", we consider the @xmath51 field value when hitting the feature to be @xmath54 . the time evolution of @xmath55 is plotted on the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : neg_traj ] .",
    "one can find from the plot that , at @xmath56 ( where feature scattering happens ) @xmath57 when the inflationary trajectory hits the feature , there is a change in the velocity of the inflaton @xmath16 . at first , @xmath58 increase because @xmath16 falls into a potential well .",
    "however , two other effects immediately follow : first , the obtained energy is returned because @xmath16 has to climb out of the potential well ; second , the potential well can be considered as a scattering center , such that a similar amount of energy is transferred to the @xmath51 direction ( as evidenced in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : neg_traj ] ) . as a result",
    ", there is a overall loss of velocity of the inflaton , with the value read from the plot @xmath59 in words , the inflaton field has lost @xmath60 of its kinetic energy because of hitting the feature in the potential .",
    "note that the inflaton always loses its kinetic energy because of scattering off a feature .",
    "thus a cold spot instead of a hot spot is predicted .",
    "note that the loss of kinetic energy takes of order one e - fold to recover , because this is the time scale to reach the inflationary attractor solution . to be more precise , as shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : neg_traj ] , it takes about roughly @xmath61 e - fold for the inflaton to recover its kinetic energy . as a result , here is from the quantum fluctuation of @xmath51 .",
    "the part from @xmath16 will be added at the map - making stage . ]",
    "@xmath62    from the sachs - wolfe approximation , the temperature fluctuation @xmath63 .",
    "thus we get @xmath64k .    carrying on the above analysis for general values of @xmath65 , numerically the temperature fluctuation as a function of @xmath65",
    "is plotted in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : neg_chi_dt ] .",
    "we then simulate 1000 maps and rotate those maps such that they center at the cold spot . in the left panel of the top row of fig .",
    "[ fig : neg_theta_dt ] , we bin the pixels of the map as a function of @xmath66 , and then plot the 0.5 , 0.16 and 0.84 quantiles ( corresponding to the central value and 1@xmath53 uncertainty if the probability distribution were gaussian ) of the binned pixel temperature . in the right panel of the top row of fig .  [",
    "fig : neg_theta_dt ] , we plot the top five best - fitting cold spot profiles .",
    "three best - fitting examples are given in the top row of fig .",
    "[ fig : neg_eg ] .      in this subsection we consider a negative long feature",
    "inside a `` long '' feature , there is enough time for the @xmath51 field to oscillate .",
    "we set @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath35 and @xmath39 .",
    "note that the feature size in the @xmath16 direction is 5 times longer than that of benchmark 1 .",
    "finer structures develop in the case of long feature .",
    "if we have chosen an initial value @xmath54 , we find similar behavior to fig .",
    "[ fig : neg_traj ] .",
    "however , for some other initial values , for example , @xmath67 , the @xmath51 field oscillates inside the feature .",
    "the situation is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : osc_traj ] . as a result , some amount of @xmath51 kinetic energy is returned to @xmath16 . for some special values , almost all kinetic energy is returned .",
    "thus oscillatory patterns develop , as shown in the middle panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : neg_chi_dt ] .",
    "the oscillations in @xmath68 leads to ring objects in @xmath69 .",
    "the cold spot in this parameter space is not completely cold , but instead has nested rings of cold and hot patterns .",
    "there is no evidence of such patterns in the actual cmb cold spot .",
    "there has been a debate if there are other ring patterns in the sky @xcite .",
    "the benchmark 2 parameters provide an explanation for such rings ( though the shape is not perfectly spherical ) .",
    "however , it is shown that the appearance of such rings is due to an inappropriately chosen power spectrum , and thus not actually in the sky @xcite .",
    "thus we will not tune the parameters to fit such features here .",
    "the general and best - fitting cold - spot profiles , and sample spots are plotted in the middle row of figs .",
    "[ fig : neg_theta_dt ] and [ fig : neg_eg ] , respectively .      in this subsection",
    "we consider positive feature scattering .",
    "we set @xmath40 , @xmath38 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 . with positive potential ,",
    "the @xmath51 direction has a run - away solution and can never be bounded .",
    "so there is no oscillation in this case .",
    "the @xmath68 dependence is not as sharp as the previous two benchmarks .",
    "thus the cold spot does not have as clear a boundary as those previous cases .",
    "because of the not - so - sharp @xmath68 dependence , to get a cold enough center of the spot , we have to increase @xmath70 . as a result , the cold spots generated by benchmark 3 typically ( though not always ) have very cold tinny cores .",
    "the general and best - fitting cold - spot profiles , and sample spots are plotted in the bottom row of figs .",
    "[ fig : neg_theta_dt ] and [ fig : neg_eg ] , respectively .    considering a very sharp and cold core",
    "is formed for positive features , it is unlikely that such features can fit the realistic cold spot . but",
    "considering that the sharpness of the cold core depends on model parameters .",
    "the cold core may appear at @xmath71 scales and free streaming may erase the sharpness .",
    "the feature scattering not only applies to massless isocurvature directions , but also to marginally massive ones . as long as the mass of the isocurvature direction is not much greater than @xmath72 , the energy scale for inflationary fluctuations , the isocurvature direction can still be excited to explore its field space . during inflation , fields with @xmath73",
    "arise naturally @xcite .",
    "thus it is worthwhile to investigate feature scattering of such marginally massive fields , with an additional mass term in the potential @xmath74    note that the process of feature scattering happens on a time scale much shorter than hubble .",
    "thus as long as @xmath75 is not much great than @xmath76 , @xmath75 does not enter the dynamics of feature scattering .",
    "however , the spectral index of a massive field is significantly different from a scale invariant spectrum , with spectral index @xmath77 thus the mass of the field controls how many e - folds can the isocurvature direction randomly travel .",
    "for example , when @xmath78 , the @xmath51 field has a spectrum @xmath79 .    in the numerical example , we set @xmath78 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath80 . in other words , we have only tuned @xmath29 to be slightly greater , and consider a massive @xmath51 field .",
    "otherwise the parameters coincide with the benchmark 1 of massless case .",
    "the general and best - fitting cold - spot profiles , and sample spots are plotted in figs .",
    "[ fig : mas_theta_dt ] and [ fig : mas_eg ] , respectively .    as one can see from fig .",
    "[ fig : mas_eg ] , there are more small - scale structures compared to the case of massless benchmark 1 .",
    "to conclude , we propose a scattering mechanism of inflaton due to the features in the inflation potential , during which the isocurvature fluctuations are converted into curvature fluctuations .",
    "the curvature fluctuations direction loses kinetic energy due to the scatters in isocurvature direction , therefore the number of e - folds becomes larger in some region of the universe .",
    "we find that the cold spot can be well explained by such a mechanism , and the spot profile reasonably fits the cmb cold spot without fine tuning of the inflationary parameters . before ending up the paper",
    ", we would like to mention a few future directions :    * beyond the sachs - wolfe approximation .",
    "currently we did not use the full boltzmann code to calculate the cmb transfer function .",
    "the sachs - wolfe approximation works well for exploring the coarse - grained cold - spot profile but is not enough for probing the fine structures inside the spot .",
    "one can use the full radiation transfer function to carry on a more detailed analysis in the future . * verifying the approximations of the @xmath45 formalism .",
    "the @xmath45 formalism assumes that the horizon - crossing amplitude of the @xmath16 and @xmath51 quantum fluctuations are gaussian and uncorrelated . in the case of feature scattering , this is not rigorously true because of the turning of trajectory .",
    "however , note that the transfer of the inflaton kinetic energy is tinny ( 0.1% in the studied example ) , the correction from sub - horizon physics should be suppressed by this small fraction .",
    "+ having that said , it remains interesting to see if the calculation from @xmath45 formalism can be verified by first principle calculation .",
    "however , such a calculation is challenging .",
    "the first principle calculation of cosmological perturbations is known as the in - in formalism .",
    "but in the in - in formalism , the primary calculatables are the correlation functions . in other words ,",
    "one starts from the gaussian two point correlation function and studies small departure from that .",
    "but the cold spot is highly non - gaussian and localized object , and thus is not easily captured by the correlation functions from the in - in formalism .",
    "* extra species / symmetry point ( esp ) @xcite as scattering centers . in our current examples ,",
    "the inflaton kinetic energy is lost into the collective motion of the isocurvature direction .",
    "it may also be possible that the kinetic energy of the inflaton is lost into hidden esps in the isocurvature direction .",
    "it is interesting to explore such possibilities . * connection between the feature scattering regime and the multi - stream regime : by carefully arranging the position of the feature , it is possible that different part of the universe follows different classical trajectories , separated by temporary domain walls .",
    "this is known as the multi - stream inflation @xcite , which is also a possible explanation of the cold spot .",
    "feature scattering and multi - stream corresponds to different regimes of the multi - field parameter space .",
    "if the features on the inflationary potential are random , we expect the feature scattering to be more typical ( whereas highly random features in multi - stream inflation cause disasters and provide a constraint on multi - field inflation @xcite ) . * connection between the cold spot and the dip of cmb temperature power spectrum at @xmath0 .",
    "we argue they may come from the same origin  feature scattering during inflation . with our current toy potential given at eq .",
    "( ) , we are unable to explain this power deficit at the same time",
    ". however , a more general shaped potential may be able to explain both the deficit and the cold spot .",
    "* string theory model building .",
    "it is believed that string theory has a landscape of complicated vacuum structures @xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to build string landscape models for feature scattering .",
    "especially , our mechanism assumes that @xmath81 and @xmath82 have value of order @xmath72 .",
    "this assumption is made at the phenomenological level in this paper .",
    "nevertheless , it is interesting to search for theoretical motivations for such a potential . for inflation to work",
    ", the inflationary perturbations , in the sense of effective field theory , should have enough range of validity .",
    "especially , the uv cutoff of the theory should be at least of order @xmath72 . in the marginal case where the uv cutoff of the effective field theory is just of order @xmath72 ,",
    "new features are expected when the field rolls a distance of order @xmath72 .",
    "in addition , inspired by quasi - single field inflation @xcite , the mass parameters during inflation should be naturally of order @xmath72 .",
    "thus once there are many mass parameters in the landscape , such as some mass matrix , variations will be introduced in the potential with field range of order @xmath72 .",
    "we leave detailed investigation of those possibilities to future works . * careful model comparison between our feature scattering mechanism and the @xmath83cdm base model .",
    "we have 5 parameters in our illustrative model .",
    "the parameters are chosen to be the convenient ones for inflation model building , but not optimized to fit the data as a phenomenological model .",

    "<S> we propose a `` feature - scattering '' mechanism to explain the cosmic microwave background cold spot seen from _ wmap _ and _ planck _ maps . </S>",
    "<S> if there are hidden features in the potential of multi - field inflation , the inflationary trajectory can be scattered by such features . </S>",
    "<S> the scattering is controlled by the amount of isocurvature fluctuations , and thus can be considered as a mechanism to convert isocurvature fluctuations into curvature fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> this mechanism predicts localized cold spots ( instead of hot ones ) on the cmb . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , it may also bridge a connection between the cold spot and a dip on the cmb power spectrum at @xmath0 . </S>"
