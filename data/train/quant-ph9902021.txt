    "the vacuum of electromagnetic field is known @xcite to give rise to several types of very interesting coherence effects .",
    "for example it gives rise to atom - atom correlations and the collective effects . in a single multilevel atom",
    ", it also gives rise to coherences among levels .",
    "the coherences are especially significant if the relevant levels are near by . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that the vacuum of the electromagnetic field can lead to the possibility of a trapped state in a degenerate v - system . the ref .",
    "@xcite also analyzed the origin of such a trapped state in terms of suitably defined coupled and uncoupled states .",
    "spontaneous emission produced a coherence between the two excited states of the v - system .",
    "further , it was shown that such a vacuum induced coherence ( vic ) can suppress the steady state resonance fluorescence @xcite , and can substantially modify the emission spectrum @xcite .",
    "recently , interest in this subject has been revived due to the various possibilities of manipulating atomic properties using atomic coherence effects . using this kind of coherence effect , hegerfeldt and",
    "plenio showed that periodic dark states and quantum beats appear in a near - degenerate v - system @xcite .",
    "the work of zhu , scully and coworkers @xcite demonstrate that even spectral line elimination and spontaneous emission cancellation is possible .",
    "this was observed experimentally by xia , ye and zhu in sodium dimers @xcite . an appealing physical picture to explain spontaneous emission cancellation",
    "was provided by agarwal @xcite .",
    "the effect of vacuum induced coherence ( vic ) on spontaneous emission has been suggested to achieve gain without inversion and sub - natural line - widths @xcite .",
    "we mention that such a coherence mechanism is also known to occur in quantum well structures @xcite .",
    "recent studies have also shown that vacuum induced coherence effects give rise to phase sensitive absorption @xcite and emission @xcite profiles as well as to obtain phase control of spontaneous emission in v - systems @xcite .    while much of the work has been in connection with v - systems ,",
    "other level schemes like @xmath0-systems and @xmath1-systems @xcite have also been studied . in case of @xmath0-systems ,",
    "the coherence is produced in the ground state .",
    "we study in this article the origin of this coherence and the question of a proper probe for such a coherence .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follow . in sec .",
    "ii we show the reason behind the origin of vic . in sec .",
    "iii we derive the spontaneous emission spectrum in the presence of vic , and show that the spectrum is independent of vic . in sec .",
    "iv we show that absorption of a weak field , as a probe for vic , will be uniquely modulated due to vic . using second order perturbation",
    "theory we derive the analytical results which well explains our numerical results .",
    "finally , in sec .",
    "v we present concluding remarks .",

    "the field annihilation and creation operators are @xmath14 and @xmath15 respectively where the subscript denote the @xmath16 mode of the field with polarization along @xmath17 .",

    "we have dropped the anti - resonant terms from ( [ ham3 ] ) .",
    "we work with density matrices and use the standard master equation technique here .",
    "a calculation leads to the following master equation for the reduced density matrix @xmath22 of the atomic system @xmath23 -\\gamma_{1\\alpha}(a_{11}\\rho - 2a_{\\alpha\\alpha } \\rho_{11 } + \\rho a_{11 } ) -\\gamma_{1\\beta}(a_{11}\\rho \\nonumber\\\\ & & - 2a_{\\beta\\beta}\\rho_{11 } + \\rho a_{11 } ) + 2\\sqrt{\\gamma_{1\\alpha } \\gamma_{1\\beta } } \\cos\\theta_1 a_{\\beta\\alpha } \\rho_{11 }   + 2\\sqrt{\\gamma_{1\\alpha } \\gamma_{1\\beta } } \\cos\\theta_1 a_{\\alpha\\beta } \\rho_{11}. \\label{master}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath24 and @xmath25 denote the spontaneous emission rates from state @xmath26 to states @xmath27 and @xmath2 respectively and @xmath28 is the angle between the two transition dipole moments @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "the last two terms in the above equation are the interference term due to coupling of the two atomic transition @xmath31 , @xmath32 to a common vacuum @xcite of the electromagnetic field .",
    "the dipole matrix elements should be non - orthogonal for the above interference to occur .",
    "the density matrix elements , @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) , in the schrdinger picture obey equations @xmath35 where @xmath36 .",
    "note that the equation for the ground state coherence @xmath37 is coupled to the population of the excited state . solving for the coherence @xmath37 with the initial condition @xmath38 gives , @xmath39 as the equation reads , this coherence is non - zero as a result of interference term . even in the long time limit ( @xmath40 )",
    "this coherence is finite and oscillates with a frequency @xmath41 @xmath42 the magnitude of this coherence is especially significant only if @xmath43 @xcite and if the dipole matrix elements are parallel .",
    "thus , as mentioned , even vacuum of electromagnetic field can give rise to coherence in systems with near degenerate levels .",
    "we next address the questions : ( a ) what leads to the coherence ( [ coh0 ] ) , and ( b ) how such a coherence can be measured .",

    "thus we conclude that the spontaneous emission spectrum in a @xmath0-system is _ not affected _ by vic .",
    "therefore one has to consider other types of probes to study vic in such a system .",
    "the above result is not surprising because the coherence is created after the spontaneous emission has occurred .",
    "an alternative approach to monitor vic will be to study the absorption of a probe field tuned close to some other transition in the system . in this paper",

    "note the interesting phase dependence that arises in the probe absorption due to non - zero @xmath108 .",
    "this phase dependence is another outcome of the presence of vic in a system .",
    "since the probe is treated to second order in its amplitude , the result is independent of the coherence parameter @xmath109 for the transition @xmath110 , @xmath111 .",
    "needless to say that the eqs .",

    "it is useful to remove the optical frequencies by making the transformations @xmath112 , @xmath113 ( @xmath114 ) and @xmath115 etc .",

    "3 . figure 3 shows the significant difference that arises due to the presence or absence of vic .",
    "the oscillation in the probe absorption is the reflection of oscillation of in the coherence @xmath37 ( see ( [ coh0 ] ) ) and this confirms the analytical result ( [ second2 ] ) .",
    "the numerical result shows a very slow decay of the envelop of the oscillations .",
    "this arises from terms which are of higher order in probe strength .",
    "finally we discuss the changes in absorption spectrum that can arise due to vic .",

    "4 as a function of probe detuning .",
    "these two components of the absorption spectrum behave quite differently .",
    "the important criteria for the existence of the vacuum induced coherence between the close lying levels is the nonorthogonality of the dipole matrix elements . in practice",
    "the nonorthogonality can be achieved by mixing of the energy levels .",
    "the mixing can occur either due to internal fields or due to externally applied fields .",
    "for example in the experiment of xia _ et at . _",
    "@xcite , spin - orbit interaction gives rise to mixing .",
    "the vic has also been studied when the level mixing is produced by using electromagnetic fields @xcite , dc fields @xcite , and rf fields @xcite .",
    "special configurations involving cavities can also be utilized to study vic @xcite .",
    "in conclusion we have found that the vic in a @xmath0-system is more difficult to monitor as it does not show up in the fluorescence spectrum .",
    "we have however demonstrated that the absorption spectrum carries the information on vic and that the vic produces a modulated component in the absorption spectrum .",
