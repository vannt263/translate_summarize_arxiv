    "one of the main themes in astronomy over the coming decades will be the exploration of the dawn of the modern universe , when the first massive black holes , galaxies , and stars formed .",
    "x - ray astronomy missions such as , , , , and can play a crucial role in this investigation by allowing studies of warm and hot objects in the early universe . they will thereby complement high - redshift studies with observatories such as _ alma _ , _ gsmt _ , _ herschel _ , _ ngst _ , and _ sirtf _ , which will generally focus on cooler objects .",
    "for example , x - ray observations will permit study of the first massive black holes to form in the universe ; such black holes can plausibly form at @xmath1 ( e.g. , haiman & loeb 2001 ) .    x - rays reveal the conditions in the immediate vicinity of the supermassive black hole .",
    "measurements of the x - ray continuum s shape , amplitude relative to longer wavelength radiation , and variability can provide information about the inner accretion disk and its corona and thus ultimately offer insight into how the black hole is fed .",
    "the x - ray continua of quasars could plausibly change at the highest redshifts .",
    "for example , the rapid growth of such quasars could occur if they are accreting matter near the eddington limit where accretion - disk instabilities and `` trapping - radius '' effects ( e.g. , begelman 1978 ) can arise .",
    "there have been some claims of x - ray continuum shape evolution with redshift that require further investigation ( e.g. , vignali et  al .",
    "1999 ; blair et  al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "the penetrating nature of x - rays allows even highly obscured black holes to be studied , and x - ray absorption measurements can be used to probe the environments of high - redshift quasars .",
    "changes in the amount of x - ray absorption with redshift have been discussed by many authors ( e.g. , fiore et  al .",
    "1998 ; elvis et  al . 1998",
    "; reeves & turner 2000 ) .",
    "the fraction of radio - loud quasars ( rlqs ) with heavy x - ray absorption appears to rise with redshift , with column densities of @xmath2  @xmath3 being seen at @xmath4 .",
    "the absorbing gas may be circumnuclear , located in the host galaxy , or entrained by the radio jets .",
    "the situation for the more common radio - quiet quasars ( rqqs ) is less clear due to a general lack of rqq x - ray spectra at @xmath5 .",
    "rqqs definitely show less of an absorption increase with redshift than do rlqs ( e.g. , fiore et  al .",
    "1998 ) , but the constraints on an absorption / redshift connection are quite loose and require improvement .",
    "our understanding of the x - ray emission from quasars has advanced rapidly over the past few years , enabled largely by the capabilities of  and .",
    "furthermore , ground - based surveys such as the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; york et  al .",
    "2000 ) have discovered many new quasars that are excellent targets .",
    "the number of published x - ray detections at @xmath0 has increased to almost 30 ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "x - ray detections .",
    "the only @xmath0 non - agn detected in the x - ray band is the gamma - ray burst grb  000131 ( andersen et  al .",
    "this increase has allowed the first reliable x - ray population studies of @xmath0 quasars .",
    "it has also been possible to achieve x - ray detections at redshifts above five . prior to 2001",
    "the highest redshift x - ray detection was gb  1428 + 4217 at @xmath6 ( fabian et  al .",

    "2001 ; brandt et  al . 2002 )",
    ".    the rapid advances of late should continue for the next several years . by 2004",
    "it is plausible that there will be @xmath8 x - ray detections and @xmath9  1015  x - ray spectra of @xmath0 objects .",
    "throughout this paper we will adopt @xmath10  km  s@xmath11 mpc@xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 .",
    "prior to 2000 there were only six published @xmath0 x - ray detections ( see fig .  1 ) , and these were for a heterogeneous mixture of objects not suitable for population studies .",
    "they included three radio - loud blazars ( mathur & elvis 1995 ; fabian et  al .",
    "1997 ; zickgraf et  al .",
    "1997 ) , two x - ray selected rqqs ( henry et  al . 1994",
    "; schneider et  al .",
    "1998 ) , and only one optically selected rqq ( bechtold et  al . 1994 ) .",
    "the blazars were notable for their large x - ray fluxes that allowed moderate - quality x - ray spectroscopy ( see fig .  3 ;",

    "all of the four @xmath0 blazars currently detected in the x - ray regime appear to have their emission dominated by jets .",
    "three of the four show evidence for low - energy spectral flattening that may be due to intrinsic absorption , in line with the findings for lower redshift rlqs described in  1 . while these blazars have been wonderful targets for study , they are not representative of the majority quasar population at @xmath0 ( e.g. , stern et  al",
    "furthermore , due to the strength of the x - ray emission from the jet , it is difficult to observe the accretion disk and the immediate vicinity of the black hole .    with the 20002002 studies ,",
    "optically selected rqqs , the majority quasar population , now dominate the number of @xmath0 x - ray detections ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "there are 20 such detections published at present .",
    "six of these were obtained in an archival study of  data by kaspi , brandt , & schneider ( 2000 ) , and an additional 12 were obtained via exploratory ( 210  ks )  observations ( e.g. , vignali et  al .",

    "] we have obtained a significant number of new detections , and these will be published shortly ( c. vignali et  al . , in preparation ) .",
    "the exploratory observations have defined the typical x - ray fluxes and luminosities of @xmath0 quasars . as shown in fig .  3 ,",
    "these quasars are typically faint x - ray sources , and even the brightest non - blazars generally have fluxes @xmath15  erg  @xmath3  s@xmath11 .",
    "the practical implication of this is that x - ray spectroscopy of @xmath0 quasars will generally be a challenging endeavor ( see  2.2 for details ) .",
    "there is a clear correlation between x - ray flux and @xmath16 magnitude , although there is significant scatter around this correlation ( see fig .  3 ; vignali et  al .",
    "2001 give the results of correlation tests ) .",
    "the scatter makes it risky to attempt long spectroscopic observations before an x - ray flux has been established via exploratory observations .",
    "the 210  kev rest - frame luminosities of the observed quasars range from @xmath17  @xmath18  erg  s@xmath11 to @xmath19  erg  s@xmath11 .",
    "the exploratory observations have also allowed a basic assessment of the contribution of x - ray emission to the broad - band spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of @xmath0 quasars .",
    "4 , for example , shows the quantity  plotted versus redshift for optically selected rqqs ;  is the slope of a nominal power law between 2500    and 2  kev in the rest frame [ @xmath20 ) where @xmath21 is the flux density at 2  kev and @xmath22 is the flux density at 2500   ] .",
    "quasars in fig .",
    "4 we have generally calculated @xmath21 from the observed - frame 0.52  kev flux ( assuming an power - law photon index of @xmath23 ) ; this is required because acis has limited spectral response below 0.5  kev .",
    "thus , the derived  values are actually based on the relative amount of x - ray flux in the 0.5@xmath24  kev to 2@xmath24  kev rest - frame band . ]",
    "there is no evidence for strong changes in  with redshift , despite the large changes in quasar number density over the redshift range shown in fig .",
    "4 ( see  5.3 of fan et  al . 2001 and references therein ) .",
    "some quasars at @xmath0 may have slightly more negative  values , perhaps due to x - ray absorption by the large amounts of gas in their primeval host galaxies ( see vignali et  al .",
    "2001 for further discussion ) . however , the  constraints at @xmath0 ( and especially at @xmath25 ) require improvement via further observations before small  changes can be considered significant .",
    "the lack of strong changes in  with redshift is generally consistent with the lack of strong spectral evolution at other wavelengths .",
    "for example , the ultraviolet rest - frame spectra of @xmath0 quasars are only subtly different from those at lower redshifts ( e.g. , schneider , schmidt , & gunn 1989 ; constantin et  al .",
    "2002 ) , and the fraction of rlqs does not appear to change significantly with redshift ( e.g. , stern et  al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "4 has several important implications .",
    "first of all , it supports the idea that x - ray emission is a universal property of quasars at all redshifts ; this result had already been established for low - redshift quasars ( @xmath26 ; e.g. , avni & tananbaum 1986 ; brandt , laor , & wills 2000 ) .",
    "most of the x - ray nondetections in fig .  4 with @xmath27",
    "are broad absorption line ( bal ) qsos or mini - balqsos ; there is now evidence that these quasars indeed produce x - rays at a typical level but that this emission is absorbed ( e.g. , gallagher et  al .",
    "2001 ; green et  al . 2001 ; gallagher et  al . 2002 ) .",
    "thus , fig .",
    "4 bodes well for attempts to detect the first massive black holes to form in the universe ( @xmath28  820 ) with deep x - ray surveys ; the current data suggest that these objects are likely to be luminous x - ray emitters .",
    "secondly , the fact that  does not change strongly with redshift helps to validate the bolometric correction factor usually adopted ( e.g. , fan et  al . 2001 ) when estimating the black hole masses of high - redshift quasars via the eddington argument .",
    "the derived masses of @xmath17  ( 15)@xmath29  m@xmath30 place constraints on theories of cosmic structure formation ( e.g. , efstathiou & rees 1988 ; turner 1991 ) .",
    "thirdly , the x - ray emission of high - redshift quasars is expected to affect the heating and ionization of the intergalactic medium ( e.g. , venkatesan , giroux , & shull 2001 ) . the data in fig .",
    "4 suggest that , at least to first order , the seds of local quasars may be adopted when trying to compute the effects of early quasars upon the intergalactic medium .",
    "some studies have found evidence that  depends upon quasar optical luminosity , with more luminous quasars generally having more negative values of  ( e.g. , avni , worrall , & morgan 1995 ; green et  al . 1995 ; but see yuan , siebert , & brinkmann 1998 for an alternative point of view ) .",
    "we have searched for such a trend using the rqqs shown in fig .  4 ; balqsos and mini - balqsos have been removed since their  values are affected by absorption .",
    "a weak trend is possible , but additional observations ( of a well - defined rqq sample ) will be required to determine if one is present since there is significant scatter in   ( @xmath31 ) at all optical luminosities ( see  4.2 of vignali et  al .",
    "2001 for details ) .",
    "it is worth noting that of @xmath28  46 quasars are expected to suffer from strong flux amplification ( by a factor of @xmath32 ) due to gravitational lensing ( e.g. , wyithe & loeb 2002 ) .",
    "such an effect will confuse studies of the dependence of  upon luminosity ;  will probably not be changed by gravitational lensing , but the true luminosity will differ from that assumed .",
    "finally , exploratory observations of @xmath0 quasars allow searches for extended x - ray emission associated with jets .",
    "schwartz ( 2002a ) has argued that x - ray jets can serve as cosmic beacons .",
    "if the x - ray emission from jets is produced via the compton scattering of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons by relativistic electrons , then it should be detectable to high redshift ; the increase in the cmb energy density with redshift compensates for cosmological surface - brightness dimming .",
    "schwartz ( 2002b ) has recently identified a possible jet from the quasar sdss  1306 + 0356 ; notably , this quasar is not a strong radio source .",
    "further observations are required to check this possibility , and exploratory observations of a large number of @xmath0 quasars should allow a search for an overdensity of `` companion '' x - ray sources that could be radio jets .      aside from the four blazars mentioned near the start of  2.1 ,",
    "detailed x - ray spectral analyses of @xmath0 quasars have not been performed at present .",
    "such analyses are important to search for changes in the x - ray power - law photon index and x - ray absorption ( neutral or ionized ) with redshift .",
    "to our knowledge , the highest redshift rqq with x - ray spectral constraints of reasonable quality is the @xmath33 gravitationally lensed balqso apm  08279 + 5255 ( see fig .  5 ;",
    "gallagher et  al .",
    "this object has a power - law photon index of @xmath34 ( for the rest - frame 525  kev band ) , consistent with those seen for lower - redshift rqqs ( e.g. , george et  al .",
    "2000 ; reeves & turner 2000 ) .",
    "the lack of quasar x - ray spectroscopy at @xmath0 is largely due to their low x - ray fluxes which limit the number of photons that can be gathered ( see  2.1 ) .",
    "basic hardness ratios for several objects appear consistent with those of low - redshift quasars ( e.g. , vignali et  al .",
    "2001 ) , but even these have large errors . with exposures ,",
    "can obtain moderate - quality ( @xmath17  10002000 count ) @xmath17  150  kev spectra of @xmath0 quasars with 0.52  kev fluxes of @xmath35  erg  @xmath3  s@xmath11 ( see fig .",
    "has only been detected from the blazars pmn  j05253343 ( fabian et  al .",
    "2001b ) , gb  1428 + 4217 ( fabian et  al .",
    "1999 ; boller et  al .",
    "2000 ) , and gb  1508 + 5714 ( moran & helfand 1997 ) .",
    "there are tentative claims that quasar x - ray variability increases with redshift ( e.g. , manners , almaini , & lawrence 2002 ) . ] furthermore , stacking the counts from quasars observed by  ( as well as those with exploratory  observations ) can provide tight average spectral constraints and allow searches for spectral features such as iron  k@xmath36 lines .",
    "effective x - ray spectroscopy of quasars with 0.52  kev fluxes of @xmath37  erg  @xmath3  s@xmath11 will require future missions such as , , and ; populating fig .  3 with further detections will allow optimum planning of these missions .      at present , there are four published @xmath0 quasars that were selected based upon their detection in x - ray surveys : rx  j1759 + 6638 ( henry et  al . 1994 ) , rx  j10280844 ( zickgraf et  al .",
    "1997 ) , rx  j1052 + 5719 ( schneider et  al . 1998 ) , and cxomp  j213945.0234655 ( silverman et  al . 2002 ) . the lockman hole source rx  j1052 + 5719 is notable due to its low luminosity ( it is the point furthest to the left in fig .",
    "3 ) , and cxomp  j213945.0234655 is the highest redshift x - ray selected quasar published to date ( @xmath38 ) .",

    "this object s spectrum is notable for its relatively narrow lyman  @xmath36 line .",
    "the radio - selected agn vla  j1236 + 6213 has also been detected in the  deep field - north survey ( brandt et  al .",
    "2001b ) ; this object has a likely redshift of @xmath40 ( waddington et  al .",
    "vla  j1236 + 6213 is a very faint source in both the optical and x - ray bands with @xmath41 and a 0.52  kev flux of @xmath42  erg  @xmath3  s@xmath11 ( compare with fig .  3 ) .",
    "its rest - frame 210  kev luminosity is @xmath43  erg  s@xmath11 , comparable to those of the local seyfert galaxies ngc  3516 , ngc  3783 , and ngc  5548 .",
    "this is by far the lowest luminosity x - ray source known at @xmath0 , and its detection demonstrates that  is achieving the sensitivity needed to study seyfert - luminosity agn at high redshift .",
    "a large population of seyfert - luminosity agn at @xmath28  410 has been postulated by haiman & loeb ( 1999 ) .",
    "these `` proto - quasars '' would represent the first massive black holes to form in the universe , and they would play an important role in galaxy formation .",
    "one of nasa s long - term goals for x - ray astronomy is to understand such objects ( e.g. , white 2002 ) , and ultradeep  exposures are one of the few ways that they might be found at present . with a 510  ms exposure ,  can achieve sensitivities comparable to those discussed for missions such as  ( see fig .",
    "a 5  ms  observation could detect a @xmath44 proto - quasar down to a rest - frame 5.522  kev luminosity of @xmath45  erg  s@xmath11 ( after a plausible bolometric correction , this is the x - ray luminosity expected from an @xmath46  m@xmath30 black hole radiating near the eddington limit ) . at @xmath44  provides rest - frame sensitivity up to @xmath47  kev , and such high - energy x - rays can penetrate a substantial amount of obscuration .",
    "positions are likely to be the best available for at least 1520 years , and precise positions will be essential for reliable identification of proto - quasars . , and its construction will require challenging improvements in lightweight precision x - ray optics .",
    "see the  white paper by zhang et  al . at http://universe.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/roadmap/submissions.html . ]    at @xmath48 an agn should appear optically blank ; the lyman  @xmath36 forest and gunn - peterson trough will absorb essentially all of the flux through the @xmath49 band .",
    "thus , an upper limit on the space density of proto - quasars can be set simply by counting the number of x - ray sources that lack any optical counterpart .",
    "effective application of this method , however , requires exceptionally deep optical imaging to prevent confusion between truly optically blank sources at extreme redshift and very optically faint sources at moderate redshift ( e.g. , objects like the @xmath50 , @xmath51 agn cxohdfn  j123651.7 + 621221 ; brandt et  al .",
    "2001b and references therein ) .",
    "at present , the  deep field - north data suggest that there is @xmath52 agn detected at @xmath48 per ( alexander et  al .",
    "2001 ; down to a luminosity limit at @xmath53 of @xmath43  erg  s@xmath11 ) .",
    "this limit should soon be tightened substantially via improved ground - based imaging and the great observatories origins deep survey ( goods ) .",
    "a 510  ms  exposure should also allow normal and starburst galaxies at @xmath0 to be studied via count stacking analyses .",
