    "in the early nineties the question of the possibility to tile an arbitrarily large strip of space - filling roller bearings without friction nor slipping was addressed  @xcite , motivated by the study of real systems such as seismic gaps .",
    "seismic gaps are regions along a fault zone where earthquakes do not take place and therefore they could be explained by sheared plates on a space - filling bearing  @xcite .",
    "fault zones are typically self - similar and the mechanical origin of the power - law in the particle size distribution was associated to the particle s fracture probability which has been proposed to be controlled by the relative size of its nearest neighbors  @xcite .",
    "more recently , a geophysical model  @xcite explained the different values of the fractal dimension , ranging from @xmath0 to @xmath1 , by taking into account the fault gouge strain .",
    "while such model explains the dynamical origin of different power - laws , there is still the question if the space - filling bearing scenario is able to reproduce such empirical results in a simple and systematic way . by reproducing with space - filling bearings the same particle size distributions observed in fault zones one can strengthen the hypothesis that the existence of seismic gaps in fault zones may be related to the emergence of particular geometrical arrangements of their composing rocks , due to local fragmentation during tectonic motion .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] illustrates two random space - filling bearings in two and three dimensions .",
    "pioneering studies with space - filling bearings were done using deterministic procedures in two  @xcite and three  @xcite dimensions and also using random algorithms  @xcite . however , up to now specific initial configurations and fixed parameter values were addressed . in this paper",
    "we present a general algorithm to construct realistic space - filling bearings that allows to reproduce the range of fractal dimensions observed in fault gouges  @xcite .",
    "the model is parameterized by a unique parameter that controls the strength of fragmentation and takes into account ensemble averages . despite the wider freedom in the parameters and initial configurations ,",
    "the systems presents robust results in what concerns the fractal dimension .",
    "in particular , we will show that by varying the range of admissible values of the control parameter one finds fractal dimensions observed in fault gouges .",
    "we start in section [ sec : prevalg ] by describing in some detail the procedure to generate random space - filling bearings , introducing a parameter that accounts for fragmentation at the local scale . in sec .",
    "[ sec:2d ] and [ sec:3d ] we describe the results for two and three dimensions respectively , with special emphasis on the size distribution and the fractal dimension .",
    "discussions and conclusions are given in sec .",
    "[ sec : conc ] .",
    "in this section we will start by revisiting previous procedures  @xcite for constructing random space - filling packings and bearings and then introduce the necessary ingredients to obtain a fully random space - filling bearing .",
    "random bearings in two and three dimensions are constructed in the following way .",
    "first , one starts by randomly distributing a small number @xmath2 of discs or spheres within a given range of sizes , without touching each other .",
    "second , one fills the empty spaces in the system by introducing iteratively the biggest possible disc or sphere in the neighborhood of some empty region .",
    "third , one resizes some disc or sphere in order for the packing to be bi - chromatic ( bearing condition ) , i.e.  only two colors are needed to color all discs in such a way that no discs of the same color touch each other .",
    "this guarantees the bearing condition : particles are able to role on each other without friction or slipping .",
    "figures [ fig2]a and [ fig2]b give illustrative examples of such random bearings in two dimensions .    the filling procedure is done by choosing randomly a void within the inter - disc free space and then fitting the biggest disc in it , i.e.  fit the disc that touches the three nearest discs in the neighborhood , as illustrated in fig .",
    "for the three dimensional case one considers spheres touching the four nearest neighbors .",
    "the coloring procedure is done by attributing a proper color to the introduced disc . in the case",
    "that the three neighboring discs have the same color one attributes the other color to the new disc .",
    "otherwise , one chooses only one of the neighbors to be in contact with the new disc , and the new disc shrinks to a size with radius @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) , where @xmath5 is the radius before shrinking and gets a different color as the disk it touches .",
    "figure [ fig2]b illustrates this coloring procedure .    , keeping a single contact point with one of the neighbors and assuming the opposite color . *",
    "( c ) * to start the space - filling with a large disc ( brown ) one needs to place previously a few small ` seeds ' ( green ) in the system ( grey ) and then proceed as in ( a ) and ( b ) [ see text].,title=\"fig:\",width=151 ] , keeping a single contact point with one of the neighbors and assuming the opposite color . *",

    "@xmath7 one obtains the particular case where bearing can not be guaranted . in this case , frustrated contacts emerge when particles are forced to rotate  @xcite , which would eventually lead to the fragmentation of the discs into smaller ones .",
    "recently a new method to implement realistic grain fracture in three - dimensional simulations of granular shear was proposed  @xcite , based on breakable bonds between particles within a medium .",
    "we keep the model simple , by using instead the reduction factor @xmath6 that mimics the effect of fragmentation : by shrinking a particle originally with frustrated contacts we mimic its fragmentation into smaller particles that will fill the empty space left after the fragmentation .",
    "the algorithm described above was previously@xcite used in two and three dimensions by fixing a given initial configuration with @xmath2 discs having sizes within a given fixed range and also by using a fixed reduction factor @xmath6 during the filling and coloring stages .",
    "the density of the packing was studied as a function of the number @xmath8 of existing spheres as well as the cumulative particle size distribution .",
    "it was found that the cumulative distribution obeys a power - law , namely @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the fractal dimension of the bearing  @xcite .",
    "next , we introduce the additional points to strengthen previous findings and improve the algorithm described above .",
    "first , there is the statistical significance of the results , and their sensitiveness to initial configurations , i.e.  to the initial range @xmath11 $ ] of sizes .",
    "this initial configuration may influence the polydispersity of the system and consequently the attained distribution after filling the entire system .",
    "as we will see , large number @xmath2 of initial discs typically influence how the density increases during the space - filling procedure .        to take this point into account we enable the construction procedure to start with an initial configuration having a single arbitrarily large disc ( or sphere ) and perform ensemble averages on a significant number of initial configurations . concerning the single initial large disc",
    ", one should notice that it does not suffice one single disc to introduce a second one , because in two - dimensions each inserted disc needs to have at least three neighbors ( four neighbours for three - dimensions ) .",
    "however , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig2]c , such starting disc can be introduced into the system by previously distributing a few very small ` seed - discs ' in the system and then following the algorithm described above .",
    "the number of such seeds is small , and therefore they do not affect significantly the cumulative size distribution .",
    "their role is that the average distance between them is eventually of the order of the system size , enabling the introduction of a first disc with the size of the order of the system size . of course , depending on the number and distribution of the seeds , the first initial discs may have also a size within the initial range of sizes . in this way ,",
    "one generalizes the previous procedure  @xcite and maximizes the admissible polydispersity .",
    "second , we also introduced a criterion to increase computational efficiency of our algorithm .",
    "the neighborhood were the neighboring discs ( or spheres ) are searched for must be chosen conveniently .",
    "we propose to choose a size that decreases with the increase of the density @xmath12 , since the denser the packing the smaller are the empty spaces to put new discs .",
    "therefore , the radius @xmath13 of the neighborhood of a given random point introduced in the system at iteration @xmath14 , is updated as @xmath15 , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the radii of the system and of the biggest disc or sphere in it , respectively .",
    "third , we also consider the control parameter @xmath6 to vary randomly within a tunable range of values .",
    "in particular , we argue that though a tentative value of constant @xmath6 could be obtained by analyzing samples of gouges in real situations , one expects that a certain range of admissible values for @xmath6 is the most realistic assumption . indeed",
    ", we show that the typical range of fractal dimensions observed in real fault gouges is in this way reproduced .",
    "we start this section by addressing the two - dimensional random space - filling bearing and systematically reviewing the behavior of the packing for different , but fixed , values of @xmath6 and study the effect of fixed initial size ranges ( no maximal admissible polydispersity ) .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] shows for this case the density @xmath18 and cumulative size distribution @xmath19 of two - dimensional random space - filling packings .",
    "figure [ fig3]a shows the density @xmath12 as a function of the number @xmath8 of discs for @xmath20 ( packing ) and also for @xmath21 and @xmath22 ( bearings ) separately , starting from @xmath23 discs with radius in the range @xmath24 $ ] having @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "as expected , the convergence @xmath27 as @xmath8 increases is faster for larger values of @xmath6 .",
    "we consider one fixed initial configuration with @xmath2 initial discs , and therefore the different curves coincide for @xmath28 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig3]b we plot the distribution of the radius @xmath29 of the discs , where @xmath30 is the minimal radius of the initial set of discs , and the deviation from the power law for @xmath31 is due to the initial configuration . below this value @xmath32 ,",
    "the size distribution obeys a power - law @xmath33 , where @xmath10 is the fractal dimension of the packing , plotted in the inset as a function of @xmath6 ( symbols ) .",
    "as one sees from the inset , the fractal dimension typically takes values in the range @xmath34 , differently from the values found in two - dimensional cuts of fault gouges ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "there is a maximum of @xmath10 for @xmath36 that can be explained from the definition of @xmath6 in the algorithm described above .",
    "for an @xmath37 , to each new disc introduced there is a remaining free space characterized by @xmath38 such that @xmath39 , and similarly for @xmath40 .    both figs .",
    "[ fig3]a and [ fig3]b consider the same initial configuration . to study the influence of the initial configurations , we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig3]c the density @xmath18 , fixing @xmath41 , similar to previous works@xcite , and using different size ranges for the initial sets of @xmath23 discs , namely in @xmath42 ,   [ 0.15r,0.20r]$ ] and @xmath43 $ ] , i.e.  ranges with the same width @xmath26 but centered around different values , namely around @xmath44 and @xmath45 respectively .    since different initial configurations are now used , the density is no longer the same below @xmath2 as in fig .",
    "further , one observes that the density converges to one for increasing the value of @xmath46 . in the inset",
    "the density @xmath18 is plotted by fixing @xmath47 and starting with initial configuration having different widths , namely @xmath48 and @xmath49 . in these cases",
    "the density gives always similar dependencies on @xmath8 .",
    "therefore , the average size @xmath46 of the initial configuration is the important parameter to tune the density of the packing .",
    "its width can be varied without changing significantly the results .    in fig .",
    "[ fig3]d we plot the accumulative size distribution @xmath19 of the discs for the same conditions as in fig .",
    "the value of the exponent remains almost constant , @xmath50 .",
    "in other words , the fractal dimension is not very sensitive to the initial configuration , and the parameter on which the fractal dimension depends more strongly must be indeed @xmath6 .",
    "when the value of @xmath6 is chosen according to a power - law @xmath51 in a range @xmath52 $ ] .",
    "although within the error bars , the fractal dimension is somewhat lower compared to fig .",
    "[ fig4]b where the distribution of chosen @xmath6 values is uniform ( see text).,width=321 ]    since @xmath6 is also the parameter controlling the fragmentation of discs with frustrated contacts ( see above ) , we will now study it more deeply .",
    "when @xmath6 is able to vary randomly , the fragmentation of the largest disc in the free holes can be regarded as a random process by its own .",
    "we next consider @xmath6 to be each time randomly selected from a fixed interval @xmath53 $ ] .",
    "we will show that when enabling @xmath6 to take different values for each particle shrinking , one obtains fractal dimensions similar to the ones observed in fault gouges@xcite .    to this end",
    ", we put everything together , namely @xmath6 varying in the middle range of admissible values , a large initial disc and an ensemble average over a significant number of initial configurations . the results for density and size distribution",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , where one considers three initial seeds in the range @xmath54 , with @xmath55 the size of the system and @xmath6 varies randomly in the range @xmath56 $ ] .",
    "averages over a sample of @xmath57 initial configurations .",
    "since initialization , filling and coloring procedure are now all random , we call these systems fully random space - filling bearings",
    ".    figure [ fig4]a shows the density as a function of the number @xmath8 of discs for @xmath58 and @xmath49 .",
    "one sees an abrupt transition above @xmath59 ( initial seeds ) , due to the introduction of the first large disc .",
    "for all the four cases the dependence of @xmath12 on the range of @xmath6-values is similar , with the convergence towards @xmath60 being slightly slower for narrower ranges , because they hinder the occurrence of large discs .",
    "figure [ fig4]b shows the size distribution @xmath19 for each of the four ranges .",
    "all the distributions almost coincide , as shown in the inset where the fractal dimension @xmath10 taken from @xmath61 is almost constant ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "this value is larger than the one obtained when @xmath6 is kept constant ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "notice that the value of the fractal dimension for @xmath63 , though corresponding to the case of constant @xmath36 , is different from the one plotted in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig3]b , since the constructing procedure of the bearing is slightly different ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : prevalg ] ) .",
    "since the above value is obtained from a significantly larger sample of initial configurations and all the parameters @xmath6 and position of the discs are randomly selected , we will consider this value @xmath64 as the characteristic exponent of the size distribution for fully random two - dimensional space filling bearings .",
    "the average characteristic value @xmath64 obtained lies in the range of values measured of the fractal dimension measured in real fault gouges ( @xmath65 )  @xcite , as indicated with a dashed line and shadow region in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig4]b .    till now",
    ", the value of @xmath6 was considered to vary _ uniformly _ within a certain range of values .",
    "if the probability distribution for choosing @xmath6 values is gaussian similar results are obtained , were the standard deviation @xmath66 of the distribution plays a similar role as the width @xmath67 used in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] .    however , if we take values within a range , say @xmath52 $ ] , and chose them according to a power - law distribution @xmath68 the fractal dimension changes significantly , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] . even for small values of the exponent @xmath69 , e.g.  @xmath70",
    ", the fractal dimension decreases when compared to the value obtained for the uniform distribution ( @xmath71 ) and remains approximately constant at @xmath72 .",
    "notice that @xmath71 in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] corresponds to @xmath73 in fig .",
    "if the power - law distribution selects values in a range with a different width , a similar decrease of the fractal dimension is observed when comparing with the uniform distribution case .",
    "therefore , one can conclude that a reasonable choice for constructing space - filling bearings with fractal dimension similar to the one observed in fault gouges is by taking a random value of @xmath6 uniformly distributed in a certain range around @xmath74 .",
    "as described above in sec .  [ sec : prevalg ] , a three - dimensional version of fully random space - filling bearings is obtained in a similar way as for discs with the single difference that the introduction of new spheres takes into account four nearest neighbors . in this section",
    "we address the case of three - dimensional space - filling bearings as a more realistic approach to fault gouges , and study how well the two - dimensional model approximates three - dimensional systems of spheres .     for three - dimensional random space - filling bearings when",
    "@xmath6 is kept constant . a similar procedure as the one illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] is used , with new spheres being introduced touching the _ four _ nearest neighbors ( see text ) .",
    "the dashed line indicates one typical value @xmath75 found in some real fault gouges  @xcite.,width=321 ]        recently  @xcite , it was found that grain fracture simulations produce a comminuted granular material similar to the one observed in real fault gouges . from those simulations",
    ", it followed that comminution rate and survival of large grains is sensitive to applied normal stress , with a fractal dimension of the resultant grain size distributions in the range @xmath76 $ ] , that agrees with the observations of three - dimensional samples of real gouges where typically @xmath75 .    in three dimensional space - filling bearings with a constant value of @xmath6",
    "the fractal dimension lies above the observed values in fault gouges . in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] we plot typical values of @xmath10 as a function of @xmath6 .",
    "the fractal dimension of such bearings is typically larger than @xmath77 ( dashed line ) with values within the range @xmath78 $ ] and , similarly to the two - dimensional case , the maximum of @xmath10 is reached for @xmath79 .",
    "as summarized above in the introduction , it was recently found  @xcite that fractal dimensions @xmath80 are observed for low - strain gouges . in regions subject to larger shear",
    "strain the fractal dimension is significantly larger , @xmath81 .",
    "therefore , the particle size or mass dimensions were proposed as a way to distinguish between regions with different strain strengths  @xcite . from fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , one sees that a similar range of values for the fractal dimension is also found for space - filling bearings .     and",
    "* ( b ) * the corresponding fractal dimension.,width=321 ]    furthermore , the explanation relating the fractal dimension of fault zones and their strain strength assumes that fragmentation is controlled by nearest neighboring particle contact and that a particle is most likely to split into smaller particles with a particle of similar size , yielding a larger fractal dimension @xmath82 . in the case of our construction procedure for space - filling bearings",
    "this would correspond to the case of @xmath79 .",
    "indeed , from fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] one observes that the maximum of the fractal dimension is reached for such @xmath6 values yielding @xmath83 .    when varying @xmath6 randomly in a range around @xmath74 and study the dependence of the space - filling bearing on the width @xmath67 of the range @xmath84 $ ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig7]a one sees that the density increases faster for larger @xmath67 , similarly to what was shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4]a . as for the fractal dimension , fig .",
    "[ fig7]b shows that it decreases slightly when compared with the case of constant @xmath6 ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "therefore , increasing the width @xmath67 of the range of admissible values for @xmath6 one is able to reduce the fractal dimension of the bearing .",
    "similarly to the situation of measures taken in fault gouges , the two - dimensional cross section of such three - dimensional space - filling bearings should have a fractal dimension within the range of the observed empirical values in real fault gouges ( @xmath85  @xcite ) . by averaging several different two dimensional cross sections of the 3d bearings we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig8]a the size distribution of a typical two - dimensional cross section for the different values of @xmath67 . in fig .",
    "[ fig8]b we observe that only for very wide ranges of @xmath6 values it is possible to obtain a fractal dimension similar to the one observed on fault zones .",
    "in this work we studied the size - distribution of random space - filling bearings with large polydispersity , showing that it reproduces well the size - distribution found in fault gouges .",
    "focusing on the dependence of the bearings fractal dimension on the spacing offset , we have shown that the fractal dimensions of such bearings sweep the low range of values observed in real faults . since recently it has been reported that the fractal dimension varies in space along fault gouges@xcite , our findings enables us to conjecture that the occurrence of seismic gaps , where earthquakes are absent and therefore behave similarly to roller bearings , may occur in regions where the fractal dimension lies in the low range of admissible values , namely @xmath86 $ ] .    to compute an accurate value for the exponent characterizing random bearings",
    ", we introduced a general algorithm that allows @xmath6 to vary randomly in a wide range of admissible values , typically @xmath87 and start the space - filling procedure from one unique large disc ( or sphere ) , maximizing the range of admissible sizes in the bearing .    with such model",
    "we were able to show that bearings have a fractal dimension with values within the range of values in real fault . since it is known  @xcite that along a specific fault gouge the fractal dimension varies typically between @xmath88 and @xmath82 , our results support the hypothesis that seismic gaps , occurring only in certain particular locations of the fault , could be explained by this simple geometrical model .",
    "further , we also interpret the control parameter @xmath6 for the bearing property as a measure of the fragmentation strength , and introduce simple criteria to improve the computational efficiency of previous space - filling packing algorithms .    to improve further our findings we should also take the effect of gravity into account .",
    "moreover , concerning the space - filling bearings by themselves , other questions raise , namely their contact network correlations , which should help to understand the range of observed fractal dimensions .",
    "these and other points will be addressed elsewhere .",
