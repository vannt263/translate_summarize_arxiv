    "for explaining accelerated expansion of the universe , there is a class of models in which one modifies the laws of gravity whereby a late - time acceleration is produced .",
    "a family of these modified gravity models is obtained by replacing the ricci scalar @xmath2 in the usual einstein - hilbert lagrangian density for some functions @xmath0",
    "@xcite @xcite .",
    "it is well - known that @xcite @xcite the gravitational field equations derived from such fourth order gravity models can be conformally transformed to an einstein frame representation with an extra scalar degree of freedom .",
    "this scalar degree of freedom may be regarded as a manifestation of the additional degree of freedom due to the higher order of the field equations in the jordan frame .",
    "this feature opens some questions about a possible correspondence between this geometric scalar field and the usual scalar fields such as quintessence and phantom fields . along this line",
    ", we intend in the present contribution to explore phantom behavior of some @xmath0 gravity models in both jordan and einstein conformal frames . in particular , we shall show that behaviors of the scalar field attributed to @xmath0 models are similar to those of a coupled quintessence , a quintessence which interacts with the matter sector .",
    "+ the plan of our paper is as follows : in section 2 , we consider the cosmology of a scalar field with minimal coupling to gravity .",
    "we review the observation that a quintessence field with a minimal coupling can not lead to crossing the phantom boundary . in section 3",
    ", we shall consider @xmath0 gravity in both jordan and einstein conformal frames .",
    "we show that the generic feature of these models is that the scalar partner of the metric tensor in the einstein frame is similar to a quintessence rather than a phantom field .",
    "the interaction of this scalar degree of freedom with the matter sector plays a key role for crossing the phantom barrier @xcite .",
    "we then compare phantom behavior of some viable @xmath0 models in the two conformal frames .",
    "our results are summarized in section 4 .",
    "the simplest class of models that provides a redshift dependent equation of state parameter is a scalar field @xmath3 minimally coupled to gravity whose dynamics is determined by a properly chosen potential function @xmath4 .",
    "such models are described by the action and the signature is @xmath5 . ]",
    "@xmath6 where @xmath7 with @xmath8 being the gravitational constant , @xmath9 is the determinant of @xmath10 and @xmath2 is the curvature scalar . here",
    "@xmath11 is the action of dark matter which depends on the metric @xmath10 and some dark matter fields @xmath12 .",
    "the constant @xmath13 can take @xmath14 which correspond to quintessence and phantom fields , respectively .",
    "the distinguished feature of the phantom field is that its kinetic term enters ( [ ca1 ] ) with opposite sign in contrast to the quintessence or ordinary matter .",
    "the action ( [ ca1 ] ) gives the einstein field equations @xmath15 with @xmath16 here @xmath17 is the stress - tensor of the matter system defined by @xmath18 the two stress - tensors @xmath19 and @xmath20 are separately conserved @xmath21 we assume a spatially flat homogeneous and isotropic cosmology described by friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) spacetime @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the scale factor . in this cosmology ,",
    "the gravitational field equations ( [ ca2 ] ) become @xmath24 @xmath25 \\label{a09}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 is the hubble parameter and @xmath27 @xmath28 the conservation equations ( [ aa3 ] ) take the form @xmath29 @xmath30 in the case of a quintessence field ( @xmath31 ) with @xmath32 the equation of state parameter remains in the range @xmath33 .",
    "this is also true for a phantom field ( @xmath34 ) with a negative potential @xmath35 . in the limit of small kinetic term ( slow - roll potentials @xcite ) ,",
    "it approaches @xmath36 but does not cross this line . for @xmath31",
    ", we have @xmath37 the phantom barrier can be crossed by a phantom field ( @xmath38 ) with @xmath32 when we have @xmath39 .",
    "this situation corresponds to @xmath40 in this case , @xmath41 and for a sufficiently negative pressure @xmath42 the equation ( [ a09 ] ) gives @xmath43 .",
    "let us look at this situation in a different way .",
    "we combine ( [ a09 ] ) with ( [ ab1 ] ) and ( [ ab2 ] ) which leads to @xmath44 in an expanding universe @xmath45 . in the case of a quintessence @xmath46 and",
    "then the equation ( [ ab2 ] ) implies that @xmath47 which leads to @xmath48 .",
    "on the other hand , for a phantom field we have @xmath38 and @xmath41 . in this case ,",
    "@xmath49 and for an appropriate potential function @xmath4 the first term on the right hand side of the equation ( [ a19 ] ) dominates and the equation then results in @xmath43 , crossing the phantom barrier .",
    "the merit of ( [ a19 ] ) is that it implicitly shows that there is a possibility for an interacting quintessence field to cross the phantom boundary .",
    "we will return to this issue in the next section .",
    "+ here it is assumed that the scalar field has a canonical kinetic term @xmath50 .",
    "it is shown @xcite that any minimally coupled scalar field with a generalized kinetic term ( k - essence lagrangian @xcite ) can not lead to crossing the pdl through a stable trajectory",
    ". however , there are models that employ lagrangians containing multiple fields @xcite or scalar fields with non - minimal coupling @xcite which in principle can achieve crossing the barrier .",
    "the @xmath0 gravity models are based on a lagrangian density which depends in a nonlinear way on the curvature scalar . in these models",
    "the dynamical variable of the vacuum sector is the metric tensor and the corresponding field equations are fourth order .",
    "this dynamical variable can be replaced by a new pair which consists of a conformally rescaled metric and a scalar partner . moreover , in terms of the new set of variables the field equations are those of general relativity .",
    "the original set of variables is commonly called jordan conformal frame and the transformed set whose dynamics is described by einstein field equations is called einstein conformal frame . + in general , the mathematical equivalence of these two conformal frames does not imply a physical equivalence .",
    "the physical status of these conformal frames is an open question which has not been completely solved yet .",
    "in fact , there are different categories according to various authors attitude towards the issue of which frame is the physical one @xcite @xcite . based on the interaction of the scalar degree of freedom with the matter sector , some authors argue that the two conformal frames are physically equivalent provided that one accepts the idea that the units of mass , length and time are varying in the einstein frame @xcite . according to this idea , physics must be conformally invariant and symmetry group of gravitational theories should be enlarged to include not only the group of diffeomorphisms but also conformal transformations .",
    "there are also arguments against this idea and in favor of one of the conformal frames .",
    "in particular , some authors go beyond mere theoretical arguments and take an appropriate phenomenon to determine if the two frames are physically equivalent @xcite .",
    "+ one important issue in the context of cosmological viability of an @xmath0 gravity model is capability of the model to exhibit phantom behavior due to curvature corrections .",
    "we shall explore this issue in both jordan and einstein conformal frames and take it as a relevant issue to distinguish the physical status of the two conformal frames .",
    "the action for an @xmath0 gravity theory in the jordan frame is given by @xmath51 stability issues should be considered to make sure that an @xmath0 model is viable @xcite . in particular ,",
    "stability in matter sector ( the dolgov - kawasaki instability @xcite ) imposes some conditions on the functional form of @xmath0 models .",
    "these conditions require that the first and the second derivatives of @xmath0 functions with respect to the ricci scalar @xmath2 should be positive definite .",
    "the positivity of the first derivative ensures that the scalar degree of freedom is not tachyonic and positivity of the second derivative tells us that graviton is not a ghost .",
    "+ the field equations can be derived by varying the action with respect to the metric tensor @xmath52 where prime denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath2 .",
    "the trace of ( [ a2 ] ) is @xmath53 where @xmath54 .",
    "it should be noted that when @xmath55 , the equation ( [ a4 ] ) reduces to @xmath56 which is the corresponding trace equation in general relativity . in @xmath0 gravity ,",
    "@xmath57 does not vanish and contrary to general relativity the ricci scalar relates differentially to the trace of the matter system .",
    "this is an indication of the fact that one finds a larger variety of solutions in @xmath0 modified gravity models .",
    "+ the field equations can also be written in the following form @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 \\label{a6}\\ ] ] we apply the field equations to a spatially flat frw spacetime described by ( [ aa7 ] ) . we assume that the matter system is described by a pressureless perfect fluid with energy density @xmath61 .",

    "this expression allows us to find those @xmath0 functions that fulfill @xmath67 . in general ,",
    "to find such @xmath0 gravity models one may start with a particular @xmath0 function in the action ( [ a1 ] ) and solve the corresponding field equations for finding the form of @xmath68 .",
    "one can then use this function in ( [ a12 ] ) to obtain @xmath69 .",
    "however , this approach is not efficient in view of complexity of the field equations .",
    "an alternative approach is to start from the best fit parametrization @xmath68 obtained directly from data and use this @xmath68 for a particular @xmath0 function in ( [ a12 ] ) to find @xmath69 . in this approach",
    ", one needs a consistency check to ensure that the given parametrization is compatible with the @xmath0 function .",
    "we will follow the latter approach to find @xmath0 models that provide crossing the phantom barrier .",
    "we begin with the hubble parameter @xmath70 which its derivative with respect to cosmic time @xmath71 is @xmath72 combining this with the definition of the deceleration parameter @xmath73 gives @xmath74 one may use @xmath75 with @xmath76 being the redshift , and the relation ( [ b12 ] ) to write ( [ bb13 ] ) in its integration form @xmath77 \\label{bc14}\\ ] ] where the subscript  0 \" indicates the present value of a quantity .",
    "now if a function @xmath78 is given , then we can find evolution of the hubble parameter .",
    "here we use a two - parametric reconstruction function characterizing @xmath78 @xcite@xcite , @xmath79 one of the advantages of this parametrization is that @xmath80 when @xmath81 which is consistent with observations .",
    "moreover , the behavior of q(z ) in this parametrization is quite general . if @xmath82 and @xmath83",
    ", then there is no acceleration at all .",
    "it is also possible that the universe has been accelerating since some time in the past . if @xmath84 and @xmath85 , then it is possible that the universe is decelerating and has past acceleration and deceleration .",
    "in other words , it has the same behavior as the simple three - epoch model used in @xcite @xcite .",
    "the values of @xmath86 and @xmath87 and the behavior of @xmath78 can be obtained by fitting the model to the observational data .",
    "fitting this model to the gold data set gives @xmath88 and @xmath89 @xcite .",
    "using this in ( [ bc14 ] ) yields @xmath90 \\label{bc16}\\ ] ] for the metric ( [ aa7 ] ) , we have @xmath91 and therefore @xmath92 . in terms of the deceleration parameter ,",

    "attributed to these parameters , the model ( [ a13 ] ) is divided in three cases @xcite .",
    "firstly , when @xmath108 there is a stable matter - dominated era which does not follow by an asymptotically accelerated regime . in this case , @xmath109 corresponds to starobinsky s inflation and the accelerated phase exists in the asymptotic past rather than in the future .",
    "secondly , when @xmath110 there is a stable matter - dominated era followed by an accelerated phase only for @xmath111 . finally , in the case that @xmath112 there is no accelerated and matter - dominated phases for @xmath113 and @xmath111 , respectively . thus the model ( [ a13 ] ) is cosmologically viable in the regions of the parameters space which is given by @xmath111 and @xmath110 .",

    "<S> we study capability of @xmath0 gravity models to allow crossing the phantom boundary in both jordan and einstein conformal frames . in einstein frame , these models are equivalent to einstein gravity together with a scalar field minimally coupled to gravity . </S>",
    "<S> this scalar degree of freedom appears as a quintessence field with a coupling with the matter sector . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate evolution of the equation of sate parameter for some cosmologically viable @xmath0 gravity models in both conformal frames . </S>",
    "<S> this investigation ( beyond mere theoretical arguments ) acts as an operational tool to distinguish physical status of the two conformal frames . </S>",
    "<S> it shows that the two conformal frames have not the same physical status .    </S>",
