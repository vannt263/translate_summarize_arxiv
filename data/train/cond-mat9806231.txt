    "superconducting films and two - dimensional ( 2d ) josephson junction arrays as well as @xmath8he films undergo kosterlitz - thouless ( kt ) type transitions from the superconducting / superfluid to the normal state .",
    "@xcite the kt transition is driven by thermally created vortex - antivortex pairs which start to unbind at the transition .",
    "@xcite this means that some dominant characteristic features of the physics close to the transition are associated with vortex pair fluctuations .",
    "the great current interest in 2d vortex fluctuations stems from the fact that they are also present in high-@xmath9 superconductors , not only in the case of thin films , but also in 3d samples just above the transition .",
    "@xcite it is therefore of interest to understand the properties associated with these thermally created vortices . whereas there is a fairly good consensus on the static properties associated with vortex pair fluctuations ,  @xcite the dynamical aspects are less clear and some features are still controversial .",
    "the knowledge of the dynamical properties of vortex fluctuations mainly comes from experiments on superconducting films and @xmath8he films ,  @xcite and from various model simulations .",
    "@xcite the theoretical attempts are so far on a rather phenomenological level  @xcite with few exceptions .",
    "@xcite the more explicit knowledge derives from several kinds of simulations : @xmath0 models with time dependent ginzburg - landau ( tdgl ) dynamics ,  @xcite @xmath0 models with resistively shunted josephson junction ( rsj ) dynamics ,  @xcite the coulomb gas model with langevin dynamics ,  @xcite and the lattice coulomb gas model with monte carlo dynamics .",
    "@xcite there exist two phenomenological descriptions : the ambegaokar - halperin - nelson - siggia ( ahns ) description  @xcite and the minnhagen phenomenology ( mp ) .",
    "@xcite there are , likewise , two distinct proposals for the nonlinear @xmath5 exponent @xmath6 , i.e. , @xmath10 ( ref .  ) and @xmath11 ( ref .  ) with a corresponding proposal for a critical dynamical exponent @xmath12 ( ref .  ) in the low - temperature phase .",
    "it has also been argued that the nonlinear @xmath5 exponent with the value @xmath11 applies to an intermediate current range whereas @xmath10 should be recovered in the true small - current limit .",
    "@xcite this argument rests on the assumption that for any finite current there are free vortices present and furthermore that these free vortices can be described by a conventional dynamics with @xmath13 .",
    "@xcite    in this paper we present extensive simulations of 2d @xmath0 models with rsj as well as tdgl dynamics using an unconventional boundary condition .",
    "this enables us to obtain more information on the vortex dynamics for these models .",
    "the situation is roughly the following : the mp form of the dynamical response gives a good description of the 2d @xmath0 models with tdgl dynamics ,  @xcite the coulomb gas model with langevin dynamics ,  @xcite and experiments on 2d superconductors .",
    "@xcite in the present paper we show that it also gives a good description of 2d @xmath0 models with rsj dynamics .",
    "the dynamical exponent @xmath1 for the lattice coulomb gas with monte carlo dynamics has from simulations been inferred to have the scaling value @xmath12 .",
    "@xcite in the present paper we verify this result for the @xmath0 models with both rsj and tdgl dynamics .",
    "this is seemingly in contradiction to the results in ref .   that the 2d @xmath0 models with rsj and tdgl dynamics behave differently and appear to have different @xmath1 values . the nonlinear @xmath5 exponent",
    "@xmath6 has been found to have the scaling value @xmath11 for the coulomb gas with langevin dynamics  @xcite and the lattice coulomb gas with monte carlo dynamics .",

    "@xmath15 in ref .  .",
    "in the present paper we find support for @xmath15 for the 2d @xmath0 model with rsj dynamics .",
    "the picture emerging from our perspective is a generic vortex response well described by the mp form of the frequency response , the scaling exponent @xmath11 and the corresponding dynamical exponent @xmath12 . according to our view this generic vortex response describes both coulomb gas models and 2d @xmath0 models and is insensitive to the detailed type of the dynamics",

    "this particular interaction would , e.g. , arise if each lattice point was a small superconducting island which was josephson coupled to its nearest neighbors , and the system is called a josephson junction array ( jja ) .",

    "@xcite however , since the 2d @xmath0 model with rsj dynamics is generally accepted as a valid model for a 2d josephson junction array , the present investigation ties the mp form found in the present and previous simulations closer to the mp form found in experiments .",
    "@xcite    we found the critical exponent @xmath13 at the kt transition from the finite - size scaling of the resistance @xmath305 using the fluctuating twist boundary condition ftbc , both in case of rsj and tdgl dynamics .",
    "furthermore , we found the same value of @xmath1 for rsj and tdgl for all temperatures below the transition using the same method .",
    "however , we also found that the finite - size scaling with pbc gave different results .",
    "thus it appears as if the finite - size scaling determination of @xmath1 depends on the boundary condition .",
    "our conclusion is that it fails for pbc because the characteristic time @xmath84 is inversely proportional to the resistance @xmath305 and for pbc the resistance @xmath305 is identically zero for any finite size .",
    "this suggests that the proper value of @xmath1 can not be determined from finite - size scaling with pbc .",
    "the exponent @xmath1 determined from the finite - size scaling with ftbc were found to be the same for rsj and tdgl dynamics and to support the scaling prediction @xmath397 in agreement with what was found in ref .",
    "for the 2d lattice coulomb gas with monte carlo dynamics .",
    "we also explicitly showed that the exponent @xmath1 determined from the finite - size scaling of @xmath305 is related directly to a diverging relaxation time .",
    "thus our conclusion is that @xmath1 is larger than 2 below the kt transition .",
    "this result is in agreement with the model discussed in ref .  .",
    "@xcite using a scaling argument ,  @xcite we related the finite - size scaling of @xmath305 to the nonlinear @xmath5 characteristics by noting that the current density @xmath328 plays the role of @xmath398 leading to @xmath399 with @xmath7 .",
    "consequently , provided the scaling argument is valid , our simulations support the prediction @xmath400 .",
    "@xcite    we also calculated the @xmath5 exponent @xmath6 directly from the voltage @xmath115 as a function of current @xmath116 .",
    "here we found that the results were strongly size dependent .",
    "this large size dependence we found for standard current injection boundary , ftbc , and the `` busbar '' boundary condition introduced in ref .  . for our largest lattice sizes",
    "@xmath401 a size - converged result could only be estimated for currents which seemed to be outside the true scaling regime @xmath108 .",
    "however , by using the relation @xmath346 valid for small enough @xmath328 we showed that the data for the resistance simulation @xmath372 and the @xmath5 simulations @xmath402 can be made to fall on a single curve for an appropriate choice of the constant @xmath371 .",
    "this agreement suggests that our @xmath5 simulations and our @xmath372 simulations are consistent with each other and with the scaling assumption .",
    "we concluded that it is difficult to obtain the nonlinear @xmath5 exponent @xmath6 directly from the @xmath403 data in case of the 2d @xmath0 model with rsj dynamics .",
    "this is because resistance ratios @xmath404 ( @xmath149 is the junction resistance ) seem to be needed .",
    "this in turn implies such small currents that lattice sizes considerably larger than @xmath401 are required to avoid the finite - size effects .",
    "however , in case of the 2d coulomb gas with langevin dynamics  @xcite it has been possible to converge the simulations closer to where the true scaling @xmath108 appears to be valid and in these cases the scaling exponent @xmath400 was deduced from the @xmath403 data .",
    "finally , we showed that all our @xmath5 data and our @xmath372 data for a fixed temperature collapse onto a single scaling curve @xmath405 .",
    "this data collapse demonstrates that the scaling argument is indeed valid over a broad parameter range and thus confirms that the nonlinear @xmath5 exponent is given by @xmath406 over the parameter range covered by our data .",
    "this does not preclude the possibility that , for smaller currents and larger sizes than we have been able to converge , there might be a deviation from the scaling curve given in fig .",
    "[ fig14 ] as suggested by the model in ref .  . however , there is no sign of any deviation from the scaling curve in our data for the rsj model .    in short ,",
    "the present simulations of the 2d @xmath0 model with rsj dynamics confirm the picture that 2d vortex fluctuations has an anomalous kind of dynamics .",
    "the characteristic features of this dynamics are presumably linked to the logarithmic vortex interaction .",
