    "the role played by the space  time and charge conjugation symmetries in fundamental interactions remain to be one set of the central questions in modern physics . among them , the time reversal transformation ( t ) is a particularly subtle problem ( see , e.g. , ref .",

    "together with a complex conjugation can be defined .",
    "this is because the particles are not allowed to travel backward in time in quantum field theory , which specifies that the particles and their antiparticles ( and/or holes ) have to travel forward in time .",
    "other reasons for the needs of such a revisit of the question of time reversal are given in the main text .",
    "the above mentioned restriction of quantum field theories maybe is of no physical significance if the time reversal invariance is respected .",
    "but it is known that the time reversal invariance should be violated in fundamental interactions according to the observed @xmath1 violation in the neutral kaon system when @xmath0 is assumed to be an exact symmetry .",
    "the recent experimental discoveries of the causal @xcite and the motion @xcite time reversal invariance violations in the neutral kaon system make a more detailed analysis of the problems involved in the time reversal and the @xmath0 invariance timely .",
    "the phenomenological implications of the theoretical suggestion that @xmath1 is spontaneously violated in the metastable ( or virtual ) color superconducting phase of the strong interaction vacuum state @xcite ( see section [ app : colorsuperc ] ) needs to be clarified concerning whether the time reversal or the @xmath0 symmetry is kept in such a case .",
    "therefore such an analysis is carried out in the context of an understanding of relativistic matters in particle / nuclear physics with finite matter and/or energy density that underlies a variety of the currently interested topics in high energy physics and astrophysics / cosmology .",
    "a theoretical attempt is proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite , which is adopted to investigate the nucleon structure @xcite , the nucleon stability and @xmath2 term problems @xcite where several of the novel ingredients of the local theory are shown to be essential for a solution of the problems .",
    "one of the basis of the framework , namely the 8-component representation for fermions , has not been discussed in enough details .",
    "its relation to the enforcement of @xmath0 invariance is not yet explicitly revealed .",
    "this work formalizes the 8-component theory into a more complete quantum field theory .",
    "a solution of the above mentioned problems related to time reversal is expected to be found in a two dimensional representation of time reversal transformation @xcite .",
    "it should be put forward in a more systematic and quantitative way in addition to the existing ones in our earlier publications @xcite .",
    "the possibility of considering a two dimensional representation of time reversal was discussed early by wigner @xcite .",
    "later works in that direction were published in refs .",
    "a different realization of the two dimensional representation of the time reversal transformation is derived in this work based on the physical and conceptual requirements considered here .",
    "there is another thread of reasoning that leads us to the consideration of the 8-component representation for fermions .",
    "relative simple calculations reveal that new divergences in a quantum field theory occur when it is used to handle finite density problems .",
    "these additional divergences make the corresponding theory ambiguous in such situations .",
    "it also violates the lorentz covariance .",
    "arbitrary subtractions of those unwanted infinite quantities need to be introduced to define a finite theory that is physically sensible .",
    "but such a procedure reduces the predictive power and spoils the lorentz covariance of the theory .",
    "the question is can such a problem be solved ?    to deal with these type of new divergences , one can either stick to the theoretical frame - work valid at zero density and straightforwardly extend the theory to the finite density case by subtracting those infinities regarded as non - physical .",
    "such an approach has a long history and it works .",
    "the perturbation theory for interacting finite density quantum field theories were fully developed in the past using the 4-component representation for the fermions in the euclidean space - time .",
    "related papers are too numerous to list here .",
    "some of the standard problems are studied systematically and to great details .",
    "one of the representatives of them can be found in , e.g. , refs .",
    "there are problems left unanswered by these works concerning the fermion determinant at finite density in the minkowski space - time version of the theory .",
    "these problems are related to how to subtract the infinite contributions of the unphysical dirac sea .",
    "it is found that the dirac sea contributions can not be subtract away once for all at the level of vanishing background fields or zero density in the 4-component representation of the fermions .",
    "they manifest themselves when one tries to make a connection between the euclidean and minkowski version of the same theory at finite density .    or , one can , provided it is possible at all , embed certain new theoretical structures into the existing framework of quantum field theory in which some of old the divergences that one encounters in the finite density cases are absent automatically .",
    "the particular candidate that is going to be studied here is the @xmath0 mirror partner hypothesis @xcite for each particle that solves the above mentioned difficulties concerning time reversal transformation .",
    "the theoretical gain is of at least two folds : the first one is the reduction of independent hidden assumptions of the theory and the second one is the possibility of making new physical predictions that can be tested experimentally under conditions when specific and/or concrete empirical knowledge is still lacking .",
    "let us for the moment value such an increase of the predictive power of the theory more than a straightforward extension of theory that is only well test at zero density and in non - relativistic situations by trying to find out what an alternative , which is identical to the well established ones at zero density and in non - relativistic situations , can be derived and what is its implications .",
    "it is also quite interesting to see whether or not the resulting quantum field theories derived following the above mentioned two threads of reasoning are actually the same one .    a two dimensional representation of the time reversal transformation is introduced in section [ sec:8comptheory ] , which implies an 8-component representation for the fermion fields .",
    "the representation of parity @xmath3 , charge conjugation @xmath4 and @xmath0 transformations in the 8-component theory for fermions is discussed .",
    "the reality condition , which is consistent with the @xmath0 invariance is discussed in more details . the representation of any internal symmetries for the fermionic particle in the 8-component theory",
    "is provided .",
    "the proper fermion propagator that is consistent with the reality condition is derived .",
    "the question of how to construct interaction terms in the 8-component theory for fermions is studied in the last part of this section .",
    "it is shown that @xmath0 violating theory can in principle be constructed in the 8-component theory . in section [ sec : fdqft ] , another thread of reasoning that is in favor of the 8-component theory is provided by doing a technical analysis of the problems of the 4-component theory for fermions as compared to the 8-component one in the finite density situations when one tries to connect the euclidean form of the theory to its minkowski correspondence .",
    "it is shown that the divergent contributions contained in the 4-component theory is absent in the 8-component one .",
    "the problems of the 4-component theory is further exposed as one tries to relate local observables computed in different lorentz frame .",
    "it is shown that such a problem is absent in the 8-component theory . in addition , the practically useful framework of the imaginary- and real- time thermal field theory in the 8-component theory is established .",
    "the quantization of the 8-component theory is provided in section [ sec : particle ] following the formal rules of quantum field theory .",
    "the time reversal transformation of the quantized 8-component fermion field operator is discussed .",

    "the metastability at zero density and the cpt invariance of the color superconducting phase are established based on the 8-component theory .",
    "a summary and discussion is given in section [ sec : sum ] .",
    "the reversal of time in quantum mechanics involves not only an unitary transformation but also a complex conjugation @xcite .",
    "this is because unitary representation of the time reversal transformation is inconsistent with well established notions in physics which require that the ( space - time ) coordinate and the 4-momentum of the system transform in an opposite way .",
    "such an anti - unitary transformation is different from the ordinary unitary transformations connected to other symmetries of the system in some subtle ways , which has to be studied in more details to explore new possibilities .    for a particle with internal degrees of freedom corresponding to certain ordinary symmetry transformations",
    ", the time reversal transformation of it has to be so constructed as not to be inconsistent with these symmetry transformations since the action of complex conjugation transforms a particle belonging to a representation @xmath5 of certain symmetry group into the conjugate representation @xmath6 of it , which is not always equivalent to the original one .",
    "this causes conceptual problems since , on the one hand , a particle belongs to a representation of a symmetry group and its antiparticle belongs to the conjugate representation , on the other hand , the time reversal transformation is designed to generate from a particle state another state which is also a particle .",
    "thus the time reversed particle ( or antiparticle ) appears to has no state to stay in !",
    "albeit on the practical level studied so far , this conceptual problem rarely cause problems in observables that are even under time reversal .",
    "this is because the physical observables like the currents always belong to the self - conjugate adjoint representation of a symmetry group , which gives an equivalent representation between the original and time reversed states .",
    "it is still a challenge to search for a consistent way to solve this conceptual problem related to our abstract notion of `` state '' for a particle ( or antiparticle ) by introducing a @xmath0 mirror state for each relativistic particles that maps into one another under the time reversal transformation .",
    "the lorentz group is covered by @xmath7 with @xmath8 the group of all complex @xmath9 matrices with unit determinant .",
    "the spinor representation of the lorentz group is also the representation of the @xmath7 group , which , like the @xmath10 group , is self - conjugate with a common metric tensor @xmath11 for both @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the the spinor representation of the lorentz group is provided by a pair of two component spinors , @xmath14 and @xmath15 that transform under the action of the matrices belonging to @xmath12 and @xmath13 respectively .",
    "as far as the time reversal transformation is concerned , the lorentz spinors @xmath14 and @xmath15 behave in a similar way as the 2-component spinor for spatial rotation @xcite .",
    "if only one pair of the lorentz spinors @xmath14 and @xmath15 is considered , the time reversal transformation should be    [ eq : t - rev - philr ] @xmath16    where @xmath17 is an arbitrary phase , in order to be consistent with the lorentz covariance . here",
    "the superscript `` * '' denotes complex conjugation .",
    "a success of two time reversal transformations of @xmath18 returns the negative of it no - matter what value @xmath17 takes .",
    "in addition , one has the above mentioned problems associated with the belonging of the representation for a time reversed particle when the representation is not self - conjugate .",
    "the solution to this problem , as it is discussed above , is to introduce two spinors @xmath19 and @xmath20 to represent the time reversal transformation in a way that is lorentz covariant    [ eq : t - rev2-psilr ] @xmath21    the `` left '' and `` right '' handed @xmath19 and @xmath20 belong to mutually conjugate representations of its internal symmetry groups , if present .",
    "it can be seen that the complex conjugation involved in the one dimensional representation of the time reversal transformation given by eqs .",

    "these kinds of situations arise in strong interaction at the mean field level , in the vicinity of a small charge carrier like a heavy ion @xcite , or in numerical simulations of gauge field where all kinds of relevant gauge field configurations are generated .",
