    "the first evidence for a new kind of long - lived isomeric states was obtained in actinide fractions @xcite produced via secondary reactions in a cern w target which had been irradiated with 24-gev protons @xcite .",
    "isomeric states with t@xmath5 @xmath6 0.6 y and @xmath7 30 d ( 10@xmath8 - 10@xmath9 times longer than the expected half - lives of the corresponding ground states ) were found in neutron - deficient @xmath10am and @xmath10bk nuclei , respectively . about 3x10@xmath9 atoms of @xmath10am and 4x10@xmath8 atoms of @xmath10bk",
    "were produced in the isomeric states , and decayed by the @xmath11 or electron capture processes .",
    "the character of these states was not clear : they are far from closed shells where high spin isomers are usually found , and they have very long lifetimes as compared to the known shape isomers .",
    "in addition @xcite , some new particle groups were found in the decay of various actinide fractions separated from the same w target .",
    "for example , an unambiguous 5.14 mev @xmath4-particle group with t@xmath5 @xmath6 4 y was seen in the bk source @xcite .",
    "this half - life is a factor of 2x10@xmath12 ",
    "3x10@xmath13 too short @xcite for the normal @xmath4-decay of bk  pu nuclei .",
    "it was very difficult to understand such an enhancement .",
    "furthermore , 3.0 and 4.0 mev particle groups were seen from the am source in coincidence with l@xmath14 x - rays in the am region @xcite . since the relationship between the particle energies and their lifetimes deviate by about 23 and 12 orders @xcite from the systematics @xcite of @xmath4-particles , it was assumed @xcite that they were protons of unknown origin .",
    "the clue to the understanding of the above mentioned findings has been obtained recently in several studies @xcite of the @xmath15o + @xmath16au reaction at e@xmath2 = 80 mev , where similar isomeric states and particle decays were found .",
    "an isomeric state which decays by emitting a 5.20 mev @xmath4-particle with t@xmath5 @xmath6 90 m has been found in @xmath17fr .",
    "since this half - life is longer than the known half - life of the ground state of @xmath17fr , it was concluded that a long - lived isomeric state had been formed in this nucleus .",
    "a t@xmath5 of 90 m for 5.20 mev @xmath4-particles in @xmath17fr is enhanced by a factor of 3x10@xmath9 as compared to normal transitions @xcite .",
    "however , this group was observed in coincidence with @xmath3-rays which fit predictions for a super - deformed band @xcite .",
    "therefore the effect of large deformations of the nucleus on the @xmath4-particle decay was calculated and found @xcite to be consistent with the observed enhancement .",
    "it was argued @xcite that since the isomeric state decays to a high spin state , it should also have high spin , and since it decays by enhanced @xmath4-particle emission to state(s ) in the second well of the potential , it should be in the second well itself .",
    "the predicted @xcite excitation energies of the second minima in the evaporation residue nuclei and their daughters produced by the @xmath15o+@xmath16au reaction are above the proton separation energies .",
    "therefore a search for long - lived proton decays has been performed @xcite using the same reaction .",
    "two long - lived proton activities with half - lives of about 6 h and 70 h were found @xcite with proton energies of 1.5  4.8 mev with a sharp line at 2.19 mev .",
    "this energy may correspond to a predicted transition @xcite from the second minimum in @xmath18tl to the ground state of @xmath16hg with e@xmath19 = 2.15 mev .",
    "the superdeformed state in @xmath18tl may be produced in an alpha decay chain of transitions from shape isomeric states to shape isomeric states starting from @xmath17fr .",
    "it should be noted that a long - lived high - spin isomeric state in the second minimum of the potential in @xmath20pu has been predicted by s. g. nilsson et al .",

    "this is quite high as compared to 3.9 @xcite or 5.0 @xcite mev predicted for the second minimum , and may indicate that the origin of the isomeric state in this case is different .",
    "the most striking result is the @xmath4-particle group around 8.6 mev which was found in coincidence with sdb transitions ( figs . 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , and table 2a ) .",
    "as mentioned above the appearance of @xmath3-transitions between half - integer spins shows that most of these transitions are in an odd a nucleus , where @xmath52rn and its daughters are most probable candidates from the reaction kinematic point of view .",

    "however in the first case the energy of 8.6 mev is much larger than the predicted 3.3 mev in @xmath53hg@xmath81 @xmath51 @xmath54pt@xmath81 transition @xcite , and 6.3 @xcite or 6.9@xcite in @xmath52rn@xmath81 @xmath51 @xmath78po@xmath81 transition . on the other hand in the second case of an @xmath4-transition from the second minimum to normal states ,",
    "the @xmath4-particle lifetime will most probably be retarded , and the 8.6 mev @xmath4-particles will not be in coincidence within 1 @xmath27s with the sdb transitions .",
    "( furthermore , the predicted transition energy from the second minimum to the ground state in @xmath53hg@xmath81 @xmath51 @xmath54pt@xmath85 is about 7.2 mev @xcite and in @xmath52rn@xmath81 @xmath51 @xmath78po@xmath85 is 6.3 @xcite or 6.9 mev @xcite .",
    "these values are also not in accord with the experimental value of 8.6 mev ) .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to assume that the 8.6 mev @xmath4-particles decay first and then are followed by the sdb @xmath3-rays , similar to the situation in all the other cases discussed above .",
    "let us first consider the case where the isomeric state is in the second well of the parent nucleus which decays by the 8.6 mev @xmath4-particles to the sdb in the daughter .",
    "one faces here two problems , namely the very large hindrance factor of the @xmath4-particles , and their high energy .",
    "the hindrance factor of the @xmath4-particles is in the range of 10@xmath15 ( t@xmath5 @xmath6 40 d as compared to the predicted value of 1.4 x 10@xmath86 s assuming @xmath76@xmath87 = 0.7 @xcite ) .",
    "as for the energy , if , for instance , the 8.6 mev @xmath4-particles decay to a sdb state of spin 27/2 in @xmath54pt at e@xmath48 = 865  kev ( e@xmath88 = 4.42 kev ) , and taking into account the predicted excitation energy of the second minimum in @xmath54pt at about 4.1 mev @xcite , and the q@xmath89(g.s.@xmath51g.s . )",
    "value for @xmath53hg of 2.190 mev @xcite , the isomeric state in @xmath53hg turns out to be at about 11.6 mev above the g.s . assuming an excitation energy of the second minimum in @xmath53hg of about 5.2 mev @xcite , the above energy of 11.6 mev corresponds to an excitation energy of about 6.4 mev above the second minimum , which seems unlikely .",
    "( in the same way , about 5.0 and 3.0 mev excitation energies above the second minimum are respectively deduced for more neutron - rich hg isotopes and for @xmath52rn , which is unlikely as well . )",
    "it seems reasonable to conclude that the large hindrance factor might be due to another barrier transition , as , for instance , from the third well ( the hyper - deformed well ) @xcite to the second one.cm at @xmath90 = 0.63 and e@xmath48 = 8.2 mev , using hartree - fock calculations @xcite . ]",
    "it should be mentioned that an extrapolated value of about 11.5 mev is obtained for the excitation energy of the third minimum in @xmath53hg from the predictions of ref .",
    "this value is in accord with the deduced value mentioned above of about 11.6 mev",
    ".- events of 6 - 7 mev discussed in section iv.b .",
    "above is unlikely to be due to transitions from the third minimum , as its predicted excitation energy of about 18.8 mev ( extrapolated from ref.@xcite ) comes out far from the data of 7.8 or 10.3 mev ( table 3 ) . ]",
    "the large production cross section of the isomeric state which decays by the 8.6 mev @xmath4-particles of about 130 nb , as compared to the production of the isomeric states in the second minima of a few nb ( see table 1 ) , may also indicate that its origin is from the third minimum , which can presumably be produced more easily at bombarding energies below the coulomb barrier .",
    "it is also seen in table 1 that while the highest cross section for the production of the normal evaporation residue nuclei is about a factor of 60 larger at 135 mev as compared to 125 mev , the production of the isomeric states in the second minima is about the same at these two bombarding energies , whereas there is an exceptionally large cross section at 125 mev for the 8.6 mev @xmath4-particle group which is in coincidence with the sdb transitions .",
    "in summary , evidence for long - lived isomeric states with lifetimes of up to several months , with abnormal decay properties , was obtained .",
    "relatively high energy @xmath4-particles of 5.1 - 5.5 mev were tentatively found in the usually non-@xmath4-emitting nuclei , @xmath74os , @xmath73ir and @xmath75hg , and interpreted as due to transitions from the second well of the potential in the parent nuclei to less deformed or normal states in the daughters .",
    "the observed transitions are the last in long chains of up to 6 steps of @xmath4-particle and @xmath11 or ec transitions , presumably within the second well itself .",
    "long - lived 6  7 mev @xmath4-particles , in coincidence with sdb @xmath3-rays , were found with energies consistent with transitions from the second minimum in the parent nucleus to the second minimum in the daughter .",
    "the reason for their long lifetimes though is not clear .    a 3.88 mev long - lived proton group was found .",
    "its state of origin is not entirely clear .",
    "by far the most exciting observation is the very high energy and strongly retarded ( t@xmath5 @xmath7 40 d ) 8.6 mev @xmath4-particle group in coincidence with sdb transitions , which is interpreted as due to a long - lived isomeric state in @xmath53hg at e@xmath48 @xmath91 11.6 mev , and is consistent with a transition from the third ( hyperdeformed ) well of the parent nucleus to the second ( superdeformed ) well in the daughter .",
    "the production cross sections of the isomeric states in the second well were about the same at e@xmath2 = 125 ( 10% below the barrier ) and at e@xmath2 = 135 mev , while on the average a factor of 15  60 larger cross section was found for the 8.6 mev group at 125 mev .",
    "the existence of such long - lived isomeric states , with lifetimes much longer than those of their corresponding ground states , and with preferential production cross sections at relatively low bombarding energies , may add new considerations regarding the stability and the production mechanism of heavy and superheavy elements @xcite .",
    "in particular it should be mentioned that the extra - push energies needed for the production of such nuclei in their superdeformed and hyperdeformed wells are much smaller than expected for producing them in their normal states @xcite .",
