    "worth of note is also the possibility of studying the magnetic superexchange interactions in these materials , since several systems can be obtained in at least two different crystallographic modifications @xcite . since mn@xmath13 is jahn - teller ( jt ) active ion , the degeneracy of manganese e@xmath14 orbital in mn - based compounds can be removed by a cooperative jt distortion below transition temperature t@xmath15 and there can be also observed the long range ordering of @xmath7 and @xmath8 orbitals below temperature @xmath16 @xcite .",

    "another impulse for our research was that while many papers deal with substitution on pr site @xcite , only small number is devoted to mn - fe substitution @xcite . since prmno@xmath2 orders magnetically below 100 k and prfeo@xmath2 orders at very high temperature , one can expect that the substitution of mn for fe can tune magnetic ordering temperature of prmn@xmath0fe@xmath1o@xmath2 in the temperature range around room temperature .",

    "mn@xmath18 ions are jahn - teller ( jt ) active ions , but fe@xmath18 ions are not jt active .",
    "since both ions have practically the same shanon radii ( in high spin state , which is expected in this case , both have radius 0.785  ) @xcite one should expect that the mn - fe substitution will directly probe the jt effect in the prmn@xmath0fe@xmath1o@xmath2 system .",
    "parent compounds @xmath12mno@xmath2 and @xmath12feo@xmath2 have been already extensively studied from the crystallographic point of view and the results can be found elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the reference of the pseudo - cubic lattice parameters which are defined as follows :    @xmath42    ( @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the true , orthorhombic lattice parameters ) is usually very convenient for study of the jt distortion and the orthorhombic distortion .",
    "the lattice distortion index ( @xmath46 ) can be expressed by the formula @xcite :    @xmath47    where @xmath48 are pseudo - cubic lattice parameters and @xmath49 is the mean value of @xmath48 . in principle",

    "the concentration evolution of the pseudo - cubic lattice parameters ( fig .",

    "the distortion index @xmath46 determined at room temperature monotonously decreases with increasing iron concentration , which means that the iron substitution brings the structure closer to original , perovskite structure ( fig . [ fig1]b ) .",

    "@xcite , but in this case the relation @xmath52 holds already for @xmath36 . since sultan et al .",
    "@xcite prepared samples by solid state reaction , the difference is probably caused by the different preparation route and thence the different amount of mn@xmath54 ions which implies the different oxygen off - stoichiometry @xmath55 .",
    "the similar effect of crossing @xmath56 and @xmath57 with iron concentration was also observed for dymn@xmath0fe@xmath1o@xmath2 system for concentration of about @xmath24 = 0.4 @xcite .",
    "the temperature evolution of xrpd patterns for @xmath6 revealed the structural phase transition at temperatures around 900 - 1000 k ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] and supplementary online material , section 1 ) .",
    "two different crystallographic phases coexist in this temperature region which implies that the structural phase transition is clearly of the first order .",
    "possible model structures for higher temperatures were found with help of program package spuds @xcite , which incorporates into its calculations all distortions of the perovskite structure as published by glazer @xcite .",
    "the best rietveld fit for @xmath6 concentrations was obtained again for the orthorhombic structure with space group @xmath58 , however , with different crystallographic parameters ( fig .",

    "length approaches the @xmath45-axis length .",
    "similar structural change was previously observed for lamno@xmath2 at temperature varying from 600 k @xcite to 750 k @xcite depending on the content of mn@xmath54 ions , for prmno@xmath2 at temperature approximately 950 k @xcite and for ndmno@xmath2 in temperature range 1000  1200 k @xcite .",
    "since all previously mentioned authors adopt notation o for low temperature phase and o for higher temperature phase , we adopt the same notation . in our case , in o phase the equation @xmath52 is fulfilled , while in o phase the equation @xmath50 is fulfilled ( see supplementary online material ) .",
    "it means that o phase is not jt distorted , while o is jt distorted , and that is why we assign the o  o structural phase transition to the onset of jahn - teller distortion and we denote the corresponding temperature as @xmath59 . in the temperature region",
    "approximately 60 k below @xmath59 it is impossible to fit the xrpd spectra by single crystallographic structure . instead of this",
    ", one has to use the crystallographic model , which consists of two phases : o and o. this effect can be ascribed to the ordering of @xmath7 and @xmath8 orbitals , which does not take place at exact temperature , but in the whole temperature interval @xmath60 . below @xmath61 we have observed only the o phase , which is orbitally - ordered phase .",
    "note that the observation of the orbital ordering was already reported for several pure @xmath12mno@xmath2 compounds @xcite , but not for doped compounds .",
    "one of the characteristics of o phase is @xmath46 parameter approaching zero value ( fig .",

    "the o  o structural phase transition is robust for the iron substitution @xmath6 and disappears for @xmath62 . for concentrations @xmath62",
    "we have observed only o phase at temperatures lower than 1200 k. for concentration range @xmath63 we have observed two different regimes for the pseudocubic parameters : @xmath50 at lower temperatures and @xmath52 at higher temperature ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] and supplementary online material , section 2 ) .",
    "both regimes are within the o crystallographic phase and the switching temperature between these two regimes decreases with increasing of iron concentration .",
    "such an effect is understandable since one replaces the mn@xmath18 ions which are jt active with fe@xmath18 ions , which are not jt active .     for different iron concentrations @xmath24 .",

    "[ fig4 ] ) and @xmath46 decreases also for increasing of iron content .",
    "it means that increasing of iron concentration and temperature brings the crystal structure of prmn@xmath0fe@xmath1o@xmath2 closer to the crystallographic structure of original perovskite .",
    "xrpd measurements were performed with roughly 20 k step .",
    "since this is quite high step in temperature sampling , we have determined the position of o  o structural phase transitions also by differential thermal analysis ( dta ) .",
    "dta measurements show minima at 975(5 ) k ; 928(10 ) k and 900(15 ) for @xmath24 = 0 ; 0.1 and 0.2 , respectively but there is no anomaly for @xmath24 = 0.35 ( fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) .",
    "the minima are fingerprints of endothermic phase transitions and we define the transition as the onset of the minima .",
    "all these phase transitions coincide well with the o  o structural phase transitions as determined by xrpd experiments .",
    "thermo gravimetry measurements ( tg ) revealed no anomaly in the studied temperature range .",
    "such a result implies that the oxygen stoichiometry is constant in temperatures up to 1250  k and in air atmosphere .",
    "some more insights into the jt distortion could be done by examining directly the mno@xmath27 octahedrons in the studied compounds , however , in the pnma orthorhombically distorted perovskite structure the oxygen atoms occupy @xmath64 and @xmath65 crystallographic positions which results to 5 adjustable parameters and the x - ray scattering cross section of oxygen is low .",
    "that is why our determination of oxygen fractional coordinates in the unit cell was too uncertain to present accurate results of ( mn , fe)o@xmath27 octahedrons metrics and mn  o  mn angles .",
    "for such a research the synchrotron or neutron experiment is highly desirable .",

    "the hysteresis loops for @xmath78 ( fig . [ fig12]b ) are very similar with hysteresis loops from the previous region of concentration , but they do not content any kink in the vicinity of remnant magnetization . the ferromagnetic component is present and the loops look like superposition of antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic contribution .",
    "the hysteresis loops for @xmath79 in the case of single crystals ( fig . [ fig12]c ) are much sharper , which is the consequence of the quality of the sample and the coercive force is lower than in the case of powder samples @xmath80 .",
    "nevertheless , hysteresis persists when measured along all three main crystallographic directions ( fig .",
    "[ fig12]c and the supplementary online material , section 4 ) which suggest that ferromagnetic interactions are also present at relevant temperatures .",
    "the coercive forces @xmath81h = 0.09 t ; 0.11 t ; 0.12 t for main crystallographic axes ( @xmath43- ; @xmath44- and @xmath45-axis ) of single crystal and @xmath81h = 0.07  t determined from and the powdered sample with @xmath24 = 0.5 at 2 k are very similar but still there are some differences among them indicating magnetocrystalline anisotropy of the material ( see supplementary online material ) .",
    "the hysteresis loops around @xmath82 ( fig .",
    "[ fig12]d and supplementary online material ) exhibit two distinct anomalies : the hysteresis behavior around zero magnetic field with very low coercive force and metamagnetic - like step in higher magnetic fields .",
    "this implies onset of antiferromagnetic interactions at @xmath82 .",
    "also the hysteresis loops in temperature range @xmath83 suggest the presence of ferromagnetic interactions which co - exist with mainly antiferromagnetic interactions .    the inverse magnetic susceptibility at temperatures higher than 120 k is almost linear for compounds with @xmath84 ( supplementary online material ) .",
    "that is why we have modelled the susceptibility for these concentrations with the modified curie - weiss law : @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the temperature independent contribution to the measured susceptibility ( presumably contribution from the sample holder and glue ) ; @xmath87 is the characteristic temperature and constant @xmath88 scales with the effective magnetic moment @xmath89 .",
    "the fitted parameters ( table [ table2 ] ) revealed that effective magnetic moment decreases linearly with increasing of iron concentration with rate -0.43(3 ) @xmath90 per 10 % of iron substitution , but in the same time the characteristic temperature increases with rate 18 k per 10 % of iron substitution ( table [ table2 ] ) .",
    "on the other hand , fe@xmath18 ion in the high spin state has one more unpaired electron if comparing with mn@xmath18 ion .",

    "such an assumption can be underlined by the change in the shape of hysteresis loops around concentration @xmath24 = 0.35 ( fig .",
