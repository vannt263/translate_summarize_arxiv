    "the fifth generation ( 5 g ) communications system needs to deliver improvement over 4 g , e.g. much higher user data rate / spectral efficiency , enhanced eco - friendliness and energy efficiency , seamless communications , and low latency etc .",
    "@xcite . to meet the required performance ,",
    "densified topologies with two main approaches , i.e. , massive multiple - input multiple - output ( m - mimo ) and small - cell densification , are promising candidate technologies @xcite .    in m - mimo , each base station ( bs ) employs a large - scale antenna array in linear , cylindrical , or other shapes .",
    "the large number of antennas not only provides more diversity to the transmission but also `` hardens '' the channel , allowing low - complexity but sharp beamforming towards the user equipments ( ues ) @xcite .",
    "the results are less interference and higher spectral and energy efficiencies .",
    "the main drawback of m - mimo is the channel estimation / acquisition and feedback , which require a high accuracy to attain the gain that m - mimo promises @xcite .",
    "pilot contamination , itself an existing problem , also restricts the benefits of m - mimo @xcite .",
    "in contrast , small - cell networks consists of many micro / femto cells with limited number of antennas , typically one or two , at each access point ( ap ) . due to the short distance between the aps and ues , small - cell networks have smaller path loss and co - channel interferences while requiring lower power consumption , hence improving both spectral and energy efficiencies .",
    "the gain of small - cell densification , however , is subject to more complicated cell planning and inter - cell coordination / cooperation @xcite .",
    "the evolution of high spectral / energy efficiency for 5 g thus results in two opposing ideas : concentrating the antennas to form m - mimo bss , and distributing them to form small cells .",
    "it is thus natural to ask which approach performs better and under which scenarios . despite many works studying either m - mimo or small - cell networks",
    ", there exists few work in literature comparing their performance .",
    "one of the reasons is due to system modeling : no existing framework so far allows for an effective collation . in this paper",
    ", we aim to partially answer the above question using the metrics of spectral and energy efficiencies .",
    "in particular , we resort to stochastic geometry and random matrix theory ( rmt ) for the analysis . a brief introduction of stochastic geometry can also be found in @xcite .",
    "rmt , also referred as large - system analysis in literature , was used to investigate large multi - user linear receivers and code division multiple access ( cdma ) networks @xcite and various mimo setups @xcite . while exact analyses are realizable under finite - dimensional matrix theory @xcite , they often lead to complicated expressions hence do not provide useful insights .",
    "the seminal monograph @xcite and other works have shown that large - system analysis can reveal many more interesting properties of communication systems . furthermore , although the analysis is mathematically accurate only for large random vectors / matrices , the obtained results remain good approximations for finite - dimensional cases .",
    "recently , many studies have also advanced the so - called `` deterministic equivalent '' approach to investigate more sophisticated system models @xcite .",
    "m - mimo , which employs a large number of transmit / receive antennas , is a natural application of large - system analysis",
    ". a detailed survey can be found in @xcite , which lists many key m - mimo performance analyses considering hardware impairments @xcite , channel state information ( csi ) estimation / acquisition @xcite , and resource allocation / precoding schemes @xcite .",
    "note that most of the m - mimo studies only consider a bs - centric analysis in which the relative locations of the bss and ues are fixed , thus neglecting the network topology .",
    "in order to compare m - mimo with small - cell densification , a proper system modeling is necessary .    in this paper",
    ", we study both small - cell and m - mimo networks using stochastic geometry and large - system tools .",
    "the aim is to provide an insightful comparison between these two topologies .",
    "the contributions of our paper are summarized as follows :    * * system modeling : * we propose a model for m - mimo and small - cell networks which incorporates the randomness of both transmitting distributed antennas ( das)/bss and single - antenna ues .",
    "particularly , the da / bs and ue locations are distributed according to poisson point process ( ppps ) with possibly different densities .",
    "therefore , there exists a transmission probability that some transmitting antennas / bss are turned off due to no associated ue .",
    "we assume a time / frequency division multiplexing access ( tdma / fdma ) scheme in which the transmitting nodes associated with more than one ue will communicate with only one ue in each resource block . finally , we assume non - coordinated das / bss and employ conjugate beamforming , which is optimal for non - coordinated m - mimo with single - antenna ues . *",
    "* m - mimo and small - cell network analysis : * we study the performance of m - mimo and show that the signal - to - interference ratio ( sir ) distribution at a typical ue is similar to that under a non - fading ad - hoc network . here , the important differences between the two cases are the m - mimo gain and transmission probability . as discussed before , the results for fading ad hoc networks",
    "can be directly extended to the small - cell counterparts , with small but important modification again due to the transmission probability .",
    "we therefore utilize the results from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sections iii and iv ) to derive the bounds for the sir distribution of m - mimo and small - cell networks . based on these analyses ,",
    "we further obtain the bounds for both the average shannon and outage rates of the two systems . to better characterize the small interference regime , the performance of m - mimo and small - cell networks",
    "is also derived under the assumption of asymptotically small ue density . * * comparison between m - mimo and small - cell densification : * we reveal that small - cell densification yields better rates than m - mimo when the user density is moderate or large compared to the transmitting node density and number of antennas .",
    "however , m - mimo outperforms small - cell systems under the asymptotically small ue density regime .",
    "this implies that there exists a ue density threshold lower than which we should employ m - mimo and higher than which small - cell densification is more preferable , when spectral efficiency is the performance metric .",
    "we further compare the energy efficiency performance and show that small - cell always outperforms m - mimo .",
    "the results are therefore useful for the optimal design of the upcoming 5 g heterogeneous networks .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : system model ] describes our m - mimo and small - cell network models , which incorporate the randomness of both transmitting nodes and ues , for a fair comparison between m - mimo and small - cell densification . in sections [ sec : m - mimo cas ] and [ sec : small - cell ] ,",

    "the above arguments suggest that the optimal setup should be a moderate m - mimo system with sufficient beamforming gain and a sufficiently dense bs deployment .",

    "we observe another important aspect of the trade - off between m - mimo and small - cell densification .",
    "particularly , even through m - mimo have a higher spectral efficiency as under small ue density regime , small - cell densification might still be a preferable option for certain communication systems due to its higher ee performance .",

    "particularly , we have derived sir distribution bounds for both systems , based on which the average shannon and outage rate bounds are obtained .",
    "we have also analyzed the performance of m - mimo and small - cell under asymptotically small ue density regime , which represents ue - sparse networks .",
    "the m - mimo and small - cell systems were then compared in terms of spectral and energy efficiencies . for the rate performance , we observe that m - mimo surpasses small - cell densification when the ue density is small compared with bs / ap density and number of antennas , and vice versa .",
