    "in this work , we analyze the behavior of the family of solutions of a concentrated elliptic equation with nonlinear boundary conditions of the type @xmath1 when the boundary of the domain presents a highly oscillatory behavior , as the parameter @xmath2 , and nonlinear terms are concentrated in a region of the domain neighboring the boundary . to describe the problem , we will consider a family of uniformly bounded smooth domains @xmath3 , with @xmath4 and @xmath5 , for some @xmath6 fixed , and we will look at this problem from the perturbation of the domain point of view and we will refer to @xmath7 as the unperturbed domain and @xmath8 as the perturbed domains .",
    "we will assume that @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 in the sense of hausdorff , that is , @xmath12 as @xmath2 , where @xmath13 is the symmetric hausdorff distance of two sets in @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "we will also assume that the nonlinearities @xmath16 are continuous in both variables and @xmath17 in the second one , where @xmath18 is a fixed and smooth bounded domain containing all @xmath19 , for all @xmath20 .",
    "now , for sufficiently small @xmath21 , @xmath22 is the region between the boundaries of @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "note that @xmath25 shrinks to @xmath23 as @xmath2 and we use the characteristic function @xmath26 of the region @xmath25 to express the concentration in @xmath25 .",
    "the figure [ figure1 ] illustrates the oscillating set @xmath27 .",
    "[ figure1 ]    . ]",
    "although the domains behave continuously as @xmath2 , the same is not true for the boundaries .",
    "it is possible that the measure @xmath28 is uniformly bounded and that it does not converge to @xmath29 when @xmath30 .",
    "in fact , this is the case when the boundary @xmath31 presents an oscillatory behavior in which , up to a diffeomorphism , the period goes to zero with the same order of amplitude .",
    "since @xmath25 shrinks to @xmath23 as @xmath2 , it is reasonable to expect that the family of solutions @xmath32 of ( [ nbc ] ) will converge to a solution of an equation with a nonlinear boundary condition on @xmath23 that inherits the information about the concentration region .",
    "moreover , the boundary condition in the limit problem also inherits the information about the behavior of the measure of the deformation of @xmath33 with respect to @xmath23 .",
    "we will show that the solutions of ( [ nbc ] ) converge in @xmath34 to the solutions of the elliptic problem @xmath35 where the function @xmath36 is related to the behavior of the measure @xmath37-dimensional of the @xmath31 and @xmath38 is related to the behavior of the measure @xmath39-dimensional of the concentration region @xmath22 .",
    "indeed , we will prove the upper semicontinuity of the family of solutions of ( [ nbc ] ) and ( [ nbc_limite_gamma_f ] ) in @xmath40 .",
    "the precise hypotheses about the domains , the exact definition of @xmath25 and the functions @xmath41 and @xmath42 are given in section [ perdominio ] .",
    "the behavior of the solutions of nonlinear elliptic equations with nonlinear boundary conditions and rapidly varying boundaries was studied in @xcite , for the case of uniformly lipschitz deformation of the boundary , but without concentration .",
    "the authors proved the convergence of the solutions in @xmath34 and @xmath43 , for some @xmath44 .",
    "the behavior of the solutions of elliptic problems with terms concentrated in a neighborhood of the boundary of the domain was initially studied in  @xcite , when the neighborhood is a strip of width @xmath21 and has a base in the boundary , without oscillatory behavior and inside of @xmath45 .",
    "more precisely , in  @xcite it was proven that these solutions converge , in certain bessel potentials spaces and in the continuous functions space , to the solution of an elliptic problem where the reaction term and the concentrating potential are transformed into a flux condition and a potential on the boundary . later , the asymptotic behavior of the attractors of a parabolic problem was analyzed in  @xcite , where the upper semicontinuity of attractors was proved . in @xcite",
    "the domain @xmath45 is @xmath17 in @xmath14 .",
    "recently , in  @xcite some results of  @xcite were adapted to a nonlinear elliptic problem posed on an open square @xmath45 in @xmath46 , considering @xmath47 and with highly oscillatory behavior in the boundary inside of @xmath45 .",
    "the dynamics of the flow generated by a nonlinear parabolic problem posed on a @xmath17 domain @xmath45 in @xmath46 , when some reaction and potential terms are concentrated in a neighborhood of the boundary and the `` inner boundary '' of this neighborhood presents a highly oscillatory behavior , was studied in @xcite where the continuity of the family of attractors was proved .",
    "it is important to note that all previous works with terms concentrating in a neighborhood of the boundary deal with non varying domain and since @xmath22 is inside of @xmath45 then all the equations are defined in the same domain . in our case ,",
    "the region @xmath22 is outside of @xmath45 .",
    "we also generalize the domain treated in the literature allowing @xmath48 , with @xmath4 , and alowing @xmath45 to be a @xmath49 domain",
    ". moreover , the oscillations discussed in this work are more general than those in  @xcite .",

    "we also obtain some technical results on uniform estimates in bessel potentials spaces and of constant of trace operators , and we analyze the limit of concentrated integrals . in section",
    "[ upper ] , we prove the upper semicontinuity of the family of solutions of ( [ nbc ] ) and ( [ nbc_limite_gamma_f ] ) . in section [ conclusion ] , we state some results that can be proven , but we leave out the proof here .",
