    "@xmath0 four dimensional gauge theories can be obtained by means of @xmath4-theory compactifications @xcite on elliptically fibered calabi yau fourfolds @xmath5 : @xmath6 or equivalently by @xmath7-theory compactifications on @xmath5 in the limit @xmath8 .",
    "assuming kodaira classification @xcite of singular fibers extends to the case of elliptically fibered calabi - yau fourfolds and working locally , in the spirit of geometric engineering @xcite , we can get @xmath0 four dimensional gauge theories with @xmath9 type of gauge groups . in this paper",
    "we will consider , from that point of view , some problems concerning @xmath0 super gluodynamics , in particular gaugino condensates , the @xmath1-puzzle @xcite , the witten index @xcite and domain walls @xcite .",
    "these issues has been recently considered , in the context of intersecting branes in reference @xcite .",
    "chiral symmetry breaking in @xmath0 pure gluodynamics , i. e. , non vanishing condensates @xmath10 for gluino bilinears , has been derived long time ago using different methods . in @xmath11",
    "pure super yang - mills , instantons contribute to condensates @xmath12 and they are , after integration over the size of the instanton , independent of the positions @xmath13 @xcite . through cluster decomposition",
    "we can get a set of values for @xmath14 , @xmath15 with @xmath16 , @xmath17 some constant , @xmath18 the @xmath11 @xmath0 scale and @xmath1 the @xmath1-vacua parameter .",
    "a similar result @xcite can be directly derived , for @xmath11 gauge groups , using ",
    "t hooft s torons @xcite . in both cases this way of computing the condensates",
    "is doubtful .",
    "namely , using cluster , we must implicetely consider the contribution of instantons of arbitrarily large size , which is certainly beyond the regime where semiclassical analysis is reliable .",
    "the same happens in the toron computation , where an infinite volume limit must be performed before reaching the result ( [ 2 ] ) .",
    "a different approach to the computation of @xmath14 is in the weak coupling regime @xcite where the holomorphy dependence on an auxiliary mass is used .",
    "these two procedures do not coincide on the value of the constant in ( [ 2 ] ) . recently",
    "a possible way out to this puzzle has been proppossed in reference @xcite where the existence of an extra vacua without chiral symmetry breaking is suggested .",
    "leaving for a while these issues the result ( [ 2 ] ) contains already some interesting peculiarities . if the different values for @xmath19 are identified with different vacua , the change @xmath20 transforms the vacuum @xmath21 into the vacuum @xmath22 .",
    "moreover the number of @xmath14 values coincides , for @xmath11 with the witten index @xmath23 , but this is not the case for @xmath24 groups where the number of @xmath14 values is @xmath25 while the witten index is @xmath26 + 1 $ ] .",
    "since non vanishing values for @xmath14 are connected with a non trivial superpotential for @xmath0 gluodynamics @xcite , and taking into account that vertical instantons @xcite in m - theory survive in the @xmath0 four dimensional limit , it is natural looking for a superpotential that agrees with ( [ 2 ] ) , directly in m - theory . a first step in this direction",
    "was already taken in reference @xcite . in this approach",
    "the geometry of kodaira singularities is crucial . for an elliptically fibered calabi - yau fourfold , m - theory instantons",
    "@xcite are defined as divisors , i. e. , six cycles , with holomorphic euler characteristic @xmath27 .",
    "if the instanton is vertical , then we can safely use it as a contribution to the four dimensional superpotential . in the kodaira classification @xcite ,",
    "the singular fibers are defined by 2-cycles @xmath28 of the type : @xmath29 with @xmath30 , non singular rational curves , @xmath31 integer numbers and the intersection matrix @xmath32 one to one related to some affine dynkin diagram . moreover , the self intersection @xmath33 is equal to zero , which is characteristic of elliptic singularities . in a calabi - yau fourfold",
    "@xmath5 the singular locus will be a four dimensional manifold @xmath17 and we will assume that the singular fiber is trivially fibered over @xmath17 .",
    "in addition , we will think of @xmath17 as an enriques surface . with these assumptions ,",
    "it is easy to get m - theory instantons @xmath34 associated with the @xmath35 in ( [ 3 ] ) @xcite all of them with @xmath27 , and therefore with two fermionic zero modes . following",
    "@xcite we associate with each of these divisors a scalar field @xmath36 transforming under chiral @xmath37 as : @xmath38 the topological sum defined as @xmath39 transforms as @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the coxeter number of the diagram defined as the total number of irreducible components .",
    "this is the transformation rule of the @xmath1 parameter in @xmath0 super gluodynamics as derived from the @xmath37 axial anomaly .",
    "thus we define the @xmath1 parameter as the topological sum @xmath42 . for the @xmath11 case corresponding to @xmath2 singularities",
    ", we have under @xmath43 transformations , @xmath44 , which can be solved by @xmath45 , with @xmath46 $ ] undetermined .",
    "this corresponds to the geometry of @xmath2 kodaira singularities , where under chiral @xmath43 the ireducible components transform cyclically as @xmath47 .    by standard m - theory instanton computations",
    "@xcite , we can associate with each divisor @xmath48 , such that @xmath49 a gaugino condensate @xmath50 . from ( [ 4 ] ) , and the definition of @xmath1 as a topological sum , we easily get @xmath51 , for @xmath52 ( notice that in four dimensions @xmath1 play a similar role to the three dimensional goldstone boson @xcite which in m - theory on calabi - yau fourfolds can be identified with the scalar field @xmath36 ) . in summary , we start with divisors @xmath48 , with @xmath49 in an elliptically fibered calabi - yau fourfold . by purely geometrical arguments",
    "@xcite , we derive the transformation rule ( [ 4 ] ) .",
    "next , we consider a singular fiber of kodaira type @xmath9 as defined by a cycle of the type ( [ 3 ] ) .",
    "then the topological sum @xmath39 reproduces the chiral transformations of @xmath1 dictated by the @xmath37 axial anomaly of @xmath9 @xmath0 four dimensional gauge theories . at this point ,",
    "the reader can wonder where four dimensions enter the argument .",
    "in the three dimensional limit defined by @xmath53 the singularity , as we will discuss later , becomes rational , of type @xmath54 , with @xmath55 irreducible components , and the topological sum does not possess any clear physical meaning .    the @xmath1-puzzle appears as a consequence of the following fact . if the @xmath1 angle ( we reduce here the discussion to @xmath11 ) is defined as the topological sum @xmath56 , then it is tempting to think of @xmath1 as the scalar field @xmath57 , associated to the six cycle @xmath58 , defined by trivially fibering the @xmath2 cycle @xmath59over the singular locus @xmath17 .",
    "then the transformation rule under chiral @xmath37 , @xmath60 will mean that @xmath61 . this is the mathematical way to translate the physical argument relating @xmath1 to instanton tunneling and instantons to condensates of the type @xmath62 .",
    "where is the loophole of this way of thinking ? .",
    "the loophole is mathematically very clear , namely the holomorphic euler characteristic of the @xmath63-cycle @xmath58 is zero , and not @xmath64 , and therefore @xmath1 is not the field @xmath65 .",
    "the intuitive way to understand it , is simply observing that @xmath28 is not just the union of @xmath64 disconnected components @xmath35 , but a very specific set of intersections that , by the grothendieck - riemann - roch theorem @xcite , leads to @xmath66 .",
    "what are the consequences of @xmath66 from a physical point of view ? .",
    "intuitively we can think of @xmath66 as reflecting a complete soaking up of the fermionic zero modes associated to the components @xmath35 .",
    "this approach allows us to associate to each intersection @xmath67 a term soaking up two fermionic zero modes , of the same order of magnitude as the @xmath10 condensate .",
    "these intersection terms are perfect candidates for domain walls whose existence is the physical way to solve the @xmath1-puzzle . in other words",
    ", @xmath66 implies the entanglement of the different vacua , entanglement that is physically mediated by the intersection terms .",
    "the extension of this entanglemnet mechanism to @xmath68 supersymmetry would be extremely interesting for explaining the @xmath1 dependence in the witten - veneziano formula @xcite .",
    "thinking in terms of branes in m - theory , instantons are interpreted @xcite as fivebranes wrapped on six cycles @xmath48 ; thus , the intersection term should be interpreted as a five brane wrapped on @xmath69 , which produces , in four dimensions , a wall of the appropiate tension , interpolating the @xmath21 and @xmath22 vacua . moreover",
    ", the two fermionic zero modes associated to the intersection term seems to be the right @xmath70 signal of the domain wall .",
    "the extension of the previous arguments to @xmath24 gauge groups , i. e. , to @xmath71 type singularities , will present some extra difficulties that we will discuss .    in summary",
    "the solution to the @xmath1-puzzle and the existence of domain walls are related to the topology of intersections of the irreducible components defining singular elliptic fibers .",
    "let @xmath72 be an elliptic fibration , @xmath73 with @xmath74 an algebraic curve , and @xmath75 , with @xmath76 any point in @xmath74 , an elliptic curve .",
    "let us denote @xmath77 the finite set of points in @xmath74 such that @xmath78 is a singular fiber .",
    "each singular fiber @xmath79 can be written as @xmath80 where @xmath81 are non singular rational curves , with @xmath82 , and @xmath83 are integer numbers .",
    "different types of singularities are characterized by ( [ eq : r2 ] ) and the intersection matrix @xmath84 .",
    "all different types of kodaira singularities satisfy the relation @xmath85    let @xmath86 be the elliptic modulus of the elliptic fiber at the point @xmath87 . for each path",
    "@xmath88 in @xmath89 , with @xmath90 , we can define a monodromy transformation @xmath91 , in @xmath92 , acting on @xmath86 as follows : @xmath93 each type of kodaira singularity is characterized by a particular monodromy matrix .    in order to define an elliptic fibration @xcite ,",
    "the starting point will be an algebraic curve @xmath74 , that we will take , for simplicity , to be of genus zero , and a meromorphic function @xmath94 on @xmath74 .",
    "let us assume @xmath95 on @xmath96 .",
    "then , there exists multivalued holomorphic function @xmath86 , with @xmath97 , satisfying @xmath98 , with @xmath99 the elliptic modular @xmath99-function on the upper half plane . as above , for each @xmath100 we define a monodromy matrix @xmath91 , acting on @xmath86 in the form defined by ( [ eq : r4 ] ) .",
    "associated to these data we will define an elliptic fibration , ( [ eq : r1 ] ) . in order to do that ,",
    "let us first define the universal covering @xmath101 , of @xmath102 , and let us identify the covering transformations of @xmath101 over @xmath102 , with the elements in @xmath89 . denoting by @xmath103 a point in @xmath101 , we define , for each @xmath100 , the covering transformation @xmath104 , by @xmath105 in other words , we consider @xmath106 as a single valued holomorphic function on @xmath101 . using ( [ eq : r4 ] ) , we define @xmath107 next , we define the product @xmath108 and , for each @xmath109 , with @xmath100 , and @xmath110 integers , the automorphism @xmath111 denoting by @xmath112 the group of automorphisms ( [ eq : r7 ] ) , we define the quotient space @xmath113 this is a non singular surface , since @xmath114 , as defined by ( [ eq : r7 ] ) , has no fixed points in @xmath101 . from ( [ eq : r7 ] ) and ( [ eq : r8 ] ) , it is clear that @xmath115 is an elliptic fibration on @xmath102 , with fiber elliptic curves of elliptic modulus @xmath86 .",
    "thus , by the previous construction , we have defined the elliptic fibration away from the singular points @xmath116 .",
    "let us denote @xmath117 a local neighbourhood of the point @xmath116 , with local coordinate @xmath118 , and such that @xmath119 .",

    "we can consider two different cases , depending on the finite or infinite order of @xmath120 .",

    "thus , we can define a normal subgroup @xmath146 of @xmath129 as the set of transformations ( [ eq : r11 ] ) : @xmath147 comparing now ( [ eq : r15 ] ) and ( [ eq : r18 ] ) , we get @xmath148 using ( [ eq : r18 ] ) and ( [ eq : r11 ] ) we get @xmath149 with @xmath28 the cyclic group of order @xmath150 , defined by @xmath151 from ( [ eq : r20 ] ) and ( [ eq : r19 ] ) , we get the desired extension to @xmath116 , namely @xmath152 thus , the elliptic fibration extended to @xmath116 , in case @xmath120 is of finite order , is defined by @xmath153 .",
    "now , @xmath153 can have singular points that we can regularize .",
    "the simplest example corresponds to @xmath154 i. e. , a parity transformation . in this case , the order is @xmath155 , and we define @xmath134 by @xmath156 .",
    "the cyclic group ( [ eq : r21 ] ) in this case simply becomes @xmath157 since from ( [ eq : r23 ] ) and ( [ eq : r6 ] ) we get @xmath158 . at the point @xmath137",
    "we have four fixed points , the standard @xmath132 orbifold points , @xmath159 with @xmath160 .",
    "the resolution of these four singular points will produce four irreducible components , @xmath161 .",
    "in addition , we have the irreducible component @xmath162 , defined by the curve itself at @xmath137 . using the relation @xmath163",

    "let us recall that a cyclic unramified covering , @xmath171 , of order @xmath64 , of a curve @xmath17 of genus @xmath114 , is a curve @xmath172 of genus @xmath173 thus , for @xmath174 , we get @xmath175 , for arbitrary @xmath64 . denoting by @xmath106 the elliptic modulus of @xmath17 , in case @xmath174 , the elliptic modulus of @xmath172 is given by @xmath176 moreover , the generators @xmath177 and @xmath178 of @xmath179 are given in terms of the homology basis @xmath88 , @xmath180 of @xmath17 as @xmath181 with @xmath182 the projection @xmath183 . from ( [ eq : r32 ] ) and ( [ eq : r29 ] ) , we can interpret the elliptic fibration ( [ eq : r30 ] ) as one with elliptic fibers given by @xmath64-cyclic unramified coverings of a curve @xmath17 with elliptic modulus @xmath123 or , equivalently , @xmath184 .",
    "there exits a simple way to define a family of elliptic curves , with elliptic modulus given by @xmath185 , which is the plumbing fixture construction .",

    "the pinching region of the cyclic unramified covering is given by @xmath209 instead of ( [ eq : r34 ] ) , i. e. , for the surface defining the @xmath54 singularity , @xmath210 .",

    "the resolution of the singularity ( [ eq : r37 ] ) requires @xmath55 exceptional divisors , @xmath211 .",
    "in addition , we have the rational curve @xmath162 , defined by the complement of the node .",
    "thus , we get , at @xmath187 , @xmath212 with @xmath213 , and @xmath214 , which is the @xmath2 dynkin diagram .",

    "in addition , we get the four fixed @xmath132 orbifold points described above .",
    "the singular fiber is then given by @xmath221 with the intersections of the @xmath3 affine diagram .",
    "it is easy to see that in this case we also get @xmath222 defing the genus of the singular fiber by @xmath223 , we conclude that @xmath174 , for all singularities of kodaira type .",

    ", we have @xmath234 . a possible way to represent this phenomenon is by simply extracting the point at infinity . in the case of @xmath2 singularities , as described in previous subsection , taking out the point at infinity corresponds to decompactifying the irreducible component @xmath162 , that was associated with the curve itself .",
    "as was clear in this case , we then pass from the affine diagram , @xmath2 , to the non affine , @xmath54 .",
    "more generally , as the elliptic fibration we are considering possesses a global section , we can select the irreducible component we are going to decompactify as the one intersecting with the basis of the elliptic fibration",
    ". when we decompactify , in the @xmath8 limit , what we are doing , at the level of the fiber , is precisely compactifying the extra irreducible component , which leads to the affine dynkin diagram .",

    "since the singular fibers are , topologically , the union of irreducible components ( see ( [ eq : r38 ] ) and ( [ eq : r42 ] ) ) , we can write @xmath268 with @xmath41 the coxeter number of the corresponding singularity , which equals the total number of irreducible components . therefore , we will define @xmath269 as @xmath270 if we first consider the @xmath226 supersymmetric three dimensional theory obtained by compactifying m - theory on the calabi - yau fourfold @xmath5 , i. e. , in the limit @xmath271 , we know that only the divisor @xmath162 , for the @xmath2 case , is decompactified , passing from the affine diagram describing an elliptic singularity to the non affine diagram describing a rational , artin like , singularity @xcite . in that case",

    ", we will use the transformation rules ( [ eq : r48 ] ) . from the four dimensional point of view , these are the transformation rules with respect to the @xmath282 symmetry . from ( [ eq : r48 ] ) we get , that under @xmath283 , @xmath284 this is precisely the transformation rule under @xmath282 of the @xmath0 @xmath1-parameter , @xmath285 in fact , ( [ eq : r66 ] ) is a direct consequence of the @xmath37 axial anomaly equation : if we define @xmath1 as @xmath286 the anomaly for @xmath11 is given by @xmath287 the factor @xmath288 , differing ( [ eq : r69 ] ) from ( [ eq : r70 ] ) , reflects the fact that we are assigning @xmath282 charge @xmath289 to the fermionic zero modes . identifying the @xmath1-parameter with the topological sum @xmath290 we get",
    "that the constant @xmath254 in ( [ eq : r65 ] ) is simply @xmath291 so that we then finally obtain the superpotential @xmath292 with @xmath293 , which is the correct value for the gaugino condensate .",
    "let us now try to extend the previous argument to the @xmath3 type of singularities .",
    "defining again the four dimensional @xmath1-parameter as the topological sum of @xmath36 for the whole set of irreducible components we get , for the cycle ( [ eq : r42 ] ) , the transformation rule @xmath294 where now the coxeter for @xmath3 is @xmath295 .",
    "interpreting @xmath3 as @xmath24 gauge groups , with @xmath296 , we get @xmath297 . since @xmath1 is defined modulo @xmath251 we get that for @xmath3 singularities the value of @xmath36 , for any irreducible component , is @xmath298 with @xmath299 .",
    "however , now we do not know how to associate a value of @xmath126 to each irreducible component @xmath35 of the @xmath3 diagram . using ( [ eq : h2 ] ) , we get a set of @xmath25 different values for the gaugino condensate for @xmath24 groups : @xmath300 with @xmath301 .",
    "however , we still do not know how to associate to each @xmath35 a particular value of @xmath126 .",
    "a possibility will be associating consecutive values of @xmath126 to components with non vanishing intersection ; however , the topology of diagrams of type @xmath136 prevents us from doing that globally .",
    "notice that the problem we have is the same sort of puzzle we find for @xmath24 gauge groups , concerning the number of values for @xmath10 , and the value of the witten index , which in diagramatic terms is simply the number of nodes of the diagram . in order to unravel this puzzle ,",
    "let us consider more closely the way fermionic zero modes are soaked up on a @xmath3 diagram .",
    "we will use the cycle ( [ eq : r42 ] ) ; for the components @xmath302 to @xmath303 , associated to the @xmath132 orbifold points , we get divisors with @xmath27 .",

    "of course , ( [ eq : h4 ] ) refers to the holomorphic euler characteristic of the divisor obtained when fibering over @xmath17 any of the cycles @xmath309 , with @xmath310 .",

    "1#2.6#1    notice that the contribution to @xmath312 of @xmath306 is different form that of @xmath313 , with @xmath314 ; namely , for the first case @xmath315 , and @xmath316 for the second . for the @xmath3 diagram",
    ", we can define : @xmath317 the witten index @xmath23 , as the number of nodes , i. e. , @xmath318 ; @xmath319 the coxeter number , which is the number of irreducible components , i. e. , @xmath295 and @xmath320 the number of intersections as represented by the dashed lines in figure @xmath321 , i. e. , @xmath322 .",
    "from the point of view of the cartan algebra , used to define the vacuum configurations in @xcite , we can only feel the number of nodes .",
    "the @xmath1-parameter is able to feel the coxeter number ; however , we now find a new structure related to the intersections of the graph . in the witten index case ,",
    "the nodes corresponding to cycles @xmath323 , with @xmath324 contribute with one , in the number of @xmath10 values with two , and in the number of intersections with four .",
    "this value four calls for an orientifold interpretation of these nodes .",
    "the topological definition of the @xmath1-parameter implicitely implies the split of this orientifold into two cycles , a phenomena recalling the f - theory description @xcite of the seiberg - witten splitting @xcite . assuming this splitting of the orientifold , the only possible topology for the soaking up of zero modes is the one represented in figure @xmath325 , where the `` splitted orientifold '' inside the box is associated to four zero modes , corresponding to @xmath316 for a cycle @xmath326 , with @xmath327 .",
    "# 1#2.6#1    on the other hand , each node surrounded by a circle in figure @xmath328 represents itself the disconnected sum of two non singular rational curves ; thus , we represent each `` orientifold '' mode by four rational curves , with the intersections depicted inside the box of figure @xmath328 .",
    "when we forget about internal lines in figure @xmath328 , we get the cyclic @xmath329 structure of equation ( [ eq : h3 ] ) .",
    "it is clear that much more is necessary in order to reach a complete description of the @xmath24 vacuum structure .",
    "the discussion in the previous section already raises the problem known as @xmath1-puzzle .",
    "in fact , and discussing again only the @xmath11 case , the transformation law ( [ eq : r67 ] ) together with the very definition fo the @xmath1-angle as the topological sum @xmath290 would imply that @xmath1 is the scalar field @xmath330 of the @xmath63-cycle associated to the @xmath2 cycle , @xmath331 . on the basis of ( [ eq : r48 ] )",
    ", this will be equivalent to saying that @xmath61 , instead of zero .",
    "this is , in mathematical terms , the @xmath1-puzzle .",
    "the mathematical solution comes from the fact that @xmath66 . in this section",
    "we will relate this result , on the value of the holomorphic euler chareacteristic , to the appearance of domain walls @xcite . to start with ,",
    "let us consider a cycle @xmath332 , with @xmath333 .",
    "the self intersection can be expressed as @xmath334 where the @xmath335 contributions come from @xmath336 and @xmath337 , and the @xmath338 comes from the intersection between @xmath339 and @xmath340 . as usual , we can consider @xmath28 trivially fibered on an enriques surface .",
    "the holomorphic euler chracteristic of the corresponding six cycle can be written as @xmath341 using now the decomposition ( [ eq : r76 ] ) we get two contributions of one , coming from the components @xmath339 and @xmath340 , considered independently , and a contribution of @xmath342 from the intersection term @xmath338 in ( [ eq : r76 ] ) . in this sense",
    ", the intersection term can be associated to two fermionic zero modes , and net change of chiral charge oposite to that of the @xmath35 components .",
    "when we do this for the cycle @xmath28 of @xmath2 singularities , we get that each intersection is soaking up two zero modes , leading to the result that @xmath343 . a graphical way to represent equation ( [ eq : r76 ] ) is presented in figure @xmath321 .",
    "now , we will wonder about the physical interpretation of the intersection terms leading to @xmath343 for all kodaira singularities .",
    "the simplest , and most natural answer , is certainly domain walls extending between different vacua , or values of @xmath10 .    from the point of view of zero mode counting",
    ", the `` intersection term '' behaves effectively as an anti - instanton with two fermionic zero modes .",
    "one of these fermionic zero modes , let us say @xmath344 , is associated to the intersection of @xmath345 with @xmath346 and the other @xmath347 with the intersection of @xmath345 and @xmath346 .",
    "thus , extending naively the computation done for irreducible components , the contribution of the black box in figure @xmath321 should be of the order @xmath348 in result ( [ eq : h10 ] ) , interpreted as the contribution of the intersection term , the most surprising fact is the appearance of @xmath349 , since now we are geometrically considering simply a point ; the factor @xmath349 in the computation of the gaugino condensate comes from the volume of the divisor .",
    "in the same way as we interpret m - theory instantons as fivebranes wrapped on the six - cycles used to define the instanton , we can think of the intersection terms as fivebranes wrapped on the cycle @xmath350 , i. e. , the product of the singular locus @xmath17 and the intersection point .",
    "the fivebrane wrapped on this cycle defines , in four dimensions , a domain wall , let us say interwining between the vacua @xmath21 , at @xmath351 , and the vacua @xmath22 , at @xmath352 , where the coordinate @xmath353 is identified with the unwrapped direction .",
    "it is in this sense that we should use ( [ eq : h10 ] ) to define the energy density , or tension , of the domain wall . in the four dimensional limit",
    ", @xmath354 goes zero as @xmath355 ; moreover , the local engineering approach works in the limit where the volume of the singular locus @xmath17 is very large , so that we can very likely assume that intersection terms behave like ( [ eq : h10 ] ) , with @xmath349 , but only in the four dimensional limit .",
    "cyclicity of the @xmath2 diagram allows us to pass from the @xmath99 to the @xmath356 vacua in two different ways : @xmath55 steps , or a single one .",
    "the sum of both contributions should define the physical domain wall ; thus the energy density will behave as @xmath357    the extension of the previous argument to the case of @xmath24 groups is certainly more involved , due to the topology of the @xmath71 diagram , and the presence of orientifolds .",
    "it would certainly be interesting studying the interplay between orientifolds and domain walls in this case .",
    "finally , we will say some words on the qcd string . in reference",
    "@xcite , the geometry of qcd strings is intimately related to the topological fact that @xmath358 where @xmath359 is a rational curve associated to the configuration of fourbranes , and @xmath360 is the ambient space where @xmath359 is embedded ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "the qcd string is then associated to a partially wrapped membrane on a non trivial element of @xmath361 .",
    "recall that @xmath362 is defined by one - cycles in @xmath363 , with boundary on @xmath359 .",
    "the previous discussion was done for @xmath364 gauge groups .",
    "using our model of @xmath2 singularities , described in section 2 , the analog in our framework of ( [ eq : r77 ] ) is equation ( [ eq : r33 ] ) .",
    "then we can , in the same spirit as in reference @xcite , associate the qcd string to paths going from @xmath365 to @xmath366 , where @xmath365 are the intersection points , @xmath367 geometrically , it is clear that the tension of this qcd string is the square root of the domain wall tension . by construction",
    ", the qcd string we are suggesting here ends on domain walls , i. e. , on intersection points .    to end up ,",
    "let us include some comments on the existence of extra vacua , as suggested in @xcite .",
    "it is known that the strong coupling computation of @xmath10 does not coincide with the weak coupling computation ; more precisely@xcite , @xmath368 in the framework of m - theory instanton computations , the numerical factors will depend in particular on the moduli of complex structures of the calabi - yau fourfold . in the strong coupling regime",
    "we must consider structures preserving the elliptic fibration structure and the picard lattice . in the weak coupling regime , where the compuatation is performed in the higgs phase ,",
    "the amount of allowed complex structures contributing to the value of @xmath369 is presumably larger .",
    "obviously , the previous argument is only suggesting a possible way out of the puzzle ( [ eq : r75 ] ) .",
    "equally , at a very speculative level , the extra vacua , with no chiral symmetry breaking , could be associated to the cycle @xmath370 defining the singular fiber , a cycle that we know leads to @xmath371 , and therefore does not produce any gaugino condensate .",
    "notice that any other cycle with @xmath372 will lead , if clustering is used , to some non vanishing gaugino condensates , so that @xmath58 with @xmath371 looks like a possible candidate to the extra vacua suggested in @xcite .",
    "if this argument is correct this extra vacua will appears for any kodaira singularity i. e. in any ade @xmath0 four dimensional gauge theory .",
    "it is important to stress that the @xmath1-puzzle is not exclusive of @xmath0 gluodynamics . in the @xmath68 case",
    "the witten - veneziano formula @xcite for the @xmath373 mass also indicates a dependence of the vacuum energy on @xmath1 in terms of @xmath374 , which means a set of entangled `` vacuum '' states . in our approach",
    "to @xmath0 the origin of this entanglement is due to the fact that @xmath371 for the singular cycle . in fact , @xmath66 means that the set of divisors @xmath244 , plus the intersections , i. e. , the domain walls , are invariant under @xmath37 , as implied by equation ( [ eq : r48 ] ) .",
    "if we naively think of something similar in @xmath68 and we look for the origin of vacuum entanglement in intersections we maybe should think in translating the topology of intersections into topological properties of abelian proyection gauges @xcite .",
