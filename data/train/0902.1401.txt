    "strongly magnetized compact stars , so called ` magnetars ' , reveal their presence via giant flares with peak luminosities of @xmath10 ergs / s .",
    "the giant flares are typically accompanied by a decaying tail which may last several hundreds of seconds .",
    "these sources are known as soft gamma repeaters ( sgrs ) , and up to now , three giant flares have been detected , sgr 0526 - 66 in 1979 , sgr 1900 + 14 in 1998 , and sgr 1806 - 20 in 2004 . the analysis of the timing of the last two events revealed several qpos in the decaying tail whose frequencies are approximately 18 , 26 , 30 , 92 , 150 , 625 , and 1840 hz for sgr 1806 - 20 , and 28 , 53 , 84 , and 155 hz for sgr 1900 + 14 , see @xcite .",
    "it is believed that during an sgr event torsional oscillations in the solid crust of the star could be excited , @xcite , that lead to the observed frequencies in the x - ray tail .",
    "indeed , the frequency of many of these oscillations fit the values of the torsional mode oscillations of the solid crust of a compact star .",
    "however , since not all of the observed frequencies are explainable by pure crust oscillations , @xcite , alternative scenarios have also been suggested .",
    "for example , @xcite claimed that the observed spectra may be explained via alfvn oscillations , while @xcite pointed out that the alfvn oscillations of magnetars could be continuous .",
    "recently , a toy model calculation by @xcite indicated that the edges or turning points of the continuum could correspond to long - lived qpos , and according to levin , the results of @xcite indicated for realistic magnetar configurations that the alfvn oscillations of magnetars could be continuous which would explain the lower observed frequencies . in a more recent paper by @xcite , it was shown that the spectrum of the polar alfvn oscillations is actually discrete .",
    "in @xcite , the authors performed two - dimensional numerical simulations of linearized alfvn oscillations in magnetars .",
    "their model improves the previously considered toy models in various ways .",
    "general relativity is assumed , various realistic equations of state ( eos ) are considered and a consistent dipolar magnetic field is constructed .",
    "however , it does not take into account the presence of a solid crust and only examines the response of the ideal magnetofluid to a chosen initial perturbation .",
    "the two - dimensional partial differential equation ( pde ) that was used to study the alfvn oscillations has a mathematical pathological behavior , as will explained later , that forced them to introduce artificial numerical viscosity in an attempt to stabilize the numerical evolution .",
    "the numerical results presented in @xcite are compatible with the observations .",
    "for example , they found two families of qpos , corresponding to the edges or turning points of a continuum , with harmonics at near integer multiples . with this identification",
    ", they could set an upper limit to the dipole magnetic field of @xmath11 to @xmath12 g , and they could limit the models to very stiff eos for values of the magnetic field strength near to its upper limit , or moderately stiff for lower values of the magnetic field .    in an extension of that paper , @xcite ,",
    "studied the axisymmetric crust torsional modes of magnetars with poloidal and toroidal magnetic field , where both components are confined in the crust .",
    "the numerical results showed that this magnetic configuration can not explain the actual observational data of sgrs , and is in agreement with a more recent result by @xcite .",
    "after a more elaborate study of the master equation , we discovered the origin of the numerical instability , and , moreover , we managed to reduce it , by using a coordinate transformation , to a @xmath5-dimensional pde which can be evolved stably without the need of artificial viscosity and also allows a semi - analytically estimate of the properties of the continuum and the associated qpo s .    in this paper",
    ", we adopt the units of @xmath13 , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 denote the speed of light and the gravitational constant , respectively , and the metric signature is @xmath16 .",
    "we consider a spherically symmetric and static star described by the tov equations and the line element @xmath17 the structure of the star is not influenced by the presence of the magnetic field because the last has an energy @xmath18 which is a few orders of magnitude smaller than the gravitational binding energy @xmath19 .",
    "typically , @xmath20 .    generally , spherical stars show two type of oscillations , _ spheroidal _ oscillations with polar parity and _ toroidal _ oscillations with axial parity .",
    "the observed qpos in sgr x - ray tails may originate from toroidal oscillations , since these can be excited more easily than poloidal oscillations because they do not involve density variations .",
    "the mhd oscillations of the equilibrium model are described by the linearized equation of motion and by the magnetic induction equations , see @xcite .",
    "these two perturbation equations can be converted into a @xmath4-dimensional evolution equation for the displacement function @xmath21 which is related to the contravariant component of the perturbed 4-velocity , @xmath22 via @xmath23 for an analytical derivation , see @xcite .",
    "the @xmath4-dimensional time - evolution equation for the displacement @xmath21 has the following form ( @xcite ) : @xmath24 all the coefficients @xmath25 and @xmath26 depend on the coordinates @xmath27 and @xmath28 , but not on time .",

    "a prime indicates a derivative with respect the radius .",
    "the symbol @xmath35 denotes the shear modulus . in the following",
    ", we will set @xmath35 equal to zero , neglecting the presence of a solid crust , since we will focus on the oscillations of the magneto - fluid core that plays a major role in magnetars qpos .",
    "in fact , as it has been shown by @xcite and @xcite , in the presence of a strong magnetic field pure crustal modes can not explain the present qpos frequencies . as a consequence ,",
    "it is necessary to study global modes , i.e. , alfvn waves propagating through the whole star .",
    "the radial function @xmath3 is determined by solving the grad - shavranov equation : @xmath36 as boundary conditions , we assume regularity at the center , @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is a constant , and continuity at the surface with a dipole field outside the star .    according to @xcite , the solutions of equation ( [ 2d ] ) have to satisfy the following boundary conditions :    * regularity at the center : @xmath39 at @xmath40 ; * no traction on the surface : @xmath41 at @xmath42 ; * axisymmetry : @xmath43 at @xmath44 ; * equatorial plane symmetry for @xmath45 initial data : @xmath39 at @xmath46 ; * for @xmath47 initial data : @xmath43 at @xmath46 .    in @xcite , in order to avoid numerical instability , equation ( [ 2d ] )",
    "was solved by introducing an artificial @xmath48-th order ` dissipation ' term . here ,",
    "instead , we find a coordinate transformation that allows us to avoid the use of a dissipation term and , as we will show later , to avoid the singular behavior of the time independent form of the equation ( [ 2d ] ) .",
    "in fact , if , in a first approximation , we neglect the first derivatives in the direction of @xmath27 and @xmath28 in the equation ( [ 2d ] ) , then only the coefficients @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 remain . calculating the determinant of the principal part of the equation ( [ 2d ] ) , we find that @xmath52 hence the equation is parabolic in every point of its domain , and therefore does not describe propagation of 2d waves .",
    "significant simplification is achieved by introduction of a new coordinate system given by the transformation @xmath53 this new coordinates system is a kind of cartesian coordinate system where , instead of the radial coordinate @xmath27 , we use the radial component of the magnetic four - potential @xmath3 .",
    "the behavior of @xmath3 inside the star is determined via the equation ( [ gf ] ) .",
    "on the surface , we require the continuity of @xmath3 with a dipole solution outside . in figure",
    "[ b_eos ] , we plot the function @xmath33 for different equations of state ( eos ) .",
    "the subscripts indicate the mass of the star .",
    "for example , wff@xmath54 corresponds to an equilibrium stellar model with eos wff ( @xcite ) and @xmath55 .",
    "the magnetic field @xmath56 and the radial function @xmath3 are related by @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the levi - civita tensor , @xmath59 is the background four - velocity and @xmath60 is the electromagnetic tensor . then equation ( [ b_der ] )",
    "leads to @xmath61 where we define @xmath62 .",
    "note , however , that the coordinates defined by ( [ new_trasf ] ) are not the usual magnetic coordinates known in the literature , see for example @xcite for a review , since they mix the poloidal angle and the radial component of the magnetic field in @xmath0 .",

    "the equation ( [ 1d_n ] ) is a @xmath5-dimensional wave equation .",
    "the perturbations propagate only along the @xmath6 direction . in the last direction ,",
    "the problem reminds of a study of waves propagating along the strings of a musical instrument .",
    "the construction of the grid in these @xmath0 coordinates needs special attention .",
    "the function @xmath3 has a maximum inside the star , and the position of this maximum depends on the strength and the topology of the magnetic field . a strong magnetic field , and",
    "also a toroidal field added to the standard poloidal field , pushes the maximum near the surface of the star .",
    "the position of @xmath68 determines also the number of the closed magnetic field lines confined inside the star .",
    "since the closed magnetic field lines do nt reach the surface , they are subject to different boundary conditions than the open magnetic field lines .",
    "this difference leads to a different behaviour of the oscillations of open and closed magnetic lines , as will be shown later . in practice",
    ", we split the problem into two parts for both cases , i.e. , for closed and open magnetic field lines . for the open magnetic field lines ,",
    "the perturbation function @xmath69 is evolved until some points @xmath70 and @xmath71 that correspond to the maximum of @xmath68 , i.e. , we work on the part @xmath72 of figure [ b_lines_xy ]",
    ". then the evolution continues , in the part @xmath73 of figure [ b_lines_xy ] , from the points @xmath70 and @xmath71 and ends at the points @xmath74 and @xmath75 that correspond to the surface of the star .",
    "note that in this second part , we have to use the transformation @xmath76 due to the sign change of the derivative of @xmath3 . in a similar fashion for the closed magnetic lines ,",
    "we evolve @xmath69 until @xmath70 and @xmath77 , but then the simulation does nt end on the surface , but at @xmath78 and @xmath79 , that correspond to points on the equator . from a technical point of view , we just `` _ open _ '' the field lines , then we solve the two problems separately and match the two solutions that we get via the boundary conditions .",
    "this procedure will be explained later .",
    "figure [ b_lines_xy ] may help in understanding the procedure followed in solving this problem .",
    "the equation ( [ 1d_n ] ) must be solved with the appropriate boundary conditions .",
    "the boundary condition are different for open and closed magnetic lines .",
    "the open lines reach the surface and match up with the dipole magnetic field outside the star . then , as we will show later , they couple on the surface and oscillate together . differently ,",
    "the closed magnetic lines confine themselves in the interior of the star , forming closed loops , and they never reach the surface .",
    "so they do nt have any coupling to the open magnetic lines and oscillate independently . when we ` open ' the closed magnetic lines , creating magnetic strings , we open the closed loop , but do nt change the boundary conditions at the ends of the strings .    in the @xmath0 coordinate system ,",

    "the open ` magnetic strings ' are coupled on the surface of the star and near the axis for @xmath81 ( corresponding to @xmath44 ) . with initial data @xmath47",
    ", there is an additional coupling at the equator ( corresponding to @xmath82 ) .",
    "we study a variety of equilibrium models , constructed for three representative eoss and different masses that range from @xmath86 @xmath87 , see table [ tab1 ] .",
    "we set the magnetic field strength to @xmath88 gauss , matching the field strength extrapolated from the analysis of the observations for sgr @xmath89 and sgr @xmath90 .",
    "we construct a numerical equidistant grid @xmath91 in the @xmath0 coordinates , setting @xmath92 and @xmath93 and varying @xmath28 from @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "the structure of our grid is displayed in the first quadrant of figure [ b_lines_xy ] .",
    "note that each ` magnetic string ' in the first quadrant continues in the third quadrant .",
    "we evolve these two parts in time like two separate problems , taking into account the different boundary conditions for open and closed magnetic field lines .",
    "the two parts are linked in every time step , requiring the continuity of the function @xmath96 and its derivative @xmath97 .",
    "for our evolution , we use an iterative crank - nicholson scheme and we evolve the perturbations for more than @xmath98s ( see figure [ evol ] ) . in order to check the stability of the scheme , we performed an evolution for @xmath99s and found that our scheme was still stable .",
    "we evolve the perturbations by providing initial data corresponding to either odd , @xmath47 or even , @xmath45 , boundary conditions at @xmath82 .",
    "a change in the value of @xmath100 leads to different boundary conditions for open and closed lines and leads to different scaling in the oscillation frequencies of the open field lines .",
    "we compute the fft of various ` strings ' and find that each ` string ' corresponds to a different frequency . in @xcite , the authors find a family of upper frequencies near the magnetic axis for @xmath44 , corresponding to points along the y - axis in our coordinates , and a family of lower frequencies for @xmath46 , corresponding to points along the x - axis in our coordinates .",
    "they identify the fundamental frequency peaks of the two families of qpos with the edges or turning points of the alfvn continuum suggested by @xcite .",
    "these two frequencies were named fundamental lower @xmath101 , for @xmath46 , and fundamental upper @xmath102 , for @xmath44 qpos .",
    "the overtones are indicated by @xmath103 and @xmath104 . in the following , we adopt these conventions when we refer to the oscillations of the open field lines , while we call the frequencies of the closed field lines @xmath105 .",
    "our results confirm partially the results of @xcite . for open lines ,",
    "a family of upper frequencies appears near the y - axis , while a family of lower frequencies appears near the last open magnetic field line , just before the region of closed lines .",
    "this can be explained by the fact that the ` strings ' near the y - axis correspond to a stronger average magnetic field because in the @xmath106 coordinates they correspond to denser field lines , see figure [ opoint ] .",
    "since the frequency of the alfvn oscillations is proportional to the strength of the magnetic field , we expect that these frequencies are the upper ones .",
    "in addition , we find that , for all the magnetic strings , the upper frequencies are multiples of the fundamental frequency both in the case of @xmath103 and in the case of @xmath104 , see figure [ fft ] .",
    "however , this multiplicity is different when we consider even @xmath45 or odd @xmath47 , initial data .",
    "in fact , we obtain @xmath107 @xmath108 where the superscripts _ even _ and _ odd _ indicate results derived for even @xmath45 and odd @xmath47 parity initial data and boundary conditions on the equator .",
    "the different scaling shown in the relations ( [ rapp ] ) - ( [ rapp1 ] ) and ( [ rapp2])-([rapp3 ] ) is due to the different boundary conditions used for odd and even values of @xmath100 .",
    "the problem can be understood by looking at a simple problem of two strings of finite length connected by by another spring .",
    "if the two strings are connected at just one of their ends , while the others are kept fixed , like in the case of even parity where the ` magnetic strings ' are coupled just near the surface and are fixed at the equator , then we obtain the relations ( [ rapp ] ) and ( [ rapp1 ] ) .",
    "this type of configuration was analyzed in @xcite , in order to explain the w - modes of neutron stars .",
    "an analytic derivation of the relations ( [ rapp ] ) and ( [ rapp1 ] ) can be found there .",
    "if instead the two strings are coupled in both ends , like in the case of odd parity , then the relations ( [ rapp2 ] ) - ( [ rapp3 ] ) follow .",
    "the frequencies of the closed magnetic field lines show a different behaviour .",
    "the upper and lower frequencies are scaling as , see also figure [ fft_c ] , @xmath109    the difference between the relation ( [ rapp ] ) and ( [ rapp_c ] ) is due to the different boundary conditions .",
    "the closed lines never reach the surface .",
    "they start from the equator where they close .",
    "this means that they are subject to the same boundary condition at both of their ends which resembles the toy problem of a string that oscillates with both ends fixed and gives the @xmath9 behaviour , as in the case odd values of @xmath100 for the open field lines .",
    "the frequencies that we find for closed lines initially decrease to a minimum and from then on increase . this behaviour results from two factors .",
    "first , from the fact that closed lines are shorter than open lines , and , second , from the fact that the magnetic field becomes somehow locally weaker as we move off the axis .",
    "this behaviour of the spectrum has been identified after comparing our data with the results coming from the non - linear evolutions presented in @xcite .",
    "the relations here provide the limits of the continuous part of the spectrum , in accordance with the results of @xcite .",
    "our results are summarized in table [ tab1 ] .      in the preceding work @xcite ,",
    "an artificial viscosity was added in order to avoid a fast growing instability .",
    "this instability is due to the presence of the so called `` _ _ o - type _ _ neutral point '' ( @xcite ) .",
    "if the magnetic field lines of a poloidal magnetic field are closed and confined to the stellar interior , then there is a point on which these magnetic field lines converge and become degenerate ( see figure [ opoint ] ) .",
    "this point corresponds to the maximum of the function @xmath3 .    in our scheme ,",
    "the magnetic field lines are practically straight , see figure [ b_lines_xy ] , even in the vicinity of the point that corresponds to @xmath110 .",
    "this behavior is due to our choice to ` open ' the grid and to evolve the open and closed field lines as two independent problems .",
    "when we look at the point @xmath68 , we find that it practically does nt evolve and , because the ` strings ' are coupled only along the surface and near the @xmath81 axis , can not be influenced by the oscillations of the other ` strings ' . in this way , we avoid the singular behaviour shown in the @xmath106 coordinates . the last is the main reason why our code is stable also without artificial viscosity .      from equation ( [ b_der ] ) , the toroidal magnetic field can be written as @xmath111 where @xmath112 is a constant only depending on the toroidal magnetic field . by increasing or decreasing @xmath112 , we can influence the strength of the toroidal magnetic field .",
    "so @xmath112 can be interpreted as a parameter that describes the strength of the toroidal magnetic field in relation to the poloidal field , see @xcite for details .",
    "the presence of a toroidal field modifies equation ( [ gf ] ) by adding an extra term @xmath113 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath114 hence , the toroidal field influences our evolution equation ( [ 1d_n ] ) only through the presence of the extra term @xmath64 . by solving equation ( [ gf1 ] ) for @xmath64 and subsequent substitution into equation ( [ 1d_n ] )",
    ", the toroidal magnetic field appears in the 1 + 1 equation ( [ 1d_n ] ) only through the parameter @xmath112 in the term @xmath115 this means that the toroidal field affects the local propagation speed of the alfvn modes .",
    "also , the toroidal field pushes the position of @xmath116 outwards and contributes to the stability of the magnetic field in the star . in figure",
    "[ b_wff ] , we plot the function @xmath3 for the eos wff@xmath54 and for different values of the parameter @xmath112 .",
    "it is clear that when @xmath112 increases , i.e. , the strength of the toroidal magnetic field increases , then @xmath68 is pushed closer to the surface .    hence , it is natural to expect changes in the oscillation spectrum due to the presence of the toroidal component of the magnetic field .",
    "we find that the frequencies are lower compared to the case in which only a poloidal field is present , see table [ tab2 ] , especially for the closed magnetic ` strings ' .",
    "_ this can be explained because , by the presence of a toroidal magnetic field @xmath117 , i.e. , the point were the magnetic field lines converge , moves outwards , and hence the ` magnetic strings ' increase in length .",
    "_ since the frequency is inversely proportional to the length of the ` strings ' , as the length increases , the frequency decreases .    [ cols=\"<,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in a paper by @xcite , the timing analysis of the sgr 1806 - 20 and the sgr 1900 + 14 has been computed .",
    "the study shows the appearance of several qpos in the tail of these events .",
    "in particular , for sgr 1806 - 20 , the identified frequencies are @xmath118 and @xmath119 hz , while for sgr 1900 + 14 , the frequencies are 28 , 53 , 84 and 155 hz .    using the relations ( [ rapp2 ] ) and ( [ rapp3 ] ) ,",
    "we can easily show that for sgr 1900 + 14 , if we consider @xmath120hz , we can identify @xmath121 , and @xmath122hz . in a similar way for sgr 1806 - 20",
    ", we have @xmath123hz and @xmath124hz , and consequently @xmath125hz or @xmath126 , @xmath127hz or @xmath128 .",

    "for the qpos from sgr 1806 - 20 , we can fit the observational data by a model with equation of state apr , mass around 1.4@xmath87 and a toroidal field a little stronger than the poloidal field , @xmath130 .",
    "we have investigated torsional alfvn modes of relativistic stars with poloidal and toroidal magnetic field using a new coordinate system @xmath0 , where @xmath131 and @xmath2 . in this new coordinate system , the perturbed two dimensional equation for the toroidal displacement @xmath21 in @xcite",
    "is reduced to a @xmath5-dimensional equation , and the perturbations , i.e. , alfvn waves , are propagating only along the y - direction . by solving the problem with the appropriate boundary conditions for open and closed magnetic ` strings '",
    ", we find that each ` magnetic string ' corresponds to a family of frequencies .",
    "the upper frequency belongs to the family of open magnetic ` strings ' near the y - axis because the alfvn frequency is proportional to the local strength of the magnetic field , and since near the y - axis , the magnetic field is stronger than in the rest of the star .",
    "the family corresponding to the lower frequency is the one just before the _ o - point _ ,",
    "i.e. , the point where the magnetic lines converge and degenerate into a point .",
    "we find that for each family of frequencies there is a relation between the overtone frequencies and the fundamental frequencies , and this relation changes if we consider odd or even parity , see equations ( [ rapp ] ) , ( [ rapp1 ] ) , ( [ rapp2 ] ) , ( [ rapp3 ] ) .",
    "in addition , we find a third family of frequencies linked to the closed lines .",
    "this family shows a minimum , whose value is similar to that of the lower frequencies of the open lines for even parity .",
    "also , we find that in presence of a toroidal magnetic field the frequencies are lower than in the case with only a dipole magnetic field , both for closed and open magnetic ` string ' .",
    "this is due to the change in the position of @xmath68 that moves outwards .",
    "this results in longer ` magnetic strings ' and , as consequence , to a lower characteristic frequency for each ` string ' .    in a future work",
