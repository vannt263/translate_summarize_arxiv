    "in the past decade there is a general consensus that today our universe is undergoing an accelerated expansion .",
    "this result with the accelerated expansion becomes the central theme of the modern cosmology and confirms various observational evidences which are the observations of supernovae type ia ( sne ia ) @xcite , cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmb ) @xcite , and large - scale structure @xcite .",
    "the standard cosmology can not clarify what causes this cosmic acceleration and cosmologists have to seek a powerful explanation for this observed realty in observational cosmology . in order to explain the accelerated behaviour of the universe in framework of general relativity ( gr ) one can produce a dark fluid with a negative pressure which named the dark energy .",
    "a simple candidate of dark energy is the cosmological constant with the equation of state ( eos ) parameter , @xmath2 .",
    "however , the cosmological constant model is subject to the so - called fine - tuning and coincidence problems @xcite . to solve these problems ,",
    "various dynamical dark energy models have been proposed .",
    "the simplest one is a canonical scalar field which is dubbed quintessence dark energy that has been extensively studied in the literature @xcite .",
    "another one is to work a scalar field with a negative kinetic energy , dubbed phantom dark energy @xcite .",
    "finally , quintom scenario combining the quintessence and phantom dark energy has been proposed @xcite . in such a model eos parameter",
    "can pass below and up the phantom divide line @xmath2 .    on the other hand alternative approach dealing with the acceleration problem of the universe",
    "is to modified the geometric part of einstein field equation .",
    "such a modifications in gr is known as @xmath3 gravity theory .",
    "the simplest form of this theory can be constructed by replacing the ricci scalar @xmath4 with an arbitrary function @xmath3 in the einstein - hilbert lagrangian ( for reviews see e.g.@xcite ) .",
    "it is known that teleparallel equivalent of gr , referred to as teleparallel gravity , was firstly introduced by einstein to unify the gravity and the electromagnetism @xcite . in this gravity theory , the equations of motion for any space - time are exactly the same as of gr , but , instead of using the curvature defined by the levi - civita connection , it uses the weitzenbck connection that has no curvature but only torsion .",
    "similar to gr , where the action is a curvature scalar , the action of teleparallel gravity is a torsion scalar @xmath5 .",
    "the dynamical variable of the teleparallel gravity is the vierbein fields and the field equations are obtained by taking variation of the action with respect to the vierbein fields @xcite .",
    "some modifications in the teleparallel gravity theory have been recently proposed in order to get a solution for the cosmic acceleration of the universe without introducing the dark energy .",
    "a particular class of modified gravity theories is the @xmath6 gravity theory which can be constructed by replacing the torsion scalar @xmath5 with an arbitrary function @xmath6 in the action of the teleparallel gravity @xcite .",
    "we note that the field equations in this theory are second - order differential equations , while for the generalized @xmath3 theory they are fourth - order . lately , @xmath6 theory attracted much attention in the literature , and we refer to e.g. @xcite for some relevant works .    very recently , new scenario the so - called teleparallel dark energy has been proposed by geng et al in which they added the quintessence scalar field non - minimally coupled to the torsion scalar in the framework of teleparallel gravity @xcite .",
    "they have found that such a theory has a richer structure than the same one in the framework of general relativity .",
    "the richer structure of non - minimally coupled scalar field with the torsion scalar is due to exhibiting quintessence - like or phantom - like behavior , or experiencing the phantom divide crossing in this theory .",
    "we note that in the minimal coupling case , cosmological model with the quintessence scalar field in teleparallel gravity is identical to that in gr .",
    "motivated by the teleparallel dark energy scenario , we here extend it by replacing the coupling function term @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a non - minimal coupling constant , with the arbitrary function @xmath9 . in such a scenario it is important to determine the form of @xmath9 .",
    "noether symmetry approach that was introduced by capozziello et al .",
    ", allows one to choose the potential and the coupling function dynamically in the scalar - tensor gravity theory . utilizing this approach we find the potential and the coupling function in the teleparallel dark energy scenario and we solve the analytically the field equations of the theory .",
    "our results show that the teleparallel dark energy equation of state parameter has quintessence , phantom - like behavior or the transition from quintessence to phantom phase in this theory .",
    "in particular , when we choose the quadratic potential and coupling function via noether symmetry approach , we obtain that during the evolution of the universe the equation of state parameter changes from @xmath10 to @xmath11 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the following section ,",
    "the field equations are derived from a point - like lagrangian in a friedman - robertson - walker spacetime , which is obtained from an action ingluding the scalar field non - minimally coupled to the torsion scalar in the framework of teleparallel gravity . in the section [ nsa ]",
    ", we search the noether symmetry of the lagrangian of scalar tensor theory and give the solutions of the field equations by using noether symmetry approach . finally , in the section [ conclusions ] , we conclude with a brief summary of the obtained results .",
    "let us consider the general action for a scalar field , non minimally coupled with the torsion scalar , in this case we write @xmath12}. \\label{action2},\\ ] ] where @xmath13 that @xmath14 is tetrad ( vierbein ) basis , @xmath5 is a torsion scalar , @xmath9 is the generic function that describe the coupling and @xmath15 is the potential for the scalar field . note that we use planck units . for @xmath16 , the action ( [ action2 ] ) reduce to the action which proposed by geng et al @xcite .",
    "we also note that the action ( [ action2 ] ) with the torsion formulation of gr is similar to the standard scalar tensor theory where the scalar field couples to the ricci scalar @xcite .",
    "the homogeneous and isotropic friedmann - robertson - walker universe is described by the metric @xmath17 where a(t ) is the scale factor .",
    "it has been found in ref .",
    "@xcite that the torsion scalar in the teleparallel gravity can be expressed as @xmath18 . considering the background in ( [ frwmetric ] ) , it is possible to obtain a point - like lagrangian from action ( [ action2 ] ) @xmath19 here , a dot indicates differentiation with respect to the cosmic time @xmath20 .",
    "it is well known that the euler - lagrange equations for a dynamical system are @xmath21 where @xmath22 are the generalized coordinates of the configuration space .",
    "the configuration space of the lagrangian ( [ lag ] ) is @xmath23 and whose tangent space is @xmath24 . substituting eq .",

    "as is well known , the noether theorem generates a conserved quantity in the classical mechanic .",
    "the application of this theorem to cosmology was introduced by de rittis et al .",
    "@xcite and cappoziello et al .",
    "@xcite to find preferred solutions of the field equations and the dynamical conserved quantity .",
    "the noether theorem states that if the lie derivative of a given lagrangian @xmath33 dragging along a vector field @xmath34 vanishes @xmath35 then @xmath34 is a symmetry for the dynamics , and it generates the conserved quantity .",
    "we also note that the noether symmetry approach allows one to choose the potential dynamically in the scalar - tensor gravity theory @xcite , and the explicit form of the function @xmath3 of the modified @xmath3 theories of gravity @xcite . in this form of @xmath3 ,",
    "cosmological solutions in the case of frw metric can describe the accelerated period of the universe .",
    "spherically symmetric solutions in @xmath3 theories of gravity have been also found in @xcite , using the noether symmetry approach . on the other hand",
    ", some authors specified the form of @xmath6 in the modified @xmath6 theories of gravity via noether symmetry approach @xcite .",
    "the existence of noether symmetry implies the existence of a vector field @xmath34 such that @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are depend on @xmath26 and @xmath39 .",
    "hence the condition given by ( [ noether ] ) for the existence of a symmetry gives rise to the following set of coupled differential equations , @xmath40 this system are obtained by imposing the fact that the coefficients of @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 vanish . using the separation of variable one can find the solutions of the above set of differential equations ( [ neq1])-([neq4 ] ) for @xmath44 , coupling function @xmath9 and potential @xmath45 as @xmath46 @xmath47 @xmath48 where @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 are a constants and @xmath52 .",
    "if we consider the minimal coupling case i.e. @xmath53 , the above noether equations ( [ neq1])-([neq4 ] ) give an exponential potential .",
    "this case is completely equivalent to standard quintessence model which has been studied in @xcite .",
    "we note that for the physically acceptable of our model , the most important requirement is @xmath54 ( here we define the effective gravitational constant as @xmath55 ) .",
    "since the coupling function always positive for all the values of @xmath51 , this condition is provided .    in the present form the analytical solutions of the field equations given by ( [ k - g])-([energy ] ) are not straightforward to calculate . in order to integrate our the dynamical system , we search for a cyclic variable associated with the noether symmetry .",
    "if there exist such a symmetry , then one can always perform a change of variables @xmath56 such that the lagrangian ( [ lag ] ) becomes cyclic in one of them .",
    "we will see below that the dynamical system involving the cyclic variable can be easily solved .",
    "following this procedure given by ref.@xcite , we can introduce the new variables as @xmath57 in which the variable @xmath58 is a cyclic and @xmath59",
    ". then the scale factor and the scalar field can be rewritten as @xmath60 in term of these new variables , considering the coupling function ( [ coupling ] ) and potential ( [ pot ] ) , the lagrangian ( [ lag ] ) takes a manageable form @xmath61 it is clear that the variable @xmath58 is cyclic for this lagrangian .",
    "the euler - lagrange equations for @xmath58 and @xmath62 and the hamiltonian constraint equation ( @xmath63 ) associated with this lagrangian are , respectively , @xmath64 @xmath65 @xmath66 where @xmath67 is an integration constant related with the constant of motion .",

    "( [ donap ] ) , we find the general solutions for the scale factor and scalar field    here we assume that @xmath71 is zero without loss of generality .",
    "the deceleration parameter , which is an important quantity in cosmology , is defined by @xmath75 , where the positive sign of @xmath76 indicates the standard decelerating models whereas the negative sign corresponds to accelerating models and @xmath77 corresponds to expansion with constant velocity .",
    "it takes the following form in this model @xmath78 from eq .",
    "( [ dec1 ] ) we see that the universe is accelerating for @xmath79 .",
    "we can also define the equation of state parameter for the scalar field by using eqs .",

    ". then it can be obtained by @xmath81 astrophysical data indicate that @xmath82 lies in a very narrow strip close to @xmath2 .",
    "the case @xmath2 corresponds to the cosmological constant . for @xmath83 the phantom phase",
    "is observed , and for @xmath84 the phase is described by quintessence .",
    "thus , in the intervals @xmath85 and @xmath86 we have phantom phase .",
    "if @xmath87 , then the quintessence phase occurs , where the universe is both expanding and accelerating .",

    "it has recently been proposed as an alternative dark energy scenario @xcite and so - called teleparallel dark energy . in these literatures , authors have added a scalar field to the teleparallel equivalent to general relativity , allowing for a non minimal coupling between the field and the torsion scalar .",

    "further , this approach leads to a variable transformation that usually makes it possible to obtain exact and general solutions for the evolution of the scale factor and the scalar field . here , using the noether symmetry approach we construct the explicit forms of the coupling function and potential as @xmath133 and @xmath134 .",

    "our results for the equation of state parameter have depicted in fig .  2 and fig .",
    "3 . from these figures we observed that the phantom divide line is never crossed",
