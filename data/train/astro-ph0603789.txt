    "the idea of the mr mechanism of the core collapse supernova , suggested by @xcite , was to get energy for the supernova explosion from the rotation of the star due to magnetic field action . during",
    "the collapse stellar rotation is becoming differential i.e. central parts of the star rotate much faster than the envelope .",
    "1d numerical simulations made by , @xcite had shown that the differential rotation in presence of magnetic field leads to appearing of the toroidal component of the magnetic field , its linear growth , and following formation of mhd shock wave . in 1d approach",
    "the rotation was differential along @xmath2 axis only ( the star in 1d was a cylinder ) what means that the only @xmath3 component of the magnetic field was winded up and produced the toroidal ( @xmath4 ) component . in a 2d case",
    "the system has more degrees of freedom and the rotation is differential not only along the @xmath2 axis .",
    "the differential rotation is using both components of the magnetic field ( @xmath5 ) for the toroidal field amplification .",
    "2d simulations of mr mechanism with the initial magnetic field of the quadrupole - like type of symmetry have shown ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) that the amplification of the toroidal component of the magnetic field leads to formation of a compression wave , which moves along steeply decreasing density profile and quickly transforms into the fast mhd shock wave . due to the quadrupole - like initial magnetic field",
    "the supernova explosion was developed predominantly along the equatorial plane .",
    "the explosion energy for that case was about @xmath6erg .",
    "the value of the ejected energy is enough for the explanation of the core collapse supernova explosion .",
    "the main qualitative difference between 1d ( @xcite ) and 2d ( @xcite ) mr supernova simulation is an appearance of the magnetorotational instability ( mri ) which significantly reduces the time of the growth of the toroidal magnetic field up to mr supernova explosion . in 1d case",
    "the mri is not developed due to the small number of degrees of freedom .",
    "the first simulations of the mr processes in stars have been done by @xcite , after which mr processes in the stars in relation to the core collapse supernova explosion had been simulated by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "recently the interest to the mr processes ( especially in application to the core collapse supernova ) was recommenced due to increasing number of observational data about asymmetry of the explosion , and possible collimated ejecta in connection with cosmic gamma ray bursts ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . in the paper by @xcite",
    "it was estimated that a significant part of the type ib , c supernovae could explode as magnetorotational supernovae .    in the present paper",
    "we describe the results of the 2d simulations of the mr supernova explosion with the initial dipole - like magnetic field .",
    "the qualitative difference between our simulation of the same problem with the initial quadrupole - like magnetic field is the formation of mildly collimated protojet , directed along the rotational axis . as in the paper by @xcite",
    "we have found a development of the mri leading to rapid explosion even at a relatively weak initial magnetic field . in the simulations",
    "we have used an ideal mhd with the infinite conductivity . in spite of the fact that we supposed the conductivity to be infinite , in reality it is very big , but finite .",
    "that means that during winding up the force lines of the magnetic field and the mri development , the reconnection of the magnetic field lines is possible .",
    "if the reconnection time would be smaller or comparable to the characteristic time of the mri development then the reconnection process could reduce effectiveness of the mr supernova mechanism .",
    "we have done estimations for the reconnection time and have found that it is much larger than the time of the development of the mri , and will not influence significantly on the mr supernova explosion ( mre ) .",
    "mri in application to the core collapse supernova was studied by @xcite , @xcite .    for the simulations we have used implicit lagrangian numerical method on triangular grid of variable structure .",
    "this method was used for the simulations of a number of different astrophysical problems : simulations of the collapse of cold rapidly rotating protostellar clouds ( @xcite ) , magnetorotational processes for the collapsing magnetized protostellar cloud ( @xcite ) , core collapse and formation of the neutron star ( @xcite ) , mr supernova simulations with quadrupole - like initial magnetic field ( @xcite ) .",
    "for the simulations we use the equation of state from @xcite :    @xmath7    @xmath8    @xmath9 here @xmath10 is the gas constant taken equal to @xmath11 , @xmath12 is the constant of the radiation density , @xmath13 is pressure , @xmath14 is density , and @xmath15 is temperature . in the expression @xmath16 the value @xmath14 was identified with the total mass - energy density . for",

    "these regions give a small input into the total energy balance of the explosion .    to construct a configuration , where magnetic forces are balanced with other forces ( i.e. gravitational force , gradient of gas pressure and centrifugal force ) we follow the procedure from @xcite and @xcite .",

    "we have made simulations for the same range of variation of the @xmath141 parameter , and have found a similar dependence which is represented in fig.[mri ] .",
    "the logarithmic functional dependence at very small @xmath141 has a simple qualitative explanation .",
    "first , we should have in mind , that the development of mri starts at @xmath150 , approximately at the same moment for _ all _ initial values of the magnetic field .",
    "the mri development begins in the part of the star , where the ratio of the toroidal and poloidal magnetic fields reaches a definite value @xmath151 few tens , what happens after about 100 rotational periods of the inner core . in another words , the time of the field growth until the beginning of mri @xmath152",
    "does not depend on @xmath141 , if @xmath141 is small enough . at larger @xmath141",
    "the explosion starts before the beginning of mri .",

    "the magnetic energy @xmath154 is growing exponentially with time during mri development at @xmath158 ,    @xmath159,\\ ] ]    where @xmath160 is an increment of the mri instability .",
    "therefore , the time between the the start of mri , until the moment of the explosion @xmath144 , is growing logarithmically with decreasing @xmath141    @xmath161 @xmath162 here it was taken into account that a relative change of the gravitational energy of the star during magnetorotational explosion ( mre ) is rather small , and @xmath163 . at larger @xmath141 the mre happens before mri instability begins , @xmath164 , with @xmath165 , and for small @xmath141 , when @xmath166 , the explosion time is growing logarithmically .",
    "this qualitative explanation is valid if the explosion happens during a linear stage of the mri development . on this stage",
    "the magnetic field is growing exponentially with the increment roughly defined by the values of the configuration at the beginning of instability .",
    "when the magnetic field energy roughly approaches the rotational energy of the star , its growth is stopped , resulting in nonlinear saturation of mri .",
    "our numerical simulations have shown , that the explosion occurs before the nonlinear saturation of mri .",
    "we have done mr supernova explosion simulations with the initial dipole - like magnetic field ( fig.[inimag ] ) at a different number of knots in our triangular grid , starting from 1500 up to 18000 knots .",
    "we have found that the moment of the onset of the mri depends visibly on the number of grid points .",
    "the less knots we have in the grid , the longer time it takes for starting the mri .",
    "we have found that the results of the simulations ( namely the time of the development of the mr supernova explosion ) do not change when the total number of the knots @xmath167 exceeds 15000 .",
    "the results of the simulations described here are obtained with the grid containing about 15000 knots .",
    "the dependence ( converging ) of the time of the explosion @xmath144 on the number of knots has a pure numerical origin , and is connected with a numerical dissipation .",
    "such dissipation has a stabilizing influence on the mri , and its onset is shifted to larger values of @xmath168 - the ratio of the toroidal and poloidal magnetic fields .",
    "therefore , the total time of mre is increasing with decreasing of the number of knots , due to increasing of the time @xmath152 .",
    "numerical dissipation influence also on the field growth during mri development , decreasing the increment @xmath160 , giving the same effect .",
    "as follows from our simulations the influence of the numerical viscosity becomes unimportant at @xmath169 , when the time of viscous ( numerical ) dissipation starts to exceed all characteristic times of mr explosion .",
    "for the case of the initial dipole - like magnetic field .",
    "]    in the simulations we supposed that the matter of the star has infinite conductivity , although in reality the conductivity is finite . in the case of a finite conductivity and chaotic structure of the magnetic field",
    "the reconnection of the magnetic field could be important , leading to a real physical dissipation .",
    "the theory of the magnetic field reconnection is not complete up to now . to analyze the importance of the magnetic field reconnection in mre ,",
    "let us estimate ( at least roughly ) a characteristic time for this process .",
    "the growth of the magnetic field is accompanied by appearance of the chaotic small - scale structure of the magnetic field .",
    "if the characteristic reconnection time in smaller scales is comparable with characteristic time @xmath170 of the magnetic field amplification due to mri action , then reconnection could lead to a delay in the magnetic field growth , and hence could decrease the efficiency of mr explosion .",
    "for the estimation of the characteristic time for the magnetic field reconnection we use the formula for the reconnection time of the quickest - petschek - type reconnection ( @xcite , @xcite ) :    @xmath171    where @xmath172 is the alfv@xmath173n speed , @xmath174 is the magnetic reynolds number , @xmath175 is the length , @xmath176 is the velocity , @xmath14 is the density , @xmath12 is the microscopic plasma conductivity , @xmath53 is the light speed . in the region",
    "where the mri is developing we have the following parameters : @xmath177 cm / s , @xmath178 cm , @xmath179 , @xmath180 g .    the plasma conductivity due to binary collisions @xmath12 is defined as ( see e.g. @xcite )    @xmath181    where @xmath182 g is the electron mass",
    ", @xmath183 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath184 is the electron charge , @xmath185 is the ion charge , @xmath186 is the coulomb logarithm , @xmath187k is the temperature .",
    "the above expression gives the conductivity of electrons in a non - relativistic , non - degenerate plasma .",
    "relativity may be taken approximately by substituting the light speed @xmath188 instead of the expression in brackets in ( [ cond ] ) , and increasing the electron mass in the numerator by relativistic factor @xmath189 . substituting all these data in formula ( [ cond ] )",
    "we find that conductivity is @xmath190 .",
    "note , the degeneracy of the electrons increase its conductivity , so this estimation may be considered as a lower limit for @xmath12 .",
    "the magnetic reynolds number in our case is @xmath191 . substituting these data into the formula ( [ rec ] ) we find the absolute lower limit for the characteristic reconnection time as",
    "@xmath192 our numerical simulations show that the characteristic time of the development of mri is much smaller ( @xmath132 times ) than the characteristic reconnection time .",
    "we can conclude that the reconnection processes will not suppress magnetic field amplification and hence mr supernova explosion .",
    "the formula ( [ rec ] ) for the characteristic time of the reconnection used here for the petschek - type reconnection is the lower limit for the reconnection time .",
    "we can not assert that this type of the reconnection will be realized in the case of mr supernova mechanism while in the case of the realization of any other reconnection model the reconnection time will be even larger .",
    "the results of the 2d numerical simulations of the mr supernova explosion with the initial dipole - like magnetic field have shown that mr supernova explosion is sensitive to the magnetic field configuration .",
    "mr supernova explosion with the initial quadrupole - like magnetic field develops mainly near the equatorial plane . in the case of the dipole - like magnetic significant part of the ejected matter obtains a velocity along the rotational axis .",
    "the total energy of the explosion in the mr mechanism does not depend significantly on the topology of the initial magnetic field .",
    "the explosion energy for quadrupole - like magnetic field is approximately equal to @xmath193 erg @xcite , and for the dipole - like magnetic field its value is about @xmath194 erg .",
    "the amount of the ejected mass is approximately the same in both cases @xmath195 .",
    "comparison of the explosion times for the dipole - like and the quadrupole - like fields of the same initial magnetic energy , shows that in the quadrupole case the explosion is developing faster .",
    "the time of the explosion for the @xmath196 is about @xmath197 s in the dipole case , and is about @xmath198 s in the case of the quadrupole .    in both cases",
    "we have done 2d simulations in a wide range of the initial magnetic field strength .",
    "the parameter @xmath141 ( the ratio between the initial magnetic energy and the gravitational energy of the star at the moment of `` turning on '' of the magnetic field ) was chosen as    @xmath199    comparison of the results of 1d simulations from @xcite , with a dependence of the mr explosion time on @xmath141 as @xmath200 with corresponding 2d results ( fig.[mri ] ) , shows a qualitative difference between them .",
    "the reason is a development of the mri in 2d - case , which reduces drastically the mr explosion time @xmath144 . for the values of @xmath201 the dependence ( [ mri1d ] ) holds approximately , while for smaller @xmath141 values the mr explosion time depends on @xmath141 in the following way :    @xmath202    the axial protojet forming in our simulations is not narrow , while propagating through the envelope of the massive star this protojet could be collimated , or suffer mass entrainment and deceleration .",
    "the collapse does not lead to strong amplification of the toroidal field , because its time in the central parts is comparable with rotation time . besides , the initial configuration is probably stable against mhd instabilities and ( in reality ) contains both parts , toroidal and poloidal , of the magnetic field .",
    "the relation between these components , and details of the initial angular velocity distribution ( uniform in our case ) may lead to different situations , when mri starts to develop during the collapse , or after many rotational periods of the new born neutron star . here",
    "we investigate the second case , as the initial step to the problem .",
    "the time separation of the hydrodynamic collapse from mri and mre helped us to understand the physical picture of mri development , and to obtain the estimations for the energy production in mre .",
    "we plan to extend our calculations to a more realistic case when magnetic field will be included at the very beginning of the collapse .",
    "we expect to obtain more complicated picture of magnetohydrodynamical processes , which should not influence strongly on the energy production , depending mainly on the initial rotational energy and angular velocity distribution .    in the paper by @xcite",
    "a similar problem with rather strong initial magnetic field was simulated , and , contrary to our results , the authors did not find the development of mri .",
    "their simulations of the supernova explosion with weaker magnetic field did not lead to the development of mri either and hence they did not get supernova explosion for a weak initial magnetic field .",
    "the authors ( @xcite ) claim that mri did not develop in their simulations due to the insufficient spatial resolution .",
    "the absence of the mri in their calculations most probably is connected with a rather large numerical viscosity of the numerical scheme they used .",
    "the numerical viscosity of the simulations depends on characteristic size of the mesh .",
    "the bigger is the size of the cell the larger is the numerical viscosity . in the section [ sect_mri ]",
    "we have discussed the change of the mri appearing time moment in dependence of the spatial resolution of our grid . in the case",
    "when the spatial resolution of the grid is very rough we should not get mri in the case of application of our numerical method also .",
    "it is known from the observations that the shapes of core collapse supernovae are different . from our simulations",
    "it follows that mr supernova explosion arises after development of the mri .",
    "the development of the mri is a stochastic process and hence the resulting shape of the supernova can vary .",
    "we may conclude that mr supernova explosion mechanism can lead to different shape of the supernova .",
    "it is important to point out that mr mechanism of supernova explosion leads always to asymmetrical outbursts .",
    "the simulations of the mr supernova explosions for the initial quadrupole - like magnetic field described in the paper by @xcite and mr supernova explosion described in current paper are restricted by the symmetry to the equatorial plane . while in reality this symmetry can be violated due to the mri , simultaneous presence of the initial dipole and quadrupole -like magnetic field ( @xcite ) and initial toroidal magnetic field ( @xcite ) .",
    "the violation of the symmetry could lead to the kick effect and formation of rapidly moving radio pulsars .",
    "when rotational and magnetic axes do not coincide the whole picture of the explosion process is three dimensional .",
    "nevertheless , the magnetic field twisting happens always around the rotational axis , so we may expect the kick velocity of the neutron star be strongly correlated with its spin direction , also due to the anisotropy of the neutrino flux @xcite .",
    "simultaneously , because of the stochastic nature of mri , the level of the anisotropy should be strongly variable , leading to a large spreading in the the neutron star velocities .",
    "this prediction of mr explosion differs from the models with a powerful neutrino convection , where arbitrary direction of the kick velocity is expected ( @xcite ) .",
    "recent analysis of observations of pulsars ( @xcite ) shows , that rotation and velocity vectors of pulsars are aligned , as it is predicted by the mr supernova mechanism .",
    "the alignment of the vectors can be violated in the case when supernova explodes in a binary system .",
