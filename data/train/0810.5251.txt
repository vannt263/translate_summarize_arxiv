    "molecules in strong laser fields have attracted a great deal of attention in the past few years . indeed , strong - field phenomena , such as high - order harmonic generation , above - threshold",
    "ionization , and nonsequential double ionization , may be used as tools for measuring and even controlling dynamic processes in such systems with attosecond precision @xcite .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the fact that the physical mechanisms behind such phenomena take place within a fraction of the period of the laser field . for a typical , titanium - sapphire laser used in experiments ,",
    "whose period is of the order @xmath3 , this means hundreds of attoseconds .    explicitly , such phenomena can be described as the laser - assisted rescattering or recombination of an electron with its parent ion , or molecule @xcite . at an instant @xmath4",
    "this electron reaches the continuum through tunneling or multiphoton ionization .",
    "subsequently , it propagates in the continuum , being accelerated by the external field .",
    "finally , it is driven back towards its parent ion , or molecule , with which it recombines or rescatters at a later instant @xmath5 . in the former case",
    ", the electron kinetic energy is converted in a high - energy , xuv photon , and high - order harmonic generation ( hhg ) takes place @xcite . in the latter case , one may distinguish two specific scenarios : the electron may suffer an elastic collision , which will lead to high - order above - threshold ionization ( ati ) @xcite , or transfer part of its kinetic energy to the core , and release other electrons . hence , laser - induced nonsequential double ( nsdi ) , or multiple ionization ( nsmi )",
    "will occur .    for molecules",
    ", there exist at least two centers with which the electron may recombine or rescatter .",
    "this leads to interference patterns which are due to photoelectron or high - harmonic emission at spatially separated centers , and which contain information about its specific structure . in the simplest case of diatomic molecules , such patterns have been described as the microscopic counterpart of a double - slit experiment @xcite .",
    "a legitimate question is what sets of electron orbits are most relevant for the two- or many - center interference patterns . to understand this issue is a first step towards controlling such processes by , for instance , an adequate choice of the shape and polarization of the external field . in the specific case of diatomic molecules ,",
    "the electron may start and return to the same center @xmath0 , or leave from a center @xmath0 and return to a center @xmath6 .",
    "hence , in total , there exist four possible processes that contribute to the yield .",
    "recently , these processes have been addressed in several studies , for above - threshold ionization usach2006,hbf2007,dm2006,bccm2007,milos2008 , high - order harmonic generation @xcite and nonsequential double ionization @xcite .",
    "the vast majority of these studies has been performed using semi - analytical methods , in the context of the strong - field approximation . in this framework",
    ", the transition amplitude can be written as a multiple integral with a slowly varying prefactor and a semiclassical action .",
    "the structure of the molecule may be either incorporated in the former @xcite , or in the latter @xcite . on a more specific level , when solving these integrals employing saddle - point methods , it is possible to draw a space - time picture of the laser - assisted rescattering or recombination process in question , and establish a direct connection to the orbits of a classical electron in a strong laser field @xcite . by incorporating the structure of the molecule in the action ,",
    "one obtains modified saddle - point equations which gives the one - or two - center scenarios .    in a previous publication @xcite",
    ", we have addressed this issue to a large extent for high - order harmonic generation , within the strong - field approximation ( sfa ) .",
    "our results suggested that the maxima and minima observed in the spectra were due to the quantum interference of the processes in which the electron leaves and returns to a specific center @xmath7 in the molecule with those in which it leaves from @xmath0 , but returns to a different center @xmath8 there exist , however , a few ambiguities as far as the interpretation of our findings is concerned . for instance , in the length - gauge formulation of the sfa , we found additional potential energy shifts , which depend on the field strength @xmath9 and in the internuclear separation @xmath10 these shifts led to a strong suppression of tunnel ionization at one of the centers .",
    "this could have led to the conclusion that the interference between other processes were not relevant for the patterns in the spectra .    in this proceeding ,",
    "we investigate the role of the one and two - center recombination scenarios in more detail .",
    "in particular , we analyze the above - mentioned potential energy shifts and their influence on the spectra ,  for smaller internuclear distances than those taken in @xcite . we also provide an alternative interpretation of the results encountered , based on effective prefactors and single - atom saddle - point equations .",

    "even if single - atom saddle - point equations are taken , we found a suppression in the yield for one of the centers of the molecule .",
    "this in principle counterintuitive result is related to the fact that the electron start time @xmath38 has a non - vanishing imaginary part , which suppresses or enhances the yield through the corresponding prefactors .",
