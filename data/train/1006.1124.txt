    "the 2 particle irreducible ( 2pi ) effective functional technique provides a powerful tool to deal with controlled nonequilibrium dynamics with non - secularity and late time universality @xcite .",
    "it gives the kadanoff - baym ( kb ) equation which describes the dynamics for quantum fluctuations of fields . in 1960s , baym and kadanoff studied the schwinger - dyson ( sd ) equation for the two - point function @xmath2 for nonequilibrium systems  @xcite on the basis of a functional approach developed by luttinger and ward @xcite .",
    "then baym reformulated it in terms of variational principle , introducing the so - called @xmath3-derivable approximation  @xcite which is given by a truncated set of closed 2pi diagrams .",
    "the main virtue of this approximation is that the resulting equations conserve the charge , energy and momentum of the system .",
    "this approach has been reformulated by use of path integral method  @xcite .",
    "it is applied to a variety of areas in physics , such as cosmology , ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions , or condensed matter physics . in describing the reheating processes during the early stage of inflation",
    ", it becomes necessary to trace the time evolution of slowly evolving inflaton field and quantum fluctuations  @xcite . in condensed matter physics",
    "it can be applied to bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) , since 2pi approach is a candidate with properties of gapless excitation and conservation laws  @xcite . the 2pi approach with the kb equation",
    "would be useful also in understanding the early thermalization processes towards quark - gluon plasma formation in high - energy heavy - ion collisions  @xcite , while it may be necessary to combine the classical field dynamics leading to the linear rise of entropy from the chaotic nature of the system  @xcite .",
    "in this paper we focus on the 2pi approach to the scalar @xmath0 theory , where identical bosons interact one another in the symmetric phase .",
    "the @xmath0 model has been employed in the vacuum and thermal equilibrium analyses and it is also applied to time dependent phenomena  @xcite . it can be used in inflationary processes of the early universe , the formation of bose - einstein condensate in the laboratory , and the chiral phase transition in heavy ion collisions .",
    "the dynamics of the chiral phase transition following the expansion of a quark - gluon plasma produced in relativistic heavy ion collisions has been analyzed by an @xmath4 @xmath5 model in the leading order of @xmath1 expansion  @xcite .    in the analysis of the @xmath0 model ,",
    "the large @xmath6 approximation ( or the @xmath1 expansion ) has been applied since 1960s or 1970s in both statistical mechanics and quantum field theory  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1 expansion has the advantage over the loop expansion that it is not restricted to small couplings .",
    "however a naive diagrammatic @xmath1 expansion breaks down when it is applied to the dynamical simulations , because a secular ( unbounded ) time evolution prevents the description of the late - time behavior of quantum field . as an improved treatment",
    ", we can take account of the self - consistency in the 1 particle irreducible ( 1pi ) effective action , which corresponds to the first legendre transformation of the generating functional with respect to the expectation value of the field , but the 1pi effective action is also plagued by the secular problems and unitarity violation ; for example @xmath7 can become negative in the late time behavior  @xcite . therefore in order to extract the stable evolution without the above secularity we need to go beyond the 1pi technique , so that we adopt 2pi technique as the simplest example .",
    "recently a systematic @xmath1 expansion of the 2pi effective action has been applied to a scalar @xmath0 in the symmetric and broken phases  @xcite . by resuming all 2 particle reducible diagrams with higher order secularity with respect to time , 2pi approach with the kb equation",

    "recently nnlo of the @xmath1 expansion is derived  @xcite and the rapid convergence property for moderate values of @xmath1 is observed  @xcite .",
    "numerical analyses show the thermalization of the distribution function derived from the two - point green s function for the truncated self - energy .",
    "however there is no consideration of kinetic entropy and its h - theorem based on the kb equation .",
    "thus we concentrate to derive the analytic expression of the entropy current @xmath9 in nonequilibrium from kb equation and to show that the h - theorem is satisfied at the level of the green s function analytically for the nlo self - energy of the @xmath1 expansion in the symmetric phase . in the end",
    ", we aim to give a criteria whether thermalization occurs or not in off - shell propagation for given self - energy or collision processes . in @xmath10 theory with the nlo self - energy of the coupling expansion , numerical simulations without gradient expansion in refs .",

    "we find that the resultant h - theorem is consistent with numerical analyses performed for the @xmath0 theory .",
    "judging from this consistency , the proof of the h - theorem might be a criterion to confirm whether thermalization occurs or not without numerical simulation .",
    "it might be possible to investigate qualitative properties of entropy production in quantum field theories such as non - abelian gauge theory , which we still have difficulty in numerical estimate , for example , due to singularities in massless quantum fluctuations .",
    "we also give an analytic expression of the entropy density @xmath11 in thermal equilibrium derived from the thermodynamic potential ( 2pi effective action ) with nlo skeletons of the @xmath1 expansion .",
    "the present entropy density @xmath12 based on the h - theorem should correspond to the entropy density @xmath11 in thermal equilibrium .",
    "we find that entropy density @xmath12 is consistent with the entropy density @xmath11 in thermal equilibrium if we can regularize skeletons in higher loop order .",

    "next we derive an analytic expresson of the entropy current for the relativistic field theory in the symmetric phase , and show the h - theorem for the @xmath0 theory in nlo of the @xmath1 expansion . in the derivation",
    "we adopt the gradient expansion with respect to coordinate space , which is necessary to violate time reversal invariance of the kb equation . when we ignore higher order derivative terms , spatial fluctuations in a small volume",

    "we can confirm that two components ( [ eq : pidl1 ] ) and ( [ eq : phil1 ] ) cancel each other precisely and that @xmath186 is verified for lo skeleton of @xmath1 expansion .",
    "furthermore we shall derive the expression of @xmath194 for the nlo skeletons of the @xmath1 expansion in the @xmath0 theory by writing down two components of @xmath184 explicitly and investigate whether @xmath195 is satisfied or not in this order .",
    "we find the @xmath196-loop @xmath197 order nlo skeleton per particle component is given by @xmath198 for the above skeletons the explicit form of first and second component in @xmath184 is given in appendix a. then we find that it might be possible to prove @xmath195 for each loop order of nlo skeletons of the @xmath1 expansion .",
    "however we also notice that these skeletons might have singularities at the points where energy denominator vanishes for @xmath199 .",
    "memory correction terms can appear when momentum integration with these denominators can not be regularized  @xcite .",
    "then we have to carefully estimate the singularities and add the memory correction terms in the definition of entropy current .",
    "hence the possibility of the appearance of memory correction terms is not completely denied .",
    "in this article , we have discussed the entropy density and the h - theorem in the kadanoff - baym equation for the @xmath0 theory with the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) self - energy of the @xmath1 expansion .",
    "while many numerical analyses show thermalization in the kadanoff - baym equation takes place , it is desired to confirm thermalization analytically for a given form of the self - energy .",
    "thus we have derived the relativistic kinetic entropy and confirmed that the h - theorem is satisfied for local parts of the nlo self - energy .",
    "we have adopted the gradient expansion and taken account of the 1st order terms of the kadanoff - baym equation .",
    "the gradient expansion is an appropriate approximation in treating moderately changing systems in space - time .",
    "since we ignore higher order derivative terms , spatial fluctuations in a small volume are assumed to vanish .",
    "thus the gradient expansion corresponds to a coarse graining procedure .",
    "time reversal invariance is violated by the gradient expansion of the ( time reversible ) kadanoff - baym equation .",
    "then it is suggested that the kb dynamics obtains the time arrow at the level of the green s function , and that the observed system at late time will reach the maximum entropy state where local equilibrium is realized .",
    "the reliability of the gradient expansion and the form of the self - energy are important in the proof of the h - theorem . from the proof of the h - theorem we find that any change of the green s function with nonzero collision term contributes to entropy production .",
    "the entropy production is ensured at the level of the green s function ( no need of quasiparticle approximation ) . when local thermal equilibrium is realized , the collision term contribution vanishes and entropy ceases to increase .",
    "the proof of h - theorem is consistent with the numerical analyses of the @xmath0 model .",
    "thus the proof might provide a criterion whether thermalization occurs or not even in the cases when numerical analyses are difficult to perform .",
    "we have also considered the entropy density @xmath11 derived from thermodynamic potential , and compared with the kinetic entropy density .",
    "when we only take account of the principal value part in the momentum integral for @xmath11 , @xmath11 corresponds to the kinetic entropy density in thermal equilibrium . however",
    "if singularities remain in the energy denominators , memory correction terms might appear .",
    "hence entropy current have the possibility to have additional terms in its definition .",
