    "the coma cluster of galaxies ( abell 1656 ) is one of the most extensively studied in our neighbourhood ( see e.g. biviano 1998 and references therein ) . starting with the seminal paper of kent & gunn ( 1982 ) significant effort went into dynamical modelling of the cluster . in the early studies based on about 300 galaxy velocities",
    "only velocity dispersion was modelled and it was most often assumed that the mass follows light and that the galaxies are on isotropic orbits .",
    "merritt ( 1987 ) showed that if a larger variety of models is allowed there is a strong degeneracy between the dark matter distribution and velocity anisotropy and many models can be shown to be consistent with the data . without any prior knowledge on the mass distribution even considering higher velocity moments",
    "would probably not be of much help .",
    "recently , due to theoretical progress mainly by the means of @xmath0-body simulations , our knowledge on possible dark matter distributions within gravitationally bound objects has improved significantly .",
    "there seems to be general agreement at least as to the behaviour of dark matter density profiles at large radial distances ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "whether the inner dark matter density profile is @xmath10 ( as in the so - called universal profile advocated by navarro , frenk & white 1997 , hereafter nfw ) or @xmath11 ( as preferred by moore et al .",
    "1998 ; see also fukushige & makino 1997 ) or is flat ( as suggested by the observed rotation curves of dwarf and low surface brightness galaxies , e.g. mcgaugh & de blok 1998 ) is still a matter of debate ( a recent analysis by jimenez , verde & oh ( 2003 ) of high resolution rotation curves of spiral galaxies shows that 2/3 of the sample can be accounted by nfw profiles , but 2/3 also with a flat core ) .",
    "we therefore consider a generalised profile with different inner slopes and also allow for different dark matter concentrations .",
    "we constrain this variety of dark matter density profiles by modelling velocity moments of galaxies .",
    "in addition to constraints from the line - of - sight velocity dispersion profile , we incorporate constraints from the fourth velocity moment , the kurtosis .",
    "the nfw profile has been found consistent with the total mass distribution inferred from the galaxy data combined from many clusters in the cnoc1 ( van der marel et al .",
    "2000 ) and enacs ( biviano et al . 2003 ) surveys .",
    "although van der marel et al .",
    "( 2000 ) considered higher velocity moments they did not apply them rigorously to further constrain the mass distribution .",
    "studies based upon x - rays , assuming that the hot x - ray emitting gas is in hydrostatic equilibrium in a spherical potential , usually lead to nfw - like cuspy centres ( mclaughlin 1999 ; tamura et al .",
    "2000 ; sato et al .",
    "the studies based on gravitational lensing focus on the inner shape of the density profile .",
    "the slopes agree with the nfw prediction in some studies ( e.g. broadhurst et al . 2000 ) while one team finds a preference for a flat core ( tyson , kochanski & dellantonio 1998 , see also williams , navarro & bartelmann 1999 ) .",
    "note that the coma cluster is too close for its mass profile to be probed through gravitational lensing .",
    "the amount of galaxy velocity as well as brightness and morphological type measurements for the members of coma has increased over the last two decades making it possible to analyse separately the samples of elliptical and spiral galaxies .",
    "while ellipticals appear to be in dynamical equilibrium justifying the application of jeans formalism to study their velocity moments , most of the spirals are probably infalling onto the cluster .",
    "the modelling of the infall of spirals will be presented in the follow - up study .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section  2",
    "we describe our data .",
    "in section  3 we present our assumptions concerning the matter content of the cluster , i.e. the distributions of galaxies , gas and dark matter .",
    "section  4 outlines our formalism for modelling the velocity moments of elliptical galaxies based on jeans equations .",
    "section  5 presents its application to constrain the parameters of our model , in particular the distribution of dark matter in the cluster .",
    "the discussion follows in section  6 .",
    "we have searched the ned database for galaxies within @xmath12 of ra=12h59m35.7s , dec=@xmath13 ( j2000 ) i.e. the position of the elliptical galaxy ngc 4874 , well established as the centre of the coma cluster ( kent & gunn 1982 ) .",
    "the galaxies were required to have velocities between @xmath14 and @xmath15 km / s ( given the velocity dispersions we will find below , this velocity range extends to @xmath16 ) . for the calculation of the velocity moments and the subsequent study of kinematics , we remove from the list galaxy pairs and known members of pairs ( as given by ned ) , as we wish to probe the global cluster potential but not its local enhancements .",
    "we then obtain a sample of 1068 galaxies shown in the upper panel of figure  [ gal ] as points in the plane of velocity versus distance from the centre of the cluster . to determine the membership of galaxies in the cluster we proceed in a similar fashion as kent & gunn ( 1982 ) . as can be seen from figure  [ gal ] ,",
    "the members of the cluster are well separated from the foreground and background galaxies in velocity space .",
    "we have therefore selected the probable members of coma as lying within the two curves shown in figure  [ gal ] , symmetric with respect to @xmath17 km / s , the value close to the mean velocity of the cluster .",
    "this procedure leaves us with 967 galaxies . for the determination of the luminosity distribution",
    ", we keep the members of galaxy pairs and remove a few galaxies for which no magnitude estimate is available ( they may contribute to the calculation of velocity moments however ) .",
    "we then proceed with the membership determination as before .",
    "it is generally believed that only early - type ( e - s0 ) galaxies can be considered in dynamical equilibrium within a cluster in opposition to spirals which are believed to be infalling ( e.g. tully & shaya 1984 ; huchra 1985 ) .",
    "we therefore construct separate samples of e - s0 and spiral galaxies .",
    "the morphological type of the galaxies has been determined by consulting the ned , simbad and leda databases . among the 967 galaxies belonging to coma and",
    "selected for the analysis of the velocity moments , we find @xmath18 e - s0s , @xmath19 spirals and @xmath20 other galaxies for which the morphological classification is unknown or uncertain .",
    "as already noticed by kent & gunn ( 1982 ) , the cluster shows a clear morphological segregation .",
    "the distributions of e - s0s and spirals in the @xmath21 plane are shown in the middle and lower panel of figure  [ gal ] .",
    "comparison of the two plots reveals that while e - s0s cluster and dominate in the central parts of coma and are not numerous at radial distances larger than @xmath22 , spirals are more uniformly distributed and underrepresented in the central region .",
    "similar subsamples are constructed for the analysis of the luminosity distribution .",
    "note that iterating on the mean velocity and establishing new symmetric envelopes for the cluster in the observed phase space has virtually no effect on the cluster membership .",
    "we note a possible group of galaxies at @xmath23 and @xmath24 km / s that might have been missed , but contributes little to the central internal kinematics .",
    "the mass contributed by the stars in galaxies is estimated as follows .",
    "ideally , one would like to determine the surface luminosity distribution separately for different morphological types of galaxies , since transforming luminosity into mass requires mass - to - light ratios , which are known to vary with morphological type .",
    "however , since we do not know the morphological type for roughly half the galaxies in our sample , we would have to assume for these galaxies some mean value of the mass - to - light ratio . combining then the fits for the three classes of galaxies : e - s0s , spirals and those of unknown type would produce large uncertainties , since the luminosity distribution for spirals turns out to be quite noisy .",
    "therefore , in determining the total stellar mass distribution , we fit the luminosity distribution for all galaxies and then translate it to the mass distribution using a mean mass - to - light ratio .",
    "magnitudes are transformed into luminosities assuming that all galaxies are at the same distance associated with the mean velocity of the coma cluster . adopting an heliocentric velocity of coma of 6925 km / s ( struble & rood 1999 ) , and correcting for the velocity of the sun with respect to the local group and for the local group infall onto virgo",
    ", we obtain for coma a hubble flow velocity of 7093 km / s , which , for a hubble constant of @xmath25 ( assumed throughout this paper ) gives a distance of 101.3 mpc and a distance modulus of 35.03 ( neglecting the peculiar velocity of the coma cluster ) .",
    "as mentioned in the previous section , our sample of galaxies for the luminosity analysis is somewhat different from the one used for the calculation of velocity moments , as we no longer exclude the members of pairs .",
    "now , we have 985 galaxies that belong to coma , among which 366 e - s0s and 167 spirals . the surface luminosity profile of all galaxies is then determined by placing 60 galaxies per radial bin .",
    "the resulting distribution is shown as filled symbols in figure  [ surlum1 ] .",
    "the open symbols in the figure show a similar result for just e - s0 galaxies but this time with 30 galaxies per radial bin .",
    "this second distribution will be needed in the modelling of the velocity moments as the distribution of our tracer population .",
    "the data shown in figure  [ surlum1 ] do not indicate any presence of a core in the surface luminosity distributions , hence we fit them with projections of cuspy profiles .",
    "for both samples , of all galaxies as well as early - type ones , the distributions have a changing slope , so we fit them with a projection of the nfw profile ( bartelmann 1996 ; see also section 2.5 of okas & mamon 2001 ) .",
    "the fit is done by @xmath26 minimisation taking all points with equal weights ( although we do not know the errors of the magnitude measurements we expect them to be similar for galaxies in each bin ) .",
    "the 3d luminosity density will then be @xmath27 where the normalisation constant @xmath28 and the scale radius @xmath29 are the two fitting parameters .",
    "for the sample of all galaxies we obtain @xmath30arcmin@xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "for the e - s0s we have @xmath33arcmin@xmath31 and @xmath34 so this distribution turns out to be more concentrated and therefore steeper .",
    "it might be interesting to note that the _ number _ density distribution of the galaxies in our sample is less steep in the centre than the _ luminosity _ density distribution and can be approximated by a profile with a core .",
    "the steeper distribution of luminosity is probably mainly due to the presence of bright ellipticals in the centre of the cluster ( see figure  [ gal ] ) .    integrating the luminosity distribution ( [ c1 ] ) and multiplying by the appropriate mass - to - light ratio in the blue band , @xmath35",
    ", we obtain the mass distribution associated with the stars in galaxies @xmath36 we adopt the mass - to - light ratio in blue band for e - s0s of @xmath37 and for spirals @xmath38 . for the mass distribution of all galaxies",
    "we take the weighted mean of @xmath35 . since , for galaxies with known morphological type , the e - s0s and spirals appear in the proportions of @xmath39 , then assuming that the same proportion holds for the whole population , the mean mass - to - light ratio amounts to @xmath40 .      to approximate the contribution of the gas to the mass in the cluster",
    "we make use of the x - ray surface brightness distribution which can be well approximated by the following formula @xmath41^{-3 b + 1/2}.\\ ] ] briel , henry & bhringer ( 1992 ) analysed the rosat observations of coma out to @xmath42 in the energy band of 0.5 to 2.4 kev and obtained the following best - fitting parameters : @xmath43 erg @xmath44 s@xmath45 arcmin@xmath46 , @xmath47 and the core radius @xmath48 . assuming that the radiation is produced by bremsstrahlung this distribution is obtained by projecting the 3d emissivity integrated over the energy band and assuming that the gas is approximately isothermal .",
    "since the emissivity is proportional to the square of the number density of electrons in the gas @xmath49 , we obtain @xmath50^{-3 b/2 } \\ , \\ ] ] where the central electron density ( with @xmath51 ) is @xmath52 @xmath53 ( briel et al . 1992 ;",
    "henry & henriksen 1986 ) .",
    "integrating equation ( [ c4 ] ) and multiplying by the mass per electron we obtain the mass distribution associated with the gas @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the hypergeometric function and @xmath56 with @xmath57 is the mean mass of the positively charged ion in the gas per unit charge ( @xmath58 being the proton mass ) , assuming the gas has the primordial composition with helium abundance of @xmath59 .    the formula ( [ c3 ] ) for the surface brightness is the same as the one appearing in the so - called @xmath60-model ( we have replaced @xmath60 by @xmath61 to avoid confusion with the anisotropy parameter of the next section ) , however we do not accept all the assumptions of the model here concerning e.g. the relation between the gas and galaxy distributions .",
    "the only assumption going into the derivation of the gas mass distribution in equation ( [ c5 ] ) , besides spherical symmetry , is that the gas is isothermal , which is justified by recent observations of coma with xmm - newton by arnaud et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , who find very little temperature variation at least in the central region of radius @xmath62 .",
    "we study different possible density distributions of dark matter described by the following general formula @xmath63 where @xmath64 is a constant characteristic density , while @xmath65 is the scale radius of the dark matter ( in general different from that of the luminous distribution , @xmath66 ) .",
    "the profiles differ by the inner slope @xmath67 but have a common outer limiting behaviour of @xmath68 .",
    "we will consider @xmath1 values limited by @xmath69 , which covers a wide range of possible inner profiles : from very steep to core - like .",
    "the cuspy profiles of @xmath70 are motivated by the results of cosmological @xmath0-body simulations .",
    "the profile with @xmath71 corresponds to the so - called universal profile proposed by nfw as a fit to the profiles of simulated haloes , while the profile with @xmath72 is identical to the one following from higher resolution simulations of moore et al .",
    "the core profile with @xmath73 is favoured by some observations of galaxies and clusters and is very similar ( but not identical ) to the profile proposed by burkert ( 1995 ) .",
    "the scale radius @xmath74 introduced in equation ( [ m6 ] ) marks the distance from the centre of the object where the profile has a slope equal to the average of the inner and outer slope : @xmath75 .",
    "the other parameter that controls the shape of the profile is the concentration @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the virial radius , i.e. the distance from the centre of the halo within which the mean density is @xmath78 times the present critical density , @xmath79 .",
    "although in most cosmological @xmath0-body simulations @xmath80 is assumed and kept constant , the value , following from the spherical collapse model , depends on the underlying cosmology , e.g. @xmath81 is valid for the einstein - de sitter model , while , for the currently most popular @xmath82cdm model with @xmath83 and @xmath84 , we have @xmath85 ( eke , cole & frenk 1996 ; okas & hoffman 2001 ) .",
    "we will keep @xmath86 in the following .",
    "the concentration of simulated dark matter haloes has been observed to depend on the virial mass .",
    "jing & suto ( 2000 ) tested the relation @xmath87 for the masses of the order of normal galaxies and clusters in the case of density profiles with @xmath71 and @xmath72 and found concentrations slowly decreasing with mass ( thus confirming the original observation of nfw ) and lower for @xmath72 than for @xmath71 .",

    "the purpose of this work is to constrain the distribution of dark matter in the coma cluster by studying the velocity moments of the population of elliptical galaxies in the cluster which we believe to be in equilibrium ( thus neglecting radial streaming motions ) .",
    "we defer to a later paper the kinematical study of spiral galaxies in the context of infall .",
    "we will also assume that the system is spherically symmetric and that there are no net streaming motions ( e.g. no rotation ) so that the odd velocity moments vanish .",
    "at second order , the two distinct moments are @xmath95 and @xmath96 which we will denote hereafter by @xmath97 and @xmath98 respectively .",
    "they can be calculated from the lowest order jeans equation ( e.g. binney & mamon 1982 ) @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the 3d density distribution of the tracer population and @xmath101 is the gravitational potential",

    "it has been established that by studying @xmath120 alone we can not uniquely determine the properties of a stellar system .",
    "in fact , systems with different densities and velocity anisotropies can produce identical @xmath120 profiles ( see e.g. merrifield & kent 1990 ; merritt 1987 ) .",
    "it is therefore interesting to consider higher - order moments of the velocity distribution . for the fourth - order moments ,",
    "the three distinct components @xmath121 , @xmath122 and @xmath123 are related by two higher order jeans equations ( merrifield & kent 1990 ) .    in order to solve these equations",
    "we need additional information about the distribution function .",
    "we will restrict ourselves here to functions which can be constructed from the energy - dependent distribution function by multiplying it by a function of angular momentum @xmath124 with @xmath125 .",

    "a useful way to express the fourth projected moment is to scale it with @xmath132 in order to obtain the projected kurtosis @xmath133 whose value is 3 for a gaussian distribution .",
    "we use our sample of galaxy velocities to calculate the velocity moments of the e - s0 galaxies .",
    "the 355 available e - s0 galaxies were divided into bins of 39 objects .",

    "therefore , the virial radius for the total mass is @xmath178 times that of the dark matter , i.e. @xmath179 or @xmath151 mpc .    the cumulative mass - to - light ratio , i.e. the ratio of the total mass distribution to the luminosity distribution in galaxies , is @xmath180 where @xmath181 is given by equation ( [ c7 ] ) with ( [ c2 ] ) , ( [ c5 ] ) and ( [ d5 ] ) , while @xmath182 . in the lower panel of figure  [ massm2l ]",
    "we show @xmath183 for our best - fitting models for different @xmath1 , with parameters from table  [ parameters ] .",
    "the models differ towards the centre and only for @xmath71 does the distribution tend to a constant value in this limit , since we have used the nfw profile to fit the luminosity distribution of galaxies in section  2 . at radial distances larger than @xmath184 mpc , the cumulative mass - to - light ratio decreases slowly to reach @xmath185 at the total mass virial radius @xmath151 mpc .",
    "we studied the velocity moments of early - type galaxies in the coma cluster and used them to constrain the distribution of dark matter and velocity anisotropy .",
    "our analysis differs from previous analysis of optical data ( e.g. the & white 1986 ; merritt 1987 ; den hartog & katgert 1996 ; carlberg et al .",
    "1997 ; van der marel et al .",
    "2000 ; biviano et al . 2003 ; biviano & girardi 2003 ) , in that    1 .",
    "we have , for a single cluster , a larger sample of galaxies , which , given their early morphological type , should be in dynamical equilibrium in the cluster potential ; 2 .",
    "we remove pairs from the computation of the velocity moments ; 3 .",
    "we include kurtosis in the analysis ; 4 .",
    "we model dark matter distribution using a generalised formula inspired by the results of cosmological @xmath0-body simulations ; 5 .",
    "we include hot gas in our analysis .    in comparison to studies based upon stacking of many clusters , our analysis of the coma cluster benefits from not having to introduce errors in any stacking procedure , and from a cleaner removal of interlopers .",
    "on the other hand , the analyses of stacked clusters have the advantage of averaging out particular inhomogeneities of individual clusters such as coma , expected in hierarchical scenarios of structure formation .",
    "indeed , the coma cluster is known to have irregular structure both in projected space ( fitchett & webster 1987 ; mellier et al .",
    "1988 ; briel et al .",
    "1992 ) and velocity space ( colless & dunn 1996 ; biviano et al .",
    "in particular , the cluster has two central cd galaxies , ngc 4874 and ngc 4889 , of which the first one is the central galaxy of the main cluster and the second probably belonged to a subcluster which has recently merged with the main cluster ( e.g. colless & dunn 1996 ) .",
    "there are other subgroups , such as the one associated with ngc 4839 at around @xmath186 from ngc 4874 , close enough to the cluster centre to contribute to our analysis",
    ".    the question whether the e - s0 sample is relaxed and how the existing substructure may affect our results can only be fully addressed by cosmological @xmath0-body simulations including galaxy formation , where all 3-dimensional information would be available .",
    "although such an analysis has not yet been performed , the effect of the incomplete virialisation of structures of dark matter particles seen in cosmological simulations on the estimates of the mass of a single cluster through the jeans equation has been addressed by tormen , bouchet & white ( 1997 ) .",
    "they showed ( see the bottom row of their fig .",
    "17 ) that even for significantly perturbed haloes the mass @xmath181 at distances larger than 2% of the virial radius inferred by the proper jeans analysis is within 30% ( r.m.s . ) of the true mass and departs from it by less than 20% ( r.m.s . ) for average or relaxed haloes . since the dark matter distribution is known to possess more substructure than is observed in the galaxy distribution ( cosmological simulations predict many more milky way satellites than are observed , see e.g. moore et al .",
    "1999 ) and since structures cease to grow sooner in flat universes with a cosmological constant , in comparison with analogous structures growing within the einstein - de sitter model ( assumed in the simulations by tormen et al . ) , they are more regular today ( see thomas et al . 1998 ) than shown in the first three columns of the bottom row of figure  17 in tormen et al .",
    "we therefore believe that the discrepancy between our derived mass and the true cluster mass due to substructure and departures from equilibrium is significantly smaller than the uncertainty due to sampling errors of the velocity moments .",
    "our results for the dark and total mass of the cluster are consistent with previous estimates . using a combination of x - ray and optical data hughes ( 1989 ) found for his preferred model a total mass within @xmath187 ( where we used the notation @xmath188 ) to be @xmath189 , but a much wider range of masses if more general mass distributions were allowed .",
    "briel et al .",
    "( 1992 ) using rosat observations of coma and assuming hydrostatic equilibrium of the gas derived a mass within the same radial distance to be @xmath190 . also , by analysing the infall patterns around coma , geller , diaferio & kurtz ( 1999 ) find a mass of @xmath191 within the same distance to the cluster centre as above .",
    "extrapolating our results to this radial distance , we find an enclosed mass of @xmath192 , in good agreement with these three earlier estimates .",
    "we find a strong degeneracy between the inner slope and the concentration of the dark matter profile , with many combinations of the two reproducing our velocity profiles almost equally well . in the range of inner slopes",
    "@xmath69 we find that the best - fitting models have the two parameters related almost linearly as @xmath193 with very little variation in the remaining fitting parameters , @xmath141 and @xmath60 .",
    "the particular shape of the degeneracy between @xmath2 and @xmath1 is due to the specific properties of the family of dark matter profiles used in this analysis , coupled with our lack of velocity data at radii smaller than the scale radius ( @xmath194 ) of the dark matter .",
    "using smaller radial bins would allow us to probe smaller radial distances , but at the expense of larger sampling errors in the velocity moments . as is clear from figure 7 , the best - fitting dark matter profiles obtained for different inner slopes are almost the same for a wide range of distances ( larger than 3% of the virial radius ) and this can only be achieved with the combination of the parameters as given in table 1 .",
    "note that our best fit to the data for the flat dark matter density profile might mean that the data may be even better fitted with the unphysical model where the dark matter density profile rises with radius in the cluster centre , i.e. @xmath195 in equation ( [ m6 ] ) .",
    "our best - fitting nfw profile ( @xmath71 ) has a concentration @xmath171 ( in agreement with the above formula ) , 50% higher than @xmath139 found in @xmath0-body simulations .",
    "it should be kept in mind , however , that the concentration parameters in the simulations are subject to substantial scatter and that the formula ( [ c6a ] ) ( giving @xmath139 ) at masses of the order of @xmath142 is actually an extrapolation of results obtained for lower mass haloes ( see bullock et al .",
    "2001 ) . however , the `` standard '' nfw model with @xmath139 is still within our @xmath159 confidence region in figure  [ allplots ] .    in comparison ,",
    "fits of the nfw profile to x - ray data of clusters , assumed isothermal , by ettori & fabian ( 1999 ) , rescaled by wu & xue ( 2000 ) , as well as by sato et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , both yield @xmath196 for the mass that we find for coma within the virial radius ( the latter after correction from @xmath197 to @xmath198 ) , which is only within our @xmath175 confidence region",
    ". it may be that the assumption of isothermal hot gas causes a lower concentration parameter .    in an analysis similar in spirit to ours , biviano et al .",
    "( 2003 ) report @xmath199 for their stacked ensemble of 59 enacs clusters , fitted to an nfw model for the total mass density .",
    "similarly , biviano & girardi ( 2003 ) show that nfw models with @xmath200 are consistent with a stacked ensemble of 43 2dfgrs clusters .",
    "moreover , the enacs and 2dfgrs clusters analysed in both studies are on average less massive ( i.e. with lower velocity dispersions ) than coma , and given that cosmological simulations find a decreasing @xmath2 for increasing mass , the discrepancy with our result is even stronger .",
    "the difference of these four studies with our result may be explained by the fact that the authors mentioned above fit the _ total _ mass density profile to the nfw form , while our fit was done for the distribution of the dark component only .",
    "if the gas is distributed similarly in the x - ray , enacs and 2dfgrs clusters as in coma , i.e. it has a flat inner core , and the gas on average contributes a substantial part of the total mass , fitting the total mass distribution may result in flatter profiles than the dark haloes really have .",
    "the discrepancy may be also caused by the exclusion of central cds by biviano et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , although we feel that removing one or two galaxies from our central bin of 39 galaxies will not affect our results . alternatively",
    ", their mass model ( obtained with the assumption of isotropic orbits ) may not be coherent with the kurtosis profile of their stacked cluster .",
    "our best fit models have orbits that are very close to isotropic , as is expected , in the central regions , where the two - body relaxation time for the galaxy system is considerably smaller than the age of the universe , and also because cosmological simulations indicate that dark matter particles typically have isotropic orbits in the centres of clusters ( thomas et al .",
    "1998 ; huss , jain & steinmetz 1999 ) .",
    "in other words , we find no significant anisotropy bias for the galaxies relative to the expectations of isotropy for the dark matter .",
    "note that if we force isotropic orbits for the galaxies , we then obtain similar constraints for the inner slope , concentration parameter and mass of the dark matter component within the virial radius as those shown in figure  [ allplots ] .",
    "one might wish to better reproduce the kurtosis profile .",
    "it is clear from figure  [ dkfit ] that , while the velocity dispersion profile is well reproduced , there is room for improvement for the kurtosis profile .",
    "however , as discussed in section  4 , the kurtosis is mainly sensitive to the velocity anisotropy , which was modelled here by a single constant parameter . besides",
    ", the curves shown in figure  [ dkfit ] are the results of joint fitting of both moments and do not aim at reproducing the kurtosis alone . in spite of this , the inclusion of the kurtosis in our analysis allowed us to constrain the velocity anisotropy and other parameters of the model .    from our best estimate of the mass distribution ,",
    "the baryons ( galaxies and gas ) contribute 15% of the total mass at the dark matter virial radius @xmath176 mpc ( see figure  [ massm2l ] ) .",
    "if we assume that the cluster content is representative of the universe as a whole , we can use this baryon fraction to estimate the density parameter @xmath201 ( see e.g. white et al . 1993 ) . taking the baryonic density parameter at its currently best value from nucleosynthesis @xmath202 ( with @xmath51 )",
    "we obtain @xmath203 where the error comes from our 30% uncertainty in the dark virial mass value , 20% uncertainty in the gas mass ( as estimated by white et al .",
    "1993 ) and 10% error in the @xmath204 value ( burles , nollett & turner 2001 ) .",
    "similarly , we may assume that clusters are good tracers , within their virial radius , of the ratio of mass to blue luminosity .",
    "given that the closure mass - to - light ratio ( critical density over luminosity density ) in the blue band is roughly @xmath205 to 10% accuracy , consistent with the recent estimates of luminosity density from the 2dfgrs ( norberg et al .",
    "2002 ) and sdss ( blanton et al . 2001 ) galaxy surveys ( after correction to the blue band ) , our mass - to - light ratio within the virial radius of @xmath7 with 30% accuracy yields @xmath206 .",
    "combining these two estimates of the density parameter , we arrive at @xmath207 in excellent agreement with other determinations , for example the recent value obtained from the wmap cmb experiment ( spergel et al .",

    "the validity of modelling presented in this paper rests on proper estimation of the velocity moments and their errors from observations .",
    "if their sampling distributions tend to normality , the statistics obtained from a sample ( e.g. moments ) can be characterised by an expectation value and a ` standard ' error ( stuart & ord 1994 ) .",
    "for simplest statistics , like the second central moment , those can be calculated exactly from the population moments assuming the population properties .",
    "since we are interested here also in quantities whose standard errors are not easily calculated analytically , we resort to monte carlo methods .    the most natural estimators of the variance and kurtosis from a sample of @xmath49 line - of - sight velocity measurements @xmath208 are @xmath209 and @xmath210 where @xmath211 is the mean of galaxy velocities in the sample .    to investigate the distribution of these estimators for our binning of galaxies , i.e. when @xmath212 , we ran monte carlo simulations by selecting @xmath213 times @xmath212 numbers from a gaussian distribution with zero mean and dispersion of unity .",
    "since velocity distributions of gravitationally bound objects in general do not dramatically depart from a gaussian , this is a sufficient approximation for constructing unbiased estimators of moments .      for each of the @xmath214 samples we compute the statistic @xmath215 , namely @xmath216 or @xmath217 according to prescriptions given by equations ( [ app1 ] ) and ( [ app2 ] ) .",
    "the monte carlo estimate of our statistic is then the mean of all values obtained @xmath218 and its variance is @xmath219 we find that the best estimates obtained in this way are biased , especially for kurtosis ( it is interesting to note , that the value of kurtosis is underestimated by a few percent even for much larger samples with @xmath49 of the order of few hundred ) . in addition , while the sampling distribution of velocity dispersion is gaussian to a very good approximation , the one for kurtosis is strongly skewed . using this knowledge we construct unbiased and gaussian - distributed estimators of line - of - sight velocity dispersion @xmath220 and kurtosis - like variable @xmath221 @xmath222 @xmath223^{1/10 } .\\ ] ] the factor @xmath224 in equation ( [ app4 ] ) is the well known correction for bias when estimating the sample variance , valid independently of the underlying distribution . in ( [ app5 ] )",
    "the factor @xmath225 corrects for the bias in the kurtosis estimate , i.e. unbiased estimate of kurtosis is @xmath226 , while the rather complicated function of @xmath227 assures that the sampling distribution of @xmath221 is approximately gaussian .",
    "examples of sampling distributions of @xmath220 and @xmath221 from our monte carlo simulation are shown in figure  [ sampling ] .",
    "we find that the standard errors in the case of @xmath220 are of the order of 11% ( in agreement with an analytic result derivable with the assumption of gaussian velocity distribution ) while in the case of @xmath221 are approximately 2% .",
    "the measured values of @xmath118 and @xmath167 calculated from our velocity data using equations ( [ app4])-([app5 ] ) and ( [ app1])-([app2 ] ) are shown in figure  [ vdkurte2 ] .",

    "the values of kurtosis are @xmath226 with approximate @xmath159 error bars propagated from the 2% error in @xmath221 .",
    "it is also important to check whether the sampling distributions of the two statistics are independent . in general , the covariance between , e.g. even moments derived from the same sample does not vanish , even for gaussian distributions ( stuart & ord 1994 ) .",
    "however , the lowest order term is expected to decrease with the size of the sample @xmath49 . to check whether @xmath212 in our case is indeed large enough to assure independence of @xmath220 and @xmath221",

    ", we find the correlation coefficient of @xmath230 .",
    "to check the behaviour of @xmath220 and @xmath221 for velocity distributions departing from gaussianity , we repeated the monte carlo simulation , again sampling @xmath212 numbers from a gaussian distribution , but modifying each sample by removing the 6 most inner points and adding 3 uniformly distributed in the range @xmath231 and 3 in the range @xmath232 .",
    "such distributions have unbiased kurtosis estimates of the order of @xmath233 , close to the lowest value obtained from our data ( and most strongly departing from the gaussian value of 3 ) .",
    "we find that estimators @xmath220 and @xmath221 are again gaussian - distributed to a very good approximation and very weakly correlated with @xmath234 .",
    "the sampling distributions of @xmath220 and @xmath221 as well as the joint distribution look very similar to the purely gaussian case .",
    "the correlation coefficient can increase significantly only in the presence of additional outliers ( more numerous than predicted by the gaussian distribution ) in the range @xmath235 and @xmath236 .",
    "we have checked that the number of galaxies with velocities in this range is 1 or 2 in each bin , in excellent agreement with the gaussian prediction .",
    "we can therefore assume that , to a good approximation , all our data points measuring velocity dispersion and kurtosis are independent , which justifies the use of standard @xmath26 minimisation to fit the models to the data ."
