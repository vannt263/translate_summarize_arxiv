    "the jets and lobes of radio galaxies are sites of some of the most energetic particles in the universe .",
    "many nearby sources show complex structures at all angular sizes , and most have been observed to emit synchrotron radiation from x - ray to radio wavelengths in their resolved jets .",
    "much of the physics of these jets is unclear , although it is generally believed that they are relativistic , collimated outflows of plasma , launched from an active galactic nucleus by some largely unknown mechanism .",
    "the plasma contains magnetic fields that play significant roles in shaping the jets and producing the radiation we detect .",
    "early radio observations of kpc - scale jets revealed that the emissions were of synchrotron origin and often highly polarized , implying ordered magnetic fields within the jet ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "more recent observations have revealed optical counterparts to some radio jets , often showing a close correspondence in radio and optical morphology .",
    "combined with optical spectra , this suggested that the optical emission was also synchrotron in nature ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the kpc - scale jets of most nearby radio galaxies observed with the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ ( _ cxo _ ) are detected in x - rays , and it has been argued that the dominant emission process is synchrotron radiation @xcite .",
    "since the lifetime of high - energy electrons to synchrotron - radiation losses is short ( tens to hundreds of years for electrons with @xmath1 in a magnetic field of a few nt ) , it is clear that there must be significant localised particle acceleration occurring throughout the jet to maintain the observed emissions .",
    "magnetic - field structures are indicated primarily by the polarization pattern of the synchrotron radiation : polarization vectors show the direction of the apparent magnetic field , while the fraction of polarized emission indicates the ordering of the field .",
    "multi - band imaging and polarimetry therefore tell us about the magnetic fields seen by emitting particles of different energies .",
    "+    3c  15 is a bright , compact and relatively nearby radio galaxy at redshift @xmath0 , and it has an elliptical host galaxy showing weak optical emission lines @xcite . at 8.4",
    "ghz it is dominated by a luminous , one - sided jet , although it also exhibits diffuse emission from extended radio lobes and a weak counter - jet ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and figure  [ fig : radio ] ) .",
    "the bright core is not resolved with the _",
    "vla_. the radio morphology of 3c  15 is unusual : the northern jet is knotty and appears similar to those in fanaroff ",
    "riley ( fr ) class  i sources , while the southern jet is barely detected in the radio .",
    "however , it powers a ` warm spot ' in the southern radio lobe which is typical of a more powerful fr  class  ii galaxy .",
    "the radio power of 3c  15 ( @xmath2 w hz@xmath3 sr@xmath3 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is close to the fr  i / fr  ii boundary at @xmath4 w hz@xmath3 sr@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "an optical jet in 3c  15 , closely following the morphology of the northern radio jet , was detected with the _ hubble space telescope _ , and it has been suggested that synchrotron radiation dominates in both the radio and optical wavebands @xcite .",
    "the radio  optical spectral index of the integrated jet emission @xmath5 was the softest known at that time .",
    "the jet and lobes are detected in x - rays with the sub - arcsecond resolution offered by _",
    "@xcite presented four different models of the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) at the brightest x - ray knot in the jet ; they favour a broad - band synchrotron spectrum with an equipartition magnetic field , and a cooling break at a lorentz factor @xmath6 .",
    "we agree with the general characteristics of this model , although the updated calibration products released by the chandra x - ray center ( cxc ) allow us to extract a more reliable x - ray spectrum of this region of the jet , and hence model the spectrum of the knot with greater confidence .",
    "multi - band optical photometry also allows us to place a good constraint on the optical spectral index @xmath7 in the knot .",
    "in this paper we re - examine the 3c  15 jet , using new _",
    "_ optical polarimetry in conjunction with the reprocessed radio and x - ray data .",

    ". detailed magnetic modelling of the jet is deferred to a later paper .",
    "our primary aim is to use the apparent magnetic - field structure to infer characteristics of the plasma flow and locate sites of particle acceleration . throughout",
    ", we adopt values for the cosmological parameters @xmath8 km s@xmath3 mpc@xmath3 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 . at the redshift of 3c  15",
    ", one arcsecond corresponds to a projected distance of 1.39 kpc .",
    "archival x - band ( 8.4  ghz ) _ vla _ data of 3c  15 were reprocessed using the aips package from nrao .",
    "we used data from a 20 minute observation in the c - configuration on 1989 september 14 , and those from an additional 87 minute a - configuration ( high - resolution ) observation on 1990 may 26 .",
    "the data were read into aips and bad scans were flagged and removed .",
    "antennas 26 and 29 were not present for the observation made using the a - array , while antennas 15 and 23 were removed due to high noise across all baselines . in the c - configuration , antennas 11 , 23 and 29 were absent and antennas 6 , 18 and 22 required further flagging .",
    "the first ten seconds of all scans were also removed to avoid problems with bad visibilities .",
    "flux - density calibration used 3c  286 for the a - configuration data and 3c  48 for the c - configuration data , while both observations made use of 0040 - 017 for phase referencing .     +    after determining the intrinsic antenna polarization using pcal with the calibrator sources , both data sets were phase and amplitude self - calibrated to good convergence using imagr and calib in aips .",
    "the a- and c - array data were then combined using the method described by @xcite , and a further self - calibration was performed on the new database .",
    "the large - scale intensity map was deconvolved using the maximum entropy method ( mem ) embodied in the aips task vtess , since it handles extended structure well .",
    "however , as pointed out by @xcite , mem algorithms do not give good results near bright , compact regions .",
    "for the extended structure , we employ their hybrid technique of an initial shallow clean , followed by 50 iterations of vtess applied only to the residuals .",
    "the convolved clean components were then restored to the vtess image to give the stokes @xmath11 map ( figure  [ fig : radio ] ) .",
    "the radio emission from the jet was also imaged at the highest angular resolution in stokes @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 using a - configuration data only .",
    "a straightforward clean / self - calibration cycle was used without the aid of vtess in this case .",
    "all the radio images were made on an 0.05 arcsec grid , and reconstructed using a synthesised elliptical gaussian beam of 0.40 @xmath14 0.27 arcsec with major axis in position angle 35@xmath15 .",
    "this gives a noise level in stokes @xmath11 of @xmath16  @xmath17jy beam@xmath3 from both the a- and c - arrays .",
    "the percentage - polarization and apparent magnetic field position angle ( mfpa ) images were computed using @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively .",
    "the rician bias in the percentage polarization @xcite was corrected by measuring the noise levels in the stokes @xmath12 and @xmath13 images and using the polc algorithm in the aips task comb .",
    "component fluxes were calculated by fitting two - dimensional gaussians using the task imfit in aips .",
    "optical _ hst _ images of 3c  15 were obtained on 2003 december 9 with the acs / wfc instrument using the wide - band f606w filter and the three optical polarizers , each in a 2872 second exposure .",
    "data were flat - fielded and bias - corrected using standard packages in iraf / stsdas , and crreject was run to remove cosmic - ray events ( see * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * for further details ) .",
    "the acs images were combined using multidrizzle @xcite , allowing for corrections in the chip geometry @xcite .",
    "stokes @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 images were produced and combined following the guidelines in the acs data handbook @xcite , and convolved with a @xmath20 pixel circular gaussian .",
    "the optical percentage - polarization and apparent mfpa images were produced as described in section  [ subsec : radiodata ] .",
    "corrections were needed for the optical mfpa to include the _ hst _ roll - angle ( @xmath21 for program 9847 ) and the offset given by the camera geometry ( @xmath22 for wfc , from * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the rician bias in the percentage polarization @xcite was corrected using a script adapted from the space telescope european coordinating facility ( st - ecf ) package @xcite in iraf , following @xcite .",
    "the script uses a ` most - probable value ' estimator , excluding pixels where the signal - to - noise ratio is @xmath23 , or where the most probable value in the percentage polarization is negative or @xmath24 per cent .",
    "small corrections were made for the parallel and perpendicular transmittance of each filter .    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     it should be noted that the radio and optical observations were taken almost 14 years apart .",
    "this should not change the position of any component by more than a few milliarcseconds , which is significantly smaller than the resolution of our data . however , finding the magnetic field in the jet allows us to estimate the synchrotron radiation loss - time , which is approximately @xmath25 years for an electron in a field @xmath26 tesla emitting radiation at frequency @xmath27 hz ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the equipartition magnetic field indicated in our best - fitting model is @xmath28 nt , which would give an electron radiative lifetime to 1 kev x - rays of @xmath29 years at knot  c ; it is therefore clear that electrons must be reaccelerated in the knot and that the time between optical and x - ray observations is not important for our analysis .",
    "this field would also give a radiative lifetime of @xmath30 years for electrons in knot  c emitting at the break frequency , which is comparable to the light - travel time from the nucleus ( at least @xmath31 years ) .",
    "the total pressure in the plasma from fields and particles is found using @xmath32 , where @xmath33 for a relativistic gas . using the best - fitting equipartition magnetic field of 20  nt",
    ", we deduce the internal pressure of the knot region to be @xmath34 pa .",
    "this may be compared with the upper limit on the thermal pressure @xmath35 pa at the position of knot  c , based on the model for the external gas ( section  [ subsec : external ] ) .",
    "if bulk relativistic motion is neglected , knot  c is overpressured by at least a factor @xmath36 .",
    "the bulk lorentz factor is @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the angle to the line of sight and @xmath39 .",
    "bulk relativistic motion will reduce the magnetic pressure in the knot by a factor @xmath40 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and this may be estimated using the constraint @xmath41 provided by @xcite based on the measured jet to counter - jet flux ratio on the assumption of twin jets that are intrinsically the same . within the allowed ranges , @xmath42 can never be more than @xmath43 , which means the knot will still be overpressured by at least a factor of 10 .",
    "it is possible that the two jets are intrinsically different and that the asymmetry is not simply due to beaming .",
    "indeed , we already noted in section  [ sec : intro ] the evidence that the northern jet is fr  i - like while the southern is fr  ii - like .",
    "however , taking the jet / counter - jet results at face value , our observations suggest the knot is likely to be a temporary feature in a state of expansion .",
    "we note again that there is a small offset ( 0.14  kpc ) between the positions of the intensity maxima at knot  c in the x - ray and radio images .",
    "although this detection is barely significant ( less than @xmath44 ) in the case of 3c  15 , a similar offset has been observed in other nearby jets where the x - ray emission peaks closer to the nucleus ( e.g. @xmath45 arcsec or @xmath46 kpc in 3c  66b , as reported by * ? ? ?",
    "if it is real , it may be the result of radio - emitting plasma being swept downstream , since the long lifetime of radio synchrotron emission would allow us to observe it at some distance from the shock front .",
    "strong acceleration ( to x - ray emitting energies ) may only be permitted at the upstream edge of the shock .",
    "the other peculiar feature at knot  c is the small ( @xmath47 arcsec ) offset between the x - ray and radio / optical flux maxima in the direction transverse to the jet .",
    "unfortunately the resolution of _ chandra _ does not allow us to claim that this offset is significant .",
    "the bright , northern jet in 3c  15 shows similar characteristics to other fr  i class objects in showing a rich variety of different behaviours along its length .",
    "the base of the jet near knot  a@xmath48 is principally seen at high energies , in the x - ray and ultraviolet , before the optical and radio emissions turn on at knots  a and  b. such behaviour is seen also in 3c  31 @xcite and ngc  315 @xcite . with matched beams , the jet is also consistently narrower in the optical than it is in the radio for much of its length , suggesting that it is stratified .",
    "the exception is the a / b region , where the optical and radio jets are of similar width and brightness , although the region is not seen in x - rays . throughout the jet ,",
    "flux maxima appear to be accompanied by ` pinches , ' suggesting a new component of emission is appearing in the centre of the jet and making it seem narrower .",
    "optical and radio polarimetry around  a and  b show polarization minima near flux maxima in both bands , also seen in parts of the m  87 jet @xcite . at knot",
    "a there is a significant change in the magnetic field position angle , where the apparent field changes from being broadly transverse to the jet to being broadly parallel to it .",
    "we have proposed a simple model of the synchrotron - emitting jet in 3c  15 , consisting of an energetic , high - velocity spine and a radio - emitting sheath .",
    "however , the data do not allow us to constrain usefully the velocities of the flow . using a simple magnetic structure",
    "we have checked that large velocity differences between a spine and a sheath would not produce a difference in radio and optical polarization position angles larger than we observe .",
    "the a / b region shows a greater variety of polarization structure than seen in the rest of the jet , suggesting that a particularly complex field configuration and/or velocity structure is present .",
    "detailed magnetic modelling of the jet is deferred to a later paper .",
    "we note that 3c  15 has an unusual radio morphology , where the northern jet is dissipative and appears fr  i - like , while the counter - jet powers a ` warm - spot ' in the southern radio lobe and shows classic fr  ii characteristics . for this reason we question",
    "the assumption that both jets are intrinsically the same , and that the observed flux asymmetry is entirely due to relativistic beaming : future models would then lose the constraint on @xmath49 .",
    "knot  c is bright across the x - ray , optical and radio bands , and exhibits a high degree of optical and radio polarization where the magnetic - field position angle is relatively well - aligned in both components .",
    "we interpret these characteristics as the signatures of a strong shock with a well - ordered magnetic field , and high - energy emission indicates that it is a region of effective particle acceleration .",
    "our synchrotron spectral model with equipartition magnetic field requires a break in the electron spectrum at @xmath50 .",
    "the equipartition magnetic field of @xmath51  nt ( depending on jet speed ) implies knot  c is overpressured by @xmath52 compared with the thermal pressure from external x - ray emitting gas .",
    "this suggests knot  c is a temporary , expanding feature .",
    "knot  c is suitable for more detailed examination , since it is the only part of the jet showing emission in all wavebands .",
    "optical knot  d is detected for the first time in our long _ hst _ acs / f606w+pol exposure , and shows a similarly high degree of polarization as knot  c. knot  d is slightly more polarized in the optical than in the radio , although its optical emission is much weaker .",
    "knot  d is not detected in our _ chandra _ observation .",
    "these results form part of an ongoing investigation into the magnetic environment of the jets of radio galaxies .",
    "3c  15 is one of several sources with optical synchrotron jets ( including 3c  66b , 3c  78 , 3c  264 , 3c  346 and 3c  371 ) where multi - band polarimetry is being assembled .",
    "together with m  87 , 3c  15 is one of the few kpc - scale jets with sufficient optical data that allows us to examine the magnetic structure in detail .",
    "future multi - frequency radio observations and modelling will provide further insight into the structure of the jet , the nature of particle acceleration , and how these relate to magnetic field geometry .",
