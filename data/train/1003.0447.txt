    "the era some 3gyrs after the big bang ( @xmath72.5 ) coincides with a peak in activity in two important populations : qsos , which represent accretion onto supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) ; and a population of extremely luminous , but highly obscured galaxies ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the bulk of the luminosity of these obscured galaxies is emitted in the rest - frame far - infrared waveband . as a result of redshifting",
    ", they are most directly selected through their emission in the submillimeter ( submm ) or mm wavebands , typically in the atmospheric windows around 850 or @xmath8 , and so are termed submm galaxies ( smgs ) .",
    "the infrared luminosities ( @xmath9 ) inferred for smgs from their submm emission are highly uncertain , but assuming , as appears to be the case , that they follow the far - infrared  radio correlation for local starburst ( sb ) galaxies , then their typical luminosities will be @xmath10@xmath11 ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "thus this population may contain some of the most luminous galaxies in the universe comparable in luminosity to qsos .",
    "the increasing availability of precise redshifts for samples of smgs ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ) has allowed their properties to be studied in detail .",
    "smgs are strongly clustered @xcite , massive ( @xmath12m@xmath13 , @xcite ; @xcite ) , and gas rich ( @xmath14 , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) systems which are known to harbor ( apparently ) low - luminosity compton - thin agn ( i.e.  @xmath15@xmath16 , @xcite ; @xcite ) and ( apparently ) strong star - formation ( sf ) activity ( @xmath17m@xmath13yr@xmath18 ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "many of these properties , and the similarity between the redshift distributions of qsos and smgs @xcite , support a link between smgs , qsos and the formation phase of massive elliptical galaxies ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . in the high - redshift interpretation of the evolutionary sequence first presented by @xcite",
    ", smgs would trace an infrared ultraluminous phase followed by a short ` transition phase ' where the galaxy would display a mix of sf and obscured agn activity before evolving into an optically luminous qso . studying the relative sf and agn activity in these ` transition ' or ` missing link ' sources and performing a comparison to typical sf smgs",
    "can thus provide important insight on the validity of this evolutionary sequence . here",
    "we focus on the comparison of the mid - infrared spectral properties between existing samples of typical smgs and a new sample of candidate ` transition phase ' smgs .",
    "the benefit of undertaking this energy audit in the mid - infrared is that the spectra can provide measurements of both sf and agn activity simultaneously ( see @xcite and @xcite ; hereafter and ) , providing a complementary approach to radio ( e.g.  @xcite ) and x - ray studies of smgs ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the _ spitzer _ infrared spectrograph ( irs ; @xcite ) era enabled the study of the energetics of @xmath19 smgs with @xmath20 flux densities as low as @xmath21mjy and with redshifts as high as @xmath22 , demonstrating that accurate redshifts for dust - enshrouded ( and sometimes optically invisible ) galaxies can be obtained ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; ; ) .",
    "the majority of the irs work has confirmed that smgs are primarily sb - dominated systems , with hot dust continuum from an agn contributing at most 30% of the mid - infrared luminosity . only about 15% of blank - field smgs appear to be continuum - dominated in the mid - infrared ( i.e.  @xmath23% contribution ; ) , with infrared array camera ( irac ; @xcite ) 8.0@xmath24 m to 4.5@xmath24 m color ratios of @xmath25 .",
    "mid - infrared continuum - dominated smgs are potentially an important sub - population of smgs representing the ` missing link ' sources in the proposed evolutionary sequence of @xcite , but being the minority of this luminous population , have not yet been studied in a systematic or statistically robust way .",
    "thus , an important question to address is : _ are the energetics of these composite sb / agn objects with submm emission dominated by sbs or by agn , even when the irac colors indicate that an agn is likely present ? _",
    "other relevant irs samples include near - infrared - selected sbs , x - ray - selected agn @xcite , and _",
    "spitzer_-selected @xmath26 ulirgs ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "agn - dominated sources in these samples tend to reside in a distinct parameter space in _ spitzer _ color - color diagrams , which is consistent with color - redshift evolution tracks of well - known local agn ( see e.g.  fig .  [",
    "fig : selection ] ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the reason why @xmath25 should locate mid - infrared agn - dominated sources is simple : seeing an enhanced 8@xmath24 m flux density compared with 4.5@xmath24 m is expected if a source has significant thermal power - law emission from an agn accretion disk , which can dilute both the pahs and the h - opacity minimum ( 1.6@xmath24 m stellar bump , which these channels trace ) .",
    "although some contamination is expected : sf - dominated sources can also show enhanced @xmath27 at @xmath28 ( when these channels begin to sample over the peak of stellar photospheric emission ) aswell as at @xmath29 ( since these channels are not yet climbing up the restframe 1.6@xmath24 m stellar bump ) .",
    "the color cut is thus appropriate for separating mid - infrared sb- and agn - dominated smgs from @xmath304 , which is well matched to the known redshift distribution of the smg population .",
    "we have thus selected eight smgs from the submillimeter common - user bolometer array ( scuba ; @xcite ) half degree extragalactic survey ( shades ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) within this relatively unexplored @xmath25 parameter space that are likely harboring agn .",
    "these were targeted with the irs in order to determine the relative contribution of power - law / agn emission versus pah / sf emission to their power output , enabling a comparison to similar irs samples of more typical sf - dominated smgs .",
    "we use these data to obtain independent redshift estimates as well as to test if the irac - color criterion is a secure means of pre - selecting smg counterparts with an enhanced agn component compared to typical smgs  the ` missing link ' sources in the proposed evolutionary sequence we wish to investigate .",

    "we select smgs with statistically robust 24@xmath24 m counterparts with @xmath47mjy ( ensuring that we achieve adequate signal - to - noise , s / n , on the continuum in the irs spectra ) and observed irac colors of @xmath25 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; see fig .",

    "our final sample is comprised of eight sources : four smgs from each of the shades scuba and aztec surveys .",

    "note that including the ` non - robust ' @xmath20 ids in these estimates gives similar fractions .",
    "in addition , deeper radio and 24@xmath24 m data would likely yield identifications for all of the smgs ; and there is no evidence in support of smgs fainter than 200@xmath48jy at 24@xmath48 m being fundamentally different than perhaps lying at slightly higher redshifts ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",

    "sec : analysis3 ] we extrapolate our results to determine the full mid  to  far - infrared seds in order to estimate the agn contribution to the bolometric luminosity of these systems .",
    "in order to derive the source redshifts , we simultaneously fit a power law continuum component and lorentzian profiles to the spectra using a levenberg - marquardt least - squares method , including the residual sky errors in the fit determination ( e.g.  @xcite ) , assuming the following rest - frame wavelengths for the main pah features that are visible : 6.22 , 7.71 , and 8.61@xmath48 m @xcite .",
    "we do not impose any joint constraints on the line ratios or centres ( i.e.  to all lie at the same redshift ) , as we aim to obtain individual redshift estimates from each pah feature .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig : spec ] for an example of these fitting results .",
    "our fitting routine returns the formal 1@xmath55 statistical error estimates for each set of best - fitting parameters derived from the square root of the diagonal elements of the covariance matrix , and we adopt these errors in the ensuing analysis . we verify that these formal errors are reasonable through monte carlo simulations similar to those described in .",
    "the final redshift for each smg is calculated by taking a weighted average of the individual redshift estimates from the visible pah lines ( although we neglect the 8.61@xmath24 m pah feature in the redshift estimate because it appears relatively weak and significantly blended with the much stronger neighboring 7.71@xmath24 m feature ) .",
    "the total error on the redshift is calculated from 1@xmath66 with an additional ` centroiding error ' ( calculated as the maximum spread in the line centering from the monte carlo simulations ) added in quadrature . for sources with only one pah line ,",
    "the 1@xmath55 redshift error is taken to be the centroiding error derived from the simulations ( the more conservative choice ) .",
    "note that the redshift errors range from 0.010.05 , consistent with the similar - quality spectra in and .",
    "for comparison , we use the @xcite sb template with fixed pah linewidths and positions and find that this gives redshift estimates consistent with our method ( which is essentially equivalent to performing a combined fit of all the lines simultaneously , but with a more accurate measure of the uncertainty of the redshift ) .",
    "once redshifts have been obtained ( see table  [ tab : agn ] ) , we calculate the rest - frame pah line equivalent widths ( ews ) and luminosities from our lorentzian model fits , propagating through the redshift and parameter errors from the fits ( see table  [ tab : lines ] ) .",
    "we determine the relative agn and sf contributions by fitting each spectrum with a model comprised of three main components ( extinction , pahs and a continuum power - law ) of the form @xmath67 using a @xmath68 minimization approach ( see ) .",
    "the agn emission is characterized by a power - law with both the normalization and slope as free parameters , and @xmath69 is obtained from the @xcite extinction curves .",
    "we assume that all of the pah line emission is powered by a sb ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ) , and the sb / pah emission is fitted using the mid - infrared spectrum of m82 from @xcite , which is known to fit and describe the mid - infrared spectra of the sb - dominated smg population well ( e.g.  ) .",
    "we derive the fraction of the mid - infrared luminosity that comes from the continuum component by integrating the continuum portion of the best - fitting model and dividing by the area under the total fit .",
    "the use of different templates was explored by @xcite and ( e.g.  using ngc7714 in place of m82 ) , and these authors find that it makes little difference on the final outcome of the decomposition , especially given the small wavelength range covered by the spectra .",
    "in addition , we perform the decomposition using the @xcite sb template in place of m82 and find that they yield comparable fractions .      one of the main goals is to determine if our sample of smg mid  to  far - infrared seds resemble that of typical smgs or if an additional agn component is required to fit the data . with this goal in mind , using the same simple templates and approach as will enable a direct and fair comparison between the two samples .",
    "we have thus used the full mid - infrared  to  radio composite sed from , comprised of their mid - infrared smg sb composite spectrum spliced with the best - fitting modified @xcite template ( ce01 hereafter ) , to represent the sf component , and we have used the sed of mrk231 , consisting of its irs spectrum @xcite spliced together with the ce01 template that best fits the far - infrared / submm photometry of mrk231 , to represent the agn component . although the resulting decomposition will thus depend heavily on the templates we have assumed , these choices will allow us to determine the _ relative _ differences between the spectral decomposition of our sample of agn - dominated smgs and of more typical sb - dominated smgs from .",
    "nevertheless , we discuss and explore other choices for the sb and agn templates ",
    "[ sec : fits ] to verify the dependence of our results on the assumed templates .",
    "we fit linear combinations of these templates to the data , including the mid - infrared irs spectra , the 850 or 1100@xmath24 m photometry , and , where available , 350@xmath24 m photometry from @xcite using a levenberg - marquardt least - squares approach .",
    "we also verify that available 70 and 450@xmath24 m 3@xmath55 upper limits from @xcite and @xcite , respectively , are not violated in the final fits .",
    "we then integrate the total best - fitting linear combination of the sb and agn sed components in the rest - frame from 81000@xmath48 m to obtain the total infrared luminosities , @xmath9 , and calculate the relative fractions and luminosities of the sb ( @xmath70 ) and agn ( @xmath71 ) components to the total infrared luminosity ( see table  [ tab : lines ] ) .",
    "note that the full sf - smg composite sed from already contains a 30% agn contribution in the mid - infrared ( from 511.5@xmath24 m in the rest - frame ) , which is taken into account in our calculations of @xmath71 and @xmath70 .",
    "after the level of agn contamination in each smg has been determined in this way , we calculate the sfrs for our objects from @xmath70 following @xcite , assuming a starburst less than 100myr in age with a @xcite initial mass function .",

    "the agn - dominated smg sample we have focussed on here is similar to typical smgs in terms of @xmath70 , which allows for a fair and direct comparison between the two sub - samples of smgs .",

    "the bias in our redshift distribution to earlier epochs is likely a submm selection effect , which tends to pick out warmer galaxies on average at higher redshift ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the subsequent irac color - selection imposed could be effectively singling out those higher - redshift smgs which possess warm dusty tori heated by a proportionately larger agn .",

    "the smg phase is in principle both an sb and an agn , but it is only during the final evolutionary stage that the remnant would be visible as an agn , with outflows removing the surrounding gas and dust which heavily obscures the agn at the beginning of the burst .",
    "tentative evidence for this has been found in typical smgs since their estimated @xmath151 ratio is lower than found in @xmath100 qsos ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite )    recently , @xcite proposed that dust obscured galaxies ( dogs ; @xmath152 and @xmath153mjy , with surface densities similar to @xmath154mjy smgs ) could represent a brief evolutionary phase between smgs and less obscured qsos or galaxies , which is supported by the finding that @xmath155% of smgs ( including the agn - dominated smgs ) meet the dog criteria @xcite .",
