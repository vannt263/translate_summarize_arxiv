    "unraveling the properties of a new stable cold dark matter ( cdm ) particle is a challenge for ongoing or future astroparticle and collider experiments . the most convincing evidence for cdm so far is provided by wmap  @xcite and sdss  @xcite .",
    "their precise determination of the relic density of cdm strongly constrains the parameter space of the various new particle physics models(np )  @xcite .",
    "this single observable , @xmath3 , is however not sufficient to pin down the properties of cdm even when assuming that the candidate is a weakly interacting massive particle , @xmath4 .",
    "additional information on the nature of dark matter could also be obtained from measurements of detection rate in different detectors , observations of a signal in photons , antiprotons , positrons or neutrinos produced after annihilation of dark matter and discovery and measurements of properties of new particles at colliders .",
    "several models for new physics containing a cdm candidate have been proposed in the past  @xcite .",
    "the most popular examples of new stable weakly interacting particles at the electroweak scale include the neutralino in supersymmetric models  @xcite , right - handed neutrinos  @xcite , scalars or vector bosons in extra dimension models  @xcite , vector bosons in little higgs models  @xcite and scalars in extensions of the sm  @xcite .",
    "right - handed sneutrinos as a cdm candidate have also been revived lately  @xcite .",
    "predictions for signals in direct  @xcite , indirect  @xcite or collider experiments have been made within each of these models  @xcite .",
    "furthermore in specific case studies , in particular within supersymmetric models , the prospects of determining the properties of the new particles and from there infer a `` collider '' prediction for the relic density or for the detection rates were analyzed  @xcite .",
    "while colliders and in particular the lhc have a good potential for discovering and identifying new particles present in various extensions of the standard model , direct detection experiments ( dd ) will be the ones to provide evidence for a stable relic particle  @xcite .",
    "furthermore in some cases , direct detection experiments have better discovery prospects than the lhc .",
    "the best known example is the so - called focus point region in constrained supersymmetric models  @xcite .",
    "we therefore concentrate here on direct detection aspects and consider only models which offer the best detection prospects , those with a weakly interacting particle at the electroweak scale .",
    "a number of experiments are currently searching for cdm by measuring the elastic scattering rate on nuclei in large detectors .",
    "their sensitivity is being improved and upper limits are updated regularly .",
    "the best upper limit on the proton-@xmath4 spin - independent ( si ) cross section has been recently obtained by xenon , @xmath5pb for a cdm of @xmath6gev  @xcite and cdms , @xmath7pb for a cdm of @xmath8gev  @xcite .",
    "these limits are already putting constraints on the parameter space of new physics models .",
    "limits on spin - dependent ( sd ) cross - sections are much less restrictive .",
    "the best limits are now obtained by kims for protons , @xmath9pb  @xcite and by xenon for neutrons , @xmath10pb  @xcite .",
    "indirect detection of neutrinos coming from cdm annihilation in the sun sets a limit on @xmath11 , the best limit is from super - kamiokande , @xmath12pb  @xcite .",
    "these do not yet allow to test the most popular np models .",
    "one difficulty in extracting precise information from an elastic scattering rate on nuclei is that the rate depends not only on the details of the particle physics model but also large theoretical uncertainties are introduced by the cdm velocity distribution , the nuclear form factors and the coefficients that describe the quark content in the nucleon .",
    "the former can be eliminated by taking ratios of rates in different materials while a large part of the uncertainty from the quark content in the nucleon will drop out when taking ratios of proton to neutron amplitudes . fortunately many of the detectors set up or planned use different materials",
    "thus can be sensitive to different combinations of proton and neutron amplitudes .",
    "the procedure for extracting in a model independent way the amplitudes for spin dependent interactions on protons and neutrons was discussed in  @xcite .",
    "the spin independent interactions on the other hand are basically sensitive to one combination of neutron and proton amplitudes , this is because all heavy materials have roughly the same ratio of protons to neutrons  @xcite .",
    "our goal is to see what would be the prospects for determining the properties of cdm particles after a signal has been observed .",
    "we will use directly the event rates or assume that the spin ( in)dependent proton and neutron amplitudes have been extracted .",
    "we assume that future spin independent and spin dependent detectors will have sufficient sensitivity to measure a signal .",
    "we will consider the maximal achievable sensitivity to be @xmath13  pb , for example with eureca  @xcite and @xmath14  pb , as in the coupp proposal  @xcite .",
    "although this last value requires a significant improvement in sd detectors , we emphasize the importance of the sd interactions in determining the properties of the cdm candidate .",
    "comparative studies of the prospects for direct detection in new physics models have been performed in  @xcite . recently",
    "a comparison of the si detection rates and rates for indirect detection of neutrinos in the case of the mued , little higgs and mssm models was presented  @xcite .",
    "the potential of a combined measurements of si and sd rates to distinguish mued from mssm with coupp using two different materials was also examined  @xcite .",
    "we expand on these analysis in many ways .",
    "first we examine a larger class of mssm models , second we rely heavily on detectors sensitive to sd interactions and third we insist on the importance of using different materials to extract both the neutron and proton amplitudes . we also take into account uncertainties from the quark coefficients in nucleons and use an improved calculation of the direct detection rate  @xcite .",
    "this is a first step towards a more general analysis where one would combine information from both direct and indirect detection as well as from collider searches , see also  @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : after setting up our notation in section 2 , we summarize in section 3 the predictions for the si and sd cross sections on nucleons as well as for the ratios of sd and si amplitudes on protons and neutrons in different cdm models .",
    "we consider majorana fermions ( in particular the neutralino in susy ) , a right handed dirac neutrino , as well as vector and scalar particles .",
    "the results of our scans over the parameter space for each sample models are presented in section 4 where we show which models can in principle be distinguished by measurements of both si and sd amplitudes on protons and neutrons .",
    "the predictions for the scattering rates on various nuclei are then compared in section 5 .",
    "finally in section 6 we briefly mention the case where a signal can be observed only in the si interaction .",
    "our results are summarized in section 7 .",

    "@xmath39 is the local neutralino density , @xmath40 the detector mass and i(e ) the integral over the velocity distribution @xmath41 where @xmath42 . to compute the cross sections on nucleons and the event rates we rely on 2.2  @xcite .",
    "all information on the cdm model is contained in the amplitudes @xmath43 as well as in the mass of the cdm .",
    "once a signal has been observed , one could use data from different detector materials to extract information on these amplitudes  @xcite .",
    "this evidently necessitates making some assumption about both the halo velocity distribution , the dark matter distribution as well as on the nucleon and nuclear form factors .",
    "the dependence on the velocity and on the dark matter distribution however drops out when taking ratios of the nucleon amplitudes .",
    "furthermore , some of the uncertainty from the quark coefficients in the nucleon also drop out .",
    "this is because the sea quarks coefficients which give the dominant contribution are identical for protons and neutrons .",
    "we choose as independent parameters the ratios @xmath44 and @xmath45which characterizes the overall si rate , @xmath46 note that the factor of @xmath47 in @xmath45 depends on the ratio of protons to neutrons in the nucleus .",
    "typically this ratio does not vary much  @xcite , our choice gives the maximal sensitivity in heavy nuclei .",
    "nuclei that are sensitive to sd interactions do so primarily through an unpaired nucleon , this means they have either @xmath48 or @xmath49 and have little sensitivity to the interference term @xmath50 in eq .",
    "[ eq : sdpoint ]  @xcite .",
    "the sign of @xmath51 is therefore hard to determine .",
    "the mass of the cdm candidate can be determined from the nuclei recoil energies .",
    "this works best when @xmath52  gev  @xcite although a new method to improve the mass determination for a heavy dm particle using signals from two different detectors was proposed recently  @xcite .",
    "we consider a selection of models representative of different cdm candidates in the 30gev-1tev range : majorana fermion ( the neutralino in the mssm ) , dirac fermion ( a right - handed neutrino ) , gauge boson ( the heavy photon in little higgs models or the @xmath53 in mued models ) or scalar particles in extended higgs models .",
    "the predictions for the rates for direct detection have been studied in all these models and rates can vary by orders of magnitude within each model  @xcite . for each cdm candidate the dominant process for elastic scattering influences the overall scattering cross - section as well as the relations among the proton / neutron amplitudes .",
    "we will explore these relations within models representative of each type of cdm .",
    "a summary of the different mechanisms for cdm elastic scattering in various models is provided in table  [ tab : direct ] .",
    "note that two special subclasses of the mssm have been introduced .",
    "the main difference between these two classes is the range of mass of squarks , in mssmh they are heavy and therefore do not contribute to dd .",

    "gets two types of contributions , higgs and squark exchange for si interactions and z and squark exchange for sd interactions . in general the higgs and z exchanges dominate since the squark contributions suffer from a mass suppression ( the squarks are generally at the tev scale ) .",
    "we will consider two categories of mssm models .",
    "in the first , mssmh , sfermions are heavy ( 2tev ) and do not contribute to dd . in this model cdm annihilation",

    "we will assume the sleptons to be heavy since sleptons do not contribute to direct detection .",
    "however one should keep in mind that sleptons can contribute to the cdm relic density , both through annihilation or coannihilation , so our analysis is not completely general when confined to models that are in agreement with the measured value for the cdm relic density .",

    "the couplings of the light higgs to @xmath57 reads @xmath69 where @xmath70 describe the field content of the lsp  @xcite .",
    "clearly for the higgs exchange to contribute requires a lsp with some higgsino component ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "in all models where higgs exchange dominates we expect @xmath72 within a 2% accuracy . this is because the the quark coefficients in protons and neutrons are the same for heavy quarks and the largest coefficient is the one for s - quark .",
    "for the spin dependent amplitude , the z exchange contribution reads , @xmath73 when the squark contribution is negligible the ratio of proton to neutron amplitudes @xmath74 is therefore totally independent of the neutralino coupling to the z. we expect @xmath75 when considering the range for the quark coefficients specified in eq .",
    "[ eq : axial_vector ] .",
    "this value for @xmath76 is expected in any model where z exchange dominates the spin dependent interaction .",
    "these simple relations are spoiled in models where squarks are light unless squarks of different flavours are nearly degenerate in which case we still expect @xmath77 .",
    "strong corrections to this ratio can be found when @xmath78 since in this case twist-2 operators give a large contribution that can even cancel the leading squark contribution  @xcite .",
    "note that a twist-2 contribution , being proportional to the quark hypercharge , is larger for u - squarks so will contribute mainly to the proton amplitude . in principle the impact of light squarks is more important for spin dependent interactions because of a possible cancellation between u and d - type quark coefficients .",
    "however the squark exchange is dominant for sd cross sections that are usually too small to be measured even in ton - scale detectors .",
    "the ratio of sd to si amplitudes also characterizes the model . when sfermions are heavy , the relic density of dark matter favours a lsp with some wino or higgsino component . in such models",

    "this model can be used as a prototype of a more general class of models with a right - handed dirac neutrino as cdm  @xcite . whether or not there are additional quarks or gauge bosons , because of the large mass scale involved , the most important contribution to elastic scattering of the right - handed neutrino on nucleons is due to z and higgs exchange  @xcite . what is peculiar in this class of models is that the cdm is not a majorana particle , so there is an important contribution of z exchange to both si and sd nucleon scattering  @xcite . typically in this model",
    "the elastic scattering cross sections are large and direct detection poses one of the strongest phenomenological constraint on the model  @xcite .    for the dominant z exchange contribution to the spin independent interactions @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the parameter that describes the coupling of @xmath54 to the z. this coupling is induced through mixing so is suppressed with respect to the sm couplings .",

    "we conclude that in principle with the observation of signals in detectors with different materials , including detectors highly sensitive to sd interactions , discrimination of mued from mssmh and lhm is possible except in a small numbers of scenarios . on the other hand the model mssmq with light squarks",

    "we do not attempt to estimate the precision to which the ratio of rates can be measured , it is strongly dependent on the specific detector in operation .",

    "we have imposed the wmap lower and upper limit for the relic density .",
    "allowing other dark matter candidates would lead to many more models passing the constraints and cross sections over the whole range for any cdm mass . to summarize , with only a signal in the si channel",
    "one could distinguish rhnm from lhm , while idm and mssmh are often indistinguishable from each other and from the previous two models .",
    "a dm mass between @xmath220  gev is however only compatible with the mssm .",
    "furthermore a heavier dm particle is only compatible with mssm and idm models while no signal is expected in the mued model .",
    "these statements depend crucially on the upper bound that can be set on @xmath115 .",
    "for example , if no signal is observed at the level of @xmath221  pb we would predict that the si cross section in mued could reach @xmath222  pb , an order of magnitude more than what we have used in this section .",
    "we have summarized the predictions for @xmath127 and @xmath11 in a variety of new physics models . we have emphasized the importance of measuring @xmath223 to discriminate dark matter models although first signals are generally expected in the si mode .",
    "this is because nuclei sensitive to si interactions provide a measurement of basically one specific combination of couplings . on the other hand both amplitudes @xmath186 and @xmath202 can be measured with sd sensitive nuclei .",
    "furthermore most particle physics models predict @xmath224 , at least those where the higgs is responsible for si interactions , while @xmath74 vary over a very wide range , from @xmath225 in models dominated by z exchange to either very small or very large values when coloured particles play an important role .",
    "to control astrophysical uncertainties as well as other theoretical uncertainties , we advocate to compare ratios of rates measured with different materials .",
    "these ratios can be powerful model discriminators especially when involving one light nuclei .",
    "in particular we have shown that in principle one could disentangle the mssmh and mued models .",
    "recall that mssmh is an example of a model with a majorana neutrino where si / sd interactions are dominated by h / z exchange while mued is a model where the same diagrams ( quark exchange ) contribute to both type of processes . with direct detection alone",
    "it is much more difficult to distinguish mued models from the lhm scenarios where the new quarks are almost degenerate with the cdm as well as with mssm models with light squarks .",
    "this is because in this case the si / sd amplitudes are also both dominated by the exchange of a coloured particle .",
    "fortunately if these coloured particles are below the 2  tev scale , the lhc should be able to detect these new particles .",
    "we have in this analysis concentrated on scenarios with detection rates accessible by future cdm detectors .",
    "there is however no guarantee that a positive signal will be measured for the full parameter space of the models we have considered .",
    "this is especially an issue for light nuclei .",
    "we have also shown explicitly that if the sd elastic scattering cross section is below the sensitivity of future detectors , it is much more difficult to identify the particle physics model with data from si direct detection alone , the mssm , lhm and idm models all predict @xmath127 in a wide range while a signal should be expected soon in the rhnm . in this case",
