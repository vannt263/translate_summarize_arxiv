    "among special functions , the hypergeometric function has perhaps the widest range of applications . for instance , several well - known classes of mathematical physics are particular or limiting cases of it . for real numbers @xmath4 and @xmath5 with @xmath6 , the gaussian hypergeometric function is defined by [ eq1.1 ] f(a , b;c;x ) : = _ 2 f_1(a , b;c;x)= _ n=0^ for @xmath7 , where @xmath8 for @xmath9 , and @xmath10 for @xmath11 . for many rational triples",
    "@xmath12 the function can be expressed in terms of elementary functions and long lists of such particular cases are given in @xcite .",
    "it is clear that small changes of the parameters @xmath13 will have small influence on the value of @xmath14 . in this paper",
    "we shall study to what extent some well - known properties of the complete elliptic integral of the first kind [ eq1.2 ] ( x ) f ( , ; 1;x^2 ) = _ 0^/2(1-x^2 ^ 2t)^-1/2dt , x ( 0,1 ) , can be extended to @xmath15 for @xmath16 close to @xmath17 . recall that @xmath18 is called _ zero - balanced _ if @xmath19 .",
    "in the zero - balanced case , there is a logarithmic singularity at @xmath20 and gauss proved the asymptotic formula [ eq1.3 ] f(a , b;a+b;r)~- ( 1-r ) as @xmath21 tends to @xmath22 , where [ eq1.4 ] b(z , w ) ,  re z>0 , re w>0 is the classical beta function .",
    "note that @xmath23 and @xmath24 see ( ( * ? ? ?",

    "ramanujan s formula ( [ eq1.5 ] ) is a particular case of another well - known formula given in ( @xcite ) .",
    "we shall use in the sequel the following assertion which is a mixture of biernacki - krzyz and related results on the ratio of formal power series ( @xcite,@xcite ) .",

    "if the sequence @xmath35 is monotone increasing ( decreasing ) for @xmath36 and monotone decreasing ( increasing ) for @xmath37 , then there exists @xmath38 such that @xmath33 is increasing ( decreasing ) on @xmath39 and decreasing ( increasing ) on @xmath40 .",
    "some of the most important properties of the elliptic integral @xmath41 are the landen identities @xcite : [ eq1.7 ] ( ) = ( 1+r)(r),()=(r ) , where @xmath42 in @xcite , the following problem was raised :    [ prob1.8 ] find an analog of landen s transformation formulas in ( [ eq1.7 ] ) for @xmath43 .",
    "in particular , if @xmath44 and @xmath45 , is it true that @xmath46 for some constant @xmath47 and all @xmath48 ?",
    "since @xmath49 for @xmath50 , @xmath47 must be greater than 1 .    in @xcite and ( * ? ? ? * theorem 1.4 ) gauss asymptotic formula @xmath51 was refined by finding the lower and upper bounds for @xmath52 when @xmath45 or @xmath53 .",

    "[ s1thm ] for all @xmath60 with @xmath61 we have that the inequality @xmath62 holds for each @xmath58 . also , for @xmath63 , the reversed inequality @xmath64 takes place for each @xmath50 .    in the remaining region",
