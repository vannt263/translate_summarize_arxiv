    "the random case in unaltered .    to further prove that weak interactions stabilize the mixture and destabilize the predator - prey cases , we analyzed the effect of taking the magnitude of the coefficients from a gamma distribution .",

    "the situation is unaltered .       or @xmath87 yields different effects ( separation between the two lines ) .",

    "<S> local stability measures the tendency of the system to return to equilibrium after small perturbations . </S>",

    "<S> thus , it should be extremely improbable to observe rich ( large @xmath2 ) or highly connected ( large @xmath7 ) ecosystems persisting through time . </S>",
    "<S> mathematically , an equilibrium point is stable if all the eigenvalues of the corresponding community matrix have negative real part .    </S>",
    "<S> the networks described by these matrices have random structure : each pair of species interacts with a given probability . however , this randomness translates , for large @xmath2 , into fixed interaction frequencies , so that when we are constructing the matrices above , we are following a precise mixture of interaction types . </S>",
    "<S> we can classify interactions types according to the signs of the ordered pair @xmath10 ( effect of @xmath3 on @xmath4 and vice versa ) , and compute their expected frequencies in a large random matrix . for the pair @xmath11 : non - interacting , </S>",

    "<S> the only difference between the matrices is that in the predator - prey case , coefficients are arranged in pairs , such that one is negative and the other is positive . </S>",
    "<S> however , this arrangement modifies the expected interaction strength product for two interacting species @xmath32 ( i.e. , the expectation is taken over all the pairs in which @xmath33 or @xmath34 are @xmath35 ) , which is @xmath8 in the random case , but @xmath36 in the predator - prey case . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the difference in stability arises from having negative @xmath32 . </S>",

    "<S> rescale the matrix @xmath45 : @xmath54 . </S>",

    "<S> these considerations are confirmed by numerical experiments ( figure 3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that , surprisingly , imposing realistic food web structure hampers stability .    in the same spirit , we measured the effect realistic structures produce in mutualistic networks . </S>",
    "<S> several published mutualistic networks are bipartite @xcite : there are two types of nodes ( e.g. , plants and pollinators ) , and interactions occur exclusively between different types . also , bipartite mutualistic networks tend to be nested @xcite : the interactions of the specialists are subset of those of the generalists . </S>",

    "<S> the bipartite case yields row sums that are substantially similar to the unstructured case . </S>",
    "<S> accordingly , we do not expect a large discrepancy in stability . </S>",
    "<S> however , given that nested structures will yield ( on average ) , larger maximum row / column sum ( associated with the generalist plants and animals ) , nested structures are inherently less stable than unstructured ones . </S>",
    "<S> these results are confirmed by numerical simulations ( figure 5 ) .    </S>",

    "<S> we have extracted coefficients from normal ( or half - normal ) distributions , where the majority of interactions are close to 0 and thus `` weak '' . </S>",
    "<S> these `` weak interactions '' are thought to contribute considerably to the stability and persistence of natural systems @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> to examine their effect , we extended our analysis to the cases in which the absolute value of each coefficient is taken either from a uniform or a gamma distribution , parametrized such that @xmath41 and @xmath55 ( as in the normal case ) ( appendix ) . </S>",
    "<S> note that the different distributions represent different frequencies of weak interactions . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , changing the distribution impacts @xmath32 , which , compared to the random case , has to be negative to increase stability and positive to depress stability . </S>",
    "<S> when weak interactions are preponderant , @xmath32 is expected to be smaller in magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , weak interactions should increase the stability for mutualistic and competitive systems , but decrease the stability of predator - prey matrices and have no effect in the random case . </S>",
    "<S> this argument is matched by analytical and numerical results ( appendix ) , showing that , contrary to the current belief , weak interactions can be destabilizing .    to summarize the stability properties of the various matrices , we performed numerical simulations for all the types of networks and with three parametrizations ( table 1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we searched for the largest @xmath2 yielding a probability of stability @xmath80 ( measured using 1000 matrices ) . in all cases , @xmath2 increases when moving from nested mutualism to predator - prey .    </S>",
    "<S> we have shown that arrangement into signed pairs of interactions has large impact on stability . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the random , mixture and predator - prey matrices contain basically the same coefficients , and the large difference in stability is driven exclusively by their arrangement ( pairs with random signs , pairs with same sign and pairs with opposite signs , respectively ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with the fact that the variance of the eigenvalues is driven by the mean product between nonzero pairs @xmath32 .    </S>",
    "<S> mutualism , competition , and their mixture , although yielding the same pairwise mean product , and the same mean and variance of the eigenvalues , have very different stability properties : increasing the fraction of competitive interactions increases stability . in these cases </S>",
    "<S> the stability is driven by higher moments of the eigenvalue distribution . </S>",
    "<S> we conjecture that the stability properties in these matrices are thus influenced by products of three or more coefficients at a time . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the product of three competitive interactions would yield a different sign from that of three mutualistic interactions , potentially accounting for the difference in stability .    </S>",
    "<S> surprisingly , imposing realistic structure to the interaction networks appears to be detrimental for stability both in the predator - prey and the mutualistic cases . </S>",
    "<S> this does necessarily mean that more realistic networks should be less stable , as in our comparisons all the coefficients have ( in absolute value ) the same expectation , while this is not the case in natural systems ( e.g. , generalist species will have typically lower values for each interaction compared to specialists ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , we can safely assert that realistic structure alone is not contributing to stability : an increase in stability can be observed only if there is an interplay between the network structure and the interaction strengths . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that interaction strengths are a major determinant of stability is confirmed by our analysis showing that weak interactions can be either stabilizing or destabilizing depending on the type of interaction between species .    </S>",
    "<S> we have shown that simply plotting the density of the eigenvalues provides qualitative insight into the stability of the systems . using this graphical method , the effect of any type of network structure can be readily analyzed .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we have found a consistent `` stability hierarchy '' spanning mutualism to predator - prey . </S>",
    "<S> predator - prey interactions enable the stable coexistence of networks as large and complex as those observed empirically .    </S>",
    "<S> our results are not limited to the stability of ecological ( or biological ) systems . </S>",
    "<S> the criteria , in fact , hold for any system of differential equations resting at an equilibrium point .    </S>",
