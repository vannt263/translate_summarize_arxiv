    "a persistent problem in understanding the absorbing material in ngc  4151 has been reconciling the vastly different gas columns inferred for the x - ray absorption and for the uv absorption .",
    "the x - ray absorbing column varies between @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "bromage et al .",
    "( 1985 ) estimated a total column for the uv - absorbing material of no more than @xmath3 .",
    "the neutral hydrogen column is variable ( kriss et al .",
    "the bulk of the absorption is in low column density gas with @xmath4 and doppler parameter @xmath5 .",
    "any low - b component has a neutral column no greater than @xmath6 .",
    "one possibility for reconciling these differences has been the recent success of warm absorber models for characterizing the x - ray absorption and the associated uv absorption lines in 3c  351 and ngc  5548 ( mathur et al . 1994 ; mathur et al . 1995 ) . in such models",
    "the absorption arises in gas photoionized by the central engine ( e.g. , netzer 1993 ; krolik & kriss 1995 ) . the x - ray absorption is dominated by highly ionized species of heavy ions ( e.g. , o  vii and o  viii ) .",
    "the total gas columns can be quite high ( @xmath1@xmath2 ) , with relatively low columns in the lower ionization species responsible for the uv absorption .",
    "warm absorber models with a reflection component can fit the x - ray spectrum of ngc  4151 ( weaver et al .",

    "kriss et al .",
    "( 1995 ) find that similar models can also account for the high ionization lines in ngc  4151 ( e.g. , o  vi , n  v , and c  iv ) , but they can not simultaneously match the particularly strong absorption in lower ionization species such as h  i , c  iii , and si  iv .",
    "they conclude that a single - zone warm absorber is insufficient . to search for absorption components that might possibly be identified with the x - ray absorbing gas",
    ", i examined archival high resolution ghrs spectra of the c  iv and mg  ii line profiles in ngc  4151 .",
    "fig.1 shows the spectrum of ngc  4151 in the c  iv region with 14 @xmath7 resolution obtained in 8486 s using grating g160 m of the ghrs on 28 october 1994 . a model consisting of an underlying power law continuum , three broad gaussian emission lines , and 8 c  iv absorption line doublets fits the data well and gives @xmath8 for 1800 points and 50 free parameters .",
    "although the deepest and broadest c  iv doublet is saturated , the bottom of the line profile is not black .",
    "either this gas only partially covers the source ( at the 90% level , both continuum and broad line ) , or 10% of the continuum flux is scattered around the absorbing region back into our line of sight .",
    "narrow - line emission is visible on the red side of the c  iv absorption trough .",
    "this emission is apparently unabsorbed by the broad absorbing gas ; a final layer of absorbing gas , however , lying at the systemic velocity of ngc  4151 , absorbs the core of the narrow - line profile .",
    "this is presumably the ism or halo of ngc  4151 .",
    "the spectrum of the mg  ii region at 10 @xmath7 resolution obtained in a 1414 s integration with grating g270 m of the ghrs on 29 october 1994 is shown in fig.2 .",
    "the best fit to the modeled emission and absorption profile gives @xmath9 for 1438 points and 22 free parameters .",
    "as with c  iv , the mg  ii emission was modeled with 3 gaussians .",
    "seven mg  ii absorption doublets are required .",
    "table 1 gives the velocities , equivalent widths , doppler parameters , and column densities of each of the absorption components fit in the c  iv and the mg  ii spectra .",
