    "the gluon fugacity extracted from bamps is shown in fig .",

    "fair comparisons , modifications in the hydrodynamic equations will be done in the near future @xcite to take into account the chemical equilibration .    as pointed out already in the previous section ,",

    "in contrast , for @xmath217 the distribution function is reasonably good approximated by second - order kinetic theory over the shown momentum range .",
    "thus we argue that the dependence of @xmath131 on @xmath218 is stronger than given by _ ansatz _ ( [ phixp_redu ] ) , since @xmath219 quantifies the strength of dissipative effects , which are stronger at @xmath172 .",

    "this happens at @xmath223 gev .",
    "for transverse momenta larger than these critical values the expansion @xmath224 done to obtain eq.([ds2 ] ) is invalidated .",
    "thus in the calculation of the entropy density ( and entropy production ) the @xmath225 term should be approximated by @xmath226 , i.e. higher order terms should be taken into account in the integration over the momentum for @xmath227 .",

    "we have derived the shear viscosity coefficient @xmath15 from kinetic theory for massless particle system undergoing a one - dimensional expansion with bjorken boost - invariance .",
    "the derivation makes use of grad s moment method @xcite and is based on an expansion of the distribution function up to second order in momentum .",

    "( [ etacompact ] ) ] are shear tensor @xmath113 , the particle and energy densities @xmath103 and @xmath234 , the fugacity @xmath123 and finally the second moments @xmath235 of the collision term from the underlying kinetic process .",
    "they can be calculated either using transport setup solving the kinetic theory or from dissipative hydrodynamic ( israel - stewart ) equations ( [ 2nd_order_n])-([2nd_order1 ] ) . however , the is equations themselves need the value of shear viscosity as a parameter .",

    "we obtain @xmath221 in this regime . at",
    "such small coupling @xmath0 increases slightly in bamps and somewhat stronger in hydrodynamic calculations .",
    "this increase is due to the intrinsic fugacity , which evolves differently in both calculations .",
    "using is theory , we calculate @xmath0 ratio for a system close to equilibrium as a function of @xmath6 . for physical coupling @xmath236",
    "the second - order result is approximately @xmath1 higher than in calculations based on first order navier - stokes theory @xcite . for @xmath200 @xmath237 within the israel - stewart and navier - stokes prescription .",
    "deviations of hydrodynamic evolution from equilibrium are quantified in the present work introducing the variance @xmath143 of the nonequilibrium part of the distribution function .",
    "we demonstrate that its value is smaller than unity and later decreases with time at a physical coupling @xmath177 and thus our expression of @xmath15 is valid in this case . here",
