    "[ lissajous definition ] a lissajous knot @xmath2 in @xmath0 is one that can be represented parametrically by @xmath3 for integer frequencies @xmath4 , and @xmath5 , real phase shifts @xmath6 , and @xmath7 , and @xmath8 .    in order for the parameterized curve to actually be a knot ,",
    "that is , to not have any self - intersections , it follows easily that the three frequencies , @xmath4 and @xmath5 must be pair - wise relatively prime .",
    "furthermore , there are restrictions on the phase shifts . if we assume that @xmath9 , then the @xmath10 and @xmath11 phase shifts must _ not _ be of the form @xmath12 ( see @xcite or @xcite . ) note that by replacing @xmath13 with @xmath14 we may change the phase shifts , making any one of them zero for example .",
    "lissajous knots were first studied in @xcite where a few examples were given and a few properties of lissajous knots were derived . in particular it was shown that a lissajous knot with all odd frequencies is strongly plus amphicheiral and one with a single even frequency is @xmath15-periodic .",
    "these symmetries are easy to see . in the first case , consider the orientation reversing homeomorphism @xmath16 given by negating each coordinate , or in other words , reflecting through the origin . if @xmath17 is a lissajous knot with all odd frequencies then @xmath18 furthermore , it is not difficult to check that the orientation of @xmath2 is preserved .",
    "thus @xmath2 is strongly plus amphicheiral .",
    "if one of the frequencies is even , say @xmath19 , then a similar argument will show that a 180 degree rotation of @xmath0 around the @xmath10-axis will take @xmath2 to itself .",
    "thus @xmath2 is 2-periodic .",
    "being strongly plus amphicheiral is a fairly restrictive property and among all prime knots to 12 crossings only 3 have this quality  @xcite .",
    "these are 10a103 ( @xmath20 , 10a121 ( @xmath21 ) , and 12a427 .",
    "knot names are given in both the dowker - thistlethwaite ordering of the hoste - thistlethwaite - weeks table @xcite and , in parenthesis , the rolfsen  @xcite ordering ( for knots with 10 or less crossings ) .",
    "symmetries of the knots in the htw table were computed using _",
    "snappea _ as described in @xcite .",
    "the fact that 10a103 is lissajous is given in  @xcite and to date , it is the only one of these knots that has been shown to be lissajous .",
    "if @xmath2 is any knot and @xmath22 is its mirror image , then @xmath23 is strongly plus amphicheiral .",
    "currently , only three lissajous knots of this form have been found , namely when @xmath2 is 3a1 ( @xmath24 ) , 5a1 ( @xmath25 ) , and 6a3 ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "a list of lissajous knots with small crossing number which includes these examples is given in @xcite .",
    "in the case where one of the frequencies is even , and the knot is @xmath15-periodic , actually more is known . in this case , it is shown in both @xcite and @xcite that the knot must have linking number @xmath27 with the rotational axis of symmetry .",
    "both the trefoil knot and the figure eight knot for example are @xmath15-periodic . but",
    "neither has such a symmetry where their linking number with the axis of rotation is @xmath27 .",
    "this is because , as we will see shortly , neither can be a lissajous knot !",
    "the symmetry of a lissajous knot has a strong effect on its alexander polynomial .",
    "hartley and kawauchi  @xcite show that a strongly plus amphicheiral knot must have an alexander polynomial which is a perfect square . for knots that are @xmath15-periodic and",
    "link their axis of rotation @xmath27 times , murasugi  @xcite has shown that the alexander polynomial must be a square modulo 2 . from these facts",
    ", lamm shows that many large classes of knots are not lissajous .",
    "( see also @xcite . ) for example , if @xmath28 and @xmath29 are relatively prime integers larger than 1 , then the @xmath30-cable of any knot is not lissajous . in particular , torus knots ,",
    "iterated torus knots and non - trivial algebraic knots can not be lissajous .",
    "( thus the trefoil is not lissajous . )",
    "lamm also points out that these conditions on the alexander polynomial also imply that fibered knots with odd genus , and fibered 2-bridge knots are not lissajous .",
    "( thus the figure eight knot is not lissajous . )",
    "it is well known that the arf invariant of a knot may be derived from its alexander polynomial ( see the proof of lemma  [ alexpolyformula ] ) , and in @xcite it is shown that if the alexander polynomial is a square modulo 2 then the arf invariant is zero .",
    "thus the trefoil and figure eight knots can not be lissajous as each has an arf invariant of 1 .",
    "the fact that the arf invariant of a lissajous knot is zero was also proven in @xcite by a different method .",
    "all of the necessary conditions mentioned so far for a knot to be lissajous are derived from the symmetry of the knot : either strongly plus amphicheiral , or 2-periodic with linking number @xmath27 with the axis of rotation . in general , the implied statements about the alexander polynomial are strictly weaker and the fact that the arf invariant must be zero is weaker still . in rolfsen ) has arf invariant zero but its alexander polynomial is not a square modulo 2 .",
    "the knot 8n1 ( @xmath31 in rolfsen ) has alexander polynomial which is a square modulo 2 but it is not @xmath28-periodic for any @xmath28 .",
    "( see table i in @xcite ) .",
    "finally , the knot 8n1 ( @xmath31 in rolfsen ) has alexander polynomial a perfect square , but it is not strongly plus amphicheiral . ] to date these are the only known necessary conditions for a knot to be lissajous and it seems unlikely that these necessary conditions are sufficient .",
    "however , in this paper we show that these conditions are sufficient for the class of twist knots .",
    "in fact , a twist knot is lissajous if and only if its arf invariant is zero . for those twist knots that are not lissajous we know that infinitely many are _ second order _ lissajous .",
    "a second order lissajous knot is defined as follows .",
    "a second order lissajous knot @xmath2 is one that can be represented parametrically by @xmath32 for integer frequencies @xmath33 , and @xmath34 , real phase shifts @xmath35 , and @xmath36 , and @xmath8 .",
    "we believe the following conjecture to be true , and hope to include this result in a forthcoming paper .",
    "every twist knot with arf invariant 1 is second order lissajous .",
    "[ arf1conjecture ]    note that a second order lissajous knot has a _ lissajous projection _ ( in the @xmath10-@xmath11 plane ) . by employing large enough frequencies",
    "it seems reasonable to make the following conjecture .",
    "every knot has a lissajous projection .",
    "[ lpconjecture ]    while not explicitly stated as a conjecture in @xcite , this belief is evident in their paper and we echo their sentiment here .",
    "if conjecture  [ lpconjecture ] is true , then the height function @xmath37 can be estimated by a finite sum of cosine functions .",
    "whether just two ( or one ) cosine functions would then suffice in all cases , as we believe it does for all twist knots , is an interesting question .    in section  [ twist knots ]",
    "we show that a twist knot is lissajous if and only if its arf invariant is zero .",
    "next , in section  [ lp ] we give a general result that can be used to show that a knot has a lissajous projection .",
    "we use this to show that all 2-bridge knots have lissajous projections .",
    "finally , in the last section we continue with the techniques in section  [ lp ] to show that all @xmath1-torus knots have lissajous projections .    * acknowledgement * this research was carried out during the summer of 2005 as part of a _ research experiences for undergraduates _ program administered by the claremont colleges with funding from the national science foundation .",
    "the authors wish to thank the claremont colleges for their support and hospitality as well as both the claremont colleges and the national science foundation for funding the reu site .",
    "* postscript * after completing this paper we learned that lamm has proven conjecture  [ lpconjecture ] .",
    "the twist knot @xmath38 is defined as in figure  [ twistknot ] .",
    "there are @xmath39 crossings in the `` twisty '' part and then two more crossings in the left - handed `` clasp . ''",
    "if @xmath40 then the given diagram is alternating ( and reduced ) and thus depicts a knot with crossing number equal to @xmath41 .",
    "if @xmath42 , then the crossings in the `` twisty '' part have the opposite handedness . for example , @xmath43 is the figure eight knot , @xmath44 is the left - handed trefoil , and @xmath45 is the unknot .",
    "it is not difficult to show that @xmath38 and @xmath46 are mirror images of each other .",
    "we will consider two knots the same if there is a homeomorphism of @xmath0 to itself taking one knot to the other and therefore will not distinguish between a knot and its mirror image .",
    "thus , it suffices to consider only the case where @xmath47 is even .",
    "we begin with the following lemma .",
    "the alexander polynomial and the arf invariant of the twist knot @xmath48 are [ alexpolyformula ] @xmath49    * proof : * the first part is well known .",
    "see @xcite for example .    for any knot @xmath50",
    ", the arf invariant may be derived from the alexander polynomial as follows .",
    "@xmath51 in our case , @xmath52 which is 1 mod 8 if @xmath53 is even and 5 mod 8 if @xmath53 is odd",
    ". @xmath54    from lemma  [ alexpolyformula ]",
    "we see that the alexander polynomial of a twist knot is never a perfect square and hence twist knots are never strongly plus amphicheiral .",
    "thus none can be lissajous knots with all odd frequencies .",
    "it remains to consider the possibility that one frequency is even .",
    "the following lemma narrows the scope of our investigation .    for twist knots",
    "@xmath38 , the following are equivalent : [ equivalent conditions for twist knots ]    1 .",
    "@xmath38 is 2-periodic and has linking number @xmath55 with its rotational axis of symmetry .",
    "the alexander polynomial @xmath56 is a square modulo 2 .",
    "the arf invariant of @xmath38 is zero .",
    "* proof : * for any knot , @xmath57 .",
    "thus it remains to prove @xmath58 . as mentioned already",
    ", we may assume that @xmath47 is an even integer .",
    "suppose the arf invariant of @xmath48 is zero .",
    "thus lemma  [ alexpolyformula ] implies that @xmath53 must be even .",
    "figure  [ symmetry ] now shows that @xmath38 is 2-periodic . in the figure ,",
    "the box labeled @xmath53 indicates a total of @xmath53 crossings .",
    "the axis of rotation is perpendicular to the plane of the diagram and appears as a heavy dot in the center of the figure .",
    "the reader should check that the linking number with the axis is @xmath27 if @xmath53 is even and @xmath59 if @xmath53 is odd .",
    "@xmath54    because of lemma  [ equivalent conditions for twist knots ] it is quite natural to ask whether or not twist knots with arf invariant equal to zero are lissajous . by exploring lissajous knots with small frequencies",
    "one quickly finds that if @xmath60 and @xmath61 is odd , then the lissajous knot has a projection which _ could _ be the projection of a twist knot if all of the crossings are arranged in the appropriate way .",
    "for example , consider the two lissajous knots shown in figure  [ m=2 or 3 ] where @xmath62 or 7 and @xmath63 . arbitrarily choosing @xmath63 ,",
    "we are led to the following question : if @xmath64 and @xmath63 , can we choose @xmath5 and @xmath7 so as to produce a twist knot ? in order to study this question we begin by investigating the double points of the @xmath65-projection of a general lissajous knot .",
    "let @xmath17 be the lissajous knot parameterized as in definition  [ lissajous definition ] .",
    "suppose @xmath66 and @xmath67 give a double point in the projection to the @xmath65-plane .",
    "then the set of such pairs @xmath68 fall into two types .",
    "[ cols= \" < , > , < \" , ]     moreover , there are @xmath69 doubles points of type i , and @xmath70 double points of type ii .",
    "* proof : * we must find all pairs of times @xmath68 such that @xmath71 and @xmath72 . using the fact that @xmath73 if and only if @xmath74 is an integer multiple of @xmath75 , one is led to a number of cases that must be analyzed .",
    "see @xcite for further details .",
    "let @xmath76 and @xmath77 denote the crossings that occur at the double points of type i and ii respectively .",
    "by @xmath78 or @xmath79 we will mean the @xmath10 and @xmath11 values at that crossing .",
    "suppose now that @xmath64 and @xmath63 .",
    "then there are @xmath80 double points of type i. for each of these , @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "the time pairs are @xmath83 it is easy to show that @xmath84 for all @xmath85 and hence each type  i crossing lies on the @xmath10-axis .",
    "furthermore , it is not difficult to show that no type  i crossing can occur at the origin and the number of type  i double points that fall on the positive @xmath10-axis is @xmath86 .",
    "if we now look at the type  ii double points we see that there are @xmath87 of these given by the time pairs @xmath88 where @xmath89 if @xmath90 or @xmath91 and @xmath92 if @xmath93 .",
    "if we compute the value of @xmath11 at these crossings we obtain @xmath94 by computing the @xmath10 value of the type  ii crossings we obtain @xmath95 for all @xmath96 .",
    "furthermore , the number of type  ii crossings @xmath77 with @xmath97 is @xmath98 . of these",
    ", @xmath99 have @xmath93 while @xmath86 have @xmath90 or @xmath91 .",
    "finally , since @xmath60 , the knot is rotationally symmetric around the @xmath10-axis .",
    "thus the signs of @xmath100 and @xmath101 are the same as are the signs of @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "we now want to understand how the choice of @xmath5 and @xmath7 determines the crossing at each of the double points in the @xmath65-projection .",
    "note first that increasing the phase shift by @xmath104 will reflect the knot though the @xmath65-plane .",
    "thus we may assume that @xmath105 .",
    "suppose that at a double point of either type , @xmath106 .",
    "this occurs if and only if the sum or difference of @xmath107 and @xmath108 is an integer multiple of @xmath75 .",
    "if we examine the type  ii double points first , we find that all of the crossings @xmath102 become singular precisely when @xmath9 or @xmath104 .",
    "all the other type  ii crossings become singular precisely when @xmath109 . furthermore , both of these statements are independent of @xmath5 . in particular , once @xmath5 is chosen , we are free to vary @xmath7 between @xmath110 and @xmath111 without changing any of the type  ii crossings !",
    "we now turn our attention to the type  i crossings .",
    "since @xmath5 is odd , it is not hard to show that the difference of @xmath107 and @xmath108 can not be an even multiple of @xmath104 .",
    "however , their sum is an even multiple of @xmath104 if and only if @xmath112 for some integer @xmath113 . therefore , there are @xmath114 values of @xmath7 between @xmath110 and @xmath104 where all the type  i crossings become singular . these values , together with @xmath111 , give @xmath115 phases that must be avoided .",
    "the locations of these singular phases depend on @xmath5 but the number of them depend only on @xmath39 .",
    "thus , for a given choice of @xmath39 there are @xmath116 intervals where we may safely choose @xmath7 and varying @xmath7 within each interval will not cause any of the crossings to become singular .",
    "hence there are at most @xmath116 different lissajous knot types with @xmath117 and @xmath118 .    at this point",
    "it is a simple matter to program a computer to search through a large number of pairwise relatively prime frequencies @xmath119 and for each of these construct the @xmath120 possible lissajous knots .",
    "looking for twist knots in this way led to the following theorem .",
    "[ arf0ifflissajous ] a twist knot is lissajous if and only if its arf invariant is zero . in particular , the lissajous knot @xmath121 for @xmath122 is equivalent to @xmath123 if @xmath39 is even and @xmath124 if @xmath39 is odd .",
    "* proof : * if @xmath125 or @xmath126 it is easy to verify the result .",
    "thus , in everything that follows we assume that @xmath127 .",
    "diagrams for @xmath128 and 3 are shown in figure  [ m=2 or 3 ] . a nice pattern exists that we will show persists for all @xmath39 .",
    "consider the checkerboard coloring of the diagram and assume the unbounded region has been colored white .",
    "there are exactly @xmath39 white regions each having 4 edges and 4 vertices .",
    "we call these _ diamonds_. each diamond lies on the @xmath10-axis and contains two type  i crossings and two type  ii crossings .",
    "there are a total of @xmath39 diamonds and when @xmath39 is even , half lie on each side of the @xmath11-axis . when @xmath39 is odd , @xmath129 lie in the right half - plane and @xmath130 lie in the left half - plane .",
    "we claim that each diamond must appear as one of the four possibilities shown in figure  [ band crossing ] , which we call _ left band crossings _ , _ clasps _ , or _",
    "right band crossings_.    in figure  [ m=2 or 3 ] for example , notice that as we move from left to right the diamonds form a ( possibly empty ) string of left band crossings , then a clasp , and then a string of right band crossings .",
    "thus all of the right band crossings `` unravel '' and the clasp of the twist knot is formed at the diamond that is of type b ) or c ) in figure  [ band crossing ] . from this",
    "it clearly follows that the knot is indeed a twist knot .",
    "it suffices to prove the following four claims :    1 .",
    "if @xmath39 is even , then all type  i crossings in the right half - plane are left - handed and all type  i crossings in the left half - plane , _ except _ the one closest to the @xmath11-axis , are right - handed .",
    "if @xmath39 is odd , then all type  i crossings in the left half - plane are right - handed and all type  i crossings in the right half - plane , _ except _ the one closest to the @xmath11-axis , are left - handed .",
    "type ii crossings with @xmath131 are left - handed if and only if they lie in the right half - plane .",
    "type ii crossings with @xmath81 or @xmath91 are right - handed if and only if they lie in the right half - plane .    from these claims",
    "it is easy to establish    1 .",
    "if @xmath39 is even , the first diamond to the left of the @xmath11-axis is a clasp as shown in figure  [ band crossing]b .",
    "if @xmath39 is odd , the first diamond to the right of the @xmath11-axis is a clasp as shown in figure  [ band crossing]c . in either case ,",
    "all diamonds to the right of this clasp are right band crossings and all diamonds to its left are left band crossings .",
    "once statements 15 are proven we obtain the desired result as follows .",
    "each of the left band crossings contributes one full left - handed twist to the _ band _ of the twist knot and each of the type  ii crossings with @xmath131 in the left half - plane contributes half a left - handed twist .",
    "notice that since the edges of the band are oriented oppositely , these are actually right - handed crossings . finally , the left - most type  i crossing is right - handed and contributes half a left - handed twist to the band .",
    "thus if @xmath39 is odd for example , all of these crossings add up to @xmath132 right half - twists in the band .",
    "the clasp of the twist knot is right - handed .",
    "thus this knot is the mirror image of @xmath133 which is equivalent to @xmath124 .    in order to establish statements",
    "14 we study the signs of the crossings .",
    "suppose @xmath68 is a pair of times that gives a double point , and let @xmath134 be the tangent vector to the @xmath65-projection at @xmath135 .",

    "@xmath54    the closure of a lissajous arc is the knot projection obtained by connecting the ends of a lissajous arc with an arc whose interior is disjoint from the lissajous arc and which introduces no additional crossings .",
