    "the existence of nonzero neutrino masses has been confirmed in the last few decades and stimulated the activities aiming for the theory beyond the standard model . among various possible ways to introduce the neutrino masses into the model , adding gauge singlet fermions ( right - handed neutrinos ) is one of the most economical and attractive methods . in particular , the seesaw mechanism  @xcite naturally accounts for the observation that the neutrino masses are very small compared to the other fermions .",
    "moreover , it also gives a natural prescription for the baryon asymmetry of the universe by the leptogenesis scenario  @xcite .    besides the usual higher mass scales of the right - handed neutrinos around the grand unification scale , the lower mass ranges are also interesting and rich in phenomenology .",
    "for example , a kev sterile neutrino is a viable dark matter candidate  @xcite and accounts for the pulsar velocities  @xcite due to feebleness of its interactions .",
    "two quasi - degenerate sterile neutrinos in the mass range @xmath9 provide viable baryogenesis scenario alternative to the leptogenesis  @xcite .",
    "remarkably , these excellent features originate in a single framework so called @xmath10msm  @xcite , which is an extension of the standard model with three generations of the right - handed neutrinos . due to lower threshold energies of the production ,",
    "such `` light '' sterile neutrinos are more likely to be tested in existing and forthcoming experiments than the usual right - handed neutrinos with super heavy masses ( for example , see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "mass range by mass range , the sterile neutrinos may provide unique signals in various circumstances .",
    "it is thus interesting to study how to produce and detect the sterile neutrinos .    in this paper , we focus on the sterile neutrinos with the mass range @xmath11 and study their production in the atmosphere .",
    "the previous neutrino experiments , including peak searches in the meson decays  @xcite and the decay search with accelerators  @xcite , have placed certain bounds on the active  sterile mixing matrix in this mass range .",
    "the atmospheric sterile neutrino provides an independent and complemental test to these experiments with artificial neutrino sources .",
    "in particular , the peak searches of the pion and kaon decays put no stringent bound on the muon type mixing angle around @xmath12 .",
    "this spot will be effectively probed by the atmospheric sterile neutrino since the sterile neutrinos in this mass range can be copiously produced by the muon decays similar to the atmospheric active neutrinos .",
    "the production of sterile neutrinos in the atmosphere and their detection at super - kamiokande ( sk ) has been discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this work ,",
    "we extend and improve their work in both sterile neutrino production and its detection . in the flux estimation ,",
    "we carefully consider the production of the sterile neutrino not only by the @xmath13 decay , but also by the @xmath14 decay .",
    "the sterile neutrino flux does not receive the @xmath14 contributions for @xmath15 when the mixing with electron is sufficiently small ( as we will show later , this is indeed the case by considering the bounds on the mixings from direct search experiments ) , being different from the @xmath16 and @xmath17 fluxes .",
    "we also take into account the energy distribution of the daughter ( the sterile neutrino ) in the parent ( mainly muon ) decay and the phase space suppression due to the sterile neutrino mass . with the sterile neutrino mass around the neighborhood of the muon mass threshold ,",
    "the flux gets suppressed and the mixing bounds are significantly loosened compared to ref .",
    "furthermore , we study the kinematics of the detection process @xmath18 in detail , which include the distributions of the opening angle and the visible energy of the emitted @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "we estimate the upper bounds on the mixing angles by using 1489 days sk data  @xcite . in this estimation",
    ", we shall apply the cut to the events by requiring the visible energy being larger than @xmath21 in accordance with the sk data .",
    "this treatment also changes the previous results .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ flux ] , we calculate the sterile neutrino fluxes produced in the atmosphere . in section  [ events ] , the sterile neutrino decay @xmath18 and its event rate at sk are studied",
    ". section  [ summary ] is devoted to conclusions .",
    "we consider a gauge - singlet fermion @xmath22 with the mass range @xmath11 which mixes with the left - handed neutrino @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) as @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the pontecorvo - maki - nakagawa - sakata ( pmns ) matrix , @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) are the mass eigenstates of the active neutrinos .",
    "the parameter @xmath29 is the mixing between active and sterile neutrinos , which rules the interaction strength of @xmath22 .",
    "the extension to the multi - generation case is trivially done by replacing @xmath30 with @xmath31 . throughout this work ,",
    "we focus on the case where the sterile neutrino @xmath22 is mainly mixed with @xmath32 for the shake of simplicity .",
    "that is , we assume @xmath33 , unless otherwise stated .    indeed , the electron type mixing @xmath34 is much more severely constrained than the other two parameters .",
    "the peak search with @xmath35 mode suggests @xmath36 for @xmath37 , while the decay search with accelerators indicate the upper bound for @xmath38 varies from @xmath39 to @xmath40 in the mass rage @xmath41  @xcite . in the case of @xmath2 dominance ,",
    "the main decay mode of @xmath22 is @xmath42 and the subdominant mode is @xmath43 conducted by the neutral currents .",
    "the decay width of each process is given by @xmath44 in this paper , we focus on the case where the neutrinos are the majorana particles",
    ". then the lifetime of the sterile neutrino is given by @xmath45 @xmath46 and the corresponding decay length is @xmath47 for @xmath48 sterile neutrinos . for @xmath49 and @xmath50 for example ,",
    "the decay length is about half of the earth radius @xmath51 .",
    "the branching ratio of the detectable mode is @xmath52 .",
    "the sterile neutrinos are produced from charged pions and muons in the same manner as the active neutrinos .",
    "the main production processes are @xmath53 the former channel is open only for @xmath54 . the kaon contribution is negligible in the energy range of present concern . in the muon neutrino production for example , @xmath55 contribution becomes significant only in the high - energy regime @xmath56  @xcite .",
    "in fact , the vital part of the sterile neutrino flux is low - gamma regime @xmath57 for an evaluation of the detectability of the atmospheric sterile neutrinos to denote the gamma factor of the sterile neutrino unless otherwise mentioned . ] .",
    "namely , we are interested in the sterile neutrino spectrum at most up to @xmath58 for the mass range of @xmath11 .",
    "as we will discuss in section  [ events ] in detail , the sterile neutrinos are detected by the decay @xmath59 which leaves 2@xmath60-like rings in the detector .",
    "if the gamma factor of the sterile neutrino is too large , the two fuzzy rings will overlap each other and the separation of the rings becomes difficult .",
    "indeed , it turns out that @xmath61% ( @xmath62% ) of the whole events will be observed with the opening angle less then @xmath63 for @xmath64 .",
    "it is in general a complicated task to calculate the flux for such low - energy regime since it is affected by solar activity and the geomagnetic field . in this work ,",
    "we do not compute the flux from the primary cosmic ray spectrum directly , but we try to reconstruct a reasonable parent s ( muons and pions ) spectrum from the well - established active neutrino fluxes available in literature  @xcite and then evaluate the sterile neutrino flux from the reconstructed parent fluxes .",
    "the procedure goes as follows .",
    "we start from the @xmath65 and @xmath66 fluxes at sk site  @xcite to estimate the muon fluxes .",
    "the evolution of the neutrino flux @xmath67 is described by  @xcite @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the slant depth , @xmath70 is the muon flux , @xmath71 is the neutrino ( parent @xmath72 ) energy , @xmath73 is the muon decay length multiplied by the density of the atmosphere @xmath74 , @xmath75 is the decay width for @xmath76 in the laboratory frame . by integrating  ( [ m0 ] ) with respect to @xmath69 ,",
    "one finds @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the depth corresponding to the sea level . the sterile neutrino flux @xmath79 obeys the similar equation to the active neutrinos if the sterile neutrino decay in the atmosphere is negligible .",
    "in fact , the decay length for @xmath42 is much larger than the altitude of the mesosphere edge @xmath80 for most of the parameter space .",
    "only exception is the regime @xmath81 where @xmath42 is so rapid that some of the sterile neutrinos do not reach the detector .",
    "this means for example , the following estimation of the sterile neutrino spectrum is not reliable and may get additional suppression for @xmath82 in the parameter regime @xmath83 .",
    "putting aside this strong interacting regime , we have @xmath84 where @xmath85 and @xmath86 are the decay length and width for the mode @xmath87 . by using @xmath88 ,",
    "one finds @xmath89 here the integrated muon flux @xmath90 is obtained by fitting the left - hand side of  ( [ m1 ] ) with an assumption of power - low behavior of @xmath90 .",
    "the same exercise is applied for @xmath65-@xmath91-@xmath22 chain and then the flux for the majorana @xmath22 is obtained as the sum of these two contributions .",
    "details for the energy distributions in muon decay are presented in appendix  [ a1 ] .    in the mass regime @xmath92",
    ", pions also contribute to the sterile neutrino flux . roughly speaking",
    ", @xmath14 contribution is the same as the muon contribution , so that the flux of the sterile neutrino in @xmath93 regime is twice as large as the higher mass regime up to the threshold effect .",
    "the @xmath14 contribution is estimated in the same way as the muon . for the @xmath14 case , however , we need @xmath94 fluxes of @xmath14 origin to reconstruct the integrated @xmath14 fluxes from the muon neutrino input .",
    "we assess the @xmath94 of @xmath14 origin by subtracting the @xmath94 of @xmath13 origin from the full @xmath94 data in ref .",

    "( [ m1 ] ) . finally , the sterile neutrino flux of @xmath14 origin is calculated by @xmath96 where @xmath97 and @xmath98 are the decay width for @xmath99 and @xmath100 , respectively . here",

    "[ fluxa ] shows the sterile neutrino fluxes for several examples of @xmath102 .",

    "it is seen that a naive estimation @xmath104 made in ref .",
    "@xcite is good for the energies above the mass threshold with @xmath105 , but it breaks down significantly for @xmath106 in such a way that the calculated fluxes are suppressed as @xmath102 increases .",
    "this rapid fall off with respect to @xmath102 is due to the phase space suppression of the muon decay ( see eq .",
    "( [ phases ] ) ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the phase space suppression of @xmath14 decay is significant only at the vicinity of the threshold @xmath107 .",
    "as @xmath102 increases , the flux thus suddenly drops by factor of two at the threshold @xmath108 above which the @xmath14 contribution vanishes .",
    "the sterile neutrino fluxes presented here are averaged over the zenith angle and given at the middle level of solar activity following the input neutrino fluxes in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the uncertainty of the reconstructed parent fluxes @xmath109 and @xmath110 is small for high - energy regime , but it becomes larger as the energy is lowered so that the resultant sterile neutrino fluxes carry certain ambiguity around @xmath111 .",
    "this is because high - energy part of the active neutrino flux is well fitted by a single - power low , while low - energy part are complex and many choices are available as fitting function . in this analysis",
    ", we have used the fitting function @xmath112 , where @xmath113 and @xmath114 are the high and low - energy part of the fitting function . for @xmath113 ,",
    "we have taken @xmath115 with some constants @xmath116 and the gamma factor @xmath117 of the parent particle of interest . for @xmath114 ,",
    "we have examined two options @xmath118 or @xmath119 , where @xmath120 is the beta factor of the parent particle .",
    "while with the former @xmath114 the flux rises from the mass threshold and continuously shifts to constant behavior and is finally reduced to @xmath113 , the latter @xmath114 has discontinuity at the mass threshold and the peak is slightly shifted to lower energies compared with the former one .",
    "it turns out that two different fitting bring at most @xmath121% difference in the total number of events .",
    "we would like to emphasize that the salient feature of the phase space suppression  ( [ phases ] ) is however independent from the fitting scheme and the conclusions derived from this effect are valid in what follows .",
    "the fluxes shown in fig .",
    "[ fluxa ] are calculated with the option @xmath118 and these fluxes are used in the following analyses .",
    "the sterile neutrinos @xmath22 are produced in the atmosphere and reach the sk site to leave 2@xmath60-like events via @xmath59 and @xmath122 .",
    "suppose that the fiducial volume of sk is represented by a sphere of radius @xmath123 .",
    "the event rate is then given by @xmath124 where @xmath125 and @xmath126 are the decay width and length for the signal decay of @xmath22 , @xmath127 is an observable of interest , _",

    "one finds @xmath143 which is independent from the total decay width and depends only on the partial decay width @xmath125 responsible for the detection channel .",

    "as we will see later , the asymmetry is unlikely to be observed for @xmath149 and @xmath150 where the number of events does not exceed the 2@xmath60-like ring data of sk .    if @xmath151 is switched on , however , it hastens both decay @xmath42 and @xmath152 while the production processes are kept unchanged . with @xmath151 being finite ,",
    "the decay width of each mode is obtained by replacing @xmath38 with @xmath153 in  ( [ decay1 ] ) and  ( [ decay2 ] ) . by virtue of @xmath154 ,",
    "the above two decay modes are induced only by the neutral current so that the effect of @xmath155 simply appears as such a simple replacement . on the other hand ,",
    "the production processes of @xmath22 are not affected by @xmath151 since the decays of @xmath14 and @xmath13 are induced by the charged current and can not involve a tauon . under the assumption that @xmath156 , the production processes thus involve only @xmath2 . in the flux equation  ( [ phin ] ) , the decay term of @xmath22 would not be negligible if @xmath157 is large .",
    "this effect however gives negligible contribution to the ratio of upward to downward - going events since the thickness of the atmosphere is small compared to the earth s diameter .",
    "an interesting possibility in view of the up - down asymmetry is therefore @xmath158 with which the flux is feeble while the decay probability is high . in such case",
    "the event rate is proportional to @xmath159 instead of @xmath147 , where @xmath38 comes from the production and @xmath160 is from the detection . let us set @xmath161 to obtain @xmath162 events per year .",

    "the master formula for the event rate  ( [ erate ] ) involves the product of the production and the detection probabilities .",
    "that is , the product of the squared modulus of the production and the detection amplitudes .",
    "this means that  ( [ erate ] ) is valid in the case where the coherence between the propagating neutrino states is lost .",
    "since we have the sterile neutrino and the active neutrinos in the theory , one may wonder if the oscillation between the active and sterile states occurs .",
    "however , the coherence between the active and sterile states is explicitly violated at the detection point ; the sterile neutrino decays while the active neutrinos do not . furthermore , even if the coherence were not violated by the detection , such an oscillation would be so rapid that the effect is averaged out , which also insures the validity of using  ( [ erate ] ) .",
    "in fact , with @xmath166 and a typical energy of @xmath167 for example , the oscillation length @xmath168 would be @xmath169 . in the present setup ,",
    "it is quite difficult to observe oscillatory behavior between the active and the sterile neutrinos .",
    "the sterile neutrino decay @xmath170 in the sk detector produces two fuzzy cherenkov rings .",
    "a possible background for this signal is @xmath171 , where @xmath172 are mainly created via the neutral current interactions of the atmospheric active neutrinos .",
    "the gamma rays in the final state develop into electromagnetic showers and create two fuzzy rings which can not be distinguished from the @xmath173 signals .",

    "second , in the small - mass region @xmath222 , the event cuts ( mainly the visible energy cut @xmath223 ) reduce the number of events so that the bound is pushed up from the curve without the cuts .",
    "finally , careful handling of the @xmath14 and @xmath13 contributions for the sterile neutrino production makes a small dip at @xmath224 since the number of events are reduced for @xmath225 according to the absence of the @xmath14 contributions .",
    "the light - element abundances predicted by the big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) is kept unspoiled if the lifetime of @xmath22 is short enough such that the sterile neutrinos are cleared away before the onset of the bbn . according to ref .",
    "@xcite , the successful bbn requires @xmath226 for @xmath227 . here",
    "this limit is valid for the dirac type sterile neutrino which mixes with only one active flavor . for the majorana case ,",
    "this limit becomes two times weaker since the total decay width of the majorana particle involves an extra factor of two .",
    "most of the allowed region in fig .",
    "[ boundfig ] is in fact under tension with the limit  ( [ bbnlim ] ) .",
    "however , this tension is relaxed if @xmath151 is turned on .",
    "namely , the lifetime is shortened by increasing @xmath157 .",
    "the point is that the production of the sterile neutrino in the atmosphere is not affected by @xmath157 .",
    "hence , by taking @xmath158 , one can set a short lifetime enough to avoid the bbn limit while keeping the atmospheric sterile neutrinos consistent with the sk data .",
    "notice that fig .",
    "[ boundfig ] can be read as a plot for @xmath228 if @xmath158 .",
    "interestingly , the directional asymmetry ( see fig .  [ eventtot ] and related discussion ) is likely to be observed in such a circumstance .    if the visible energy cut @xmath229 is switched off , the sterile neutrino events in the first three bins increase as shown in fig .",
    "[ meecutfig ] , while the background and its mote carlo simulation might change differently depending on the source of the background .",
    "such an analysis is important especially for light sterile neutrinos with @xmath230 but beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we have studied the production and the detection of the atmospheric sterile neutrinos . with the mass range @xmath0 ,",
    "the sterile neutrinos are produced by muon or pion decays .",
    "the main decay mode of the sterile neutrino @xmath22 is @xmath42 ( @xmath231% ) and the subdominant mode is @xmath170 ( @xmath232% ) .",
    "interestingly , the detection via the subdominant channel is feasible at super - kamiokande . to estimate the amount of the sterile neutrino flux @xmath233",
    ", we have reconstructed the parent muon and pion integrated fluxes from the well - established active neutrino fluxes @xmath234 by making a power - low ansatz for the shape of the spectrum .",
    "we have calculated the sterile neutrino flux from the reconstructed parent fluxes and the energy distributions of each decay mode .",
    "the phase space suppression of the muon decay @xmath235 is so effective that the estimated sterile neutrino flux is much less than the naive expectation of @xmath236 for @xmath237 .    for the detection",
    ", we have calculated the number of the decay event @xmath170 at sk .",
    "the upper bound for the muon - type mixing @xmath2 is estimated by comparing the invariant mass distribution of the @xmath173 pair and the observational data of the 2@xmath60-like rings . to estimate the bound",
    ", the visible energy cut @xmath229 is taken into account in accordance with the sk data .",
    "moreover , we have studied the opening angle of the @xmath173 momenta and clarify the impact of the minimal opening angle under which the two fuzzy rings can not be identified separately .",
    "the upper bound for higher mass regime @xmath221 is significantly relaxed compared to the previous estimation due to the phase space suppression of the muon decay . in addtion , the inclusion of the kinematical cuts also relaxes the bound for lower mass regime and changes the shape of the bound entirely .    fig .",
    "[ boundfig2 ] shows the upper bound in comparison with the other experiments ( see for example , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in the mass window of @xmath238 ,",
    "the atmospheric bound is stronger than the peak search in the meson decays .",
    "however , the bound from the accelerator decay search to apply the bound from ref .",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite . ] is stronger than the atmospheric bound by a factor of two at @xmath239 and by a factor of 10 at @xmath240 .",
    "we nevertheless believe that the search for the atmospheric sterile neutrino is an issue of great interest .",
    "one reason is that not a few progresses in particle physics have been made in cooperation between artifical and natural source experiments . since ps191 is the sole experiment which set the bound stronger than the atmospheric one in the window @xmath238 , the atmospheric sterile neutrino can play a role of a unique follow - up experiment with a natural source .",
    "moreover , many points are to be ameliorated for better sensitivities of the atmospheric sterile neutrino .",
    "it is obvious that our naive scheme to estimate the upper bound does not reflect the accumulation of statistics and more advanced analysis should be performued for precise argument .",
    "the 2@xmath60-like ring data for ski , skii and skiii  @xcite can be combined to squeeze the room remained for the sterile neutrino .",
    "furthermore , the analysis of the 2@xmath60-like events can be customized aiming for the sterile neutrino detection .",
    "for instance , one can switch off the visible energy cut of @xmath21 and track the direction of the sum of the two ring s momenta , the opening angle between two rings and the visible energy . this may dramatically change the sensitivity if the background behaves differently from the signal in the up / down - going ratio , openging angle distribution , visible energy distribution and so on . as for the detection facility , hyper - kamiokande has been proposed with the fiducial volume 25 time larger than sk  @xcite , and hence the number of events increases by the same amount , which improve the bound , roughly speaking , by a factor of five . if the new customized analysis upgrades the sensitivity for @xmath241 by a factor of two for instance , hyper - kamiokande will improve the bound by one order of magnitude and will reach the present accelerator bound . with the refinement of the analysis and the upgrade of the facility , there will be a good chance to discover the atmospheric sterile neutrino .",
