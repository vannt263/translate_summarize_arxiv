    "over the past fifteen years there has been an increasing scientific interest in crystalline organic metals and superconductors .",
    "these materials are made up of relatively small organic molecules constructed from carbon , sulphur , selenium , hydrogen and the like , combined with a second molecular species , either inorganic or organic .",
    "one usually thinks of solids made up from organic molecules as insulators ; however , the crystalline organic metals conduct electricity , and their low temperature resistivity usually decreases with decreasing temperature , a classic signature of more conventional ( elemental ) metals .",
    "the reason for the current intense interest in organic metals is that they form a uniquely flexible system for the study of superconductivity , magnetism and many - body effects  @xcite . in this context",
    ", the term `` many - body effects '' refers to the interactions experienced by the mobile electrons within the organic metal ; in such systems , the electrons can no longer be thought of as independent entities , but instead interact with each other and with excitations such as phonons ( i.e. the vibrations of the crystal lattice ) .",
    "materials in which such many - body effects are important are often referred to as _ correlated electron systems_.    of course there are other interesting correlated - electron system .",
    "prime examples are the so - called `` high @xmath0 '' cuprate superconductors ( e.g. yba@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath3 ) which have been the subject of considerable experimental and theoretical effort .",
    "organic metals share many features with the cuprates a quasi - two - dimensional bandstructure , the proximity of antiferromagnetism , superconductivity and insulating behaviour , unconventional superconductivity  @xcite and yet they are much cleaner systems ; it has been possible to measure many details of the electronic energy levels of the organics using accurate techniques  @xcite , whereas this has proved impossible in the cuprates . finally , the organics are interesting because a variety of exotic phases have been predicted and measured at potentially accessible magnetic fields ( @xmath4  t ) and temperatures  @xcite",
    ".    the description `` organic superconductor '' can encompass quite a range of materials ( e.g. quasi - one - dimensional superconductors of the form ( tmtsf)@xmath1x  @xcite , derivatives of buckminsterfullerene  @xcite and the recently - discovered field - effect devices based on acene and its relatives  @xcite ) .",
    "each of these is worth a review article in its own right . to avoid information overload ,",
    "we shall therefore concentrate solely on the quasi - two - dimensional organic superconductors , which form a rich and diverse family of materials  @xcite .",
    "these systems are also of interest because they are perhaps the closest organic relative of the above - mentioned cuprate superconductors  @xcite",
    ".    the review will describe the normal state properties of the organics , followed by a discussion of the proposed mechanisms for superconductivity .",
    "afterwards , the superconducting phase diagram will be reviewed .",
    "finally , we shall mention some recent instances of ( in some cases exotic ) field - induced superconductivity .",

    "] of quasi - two - dimensional organic superconductors are derived from _",
    "a number of molecular species are used as bandstructure building blocks ; bis(ethylenedithio)tetrathiofulvalene ( also known as bedt - ttf or et ; figure  [ etmolecule ] ) is a typical example  @xcite .",
    "although such molecules look complicated ( and their acronyms may seem daunting ) at first sight , the principles behind their use in the construction of crystalline organic metals are very simple . for example , the bedt - ttf molecule is roughly flat , so that it can be packed in a variety of arrangements in a solid , and it is surrounded by voluminous molecular orbitals ; to create electronic bands , it is merely necessary to stack the bedt - ttf molecules next to each other , so that the molecular orbitals can overlap . crudely one might say that this enables the electrons to transfer from molecule to molecule .",
    "most of the molecules used to create quasi - two - dimensional organic superconductors are of a similar form to bedt - ttf ; for example , when the innermost four sulphur atoms of bedt - ttf are replaced by selenium , one obtains bets ( bis(ethylenedithio)tetraselenafulvalene )  @xcite , which can also be used to produce organic superconductors .",
    "other varieties include bedo  @xcite and mdt - ttf  @xcite .    returning to our initial example , in order to form the bandstructure ,",
    "bedt - ttf molecules must be stacked next to each other so that the molecular orbitals overlap .",
    "this arrangement of the bandstructure - forming molecules in an ordered arrangement is usually accomplished by making a _ charge - transfer salt _",
    "@xcite . in a charge - transfer salt",
    ", a number @xmath5 of bedt - ttf molecules will jointly donate an electron to a second type of molecule ( or collection of molecules ) which we label @xmath6 , to form the compound ( bedt - ttf)@xmath7 ; owing to its negative charge , @xmath6 is known as the _ anion _ , while the bedt - ttf molecule is sometimes referred to as the _ donor _ or _",
    "cation_. the transfer of charge serves to bind the charge - transfer salt together ( in a manner analogous to ionic bonding ) and also leaves behind a hole , jointly shared between the @xmath5 bedt - ttf molecules .",
    "this means that the bands formed by the overlap of the bedt - ttf molecular orbitals will be _ partially filled _",

    "conversely , in the direction perpendicular to the bedt - ttf planes , the bedt - ttf molecules are well separated from each other ; the transfer integrals will be much smaller in this direction ( i.e. hopping is more difficult ) .",
    "this extreme anisotropy , resulting from a layered structure , is typical of most quasi - two - dimensional organic superconductors ; it results in electronic properties which for many purposes can be considered to be two dimensional .",

    "however , the packing arrangement of the bedt - ttf molecules is considerably different from that in @xmath9-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1cu(ncs)@xmath1 .",
    "a comparison of figures  [ kappapic ] and [ beta ] shows that charge - transfer salts are an extremely flexible system with which to study the physics of band formation ; by changing the anion , one can make the bedt - ttf molecules pack in different arrangements . as the bedt - ttf molecules are long and flat ( unlike single atoms ) , the transfer integrals will depend strongly on the way in which the bedt - ttf molecules are arranged with respect to each other ; this will be reflected in the _ shape _ of the resulting bands  @xcite .",
    "it is therefore convenient to classify charge - transfer salts according to their crystal structures , as each packing arrangement results in a distinct electronic - band topology .",
    "the main arrangements are labelled the @xmath11 , @xmath10 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath9 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 phases  @xcite .",

    "it can be seen that increasing the pressure ( which decreases the unit cell size ) lowers @xmath0 ; substitution of a larger anion increases the unit cell size , countering the effect .     versus hydrostatic pressure for three @xmath10-phase bedt - ttf ( et ) salts .",
    "decreasing the unit cell size , either by using a shorter anion or by increasing the pressure , reduces @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "( note that @xmath10-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1i@xmath2 undergoes a structural phase transition at about 0.6  kbar . ) , height=226 ]    the use of different anions to vary the unit cell size is often referred to as `` chemical pressure '' .",
    "we shall return to the variation of @xmath0 with pressure in sections  [ s2p5 ] and [ s3p1p1 ] .",
    "the defining property of a metal is that it possesses a _ fermi surface _ , that is , a constant - energy surface in @xmath18-space which separates the filled electron states from empty electron states at absolute zero ( @xmath19 ) . the energy of a quasiparticle ; until then , the reader is advised to regard quasiparticle as a general term for an electron or hole in a solid ( see e.g. reference  @xcite , chapter 8) . ] at the fermi surface is known as the _ fermi energy _ , @xmath20 .",
    "the shape of the fermi surface is determined by the dispersion relationships ( energy versus * k * relationships ) @xmath21 of each partially - filled band and the number of electrons ( or holes ) to be accommodated .",
    "virtually all of the properties of a metal are determined by the quasiparticles at the fermi surface , as they occupy states which are adjacent in energy to empty states ; therefore they are able to respond to external forces and other perturbations ( see e.g. chapters 1,2 and 8 of reference  @xcite ) .",
    "as has been mentioned in the preceding section , the organic superconductors discussed in this review are highly anisotropic ; most of the quasiparticle motion occurs within the highly - conducting planes .",
    "the fermi - surface topology is dominated by this consideration ; the interlayer motion is far less important . in this section",
    "we shall therefore examine the cross - sections of the fermi surfaces parallel the highly - conducting planes ; the slight variations in fermi - surface cross - sectional area will be discussed in section  [ s2p3 ] .",
    "figure  [ fspic](a ) shows a section ( parallel to the highly - conducting planes ) through the first brillouin zone and fermi surface of @xmath9-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1cu(ncs)@xmath1  @xcite .",

    ", height=226 ]    the fermi surface may be understood by examining figure  [ kappapic](b )  @xcite . note that the bedt - ttf molecules are packed in pairs called _ dimers _ ; if we consider each dimer as a unit , it will be seen that it is surrounded by four other dimers .",
    "we thus expect the bandstructure to be fairly isotropic in the plane , because there will be substantial , similar transfer integrals in these four directions .",
    "the unit cell contains two dimers , each of which contributes a hole ( in the charge - transfer process , two bedt - ttf molecules jointly donate one electron to the anion ) .",
    "thus , to a first approximation , the fermi surface for holes might be expected to be roughly circular with the same area as the brillouin zone ( as there are two holes per unit cell)-space ) lattice .",
    "the @xmath18-space size of the fermi surface follows from the properties of phase - space .",
    "each quasiparticle donated by a unit cell contributes a volume to the fermi surface equivalent to half the volume of the brillouin zone .",
    "see e.g. reference  @xcite , chapters 1 , 2 , 8 and appendix a , or reference  @xcite . ] .",
    "as can be seen from figure  [ fspic](a ) , the fermi surface is _ roughly _ like this ; however , the fermi surface intersects the brillouin zone boundaries in the * c * direction , so that band gaps open up ( see e.g. chapter 2 of reference  @xcite ) .",
    "the fermi surface thus splits into open ( electron - like ) sections ( often known as _ fermi sheets _ ) running down two of the brillouin - zone edges and a closed hole pocket ( referred to as the `` @xmath11 pocket '' ) straddling the other ; it is customary to label such sections `` quasi - one - dimensional '' and `` quasi - two - dimensional '' respectively .",
    "the names arise because the group velocity @xmath22 of the electrons is given by  @xcite . ]",
    "@xmath23 the fermi surface is a surface of constant energy ; equation  [ velocities ] shows that the velocities of electrons at the fermi surface will be directed perpendicular to it .",
    "therefore , referring to figure  [ fspic ] , electrons on the closed fermi - surface pocket can possess velocities which point in any direction in the ( @xmath24 ) plane ; they have freedom of movement in two dimensions and are said to be _ quasi - two - dimensional_. by contrast , electrons on the open sections have velocities predominently directed parallel to @xmath25 and are _ quasi - one - dimensional_.    @xmath9-phase bedt - ttf superconductors @xmath9-(bedt - ttf)@xmath17 can be made with a variety of other anion molecules , including @xmath26 cu[n(cn)@xmath1]br ( 11.8  k ) , cu[n(cn)@xmath1]cl ( 12.8  k ( under pressure ) ) , and i@xmath2 ( 4  k ) ; here the number in parentheses represents @xmath0 . in all of these salts ,",
    "the fermi - surface topology is very similar to that in figure  [ fspic](a ) ; small differences in the symmetry of the anion layer lead to variations in the gap between the quasi - one - dimensional and quasi - two - dimensional fermi - surface sections  @xcite .",
    "a summary of the detailed differences and effective masses is given in section 3.2 of reference  @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "figure  [ fspic](b ) shows the fermi - surface topology and brillouin zone of @xmath10-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1ibr@xmath1  @xcite . in this case",
    "( see figure  [ beta ] ) there is one hole per unit cell , so that the fermi surface cross - sectional area is half that of the brillouin zone ; only a quasi - two - dimensional pocket is present .",
    "we have therefore seen that the bandstructure of a charge - transfer salt is chiefly determined by the packing arrangement of the cation molecules . as sources of superconductors ,",
    "the @xmath10 , @xmath9 , @xmath28 , @xmath16 and @xmath11 phases have been the most important .",
    "the latter four phases all have predicted fermi surfaces consisting of a quasi - two - dimensional pocket plus a pair of quasi - one - dimensional fermi sheets ( the pocket arrangement differs from phase to phase )  @xcite ; the @xmath10-phase is alone in possessing a fermi surface consisting of a single quasi - two - dimensional pocket  @xcite .",
    "the bandstructures of organic superconductors have usually been calculated using the extended hckel ( tight - binding ) approach , which employs the highest occupied molecular orbitals ( homos ) of the cation molecule  @xcite .",
    "section  5.1.3 of reference  @xcite discusses this approach and cites some of the most relevant papers . whilst this method is usually quite successful in predicting the main features of the fermi surface ( _ e.g. _ the fact that there are quasi - one - dimensional and quasi - two - dimensional fermi - surface sections ) ,",
    "the details of the fermi - surface topology are sometimes inadequately described ( see _ e.g. _",
    "this can be important when , for example , the detailed corrugations of a fermi sheet govern the interactions which determine its low - temperature groundstate  @xcite .",
    "a possible way around this difficulty is to make slight adjustments of the transfer integrals so that the predicted fermi surface is in good agreement with experimental measurements  @xcite . in the @xmath12 and @xmath16 phases",
    "the predicted bandstructure seems very sensitive to the choice of basis set , and the disagreement between calculation and measurement is often most severe ( see _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite ) .",

    "these calculations attempt to take into account many - body effects , and are successful in reproducing a number of experimental properties .",
    "they also indicate the importance of both antiferromagnetic fluctuations and electron - phonon interactions in , a fact to which we shall return in sections  [ s3p1p1 ] and [ s3p4 ] .",
    "the low scattering rates in quasi - two - dimensional organic superconductors mean that it is possible to use a range of techniques to make accurate measurements of the fermi - surface topology .",

    "figure  [ chuck ] shows that a preferable value would be around 9.5  k. ]    how can the transition be so wide in such a clean material ?",
    "the reason is perhaps associated with the exceptionally two - dimensional nature of the superconductivity . let us suppose that there are variations in the local potential caused by defects etc .. in a three - dimensional superconductor , the effects of such variations ( e.g. on the local density of states ) will be averaged over a _ volume _ given roughly by @xmath163 , where @xmath164 is the coherence length .",

    "by contrast , the `` hump '' is largest when the current is in the interplane direction for very pure samples  @xcite , so that it may be an intrinsic feature of these layered materials  @xcite .",

    "<S> moreover , it has been possible to measure the electronic bands of many of the organics in great detail , in contrast to the situation in other well - known systems in which similar phenomena occur . </S>",
    "<S> we describe the crystal structure and normal - state properties of the organics , before presenting the experimental evidence for and against exotic superconductivity mediated by antiferromagnetic fluctuations . finally , three instances of field - induced unconventional superconductivity will be described . </S>"
