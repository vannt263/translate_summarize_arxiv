    "the suppression of superconductivity with the increase in ni concentration clearly demonstrates the important role of eu magnetic ordering and its interplay with superconductivity . the small shift of eu magnetic ordering temperature with magnetic field and the absence of field induced metamagnetic transition in the @xmath41 curves for @xmath4 = 0.08 and 0.12 samples point towards the helical magnetic structure of the eu magnetic moments .",
    "thus the helimagnetism could be responsible for the destruction of the sc as has been proposed for the co - doped eufe@xmath1as@xmath1 . the electrical resistivity and specific heat measurements clearly demonstrate the reappearance of spin density wave anomaly for @xmath4 = 0.08 and 0.12 which arises due to the compensation of the holes created on the k - doping by the electrons on ni substitution for fe .",
