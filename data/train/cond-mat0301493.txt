    "pure ferromagnets are generally not described as glassy materials , which are loosely defined as systems with large relaxation times . however ,",
    "if a ferromagnet initially prepared at high temperature is suddenly quenched to its low temperature ferromagnetic phase , its equilibration time diverges with system size  @xcite .",
    "this is true also when the quench is performed precisely to the critical point , @xmath14 . in both cases",
    "the system remains , in the thermodynamic limit , forever in a non - equilibrated , non - stationary state : it exhibits aging .",
    "therefore , one can study physical situations in pure ferromagnets that are reminiscent of aging phenomena observed e.g.  in spin glasses , polymers or colloids .",
    "one is then led to ask if the tools used in the glass literature are also useful to describe this type of non - equilibrium situation .",
    "these tools include , in particular , two - time correlation and response functions .",
    "consider two physical observables @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "their connected cross - correlation is defined by @xmath17 while the conjugate response function is given by @xmath18 here @xmath19 is the thermodynamically conjugate field to the observable @xmath20 ; for later convenience we scale the response by @xmath21 . numerically or experimentally",
    ", it is often more convenient to measure the integrated response function , or susceptibility , @xmath22 which gives the response to a small constant field @xmath19 switched on at the ` waiting time ' @xmath23 .    at equilibrium , correlation and response",
    "are time - translation invariant and related by the fdt @xmath24 in that case , @xmath25 in eqs .",
    "( [ corrab],[respab ] ) stands for the usual ensemble average .",
    "if one follows instead the dynamics of the system after a sudden quench , the system is out of equilibrium and neither time - translation invariance nor fdt are satisfied .",
    "then @xmath25 is to be read as an average over initial conditions and any stochasticity in the dynamics . in infinite - range glass models ,",
    "a generalized fdt is satisfied in the aging dynamics .",
    "the generalization amounts to the introduction of a fluctuation - dissipation ratio ( fdr ) , @xmath26 , through @xmath27 this definition becomes non - trivial because in the limit of long times @xmath28 and @xmath23 the fdr reduces to a function of a single variable only , namely the correlation function , @xmath29 where by a an abuse of notation we retain the same symbol for the fdr and its long - time limit . as in equilibrium , response and correlation are then no longer independent quantities , although their relationship is now more complex .",
    "it is now standard to study this generalized fdt via the parametric representation , or ` fd plot ' , of the susceptibility @xmath30 as a function of the correlation @xmath31  @xcite . at equilibrium",
    ", one has @xmath32 .",
    "hence , a plot of @xmath33 against @xmath34 gives a simple straight line of slope @xmath35 : this is the equilibrium fd plot .",
    "out of equilibrium , eq .",
    "( [ fdrab ] ) implies @xmath36 therefore , when eq .",
    "( [ fdrab ] ) holds , the fdr can be obtained directly from the slope of the fd plot , which is @xmath37 . otherwise , from eq .",
    "( [ fdtab ] ) a plot of @xmath33 against @xmath38 , with @xmath28 fixed and @xmath23 the curve parameter , will still have slope @xmath26 .",
    "since the amplitude of correlation and response functions can diverge or converge to zero for @xmath39 ( see below ) it can be useful to use normalized quantities , plotting @xmath40 versus @xmath41 where @xmath42 .",
    "since the normalization factors are independent of @xmath23 , the slope of the fd plot is then still given by @xmath8 .",
    "the normalization issue is less important when presenting numerical data , which are by construction obtained in a restricted time window where the amplitudes of the dynamical quantities typically change only slowly .",
    "appealingly , the fdr can also be interpreted as defining an effective temperature , @xmath43 , replacing the equilibrium temperature @xmath21 by an equivalent quantity out of equilibrium .",
    "moreover , it is a general result that for the case @xmath44 , where one considers the autocorrelation of @xmath45 and the associated response , @xmath10 is the temperature measured by a thermometer coupled to the observable @xmath45 at the appropriate timescale  @xcite . as a direct corollary , this effective temperature then satisfies the zeroth law of thermodynamics .",
    "clearly , however , the introduction of an effective temperature is of thermodynamic interest only if @xmath10 is actually independent of the observables @xmath45 and @xmath20 under consideration .",
    "this is indeed true for infinite - range glass models  @xcite , implying that although the system is out of equilibrium it can still be described in thermodynamic terms , at the moderate cost of introducing one extra parameter , namely the effective temperature  @xcite . beyond infinite - range glass models ,",
    "the observable - dependence of the effective temperature remains largely an open question but has been discussed in detail in the context of trap models  @xcite and in a realistic numerical model of a supercooled liquid  @xcite .      for ferromagnets ,",
    "two - time dynamical functions have been studied both for a quench to the low temperature phase and to criticality , with most work to date focused on the first situation .    in the low temperature phase ,",
    "the evolution of the system consists in the growth of ordered domains , with a typical domain size @xmath46 .",
    "two - time quantities that have been thoroughly studied are the spin autocorrelation function , @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the value of the spin at site @xmath49 at time @xmath28 , and the conjugate response function , @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the magnetic field at site @xmath49 . in this case , the connected and disconnected correlations coincide since @xmath52 at all stages of the coarsening process . from the analytical solution of solvable models  @xcite and the simulation of more realistic situations  @xcite , the behavior of these two quantities is now well known . for small time differences , @xmath53 , time - translation invariant behavior",
    "is observed , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and the fdt @xmath56 is obeyed .",
    "this first regime is due to thermal fluctuations in the bulk of the domains , which are essentially equilibrium fluctuations . for larger time separations , @xmath57 , the fluctuations of the interfaces dominate the dynamical behavior .",
    "the reasonable hypothesis that coarsening is a self - similar process , in the sense that for large times all dynamical functions depend on time only through the typical domain size @xmath58 , implies the scaling form @xmath59 for the correlation function .",
    "the contribution of the interfaces to the response function can be estimated  @xcite as a sum over all wavevectors , @xmath60 .",
    "this expression results from the fact that the response at time @xmath23 is dominated by large wavevectors , @xmath61 , each wavevector @xmath62 giving a contribution of the order of @xmath63 .",
    "the factor @xmath64 represents the density of domain walls , and @xmath65 is a uv cutoff given by the lattice spacing .",
    "this reasoning implies for the long - time contribution to the susceptibility the scaling form @xmath66 , where the function @xmath67 depends on the dimensionality @xmath11 of space and is given by @xmath68 for @xmath69 , @xmath70 for @xmath1 and @xmath71 const for @xmath0 .",
    "this scaling function has recently been revisited in refs .",
    "@xcite , with particular attention to the case @xmath1  @xcite .    from the above arguments , and for @xmath72 , the parametric plot of @xmath73 versus @xmath74 consists of an initial equilibrium part followed by an essentially horizontal section .",
    "in the latter the correlation function decays due to interface motion , while the response function hardly changes because any contribution from the interfaces is suppressed by the @xmath75 prefactor .",
    "if a limiting fdr , @xmath76 , is defined through @xmath77 then it follows that @xmath78 for @xmath72 in coarsening processes . for @xmath0 ,",
    "on the other hand , both @xmath79 and @xmath80 are scaling functions of @xmath81 and the parametric plot assumes no simple shape , implying that @xmath76 could be any finite number .",
    "this is confirmed by the analytical solution of the dynamics of the ising chain at @xmath82 which shows that @xmath83  @xcite .",
    "the factor @xmath84 was first derived in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the non - trivial value of @xmath76 for the ising chain was interpreted using the fact that in @xmath0 , the ordering temperature @xmath82 coincides with the critical point , @xmath12  @xcite .",
    "it was then suggested that a non - trivial @xmath76 could be a generic feature of critical points  @xcite .",
    "this is physically reasonable , since the whole argument for @xmath78 in coarsening processes relies on the separation between bulk and interfaces ; this is no longer valid at the critical point where the bulk has the well - known self - similar structure of ferromagnets at criticality .    from analytical and numerical studies ,",
    "the behavior of two - time single - spin dynamical quantities is again well understood , as briefly reviewed in ref .",
    "physically , the non - equilibrium dynamics following a quench to the critical point consists in the growth of the dynamical correlation length , @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is the dynamical critical exponent  @xcite .",
    "critical fluctuations of large wavevectors , @xmath87 , are almost equilibrated , while those with small wavevectors , @xmath88 , still retain their non - equilibrium initial condition .",
    "this separation leads to the scaling forms @xmath89 and @xmath90 , where @xmath91 and @xmath92 are the standard critical exponents .",
    "this can be interpreted as follows . for short time differences @xmath93 , equilibrated fluctuations with large @xmath94",
    "dominate and dynamical functions assume their standard equilibrium power - law decay .",
    "the dynamics at large time separation @xmath57 , on the other hand , is dominated by the growth of the dynamic correlation length and leads to the @xmath95 scaling . this in turn implies that , beyond the initial equilibrium part , the fd plot will again assume a non - trivial shape , as in the ising chain .",
    "the striking similarity of these results with the aging dynamics of finite dimensional spin glasses was noted in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the reasoning above confirms that at criticality @xmath76 can take any finite value , in contrast with the @xmath96 obtained in the low temperature phase .",
    "it was further argued that @xmath76 should be a new universal quantity at criticality  @xcite . as such",
    ", it can be computed using standard renormalization group procedures , and this program has recently been started for various models  @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath76 is known exactly for the ising chain  @xcite , where @xmath97 , for the spherical ferromagnetic model  @xcite , where @xmath97 for @xmath98 and @xmath99 for @xmath100 , and for the gaussian model  @xcite where @xmath97 .",
    "an estimate is known for model a at second order in @xmath101  @xcite , to first order in @xmath102 for the diluted ising model  @xcite , and to first order in @xmath101 in model c  @xcite .",
    "this short review of known results in the non - equilibrium dynamics of pure ferromagnets shows that much research has been done on the subject .",
    "so , why another paper ?",
    "first of all , the relevance of the notion of an effective temperature at criticality can be questioned because the fd plots for the spin dynamic functions do not assume a simple linear shape with a well - defined slope , as happens in the low temperature phase .",
    "this is related to the fact that at low temperatures the decay of correlation functions occurs on two well - separated time scales .",
    "each has its own associated effective temperature , a fact reminiscent of the physics of structural glasses . at criticality , on the other hand , one has a continuum of time scales associated with different wavevectors , @xmath103 . moreover",
    ", for finite @xmath94 the equilibration time is finite , meaning that the number of modes that are still out of equilibrium decreases as time increases .",
    "this suggests that an effective temperature could be relevant only when considering the @xmath104 limit , a point which our analysis will clarify .",
    "second , we mentioned the important issue of the observable - dependence of a generalized fdt .",
    "this issue remains completely open since the studies cited above focused exclusively on a single fd relation , for the spin autocorrelation and associated response . in order to get a more complete theoretical understanding it is crucial to understand if other observables give the same results , and if not , how they are related .",
    "a third motivation for the study of higher order correlation functions comes from the observation that the dynamics of coarsening models is dominated by the motion of topological defects . for ising models ,",
    "these are domain walls , the local density of which is given by the ` defect ' observable @xmath105 , where @xmath106 are nearest neighbors .",
    "defect dynamical functions have recently been studied in the context of kinetically constrained ising models  @xcite , and the fd relations that arose showed interesting and unexpected features .    for an ising model , there are at least four ` natural ' fd relations , involving respectively the spin autocorrelation , @xmath107 , the magnetization density @xmath108 correlation , @xmath109 , the defect autocorrelation , @xmath110 with @xmath106 nearest neighbors , and the energy density @xmath111 correlation , @xmath112 .",
    "note again that connected and disconnected correlation functions coincide for the magnetization ; this is not the case for @xmath113 and @xmath114 . in the @xmath115 case",
    ", we will also investigate two - time functions which smoothly interpolate between incoherent , local functions ( spin or defect ) and coherent , global ones ( magnetization , energy ) , and discuss the case of correlation functions of higher order .",
    "in the 2@xmath11 case , we will stick to the four quantities listed above .",
    "in this section we study the non - equilibrium dynamics in the glauber - ising chain with hamiltonian @xmath117 where the @xmath118 ( @xmath119 ) are @xmath120 ising spins subject to periodic boundary conditions .",
    "glauber dynamics consists in each spin @xmath118 flipping with rate @xmath121 $ ] , where @xmath122 .",
    "we focus on the evolution of arbitrary two - time spin and defect correlation and response functions in the thermodynamic limit @xmath123 , after a quench from equilibrium at @xmath124 to @xmath125 . as explained above ,",
