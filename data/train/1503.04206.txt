    "the advent of bolometric detectors with background - limited sensitivity has important implications for astronomical instrumentation at millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths .",
    "once the detector phonon noise falls below the background from photon statistical fluctuations , further sensitivity gains can only be realized by collecting additional photons . a common implementation increases the effective detecting area through an array of individual sensors ,",
    "each coupled to the sky through an optical structure ( feed horn , lenslet , phased antenna array ) that restricts the system response to a single electromagnetic mode at the sensor .",
    "single - moded systems achieve diffraction - limited angular resolution with well - defined ( gaussian ) beam profiles , but the large number of sensors required drives system - level complexity and cost .    an alternative design uses a much smaller number of detectors capable of sensing multiple modes of the incident field .",
    "a multi - moded system uses non - imaging optics ( a `` light bucket '' or similar feed structure ) to fix the beam size independent of wavelength .",
    "since the lagrange invariant is conserved , in order for the beam size to remain constant the number of modes must scale with wavelength , @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the detector area , @xmath4 is the solid angle , and @xmath5 is the observing wavelength .",
    "the different electromagnetic modes form an orthogonal basis set and add incoherently at the detector . the number of detectors required to reach a given sensitivity thus scales with etendu as @xmath6 , inversely proportional to the number of modes .",
    "multi - moded systems can be particularly useful for observations of the linear polarization of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , where the signals of interest lie well below the photon background noise .",
    "polarimetry adds an additional level of complexity to the optical system .",
    "multi - moded systems typically require a concentrator or similar feed structure to couple light from the sky to the detector while conserving etendu .",
    "polarization sensitivity can be achieved using a detector sensitive to both polarizations , with a polarization diplexer ( _ e.g. _ a wire grid analyzer ) upstream of the detector .",
    "since the polarization separation occurs before light enters the concentrator , the polarization properties of the concentrator do not matter .",
    "alternatively , the detector itself may be sensitive to a single linear polarization .",
    "this avoids the need for a separate polarization diplexer , but requires the concentrator to preserve the incident polarization state without cross - polar mixing ( see , _ e.g. _ , the discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "instruments in this latter class include the planned pixie @xcite , muse @xcite and lspe @xcite missions .",
    "the design of non - imaging concentrators has been well studied for unpolarized observations @xcite .",
    "three - dimensional concentrators formed as a surface of revolution can approach the theoretical limit on concentration , but the resulting azimuthal symmetry induces an undesirable cross - polar response . in this paper",
    ", we describe the design and performance of a non - imaging concentrator using a rectangular geometry suitable for cmb polarimetry .",
    "figure [ feed_schematic ] illustrates the concentrator , derived from the requirements of the pixie instrument .",
    "we define a right - handed coordinate system @xmath7 $ ] with the detector centered in the @xmath8 plane and the concentrator extending in the @xmath9 direction .",
    "light from the @xmath0 beam - forming optics is incident on the concentrator at a 15  angle from the @xmath10 axis . within these constraints",
    ", we use a rectangular geometry for the concentrator to minimize cross - polar mixing of the incident light .",
    "each of the 4 walls of the concentrator is an elliptical section , optimized from an iterative ray - tracing algorithm to maximize the total throughput in the geometric optics limit .",
    "we define the ellipse in each plane as a quadratic equation    @xmath11    for the top , bottom , and side faces , respectively .",
    "table 1 lists the coefficient values @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the two side panels ( @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) are identical , while the top and bottom panels ( @xmath16 and @xmath17 ) have different elliptical sections to accommodate the off - axis design .",
    "the projected entrance aperture thus appears approximately square .",

    "each detector covers the full aperture ; they are mounted one behind the other so that both are fully illuminated .",
    "the two detectors are rotated by 90  such that one detector is sensitive to polarization in the @xmath23 direction and the other is sensitive to polarization in the @xmath24 direction .",
    "each detector has etendu @xmath25 @xmath26 sr .",
    "we model the co - polar and cross - polar response of the concentrator using a time - reversed monte carlo approach . for each linear polarization",
    ", we generate a set of 63 million outgoing rays , each originating from a random position on the detector .",
    "the ray angular distribution is uniform in azimuth , but takes into account the additional @xmath27 angular response of a thin resistive detector at the concentrator exit aperture@xcite .",
    "the distribution in polarization is uniform .",
    "a ray - tracing algorithm follows each ray through multiple bounces within the concentrator ( assumed to be perfectly reflective ) to determine the orientation and polarization angle after leaving the concentrator .",
    "the pixie concentrator does not view the sky directly , instead coupling to the beam - forming optics through an @xmath0 coupling mirror .",
    "we extend the ray - tracing algorithm to follow each ray out of the concentrator and and through one reflection from the coupling mirror .",
    "the resulting set of rays approximates the beam pattern of the concentrator / coupling mirror combination , which can then be used as input through the remaining optical system . the co - polar and cross - polar response of any downstream beam - forming optics",
    "can readily be calculated , and and not treated here .",
    "observations of the cosmic microwave background can span more than a decade in frequency , from 30 ghz to 600 ghz .",
    "the corresponding number of modes within the concentrator ranges from @xmath28 at the lowest frequency to @xmath29 at the highest frequency .",
    "the concentrator thus samples the transition from a few - mode system to a highly over - moded system .",
    "several authors have discussed methods to estimate the beam pattern for non - imaging concentrators in the few - mode limit @xcite .",
    "typically these methods require explicit mode matching .",
    "although mode matching successfully recovers the full phase and amplitude information needed to generate far - field beam patterns , this method is computationally expensive and is difficult to apply for off - axis geometries where a full 3-dimensional treatment is required . to compare the modeled beam patterns to measurement",
    ", we employ a simpler approximation .",
    "we use the beam pattern from the ray - tracing algorithm to model the beam in the geometric optics limit .",
    "we then mathematically expand the beam using an orthogonal set of basis functions , and recompute the beam using a truncated subset of these functions to account for mode loss at low frequencies .",
    "the rectangular symmetry of the concentrator is well matched to the orthogonal basis functions of a two - dimensional fourier transform .",
    "we thus bin the co - polar or cross - polar beam derived from the geometric optics model on a @xmath30 grid , and fourier transform the binned beam map to derive a set of complex fourier coefficients .",
    "we sort the coefficients by angular frequency and retain only the lowest @xmath31 values , setting the remaining modes to zero .",
    "we then fourier transform back to real space to generate a model with the desired number of modes .",
    "finally , we convolve the mode - truncated pattern with the airy pattern for the appropriate observing frequency to approximate the effects of diffraction at the concentrator walls .",
    "we measured the co - polar and cross - polar beam patterns of the rectangular concentrator in the goddard electromagnetic anechoic chamber ( gemac ) .",
    "figure [ gemac_fig ] shows the experimental setup .",
    "a transmitter within the gemac uses a standard rectangular gain feed to launch a single linear polarization toward a shaped reflector .",
    "the reflector transforms the outgoing signal to a plane wave , effectively placing the transmitter at infinity .",
    "we include a coupling mirror in the gemac setup to convert the transmitted plane wave to the @xmath0 beam generated by the pixie coupling mirror , and measure the copolar and cross - polar beams from the concentrator / mirror system .",
    "the gemac coupling mirror differs from the pixie mirror in that the pixie mirror uses an elliptical surface to focus on the next mirror in the instrument while the gemac coupling mirror uses a parabolic surface to focus on the transmitter at infinity .",
    "since the gemac setup excludes the remainder of the beam - forming optics , the measured beam patterns represent only the concentrator / coupling mirror combination and are not a measure of the final instrument beams on the sky .",
    "the concentrator / mirror system is mounted on a table and can be moved in azimuth and elevation . figure [ coord_figure ] show the relative orientation of the table and concentrator coordinate systems . viewed from the detector in the concentrator @xmath8 plane , moving the table towards positive azimuth",
    "moves a source at infinity toward positive @xmath23 ( as viewed through the coupling mirror ) .",
    "similarly , moving the table towards positive elevation moves a source at infinity toward positive @xmath24 . to suppress reflected signals ,",
    "all surfaces except the coupling mirror and concentrator aperture were covered with a single layer of eccosorb an72 microwave absorber .",
    "the absorber at the edges of the coupling mirror acts as a beam stop , truncating the corners to produce the desired tophat geometry .",
    "we modulate the transmitted power by electronically switching the transmitted power with a square wave at 20 hz , and use a thomas keating thz absolute power meter @xcite at the exit aperture of the concentrator to detect and synchronously demodulate the signal .",
    "the power meter is insensitive to polarization ; a free - standing wire grid polarizer mounted between the power meter and the concentrator exit aperture provides polarization sensitivity .",
    "the polarizer is flush to the concentrator exit aperture while the power meter is parallel to the exit aperture but 3 mm further back within a reflective integrating cavity .",
    "the wire grid polarizer consists of copper - clad tungsten wires 40 microns in diameter ( 36 @xmath32 m tungsten and 1.32.5 @xmath32 m copper ) on a 118 @xmath32 m pitch . with the grid wires oriented parallel to the elevation direction ,",
    "the @xmath24 polarization is reflected and the power meter is sensitive to @xmath23 polarization .",
    "the grid can be rotated by 90  so that the wires are parallel to the azimuth direction . in this orientation ,",
    "the @xmath23 polarization is reflected and the power meter is sensitive to @xmath24 polarization . the measured polarization isolation is better than -27 db at frequencies 10 ghz to 300 ghz .",
    "several improvements are possible .",
    "the design process restricted the figure for each wall of the concentrator to remain an ellipse , while varying the three foci to optimize the total throughput ( co - polar and cross - polar ) .",
    "a more ambitious design could add additional free parameters to the figure for each wall , changing the simple ellipse to ( e.g. ) a low - order polynomial .",
    "similarly , the concentrator could be optimized to maximize the co - polar throughput while simultaneously minimizing the cross - polar response .",
    "we have not yet attempted such improvements .",
    "we measured the co - polar and cross - polar beam patterns for an optical system consisting of the concentrator plus a coupling mirror .",
    "the results are thus representative of the beam patterns expected at output of the pixie instrument and do _ not _ represent the pixie beams on the sky .",
    "the full pixie optical system includes additional beam - forming mirrors to reduce the tophat diameter to the design value 2.6@xcite .",
    "the beam - forming optics are optimized to further symmetrize the beam patterns .",
