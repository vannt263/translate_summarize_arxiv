    "radial velocity surveys of nearby stars have produced spectacular discoveries of extra - solar planets over the past two decades ( see marcy , cochran & mayor 2000 ) . as these searches continue into the next decade , they will be supplemented by high angular resolution searches for the astrometric signatures of planetary orbits ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "while radial velocity ( rv ) technique works by detecting the reflex acceleration of the star due to the orbital motion of the companion , astrometric technique detects the apparent reflex motion of the star on the sky . in a previous paper ( *",
    "* hereafter ek2001 ) , we examined the rv technique in detail , paying particular attention to the regime where the time - baseline of the observations is shorter than the orbital period of the planet .",
    "this regime is interesting because while the longest baseline of current rv surveys is @xmath0 years , one expects giant planets to form in the colder regions of the proto - planetary nebula , and thus we expect such objects to possess periods of many years to centuries @xcite .",
    "while rv technique is most sensitive to short - period , close - in planets , astrometric technique obtains optimal sensitivity to long - period massive planets expected from current theories .",
    "moreover , in ek2001 , we demonstrated that one can achieve a significant improvement in sensitivity ( over current methods ) if the orbital amplitude _ and phase _ are included in the analysis .    in this paper",
    ", we develop an analytical understanding of the sensitivity of astrometric technique in this so - called `` long - period regime '' , and address the issues of detection and detection efficiency .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , the last authors who dealt with the sensitivity of the astrometric method were black & scargle ( 1982 ) , who used a periodogram approach @xcite .",
    "as in ek2001 , we will argue below that a least - squares approach is preferable to the periodogram .",
    "essentially , the least - squares approach ( in contrast to the periodogram method ) offers the most general approach , and requires no modification in the long - period regime .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows .",
    "first , we address the case of edge - on orbits in  [ sec : edge ] . in ",
    "[ sec : basic ] , we summarize the basic equations and describe the least - squares approach in  [ sec : lsq ] . in  [ sec : typei ] we provide analytical estimates for obtaining a detection in the absence of any signal , and in  [ sec : typeii ] we obtain estimates for minimum detectable signals in the presence of noise .",
    "we repeat this analysis for the case of face - on orbits in  [ sec : face ] and for orbits with general inclination angles in  [ sec:45 ] .",
    "we conclude in  [ sec : concls ] .",
    "we will assume circular orbits throughout this discussion , and we will neglect the effect of annual parallax .",
    "the astrometric signature of an edge - on circular orbit is given by @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the time ; @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the proper motion and position offset of the planetary system , respectively ; and @xmath5 here , @xmath6 is the distance to the system , @xmath7 is the mass of the star , and @xmath8 is the mass of the planet .",
    "thus , we can express the sensitivity ( defined as the minimum - mass planet that can be detected ) of the astrometric technique in terms of the amplitude of the astrometric orbital signature : @xmath9 however , it is more difficult to identify planets with long periods than equation [ eq : sensitivity ] might suggest . in the so - called `` long - period regime '' , the total baseline of the observations is less than the orbital period of the planet , and thus we only observe some fraction of the full orbital amplitude .",
    "thus the sensitivity is expected to critically depend on the orbital phase . as we will show explicitly below , astrometric technique ( applied to an edge - on orbit ) will be the most sensitive when the orbital curvature is maximal ( i.e. @xmath10 \\pi$ ] ) .",
    "in contrast , when the orbital phase is close to @xmath11 ( i.e. a pure sine wave ) , the lack of orbital curvature makes it difficult to distinguish the signal from the unknown proper motion of the system .      the signal analysis for the astrometric technique",
    "consists of fitting the observations to the model specified in equation [ eq : astrom - orbit ] . as noted by several authors ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) the most optimal fitting is obtained by using the technique of least - squares .",
    "first , we derive a linear model equation from equation [ eq : astrom - orbit ] : @xmath12 here , @xmath13 , @xmath14 . black & scargle ( 1982 ) estimated @xmath4 and @xmath3 first and then applied periodogram analysis to the residual data ( i.e. with contributions from @xmath4 and @xmath3 subtracted ) .",
    "however , as discussed in ek2001 , it is necessary to determine all of the parameters simultaneously , especially in the long - period regime .    using equation [ eq : lsq - model1 ] as our physical model , we perform the following analysis to search for a signal in a data set",
    ". the parameters of the data set are as follows : the duration of the survey is @xmath15 , @xmath16 is the measured astrometric offset at epoch @xmath17 , and @xmath18 is the number of measured epochs . with no loss of generality ,",
    "we let the time go from @xmath19 to @xmath20 . to find the four unknowns , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 , we minimize @xmath23 ^ 2 \\label{eq : x2}\\ ] ] with respect to @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 . here , @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the orbital period .",
    "this yields a matrix equation for the four unknowns , which must be solved numerically in the general case .",
    "however , in the short - period regime where we observe many orbital cycles , many of the summations will average to zero , and this matrix equation will become approximately diagonal . in this case ,",
    "the fit parameters are given by @xmath26 @xmath27 @xmath28 @xmath29      type i errors describe the probability that a high amplitude will be obtained even when no signal is present in the data .",
    "we assess the statistics of type i errors , assuming that our data set consists of gaussian noise with a mean of zero and a standard deviation of @xmath30 .      from equations [ eq : ac - short][eq : mu - short ] , we see that @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 are sums of gaussian variables , and thus by the gaussian addition theorem , the four derived parameters must also be gaussian . specifically , @xmath21 and @xmath22 obey a gaussian distribution with a mean of zero and a variance of @xmath31 where @xmath18 is the number of measurements . denoting by @xmath32 the value of @xmath33 ( or @xmath34 ) that is exceeded in 1% of cases , we note that @xmath35    from equation [ eq : mu - short ] , we see that @xmath4 obeys a gaussian distribution with zero mean and a variance of @xmath36 . denoting by @xmath37 the value of @xmath38 that is exceeded in 1% of cases , @xmath39    since the statistics of @xmath3 are somewhat more complicated , we will infer the approximate value of @xmath40 from the value of @xmath37 : @xmath41      in this regime , the analytical expressions for @xmath21,@xmath22 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 that we derived above no longer hold , and so we resort to simulations . to this end",
    "we create a synthetic data set consisting of gaussian noise with @xmath30 = 100 @xmath4as ( we simulate this measurement accuracy because future instruments such as fame and keck interferometer will probably attain similar accuracies ; horner et al .",
    "1999 ; van belle et al . 1998 ) .",
    "we sample the synthetic data at one month intervals for @xmath42 years .",
    "we explore orbital periods from 5 years to 100 years , choosing the interval between sampled periods so as to result in a one radian decrease in the total number of orbital cycles over the length of the observations , @xmath43 for each period , @xmath25 , we simulate @xmath44 data sets and carry out the least - squares fit .",
    "we set @xmath45 equal to the 10@xmath46 highest value that arises .",
    "clearly , 99% of fitted @xmath21 will lie below this value . using the same method",
    ", we also determine the 99% confidence level for the other fitted parameters , which we denote by @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 .",
    "we find that the values of the fitted parameters are in excellent agreement with the values predicted by equations [ eq : ac - short][eq : mu - short ] in the short - period regime ( figure [ fig : params - tau ] ) . in order to understand the behaviors of the fitted parameters in the long - period regime , we begin by examining how the covariance of the fitted parameters depends on period .",
    "we expect that in the short - period regime , all four parameters will be completely uncorrelated , since we observe many orbital periods and can thus easily distinguish the sinusoidal motion from the linear proper motion term and the constant offset term .",
    "this expectation is verified by the simulations ( figure [ fig : params - corr ] ) .    in the long - period regime , in contrast , strong correlations may arise between the fitted parameters . from figure",
    "[ fig : params - corr ] , we conclude the following for the long - period regime :    \\1 . @xmath21 and @xmath22 are correlated , and select orbital phases close to 0@xmath50 .",
    "\\2 . @xmath21 and @xmath4 are anticorrelated .",
    "\\3 . @xmath22 and @xmath3 are anticorrelated .",
    "\\4 . @xmath21 and @xmath3 are uncorrelated ( not shown in figure ) .",
    "\\5 . @xmath22 and @xmath4 are uncorrelated ( not shown in figure ) .",
    "previous authors noted that these correlations would arise , and that the orbital phase would become important in the long - period regime @xcite .",
    "however , neither they nor others have explored the full - implications of this fact .",
    "below , we look into this issue in more detail , and develop an analytical understanding of how the fitted parameters depend upon orbital period .    we now provide a physical explanation of the results displayed in figure [ fig : params - corr ] .",
    "when @xmath51 , sinusoids with random phase can be fit to gaussian data , where the amplitude of the sinusoids is constrained by the vertical scale of the data ( @xmath52 ) . however , when @xmath53 , this is no longer necessarily the case .",
    "the maximum amplitude is obtained when a sine wave centered around @xmath54 is fitted .",
    "this is because for @xmath53 , @xmath55 , which can be completely absorbed into the linear proper motion term .",
    "specifically , the maximum amplitude of the sine wave that can be fitted is limited by how much @xmath56 deviates from a straight line in the range from @xmath57 $ ] .",
    "this deviation is given by @xmath58 we note that the maximal deviation occurs when @xmath59 , and thus the long - period regime `` begins '' where @xmath60 .",
    "the largest possible amplitude of the fitted sine wave ( @xmath22 ) in the long - period regime is that for which this deviation is approximately equal to the vertical scale of the noise ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "since equation [ eq : sin - dev ] tells us the fractional observed amplitude , the real amplitude of the fitted sine is @xmath61}{\\pi t_0 / \\tau - \\sin\\left(\\pi t_0/ \\tau\\right)}. \\label{eq : as}\\ ] ] here , @xmath47 is the value of @xmath34 that is exceeded in 1% of least - squares fits to gaussian noise , @xmath32 is the corresponding value of @xmath47 in the short - period regime ( equation [ eq : a1s ] ) , and the specific normalization is chosen so that at the boundary of the short and long - period regimes ( @xmath62 ) , @xmath47 is continuous",
    ".    we can understand the behavior of @xmath21 in the long - period regime using a similar analysis .",
    "specifically , the maximum amplitude of a cosine wave centered around @xmath54 is constrained by how much this cosine deviates from a constant in the interval @xmath63 $ ] .",
    "following the same lines as the analysis for @xmath22 , we find that this amplitude is given by @xmath64 here , @xmath45 is the value of @xmath33 that is exceeded in 1% of least - squares fits to gaussian noise , @xmath32 is the corresponding value of @xmath45 in the short - period regime ( equation [ eq : a1s ] ) , and 2 is a normalization factor ( chosen to enforce continuity between the short and long - period regimes ) .",
    "we note that in the long - period regime @xmath65 faster than @xmath66 , and thus the covariance of the sinusoidal signal with the constant offset term is less significant than the covariance with the proper motion term .    in light of these analytical expressions for @xmath21 and @xmath22 , it is not difficult to find expressions for @xmath3 and @xmath4 . in particular , because the input data consists of gaussian noise with a mean of zero , we know that @xmath3 and @xmath4 must be chosen so that the resultant fit is also , in the mean , zero .",
    "the anti - correlation of @xmath21 and @xmath4 and that of @xmath22 and @xmath3 confirm this expectation .    we must choose a @xmath3 that `` cancels '' the fitted sine - wave component . in the long - period regime",
    ", this condition can be expressed as @xmath67 , or @xmath68 . however , because the data has some vertical scale , we must vertically `` re - center '' the data after subtracting @xmath69 . since the total vertical scale is @xmath70 , we must add @xmath30 after subtracting @xmath69 .",
    "thus , we expect that for @xmath59 , @xmath71    similarly , @xmath4 is chosen to `` cancel '' the cosine component .",
    "thus , @xmath4 is the negative cosine component ( given by @xmath21 ) plus @xmath30 ( where @xmath30 is needed to reproduce the data , which is vertically centered around 0 ) .",
    "thus , for @xmath72 , @xmath73 .",
    "\\label{eq : mu}\\ ] ]    equipped with the behaviors of @xmath45 and @xmath47 , we now know the analytical behavior of the type i errors in the long - period regime .",
    "specifically , the error ellipse within which 99% of fitted signals lie , @xmath74 , is completely described : @xmath47 gives the semi - major axis , and @xmath45 gives the semi - minor axis .",
    "* amplitude  phase analysis . *",
    "the standard signal analysis usually focuses on the statistics of the orbital amplitude @xmath75 .",
    "this is adequate when @xmath21 and @xmath22 are uncorrelated ( e.g. in the short - period regime with adequate sampling ) .",
    "however , as can be seen in figure [ fig : params - corr ] , the @xmath21@xmath22 distribution becomes highly elliptical in the long - period regime .",
    "thus in this regime it pays to undertake an analysis that utilizes amplitude and phase .",
    "the fact that the amplitude - phase ellipse ( figure [ fig : params - corr ] ) is significantly smaller than the amplitude - only circle in the long - period regime clearly indicates the superiority of an amplitude - phase approach .",
    "therefore , we will use an amplitude - phase approach in the remainder of this discussion . see ek2001 for a more detailed comparison of amplitude - only and amplitude - phase approaches .      in  [ sec :",
    "typei ] , we computed the probability of detecting an apparent signal generated purely by noise ( i.e. type i probabilities ) .",
    "we now consider type ii probabilities the probability of failing to detect a genuine signal due to contamination by noise . to this end",
    ", we simulate a data set that consists of signal and noise : @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the amplitude of the signal , @xmath78 is the phase , and @xmath79 is the gaussian noise .",
    "we let @xmath78 be drawn from a uniform distribution in the interval @xmath80 $ ] , an appropriate assumption for circular orbits .",
    "we choose an initial signal amplitude of @xmath81 , and then do @xmath44 least - squares fits ( with the same parameters as in  [ sec : typei ] ) .",
    "in  [ sec : typei ] , we showed that in the long - period regime , the @xmath21@xmath22 distribution is elliptical . in view of this",
    ", we define the type i errors by an ellipse @xmath74 ; this ellipse contains 99% of the zero - signal simulations (  [ sec : ti - long ] ) . in our analysis of type ii probabilities",
    ", we consider all least - squares fits ( of the signal specified in equation [ eq : signal ] to the model specified by equation [ eq : lsq - model1 ] ) that lie within @xmath74 to be indistinguishable from those produced by noise .",
    "we increment the input signal amplitude until a certain fraction of fitted points lie outside of @xmath74 .",
    "for example , the signal amplitude at which 99% of fitted points lie outside of @xmath74 is denoted by @xmath82 .",
    "plots of @xmath82 , @xmath83 , and @xmath84 ( as a function of orbital period ) are shown in figure [ fig : edge - k99 ] .",
    "in the case of face - on orbits , we have twice as many measurements as in the edge - on case , since there are two orbital dimensions .",
    "thus , our model will contain both the @xmath85 and @xmath86 motion of the orbit : @xmath87 @xmath88 as above , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 $ ] is the proper motion , and @xmath92 $ ] is the position offset .    using the same parameters as in  [ sec : lsq ] , we determine the unknown model parameters by minimizing @xmath93 ^ 2 + \\ ] ] @xmath94 ^ 2\\ } \\label{eq : x2-face}\\ ] ] with respect to @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 , and @xmath98 .",
    "because a face - on orbit has two observable dimensions , the analysis of type i errors will be somewhat more complicated than for the face - on case . first , we note that in the short - period regime where @xmath99 , the least squares fit essentially has twice as many measurements to work with .",
    "thus , we expect that @xmath32 will be @xmath100 times its value for the edge - on case : @xmath101 however , since @xmath102 and @xmath103 must be determined for each orbital dimension independently , @xmath37 and @xmath40 will still be given by equations [ eq : mu1s ] and [ eq : lambda1s ] .",
    "when @xmath104 , the full amplitude of a cosine centered around @xmath54 can not be observed . however , in the case of face - on orbits , we can observe the full amplitude of the orbit in the orthogonal direction , since it is phase - shifted by 90@xmath50 . the full amplitude of this sine wave can be observed until @xmath105 ( to see this , find the value of @xmath25 for which @xmath106 ) .    for face - on orbits ,",
    "the long - period regime begins when @xmath105 , since it is here that the full amplitude of a sinusoid can not be observed in either orbital dimension .",
    "moreover , since the two dimensions are phase - shifted by @xmath107 , we expect the expressions for @xmath45 and @xmath47 to be the same .",
    "since @xmath65 faster than @xmath66 , the deviation of a cosine wave from unity will be the important constraint on the possible fitted amplitude .",
    "thus , @xmath45 and @xmath47 are both given by equation [ eq : ac ] in the long - period regime .",
    "a potential complication is that at some point , we are gaining virtually no new information from one of the orbital dimensions ( since the constraint on the size of a cosine is so much stronger than that on the size of a sine wave ) .",
    "so , we expect that at some period , our sensitivity will drop roughly by a factor of @xmath108 , to reflect the fact that half of the measurements become useless .",
    "we model this behavior as follows : @xmath109 as illustrated by figure [ fig : params - tau - face ] , this function is a good fit to the simulations .",
    "since @xmath47 now depends on the maximum amplitude of a cosine wave , rather than the amplitude of a sine wave , we must modify our expression for @xmath110 accordingly . specifically , while the slope of a sine wave centered around @xmath54 goes approximately as @xmath111 , the slope of a cosine wave goes as @xmath112 .",
    "thus , we expect that the expression for @xmath110 in the case of face - on orbits will differ from that for edge - on orbits by a factor of @xmath113 .",
    "specifically , we find that for @xmath53 , @xmath114 this analytic function is shown along with the simulated data in figure [ fig : params - tau - face ] .",
    "we expect that @xmath49 will be the exactly the same as in the case of edge - on orbits , since the behavior of @xmath45 is unchanged .",
    "this expectation is confirmed by figure [ fig : params - tau - face ] .    from these analytic expressions for @xmath21 and @xmath22 , we see that the sensitivity of astrometric technique to face - on orbits is significantly better than that for edge - on orbits .",
    "this is well illustrated through a comparison of figures [ fig : params - corr ] and [ fig : params - corr - face ] .",
    "as discussed above , the type i error ellipse , @xmath74 , is defined as the ellipse in the @xmath21@xmath22 plane for which 99% of fitted parameters lie inside . in the case of edge - on orbits ,",
    "this ellipse is very eccentric , since the semi - major axis is given by equation [ eq : as ] and the semi - minor axis is given by equation [ eq : ac ] ( figure [ fig : params - corr ] ) .",
    "in contrast , in the case of face - on orbits , @xmath74 is a circle whose radius is given by equation [ eq : ac - face ] .",
    "thus , for face - on orbits , we are equally sensitive to signals of arbitrary orbital phase .      as in  [ sec : typeii ] , we compute the probability that a real signal will not be detected due to contamination by noise . for a face - on orbit , we simulate the following data set : @xmath115 @xmath116 here , @xmath77 is the amplitude of the signal , @xmath78 is the ( randomly - distributed ) orbital phase , and @xmath79 is the gaussian noise .",
    "since the sensitivity of astrometric technique to face - on orbits is better than for edge - on orbits by a factor of @xmath108 ( in the short - period regime ) , we choose an initial signal amplitude of @xmath117 .",
    "we then do @xmath118 least - squares fits , with the same parameters as in ",
    "[ sec : ti - face ] .",
    "following our analysis of type ii errors in  [ sec : typeii ] , we consider all least - squares fits ( of the signal specified in equations [ eq : face - sigx ] and [ eq : face - sigy ] to the model given by equations [ eq : lsq - modelx ] and [ eq : lsq - modely ] ) that lie within @xmath74 to be indistinguishable from noise . the results of this analysis show that the sensitivity of the astrometric technique is much better for face - on orbits than for edge - on orbits ( figure [ fig : k99-face ] ) .",
    "in the case of generally inclined orbits , we observe the full amplitude in one orbital dimension , but only @xmath119 in the other dimension ( where @xmath120 is the orbital inclination angle ) .",
    "labeling the dimension in which we measure the full amplitude by @xmath85 , our model becomes @xmath121 @xmath122 as above , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath123 is the proper motion , and @xmath124 is the position offset .    using the same parameters for our data set as in  [ sec : lsq ] , we determine the unknown model parameters by minimizing @xmath125 ^ 2 + \\ ] ] @xmath126 ^ 2\\ } \\label{eq : x2 - 45}\\ ] ] with respect to @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 , and @xmath98 .      in the short - period regime where @xmath99 , the least squares fit essentially has twice as many measurements with which to work , although half of the measurements are less sensitive .",
    "thus , we expect that type i errors will be somewhere between those for the edge - on and face - on cases .",
    "however , for simplicity , we will simply use the expressions from the face - on case .    as above , @xmath45 is given by equation [ eq : ac ] in the long - period regime , since we can always observe the full amplitude of a cosine wave in one orbital dimension .",
    "however , @xmath47 will be different than in the face - on case , since the cosine wave can not be measured as accurately in the other orbital dimension .",
    "thus , we expect that in the long - period regime , @xmath47 will be stretched relative to @xmath45 . for orbits with",
    "inclination angles close to zero , there is essentially no information from the second orbital dimension , and thus @xmath47 is given by equation [ eq : as ] .",
    "however , for inclination angles significantly greater than zero , the information from the second orbital dimension becomes important , and @xmath47 is limited by the lower - amplitude cosine wave in this second dimension .",
    "specifically , @xmath47 is @xmath45 stretched by @xmath127 .",
    "thus , we have an expression for the aspect ratio of @xmath74 as a function of inclination angle : @xmath128_{\\rm edge}\\right ) .",

    "analytic functions for the parameters are shown along with the simulated data in figure [ fig : params - tau-45 ] .",
    "as in  [ sec : typeii ] we compute the probability that a real signal will not be detected due to contamination by noise . for inclined orbits ,",
    "we simulate the following data set : @xmath132 @xmath133 here , @xmath77 is the amplitude of the signal , @xmath78 is the ( randomly - distributed ) orbital phase , and @xmath79 is the gaussian noise .",
    "we choose an initial signal amplitude , and do @xmath118 least - squares fits , with the same parameters as in  [ sec : tii - face ] .",
    "following our analysis of type ii errors in  [ sec : typeii ] , we consider all least - squares fits ( of the signal specified in equations [ eq : face - sigx-45 ] and [ eq : face - sigy-45 ] to the model given by equations [ eq : lsq - modelx-45 ] and [ eq : lsq - modely-45 ] ) that lie within @xmath74 to be indistinguishable from noise .",
    "the results of this analysis for a @xmath129inclined orbit are shown in figure [ fig : k99 - 45 ] .",
    "as in our earlier analysis of the sensitivity of the radial velocity technique ( ek2001 ) , the analysis presented here is based on frequentist statistics . however , the importance of the bayesian approach is gradually being recognized in astronomy .",
    "berger & delampady ( 1987 ) point out that the probability of extreme events predicted by the frequentist approach ( which is what we have essentially computed ) is rosier than is warranted .",
    "thus , given a mix of stars ( with and without planets ) , the frequentist tail criterion of say 1% ( e.g. @xmath74 ) is likely to underestimate the fraction of false detections that are expected to occur in population analyses .",
    "these criticisms notwithstanding , we have pursued the frequentist approach because of ( 1 ) its conceptual simplicity , ( 2 ) its ease of use , ( 3 ) our own familiarity , and ( 4 ) our lack of familiarity with the bayesian approach .",
    "we also acknowledge that out treatment of the statistics was not always completely rigorous .",
    "specifically , when one orbital dimension becomes much more sensitive than the other , we simply ignore the data from the other dimension .",
    "inclusion of this less sensitive dimension in the analysis is likely to lead to a small improvement in the overall sensitivity .",
    "we feel that this statistical analysis is beyond the scope of this paper , and will not lead to any meaningful modifications of the results derived above .",
    "a final caveat is that in this analysis , we have assumed that the orbital inclination angle is known _ a priori_. in general ,",
    "this is not the case , and the inclination angle must be determined simultaneously with the rest of the orbital parameters ( using a non - linear least - squares fitting method ) . while one expects that all of the sensitivities in this paper are slightly under - estimated as a result , it is clear that the qualitative behavior of the sensitivity in the long - period regime is unaffected .",
    "despite the fact that our analysis can be improved upon in some areas , this work provides an accurate analytic description of the sensitivity of the astrometric technique in detecting outer planets .",
    "moreover , we have understood , both qualitatively and quantitatively , how the sensitivity improves as the orbital inclination angle is increased .",
    "of specific importance is the fact that in the long - period regime the sensitivity of astrometric technique to face - on orbits is more that @xmath108 times better the sensitivity to edge - on orbits , due to the orthogonal information supplied by the two orbital dimensions .",

    "<S> with the advent of optical interferometers that will be coming online in the next decade , radial velocity searches for extra - solar planets will be complemented by high angular resolution astrometric measurements . in this paper , we explore the sensitivity of the astrometric technique , and develop an analytical understanding of the sensitivity in the regime where the orbital period is longer than the time - baseline of the survey . as in an earlier paper that dealt with the radial velocity technique , </S>",
    "<S> our analysis of the astrometric technique utilizes both the orbital amplitude and phase . </S>"
