    "the analysis of vector and axial - vector meson physics represents a nontrivial task from the theoretical point of view .",
    "this is basically due to the characteristic energy scales at which these particles manifest , namely an intermediate range between low energy hadron physics and the high energy region where qcd can be treated perturvatively . in order to deal with the subject ,",
    "one possible approach is to start from an effective meson lagrangian ; another possible way is to derive the corresponding effective interactions from qcd - inspired fermionic schemes .    in the last two decades ,",
    "the development of chiral effective models @xcite has provided a profitable framework to analyze various phenomena related to the physics of vector and axial - vector mesons @xcite .",
    "these models have been built taking into account the symmetries of qcd , together with the so  called axial anomaly introduced through the wess - zumino - witten ( wzw ) @xcite effective action . as an alternative approach , the analysis of spin one meson physics can be performed by starting with the lagrangian proposed by nambu and jona  lasinio ( njl ) @xcite .",
    "this lagrangian is based in 4-fermion interactions , showing the chiral symmetry of qcd , and leads to an effective theory for scalar , pseudoscalar , vector and axial  vector mesons after proper bosonization .",
    "the effective meson lagrangian can be obtained by constructing a generating functional , and evaluating the real and imaginary parts of the fermion determinant @xcite .    in this work",
    "we follow this second approach , studying the phenomenology of spin 1 mesons in the framework of the njl model .",
    "we propose a fermionic lagrangian that shows an approximate @xmath0 chiral symmetry , explicitly violated by current quark masses , as is the case of qcd in the limit of large number of colours @xmath1 .",
    "in particular , we revisit the predictions given by this model for anomalous radiative decays of vector mesons , taking into account the explicit breakdown of the @xmath2 flavour symmetry to @xmath3 isospin symmetry with the assumption @xmath4 .",
    "we perform the bosonization of the njl theory by carrying out an expansion of the fermion determinant in terms of the meson fields .",
    "this gives rise to a set of one  loop feynman diagrams @xcite from which one can derive the relevant effective meson interactions .",
    "taking into account present experimental data , we analyze possible input parameters for the model , in order to obtain an acceptable phenomenological pattern for the observed anomalous decays of pseudoscalar and vector mesons .    the paper is organized as follows : in sect .",
    "ii we introduce the njl lagrangian and the bosonization technique . in sect .",
    "iii we derive the effective lagrangian to account for vector and axial - vector meson interactions , considering the explicit breakdown of flavour @xmath2 symmetry .",
    "this leads to some relations between vector meson masses and decay constants that can be written in terms of symmetry breaking parameters .",
    "then , in sect .",
    "iv , we concentrate on the anomalous radiative decays of pseudoscalar and vector mesons , which proceed through the @xmath5 axial anomaly . in sect .  v we discuss the numerical results for the corresponding branching ratios , in comparison with the present experimental information . finally in sect .",
    "vi we present our conclusions .",
    "the appendix includes a brief description of the regularization scheme used throughout our analysis .",
    "chiral effective models have proved to reproduce the low energy hadron phenomena with significant success . for that reason ,",
    "a significant effort has been done in order to derive these effective schemes from a microscopic theory as qcd .",
    "the effective four fermion lagrangian proposed by nambu and jona ",
    "lasinio @xcite , which shows the chiral symmetry of qcd , represents one of the most popular ways to achieve this goal .",
    "the njl model provides , after proper bosonization , not only the expected effective couplings for scalar , pseudoscalar , vector and axial  vector mesons but also the wess  zumino  witten sector @xcite which accounts for the anomalous meson decays .",
    "the explicit form of the njl lagrangian reads @xmath6 \\nonumber \\\\ & & - 2 g_2 \\left [ ( \\bar q \\gamma^\\mu \\frac{1}{2}\\lambda^a q)^2 + ( \\bar q \\gamma^\\mu \\gamma_5\\frac{1}{2 } \\lambda^a q)^2 \\right ] , \\label{00}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 denotes the @xmath8-flavour quark spinor , @xmath9 , @xmath10 are the generators of the @xmath11 flavour group ( we normalize @xmath12 ) and @xmath13 stands for the current quark mass matrix , which explicitly breaks the chiral symmetry .",
    "the coupling constants @xmath14 and @xmath15 , as well as the quark masses , are introduced as free parameters of the model . in the absence of the mass term , the njl lagrangian shows at the quantum level the @xmath16 symmetry characteristic of massless qcd .",
    "it is possible to reduce the fermionic degrees of freedom to bosonic ones by standard bosonization techniques . with the introduction of colorless boson fields and an appropriate use of the stratonovich identity ,",
    "one obtains an effective action where the fermions couple to the bosons in a bilinear form .",
    "the couplings driven by @xmath14 in ( [ 00 ] ) lead to the introduction of scalar and pseudoscalar boson fields , whereas those carrying @xmath15 lead to the inclusion of vector and axial  vector mesons .    to be definite ,",
    "let us consider the vector meson sector with @xmath17 flavours , @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 . by means of the stratonovich identity , the vector ",
    "vector coupling in ( [ 00 ] ) can be transformed as @xmath21 where @xmath22 .",
    "the spin 1 fields @xmath23 can be identified with the usual nonet of vector mesons , @xmath24 which transform in such a way to preserve the chiral symmetry of the original njl lagrangian ( and therefore that of qcd ) . notice that the first term in the right hand side of eq.([masa ] ) is nothing but a mass term for the vector fields @xmath23 , thus the vector ",
    "meson masses are governed by the coupling @xmath15 in the njl lagrangian .",
    "it can be seen that these masses are degenerate in the limit where the quark masses are degenerate .    now , the quark fields can be integrated out , leading to an effective lagrangian which only contains bosonic degrees of freedom .",
    "this procedure can be carried out by taking into account the generating functional @xmath25 \\right\\ } \\label{genfunct}\\ ] ] and performing the calculation of the fermion determinant ( a detailed analysis can be found in @xcite ) .",
    "a similar procedure can be followed for the full njl lagrangian ( [ 00 ] ) , leading to the interactions involving scalar , pseudoscalar and axial ",
    "vector bosons . in this way",
    ", the final effective lagrangian is written only in terms of spin 0 and spin 1 colorless hadron fields .",
    "here we have performed the bosonization by carrying out an expansion of the fermion determinant , which gives rise to a set of one  loop feynman diagrams @xcite . in order to build up the final effective meson lagrangian ,",
    "we have obtained the local part of the relevant interactions by taking the leading order of a gradient expansion in powers of the external momenta , and considering the dominant contributions in @xmath26 .",
    "the divergent integrals have been treated using a proper  time regularization scheme with a momentum cut  off , keeping the leading contributions .",
    "the procedure is developed in detail in the next section .",
    "in this section we describe the effective meson interactions derived from the njl lagrangian .",
    "we begin by calculating the relevant one  loop self  energy diagrams contributing to the meson kinetic and mass terms , and those leading to the effective weak and strong meson decay couplings .",
    "notice that the meson fields introduced through the bosonization technique acquire their dynamics via the self ",
    "energy one  loop diagrams .    in our framework , the poles of the quark propagators occur at the so  called constituent masses , i.e.dynamically generated masses which arise as a consequence of the spontaneous breakdown of the chiral symmetry .",
    "the constituent masses appear as solutions of schwinger - dyson self - consistency equations ( gap equations ) , which are governed by the scalar coupling @xmath14 in the njl lagrangian ( [ 00 ] ) . here",
    "we will not concentrate in the scalar sector of the model , thus the constituent quark masses , as well as the pseudoscalar boson masses , will be considered as free parameters .",
    "our main interest is focused in the anomalous radiative decays of vector mesons .",
    "nevertheless , we need to consider also the axial  vector sector of the model , since the axial ",
    "vectors mix with the pseudoscalars at the one  loop level ( @xmath27 mixing ) .      the generating functional ( [ genfunct ] )",
    "gives rise to effective kinetic terms for the spin-1 vector mesons via one  loop diagrams , as shown in fig .",
    "the analysis in the case of the axial ",
    "vector mesons can be performed in an analogous way , with the additional ingredient of @xmath27 mixing given by fig .",
    "the loop in fig .",
    "1(a ) gives a contribution to the vector meson self - energy given by @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the constituent masses of the quarks entering the loop , @xmath1 is the number of colors , and the trace acts over the flavour and dirac indices .    as stated above",
    ", we will take only the leading order in the external momentum @xmath31 , which means to evaluate the integral at @xmath32 after extracting the relevant kinematical factors . in this case , this is equivalent to consider only the divergent piece of ( [ pimunu ] ) : @xmath33\\ , , \\label{pimunudiv}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 as it was previously mentioned , in order to regularize the divergence we use the proper  time regularization scheme @xcite with a cut  off @xmath35 , which will be treated as a free parameter of the model .",

    "the kinetic lagrangian in ( [ lkin ] ) has been expressed in terms of the vector fields in ( [ campos ] ) , with the additional rotation @xmath40 which diagonalizes the neutral sector .",
    "it is easy to see that here the rotation is `` ideal '' , i.e. , the spin 1 mass eigenstates @xmath41 and @xmath42 are composed by pure light @xmath18 and @xmath19 quarks , while the @xmath43 meson is a bound state @xmath44 .",
    "the @xmath45 rotation angle is given by @xmath46 .",
    "slight deviations from the ideal mixing condition will be considered below to allow for the decay @xmath47 observed recently .",
    "the mass terms for the vector mesons are given by the @xmath48 term in ( [ masa ] ) , plus a divergent one  loop contribution given by the second term in the square brackets in ( [ pimunudiv ] ) , which vanishes in the @xmath2 flavour limit .",

    "it is necessary to fix two more input parameters , which can be chosen as the decay constant @xmath161 ( or equivalently the pseudoscalar wave function renormalization @xmath162 ) and the @xmath163 mixing angle @xmath164 .",
    "the latter is related with @xmath124 by @xmath165 where @xmath166 is the `` ideal '' rotation angle introduced above .",
    "our numerical results are shown in table i , where we quote the values corresponding to four different sets for @xmath161 and @xmath164 , together with the present experimental widths @xcite . in order to get the theoretical results , we have used the physical values for the pseudoscalar and vector meson masses entering eq .",

    "we have chosen the values of @xmath161 and @xmath164 that lead to a better agreement for the whole set of decays , always having in mind that an intrinsic theoretical error of at least 15% can be expected from the njl scheme . in general , we find that the best results for @xmath164 lie within the usually expected range between @xmath167 and @xmath168 @xcite , while the model seems to prefer a rather large value for the ratio @xmath169 , higher than 3/2 .",
    "we quote for completeness the results corresponding to a ratio @xmath170 , favored by large-@xmath1 arguments @xcite , which leads in this case to too large widths for the decays involving @xmath74 and @xmath43 mesons .",
    "when varying @xmath161 and @xmath164 , and comparing with the experimental values , it is found that an accurate agreement for certain widths worsens the predictions in other cases . nevertheless , considering the relatively important intrinsic theoretical error of the model , it can be said that the values in table i show a phenomenologically acceptable pattern for the pseudoscalar and vector meson anomalous radiative decays .",

    "the departure of the effective couplings from the global @xmath2 flavour symmetry limit has been introduced through the parameters @xmath54 and @xmath56 , which correspond to properly regularized fermion loop integrals .    in order to perform the phenomenological analysis ,",
    "we have chosen a few fundamental input parameters , namely the basic decay constants @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath91 , the @xmath41 meson mass , the momentum cut  off ( or equivalently the light quark mass @xmath158 ) , and the constituent mass of the strange quark @xmath147 .",
    "we have also taken into account the physical values of the pseudoscalar meson masses . to account for the decays involving @xmath74 and @xmath75 mesons ,",
    "this set has been complemented with the parameter @xmath161 and the @xmath76 mixing angle @xmath164 .",
    "we have shown that with the choice @xmath172 gev and @xmath173 mev this simple model leads to an acceptable pattern for the vector meson mass spectrum , as well as the branching ratios for the strong decays @xmath96 , @xmath174 and @xmath175 .",

    "the contrast between the predictions of our model and the present experimental data is optimized for a @xmath164 mixing angle between @xmath167 and @xmath168 , in agreement with usual expectations . on the other hand ,",
    "we find that the preferred ratio @xmath169 lies in the range 1.75 to 2 , which is a rather high value in comparison with the result arising from large @xmath1 considerations . in general ,",
    "taking into account the relatively large theoretical error , we see that the model leads to reasonably good predictions for the main radiative pseudoscalar and vector meson decay widths .",
    "the quality of our results is comparable to that obtained in previous works which use different effective models and/or parameterizations for the flavour symmetry breaking effects .",
    "the divergent integrals @xmath176 have been regularized within the proper  time scheme @xcite .",
    "one makes use of the relation @xmath177 which holds for @xmath35 sufficiently large . if we let @xmath35 be a momentum cut  off for our theory , we have for equal masses @xmath178 @xmath179 where @xmath180 is the momentum in euclidean space , and @xmath181 is the incomplete gamma function , @xmath182    in the case where @xmath183 , eq .",
