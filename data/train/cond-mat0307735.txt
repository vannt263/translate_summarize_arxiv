    "the two - fractal overlap model of earthquake @xcite is a very recent modeling attempt .",
    "such models are all based on the observed ` plate tectonics ' and the fractal nature of the interface between tectonic plates and earth s solid crust . the statistics of overlaps between two fractals is not studied much yet , though their knowledge is often required in various physical contexts . for example",
    ", it has been established recently that since the fractured surfaces have got well - characterized self - affine properties @xcite , the distribution of the elastic energies released during the slips between two fractal surfaces ( earthquake events ) may follow the overlap distribution of two self - similar fractal surfaces @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "chakrabarti and stinchcombe @xcite had shown analytically that for regular fractal overlap ( cantor sets and carpets ) the contact area distribution follows a simple power law decay .",
    "the two fractal overlap magnitude changes in time as one fractal moves over the other .",
    "the overlap ( magnitude ) time series can therefore be studied as a model time series of earthquake avalanche dynamics @xcite .    here , we study the time ( @xmath0 ) variation of contact area ( overlap ) @xmath1 between two well - characterized fractals having the same fractal dimension as one fractal moves over the other with constant velocity . we have chosen only very simple fractals : regular or non - random cantor sets and random cantor sets .",
    "we analyse the time series data of cantor set overlaps to find the prediction possibility of large events ( occurrence of large overlaps ) .",
    "we show that the time series @xmath1 obtained by moving one fractal uniformly over the other ( with periodic boundary condition ) has some features which can be utilized to predict the ` large events ' .",
    "this is shown utilizing the discrete or a ` quantum ' nature of the integrated ( cumulative ) overlap over time .",
    "we consider here the overlap sets of two identical fractals , as one slides over the other .",
    "we study the overlap distribution @xmath2 for the overlap set @xmath3 defined at various ( sliding ) positions of the two fractals .",
    "first , we consider two regular cantor sets ( at finite generation @xmath4 ) .",
    ".3 in    .1 in    .1 in    * _ figure 1 .",
    "_ * ( a ) a regular cantor set of dimension @xmath5 ; only three finite generations are shown .",
    "( b ) the overlap of two identical ( regular ) cantor sets , at @xmath6 , when one slides over other ; the overlap sets are indicated within the vertical lines , where periodic boundary condition has been used .",
    ".2 in    next , we consider the same for two identical random cantor sets ( at finite generations @xmath4 ) .",
    ".1 in .3 in    .1 in    .1 in    * _ figure 2 .",
    "_ * ( a ) a random cantor set of dimension @xmath5 ; only three finite generations are shown .",
    "( b ) overlap of two random cantor sets ( at @xmath6 ; having the same fractal dimension ) in two different realisations .",
    "the overlap sets are indicated within the vertical bars .",
    ".1 in we studied earlier @xcite the overlap statistics for regular and random cantor sets , gaskets and percolating clusters @xcite .",
    "we found a universal scaling behavior of the overlap or contact area ( @xmath3 ) distributions @xmath2 for all types of fractal set overlaps mentioned : @xmath7 where @xmath8 denotes the finite size of the fractal and the exponent @xmath9 ; @xmath10 being the mass dimension of the fractal and @xmath11 is the embedding dimension .",
    "also the overlap distribution @xmath2 , and hence the scaled distribution @xmath12 , are seen to decay with @xmath3 or @xmath13 following a power law ( with exponent value equal to the embedding dimension of the fractals ) for both regular and random cantor sets and gaskets : @xmath14 however , for the percolating clusters @xcite , the overlap size distribution takes a gaussian form .",
    "we consider now the time series obtained by counting the overlaps @xmath1 as a function of time as one cantor set moves over the other ( periodic boundary condition is assumed ) with uniform velocity .",
    "the time series are shown in fig .",
    "3 . , for finite generations of cantor sets of dimensions @xmath5 and @xmath15 respectively .",
    ".2 in    .1 in * _ figure 3 .",
    "_ * the time ( @xmath0 ) series data of overlap size ( @xmath3 ) for regular cantor sets : ( a ) of dimension @xmath5 , at @xmath16th generation : ( b ) of dimension @xmath15 , at @xmath17th generation . the obvious periodic repeat of the time series comes from the assumed periodic boundary condition of one of the sets ( over which the other one slides ) .",
    "now we calculate the cumulative overlap size @xmath18 and plot that against time in fig .",
    "4 . note , that ` on average ' @xmath19 is seen to grow linearly with time @xmath0 for regular as well as random cantor sets .",
    "this gives a clue that instead of looking at the individual overlaps @xmath1 series one may look for the cumulative quantity .",
    "in fact , for the regular cantor set of dimension @xmath5 , the overlap @xmath3 is always @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is an integer . however",
    "the cumulative @xmath22 can not be easily expressed as any simple function of @xmath0 .",
    "still , we observe @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is dependent on the fractal .",
    "this result is even more prominant in the case of cantor sets with @xmath25 @xmath15 .",
    ".2 in .2 in    .1 in * _ figure 4 .",
    "_ * the cumulative overlap @xmath26 versus time ; for pure cantor sets : ( a ) of dimension @xmath5 ( at @xmath16th generation ) and ( b ) of dimension @xmath15 ( at @xmath17th generation ) .",
    "the dotted line corresponds to those for two identical but random cantor sets . in ( b )",
    "the two lines fall on each other .",
    "we first identify the ` large events ' occurring at time @xmath27 in the @xmath1 series , where @xmath28 , a pre - assigned number .",
    "then , we look for the cumulative overlap size @xmath29 , @xmath30 @xmath31 , where the successive large events occur at times @xmath32 and @xmath27 . the behavior of @xmath33 with time is shown in fig . 5 for regular cantor sets with @xmath34 @xmath5 at generation @xmath35 .",
    "similar results are also given for cantor sets with @xmath34 @xmath15 at generation @xmath36 in fig .",
    "@xmath37 is seen to grow almost lonearly in time upto @xmath38 ) after which it drops down to zero .",
    "it appears that there are discrete ( quantum ) values of @xmath39 ) .",
    ".3 in    .1 in    * _ figure 5 .",
    "_ * the cumulative overlap size variation with time ( for regular cantor sets of dimension @xmath5 , at @xmath16th generation ) , where the cumulative overlap has been reset to @xmath40 value after every big event ( of overlap size @xmath41 where @xmath42 ( a ) and @xmath43 ( b ) respectively ) .",
    ".2 in    * _ figure 6 .",
    "_ * the cumulative overlap size variation with time ( for regular cantor sets of dimension @xmath15 , at @xmath17th generation ) , where the cumulative overlap has been reset to @xmath40 value after every big event ( of overlap size @xmath41 where @xmath44 ( a ) and @xmath45 ( b ) respectively ) .",
    "if one cantor set moves uniformly over another , the overlap between the two fractals change quasi - randomly with time ( see eg . , fig .",
    "the overlap size distribution was argued @xcite and shown @xcite to follow power law decay .",
    "here we show numerically that if one fixes a magnitude @xmath46 of the overlap sizes @xmath3 , so that overlaps with @xmath47 are called ` events ' ( or earthquake ) , then the cumulative overlap @xmath48 , @xmath49 @xmath50 , ( where two successive events of @xmath47 occur at times @xmath32 and @xmath27 ) grows linearly with time up to some discrete quanta @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the minimal overlap quantum , dependent on @xmath46 and @xmath4 ( the generation number ) . here",
    "@xmath53 is an integer ( see figs . 5 , 6 ) .",
    "although our results here are for regular fractals of finite generation @xmath4 , the observed discretisation of the overlap cumulant @xmath33 with the time limit set by @xmath4 , is a robust feature and can be seen for larger time series for larger generation number @xmath4 .",
    "similar studies for random cantor set overlap are in progress .",
    "this model study therefore indicates that one can note the growth of the cumulant sesmic response @xmath54 , rather than the sesmic event strength @xmath1 , and anticipate some big events as the response reaches the discrete levels @xmath55 , specific to the series of events .",
