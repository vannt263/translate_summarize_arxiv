    "the envelope theory @xcite is a powerful method to obtain approximate solutions , eigenvalues and eigenstates , of eigenequations in quantum mechanics .",
    "it has been rediscovered and developed recently under the name of the auxiliary field method @xcite .",
    "both techniques are equivalent @xcite , but they were introduced from completely different starting points .",
    "let us assume that the hamiltonian @xmath0 can be written as ( in the following , we will work in natural units @xmath1 )",
    "@xmath2 with @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "such a form is relevant for one - body and two - body systems .",
    "the basic idea is to replace this hamiltonian @xmath0 by another one @xmath5 which is solvable , the eigenvalues of @xmath5 being optimized to be as close as possible to those of @xmath0 .",
    "following the structure of the hamiltonian , the approximate eigenvalues _",
    "i ) _ can be upper or lower bounds , or not to have a variational character ; _ ii ) _ can be obtained on a closed - form expression , or only numerically computed . in the most favorable case , an analytical bound ,",
    "the dependence of the eigenvalues on parameters of the hamiltonian and the quantum numbers can be determined , giving deep insights about the structure of the solutions and a reliable estimation of the spectrum . even in the less favorable situation , a non - variational numerical approximation ,",
    "it is possible to check easily and rapidly more elaborate numerical computations .    at the origin",
    ", the method has been developed for schrdinger equations @xcite , and afterwards it has been extended for the semirelativistic kinematics @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this work is to generalize the technique to arbitrary kinetic operators .",
    "this is motivated by the existence of non - standard kinetic energies in some physical problems , for instance in atomic physics ( non - parabolic dispersion relation ) @xcite or in hadronic physics ( particle mass depending on the relative momentum ) @xcite .",
    "another motivation is to support the new definition of the effective particle mass proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite .    the generic method to compute approximate solutions ( which could be upper or lower bounds ) of a hamiltonian with a non - standard kinetic part is presented in section  [ ge ] . as",
    "this work is a generalization of the one described in ref .",
    "@xcite , the main equations are worked out without too many details . in section  [ sc ] , a semiclassical interpretation of the generic equations is given . in order to check the validity of the method , an analytical toy model with a gaussian form for the kinetic part is solved and the formula obtained is compared with numerical solutions in section  [ tm ] . concluding remarks are given in section  [ conclu ] .",
    "the envelope theory is generalized here to treat on the same footing the potential and kinetic parts .",
    "the idea is to replace the hamiltonian  ( [ tpv ] ) by the following one @xmath6 with @xmath7 and @xmath8 @xmath9 and @xmath10 are two real parameters , and we assume that the following functions are well - defined @xmath11 the kinematics of @xmath5 is nonrelativistic , @xmath12 is an auxiliary potential , and a prime denotes the derivative .",
    "an eigenvalue of this hamiltonian is given by @xmath13 where @xmath14 is an eigenvalue of the nonrelativistic hamiltonian @xmath15 kinetic and potential parts are treated in a similar way , but with @xmath16 which is the counterpart of @xmath12 and @xmath17 which is the counterpart of @xmath10 .",
    "the approximation for an eigenvalue of the genuine hamiltonian is given by @xmath18 for which @xmath19 within these conditions , @xmath20 is tangent to @xmath21 and @xmath22 is tangent to @xmath23 .",
    "the comparison theorem @xcite implies that , if @xmath24 and @xmath25 for all values of the arguments , then the eigenvalues of @xmath5 are upper bounds of the corresponding eigenvalues of @xmath0 .",
    "reciprocally , if @xmath26 and @xmath27 for all values of the arguments , then the eigenvalues of @xmath5 are lower bounds . in other cases",
    ", no guarantee exists about the variational character of the approximations .",
    "a simple criteria to determine if a bound exists is given in refs .",
    "@xcite for the potential , but it can be also used for the kinetic part .",
    "let us define two functions @xmath28 and @xmath29 such that @xmath30 if @xmath31 and @xmath32 are both concave ( convex ) functions , @xmath18 is an upper ( lower ) bound of the genuine eigenvalue . if @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) , the variational character is solely ruled by the convexity of @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "interesting results can be obtained if the auxiliary potential is a power law , @xmath37 within this condition , @xmath10 and @xmath9 are always positive quantities , and @xmath14 can be written under the form @xcite @xmath38 where @xmath39 is a global quantum number .",
    "the method is particularly interesting if @xmath39 is exactly known .",
    "this is the case for the coulomb interaction ( @xmath40 , @xmath41 ) and the harmonic potential ( @xmath42 , @xmath43 ) .",
    "if @xmath44 , @xmath39 is known only for @xmath45 states and is equal to @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the @xmath48th zero of the airy function ai . for arbitrary values of @xmath49",
    ", simple and good analytical approximations can be found in ref .",
    "but , if @xmath39 is not computed with a sufficient accuracy , the variational character of a bound can not be guaranteed .",
    "after some algebra , constraints ( [ condextrema ] ) , with @xmath50 given by ( [ pr ] ) , reduce to @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 . from ( [ cond1 ] ) and ( [ cond2 ] ) , we can deduce that @xmath54 .",
    "taking into account this result , plus the relations @xmath55 and @xmath56 , ( [ cond1 ] ) and ( [ cond2 ] ) can be written in the more compact form ( [ afm3 ] ) .",
    "after some algebra , the approximate eigenvalue @xmath18 given by ( [ eafm ] ) with the parameterization ( [ epspr ] ) can be greatly simplified into ( [ afm1 ] ) . finally , the approximate solution is given by the following set of equations @xmath57 the parameter @xmath58 can then be interpreted as a mean distance between the particles and @xmath59 as a mean momentum per particle .",
    "both parameters depend on the quantum numbers via @xmath39 .",
    "the value @xmath60 can be a ( upper or lower ) bound following the convexity of functions @xmath36 and @xmath35 , as explained above .",
    "let us note that the only trace of the auxiliary potential is contained in the value of @xmath39 , and that ( [ afm3 ] ) is the translation into the variables @xmath58 and @xmath59 of the generalized virial theorem @xcite .",
    "the system  ( [ afm1])-([afm3 ] ) is similar to the systems ( 3.2)-(3.4 ) in ref .",
    "@xcite and ( 15)-(17 ) in ref .",
    "@xcite , but here",
    "the form of the kinetic part is arbitrary .",
    "let us note @xmath61 an eigenstate of the nonrelativistic hamiltonian @xmath62 given by ( [ hnr ] ) with @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "such a state is an approximation of the corresponding eigenstate of @xmath0 @xcite . using the hellmann - feynman theorem @xcite as in ref .",
    "@xcite , it can be shown that @xmath65 this confirms the interpretation of parameters @xmath58 and @xmath59 as mean values .",
    ", width=226 ]    in refs .",
    "@xcite , an effective particle mass @xmath66 is defined by the relation @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the group velocity of the associated wave packet .",
    "it follows then that @xmath69 using this definition , a semiclassical interpretation of the system ( [ afm1])-([afm3 ] ) is possible . if @xmath70 is the kinetic energy for the @xmath71th particle , the kinetic energy for two particles can be written @xmath72 , where @xmath59 is the module of the common momentum in the center of mass frame . with the effective mass ( [ meffdef ] )",
    ", we have @xmath73 and the speed of the @xmath71th particle is given by @xmath74 .",
    "as in ref .",
    "@xcite , let us assume a classical circular motion for the two particles ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : class ] ) .",
    "the centripetal force @xmath75 acting on the @xmath71th particle is given by @xmath76 if @xmath58 is the distance between the two particles , the rigid rotation constraints , @xmath77 and @xmath78 , imply that @xmath79 if the force acting on the @xmath71th particle comes from the potential @xmath80 generated by @xmath81 , then @xmath82 .",
    "( [ fi2 ] ) and ( [ r0r1r2 ] ) can be recast into the form ( [ afm3 ] ) , and it is obvious than ( [ afm1 ] ) gives the mass of the system .",
    "a semiclassical quantification of the total orbital angular momentum gives @xmath83 , and we obtain a system very similar to ( [ afm1])-([afm3 ] ) .",
    "this supports ( [ meffdef ] ) as a good definition for the effective mass .",
    "in this section , we solve a simple toy model in order to check the relevance of the method .",
    "let us consider the following hamiltonian with a gaussian form for the kinetic part @xmath84 where the parameter @xmath85 plays the role of a mass .",
    "indeed , for high values of @xmath85 ( @xmath86 ) , @xmath0 reduces to a harmonic oscillator hamiltonian @xmath87 the parameter @xmath88 or 2 is the number of particles ( arbitrary positive value of @xmath89 can also be considered to study duality relations between different many - body systems @xcite ) .",
    "such a hamiltonian is not realistic but it has been chosen because _",
    "i ) _ it admits an analytical lower bound ( see below ) ; _ ii ) _ it reduces to the well known case ( [ tpvexplim ] ) in a well - defined limit ; _ iii ) _ accurate numerical solutions are not easy to obtain ( see below ) .",
    "it is more convenient to work with the conjugate dimensionless variables @xmath90 and @xmath91 for the dimensionless hamiltonian @xmath92 given by @xmath93 the corresponding eigenvalues are noted @xmath94 .     of ( [ tpvexpred ] ) as a function of @xmath95 .",
    "by increasing energy , the eigenvalues corresponds to @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "dots : accurate numerical solutions ; solid black lines : lower bound ( [ eexpred ] ) with @xmath99 ; dashed grey lines : harmonic oscillator approximation ( [ eexpredho ] ) with @xmath99 .",
    "[ fig : expp2],scaledwidth=45.0% ]    using the set of equations ( [ afm1])-([afm3 ] ) , the following approximate solution can be found @xmath100,\\ ] ] where @xmath101 is the main branch of the lambert function ( also called omega function or product logarithm ) @xcite . if @xmath102 , we can write @xmath103 with @xmath104 this corresponds to the harmonic oscillator approximation .",
    "a natural choice is to take @xmath105 .",
    "then , @xmath99 and the function @xmath36 defined by ( [ hg ] ) is convex .",
    "so , ( [ eexpred ] ) is a lower bound , whose quality is shown on fig .",
    "[ fig : expp2 ] .",
    "the numerical solutions of ( [ tpvexpred ] ) have been computed with the the three - dimensional fourier grid hamiltonian method @xcite which is particularly well suited for this type of hamiltonian .",
    "this numerical procedure is equivalent to an expansion in a special basis @xcite and implies the computation of hamiltonian matrix elements . because of the exponential function in ( [ tpvexpred ] ) , these matrix elements can be huge numbers and they must be computed with a very high accuracy to obtain stable and accurate eigenvalues .",
    "one can see that the lower bound is quite good and more accurate that the harmonic oscillator approximation when @xmath95 increases .",
    "the envelope theory ( or equivalently the auxiliary field method ) is a method to compute approximate solutions ( generally upper or lower bounds ) of hamiltonians of the form @xmath106 , where the kinetic part @xmath21 is a nonrelativistic @xcite or a semirelativistic one @xcite . in this paper",
    ", it is shown that the method can be used for arbitrary forms of @xmath21 .",
    "the idea is to replace the hamiltonian @xmath0 by another one @xmath107 which is solvable , and with @xmath20 and @xmath22 respectively tangent to @xmath21 and @xmath23 .",
    "provided @xmath20 is a nonrelativistic kinetic operator and @xmath22 a power - law potential , the approximate eigensolutions can be easily computed by solving a set of three equations which have a natural semiclassical interpretation . nevertheless , the computation is a full quantum one since eigenvalues and eigenstates are obtained for a well - defined global quantum number @xmath39 .",
    "a priori , this method can be applied to a wide variety of hamiltonians relevant for various domains , from atomic to hadronic physics . with a good choice of the power law ,",
    "the value of @xmath39 is analytically known and the eigenvalues obtained can be upper or lower bounds of the genuine energies .",
    "if numerical approximations can be easily computed , closed - form formulae can even be obtained for some particular hamiltonians .",
    "the toy model studied here with a harmonic potential and a gaussian kinetic operator is in the most favorable situation : a quite accurate analytical lower bound is obtained giving deep insights about the structure of the solutions .",
