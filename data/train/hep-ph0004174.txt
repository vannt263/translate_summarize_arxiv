    "the physics at hera has proved the successes of ( resummed ) perturbative qcd in describing many observables accurately measured there : inclusive ones like the structure function @xmath0 , but also more exclusive ones , like the diffractive structure function @xmath1 , or heavy meson production .",
    "the justification for relying on a perturbative development is that the deep - inelastic scattering process naturally provides a well - controlled hard scale given by the photon virtuality @xmath2 , which makes the effective strong coupling constant @xmath3 small enough . on the one hand ,",
    "the physics of these observables is usually well described by the renormalization group evolution @xcite between a lower scale @xmath4 at which the proton parton densities are parametrized and the scale @xmath2 . on the other hand ,",
    "the cross - section for the events selected with the requirement that a forward jet of transverse momentum @xmath5 of the order of @xmath2 be present in the final state is seemingly not described by a straightforward dglap evolution ( see ref.@xcite and references therein ) : as a matter of fact , these regge - like kinematics are expected to select the bfkl dynamics @xcite .    in @xmath6 collisions at the tevatron ,",
    "no hard scale is provided by the initial state .",
    "however , it can be generated in the scattering and manifests itself in the final state in the form of a jet with a large transverse momentum .",
    "events of this class are also accessible to a perturbative qcd interpretation .    in this letter , we focus on high - energy onia ( massive @xmath7 states ) collisions , as a model for @xmath6 collisions at high energy when high - mass scales are selected by forward jets",
    ". the inclusive cross - sections for onia collisions have been described using a dipole cascade modelling the rapidity evolution of the @xmath7 pairs before their interaction @xcite . here",
    "we require that at least the first ( most forward ) gluon which goes to the final state has its transverse momentum larger than a scale @xmath8 ; this gluon becomes a forward - jet , and we interpret it as an effective colour - dipole distribution present at the time of the scattering .    in section * 2 * , we detail the modelisation that we adopt for the forward jet . we show in section * 3 * how we can extract to double - leading logarithmic ( dll ) approximation , the dipole content of such an object .",
    "section * 4 * contains our conclusions and outlook .",
    "the onium - onium forward scattering amplitude involves the exchange of two gluons between the initial onia . at high - energy , one has to take into account the possibility of multiple splittings of these @xmath9-channel gluons .",
    "this can be done either by ( @xmath10)factorizing @xcite a bfkl - like ladder between the bare onia , or equivalently by computing the two - gluon exchange diagram between the onia dressed by an arbitrary number of soft `` sea '' gluons .",
    "the latter approach inspired the colour - dipole model of ref.@xcite .",
    "the equivalence between these two methods was shown on different features of both pictures in ref.@xcite .    in this section",
    ", we shall derive in a @xmath9-channel picture the gluon density @xmath11 which is to be considered in an interacting `` onium+forward - jet '' system as the starting - point of a bfkl evolution .",
    "the next section will be devoted to the interpretation of the obtained density as an effective primordial dipole density inside the forward jet .",
    "we have to compute the `` @xmath12 '' amplitude , where the initial - state dipole of radius @xmath13 is part of an onium , and the final - state gluon has a transverse momentum @xmath14 . the modulus @xmath15 is larger than a given scale @xmath8 .",
    "having in mind the fact that in a physical process the initial - state dipole will be part of a hadron instead of an onium , we will consider in the following that @xmath16 whenever needed for technical purpose .",
    "we start with the ( virtual)gluon - dipole cross - section @xmath17 which defines the gluon density inside a dipole at lowest order in @xmath18",
    ". it reads ( see ref.@xcite ) : @xmath19 it can be expressed as an inverse mellin - transform in the transverse plane : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is interpreted as the well - known dipole - gluon `` vertex '' in the mellin space : @xmath22 we then factorize the emission of a real gluon .",
    "it can be computed directly in the high - energy limit by evaluating the relevant graphs ( one of them is pictured in fig.*[fig:1 ] * ) , but it is also convenient to see it as one step of the bfkl ladder .",
    "the initial gluon density @xmath23 and the density @xmath11 after emission of a gluon are related through the formula : @xmath24 which is the lowest order ( in @xmath25 ) bfkl equation written in an unfolded form ( see for instance ref.@xcite ) .",
    "the variable @xmath26 is proportional to @xmath27 , where @xmath28 and @xmath9 are the ordinary mandelstam variables for the reaction . in deep - inelastic scattering",
    ", @xmath26 would stand for the bjorken variable .",
    "let us write the mellin - transform of eq.([eq : mellin ] ) : @xmath29 where we used similar notations as in ref.@xcite , although we have not performed the mellin - transform with respect to @xmath26 .",
    "the variable @xmath30 describes a path @xmath31\\gamma_0\\!-\\!i\\infty,\\gamma_0\\!+\\!i\\infty[$ ] in the complex plane , with @xmath32 .",
    "inserting eqs.([eq:1])-([eq:4 ] ) into eq.([eq : hgsh ] ) , it follows that : @xmath33 the integration over @xmath34 can easily be performed switching to complex variables and using the well - known identity ( see @xcite and references therein ) : @xmath35 valid for @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the result reads : @xmath39 where the meijer - function @xmath40 ( which arguments will be abreviated in the following ) writes : @xmath41 the contour of integration @xmath42 being defined on fig.*2*. the function @xmath43 can be seen as the coefficient - function in the sense of ref.@xcite , for the onium+forward - jet system .",
    "in ref.@xcite , a relation was established between the coefficient - function @xmath43 of a virtual photon and its corresponding squared wave - function @xmath44 on a dipole basis .",
    "we shall make use of it in the present context of semi - exclusive factorization to extract the dipole content of the forward jet from the coefficient - function found above , at dll accuracy .",
    "the double - logs should manifest themselves through factors like @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is a characteristic size for the final state .",
    "the relationship between the squared wave - function and the coefficient - function reads : @xmath47 an intuitive way of understanding this relation could be the following : dividing the coefficient - function pictured in fig.*[fig:1 ] * by the factor @xmath48 amounts to getting rid of the vertex of the lowest gluon which in this picture is also a gluon - dipole vertex .",
    "hence one ends up with the dipole content of the scattering object : @xmath49    let us explore the limit @xmath50 , in which the forward jet has a transverse momentum much larger than the characteristic scale of the initial onium .",
    "the meijer - function @xmath40 can be approximated in a straightforward manner by picking the pole ( at @xmath51 ) which lies on the left of the integration path .",
    "indeed , the contour @xmath42 can be deformed to @xmath52 ( see fig.*2 * ) since the integral converges on any path such that @xmath53 , where @xmath54 : @xmath55 the integral taken on the contour @xmath52 is subdominant by some power of @xmath56 with respect to the contribution of the double - pole at @xmath51 , and one writes : @xmath57 this approximation proves to be very good numerically even for relatively small @xmath58 .",
    "then the squared dipole wave - function reads , in this approximation : @xmath59    we want to obtain an expression for the distribution of dipoles in the system in coordinate space , i.e. as a function of the transverse size @xmath60 .",
    "it is given by the inverse - mellin transform of @xmath44 : @xmath61 we obtain the following result : @xmath62 the second term is not relevant in our approximation , since the limit of large @xmath58 selects the dll ; the terms beyond this approximation are not under control .",
    "hence the interaction of the system formed by the initial dipole and the forward gluon can be viewed as a dipole - dipole interaction provided the system is described by the following dipole distribution : @xmath63    let us give an interpretation of the various factors in this distribution .",
    "first , note that the dependence on the initial dipole size @xmath64 only appears in the factor @xmath65 .",
    "this remarkable fact technically results from the combination of the term @xmath66 and the inverse - mellin transform of the @xmath67 functions in the inverse - mellin transform of eq.([eq : phigam ] ) .",
    "physically , the overall factor @xmath68 can then be interpreted as the probability of finding a dipole of size @xmath60 inside a dipole of size @xmath64 .",
    "indeed , in the dll approximation at lowest order in @xmath25 and assuming an available energy proportional to @xmath69 , the probability of finding a dipole of size @xmath70 between @xmath71 and @xmath72 inside a dipole of size @xmath73 reads @xcite : @xmath74 where the second approximate equality holds when @xmath75 . dividing out this factor in eq.([eq : dipolegluon ] ) leads to the universal dipole content of the gluon radiated into the final state .",
    "we normalize the first moment of the obtained squared wave - function to unity has now the unusual dimension @xmath76 ^ 3 $ ] , but it enables a comparison to the photon squared wave - function @xmath77 , for which the @xmath78 moment diverges logarithmically . ]",
    "( i.e. @xmath79 ) , and so we are led to : @xmath80 note that this squared wave - function for which we provide a derivation here is exactly the one ( integrated over the energy - share variable @xmath81 and properly normalized ) that was postulated in ref.@xcite . to see this , we only need to recall that the mellin transform of the function @xmath82 reads : @xmath83    the behaviour of @xmath84",
    "is represented in fig.*3*. it is compared to the behaviour of the transverse virtual photon squared wave - function in @xmath7 pairs , integrated over the fraction of the photon longitudinal momentum @xmath81 carried by the quark .",
    "this photon wave - function reads : @xmath85 where the same normalization @xmath86 has been enforced .",
    "some remarks are in order .",
    "the squared wave - function @xmath84 represents the effective distribution of dipoles resulting from a final - state gluon which has its transverse momentum larger than @xmath8 .",
    "we note that it is slowly decreasing with @xmath60 ( @xmath87 ) , which means that dipoles of large size occur with a non - negligible probability .",
    "the width of the distribution is of order @xmath88 , but since its behaviour at infinity is only powerlike , @xmath8 is not a clean cutoff .",
    "it has an oscillatory behaviour , the oscillation length being of the order of @xmath88 .",
    "however , @xmath84 takes also negative values , which indicates that it does not allow for a direct probabilistic interpretation like in the case of the @xmath89-pair distribution @xmath77 inside the photon .",
    "using a straightforward model and a qcd calculation in the dll approximation , we have shown that a gluonic hard probe in the final - state can be characterized by a dipole - distribution @xmath90 .",
    "this distribution decreases weakly with @xmath60 and takes negative values .",
    "we confirm the ( integrated over @xmath81 ) result obtained in ref.@xcite .",
    "the obtained distribution can now be used to compute processes of several topologies : for instance deep - inelasic scattering on a forward - jet at small-@xmath26 , @xmath91 interactions with two jets in the final - state separated by a large rapidity range . in any case",
    ", the dipole formulation for these observables is of the type : @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the eigenvalue of the bfkl kernel , and @xmath94 the rapidity range between the two probes characterized by the dipole distributions @xmath84 and @xmath95 .",
    "note that the simplest observable one can compute using this formula is the cross - section @xmath96 for the production of dijets of respective transverse momenta larger than @xmath97 and @xmath98 in hadronic collisions .",
    "it reads : @xmath99 which is the mueller - navelet formula @xcite , modulo some normalization we did not keep precise track of . hence this little calculation provides a further check of our dipole distribution .",
    "this study may deserve several further investigations and improvements .",
    "first of all , we worked only up to terms beyond the dll approximation .",
    "it would be useful to perform a more complete calculation , by computing to leading log-@xmath69 precision all the graphs of the type of the one in fig.*1 * which contribute , to see if the dipole factorization still holds .    on the other hand",
    ", it would be nice to supplement our indirect method of extracting the dipole content by a more direct calculation in the framework of the colour - dipole model : this would insure the full control of the leading log-@xmath69 , including a correct treatment of the virtual corrections .",
    "although quite straightforward to formulate , the latter calculation exhibits many technical difficulties .",
    "both these proposed improvements deserve more studies . +",
