    "with severe spectrum shortage in the currently deployed cellular bands ( sub-6 ghz ) and the explosive wireless traffic demand , there is a growing consensus on utilizing higher frequency bands , e.g. , the millimeter - wave ( mmw ) band and the terahertz ( thz ) band , for future wireless communication systems @xcite .",
    "massive multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) transmission deploys large numbers of antennas at the base stations ( bss ) to simultaneously serve multiple user terminals ( uts ) and can significantly improve the system spectrum efficiency @xcite .",
    "combination of massive mimo with mmw / thz technologies is appealing from a practical point of view .",
    "orders - of - magnitude smaller wavelength in mmw / thz bands enables a larger number of antennas to be deployed at both uts and bss . even for",
    "a high propagation path loss at mmw / thz channels , the achievable high beamforming gains with massive mimo can help to compensate for it .",
    "therefore , massive mimo transmission over mmw / thz bands , which will be referred to as mmw / thz massive mimo , is envisioned as a promising solution for wireless communications in the future @xcite .",
    "utilizing mmw / thz frequencies for cellular wireless has received intense research interest recently .",
    "one challenge in realizing cellular wireless over mmw / thz channels is to deal with the mobility issue @xcite .",
    "for the same mobile speed , the doppler spread of mmw / thz channels is orders - of - magnitude larger than that of classical wireless channels while the delay spread does not change significantly over different frequencies , which may lead to system implementation bottleneck .",
    "consider wideband mmw / thz transmission employing orthogonal frequency division multiplexing ( ofdm ) modulation for example . with perfect time and frequency synchronization in the space domain ,",
    "the length of the cyclic prefix ( cp ) is usually set to be slightly larger than the delay span to mitigate channel dispersion in time while the length of the ofdm symbol is usually set to be inversely proportional to the doppler spread to mitigate channel dispersion in frequency @xcite . as a result",
    ", the overhead of the cp will be much larger to deal with the same delay spread and it might be difficult to design proper ofdm parameters .",
    "there exist some works related to the above issue .",
    "for example , beam - based doppler frequency compensation has been suggested in @xcite and @xcite for narrowband mimo channels .",
    "in addition , reduced delay spread with narrow directional beams has been observed in recent mmw channel measurement results @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we exploit massive mimo to address the above issue .",
    "specifically , we propose per - beam synchronization ( pbs ) for mmw / thz massive mimo - ofdm transmission and apply it to the recently proposed beam division multiple access ( bdma ) @xcite .",
    "the major contributions of this paper are summarized as follows , part of which has been submitted to a conference @xcite :    * we introduce a physically motivated beam domain channel model for massive mimo .",
    "we show that when both the numbers of antennas at bs and uts are sufficiently large , the beam domain channel elements tend to be statistically uncorrelated and the respective variances depend on the channel power angle spectra ( pas ) , while the envelopes of the beam domain channel elements tend to be independent of time and frequency . *",
    "we propose pbs in time and frequency for mmw / thz massive mimo . both delay and doppler frequency spreads of the wideband mimo channels with pbs are shown to be approximately reduced by a factor of the number of ut antennas compared with the conventional synchronization approaches @xcite .",
    "note that the proposed pbs can also be applied to massive mimo transmission over other frequency bands as long as the numbers of ut antennas are sufficiently large .",
    "* we apply pbs to bdma in which multiple access is achieved by providing each ut with a mutually non - overlapping subset of bs beams @xcite .",
    "we investigate beam scheduling to maximize achievable ergodic rates for both uplink ( ul ) and downlink ( dl ) bdma , and develop a greedy beam scheduling algorithm based on the average squared beam domain channel norm .",

    "in this section , we will first introduce a physically motivated beam domain channel model for mmw / thz massive mimo and then investigate its properties .    consider a single - cell massive mimo system , where the bs with @xmath30 antennas simultaneously serves @xmath31 uts , each with @xmath32 antennas .",

    "the small wavelength in mmw / thz bands makes it possible to pack a large number of antennas at the uts in addition to the bs .",

    "the channel delay and doppler shift properties are usually related to its aoa - aod properties @xcite .",
    "we first consider the relationship between the doppler shift and the aoa - aod pair .",
    "assume that the scatterers are stationary and the channel temporal fluctuation is mainly due to the motion of the ut .",
    "also assume that ut @xmath39 moves along a straight line at a constant velocity @xmath40 and the motion direction is parallel to the ula of ut @xmath39 .",

    "due to the channel sparsity @xcite and the relatively large transmission bandwidth over mmw / thz bands , the probability that two resolvable propagation paths have the same aoa - aod pair but different path delays can be almost neglected @xcite .",
    "therefore , we assume that there are no two paths with the same aoa - aod pair but different path delays , and the path delay of the channel with aoa - aod pair @xmath46 is defined as @xmath47 .    with the above modeling of the channel delay and doppler shift , the corresponding complex baseband dl space domain channel frequency response , @xmath48 , at time @xmath49 and frequency @xmath50 can be represented as ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) @xmath51\\right\\ } }    { { \\mathrm{d}}\\phi}{{\\mathrm{d}}\\theta}\\in{\\mathbb{c}}^{k\\times m},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath52 is the average power of the path associated with aod - aoa pair @xmath53 given by the pas of ut @xmath39 , and @xmath54 is a random phase that is uniformly distributed over @xmath55 and independent of @xmath56 for @xmath57 or @xmath58 . note that the channel model in has been widely adopted and verified in recent mmw / thz works @xcite .",

    "two typical mmw / thz carrier frequencies , 30 ghz and 300 ghz , are considered .",
    "the array topology is set as ula with half wavelength antenna spacing for both the bs and the ut sides .",
    "the major mimo - ofdm parameters are listed in table [ tb : ofdm_para_mmw ] .",

    "the number of channel clusters is set as 4 and each of the clusters is composed of 20 subpaths @xcite . the delay spread and angle spread",
    "are set as 1388.4 ns and @xmath242 , respectively @xcite .",
    "we first evaluate the performance of the proposed beam scheduling algorithm listed in table [ tab : gbsa ] . as it is difficult to perform exhaustive search for the considered beam scheduling problem , an extreme case , namely , interference - free case ,",
    "in which the inter - user interference is `` genie - aided '' eliminated , is adopted as the performance comparison benchmark .",
    "note that the performance achieved by the optimal exhaustive search will lie between those of the interference - free case and the proposed algorithm . in fig .",

    "we can observe that the performance of the proposed beam scheduling algorithm can approach that of the interference - free case , especially in the low - to - medium snr regime .",
    "in particular , for snr=5 db , the performance of the proposed algorithm can achieve at least 90% and 83% of the optimal exhaustive search at carrier frequencies of 30 ghz and 300 ghz , respectively .",
    "in the subsequent simulation , we will adopt the proposed beam scheduling algorithm to save the computational cost .",
    "we then evaluate the performance of the proposed pbs .",
    "we focus on the bit - error rate ( ber ) performance of bdma transmission for 1/2-rate turbo - coded quadrature phase - shift keying ( qpsk ) mapped signals and adopt the following simulation settings .",
    "each transmission frame begins with one pilot ofdm symbol using the pilot design suggested in @xcite , followed by six data ofdm symbols .",
    "an iterative receiver as introduced in @xcite is adopted . in fig .",
    "[ fig : ber_comp ] , the ber performance of the proposed pbs and conventional space domain synchronization under typical mobility scenarios is presented .",
    "the ber performance of the ideal case , where the receivers have perfect instantaneous csi for static channels , is presented as the comparison benchmark .",
    "we can observe that the proposed pbs outperforms conventional space domain synchronization significantly in typical mobility scenarios at mmw / thz bands , which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed pbs .",
    "in this paper , we have proposed bdma for mmw / thz massive mimo transmission with per - beam synchronization ( pbs ) .",
    "we have first investigated the physically motivated beam domain channel model and shown that when both the numbers of antennas at bs and uts tend to infinity , the beam domain channel fading in time and frequency disappears asymptotically .",
    "this channel property has then motivated us to propose pbs , where signal over each beam of the uts is synchronized individually .",
    "we have shown that both the effective channel delay and doppler frequency spreads can be approximately reduced by a factor of the number of ut antennas in the large array regime with pbs compared with the conventional synchronization approaches , which effectively mitigates the severe doppler effect in mmw / thz systems and leads to a significantly reduced cp overhead .",
    "we have further applied pbs to bdma .",
    "we have investigated beam scheduling for both ul and dl bdma and a greedy beam scheduling algorithm has been developed .",
    "the effectiveness of the pbs - based bdma for mmw / thz massive mimo - ofdm systems in typical mobility scenarios has been verified in the simulation .",
