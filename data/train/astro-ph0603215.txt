    "in recent years a number of papers have been published reporting very deep spectroscopic observations of the relatively faint optical recombination lines ( orls ) emitted by heavy element ions in planetary nebulae ( pne ) , e.g. liu et al .",

    "a common feature of the analyses of these orls was that they yielded systematically higher ionic abundances than obtained for the same ions from classical nebular forbidden lines ( also known as collisionally excited lines , or cels ) . for most pne ,",
    "the orl / cel abundance discrepancy factors ( adf s ) typically lie in the range 1.63.0 , but with a significant tail extending to much higher adf values .",
    "liu et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and luo , liu & barlow ( 2001 ) found a mean ( with respect to all the heavy elements measured ) adf of @xmath3 for ngc 7009 , while liu et al .",
    "( 2000 ) derived a mean adf of @xmath4 for ngc 6153 and liu et al .",
    "( 2001 ) obtained mean adf s of @xmath5 and 20 for the bulge pne m  2 - 36 and m  1 - 42 , respectively .",
    "kaler ( 1988 ) reported an extremely strong c  ii @xmath14267 recombination line from the southern pn hf  2 - 2 , with an observed intensity of 910 on a scale where h@xmath6 = 100 , which represents an enhancement of more than a factor of ten compared to most pne . as part of a search for further high - adf nebulae , we therefore observed hf  2 - 2 and report our results here , which confirm that this nebula has the strongest orls and highest adf s known for any planetary nebula .",
    "hf2 - 2 was observed on three photometric nights in june 2001 with the boller & chivens long - slit spectrograph mounted on the eso 1.52-m telescope .",
    "two wavelength regions were observed .",
    "the seeing was between 23arcsec , throughout most of the night of june 18 , followed by three nights of sub - arcsec seeing .",
    "the slit was positioned at pa@xmath7 , centred on the central star .",
    "the ccd was a 2672@xmath8512 loral uv - flooded chip with a pixel size of 15  @xmath9 m and a read - out - noise of 7.2e@xmath10pix@xmath11 rms .",
    "two wavelength regions were observed , see table  1 for a journal of observations .",
    "the blue region was observed with a 2400linesmm@xmath11 holographic grating , which yielded a dispersion of 32mm@xmath11 , or @xmath12pix@xmath11 .",
    "some vignetting was observed , in particular on the blue side of this large format ccd , which limited the useful wavelength range to 35404800   .",
    "a slitwidth of 2arcsec was used for maximum spectral resolution .",
    "in addition , in order to obtain magnitudes for the central star , two spectra with slitwidths of 4 and 8arcsec were also obtained .",
    "because of the uv flooding procedure to maximise sensitivity , the instrumental line width was significantly broader than predicted by the instrumental optics alone  a 2arcsec slit projects to only 1.32pix on the ccd , yet the actual measured line width was about 3pix , or 1.5 fwhm .",
    "the spectral resolution degraded even more towards the edges of the spectral coverage , approaching 2 fwhm .",
    "the red wavelength region , from 47507230 , was observed with a 1200linesmm@xmath11 ruled grating at a dispersion of 65.6mm@xmath11 . for a 2arcsec wide slit , this yielded a spectral resolution of 2.8 fwhm including the effects caused by the uv - flooding .",
    "all spectra were wavelength - calibrated using exposures of a he - ar - ne - fe lamp and flux - calibrated using 8arcsec wide slit observations of the _ hst _ standard stars feige 110 and the central star of the pn ngc7293 .",
    "example spectra obtained with a 2arcsec slitwidth are shown in fig.1 .",
    ".journal of observations [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     @xmath13 average abundances of galactic disk and bulge pne ( kingsburgh & barlow 1994 ; exter , barlow & walton 2004 ) , all based on cel analyses except for helium for which orls were used ; @xmath14 solar values from lodders ( 2003 )    elemental abundances derived from cels and from orls are compared in table  6 .",
    "also listed in the table are average abundances for galactic disk and bulge pne taken from kingsburgh & barlow ( 1994 ) and exter , barlow & walton ( 2004 ) , and the latest solar photospheric values compiled by lodders ( 2003 ) .    the oxygen abundance derived from the cels ( 8.11 on a logarithmic scale where h = 12.00 ) is 0.55  dex smaller than the mean value of 8.66 found for galactic disk and bulge pne ( kingsburgh & barlow 1994 ; exter et al .",
    "2004 ) . since it seems unlikely that hf  2 - 2 has an abnormally low oxygen abundance , given the great strength of its orls , we have explored what physical conditions would be needed to return a more ` normal ' oxygen abundance from its cels .",
    "we find that the adoption of @xmath15 = 6560  k for both the oxygen cels and the recombining h@xmath16 in the nebula would yield @xmath17 , while the adoption of @xmath15 = 4030  k would bring the oxygen cel and orl abundances into agreement , at @xmath18 .",
    "if we were to adopt the @xmath15([o  iii ] ) of 8820  k for the oxygen cels but used @xmath15(bj ) = 900  k , the h  i balmer jump temperature , for h@xmath6 , then we would find @xmath19 .",
    "however , if h@xmath6 and the oxygen cels originate from such physically distinct regions , then an abundance ratio based on their relative intensities is meaningless",
    ".    there are two ionic species , doubly ionized oxygen and neon , for which abundances have been determined using both cels and orls . in both cases ,",
    "the orl abundance is about a factor of 70 larger than the cel value .",
    "the abundance discrepancy factors ( adf s ) observed in hf2 - 2 are thus the largest for any known pn ( except , possibly , the h - deficient knots in abell30 where the adf s reach nearly three orders of magnitude  c.f .",
    "wesson et al . 2003 ) .",
    "equally remarkable is that hf2 - 2 exhibits the lowest balmer jump temperature , @xmath20  k ever measured for a pn .",
    "this is in good agreement with the relation observed in other pne , i.e. the adf is positively correlated with the difference between the [ o  iii ] forbidden line temperature and the balmer jump temperature ( liu et al . 2001 ) .",
    "the very low balmer jump temperature of hf2 - 2 and its unusually strong heavy element orls mimic closely what was found for the ejected shell around nova dq her 1934 , for which williams et al .",
    "( 1978 ) detected a strong broad emission feature at 3644 which they identified as the balmer jump formed at a very low temperature not exceeding about 500  k.    ever since the detection of a balmer jump temperature as low as 3560  k for the galactic bulge pn m1 - 42 , 5660  k lower than the [ o  iii ] forbidden line temperature measured for the same nebula ( liu et al .",
    "2001 ) , it has become increasingly clear that pne , at least those exhibiting large adf s , must contain another component of previously unknown ionized gas .",
    "this component of gas is a strong orl emitter yet is essentially invisible in traditional strong cels , as the electron temperature prevailing there is too low to excite any uv or optical cels .",
    "this is probably caused by the much enhanced cooling by ionic infrared fine - structure lines that is a consequence of a very high metallicity .",
    "this inference is supported by detailed photoionization modelling ( pquignot et al 2003 ; tylenda 2003 ) and by direct measurements of the _ average _ electron temperatures under which various types of line are emitted ( c.f .",
    "liu 2003 , 2005 for recent reviews ) .",
    "the current observation and analysis add further credibility to this conjecture .",
    "in particular we have provided new observational evidence that the electron density of the region emitting the orls differs significantly from the cel emitting region , reinforcing the conclusion that at least two distinct components are involved in a more complete understanding of the orl / cel spectra .",
    "pne are found to show a wide range of adf s , from nearly unity , i.e. agreement between the cel and the orl abundances , up to nearly a factor of 100 , as in the most extreme case reported here .",
    "two - abundance photoionization modelling of ngc6153 ( pquignot et al .",
    "2002 , 2003 ) , which exhibits an average adf of approximately 10 ( liu et al . 2000 ) , shows that only a few jupiter masses of gas with a metal overabundance of a factor of 100 , are needed to account for the observed intensities of orls . in a recent detailed analysis of the he  i recombination spectrum of a large sample of galactic pne , zhang et al .",
    "( 2005a ) concluded that a typical value of @xmath21 for the filling factor of hydrogen - deficient material is sufficient to explain the systematic difference between the electron temperatures determined from h  i recombination spectra and those deduced from the he  i orl ratios .",
    "the latter are found to be systematically lower than the former , consistent with the expectations of the two - abundance model but at odds with the traditional paradigms of temperature fluctuations and/or density inhomogeneities .",
    "the volume emissivity of a recombination line is proportional to the product of the densities of the emitting ions and of electrons and increases with decreasing temperature [ @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the density of recombining ions and @xmath24 .",
    "the total mass of h - deficient ( metal - rich ) material required to produce the observed strengths of orls can be determined if one knows the distance to the nebula as well as the electron temperature and density of the emitting gas .",
    "the distance to hf2 - 2 is poorly known .",
    "cahn & kaler ( 1971 ) and maciel ( 1984 ) gave estimates of 4.0 and 4.5kpc , respectively , based on the shklovsky method ( shklovsky 1956 ) .",
    "given the peculiar nature of hf2 - 2 , the method is unlikely to be valid .",
    "here we have simply adopted a nominal value of 4.25kpc .",
    "if we assume @xmath25  k , @xmath26@xmath27 ( c.f .  6.2 , table  4 and fig.5 ) , then from the observed intensity of the o  ii @xmath14649 line , we find a total number of o@xmath28 ions emitting the @xmath14649 orl of @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the distance to the nebula in kpc . after correcting for the ionic concentration in o@xmath16",
    ", the total mass of oxygen equals @xmath31@xmath32 . for hydrogen , if we assume @xmath33  k , @xmath34@xmath27 , as deduced from simultaneously fitting the observed h  i balmer discontinuity and decrement ( zhang et al . 2004 ) , we find @xmath35 , or a total mass of ionized hydrogen @xmath36@xmath32 .",
    "the latter is far less than the nominal total mass of ionized gas of 0.3@xmath32 for an optically thin pn , even after taking into account the contribution from helium .",
    "similarly , from the [ o  iii ] @xmath15007 forbidden line , assuming @xmath37  k , @xmath38@xmath27 ( c.f .  6.1 , table  3 ) , we find @xmath39 , or a total mass of oxygen of @xmath40@xmath32 .",
    "thus the amounts of metal in the cold h - deficient component and in the hot `` normal '' component are comparable .",
    "if we assume that the [ o  iii ] @xmath15007 forbidden line arises entirely from the hot gas , whereas the o  ii @xmath14649 recombination line originates exclusively from the cold component , then the total number of oxygen atoms in the nebula is simply the sum of those in the two components .",
    "this leads to an average o / h abundance for the _ whole _ nebula of @xmath41 , or , on a logarithmic scale where h = 12.00 , o = 8.73 , which is almost identical to the solar photospheric value of 8.69 .",
    "the o / h abundances of the hot and of the cold gas can not be determined individually unless one knows how to separate the contributions from the two components to the observed total flux of h@xmath6 .",
    "two scenarios have been proposed for the possible origins of the postulated h - deficient material ( liu 2003 ; 2005 ) : 1 ) nucleo - processed material ejected in a late helium flash as proposed for `` born - again '' pne such as abell30 and 78 ( iben , kaler & truran 1983 ) ; 2 ) icy material left over from the debris of planetary system of the progenitor star of the pn .",
    "it is also possible that pne exhibiting particularly large adf s , including those `` born - again '' pne , are related to the phenomenon of novae ( wesson et al .",
    "the last possibility is particularly attractive in view that hf2 - 2 is a known close binary system with an orbital period of only 0.398571days ( lutz et al .",
    "1998 ) and that the nebula has been suggested to result from a common envelope ejection event ( soker 1997 ; bond 2000 ) .",
    "further observations , in particular high spectral and spatial resolution spectroscopic observations using an integral field facility mounted on a large telescope , may prove critical to discriminate between these scenarios .",
    "we thank dr .",
    "r. corradi for providing access to the original [ o  iii ] and h@xmath42 images of hf2 - 2 published by schwarz et al .",
    "we would also like to thank dr .",
