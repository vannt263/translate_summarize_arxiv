    "the history of a cosmic ray from the production point and through the acceleration sites undergoes many changes in velocity and eventually in chemical structure .",
    "the nature of such a primary , either a heavy nucleus or proton or gamma - ray or whatever , influences strongly the byproduct of its interaction with the medium : interstellar matter , cosmic microwave background photons ( cmb ) or local interstellar / intergalactic / galactic magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "a great interest is therefore devoted to understanding the abundances of protons and relative chemical composition of the cr s flux , in terms of other elements or ions .",
    "+ among the various kinds of projectiles hitting the earth s atmosphere , we will consider the fragments deriving from the photo disintegration of heavy nuclei ( for example fe ) when interacting with the solar magnetic field @xcite : the crucial aspect of this fragmentation relies in the possibility of detecting on earth two ( or eventually more ) of them .",
    "in fact , the influence of the solar field permeates the space surrounding the sun up to distances limited to 3 or 4 au .",
    "this relatively small volume allows the fragments to arrive on earth almost simultaneously and spaced ranging some up to few thousands km .",
    "thus , the extensive air showers ( eas ) generated by the two projectiles when hitting the atmosphere would be temporally as well spatially correlated and detectable when having many detectors placed at different distances , some closely and some widely spaced .",
    "+ the arrival rate computed in the present paper heavily depends on the energy of the incoming particles and for this reason we include in our estimate small variations ( some units ) providing important differences in the expectation values . +",
    "what is strongly encouraging in the experimental search for this peculiar phenomena is the possibility of being detected by the new experiment `` extreme energy events '' ( eee ) which is starting in italy @xcite .",
    "in fact , the disposition of the particle detectors is planned inside numerous high schools over all the italian territory ( about 300.000 km@xmath0 ) , more densely inside the cities , from south to north .",
    "the study and the detection of ( ultra-)high energy crs in temporal coincidence is based on the energy of the primaries , the time difference between the two ( or more ) events , the reconstructed arrival directions , the possible source or set of sources .",
    "each of these patterns is strongly related to the others , and the accuracy in reconstructing a specific air shower puts forward experimental results paired with theoretical shortcomings .",
    "+ gerasimova and zatsepin @xcite , in the early sixties , proposed a theoretical prediction on large scale correlations : the so - called gz effect describes the disintegration of cr nuclei in the field of solar photons , leading to the formation of extended time - correlated eas pairs with core distances ( their estimate ) @xmath1 km .",
    "+ medina - tanco and watson @xcite have re - evaluated the background of solar photons , in view of a simple model for the solar radiation field and of the existing / planned ( at that time ) experiments ( like owl , agasa and auger ) .",
    "the estimates were limited by the blindness of the detectors during the earth s day side exposition , which is the condition for higher flux ( the former ) , the smallness of the array ( the second ) or the small acceptance for showers at large distances for the latter .",
    "basically , multiple correlated showers , temporally as well spatially , can arise either from local astrophysical events , on the distance scale of the solar system , or from exotic phenomena , @xmath2 ev air showers , which may require anomalous processes high in the atmosphere .",
    "+ the electromagnetic size @xmath3 and the muon number @xmath4 of a shower , depend differently on the energy and mass of the primary : these allow an estimate of @xmath5 and @xmath6 for each shower .",
    "qualitatively , since @xmath7 with @xmath8 , @xmath9 , heavy primaries can be selected choosing muon rich showers .",
    "evaluating @xmath3 , a proton shower can be associated to a small muon number , while the highest muon multiplicities are related to iron nuclei , therefore the measurement of @xmath6 for the single eas would be the definitive signature for the observation of a fragmentation process event .",
    "the photo disintegration @xcite of heavy nuclei with a photon background are dominantly in the channels @xmath10 , or @xmath11 being @xmath12 a nucleon , and most of the absorption cross section results in the emission of only single nucleons , either protons or neutrons , while pair production processes will not give rise to multiple primaries.the fragmentation process goes through the photo nuclear interaction with an individual nucleon , and refers to measurements and values of the nuclear - collision cross sections at energies lower than crs , so that could need corrections when applied to crs photo disintegration .",
    "+ the energy change is related to that of the atomic number as @xmath13 hence , for example , a fe nucleus losing a proton diminishes its energy of less than 2% .",
    "the most evident effect for single or multiple disintegrations off photon backgrounds ( of different kinds ) is a wide richer variety in chemical composition of crs flux , together with the protons one .",
    "the look for correlations between crs aims to distinguish some common features , such as the sources or their number and distribution , and the characteristics of the propagation to the earth .",
    "the first unusual simultaneous increase in the crs shower rate has been reported in 1983 @xcite ; an experiment devoted to the search for correlations between primaries has been proposed by carrel and martin in 1994 @xcite who wanted ( with no success ) to measure showers arising from multiple primaries originated by a hypothetical single ( or multiple ) event far from the earth .",
    "+ many experiments are running looking for uhecrs , but to date there are no stringent data about spatial or temporal clustering , apart from few signals from agasa @xcite and low statistics for anisotropies @xcite . a recent search for time correlated events",
    "is given by the chicos project @xcite , currently running in california high schools , covering an area of about 400 km@xmath0 , providing one observed candidate event , yet compatible with an accidental coincidence of independent showers .",
    "the large area air shower ( laas ) @xcite in japan has a shower array of about 130.000 km@xmath0 area ; the group reported one pair of eas with a very small time and angular difference .",
    "they found @xcite , four coincident event candidates , though with very low significance .",
    "the photodisintegration process can happen at various distances from earth , ranging about 0.04 au up to 4 au off the solar magnetic field @xcite .",
    "given a nucleus of mass @xmath14 and mass number @xmath6 , the lorentz factor is @xmath15 .",
    "then , an isotropic emission of nucleon(s ) in the reference system of the parent nucleus would result in a cone with aperture of @xmath16 around the original direction of propagation , when viewed in the reference system of the earth . for high values of the lorentz factor ( @xmath17 ) ,",
    "both fragments have exactly the same direction as the incoming nucleus , after the interaction with the photon : the fragments will proceed on their way almost parallel and will be deflected under the action of the magnetic field , depending on their charge , producing a core separation expected at earth that can be of the order of many kilometers .",
    "the further the disintegration takes place , the larger will be the distance between the fragments ( and of the produced showers ) when entering the atmosphere .",
    "+ we re - evaluate the rate of secondary crs , allowing a small energy variation of the parent primary and scanning all directions in the sky , night - side and day - side ( much more favorable ) , in view of ongoing and new experiments , such as eee @xcite , which , once in operation , can allow a consistent source of investigation for simultaneous showers over a wide range of distances , up to hundreds of kilometers away .",
    "+ given the mean free path of a nucleus against photo disintegration , the ratio @xmath18 between the flux @xmath19 of the gz fragment pairs and the unperturbed incoming one @xmath20 is related to the parameter @xmath21 , the average separation between the showers cores when arriving on the earth , spanning from about 1 to 2000 km .",
    "small values of @xmath21 refer to events originating in the vicinity of the earth , larger values refer to further distances .",
    "+ the eee project @xcite will cover a surface @xmath22 km@xmath0 . in principle",
    ", since the gz effect is for well spaced showers ( of the order of km or tens of ) , the whole array does not need to be very dense .",
    "+ let us consider a primary fe nucleus with energy varying between @xmath23 and @xmath24 ev .    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "the event rates are strongly dependent on the primary energy , as can be seen in the case of a very energetic one , since the flux varies accordingly by orders of magnitude",
    ". the fragments can generate showers over a wide range distances between them , from few to thousands km , thus not requiring a peculiarly spaced array of detectors , but moreover a large area .",
    "if we consider primaries with a given @xmath5 and flux , our calculations split essentially in two classes : the first relies on the events characterized by a large separation of fragments on earth @xmath25 km , i.e. events originated closer to the solar influence , at distances of order @xmath26 from the earth ; the second is given by a smaller separation of the fragments @xmath27 km , corresponding to primaries photo disintegrated at distances @xmath28 .",
    "+ considering a relatively modest variation for the incoming particle energy ( about few units ) and for the values computed for @xmath29 , we find that the rate of gz events expected can be effectively high ( see tables ) , leaving very promising work for the observation of the gz effect ."
