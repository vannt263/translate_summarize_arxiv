    "when we speak about free physical objects , e.g. classical particles , solid bodies , elementary particles , etc . , we always keep in mind that , although we consider them as free , they can not in principle be absolutely free .",
    "what is really understood under `` free object '' ( or more precisely `` relatively free object '' ) is , that some _ definite properties ( e.g. mass , velocity ) of the object under consideration do not change in time during its evolution under the influence of the existing environment_. the availability of such time - stable features of any physical object guarantees its _ identification _ during its existence in time .",
    "without such an availability of constant in time properties ( features ) , which are due to the object s resistance abilities , we could not speak about objects and knowledge at all .",
    "so , for example , a classical mass particle in external gravitational field is free with respect to its mass , and it is not free with respect to its behavior as a whole ( its velocity changes ) , because in classical mechanics formalism its mass does not change during the influence of the external field on its accelerated way of motion .",
    "the above view implies that three kinds of quantities will be necessary to describe as fully as possible the existence and the evolution of a given physical object :    \\1 . * proper ( identifying ) characteristics * , i.e. quantities which do not change during the entire existence of the object .",
    "the availability of such quantities allows to distinguish a physical object among the other ones",
    "* kinematical characteristics * , i.e. quantities , which describe the allowed space - time evolution , where `` allowed '' means _",
    "consistent with the constancy of the identifying characteristics_.    \\3 .",
    "* dynamical characteristics * , i.e. quantities which are functions ( explicit or implicit ) of the _ proper _ and of the _ kinematical _ characteristics .",
    "some of the dynamical characteristics have the following two important properties : they are * universal * , i.e. every physical object carries nonzero value of them ( e.g. energy - momentum ) , and they are * conservative * , i.e. they may just be transferred from one physical object to another ( in various forms ) but no loss is allowed .    hence , the evolution of a physical object subject to bearable / acceptable exterior influence ( perturbation ) , coming from the existing environment , has three aspects :    \\1 .",
    "_ constancy of the proper ( identifying ) characteristics _ ,    \\2 . _ allowed kinematical evolution _ , and    \\3 .",
    "_ exchange of dynamical quantities with the physical environment_.    if the physical object under consideration is space - extended ( continuous ) and is described by a many - component mathematical object we may talk about _ internal exchange _ of some dynamical characteristic among the various components of the object .",
    "for example , the electromagnetic field has two vector components @xmath0 and internal energy - momentum exchange between @xmath1 and @xmath2 should be considered as possible .",
    "the third feature suggests that the dynamical equations , describing locally the evolution of the object , may come from giving an explicit form of the quantities controlling the local internal and external exchange processes i.e. writing down corresponding local balance equations .",
    "hence , denoting the local quantities that describe the external exchange processes by @xmath3 , the object should be considered to be @xmath4-free , @xmath5 , if the corresponding integral values are time constant , which can be achieved only if @xmath4 obey differential equations presenting appropriately ( implicitly or explicitly ) corresponding local versions of the conservation laws ( continuity equations ) . in the case of absence of external exchange",
    "these equations should describe corresponding _ internal _ exchange processes .",
    "the corresponding evolution in this latter case may be called _ proper evolution_.    0.3 cm in trying to formalize these views we have to give some initial explicit formulations of some most basic features ( properties ) of what we call physical object , which features would lead us to a , more or less , adequate theoretical notion of our intuitive notion of a physical object . anyway , the following properties of the theoretical concept `` physical object '' we consider as necessary :    \\1 .",
    "it can be created .",
    "\\2 . it can be destroyed .",
    "it occupies finite 3-volumes at any moment of its existence , so it has structure .",
    "\\4 . it has a definite stability to withstand some external disturbances .",
    "it has definite conservation properties .",
    "it necessarily carries energy - momentum , and , possibly , other measurable ( conservative or nonconservative ) physical quantities .",
    "it exists in an appropriate environment ( called usually vacuum ) , which provides all necessary existence needs .",
    "it can be detected by the rest of the world through allowed energy - momentum exchanges .",
    "\\9 . it may combine with other appropriate objects to form new objects of higher level structure .",
    "its death gives necessarily birth to new objects following definite rules of conservation .",
    "0.3 cm * remark*. the property _ to be finite _ we consider as a very essential one .",
    "so , the above features do not allow the classical material points and the infinite classical fields ( e.g. plane waves ) to be considered as physical objects since the former have no structure and can not be destroyed , and the latter carry infinite energy , so they can not be created .",
    "hence , the born - infeld `` principle of finiteness '' stating that _ a satisfactory theory should avoid letting physical quantities become infinite _ , declared in [ 9 ] , may be strengthened as follows : _ all real physical objects are spatially finite entities and no infinite values of the physical quantities carried by them are allowed_.    0.2 cm clearly , together with the purely qualitative features physical objects carry important quantitatively described physical properties , and any external interaction may be considered as an exchange of such quantities provided both the object and the environment carry them .",
    "hence , the more universal is a physical quantity the more useful for us it is , and this moment determines the exclusively important role of energy - momentum , which modern physics considers as the most universal one , i.e. every physical object necessarily carries energy - momentum .    from pure formal point of view",
    "a description of the evolution of a given continuous physical object must include obligatory two mathematical objects :    * 1 .",
    "first * , the mathematical object @xmath6 which is meant to represent as fully as possible the integrity of the object under consideration , and when subject to appropriate operators , @xmath6 must reproduce explicitly all important information about the _ structure _ and admissible _ dynamical evolution _ of the physical object ;    * 2 .",
    "second * , the mathematical object @xmath7 which represents the admissible changes , where @xmath8 is appropriately chosen differential operator acting mainly on the kinematical and dynamical characteristics . if @xmath8 does not depend on @xmath6 and its derivatives , and",
    "so , on the corresponding proper characteristics of @xmath6 , the relation @xmath9 then would mean that those kinematical and dynamical properties of @xmath6 , which feel the action of @xmath8 , are constant with respect to @xmath8 , so the evolution prescribed by @xmath9 , would have `` constant '' character and would say nothing about possible changes of those characteristics , which do not feel @xmath8 .    from principle point of view",
    ", it does not seem so important if the changes @xmath7 are zero , or not zero , the _ significantly important _ point is that the _ changes @xmath7 are admissible_. the changes @xmath7 are admissible in the following two cases : * first * , when related to the very object @xmath6 through some `` projection '' @xmath10 upon @xmath6 , the `` projections '' @xmath11 vanish , and then the object is called _ free _ ( with respect to those characteristics which feel @xmath8 ) ; * second * , when the projections @xmath11 do not vanish , but the object still survives , then the object is called _ not free _ ( with respect to the same characteristics ) . in the first case the corresponding admissible changes @xmath7 have to be considered as having an _ intrinsic _ for the object nature , and they should be generated by some _ necessary _ for the very existence of the object _",
    "internal _ energy - momentum redistribution during evolution ( recall point 6 of the above stated 10 properties of a physical object ) . in the second case",
    "the admissible changes @xmath7 , in addition to the intrinsic factors , depend also on external factors , so , the corresponding projections @xmath11 should describe explicitly or implicitly some energy - momentum exchange with the environment .    following this line of considerations",
    "we come to a conclusion that every description of a free physical object must include some mathematical expression of the kind @xmath12 , specifying ( through the additional quantities @xmath13 ) what and how changes , and specifying also what is projected and how it is projected .",
    "if the object is not free but it survives when subject to the external influence , then it is very important the quantity @xmath14 to have , as much as possible , universal character and to present a change of a conservative quantity , so that this same quantity to be expressible through the characteristics @xmath15 of the external object(s ) .",
    "hence , specifying differentially some conservation / balance properties of the object under consideration , and specifying at every space - time point the corresponding admissible exchange process with the environment through the equation @xmath16 we obtain corresponding equations of motion being consistent with the corresponding integral conservation properties .    in accordance with these considerations",
    "it seems reasonable to note also that this two - sided _ change - conservation _ nature of a physical object could be mathematically interpreted in terms of the _ integrability - nonintegrability _ properties of a system of pde .",
    "in fact , according to the frobenius integrability theorems ( see sec.9 ) , integrability means that every lie bracket of two vector fields of the corresponding differential system is linearly expressible through the vector fields generating the very system , so , the corresponding curvature is zero and _ nothing flows out of the system_. from physical point of view this would mean that such physical objects are difficult to study , because , strictly speaking , they seem to be strictly isolated , and , therefore , unobservable .",
    "when subject to appropriate external perturbation they lose isolation , so they are no more integrable , and have to transform to other physical objects , which demonstrate _ new integrability _ properties .    on the contrary",
    ", nonintegrability means nonzero curvature , so there are _ outside directed lie brackats _",
    "@xmath17 $ ] ( called usually _ vertical projections _ ) of the generators of the differential system , and the correspondig flows of these lie brackets carry the points of the expected integral manifold out of it , so , _ something is possible to flow out of the system_. these sticking out lie brackets look like system s tools , or `` tentakles '' , which carry out the necessary for its very existence contacts with the rest of the world .",
    "we can say that namely these `` nonintegrability '' features of the physical system makes it accessible to be studied .",
    "figuratively speaking , `` the nonintegrability properties protect and support the integrability properties '' of the system , so these both kind of properties are important for the system s existence , and their coavailability / coexistence demonstrates the dual nature of physical systems .",
    "we note that this viewpoint assumes somehow , that for an accessible to study time - stable physical system it is in principle expected both , appropriate _",
    "integrable _ and _ nonintegrable _ differential / pfaff systems to be associated . and",
    "this fits quite well with the structure of a fiber bundle : as we know , _ the vertical subbundle _ of a fiber bundle _ is always integrable _ with integral manifolds the corresponding fibers ; _ a horizontal subbundle _ chosen",
    "_ may carry nonzero curvature _ , and this curvature characterizes the system s properties that make possible some local studies to be performed .",
    "we recall that this idea of _ change - conservation _ has been used firstly by newton in his momentum balance equation @xmath18 which is the restriction of the nonlinear partial differential system @xmath19 , or @xmath20 , on some trajectory .",
    "this newton s system of equations just says that there are physical objects in nature which admit the `` point - like '' approximation , and which can exchange energy - momentum with `` the rest of the world '' but keep unchanged some other of their properties , and this allows these objects to be identified in space - time and studied as a whole , i.e. as point - like ones .",
    "the corresponding `` tentakles '' of these objects seem to carry out contacts with the rest of the world by means of energy - momentum exchange .    in macrophysics , as a rule ,",
    "the external influences are such that they do not destroy the system , and in microphysics a full restructuring is allowed : the old ingredients of the system may fully transform to new ones , ( e.g. the electron - positron annihilation ) provided the energy - momentum conservation holds .",
    "the essential point is that _ whatever the interaction is , it always results in appearing of relatively stable objects , carrying energy - momentum and some other particular physically measurable quantities_. this conclusion emphasizes once again the importance of having an adequate notion of what is called a physical object , and of its appropriate mathematical representation .",
    "modern science requires a good adequacy between the real objects and the corresponding mathematical model objects .",
    "so , the mathematical model objects @xmath6 must necessarily be spatially finite , and even temporally finite if the physical object considered has by its intrinsic nature finite life - time .",
    "this most probably means that @xmath6 must satisfy nonlinear partial differential equation(s ) , which should define in a consistent way the _",
    "admissible _ changes and the _ conservation _ properties of the object under consideration .",
    "hence , talking about physical objects we mean time - stable spatially finite entities which have a well established balance between change and conservation , and this balance is kept by a permanent and strictly fixed interaction with the environment .",
    "this notion of a ( finite continuous ) physical object sets the problem to try to consider and represent its integral characteristics through its local dynamical properties , i.e. to try to understand its nature and integral appearance as determined and caused by its dynamical structure .",
    "the integral appearance of the local features may take various forms , in particular , it might influence the spatial structure of the object . in view of this , the propagational behavior of the object as a whole , considered in terms of its local translational and rotational components of propagation , which , in turn , should be related to the internal energy - momentum redistribution during propagation , could be stably consistent only with some distinguished spatial structures .",
    "we note that the local rotational components of propagation not always produce integral rotation of the object , but if they are available , time stable , and consistent with the translational components of propagation , some specific conserved quantity should exist . and",
    "if the rotational component of propagation shows some consistent with the object s spatial structure periodicity , clearly , the corresponding frequency may be used to introduce such a quantity .",
    "finally we note that the rotational component of propagation of a ( continuous finite ) physical object may be of two different origins : _ relative _ and _ intrinsic_. in the `` relative '' case the corresponding physical quantity , called _ angular momentum _ , depends on the choice of some _ external _ to the system factors , usually these are _ relative axis _ and _ relative point_. in the `` intrinsic '' case the rotational component ( if it is not zero ) is meant to carry intrinsic information about the system considered , so , the corresponding physical quantity , usually called _ spin _ , should not depend on any external factors .    as an idealized ( mathematical ) example of an object",
    "as outlined above , let s consider a spatial region @xmath8 of one - step piece of a helical cylinder with some proper ( or internal ) diameter @xmath21 , and let @xmath8 be winded around some straightline axis @xmath22 .",
    "let at some ( initial ) moment @xmath23 our mathematical model - object @xmath6 be different from zero only inside @xmath8 .",
    "let now at @xmath24 the object @xmath6 , i.e. the region @xmath8 , begin moving as a whole along the helical cylinder with some constant along @xmath22 ( translational ) velocity @xmath25 in such a way that every point of @xmath8 follows its own ( helical ) trajectory around @xmath22 and never crosses the ( helical ) trajectory of any other point of @xmath8 .",
    "obviously , the rotational component of propagation is available , but the object does not rotate as a whole . moreover , since the translational velocity @xmath25 along @xmath22 is constant , the spatial periodicity @xmath26 , i.e. the height of @xmath8 along @xmath22 , should be proportional to the time periodicity @xmath27 , and for the corresponding frequency @xmath28 we obtain @xmath29 .",
    "clearly , this is an idealized example of an object with a space - time consistent dynamical structure , but any physical interpretation would require to have explicitly defined @xmath8 , @xmath6 , corresponding dynamical equations , local and integral conserved quantities , @xmath26 , @xmath25 and , probably , some other parameters .",
    "we shall show that in the frame of eed such finite solutions of photon - like nature do exist and can be explicitly written ( see the pictures on pp.62 - 63 ) .",
    "the 19th century physics , due mainly to faraday and maxwell , created the theoretical concept of _ classical field _ as a model of a class of spatially continuous ( extended ) physical objects having dynamical structure . as a rule",
    ", the corresponding _ free fields _ are considered to satisfy linear dynamical equations , and the corresponding time dependent solutions are in most cases _ infinite_. the most important examples seem to be the free electromagnetic fields , which satisfy the charge - free maxwell equations .",
    "the concepts of _ flux of a vector field through a 2-dimensional surface _ and _ circulation of a vector field along a closed curve _ were coined and used extensively .",
    "maxwell s equations in their integral form establish where the time - changes of the fluxes of the electric and magnetic fields go to , or come from , in both cases of a closed 2-surface and a 2-surface with a boundary .",
    "we note that these fluxes are specific to the continuous character of the physical object under consideration and it is important also to note that * maxwell s field equations have not the sense of direct energy - momentum balance relations as the newton s law @xmath30 has*. nevertheless , they are consistent with energy - momentum conservation in finite regions , as it is well known , but they impose much stronger requirements on the field components , so , the class of admissible solutions is much more limited than the local conservation equations would admit .",
    "moreover , from qualitative point of view , the electromagnetic induction experiments show that a definite quantity of the field energy - momentum is transformed to mechanical energy - momentum carried away by the charged particles , but , on the contrary , the corresponding differential equation does not allow such energy - momentum transfer ( see further ) .",
    "hence , the introduced by newton basic approach to derive dynamics from local energy - momentum balance equations had been left off , and this step is still respected today .    talking about description of _ free _ fields by means of differential equations we mean that these equations must describe locally the _ intrinsic _ dynamics of the field , so no boundary conditions or any other external influence should be present .",
    "the pure field maxwell equations ( although very useful for considerations in finite regions with boundary conditions ) have time - dependent vacuum solutions ( i.e free - field solutions , so , solutions in the whole space ) that give an inadequate description of the real free fields . as a rule ,",
    "if these solutions are time - stable , they occupy the whole 3-space or an infinite subregion of it , and they do not go to zero at infinity , hence , they carry _ infinite _ energy and momentum . as an example we recall the ( transverse with zero invariants ) plane wave solution , given by the electric and magnetic fields of the form @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are arbitrary differentiable functions .",
    "even if @xmath32 and @xmath33 are soliton - like with respect to the coordinate @xmath34 , they do not depend on the other two spatial coordinates @xmath35 .",
    "hence , the solution occupies the whole @xmath36 , or its infinite subregion , and clearly it carries infinite integral energy @xmath37 in particular , the popular harmonic plane wave @xmath38 clearly occupies the whole 3-space , carries infinite energy @xmath39 and , therefore , could hardly be a model of a really created field , i.e. of really existing field objects .",
    "we recall also that , according to poisson s theorem for the dalembert wave equation ( which equation is necessarily satisfied by every component of @xmath1 and @xmath2 in the pure field case ) , a spatially finite and smooth enough initial field configuration is strongly time - unstable [ 1 ] : the initial condition blows up radially and goes to infinity .",
    "hence , maxwell s equations _ can not describe spatially finite and time - stable time - dependent free field configurations with soliton - like behavior_. the contradictions between theory and experiment that became clear at the end of the 19th century were a challenge to theoretical physics .",
    "planck and einstein created the notion of _ elementary field quanta _",
    ", named later by lewis [ 2 ] the _ photon_. the concept of _ photon _ proved to be adequate enough and very seminal , and has been widely used in the 20th century physics . however , even now , after a century , we still do not have a complete and satisfactory self - consistent theory of single ( or individual ) photons .",
    "it is worth recalling at this point the einstein s remarks of dissatisfaction concerning the linear character of maxwell theory which makes it not able to describe the microstructure of radiation [ 3 ] . along this line",
    "we may also note here some other results , opinions and nonlinearizations [ 4]-[14 ] .    according to the non - relativistic formulation of classical electrodynamics ( ced ) the electromagnetic field has two aspects : _ electric _ and _ magnetic_. these two aspects of the field are described by two vector fields , or by the corresponding through the euclidean metric 1-forms , on @xmath36 : the electric field @xmath40 and the magnetic field @xmath41 , and a parametric dependence of @xmath40 and @xmath42 on time is admitted .",
    "maxwell s equations read ( with @xmath43 - the electric current and in gauss units )    @xmath44    @xmath45    the pure field equations are @xmath46 @xmath47 the first of equations ( 2 ) is meant to represent mathematically the results of electromagnetic induction experiments .",
    "but , it does not seem to have done it quite adequately .",
    "in fact , as we mentioned earlier , these experiments and studies show that _ field energy - momentum is transformed to mechanical energy - momentum _ , so that the corresponding material bodies ( magnet needles , conductors , etc . )",
    "change their state of motion .",
    "the vector equation ( 2 ) , which is assumed to hold inside all media , including the vacuum , manifests different feature , namely , it gives no information about any field energy - momentum transformation to mechanical one in this way : the time change of @xmath2 is compensated by the spatial nonhomogenity of @xmath1 , in other words , this is an intrinsic dynamic property of the field and it has nothing to do with any direct energy - momentum exchange with other physical systems .",
    "this is quite clearly seen in the relativistic formulation of equations ( 2 ) and the divergence of the stress - energy - momentum tensor ( see further eqns .",
    "( 8)-(9 ) ) .",
    "this interpretation of the electromagnetic induction experiments has had a very serious impact on the further development of field theory .",
    "the dual vector equation ( 3 ) , introduced by maxwell through the so called `` displacement current '' , completes the time - dependent differential description of the field inside the frame of ced .",
    "the two additional equations @xmath48 impose restrictions on the admissible spatial configurations ( initial conditions , spatial shape ) in the pure field case .",
    "the usual motivation for these last two equations is that there are no magnetic charges , and no electric charges are present inside the region under consideration .",
    "this interpretation is also much stronger than needed : a vector field may have non - zero divergence even if it has no singularities , i.e. points where it is not defined , e.g. the vector field @xmath49 has no singularities and is not divergence - free .",
    "the approximation for continuously distributed electric charge , i.e. @xmath50 , does not justify the divergence - free case @xmath51 , on the contrary , it is consistent with the latter , since no non - zero divergences are allowed outside of the continuous charge distribution .",
    "all these clearly unjustified by the experiment and additionally tacitly imposed requirements lead , in our opinion , to an inadequate mathematical formulation of the observational facts : as we mentioned above , a mathematical consequence of ( 3)-(4 ) is that every component @xmath52 of the field _ necessarily _ satisfies the wave dalembert equation @xmath53 , which is highly undesirable in view of the required by this equation `` blow up '' of the physically sensible initial conditions ( see the comments in the next section ) .",
    "another feature of the vacuum maxwell system ( 3)-(4 ) , which brings some feeling of dissatisfaction ( especially to the mathematically inclined physicists ) is the following .",
    "let s consider @xmath1 and @xmath2 as 1-forms on the manifold @xmath54 with coordinates @xmath55 .",
    "it seems natural to expect that every solution to ( 3)-(4 ) would define completely integrable pfaff system @xmath0 .",
    "for example , the plane wave solution given above defines such a completely integrable pfaff system , which is easy to check through verifying the relations @xmath56 with the plane wave @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "now , if we change slightly this plane wave @xmath1 to @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and keep the same plane wave @xmath2 , the new couple @xmath59 will give again vacuum solution , but will no more define completely integrable pfaff system , since we obtain @xmath60 @xmath61 these expressions are different from zero in the general case , i.e. for arbitrary functions @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "as for the charge - present case , i.e. equations ( 1)-(2 ) , some dissatisfaction of a quite different nature arises .",
    "in fact , every mathematical equation @xmath62 means that @xmath63 and @xmath64 are different notations for the same element , in other words , it means that on the two sides of `` = '' stays * the same mathematical object * , but expressed in two different forms .",
    "so , every physically meaningful equation _ necessarily _ implies that _ the physical nature of @xmath63 and @xmath64 * must * be the same_. for example , the newton s law @xmath18 equalizes * the same change of momentum * expressed in two ways : through the characteristics of the particle , and through the characteristics of the external field , and this energy - momentum exchange does not destroy neither the particle nor the field .",
    "now we ask : which physical quantity , that is well defined as a local characteristic of the field @xmath65 , as well as a local characteristic of the charged particles , is represented simultaneously through the field s derivatives as @xmath66 , and through the characteristics of the charged particles as @xmath67 ?",
    "all known experiments show that the field @xmath65 , considered as a physical object , can not carry electric charge , only mass objects may be carriers of electric charge .",
    "so , from this ( physical ) point of view @xmath66 should never be made equal to @xmath67 , these two quantities have different physical nature and can not be equivalent .",
    "equations ( 1 ) may be considered as acceptable only if they formally , i.e. without paying attention to their physical nature , present some sufficient condition for another properly from physical point of view justified relation to hold .",
    "for example , the relativistic version of ( 1 ) is given by @xmath68 , and it is sufficient for the relation @xmath69 to hold , but both sides of this last equation have the same physical nature ( namely , energy momentum change ) , therefore , it seems better justified and more reliable .",
    "note , however , that an admission of this last equation means that the very concept of electromagnetic field , _ considered as independent physical object _",
    ", has been drastically changed ( extended ) , e.g. it propagates no more with the velocity of light which is a _ lorentz - invariant property_. in our view , in such a case , any solution @xmath70 represents just one aspect , the electromagnetic one , of a very complicated physical system and should not be considered as electromagnetic field in the proper sense , i.e. as a physical object .",
    "the important observation at such a situation is that the adequacy of maxwell description is established experimentally not directly through the field equations , but indirectly , mainly through the corresponding lorentz force , i.e. through the local energy - momentum consevation law .",
    "therefore , it seems naturally to pass to a direct energy - momentum description , i.e to extend maxwell equations to energy - momentum exchange equations , and in this way to overcome the above mentioned physically qualitative difference between @xmath66 and @xmath67 .    in this paper",
    "we present a concise review of the newly developed _ extended electrodynamics _ ( eed ) [ 15]-[20 ] , which was built in trying to find such a reasonable nonlinear extension of maxwell equations together with paying the corresponding respect to the * soliton - like view * on the structure of the electromagnetic field",
    ". in the free field case eed follows the rules :    \\1 .",
    "no new objects should be introduced in the new equations .",
    "the maxwell energy - momentum quantities should be kept the same , and the local conservation relations together with their symmetry ( see further relation ( 7 ) ) should hold .",
    "so , the first main goal of eed is , of course , to give a consistent field description of _ single time - stable and spatially finite free - field configurations that show a consistent translational - rotational propagation as their intrinsic property_. as for the electromagnetic fields interacting continuously with some classical medium , i.e. a medium carrying continuous _ bounded _ electric charges and magnetic moments , and having abilities to _ polarize _ and _ magnetize _ when subject to external electromagnetic field , as we mentioned above , our opinion is that the very concept of electromagnetic field in such cases is quite different .",
    "the observed macro - phenomena concerning properties and propagation may have very little to do with those of the free fields .",
    "we are not even sure that such fields may be considered as physical objects ( in the sense considered in sec.1.1 to this paper ) , and to expect appearance of some kind of _ proper _ dynamics .",
    "the very complicated nature of such systems seems hardly to be fully described at elementary level , where at every space - time micro - region so many `` annihilation - creation '' elementary acts are performed , the exchanged energy - momentum acquires mechanical degrees of freedom , the entropy change becomes significant , some reorganization of the medium may take place and new , not electromagnetic , processes may start off , etc .",
    "so , the nature of the field - object that survives during these continuous `` annihilation - creation '' events is , in our view , very much different from the one we know as electromagnetic free field ; the corresponding solution @xmath70 may be considered just as a seriously transformed image of the latter , and it is just one component of a many - component system , and , in some cases , even not the most important one . shortly speaking ,",
    "the free field solutions are meant to represent physical objects , while the other solutions represent just some aspects of a much more complicated physical system . in our view , only some macro - picture of what really happens at micro - level we should try to obtain through solving the corresponding equations . and",
    "this picture could be the closer to reality , the more adequate to reality are our free field notions and the energy - momentum balance equations .",
    "that s why the emphasis in our approach is on the internal energy - momentum redistribution in the free field case .    as for the 4-potential approach to maxwell equations we recall that in the vacuum case the two equations @xmath71 , considered on topologically non - trival regions , admit solutions having no 4-potentials .",
    "for example , the field of a point source is given by ( in spherical coordinates originating at the source ) @xmath72 and is defined on @xmath73 .",
    "now the new couple @xmath74 with @xmath75 is a solution admitting no 4-potential on @xmath76 .",
    "this remark suggests that the 4-potential does not seem to be a fundamental quantity .    turning back to the free field case we note that , in accordance with the soliton - like view , which we more or less assume and shall try to follow ,",
    "the components of the field at every moment @xmath77 have to be represented by * smooth * , i.e. nonsingular , functions , different from zero , or concentrated , only inside a finite 3-dimensional region @xmath78 , and this must be achieved by the nonlinearization assumed .",
    "moreover , we have to take care for the various spatial configurations to be admissible , so , it seems desirable the nonlinearization to admit time - stable solutions with _ arbitrary _ initial spatial shape . finally , the observed space - time periodical nature of the electromagnetic radiation ( the planck s formula @xmath79 in case of photons ) requires the new nonlinear equations to be able to describe such a periodical nature together with the corresponding frequency dependence during propagation .",
    "the above remarks go along with einstein s view that `` the whole theory must be based on partial differential equations and their singularity - free solutions '' [ 21 ] .",
    "0.5 cm    the above mentioned idea , together with the assumption for a different interpretation of the concept of field : first , considered as independent physical object ( field in vacuum ) , and second , considered in presence of external charged matter , is strongly supported by the fact that maxwell s equations together with the lorentz force give very good and widely accepted expressions for the energy density @xmath80 , the momentum density ( the poynting vector ) @xmath81 , and for the intra - field energy - momentum exchange during propagation - the poynting equation : @xmath82    let s consider now the dalembert wave equarion @xmath83 .",
    "a solution of this equation , meant to describe a finite field configuration with arbitrary spatial structure and moving as a whole along some spatial direction , which we choose for @xmath34-coodinate , would look like as @xmath84 , where @xmath52 is a bounded finite with respect to @xmath85 function . substituting this @xmath52 in the equation ,",
    "clearly , the second derivatives of @xmath52 with respect to @xmath34 and @xmath77 will cancel each other , so , the equation requires @xmath52 to be a harmonic function with respect to @xmath86 . according to the liouville theorem in the theory of harmonic functions on @xmath87 if a harmonic on the whole @xmath87 function is bounded it must be constant . therefore , @xmath52 shall not depend on @xmath35 , i.e. @xmath88 .",
    "considering now the poynting equation we ll find that it really * admits * spatially finite solutions with soliton - like propagation along the direction chosen .",
    "in fact , it is immediately verified that if in the above given plane wave expressions for @xmath1 and @xmath2 we allow arbitrary dependence of @xmath32 and @xmath33 on the three spatial coordinates @xmath85 , i.e. @xmath89 , then the corresponding @xmath1 and @xmath2 will satisfy the poynting equation and will not satisfy maxwell s vacuum equations .",
    "so , the poynting equation is able to describe collections of co - moving photons , which may be considered classically as spatially finite radiation pulses with photon - like behavior .",
    "such finite pulses do not `` blow up ''",
    "radially , so , this suggests to look for new dynamical equations which also must be consistent with the maxwell local conservation quantities and laws .",
    "hence , if the equations we look for should be consistent with the photon structure of electromagnetic radiation , i.e. with the view that any em - pulse consists of a collection of _ real spatially finite objects , and each one propagates as a whole in accordance with the energy - momentum that it has been endowed with in the process of its creation _ , we have to find new field equations .",
    "we begin now the process of extension of maxwell equations .",
    "first , we specially note the well known invariance , usually called _ electric - magnetic duality _ , of the pure field equations ( 3)-(4 ) with respect to the transformation @xmath90 the first couple ( 3 ) is transformed into the second one ( 4 ) , and vice versa . hence , instead of assuming equations ( 4 ) we could require invariance of ( 3 ) with respect to the transformation ( 6 ) . moreover , the energy density @xmath91 , the poynting vector @xmath81 , as well as the poynting relation are also invariant with respect to this transformation .",
    "this symmetry property of maxwell equations we consider as a _ structure one _ and we ll make a serious use of it .",
    "the above symmetry transformation ( 6 ) is extended to the more general duality transformation @xmath92 note tnat we assume a `` right action '' of the matrix @xmath93 on the couple @xmath0 .",
    "the couple @xmath94 gives again a solution to maxwell vacuum equations , the new energy density and poynting vector are equal to the old ones multiplied by @xmath95 , and the poynting equation is satisfied of course .",
    "hence , the space of all vacuum solutions factors over the action of the group of matrices of the kind @xmath96 all such matrices with nonzero determinant form a group with respect to the usual matrix product and further this group will be denoted by @xmath97 .",
    "this invariance is very important from the point of view of passing to equations having direct energy - momentum exchange sense .",
    "in fact , in the vacuum case the lorentz force @xmath98\\ ] ] should be equal to zero for every solution , so , the transformed @xmath94 must give also zero lorentz force for every couple @xmath99 .",
    "this observation will bring us later to the new vacuum equations .    in the relativistic formulation of ced",
    "the difference between the electric and magnetic components of the field is already quite conditional , and from the invariant - theoretical point of view there is no any difference .",
    "however , the 2-aspect ( or the 2-component ) character of the field is kept in a new sense and manifests itself at a different level . to show this we go to minkowski space - time @xmath100 , spanned by the standard",
    "coordinates @xmath101 with the pseudometric @xmath102 having components @xmath103 , and @xmath104 for @xmath105 in these coordinates .",
    "we shall use also the hodge star operator , defined by @xmath106 where @xmath93 and @xmath107 are differential forms on @xmath100 . with this definition of @xmath108",
    "we obtain for a 2-form @xmath70 in canonical coordinates @xmath109 .",
    "the exterior derivative @xmath110 and the hodge @xmath108 combine to give the coderivative ( or divergence ) operator @xmath111 , which in our case reduces to @xmath112 , and on 2-forms we have @xmath113 . note that , reduced on 2-forms , the hodge @xmath108-operator induces a complex structure : @xmath114 , and the same property has transformation ( 6 ) .",
    "explicitly , @xmath70 and @xmath115 look as follows : @xmath116 @xmath117",
    "so , if the non - relativistic vector couple @xmath118 corresponds to the relativistic 2-form @xmath70 , then the transformed by transformation ( 6 ) couple @xmath119 obviously corresponds to the relativistic 2-form @xmath115 .",
    "hence , the hodge @xmath108 is the relativistic image of transformation ( 6 ) .",
    "recall now the relativistic energy - momentum tensor , which can be represented in the following two equivalent forms ( see the end of this section ) : @xmath120= \\frac { 1}{8\\pi}\\biggl[-f_{\\mu\\sigma}f^{\\nu\\sigma}-                   % 8% ( * f)_{\\mu\\sigma}(*f)^{\\nu\\sigma}\\biggr].\\ ] ] it is quite clearly seen , that @xmath70 and @xmath115 participate in the same way in @xmath121 , so @xmath121 is invariant with respect to @xmath122 and the full energy - momentum densities of the field are obtained through summing up the energy - momentum densities , carried by @xmath70 and @xmath115 .",
    "that is how the above mentioned invariance of the energy density and poynting vector look like in the relativistic formalism .",
    "now , the poynting relation corresponds to the zero - divergence of @xmath121 : @xmath123=0.\\ ] ] the obvious invariance of the poynting relation with respect to ( 6 ) corresponds here to the invariance of ( 9 ) with respect to the hodge @xmath108 .",
    "moreover , the above relation ( 9 ) obviously suggests that the field is potentially able to exchange energy - momentum through @xmath70 , as well as through @xmath115 independently , provided appropriate external field - object is present .",
    "now , the idea of the generalization ced@xmath124eed could be formulated as follows .",
    "the above mentioned momentum balance interpretation of the second newton s law @xmath125 says : the momentum gained by the particle is lost by the external field , this is the _ true _ sense of this relation .",
    "if there is no external field , then @xmath126 , and giving the explicit form of the particle momentum @xmath127 we obtain the equations of motion @xmath128 of a free particle , implying @xmath129 . the same argument should work with respect to the field : if there is no particles then @xmath130 , @xmath131 and @xmath132 , so , we must obtain the equations of motion ( at least one of them ) for the free field : @xmath133 , after we give the explicit form of the dependence of @xmath134 on the field functions and their derivatives . in other words ,",
    "* we have to determine in terms of the field functions and their derivatives how much energy - momentum the field is potentially able to transfer to another physical system in case of the presence of the latter and its ability to interact with the field , i.e. to accept the corresponding energy - momentum*.    following this idea in non - relativistic terms we have to compute the expression @xmath135\\ ] ] making use of maxwell equations ( 1)-(2 ) , and to put the result equal to zero . in the free field case @xmath136 .",
    "the corresponding relation may be found in the textbooks ( for example see [ 22 ] , ch.6 , paragraph 9 ) and it reads @xmath137 in the frame of maxwell theory the first two terms on the left of ( 10 ) give the lorentz force in field terms , so , in the free field case we must have @xmath138 hence , it follows now from ( 10 ) and ( 11 ) that we must also have @xmath139 if we forget now about the sourceless maxwell equations ( 3)-(4 ) we may say that these two * nonlinear * vector equations ( 11)-(12 ) describe locally some _ intrinsic _ energy - momentum redistribution during the propagation .    in order to have the complete local picture of the intrinsic energy - momentum redistribution we must take also in view terms of the following form : @xmath140 a reliable approach to obtain",
    "the right expression seems to be the same invariance with respect to the transformation ( 7 ) to hold for ( 11)-(12 ) .",
    "this gives the additional vector equation : @xmath141    the above consideration may be put in the following way . according to our approach , the more important aspects of the field from the point of view to write its proper dynamical equations are its abilities to exchange energy - momentum with the rest of the world : after finding out the corresponding quantities which describe quantitatively these abilities we put them equal to zero .",
    "the important moment in such an approach is to have an adequate notion of the mathematical nature of the field .",
    "the dual symmetry of maxwell equations suggests that in the nonrelativistic formalism the mathematical nature of the field is 1-form @xmath142 on @xmath36 with values in an appropriate 2-dimensional vector space @xmath143 with the basis @xmath144 , where the group @xmath97 acts as linear transformations .",
    "in fact , if @xmath145 , then consider the new basis @xmath146 given by @xmath147 accordingly , @xmath148 transforms the basis through right action by means of @xmath149",
    ". then the `` new '' solution @xmath150 is , in fact , the `` old '' solution @xmath151 : @xmath152 i.e. , the `` new '' solution @xmath150 , represented in the new basis @xmath146 coincides with the `` old '' solution @xmath151 , represented in the old basis @xmath144 .    in view of this",
    "we may consider transformations ( 7 ) as _ nonessential _",
    ", i.e. we may consider @xmath0 and @xmath153 as two different representations in corresponding bases of @xmath143 of the same solution @xmath154 , and the two bases are connected with appropriate element of @xmath97 .",
    "such an interpretation is approporiate and useful if the field shows some _ invariant properties _ with respect to this class of transformations .",
    "we shall show further that the _ nonlinear _ solutions of ( 11)-(13 ) do have such invariant properties .",
    "for example , if the field has _",
    "zero invariants _",
    "( the so called `` null field '' ) : @xmath155 then all transformations ( 7 ) keep unchanged these zero - values of @xmath156 and @xmath157 . in fact , under the transformation ( 7 ) the two invariants transform in the following way : @xmath158 and the determinant of this transformation is @xmath159 .",
    "so , a null field stays a null field under the dual transformations ( 7 ) .",
    "moreover , no non - null field can be transformed to a null field by means of transformations ( 7 ) , and , conversely , no null field can be transformed to a non - null field in this way .",
    "further we shall show that the `` null fields '' admit also other @xmath97-invariant properties being closely connected with availability of rotational component of propagation .    from this @xmath97-_covariant _ point of view",
    ", the well known lorentz force appears to be just one component of the corresponding covariant with respect to transformations ( 7 ) , or to the group @xmath97 , _",
    "@xmath97-covariant lorentz force_.",
    "so , in order to obtain this @xmath97-covariant lorentz force we have to replace @xmath1 and @xmath2 in the expression @xmath160 by @xmath153 given by ( 7 ) . in the vacuum case ,",
    "i.e. when the field keeps its integral energy - momentum unchanged , the @xmath97-covariant lorentz force @xmath161 obtained must be zero for any values @xmath99 of the transformation parameters .",
    "after the corresponding computation we obtain @xmath162 + b^2\\left[\\left(\\mathrm{rot}\\,\\mathbf{e}+ \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{b}}{\\partial \\xi}\\right ) \\times\\mathbf{e}+\\mathbf{b}\\,\\mathrm{div}\\,\\mathbf{b}\\right]+\\ ] ] @xmath163=0.\\ ] ] note that the @xmath164 lorentz force @xmath161 has three vector components given by the quantities in the brackets . since the constants @xmath99 are arbitrary the equations ( 11)-(13 ) follow .    another formal way to come to equations ( 11)-(13 ) is the following .",
    "consider a 2-dimensional real vector space @xmath143 with basis @xmath144 , and the objects @xmath165 @xmath166 now define a new object by means of the bilinear maps `` vector product @xmath167 '' , `` symmetrized tensor product @xmath168 '' and usual product of vector fields and functions ( denoted by `` .

    "the left hand sides of equations ( 11)-(13 ) , i.e. the components of the 3-dimensional ( nonrelativistic ) @xmath97-covariant lorentz force @xmath161 , define three vector quantities of energy - momentum change , which appear to be the field s tools controlling the energy - momentum exchange process during interaction .",
    "we can also say that these three terms define locally the energy - momentum which the field is potentially able to give to some other physical system , so , the field demonstrates three different abilities of possible energy - momentum exchange .",
    "obviously , equations ( 11)-(13 ) contain all maxwell vacuum solutions , and they also give new , non - maxwellean nonlinear solutions satisfying the following inequalities : @xmath173 it is obvious that in the nonlinear case we obtain immediately from ( 11)-(13 ) the following relations : @xmath174 and combining with ( 13 ) we obtain additionally ( in view of @xmath175 ) @xmath176 so , in the nonlinear case , from ( 15 ) we obtain readily the poynting relation , and ( in hydrodynamic terms ) we may say that relation ( 16 ) requires the local helicities @xmath177 and @xmath178 of @xmath1 and @xmath2 [ 23,24 ] to be always equal .    in relativistic terms",
    "we first recall maxwell s equations in presence of charge distribution : @xmath179 in the pure field case we have @xmath180 or , in terms of * d * @xmath181 recall now from relations ( 8)-(9 ) the explicit forms of the stress - energy - momentum tensor and its divergence . from maxwell equations ( 17 )",
    "it follows that field energy - momentum is transferred to another physical system ( represented through the electric current @xmath182 ) only through the term @xmath183 ( the relativistic lorentz force ) , since the term @xmath184 is always equal to zero because of the first of equations ( 17 ) which is meant to represent the faraday s induction law .",
    "following the same line of consideration as in the nonrelativistic case we extend maxwell s free field equations @xmath185 as follows . in the field expression of the relativistic lorentz force @xmath186 we replace @xmath70 by @xmath187 , so we obtain the relativistic components of the @xmath164 lorentz force @xmath161 : @xmath188.\\ ] ] in view of the arbitrariness of the parameters @xmath99 after putting this expression equal to zero we obtain equations ( 11)-(13 ) in relativistic notation .",
    "the equation @xmath189 extends the relativistic maxwell s equation @xmath190 and in standard coordinates ( 18 ) gives equations ( 11 ) and the first of ( 15 ) .",
    "equations ( 12 ) and the second of ( 15 ) are presented by the equation @xmath191 looking back to the divergence relation ( 9 ) for the energy - momentum tensor @xmath121 we see that ( 18 ) and ( 19 ) require zero values for the two naturally arising distinguished parts of @xmath192 , and so the whole divergence is zero .",
    "this allows @xmath121 to be assumed as energy - momentum tensor for the nonlinear solutions .",
    "the relativistic version of ( 13 ) and ( 16 ) looks as follows : @xmath193    this relativistic form of the equations ( 11)-(13 ) and ( 15)-(16 ) goes along with the above interpretation : equations ( 18)-(19 ) , together with equation ( 9 ) , mean that no field energy - momentum is transferred to any other physical system through any of the two components @xmath70 and @xmath115 , so , only intra - field energy - momentum redistribution should take place ; equation ( 20 ) characterizes this intra - field energy momentum exchange in the following sense : the energy - momentum quantity , transferred locally from @xmath70 to @xmath115 and given by @xmath194 , is always equal to that transferred locally from @xmath115 to @xmath70 which , in turn , is given by @xmath195 .    in terms of the `` change - conservation '' concept considered in sec.1.1",
    ", we could say that the self - projections @xmath196 and @xmath184 of the admissible changes @xmath197 and @xmath198 on @xmath70 and @xmath115 , respectively , vanish , and the cross - projections @xmath195 and @xmath199 have the same absolute value .",
    "so , we can think of the electromagnetic field as a 2-vector component field @xmath200 , where @xmath144 is an appropriately chosen basis of the same real 2-dimensional vector space @xmath143 , and later the nature of @xmath143 will be specially considered .    in presence of external fields ( media ) , which exchange energy - momentum with our field @xmath70 , the right hand sides of ( 18)-(20 ) will not be zero in general .",
    "the energy - momentum local quantities that flow out of our field through its two components @xmath201 and are given by the left hand sides of ( 18)-(20 ) , in accordance with the local energy - momentum conservation law have to be absorbed by the external field .",
    "hence , these same quantities have to be expressed in terms of the field functions of the external field .",
    "maxwell equations give in the most general case only one such expression , namely , when the external field is represented by continuously distributed free and bounded charged particles .",
    "this expression reads : @xmath202 where @xmath203 is the standard 4-current for freely moving charged particles , @xmath204 is expressed through the polarization @xmath205 and magnetization @xmath206 vectors of the ( dielectric ) medium by @xmath207 so , maxwell equations allow no energy - momentum exchanges through @xmath115 .",
    "the usual justification for this is the absence of magnetic charges . in our view",
    "this motivation is insufficient and has to be left off .    in the frame of eed , in accordance with the concept of @xmath208_covariant lorentz force _ , we reject this limitation , in general .",
    "energy - momentum exchanges through @xmath70 , as well as , through @xmath115 are allowed . moreover",
    ", eed does not forbid some media to influence the energy - momentum transfers between @xmath70 and @xmath115 , favoring exchanges with @xmath70 or @xmath115 in correspondence with medium s own structure .",
    "formally , this means that the right hand side of ( 20 ) , in general , may also be different from zero .",
    "hence , in the most general case , eed assumes the following equations : @xmath209    the new objects @xmath210 are four 1-forms , and they represent the abilities of the corresponding medium for energy - momentum exchange with the field .",
    "clearly , their number corresponds to the four different abilities of the field to exchange energy - momentum , which are represented by @xmath211 and @xmath194 .",
    "these four 1-forms shall be expressed by means of the external field functions and their derivatives .",
    "this is a difficult problem and its appropriate resolution requires a serious knowledge of the external field considered . in most practical cases",
    "however people are interested only in how much energy - momentum has been transferred , and the transferred energy - momentum is given by some bilinear functions on @xmath70 and @xmath210 as it is in the maxwell case .",
    "here is the 3-dimensional form of the above equations ( the bold @xmath212 denotes the spatial part of the corresponding @xmath213 ) : @xmath214 @xmath215 @xmath216 @xmath217 @xmath218 @xmath219 @xmath220    as an example we recall the case of availability of magnetic charges with density @xmath221 and magnetic current @xmath222 .",
    "then the corresponding four 1-forms are @xmath223 , \\ \\",
    "\\alpha^3=\\left[\\frac{4\\pi}{c}\\mathbf{j}_e , -4\\pi \\rho_e\\right ] , \\ \\",
    "\\alpha^2=\\alpha^4=\\left[-\\frac{4\\pi}{c}\\mathbf{j}_m , -4\\pi \\rho_m\\right].\\ ] ] the corresponding three vector equations ( we omit the scalar ones ) look like @xmath224 @xmath225 @xmath226    returning to the general case we note that the important moment is that although the nature of the field may significantly change , _ the interaction , i.e. the energy - momentum exchange , must not destroy the medium_. so , _ definite integrability properties of the medium must be available _ , and these integrability properties should be expressible through the four 1-forms @xmath210 . in the maxwell case , where the charged particles represent any medium , this property implicitly presents through the implied stability of the charged particles , and it is mathematically represented by the local integrability of the electric current vector field @xmath227 : the corresponding system of ordinary differential equations @xmath228 has always solution at given initial conditions .",
    "if the physical system `` electromagnetic field+medium '' is energy - momentum isolated , i.e. no energy - momentum flows out of it , and the system does not destroy itself during interaction , eed assumes , in addition to equations ( 21)-(23 ) , the following :    0.3 cm * every couple @xmath229 , defines a completely integrable 2-dimensional pfaff system*. 0.3 cm this assumption means that the following equations hold : @xmath230 equations ( 21)-(24 ) constitute the basic system of equations of eed .",
    "of course , the various special cases can be characterized by adding some new consistent with ( 21)-(24 ) equations and relations .",
    "we are going now to express equations ( 21)-(23 ) as one relation , making use of the earlier introduced object @xmath200 and combining the 1-forms @xmath210 in two @xmath143-valued 1-forms : @xmath231 the basis @xmath144 defines two projections @xmath232 and @xmath233 : @xmath234 every bilinear map @xmath235 , where @xmath236 is some linear space , defines corresponding product in the @xmath143-valued differential forms by means of the relation @xmath237 now , let @xmath238 , where `` @xmath168 '' is the symmetrized tensor product . recalling @xmath239 we obtain @xmath240 now , equations ( 21)-(23 ) are equivalent to @xmath241 the maxwell case ( with zero magnetic charges ) corresponds to @xmath242 , where the 2-form @xmath13 is defined by the polarization 3-vector @xmath205 and the magnetization 3-vector @xmath206 in the similar way as @xmath70 is defined by @xmath0 .",

    "in particular , if this phase difference is a constant , then the superposition will work , which recalls the interference rule in maxwell vacuum electrodynamics , that two waves may interfere only if their phase difference is a constant quantity .",
    "0.5 cm    the considerations in this section allow the following conclusions and interpretations .",
    "the whole set of nonlinear solutions divides to subclasses @xmath942 of the kind ( 39 ) ( every such subclass is determined by the spatial direction along which the solution propagates translationally , it is the coordinate @xmath34 in our consideration , or by the corresponding @xmath310 ) .",
    "every solution @xmath70 of a given subclass is obtained by means of the action of a solution @xmath943 of equation ( 61 ) on the corresponding @xmath893 through the representation @xmath806 , namely , @xmath944 .",
    "we also note that every such subclass divides to subsubclasses @xmath836 , determined by a given solution @xmath70 and the action of @xmath97 with _ constant _ coefficients .",
    "every such subsubclass may be considered as one solution represented in different bases of @xmath143 .",
    "further , the relation @xmath945 suggests to consider @xmath893 , as a `` vacuum state along @xmath310 '' of the subclass considered , and the action of @xmath809 on @xmath893 as a `` creation operator along @xmath310 '' , provided @xmath946 , and @xmath947 satisfies ( 61 ) in @xmath8 . since @xmath948 we see that every such `` creation operator along @xmath310 '' in @xmath8 may be interpreted also as an `` annihilation operator along @xmath310 '' in @xmath8 , i.e. in the same subclass of solutions .",
    "a given @xmath93 may generate a creation operator with respect to some subclass of solutions only if @xmath949 is a running wave along the corresponding isotropic vector @xmath310 .",
    "finally , the only universal `` annihilation '' operator is the @xmath806-image of the zero element of @xmath143 .",
    "clearly , every solution @xmath944 of a given subclass may be represented in various ways in terms of other solutions to ( 61 ) in the same domain @xmath8 , i.e. we have an example of a _ nonlinear _ `` superposition '' inside a given subclass , represented by the above mentioned commutative group structure .",
    "the interpretation of a given subsubclass determined by a given solution @xmath70 and the action of @xmath97 with _ constant _ coefficients as one solution , suggests also the extension of this interpretation to the point dependent case . in fact , at every point @xmath950 we may consider an isomorphic image @xmath951 of @xmath143 with basis @xmath952 , where @xmath953 now , the element @xmath954\\in\\mathcal{g}_m$ ] is sent through the representation @xmath955 to the linear map @xmath956 , and when @xmath957 satisfies equation ( 61 ) we obtain the solution @xmath958 . hence , all solutions @xmath768 of a given subclass may be considered as one solution represented in different point dependant bases @xmath952 of @xmath959 . in fiber bundle terms",
    "we could say that the nonlinear solutions are determined by sections of the bundle @xmath960 which satisfy ( 61 ) and their @xmath806-actions on corresponding `` vacuums '' @xmath893 .",
    "looking back we see that in the frame of linear solutions ( maxwell solutions ) we have _ additive _ commutative group structure ( any linear combination with constant coefficients of linear solutions is again a solution ) , while in the frame of the nonlinear solutions we have a _ multiplicative _ commutative group structure : a product ( as given above ) of any number of nonlinear solutions along @xmath310 is again a solution along @xmath310 .",
    "the important difference between these two structures is that the additive structure of the linear solutions holds for all solutions , and the multiplicative group structure holds just inside a given @xmath310-subclass .",
    "so , the whole set of nonlinear solutions consists of orbits of the ( multiplicative ) group of those complex valued functions @xmath961 ( the product is point - wise ) , the module @xmath962 of which is a running wave along some fixed isotropic direction @xmath310 .",
    "we see also that the amplitude and the phase of a solution in a natural way acquire the interpretations of the _ amplitude _ @xmath963 and _ phase _ @xmath547 ( see relation ( 41 ) ) of the corresponding complex fields @xmath961 .",
    "clearly , through the well known moivre formulae , every @xmath944 generates @xmath964 and @xmath965{f}=\\rho(\\sqrt[n]{\\alpha}).f_o$ ] , and in this way we obtain new solutions of the same subclass .",
    "in this section we give a heuristic , in our view , approach as for how to come to the nonlinear vacuum equations of eed .",
    "only two things turn out to be needed : first , accepting that the time dependent em fields propagate along straight lines , second , some experience with differential geometry concepts .",

    "it is easily verified that the 2-dimensional pfaff system @xmath735 is completely integrable , and that the relations @xmath381 hold .",

    "0.5 cm following this procedure we can generate a spatial soliton solution to our system of equations by means of _ every _ solution , in particular every soliton solution , to _ any _ ( 1 + 1)-soliton equation , as well as to compute the corresponding conserved quantities .",
    "it seems senseless to give here these easily obtainable results .",
    "the richness of this comparatively simple family of solutions , as well as the availability of corresponding correctly defined integral conserved quantities , are obvious and should not be neglected as a generating procedure for obtaining ( 3 + 1 ) one - soliton , as well as , ( 3 + 1 ) many - soliton solutions .",
    "in trying to understand our observational knowledge of the real world we must be able to separate the _ important _ structural and behavioral properties of the real objects from those , the changes of which during time - evolution do not lead to annihilation of the objects under consideration .",
    "one of the basic in our view lessons that we more or less have been taught is that the physical objects are _ spatially finite entities _ , and that for their detection and further study some energy - momentum exchange is necessarily _",
    "required_. so , every physical object necessarily carries energy - momentum and every interaction between two physical objects has such an energy - momentum exchange aspect .",
    "the second lesson concerning any interaction is that , beyond its _ universality _ , energy - momentum is a _ conserved _",
    "quantity , so no loss of it is allowed : it may only pass from one object to another .",
    "this means that every _ annihilation _",
    "process causes _ creation _",
    "process(es ) , and the full energy - momentum that has been carried by the annihilated objects , is carried away by the created ones .",
    "energy - momentum always needs carriers , as well as every physical object always carries energy - momentum .",
    "hence , the energy - momentum exchange abilities of any physical object realize its protection against external influence on one side , and reveal its intrinsic nature , on the other side . therefore",
    ", our knowledge about the entire complex of properties of a physical object relies on getting information about its abilities in this respect and finding corresponding quantities describing quantitatively these abilities .",
    "the spatially finite nature of a physical object implies spatial structure and finite quantity of energy - momentum needed for its creation , so no structureless and infinite objects may exist .",
    "the approximations for `` point object '' and `` infinite field '' , although useful in some respects , seem theoretically inadequate and should not be considered as basic ones .",
    "more reliable appears to be the approximation `` finite continuous object '' , which we tried to follow throughout our exposition .",
    "this last approximation suggests that nonlinear partial differential equations should be the basic tool for building mathematical models of local nature of such objects .",
    "the natural physical sense of these equations is naturally supposed to be local energy - momentum exchange .",
    "another useful observation is that physical objects are _ many - aspect entities _",
    ", they have complicated structure and their very existence is connected with _ internal _ energy - momentum exchange / redistribution among the various structural components .",
    "so , the mathematical model objects should be many - component ones , and with appropriate mathematical structure .",
    "of basic help in finding appropriate mathematical objects is having knowledge of the internal symmetry properties of the physical object under consideration .",
    "this `` step by step '' process of getting and accumulating important information about the physical properties of natural objects reflects in the `` step by step '' process of refining the corresponding mathematical models .",
    "the greatest discovery at the very beginning of the last century was that the notion of electromagnetic field as suggested by maxwell equations is inadequate : the time dependent electromagnetic field is not an infinite smooth perturbation of the aether , on the contrary , it consists of many individual time - stable objects , called later _",
    "photons _ , which are created / destroyed mainly during intra - atomic energy - transition processes .",
    "photons are finite objects , they carry energy - momentum and after they have been radiated outside their atom - creator , they propagate as a whole translationally by the speed of light .",
    "moreover , their propagation is not just translational , it includes rotational component , which is of _ intrinsic _ and _ periodical _ nature .",
    "the corresponding intrinsic action for one period @xmath27 is @xmath1705 , where @xmath531 is the full energy of the photon , and all photons carry the same intrinsic action @xmath477 . during",
    "the entire 20th century physicists have tried to understand the dynamical structure / nature of photons from various points of view , and this process is still going on today .    extended electrodynamics , as presented in the preceding sections ,",
    "is an attempt in this direction .",
    "the basic starting observation for approaching the problem is that the energy - momentum local quantities and relations of maxwell theory do agree with the experiment , but the free field equations @xmath1706 give non - realistic free time - dependent solutions : they are either _ strongly time - unstable _ , or _",
    "hence , these solutions can not be used as mathematical models of photons , since the latter are time - stable and finite objects .",
    "the basic idea of writing down new nonlinear equations was to pass to local energy - momentum relations , describing how the internal energy - momentum exchanges are carried out .",
    "the mathematical structure of maxwell equations and local conservation relations allowed the extension procedure to be used , so the new nonlinear equations contain all maxwell solutions as exact solutions .",
    "this feature is important from the point of view of applications .    in order to come to the new equations we made use of the dual symmetry of the linear solutions , which suggested to consider the field as having two vector components @xmath201 , and introduced the concept of @xmath97-covariant lorentz force as a natural generalization of the known lorentz force .",
    "the @xmath97-covariant lorentz force has three vector components , and each component has a clear physical sense of corresponding local energy - momentum change , as it should be .",
    "the two components @xmath186 and @xmath184 determine how much energy - momentum the field is potentially able to give out to some other physical object through any of the two components @xmath70 and @xmath115 , and the third component @xmath1707 characterizes the internal energy - momentum exchange between the two components @xmath70 and @xmath115 .",
    "we concluded that in case of energy - momentum isolation , i.e. in vacuum , these three components must be zero , so , the dynamics obtained is of intrinsic nature .    in studying the vacuum nonlinear solutions",
    ", i.e. those with @xmath402 and @xmath1708 , we found their basic property : every nonlinear solution has zero - invariants : @xmath1709 .",
    "then the eigen properties of @xmath70 , @xmath115 and of the energy - momentum tensor @xmath121 determine unique isotropic direction @xmath310 along which the solution propagates translationally as a whole , which fits well with the photons way of propagation .",
    "the obtained simple form of @xmath1710 and @xmath1711 allowed a complete analysis of the nonlinear solutions to be made .",
    "the whole set of nonlinear solutions consists of nonoverlapping subsets , and each subset is characterized by the corresponding isotropic eigen direction .",
    "every solution of a given subclass is uniquely determined by two functions : the amplitude function @xmath458 which is arbitrary with respect to the spatial variables and is a running wave along @xmath310 ; the phase function @xmath1712 , where @xmath454 depends arbitrarily on all space - time variables ( we made use of the function @xmath1713 ) .",
    "the components of @xmath70 have the form @xmath1714 and @xmath1715 , so , finite solutions with photon - like behavior are allowed .",
    "a basic characteristic of the nonlinear solutions with @xmath394 turned out to be the _ scale factor _",
    "@xmath472 defined by the relation @xmath721 and having physical dimension of [ length ] .",
    "hence , every nonlinear solution with @xmath394 defines _ its own scale_. as it was shown further , the case @xmath866 is allowed , so corresponding intrinsically defined time - period @xmath1716 and frequency @xmath1717 can be introduced , and the corresponding finite solutions with integral energy @xmath531 admit the characteristic _ intrinsic action _ given by @xmath1536 .",
    "the natural question `` do there exist nonlinear finite solutions with rotational component of propagation '' was answered positively .",
    "seven equivalent conditions of quite different nature , determining when this is possible , were found to exist .",
    "it is remarkable that the condition @xmath1532 is one of them .",
    "so , for finite solutions with @xmath866 , we have a natural and intrinsically defined measure of this rotational component of propagation , namely , the elementary action @xmath1536 , which recalls the corresponding invariant characteristic of photons @xmath477 , the planck constant .",
    "anyway , these solutions deserve to be called `` photon - like '' . it is also remarkable that completely integrable and nonintegrable 2-dimensional pfaff systems can be associated with a nonlinear solution , and",
    "a natural integral characteristic of the nonintegrable pfaff systems is also the quantity @xmath1536 .",
    "this point shows that both , integrable and nonintegrable features of a solution are important , the nonintegrability characteristics give information about the contacts between the system and the physical environment .",
    "it was very interesting to find that the energy - momentum tensor @xmath285 of a nonlinear solution defines a boundary operator in the tangent and cotangent bundles of the minkowski space - time .",
    "the corresponding homology / cohomology spaces are 2-dimensional , the classes represented by the electric and magnetic components of the field @xmath70 form a basis of the corresponding homology / cohomology space . moreover , since for each nonlinear solution the corresponding image spaces of @xmath285 are 1-dimensional , @xmath285 is extended to boundary operator in the whole algebra of exterior forms and antisymmetric tensors .",
    "the @xmath285-image of any differential 2-form is collinear to the nonlinear solution that generates @xmath285 , and the @xmath285-image @xmath1718 of any @xmath33-form @xmath93 is isotropic : @xmath1719 ^ 2=0 $ ] .",
    "the natural representation of @xmath97 in the space of 2-forms leaves the scale factor @xmath472 invariant . as a consequence we obtained that @xmath472 is lorentz - invariant",
    "only if it is a constant , and in this case the 3-form @xmath406 is closed , which generates a conserved quantity through stokes theorem , and this conserved quantity is proportional to the elementary action @xmath1536 . if the group parameters depend on the space - time points , then the commutative group structure of @xmath97 generates a group structure inside the subset of solutions with the same @xmath310 . in such a case",
    "a `` vacuum state '' @xmath893 can be defined such , that every solution of the subclass is defined by an action upon @xmath893 of a point - dependent group element with determinant @xmath95 having running wave character along @xmath310 .",
    "the connection - curvature interpretations showed that rotational component of propagation may have only those nonlinear solutions which generate non - zero curvature in the three cases of general , principal amd linear connection , so , roughly speaking , nonzero curvature means nonzero spin .",
    "we gave five ways to compute the integral spin @xmath1536 of a nonlinear solution .",
    "it worths noting that an appropriate representative of the godbillon - vey class determined by the completely integrable 1-dimensional pfaff system @xmath310 , or @xmath1720 , can be made equal to @xmath592 , and so it can be used to compute the elementary action @xmath1536 .",
    "finally , in presence of external fields , we showed that our general system of nonlinear equations together with the additional pfaff equations is consistent , and we found a large family of solutions .",
    "this family is parametrized by one function of one - space ( say @xmath34 ) and one - time independent variables : @xmath1632 , and two other functions @xmath1637 and @xmath1638 .",
    "so , choosing @xmath1632 to be any ( one , or many ) soliton solution of any soliton equation , and @xmath1637and @xmath1638 to be finite , we obtain its ( 3 + 1 ) image as a finite / concentrated solution of our nonlinear equations with well defined energy - momentum quantities .",
    "we illustrated our approach with examples from the 1-soliton solutions of the well known sine - gordon , kdv and nls equations .",
    "0.4 cm we would like to note also that the nonlinear vacuum equations obtained follow the idea that was formulated in sec.1.1 : the admissible changes ( in our case @xmath198 and @xmath197 , or correspondingly , @xmath987 and @xmath988 ) are projected upon the field components @xmath201 , and these projections are assumed to be zero , or intrinsically connected .",
    "this leads directly to nonlinear equations with corresponding physical sense of energy - momentum balance relations . from mathematical point of view",
    "this suggests a natural generalization of the geometrical concept of parallelism , and this idea is developed and illustrated with many examples from differential geometry and theoretical physics in the appendix .",
    "this generalization , in turn , suggests natural ways to nonlinearization of important physical linear and nonlinear equations .",
    "0.4 cm the development of theoretical physics during the last century , and especially during the past 30 years , shows growing interest to nonlinearization of the widely used linear equations . at the beginning of",
    "the century einstein declared [ 32 ] that the fundamental equation of optics @xmath1721 must be replaced by nonlinear equation(s ) , and he had worked in trying to find appropriate one(s ) .",
    "general relativity made a decisive step along the road of nonlinearization .",
    "mie s [ 44 ] and born - infeld s [ 9 ] nonlinearizations of ced are also steps in this direction .",
    "one of the greatest achievements was the yang - mills approach , which dominates nowadays the various models of field theory ( the `` standard model '' ) .",
    "unfortunately , spatially finite solutions of the vacuum yang- mills equations with soliton behavior were not found .",
    "the later studies with appropriate interaction term in the yang - mills lagrangian brought the monopole solutions [ 33 ] .",
    "a somewhat curious example is presented by the instanton solutions [ 34 ] because of their mathematical significance on one side , and because of the interpretational difficulties coming from the necessary zero value of their energy - momentum tensor , on the other side .",
    "some development should be noted of the theory of the so called `` nontopological solitons '' , or q - balls , [ 35,36,37,38 ] , dyons [ 39 ] , vortices [ 40 ] , sphalerons [ 41 ] , skyrmeons [ 42 ] , knots [ 43 ] , which in most cases give spherically symmetric static solutions of equations obtained from correspondingly nonlinearized lagrangians .",
    "we have to mention that all these examples follow the rule : `` add nonlinear interaction term to the ' ' free `` lagrangian giving linear equations and see what happens '' .",
    "we do not share the view that this is the right way to pass to ( 3 + 1)-dimensional nonlinear equations .",
    "we explained our view in the preceding sections and showed that our approach works in the important case of the vacuum photon - like finite solutions and in presence of external fields .",
    "all free and not - free time - stable objects in nature are finite , so , the widely used `` free '' terms in any lagrangian could play some misleading role , especially those `` free '' terms that generate , or imply , dalembert - like wave equations .",
    "finally , we just mention ( without any comments ) the ( super)string and brane approaches , which also try to incorporate in theoretical physics spatially finite solutions",

    "the einstein equations of general relativity also admit such a formulation .    in quantum physics",
    "the schrdinger equation admits the `` parallel '' formulation with trivial projection .",
    "a bit more complicated was to put the dirac equation in this formulation , and this is due to the bit more complicated mathematical structure of @xmath2043 .",
    "these important examples make us think that the introduced here extended concept for @xmath2044-_parallel / conservative objects _ as a natural generalization of the existing geometrical concept for @xmath1387-parallel objects , may be successfully used in various directions , in particular , in searching for appropriate nonlinearizations of the existing linear equations in theoretical and mathematical physics .",
    "it may also turn out to find it useful in looking for appropriate lagrangians in some cases . in our view , this is due to the fact that it expresses in a unified manner the dual _ change - conservation _ nature of the physical objects ."
