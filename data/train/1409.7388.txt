    "much of we know about galaxy properties has come from panoramic imaging or 1d spectroscopic surveys .",
    "while imaging provides useful 2d information of galaxy morphology and structural properties , spectroscopic surveys give information on the central or global stellar population and ionized gas properties and kinematics .",
    "however , galaxies are a complex mix of stars , interstellar gas , dust and dark matter , distributed in their disks and bulges , and resolved spatial information is needed to constrain the formation processes and evolution of the galaxy sub - components .",
    "integral field spectroscopy ( ifs ) observations can provide a unique 3d view of galaxies ( two spatial plus one spectral dimensions ) , and allows to recover 2d maps of the stellar population and ionized gas properties . until very recently it was not possible to obtain ifs data for sample larger than a few tens of galaxies .",
    "the atlas3d ( cappellari et al .  2011 ) , califa ( snchez et al .  2012 ) , sami ( croom et al .",
    "2012 ) and manga ( bundy et al .",
    "2014 ) surveys are the first in doing this step forward , taking observations of several hundreds to several thousands of galaxies of the nearby universe .",
    "califa is our currently - ongoing survey , observing 600 nearby galaxies with the ppak ifu at the 3.5 m telescope of calar alto observatory .",
    "the observations cover 37007000   with an intermediate spectral resolution ( fwhm @xmath8 6   in the data presented in this contribution ) and @xmath81arcmin@xmath10 field of view with a final spatial sampling of 1 arcsec .",
    "galaxies were selected from sdss in the redshift range 0.005 @xmath11 z @xmath11 0.03 , covering all the color magnitude diagram down to m@xmath12 -18 , resulting in a sample containing all morphological types",
    ". an extended description of the survey , data reduction and sample can be found in snchez et al ( 2012 ) , hussemann et al ( 2012 ) and walcher et al ( 2014 ) .    previously , we derived the spatially resolved star formation history of the califa galaxies on the first data release ( dr1 ) using the fossil record of stellar populations imprinted in their spectra .",
    "this method dissects galaxies in space and time providing a 3d information that allows to retrieve when and where the mass and stellar metallicity were assembled as a function of look - back - time .",
    "we use the starlight code ( cid fernandes et al .",
    "2005 ) to do a @xmath13-by-@xmath13 spectral fit using different sets of single stellar population ( ssp ) models .",
    "these ssps are from a combination of vazdekis et al .",

    "our scientific results from the first 100 califa galaxies were presented in prez et al ( 2013 ) , cid fernandes et al ( 2013 , 2014 ) and gonzles delgado et al ( 2014a ) .",
    "one highlight result of these works is that the signal of downsizing is spatially preserved , with inner and outer regions growing faster for more massive galaxies , consequence of the inside - out growth of massive galaxies .    here",
    ", based on the analysis of 300 califa galaxies we present the results on : a ) the radial structure and gradients of the stellar populations as a function of the hubble type ; and b ) the roles of the galaxy mass and stellar mass surface density in governing the star formation history and metallicity enrichment in ellipticals and in the bulge and disk components of galaxies .",
    "two complementary contributions to this one are presented in these proceedings : snchez presents califa in the context of other contemporaneous ifs surveys such as sami and manga , and cid fernandes et al .  highlights some previous and new results obtained with the same methodology applied here",
    "we present new results based on the radial structure of the present stellar population properties of 300 califa galaxies that were observed with the v500 and v1200 setups and calibrated with the new pipeline 1.4 ( see garca - benito et al .",
    "2014 for details ) .",
    "1d radial profiles are obtained from the 2d maps , with an azimuthal averaging by an elliptical @xmath14-to-@xmath15 conversion .",
    "these 2d maps are created after collapsing the star formation history ( sfh ) in the time domain .",
    "the results are presented by stacking each galaxy individual radial profiles after normalizing to a common metric that uses the half - light - radius ( hlr ) of each galaxy .      a step to understand how galaxies form and evolve is classifying galaxies and studying their properties .",
    "most of the massive galaxies in the near universe are e , s0 and spirals ( blanton & moustakas 2009 ) , following well the hubble tuning - fork diagram .",
    "the bulge fraction seems to be one of the main physical parameters that produce the hubble sequence , increasing from late to early spirals . in this scheme ,",
    "s0 galaxies are a transition class between the spiral classes and the elliptical one , with large bulges , but intermediate between sa and e galaxies . on the other hand ,",
    "properties such as color , mass , surface brightness , luminosity , and gas fraction are correlated with the hubble type ( robert & haynes 1994 ) .",
    "this suggests that the hubble sequence can illustrate possible paths for galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "if so , how are the spatially resolved stellar population properties of galaxies correlated with the hubble type ? can the hubble - tuning - fork scheme be useful to organize galaxies by galaxy mass and age or galaxy mass and metallicity ?",
    "califa is a suitable benchmark to address these questions because it includes a significant amount of e , s0 and spirals . after a visual classification",
    ", the 300 galaxies were grouped in 41 e , 32 s0 , 51 sa , 53 sb , 58 sbc , 50 sc , and 15 sd .",

    "here we present the radial structure of the stellar mass surface density ( @xmath3 ) , stellar extinction ( a@xmath4 ) , luminosity weighted stellar age ( @xmath5 ) , mass weighted stellar metallicity ( @xmath6 ) , by stacking the galaxies by their hubble type .",
    "first , we present how galaxies are distributed by stellar mass ( m@xmath9 ) and their sizes in mass ( @xmath16 : radius that contains half of the mass ) and in light ( @xmath17 : radius that contains half of the light , hlr ) .",

    "we see a clear segregation in mass : galaxies with high bulge - to - disk ratio ( e , s0 , sa ) are the most massive ones ( @xmath21 10@xmath20 m@xmath2 ) , and galaxies with small bulges ( sc - sd ) have masses m @xmath11 10@xmath22 m@xmath2 . the stellar mass distribution obtained with _ cbe _",

    "* galaxy size : * we take advantage of our spatially resolved sfh and extinction maps to show that galaxies are more compact in mass than in light ( gonzlez delgado et al .",

    "the intermediate type spirals ( sbc ) have the largest gradients . these negative gradients again are signs of the inside - out growth of the disks . however , the metallicity gradient for late spirals is positive indicating that these galaxies , in the low mass galaxy bins , may be formed from outside - in .",
    "this result is also in agreement with our results from the mass assembly evolution ( prez et al .",
    "2012 ) .",
    "galaxy formation and evolution manifests in three main parameters : stellar age , mass and metallicity .",

    "we can study how their properties scale among the different classes .",
    "with califa , thanks to the spatial information , we can check how important are the local ( @xmath3- driven ) and global ( m@xmath9-driven ) processes in determining the star formation history and chemical enrichment in galaxies .    we find that there is a strong relation between the local values of @xmath3 and the metallicity , a relation which is similar in amplitude to the global mass metallicity relation that exits between @xmath6  and m@xmath9 over the whole @xmath0 to @xmath34 m@xmath2 range ( gonzlez delgado et al .",
    "this means that local and global processes are important in the metallicity enrichment of the galaxies .",
    "however , the balance between local and global effects varies with the location within a galaxy .",
    "while in disks , @xmath3 regulate the stellar metallicity , producing a correlation between @xmath28 and @xmath6 , in bulges and ellipticals is m@xmath9 who dominates the chemical enrichment ( fig .",
