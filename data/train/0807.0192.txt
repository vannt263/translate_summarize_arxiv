    "it is well known now that the conventional one - boson - exchange ( obe ) concept of the @xmath1 interaction suggested long ago in the classical work by yukawa describes very well the peripheral part of @xmath1 interaction at distances @xmath9  fm .",
    "however this accepted mechanism meets quite serious problems on the fundamental level in the description of phenomena depending on the short - range behavior of the interaction when two nucleons are overlapping  @xcite . to give examples , we point out the difficulties with the extra - large short - range cutoff parameters @xmath10 or @xmath11 , with high values for @xmath12-coupling constant @xmath13 , and with the ratio for the tensor - to - vector @xmath14 coupling @xmath15 . because of these problems",
    "the short - range part of the @xmath1 interaction is treated in modern @xmath1-potential models and in numerous effective - field - theory ( eft ) approaches mainly on a purely phenomenological basis  @xcite .",
    "very recently , however new serious problems  @xcite with the basic scalar @xmath1 force at _ intermediate ranges _ have arisen .",
    "using completely different approaches , a few groups  @xcite have revisited the scalar - isoscalar part of 2@xmath3-exchange force which has previously been considered as basic mechanism for the strong intermediate - range @xmath1 attraction in conventional obe - models . now this part of the interaction was treated more consistently than before , and as a result , the correlated 2@xmath3-exchange has lead to a strong short - range _ repulsion _ and only very moderate weak peripheral @xmath1 attraction .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite summarize their findings as : `` contrary to common belief these processes ( i.e. the correlated 2@xmath3-exchange at @xmath16  fm ) lead to negligibly small and repulsive corrections to the @xmath1 potential '' . with the above new findings",
    "( see especially refs .",
    "@xcite ) , thus the conventional @xmath17-channel 2@xmath3-meson exchange mechanism can not provide the strong intermediate - range attraction between two nucleons .    furthermore , the predictions of the most accurate few - body calculations based on conventional force models disagree in quite numerous cases with the precise experimental data for the few - nucleon systems  @xcite .",
    "one of the most indicative examples is the very strong disagreement between the results of the recent nikhef  @xcite and jlab  @xcite experiments on the @xmath18he high - energy disintegration into the three - nucleon channel , viz .",
    "the @xmath19  @xcite and the @xmath20 reaction  @xcite at @xmath21  gev and the only existing laget s model .    in order to avoid these serious problems at short and intermediate ranges ,",
    "a few of the present authors  @xcite have developed some time ago a new model for this part of the @xmath1 interaction .",
    "the new approach assumes that when two nucleons are approaching very closely to each other for distances @xmath22  fm , their quark cores overlap and a new intermediate state , the dressed dibaryon , appears .",
    "the respective interaction model has been developed jointly by two groups ( in moscow and tbingen ) , initially as interesting and quite successful alternative concept to the conventional @xmath17-channel meson - exchange mechanism at short ranges .",
    "although this concept was a plausible _ conjecture _ it was able to explain consistently the character of short - range @xmath1 correlations .",
    "however recently very convincing new direct experimental data appeared which , on the authors opinion , can be interpreted as direct evidence of appearance of the dressed dibaryon in the @xmath1 system and thus the generation of the dressed six - quark bag looked for in @xmath1 system a long time  @xcite . after a short description of the dibaryon concept for the @xmath1 interaction , we recapitulate in this letter all the new experimental data and give their qualitative interpretation in terms of the dibaryon concept .",
    "there was a very high activity in 80ies around dibaryons and their experimental manifestation ( see e.g. the comprehensive reviews  @xcite ) . however in all this activity dibaryons ( no matter , they are narrow or broad ) were considered as some multi - quark _",
    "exotic mode_. in sharp contrast to this previous activity , we treat the intermediate dibaryon as a basic carrier of short - range @xmath1 interaction , i.e. as a",
    "_ regular d.o.f . _",
    "thus , in our approach the @xmath1 system is described formally as a two- ( or multi- ) component system including at least two independent channels  @xcite .",
    "the external ( @xmath1 ) channel describes the motion of two nucleons interacting with each other by a conventional @xmath17-channel one- or two - meson exchange with the appropriate cut - offs at short distances .",
    "however , when two nucleons are approaching each other , the system changes to the inner  dibaryon ( db )  channel in which there are no individual nucleons present at all and a new phase emerges which consists of the intermediate dibaryon dressed with strong meson fields , e.g. @xmath0 , @xmath23 and @xmath3 .",
    "note , that the main contribution is coming from the scalar @xmath0-field surrunding six - quark core in a space symmetric state .",
    "formally , it may be interpreted in a way that the standard @xmath17-channel @xmath0-exchange between two nucleons at @xmath24  1  fm is replaced in our approach by the respective @xmath25-_channel _",
    "@xmath0-exchange associated with the intermediate dibaryon production ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : graph ] ) .",
    "it is important to stress that all channels are defined in our approach in a whole space .",
    "in general , the model includes a fock - column with different components : @xmath1 , 6@xmath26@xmath0 , 6@xmath26@xmath3 , etc .",
    "the main problem in this approach is finding the coupling between the external @xmath1 channel and the internal @xmath27 channels , i.e. the transition vertex @xmath28 . + * in the non - relativistic treatment * , we tested two different ways for this coupling : fully microscopic  @xcite and semi - microscopic  @xcite . within microscopic six - quark model",
    "the @xmath0-dressing mechanism was shown  @xcite to come from specific mixed - symmetry six - quark configurations @xmath29_x[51]_{fs}\\rangle$ ] dominating in the overlap region of two nucleons  @xcite .",
    "thus , the scalar @xmath0-field can be easily generated in the transition @xmath29_x[51]_{fs}\\rangle\\to |s^6[6]_x+\\sigma\\rangle$ ] in which two @xmath7-shell quarks jump down to the @xmath25-shell with emission of two strongly correlated @xmath30-wave pions .",
    "these two pions produce quite naturally a scalar @xmath0-meson  @xcite in the field of a six - quark core .",
    "this treatment leads to a very simple and transparent model for interaction in the external @xmath1 channel : @xmath31 where @xmath32 are the peripheral pion exchange interactions smoothly cutoff at @xmath33  1  fm .",
    "the intermediate- and short - range term @xmath34 is a nonlocal potential of separable type coming from intermediate @xmath25-channel dressed dibaryons ( cf .",
    "[ fig : graph ] ) , which in the simplest case at low and intermediate ( @xmath35  1  gev ) energies takes the form : @xmath36 where @xmath37 are the 2@xmath25 ( or 2@xmath8 ) or 3@xmath7 ( or 3@xmath38 ) h.o .",
    "functions for the interaction in the @xmath39 partial wave .",

    "[ fig : graph ] ) taking the form @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the reduced mass in the @xmath43 channel , @xmath44 is the kinetic energy of the @xmath0-meson , @xmath45 is the difference of the bare mass of the dibaryon and sum of nucleon masses . @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the vertex functions for the @xmath48 couplings which can be calculated microscopically  @xcite . in the semi - microscopic variant of the model",
    "the explicit consideration of multi - quark dynamics was replaced by a simple parametrization of the vertex functions  @xcite .",
    "the results of the microscopic and semi - microscopic variants occured to be quite near to each other .",
    "@xmath49 is a pseudo - potential providing the orthogonality condition between the excited 2@xmath50 and the non - excited 0@xmath50 6@xmath51-states expressed through the variables of the @xmath1 channel .",
    "the potential in the @xmath30-wave takes the form . here",
    "@xmath52 is the 0@xmath25 h.o .",
    "wave function and the constant @xmath53 should be taken positive and sufficiently large to eliminate the contribution of the @xmath54 bag - like configuration from the initial @xmath1 channel  @xcite .",
    "similar constructions for @xmath49 are found also for the @xmath55-waves . it should be noted , that in our approach the traditional mechanism for the short - range @xmath1 repulsion induced by the vector ( i.e. @xmath56- and @xmath23- ) meson exchange is replaced mainly by a nonlocal repulsion coming from the @xmath49 term in eq .",
    "( [ vtot ] ) and also from the nodal character of all @xmath1 wave functions in the low partial waves  @xcite with stationary inner nodes .",
    "moreover , the inner node positions have been found to almost coincide with the repulsive core radii in traditional @xmath1-potential models .",
    "the conventional @xmath17-channel @xmath56- and @xmath23-exchanges can also be included into the model with proper coupling constants but the main part of short - range @xmath1 repulsion will come just from dibaryon mechanism .",
    "thus , in our approach the @xmath12 and @xmath57 coupling constants can be taken in full agreement with @xmath58 prescription .    * in a fully relativistic treatment *  @xcite we start with a time ordered two - point green function for the transition chain @xmath59 @xmath60 where @xmath61 means the confined ( on color ) dibaryon state and @xmath62 means a chronological ordering operator whereas the states @xmath63 and @xmath64 correspond to the initial and final nucleons with 4-momenta @xmath65 ,  @xmath66 and @xmath67 ,  @xmath68 respectively .",
    "the ( nonlocal ) lagrangian density is chosen as @xmath69 where function @xmath70 describes the dibaryon with spin @xmath71  0 whereas @xmath72 corresponds to the @xmath71  1 dibaryon .",
    "in the two cases the isospin @xmath73 is taken zero , @xmath74 0 .",
    "for the @xmath74 1 dibaryon an evident replacement @xmath75 should be done . after a lengthy calculation ( for details",
    "see refs .",
    "@xcite ) one gets a relativistic dibaryon - induced @xmath1 potential which gives in the nonrelativistic reduction a separable potential similar to eqs .",
    "( [ vnqn ] ) and  ( [ coupl ] ) .    in the simplest case , the above model  @xcite has two components only , the external @xmath1 part and the inner @xmath0-dressed dibaryon part . with this two - component model",
    "we were able to fit excellently the lower partial wave @xmath1 phase shifts up to 1000 mev  @xcite , using only a few basic parameters ( mass and radius of the intermediate dibaryon , and the cutoff parameters for @xmath76 and @xmath77 ) .",
    "the quantitative estimates for the mass of the dressed dibaryon still require the accurate consideration of the chiral symmetry restoration effects and thus we postpone such cumbersome calculations to a future .",
    "however we found that the @xmath1 phase shifts can be nicely fitted until the energy @xmath78  gev at the dibaryon mass @xmath79  gev ( for @xmath80 and @xmath81 partial waves ) .",
    "using two - component model one can calculate accurately the weight  @xmath82 of the dressed dibaryon in the deuteron and also in the @xmath1 scattering states .",
    "for the deuteron we found @xmath83  0.025  @xcite . despite this rather small admixture of the dressed dibaryon component , it provides ( jointly with the ope - tensor force and some very moderate peripheral attraction coming from tpe ) a sufficient intermediate - range attraction to fit the @xmath1 phase shifts up to 1  gev and to bind the deuteron .    on the other hand , the qualitative picture of the intermediate dibaryon",
    "can also be confronted with the earlier dibaryon models  @xcite which have used the different mechanisms for stabilization of intermediate six - quark bag ( e.g. delocalization of single - quark orbits  @xcite or the matching to external @xmath1 channel on some surface  @xcite .",
    "however , these previous models were operating only with inner single - quark ( and external @xmath1 ) degrees of freedom without explicit scalar field which plays a crucial role in our approach ( see below ) and is seen clearly in experiments .",
    "the other alternative dibaryon model  @xcite was built on a string - like picture , where the dibaryon was modeled as @xmath84 quark clusters connected by a color string .",
    "however , the string in such models was in its _ ground state _ regarding its radial excitation and there were also no meson fields present . in terms of the color string between two quark clusters at its ends , our picture corresponds to the generation of a 2@xmath50-excited string configuration between two colored quark clusters in the initial state ( because the six - quark configuration @xmath85_x$ ] includes two quanta of gluonic excitation )  @xcite . consequently , when the string deexcites with the emission of two gluons the latter can transform their energy to the scalar @xmath0-field and eventually to two final pions .",
    "the energy transformation can be easily understood if the @xmath0-meson contains some glue component in form of light glueball admixture .",
    "this picture of the @xmath0-generation from the string deexcitation in the intermediate dibaryon is in nice agreement with recent approaches  @xcite to the @xmath0-meson emission in @xmath86 collisions at high energies .",
    "the authors suggested to estimate the one- and two @xmath0-meson emission from the intermediate string by assuming a hybrid nature of the light scalar meson which has both glueball ( 0@xmath87 ) and @xmath88 ( @xmath89 ) components . from this point of view",
    ", production of the intermediate @xmath0-dressed dibaryon can be viewed as @xmath25-channel version of the @xmath0-emission mechanism ( proposed by kisslinger for pomeron exchange at high energies  @xcite ) in case of low and intermediate energies .",
    "the above dibaryon model combined with the specific mechanism for the strong scalar field generation in the quark bag gives unique predictions for several hadronic processes and for many properties of the few - body systems .",
    "in particular , the non - conventional picture for the strong scalar field generation described above was confirmed very nicely in recent studies of the roper - resonance structure  @xcite and its decay  @xcite and also in other new experiments with high - energy deuterons  @xcite .",
    "in fact , the quark structure of the roper resonance ( corresponding also to the 2@xmath50 monopole excitation of the initial nucleon ) should include the excited 3@xmath51-configurations @xmath90_x+(0s)^2(2s)[3]_x)\\rangle$ ] , i.e. this roper state includes also two @xmath7-shell quarks ( or a single quark in the @xmath91-excited state ) .",
    "hence quite similar to our dibaryon , one has for the roper - resonance a generation mechanism for the scalar field : @xmath92_x\\rangle\\to|s^3[3]_x+\\sigma\\rangle$ ] .",
    "this means that the dominating configuration for the roper resonance might be @xmath93_x+\\sigma\\rangle$ ] , i.e. the @xmath0-dressed three - quark bag in a space symmetrical 3@xmath51-state @xmath94 which is equivalent  in the 3@xmath51-dynamics  to our intermediate dibaryon production mechanism in the 6@xmath51-dynamics .",
    "actually , the large admixture of such a @xmath0-field configuration to the 3@xmath51-state @xmath95 was found both in theoretical  @xcite and experimental  @xcite studies .",
    "moreover , two independent studies  @xcite , both done on basis of qcd sum rules , have found that the roper resonance state has a large admixture for the @xmath0-field while the nucleon ground state has a negligible amount of @xmath0-meson admixture .",
    "these conclusions have been well confirmed in a recent dedicated experiment  @xcite where the @xmath0-meson channel was found to be strongly dominating in the roper - resonance decay with a branching ratio @xmath96 of @xmath97  4:1 .",
    "thus , the high admixture of the scalar field in the roper wave function should be one of the main reasons for the strong shift downwards of the roper - resonance mass to anomalously low mass value @xmath98  @xcite ) . a very similar shift downwards of the @xmath0-dressed dibaryon mass enhances significantly the @xmath1 intermediate - range attraction via the mechanism shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : graph ] .",
    "the dressed dibaryon concept is very tightly related to the idea about partial chiral symmetry restoration ( csr ) in dense hadronic matter  @xcite .",
    "as is well known , the @xmath0-meson mass in such a symmetry restoration process decreases drastically and this leads to a strong stabilization of the most symmetrical @xmath99-configuration @xmath100_x\\rangle$ ] embedded into this scalar field .",
    "simultaneously the mass of the intermediate dressed dibaryon comes also down and as a result of all these highly non - linear effects there appears a strong effective attractive force between two nucleons at intermediate distances @xmath16  fm . in the conventional quantum - mechanical language",
    "this strong intermediate - range attraction in @xmath1 channel can be interpreted in terms of coupled - channel phenomena , i.e. as a result of strong coupling between the external @xmath1 channel and inner dibaryon channel with symmetry @xmath100_x\\rangle$ ] dressed with @xmath0-field .",
    "this picture should be compared with result of pure @xmath99-model  @xcite , i.e. that without any scalar fields where @xmath101 force ( originating from the goldstone - boson - exchange ( gbe ) mechanism ) are fitted very nicely to reproduce the spectra of excited baryons ( in the normal and strange sectors )  @xcite .",
    "however , the effective two - nucleon force resulting from the gbe @xmath101 force was found  @xcite to be _ purely repulsive _ and strong in the nucleon overlap region .",
    "thus , the @xmath101 force which fits very well the baryon spectra ( octets , decuplets et . ) should be supplemented in the @xmath1 system with an additional strong scalar force ( either on the @xmath101- or directly on the @xmath1 level ) to fit the deuteron properties and the @xmath1 scattering data .",
    "we conjecture , the dibaryon mechanism considered here is very well suited to be origin for this strong scalar force .",
    "furthermore , in combination with recent ideas about chiral symmetry restoration  @xcite the dibaryon model predicts the strong enhancement for the @xmath0-meson production in @xmath1 collisions in the energy region @xmath102 1.1 - 1.2  gev .",
    "this property follows straightforwardly from untiing the @xmath0 loop of the dressed bag propagator ( cf .",
    "[ fig : graph ] ) at energies above the threshold of @xmath0-meson production .    as a clear signal for such a chiral symmetry restoration ( csr ) effect",
    "one considers usually parity doublets in the baryon spectra at high excitation  @xcite .",
    "the first ( rather approximate ) parity doublet is suggested  @xcite to be the roper @xmath103(1440 ) ( @xmath104 ) and @xmath105(1535 ) ( @xmath106 ) isobars .",
    "thus , from this point of view , the 2@xmath50-excitation of the dressed dibaryon is very similar to the 2@xmath50-excitation of the roper - resonance .",
    "so , the scalar - isoscalar enhancement near the 2@xmath3-threshold , associated with the intermediate @xmath0-meson in case of csr in the excited multiquark bag , should be seen in experiments on two - pion ( @xmath88 or @xmath107 ) production in @xmath1 , @xmath108 etc .",
    "fortunately , such experiments have been done numerously in 60ies  @xcite and the authors found very clear and strong enhancement in the 2@xmath3-production near the thresholds in @xmath109 , @xmath110 reactions .",
    "these experimental results shown as missing mass distributions are well known nowadays as the famous abc - puzzle  @xcite .",
    "this ( partial ) symmetry restoration effects have been confirmed by two independent groups of authors : first , this restoration was found  @xcite in large hadronic systems at high temperature or density , and second , this effect was demonstrated to happen even in a single hadron at high excitations  @xcite .",
    "there are also quite general arguments in favor of the @xmath0-mass renormalization  @xcite at sufficiently high excitation energy in both cases mentioned above .",
    "very recently two types of new experimental data appeared  @xcite which have given the direct and unambiguous evidence for the intermediate @xmath0-dressed dibaryon production with strongly renormalized @xmath0-meson mass .",
    "the first type of experiments  @xcite is in essence an improvement of the old classical abc experiments with modern exclusive setting and detailed measurements of energy and angular correlations of two emitted pions in the reactions @xmath111 and @xmath112 at incident proton energies ( @xmath113  gev ) specific for the manifestation of the abc phenomenon .",
    "the new experimental data of the celsius - wasa collaboration  @xcite together with those from earlier measurements have demonstrated ( fig .",
    "[ fig : abc ] ) that the rather narrow and strong peak observed in the @xmath114 cross section can not be explained by the conventional @xmath115 model  @xcite ( dotted line in fig .",
    "[ fig : abc ] ) , and the data require a near threshold @xmath115 _ bound state _ ( long dashed line ) .",
    "in fact , a few @xmath115 bound states have been predicted in some recent six - quark calculations  @xcite .",
    "however , in all these calculations the r.m.s .",
    "radius @xmath116 of matter in such @xmath115 bound states was found to not exceed 0.9  fm  @xcite , or to range even at @xmath117  fm  @xcite .",
    "thus , two deltas in such bound states are strongly overlapping and therefore the assumed @xmath115 bound states are nothing else but the intermediate dibaryon components .",
    "another important result of these experiments is that the authors found ( similarly to the abc - group ) a strong enhancement in @xmath118-production near threshold at @xmath119  mev with clear @xmath30-wave @xmath120-correlation .",
    "hence , in this case , the abc puzzle can be considered as an indicator for partial chiral symmetry restoration in the excited six - quark system generated from collision of two nucleons at energies @xmath121  gev .",
    "in such a specific generation process , all the kinetic energy of the two - nucleon relative motion ( @xmath1220.6  gev ) transforms into a 2@xmath50 string excitation near the @xmath115 threshold with subsequent @xmath0-meson emission .",
    "another very clear signal for the @xmath0-meson associated with the renormalized - mass @xmath0-dressed dibaryon in the deuteron has been found in experiments @xmath123 and @xmath124 at incident energies 2.5 - 5  gev / n at dubna  @xcite . in the @xmath125c experiment",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ fig : imgg]a ) the authors have found three clear peaks in the @xmath6-mass ( @xmath126 ) distribution : the low - energy peak for @xmath127  mev associated with the @xmath128-decay mode was suppressed in the analysis by cuts ( and so not seen in fig .",
    "3 ) , a high - energy peak at @xmath129  mev associated with the @xmath130-production and a strong enhancement at @xmath131  mev exhibiting a width @xmath132  mev ; the latter could not be interpreted by the authors  @xcite in terms of well known mesons despite the comprehensive and detailed modeling .    a similar peak at @xmath133  mev has been found by the celsius - wasa collaboration  @xcite in @xmath134 experiments .",
    "this peak has been interpreted by the authors as a signal of the intermediate @xmath0-meson with renormalized mass in the process @xmath135 .",
    "however , the authors  @xcite have interpreted two gammas emitted from the reaction as emerging from the intermediate @xmath120 bremsstrahlung .",
    "contrary to this , the new data of the dubna group have a quite unambiguous interpretation just through the @xmath0-dressed dibaryon component in the incident deuteron because the signal is seen very clearly in @xmath125c collisions and is not seen in @xmath136c collisions ( cf .",
    "fig  [ fig : imgg]a and  [ fig : imgg]b ) . in the first case the @xmath0-cloud of the dressed dibaryon component in the incident deuteron is picked - off of six - quark core through the interaction with the carbon target producing a @xmath6 signal ( @xmath137 ) with a well known branching ratio @xmath138 .",
    "our first estimates for the @xmath6-yield in the @xmath125c process are in an approximate agreement with the measured number of the @xmath6 events .",
    "the suggested common mechanism for the generation of a light scalar field in the roper resonance and in dressed dibaryon dynamics was observed actually also in the @xmath2 decays studied by the bes collaboration  @xcite , the crystal barrel group  @xcite and by the fermilab e760 experiment  @xcite . here",
    "the @xmath2-mesons are produced often in the states with radial excitations of @xmath139 string .",
    "the authors  @xcite have found the decay of the excited @xmath140 states ( after @xmath141-emission from excited @xmath2 states ) to proceed with dominating emission of double @xmath0-mesons .",
    "these specific transitions of @xmath139 excited strings give a good _ independent evidence _ for the discussed mechanism of the scalar field generation and thus in a way for the @xmath0-dressed intermediate dibaryon in the @xmath1 system .",
    "summarizing all these completely independent experimental findings one can conclude that there should be a common mechanism for the enhanced @xmath0-meson emission from the roper resonance decay , from the 2@xmath50-excited intermediate dibaryons , from high - energy @xmath142 collisions , and also from deexcitation of @xmath139 strings .",
    "this common mechanism can be further confirmed with many theoretical arguments presented here about the @xmath0-meson hybrid nature and chiral symmetry restoration in excited hadrons . so that the concept of @xmath0-field dressing of the intermediate dibaryon in @xmath1 system ( or alternatively @xmath143 string deexcitation mechanism into an enhanced scalar @xmath0-field ) looks to be quite convincing one .",
    "simultaneously , it seems prove the generation of the intermediate @xmath99 bag in deuteron and @xmath1 system predicted long ago  @xcite on the basis of general arguments of quark model and some experimental data .",
    "thus , the above dibaryon concept seems to open a door to the qcd - based description for nuclear phenomena .",
