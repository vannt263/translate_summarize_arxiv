    "trade involves asset exchange between partners who agree to a bartering network between themselves . within this network , there are pockets of individuals or families whose rate of flow of income derived from exchanging their own human skills in the market place is not adequate to meet their basic necessities .",
    "such people are referred to as poor and their state of living or consumption is called poverty . in order to understand the mechanics of income and consumption of such individuals , and the associated measure of poverty we embed them within a broader community of individuals endowed both with human skills as well as accumulated wealth and place them in an interacting market environment and a non - market state .    starting with the famous work of pareto @xcite , numerous ( mostly time independent ) studies @xcite have been made on the high income side , all generally converging to the same identical outcome , that of a power law tail for the large income sectors .",
    "similar power law behaviors have been noted in other noisy models involving complex networks @xcite .",
    "the low income sectors , more specifically the `` destitution margin '' , has remained largely under studied . in this article , we will extend the understanding obtained from our previous stochastic agent - based model for generating a time varying profile of income distribution @xcite , and engel curve based analysis of poverty @xcite . in our first work @xcite , the time dependence of consumption was exogenously given ( and hence could not be predicted ) . in this article , we generate time dependence of both income and consumption endogenously using the same agent - based trading model .",
    "in @xcite and @xcite , the underlying market mechanism for exchange of goods and services ( commodities and assets ) remained unexplained . in this paper , we apply the same agent - based commodity exchange model as the basis for generating the engel curve .",
    "the most significant outcome of this marriage in concepts propounded in the older papers with the new one is that the characteristic features of poverty are endogenously demarcated by the nature of trade in an agent - based model . in particular , we find agents do not engage in trading of assets or even of luxuries as long as their basic necessities are not fulfilled , a feature emerging from the work by engel , later studied by kumar , gore and sitaramam @xcite and chai and moneta @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the poverty threshold thus emerges endogenously from the model as that level of income at which income is less than consumption deprivation of essential commodities .",
    "we will use , as our defining constituent of asset exchange , food grain consumption statistics data availed from world bank @xcite .    as always",
    ", the paucity of basic resources leading to poverty can be attributed to inhomogeneity in the spread of such resources that can be largely remedied through decentralization of assets .",
    "the history of economics is replete with examples of attempts at appropriating the best possible scheme for effecting this decentralization mechanism .",
    "the issue is contentious and attempts have generally been fractious @xcite with political opinions governing the subset of assumptions based on which most of the theoretical models have been attempted . in this work",
    ", our premise will be dispassionate economic argument that is free of socio - political conduits and limit our analysis to data based facts , that will define the model largesse .",
    "this will thus be a bottom - up approach where a model will be constructed around known facts and then analyzed for quantitative agreement with real data .",
    "unfortunately poverty studies in economics made a fictitious classification of all people into two categories called `` poor '' and `` non - poor '' by defining a cut - off point of poverty level income ( the so called `` focus axiom '' by sen @xcite ) .",
    "several controversial issues arise on how that poverty level income is determined and if one can really say that someone just above that line is so different from the one just below that level to be excluded from poverty studies , etc . defining who the poor are and",
    "then to define poverty is like putting the cart before the horse .",
    "one must define what poverty is and then identify those who have high degrees of poverty and label them as poor .",
    "poverty then can be defined as deprivation in consumption of essential commodities , such as a staple food , say cereals .",
    "this is how engel studied poverty .",
    "some of our earlier works highlight these aspects in more details @xcite .",
    "the main thrust of engel curve - based measure of poverty was to reject the `` focus axiom '' of sen @xcite and decline the notion of the existence of a fine distinction between the poor and non - poor .",
    "although this argument was not well received by the mainstream economists when the seeds of the idea were initially advanced in @xcite , the arbitrary nature of the poverty line is now being addressed with renewed interest across the academic community .",
    "the starting point of our approach in this paper is to assume that there are two distinct markets , one for assets that are accumulated and saved or dissolved over time .",
    "the other market is the commodity market where goods and services needed for current consumption are traded .",
    "we assume that all people are permitted to participate in trade exchange over both markets , while a majority of the poor have a limited participation in the asset market transaction , they only trade their human skills or human capital for wage income , which is used in the other commodity markets for exchange .",
    "we do not introduce the notion of the poor and poverty line on our own , exogenously .",
    "instead we let the data tell us what kind of asset and commodity exchanges people are involved in , observe the equilibrium behavior in the commodity and asset markets to determine income distribution and the implied consumption distribution , consumption deprivation and poverty .",
    "as showed in two of our previous works @xcite , all three forms of conventional poverty measures , `` headcount index'',``poverty gap index '' and `` square poverty gap index '' suffer from an inherent arbitrariness in defining an appropriate \" poverty line  across which each such index may be measured .",
    "these are classed as statistical measures @xcite . in those studies poverty measure",
    "was defined with an exogenously and arbitrarily defined poverty line to identify who the poor are and the data were used only to estimate poverty so defined . in this study , and some of our earlier studies @xcite based on engel curves , we used data to reveal the pattern of consumption deprivation on essential commodities that gave us an observed description of existing poverty .",
    "thus our approach had an inherent congruence between theory and empirical verification . to define a more robust poverty measure , as in @xcite , we use statistics for consumption deprivation ( cd ) @xcite .",
    "cd is derived from consumption expressed as a function of income . as shown in figure [ fig_consumption ] , consumption shows an initial increase with income followed by saturation , reflecting the fact that one can not eat in proportion to an increase in earning @xcite .",
    "cd is a shortfall in consumption from this saturation level .",
    "the complementary picture is shown in figure 2 , that was previously derived and discussed in detail in @xcite ; it shows cpi - normalized deflated statistics of the income variation of the cumulative distribution functions ( cdf ) against cpi - normalized income @xmath0 .",
    "the results showed a highly interesting data collapse over all years that suggested inherent scaling in the cdf statistics .     against the expenditure @xmath0 on food grains .",
    "the data ( dots ) have been fitted against the consumption function @xmath1 using a least squares mechanism .",
    "[ fig_consumption],width=340,height=302 ]    correlating the nss income data @xmath0 with that of the expenditure on basic cereals @xmath2 , we find a good fit to a functional relationship @xcite :    @xmath3    where the parameters @xmath4 and @xmath5 are time dependent @xcite , as shown in figures [ fig_vplot ] and [ fig_kplot ] .",
    "@xmath4 is a measure of the overall amount spent per family on cereal consumption when income is very large .",
    "this is the value of @xmath2 in the plateau region of fig .",
    "[ fig_consumption ] for @xmath6 .",
    "@xmath5 , on the other hand , can be taken as the income necessary to support a consumption expense that is half of the maximum overall spend per family ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "incidentally , @xmath7 is also that level of income where consumption deprivation function and the affluence function ( the actual consumption ) will be equal .",
    "overall , the _ consumption deprivation _ relates to the actual shortfall in the income necessary to achieve the maximum possible lifestyle based on cereal consumption alone and is defined as @xmath8    in our previous work @xcite , the parameters @xmath4 and @xmath5 were fixed from data that were available on a year - by - year basis from the world bank repository @xcite . for the same reason ,",
    "the analysis there was limited to the plausible range of data without any predictive power for future times for which data is not available_. the only way to ingrain a generic time dependence in the consumption function that can probabilistically predict values of @xmath2 for future times is to have a time evolving model for @xmath9 itself , which is the main theme of this paper , although the nature of such time dynamics may be non - unique in its character .",
    "as a token departure from our previous theoretical analysis @xcite , this article treats trade in commodities , other than the basic essential commodity , and of assets other than ones own personal work skills , occurs only above a certain minimum threshold level . as detailed in our earlier works @xcite , our choice for this minimum of income threshold is the consumption deprivation function @xmath10 which is the amount of income lacking in an income class @xmath11 that is needed to sustain trade above the poverty ( or inequality ) level , that , then is a function of the income @xmath12 at time @xmath13 . while the increase in the spending power of the entire population is a motivating factor and a goal for growth in income , a transfer of wealth ( e.g. investment by agent @xmath11 through trade ) will result in decreased spending power for this agent that will oppose the positive growth rate defined by @xmath14 .",
    "but such a transfer of wealth can now only happen when the income @xmath12 is greater than the consumption deprivation @xmath15 .",
    "what this implies is that a household will not have any savings in assets as long as the income is less than the consumption deprivation .",
    "the resultant stochastic ( langevin ) model that we then get from this construction is as follows    @xmath16    where @xmath17 is the maximum level of income ( proportional to the mean growth rate @xmath18 of income ) at time @xmath13 for the @xmath19 class of individuals would like to aim at but achieve only a fraction of it in each period .",
    "this is a sum of desired consumption expenditure and desired savings .",
    "this is thus partly an adaptive behavior , the first term being a motivational force that creates incentives to increase the level of income , and the second term , on the other hand , defines how increase in income is offset by a decrease in income available for consumption in the current period ( due to savings ) .",
    "it assumes that a proportion @xmath20 of income is saved and is not available for spending in the current period .",
    "@xmath21 is a stochastic factor generated by the uncertain market environment ; greater the value of income and trade , the larger is the stochastic disturbance to modulate the income .",
    "the contribution coming from this market uncertainty depends on the choice of distribution @xcite .",
    "since a market consists of both assets and commodities ( goods and services consumed ) , we can decompose income into expenditure on commodities and savings .    in this article",
    ", we are primarily considering two separate markets , asset markets and commodity markets .",
    "when we deal with the commodity markets , the monetary asset allocated for consumption expenditure is taken as given , taken from the asset market solution .    our earlier papers @xcite and @xcite dealt with the asset market equilibrium and determined the equilibrium income distribution .",
    "in this paper , we take that solution as given and examine the commodity exchange market the same way as we examined the asset market equilibrium . the basic idea of trading of commodities for consumption between agents",
    "remains more or less same as in @xcite : an agent @xmath11 can spend an amount @xmath22 while being subjected to stochastic effects of trading @xmath21 at time @xmath13 .",
    "the rate of increase of the agent s ability to spend more money on a commodity will be principally determined by two factors , the ( time dependent ) maximum consumption expenditure on essential commodities by the entire reference population to which the household belongs , @xmath4 , and total income available for consumption expenditure as derived from the asset market distribution .",
    "we are thus assuming a recursive behavior , making a decision on work , income and savings first and then using the income available for consumption to make consumption expenditure decisions .",
    "what we do now is to integrate the expenditure dynamics , including consumption deprivation , with the income distribution dynamics that is based on an ito calculus scheme @xcite .",
    "the above form of the stochastic income - expenditure growth rate above the threshold line @xmath23 leads to the following fokker - planck equation @xcite which depicts the time rate of change of the income distribution function    @xmath24 \\:{\\hat f } + \\nonumber \\\\ & + & y^2\\:\\frac{\\partial { \\hat f}}{\\partial y}\\bigg\\ } \\label{fokker - planck}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the coupled dynamics described above , involving the probability density function of income @xmath25 and the consumption deprivation function @xmath26 , represents the fact that effective trade only ensues when the effective mean income overshoots the actual mean @xmath27 by a factor of @xmath26 .    in the steady state @xmath28 and @xmath29 ( @xmath30 limit ) , which gives us the steady state income distribution :",

    "the parameter @xmath20 varies from economy to economy and can be evaluated from data . for our study , we use the indian data recorded in the indian national sample survey ( nss ) @xcite spanning 43 years ( 1959 - 2002 ) across 25 surveys and sampling about 7 million income data .",
    "only food consumption statistics has been used , that being the modicum of basic life disbursement for the lowest income sectors ( destitute ) .",
    "the monthly income / expense data are made available across various income sectors , popularly known as `` expenditure classes '' , using which the cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) was plotted .",
    "the cdf led to the probability density function ( pdf ) .",

    "surely , such a change will initiate a competition of two opposing forces of economics : one that will try to `` neutralize '' the effects of this spike in deprivation through isotropic homogenization of assets across all wealth states characterized by @xmath0 and the other that will strive to work against this dialectics by maximizing a `` lateral growth '' leading to _ wealth piling _ in nearest income states @xmath45 .",

    "the dynamical equation ( [ langevin ] ) also gives some indication of the effect of redistributed income between expenditure classes on overall mean income .",
    "typically we find that such redistribution reduces poverty during the period of application , but suppresses the mean income , such that if the redistribution is removed ( or , in the long term , even if it remains ) then the poverty may increase again , unless some external agent , such as improved technology , contributes in a still faster rate of increase of the mean income .    in summary",
    ", we have generalized the scopes of our earlier work on alternative and self - consistent poverty index calculations based on mathematical models @xcite , now to include probabilistic measurements of the inequality index above the minimum income threshold line .",
    "the data used in our analysis were confined to years 1959 - 1992 but using relatively recent data from years 1993 and 2004 , two not - so - close years where the fiscal dynamics are expected to be relatively independent of each other , results obtained from our model compare favorably with the representative hci indices ( www.worldbank.org ) as would be evident from the approximately parallel lines in figure [ fig_povi ] . beyond 1992 ,",
    "though , our model predicts a much slower precipitation of the poverty index ( pi ) compared to the conventional head count index , eventually reaching an effective plateau at around year 2004 - 5 ; we take this as a clear signature of a fast stabilizing economy ( india in this case ) that seems to be justified from analysis of recent data for the year 2004 - 5 @xcite .",
    "the combination of results from numerical solution of equation ( [ burgers_new ] ) as shown in figure 7 and the engel fit form @xmath94 for 2004 - 5 data @xcite proves that the corresponding income needed to consume an amount @xmath95 (= 69.5 ) is matched by a corresponding saturation income of @xmath96 (= 236.94 ) . in other words ,",
    "our model is robust enough to forecast an effective `` steady state '' in the poverty dynamics of the indian economy at around 2004 - 5 that shows up as a plateau in the pi time profile .",
    "this result is a major improvement over the hci index based conventional studies which fail to detect this steady state .",
    "such a confirmation demonstrates the strength of this new model based approach ; this also emphasizes the need for such alternate poverty measures over the conventional hci / pg / spg based poverty evaluation . while in the absence of any dynamic models for the dominant parameters ( @xmath71 and @xmath7 ) , predictions can never be `` full proof '' , the present approach transcends all previous modeling results in the robustness of its prediction accuracy .",
    "our model is based only on cereal consumption .",
    "the data capture from the real world data would be hopefully much better if the model is based on a multi - market trade equilibrium using consumption expenditure data on several commodities .",
    "current works are in progress to enhance the scopes of the theoretical model even further by including non - essential foods and non - food grain statistics in a multivariate structure to arrive at an even more robust description of the poverty index .",

    "<S> lett . * 91 * , 58003 , 2010 ) , based on food consumption statistics , we showed how a stochastic agent based model could represent the time variation of the income distribution statistics in a developing economy , thereby leading to the definition of an alternative and more preferable `` poverty index '' ( pi ) that compared favorably with the actual poverty gap ( pg ) index data . </S>",
    "<S> the new poverty index was defined based on two variables , the probability density function ( pdf ) of the income statistics and the consumption deprivation ( cd ) function , a mathematical function representing the shortfall in the minimum consumption needed for survival . </S>",
    "<S> this starting model used an agent - based interaction mechanism for asset transactions to generate the time - dependent income distribution , while leaving unexplained how the minimum consumption needed for survival is determined in a time dependent manner . </S>",
    "<S> the time dependence of the cd function was introduced there through data extrapolation only and not through endogenous generation of a time dependent series . </S>",
    "<S> the present article overcomes these limitations and arrives at a new probabilistic paradigm of poverty modeling . </S>",
    "<S> a new unified theoretical structure has been developed that treats all economic agents as interacting agents engaged in the trade of goods and services leading to time varying consumption and income distributions . here </S>",
    "<S> the minimum threshold of income is defined by consumption deprivation ( cd ) where commodity trade would not take place beyond the basic necessities . </S>",
    "<S> our results reveal that the nature of time variation of the cd function leads to a downward trend in the threshold level of consumption of basic necessities , suggesting a possible dietary transition in terms of lower saturation level of food - grain consumption required for survival . </S>",
    "<S> this study reinforces and strengthens our benchmark original study on poverty analysis based on engel curves and consumption deprivation . </S>",
    "<S> the poverty index profile presented here , based on a dynamic model of agent - based trading , conforms to recently observed trends more closely than what the conventional measures of poverty ( head count index , poverty gap index and squared poverty gap index ) have failed to depict . </S>"
