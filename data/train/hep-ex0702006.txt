    "the peccei - quinn ( pq ) mechanism  @xcite remains perhaps the most compelling explanation of the cp problem of strong interactions .",
    "the existence of a new chiral @xmath2 symmetry that is spontaneously broken at some large energy scale @xmath3 would allow for the dynamical restoration of the cp symmetry in qcd .",
    "an inevitable consequence of this mechanism is the existence of axions , the nambu - goldstone bosons of @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "axions are pseudoscalar particles with properties closely related to those of neutral pions . in particular , their mass and interaction strengths can be obtained by a simple rescaling from the corresponding @xmath5 properties ( see equations  ( [ eq3 ] ) and ( [ eq : axionphoton ] ) below ) .",
    "unsuccessful experimental searches  @xcite and astrophysical limits  @xcite imply that axions , if they exist , must be very light and very weakly interacting , yet they are not necessarily harmless because they are a leading candidate for the cold dark matter of the universe  @xcite .",
    "moreover , several approaches to a unified description of dark energy and dark matter involving pseudo nambu - goldstone bosons have been put forward recently  @xcite .",
    "experimental strategies to find `` invisible axions '' or more general `` axion - like particles '' ( alps ) include the cavity searches for galactic dark matter axions  @xcite , searches for solar axions based on the `` helioscope '' method  @xcite , the bragg scattering technique  @xcite or the resonant method involving nuclear couplings  @xcite , the polarization of light propagating through a transverse magnetic field  @xcite , and the photon regeneration method  @xcite .",
    "almost all of these past , present or future experiments rely on the axion coupling to two photons that is described by the lagrangian term @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the axion field , @xmath8 the electromagnetic field - strength tensor , @xmath9 its dual , @xmath10 the electric , and @xmath11 the magnetic field .",
    "the axion - photon coupling strength is quantified by @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are quark - mass ratios .",
    "the canonical values frequently used in the axion literature are @xmath15 and @xmath16  @xcite , although , for example , @xmath17 could lie in the range 0.30.6  @xcite . however , by",
    "far the largest uncertainty in the relation between @xmath18 and @xmath3 comes from the model - dependent ratio @xmath19 of the electromagnetic and color anomalies of the axial current associated with the axion field .",
    "frequently cited generic examples are the kim - shifman - vainshtein - zakharov ( ksvz ) model  @xcite where @xmath20 and the dine - fischler - srednicki - zhitnitskii ( dfsz ) model  @xcite where @xmath21 , but a much broader range of possibilities exists  @xcite .",
    "the ksvz model often serves as a prototype for a hadronic model where axions do not couple directly to ordinary quarks and charged leptons .",
    "the second parameter relevant for axion searches is the axion mass , that is related to the pq symmetry breaking scale @xmath3 by @xmath22 where @xmath15 was assumed .",
    "here , @xmath23 mev is the pion mass and @xmath24  mev is its decay constant . in terms of the axion mass ,",
    "the axion - photon coupling is @xmath25 this linear relationship between @xmath18 and @xmath26 defines the `` axion line '' for a given axion model in the @xmath18@xmath26 parameter space , the axion - photon coupling can be positive or negative . in the following we always mean @xmath27 when we write @xmath18 , i.e. , we always take @xmath18 to be a positive number . ] . barring fine - tuned cancellations ,",
    "qcd axions are expected to lie near the narrow band of parameters in the @xmath18@xmath26 plane that is defined by the corresponding @xmath5 properties .",
    "currently , laboratory searches for axions from the sun  @xcite are being extended by the cern axion solar telescope ( cast ) .",
    "it takes advantage of the expected solar axion flux that would be produced by the primakoff effect , i.e. , the conversion of thermal photons in the sun into axions in the presence of the electric fields of the charged particles in the solar interior .",
    "cast itself then uses the reverse process of coherent axion - photon conversion in a `` magnetic telescope , '' i.e. , in the bores of a 9.26  m long lhc dipole magnet oriented toward the sun .",
    "cast has recently reported the best experimental limit obtained so far of @xmath28 for @xmath1  ev  @xcite .",
    "this limit is comparable to the most severe constraint from the population of horizontal - branch ( hb ) stars in globular clusters that implies @xmath29  @xcite .",
    "here we report new results from the cast experiment obtained in 2004 with improved conditions in all detectors .",
    "in addition , the solar axion flux is calculated from a modern solar model for the purpose of the cast data interpretation .",
    "for the first time we obtained better sensitivity than that arising from energy - loss arguments on globular cluster stars .",
    "the result reported here provides our final limit for the cast vacuum setup ( so - called cast phase  i ) where the sensitivity is essentially limited to @xmath30  ev as explained below .",
    "this implies that cast has not yet reached the `` axion line '' in the @xmath18@xmath26 space , but rather provides the most restrictive limits on the two - photon vertex of axion - like particles that are somewhat lighter for a given interaction strength that expected for qcd axions .",
    "meanwhile , cast has been refurbished as a tuning experiment , planning to explore the mass region up to about 1  ev ( cast phase ii ) .",
    "cast will then probe qcd axion models and will also be sensitive to the existence of large extra dimensions  @xcite , introduced in the world - brane scenarios to solve the hierarchy problem in particle physics  @xcite .",
    "we begin in section  [ sec : axflux ] with a new calculation of the solar axion flux . in section  [ sec : cast ] we briefly describe the cast experiment . in section  [ sec : data ] we report the 2004 measurements and their analysis . in section  [ sec : castphasei ] we present the combined result of the cast phase  i and conclude in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "particles that interact with photons by the lagrangian of equation  ( [ eq1 ] ) are produced in a hot thermal plasma by virtue of the fluctuating electric and magnetic fields , i.e. , the fluctuations of @xmath31 in the plasma act as a source for the production of axions or similar particles .",
    "scalar particles couple to @xmath32 instead of @xmath33 for pseudoscalars .",
    "hence for scalars , the fluctuations of @xmath34 and @xmath35 would play the analogous role . in principle , the axion emission rate for a given temperature , density and chemical composition can be calculated directly from the spectrum of @xmath36 fluctuations as was done for a degenerate plasma in  @xcite .",
    "for the purpose of calculating the solar axion flux , this formalism gives the same result as the simpler approach where one calculates different `` processes '' contributing to the emission rate  @xcite .",
    "the dominant contribution derives from those fluctuations where @xmath10 is provided by the charged particles of the medium whereas @xmath11 comes from propagating thermal photons .",
    "this is the usual primakoff process where a photon converts into an axion in the electric field of a charged particle . of course , in a plasma the charged particles",
    "are correlated in such a way that charges are screened beyond a certain distance , an effect that is crucial to take into account .",
    "other emission processes that are subdominant include the `` electro - primakoff effect '' where the @xmath11 field is provided by a moving electric charge , i.e. , the axion is produced from two virtual photons , each attached to a charged particle  @xcite . in the sun , all particles , including the electrons , are nonrelativistic so that the @xmath11 fields associated with moving electric charges are small , explaining that the electro - primakoff effect is much less important than the ordinary primakoff effect involving real photons .",
    "axions or similar particles typically will also interact with other particles in the plasma , notably the electrons and nuclei . however , in the absence of a signal it is conservative to use only those processes at the source that are implied by the very interaction structure that is used for the detection , i.e. , the axion - two photon vertex .",
    "moreover , for qcd axion models , the solar fluxes derived from other processes are expected to be much smaller than the primakoff - induced flux if we take account of stellar energy - loss limits on these interactions .",
    "therefore , our results are especially relevant for hadronic axions that do not couple to electrons at tree level so that the primakoff process is expected to be the dominant process and a non - observation of axions by cast provides new and nontrivial limits .",
    "the transition rate for a photon of energy @xmath37 into an axion of the same energy by the primakoff effect in a stellar plasma is  @xcite @xmath38\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath39 is the temperature ( natural units with @xmath40 are used ) .",
    "recoil effects are neglected so that the photon and axion energies are taken to be equal .",
    "the screening scale in the debye - hckel approximation  is @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the electron number density and @xmath43 the number density of the @xmath44-th ion of charge @xmath45 .",
    "the total axion number flux at the earth ( average solar distance @xmath46 from the earth )  is @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the bose - einstein distribution of the thermal photon bath in the solar plasma and @xmath49 is a dimensionless solar radial variable , normalized to the solar radius @xmath50 .",
    "we take into account the plasma frequency for the photons in the system @xmath51 it enters the dispersion relation as @xmath52 so that @xmath53 . of course , the value of the plasma frequency depends on the radial position in the sun .",
    "the approximations used in this calculation give us the axion flux for the range of x - ray energies relevant for cast and also give us the total number flux and total energy loss rate , with an estimated precision of a few percent .",
    "however , at energies near and below a typical solar plasma frequency , i.e. , for energies near or below 0.3  kev , this calculation is not appropriate because the charged particles were treated as static sources of electric fields , neglecting both recoil effects and collective motions .",
    "the charged particles of the plasma themselves undergo plasma oscillations with frequencies near @xmath54 .",
    "therefore , even though the thermal photon energies are cut off below @xmath54 , the emitted axion energies can reach down to zero  @xcite , although with a steeply falling spectrum .",
    "for applications where this low - energy flux might be of interest , perhaps the small solar axion flux at optical energies , a new calculation is needed that properly includes the dynamical aspects of the collective plasma motions , not only the static screening effects that are included here .",
    "the x - ray telescope used in cast is an imaging device so that we do not necessarily want to treat the sun as a point source .",
    "we determine the differential solar axion flux as an apparent surface luminosity @xmath55 of the solar disk .",
    "put another way , we determine the flux per unit surface area of the two - dimensional solar disk as a function of the dimensionless radial coordinate @xmath56 .",
    "the total axion number flux at the earth  is @xmath57 i.e. ,  @xmath58 is in units of @xmath59 per unit surface area .",
    "the unit surface area is dimensionless because the radial coordinate @xmath60 on the solar disk is dimensionless . of course , instead of using a dimensionless variable @xmath60 that is normalized to the solar radius",
    ", we could use one that is normalized to the apparent angular radius of the sun in the sky . in this case",
    ", @xmath58 is to be multiplied with @xmath61 , giving us the surface flux per steradians of solid angle and therefore the @xmath62-integration in equation  ( [ eq : fluxintegration ] ) would extend to the angular radius @xmath63 of the sun .    to determine the surface luminosity @xmath58 we re -",
    "write the integral over the solar volume as @xmath64 we assume the sun to be projected on a 2-dimensional disk , i.e. , we neglect parallax effects , where the ratio @xmath65 sets the accuracy level of this approximation",
    ". we may then write the volume integral as @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the dimensionless radial position in the sun where the physical variables ( temperature , density , etc . )",
    "have to be taken from a solar model .",
    "altogether we find @xmath68 where @xmath69 and @xmath70 are to be taken at the position @xmath67 .      in order to perform these integrations",
    "we use a recent solar model for which detailed data are publicly available , the 2004 model of bahcall and pinsonneault  @xcite , which is tabulated on a fine grid ( 1071 points ) .",
    "the axion flux parameters  are found to  be @xmath71 where @xmath72 .",
    "the maximum of the distribution is at @xmath73  kev . for self - consistency",
    "we have used the values of the solar radius ( @xmath74 ) and of the solar luminosity ( @xmath75 ) from  @xcite .    ) and an older solar model published in 1982  @xcite ( @xmath76 . an axion - photon coupling of @xmath77  gev@xmath78 is assumed.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    in figure  [ fig : solar - flux ]",
    "we compare the differential axion flux obtained from this model with that from the 1982 model  @xcite that was used in an earlier calculation of the solar axion flux  @xcite .",
    "even though a large number of details has changed , standard solar models and their neutrino predictions have remained remarkably robust .",
    "the same is true for the axion flux prediction that depends only mildly on the exact solar model .",
    "even though details of our understanding of the sun may change in the future , the solar neutrino measurement of all active flavors  @xcite has provided a direct verification of the sun s inner properties so that it is hard to imagine that adopting a standard solar model for the axion flux calculation could be a source of gross error .",
    "an analytic approximation to the solar axion flux spectrum may sometimes be useful . instead of the analytic form proposed by van bibber et al .",
    "@xcite , we find that an excellent fit is provided by a three - parameter function of the kind @xmath79 here , @xmath80 is a normalization constant while the fit parameter @xmath81 coincides with the average energy , @xmath82 .",
    "if we match the number flux , average energy , and width of the numerical spectrum with such a fit , we find ( energies in kev ) @xmath83 the fit is accurate at better than about the @xmath84 level in the interval 1 to 11  kev , while the relative accuracy is bad at very low or very high energies .    in figure",
    "[ fig : axionspec - radius - dependance ] we show a contour plot of the solar surface luminosity in axions @xmath55 as a function of axion energy @xmath37 ( kev ) and a dimensionless radial coordinate @xmath60 on the solar disk .",
    "we also show the solar axion flux as a function of the energy for several values of @xmath60 for an axion - photon coupling @xmath85 .",
    "most of the axion flux emerges from the inner 20% of the solar disk .",
    "cast can detect solar axions only if these particles actually escape from the sun after production . to estimate the axion mean free path ( mfp ) in the sun",
    "we note that the photon - axion conversion rate of equation  ( [ eq : gamma - ag ] ) is identical ( in natural units ) with the inverse mfp of a photon with energy @xmath37 based on the primakoff process . since we work in the recoil - free approximation where the energy of the photon and axion are identical , equation  ( [ eq : gamma - ag ] )",
    "also gives us the inverse mfp for the reverse process of an axion with energy @xmath37 to be converted to a photon , i.e. , of axion absorption . as an example we consider an axion with energy 4  kev , near the average of the expected spectrum , and note that the temperature at the solar center is @xmath86  kev whereas the screening scale is @xmath87  kev",
    "the axion mfp is then found to be @xmath88 , or about @xmath89 of the radius of the visible universe .",
    "therefore , in the absence of other interactions , the axion - photon coupling would have to be more than @xmath90 times larger than the cast limit for axions to be re - absorbed within the sun .",
    "however , even in this extreme case axions are not harmless for the solar structure because they would then carry the bulk of the energy flux within the sun that otherwise is carried by photons .",
    "low - mass particles that are trapped in the sun should interact so strongly that their mfp is smaller than that of photons  @xcite .",
    "note that the photon mfp for the conditions near the solar center is less than 1  mm . only particles with a mfp not much larger than this will leave the solar structure unaffected .",
    "they will cause a gross acceleration of the rate of energy transfer in the sun and other stars if their mfp is much larger than this .",
    "these requirements are so extreme that for anything like axions the possibility of re - absorption is not a serious possibility .",
    "our final limit , equation  ( [ finalresult ] ) , on the axion - photon coupling implies that the solar axion flux is bounded by @xmath91 .",
    "self - consistent solar models including axion losses were constructed in  @xcite .",
    "in particular , it was found that helioseismological measurements of the sound - speed profile do not exclude @xmath18 much below @xmath92 where @xmath93 would be around @xmath94 .",
    "it was also found that for @xmath95 , where @xmath96 , the @xmath97b solar neutrino flux would exceed the standard prediction by about 20% . while the all - flavor @xmath97b flux has been measured by sno with a precision of about 8.8% @xcite ,",
    "the uncertainties of the flux prediction are of order 20% @xcite .",
    "we conclude that the solar axion flux corresponding to the cast limit is far below the range where it would affect helioseismology or the measured solar neutrino flux in significant ways . for the purpose of cast",
    "it is therefore justified to treat the solar axion losses as a negligible perturbation of the standard solar models .",
    "a detailed description of a proposed method of detecting solar axions by the cern axion solar telescope has been given elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "here we only recall that cast uses a decommissioned large hadron collider ( lhc ) prototype magnet with a field of @xmath98 t in the interior of two parallel pipes of length @xmath99 m and a cross - sectional area @xmath100 .",
    "the magnet is mounted on a moving platform with low - background x - ray detectors on either end , allowing it to track the sun about 3 hours per day .",
    "solar axions of a broad energy spectrum which peaks at @xmath101  kev , essentially reflecting the thermal conditions in the solar interior , may be converted into real photons inside the transverse magnetic field .",
    "the probability of this conversion in vacuum  @xcite is @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the photon - axion momentum difference .",
    "therefore , the axion signal should appear as an excess of photons above background in three different x - ray detectors , a conventional time projection chamber ( tpc ) , a gaseous chamber micromegas ( mm ) , and an x - ray telescope with a charge coupled device ( ccd ) as focal plane detector , when the sun and magnet are aligned .",
    "a differential flux of photons of @xmath104 is expected at the end of the magnet in case of the coherent conversion which occurs for @xmath105 , providing for the cast sensitivity to the axion mass of up to 0.02  ev . here",
    "@xmath106 is the axion spectrum at the earth , expressed by the analytic approximation  ( [ bestfit ] ) . for @xmath107 the sensitivity",
    "is reduced owing to the photon - axion momentum mismatch . to search for more massive axions ,",
    "coherence can be restored by filling the magnetic conversion region with a low-@xmath108 gas whose pressure is adjusted in such a way that plasma frequency , which acts as an effective mass for the photon , equals the axion mass  @xcite . as one can see from equation  ( [ eq5 ] ) , due to the @xmath109 rate suppression , a lot of effort is required to improve the existing limits on axions significantly .",
    "the new data taking has been performed after dismounting and remounting the entire setup for the x - ray detection , with some changes in the detectors , in the materials placed nearby , and in the operating conditions with respect to the data taking considered in our previous paper  @xcite .      the x - ray mirror telescope with a ccd as the focal plane detector is placed behind one of the magnet bores at the west end of the magnet and is looking for x - rays from `` sunrise '' axions . the sensitivity of the x - ray telescope is significantly improved compared to the 2003 data taking period by a continuous monitoring of its pointing stability , which allows us to exploit the full potential of the system . as a consequence , the area on the ccd where the axion signal is expected could be reduced by a factor of 5.8 compared to 2003 .",
    "in addition , after adding new internal and external shielding components , the background level has been reduced by a factor of 1.5 in comparison with the 2003 setup .",
    "the ccd detector has shown a stable performance over the entire 2004 running period and has acquired 197  h of tracking data ( when the magnet was pointing to the sun ) and 1890  h of background data ( taken from the same area during the non - tracking periods ) . for a detailed description of the x - ray telescope design , its performance , and background systematics during the 2004 data taking period we refer to  @xcite . although no significant excess signal over background could be detected with the x - ray telescope during the data taking period of 2004 , a new upper limit on the axion - photon coupling",
    "could be derived . in the following sections we summarize the analysis techniques and results we obtained for the x - ray telescope .          as described in section  [ sec : integration - over - solar ] the solar axion surface luminosity @xmath55 is a function of axion energy @xmath37 and the distance from the center of the solar disk @xmath60 , see figure  [ fig : axionspec - radius - dependance ] and equation  ( [ eq : axion - surface - luminosity ] ) . the differential axion spectrum emitted by a circular region on the solar disk can be calculated by integrating @xmath55 from the center of the solar disk up to a radius @xmath60 , resulting in spectra as shown in the right part of figure  [ fig : axionspec - radius - dependance ] .",
    "it is apparent that not only the integral flux changes , but the peak energy of the spectrum slightly shifts towards lower energies for increasing @xmath60 .",
    "for @xmath110 the spectrum peaks at lowest energies .",
    "therefore , a photon signal resulting from axion - to - photon conversion in the magnet bore subsequently observed by the ccd would show a similar energy and radial intensity dependence , after being modified by the spatial response function of the x - ray optics ( point spread function ",
    "psf ) and the energy response of the ccd detector .    to characterize the spatial intensity distribution of a potential axion signal on the ccd detector",
    ", we multiplied the axion solar surface luminosity by @xmath111 of equation  ( [ eq4 ] ) and folded the resulting distribution with the point spread function of the x - ray telescope . the corresponding intensity distribution ( axion spot image ) we would expect on the ccd chip is shown in figure  [ fig : ccd - backrgound - distribution - axion - spot ] .",
    "the axion spot image is slightly distorted from a mere circular shape due to the psf of the x - ray mirror optics  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the image is enlarged compared to an axion solar spot image multiplied with the scale factor of the mirror optics assuming a perfect linear imaging characteristics .",
    "the latter effect is a direct consequence of the finite spatial resolution of the optics , the spatial resolution of the detector ( pixel size ) , and the limited pointing accuracy of the cast tracking system ( @xmath112 ) which spread the image of a point source . for our simulations we did not take into account either that the psf depends on photon energy or the fact that it is in general a function of the position on the detector ( off - axis angle ) .",
    "we verified that both effects are of minor importance for cast , because the image is close to the optical axis , i.e. , we have to deal with small off - axis angles , and we expect a signal in a relative narrow energy band ( @xmath113@xmath114kev ) .    for a fixed @xmath26 ,",
    "the measured count - rate spectrum from axion - to - photon conversion is calculated by @xmath115 where @xmath116 is the count rate detected in detector energy channel @xmath117 in units of counts  s@xmath78 , @xmath118 is the effective area of the x - ray telescope in units of @xmath119 , @xmath120 is the detector response function , and @xmath121 is the differential spectrum of photons resulting from axion - to - photon conversion in the magnet for a given @xmath122 , @xmath123 , and the radius @xmath60 in units of the solar radius @xmath124 .",
    "the radius @xmath60 directly corresponds to the radius of a circular signal area @xmath125 we used to extract the potential signal , where @xmath125 is given in detector pixel coordinates .",
    "this signal area is centered at the location where we expect the maximum signal intensity on the ccd chip .",
    "the effective area of the x - ray telescope includes the quantum efficiency of the detector , the mirror reflectivity , the influence of the finite size of the axion emission region on the sun , and geometric effects due to , e.g. , the finite diameter of the magnet bore ( e.g. vignetting , see  @xcite ) .              for a fixed location of the signal - spot on the ccd",
    "we expect that an optimum spot radius @xmath125 exists , such that the signal - to - noise ratio of the ccd detector has a maximum . in order to find the best radius , we used the signal - to - noise ratio depending on @xmath125 for different @xmath123according to @xmath126 where @xmath127 is the number of counts from axion - to - photon conversion expected in the signal region for a specific @xmath123 , calculated from equation  ( [ eq : count - spectrum ] ) by summing over all energy bins in the @xmath113@xmath128 energy range .",
    "further , @xmath129 is the number of background counts we expect in a spot with the same area and location . to determine @xmath129 we used the background data which provides enough statistics [ @xmath130 counts ] to avoid the optimization to be biased by low counting statistics .",
    "the background data was observed under the same axion sensitive conditions as during tracking while we were not pointing to the sun ( see right panel of figure  [ fig : ccd - background - distribution ] ) .",

    "we compared the result derived with the maximum - likelihood estimator defined in equation  ( [ eq : ccd - likelihood ] ) with different other maximum - likelihood techniques based on an unbinned maximum - likelihood estimator , a folded extended likelihood estimator , a binned likelihood estimator that takes into account the spectral shape of the observed background , and an extended likelihood estimator with poissonian convolution . according to our monte carlo simulations all methods are unbiased and yield identical results .",
    "we stress that in the absence of a signal ( background - dominated regime ) , the upper limit on @xmath18 does not improve when taking the expected intensity distribution in the axion spot shown in figure  [ fig : ccd - backrgound - distribution - axion - spot ] into account .",

    "as stated in @xcite statistically significant variations of the background on long ( months ) and short time scales ( hours to days ) are not apparent from the x - ray telescope data .",
    "even if the background level would be time - dependent , it would not play a significant role , since we measure the potential signal ( signal - spot ) and background ( area around the signal - spot ) simultaneously .",
    "a crucial point in the analysis is the definition of the area where the background is taken from .",
    "ideally , if the background is homogeneous spatially distributed , the area surrounding and close to the signal spot could be used .",
    "since we observed no significant difference between the background level and spatial distribution during tracking and non - tracking times , we used the same signal - spot area during the non - tracking periods to define the background .",
    "alternatively , we used tracking data and different regions on the ccd outside the signal - spot area to estimate the systematic uncertainties due to the choice of the background definition . the overall systematic uncertainty is dominated by both the background definition and the pointing accuracy , that affects the effective area of the telescope , the location of the signal - spot and its size respectively .",
    "other effects such as uncertainties in the detector calibration and magnet parameters are negligible . for the best fit value of @xmath109 we find @xmath149 an effect of the systematic uncertainties on the upper limit on @xmath18",
    "is estimated to be less than @xmath150 5% .",
    "the tpc  @xcite , covering both bores of the east end of the magnet and facing `` sunset '' axions , was operated continuously during the entire 2004 data taking period and acquired @xmath151 of tracking data and @xmath152 of background data .",
    "the main difference between the 2003 and 2004 experimental setup were the operation of a new differential pumping system and an improved passive shield for the detector .",
    "the purpose of the differential pumping system is to decrease the effect of gas leaks towards the magnet and to minimize the possibility of damage to the tpc windows due to sudden pressure changes or break down . as a result of the smooth operation of the tpc detector , the exposure time during 2004 was five times higher compared to 2003 .",
    "the tpc is housed in a low radioactive , 5  mm thick copper box inside a low radioactive multicomponent shield ( 22  cm of polyethylene , 1  mm of cd and 2.5  cm of pb ) .",
    "the entire shield is permanently flushed with nitrogen , creating an over pressure which decreases the radon contamination close to the detector .",
    "the installation of the shield has reduced the tpc background level in the region between 1 and 10 kev by a factor of 4.3 compared to the background level of 2003 .",
    "the typical differential counting rate in this energy interval is @xmath153 counts",
    "@xmath154 s@xmath78 kev@xmath78 .",
    "one of the most important advantages of the improved background suppression is that the observed background is almost independent of the magnet pointing direction , which was not the case during the 2003 data taking period .",
    "the micromegas detector is placed behind the other bore at the west end of the magnet .",
    "the new mm  @xcite was specifically designed to eliminate the cross talk effects present at the previous detector and to improve the quality of the strips .",
    "the smooth operation of the improved mm detector during the 2004 data taking period , combined with the development of more effective off - line analysis techniques , allowed for further reduction of the background level by a factor of 2.5 compared to the 2003 running period . due to the stability of the detector and the experiment in general , it was possible to accumulate @xmath155 of tracking data and @xmath156 of background data .",
    "the resulting background counting rate is @xmath157  counts  @xmath154  s@xmath78  kev@xmath78 in the 18.5  kev energy range .",

    "the hardware efficiency with respect to the photon energy has been simulated using the geant4 toolkit and verified by theoretical calculations and experimental data from the detectors that were characterized in the panter test facility in munich  @xcite .",
    "the results presented here were obtained after the analysis of the tpc and mm 2004 data sets listed in table  [ data04 ] .",
    "the analysis was performed by standard @xmath136 minimization .",
    "the accumulated effective background spectrum , properly normalized , was subtracted from the corresponding tracking spectrum and the resulting data was fitted with the theoretical axion signal ) and multiplied by the detection efficiency curves . ] which scales with @xmath109 for various @xmath26 .",
    "the obtained results are given in table  [ data04 ] , showing no significant excess of axion - to - photon conversion - like events .",
    "therefore , an upper limit on @xmath18 at 95% confidence level was calculated for each of the data sets following the bayesian scheme ( shown in the last column of table  [ data04 ] ) .",
    "the corresponding fits are plotted in figure  [ tpc ] .",
    "the experimental systematic uncertainties on the present limits have been studied .",
    "the daily variation of the background caused by the environmental radon is the dominant factor in the study of systematics for the mm analysis .",
    "most of its effect is eliminated by using background data taken at times of the day as close as possible as the tracking times .",
    "the resulting upper limits for different choices of effective backgrounds clearly suggest that the systematic uncertainty is less than 2% .",
    "systematic effects in the fitting procedure of the tpc data are considered by varying the background level until the null hypothesis test ( in areas of the detector where no signal is expected ) yields a result with a probability smaller than 5% .",
    "if taken as an uncertainty , this range corresponds to @xmath150 10% variation of the upper limit .",
    "the best fit values of @xmath109 obtained for each of the detector s 2004 data are reported in table  [ data04 ] together with their @xmath171 error and the corresponding @xmath172 values and degrees of freedom .",
    "each of the data set is individually compatible with the absence of any signal .",
    "a combined result has been obtained by multiplying the bayesian probabilities of the three fits to get a combined probability function and obtaining the value of @xmath109 that encompasses 95% of its physically allowed ( i.e. positive signals ) part .",
    "the result of this operation is @xmath173 at 95% cl .",
    "the same operation , including in the multiplication also the bayesian probability functions of the 2003 data sets  @xcite listed in table  [ data04 ] , gives a final limit for the cast vacuum setup of @xmath174 this value is valid for @xmath30  ev where the expected signal is mass independent because the axion - photon oscillation length far exceeds the length of the magnet .",
    "for higher @xmath26 , the overall signal strength diminishes rapidly and the spectral shape differs ( see equation  ( [ eq4 ] ) ) .",
    "the described procedure was repeated for different values of @xmath26 to get the entire 95% cl exclusion line .",
    "the region excluded in the @xmath18@xmath26 plane is shown in figure  [ exclusion ] together with the results of other experiments as well as astrophysical and cosmological constraints .",
    "the statistical limit on the sensitivity is mostly set by the value of @xmath175 in the lhc test magnet . in general , the systematic uncertainties on the background spectrum due to its position and time dependence and due to the pointing accuracy are estimated to have an effect of less than @xmath150  5% in the final upper limit obtained , that is dominated by the result of the x - ray telescope .",
    "we have searched for the coherent production of photons in a decommissioned lhc test magnet of @xmath176 m and @xmath177 t , assuming the existence of an incident axion flux that is emitted from the sun by the primakoff process .",
    "improvements to this experiment relative to the published 2003 results come from several changes in the detectors , in the shielding , and in the operating conditions .    in conclusion",
    ", we obtained the currently best experimental limit on the axion - photon coupling which is by a factor 1.3 more restrictive than the cast limit previously reported  @xcite .",
    "for axion masses less than 0.02  ev it supersedes the previous astrophysical limit based on the helium - burning lifetime of hb stars , as shown in figure  [ exclusion ] .",
    "our sensitivity does not yet touch the band of @xmath18@xmath26 values expected for qcd axion models and thus applies to somewhat lighter axion - like particles .",
    "our limits can be relevant , for example , in comparison with the anomalous signature , far in excess of the qed expectation of vacuum birefringence , that has been reported by the pvlas experiment  @xcite .",
    "an interpretation of this signal in terms of axion - like particles requires a coupling strength of about @xmath178@xmath179 for @xmath180  ev .",
    "however , this coupling is so large that the solar axion production would lead to the sun burning out within about a 1000  years . therefore , if the particle interpretation of pvlas is correct , something about the underlying physics must be very different than assumed here  @xcite . without a specific underlying theoretical model it is impossible to compare pvlas and cast in generic terms",
    " the discrepancy is simply too large .    in order to extend our search to qcd axions ,",
    "our setup has already been upgraded and the data collection has started in late 2005 .",
    "the cast experiment , being operated in a scanning mode in which the he gas pressure is varied in appropriate steps , will allow us to explore the range of possible axion masses up to about 1  ev .",
    "for the first time an experiment providing a sensitivity to @xmath18 of the order of that derived from hb stars will be able to enter into the region , shown in figure  [ exclusion ] , which is favored by axion models . in this mass range axions",
    "would provide a hot - dark matter component of the universe , similar to neutrinos  @xcite .",
    "another interesting feature is that in this regime of operation , when the gas is inserted in the magnet pipes , cast could be also sensitive to the existence of ( two ) large extra dimensions with the compactification radius down to around 200  nm .",
