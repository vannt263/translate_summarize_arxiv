    "perhaps due to the exceptional appearance of two superconducting(sc ) transitions with two associated critical field curves , upt@xmath0  is one of the most well studied heavy fermion superconductors .",
    "the history of this subject was described in ref.@xcite .",
    "the t linear dependence of the low temperature thermal conductivity both parallel to the c axis and the a axis was in favor of the e@xmath2 rather than e@xmath3- type sc order parameter@xcite .",
    "further pt- nmr experiments confirmed the triplet nature of the superconductivity and the details of the triplet gap function * d  * ( * k ) n a , b , and c- phases were determined@xcite .",
    "this assignment of the spin configuration is consistent with the weak spin - orbit coupling limit@xcite also assumed here .",
    "h@xmath4 along the c axis requires a strong pauli limiting effect@xcite .",
    "this favors strong spin orbit coupling but then h@xmath4 results are inconsistent with the nmr data .",
    "we assume that * d  * ( * k)=@xmath5 to be weakly pinned along c. then the e@xmath2 gap functions of for the low temperature b and c phases of upt@xmath0  are given by * *    @xmath6    here @xmath7 are the polar and azimuthal angles of * k  * .",

    "[ gapfun ] . in the b- phase",
    "the poles are second order node points and the equator is a node line . in the c- phase",
    "two additional vertical nodal lines appear at 45 degrees away from the vertical plane containing * h  * .",
    "the thermal conductivity in the vortex phase for field along the symmetry axis also decided in favor of the e@xmath2 state and against the e@xmath3- state@xcite , this is reviewed in @xcite .",
    "the angular dependent thermal conductivity has been measured in @xcite and analyzed in @xcite .",
    "unfortunately the experiment was done for t@xmath90.3 k which is not sufficiently low to determine node structures .",
    "recently we have been studying the thermal conductivity in nodal superconductors@xcite .",
    "in particular we shall restrict to the low temperature limit t@xmath10 and the superclean limit @xmath11 , where @xmath12 , @xmath13 is the scattering rate and @xmath14 are the anisotropic fermi velocities .",
    "the condition @xmath15 can be satisfied in the b- phase while @xmath16 in the c- phase since the latter appears only for h@xmath17 0.6 t and h@xmath17 1.2 t for field along a and c respectively .",
    "our results in the c- phase may therefore only have qualitative significance .",
    "restriction to the superclean limit does not influence the main conclusions on the connection between node topology and magnetothermal conductivity .",
    "we first examine the quasiparticle dos and the thermodynamic properties of the b and c phase of upt@xmath0  in the presence of a magnetic field with arbitrary orientation at low temperatures .",
    "then we study the thermal conductivity in the b and c phase in the low temperature regime which provides clear evidence for the nodal positions in @xmath18 . in this regime the influence of the af order in upt@xmath0  may be neglected contrary to the a- phase regime .",
    "the quasiparticle dos in the vortex state of upt@xmath0  is given by    @xmath19    where the brackets denote both fermi surface and vortex lattice average . with the form factor f@xmath20(z)=@xmath21 and f@xmath22(z , z)=(2z@xmath23 - 1)f@xmath20(z ) ( z=@xmath24 , z=@xmath25 ) for b and c- phase respectively the average may be computed and one obtains    @xmath26{\\rangle}\\bigr)\\nonumber\\\\ g_c(0)&=&\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3 } } \\bigl(\\frac{\\pi}{2}{\\langle}x\\ln\\bigl(\\frac{2}{x}\\bigr){\\rangle}+ \\frac{2}{\\pi}c_0{\\langle}\\ln^2(\\frac{2}{x}){\\rangle}\\bigr)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where x=@xmath27 is the normalized doppler shift of quasiparticle energies , c@xmath28 and @xmath29 is the renormalized quasiparticle energy in the presence of impurity scattering@xcite .",

    "both angular dependences are shown in fig .",
    "[ ctheta ] and fig .",
    "[ cphi ] respectively .    in both b and c phase @xmath46 ( ij= xx , zz ) and also the specific heat which is determined by i@xmath61 exhibit clear cusps at the poles @xmath34=0 ( and @xmath62 ) caused by the contributions from the respective second order node points which are present in both b and c phase .",
    "this is very similar to what has been recently observed and analyzed in yni@xmath63b@xmath63c@xcite .",
    "there the second order node points lie along the equator and hence the cusps appear as function of @xmath42 .",
    "the most significant difference in the b- and c- phase results can be seen in the behaviour of @xmath47 for small polar angle @xmath34 . while in the b- phase it approaches zero",
    "it remains finite in the c- phase .",
    "furthermore the @xmath64 anisotropy for @xmath48 is considerably smaller in the c- phase as compared to the b - phase . in both b- and c- phase the xx- component exhibts nonmonotonic behaviour as function of @xmath34 .",
    "the thermal hall coefficient in the c- phase reads    @xmath65    where f@xmath66 holds because the contributions from perpendicular node lines with * h  * lying at half angle in between cancel and so as in the b- phase one is left with polar and equatorial contributions to the thermal hall constant . for numerical calculations we used the anisotropy ratio @xmath67 = 1.643 .",
    "it can be directly obtained from experimental anisotropies of thermal and electrical conductivities@xcite @xmath68= @xmath68=2.7 which are equal to @xmath69 .",
    "we have found that in upt@xmath0  at low temperatures ( i.e. t@xmath70 ) and in the superclean limit ( @xmath11 ) , the thermal conductivity exhibits clear angular dependence which will help to identify the nodal directions in @xmath18and to verify the predictions of the commonly discussed e@xmath2 model for the gap function in b and c phases .",
    "most significantly we predict that i ) cusps appear in the thermal conductivity and specific heat for @xmath34=0 ( and @xmath62 ) due to the polar point nodes of upt@xmath0  in both b- and c- phase .",
    "ii ) in the c- phase for heat current along the nodal direction ( @xmath71 ) a finite @xmath72 occurs even for @xmath730 which is caused by the contribution from the additional perpendicular node regions . for the b- phase this contribution vanishes .",
    "iii ) the @xmath64 anistropy for * h  * in the ab- plane ( @xmath74 ) is considerably larger in the b- phase as compared to c- phase .",
    "this is again caused by the perpendicular node lines which contribute and enhance @xmath60 only for the c- phase .",
    "we hope that these different features in the field- angle dependent thermal conductivity tensor above and below the critical field of the b - c transition will resolve a part of the remaining controversy surrounding @xmath18 in upt@xmath0  .",
    "we recall that thermal conductivity experiments have been very useful to identify @xmath18 in unconventional superconductors .",
    "for example izawa et al have succeded to identify @xmath18 in sr@xmath63ruo@xmath75@xcite , cecoin@xmath76@xcite , organic salts@xcite and more recently yni@xmath63b@xmath63c@xcite .",
    "indeed the thermal conductivity appears to provide a unique window to access the nodal structure in unconventional superconductors ."
