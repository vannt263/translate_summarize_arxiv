    "over the years , local nuclear optical potentials have been used predominantly as the interaction potentials between colliding nuclei . frequently , those local interactions were specified phenomenologically as woods - saxon ( ws ) optical potentials ; the parameter values of which were determined by variation to find best fits to nuclear elastic scattering data .",
    "the geometries of those ws forms often were taken commensurate with known attributes of nuclear densities and/or to be consistent with the character of hartree fields for the nuclei .",
    "most importantly in many cases , quality fits to scattering data were obtained using these local potential forms , with parameter values that varied smoothly with energy and mass . in reality",
    "however , as the optical potentials can be specified in many nucleon scattering theory as a folding of pairwise nucleon - nucleon @xmath1 interactions with nuclear structure , they must be non - local .",
    "that is assured by the pauli principle which implies that the scattering theory involves nucleon exchange amplitudes .    for nucleon - nucleus ( @xmath2 ) elastic scattering",
    ", it is now possible to define non - local optical potentials in coordinate space and to use them without recourse to localization techniques  @xcite .",
    "solutions of the attendant integro - differential forms of the schrdinger equations with those non - local @xmath2 potentials have given good to excellent fits to cross - section and analyzing power data for a wide range of target masses and for energies 40 to 800 mev  @xcite .",
    "those non - local @xmath2 potentials are formed by folding effective , medium dependent , two - nucleon ( @xmath1 ) interactions with the one body density matrices ( obdme ) of the target nucleus .",
    "very good results for light mass nuclei in particular have been obtained when those obdme were specified from shell model ( or similar ) calculations involving very large and complete shell spaces .    nevertheless",
    ", for a multitude of uses , such as with application of multi - step reaction theories and scattering into the continuum , it is useful to define a local form of optical potential for the @xmath3 scattering system . note also that equivalent local potentials can be used to account for the coupled channels effects in scattering  @xcite , the resulting form related to that found by localization of exchange amplitudes .",
    "there are many ways in which a local potential can be specified and considered equivalent to a non - local one .",
    "some have been reviewed recently  @xcite .",
    "herein we consider a form that is to be phase equivalent .",
    "the phase shifts provided by the @xmath4-folding ( non - local ) potentials used recently  @xcite to find very good predictions of p-@xmath0c elastic scattering , have been used as input to finding solutions of fixed energy quantum inverse scattering theory . in particular",
    "we have found the equivalent local potentials by using a modified version of the newton - sabatier inversion scheme that has been proposed by lun _",

    "this method allows extraction of both central and spin - orbit interactions from the input phase shift values .",
    "it is not the only fixed energy method that can do so .",
    "hooshyar  @xcite has used the sabatier interpolation formulae in a finite difference inversion method , and huber and leeb  @xcite have investigated an approach to this problem based upon darboux transformations .",
    "likewise an approximate scheme  @xcite has been used with some success  @xcite to analyze neutron - alpha particle scattering data in particular . however , the scheme we adopt is most facile , reducing the process of inversion to finding solution of a system of linear - algebraic equations .",
    "fixed energy inverse scattering schemes are not the only ways to effect the transition from non - local potentials to equivalent local ones and _ vice versa_. various other approximations and analytic expressions exist  @xcite .",
    "however , all such other methods rely upon the range of the non - locality being small in comparison to the size of most nuclei .",
    "if such is also the case with regard to the de broglie wavelength of the projectile , a semi - classical wkb approximation may be valid .",
    "however , peierls and vinh - mau  @xcite note that while the localization approximations should be well met within the medium of a large nucleus , corrections could be important in the nuclear surface region and for light mass nuclei . in any circumstance that the non - locality range exceeds the characteristic length of the system , they note that the non - local potential can not be approximated by their algorithm of localization .",
    "a desirable feature of using inverse scattering theory to define equivalent local potentials is that none of these approximations are invoked .",
    "but such must be borne in mind when the reverse process , of defining a utilitarian non - local form from the energy variation of a set of local potentials , is considered . in doing that reverse process , we chose a mapping used by apagyi _",

    "while values of the real central potential in that region ( @xmath78 fm ) decrease in strength to form the shoulder shape , the longer range property increases in effect with energy .",

    "[ pots ] . at all energies",
    "the long ranged character of the central imaginary interactions ( @xmath79 fm ) is the same and the component rapidly vanishes with large @xmath80 , contrasting markedly with the properties of the associated central real terms .",

    "the real and imaginary components of the spin - orbit potentials found by inversion are shown in segments ( c ) and ( d ) of fig .",

    "possible adjustments to the basic @xmath1 effective interactions in the original non - local potential generation could vary what we are to use as input phase shifts sufficiently to alter the small magnitude details of the spin - orbit components shown here .",
    "two potentials may be considered equivalent if they give the same scattering phase shifts . in principle",
    "the inversion potentials will be so .",
    "nevertheless , the inversion potentials must be used to get ` inversion ' phase shifts for comparison against the original values to check that they are indeed equivalent . in fig .",

    "the real and imaginary parts of the phase shifts values are shown in the left and right panels respectively while those for @xmath83 and for @xmath84 are given in the top and bottom sections respectively .",
    "the input phase shift values are depicted by the filled circles while the results found from the inversion potentials are indicated by the connecting lines .",
    "the notation with energy is that used in fig .",
    "clearly there is excellent agreement between the phase shifts found from the local , inversion potentials and from the @xmath4-folding non - local ones .",
    "there is a relatively smooth and consistent change in the phase shift values as the energy increases .",
    "the real parts of the sets corresponding to @xmath83 and @xmath84 both show a steady decrease in value with energy for small partial waves , while the associated imaginary parts show a steady increase .",
    "the notable exception is the 65 mev case for which the imaginary parts differ from this pattern . in the case of the imaginary parts of the @xmath83 phase shifts",
    "there is an unusual structure in the 65 mev data set for the values @xmath85 .    a closer inspection of the results revealed that the s - wave phase shifts are slightly different from the original input values in both the 65 mev and the 100 mev cases .",
    "this variation , however , is less than four percent .",
    "the fact that the phase shifts corresponding to @xmath86 differ is not unusual since the centrifugal barrier screens all other partial wave solutions from any ( small ) effect of the pole terms inherent in the inversion potentials .",
    "although the excellent agreement between phase shift sets obtained from the local ( inversion ) and from original non - local ( full folding optical ) potentials for the p-@xmath87c scattering at diverse energies is convincing , another way to demonstrate this equivalence is to compare the associated observables . by so doing any small variation in phase shifts that may exist",
    "can be emphasized .",
    "this is so as the cross section spans several orders of magnitude and then small inaccuracies within the phase shifts could be very apparent at the larger scattering angles particularly .",
    "the analyzing power likewise should be sensitive to small differences in the phase shift values since that observable is given by differences between scattering probabilities and is normalized by the differential cross - section values .",

    "filled and open , have been used to display the ` data ' to differentiate the set for each energy .",
    "these cross section results demonstrate that the inversion potentials are very good local equivalents .",
    "the cross section reproductions span eight orders of magnitude and only for magnitudes less than @xmath88mb / sr are small divergences evident .",
    "such divergence is most evident with the 200 mev and 250 mev cases since those cross sections decrease most rapidly .",
    "an even finer test of the agreement based upon observables between the local and non - local potentials are the results for the analyzing powers . as shown in the bottom section of fig .",
    "[ xsecana ] , reproduction of the analyzing power for each energy is very good out to a center of mass scattering angle of @xmath89 .",
    "even then only the cases of 65 and 100 mev have any noticeable divergence between the local and non - local potentials results .",
    "it is surmised that the small variations in the values of low-@xmath31 phase shifts are the cause as such variations little effect predictions for the cross sections .",

    "the variations in these results are but a few mev in size . however there is a noticeable change in the degree of structure with marked oscillations in the results found with the smaller ( 0.7 ) non - locality range .",
    "still the results with both non - locality range values do exhibit a residual energy dependence , and such is presumed not to be the case with the frahn - lemmer prescription .",
    "the modulating functions , @xmath132 , of the actual non - local term in the frahn - lemmer form are displayed in fig  [ fwithe ] .",
    "the real parts of this function are quite similar in the 135 - 160 and 160 - 200 cases although the overall strength of the real part of @xmath132 decreases with the energy as it does with increase in the non - locality range .",
    "the 100 - 135 results ( for the real part of @xmath132 ) are larger than the others and varies from those in structure .",
    "the imaginary parts of @xmath132 vary noticeably with the marked structure of the 100 - 135 results diminishing with energy .",
    "but the size change is not linear .",
    "such energy dependence is also at odds with the frahn - lemmer requirement of an energy independent non - local potential .",

    "the disparity between the 100 - 135 and 160 - 200 results emphasizes again that there is a residual energy dependence one must consider if the set of fixed energy inversion potentials are recast as a frahn - lemmer type of non - local interaction .",

    "@xcite has been used to specify local potentials from sets of phase shifts given by solutions of the schrdinger equations with non - local optical potentials for proton-@xmath0c elastic scattering for a range of proton energies .",
    "those ( non - local potential ) phase shift sets give very good fits to observed cross - section and analyzing power data  @xcite .",
    "so also then do the local ( inversion ) potentials as we have shown them to be both phase shift and observable equivalent ( to the non - local potential expectations ) to a high degree . as a non - local to local potential conversion scheme ,",
    "the inverse scattering theory method has proved to be very effective .",
    "irrespective of the pole term inherent in the inverse scattering theory method , the local inversion potentials do not resemble the simple functional forms , e.g. woods - saxon potentials , that are commonly used in phenomenological ( numerical inversion ) analyses of such scattering data .",
    "we then considered a reverse mapping to see if and how the energy dependence of the inversion potentials might reflect a non - locality of simpler functional kind , and of the frahn - lemmer form in particular .",
    "the results are indicative of a characteristic forms for the diverse components of that simple non - local form of the interaction , but the detailed properties can vary significantly with the choice of the non - locality range , and there is an energy dependence residual in the frahn - lemmer functions .",
    "thus we contend that the energy dependence of local potentials for p-@xmath0c scattering ( and by implication for other targets ) whether those potentials are found by inversion or by phenomenology , is not solely a reflection of the true non - locality in the interaction between the nuclei .",
