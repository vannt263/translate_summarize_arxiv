    "solar energetic particles ( sep ) , which are accelerated in association with solar eruptive events , pose a hazard for equipment and astronauts on spacecraft , and even for crew members and passengers on aircraft in high - latitude flights because of secondary particles produced in the earth s atmosphere .",
    "seps mainly consist of protons , alpha particles , and heavier ions .",
    "their energies reach hundreds of mev and sometimes up to several gev .",
    "the highest - energy extremity of seps occasionally produces considerable fluxes of secondary neutrons observed as ground - level enhancements ( gle ) of cosmic - ray intensity .",
    "seventy - two gles have been registered since 1942 until the present time mainly with high - latitude neutron monitors ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite and references therein ) . on average",
    ", gles occur once a year , but very irregularly .",
    "gles avoid solar minima , while four gles occurred within one week in may 1990 .",
    "the rareness of gles hampers understanding their origins and emphasizes the importance of studying each solar event responsible for a gle",
    ".    one presumable source of seps and gles is traditionally associated with flare processes in coronal magnetic fields of active regions exhibited in x - ray and microwave emissions .",
    "another probable source of seps is related to bow shocks driven by fast coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) . in spite of a high practical importance of sep events",
    ", consensus has not been reached so far about the probable contributions from the two sources in different events and energy ranges .",
    "the main subject of the debates is related to the origins of high - energy seps and especially gles ( see , _ e.g. _ , @xcite for a review and references ) .",
    "each competing concept is supported by convincing arguments @xcite .    a traditional view on the sep origins",
    "is mainly based on the hypotheses proposed in the past decades , when observational opportunities were strongly limited relative to the modern ones .",
    "traditional concepts considered the processes responsible for acceleration of particles in flares and those by shock waves to be remote and completely independent of each other .",
    "observational studies of two last decades update the view on solar eruptive phenomena step by step and establish their close association with each other .",
    "@xcite and @xcite found synchronization between the cme acceleration pulse and hard x - ray ( hxr ) and microwave bursts .",
    "@xcite established that the helical component of the cme s flux rope ( responsible for its acceleration ) is formed by reconnection , which caused a flare .",
    "@xcite found a quantitative correspondence between the reconnected magnetic flux and the rate of flare energy release .",
    "@xcite established that waves were impulsively excited by erupting flux ropes inside developing cmes during the rise phase of hxr and microwave bursts and rapidly steepened into the shocks because of a rapid falloff of the fast - mode speed .",
    "then the shock wave quasi - freely propagates for some time like a decelerating blast wave and changes to the bow - shock regime later , if the trailing cme is fast .",
    "these results and outlined scenario show that the traditional contrasting of the acceleration in a flare and by a shock might be exaggerated .",
    "two consequences are important for the sep acceleration issue .",
    "first , shock waves appear much earlier than previously assumed and can accelerate heavy particles even during the flare .",
    "second , a close association is expected between the parameters of the cme , shock wave , and flare , on the one hand , and those of a sep event .",
    "these circumstances indicate that both flare - related and shock - related acceleration can be significant in sep production , while their roles might depend on particular conditions in different events .",
    "recent studies by @xcite confirmed this idea and indicated statistically increasing importance of the flare - related particle acceleration at higher energies .",
    "the shock - related contribution was also manifest .",
    "in article  i @xcite and article  ii @xcite we started analyzing the 26 december 2001 event related to an m7.1 flare with a peak time at 05:40 ( all times hereafter refer to utc if not specified otherwise ) responsible for gle63 . among all gle - related flares of solar cycle 23 ,",
    "this flare had a lowest goes importance and longest duration , being associated with a moderate microwave burst .",
    "limited observations of the flare and eruption determined incomplete knowledge of this solar event .",
    "no soft x - ray ( sxr ) images or hxr data are available .",
    "observations with the _ extreme - ultraviolet imaging telescope _ ( eit : @xcite ) , onboard the _ solar and heliospheric observatory _ ( soho ) , had a gap from 04:47 to 05:22 .    some aspects of this event",
    "look challenging . if protons and heavier ions were accelerated in the flare concurrently with electrons , then it is not clear why the sep fluxes were so large .",
    "if they were shock - accelerated , then it is not clear why the fast cme and strong shock developed in association with a moderate flare .",
    "it is also not clear when and where the shock wave appeared and how it evolved .",
    "articles  i and ii analyzed the event from microwave imaging observations with the _ siberian solar radio telescope _ ( ssrt : @xcite ) at 5.7ghz ; the _ nobeyama radioheliograph _ ( norh ; @xcite ) at 17 and 34 ghz and total flux data of _ nobeyama radio polarimeters _",

    "implication of a hypothetical concurrent far - side event is unlikely .",
    "the flare was much longer than other gle - related flares and consisted of two parts , each of which was most likely caused by a separate eruption .",
    "the first eruption presumably occurred in ar9742 around 04:40 and produced ejecta , which was not observed .",
    "a related moderate two - ribbon flare involved medium magnetic fields and reached a goes importance of m1.6 .",
    "the second eruption occurred in ar9742 around 05:04 and produced a fast cme .",

    "5 .   an extra sharp jet - like eruption around 05:09 could produce a shock wave .",
    "based on these results , in this article we analyze the eruptions in this event from indirect observations .",
    "we endeavor to reconstruct the cme and shock wave , their evolution , and to find which circumstances could amplify the sep outcome of this event . pursuing the last issue , we compare the 26 december 2001 event with other sep and gle events . invoking the recent observational conclusions about scenarios of the cme and shock - wave development listed in this section , we revisit this historical gle - related event on the basis of the modern view .",

    "the time - profiles of the proton fluxes are typical of well - connected events , with a sharp rise roughly corresponding to the flare peak followed by a moderately long decay .",
    "hepad detected a highest - energy @xmath3mev enhancement , which is usual in gle events .",
    "each integral channel is dominated by protons in its lowest - energy part because of their declining spectrum .",
    "the time profiles reflect the energy spectrum of protons , while the path lengths for different energies might not be identical . the increasing duration of the lower - energy proton fluxes is mainly caused by their transport in the interplanetary space , primarily the velocity dispersion .",
    "contributions from two different accelerators are not excluded , one of which operated longer , dominating at lower energies , and another of a shorter duration dominated at higher energies .",
    "from an analysis of 35 gles ( without gle63 ) @xcite found the presence of a prompt component with an exponential flux spectrum and a slow power - law component with an average @xmath4 .",
    "the authors considered this fact incompatible with exclusive acceleration of protons by shock waves , expecting a power - law flux spectrum with @xmath5 in this case .",
    "@xcite presented the energy spectra of proton fluences and other sep properties during the 16 gles of solar cycle 23 .",
    "the spectra in a range of @xmath6mev are best fit with double power - laws . on average ,",
    "the spectra above @xmath7mev in gle events have a slope of @xmath8 with @xmath9 , significantly harder than in typical large sep events ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 ) .",
    "the spectral slopes below the break - energies are similar , being about @xmath12 on average .",
    "the spectrum of the proton fluence in our event had a slope of @xmath13 below 32mev and @xmath14 at higher energies , close to the average values for other gles .",
    "the double power - law spectrum seems to favor the domination of shock - acceleration at lower energies and flare - acceleration at higher energies advocated by @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", a double - power - law can result from a single power - law spectrum affected by proton - amplified alfvn waves near the sun ( see @xcite for a review ) or from the acceleration by a quasi - perpendicular shock @xcite .",
    "to summarize , the properties of the 26 december 2001 proton enhancement were typical of well - connected gle events .",
    "there are indications of the contributions from both flare - related and shock - related sources .",
    "however , they can also be interpreted in terms of a single shock - wave accelerator , being therefore inconclusive .",
    "the sep events have traditionally been categorized as gradual or impulsive events ( mixed events are also considered ) .",
    "gradual sep events are characterized as long - duration , large , intense events .",
    "they have average ion abundances similar to those of the corona or solar wind .",
    "in contrast , impulsive sep events are small , have relatively short durations , can have 1000-fold enhancements in @xmath15he/@xmath16he and in heavy elements ( @xmath17)/o relative to the corona or solar wind , and are associated with solar flares or jets and type iii radio bursts @xcite .",
    "the 26 december 2001 event had a long duration and low @xmath15he/@xmath16he ratio like gradual events @xcite and exhibited some properties of impulsive events .",
    "@xcite examined the fe / o ratio , which is considered as diagnostics of flare material .",
    "the fe / o ratio typical of impulsive seps is about unity , while that of gradual seps is around 0.1 .",
    "a criterion for fe - rich gle events is fe / o  @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "the authors of both studies noted that the fe - rich gles , on average , have much smaller @xmath19mev proton fluences than the fe - poor gles . in our event , the fe / o ratio in the range 45 to 80 mev / nucleon was 0.671 , and the @xmath19mev proton fluence was @xmath20protons@xmath21 , while the latter parameter for the 16 gles was in the range @xmath22protons@xmath21 with a logarithmic average of @xmath23protons@xmath21 .    at the rise phase of some gradual events fe",
    "/ o is @xmath24 and diminishes afterwards , suggesting a flare - related prompt component and shock - related slow component .",
    "the 26 december 2001 sep event also showed this behavior . on the other hand , @xcite argued the initial fe / o enhancement in this event to be a transport effect , advocating the only shock - related accelerator .",
    "we note , however , that if really so , then the mentioned pattern established by @xcite and @xcite between the event - integrated values of the fe / o ratio and the @xmath19mev proton fluence did not hold in this event .",
    "thus , invoking the fe / o ratio still has not determined the source of seps on 26 december 2001 .",
    "a promising characteristic of the equilibrium temperature in the acceleration region is the mean ionic charge state of iron , @xmath25 . in 10 out of the 16 gles ,",
    "in which it was measured , @xmath25 ranged from 11.7 to 22.1 . in our event",
    ", @xmath26 corresponds to about 10mk , which seems to indicate flare material .",
    "@xcite point out that the highly - ionized @xmath27mev / nucleon ions in this event and some others could also be the result of electron stripping during the acceleration and/or transport process in a sufficiently dense ambient plasma .",
    "the authors concerned with this effect consider that , in terms of the traditional concept ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) , a cme - driven bow - shock can appear and start accelerating ions between @xmath28 and @xmath29 mm above the photosphere .",
    "however , recent results listed in section  [ s - introduction ] show that shock - acceleration can occur in still lower corona , and it looks surprising for us in this case why electron stripping is not common , so that high @xmath30 are not always observed .",
    "thus , the studies of low to moderate energy protons and heavier ions reveal indications of both shock - related and flare - related contributions in the 26 december 2001 event",
    ". however , the latter are not certain and can be interpreted in different ways .",

    "tiger was launched on 21 december 2001 and flew for about 32 days on a long - duration balloon mission from mcmurdo base in antarctica .",
    "being designed mainly to measure the elemental abundances of galactic cosmic ray nuclei , tiger observed the 26 december 2001 gle event in the @xmath34gev / nucleon range .",

    "figure  [ f - high - energy]d shows the ratios of heavy elements that reached the c0 tiger cherenkov detector .",
    "an interesting point here is that the estimated lower - energy limit of particles that can trigger the c0 detector is around 2.5 gev / nucleon . during the event , the efficiency of the tiger track - reconstruction software dropped from @xmath36 to under @xmath37 , resulting in an additional dead time , that might affect the measured ratio @xcite . still figure  [ f - high - energy]d shows more iron and presents unique evidence that heavy ions could be accelerated to such high energies during this event .",
    "acceleration of protons and heavier ions in the 26 december 2001 event up to relativistic energies is certain , but their sources still remain unclear . an additional indication can be found from statistical relations between the parameters of seps , on the one hand , and those of flares and cmes , on the other hand .      a correlation between near - earth proton enhancements and microwave bursts has been known for a long time @xcite .",

    "no proxy of any shock parameters was available .",
    "@xcite found that the peak proton fluxes correlated with microwaves not more than with the thermal sxr flare emission . assuming that protons accelerated either by flares or by shocks and not by both , he favored shock - acceleration .",
    "this conclusion caused a sceptical relation to the correlations between the parameters of seps and microwave bursts .",
    "studies by @xcite call for rethinking the role of the bfs .",
    "they analyzed the relations between the parameters of strong microwave bursts @xmath38sfu ( 1sfu = @xmath39wm@xmath40hz@xmath0 ) at 35ghz observed by norp in 19912012 and near - earth proton enhancements @xmath41mev , both from detailed time histories .",
    "gyrosynchrotron emission of high - energy electrons depends on their parameters , magnetic field in the source , and its dimensions .",
    "these dependencies are different at frequencies below the turnover frequency of the gyrosynchrotron spectrum and above it .",
    "the turnover frequency also depends on the parameters listed .",
    "single - frequency data are therefore ambiguous , being below the turnover frequency in one event and above it in another . to minimize this ambiguity , the highest frequency of 35ghz",
    "was chosen , at which stable regular observations are available .",
    "in addition to the proton events related to strong microwave bursts , some big seps might have occurred after weaker bursts . a few additional proton enhancements @xmath41mev with peak fluxes @xmath42pfu ( 1pfu = 1particle@xmath21s@xmath0sr@xmath0 ) were found , whose solar source events occurred within the observational daytime in nobeyama .    out of the total set of events ,",
    "28 proton enhancements in 19962012 were selected , whose sources were not occulted and data on the corresponding cmes are listed in the online cme catalog ( cdaw.gsfc.nasa.gov/cme_list/ : @xcite ) based on the observations by the soho s _ large angle and spectroscopic coronagraph _ ( lasco : @xcite ) . because the speeds listed in the cme catalog are measured for a fastest feature , @xmath43 for fast cmes are most likely related to shock waves @xcite .",

    "the correlation coefficient for the whole set of events is higher with the cme speed in figure  [ f - correlations]d than with the microwave fluence in figure  [ f - correlations]c , supporting a shock - related contribution .",
    "an apparent interpretation of figure  [ f - correlations]c is that the first - group well - correlated seps were dominated by the flare - related acceleration , because the total number of protons depends on both the intensity and duration of the acceleration process .",
    "the correspondence between these parameters of the acceleration process and microwave burst is obvious , but not expected , if protons are accelerated by shock waves far away from a flare region .",
    "the shock - related acceleration seems to dominate in the second - group proton - abundant events . nevertheless , their location closer to the main cloud of points in figure  [ f - correlations]c relative to figure  [ f - correlations]a supports the flare - related contribution in these events , too .",
    "the asymmetry of flare magnetic configurations causes an additional scatter in the correlations between microwave bursts and seps .",
    "this asymmetry in the 26 december 2001 event reduced the microwave burst by a factor of two with the same production of accelerated particles ( article  ii ) .",

    "gle63 seems to have significant contributions from both flare - related and shock - related accelerations .",
    "the high correlation for the first - group events within the ellipse in figure  [ f - correlations]c holds over three orders of magnitude for the microwave fluence and five orders for the proton fluence , while @xmath43 in figure  [ f - correlations]d range within one order of magnitude . a general pattern expressed by @xcite in terms of the bfs appears to be more complex than the correlation between everything in big flares . a general correspondence between the parameters of flares , cmes , shock waves , and seps holds over a wide range of their magnitudes .",

    "it is a long - standing issue if type ii emissions observed in the decametric / hectometric ( dh ) range and at still longer waves , also termed interplanetary ( ip ) type ii events , can be extensions of metric type ii bursts .",

    "although the type ii bands are not continuous and their identification is not guaranteed , the calculated trajectories correctly reproduce the actual evolution of the frequency drift throughout the event in the whole frequency range without any frequency mismatch between the metric and ip type ii emission .",
    "the impression about the mismatch was probably caused by a complex structure of the radio emission with gaps between the type ii portions observed and presence of misleading features , which might be irrelevant to the main trajectories .",
    "figure  [ f - type_ii_cane ] also leads to the following conclusions .",
    "i )  the type  ii emission in the whole range where it was observed , from about 80mhz to about 150khz , was due to the same shock wave , which was excited by the eruption in ar9742 during the flare .",
    "ii )  the type ii bands and blobs in the 0.55mhz range between 06:30 and 10:00 corresponding to different dotted and dashed trajectories certify the presence of two different sources of the type  ii emission .",
    "this fact rules out a popular idea relating the type  ii source to the bow - shock ahead of the cme nose .",
    "at least , one of the radio sources must be located at a flank of the shock wave , because two bow - shocks can not be driven by a single piston .",
    "most likely , two lateral blast - wave - like shocks coexisted , at least , until 09:00 , while ahead of the cme they merged into a single stronger shock @xcite .      a slowly - drifting burst visible in figure  [ f - dynamic_spectrum]b from 04:50 until 05:13 outlined from below by the dashed green line resembles a type ii burst .",
    "so it was reported by some observatories and considered by @xcite . however , the convexity of its trajectory with an increasing drift rate is opposite to those of type  ii-1 and type  ii-2 .",
    "the structure of this burst is better visible in figure  [ f - type_iv ] , which presents an adapted hiras spectrogram ( ) accessible at sunbase.nict.go.jp / solar / denpa / hirasdb / events/2001/.    b ) outlines the low - frequency envelope of type  iv-1 according to the height  time plot in figure  [ f - rope_plots]a . ]    at a first glance , the burst comprised a pair of bands with a frequency ratio of 1.8 ( the bright red feature visible from 05:12 to 05:16 between 40 and 80mhz is due to type  iis ) .",
    "its spectrum is cut off towards lower frequencies , as expected for a population of confined electrons .",
    "the high - frequency cutoff has a less pronounced drift , if any , so that the bandwidth of this burst increases , which does not resemble a type  ii burst .",
    "this burst , type  iv-1 , suggests emission from an electron population confined in an expanding magnetic structure .    the second broadband burst in figure  [ f - type_iv ] , type  iv-2 , started since about 05:05 in association with the main eruption .",
    "its quasi - stationary high - frequency part probably related to the flare arcade extended up to @xmath106mhz and lasted until 05:27 .",
    "the hiras spectrogram suggests a drift of its low - frequency part to lower frequencies ( invisible in figure  [ f - dynamic_spectrum]b ) .",
    "a slowly - drifting burst type  iv-3 superposed on a type  iii group appears in figure  [ f - dynamic_spectrum]b much later , probably due to emission from the structures well behind the cme leading edge .",
    "analysis of type  iv-2 and type  iv-3 is hampered by their poor appearance and overlap with different structures .",
    "we focus on type  iv-1 .",
    "this slowly - drifting burst evidences a moving source .",
    "the moving radio source is really often observed along the extrapolated trajectory of an erupting prominence ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite ) . by relating a drifting type  iv burst to the observed expansion of an sxr source , @xcite reconstructed its kinematics in a time interval exceeding imaging observations .",
    "it is not possible to use here either the density model or kinematics estimated from the analysis of type  ii bursts , unlike the bow - shock regime , when kinematics of the piston and shock is similar .",
    "the low - cutoff frequency of a type  iv burst is controlled by plasma in an expanding dense structure , while the frequency of a type  ii burst is governed by its environment .",
    "the structure responsible for a type  iv burst accelerates starting from a small velocity ; a shock wave responsible for a type  ii burst starts from the fast - mode speed ( @xmath107kms@xmath0 above an active region ) and then decelerates .",
    "most likely , the first eruption responsible for type  iv-1 has not produced a shock wave .",

    "an additional indication is an expected similarity of the velocity  time plot of an eruption to the sxr flux @xcite . to relate the spatial and frequency ( density ) scales , we refer to the top of the first eruption revealed by the eit images in figure  [ f - first_eruption ] .",

    "the correspondence of the inferred kinematics to type  iv-1 , sxr flux , and to the eit images confirms its likelihood . in spite of uncertainties ,",
    "it is clear that when the second eruption started , the first erupting structure has reached a height of about 600 mm , being still not far away .",
    "it stretched closed loops ahead of the main erupting structure , cleared the path for its expansion , thus facilitating its lift - off .",
    "the _ wind_/waves spectrum in figure  [ f - dynamic_spectrum]d shows three strong type  iii bursts .",

    "type  iii-2 started around 05:27 and had a similar duration .",
    "no metric type  iii bursts are detectable before type  iii-2 .",
    "conversely , type  iii-3 corresponds to a clear group of metric type iiis in an interval of 05:4006:00 , when minor microwave bursts are visible at 17ghz in figure  [ f - dynamic_spectrum]a .",
    "the sources of these bursts were also located in ar9742 ( article  i ) .    while acceleration of electrons in the flare region is evidenced by the flare emissions in the whole interval of figure  [ f - dynamic_spectrum]a , the absence of metric type  iiis until type  iii-3 indicates isolation of the magnetic configuration in ar9742 from the interplanetary space .",

    "the configuration opened , when type  iii-3 started .",
    "type  iii-1 with a starting frequency between 14 and 25mhz was unlikely caused by electrons escaping from the flare region .",
    "the only apparent source of non - thermal electrons is the expanding flux rope , which appeared in the first eruption and contained trapped electrons responsible for type  iv-1 .",
    "reconnection between this flux rope and an open structure like a streamer @xcite or coronal hole @xcite could create a path for electrons trapped in the flux rope to escape into the interplanetary space @xcite .",
    "besides electrons , protons and heavier ions , both pre - existing in the flux rope and injected into it in the course of flare reconnection , from thermal and suprathermal up to accelerated to high energies , were released .",
    "a rich seed population was supplied for acceleration by a trailing shock wave .",
    "the presence of the type  iiis in the whole frequency range of _",
    "wind_/waves shows that the particles released could reach the earth orbit .    the onset of type  iii-1 ( vertical dotted line in figure  [ f - rope_plots]a ) corresponds to a height of the flux - rope of @xmath112 .",
    "reconnection between the flux rope and a streamer or coronal hole could occur at a farthest edge of the flux - rope s flank , at a height of @xmath113 for a circular geometry .",
    "our power - law density model does not help here , because the density multiplier [ @xmath72 is unknown .",
    "the plasma frequency expected at this height is 30mhz in a streamer @xcite and 8.6mhz in a coronal hole @xcite _ vs. _ expected 1425mhz .",
    "either option is possible with our uncertainties .",
    "while the height  time plot of the second flux rope formed in the main eruption is unknown , a similar scenario associated with type  iii-2 is indicated by type  iv-2 related to the main flare and its probable drift to lower frequencies ; the starting frequency of type  iii-2 between 9 and 25mhz , similar to that of type  iii-1 , without metric counterparts ; and a probable opening of the magnetic configuration after type  iii-2 .",
    "the second flux rope could reconnect with the same open magnetic structure as the first one and at a comparable height .",
    "the particles accumulated in the second flux rope in the course of a stronger main flare were released after the type  iii-2 onset .",
    "this population of particles must be more energetic and plentiful . the estimated spr time ( @xcite : the gray diamond labeled spr )",
    "coincides with type  iii-2 .",
    "the first particle release during type  iii-1 does not contradict the gle onset 12 minutes earlier than the estimated spr time ( the dashed line in figure  [ f - high - energy]b ) ; thus , energetic particles accelerated in the first flare could directly contribute to the sep event .",
    "type  iii-3 indicates direct escape of electrons ( and probably other particles ) from the flare region evidenced by a group of the corresponding metric type  iiis .",
    "the peak of the microwave spectrum shifted from 6ghz ( article  ii ) to @xmath114ghz at that time , as comparison of the burst at 17ghz ( black ) and 2.7ghz ( pink ) in figure  [ f - dynamic_spectrum]a shows .",
    "this suggests displacement of the microwave - emitting region ( and , possibly , the site of flare energy release ) to weaker magnetic field at larger altitude .",
    "these late - stage processes might be related to the post - impulsive particle acceleration ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite ) .",
    "a possibility to accelerate the released particles by a shock wave is questionable .",
    "a white - light transient was observed by the lasco c2 and c3 coronagraphs starting from 05:29 up to @xmath115 .",
    "the transient consisted of a structured cme body ( probable flux rope ) surrounded by a faint partial - halo wave trace .",
    "the same lasco images in figure  [ f - lasco_img ] processed in different ways reveal cme structures ( top ) and wave traces ( bottom , running differences ) , which are detectable from a diffuse halo - like brightening or deflected coronal rays .        the sky - plane expansion of the cme body and wave was very similar .",
    "we therefore fitted the kinematics of both with the same power - law fit appropriate for a shock wave .",
    "the wave onset time , @xmath116  05:10:00 , is slightly later than that of shock  2 ( @xmath117  05:09:10 ) .",

    "the acceleration of second flux rope corresponds to a typical impulsive piston .",

    "the second flux rope was below the first one at that time .",
    "the second flux rope exceeded the first one in speed and acceleration by a factor of @xmath139 and became super - alfv ' enic before its observations by lasco .",
    "the heights reached by the first flux rope and the second one , when corresponding type  iii bursts started , are comparable , being related as 1:1.35 .",
    "the observations found for this event fit within a scenario outlined in section  [ s - introduction ] . the second flux rope formed by reconnection ( also responsible for the flare ) accelerated and produced a strong disturbance as an impulsive piston .",
    "the shock - wave excitation by the jet - like eruption was similar .",
    "the impulsive - piston scenario is well known ",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite .",
    "a crucial factor for the shock formation not considered in this review is inhomogeneous distribution of the fast - mode speed .",
    "propagating into environment of a much lower fast - mode speed , the disturbance undergoes jam of its profile and must rapidly steepen into the shock @xcite .",
    "the impulsive - piston excitation of a shock wave and its properties resemble the expectations for the hypothetical ignition of a freely propagating decelerating blast wave by the flare pressure pulse .",
    "however , the role of the impulsive piston in the observed events is played by the erupting flux rope rather than the flare loops .",
    "the flare - ignition of shock waves is neither supported by observations nor expected from general considerations for the following reasons .",
    "the plasma pressure in flare loops is controlled by its temperature and density , which determine their sxr emission .",
    "it is intrinsically gradual and usually resembles the antiderivative of the hxr or microwave burst ( the neupert effect : @xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the hxr burst is similar to the acceleration pulse of an erupting structure , as several studies concluded ( see section  [ s - introduction ] ) .",
    "thus , any erupting structure is generally an efficient impulsive piston , producing much sharper pressure pulse than the flare loops .",
    "even the situation with the plasma beta in flare loops @xmath140 is normal in a flare .",
    "the plasma pressure increase caused by chromospheric evaporation is balanced by the dynamic pressure of the reconnection outflow .",
    "all dimensions of a flare loop increase by an inconsiderable factor of @xmath141{1+\\beta}$ ] @xcite .",
    "the disturbance is too weak to ignite a shock wave .",
    "our observational studies showed that the size of sxr - emitting flare loops does not change , when a shock wave appears , and that its onset time is close to the acceleration peak of an erupting structure , which can precede the hxr peak by 12 minutes .",
    "we found that shock waves were impulsively excited by sharply erupting flux ropes in eight events , when their kinematics was measured .",
    "these events range from the goes b to x class and were or were not accompanied by non - thermal hxr and/or microwave bursts . the shock waves in these events and three others , in which their exciters were not measured , exhibited identical behaviors , initially resembling blast waves . in the events with fast cmes",
    ", shock waves showed some properties of bow shocks only after some time .",
    "the pure bow - shock excitation scenario has not been found in any of a flare - related eruption .",
    "two shock waves following each other within six minutes observed in two events rule out their bow - shock regime presumed in most studies of seps ( @xcite ; and others ) .",
    "the initial bow - shock excitation is not excluded for gradually accelerating non - flare - related cmes .",
    "the 26 december 2001 event associated with a major flare shows the same shock - wave history as the flare - related events studied previously .",
    "the first shock wave was impulsively excited by the main eruption at 05:04 .",
    "the second shock was similarly excited by the jet at 05:09 .",
    "both shock waves following each other initially resembled decelerating blast waves .",

    "[ s - cme ] concluded , the partial halo surrounding the cme body was a trace of a shock wave , whose properties in the lasco field of view were intermediate between the blast wave and bow shock .      the solid curve in figure  [ f - lasco_plots]c is a power - law fit of the measured shock - wave speed and formally corresponds to a solution of a self - similar blast wave in plasma with a power - law density _",

    "the mass of plasma involved in the motion continuously grows .",
    "the integral of the kinetic energy is conserved , as well as the integral of the sum of the plasma thermal energy and magnetic field energy within the volume behind the shock front .",
    "conservation of both energy integrals in this regime suggests an increasing impulse of the mass moving within a fixed solid angle , if the density falls off not steeper than @xmath142 ( to have an initial mass finite ) .",
    "the impulse increases because of a considerable pressure difference upstream and downstream of the shock front . the system consisting of the cme and associated shock possesses such properties .",
    "the initial impulse of the system is zero , the total mass of the moving gas grows , and the impulse increases due to magnetic driving forces responsible for the development and expansion of the cme .",
    "this situation persists up to some distance .",
    "our power - law fit applies to the position and speed of the decelerating shock front at this stage .",
    "the magnetic driving forces , which initially increased the cme impulse , weaken with an increasing distance from the sun .",
    "the outer magnetic influence on the cme and disturbed solar wind ceases .",
    "the total impulse of the system starts conserving .",
    "the cme deceleration is governed by the interaction regime of the cme with the solar wind .",
    "two extremities are possible : i )  flow around the cme without change in its mass and ii )  the ` snowplough ' regime , when the mass of the cme moving by inertia grows because of adhesion of the solar wind plasma to the cme instead of flowing around it .",
    "the change in the cme impulse in either regime is equal ( but opposite ) to that of the solar wind .",
    "the total drag force is equal to the time - derivative of this impulse and can be calculated .",
    "we do not consider the ` snowplough ' regime , which results in a much stronger deceleration than the solid curve in figure  [ f - lasco_plots]c shows .",
    "the mass increase is unlikely at large distances from the sun , where the cme expands radially .",
    "two situations of the flow around the cme are possible : i )  the solar wind flow rapidly recovers behind a compact cme and ii )  the disturbed zone behind the cme is much larger than ahead it . the drag force is absent in the idealized first situation , being largest in the second .",
    "if the difference between the velocities of the cme leading edge and solar wind @xmath143 exceeds the fast - mode speed ahead the cme ( as was the case in our event ) , then bow shock exists ahead it with a speed practically equal to @xmath43 .    a model of the stationary solar wind",

    "the cme expansion at this stage has a character of a flow and bow shock is absent .",
    "after that , bow shock can appear even during the early cme expansion , but its role is insignificant , as long as the driving forces surpass the drag force . only after the driving forces diminish relative to the drag force ,",
    "the latter dominates the cme kinematics .",

    "this factor missed in many studies determined strong deceleration of the wave at this stage , different from the bow - shock regime , which becomes possible at distances @xmath199 . *",
    "the type  ii emission in this event was traced from meters up to @xmath200khz .",
    "two shock waves coexisted at moderate distances from the sun .",
    "this rules out the bow - shock regime at this stage and indicates location of , at least , one of the radio sources at a flank of the shock .",
    "correspondence of a calculated trajectory to the overall observed evolution of the type  ii emissions in the whole frequency range demonstrates their common origin . *",
    "the shock excitation scenario described here was the only in eruptive flares we studied so far with a goes importance from b to x class .",
    "neither we observed a different overall history of the shock wave ahead of a fast cme .",
    "* shock waves appear during the flare rise , being able to accelerate particles much earlier than usually assumed .",
    "a delayed particle release time suggests instead their acceleration during the flare and accumulation in the flux - rope s magnetic trap until the access to the interplanetary space appears , which is possible in reconnection of the flux rope with an open structure .",
    "the rate of particle escape from the trap ( _ i.e. _ their flux ) can considerably exceed the rate of their injection into the trap during the flare . this transport scenario can account for the contrast between the strong proton flux and a microwave burst , which was not extreme on 26 december 2001 .",
    "* the flux - rope - mediated transport scenario is supported by the closeness of the estimated particle release to the dh type  iii bursts in most gle events of solar cycle 23 .",
    "this scenario can also supply the seed population for acceleration by a trailing shock wave . in this case , particles are most likely released at a flank of an expanding flux rope and shock wave .",
    "this results in considerably lesser heights of particle release than usually assumed .",
    "the first eruption stretched closed structures above the active region , facilitating escape of flare - accelerated particles and lift - off of the main cme .",
    "having not spent a part of its energy to overcome the magnetic tension of closed structures and to sweep up plasma ahead , the main cme could reach a higher speed and drive a stronger shock . thus , the preceding eruption could have amplified the outcome of both flare - accelerated and shock - accelerated protons .",
    "another factor was excitation of two shock waves , eventually merging in a stronger shock . both these factors can amplify solar particle events .",
