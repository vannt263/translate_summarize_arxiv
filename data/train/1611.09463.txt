    "the thermal hall conductivity is quantized in gapped @xmath0-dimensional topological phases @xcite of charged and charge - neutral excitation systems .",

    "more precisely , the thermal hall conductivity in these systems is given by @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the chiral central charge of the gapless boundary modes .",
    "hence , @xmath3 is quantized in units of @xmath4 .",
    "for example , an integer quantum hall system with the bulk chern number @xmath5 of the filled electronic energy bands has @xmath5 complex - fermionic boundary modes with @xmath6 , and a topological superconductor with the chern number @xmath5 of the bogoliubov quasiparticles has @xmath5 majorana boundary modes with @xmath7 .",
    "the quantized thermal hall effect in two - dimensional topological insulators and topological superconductors ( superfluids ) has been discussed both from bulk and boundary points of view . from the perspective of chiral gapless boundary theories , the thermal hall effect has been studied in terms of the chiral luttinger liquid @xcite , the conformal field theory @xcite , the gravitational chern - simons theory @xcite , and the equilibrium partition function @xcite . on the other hand , the thermal hall effect in the quantum hall bulk is much controversial .",
    "various studies using the kubo formula @xcite , the non - equilibrium green s function @xcite , and the steda formula @xcite have concluded that the bulk fermionic states show the quantized thermal hall effect .",
    "however , from the point of view of equilibrium thermal field theories , the thermal hall current in the bulk is exponentially small when the temperature is much smaller than the bulk energy gap @xcite .",
    "also , an induced gravitational field theory derived from a fully gapped fermionic system in a thermal equilibrium can not describe the quantized thermal hall effect @xcite .",
    "these results may imply that , while for chiral edge theories one can develop an argument for the quantized thermal hall effect , parallel to the quantum hall effect , the bulk picture of the quantized thermal hall effect may be distinct from that for the quantum hall effect .    in this paper , we extend the gauge invariance / noninvariance argument presented by laughlin @xcite to the thermal hall effect in quantum hall systems .",
    "laughlin s argument provides a fundamental and robust theory of adiabatic responses in gapped topological phases .",
    "we will make an attempt to follow as closely as possible the original laughlin s argument , by making one - to - one correspondence between electromagnetism and gravity ( or more precisely , not full einstein gravity but gravitoelectromagnetism ) .",
    "we will discuss the adiabatic responses of the chiral boundary fermion modes and the bulk quantum hall states against the gravitational counterpart of the magnetic - flux threading .    from the edge - theoretical point of view",
    ", we elucidate the role of quantum anomalies connecting the boundary theories and laughlin s argument . in particular , we will make use of the _ global _ gravitational anomaly of the boundary theories , as opposed to the _ perturbative _ gravitational anomaly . while the perturbative gravitational anomaly correctly accounts for the non - conservation of the energy - momentum of the chiral edge theories , and hence the necessity of having the bulk system , it is not entirely obvious how one could relate the non - conservation of the energy - momentum to the thermal transport . as we will discuss , the connection to the thermal transport is more transparent if we base our discussion on the global gravitational anomaly .",
    "it should however be noted that the global gravitational anomaly , i.e. , the anomalous phase of the partition function , has an ambiguity @xmath8 .",
    "one may then worry that the global gravitational anomaly may not have an ability to fix the thermal transport coefficient entirely .",
    "nevertheless , this ambiguity can be lifted by requiring consistency with the perturbative gravitational anomaly .    as for the bulk point of view , our thermal extension of laughlin s argument reveals a picture quite analogous to the quantized charge hall current that flows adiabatically through the bulk .",
    "i.e. , the creeping of landau orbitals as one threads a magnetic flux adiabatically . in particular , to explain the thermal hall effect , it seems that it is possible to avoid the use of non - equilibrium frameworks , and confine our discussion entirely within the thermal effective field theory , as in other anomaly - related transport phenomena .",

    "while at the level of the quantized charge transport , both anomalies lead to the same conclusion ( the quantized hall effect ) , the distinction between the perturbative and global anomalies is an important prerequisite for the later application . in sec .",

    "if an electron state is coherent along a closed loop in the @xmath9 direction , a magnetic flux induces a phase shift by @xmath34 that results in a shift of the momentum by @xmath35 . according to ( [ eq : position_momentum ] )",

    "such an adiabatic motion of electrons forced by threading a magnetic flux is the key property in the bulk argument .",
    "note that electrons without coherence undergo trivial changes in their phase factors without any real - space motions .",
    "when the length of the cylinder is infinite , or when two boundaries of the cylinder are connected to make a 2-torus , all coherent electrons are shifted to their neighboring positions by one magnetic flux quantum @xmath37 , and thus totally the electron state turns back to the original state .    when the electric field is applied in the @xmath10 direction , an electron localized at @xmath27 gains an energy by @xmath38 during a shift to @xmath36 .",

    "when we focus on the two boundaries , such a process is interpreted by increase and decrease of the electron numbers in the ( 1 + 1)-dimensional electronic systems .",

    "thus , using ( [ eq : qh_boundary_streda ] ) , the electronic current is given by @xmath76 the above argument can be regarded as a boundary picture of laughlin s argument on the quantum hall effect .",
    "notice that the boundary argument in this subsection can not tell whether the hall current flows in the bulk or along the boundary , since it predicts only the total electric hall current flowing perpendicular to the applied voltage @xmath77 , i.e. , we have computed the hall conductance , but not the hall conductivity .",
    "provided that the electric current is uniformly distributed in the bulk , we would conclude that the electric hall conductivity is quantized as in ( [ eq : laughlinoriginal ] ) , from ( [ eq : quantumhall_boundary ] ) ( recalling @xmath78 ) .",
    "alternatively , one can consistently make an argument based on the electric hall current flowing along the boundary @xcite .",
    "this way of describing the hall current results from a quantization of the boundary electric current @xmath79 where @xmath80 is for the right-(left-)moving chiral fermion .",
    "then the hall current is calculated solely by a summation of the boundary current on left and right boundaries as @xmath81 which is equivalent to ( [ eq : quantumhall_boundary ] )",
    ". it should be noted , however , the relation ( [ eq : quanumhall_fromboundarycurrent ] ) does not assert that the hall current is carried only by the chiral boundary modes .",
    "this is because ( [ eq : quanumhall_fromboundarycurrent ] ) considers only the difference of the electric currents on two boundaries flowing in opposite directions .",
    "an absolute value of the boundary electric current is not well - defined for the ( 1 + 1)-dimensional dirac system : it depends on the momentum cutoff @xmath82 as @xmath83 while such a high - frequency regime is not well - defied as the boundary property , and should be attributed to the bulk electronic states .",
    "therefore , the boundary argument in this section does not provide any information about the distribution of the electric hall current .",
    "another point to be mentioned is that one can also regard an adiabatic electron transfer between two edges as the electric hall current flowing in the @xmath10 direction [ fig .",

    "<S> a proper analogue of laughlin s adiabatic magnetic - flux threading process for the case of the thermal hall effect is given in terms of an external gravitational field . from the perspective of the edge theories of quantum hall systems , the quantized thermal hall effect is closely tied to the breakdown of large diffeomorphism invariance , that is , a global gravitational anomaly . in addition , we also give an argument from the bulk perspective in which a free energy , decomposed into its fourier modes , is adiabatically transferred under an adiabatic process involving external gravitational perturbations . </S>"
