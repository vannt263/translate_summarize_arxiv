    "wadsley s theorem states that a foliation by circles is a foliation by closed geodesics of some riemannian metric if and only if the circles have locally bounded length . besides its significance in its own right",
    ", wadsley s theorem is a cornerstone in the study of riemannian manifolds all of whose geodesics are closed .",
    "see @xcite for an overview of the subject .    the year following wadsley s article ( @xcite ) , sullivan gave in @xcite the first examples of compact manifolds endowed with a foliation by circles of unbounded length .",
    "sullivan s article contains also a modification of his construction by thurston .",
    "thurston s example has the additional properties of being real - analytic and explicitly given .",
    "wadsley s theorem implies that there are no riemannian metrics making sullivan s or thurston s examples geodesic .",
    "of course , there exists connections making them geodesic ( it is true for any foliation ) . but are there interesting ones ?",
    "for example , we could wonder , as epstein in @xcite , if there is a flat connection making any of them geodesic .    in this paper",
    ", we will focus on pseudo - riemannian connections .",
    "first we prove an analog of wadsley s theorem for geodesic foliations that do not contain any lightlike leaves ( see theorem [ t1.1 ] ) .",
    "hence , a geodesic foliation by circles of unbounded length has to have lightlike leaves . with the help of thurston s example ,",
    "we prove :    there exists a smooth foliation by circles of unbounded length , denoted @xmath2 , on a smooth compact pseudo - riemannian manifold @xmath3 such that the leaves of @xmath2 are geodesics of @xmath4 .",
    "the foliation @xmath2 and the metric @xmath4 can be chosen so that all the leaves of @xmath2 are lightlike or so that there exist leaves of @xmath2 of any type . moreover , in the lightlike case @xmath2 and @xmath4 can be chosen to be real - analytic .",
    "the type changing situation is perhaps the more interesting . to begin with",
    ", no example of type changing geodesic foliations by circles was known to us . moreover ,",
    "this case is related to the existence of pseudo - riemannian manifolds all of whose geodesics are closed .",
    "indeed , if @xmath3 is a pseudo - riemannian manifold , then there exists a pseudo - riemannian metric @xmath5 ( called the sasaki metric ) on its tangent bundle @xmath6 such that the orbits of the geodesic flow of @xmath3 are geodesics of @xmath5 ( see proposition [ p2.1 ] ) .",
    "if we were able to find a non - riemannian manifold @xmath3 so that all its geodesics are closed , then @xmath7 would have a type changing geodesic foliation by circles .",
    "furthermore , it is interesting to note that type changing geodesic foliations satisfy what could be called an `` anti - wadsley s theorem '' . by this",
    "we mean that a type changing geodesic foliation is never generated by an action of @xmath8 ( see proposition [ period ] ) .",
    "applying this result to geodesic flows gives :    a pseudo - riemannian manifold having a geodesic flow that can be periodically reparametrized is riemannian or anti - riemannian .",
    "hence , if there exists a ( non - riemannian ) pseudo - riemannian manifold all of whose geodesics are closed it has to be quite complicated .    in opposition",
    ", there exists a well - known family of pseudo - riemannian manifolds all of whose spacelike geodesics are closed .",
    "it is the family of pseudo - spheres @xmath9 : @xmath10 it is elementary to see that all spacelike geodesics of @xmath11 are closed . by inverting all signs",
    "these examples can be modified to yield examples of pseudo - riemannian manifolds all of whose timelike geodesics are closed .",
    "note that @xmath11 is diffeomorphic to @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the ( euclidean ) unit sphere of dimension @xmath14 .",
    "there also exists a classical family of pseudo - riemannian metrics all of whose lightlike geodesics are closed .",
    "this is the family of metrics in the conformal class of @xmath15 endowed with the metric @xmath16 ( when @xmath17 it is called the @xmath18-einstein s universe ) .",
    "our main result on this problem is the following ( compare with @xcite ) :    if @xmath3 is a lorentzian @xmath19-manifold all of whose timelike ( respectively spacelike ) geodesics are closed , then @xmath3 is finitely covered by a timelike - sc - metric ( resp .",
    "spacelike sc - metric ) on @xmath20 .",
    "it follows that every lorentzian surface contains non - closed geodesics ( theorem [ nozollsurface ] ) .",
    "finally we extend a theorem of guillemin ( see @xcite p.4 ) concerning compact surfaces , stating that , up to a finite cover , any lorentzian surface all of whose lightlike geodesics are closed is in the conformal class of the @xmath19-dimensional einstein universe .      throughout the entire text",
    "we will assume that @xmath21 is a connected smooth ( i.e. @xmath22 ) manifold .",
    "further `` smooth '' is synonymous for @xmath22 .",
    "let @xmath2 be a smooth foliation by circles of @xmath21",
    ". we can give the following generalization of wadsley s theorem as formulated in @xcite :    [ t1.1 ] the following conditions are equivalent :    * there is a smooth pseudo - riemannian metric making @xmath2 a geodesic foliation by non - degenerate geodesics of the same causal character , i.e. @xmath23 or @xmath24 for all geodesics @xmath25 parameterizing leaves of @xmath2 .",
    "* for any compact subset @xmath26 of @xmath21 , the circles meeting @xmath26 have bounded length with respect to some ( hence every ) riemannian metric . *",
    "let @xmath27 be the double cover of @xmath21 obtained by taking the two different possible local orientations of the leaves .",
    "there is a smooth action of the orthogonal group o@xmath28 on @xmath27 and the non - trivial deck transformation @xmath29 is an element of the non - trivial component of o@xmath28 .",
    "each orbit under the o@xmath28-action consists of two components and each component is mapped diffeomorphically onto a leaf of @xmath30 by the covering projection .",
    "this formulation of wadsley s theorem differs from the formulation in @xcite only in the replacement of `` riemannian '' by `` pseudo - riemannian '' in part ( 1 ) and the condition that all geodesics are nonlightlike .",
    "hence the theorem will follow directly from wadsley s theorem as formulated in @xcite and the following proposition .",
    "[ idem ] let @xmath31 be a @xmath32-foliation of a manifold @xmath21 .",
    "then the following assertion are equivalent :    * there exists a pseudo - riemannian metric @xmath4 on @xmath21 turning @xmath31 into a @xmath4-geodesic foliation by non lightlike geodesics .",

    "it follows that @xmath264 and @xmath266 delimit a fundamental domain @xmath143 for the action of @xmath269 on @xmath225 .",
    "moreover , by recalling that @xmath270 is time orientable as well as orientable and considering the angle between @xmath271 and @xmath47 , we see that @xmath224 can intersect only once @xmath264 or @xmath266 .",

    "assume that there exists a closed lorentzian @xmath19-manifold @xmath3 all of whose timelike or spacelike geodesics are closed .",
    "we will consider the case of closed spacelike geodesics only , since the other case follows by considering @xmath246 instead of @xmath3 .    by theorem [ t1.1 ] and proposition [ p2.1 ] the riemannian arclength of the spacelike geodesics",

    "extend @xmath222 to a spacelike foliation @xmath276 of @xmath262 .",
