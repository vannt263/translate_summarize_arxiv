    "in contrast , non - ergodic systems possess an extensive set of conservation laws that prevent their thermalization  @xcite .",
    "recent theoretical and experimental investigations of strongly - correlated systems , however , suggest significant refinements to this dichotomy .",
    "for instance , certain systems can be trapped for long times in quasi - stationary `` prethermalized '' states with properties strikingly different from true thermal equilibrium  @xcite .",
    "examples include nearly - integrable one - dimensional systems  @xcite , and systems with vastly different microscopic energy scales in which slow dynamics results from the slow modes providing configurational disorder and thereby localizing the fast modes  @xcite . even subtler examples of slow dynamics include the griffiths phase of interacting disordered systems  @xcite and translationally invariant systems in higher dimensions with emergent slow degrees of freedom  @xcite .",

    ", the energy density of the initial state fully determines the fate of all local observables at late times in ergodic systems .",
    "one of the main objectives of this work is to understand the route toward thermalization of these states .",
    "second , spiral states represent different mean - field solutions of the classical heisenberg model , all of which are thermodynamically unstable with the exception of @xmath11 .",
    "the fluctuation - induced destruction of the initial order and the emergence of thermodynamically stable ordered or disordered phases at longer times is another question we address here .",
    "lastly , spin spiral states have been recently realized in one and two dimensions using ultracold atoms in a quantum gas microscope  @xcite .",
    "an extension of these experiments to three dimensions makes a direct experimental scrutiny of our predictions possible .",
    "our results indicate that spiral states tuned toward fm or afm states exhibit a slow hierarchical relaxation and can come arbitrary close to a dynamical arrest , see fig.[fig : decay ] .",
    "surprisingly , the relaxation dynamics is neither compatible with the trivial relaxation to local thermal equilibrium and slow hydrodynamic evolution , since the spin current is not conserved , nor with the linearized dynamics of the collective modes , which predicts exponentially growing out - of - plane instabilities .",
    "in fact , we find the instabilities to self - regulate and slow down significantly . as we elaborate in the following sections ,",
    "the physical phenomena discussed here are expected to generalize to a broad range of models that exhibit a finite temperature phase transition between a disordered and a symmetry broken phase .",
    "the relaxation of the nel spin spiral state with @xmath12 has been previously studied in the 1d heisenberg model  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the 3d case studied in the present work , the 1d heisenberg model does not exhibit a symmetry broken thermal phase and in turn , can not exhibit the type of prethermalization we discuss here .",
    "more recently , the dynamics of the nel state in the fermi - hubbard model on an infinite dimensional bethe lattice has been investigated  @xcite , however , the approach to the steady state could not be studied due to the small effective exchange interaction .",
    "+ from a technical perspective , our investigation of the non - equilibrium dynamics of spiral states has been enabled by developing a non - perturbative field theoretic formalism applicable to generic spin-@xmath0 systems for arbitrary initial states and geometries , which we refer to as the `` spin-2pi '' formalism .",
    "this is achieved using a majorana fermion representation of spin-@xmath0 operators  @xcite , enlargement of the spin coordination number by a replica - symmetric extension , and ultimately a systematic @xmath1 fluctuation expansion of the real - time two - particle irreducible ( 2pi ) effective action  @xcite .",
    "the recent rapid progress in the phenomenology of far - from - equilibrium quantum dynamics and its broad applications has been enabled by similar non - perturbative functional techniques .",
    "examples include extensive studies of the @xmath13 model in non - equilibrium  @xcite , thermalization , prethermalization and non - thermal fixed points  @xcite , particle production , reheating and defect generation in inflationary universe models  @xcite , and dynamics of ultracold fermionic and bosonic gases  @xcite .",
    "the present work is the first to utilize this powerful technique to study the far - from - equilibrium dynamics of interacting quantum spin systems .",
    "+ understanding the emergence of slow dynamics near thermodynamic phase transitions has implications reaching far beyond the domain of condensed matter physics .",
    "for instance , studies of non - equilibrium quantum fields in the context of inflation and early universe dynamics have suggested that the slowing down of quantum evolution near phase transitions is a plausible explanation for the large number of light particles and broken symmetries in the observable universe  @xcite .",
    "given that the experimental verification of theories about early universe phenomena are typically rather indirect , experiments with synthetic many - body systems that allow precise monitoring of real - time dynamics close to phase transitions could play an important role in elucidating the emergence of slow evolution .",
    "the dynamics of various interacting spin systems have been already investigated in experiments with synthetic quantum matter , including domain formation in spinor condensates  @xcite , the precise measurement of the evolution of spin flips in the ground state of 1d lattice spin systems  @xcite , quantum coherences in long range models  @xcite , and the relaxation dynamics of spin spiral states in 1d and 2d heisenberg models  @xcite .",
