    "exor outbursts are repetitive moderate - amplitude accretion events observed in class i and class ii protostellar sources @xcite . the prototypical source ,",
    "ex lupi , is a @xmath0 m star with a moderate - mass disk and a quiescent luminosity of @xmath1 .",
    "outbursts in exors have durations of the order of a year , recurrence time scales of a few years , and amplitudes that can be as large as @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the origin of exor outbursts is something of a mystery .",
    "they resemble anaemic versions of fu orionis outbursts @xcite , which can be modeled as eruptive accretion disk phenomena localized to the inner au of the system @xcite .",
    "indeed , with improving statistics on episodic accretion in pre - main - sequence stars it has been suggested that fuors and exors may be limiting cases of a continuum of events that occur with a range of amplitudes in both class i and class ii systems @xcite .",
    "any observational kinship between fuors and exors , however , sits uneasily with theoretical models for these phenomena .",
    "@xcite noted that a continuous range of outbursts would be consistent with thermal instability models @xcite , but this conclusion probably does not carry forward to more recent models for fu orionis outbursts that involve a limit cycle in which the inner disk alternates between a cold  dead zone \" @xcite and a rapidly accreting hot state , whose onset is triggered by gravitational instability @xcite .",
    "time - dependent calculations of such a gravo - magneto limit cycle can broadly match observations @xcite .",
    "it is unlikely that the same model could be scaled down for exors , whose lower mass disks and modest outbursts disfavor any role for gravitational instability .",
    "the same is true of an alternate class of models that link fu orionis events to gravitational instability in the outer disk @xcite .",
    "models that invoke roche lobe overflow from close - in planets have more potential to produce phenomenology that spans fuor and exor - class events @xcite , but are less studied .",
    "we propose that exor outbursts in the inner disk are externally triggered by changes in the strength and polarity of the stellar magnetic field .",
    "young stars  including exors @xcite  are frequently magnetically active @xcite , and cyclic accretion could occur as a consequence of either a time - variable torque on the inner disk @xcite , or from instability of a trapped disk whose inner edge is near corotation @xcite .",
    "@xcite developed an explicit model for exors based on the latter idea .",
    "in addition to this direct influence differential rotation between the star and the inner disk inflates and ultimately opens up a fraction of the stellar field lines @xcite .",
    "outward diffusion of this stellar flux can modulate the net flux threading the inner disk and dead zone . under ideal magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) conditions ,",
    "a weak net flux acts to stimulate accretion occurring as a consequence of the magnetorotational instability @xcite .",
    "slightly further out , in the dead zone , the hall effect @xcite is the most important non - ideal mhd process ( for reviews see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "simulations show that the efficiency of angular momentum transport in the hall - dominated regime differs dramatically depending upon whether the net field is aligned or anti - aligned to the rotation axis @xcite .",
    "we therefore suggest that exor outbursts occur due to the mhd response of the inner disk to the changing strength and polarity of a stellar - derived net magnetic field .",
    "we assume that a net vertical magnetic field , derived from the stellar field , threads the inner part of the keplerian accretion disk . at radii just outside the magnetosphere",
    "the disk is conductive enough to behave as an ideal mhd fluid ( this requires that the alkali metals are thermally ionized ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while further out in the dead zone non - ideal mhd effects are dominant . in both regimes",
    "the effect of the net vertical field on accretion is conventionally parameterized by the mid - plane ratio of gas to magnetic pressure , @xmath3 we make use of the results of shearing - box simulations in which the @xmath4 entering into the above equation is the _ initial _ field threading the local domain ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and hence define @xmath5 using the gas pressure in the disk and only the external magnetic field derived from the star . under ideal mhd conditions it is well - established that a net field enhances the saturated accretion stress @xcite .",
    "a fit to the results of @xcite gives the dependence as , @xmath6 here @xmath7 is the shakura - sunyaev parameter describing angular momentum transport @xcite . in the absence of any net field numerical simulations",
    "suggest that the magnetorotational instability @xcite yields @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "a net field then enhances the stress for @xmath9 .",
    "roughly the same threshold applies to the dead zone , notwithstanding the different physics at work there .",
    "for example , at 1  au in a minimum mass solar nebula @xcite disk @xcite , using simulations that included all three non - ideal mhd effects , found that @xmath10 for an aligned field with @xmath11 , while @xmath12 for an anti - aligned field of the same strength .",
    "the mid - plane gas pressure can be estimated from steady - state viscous disk theory . in steady - state",
    "the surface density @xmath13 is related to the accretion rate @xmath14 via @xmath15 , where the kinematic viscosity @xmath16 . here",
    "@xmath17 is the sound speed and @xmath18 the angular velocity .",
    "the mid - plane density @xmath19 , where the scale height @xmath20 . we then have , @xmath21 for an initial estimate of where in the disk net fields may impact accretion we simply extrapolate the stellar dipole field @xmath22 to the disk outside the magnetosphere , and solve for the critical radius interior to which @xmath23 . of the quantities entering the definition of @xmath5",
    "the strongest radial dependence comes from the dipole variation of the external field strength , followed by @xmath24 in equation  ( [ eq_disk_pressure ] ) .",
    "we therefore ignore the weak radial scaling of the sound speed , finding ( for a solar mass star ) , @xmath25 here we have used a sound speed @xmath26 appropriate for @xmath27 ( and mean molecular weight @xmath28 ) .",
    "interior to @xmath29 the response of the disk depends upon how the time scale for variations in the net flux compares to the viscous time scale .",
    "rapid changes to the flux would modulate the local @xmath14 at approximately constant @xmath13 , while slow changes would lead to order unity variations in the surface density and mass of the inner disk ( once it had attained a new steady - state ) .",
    "the amount of mass involved is @xmath30 .",
    "adopting the same fiducial parameters as in equation  ( [ eq_rcrit ] ) we find @xmath31 .",
    "this is comparable to the amount of mass accreted during some exor outbursts .",
    "@xcite , for example , estimated an accretion rate during outburst of @xmath32 for the exor v1118 orionis .",
    "the above estimate suggests that changes to the stellar magnetic field , acting indirectly via its influence on the accretion stress in the inner disk , could potentially modulate the accretion rate at levels comparable to those required to explain exor events .",
    "we now proceed to consider two additional complications .",
    "first , differential rotation between the star and its disk is likely to open up field lines , such that the relevant net field is an outwardly diffusing disk field rather than a direct extrapolation of the stellar dipole .",
    "second , the naive estimate for @xmath29 above lies close to the inner edge of the dead zone ( nominally 0.1  au in the original model of * ? ? ?",
    "a dynamically significant @xmath5 that extends into the dead zone opens up a stroner path to instability , because in the hall - dominated inner disk not just the strength but also the _ polarity _ of the net field has a decisive impact on accretion @xcite .    to estimate the disk field",
    "we assume that differential rotation opens up stellar field that threads the disk beyond the magnetospheric radius @xmath33 . with a dipole approximation , the open magnetic flux that is available to diffuse through",
    "the disk is , @xmath34 the detailed distribution of open flux in the inner disk will be time - dependent and complex , but is generically expected to have a flatter distribution than a simple extrapolation of the stellar dipole .",
    "the principle dependence is on the ratio of the effective velocities for the advection and diffusion of magnetic flux , @xmath35 and @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "@xcite ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) find approximate steady - state solutions for the disk field , @xmath37 with power - law slopes , @xmath38 the appropriate values for the transport coefficients ( and hence the ratio @xmath39 ) in protoplanetary disks are not fully determined , but the general theoretical preference is for @xmath40 @xcite . leaving @xmath41 as a free parameter , we assume that after a reversal the open flux follows a power - law out to some distance @xmath42 , with no flux at larger radii .",
    "the disk field at @xmath42 is then ( for @xmath43 ) , @xmath44 combining this with the expression for the radial dependence of the disk pressure ( equation  [ eq_disk_pressure ] ) we find , @xmath45 where @xmath17 and @xmath7 are to be evaluated at radius @xmath42 . numerically , @xmath46 this estimate is derived assuming a steady - state disk . to apply it to the dead zone",
    ", we need to know how the mid - plane pressure there differs from that in the adjacent thermally ionized region .",
    "one possibility is that @xmath7 at the inner edge of the dead zone is very low , in which case gas could accumulate there producing high pressure conditions that would render plausible net disk fields permanently irrelevant",
    ". this would be the case if ohmic diffusion were the only non - ideal effect at work @xcite . in the presence of the hall effect , though , simulations suggest that the value of @xmath7 given the favorable aligned orientation of the net field is _ not _ small , even in the nominal dead zone . assuming frequent reversals of the net field s polarity , the appropriate @xmath7 to use in the above estimate is the average of the aligned and anti - aligned hall values , which is likely to be comparable to @xmath47 @xcite .    adopting as the criterion for hall effect physics to impact accretion at the inner edge of the dead zone that @xmath9 ,",
    "equation  ( [ eq_beta_r ] ) suggests that it is possible ( but not guaranteed ) for residual stellar fields diffusing through the disk to play a role .",
    "the factors that favor a role for stellar fields are lower disk accretion rates , strong stellar magnetic fields , and a larger fraction of the stellar flux available to diffuse through the disk .",
    "exactly where the inner edge of the dead zone lies will also be critically important .",
    "the radius where the disk temperature first falls below the thermal ionization threshold of 800 - 1000  k @xcite is dependent on the degree of viscous heating .",
    "a purely passive disk model @xcite attains temperatures of @xmath48 only well inside 0.1  au .",
    "models that include viscous heating ( typically following an @xmath7-prescription formalism , and assuming standard dust opacities ) push the critical radius out to @xmath49 @xcite . intermediate values would result if dead zone heating is strongly concentrated toward low optical depths near the disk surface .    . beyond the magnetosphere ,",
    "differential rotation between the disk and stellar surface opens up a fraction of the stellar field lines , liberating vertical flux that diffuses outward through the disk at a rate much faster than viscous diffusion .",
    "this affects the accretion rate via two effects . in the region of the disk where ideal mhd is a good approximation ,",
    "the accretion stress increases at points in the cycle where the _ strength _ of the net field is locally high . in the dead zone",
    ", the hall effect strongly suppresses accretion when the _ polarity _ of the field is anti - aligned to the disk rotation .",
    "subsequent diffusion of aligned field into the dead zone results in efficient angular momentum transport , heating , and a burst of accretion.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    figure  [ fig1 ] illustrates how stellar dynamo cycles could trigger accretion outbursts via the polarity - dependence of hall mhd .",
    "low - rate accretion occurs when the net disk field threading the inner edge of the dead zone , derived from the stellar field , is anti - aligned to the disk rotation @xmath50 .",
    "high - rate accretion is triggered when the stellar magnetic field flips , and aligned net field @xmath51 diffuses outward into the dead zone region . as noted above the reversal in net field polarity",
    "could plausibly alter the efficiency of angular momentum transport by an order of magnitude , or more .",
    "we caution , however , that the impact of the hall effect on disk accretion depends on details of the disk chemistry , and simulations relevant to the inner edge of the dead zone at radii interior to 1  au have not been reported .",
    "in addition to the field being strong enough , two additional conditions need to be met for stellar magnetic cycles to trigger dead zone exor outbursts .",
    "first , changes in the stellar field need to be communicated to the dead zone region on a time scale of , at most , a few years , to match observational constraints on outburst recurrence times @xcite .",
    "second , the viscous time scale in the outburst state needs to match observations .    to estimate the time scale for communication of stellar field changes to the dead zone we apply the transport theory developed by @xcite , which is based on assuming that a purely poloidal force - free field threads a thin turbulent disk",
    ". in this limit diffusion of the net field occurs on a time scale that is shorter by a factor of @xmath52 than radial advection by the accretion flow ( implying , in this scenario , that net field liberated from the magnetosphere escapes radially outward ) .",
    "this results in an estimate , @xmath53 we adopt a higher value of @xmath7 here because the field is diffusing through the inner disk , described by ideal mhd , where the net field enhances transport independent of field polarity @xcite .",
    "this estimate is crude and it ignores important physical effects . the complex and time - dependent interaction between the stellar magnetosphere and the disk @xcite will affect net flux transport in the inner disk . both mhd and force - free simulations show that open field is rapidly dispersed from the vicinity of the magnetosphere @xcite .",
    "outward transport at a rate substantially faster than that implied by the @xcite model would reduce the field strength threading the dead zone , and limit the influence of the hall effect on accretion . working in the opposite direction , the effect of the vertical disk structure on the transport co",
    "- efficients can enhance ( inward ) advection with the mean flow @xcite .",
    "finally the discontinuity in disk properties at the location of the dead zone may also impact transport , perhaps particularly in the case where the inner part of the dead zone is largely laminar .",
    "none of these effects are easy to quantify .",
    "we note , however , that an outburst with an accreted mass of @xmath54 requires a surface density change of only @xmath55 over 0.1  au scales .",
    "it seems possible that enough field could diffuse to 0.1  au on @xmath56yr time scales to cause such a perturbation .",
    "potentially the hardest constraint to match is on the expected time scale of the events .",
    "if we assume that the @xmath57 magnitude increase in brightness during an exor event points to roughly a 2 orders of magnitude increase in accretion rate , the disk sound speed at the onset of outburst might rise by a modest factor ( very approximately we expect @xmath58 ) .",
    "the nominal viscous time @xmath59 is then , @xmath60 in practice the evolution of disk structures containing sharp initial gradients occurs on a small fraction of the nominal viscous time ( see e.g. the green s function solution for a narrow ring ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so the above estimate is likely marginally consistent with exor durations of the order of a year .",
    "generically , if both fuors and exors originate from disk instabilities associated with the dead zone we expect fuors to be longer lived events , consistent with observations , as the inner edge of the dead zone is further out at higher accretion rates .",
    "we have argued that exor outbursts could be triggered by stellar dynamo cycles , via a mechanism that involves diffusion of stellar magnetic flux through the inner disk into the hall - dominated dead zone .",
    "there are obvious uncertainties . in the region of the disk governed by ideal mhd",
    "we have ignored the possibility that net flux threading the inner disk launches a disk wind @xcite , and neglected the known complexities of disk - magnetosphere interactions @xcite . in the dead zone",
    "we have motivated our arguments using simulations that are strictly appropriate only at larger radii , and although the physics underlying the hall - mediated bimodality in accretion stress is well - established @xcite our conclusions are quite dependent on the location of the inner edge of the dead zone .",
    "more broadly , of course , it is not known whether exor hosts exhibit the requisite dynamo activity .",
    "observationally , an association between exors and stellar magnetic activity is an obvious possibility given the time scales , recurrences , and approximately periodic nature of the outbursts .",
    "irrespective of the details , the model predicts that exor events ought to correlate with indicators of stellar magnetic activity ( with a lag reflecting the propagation time scale of magnetic field through the disk ) , and might be preferentially seen toward those stars with the strongest magnetic activity .    in the broader context of eruptive protostellar phenomena",
    ", some recent observational studies advocate a scenario in which fuors and exors are members of a continuum of outbursting systems @xcite .",
    "such a scenario appears consistent with a theoretical model in which fuors and exors both arise from modulation of inner disk accretion related to instabilities that occur near the inner edge of the dead zone at 0.1 - 1  au scales .",
    "what may distinguish exors and fuors is the nature of the trigger , with exors being externally triggered by changes in the stellar magnetic field , whereas fuors are internally triggered by the onset of gravitational instability @xcite ."
