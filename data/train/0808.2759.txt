    "recently , layered perovskite compound cs@xmath0agf@xmath1 containing the spin-1/2 4d@xmath5 ag(ii ) ion has attracted great interest , owing to its isostructural to the high - t@xmath6 3d@xmath5 cu(ii ) cuprates .",
    "cs@xmath0agf@xmath1 was first refined to the tetragonal structure with the space group _ i4/mmm _ in 1974 by odenthal et al .",
    "@xcite . very recently ,",
    "however , mclain _ et al . _",
    "@xcite found that the crystal structure is orthorhombic with the space group _ bbcm_. the magnetic susceptibility and the inelastic neutron scattering experiments showed that this compound is well described as a two - dimensional ( 2d ) ferromagnet ( fm ) with t@xmath6 @xmath7 15 k @xcite .",
    "further , mclain _ et al .",
    "_ suggested that cs@xmath0agf@xmath1 is orbitally ordered at all temperatures of measurement , and the orbital ordering ( oo ) is responsible for the fm .",
    "these properties is in sharp contrast to the high - t@xmath6 parent la@xmath0cuo@xmath1 that are antiferromagnetic ( afm ) insulators .",
    "the microscopic origin of the unusual fm and oo in cs@xmath0agf@xmath1 attracts a lot of attentions .    in cs@xmath0agf@xmath1 ,",
    "the basal plane consists of a 2d lattice of jahn - teller ( jt ) distorted agf@xmath8 octahedra with a pattern of alternating short and long ag - f bonds . these analogous compounds with orbital degeneracy , such as cs@xmath0agf@xmath1 and k@xmath0cuf@xmath1 , _ etc .",

    "notice that the former with active jt ions leads to an orthorhombic structure , while the latter with nondegenerate orbitals only has a tetragonal structure .",
    "although the difference between these two structures seems small , _",
    "i.e. _ the main change is the position of the fluorine atoms in the basal plane , such difference is of the utmost importance in leading to the distinct properties @xcite . from early studies @xcite in perovskite compounds",
    ", it is known that the anharmonic jt effect is a decisive factor for the orthorhombic crystal structure . to date , a lot of studies have been done for cs@xmath0agf@xmath1 utilizing the density functional theory @xcite , however , few authors focus on the anharmonic jt effect on the lattice , oo and fm groundstate properties in cs@xmath0agf@xmath1 .    previous studies in analogous compound k@xmath0cuf@xmath1 have provided us two distinct scenarios for the fm and oo ground state . on the one hand ,",
    "kugel and khomskii showed that the cooperative jt effect , especially the anharmonic jt effect @xcite , play a key role in stabilizing the oo ground state in k@xmath0cuf@xmath1 . on the other hand , to resolve the difficulty of the kugel - khomskii ( kk ) electronic superexchange ( se ) coupling model @xcite , which is usually suitable for the mott - hubbard insulators with u@xmath9 @xmath10 @xmath11 ( here u@xmath9 is the on - site coulomb repulsion and @xmath11 is the charge transfer energy ) , and to address the fm and oo ground state , mostovoy and khomskii @xcite proposed a modified se coupling model , which is suitable for the charge transfer insulating k@xmath0cuf@xmath1 with u@xmath9 @xmath12 @xmath11 . obviously , to understand the unusual groundstate properties , such as the lattice , orbital and magnetic properties in k@xmath0cuf@xmath1 and cs@xmath0agf@xmath1",
    ", one should incorporate the cooperative jt effect @xcite and the anharmonic jt effect into the charge - transfer se interactions .    to treat these strongly correlated systems more precisely , based on the cluster self - consistent field approach",
    "developed previously @xcite , we explicitly take into account the orthorhombic jt distortions and the charge - transfer se interactions , in which spin order , oo and lattice distortion are determined self - consistently .",
    "we show that driven by strong anharmonic effect and hund s coupling , cs@xmath0agf@xmath1 has a much more stable ferromagnetic ground state .",
    "the theoretical amplitudes of lattice distortions , q@xmath0 and q@xmath3 , the magnetic coupling strengthes , j@xmath4 , and the magnetic moment , are in good agreement with the experimental observation in cs@xmath0agf@xmath1 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : an effective hamiltonian and the cluster self - consistent field ( scf ) approach are described in _ sec .",
    "ii _ ; then the results and discussions about the lattice structure and distortions , orbital ordering and magnetic properties in cs@xmath0agf@xmath1 are presented in _ sec .",
    "iii _ ; the last section is devoted to the remarks and summary .",
    "an effective 2d hamiltonian in cs@xmath0agf@xmath1 including both the se and the jt couplings is written : @xmath13 where h@xmath14 describes the highly symmetrical effective se couplings between spins and orbitals ; h@xmath15 describes the jt couplings associated with the electron and the lattice distortion .",
    "note that spin , orbital and lattice degrees of freedom couple to each other in hamiltonian ( 1 ) .",

    "and @xmath23 is the linear jt coupling strength , @xmath24 is the coefficient of quadratic coupling , and @xmath25 is the elastic constant . for cs@xmath0agf@xmath1 , we fix @xmath25 @xmath26 10 ev/@xmath27 throughout this paper .    since cs@xmath0agf@xmath1 is strongly correlated charge - transfer insulator @xcite , the 2d se interactions between 4d orbitals of ag@xmath16 ions through 2p orbitals of @xmath28 atoms are described @xcite : @xmath29,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here the operator @xmath30 denotes the s @xmath26 1/2 spin at site _",
    "i _ , and @xmath31 , which is the combination of the components of the orbital operators @xmath32 .",
    "@xmath33 , and ( @xmath34 , @xmath35)=(@xmath36 , @xmath37 ) , denote the direction of a bond in the agf@xmath1 sheets . in eq .",
    "( 3 ) , the coupling coefficients j@xmath38 ( n=1 - 5 ) , read : @xmath39 $ ] , @xmath40 $ ] , @xmath41 $ ] , @xmath42 $ ] and @xmath43 $ ] with t=@xmath44 , respectively . here",
    "@xmath11 is the electron transfer energy between silver 4d to fluorin 2p orbitals ; u@xmath9 , u@xmath45 are the coulomb repulsion energies on ag and @xmath28 , respectively ; and j@xmath46 is the hund s coupling on ag .",
    "note that the coefficients may be positive and negative , thus the afm and the fm components coexist in j@xmath47 .",
    "since the 4d orbitals of ag@xmath16 ions are less localized than the 3d orbitals of cu@xmath16 ions in k@xmath0cuf@xmath1 , the coulomb repulsion u@xmath9 of ag@xmath16 ion is about 3 @xmath48 5 ev , and j@xmath46 ranges from 0.1 ev to 0.5 ev , in accordance with the lda+u results @xcite . in general , the coulomb repulsion u@xmath45 is about 5 ev in f@xmath49 .",
    "the charge transfer energy @xmath11 is roughly estimated from the difference of the centers of gravity between the 4d and 2p levels in band structures , which also allows to estimate @xmath50 from the bandwidth of electronic structures available @xcite , @xmath11=u@xmath9 - 2 ev , and @xmath50 @xmath51 0.6 ev .    in such a strongly correlated spin - orbital - lattice system , according to feynman - hellman theorem , the ground state energy is minimized with respect to q@xmath18 and q@xmath19 , _ i.e. _ , @xmath52 from which one could find the strength of the normal modes and the lattice distortion critically depend on the orbital polarization through the following equations @xmath53 notice that in the absence of the anharmonic jt effect ( g=0 ) , @xmath10q@xmath18@xmath12 @xmath48 @xmath54(g / k)@xmath10@xmath55@xmath12 and @xmath10q@xmath19@xmath12 @xmath48 @xmath54(g / k)@xmath10@xmath56@xmath12 . to obtain the amplitude of the lattice distortion , one should determine the spin , the orbital and the deformation configurations self - consistently .    in order to treat the spin - orbit correlations and fluctuations with high accuracy in strongly correlated system ,",
    "the cluster - scf approach @xcite developed previously is applied to the spin - orbital hamiltonian ( 1 ) .",
    "the cluster - scf approach includes the exact treatment to the interactions inside the cluster , and the self - consistent field treatment on the interactions between the cluster and the surrounding environment .",
    "the main procedure is shortly outlined as follows : first , we choose a cluster consisting of 4 ag@xmath16 ions .",
    "the @xmath22 site is surrounded by two ag sites inside the cluster and two ag sites outside the cluster , which provide two internal interactions and two external scf fields , respectively .",
    "thus , the effective hamiltonian of the cluster reads : @xmath57   + g\\sum_{i}(q_{i3}\\tau^{z}_{i}+{q_{i2}\\tau^{x}_{i } } )   \\nonumber \\\\   & & + g\\sum_{i}[(q_{i3}^{2}-q_{i2}^{2})\\tau_{i}^{z }     -2q_{i2}q_{i3}\\tau_{i}^{x } ] \\nonumber\\\\   & & + \\frac{k}{2}\\sum_{i}(q_{i2}^{2}+q_{i3}^{2})+ \\sum_{i } h^{scf}_{i}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the scf h@xmath58 contributing from the @xmath59 external site interacting with the @xmath22 internal site through h@xmath60 , @xmath61 , where @xmath62 denotes the reduced density matrix of the @xmath63 site , and _",
    "i _ runs over all sites inside the cluster .",
    "we first substitute the spin coupling @xmath64 into the cluster hamiltonian with the initial spin correlation function @xmath65 , and diagonalize the orbital part of the cluster hamiltonian ( 5 ) in the presence of the orbital scf .",
    "the orbitalization @xmath66 and the orbital correlation functions @xmath67 are thus obtained . and",
    "then , we substitute the orbital operator and the orbital couplings with @xmath66 and @xmath67 into @xmath68 , and diagonalize the spin part of the cluster hamiltonian in the presence of the spin scf .",
    "hence , we obtain a set of new averaged spin @xmath30 and spin correlation functions @xmath64 .",
    "repeat the above steps until the groundstate energy and the spin and orbital correlation functions converge to the accuracies . from the stable spin - orbital ground state",
    ", one could get the spin coupling strengths j@xmath69 and j@xmath70 through j@xmath71= j@xmath72+j@xmath0@xmath73 + j@xmath3@xmath74 , here @xmath75 .",
    "the advantage of our approach over the traditional mean - field method is that the short - range spin and orbital correlations as well as the quantum fluctuations are taken into account properly , especially in the low - dimensional systems .",
    "in this section , we present the numerical results of the ground state of the charge - transfer insulator cs@xmath0agf@xmath1 within the cluster - scf approach . we mainly discuss the role of the anharmonic effect on lattice structure and distortions , orbital ordering and magnetic properties in the ground state .      to clarify the roles of the se coupling and the jt effect on the origin of the fm , we first perform numerical calculations on eq .",
    "( 5 ) and obtain the g - j@xmath76 phase diagram , as shown in fig .",
    "1 . since the on - site coulomb interaction u@xmath9 in cs@xmath0agf@xmath1 is not well defined , we present the g - j@xmath76 phase diagram for u@xmath9=3 , 4 , and 5 ev in fig .",
    "1(a ) , 1(b ) and 1(c ) , respectively .",
    "accordingly , we find that the anharmonic distortion strength g plays a very important role in the phase diagram . with the variation of g from negative to positive via zero",
    ", the fm - afm phase boundaries exhibit critical changes . as we see in fig .",
    "1(a ) , at g=@xmath540.75 g , the stable groundstate phase in the regions i , ii , iii and iv is afm , while that in the region v is fm ; at g=0 , a vertical line separates the afm ground state in the regions i , ii , and iii from the fm one in the regions iv and v ; when the anharmonic distortion strength g becomes positive , more regions become fm ordering ; at g=0.75 g , only the ground state in the region i is afm . fig .",
    "1(b ) and fig .",
    "1(c ) qualitatively resemble to fig .",
    "the competitive fm and afm couplings in the se hamiltonian result in the fm phase for large j@xmath46 and the afm phase for small j@xmath46 in these phases . as we expect in fig .",
    "1(a ) to fig .",
    "1(c ) , strong coulomb repulsion favors afm phase , hence the afm regime becomes large with the increase of the u@xmath77 .",
    "besides the fact that strong hund s coupling j@xmath46 favors the fm phase , the large anharmonic jt effect also favors the fm ground state .",
    "therefore , the complete consideration of the realistic interactions in eq .",
    "( 1 ) most probably leads to the fm ground state in cs@xmath0agf@xmath1 . and",
    "from the recent first - principles electronic calculations , the coulomb repulsion between ag 4d electrons is about 3 ev @xcite .",
    "we expect that the hund s coupling j@xmath46 lies in 0.1 @xmath48 0.3 ev , so that the interaction parameters of cs@xmath0agf@xmath1 fall in the fm region in the phase diagram .",
    "experimentally , it is hard to determine the sign of the anharmonic coupling strength g in cs@xmath0agf@xmath1 . from fig .",
    "1 , it is seen that when positive anharmonic effect is very large , the ground state stabilizes in the fm phase even in the absence of hund s coupling .",
    "therefore the positive anharmonic coupling most favors the fm ground state . on the contrary , for g @xmath10 0 , due to the se coupling ,",
    "the ground state is fm when the harmonic jt coupling strength g is small ; however , when g becomes large , the anharmonic coupling favors the afm ground state .",
    "thus , considering the strong jt effect in cs@xmath0agf@xmath1 , one expects that g is most probably positive , which will be further confirmed in the lattice distortion , the orbital ordering and the magnetic properties in what follows .",
    "different from la@xmath0cuo@xmath1 , the unusual fm and the orthorhombic structure of cs@xmath0agf@xmath1 is the result of the interplays of the spin , orbital and lattice degrees of freedom , especially the contribution of the anharmonic jt effect .",
    "the normal coordinates q@xmath0 and q@xmath3 of the jt distortions in cs@xmath0agf@xmath1 are obtained self - consistently through eq .",
    "( 4 ) and ( 5 ) .",
    "we find that for positive and large g , the structural distortion in the ground state is antiferro - type , ( q@xmath0 , q@xmath3 ; @xmath54q@xmath0 , q@xmath3 ) , corresponding to the alternative short and long bonds in the agf@xmath1 plaquette .",
    "however , the groundstate energy of the ferro - type ( q@xmath0 , q@xmath3 ; q@xmath0 , q@xmath3 ) distortion is higher than that of the antiferro - type distortion , as shown in fig . 2 . and",
    "the ferro - type distortion only appears in the strong jt region because of its instability in this system .",
    "notice that the experimentally observed lattice structure has the antiferro - type distortion with the long and short ag - f bond lengths of 2.441 and 2.111 @xmath78 in the agf@xmath79 plaquette @xcite , one can deduce the corresponding distortions q@xmath0 @xmath80 0.33 @xmath78 and q@xmath3 @xmath80 @xmath540.19 @xmath78 .",
    "theoretically , through the self - consistent numerical calculations , we obtain the amplitudes of the q@xmath0 and the q@xmath3 distortions in cs@xmath0agf@xmath1 with the variation of the jt coupling for different anharmonic coupling parameters , as shown in fig .",
    "when the linear jt coupling strength g is about 4.8 ev/@xmath78 at g=0.75 g , the theoretical distortions are @xmath81 @xmath80 0.33 @xmath78 and q@xmath3 @xmath80 @xmath540.19 @xmath78 , see the dashed vertical line in fig .",
    "3 , in good agreement with the corresponding experimental observation in cs@xmath0agf@xmath1 @xcite . meanwhile , we find that the positive g leads to the negative q@xmath3 , giving rise to the correct distortion c / a @xmath26 2s/(l+s ) @xmath10 1 in orthorhombic cs@xmath0agf@xmath1 .",
    "however , the negative g gives a positive q@xmath3 , resulting a wrong distortion c / a @xmath26 2l/(l+s ) @xmath12 1 .",
    "all the other analogous substances without jt ions , _ e.g. _",
    "k@xmath0nif@xmath1 , k@xmath0mnf@xmath1 @xcite , are tetragonal , rather than the orthorhombic symmetry in cs@xmath0agf@xmath1 with jt ions .",
    "in fact , it is the positive anharmonic effect that lowers the lattice symmetry , leading to the compression of the ligand octahedron along the c - axis @xcite .",
    "the unusual fm and distinct orthorhombic structure in cs@xmath0agf@xmath1 are in fact associated with the formation of the long - range oo , as shown by a few authors recently utilizing the first - principles calculations @xcite .",
    "our study also confirms this point .",
    "more further , we demonstrate that the anharmonic effect plays an essential role in the oo properties of cs@xmath0agf@xmath1 . in general , one can describe the orbital occupied state of each site in terms of @xmath82=cos@xmath83 @xmath84 @xmath85 sin@xmath83@xmath86 with the orbital angle @xmath87 . here",
    "@xmath88 refers to the two sublattices of the antiferro - distortion in agf@xmath1 plaquette .",
    "4 shows the orbital angle @xmath87 as a function of the linear jt coupling strength g with different anharmonic coupling g. the role of the anharmonic coupling on the orbital angle , hence the oo , is clearly seen . for strong jt distortion and g=0.75 g ,",
    "the oo is staggered _ @xmath89_/_@xmath90 _ , see inset ( b ) in fig .",
    "the orbital angle obtained is about 61.8@xmath91 for g=4.8 ev/@xmath78 , as indicated by the dashed vertical line in fig .",
    "4 , which is consistent with the experimental suggestion for cs@xmath0agf@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "this is different from the case in la@xmath0cuo@xmath1 , where the distance between apical o and cu is much larger than that in the a - b plane , resulting in the pure @xmath92 hole orbitals .    as a comparison , for g @xmath10 0 , the orbital angle @xmath87 @xmath12 @xmath93 ; as @xmath94 becomes very large , @xmath87 @xmath95 @xmath96 , and",
    "the holes orderedly occupy the d@xmath97/d@xmath98 orbitals , as seen the inset ( a ) in fig .",
    "@xmath26 0 , however , the orbital angle is nearly constant with the increase of the linear jt coupling g , giving rise to @xmath87=68@xmath91 .",
    "note that in the absence of the anharmonic effect , the se couplings contribute to the same oo as the harmonic jt effect does .",
    "in this situation , the orbital configuration is characterized by orbital angle @xmath99 : @xmath100 @xcite .",
    "then @xmath101 @xmath48 @xmath102 , which is almost independent of the linear coupling g , indicating that the linear jt coupling has a little influence on the orbital angle in the absence of the anharmonic effect .",
    "this also shows the key role of the anharmonic effect in the oo from the other aspect .",
    "the magnetic properties are also strongly influenced by the anharmonic effect , as shown in fig .",
    "5 . in the present situation",
    ", we find that the difference between j@xmath103 and j@xmath70 is negligible . from fig . 5",
    ", one finds that in the absence of the anharmonic effect ( g@xmath260 ) , due to the se coupling , the magnetic couplings between ag spins are fm , and nearly remain unchange with the increasing of g. while for g @xmath10 0 , due to the se coupling , the spin coupling between ag ions is fm at small g. with the increase of the jt effect , the magnetic couplings between ag ions , j@xmath4 , vary from fm to afm , which is in contradiction with cs@xmath0agf@xmath1 .",
    "for g=4.8 ev/@xmath78 and g=0.75 g , as denoted by the dashed vertical line in fig . 5 , the magnetic couplings in the agf@xmath1 plaquette , _",
    "i.e. _ j@xmath4 , are about @xmath543.3 mev , very close to the experimental values , @xmath543.793 @xmath48 @xmath545.0 mev @xcite .",
    "the agreement between the present spin coupling strengths and the experimental observation is much better than those inferred from the first - principles electronic structure calculations @xcite .",
    "this result , combining those of the lattice distortion and the orbital angle , is in accordance with the goodenough - kanamori - anderson rules @xcite .",
    "also in fig . 5 ,",
    "one notices that in the presence of strong anharmonic coupling g , the fm coupling strength increases with the linear jt coupling g. therefore the fm couplings in cs@xmath0agf@xmath1 further verify the key role of the anharmonic effect in the groundstate properties .",
    "in addition , the calculated magnetic moment is about 1 @xmath104 , which approaches the classical value and is comparable to the experimental data observed in muon - spin relaxation experiment @xcite .",
    "this is a classical value of ag ion , in comparison with the experimental value 0.8 @xmath104 at 5 k @xcite .",
    "the reduction of the experimental magnetic moment may originate from three reasons : the presence of non - magnetic impurity phases and the covalence effects as pointed by mclain , _ et al .",
    "@xcite , as well as the afm fluctuations between agf@xmath1 layers .",
    "we expect that the weak interlayer afm interaction and the covalency effect , which are neglected in the present 2d model , contribute to the major part of the reduction of the magnetic moment of ag spins .",
    "as we have shown in the preceding sections , the anharmonic jt effect drives the 4d orbitals of cs@xmath0agf@xmath1 into the d@xmath105/d@xmath106 ordering , rather than the d@xmath107 orbital ordering in la@xmath0cuo@xmath1 . in consistent with the goodenough - kanamori - anderson rules",
    "@xcite , the ground state of cs@xmath0agf@xmath1 is unusual fm insulating with the orthorhombic structure , different from the _ neel _ afm insulating ground state with the tetrahedral structure in la@xmath0cuo@xmath1 .",
    "our results preclude the possibility of the fm ground state originating from the covalency effect @xcite .",
    "one consequence of such a difference is that the electron or hole doping in la@xmath0cuo@xmath1 leads to the strong afm fluctuations , which may contribute to the cooper - pairing glue for the high - t@xmath108 superconductivity .",
    "we anticipate that the electron doping in cs@xmath0agf@xmath1 will lead to weak fm fluctuation , though it will not contribute to the same sc mechanism as the cuprate superconductors .",
    "notice that in the present intermediate correlated and charge transfer insulator , the 2d effective se interactions incorporating the jt couplings underestimate the covalency effect between ag 4d and f 2p orbitals .",
    "the covalency effect between ag and f ions can be well considered within the first - principles electronic structure calculations @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "once the jt distortion occurs , the hopping integrals , t@xmath4 , between ag ions are slightly different in different crystallographic axes .",
    "we expect that this change will not significantly modify our results quantitatively .    in summary ,",
    "an effective model hamiltonian with spin , orbital and lattice degrees of freedom coupling to each other , allows us to self - consistently describe the lattice structure change , orbital ordering and magnetic coupling properties , _ etc . _ driven by the jt distortion , especially by the anharmonic effect , cs@xmath0agf@xmath1 stabilizes in the 2d fm ground state . the correct lattice structure",
    ", orbital ordering and magnetic coupling observed experimentally can also be addressed in the present theoretical framework .",

    "<S> we develop the cluster self - consistent field method incorporating both electronic and lattice degrees of freedom to study the origin of ferromagnetism in cs@xmath0agf@xmath1 . after self - consistently determining the harmonic and anharmonic jahn - teller distortions , </S>",
    "<S> we show that the anharmonic distortion stabilizes the staggered x@xmath2-z@xmath2/y@xmath2-z@xmath2 orbital and ferromagnetic ground state , rather than the antiferromagnetic one . </S>",
    "<S> the amplitudes of lattice distortions , q@xmath0 and q@xmath3 , the magnetic coupling strengthes , j@xmath4 , and the magnetic moment , are in good agreement with the experimental observation . </S>"
