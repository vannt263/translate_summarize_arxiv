    "qcd matter with @xmath1 flavors , @xmath2 colors and zero baryon chemical potential undergoes two finite temperature phase transitions , the chiral transition and the deconfinement .",
    "the chiral transition is associated with the spontaneous breaking of the chiral symmetry , @xmath3 , below the critical temperature ( @xmath4 ) for massless quarks .",
    "the order parameter for this transition is the chiral condensate . on the other hand",
    "the deconfinement transition is associated with the spontaneous symmetry breaking , @xmath5 , above the critical temperature @xmath6 for infinitely heavy quarks .",
    "the order parameter for this transition is the polyakov loop expectation value . for finite non - zero quark masses",
    "both the chiral symmetry and the @xmath0 symmetry are explicitly broken .",
    "nevertheless these two transitions show up as crossover , second or first order transitions depending on the values of the quark masses .",
    "the chiral transition depends on the number of quark flavors and the deconfinement transition depends on the number of colors .",
    "since the chiral symmetry and the @xmath0 symmetry seem nothing to do with each other one would expect that these two transitions occur independently .",
    "however lattice qcd calculations have shown that both these transitions occur simultaneously , @xmath7 [ 1 - 5 ] .",
    "furthermore strong correlation between the chiral condensate and the polyakov loop is observed around the phase transition point@xcite .",
    "this is clear evidence that there is interaction between these two order parameters .",
    "so studying the interaction between the chiral condensate and the polyakov loop is fundamental to understanding the interplay between the chiral transition and deconfinement .",
    "there are several studies on the possible causes of the simultaneous occurrence of the chiral transition and the deconfinement transition . mixing between the gauge and matter field operators",
    "has been suggested to explain the simultaneous chiral and deconfinement transitions @xcite .",
    "some other studies consider that for small quark masses the chiral transition drives the deconfinement transition @xcite .",
    "though most of the studies are concerned with why @xmath7 only a few have considered the effect of the interaction on the phase transition itself @xcite .",
    "it seems natural to expect that if the interaction between the two order parameters can result in the simultaneous occurrence of the two transitions then the interaction may also have important effect on the phase transition .",
    "one of the most interesting cases to study for the possible effects of this interaction is the 2-flavor chiral transition .",
    "lattice qcd calculations have not yet been able to settle on the order of this phase transition .",
    "lattice calculations by different groups do not agree on the order of this phase transition .",
    "some lattice groups find the transition is second order @xcite and other groups find the transition is first order @xcite .",
    "conventionally this transition is believed to be second order and in the universality class of @xmath8 heisenberg magnet @xcite .",
    "but the effect of interaction between the chiral order parameter ( @xmath9 ) and the polyakov loop ( @xmath10 ) may change the behavior of this transition .",
    "so in the present work we investigate the effect of interaction between @xmath9 and @xmath10 on the 2-flavor chiral transition within an effective lagrangian .",
    "previously , the effect of interaction between the chiral order parameter and the polyakov loop has been studied in the renormalization group approach @xcite .",
    "the main difference between the present work and previous studies is that we consider the explicit breaking of the @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "explicit breaking of the @xmath0 symmetry can be introduced in the effective lagrangian by terms such as @xmath11 , @xmath12 .",
    "previous studies @xcite have considered interaction term , such as @xmath13 , which respects both the chiral and the @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "however , in the chiral limit , the interaction terms need not respect the @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "so terms such as @xmath12 should be considered . as we discuss later such a interaction term",
    "is always present if the explicit @xmath0 symmetry breaking is large , for example in the chiral limit .",
    "for simplicity we consider @xmath14 color qcd .",
    "we expect that different @xmath2 will not qualitatively change the physics we are discussing here . for @xmath15",
    "the chiral order parameter @xmath9 is a four component vector field whereas for @xmath14 the polyakov loop @xmath10 is a real scalar field . in this work we basically study the effect of the three terms , @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 in the effective lagrangian .",
    "our main result is that the strong explicit breaking of the @xmath0 symmetry can make the chiral transition first order .",
    "we show that the chiral transition can be first order even at the mean field level .",
    "we also carry out numerical monte carlo simulations which confirm the first order phase transition for large enough explicit @xmath0 symmetry breaking .",
    "we mention here that the @xmath15 chiral transition can be first order from the interaction term @xmath19 without @xmath0 symmetry breaking @xcite .",
    "however lattice qcd results indicate that effect of the @xmath0 symmetric interaction term is small . a possible first order chiral transition can result more likely from the explicit @xmath0 symmetry breaking as we will argue later .    conventionally explicit symmetry breaking weakens a phase transition .",
    "but our results suggest that for a system with two order parameter fields explicit symmetry breaking can make the transition stronger .",
    "it is interesting to note that the chiral order parameter @xmath9 does not couple to gauge fields directly .",
    "the gauge fields seem to affect the chiral phase transition indirectly , through the polyakov loop .",
    "we mention here that the effect of explicit symmetry breaking discussed here should not be restricted to the @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "we expect that the explicit breaking of chiral symmetry may have some effect on the deconfinement transition in the large quark mass region .",
    "we mention here that interaction between the chiral order parameter and the diquark fields is considered to study the chiral / color - superconducting transition at low temperature and high density @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section - ii",
    "we describe the effective lagrangian and discuss the effect of the interaction between @xmath9 and @xmath10 on the chiral transtition .",
    "we describe our numerical monte carlo calculations and results in section - iii .",
    "the discussions and conclusions are presented in section - iv .",
    "we consider the following lagrangian @xcite in 3 dimension for the @xmath9 and the @xmath10 fields ,    @xmath20    some of the parameters of this reduced 3d lagrangian depend explicitly on temperature .",
    "this lagrangian is invariant under @xmath8 rotation of the @xmath9 field .",
    "the last two terms of @xmath21 break the @xmath22 symmetry ( @xmath23 ) explicitly .",
    "the interactions between the chiral order parameter and the polyakov loop are taken care by 5th and 6th terms in @xmath21 .",
    "the signs of the couplings @xmath24 and @xmath25 decides the correlation between the fluctuations of the @xmath9 and the @xmath10 fields .",
    "for example when @xmath26 , the thermal average of the correlation between the @xmath9 and @xmath10 fluctuations , @xmath27 , is positive .",
    "when @xmath28 , @xmath27 is negative .",
    "such `` anti - correlation '' is seen between the fluctuations of the the chiral condensate and the polyakov loop in the results of lattice qcd calculations@xcite .",
    "the correlation between the variations of the two order parameters with respect to temperature is of the same sign as the correlation between the fluctuations .",
    "note that in the above lagrangian when @xmath29 the @xmath9 field acts like an ordering field for the @xmath10 field . in the chiral symmetric phase the chiral order parameter is small and",
    "the polyakov loop expectation value is large .",
    "the large expectation value of @xmath10 , in the chiral symmetric phase , can result only from the last term in @xmath21 ( with @xmath30 ) because @xmath31 is small .    0.2 cm    as we have mentioned before previous studies @xcite have considered only the interaction term @xmath32 . when the coupling parameters @xmath33 , the chiral transition and the deconfinement transition do not always occur simultaneously . for",
    "large value of the coupling @xmath24 the transitions can occur simultaneously and are of first order when coefficients of @xmath34 and @xmath35 are negative in eq.1 @xcite .",
    "a large positive @xmath24 would increase the critical temperature for the deconfinement transition as the coefficent of @xmath35 term is negative for high temperatures .",
    "lattice results on the other hand show that inclusion of dynamical quarks decrease the deconfinement transition temperature .",
    "so in qcd the coupling @xmath24 should be small .",
    "for small @xmath24 both the transitions are second order and do not occur simultaneously .",
    "0.2 cm    the coupling parameters @xmath25 and @xmath36 represent the strength of the @xmath0 explicit breaking .",
    "so they should increase with decreasing quark masses as the @xmath0 breaking becomes severe .",
    "this can be seen explicitly in the large quark mass region @xcite . to see the effect of the explicit @xmath0 breaking",
    "let us consider @xmath37 and @xmath29 .",
    "at the mean field level one can consider the temperature variation of the parameters @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "for simplicity we fix @xmath40 , @xmath41 and vary the @xmath38 parameter . to find the @xmath38 dependence of @xmath10 and @xmath9 expectation values one has to solve the following coupled equations , @xmath42 we have checked numerically that for large enough @xmath25 these equations give two solutions which correspond to a degenerate minima of the effective potential @xmath21 at some particular value of @xmath38 .",
    "it may seem surprising that the potential @xmath21 has degenerate minima even though there is no cubic term for @xmath9 and @xmath10 in it .",
    "however because of the coupling @xmath25 these two fields are mixed . though the mixing anle varies as @xmath38 is varied . with variation of @xmath38 the minimum of @xmath21 , in the @xmath43 plane , moves in directions other than the @xmath31 or @xmath10 axes . to understand how the minimum of @xmath21 behaves one should express @xmath21 in terms of variables which are the linear combinations of @xmath31 and @xmath10",
    "this would invariably lead to cubic terms of the new fields in the effective potential . for some choice of parameters",
    "the cubic term may then be important to cause degenerate minima of @xmath21 .",
    "even if the explicit symmetry breaking is not strong enough at mean field level fluctuations at higher order can make the transition first order . at one loop",
    "the fluctuations of the @xmath9 field will contribute to a non zero 3-point function of the @xmath10 field .",
    "this 3-point function can be calculated perturbatively . in the high temperature approximation",
    "the 3-point function is given by , @xmath44 assuming zero momentum to all the external @xmath45lines .",
    "@xmath46 here is the mass of the @xmath9 field fluctuations .",
    "given a suitable choice of parameters in the effective lagrangian the three point function can be significant . the consequence of this is a @xmath47 term in the potential @xmath21 with temperature dependent @xmath48 .",
    "this term can cause discontinous change in @xmath10 as temperature varies .",
    "when @xmath10 field changes discontinuously the @xmath9 field will also changes discontinuously because of the coupling term @xmath49 .",
    "if the coefficient of the @xmath50 term changes from @xmath51 to @xmath52 due to discontinuous change in @xmath10 then @xmath9 will change discontinuously from zero to non - zero . the @xmath53 term can also come from other types of explicit symmetry breaking coupling terms but we think @xmath49 is the simplest term in our model .",
    "+ the situation with @xmath54 and @xmath55 is same as the one discussed above . when the explicit symmetry breaking parameter @xmath36 is large , @xmath22 symmetry of the @xmath10 field is lost and the @xmath10 field always has non - zero expectation value @xmath56 . in order to study the fluctuations one must expand the potential @xmath21 around @xmath56 , @xmath57",
    "this gives rise to a term like @xmath58 coming from the expansion of @xmath59 around @xmath60 .",
    "now the term @xmath58 is similar to the one discussed above .",
    "so there can be first order transition when @xmath61 like in the case when @xmath62 .",
    "we observed that at the mean field the transition becomes second order for large quartic couplings @xmath63 .",
    "now in the following section we discuss the numerical monte carlo simulations of the effective lagrangian ( eq.1 ) and the results .",
    "these calculations include higher order as well as non perturbative fluctuations .",
    "vs @xmath68,title=\"fig : \" ] [ mf ]    -0.3 cm     vs @xmath68,title=\"fig : \" ] [ pt ] -0.3 cm    -0.3 cm    since we take @xmath25 to be positive we see @xmath87 and @xmath94 increase or decrease simultaneously .",
    "the choice of the values for the parameters is such that the variation of @xmath87 and @xmath94 are similar in magnitude . for @xmath95 increase in @xmath87 should lead to decrease in @xmath94 .",
    "so in this case the hysteresis loop for @xmath87 will look somewhat similar to fig.1 while the hysteresis loop for @xmath94 will be more or less inverted about the y - axis .",
    "0.2 cm for the second set of parameters we choose @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "the hysteresis loop of @xmath87 and @xmath94 are observed by again varying the parameter @xmath68 .",
    "the choice of @xmath69 and @xmath36 is such that the expectation value of @xmath10 is non - zero and positive .",
    "the sign of @xmath24 assures that increase in @xmath87 leads to decrease in @xmath94 and vice - versa as the parameter @xmath68 is varied .",
    "the hysteresis curves of the two order parameters are shown in fig.3 and fig.4 .",
    "the values of @xmath101 in our calculations are chosen so that we can see first order phase transition clearly and the variation of @xmath87 and @xmath94 are of order o(1 ) across the transition point .",
    "note that with suitable choice of @xmath69 and @xmath102 one change the average of the polyakov loop across the transition point .",
    "the choice @xmath24 was such that the chiral transition turned out to be second order when the coupling @xmath36 was set to zero .",
    "we also did simulations on a 4d lattice .",
    "the results in this case are very similar to the 3d simulations .    -1.3 cm     vs @xmath68,title=\"fig : \" ] [ mf ] -0.3 cm    -0.3 cm     vs @xmath68,title=\"fig : \" ] [ pt ] -0.3 cm    -0.3",
    "cm    the results in fig.1 - 4 show strong first order phase transition for the @xmath9 and @xmath10 fields . by fixing the coupling parameters @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath36",
    "we observed that the strength of the transition depends on the values of the quartic couplings @xmath63 and @xmath102 .",
    "the transition becomes weaker with increase in any of the quartic couplings @xmath101 .",
    "however even for larger quartic couplings a suitable choice of the parameters @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath36 made the transition strong first order .",
    "0.2 cm we also did calculations with small explicit symmetry breaking for the @xmath9 field by considering a linear @xmath9 term in the lagrangian . in this case",
    "we found that the hysteresis loops of both @xmath87 and @xmath94 shrinking in size with increase in the coefficient of linear @xmath9 term in the lagrangian .",
    "these results suggest that the transition becomes weaker when the chiral symmetry is explicitly broken .",
    "using a simple effective lagrangian , which captures the chiral symmetry and @xmath0 symmetry of qcd , we have investigated the effect of the explicit symmetry breaking on the chiral phase transition . since we consider the chiral limit the @xmath22 symmetry of the polyakov loop is explicitly broken .",
    "as we incorporate the explicit @xmath22 breaking interaction terms in the effective lagrangian we find the chiral transition becomes first order .",
    "we observed that the first order transition becomes weaker when a small explicit symmetry breaking is considered for the chiral order parameter @xmath9 .",
    "the results of our calculations show that two flavor chiral transition is of first order for large enough @xmath0 explicit breaking .",
    "as we have mentioned before at present some lattice studies suggest that the transition is first order @xcite and some other studies show the transition is second order @xcite",
    ". these conflicting results may be because the quark masses studied are not small enough or the lattices used are not big enough .    in the previous study , for @xmath15 and @xmath103 @xcite , the second order",
    "chiral transition becomes first order when coupled to the polyakov loop .",
    "this is because the deconfinement transition is first order for @xmath103 with a cubic term @xmath104 in the effective potential with exact @xmath105 symmetry .",
    "however when the quark masses are finite and decrease the deconfinement transition becomes weaker .",
    "this can be understood due to explicit breaking of @xmath105 symmetry .",
    "already in the large quark mass region the deconfinement transition becomes crossover which implies the the explicit symmetry breaking dominates over the effects of the above @xmath105 symmetric cubic term . for smaller quark masses",
    "the explicit @xmath105 symmetry breaking likely grows and expected to be maximal in the chiral limit .",
    "so for smaller quark masses , i.e in the chiral limit one should rather consider the effect of the explicit breaking of the @xmath105 symmetry .",
    "the effects of explicit symmetry breaking discussed in this work should not be restricted to the explicit breaking of the @xmath0 symmetry . for 2-flavor and 2-color qcd",
    "the deconfinement transition in the large quark mass region may have the effects coming from the explicit breaking of the chiral symmetry .",
    "it may be possible that this effect change the phase transition behavior of the deconfinement transition in the heavy quark mass region .",
