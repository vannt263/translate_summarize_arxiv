    "the discoveries of c@xmath0 fullerene by kroto and co - workers in 1985 @xcite and carbon nanotubes ( cnts ) by iijima in 1991 @xcite , following a preliminary carbon filamentous growth work @xcite , have opened up a new scientific revolution for nanotechnology . since then",
    ", an enormous amount of research has been performed on representative carbon nanomaterials , notably single - wall carbon nanotubes ( swcnts ) , discovered in 1993 @xcite , and graphene , first isolated in 2004 @xcite . not only attracting much attention for future applications in microscale and nanoscale optoelectronic devices , these carbon nanomaterials are stimulating much interest from a fundamental point of view , considered to be one of the most ideal systems that exhibit the quantum mechanical nature of interacting low - dimensional electrons .    while initial investigations on these materials concentrated on dc characteristics , recent theoretical studies have instigated a flurry of new experimental activities to uncover unusual ac properties .",
    "both swcnts and graphene are expected to show exotic terahertz ( thz ) dynamics that can lead to innovative optoelectronic applications  @xcite .",
    "these properties are inherently related to their unique , low - dimensional band structure , combined with many - body interactions of quantum - confined carriers .    from a fundamental point of view",
    ", dynamic ( or optical or ac ) conductivity @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the ( angular ) frequency of the applied electric field , is expected to provide a wealth of information on quantum confinement , electron interactions , and disorder . for one - dimensional ( 1-d ) electron systems such as swcnts ,",
    "there have been detailed theoretical calculations of @xmath1 , taking into account interactions and disorder to varying degrees ( see , e.g. , @xcite and pp .",
    "219 - 237 of @xcite ) . for a metallic swcnt , for example , ando  @xcite calculated @xmath1 within a self - consistent born approximation , which indicated that there can exist non - drude - like conductivity , depending on the range of scattering potentials .",
    "one particularly important question for metallic swcnts is whether the optical conductivity satisfies the so - called @xmath3 scaling , i.e. , the frequency dependence appears only through a particular combination of @xmath2 and @xmath4 , i.e. , @xmath3  @xcite , where @xmath4 is the sample temperature .",
    "this implies that the system is at a quantum critical point  @xcite .",
    "a tomonaga - luttinger liquid has the characteristic feature that it is quantum critical over a finite range of parameters due to enhanced quantum fluctuations in 1-d ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , and thus , is expected to exhibit a @xmath5 scaling law in conductivity .    a number of experimental thz / far - infrared spectroscopic studies have been performed over the last decade on swcnts of various forms  @xcite , producing an array of conflicting results with contradicting interpretations .",
    "this is partly due to the widely differing types of samples used in these studies  grown by different methods ( hipco , comocat , cvd , arc discharge , and laser ablation ) and put in a variety of polymer films that are transparent in the thz range .",
    "nanotubes in most of these samples were bundled and typically consisted of a mixture of semiconducting and metallic nanotubes with a wide distribution of diameters .",
    "some of the samples used were partially aligned through mechanical stretching , showing some degree of anisotropy in their thz response @xcite .",
    "one common spectral feature that many groups have detected is a broad absorption peak around 4  thz ( or 135  @xmath6 or @xmath717  mev ) .",
    "this feature , first observed by ugawa _",
    "et al_.  @xcite , has been interpreted as interband absorption in mod-3 non - armchair nanotubes with curvature - induced gaps  @xcite or absorption due to plasmon oscillations along the tube axis  @xcite , but a consensus has not achieved  @xcite .",
    "the ac dynamics of dirac fermions in graphene have attracted much theoretical attention  the influence of linear dispersions , two - dimensionality , and disorder has been extensively discussed by many theorists  @xcite . however , the influence of electron - electron interactions on the optical conductivity of graphene is somewhat controversial .",
    "theoretical studies using different methods have led to different conclusions as to the magnitude of many - body corrections to the drude - like intraband optical conductivity ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite and references cited therein ) . experimentally , while a number of studies have confirmed the so - called universal optical conductivity @xmath8 for _ interband _ transitions in a wide spectra range  @xcite , successful experimental studies of the _ intraband _ conductivity have been very limited  @xcite , except for cyclotron resonance measurements in magnetic fields  @xcite . on the other hand , theoretical studies on _ nonlinear and non - equilibrium properties _ of graphene have emerged in recent years , urging further experiments to be done using time - resolved and/or nonlinear optical spectroscopy . for example ,",
    "mikhailov and ziegler  @xcite , using a semiclassical approximation , have shown that dirac fermions in graphene with a dispersion @xmath9(@xmath10 ) = @xmath11@xmath12@xmath10@xmath12 ( where @xmath11 is the fermi velocity ) in the presence of an applied ac electric field @xmath13(@xmath14 ) = @xmath15@xmath16@xmath17 would produce an ac current @xmath18 _ within linear response_. note that not only does the current oscillate at the frequency of the applied field @xmath2 , but it also contains all the odd harmonics .",
    "this should be contrasted to conventional semiconductors such as gaas , which , within linear response , will only produce an ac current with frequency @xmath2 , i.e. , @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the effective mass .",
    "therefore , the dynamics of graphene in an ac electric field are intrinsically nonlinear , and efficient frequency multiplications for thz generation can be expected for microwave - driven graphene .    another outstanding theoretical prediction is thz amplification in optically pumped graphene  @xcite .",
    "ryzhii and co - workers calculated the dynamic conductivity of a non - equilibrium 2d electron - hole system in graphene under interband optical excitation .",
    "both interband and intraband transitions were taken into account in their model . under optical pumping with photon energy @xmath21@xmath22",
    ", electrons and holes are photogenerated with energy @xmath23 = @xmath24/2 and emit a cascade of optical phonons with energy @xmath25 , leading to population accumulation of the bottom of the conduction band ( by electrons ) and the top of the valence band ( by holes ) , as shown in fig .",
    "[ ryzhiijap ] .",
    "they demonstrated that sufficiently strong optical pumping will result in population inversion , making the real part of the net ac conductivity negative , i.e. , amplification .",
    "due to the gapless energy spectrum , this negative ac conductivity takes place in the range of thz frequencies .",
    "this effect might be used in graphene - based coherent sources for thz radiation .",
    "the 1-d character of confined carriers in swcnts manifests itself as strong anisotropy in electric , magnetic , and optical properties  @xcite .",
    "individual metallic swcnts have been shown to be excellent 1-d electrical conductors with very long coherence lengths @xcite , while individual semiconducting swcnts have been shown to absorb and emit light only when the light polarization is parallel to the tube axis @xcite . moreover ,",
    "individualized swcnts , both metallic and semiconducting , have been shown to align well in an external magnetic field @xcite due to their anisotropic magnetic susceptibilities @xcite , and aligned swcnts exhibit strong linear dichroism due to their anisotropic optical properties . even in bundled samples where swcnts form aggregates through van der waals attraction ,",
    "their anisotropic properties are expected to be preserved to a large degree , even though systematic optical spectroscopy studies have been limited @xcite due to the rarity of ensemble samples in which the swcnts are highly aligned .    here",
    ", we describe results of polarization - dependent thz transmission measurements on films of macroscopically - aligned swcnts , which demonstrate an extremely high degree of anisotropy  @xcite .",
    "strikingly , when the thz polarization is perpendicular to the nanotube alignment direction , practically no absorption is observed despite the macroscopic thickness of the film . on the other hand ,",
    "when the polarization is parallel to the alignment direction , there is strong absorption .",
    "the degree of polarization in terms of absorbance is 1 and the reduced linear dichroism is 3 , throughout the entire frequency range of our experiment ( 0.1 - 2.2 thz ) . using the theory of linear dichroism for an ensemble of anisotropic molecules  @xcite , we show that this value of reduced dichroism ( i.e. , 3 ) is possible only when the nematic order parameter ( @xmath26 ) is 1 .",
    "these observations are a direct result of the 1-d nature of conduction electrons in the nanotubes and at the same time demonstrate that any misalignment of nanotubes in the film must have characteristic length scales much smaller than the wavelengths used in these experiments ( 1.5  mm to 150  @xmath27 m ) .    these results on aligned swcnts , as well as a recent report by kyoung _",
    "et al_.  on aligned multi - wall cnts  @xcite , indeed suggest that aligned cnt films perform as ideal linear polarizers in the thz frequency range . these aligned films ( or stacks of films",
    "@xcite ) exhibit comparable performance to commercial wire - grid technology but have added benefits of ( i ) broadband thz absorption driven by the inherent 1-d character of the cnts and ( ii ) mechanical robustness in diverse operation conditions .",
    "namely , in comparison to wire - grid technology , the thz performance of these materials is driven not by the precise structure of the conductive wires but rather the inherent anisotropic thz absorption properties of aligned cnts .",
    "the aligned swcnt films studied were produced by natural self - assembly of swcnts into densely packed and highly aligned macroscopic materials during synthesis . utilizing optical lithography to define the pitch between lines of catalyst ,",
    "water - assisted chemical vapor deposition was employed to grow aligned swcnts in high aspect - ratio lines .",
    "following growth , the lines were transferred to a sapphire or silicon substrate to produce a thz polarizer  @xcite .",
    "to optimize the device performance with respect to extinction , multiple layers were stacked until full extinction of linearly polarized thz radiation was achieved in a configuration where the thz field is parallel to the alignment .",
    "the benefit of this approach compared to other possible approaches is the simplicity of the contact - transfer process that makes this scalable to large areas .",
    "there are no known limitations in this approach that would inhibit scaling to full wafers or even continuous roll - to - roll growth and contact transfer techniques to yield high - throughput production of thz devices .",
    "the thz - tds system used a ti : sapphire femtosecond laser that excited either a znte crystal or a photoconductive antenna to generate and detect coherent thz radiation .",
    "the sample was positioned at the thz focus and was rotated about the propagation direction of the thz beam , which changed the angle , @xmath28 , between the nanotube axis and the thz polarization direction from 0@xmath29 to 90@xmath29 , as shown in fig  [ swntsthzpolarizer ] .",
    "more details about the experimental setup are described elsewhere  @xcite . with an intrinsic silicon substrate , which is transparent in almost the entire infrared ( ir ) range , we were also able to perform similar polarization - dependent transmission measurements using fourier transform infrared ( ftir ) spectroscopy .",
    "figure  [ swntsthzpolarizer ] shows transmitted time - domain waveforms for four different angles ( @xmath28 = 0@xmath29 , 30@xmath29 , 45@xmath29 , and 90@xmath29 ) between the thz polarization direction and the cnt alignment direction , together with the waveform transmitted through a reference sapphire substrate with no nanotubes .",
    "note that the 90-degree trace precisely coincides with the reference waveform , which means that there is no attenuation for this thz polarization ( perpendicular to the tubes ) . from the measured absorption anisotropy , we calculated the reduced linear dichrosim to be 3 , corresponding to a nematic order parameter of 1  @xcite .",
    "this result suggests that any misalignment of nanotubes in the film is negligible compared to the wavelengths used in these experiments ( 1.5  mm @xmath30 150  @xmath27 m ) .    in order to optimize the device performance with respect to extinction ,",
    "multiple layers were stacked in parallel with each other , as shown in fig .",
    "[ swntsfilmstacks ] , until full extinction of linearly polarized thz radiation was achieved in a configuration where the thz field is parallel to the alignment . to elucidate polarizer performance , we calculated the degree of polarization ( dop ) , defined as dop = ( @xmath31)/(@xmath32 ) , and the extinction ratio ( er ) , defined as er = @xmath33/@xmath34 , where @xmath33 is the transmittance for the parallel case , and @xmath34 is the transmittance for the perpendicular case . as shown in fig .",
    "[ swntsstacksdoper](a ) , the dop value of our swcnts polarizer increases with the swcnts film thickness and reaches a value at 99.9@xmath35 throughout the whole measured frequency range for a triple - stacked film .",
    "figure  [ swntsstacksdoper](b ) indicates that the er value is increasing dramatically with the film thickness , achieving an average value of 33.4  db in the 0.2@xmath302.2  thz range  two orders of magnitude better than the thinner swcnt films .",
    "these results demonstrate the remarkable utility of aligned swcnts for thz applications .",
    "we fourier - transformed the time - domain data of the single highly aligned swcnt thin film shown in fig .",
    "[ swntsthzpolarizer ] into the frequency domain and extracted the parallel and perpendicular elements of the the dynamic complex conductivity tensor @xmath36 , i.e. , @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively , as shown in fig .",
    "[ condtensor ] .",
    "highly anisotropic responses are again observed . at 90@xmath29 ( thz polarization perpendicular to the nanotube axis ) ,",
    "the real part of the conductivity is zero throughout the entire frequency range , showing no sign of absorption .",
    "in contrast , at 0@xmath29 ( thz polarization parallel to the nanotube axis ) the conductivity is finite and reaches @xmath7140  s@xmath39@xmath6 at 1.8  thz .",
    "note that the real part monotonically increases with increasing frequency in this frequency range .",
    "this is consistent with the existence of a peak at a higher frequency , as observed by many other groups on various types of swcnts , as discussed previously and shown in fig .",
    "[ 4thz - peak ] .",
    "the results shown here unambiguously demonstrate that such a finite - frequency peak appears only in the parallel component of the dynamic conductivity tensor .",
    "graphene has been intensively studied since its first isolation in 2004  @xcite .",
    "this zero - gap semiconductor consisting of a single layer of @xmath40-bonded carbon atoms arranged into a 2-d honeycomb lattice possesses a photon - like , linear energy dispersion , which is expected to lead to exceptionally nonlinear electro - dynamic properties  @xcite .",
    "since both intraband and interband transitions in graphene are expected to be sensitive to the location of the fermi energy , ac studies with tunable carrier concentration would provide significant new insights into the dynamics of 2-d dirac fermions .",
    "the fermi level can be tuned either by doping or gating .",
    "substitution of carbon atoms in graphene by nitrogen and boron have been attempted , but this dramatically decreases the mobility by breaking its lattice structure .",
    "physically adsorbed molecules can also dope graphene , but this is not stable and leads to a suppression of mobility as well . so far , applying a controllable gate voltage to graphene to transfer carriers from the doped silicon substrate is still the most common and reliable way . by utilizing applied gate voltages ,",
    "different groups have observed tunable interband optical transitions  @xcite , tunable intraband far - infrared conductivity  @xcite , and a systematic g - band change with gate voltage in raman spectra  @xcite .    here , we describe our thz and ir study of _ large - area _ ( centimeter scale ) graphene with an electrically tunable fermi level ( @xmath41 ) . in a field effect transistor consisting of graphene on a sio@xmath42/@xmath43-si substrate , the intensity of the transmitted thz electromagnetic wave was observed to change with the gate voltage .",
    "both the drude - like intraband conductivities and the ` 2@xmath41 onset ' of the interband transitions , monitored through thz time - domain spectroscpy and fourier - transform infrared spectroscopy , respectively , were both modulated by the gate voltage .",
