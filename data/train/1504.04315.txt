    "the transverse focusing lattice is one of the few crucial subsystems in modern accelerators and storage rings .",
    "most contemporary accelerators and storage rings are designed based on an uncoupled linear transverse lattice @xcite , where the two degrees of freedom in the transverse directions are decoupled .",
    "well - known analyses of the effects of weak coupling on stability properties have left the incorrect impression that the coupling between the @xmath0-dynamics and @xmath1-dynamics always results in instabilities or other deleterious effects .",
    "it has been realized recently that coupled lattices are not necessarily more unstable than uncoupled lattices . on the contrary",
    ", it is believed that coupled lattice can be more advantageous in comparison with conventional uncoupled lattices , especially for high - intensity charged particle beams @xcite .",
    "this is because the parameter space for coupled lattices is much larger than that for uncoupled lattices , and one can explore the larger parameter space for a coupled lattice to optimize the lattice design .",
    "of course , the most important consideration in lattice design is its stability properties .",
    "a thorough study of lattice stability requires one to distinguish two types of stability properties , spectral stability and structural stability @xcite .",
    "the spectral stability of a linear periodic lattice is determined by the eigenvalues of the one - period map @xmath2 of the lattice . if there exists a vector @xmath3 such that @xmath4 as @xmath5 ,",
    "then the map is spectrally unstable . otherwise , it is spectrally stable .",
    "this is the most familiar stability property that is often analyzed .",
    "the structural stability of the lattice refers to the robustness of the spectral stability property of the lattice with respect to a structural perturbation , such as imperfections in the magnets , or misalignment of the beam - line .",
    "a lattice is structurally unstable if there exists a spectrally unstable lattice infinitesimally close - by .",
    "otherwise , it is structurally stable .    unfortunately , our understanding of the stability properties of coupled lattices is far from comprehensive due to the lack of an effective mathematical tool to describe the coupled dynamics . for 1d uncoupled dynamics ,",
    "the _ de facto _ standard for parameterizing the focusing lattice is the courant - snyder ( cs ) theory @xcite , which is mathematically elegant and directly linked to the physics of the beam dynamics . for coupled lattices , several parameterization schemes",
    "have been developed @xcite .",
    "but none of these schemes is as effective for coupled lattices as the cs theory is for uncoupled lattices .",
    "recently , we have developed a generalized courant - snyder theory for coupled lattices @xcite , which generalizes every important aspect of the original cs theory to higher dimensions .",
    "especially , the key components of the original cs theory , i.e. , the envelope function ( or the @xmath6 function ) and the associated envelope equation are generalized into a matrix envelope function and the associated matrix envelope equation .    in the present study",
    ", we apply the generalized cs theory to investigate the stability properties of coupled lattices .",
    "we prove an important proposition that a necessary condition for a periodic coupled lattice to be spectrally and structurally stable is that the generalized matrix envelope equation admits a matched solution .",
    "we also show how to apply the techniques of pre - iwasawa decomposition @xcite and normal form to construct a matched solution of the matrix envelope equation by simply solving the initial value problem once .",
    "this new method is of great value even for uncoupled lattices .",
    "previously , one used the conventional shooting method to solve the initial value problem many times to search for a matched solution . using the example of a continuously rotating quadrupole lattice , we illustrate in this paper how the lattice becomes spectrally unstable through an interesting process called the krein collision .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec.[sec : hamiltonian ] , we describe the spectral and structural stability properties of a generic linear periodic hamiltonian system and the associated krein collision .",
    "the generalized courant - snyder theory for coupled lattices is introduced in sec.[sec : gcs ] , and the connection between stability properties and matched lattice functions are discussed in sec[sec : stability - analysis ] .",
    "the formalism developed is applied to study the stability properties of a continuously rotating quadrupole lattice in sec.[sec : crq ] .",
    "the dynamics of a charged particle in a coupled or uncoupled periodic focusing system is completely specified by the one - period map . because of the hamiltonian nature of the dynamics , the one - period map is symplectic . for the linear focusing lattices considered in the present study ,",
    "the one - period map is specified by a symplectic matrix @xmath2 . in this section ,",
    "we discuss the stability properties of @xmath2 as a general symplectic matrix .",
    "the calculation and stability analysis of @xmath2 for a specific choice of focusing lattice will be discussed in secs.[sec : gcs ] and [ sec : stability - analysis ] using the generalized courant - snyder theory .",
    "let the dimension of @xmath2 be @xmath7 , and let @xmath8 be the eigenvalues of @xmath9 it is straightforward to prove that if @xmath10 is an eigenvalue of a symplectic matrix , then its inverse @xmath11 and its complex conjugate @xmath12 are also eigenvalues .",
    "then , the eigenvalue distribution can be divided into four categories :    : :    all eigenvalues are distinct and on the unit circle of the complex    plane , i.e. , @xmath13 and    @xmath14 for @xmath15 : :    all eigenvalues are on the unit circle",
    ". there are repeated    eigenvalues .",
    "but the geometric multiplicity for all eigenvalues are    the same as the algebraic multiplicity , i.e. ,    @xmath16 for all    @xmath17 : :    all eigenvalues are on the unit circle .",
    "there are repeated eigenvalues    with algebraic multiplicity greater than geometric multiplicity , i.e. ,    @xmath18 for some    @xmath17 : :    there exits at least one eigenvalue not on the unit circle , i.e. ,    @xmath19 for some @xmath17    here , an eigenvalue@xmath20 of @xmath2 is a root of the characteristic polynomial @xmath21 , and the algebraic multiplicity of an eigenvalue @xmath22 is the order of the root .",
    "the geometric multiplicity of an eigenvalue @xmath23 is the number of independent eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalue . in general ,",
    "according to the basic theory of linear algebra , cases ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) are spectrally stable , and cases ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) are spectrally unstable . for cases ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , we would like to know whether their spectral stability will be sustained under a small structural perturbation .",
    "case ( 1 ) can also be shown to be structurally stable by considering the symplectic nature of @xmath9 as the structure of the system is perturbed , the eigenvalues will move accordingly .",
    "however , they can not move off the unit circle due to a small structural perturbation on @xmath2 for case ( 1 ) .",
    "this is because for every eigenvalue @xmath10 off the circle , there exits another eigenvaule @xmath25 , which is on the opposite side of the unit circle .",
    "if one of the eigenvalues of case ( 1 ) were allowed to move off the unit circle , then there would be more than @xmath26 eigenvalues .",
    "this forbidden situation is illustrated in fig.[forbidden ] for @xmath27 .",
    "when there are repeated eigenvalues for case ( 2 ) , the constraints on the locations of the eigenvalues do not prohibit the eigenvalues moving off the unit circle due to structural perturbations , which is the so - called krein collision @xcite , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ krein ] for @xmath28 krein collisions preserve the symmetry of the eigenvalue distribution with respect to the real axis and the unit circle , and are the only possible pathways in parameter space for a spectrally stable system to become spectrally unstable .",
    "when this happens , the system is structurally unstable .",
    "what is more interesting is that not all possibilities in case ( 2 ) are structurally unstable .",
    "case ( 2 ) needs to be further divided into two sub - categories :    00.00.0000    for all repeated eigenvalues , the corresponding eigenvectors have the same signatures .",

    "for practical applications of coupled lattices , it is desirable to design a coupled lattice belongs to cases ( 1 ) and ( 2.1 ) , which are both spectrally and structurally stable . as mentioned previously , the parameter space satisfying this condition for a coupled lattice is larger than that for an uncoupled lattice .",
    "the generalized courant - snyder theory described in sec.[sec : gcs ] provides an effective tool to study the stability properties of coupled lattices .",
    "one of the important result is that if a matched solution for @xmath6 exists , then the stability property of a general coupled lattice is completely determined by the phase advance matrix @xmath89 . using a matched solution for @xmath79 the one - period map is @xmath90 which indicates that @xmath91 is similar to the inverse of the phase advance @xmath92 , and thus has the same eigenvalues and multiplicity as @xmath92 . because @xmath92 is a rotation , its eigenvalues are on the unit circle .",

    "on the other hand , if an unmatched @xmath6 solution is used , the @xmath6 function and other lattice functions have to be solved in the entire time domain of @xmath97 does a matched @xmath6 solution always exist ?",
    "the answer is negative .",
    "what are the conditions for the existence of a match @xmath6 solution ?",
    "we prove now that for cases ( 1 ) and ( 2.1 ) , eq .",
    "admits matched solution for @xmath98 the proof utilizes the technique of normal form and pre - iwasawa decomposition @xcite for symplectic matrices .",
    "first , let s invoke the established result that for case ( 1 ) , @xmath2 can always be transformed into the following normal form with a symplectic matrix @xmath99 @xmath100 obviously , @xmath101 is a symplectic rotation .",
    "this fact is proved @xcite from the existence of a complete set of @xmath26 orthonormal eigenvectors @xmath102 , satisfying @xmath103 here , @xmath104 and @xmath105 are a pair of eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalues @xmath20 and @xmath106 , respectively .",
    "equations and state that @xmath104 and @xmath107 have different signatures . the normal form is actually explicitly constructed .",
    "the transfer matrix @xmath108 is given as @xcite @xmath109 where @xmath110 and @xmath111 are real and imaginary components of the eigenvector @xmath104 , i.e. , @xmath112    we now show that for case ( 2.1 ) , such a set of orthonormal bases exists as well . for a repeated eigenvector @xmath10 with @xmath113 ,",
    "the corresponding eigenvectors span a subspace @xmath114 of @xmath115 because the signature never vanishes in @xmath116 we can always select a set of orthonormal bases for @xmath114 through a gram - schmidt process .",
    "the subspace @xmath117 , a complex conjugate image of @xmath114 , has the same structure except that the signature has the opposite sign .",
    "therefore , for both case ( 1 ) and case ( 2.1 ) , the normal form given by eq . exists .",
    "second , we apply the pre - iwasawa decomposition to the symplectic matrix @xmath118 according to the theory of iwasawa decomposition @xcite , a symplectic matrix @xmath119 can always be uniquely factored as @xmath120 where @xmath121 is a symplectic rotation , and @xmath122 and @xmath123 are symmetric .",
    "the statement is true as well if the decomposition is defined alternatively to be @xmath124    let the unique pre - iwasawa decomposition of @xmath108 be @xmath125 then , the transfer matrix is @xmath126 we choose the initial conditions for @xmath6 and @xmath81 such that @xmath127 and the solution of @xmath6 will give the same transfer map @xmath128 thus @xmath129 the uniqueness of pre - iwasawa decomposition requires that @xmath130 equations and prove that @xmath131 , i.e. , the @xmath6 solution is matched .",
    "thus we have proven the proposition that for cases ( 1 ) and ( 2.1 ) , eq . admits matched solutions .",
    "this proof is a constructive one , which can be used as an effective method to find a matched solution for @xmath6 .",
    "the conventional method for finding matched solutions is the shooting method , where one takes an initial condition for @xmath6 and solves the ordinary differential equation once in one period . in general , the solution is not matched , i.e. , @xmath132 or @xmath133 the shooting method requires one to estimate a better initial condition based on the size of the mismatch , and solve the differential equation again .",
    "this iteration is carried out many times until a matched solution is found .",
    "the new method suggested by the above constructive proof of the existence of matched solution only requires solving eq . once with an arbitrary initial condition .",
    "we can construct the one - period map @xmath91 using any matched or unmatched solution of eq . , then the eigenvectors of @xmath91 can be calculated . when the set of bases satisfying eqs.- exists , the initial condition for a matched solution is uniquely given by eq",
    "this new method applies to both 1d uncoupled lattices and coupled lattices in higher dimensions .",
    "of course , this procedure fails when the set of bases satisfying eqs.- does not exist .",
    "however , for the desirable cases ( 1 ) and ( 2.1 ) , such a set of bases exists .",
    "another practical implication of the existence of matched @xmath6 solution is that when an matched solution for @xmath6 can not be found , the lattice must be unstable .",
    "as an illustrative application of the theoretical formalism developed in secs.[sec : gcs ] and [ sec : stability - analysis ] , we investigate here the stability properties of a continuously rotating quadrupole lattice @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian of a charged particle in such a lattice is @xcite @xmath134 we will smoothly vary @xmath135 and observe the movement of the eigenvalues of the one - period map . for a given value of @xmath135 , we find a matched @xmath6 solution using the procedure described above .",
    "the calculation is carried out using a code developed in ref.@xcite .",
    "the matched @xmath6 solutions for the cases of @xmath136 and @xmath137 are plotted in fig.[ms ] .",
    "the eigenvalue distributions for different values of @xmath135 are plotted in fig.[rq ] . for @xmath136 and @xmath137",
    ", it belongs to case ( 1 ) .",
    "the two eigenvalues on the left half circle have different signatures , and move towards one another as @xmath135 increases . at @xmath138 , these two eigenvalues collide at @xmath139 since their signatures are different , this is an unstable krein collision and thus structurally unstable . right after the collision at @xmath140 ,",
    "these two eigenvalues moves off the unit circle , and lead to an unstable lattice .",

    "these analyses can be straightforwardly carried out for any coupled lattice , such as the n - rolling lattice @xcite and the mbius accelerator @xcite .",
