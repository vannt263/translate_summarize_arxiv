    "the most general  minimal \" low - energy supersymmetric model , , the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model ( mssm ) has more than 20 free parameters , and therefore experimental tests and constraints are impractical to implement .",
    "one needs further theoretical input to test / constrain  sensible \" models of low - energy supersymmetry .",
    "one promising avenue consists of invoking models for physics at very high energies ( for a recent review see @xcite ) :    * grand unification , provides gauge and yukawa coupling relations , as well as gaugino mass relations .",
    "* supergravity , allows the calculation of the soft supersymmetry breaking parameters in terms of the khler function ( @xmath6 ) and the gauge kinetic function ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "these constraints lead to four - parameter models .",
    "* superstrings , provide specific forms for @xmath6 and @xmath7 , and in principle reduce the number of free parameters to _",

    "generic \" supergravity model described by the mssm matter content , gauge coupling unification at @xmath8 , a universal gaugino mass ( @xmath9 ) , a universal scalar mass ( @xmath10 ) , a universal scalar coupling ( @xmath11 ) , and at low energies @xmath12 .",
    "the radiative electroweak breaking mechanism allows the determination of @xmath13 , and the parameter space is four dimensional ( plus the sign of @xmath14 ) .",
    "further constraints can reduce the dimension of the parameter space , like yukawa coupling unification which determines @xmath12 for a given value of @xmath15 .",
    "more  modern \" features have been recently incorporated in the study of supergravity models , such as string unification at @xmath16 , simple string models ( , @xmath17 ) , and calculable values of the ratios @xmath18 and @xmath19 . in this case",
    "the four - parameter models become two - parameter models . moreover , in specific string models one can also calculate the ratios of @xmath14 and @xmath20 to @xmath9 , which lead to _ zero - parameter _ models ! it is also found that the soft supersymmetry breaking terms are not necessarily universal .    at this point",
    "one can say that  generic \" supergravity models provide a sensible  standard \" parametrization for comparisons of various tests / constraints .",
    "however ,  modern \" ingredients have subtle effects in the sparticle spectrum , which sometimes produce new twists not present in  generic \" models .",
    "in fact , string model - building will likely soon provide a new  standard \" parametrization , with novel / testable effects .",
    "we do not consider theoretical constraints ( , gauge / yukawa unification , doublet - triplet splitting , fixed points , etc . ) . with few - parameter models in hand , one can run the whole gamut of tests and produce an array of experimental predictions .",
    "_ caution _ : hidden assumptions make some constraints not as strong as others ( , detection of dark matter assumes there is enough in the halo to be detectable ) . also , some constraints / tests are sensitive to a small subset of sparticle spectrum , whereas others test the  scale of supersymmetry \" .",
    "as expected , the largest effects occur for the lightest sparticle masses , but the  reach \" depends on the process and its experimental sensitivity .",

    "+ @xmath38 measurement of @xmath77 at the tevatron would not be as good as direct @xmath78 detection @xcite .",
    "this process has been observed at cleo : @xmath79 at 95% cl .",
    "there are various dominant contributions written schematically as @xmath80 ^ 2\\ ] ] because of the chargino contribution , @xmath81 can be larger or smaller than the standard model prediction . qcd corrections are large , and a complete two - loop calculation is required to settle the scale ( @xmath82 ) uncertainty , which can be estimated by varying the scale @xmath83 . taking the theoretical calculations at face value , large values of @xmath12",
    "appear disfavored , at least for one sign of @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "the last measurement of @xmath84 , , @xmath85 dates back to 1970 . the latest standard model prediction is @xmath86 .",
    "thus , at the 95%cl we can tolerate a new contribution in the range @xmath87 . in 1996",
    "the new brookhaven e821 experiment will start running with an expected sensitivity of @xmath88 , which is adequate to observe the electroweak contribution ( @xmath89 ) .",
    "a difficulty in this test is that the hadronic uncertainty in the standard model prediction is of a similar magnitude , although experiments at novosibirsk should reduce this uncertainty considerably .",
    "such impasse should be of no consequence to tests of supersymmetric models , since their predictions can easily exceed the present allowed interval @xcite .",
    "the prediction for the proton lifetime depends strongly on the gut group . in the case of @xmath90 , dimension - six operators",
    "are mediated by @xmath91 gauge bosons and the largest mode is @xmath92 , with @xmath93 , which is basically unobservable , although it implies @xmath94 . more important",
    "are the dimension - five operators , which need to be dressed by a chargino loop .",
    "the largest contribution comes from ckm mixing with the second generation , and the largest mode is @xmath95 .",
    "schematically one has @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the higgs triplet mass , @xmath7 is the one - loop dressing function ( @xmath98 , , heavy squarks , light charginos are preferred ) , and @xmath99 gives the ratio of 3rd/2nd generation contributions to the dressing . requiring @xmath100 , one finds for @xmath101 : @xmath102 and @xmath103 @xcite .",
    "moreover , the relic density cosmological constraint requires @xmath104 , since one needs to be near the @xmath105 annihilation poles @xcite .",
    "conservation of @xmath106-parity in supergravity models implies the existence of a stable lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) , which corresponds to the lightest neutralino ( @xmath107 ) .",
    "the relic abundance @xmath108 can be computed from the pair - annihilation amplitude , and depends on all supersymmetry parameters , with more accurate methods needed near @xmath109-channel poles .",
    "if one requires a universe at least 10 gyr old , one must demand @xmath110 ( in a pure cold dark matter universe ) .",
    "one can also consider various structure formation models , such as the cold plus hot dark matter model ( chdm ) with @xmath111 and @xmath112 , or the cosmological constant model ( cc ) with @xmath113 and @xmath114 . with a given value for the hubble parameter , such as @xmath115 from the hubble space telescope , one can obtain ranges for @xmath108 which can be contrasted with the predictions of specific supergravity models ( see fig .",
    "[ dm ] @xcite ) .",
    "neutralino scattering off nuclei in cryogenic detectors is a promising avenue to detect the lsp , especially in view of the new generation of detectors coming on line ( the ge detector at stanford ) or in development stage @xcite .",
    "it is important to keep in mind that since @xmath116 , one requires @xmath117 to get the  full load \" of lsps , otherwise the neutralino halo density should be scaled down . in fig .",
    "[ dm ] we show typical rates ( @xmath106 ) for the ge detector @xcite , where the depletion of lsps near the @xmath28 and @xmath118 poles is evident .",
    "we also note that experimentally excluded values for @xmath119 happen sometimes for interestingly large values of @xmath106 @xcite .",
    "neutralinos can also be captured by the sun or earth and then pair annihilate producing eventually high - energy neutrinos which can be detected in a growing number of under ground / water / ice detectors such as kamiokande , macro , dumand , amanda , nestor .",
    "this detection technique is competitive with the direct one @xcite .",
    "given a few - parameter supergravity model one can combine all the above constraints to determine the still - allowed region of parameter space to be further explored at the tevatron , lepii , and the lhc , or through the rare processes and indirect detection methods surveyed above @xcite .",
    "we conclude by remarking that supergravity models are well motivated few - parameter low - energy supersymmetric models , in which experimental constraints can be enforced and testable predictions can be worked out in detail .",
    "experimentalists like them because they are  easy targets \" to kill or severely damage .",
    "the procedure described above will need to be applied to the better motivated models for the soft breaking parameters which are just emerging from superstring model building .",
