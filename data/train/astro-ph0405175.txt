    "observations show that the solar p - mode frequencies vary with the solar cycle , and the change in frequency correlates with magnetic activities .",
    "the previous study suggests that the measured frequency change is caused by the change in physical conditions near the surface @xcite , and no evidence of solar - cycle variations of physical conditions deep in the solar interior has been found from the measured frequencies @xcite .",
    "it is expected that the perturbation in the solar interior have a rather small contribution to the frequency change , if it exists , because of small @xmath0 .",
    "it is also reasonable to expect , based on the current dynamo theories , that the second largest contribution to the frequency change is from the perturbation near the base of the convection zone ( bcz ) .",
    "a perturbation near the bcz would modify the frequencies of different modes in different ways : the frequencies of the modes which can penetrate into the bcz would change , while the modes which can not penetrate into the bcz would remain intact .",
    "the penetration depth ( lower turning point ) of a mode is determined by the horizontal angular phase velocity @xmath1 @xmath2^{1/2})$ ] , where @xmath3 is the angular frequency and @xmath4 the mode degree .",
    "thus the contribution of the bcz perturbation to the frequency change depends on @xmath1 . here",
    "we present the evidence that the @xmath1 dependence of smoothed scaled relative frequency change , @xmath5 , varies with the solar cycle at large @xmath1 , while remains constant at small @xmath1 , where @xmath6 is the frequency change and @xmath7 the mode mass .    to search for the contribution of the near - bcz perturbation to the frequency change",
    ", we have to remove the contributions of the near - surface perturbation , which is much greater than that of the bcz perturbation . in this study",
    "we adopt a method similar to one developed by di mauro et al .",
    "( 2002 ) to remove the near - surface contributions to solar - cycle variations of frequencies .",
    "this method was originally developed to remove the contributions of uncertainties near the surface in solar models to the p - mode frequencies .",
    "here we use it to remove the contributions of the near - surface perturbation caused by solar activities .",
    "in the asymptotic theory , the frequency change @xmath6 , due to sound - speed perturbations can be expressed as @xcite @xmath8 where @xmath9 is approximately proportional to the mode mass @xmath7 . in this study",
    "we replace @xmath9 by @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the mode mass for mode @xmath12 and @xmath13 . in equation ( [ eq : h1234-a ] ) ,",
    "@xmath14 is from the perturbations in the whole sun , while @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 , are caused only by the near - surface perturbation . among the near - surface terms , @xmath18 ,",
    "is the lowest order term .",
    "it depends on frequency only , and could be expressed as @xcite @xmath19 where @xmath20 are the legendre polynomials , and @xmath21 is the frequency scaled to be in the interval @xmath22 $ ] for the modes considered .",
    "the third and fourth terms , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , are one order higher than @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "they are functions of @xmath23 and @xmath1 , and can be expressed as @xcite @xmath24    the first term in equation ( [ eq : h1234-a ] ) , @xmath14 , is from the perturbations in the whole sun .",
    "it is a function of @xmath1 only , and can be expressed as an integral @xcite @xmath25 where @xmath26 is determined by @xmath27 .",
    "the largest contribution to @xmath14 is from the near - surface perturbation .",
    "the second largest contribution is expected from the perturbation near the bcz . here",
    "we define a critical horizontal phase velocity @xmath28 such that the modes with @xmath29 are not affected by the bcz perturbation , while the modes with @xmath30 are affected by the bcz perturbation in the ray theory .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that the only non - negligible contribution to @xmath14 for the modes with @xmath29 is from the near - surface perturbation .",
    "if the near - surface perturbation is located within a thin layer at @xmath31 , from equation ( [ eq : h1-a ] ) @xmath14 can be approximated by @xmath32 where @xmath33 , and @xmath34 .",
    "the perturbation near the bcz has a contribution to @xmath35 only for the range of @xmath30 through @xmath14 . in the following analysis , we limit our study in a range of @xmath36 mhz and @xmath37 , where @xmath1 is computed with frequency in units of @xmath38hz . for this range , @xmath39 , if @xmath40 .",
    "thus @xmath41 from the near - surface perturbation can be further approximated by @xmath42 the contributions from the near - surface perturbation can be expressed as @xmath43_{\\rm{surf } } = a_1^{(1 ) } + a_2^{(1 ) } \\frac{1}{w^2 } + \\sum_{i=1}^{m } a_i^{(2 ) } p_i(\\tilde{\\omega}_{nl } )   +   \\frac{1}{w^2 } \\sum_{i=1}^{m } a_i^{(3 ) } p_i(\\tilde{\\omega}_{nl } )   + \\frac{1}{w^4 } \\sum_{i=1}^{m } a_i^{(4 ) } p_i(\\tilde{\\omega}_{nl } )   \\label{eq : surf - a}\\ ] ] if we define @xmath44_{\\rm{bcz}}$ ] to be the contribution of the perturbations near and below the bcz , @xmath35 can be expressed as @xmath45_{\\rm{surf } } + \\left [ \\frac{\\delta \\omega_{nl}}{\\omega_{nl } } \\bar{e}_{nl } \\right]_{\\rm{bcz } } \\label{eq : sum - a}\\ ] ] where @xmath44_{\\rm{bcz } } = 0 $ ] for @xmath29 .    to obtain @xmath44_{bcz}$ ] , first , we fit equations ( [ eq : surf - a ] ) to the measured @xmath35 for the range of @xmath29 to determine the coefficients , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 .",
    "second , we use these coefficients to compute @xmath44_{\\rm{surf}}$ ] for all ranges of @xmath1 .",
    "third , the contribution from the bcz , @xmath44_{\\rm{bcz}}$ ] , is computed with equation ( [ eq : sum - a ] ) .",
    "in this section , we test the above method with a model computation .",
    "first , we perturb a standard model @xcite by changing its adiabatic exponent @xmath50 in two regions : one is located near the surface and another near the bcz .",
    "each perturbation is a gaussian in depth .",
    "the near - surface perturbed region has a magnitude of @xmath51 located at @xmath52 with a width of @xmath53 .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath54 is chosen such that the frequency change is close to the measured value at maximum .",
    "the near - bcz perturbed region has a magnitude of @xmath55 located at @xmath56 with a width of @xmath57 .",
    "second , the mode frequencies of the perturbed model are computed @xcite .",
    "third , the relative frequency difference between the perturbed and unperturbed models scaled by mode mass , @xmath35 , is computed .",
    "its value versus @xmath58 is shown in the upper left panel of figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "the scattering of the data is due to the frequency dependence . it is noted that an increase in @xmath35 is visible around @xmath59 which corresponds to the location of the assumed perturbation near the bcz . to see the trend of the scattered data , we smooth data with a 41-point box running mean .",
    "the advantage of smoothing is discussed in  5 .",
    "the oscillatory features in the smoothed data are due to the ridge structure of p - mode frequencies .",
    "fourth , equation ( [ eq : surf - a ] ) is fitted to @xmath35 for the range of @xmath29 to determine the coefficients @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 .",
    "here we adopt @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) , and @xmath62 .",
    "fifth , these coefficients are used to compute @xmath44_{\\rm{surf}}$ ] with equation ( [ eq : surf - a ] ) for all ranges of @xmath1 .",
    "sixth , @xmath44_{\\rm{bcz}}$ ] is computed with equation ( [ eq : sum - a ] ) .",
    "the result is shown in the upper right panel of figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "the scattering of data is greatly reduced , especially for @xmath29 .",
    "it is because the frequency dependence , described by @xmath44_{\\rm{surf}}$ ] , has been removed .",
    "the global trend of increase in @xmath35 with @xmath1 is also removed .",
    "its @xmath1 dependence is flat and its value is close to zero . for comparison , we plot @xmath35 computed with only the bcz perturbation in the lower part of the upper right panel in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "it can be seen that the near - surface contributions are reasonably well removed and a small change in frequency caused by the near - bcz perturbation is reasonably well recovered .",
    "the solar p - mode frequencies used in this study are derived from the data taken with the michelson doppler imager ( mdi ) on board the soho @xcite .",
    "the frequencies are measured with a time series of 72 days .",
    "we use the modes in the range : @xmath36 mhz and @xmath37 , because of no missing frequency in this range . to avoid that the result may be dominated by a few frequencies with large errors , we discard those frequencies by the following procedure .",
    "first , for each mode , temporal variations of frequency is fitted to a linear function .",
    "second , the standard deviation is computed .",
    "third , the frequencies deviated from the fit greater than three standard deviation are discarded .",
    "less than @xmath63 of frequencies considered are discarded .",
    "the frequency averaged over a solar minimum period , 1996.05 - 1997.07 , is used as the reference frequency .",
    "the frequency change along the solar cycle is computed relative to the reference frequency .",
    "the relative frequency change , scaled by mode mass , averaged over a maximum period ( 2000 ) is shown in the lower left panels of figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "the data are rather scattered .",
    "part of scattering is due to the frequency dependence of @xmath35 as shown in the model computation in  2 , part is due to the error of measured frequency . the smoothed data with a 41-point box running mean as  3 are shown with a solid line .",
    "the interesting phenomenon shown in the smoothed data is that the values of @xmath35 at small @xmath1 and large @xmath1 are different .",
    "it is approximately constant for @xmath64 and drops to a smaller value at @xmath65 .",
    "we use the method described in  2 and  3 to remove the contributions of the near - surface perturbation to obtain @xmath44_{\\rm{bcz}}$ ] .",
    "the results are shown in the lower right panels of figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "although the scattering of data is reduced , it is still significantly greater than that in modeling .",
    "it is probably caused by the the error of measured frequency .",
    "the smoothed @xmath44_{\\rm{bcz}}$ ] is also shown by a solid line . in the range of @xmath29 , similar to the modeling in  3 ,",
    "the global trend in @xmath35 is removed .",
    "the @xmath1 dependence is rather flat and the value is about zero .",
    "the difference between small @xmath1 and large @xmath1 becomes more apparent in @xmath44_{\\rm{bcz}}$ ] .    to see how this phenomenon varies with the solar cycle",
    ", we plot the smoothed @xmath35 for different periods along the solar cycle in the upper left panels of figure [ fig2 ] . in the period of low activity ( 1997 - 1998 ) , the curve is rather flat .",
    "as the activity increases , @xmath35 at @xmath66 becomes smaller relative to that at @xmath67 .",
    "the difference increases with the activity .",
    "after subtracting the near - surface contributions , @xmath44_{\\rm{bcz}}$ ] is shown in the upper right panel of figure [ fig2 ] . at @xmath64 , @xmath44_{\\rm{bcz}}$ ] is approximately flat and close to zero . at @xmath68 , @xmath44_{\\rm{bcz}}$ ]",
    "is negative .",
    "the @xmath1 dependence of @xmath35 provides depth information on the perturbation in the solar interior .",
    "however , it is difficult to see the weak @xmath1 dependence of @xmath35 from the scattered @xmath35 .",
    "we smooth @xmath35 to search for its weak @xmath1 dependence .",
    "smoothing has another advantage .",
    "smoothing is equivalent to averaging over frequencies at a fixed @xmath1 .",
    "if the higher order terms , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , are neglected in equation ( 1 ) , smoothed @xmath35 equals to @xmath69 , where the constant is the average of @xmath15 over frequencies which is independent of @xmath1 .",
    "thus smoothed @xmath35 gives the @xmath1 dependence of @xmath14 .",
    "this can be demonstrated with model computations .",
    "we have tried several ways of smoothing : the box running mean , fit to a polynomial , and savitzky - golay smoothing filters @xcite .",
    "although different smoothing methods yield different results , the main feature discussed here remains similar .",
    "here we use a 41-point box running mean to smooth @xmath35 .",
    "the @xmath1 dependence of the smoothed @xmath35 varies with the solar cycle as shown in figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "the smoothed @xmath35 remains rather flat at low @xmath1 in all periods , but it begins to change ( decrease ) at @xmath65 .",
    "the difference between small @xmath1 and large @xmath1 increases with the magnetic activities on the surface .",
    "the error bars shown in figures [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] are computed with the errors of measured frequencies , based on the error propagation .",
    "it is noted that the fluctuation of smoothed @xmath35 in the range of @xmath64 is approximately the same for all periods and smaller than the temporal variations at @xmath68 .",
    "together with the small error bars of smoothed @xmath35 , it suggests that the random errors of measured frequency can not account for the temporal variations at @xmath68 .",
    "we can not rule out the possibility of systematic errors , though it is not clear what kind of systematic error would cause this phenomenon . after removing the near - surface contributions ,",
    "the relative decrease at @xmath68 becomes more apparent .",
    "negative @xmath44_{\\rm{bcz}}$ ] at @xmath68 correspond to the existence of a region near the bcz with a smaller wave speed relative to solar minimum . from model computations ,",
    "a decrease in sound - speed near the bcz would create a dip in @xmath44_{\\rm{bcz}}$ ] at @xmath65 .",
    "because of the small s / n , it is difficult to discuss the existence of this dip in figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "however , we can increase the s / n by computing the difference between @xmath44_{\\rm{bcz}}$ ] averaged over small @xmath1 and large @xmath1 .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] shows the difference between @xmath44_{\\rm{bcz}}$ ] averaged over @xmath70 and @xmath71 versus time .",
    "this difference approximately increases with solar activity .",
    "the cause of the relative decrease in frequency at large @xmath1 is not clear .",
    "if magnetic fields at the bcz causes an increase in wave speed , the phenomenon observed here might suggest that variations of magnetic flux near the bcz and surface magnetic flux are not in phase .    in this study",
    ", we use the frequency at solar minimum as the reference and investigate solar - cycle variations of frequency change relative to this reference frequency .",
    "this approach suffers from the risk that the error in frequency at minimum affects the results in all other periods . to avoid it",
    ", we also use the frequency averaged over all periods as the reference .",
    "the smoothed @xmath35 , are shown in the lower left panel of figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "although these curves are smoother than those using the frequency averaged over minimum as the reference , the relative temporal variations of two groups of curves are consistent .    since @xmath9 is proportional to the mode mass @xmath7 , in this study we replace @xmath9 by @xmath72 .",
    "although sometimes @xmath73 , which equal @xmath7 normalized by mode mass of a radial mode of the same frequency , are used in other studies , the frequency dependence of the mode mass of radial modes would make the first term in equation ( [ eq : h1234-a ] ) no longer a function of @xmath1 only .",
    "however , in practice we find that using @xmath7 and @xmath73 yield very close results . the difference between @xmath74_{\\rm{bcz}}$ ] averaged over small @xmath1 and large @xmath1 using @xmath73",
    "is also shown in figure 3 .    in removing the near - surface contribution",
    ", the choice of the range of @xmath1 in the fit would affect the detailed features of @xmath44_{\\rm{bcz}}$ ] . however , the main feature of smoothed @xmath44_{\\rm{bcz}}$ ] is robust with respect to the choice of the fit range .",
    "in deriving equation ( [ eq : h1-c ] ) from equation ( [ eq : h1-a ] ) , we have assumed that the perturbation in the cz is negligible except near the surface .",
    "if it is not the case , we need to include higher - order terms of @xmath75 in equation ( [ eq : h1-c ] ) .    in summary , figures [ fig1]-[fig2 ]",
    "indicate that solar - cycle variations of the @xmath1 dependence of @xmath35 at @xmath64 and @xmath68 are different .",
    "this phenomenon suggests that the physical conditions in a region near the bcz change with the solar cycle . if we attribute the difference in @xmath44_{\\rm{bcz}}$ ] between @xmath64 and @xmath68 to a change in @xmath76 near the bcz , it corresponds to @xmath77 at @xmath78 , if the fwhm of the gaussian perturbation is @xmath57 .",
