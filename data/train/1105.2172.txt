    "the short duration of the vhe flare observed in @xcite likely implies that this flare is originated not too far from the star , whereas in hess  j0632@xmath2057 the situation is less clear ( see @xcite ) . under the strong ultraviolet photon field of a massive star",
    ", gamma - ray absorption can take place ( e.g. @xcite ) , this process leading to the creation of secondary ( electron - positron ) pairs with energies @xmath3  gev and peaking around 30  gev .",
    "secondary pairs are created under the stellar photon field and , as shown below , are likely trapped by the stellar wind magnetic field of strength @xmath4 . for small enough values of @xmath4 and high enough values of the secondary particle energy @xmath5 ,",
    "most of the pair energy is emitted , via inverse compton ( ic ) scattering of stellar photons , as gamma - rays with energies above the pair - creation threshold .",
    "if the gamma - ray opacity coefficient @xmath6 is @xmath7 , the electromagnetic cascade may significantly affect the distribution of secondary pairs in the system .",
    "however , for this to be efficient the initial gamma - ray energy must be well above the pair creation energy threshold , @xmath8 ( i.e. deep in the klein - nishina -kn- regime ) , where @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the threshold , the gamma - ray and the stellar photon energies in @xmath12 units . in this regime , say for energies of the secondary pairs @xmath13",

    "equation  [ bkn ] has been derived from eq .  1 in @xcite , which gives the ic cooling timescale in the kn regime with a 10  ev photon field as target .",
    "we reproduce the formula here for the sake of clarity : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the stellar radiation energy density , and @xmath5 is the electron energy . for @xmath20 , the secondary bolometric luminosity output will be dominated by synchrotron radiation .",
    "this implies a magnetic field strength : @xmath21 all this shows that even for magnetic fields well below equipartition with radiation , synchrotron losses can effectively prevent development of electromagnetic cascades .",
    "@xcite carried out a detailed semi - analytical study of the spectral properties of the secondary broadband emission for realistic magnetic field values ( see also @xcite ) . in that work",
    ", it was shown that the radio , x - ray , and gev fluxes of secondary emission could be comparable to those observed in gamma - ray binaries , and may even dominate the non - thermal output below @xmath9 in some cases .",
    "these authors also suggested that the extended radio emission found in ls  i  + 61  303 @xcite may come from secondary pairs .",
    "@xcite also proposed this origin for the emission of the marginally resolved radio core of ls  5039 @xcite .",
    "although the radio fluxes can be roughly estimated from the semi - analytical study of @xcite , their approach does not allow a proper description of the radio spectrum , lightcurve , and morphology , because synchrotron radio emitting particles have long timescales and are strongly affected by the medium inhomogeneity at spatial scales of @xmath22 .",
    "in that work , the complex 3-dimensional ( 3d ) structure of the secondary trajectories was simplified attaching the secondary pairs to the stellar wind , with the latter being taken as spherically symmetric , with constant velocity , and wind particle and magnetic field energy density @xmath23 .",
    "the magnetic field was considered fully irregular .",
    "finally , the adiabatic cooling of the secondary pairs was not taken into account , which is reasonable at binary spatial scales , but not for the computation of that radio emission produced outside the binary system , affected by wind expansion .",
    "finally , the relevance of free - free absorption was not investigated .    in this work ,",
    "we present detailed calculations of the evolution of the radio emitting secondary pairs in gamma - ray binaries .",
    "the energy and the spatial evolution of the particles in the stellar wind have been computed using a monte - carlo code that accounts for ionization / coulombian collision losses , adiabatic , relativistic bremsstrahlung , synchrotron , and ic cooling , as well as diffusion and advection in the wind to follow the trajectories of secondary pairs in the source .",
    "the code can also deal with anisotropic diffusion when an ordered magnetic field is dominant , although we do not consider this configuration at this stage .",
    "a sketch of the the scenario at the scales of the binary system is shown in fig .",
    "once the particle energy and spatial distributions have been obtained at a particular orbital phase ( accounting for the previous orbital history of the system ) , the radio emission in a specific direction is calculated , which allows the generation of directional radio maps .",
    "the radio maps have been smoothed using a circular gaussian in order to roughly reproduce what an observer would see using a milliarcsecond ( mas ) resolution radio interferometer .",
    "this is also illustrated in fig .",
    "spectra and lightcurves , and the impact of free - free absorption , have been discussed .",
    "we focus here on a generic case , since our aim is to give a general demonstration of the relevance of secondary radio emission , but we provide also with an instance of the importance of this phenomenon in a real source , applying our calculations to ls  5039 . further and more detailed studies for specific objects of the role of secondary pairs for the radio emission will be presented elsewhere .     +",
    "for an appropriate study of the secondary radio emission , detailed calculations of the energy and spatial evolution of the secondary pairs are required , accounting for the star radiation field and the properties of the stellar wind .",
    "given the difficulties of treating the magnetic field structure and adiabatic cooling in the wind in a semi - analytical approach , we have performed monte - carlo simulations in which secondaries pairs are injected , move ( diffuse and are advected ) , and cool down in a 3d space.the 3d nature of the problem comes from the combination of the advection in the wind plus the orbital motion ( a significant regular @xmath4-field structure would also require a 3d treatment ) .",
    "the problem treated by the monte - carlo method is similar to that described by the diffusion advection equation ( e.g. @xcite ) .",

    "we have calculated the injected spatial and energy distribution of secondary pairs for a given primary gamma - ray spectrum and a stellar black - body photon field .",
    "this is done tracking the path of a photon produced in the emitter location and moving with a certain direction in the binary system .",
    "the location in which a given gamma ray is absorbed is obtained using the ( anisotropic ) gamma - ray absorption differential probability due to photon - photon interactions ( point - like treatment of the star ; see below ) : @xmath36 where @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the length of the path covered by the gamma ray , the gamma - ray / stellar photon interaction angle , the stellar photon specific density , and the pair - creation cross section @xcite , respectively .",
    "this quantity is integrated along the photon path @xmath41 to obtain the probabity of interaction up to a certain location . in this work ,",
    "the absorption probability is computed along the photon trajectory with small steps , and the monte - carlo algorithm is applied to define the interaction point .",
    "the injection rate of secondary pairs depends strongly on the spectrum and angular distribution of the primary gamma rays . to mimic the effect of the anisotropic ic scattering in the angular distribution of primary gamma rays , a gamma - ray direction probability at injection @xmath42 has been introduced , where @xmath43 is the angle between the gamma - ray path and the direction from the star to the gamma - ray emitter",
    ", i.e. gamma rays have a higher probability to be emitted towards than away from the star",
    ". this angular dependence would roughly correspond to an average one between the thomson and kn ic regimes ( see fig .  6 in @xcite ) .    in fig .",

    "no eccentricity and a fixed @xmath57-value have been taken for the sake of simplicity , since our aim is to illustrate the main characteristics of the secondary radio emitter .          in these calculations ,",

    "thus , even for the most sensitive interval of gamma - ray energies , the point - like approximation of the stellar photon field fails for a fraction of the total relevant volume @xmath62 and @xmath63 for @xmath64 and @xmath65 , respectively .",
    "therefore , given a rather broad distribution of primary gamma rays and for @xmath66 , the point - like approximation for the star would have an accuracy at least of the order of a 10% .",

    "s@xmath52  @xmath73 and @xmath70 ( phase 0.2 ) , and @xmath168  tev@xmath52  s@xmath52  @xmath73 and @xmath169 ( phase 0.8 ) . since the location of the emitter is not well constrained @xcite , two different heights have been chosen that optimize the radio fluxes without entering in strong conflict with the x - ray fluxes . at phase 0.2 ,",
    "we have located the emitter at a height of @xmath119  cm , and at @xmath170  cm at phase 0.8 , perpendicularly to the orbital plane , in the observer side of that plane .",
    "there is no additional emitter assumed at a location symmetric with respect to the orbital plane , although if gamma - rays were produced in a symmetric bipolar jet , this component should be also included in the calculations .",
    "however , given the expected higher wind free - free opacity for this component , its contribution is expected to be smaller than the one considered here .",
    "we have computed the secondary injection and evolution starting a phase interval of 0.5 earlier than the phases in which the radiation is evaluated , i.e. @xmath171 and @xmath172 .",
    "however , most of the radio emission , including the outermost region of the emitter , comes from secondary pairs injected within a phase interval of 0.2 earlier , due to adiabatic cooling .",
    "the resulting images of the raw radio emission , of the source convolved with a gaussian , and the residuals after extracting a point - like source are presented in fig .",
    "the figure shows that the radiation , with a typical emitter size of @xmath148  mas , would be difficult to resolve , although the bigger size of the system around infc may lead to a marginal extension .",
    "the obtained total fluxes at 5  ghz are about 6 and 10  mjy at phases 0.2 and 0.8 , respectively . the complex flux evolution along the orbit of the primary ( deabsorbed ) gamma - ray spectra yield different spectra from those of the generic case , obtaining @xmath173 ( 0.2 ) and @xmath174 ( 0.8 ) .",
    "this is due to secondary pairs injected at different phases , with different absorbed luminosities , produce the radiation at different frequencies at the same orbital phase .",
    "the computed luminosities in the range 110  kev are of about @xmath175  erg  s@xmath52 , similar to those observed in this energy range ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "these x - ray fluxes already constrain the fluxes of the radio emission to several mjy at most .",
    "these results are nevertheless sensitive to the radial profile of @xmath4 , which is not well known , thus we do not treat here the high - energy output of the secondary emission . the impact of free - free absorption in the wind has not been considered either , but this process could reduce significantly the secondary radio emission mainly for phases around supc under high ionization fractions .",

    "this work shows that the radio emission detected from compact gamma - ray binaries that contain a massive star could have a non - negligible component coming from the secondary pairs created in the vicinity of the gamma - ray emitter .",
    "actually , the following simple estimate of the radio flux already indicates this . assuming that secondary pairs cool mainly through adiabatic cooling in the region in which they produce radio emission , which is the case for a wide range of parameter values , and a wind velocity of @xmath182  cm  s@xmath52 , the expected fluxes can be derived from the formula : @xmath183 @xmath184 where @xmath185 is the energy of the radio emitting particles , @xmath186 the angle averaged opacity at gamma - ray energies around 100  gev , @xmath187 the synchrotron cooling timescale , @xmath188  gev the secondary typical injection energy , @xmath189 the vhe luminosity , @xmath190 , and @xmath130 the distance to the source . in eq .",
    "( [ rad ] ) , the product @xmath191 should be substituted by @xmath192 for @xmath193 ( and @xmath186 fixed to 1 ) . in sources with parameters such that @xmath194  mjy , secondary radio emission should not be neglected .",
    "the most crucial point here is whether magnetic fields of the order of 10  g can be found at few @xmath35 from the star .",
    "as shown in this work , secondary radio emission from gamma - ray binaries would not be only relevant in flux , but they could also present resolvable extensions . in general , the spectra can be flat or softer depending on @xmath19 ( adiabatic vs ic cooling dominance ) , and the absorbed gamma - ray luminosity and the radio emitter conditions , in particular @xmath195 and @xmath4 , along the orbit . in the particular case of ls  5039 , we find that a dominant fraction of the marginally extended core of ls  5039 @xcite could be of secondary origin , with a changing relatively soft spectrum . since the computed additional extension appears marginal , the observed elongated emission at 5  ghz beyond the core in ls  5039 would be likely related to an intrinsic primary radio emitter .",
    "regarding morphology , we find that a spiral - like shape would be expected , although typically the small angular size of the radio source presently prevents detailed imaging",
    ". such a spiral - like shape was also predicted in @xcite , although the treatment there was simpler than in the present work .",
    "it is worthy noting that the wind conditions could differ from those adopted here , and then the shape , and even the radio emitter extension , may change .",
    "more collimated radio structures , or a magnetic field increase downstream the wind leading to more extended radio emission , can not be discarded .",
    "it is remarkable that the spatial distribution of the radio emitting secondary pairs is strongly determined by their injection , which depends on the stellar photon field and the gamma - ray emitter location , and by the stellar wind inhomogeneities and anisotropies , but not by @xmath4 .",
    "only a very regular @xmath4 , with very large @xmath95-values , could modify significantly the distribution of radio emitting secondary pairs , since then these particles would move at @xmath196 along the dominantly toroidal @xmath4 , i.e. leaving the system with a speed @xmath197 , between @xmath195 and @xmath196 . for reasonable @xmath4 and @xmath95-values ,",
    "particles are trapped in the wind , and their energy distribution is determined by ic and adiabatic cooling .",
    "the magnetic field strength is then relevant only for the synchrotron fluxes ( recall @xmath198 ) , and its level of ( ir)regularity , @xmath95 , for variability .",
    "polarization would also be affected by @xmath95 , and polarization observations may probe the @xmath4 geometry .",
    "however , the high density of cold free electrons in the stellar wind could induce strong faraday rotation .",
    "a proper study of the impact of this on the final polarization degree and angle requires a devoted investigation .",
    "system eccentricity , a significant regular magnetic field component , and free - free absorption would be sources of radio variability and should be considered when studying specific cases .",
    "changes in the gamma - ray luminosity would also lead to a smooth modulation of the secondary radio emission . to finish with",
    ", it seems likely that in gamma - ray binaries , the radio emission from inner regions can be , if not dominated , significantly contaminated by secondary radiation .",
    "secondary pairs should not be neglected when understanding the broadband non - thermal emission in compact gamma - ray sources , nor the physical connection of the radiation produced in different bands .",
