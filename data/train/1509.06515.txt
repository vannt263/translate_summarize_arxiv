    "this paper discusses an empirically observed feature that we refer to as _",
    "incremental similarity_. its most remarkable manifestation is in turbulence but it is also found , in a less prononunced form , in finance .    in high frequency recordings of velocities of homogeneous , isotropic and stationary turbulence",
    "the non - gaussian and skewed distributions of velocity increments from different experiments and different lags are essentially identical provided they have the same variance .",
    "note however that this identification is effectuated lag by lag and not by a simple common transformation .",
    "the observation of incremental similarity for turbulent velocity time series adds a new type of universality to the statistical stylised features of turbulent flows . in the time domain",
    ", the term universality traditionally refers to universal scaling properties of structure functions defined as moments of velocity increments .",
    "these scaling laws are only realised in the limit of very large reynolds numbers , i.e. strongly turbulent flows . even for large reynolds numbers only approximate scaling is observed and only for a certain range of time scales , the so - called inertial range , which covers merely part of the dynamically active scales .    the new stylised feature of incremental similarity points towards a completely different type of universality .",
    "incremental similarity characterises the distributions of velocity increments at all dynamically active scales .",
    "furthermore , our empirical analysis shows that incremental similarity is not restricted to any high reynolds number limit . and",
    "finally , incremental similarity provides a relatively simple mapping that directly connects measurements from different experiments , different in reynolds numbers and different in boundary conditions .",
    "the phenomenon of incremental similarity was first noted in the paper bnblsch04 which revealed this trait through a detailed analysis of the recordings of the main component of the velocity vector from three different types of experiments , with reynold s numbers 80 , 190 , 17000 .",
    "the collapsibility of the incremental distributions was of extraordinary degree .",
    "this type of analysis has since been extended to a much larger class of experiments , as reported in @xcite , fully confirming the original observation .",
    "however , up till now a mathematical representation of the phenomenon has not been given .",
    "such a representation is proposed in this paper .    as stated here",
    "the property of incremental ( or distributional ) similarity is of nonparametric character but , as demonstrated in @xcite , the laws of the velocity differences can be fitted by the normal inverse gaussian distribution , denoted @xmath0 , to a high degree of precision .",
    "this distribution was introduced in @xcite and has since found a multitude of applications in a variety of fields .",
    "recently the fact that @xmath0 describes the velocity increments to high precision has found a theoretical counterpart in studies of birnir concerning a stochastic version of the navier - stokes equations , see @xcite .",
    "the empirical evidence for incremental similarity is summarised in section 2 .",
    "section 3 presents a mathematical definition of incremental similarity - or is - and an extended concept - extis - and a variety of examples of stochastic processes and fields that meet the definition of incremental similarity exactly are presented there . for the relation to the statistical theory of turbulence it is crucial to have examples where the processes considered are stationary , and",
    "herein lies the main difficulty .",
    "section 4 briefly adresses the question of modelling the timewise behaviour of the main component of the velocity vector in homogeneous turbulence by stochastic processes embodying the main universal features of this type of dynamics , including that of incremental similarity .",
    "the empirical verification of incremental similarity , presented in @xcite  and @xcite and briefly outlined here , is based on the analysis of 17 experimental data sets ( a wake - flow experiments , a free - jet experiment , 13 helium jet experiments , one wind tunnel experiment , one data set from the atmospheric boundary layer ) and on one data set from a direct numerical simulation ( dns ) of the navier - stokes equation .",
    "the reynolds numbers covered by these data range from 80 up to 20000 .",
    "the empirical data consist of stationary time series of recordings of the main component of the turbulent velocity vector measured at a fixed position in space .",
    "the dns data are spatially homogeneous at a fixed point in time .",
    "all data are standardised for the velocities to have a unit variance .",
    "let @xmath1 denote the velocity signal at time @xmath2 belonging to the data set @xmath3 .",
    "we denote by @xmath4 the velocity increment at time scale @xmath5 . here",
    "we skip reference to @xmath2 since we are only dealing with stationary time series .",
    "( for the dns data @xmath2 denotes the spatial position . )    a key observation related to the densities of velocity increments is depicted in figure [ fig : nig - fit ] .",
    "each graph corresponds to the densitiy of velocity increments at a certain time scale @xmath5 with @xmath5 increasing from top left to bottom right .",
    "these densities evolve from heavy tails at small time scales towards a more gaussian shape at the large time scales .",
    "this evolution across scales is well known in the literature and sometimes called aggregational gaussianity .",
    "figure [ fig : nig - fit ] also shows , as solid lines , the approximation of these densities within the class of normal inverse gaussian distributions .",
    "the normal inverse gaussian distributions fit the empirical densities equally well for all time lags and all amplitudes .",
    "figure [ fig : nig - fit ] provides one example for the evolution across scales , similar results are observed for the other data sets we analysed .",
    "the larger the reynolds number the more the heavyness of the tails . and",
    ", different data sets show different distributions at the same time scale .",
    "but the key question that is of interest here is : do different experiments show the same distribution of increments just at different time scales ?",
    "in other words : is the evolution across scales exemplified in figure [ fig : nig - fit ] universal in the sense that the distributions of @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the same if @xmath8 is properly chosen given @xmath5 ? obviously , an affirmative answer requires that the variances at these time scales are the same @xmath9    figure [ fig : inc - same - var ] shows the corresponding densities of velocity increments for @xmath10 fixed values of the variance .",
    "each plot corresponds to a different value , increasing from top left to bottom right .",
    "the densities within each plot correspond to different experiments and different time lags , but the variances are the same .",
    "we clearly observe the collapse of the densities during the whole evolution across scales . in this sense",
    "the evolution across scales is universal .",
    "the shape of the distributions in figure [ fig : inc - same - var ] is , to a good approximation , a universal function of the variance . for normal distributions ,",
    "this is trivial .",
    "but here we clearly have distributions that are not normal .",
    "as theoretical counterpart to the incremental similarity features discussed in sections 1 and 2 we introduce the following definition    * * definition * * _ _  incremental similarity__let @xmath11  and @xmath12  be two stochastic processes on @xmath13 . then @xmath11  and @xmath14  are said to be incrementally similar , or is , provided that for any @xmath15 and any @xmath16  there exists a @xmath17  and a positive number @xmath18  such that the law of @xmath19 is the same as that of @xmath20 .",
    "more generally , if @xmath21  and @xmath22 are two classes of stochastic process on @xmath13 then @xmath21  and @xmath22are said to have the is  property if all pairs @xmath11  and @xmath14 such that @xmath23  and @xmath24 are of is type .",
    "for brevity we will then say that @xmath25 is is and that @xmath26  is is if that is the case of @xmath27.@xmath28    there are many trivial examples of increment similarity . for instance , any continuous gaussian process is incrementally similar to brownian motion .",
    "another example is where @xmath11 and @xmath14  are stationary processes on @xmath29  with @xmath14  equal in law to a proportional timechange of @xmath11 , that is @xmath30  for some @xmath31 .",
    "various non - obvious examples may be based on the following concept of extended incremental similarity or extis .    * * definition * * _ _  extended incremental similarity__let @xmath32  be a class of positive , continuous and decreasing functions @xmath33  on @xmath34 .",
    "further , let @xmath35 } : r\\in r\\right\\ } $ ]  be a parametrised family of stationary processses @xmath36 } $ ] on @xmath13 with the property that for any pair of time points @xmath37  the joint law of @xmath38 } $ ] and @xmath39 } $ ]  is fully determined by @xmath40 ; this in particular implies that the same holds for the law of the increment @xmath39 } -x_{t}^{\\left [ r\\right ] } $ ] .",
    "we furthermore assume that the joint law of @xmath38 } $ ]  and @xmath41 } $ ] is the same as the joint law of @xmath42 } $ ]  and @xmath43 } $ ] provided @xmath44 whatever @xmath33and @xmath45  in @xmath46 .",
    "we then say that , relative to @xmath46 , @xmath21has the property of extended incremental similarity or that @xmath21is extis .",
    "@xmath28    if @xmath21  is extis then it is in particular is . as a another direct consequence of the definition of extis we have    * *",
    "proposition**let @xmath47 denote independent extis families relative to the same index class @xmath46 . if @xmath48  is a real ( measurable ) function on @xmath49  and if @xmath50 } : r\\in r\\right\\ } $ ]  is the class of processes given by@xmath51 } = f\\left ( x_{1t}^{\\left [ r\\right ] } , ... , x_{nt}^{\\left [ r\\right ] } \\right)\\]]where @xmath52 } \\in \\mathcal{x}_{j}$ ] , @xmath53 ,  then the family @xmath54  is extis , and hence is .",
    "in fact , the same conclusion holds if @xmath48  is random , provided it is independent of @xmath55.@xmath28    applications of this result will be discussed in section 4 .",
    "we proceed to present some classes of stationary processes on @xmath13 having the extis property    let @xmath56 be the class  of stationary gaussian processes on @xmath57 of mean @xmath58  and variance @xmath59 such that for any member @xmath11  of @xmath60  the autocorrelation function @xmath61of @xmath11  is positive , continuous and strictly decreasing to @xmath58 . then , as is easily seen , @xmath56  is extis .",
    "the concept of trawl processes , introduced in @xcite , offers a range of extis classes .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , the simplest type of trawl processes @xmath11  on @xmath13  are of the form@xmath62where @xmath63  is a homogeneous lvy basis on @xmath64 and @xmath65  for a borel set @xmath66 in @xmath64 with positive lebesgue measure , points in @xmath64  being denoted by @xmath67 . in this case , since for any @xmath68 we have@xmath69the cumulant function of @xmath70 is given by@xmath71 \\end{aligned}\\]]where @xmath72  denotes the lvy seed of @xmath63 , @xmath73 indicates lebesgue measure and@xmath74    now consider the class @xmath75  of borel sets",
    "@xmath66 such that ( trawl r )  is positive for all  real @xmath76 with @xmath33  continuous and strictly decreasing on @xmath77 and tending to @xmath58  as @xmath78 .",
    "let @xmath46 be the corresponding class of functions @xmath33 .",
    "furthermore , for any @xmath31  let @xmath79  be the subclass of @xmath75given by @xmath80 .",
    "if @xmath21  is the class of trawl processes corresponding to a given seed @xmath72  and a given @xmath79 then @xmath21  is extis and hence is .",
    "we note that@xmath81    in case @xmath72  is square integrable then @xmath33  is the autocorrelation function of the process @xmath82 . in general we will refer to @xmath33  as the _ autodependence _ function of @xmath82 . by suitable choice of @xmath66",
    "the autodependence function can be selected to show short , middle or long term dependence .    with reference to section 2",
    "we note that if the law of @xmath72  is normal inverse gaussian and symmetric then @xmath83  and all increments of @xmath82  are also normal inverse gaussian distributed .    next , suppose that @xmath84  is a stationary process of the form@xmath85where @xmath63  is a symmetric @xmath86-stable lvy process on @xmath13and the kernel function @xmath87 satisfies @xmath88  for @xmath89  and@xmath90for some @xmath91 .",
    "then the integral ( [ lss])exists and , since the lvy seed @xmath72  of @xmath63 has cumulant function@xmath92we find , for @xmath16 , that@xmath93now , let @xmath94  be the class of kernel functions @xmath87  such that @xmath87is continuous and strictly decreasing to @xmath58 and let @xmath21  be the corresponding class of stochastic processes ( [ lss ] ) .",
    "suppose that @xmath87and @xmath95 are both members of @xmath94  and consider the analogue of ( cumaxx ) , i.e.@xmath96where @xmath14  denotes the element of @xmath21  corresponding to @xmath95 .",
    "only in quite exceptional cases will it be possible for every @xmath16  to find a @xmath97  such that @xmath98 .",
    "in other words , in the present setting interesting examples of extis do not exist .",
    "on the other hand,@xmath99where@xmath100and therefore there are subclasses of @xmath21 that are is .",
    "specifically , for a fixed @xmath91 , consider the subclass  @xmath101  of @xmath94 of kernels @xmath87  such that @xmath102 does not depend on @xmath87 .",
    "then the processes @xmath11  in  @xmath21  have the same one - dimensional marginal distribution , and @xmath21  is is .",
    "in fact , for any @xmath103  and any @xmath16 there exists a @xmath104  such that the condition @xmath105 is met .    from the viewpoint of applications",
    "the question now is whether in principle it is possible , given a class of processes that are known to be of is type ( or suspected to be so ) , to determine the transformation that effectuates the collapsibility of the laws of increments from the different members of the class .",
    "empirically , given that high frequency and extensive datasets are available from each of the processes in question and that stationarity of the series is a realistic assumption , the most immediate way is to first standardise the series to have the same marginal variance and then estimate the variances of the increments for a suitable range of lags , as was done for the turbulence data discussed in section 2 .",
    "however , in case the data are suspected to come from a fractional regime where second order moments may not in principle exist , such as the @xmath86-stable setting considered above , one may resort to other methods of lag transformation , for instance resorting to estimation of fractional moments .",
    "in @xcite  the concept of brownian semistationary processes - or @xmath108  - processes was introduced .",
    "these are stationary processes of the form@xmath109where @xmath110  is brownian motion , @xmath111 and @xmath112  are stationary processes and the kernels @xmath87 and @xmath113 are deterministic functions .",
    "the particular setting@xmath114is of particular interest .",
    "( it may be seen as a stationary analogue of the bns  model studied in financial econometrics . )",
    "the @xmath107 class is obtained by substitution of @xmath110  in ( [ bss ] ) by a general lvy process @xmath63 .",
    "the primary aim of the definitions of @xmath106  and @xmath107 was to model the timewise behaviour of the main velocity component in a homogeneous turbulent flow , but the same kind of processes have found many applications elsewhere , see for instance @xcite , @xcite and references given there .",
    "@xmath106 processes of type ( [ bsspar ] )  have been demonstrated to be capable of modelling classical stylised features of turbulence very accurately , cf .",
    "@xcite . and a recent study @xcite of the helium data discussed in section 2 , based on exponential @xmath107 processes , has revealed a new type of universality for the energy dissipation .",
    "however , the @xmath106  structure does not have the property of extended increment similarity and it is therefore natural to ask whether there is a modification of that structure having dynamic behaviour closely similar to @xmath106  but also exhibiting extis .",
    "to this end we now introduce the following variant of @xmath106 .",
    "let @xmath115  be a stationary gaussian process such that the  one - dimensional marginals of @xmath11  have mean @xmath58  and variance @xmath59 .",
    "let @xmath111 be a stationary , cadlag and square integrable process with autocorrelation function @xmath116 , and let @xmath117for some constant @xmath118",
    ". we shall refer to this type as a @xmath119  process . colloquially speaking",
    ", the alternative view amounts to moving the volatility process @xmath111 in ( [ bsspar ] ) outside the integration signs .",
    "now , let @xmath54  be the class of processes ( [ bss ] ) obtained by letting the autocorrelation function @xmath33 of @xmath11  vary over the set @xmath46  for which @xmath33  is positive , continous and decreasing on @xmath77 and taking @xmath120  to vary over a family @xmath121  which in itself is extis with the same index set @xmath46 and such that @xmath111  is paired with @xmath11  so as to have the same index @xmath33 .",
    "then , in view of the proposition presented in section 3 , the class @xmath54  is extis .",
    "for instance , @xmath121  could be chosen to be an extis class of processes @xmath122  for which the @xmath123  are trawl process @xmath124 , as discussed in section 3  in particular , @xmath63 may be taken to be an @xmath0  basis , as in @xcite .    as a further example , suppose that @xmath14  is an independent copy of @xmath11  and let @xmath125 . in this case the autovariance function of the corresponding process @xmath82  of ( [ bss ] )  is given by @xmath126\\]]where @xmath127  is the autocorrelation function of @xmath120 , with@xmath128  which is a monotonely decreasing function of @xmath129 enabling direct lag identification .",
