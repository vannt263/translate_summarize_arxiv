    "an important problem in geometry and statistics is : given a convex compact space endowed with a metric , and randomly choosing two points in the space , find the probability density @xmath2 that these points have a specified separation @xmath0 .",
    "the study of this problem has a long history @xcite , and recently gained considerable impetus from researchers in cosmic crystallography @xcite-@xcite .    in a recent paper",
    "the functions @xmath2 corresponding to @xmath3 disks and rectangles were obtained @xcite .",
    "the methodology introduced in that work is here extended to a @xmath4 euclidian cube .",
    "an euclidian cube with side @xmath5 is assumed , occupying the location @xmath6 in a cartesian frame . randomly choosing two points @xmath7 and @xmath8 in the cube , we want the probability @xmath9 that the separation between the points lie between @xmath0 and @xmath10 .",
    "the probability density @xmath2 has to satisfy the normalization condition [ a1 ] _",
    "0^adl = 1 .",
    "the calculation can be shortened if one considers the symmetries of the cube .",
    "really , if the points @xmath7 and @xmath8 have been chosen , imagine the oriented segment @xmath11 parallel to @xmath12 , with the tip @xmath13 coinciding with the origin @xmath14 .",
    "the other tip @xmath15 then lies inside a larger cube , with side @xmath16 .",
    "since the probability density @xmath2 clearly does not depend on which octant of the large cube contains @xmath15 , there is no loose in generality in restricting the calculation to the cases where @xmath15 is in the octant @xmath6 .    with this assumption ,",
    "the point @xmath15 has cartesian coordinates b=(l , l , l ) , where both angles @xmath17 are bound to the interval @xmath18 $ ] ; here @xmath19 is the azimuthal angle , while @xmath20 is the polar angle measured from the @xmath21 plane .",
    "the corresponding tip @xmath8 in the original segment must lie inside a parallelepiped with sides ( see figure 1 ) [ a2 ] l_x:=a - l , l_y:=a - l , l_z:=a - l .",
    "the endpoint @xmath8 of the segment @xmath12 must lie inside the parallelepiped with a corner at @xmath22 ) .    the probability @xmath23 that the segment @xmath12 has length between @xmath0 and @xmath10 , azimuth between @xmath19 and @xmath24 , and polar angle between @xmath20 and @xmath25 is then [ a3 ] p(l , , ) dl d d=",
    "kl_xl_yl_z l^2 dl d d , where @xmath26 is a constant and where the assumption @xmath27 stands . performing the angular integrations we shall obtain [ a4 ] = ( l , , ) d d , and we finally fix @xmath26 using the condition ( [ a1 ] ) .    to calculate @xmath2 , three cases need be separately considered , depending on the value of @xmath0 relative to @xmath5 : namely the cases @xmath28 @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "as is seen in the figure 2 , in this case we effectively have @xmath32 and @xmath33 then [ a5 ] p(l < a)=kl^2_0^/2l_z d_0^/2l_xl_y d + [ a6 ] = [ 4a^3 - 6a^2l+8al^2-l^3 ] , where @xmath34 as will be fixed later on .     the triangular intersection of the @xmath3 sphere with radius @xmath0 and centre @xmath14 with the @xmath4 cube having side @xmath35 .",
    "in this case the intersection of the @xmath3 sphere ( with radius @xmath0 ) with the @xmath4 cube ( with side @xmath5 ) is an hexagonal surface as in figure 3 .     the hexagonal intersection of a @xmath3 sphere with radius @xmath0 and centre @xmath14 with a @xmath4 cube with a vertex in @xmath14 and having side @xmath5 such that @xmath37 .",
    "we note that the arcs of circle drawn on the faces @xmath38 have radius @xmath0 , while those drawn on the faces @xmath39 have radius @xmath40 .    for convenience of integration",
    "we divide the intersection into two regions . in region",
    "@xmath41 we have @xmath42 and @xmath43 .    in region",
    "@xmath44 we have @xmath45 and @xmath46 . to have @xmath47 we note that the circle drawn on the face @xmath48 satisfies the equation @xmath49 , so [ a7 ]",
    "_ min()=^-1()=:_1 ( ) . on the other hand , the circle drawn on the face @xmath50 satisfies @xmath51 , so we have [ a8 ] _ max()=^-1()=:_2 ( ) .",
    "we then find ( a < l < a ) = kl^2l_xl_yl_z [ a9 ] + = , [ a10 ] where @xmath34 as will be fixed later on .",
    "in this case the @xmath3 sphere with radius @xmath0 intersects the @xmath4 cube with side @xmath5 in the triangular surface shown in figure 4 .     the triangular intersection of a @xmath3 sphere with radius @xmath0 and centre @xmath14 with a @xmath4 cube with a vertex in @xmath14 and having side @xmath5 such that @xmath52 .    as before ,",
    "the circles drawn on the faces @xmath39 have radius @xmath40 .",
    "the azimuthal integration is performed between @xmath53 and @xmath54 as in the region @xmath44 of the preceding case , and again @xmath55 ; but now @xmath56 .",
    "we then find ( a < l < a)= kl^2_^-1(a / l)^^-1(a / l)l_zd__1()^_2()l_xl_yd[a11 ] + = , [ a12 ] where @xmath34 .",
    "this value for the constant @xmath26 derives from the normalization condition ( [ a5 ] ) , namely , [ a13 ] _ 0^a(l < a)dl+_a^a(a < l < a)dl+ _",
    "a^a(a < l < a)dl=1 .",
    "in figure 5 we present a graph of the dimensionless function @xmath57 against the dimensionless variable @xmath58 .",
    "the probability density @xmath2 of separation @xmath0 of pairs of randomly distributed points inside a cube with side @xmath5 .",
    "the irregular curve is the output of a corresponding computer simulation .",
    "we note that the function and its first derivative are continuous in the whole interval @xmath59 .",
    "nevertheless the second derivative is discontinuous at @xmath60 , as discussed in the next section . in the figure a normalized histogram corresponding to 150,000 separations between pairs of points randomly selected in the cube",
    "is superimposed , for comparison ; the agreement of the two curves evinces the correctness of the calculation .",
    "the integration to find @xmath2 in eqs .",
    "( [ a5])-([a6 ] ) is almost trivial ; however , not the same can be said about the two other cases , namely in going from ( [ a9 ] ) to ( [ a10 ] ) and from ( [ a11 ] ) to ( [ a12 ] ) .",
    "a computer assistance appears paramount in these two cases , to confirm every short step in the calculation and simplification of expressions .",
    "similarly as in @xcite , the probability density @xmath2 and its first derivative are continuous throughout the entire range @xmath59 .",
    "but the second derivative shows a finite discontinuity at @xmath60 , although it is continuous at @xmath61 .",
    "a remarkable feature of @xmath2 is its behaviour for large values of @xmath0 ; really , near @xmath62 we find [ a14 ] a=(-l / a)^5+o((-l / a)^6 ) , so @xmath2 is essentially a fifth power of @xmath63 .",
    "we find that 91% of the separations lie in the range @xmath64 , 9% lie in the interval @xmath65 , and only 0.04% have @xmath66 .",
