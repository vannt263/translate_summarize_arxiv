    "the recent results reported from the wmap cmb probe have provided a wealth of new precision data for cosmology and astrophysics . while some of the results have been anticipated by earlier ground - based anisotropy measurements ( @xcite ) ,",
    "several new and surprising claims have been made on the basis of the first year wmap data ( @xcite ) .",
    "particular attention has been paid to the facts that the power spectrum at low l ( large angle ) seems to differ somewhat from that predicted by a single power - law inflationary spectrum , and the fact that the epoch of reionization , presumably associated with the first period of star formation is at a surprisingly high redshift , corresponding to an age of approximately 200 myr .    at the same time , the wmap collaboration reported a tight measurement of the age of the universe , of @xmath0 gyr ( @xcite ) , by combining their data with earlier cmb and large scale structure data , supporting earlier cmb - derived age estimates ( @xcite ) ( note that all parameters we quote here are extracted from this `` best - fit '' analysis from wmap ) .    while the former two observations may force revisions in our thinking about the early universe , the latter measurement , combined with constraints on the age of globular clusters can provide new information on the formation of large scale structure , star formation , and the formation history of the milky way . in addition",
    ", one can put a new independent lower bound on the equation of state parameter , @xmath6 , for the dark energy that appears to dominate the universe .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "conventional wisdom , supported by estimates of relative ages of halo vs disk clusters , suggest that halo globular clusters formed during the earliest stages of the formation of our galaxy , before the primordial gas cloud dissipated energy and collapsed to form a disk .",
    "thus , determination of the age of the oldest globular clusters in the halo lead to a robust lower limit on the age of the universe ( i.e. see @xcite ) .    while globular cluster ages have thus presented a good lower bound on cosmic ages , they are less successful at providing an upper limit",
    "this is simply because there has been no easy way to directly determine what the maximum period between the big bang and the formation of our own galaxy actually is .",
    "measurements of cosmic structure formation have suggested that galaxy formation began in earnest at redshifts less than about 7 , but a minimum redshift at which it is highly likely that galaxies such as our will have formed is far less certain because no direct measurement of such a redshift has been possible .",
    "estimates in the range of @xmath7 are not unreasonable , and in a cosmological constant - dominated universe this could correspond to a cosmic age of 4 - 5 gyr .    by comparing wmap observations with previous estimates of globular cluster ages",
    ", one can derive provide important new handles to probe the likely formation of the milky way galaxy , and in a broader sense the formation of large scale cosmic structures .",
    "the two key wmap observations in this regard are the estimate of cosmic age ( @xmath8 gyr ) , and the redshift of reionization , at @xmath9 ( @xcite ) .    a recent comprehensive monte carlo analysis of the age of the oldest globular clusters that attempts to incorporate existing systematic uncertainties yields a 68@xmath10 lower confidence limit age of 11.2 gyr ( @xcite ) .",
    "comparing this with the 68@xmath10 upper limit on the age of the universe from wmap of @xmath11 gyr suggests an @xmath12 upper limit @xmath13 gyr as the time after the big bang that globular clusters in our galaxy first formed from the primordial halo of gas that ultimately collapsed to form the milky way . at the @xmath14 confidence level the limit becomes approximately 3 gyr .",
    "this not only improves upon previous estimates , it is the first direct constraint on this quantity .    of somewhat more interest is a determination of the most probable time after the big bang at which our globular clusters formed .",
    "now that wmap has determined a surprisingly early , if somewhat broad range of redshifts near @xmath15 where the universe reionized , corresponding to an age of about 200 myr after the big bang , it is interesting to know whether this corresponds to an early period of star formation , and whether structures as large as globular clusters of stars also formed this early . note that jimenez et al ( @xcite ) have recently assumed this to be the case .    a variety of different methods have been used to determine the age of globular clusters in our galaxy .",
    "the monte carlo analysis referred to above involves dating these clusters using main - sequence turnoff luminosity , and yields an age estimate for the oldest clusters at the 95@xmath10 confidence level of @xmath16 gyr .",
    "the most likely age for these globular clusters is thus @xmath17 800 myr younger than the wmap lower limit on the age of the universe .",
    "however , because the distribution is broad , the possibility that globular clusters formed before the period of cosmic reionization determined by wmap to occur @xmath17 200 myr after the big bang is certainly still viable ( @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , examining the probability distribution in @xcite , as fit analytically in @xcite , one finds a 75@xmath10 likelihood that the oldest globular clusters are in fact less than 13.5 gyr old .    while not compelling , the possibility that globular clusters in our galaxy may have formed well after reionization could shed light on a number of issues , including whether reionization is due to a very early generation of massive stars and whether such systems formed before ( and if so , how much before ) larger structures such as globular clusters",
    "this could probe the nature of possible hierarchical clustering .",
    "the likelihood of this possibility is increased when one recognizes that several other methods for determining the age of globular clusters , including using luminosity functions ( @xcite ) , white dwarf cooling ( @xcite ) and eclipsing binaries ( @xcite ) favor globular cluster ages in the range of 11 - 13 gyr .",
    "the existing uncertainty in globular cluster dating techniques is at present too large to do more than hint that there may be a gap in time between reionization in the universe and the formation of larger scale structures .",
    "however , this hint strongly motivates efforts to further reduce the absolute uncertainty in globular dating techniques .",
    "in particular , the possible use of the age - mass relation suggested by paczynski ( @xcite ) by observing eclipsing binaries in a number of different clusters holds great promise for reducing the absolute age uncertainty down to well below 1 gyr , which would be required in order to firmly resolve this question .",
    "ultimately , direct parallax distance measures to globular clusters will allow main sequence turnoff dating uncertainties to also fall below this level .",
    "determination of the distance - redshift relation made using distant type 1a supernovae ( @xcite ) , combined with independent estimates for both the mass density in the universe today , and the geometry of the universe from cmb measurements ( @xcite ) have definitively established the need for a dominant component to the energy budget that involves a negative pressure .",
    "an obvious candidate for this dark energy is a cosmological constant , with @xmath18 , but since we do not have any underlying theory for the dark energy one must allow for the possibility that @xmath19 ( @xcite ) .",
    "lagrangian models that have an equation of state of this form will be extremely exotic , implying for example , a negative kinetic term .",
    "in such models energy density of the dark energy will _ increase _ with time ! as a result , the hubble constant itself will continue to increase with time .",
    "age estimates can in principle give strong constraints on values of @xmath3 less than -1 , since the age of the universe is a strongly varying function of @xmath3 for values of @xmath20 ( @xcite ) . in the approximation of constant @xmath3 , which is a good approximation",
    "if @xmath3 is close to -1 , the age relation for a flat universe is given by : @xmath21^{1/2}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 is the fraction of the closure density in matter today , and @xmath23 is the fraction of the closure density in material with an equation of state parameter @xmath3 .",
    "we display in figs . 1 and 2 , the predicted age of the universe for various values of @xmath24 as a function of the hubble constant in comparison to the @xmath25 upper limit on the cosmic age from wmap , for two different values of the assumed matter density today(corresponding to midpoint of the wmap allowed range for matter density , and the @xmath25 upper limit ) .",
    "as is clear from these figures , for a flat universe the inferred bound on @xmath3 from the wmap cosmic age limit depends sensitively on the assumed total matter density today .",
    "it is important to realize however that one is not free to independently vary @xmath26 and @xmath27 in deriving bounds using the wmap data .",
    "these two quantities are themselves highly anti - correlated in the wmap fit ( @xcite ) . as can be seen from the wmap fits , as @xmath3 is decreased ( for @xmath28 ) , the allowed range of @xmath26 decreases linearly , while the allowed range of hubble constant increases linearly . if we assume this behavior extrapolates to values of @xmath19 , then we can use this relation to derive a conservative lower bound on @xmath3 .",
    "the most conservative bound on @xmath3 comes from assuming the largest allowed value of @xmath26 for any value of h. we fit this value using the anti - correlation described above , and fitting to the wmap plots to derive @xmath29 within the allowed range of h .",
    "when we include this relation explicitly for @xmath26 in the cosmic age relation , we derive limits on the age of the universe shown in fig .",
    "3 .    we use fig . 3 to derive a bound on @xmath3 .",
    "to do this we also note that that lower bound on h derived from wmap is correlated with the inferred value of @xmath3 .",
    "if we extrapolate the allowed range of h to values of @xmath24 , we find a lower bound on h as a function of @xmath3 shown by the thick solid line in this figure .",
    "if we use this lower bound on h , and compare the predicted age as a function of @xmath3 with the wmap upper limit , we derive a bound @xmath30 .",
    "if we were instead to allow the full hst range for h in deriving this limit , the lower bound would decrease slightly to @xmath31 .",
    "we emphasize that the bound we have derived here is conservative . a tighter bound",
    "would no doubt be possible if a truly global analysis of all the wmap data were carried out allowing @xmath19 , including possible correlations between the inferred wmap age and other cosmic parameters .",
    "we hope the wmap team will perform such an analysis .    for the moment",
    ", however , if one combines the result here with the wmap - derived upper bound on @xmath3 , one thus finds an allowed region @xmath32 .",
    "since the value @xmath18 is apparently favored within the limited range considered by the wmap team , it seems reasonable to combine our result with the wmap result to quote a best - fit range @xmath33 .",
    "it is interesting , but perhaps not surprising that the uncertainty is symmetric about the best fit value .",
    "it thus appears that @xmath3 is quickly becoming constrained to lie very close to the value it would have if the dark energy is provided by a fundamental cosmological constant , or else some scalar field whose energy density is stuck in a metastable state .",
    "thus , as for the case of a comparison between globular cluster ages and the cmb age described earlier , progress will require reducing existing uncertainties if we are to distinguish between interesting cosmological alternatives .",
    "the challenge for future observations that are sensitive to the value of @xmath3 will be to reduce the uncertainty significantly if we are ever to be able to distinguish between a possible cosmological constant from some other exotic forms of dark energy .",
