    "+ in the literature the change - point problem for linear models has been discussed extensively . while most of the contributions are made from an a - posteriori point of view ( we refer to , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite )",
    ", recently the sequential or on - line change - point detection has received more and more attention . @xcite",
    "give a bibliographical overview of the field of on - line statistical process control .",
    "+ the basis for this work is given in the articles of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite who suggest cumulative sum ( cusum ) procedures in different stochastic models .",
    "cusum procedures work best for relatively early changes but show a slower reaction the later the change occurs .",
    "@xcite provided the asymptotic normality of the suitably normalized stopping time of the cusum procedure in a similar setting as will be considered in this work but only in a relatively small range after the start of the monitoring .",
    "the procedures that will be developed here found on an idea of @xcite and should give a higher stability with respect to the time of change .",
    "other approaches that tackle this task are so - called moving sum ( mosum ) procedures that were studied by , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite . their drawback is a strong dependence on the choice of the parameters , in particular the right choice of the window size by the statistician . + for the applicability to , e.g. , financial problem settings we want to explicitly allow for certain dependencies , i.e.  we will include many of the commonly applied time series models for the error terms as well as for the regressors in our setting .",
    "other contributions assuming dependencies are given by , e.g. , @xcite who considered strongly mixing error terms in a linear model or @xcite who studied autoregressive time series in a closed - end setting .",
    "+ the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec2 ] the linear model and the underlying assumptions",
    "are introduced .",
    "section [ sec3 ] contains the definition of the detectors and stopping times as well as the results on the asymptotic distribution under the null hypothesis and the asymptotic consistency of the procedures . in section [ sec4 ] we will present a simulation study and the results of an application of the procedures to the aforementioned fama - french model .",
    "we conclude the paper with the proofs of our main results in section [ sec5 ] .",
    "consider the linear model : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a @xmath2 random vector and @xmath3 .",
    "+ we assume that for the first @xmath4 observations the so - called `` noncontamination assumption '' ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) holds , i.e. @xmath5 as mentioned before , the constancy of the regression parameters @xmath6 in time should be tested which leads to the null hypothesis @xmath7 the detection procedures to be presented here will be defined via stopping times @xmath8 ( the detailed definition is postponed to section [ sec3 ] of this article ) chosen in such a way that under the null hypothesis : @xmath9 and under the alternative @xmath10    we assume the following conditions on the regressors and the error terms : @xmath11 the above stated assumptions on the regressors and error terms are satisfied for a variety of important stochastic models . for examples we refer to @xcite who showed that [ 4 ] and [ 5 ] are satisfied for , e.g. , i.i.d .",
    "sequences , linear processes or augmented garch sequences .",
    "the latter were introduced by @xcite and include most of the conditionally heteroskedastic models used in practice . for a collection of examples belonging to this class",
    "we suggest the papers of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "concerning the error terms @xcite provided the proof of [ 7 ] again for augmented garch sequences under appropriate assumptions , @xcite give further examples , besides the i.i.d .",
    "case , including martingale difference sequences and stationary mixing sequences .",
    "+ all procedures treated in this work are based on the behavior of the residuals of the model @xmath12 where @xmath13 denotes a @xmath14-consistent estimator for @xmath15 from the data @xmath16 . in the sequel",
    "we will by @xmath17 denote a weakly consistent estimator for the parameter @xmath18 from assumption [ 7 ] .",
    "the estimation of this parameter will be discussed later in detail .",
    "many sequential detection procedures in the literature are constructed as first passage times of a so - called detector over a certain boundary function .",
    "for example @xcite proposed as a detector the ( ordinary ) cusum of the residuals , i.e. @xmath19 and @xmath20 such that holds .",
    "it should be noted that in the sequel of this article we use the convention @xmath21 for @xmath22 and all real @xmath23 .",
    "the first procedure we want to introduce goes back to an idea of @xcite and we define the detector @xmath24 the corresponding stopping time is then given by @xmath25 where @xmath26 and the constant @xmath27 in the definition of @xmath28 can be derived from theorem [ th2.1-ts ] below .",
    "[ th2.1-ts ] assume that , [ 4 ]  [ 7 ] and hold . then under the null hypothesis we have , for @xmath29 , @xmath30 where @xmath31 is a standard wiener process .",
    "@xcite proposed a detector of the type @xmath32 for one - sided change - in - the - mean alternatives . in the case of a linear model",
    "this detector is appropriate for alternatives with @xmath33 , where the vector @xmath34 was introduced in [ 5 ] .",
    "the corresponding asymptotic result under the null hypothesis for these one - sided detectors is given in theorem [ th2.1 ] .",
    "[ th2.1 ] assume that , [ 4 ]  [ 7 ] and hold . then under the null hypothesis we have , for @xmath29 , @xmath35 where @xmath31 is a standard wiener process .    from this result again",
    "the critical value @xmath36 can be derived for the two one - sided detectors .",
    "we will denote this critical value by @xmath37 and for the two - sided detector by @xmath38 . under the alternative hypothesis",
    "the detectors diverge as the following theorem shows .",
    "[ th2.2 ] assume that , [ 4 ]  [ 7 ] and hold .",
    "a.   then under @xmath39 and if @xmath40 we have @xmath41 b.   then under @xmath39 and if @xmath42 we have @xmath43 c.   then under @xmath39 and if @xmath44 we have @xmath45    theorem [ th2.2 ] gives a sufficient condition that guarantees . in section [ sec4 ] tables with simulated critical values for selected values of @xmath46 and @xmath47 can be found for the functionals @xmath48 under additional assumptions on the error terms we can modify the presented procedures which allows to drop these assumptions on the of change . in this context",
    "we want to refer to the work of @xcite who with the same intention developed monitoring procedures based on quadratic forms of weighted cumulative sums .",
    "+   + we analogously define the page detectors based on the cumulative sum of squared residuals via @xmath49 @xcite showed similar results on the squared prediction errors using the following additional assumptions : @xmath50 furthermore , they assumed that for every @xmath4 there exist independent wiener processes @xmath51 such that @xmath52 with some @xmath53 and @xmath54 from [ 15 ] . combining the techniques of @xcite and from the proof of theorem [ th2.1-ts ] it is obvious that similar asymptotic results hold for these procedures :    [ th3.4 ] assume that , [ 4 ]  [ 6 ] , , [ 14 ]  [ erg ] as well as and hold . then under the null hypothesis",
    "we have , for a real number @xmath55 and a standard wiener process @xmath31 , @xmath56    the parameter @xmath54 in the statement of theorem [ th3.4 ] can be replaced by a weakly consistent estimator @xmath57 .",
    "@xcite pointed out that the bartlett estimator @xmath58 for @xmath59 under the conditions of theorem [ th3.4 ] satisfies @xmath60 ( in probability ) and can therefore be applied in the general setting of this section .",
    "the same arguments hold for the estimation of @xmath18 .",
    "however , it should be noted that the quality of the estimators affects the finite sample behavior of the procedures . this will be discussed in section [ sec4 ] .    under the alternative hypothesis without additional assumptions on the of the change we again have the desired divergence .    [ th3.6]assume that , [ 4 ]  [ 6 ] , , [ 14 ]  [ erg - alt ] as well as and hold .",
    "then under @xmath39 we have @xmath61    analogous results to those of theorems [ th3.4 ] ( with the corresponding limit distributions from theorem [ th2.1 ] ) and [ th3.6 ] hold for the detectors @xmath62 ( and @xmath63 ) .",
    "however , as we will see in section [ sec4 ] , these show a poorer finite sample behavior than the detectors @xmath64 and @xmath65 . + one drawback of the detectors @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 is that the assumption on the existence of a constant @xmath18 is crucial to the testing procedure .",
    "it can be seen easily that , due to its construction , the procedure is also sensitive towards changes in @xmath18 , i.e.  in case of constant @xmath6 but a change in @xmath66 the testing procedure would decide that there has been a change in the @xmath6 with probability one .",
    "this sensitivity exists as well for the further introduced procedures , although in a weaker sense , i.e.  in the derivation of the critical values which is also strongly dependent on the assumption of a constant @xmath18 .",
    "but , since in general practitioners are concerned with the validity of their underlying model , the detection of a switch in the regime , including @xmath6 as well as @xmath18 , is of great interest to them .",
    "in this section the results of a simulation study are presented that was performed to confirm the theoretical results from section [ sec3 ] .",
    "furthermore it should show that the proposed monitoring procedures have the desired properties . with regard to the application to the fama - french model and its financial context",
    "the carried out simulations will focus on garch regressors .",
    "we will first consider the asymptotic results from section [ sec3 ] and provide the empirical sizes under the null hypothesis .",
    "a comparison of the detection properties of the different procedures in finite samples concludes the simulation study and highlights the advantages of the newly developed sequential tests .",
    "the last part of this section will then contain the results of an application of our monitoring procedures to a data set made publically available by kenneth r. french on his website ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . + to establish for the suggested procedures it is necessary to determine the critical values from the definition of @xmath28 in using the statements of theorems [ th2.1-ts ] , [ th2.1 ] and [ th3.4 ] .",
    "the critical values @xmath67 and @xmath68 for the functionals @xmath69 for selected values of @xmath46 and @xmath47 , can be found in table [ t1 ] and table [ t2 ] , respectively . these were simulated with 100,000 replications of an approximation of a wiener process generated on a grid of 100,000 points .",
    "@xcite provided the simulated critical values for the functional @xmath70 .",
    "for @xmath71 we calculated these critical values numerically using the series representation @xmath72 from , e.g. , @xcite , theorem 1.5.1 , to find :        j.  antoch and d.  jarukov . on - line statistical process control . in _",
