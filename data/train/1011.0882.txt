    "the concept of @xmath8mesic nuclei was introduced by liu and haider  @xcite .",
    "since the @xmath8meson has isospin  zero , the attraction noted for the @xmath8nucleon system should add coherently when the meson is introduced into a nuclear environment .",
    "on the basis of the rather small @xmath8nucleon scattering length @xmath9 assumed , they estimated that the lightest nucleus on which the @xmath8 might bind would be @xmath10c .",
    "experimental searches for the signals of such effects have generally proved negative , as for example in the @xmath11o@xmath12o@xmath13 reaction  @xcite .",
    "the larger @xmath14 subsequently advocated  @xcite means that the @xmath8 should bind tightly with such heavy nuclei , generating large and overlapping widths , and thus be hard to detect  @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", it also leads to the possibility of binding even in light systems , such as @xmath4he .",
    "therefore , very precise data on the  reaction near threshold have been taken at the cosy accelerator of the forschungszentrum jlich  @xcite .",
    "the obtained results confirm the energy dependence of the total cross section found in earlier experiments  @xcite , but with much finer steps in energy over an extended range .",
    "the measurements at the lowest excess energies @xmath1 ( the centre  of  mass kinetic energy in the @xmath4he system ) are of especial interest since they allow to gain detailed information about the final state interaction of the meson - nucleus system .",
    "the experiment was performed with a hydrogen cluster  jet target  @xcite using the anke spectrometer  @xcite placed at an internal station of the cooler synchrotron cosy  jlich . in case of the measurements very close to threshold",
    "the deuteron beam energy was ramped slowly and linearly in time , from an excess energy of @xmath15mev to @xmath16mev .",
    "in addition , for measurements at higher excess energies ( q = 19.5 , 39.4 and 59.4  mev ) three fixed values of the beam momentum were requested .",
    "the @xmath17he produced were detected in the anke forward detection system , which consists of two multi - wire proportional chambers , one drift chamber and three layers of scintillation hodoscopes .",
    "the geometrical acceptance for the @xmath17he of interest was @xmath18% , so that systematic uncertainties from acceptance corrections are negligible .",
    "the tracks of charged particles could be traced back through the precisely known magnetic field to the known interaction point , leading to a momentum reconstruction for registered particles .",
    "the luminosity required to determine cross sections was found by simultaneously measuring @xmath19 elastic scattering , with the scattered deuterons being registered in the forward detector and the proton reconstructed from the missing mass .",
    "the @xmath17he were selected by the @xmath20 method , with the @xmath8 meson being subsequently identified through a peak in the missing  mass distribution  @xcite . in order to determine the differential cross section for each excess energy , the whole range of the @xmath21 c.m .",
    "production angles was divided into individual angular bins and a missing - mass distribution constructed for each of them . the method to subtract the background below the peak of the @xmath8 meson",
    "is described in detail in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 total cross sections obtained at 195 bins in excess energy @xmath1 are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : cross ] . the minimal relative systematic errors resulting from the measurement of the excitation function in a single experiment form a robust data set for any phenomenological analysis .",
    "our data are broadly compatible with those of spesii  @xcite and any global difference is within our overall normalization uncertainty . however , in contrast to our data presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : cross]b , the spesii results do not define firmly the energy dependence in the near  threshold region .",
    "the total cross section reaches its maximum value within 0.5mev of threshold and hardly decreases after that .",

    "the gray curve is the spesii fit to their own data  @xcite .",
    "threshold data and fitted curve are shown in the inset , while the dotted curve is the result to be expected without the 180kev smearing in @xmath1.,width=476 ]    figure  [ dcs ] shows the angular distributions obtained at the three highest energies .",
    "also presented are the points measured in a missing - mass experiment by a celsius collaboration in the vicinity of @xmath23  mev and 40  mev , as well as those at 80  mev  @xcite .",
    "these are generally in agreement with the present results , though our data have smaller statistical error bars and cover the complete @xmath24 range .",
    "there is no sign of a forward dip at 19.5  mev and that any at 39.4  mev is much weaker than the one found at celsius .",
    "however , although the statistics were poorer and the number of points fewer , the celsius group also measured events where the @xmath8 meson was detected through its two photon decay in coincidence with the @xmath17he",
    ". these data also seemed to show less of a forward dip at both 20 and 40  mev  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ dcs ] also shows polynomial fits to our points .         reaction .",

    "since the cross section is proportional to the absolute square of the amplitude , much phase information is thereby lost . however , as will be shown the interference between the @xmath5 and @xmath6waves , as seen in the newly published angular distributions  @xcite , leads to the required confirmation .",

    "momenta of the incident proton and final @xmath8meson , respectively . however , one striking feature of fig .",
    "[ angas ] is that , although @xmath28 rises sharply with @xmath30 , it only does so from about 40mev / c instead of from the origin , as one might expect on the basis of the above kinematic argument . at low values of @xmath30",
    "the error bars are necessarily large and @xmath28 might even to go negative in this region .",
    "this feature is not inconsistent with the results of other measurements  @xcite that have different systematic uncertainties and so it is possibly a genuine effect .",
    "part of this non  linear behaviour arises from the steep decrease in the magnitude of the @xmath5wave amplitude with momentum . however , the size of the effect observed can only arise through the rapid variation of the phase of this amplitude , of the type generated by a nearby pole in the complex @xmath1 plane .",
    "there are two independent  @xmath5wave amplitudes ( @xmath34 and @xmath35 )  @xcite and five @xmath6wave though , to discuss the data phenomenologically , we retain only the two ( @xmath36 and @xmath37 ) that give a pure @xmath24 dependence in the cross section .",
    "the production operator @xmath38 has to be sandwiched between @xmath17he and proton spinors . here",
    "@xmath39 is the polarisation vector of the deuteron .",
    "the corresponding unpolarised differential cross section depends upon the spin - averaged value of @xmath40 @xmath41 using the amplitudes of eq .",

    "bound pole should affect the two @xmath5wave amplitudes @xmath34 and @xmath35 in a similar way and some evidence for this is to be found from the deuteron tensor analysing power @xmath44 , which is small and seems to change little , if at all , from near threshold to their measurement limit 16.6mev above threshold  @xcite . as a consequence , @xmath45 throughout our range of interest and it is plausible to represent the data using a spin  average amplitude .",

    "the error on @xmath48 is dominated by the 15% luminosity uncertainty  @xcite .",
    "note that only the first pole ( at @xmath49 ) is of physical significance and for this unitarity requires that @xmath50 .",
    "the signs of the imaginary parts of the pole positions are not defined by the data . as will be seen later ,",
    "the position of the first pole remains stable when fitting simultaneously the angular dependence and the total cross section .",
    "in contrast , the second pole is introduced to parametrise the residual energy dependence , which can arise from the reaction mechanism as well as from a final  state interaction .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : fsi2 ] ) shows an @xmath5wave amplitude whose phase and magnitude vary quickly with @xmath30 , but we expect that , apart from the momentum factor , the @xmath6wave amplitudes should be fairly constant . in the absence of detailed analysing power information , we take @xmath51 and @xmath52 to be a complex constant . with these assumptions",

[ angas ] and fig .  [ sigt ] , which gives a much poorer overall description of the near - threshold data though the position of the pole in the @xmath7he scattering amplitude , corresponding to the quasi - bound or virtual state , is hardly changed .",
    "since the overall phase is unmeasurable , it is permissable to take the @xmath48 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : fsi2 ] ) to be real . furthermore , because of the interference between the @xmath5 and @xmath6waves , the relative phases of @xmath36 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 do now influence the observables , though the differential cross section remains unchanged if the signs of all the imaginary parts are reversed .",
    "compared to the original solution , where the effects of the @xmath6waves were neglected  @xcite , the position of the nearby pole @xmath59 is little changed .",
    "this is hardly surprising because this parameter is mainly fixed by the data from a region which is dominated by the @xmath5waves .",
    "less expected is the very modest change in the position of @xmath60 , which could have been affected more by the introduction of @xmath36 . as a consequence ,",
    "the @xmath4he scattering length is also changed only marginally to @xmath61fm , where the two signs of @xmath62 again reflect the possibility of either a quasi  bound or a virtual state .",
    "these results nicely explain the strong decrease of the scattering amplitude squared extracted from the data obtained at anke as function of the @xmath8 c.m .  momentum ( fig .",
    "[ slope ] ) .",
    "the anke data indicate that the @xmath5wave amplitude for undergoes a very rapid change of phase in the near  threshold region of the type expected from the presence of a quasi  bound or virtual @xmath4he state",
