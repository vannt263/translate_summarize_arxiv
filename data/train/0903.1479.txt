    "to summarize , following the theoretical description@xcite of the spin bose - metal phase in the triangular strip spin-1/2 model with ring exchanges , we discussed the effects due to different types of impurities .",

    "the decoupled cluster is likely to be non - magnetic , while in the site - symmetric case it has half - integer spin , and the details of such fixed points depend on the microscopic details.@xcite this analysis also motivated appropriate boundary conditions for pinning the fields in the fixed point theory for the semi - infinite systems .",

    "the susceptibilities at @xmath51 actually _ increase _ with the distance from the boundary in the limit of zero temperature ( and zero field ) , while the susceptibility at @xmath22 becomes distance - independent .",
    "transfer - matrix density - matrix renormalization group ( tmrg ) @xcite technique can measure local susceptibility at finite temperature and can be useful for exploring the susceptibility near defects in numerical studies",
    ". the rate of increase at @xmath51 is slower than in the 1d chain,@xcite but would still produce strong nmr line broadening at low temperatures . of course , this is the result for the long - distance behavior along the 1d direction .",
    "if we are thinking about the 2d spin liquid , we would likely expect a power - law decay away from an impurity.@xcite nevertheless , the persistence of the oscillating susceptibilities on the quas-1d ladders suggests that in the 2d case the decay may be slow and also produce significant inhomogeneous line broadening .",
