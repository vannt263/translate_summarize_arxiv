    "modern technology relies more and more on the ability of building microscopic devices based on carefully designed nano - structured materials .",
    "for example , engineered stacks of differently doped semiconductors are used in modern transistors and ( nano - structured ) dielectrics with different indices of refraction are used to guide light in the most exotic ways .",
    "a special class of nano - structures consists of alternating metallic and insulating layers arranged into one - dimensional periodic lattices .",
    "when carefully designed such combinations of plasmonic and dielectric materials lead  within the effective medium limit  to effective hyperbolic dispersion relations @xcite that may be exploited for a number of applications such as subwavelength imaging @xcite , strong nonlinearities @xcite , emission engineering @xcite , and many more .",
    "the dispersion relations of these fictitious , spatially uniform hyperbolic meta - materials ( hmms ) , support radiative modes with infinitely large wave vectors which , in turn , lead to broadband super - singularities of the local photonic density of states dos ( ldos ) .",
    "it has been recognized that in the actual nano - structure ( i.e. , without the effective medium description ) these singularities become regularized ( i ) by the fact that for sufficiently large wave - vector values the actual lattice - structure will be resolved @xcite and ( ii ) via the nonlocal properties of the metallic constituents @xcite .",
    "the ldos itself can be obtained from the electromagnetic green s tensor of the relevant structure . in turn",
    ", the ldos modifies the spontaneous decay rate of an emitter and the corresponding so - called purcell factor can be determined from the electromagnetic green s tensor @xcite .",
    "most of the above computations , however , have ignored the effects of local - field corrections in the dielectric layers , despite the fact that these corrections , too , may significantly contribute to the decay dynamics of the emitter .",
    "therefore , in the present work , we include these effects into the green s tensor formalism and provide a comprehensive study of the non - additive interplay between the above regularization mechanisms and the local - field corrections on the luminescence properties of emitters embedded in finite - sized and infinitely extended layered hmm - type structures .",
    "besides the aforementioned modified decay rates , this also includes frequency shifts that emitters experience when being embedded in such structures .",
    "in addition , we study these effects in the context of different material models for the nonlocal optical properties of the plasmonic constituents and identify analogies and differences in the results .",
    "the dynamical properties of emitters are correlated with the environment surrounding them . in particular , the decay rates from excited states or the intrinsic transition frequencies depend on the ldos associated with the electromagnetic environment . since the latter is strongly correlated with the geometry and the optical properties of the objects filling the space around the emitter , it is not surprising that an appropriate choice of these two characteristics can lead to enhancement or suppression of decay rates as well as to frequency shifts of transitions with respect to their vacuum ( empty space ) values .",
    "even strong non - markovian effects can be realized @xcite . in this section",
    "we briefly review the general approach for computing decay rates and frequency shifts of emitters that are embedded in an arbitrary electromagnetic environment .",
    "we will focus first on the spontaneous decay and calculate the ( purcell ) enhancement factor . within the standard theory for a simple two - level emitter with transition frequency @xmath0 located at @xmath1 , an emitter s transition rate is given by @xcite @xmath2                                                               \\right ] \\label{spontan}\\ ] ] here ,",

    "is well defined and has been studied by many authors . in this case",

    "things are , however , more complicated .",
    "the corresponding green s tensor can be obtained by the formal replacement @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the dielectric function describing the medium . from simple considerations",

    ", with the green s tensor given by eq .",
    "for a homogeneous dielectric medium , even a minute amount of _ dissipation _ would lead to a divergent decay rate .",
    "physically , this difficulty can be understood by thinking that in a continuum approximation , resulting from a macroscopic average , the emitter can superpose with an atom of the dielectric leading to a divergent interaction @xcite .",
    "the spontaneous decay of an emitter embedded in a dielectric medium thus represents an example of how dissipation can substantially complicate the theory of quantum phenomena . for the realistic description of spontaneous decay processes we have to take into account that the electromagnetic field `` seen '' by an emitter that is embedded in a medium is _ not _ given by solutions of the _ macroscopic _ maxwell equations . rather , the fields provided by macroscopic electrodynamics are the result of spatial averages where materials are described as continuous entities characterized by permittivities and permeabilityies . at the microscopic level",
    "the `` granular '' structure of the medium becomes important and the _ local field _ felt by the emitter can be rather different from the result of the macroscopic averaging procedure . in turn , this may have a very significant impact on the emitters dynamics , notably if they are exposed to multiple scattering effects originating from a complex nano - structured environment . in order to treat the local - field problem ,",
    "one can distinguish two different cases @xcite : ( a ) the emitter is of the same species as the atoms ( or molecules ) that constitute the host medium or ( b ) the emitter is of a different species as the host medium , i.e. , an impurity , a substitution etc . in both cases ( and even for non - dissipative media ) , the spontaneous decay is non - trivially modified with respect to the result for vacuum presented above .",
    "the first scenario is described within the virtual - cavity model @xcite , where the green s tensor is appropriately modified to remove all unphysical divergences .",
    "the second scenario is treated within the onsager real - cavity model where the emitter is thought to be placed in vacuum at the center of a spherical cavity carved into the host medium @xcite , where the cavity radius is essentially given by the distance to the next atom ( molecule ) of the dielectric ( see fig .

    "this allows us to identify vacuum as the homogeneous medium required for the homogeneous green s tensor , i.e. , we have @xmath22 .",
    "further , the tensor @xmath23 represents the scattered green s tensor and takes into account the multiple scattering processes due to the material interfaces in the nano - structure . for simple geometries",
    "the expressions for @xmath23 are well - known and have been reported in the literature ( we refer to @xcite and our discussion of layered systems below )",
    ". in the local - field corrected green s tensor within the framework of the real - cavity model , the emitter is placed in vacuum enclosed at the center of a spherical cavity with radius @xmath24 much smaller than the optical wavelength ( @xmath25 ) . in our specific case of alternating metallic and dielectric layers , this spherical local - field cavity with the emitter in its center",
    "is located inside a central dielectric layer with permittivity @xmath26 sandwiched between a finite or infinite number of further layers on either side .",

    "for instance , while the hydrodynamic model only exhibits nonlocal modifications to the longitudinal part of the electromagnetic field , the scib predicts nonlocal modifications for both the longitudinal and the transverse part of the field .",
    "probably the most apparent difference between the two models concerns the boundary conditions at the interface . while the scib model relies on the symmetries of the boltzmann equation to determine the behavior of electrons at an interface with dielectric materials , the hydrodynamic description uses the non - locality to implement a finite density of electrons at the interface which removes the discontinuity in the @xmath41-component of the displacement field .         despite these differences ,",
    "the two non - local models provide qualitatively similar results for the reflection coefficients of the infinitely periodic structures and of a thin silver slab embedded in silica matrix . in fig .",
    "[ imrps ] we represent the imaginary part of the corresponding reflection coefficients for the p- and s - polarization .",
    "the quantities are plotted as functions of the lateral wave - vector for a fixed frequency ( @xmath175 ) .",
    "we note that for the periodic structure the usual effective medium approach ( ema ) in terms of a local dielectric functions @xcite provides a good description of the system for sufficiently small wave - vectors ( see fig.[imrps ] ) @xcite .",
    "as expected , @xcite the agreement degrades at larger wave - vectors .",

    "[ imrps ] ) coincides with the surface - plasmon - polariton ( spp ) of a silica / metal interface @xmath177 the thin single metallic layer exhibits two resonances associated with the symmetric and antisymmetric coupling of the spps on the two metal / silica interfaces ( @xmath178 and @xmath179 , see top right panel of fig .",

    "smaller than @xmath127 and small thickness the resonances positions are approximatly given by    @xmath180    @xmath181^{2}+\\frac{\\omega^{2}}{c^{2}}\\epsilon(\\omega ) } ~.\\ ] ]    which correspond to the values for the symmetric ( near the light cone ) and anti - symmetric spps .",
    "the anti - symmetric resonance is much stronger than the symmetric resonance .",
    "it is also worth noting that for the anti - symmetric spp the scib gives rise to a value which is different from the value for the local and the hydrodynamic description . for s - polarized radiation ,",
    "the behavior is much simpler and the nonlocality only slightly affects the reflection coefficients . in all cases ,",
    "a characteristic abrupt change occurs at the light cone , i.e. for @xmath182 .",
    "we now apply the above formalism to study the modified radiation dynamics of an emitter embedded in two distinct structures .",
    "the first structure consists of a central cavity silica layer ( @xmath183 ) that is symmetrically sandwiched between infinite sequences of bilayers of silver ( @xmath184 ) and silica ( @xmath185 ) as depicted in fig .",
    "[ modulatedregionhh ] .",
    "the second structure comprises the same central cavity silica layer that is symmetrically sandwiched between two silver layers with thickness @xmath186 and this composite slab - structure is embedded into two half spaces of silica .",
    "the dielectric properties of silica are described via a three - oscillator model @xcite and we consider the above - discussed and widely used material models for silver , i.e. , the local drude model , the scib model and the hydrodynamic model .",
    "all these models employ the same plasma frequency @xmath187 ev ( @xmath188 nm ) and damping constant @xmath189 ev .",
    "additionally , the scib model and the hydrodynamic model use the fermi velocity @xmath190 m / s ) of silver @xcite . in both of the above structures ,",
    "we position an emitter midway in the cavity layer ( @xmath191 ) and the radius of the real - cavity model for the local field correction is @xmath192 .      in fig .",
    "[ orthpar ] we depict the results of the spontaneous emission enhancement factor for a dipole oriented orthogonal and parallel to the stacking direction of the above - described infinite periodic structure . for comparison",
    ", we have also included the results of computations where silica has been replaced by vacuum ( or air ) .",
    "as expected , the nonlocal material models lead to a slight blue shift of the main plasmon resonance around @xmath193 relative to the local drude model .",
    "the decay rates essentially follow the dispersion relation of the surface plasmons coupled across the cavity containing the emitter . from the expressions of the orthogonal and parallel components of the green s tensor in eqs .",
    "one deduces that the orthogonal enhancement is associated with the dispersion relation of the anti - symmetric cavity surface plasmon while the behavior of the parallel enhancement can be associated with the dispersion relation of the symmetric cavity surface plasmon @xcite : the integrals in eqs .",
    "can be approximatively evaluated as the residues for the corresponding cavity plasmon . upon using dimension less variables @xmath194 and @xmath195 in eqs .",
    ", one can infer that the behavior at low frequencies is equivalent to a reduction of the distance between the emitter and the interface explaining the large enhancement of the decay . in this same region ( @xmath196 )",
    "the hydrodynamic model gives results very similar to the local description while the scib model produces slightly a different prediction ( more pronounced when we use silica instead of vacuum for the dielectric layer ) . at frequencies higher than the plasma frequency",
    ", we observe additional resonances for the nonlocal materials models .",
    "these resonances corresponds to the excitation of bulk plasmons which are known to appear in nonlocal descriptions of the metal beyond the plasma frequency @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that while these bulk plasmon resonances occur at roughly the same positions for the scib and the hydrodynamic model ( a shift appears at large frequencies ) they are much less pronounced and wider for the scib model ( see fig.[bulkortslab ] ) .",
    "approximately , the bulk plasmon resonances are given by @xmath197    in the hydrodynamic description only the odd frequencies couple to the external radiation @xcite while the even resonances are almost decoupled from the external field and can be excited only minimally ( see fig.[bulkortslab ] ) .",
    "we observe a similar behavior for the scib model with the exception of the lowest bulk plasmon frequency @xmath198 : in the hydrodynamic model this resonance lies in a band gap which forbids any propagation @xcite .",
    "the situation is different for the model based on the boltzmann equation , where we clearly observe a resonance at @xmath198 .    ,",
    "width=313 ]     and depicted as a functions of the emitter s transition frequency .",
    "the different curves correspond to different material models for silver : the local drude model ( purple dashed line ) , the nonlocal hydrodynamic model ( red solid line ) and the scib model based on the boltzmann equation ( blue solid line ) .",
    "see the text for details regarding the geometric and material parameters . in order to highlight the impact of the local - field corrections ,",
    "the same computations have been carried out for the same parameters except for replacing silica by vacuum .",
    "the results are depicted in the semi - transparent curves .",
    "the local - field corrections significantly reduce the magnitude of these geometry - induced shifts relative to vacuum .",
    "[ freqshift],width=313 ]    the differences between the nonlocal models are directly connected to the different ways the wave vector ( non - locality ) and dissipation enter in eqs . and",
    "with respect to eqs . and , clearly , also to the different boundary conditions discussed in section [ nonlocal ] .",
    "therefore , experimental studies on the spontaneous emission enhancement in such systems for frequencies above the plasma frequency may be able to probe the nature of the plasmonic material .    upon comparing the results for vacuum with those of silica as the dielectric material , the offset originating from the local - field corrections and",
    "the red - shift of the curves as well as of the spp resonance is clearly visible .",
    "again , this ( expected ) behavior can be understood in connection with the dispersion relation of the symmetric and anti - symmetric cavity surface plasmons which are expected to red - shift in presence of the dielectrics .",
    "furthermore , the local - field corrections lead to a rather significant broadening of the main plasmon resonance characteristics .",
    "conversely , the positions of the bulk plasmon resonances are not affected by the local field correction and there hardly is any additional broadening for both models . instead",
    ", we observe a reduction in the peak hight .",
    "in addition , in fig . [ freqshift ] we display the results for the geometrical frequency shift experienced by the emitter in the above - discussed infinite structure .",
    "owing to the fact that this shift results from an integration over imaginary frequencies ( c.f .",
    ", no characteristic features resulting from plasmon resonances are visible and the results for the local drude model and the nonlocal models are very similar and this is in agreement with previous works @xcite . also , the differences between the scib and the hydrodynamic description are less prominent and both models essentially provide the same result",
    "nevertheless , the local - field corrected computations for silica yield geometry - induced shifts that are significantly reduced with respect to the computations for vacuum .",
    "this is the result of an effective screening provided by the dielectric material .      in fig .",
    "[ orthparslab ] , we display the spontaneous emission enhancement factor for a dipole oriented orthogonal and parallel to the stacking direction of the above - described slab structure . for comparison , we have included the results of computations where silica has been replaced by vacuum ( or air ) .",
    "also in this case the enhancement factor shows the features described above . as before ,",
    "we observe the characteristic blue - shift of the main plasmon resonance between the local drude description and the nonlocal descriptions for the plasmonic layers as well as the occurence of bulk plasmon resonances for frequencies above the plasma frequency , strong resonances for the hydrodynamic model and weak resonances for the scib model .",
    "similarly , the comparison of the local - field corrected computations for silica with the computations for vacuum reveal that in the case of silica the main plasmon resonance is much broader and the bulk plasmon resonance peaks are suppressed .",
    "however , we would like to note that the enhancement values generally are much larger than for the infinite system discussed above .",
    "this is for our specific choice of geometric parameters the resonance in the reflection coefficient for the thin slab are much stronger as compared to the infinitely layered system ( see fig .",
    "[ imrps ] ) .",
    "finally , in the composite silica - silver slab system for frequencies @xmath196 , we observe again differences between the emission enhancements related to the nonlocal scib description and to the hydrodynamic model .",
    "this occurs for both dipole s orientation whereas for these frequencies , the results of the hydrodynamic model agrees rather well with those of the drude model . in this case",
    "we can connect this behavior with the features of the p - reflection coefficient in fig .",
    "[ imrps ] .    in summary , we have developed a comprehensive framework for computing decay enhancements and level shifts for emitters embedded in arbitrary layered structures .",
    "this framework is capable of including local - field corrections in ( weakly absorbing ) dielectric systems and can treat the nonlocal optical properties of metals .",
    "all these features influence the emitters s dynamic in a non - additive way , which is also amplified by the relative complexity of the surrounding structure .",
    "nevertheless we were able to show that the local - field corrections generally introduce an offset in the spontaneous decay rates and lead to broadening of plasmon resonances below the plasma frequency .",
    "in addition , local - field corrections effectively reduce geometry - induced level shifts .",
    "furthermore , we have found that the differences between the different material models for metals can be analyzed either by changing the dielectric material between the metal layers or by carefully inspecting the decay rates for frequencies above the plasma frequency .",
    "while this may be unrealizable for silver - based structures , we would like to point out that recent advances in highly - doped semiconductors place their plasma frequency in the near infrared @xcite , thus rendering such investigations experimentally feasible .",
