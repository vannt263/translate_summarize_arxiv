    "key distribution is one of the most important and challenging problem in cryptology .",
    "when a sender wants to transmit a confidential message to a receiver , the sender usually encipher the message by using a secret key that is only available to the sender and the receiver . for a long time , many methods have been proposed to solve the key distribution problem .",
    "one of the most broadly used method in the present day is a method whose security is based on difficulties to solve some mathematical problems , such as factorization into prime numbers .",
    "such kind of method is believed to be practically secure , but it has not been proved to be unconditionally secure ; there might exist some clever algorithm to solve those mathematical problems efficiently . on the other hand , quantum key distribution ( qkd ) , which is the main theme of this thesis , has attracted the attention of many researchers , for the reason that its security is based on principles of the quantum mechanics . in other word , the qkd is secure as long as the quantum mechanics is correct .",
    "the concept of the quantum cryptography was proposed by wiesner in 1970s .",
    "unfortunately , his paper was rejected by a journal , and was not published until 1983 @xcite . in 1980s ,",
    "the quantum cryptography was revived by bennett _",
    "et al_.  in a series of papers @xcite . especially , the quantum key distribution first appeared in bennett and brassard s one page proceedings paper @xcite presented at a conference , although it is more commonly known as bb84 from its 1984 full publication @xcite .",
    "at first , the security of the bb84 protocol was guaranteed only in the ideal situation such that the channel between the sender and receiver is noiseless .",
    "later , bennett _",
    "et al_.  proposed modified protocols to handle the case in which the channel between the sender and the receiver is not necessarily noiseless @xcite . during the course of their struggle against the problem ,",
    "many important concepts such as the information reconciliation and the privacy amplification , which are explained in detail later , were proposed @xcite . finally , mayers proposed his version of the bb84 protocol , and showed its unconditional security @xcite ( preliminary versions of his proof were published in @xcite ) .",
    "et al_.  also proposed their version of the bb84 protocol and showed its unconditional security @xcite .    in 2000 , shor an preskill made a remarkable observation on mayer s security proof of the bb84 protocol @xcite .",
    "they observed that the entanglement distillation protocol ( edp ) @xcite with the css code , one of the quantum error correcting codes proposed by calderbank , shor , and stean @xcite , is implicitly used in mayer s version of the bb84 protocol , and presented a simple proof of mayer s version of the bb84 protocol .",
    "their proof technique based on the css code is further extended to some directions .",
    "for example , lo @xcite proved the security of another qkd protocol , the six state protocol proposed by bru  @xcite , by using the technique based on the css code .",
    "recently , renner _",
    "et al_.  @xcite developed information theoretical techniques to prove the security of the qkd protocols including the bb84 protocol and the six - state protocol .",
    "their proof method provides important insight into the security proof of the qkd protocols .",
    "more precisely , they proved the security of the qkd protocols by extending the key agreement in the information theory @xcite , which will be explained in the next section , to the context of the qkd protocols .    in this thesis , we employ renner _",
    "et al_. s approach for the security proof of the qkd protocols instead of shor and preskill s approach .",
    "then , we investigate two important phases , the channel estimation and the postprocessing , of the qkd protocols .",
    "the qkd protocol roughly consists of three phases : the bit transmission phase , the channel estimation phase , and the postprocessing phase . in the bit transmission phase , the legitimate sender , usually referred to as alice sends a bit sequence to the legitimate receiver , usually referred to as bob , by encoding them into quantum carrier ( eg .",
    "polarizations of photons ) .",
    "the channel estimation phase will be explained in section [ sec : the - role ] . in the postprocessing phase ,",
    "alice and bob share a secret key based on their bit sequences obtained in the bit transmission phase .",
    "the postprocessing phase can be essentially regarded as the key agreement problem in the information theory , which will be explained in the next section .",
    "following shannon s mathematical formulation of the cryptography @xcite and the studies on confidential message transmissions over noisy channels by wyner @xcite and csisar and krner @xcite , the problem of the key agreement in the information theory was formulated by maurer @xcite , and was also studied by ahlswede and csisar @xcite .    in maurer s formulation alice and bob",

    "correlated binary ) . ] random variables @xmath0 and @xmath1 respectively , and the eavesdropper , usually referred to as eve , has a sequence of i.i.d .",
    "random variables @xmath2 , which are regarded as the information she obtained by eavesdropping @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "they conduct a postprocessing procedure and share a secret key by using the pair of bit sequence @xmath5 as a seed .    in the postprocessing procedure ,",
    "alice and bob are allowed to exchange messages over the authenticated public channel , that is , eve can know every message transmitted over this channel but she can not tamper or forge a message . actually , the authenticated public channel can be realized if alice and bob initially share a short secret key @xcite . in the rest of this thesis , we assume that the public channel is always authenticated though we do not mention it explicitly .",
    "the communication over the public channel in the postprocessing procedure may be one - way ( from alice to bob . ] ) or two - way .",
    "the most elementary postprocessing procedure is a procedure with one - way public communication , and it consists of two procedures , the information reconciliation procedure and the privacy amplification procedure .    the purpose of the information reconciliation procedure for alice and bob is to agree on a bit sequence from their correlated bit sequences .",
    "this procedure is nothing but the slepian - wolf coding scheme @xcite . in this scheme",
    ", alice sends the compressed version @xmath6 ( say @xmath7 bit data ) of @xmath3 to bob .",
    "then , bob reproduce @xmath8 by using his bit sequence @xmath4 and the received data @xmath6 .",
    "it is well known that bob can reproduce alice s bit sequence with negligible error probability if alice sends appropriate @xmath9 bits data .",
    "the purpose of the privacy amplification procedure for alice and bob is to distill secret keys from their bit sequences shared in the information reconciliation procedure .",
    "more specifically , alice and bob distill @xmath10 bits ( usually much shorter than @xmath11 bit ) secret key by using appropriate function from @xmath11 bit to @xmath10 bit .",
    "we require the secret keys to be information theoretically secure , i.e. , the distilled key is uniformly distributed and statistically independent from eve s available information @xmath6 and @xmath12 .",
    "since the pair of bit sequences initially shared by alice and bob are considered as a precious resource , we desire the _ key generation rate _ @xmath13 to be as large as possible . especially in this paper",
    ", we investigate the asymptotic behavior of the key generation rate , _ asymptotic key generation rate _",
    ", such that the secure key agreement is possible .",
    "roughly speaking ) can be slightly generalized as @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are auxiliary random variables such that @xmath16 , @xmath15 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 form a markov chain in this order .",
    "although the meaning of the auxiliary random variables have been unclear for a long time , recently renner _",
    "et al_.  clarified the meaning of @xmath15 as the noisy preprocessing in the context of qkd protocol @xcite ( see also remark [ remark : noisy - preprocessing ] ) . ] , the secure key can be distilled if the key generation rate is smaller than eve s ambiguity ( per bit ) about the bit sequence after the information reconciliation , that is , @xmath19    in @xcite , maurer also proposed a postprocessing procedure with two - way public communication . more specifically , he proposed a preprocessing called _ advantage distillation _ that is conducted before the information reconciliation procedure . in the advantage distillation",
    ", alice divides her bit sequence into blocks of length @xmath20 , and sends the parity @xmath21 of each block to bob .",
    "bob also divides his bit sequence into blocks of length @xmath20 , and tells alice whether the received parity of the @xmath22th block coincides with bob s corresponding parity @xmath23 .",
    "if their corresponding parities coincide , they keep the second bits of those blocks , which are regarded to have strong correlation . otherwise , they discard those blocks , which are regarded to have weak correlation .",
    "maurer showed that the key generation rate of the postprocessing with the advantage distillation can be strictly higher than the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : heuristic - key - generation - rate ] ) in an example .    in the context of the qkd protocol , the postprocessing procedure with both one - way and two - way",
    "public communication were considered . actually , the postprocessing procedure with one - way public communication were first studied @xcite . later",
    ", the postprocessing with the advantage distillation in the context of qkd protocol was proposed by gottesman and lo @xcite .",
    "the postprocessing with the advantage distillation was extensively studied by bae and acn @xcite .    in chapter",
    "[ ch : postprocessing ] , we propose a new kind of postprocessing procedure with two - way public communication in the context of qkd protocol .",
    "the purpose of the advantage distillation was to divide the blocks into highly correlated ones and weakly correlated ones by exchanging the parities .",
    "the key idea of our proposed postprocessing is that the parities in the conventional advantage distillation is redundantly transmitted over the public channel , and should be compressed by the slepian - wolf coding because bob s bits @xmath24 is correlated to alice s parity @xmath21 . in our proposed postprocessing",
    ", alice does not sends the parities itself , but she sends the compressed version of the parities by regarding bob s sequence @xmath4 as the side - information at the decoder .",
    "this enables alice and bob to extract a secret key also from the parity sequence , and improves the key generation rate . actually , the key generation rate of the qkd protocols with our proposed postprocessing procedure is as high as that with conventional one - way or two - way postprocessing procedures .",
    "we also clarify that the former is strictly higher than the latter in some cases .",
    "in the previous section , we have explained the mathematical formulation of the key agreement in the information theory .",
    "then , we have explained the fact that alice and bob have to set the key generation rate according eve s ambiguity about the bit sequence after the information reconciliation procedure ( eq .",
    "( [ eq : heuristic - key - generation - rate ] ) ) ) . ] in order to share an information theoretically secure key .",
    "however , alice and bob can not calculate the amount of eve s ambiguity about the bit sequence if they do not know the probability distribution @xmath25 of their initial bit sequence and eve s available information .",
    "therefore , they have to estimate the probability distribution itself , or at least they have to estimate a lower bound on the quantity @xmath26 only involves the marginal distribution @xmath27 , alice and bob can easily estimate it by sacrificing a part of their bit sequence as samples .",
    "therefore , we restrict our attention to the quantity @xmath26 . ] .",
    "if alice and bob s bit sequences @xmath28 are distributed by using a classical channel , for example the standard telephone line or the internet , then a valid estimate will be the trivial one , @xmath29 , because eve can eavesdrop as much as she want without being detected .",
    "the qkd protocols provide a way to estimate a non - trivial lower bound on @xmath26 by using the axioms of the quantum mechanics .    in the bb84 protocol",
    ", alice randomly chooses a bit sequence and send it by encoding each bit into a polarization of a photon .",
    "when she encodes each bit into a polarization of a photon , she chooses one of two encoding rules at random . in the first encoding rule ,",
    "she encodes @xmath29 into the vertical polarization , and @xmath30 into the horizontal polarization . in the second encoding rule ,",
    "she encodes @xmath29 into the @xmath31 degree polarization , and @xmath30 into the @xmath32 degree polarization .    on the other hand",
    ", bob measures the received photons by using one of two measurement device at random .",
    "the first measurement device discriminate between the vertical and the horizontal polarizations , and the measurement outcome is decoded into the corresponding bit value .",
    "the second measurement device discriminate between the @xmath31 degree and the @xmath32 degree polarizations , and the measurement outcome is decoded into the corresponding bit value .    after the reception of the photons , alice and bob announce over the public channel which encoding rule and which measurement device they have used for each bit .",
    "then , they keep those bits if their encoding rule and measurement device are compatible , i.e. , alice uses the first ( the second ) encoding rule and bob uses the first ( the second ) measurement device .",
    "we call such bit sequences the _ matched measurement outcomes_. on the other hand , they discard those bits if their encoding rule and measurement device are incompatible , i.e. , alice uses the first ( the second ) encoding rule and bob uses the second ( the first ) measurement device .",
    "we call such bit sequences the _ mismatched measurement outcomes_. furthermore , alice and bob announce a part of their matched measurement outcomes to estimate candidates of the quantum channel over which the photons were transmitted .",
    "the rest of the matched measurement outcomes are used as a seed for sharing a secret key .",
    "the most important feature of the qkd protocols is that we can calculate the quantity @xmath26 ) .",
    "] by using the axioms of the quantum mechanics if they know the quantum channel exactly .",
    "therefore , we can estimate a lower bound on @xmath26 via estimating the candidates of the quantum channel . actually , we employ the quantity @xmath26 minimized over the estimated candidates of the quantum channel as an estimate of true @xmath26 .    as we explained above , in the conventional bb84 protocol",
    "we discard the mismatched measurement outcomes and we estimate the candidates of the quantum channel by using only the samples from the matched measurement outcomes . in chapter",
    "[ ch : channel - estimation ] , we propose a channel estimation procedure in which we use the mismatched measurement outcomes in addition to the samples from the matched measurement outcomes .",
    "the use of the mismatched measurement outcomes enables us to reduce candidates of the quantum channel , and then enables us to estimate tighter lower bounds on the quantity @xmath26 .",
    "actually , we clarify that the key generation rate decided according to our proposed channel estimation procedure is at least as high as the key generation rate decided according to the conventional channel estimation procedure .",
    "we also clarify that the former is strictly higher than the latter in some cases . in chapter [ ch : postprocessing ]",
    ", we also apply our proposed channel estimation procedure to the protocol with the two - way postprocessing proposed in chapter [ ch : postprocessing ] .",
    "it should be noted that the use of the mismatched measurement outcomes was already considered in literatures . in early 90s ,",
    "barnett et al .",
    "@xcite showed that the use of mismatched measurement outcomes enables alice and bob to detect the presence of eve with higher probability for the so - called intercept and resend attack .",
    "furthermore , some literatures use the mismatched measurement outcomes to ensure the quantum channel to be a pauli channel @xcite , where a pauli channel is a channel over which four kinds of pauli errors ( including the identity ) occur probabilistically .",
    "however the quantum channel is not necessarily a pauli channel in general .",
    "one of the aims of this thesis is to convince the readers that the non - pauli channels deserve consideration in the research of the qkd protocols as well as the pauli channel .",
    "the qkd protocols consists of three phases : the bit transmission phase , the channel estimation phase , and the postprocessing phase .",
    "the role of the channel estimation phase is to estimate the amount of eve s ambiguity about the bit sequence transmitted in the bit transmission phase . according to the estimated amount of eve s ambiguity , we decide the key generation rate and conduct the postprocessing to share a secret key .    in the conventional estimation procedure , we do not use the mismatched measurement outcomes . by using the mismatched measurement outcomes in addition to the samples from the matched measurement outcomes",

    "finally , we mention the relation between our proposed postprocessing and the entanglement distillation protocols in section [ sec : relation - edp ] .      in order to clarify the relation between the two - way ir procedure and the advantage distillation proposed by maurer @xcite , we review the postprocessing with the advantage distillation in this section . for convenience ,",

    "for the pair of sequences , @xmath771 and @xmath772 , which is distributed according to @xmath773 , let @xmath472 , @xmath774 and @xmath775 be @xmath776-bit sequences such that @xmath777 and @xmath778 for @xmath779 .",
    "then , the pair @xmath780 and the discrepancy , @xmath775 between @xmath472 and @xmath774 are distributed according to the distribution @xmath781 .    the purpose of the advantage distillation is to classify blocks of length @xmath20 according to the parity @xmath782 of the discrepancies in each block .",
    "when @xmath27 is a distribution such that @xmath63 is the uniform distribution and @xmath783 is a binary symmetric channel ( bsc ) , the validity of this classification can be understood because we have @xmath784 this formula means that alice have to send @xmath785 itself if she want to tell bob @xmath785 .",

    "we show the two - way ir procedure .",
    "the essential difference between the two - way ir procedure and the advantage distillation is that alice does not send the sequence @xmath791 itself .",
    "as is usual in information theory , if we allow negligible error probability , alice does not need to send the parity sequence , @xmath791 , to bob to identify parity sequence @xmath791 .",
    "more precisely , bob can decode @xmath791 with negligible decoding error probability if alice sends a syndrome with a sufficient length .",
    "since eve s available information from the syndrome is much smaller than that from sequence @xmath791 itself , alice and bob can use @xmath791 as a seed for the key agreement .",
    "first , we need to define some auxiliary random variables .",
