    "in our previous paper @xcite ( paper i ) we formulated a set of necessary conditions for the spherically symmetric weakly charged dust to avoid big bang / big crunch , shell crossing and permanent central singularities .",
    "in fact , it had already been proven by ori @xcite that weakly charged dust with no central singularity necessarily evolves toward a shell crossing .",
    "however , ori assumed that the absolute value of the charge density ( in geometric units ) is strictly smaller than the mass density throughout the volume , including the center .",
    "his proof did not include the subcase when the values of these two densities at the center of symmetry are equal .",
    "we discussed precisely this subcase .",
    "we found that shell crossings are still unavoidable when the energy function @xmath6 , but the conditions did not lead to a contradiction when @xmath7 .",
    "we also provided an example of a solution of these conditions , which was in fact incorrect ( see below ) .",
    "however , we did not discuss the properties of the energy density .",
    "while we started to investigate more properties of the numerical example presented in paper i , it turned out that this density was becoming negative in a vicinity of the center of symmetry , for a brief period around the bounce instant .",
    "then , exact consideration showed that this is a general problem  a weakly charged spherically symmetric dust ball will always have such a negative - energy - density region if the charge and mass densities become equal in absolute value at the center .",
    "this fact is hidden in the equations in a rather tricky way . in the general case treated by ori",
    "this problem can be avoided by an appropriate choice of the arbitrary functions .",
    "the explicit example we gave in paper i had a problem - it did not obey the condition that the ratio @xmath8 must have a finite nonzero limit at the center of symmetry .",
    "for our example , this limit was zero , which means that there was a permanent central singularity in it ( the limit of the mass density at the center was actually @xmath9 ) .",
    "the permanent infinity is easily cured by changing @xmath10 to @xmath11 in the formulae for @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the whole subsequent reasoning then applies with only little quantitative changes , but a direction - dependent point singularity at the center necessarily appears at the instant of maximal compression .    in the present paper we fill in the gaps left out by previous investigation .",
    "we show that the energy density of the charged dust must become negative within a finite time - interval containing the instant of maximal compression .",
    "we also show that the point on the world line of the center of symmetry that is the limit of the points of maximal compression is a direction - dependent singularity of infinite energy density .",
    "the energy density tends to _ minus _ infinity when we approach the singular point along the hypersurface of maximal compression , and to plus infinity when we approach the same point along the center of symmetry .",
    "thus , the condition that the areal radius @xmath14 never goes down to zero if it was nonzero initially turns out to be still insufficient for avoiding singularities .",
    "these are the most striking and most important results of the present paper .    in order to make the paper independently readable",
    ", we quote the basic results of paper i in the next section , without proof . all the proofs ( or references to the proofs ) and details of the calculation can be found in paper i. section [ paper1 ]",
    "also contains remarks on the interpretation of the energy density , which is nontrivial in the presence of charges , and was not properly discussed in the earlier papers . in section [ negdens ]",
    "we show that the quantity @xmath15 must become negative in a vicinity of the instant of maximal compression whenever the conditions @xmath16 at the center and @xmath17 elsewhere are obeyed . in section [ negucons ]",
    "we discuss the various consequences of this fact and show that this necessarily implies a negative energy density for a certain period around the bounce instant . in section [ novac ] we show that the negative energy density regions can not be eliminated by assuming that the charged dust ball contains an empty ( minkowski ) vacuole around the center of symmetry because such a vacuole can not exist . in section [ transient ]",
    "we prove the existence of the point - singularity on the world line of the center of symmetry . in section [ perm ]",
    "we show that , even with negative energy density allowed , a solution with the period of oscillation independent of mass does not exist .",
    "a permanently nonsingular configuration of nonstatic weakly charged dust is thus impossible , unless one allows a permanent central singularity .",
    "we also compare our conclusion with the properties of the uncharged case .",

    "however , with charges present , @xmath2 contains a contribution from the charges . as will be shown later in this paper",
    ", @xmath45 must be positive in a vicinity of the center of symmetry , and @xmath46 everywhere for geometrical reasons .",
    "thus , the presence of charges always _ decreases _ the energy density .",
    "it will turn out later that , in the class of models considered here , @xmath2 necessarily becomes negative for a brief period around the instant of maximal compression along each world - line except the central one .    the functions @xmath14 and @xmath47 are implicitly defined by the set ( [ 2.6 ] )  ( [ 2.7 ] ) , which can in general be solved only numerically .",

    "the bounce with @xmath67 is nonrelativistic , since it occurs also in newton s theory , under the same conditions ( @xmath67 means that the electric repulsion of the charges spread throughout the volume of the dust prevails over the gravitational attraction of the mass ) .",

    ", i.e. zero charge density , provided @xmath70 , i.e. nonzero total charge .",

    "there is another subtle point here .",
    "the conditions ( [ 2.14 ] ) guarantee that a particle that had @xmath46 initially will not hit the set @xmath0 in the future or in the past .",
    "but , as we will see in sec .",
    "[ transient ] , the configurations obeying ( [ 2.14 ] ) contain a cleverly hidden singularity of a type hitherto unknown in dust solutions . on the world line of the center of symmetry , where @xmath71 permanently , there is a point in which @xmath5 for a single instant .",
    "this instant is the limit at @xmath72 of the hypersurface @xmath73 consisting of the instants in which the mass shells with @xmath46 attain their minimal sizes .",

    "the surface of the charged sphere obeys the equation of radial motion of a charged particle in the reissner ",
    "nordstrm spacetime .",
    "thus , the surface of a collapsing sphere must continue to collapse until it crosses the inner r ",
    "n horizon @xmath74 , and can bounce at @xmath75 . then , however , it can not re - expand back into the same spacetime region from which it collapsed , as this would require motion backward in time .",
    "the surface would thus continue through the tunnel between the singularities and re - expand into another copy of the asymptotically flat region .    at small charge density ( @xmath17 throughout the volume )",
    "a shell crossing is unavoidable , and it will block the passage through the r ",
    "n tunnel , as shown by ori @xcite .",

    "the first case was dealt with by ori ( unpublished @xcite ) .",
    "we consider the second case in section 3 , and the result is that a nonsingular bounce might happen only if the energy density becomes negative for a period around the bounce instant .",

    "such configurations do indeed exist with special forms of the arbitrary functions , as pointed out in refs @xcite and @xcite , but they are not interesting from the point of view of avoiding singularities .",
    "the conclusion of this paper is : the weakly charged spherically symmetric dust distribution considered here ( @xmath17 at @xmath118 and @xmath367 at @xmath119 ) must contain at least one of the following features :    \\1 . a big bang / big crunch singularity ;    \\2 . a permanent central singularity ;    \\3 . a shell crossing singularity in a vicinity of the center    \\4 . a finite time interval around the bounce instant in which the energy density becomes negative , and a transient momentary singularity of infinite energy density at a single point on the world line of the center of symmetry",
    "a fully nonsingular bounce is possible for a strongly charged configuration , @xmath368 , which can exist only with @xmath64  see the comments after ( [ 2.14 ] ) .",
    "this would be a collapse followed by a single bounce and re - expansion to infinite size .",
    "this phenomenon occurs also in the newtonian limit ",
    "the bounce here is caused by the prevalence of electrostatic repulsion over gravitational attraction .",
    "such an example was reportedly found , but never published , by ori and coworkers @xcite .",
    "a permanently nonsingular pulsating configuration of spherically symmetric charged dust does not exist . at most ,",
    "a single full cycle of nonsingular bounce can occur , and shell crossings will necessarily appear during the second collapse phase .",
    "the nonsingular bounce occurs at @xmath46 , but the momentary isolated singularity at the center of symmetry is still there .    the possibility of @xmath2 going negative in the presence of electric charges does not seem to have been noticed and may need further work on its interpretation .",
    "if the negative energy density region existed permanently in some part of the space , with comoving boundary , then we might suspect that this is a consequence of a bad choice of parameters that implies unphysical properties in that region .",
    "however , here we have the case in which the energy density is positive for some time , and then these same matter particles acquire negative energy density in a time - interval around the bounce instant .",
    "this suggests that there is some physical process involved in this , which should be further investigated .",
    "a question arises now .",
    "the uncharged limit of the family of configurations defined by eqs .",
    "( [ 2.1 ] )  ( [ 2.10 ] ) , @xmath41 , is the lematre  tolman ( l  t ) model @xcite . for the latter ,",
    "shell crossings can be avoided , as is well - known since long ago @xcite .",
    "why , then , are they unavoidable with @xmath369 ?",
    "the answer is this : in the l ",
    "t model , the big bang ( bb ) or big crunch ( bc ) are unavoidable ( both are present when @xmath7 ) . in the cases that are colloquially called `` free of shell crossings '' , in reality",
    "the shell crossings are not removed , but shifted to the epoch before the bb or after the bc , or both .",
    "thus , the shell crossings are no longer in the domain of physical applicability of the model . when the bb / bc singularities are replaced with a smooth bounce in charged dust , the shell crossings that were hidden on the other side of bb / bc become physically accessible , and they terminate the evolution of the configuration .",
    "we stated in the caption to fig . 10 in paper",
    "i , that the curves @xmath371 and @xmath370 were not really tangent at the point where @xmath371 has its maximum , but just close to one another .",
    "in fact , they not only were tangent at that point , but _ had to _ be tangent , independently of the explicit forms of the two functions .",
    "we show here that this is a general law : at every local extremum of @xmath371 ( call it @xmath372 ) we have @xmath373 .    the radius of the inner r ",
    "n horizon as a function of @xmath26 is @xmath374 where @xmath39 and @xmath270 are assumed to depend on @xmath26 through @xmath375 .",
    "we do not assume any explicit form of the functions @xmath39 and @xmath270 , we only use the general properties ( [ 2.9 ] ) , ( [ 2.15 ] ) and ( [ 2.23 ] ) .    at every local extremum @xmath376 we have @xmath377 . using ( [ 2.23 ] ) , this means @xmath378_e = \\left[{\\cal m } \\gamma - qq,_n\\right]_e,\\ ] ] where the subscript @xmath50 denotes the value at the extremum .",
    "from here @xmath379_e = \\left[\\frac { qq,_n } { \\gamma^2 } \\left(2",
    "{ \\cal m } \\gamma - qq,_n\\right)\\right]_e.\\ ] ] substituting this value of @xmath380 in ( [ a.1 ] ) wet get @xmath381 substituting the same value of @xmath380 in ( [ 2.13 ] ) for @xmath190 we find @xmath382 @xmath163",
    "for simplicity , to avoid physical coefficients , we introduce the functions @xmath383 , @xmath384 and @xmath385 ( where @xmath375 , @xmath386 const ) by @xmath387 then , to prove ( [ 3.2 ] ) we must prove that @xmath388/{f_2}^2 = 0.\\ ] ]    by condition ( 5 ) , in a vicinity of @xmath389 , @xmath271 must be of the form @xmath390 where @xmath391 and @xmath392 are constants , and @xmath393 is an unspecified function with the property @xmath394 . then ,",
    "by the regularity condition ( [ 2.24 ] ) , @xmath395 where @xmath396 , by ( [ 2.25 ] ) .",
    "it follows from ( [ 2.21 ] ) and ( [ 2.8 ] )  ( [ 2.9 ] ) that @xmath397 hence , @xmath398 thus @xmath399 is of order @xmath400 or @xmath401 , whichever limit is lower .",
    "however , the limit via @xmath402 leads to a central singularity , since then , from ( [ 2.27 ] ) , @xmath403 as @xmath141 , so ( [ 2.23 ] ) will not hold .",
    "consequently , @xmath399 is of order @xmath400 , while the second term under the square root in ( [ 3.1 ] ) , @xmath404 is of order @xmath405 .",
    "suppose that @xmath406 , so that the second term under the square root in ( [ 3.1 ] ) is of lower order than the first one .",
    "this translates to @xmath407 . but condition ( [ 2.23 ] ) , in combination with ( [ 2.27 ] ) , requires that @xmath408 , or else a central singularity will appear .",
    "thus , @xmath404 must be of higher order in @xmath320 than @xmath409 in eq .",
    "( [ 3.1 ] ) , i.e. ( [ 3.2 ] ) must hold .",
    "@xmath163    now consider the case when we approach the center of symmetry along the locus of the outer turning points , @xmath61 .",
    "then @xmath410 remains positive up to the center , as is seen from the reasoning below .",
    "the conclusion that @xmath404 is of higher order in @xmath320 than @xmath409 still applies , so we have @xmath411 \\nonumber \\\\   & = & 1 + q,_n(0 ) \\lim_{n \\to 0 } eq / m = 1 + q,_n(0 ) \\lim_{x \\to 0 } ep / f_2.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we know from the above that @xmath412 , @xmath413 and @xmath414 , while the regularity condition ( [ 2.23 ] ) implies , via ( [ 2.27 ] ) , that @xmath415 .",
    "this , taken together , implies that @xmath416 , i.e. that @xmath417 , i.e. that @xmath418 remains positive up to the very center .",
    "let us assume @xmath295 as in ( [ b.4 ] ) and @xmath383 in a form similar to ( [ b.3 ] ) : @xmath419 for the function @xmath384 this implies @xmath420 then @xmath421 now we have two cases : @xmath422 and @xmath423 . in the first case we have @xmath424 .",
    "thus , in order that @xmath425 has a nonzero limit at @xmath426 , it follows that @xmath427 .",
    "then , if the terms @xmath246 and @xmath247 in ( [ 2.13 ] ) are to be of the same order , the ratio @xmath428 should have a nonzero finite limit at @xmath426 .",
    "but , with @xmath422 and @xmath427 we have @xmath429 which has the consequence that @xmath430 , i.e. the conditions @xmath238 can not be imposed at @xmath46 .    in the second case , @xmath423",
    ", we can assume @xmath431 ( nothing in the equations depends on the sign of @xmath270 ) ; then @xmath399 is of the order of either @xmath432 or @xmath433 , whichever exponent is smaller . with @xmath434 being smaller , the result",
    "is immediately seen : if @xmath399 is of the order @xmath432 while @xmath13 is of the order @xmath435 , then @xmath436 , and @xmath437 . with @xmath400 being smaller we have @xmath438",
    "this will have a finite limit at @xmath389 if @xmath439 .",
    "but we are considering the case when @xmath399 is of order @xmath433 , which means that the limit of @xmath440 , i.e. the limit of @xmath441 at @xmath426 will be infinite , which again shows that the matching conditions can not be fulfilled at a finite nonzero @xmath59 . @xmath163"
