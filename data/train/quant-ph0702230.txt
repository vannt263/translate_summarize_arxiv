    "define a parameter @xmath10 to represent potential offset between two dots inside each molecule , which can be changed by external electrical field or bias voltage on the gates defining quantum dots@xcite .",
    "the range of @xmath10 can be changed between @xmath2 and @xmath3 , and for this case , there are only two charge states of each qubit : @xmath11 and @xmath12 . here",
    "@xmath13 indicates the charging energy of each dot .  due to pauli blockade",
    ", the double - dot state can shift to charge state @xmath11 if the initial state is @xmath14 ( we use @xmath15 to denote @xmath14 in the following text ) , but remain in charge state @xmath12 if the initial state is @xmath16 .",
    "the energy level structure of each molecule is shown in fig.[fig:2 ] . due to the tunneling between the two dots , the charge states @xmath17 and @xmath12 hybridize . according to reference j.m .",
    "taylor , we can define two superposition states @xmath18where @xmath19here @xmath20 indicates the tunnel coupling . by adiabatically sweeping @xmath10 from @xmath2 to @xmath3 , the double - dot states @xmath21 and @xmath22 evolve according to eq .",
    "the rapid adiabatic passage means that the transformation of @xmath10 is fast relative to the nuclear mixing time @xmath23 but slow with respect to the tunnel coupling @xmath24@xcite . here",

    "when @xmath32 , we get @xmath33 and the eigenstates @xmath34 , and @xmath35 .",
    "thus by adiabatically sweeping @xmath10 from @xmath2 to @xmath3 , the double dots initially in the state @xmath36 can change from the charge state @xmath37 to @xmath38 . for simplicity",
    ", we use @xmath39 to represent the singlet state @xmath40 in the following text .",
    "we can initialize the system to the state @xmath41 by loading two electrons from a nearby fermi sea into the ground state of a single quantum dot @xmath39 and then sweeping the bias voltage @xmath10 from @xmath3 to @xmath2 in the rapid adiabatic passage to change the charge state from @xmath38 to @xmath37j.r .",

    "taylor , j.m .",
    "taylor et al .. in the following , we can see that when the neighboring qubits are both in the charge state @xmath38 , the interaction between them will be switched on .",
    "thus , the initialization can only be simultaneously made on non - neighboring qubits .",
    "for a one - dimensional qubit array , we need at least two steps to initialize all qubit to the @xmath42 charge state @xmath36 . for a two - dimensional array , four steps are needed .",
    "after initialization , the bias voltage @xmath10 of all qubits are kept in the value of @xmath2 and all qubit charge states are in @xmath37 .    according to the euler angle method ,",
    "if rotations by arbitrary angles about two orthogonal axes are available , arbitrary single - qubit rotations can be constructed . for the present double - dot molecule ,",
    "it has also been analyzed and experimentally shown that arbitrary single - qubit rotations can be performed at finite singlet - triplet energy splitting @xmath43 , by combining @xmath44 rotations @xmath45 with rotations @xmath46 around an axis in the @xmath47 plane .",
    "for example , a rotation about the @xmath48-axis can be generated by a three - step sequence @xmath49@xcite .",
    "as the qubit is encoded in the @xmath37 charge singlet state @xmath36 and triplet state @xmath50 , we can switch on the interaction between neighboring qubits by simultaneously changing them to charge state @xmath38 only when they are both initially in the singlet state @xmath36 .",
    "assume that @xmath51 and each molecule is initialized in @xmath12 charge state .",
    "the coulomb interaction between the two nearest - neighbor qubits can be directly described by the hamiltonian : @xmath52 in the basis @xmath53",
    "@xmath54 @xmath55 and @xmath56where    @xmath57    here @xmath58 is dielectric constant of gaas , @xmath59 is the distance between the dots inside each molecule and @xmath60 is the distance between neighboring molecules .",

    "1 . the triplet state @xmath50 will remain unchanged in the charge state @xmath37 .",
    "when @xmath63 , the state @xmath36 evolves into @xmath38 charge state @xmath64 .",
    "then the interaction between these two molecules can be written as : @xmath65 in the basis @xmath53",
    "@xmath54 @xmath66 @xmath67 , where @xmath68 @xmath69 .    eliminating a constant background interaction @xmath70",
    ", we get an effective two - molecule interaction : @xmath71which can be switched on by sweeping @xmath10 from @xmath2 towards @xmath72 . here",
    "@xmath73 @xmath70 can be regarded as the differential cross - capacitance energy between the two double - dot systems .",
    "it is noted that the effective interaction is switched on whenever the state @xmath74 includes the component of @xmath38 charge state@xcite . the differential cross - capacitance energy @xmath75",
    "can thus be written as a function of @xmath76 :    @xmath77    when @xmath78 @xmath29 and @xmath75 is off . when @xmath63 , @xmath33 and and @xmath75 is maximal .",
    "combined with some single qubit operations , which have been shown available for double - dot molecule in section.[section : initialization ] , we can construct any two - qubit gate and realize universal quantum computation with the present ising - model effective interaction .",
    "for example the controlled - not gate can be achieved with two single - qubit hadamard operations @xmath79 and a two - qubit operation @xmath80 as    @xmath81    by choosing a proper interaction time @xmath82 for @xmath83 , we can get the two - qubit operation @xmath84 directly from the present effective interaction :    @xmath85    after interaction time @xmath86 , the @xmath10 should be in the value of @xmath2 to completely switch off the effective interaction .    comparing with the one - dimensional alinement of all quantum dots , the present two - dimensional architecture can greatly simplify the interaction between the neighboring quantum molecules as fig.[fig:1:b ] : there is effective interaction only when the two neighboring molecules are both in the charge state @xmath38 .",
    "we can switch on the interaction between any two neighboring qubits ( qubit @xmath87 and @xmath88 ) by simultaneously changing their charge state from @xmath37 to @xmath38 .",
    "other neighboring qubits such as qubit @xmath89 and @xmath90 are kept in the charge state @xmath37 so that they can not be infected by the operations on qubit @xmath87 and @xmath91 .",
    "it is noted the coulomb interaction between two electrons inside each qubit can also be neglected . only the interaction between the nearest - neighbor molecules",
    "is included in the previous protocols .",
    "it can be shown that the interaction between non - nearest - neighbor qubits can be neglected safely @xcite .",
    "if all the quantum dots are arranged in line as fig.[fig:1:a ] , we can get an effective interaction between neighboring quantum molecules by sweeping the two logical qubits into charge state @xmath38 and @xmath92 respectively . in this case",
    ", the notation @xmath93 indicates @xmath94 electrons on the `` left '' dot of each qubit and @xmath95 electrons on the `` right '' dot . in the basis @xmath53",
    "@xmath96 @xmath66 @xmath97 , the interaction between two neighboring qubits @xmath87 and @xmath91 can be written in the form : @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the interaction between two quantum molecules which are both in the @xmath37 charge states ; @xmath100 is the coulomb interaction energy change when qubit @xmath87 ( or @xmath91 ) is swept from the charge state @xmath37 to @xmath38 ( or @xmath92 ) ; @xmath101 is the energy change when qubit @xmath87 and @xmath91 are swept from the charge state @xmath37 to @xmath102 and @xmath92 respectively . when there are only two logical qubits , this interaction can be used to get two - qubit gates @xcite .",
    "however , for the scalable quantum computation , we can not exclusively switch on interaction between two neighboring qubits without influencing other neighboring qubits .",
    "for example , when we switch on interaction @xmath103 between qubit @xmath87 and @xmath91 , there is also an effective interaction between qubit @xmath89 and @xmath87 ( or qubit @xmath91 and @xmath104 : @xmath105as we need to change the molecule charge state in the measurement process , the kind of unavoidable effect from other neighboring qubits will be switched on and influence the single qubit readout for this architecture that all quantum dots are arranged in line .",
    "although the quantum dots are arranged in two - dimensional architecture , we have only considered a one - dimensional logical qubits or quantum molecules chain in the above discussion . actually , we can scale the logical qubits to a two - dimensional array when bilayer 2-dimensional - electron - gas ( 2deg ) are used to form quantum molecule@xcite as shown in fig.[fig:3 ] .",
    "each molecule comprises one quantum dot in the upper 2deg and another one in the lower 2deg .",
    "the two quantum dots of upper and lower layers are tunneling coupled to form one quantum molecules .",
    "these molecules can also be the self - assembled quantum dot pillars , which also include two quantum dots respectively in the upper and lower part of the pillar@xcite .",
    "as the @xmath37 charge state @xmath36 and the @xmath38 charge state @xmath39 can transform mutually by adjusting the bias voltage @xmath10 , the single qubit readout for the present double - dot molecule can be made by a quantum point contact ( qpc ) placed near one of the quantum dot as shown in fig.[fig:4 ] @xcite . from the current through qpc , we can know the two electrons distribution in the double - dot molecule .",
    "if the molecule is in the singlet state @xmath36 , it will be changed to the charge state @xmath106 and the current of qpc will be lower , when we sweep @xmath10 from @xmath2 to @xmath3 . if the molecule is in the triplet state @xmath107 , it will stay in the charge state @xmath37 and the current of qpc will be unchanged when sweeping @xmath10 . as the interaction between neighboring qubits will be switched on when they are both in the charge state @xmath38 , we will avoid to perform single qubit measurement on two neighboring molecules simultaneously .        with the present architecture of quantum molecules",
    ", we can also perform bell state measurement for these qubits encoded in double - dot singlet and triplet states , by directly place a qpc in the middle of two molecules as shown in fig.[fig:4 ] .",
    "any two - qubit state can be denoted by : @xmath108where @xmath109 , @xmath110 .",
    "@xmath111 and @xmath112 are the four bell states .",
    "we can detect the charge state of the quantum dots through the qpc current @xmath113 . simultaneously sweep the bias voltage @xmath114 of the two qubits , which need to be measured , from @xmath2 to @xmath72 .",
    "due to the distribution of the four electrons in the two molecules , the qpc current @xmath113 can thus have three different values : the current @xmath113 is kept in the value @xmath115 , which means the two qubits are both in the charge state @xmath37 ; the current @xmath113 is changed to the value @xmath116 , which means that both qubits are in the charge state @xmath106 ; the current @xmath113 gets a value @xmath117 smaller than @xmath115 but larger than @xmath116 , which corresponds to the case that one of the two qubits is in the charge state @xmath38 .",
    "as the effective interaction will be switched on when the two qubits are both in the charge state @xmath38 , the two - qubit state @xmath118 will evolve as in the following form when sweeping @xmath10 from @xmath2 to @xmath119 @xmath120where @xmath121 , @xmath122 represents the time that @xmath123 leaves the value @xmath2 .",
    "the effective interaction only adds a phase to the component @xmath124 .",
    "as it can only be switched on only when the two qubits are both in the state @xmath125 , it has no influence to @xmath126 . if the qpc current @xmath113 gets the value @xmath115 , the two qubits are thus both in the charge state @xmath37 .",
    "this means that the two qubits are in the state @xmath127 .",
    "the current @xmath116 means that the two qubits are both in the charge state @xmath38 .",
    "then we can determine that the two - qubit state is in the state @xmath124 , which is evolved from the initial state @xmath128 .",
    "if the qpc current @xmath129 , we can know that the one of the two qubits is in the charge state @xmath38 .",
    "this is the case that the two qubits are in the state @xmath130 or @xmath131 , which respectively evolve from the initial two - qubit state @xmath132 or @xmath133 . with this step of qpc measurement",
    ", we can get the parity information of these two qubits . in the case of @xmath134",
    ", we sweep the @xmath10 of the both two qubits back to @xmath135 from @xmath3 and then perform hadamard operation on the two qubits in turn .",
    "it is ensured that the two qubits can not be simultaneously both in the charge state @xmath38 in the operations .",
    "the two hadamard operations will rotate @xmath126 respectively into the state @xmath136 and @xmath137@xcite .",
    "sweep the @xmath10 of the both two qubits from @xmath2 to @xmath3 and make qpc measurement again .",
    "as the above measurement , the qpc current @xmath138 can also have three different values : @xmath139 , @xmath117 , @xmath116 . from the values of @xmath113 and @xmath140 , we can determine two bell state @xmath132 and @xmath133 as shown in table.[table ] .",
    "we can sweep the molecule charge state back to @xmath37 after this measurement .",
    "it is noted that this bell state measurement is not a completed one , and we can only distinguish two of the four bell states . in addition , this measurement can also be regarded as a processing of generating bell state @xmath133 , as the two quantum molecules which are measured in this bell state can be used in future applications .",

    "by encoding in singlet and triplet states , qubits are protected from low - frequency noise and the effect of homogeneous hyperfine interactions for double dots .",
    "recent experiments have demonstrated that the coherence time of the singlet and triplet states can be about @xmath141 , which can even be increased to @xmath142 with spin - echo techniques@xcite . as the rapid adiabatic passage of @xmath10",
    "is required to be fast relative to the nuclear mixing time @xmath143 but slow with respect to the tunnel coupling @xmath144 , the @xmath10 sweeping speed is about @xmath145 in these experiments .",
    "if the quantum dot of molecule has a diameter of @xmath146 , the charge energy @xmath147 and sweeping @xmath10 from @xmath2 to @xmath3 needs a time of about @xmath148 . for quantum molecules based on bilayer 2deg as fig.[fig:3 ] , the distance between the double dots of each molecules @xmath149 and the distance between neighboring molecules @xmath150 ( in order to safely neglect the effect from the interaction between non - nearest - neighbor qubits ) , and",
    "we need a time of about @xmath148 to achieve a two - qubit controlled phase operation @xmath151@xcite .",
    "actually , in the the previous protocols of arranging four quantum dots of two molecules in line , qubits are similarly coupled by coulomb interaction@xcite .",
    "the two - qubit operations may also need a time of about @xmath148 .",
    "therefore , we still need to increase the coherence time or increase the interaction strength , even qubit is encoded in singlet and triplet states for these quantum computation schemes exploring coulomb interaction to realizing two - qubit gates . since the qpc measurement needs a time of about @xmath142 , qpc measurement can be implemented only once within the coherence time .",
    "thus only partial bell state measurement for qubit encoded in singlet and triplet state may be realizable with the present experiment conditions .",
    "generally , we can also distinguish the four bell states by firstly transfer them into four product states respectively and then simultaneously performing qpc measurement on each qubit within the coherence time .    in conclusion",
    ", we have proposed a quantum computation architecture based on double - dot quantum molecules . as the qubit is encoded in the @xmath37 charge singlet state @xmath36 and triplet state @xmath107",
    ", we can simplify the coulomb interaction to a switchable ising interaction in the present architecture . compared with the previous schemes ,",
    "the effective ising interaction can be switched on and off between any two neighboring qubits without affecting other neighboring qubits .",
    "a bell - state measurement scheme is also presented for qubit encoded in the singlet and triplet state .",
    "universal quantum gates can be performed by only tuning the potential offset between the two dots of each molecule , where the time - dependent control of the tunnel coupling between the dots is eliminated .",
