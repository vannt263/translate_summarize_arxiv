    "the pattern of regulatory interactions linking transcription factors ( tfs ) to their target genes constitutes the first level of a multilayered network of gene regulation ; the so called gene transcriptional regulatory networks ( grn ) @xcite .",

    "@xcite as well as the unicellular eukaryote _ saccharomyces cerevisiae _ @xcite . in such a picture , both hierarchical @xcite and modular @xcite components have been repeatedly highlighted , although no general agreement exists on what scale of analysis more accurately captures global complexity @xcite .    the conceptualisation of cellular interaction maps within the framework of graph theory @xcite has provided powerful insights on their hierarchical @xcite , modular organisation @xcite as well as it sheds light on the topological constraints imposed in its dynamical behaviour @xcite . however , their quantification , even their identification has led to a nonuniform concept of module under functional , topological , evolutionary and developmental criteria @xcite .",
    "similarly , the observed hierarchy seldom matches an ideal feed - forward relation between components @xcite .",
    "an alternative approach considers looking at grns in a more fundamental way , namely as sets of causal relations , featured by the directed nature of the link between a transcription factor with its target genes @xcite .",

    "we observe that the complex , periodic behaviour may arise solely due to the dynamics of the two subgraphs ( a and b in figure [ diagrama]a ) exhibiting feedback loops .",
    "the remaining system simply reacts to the dynamical inputs generated from these modules .",
    "interestingly , these mentioned topological traits defines the dynamical behaviour no mattering what kind of dynamical rules are used to causally relate our elements .",
    "some elements will play the leading role , determining the qualitative type of dynamics , whereas others will just amplify or reduce the core signals .",
    "this view of interactions is at the core of a relational picture of a biological computation @xcite .",
    "this is a computational perspective and , not surprisingly , grns have been compared to computers @xcite .",
    "cellular computations pervade both the diverse responses to external stimuli @xcite as well as cell robustness and plasticity @xcite .",
    "a number of dynamical approximations suggest a link between network organization and its dynamical behaviour .",
    "however , due to the large size of these systems , only a few small ones @xcite have been fully analysed .",
    "ideally , it would be desirable to have a method to construct a graph capturing all non - trivial causal relations and thus all potentially important computational links . in this paper",
    "we show that such organisation of grns is captured by the principle of causality depicted by the directed nature of gene - gene relations .",
    "this can uncovered by exploiting the properties of directed graphs , in particular , by the use of leaf removal algorithms ( lras ) @xcite and the identification of the so - called strongly connected components ( sccs ) @xcite .",
    "as we will see , lras recover the network fraction responsible for potentially non trivial computations .",
    "furthermore , the internal organisation of this especial subgraph can be topologically dissected by scc identification .",
    "a scc is defined for a set of vertices if there is a _ walk _ -attending to the directedness of edges- from each vertex to every other vertex of this set",
    "( see figure [ scc ] ) .",
    "the identification of scc has been applied to a diverse number of systems from the internet @xcite to metabolism and neural wiring network @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been described that yeast grn presents a giant scc @xcite , contrasting with an acyclic and feed - forward organisation of _",
    "e. coli _ @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we explore the topological constraints derived from wiring patterns of causal dependencies in a comparative analysis of yeast , _",
    "e. coli _ and _ b. subtilis _ by defining their qualitatively relevant causal cores .",
    "we explore their internal organisation in terms of irreducible computational entities at the level of gene regulatory systems .",
    "as will be shown below , our analysis ( using a more updated version of _ e. coli _ grn ) revealed relevant differences in relation to previous results published in the literature .",
    "causal relations in grns can be described in terms of directed graphs ( in short _ digraphs _ ) @xcite . a graph is constituted by a set of vertices or nodes ( here the genes ) and the set of edges linking them ( the relations among genes ) .",
    "the regulatory effect of a tf gene @xmath1 on a specific target gene @xmath2 is depicted by an arrow ( @xmath3 ) in the graph plot .",
    "if the vertices are genes , a chain of connections of different tfs corresponds in graph theory with a _ directed walk _ and it can be interpreted as a causal chain .",
    "interestingly , all tfs exhibit outgoing links , whereas non - tf genes ( the target ones ) only receive arrows from the tf set .",
    "the number of outgoing links of a vertex is known as _ out - degree _ ( denoted by @xmath4 ) whereas the number of incoming edges is the _ in - degree _ ( @xmath5 ) . since",
    "a tf can be a regulatory target of other tfs , they can exhibit both incoming and outgoing links , allowing feed - backs to occur .    a specially important information about the organization of directed graphs is provided by the analysis of its connected components , i.e. the graph in which every pair of distinct vertices has a _ walk _ -see appendix . in digraphs ,",
    "directed walks are non trivially organised .",
    "the internet is a very illustrative example of that @xcite exhibiting a bow - tie structure with three different connected components : 1 ) a central strongly connected component ( scc ) , namely a subgraph for which every two vertices are mutually reachable @xcite , 2 ) a set of incoming components ( @xmath6 ) composed by the set of feed - forward pathways starting from vertices without in - degree and ending in scc and 3 ) a set of outgoing components ( @xmath7 ) where pathways starting from scc end in vertices without out - degree ( see figure [ scc ] ) .    ) , two strongly connected components ( sccs ) and the outgoing component ( @xmath7).,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ] [ scc ]    typically , the pattern of activation of a given gene has a time - dependent causal relation with the state of the set of genes affecting it , and every vertex @xmath1 can acquire a given state from a number of possible states .",
    "specifically , the state of @xmath1 at time @xmath8 is influenced by the state of the vertices _ affecting _ it at time @xmath9 -see appendix .",
    "the equations describing the dynamical behaviour of a given vertex @xmath1 at time @xmath10 can be formulated in different ways , including boolean dynamics @xcite , threshold nets @xcite as figure [ diagrama ] illustrates or coupled differential equations @xcite .",
    "these models are different but all show a common principle of causality : the state of a given vertex @xmath1 at time @xmath10 is exclusively defined by the vertices affecting it at time @xmath9 . no matter our choice of the dynamical equations , the patterning of links must strongly influence system s behaviour .",
    "the presence of a _ cyclic walk _",
    "-a directed walk where the first and the ending vertices are the same- is a necessary ( but not sufficient ) requisite for a periodic solution .",
    "this is due to the fact that , in interpreting directed edges as causal relations , a cyclic graph implies that every vertex is indirectly affected by itself .",
    "when we consider the whole graph , an overlapping of cycles originates the scc set that can be governed by the @xmath6 set . as we shall show below , these two structures represent the core of the graph that qualitatively constrains its dynamical complexity .",
    "by contrast , in linear directed walks , the upstreamest element fully determines the final state of the elements belonging to this walk .",
    "a set able to properly capture the relevant components qualitatively affecting global behaviour should remove linear paths from the graph . under this view",
    ", we can identify this set by means of a straightforward iterative algorithm . given the underlying influence of causal relations on system s dynamics",
    ", we will use the label _ dynamic _ for most of our definitions .",
    "we compute the _ dynamical backbone _ ( @xmath11 ) of a given directed graph @xmath12 ( to be noted @xmath13 ) by the iterative pruning of vertices with @xmath14 from the initial graph , but maintaining those vertices whose @xmath15 ( figure [ dbb definition ] ) .",
    "this algorithm belongs to the family the so - called leaf removal algorithms @xcite that have been previously used for the analysis of grns @xcite .",
    "figure [ dbb definition]a illustrates the mechanism of pruning .",
    "notice that , in contrast with previous proposals of leaf - removal algorithms , the @xmath13 also keeps the _ single root vertices _ i.e. those such that @xmath15 which appear isolated .",
    "single root vertices are special because their state is only externally changed and are not influenced by other genes .",
    "we observe that , in general the @xmath13 displays more than a single connected component ( see figure ( [ dbb definition ] ) ) .",
    "interestingly , this dynamically relevant subgraph coincides with the union of the previously described @xmath6 and scc sets of a directed graph .",
    "by contrast , @xmath7 is associated with another interesting subgraph , to be indicated as @xmath16 formed by the fraction of the net that exclusively displays feed - forward structures .",

    "the application of the above defined algorithm leads to a drastic reduction of network complexity , preserving the computational structures responsible of the qualitative behaviour of the net .    ) .",
    "different layers indicate the successive iterations of the algorithm . in ( b ) we indicate the dynamical modules of the @xmath17 .",
    "maximal cycles larger than one vertex are labelled by capital letters .",
    "figure ( c ) shows the hierarchical organization of the collapsed dynamical modules , i.e. , the feed - forward organization obtained after the _ condensation _ of the graph @xmath17 -see text .",
    "notice that the @xmath13 exhibits isolated self - interacting vertices that , by definition , are dynamical modules but auto - loops are maintained in order to provide a more informative picture.,width=302 ]      as we argued above , the core of causal relations of a grn is captured by its @xmath11 .",
    "furthermore , the causal relations inside this @xmath11 can display some kind of hierarchy .",
    "as we shall see @xmath11 organisation can be studied by scc detention and the so - called graph _ condensation _ process . mathematical appendix formally details the treatment of grns that uncovers the order relation ( i.e. the hierarchical order ) among the elements of the net .",
    "figure [ dbb definition]b illustrates the process for module identification by scc detection .",
    "interestingly , the nodes belonging to a scc are mutually affected and therefore , they all contribute to the state definition of all the set ( see a and b regions of the toy model described in figure [ diagrama]a ) . the complexity of these topological entities can not be reduced and thus , scc concept defines an irreducible unit of causal relations ( see mathematical appendix for formal definition ) . in this sense , the scc can be identified with the module concept , since it constitutes an identifiable semiautonomous part of the system @xcite , capturing a part of the dynamical complexity of the system .",
    "therefore , we say that , within the context of grns , sccs represent a sort of dynamical modules .",
    "we finally note that , consistently with definition , a single vertex belonging to the @xmath11 but not participating in any cycle is itself a dynamical module .",
    "interestingly , when the scc is represented by a single vertex , the resulting graph is a directed acyclic graph ( see figure [ dbb definition]c ) .",
    "such an operation is commonly referred in the literature as the _ condensation _ of a graph @xcite .",
    "the result after the condensation process is precisely the feed - forward organisation what enables us to define an order relation among the elements of the @xmath11 .",
    "it is worth stressing that an order relation can not be established in cyclic wiring .",
    "condensation process allows us to identify such cycles into sccs representing dynamical modules . in this way ,",
    "the internal organisation in a hierarchy of causal relations is revelaled for the @xmath11 .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^ , < , < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]",
    "the final goal behind any network - based analysis is in most cases to reach a systematic picture of _ what is relevant _ and what is not . according to this philosophy",
    ", we have presented a comparative study of the best known up - to - date grns by exploiting their most fundamental trait : the principle of causality .",
    "the grn can be seen as a roadmap of the computational processes linking external stimuli with adaptive cell responses and this can be reduced to the wiring pattern of causal dependencies among tfs and their target genes .",
    "although we ignore here any dynamical features , stability properties and other relevant components of grn complexity , the construction process is unambiguous and leads to a unique , logical description of the causal core of a grn .    by using the directed nature of the network",
    ", we can systematically reduce network complexity from thousands of elements to a much smaller subset including all the causally relevant parts of the grn .",
    "such a causal / computational perspective is consistent with the nature of regulatory maps .",
    "no matter how they behave exactly ( and thus how they would be modelled ) the set of non - reducible causal links should capture most of what is dynamically relevant .",
    "the approach presented here combines the use of leaf - removal and scc identification algorithms for directed networks .",
    "these methods do not make any assumption or require any probabilistic estimator providing a unique solution where the presence of a modular hierarchy can be easily depicted .",
    "this approximation to the identification of the basic computational / causal units differs from others such as network motif identification .",
    "dissecting networks into motifs provides a systematic classification of grns in their small building blocks @xcite . by using the abundance of small subgraphs in a given network",
    "however , the detection of a subgraph in a given net requires predefined decisions on what is to be measured .",
    "by contrast , scc detection is not restricted to the search of a particular subgraph configuration and makes possible the identification of entities that can not be further partitioned due to the cyclic behaviour of this special set . as we stated in the introduction section , cycles are at the basis on a non - trivial computation @xcite and , as we have shown , scc is a topological concept that may be interpreted as a sort dynamical modules ( identifiable semiautonomous entities @xcite ) within the framework of gnr . attending to this",
    ", we have shown that these dynamical modules are organised within the core of computationally relevant dependencies that is the @xmath11 .",
    "interestingly , this interpretation is also valid for any network depicting a relation of causal dependencies .",
    "the analysis of grns shows that dynamical backbones are very small ( compared with the whole network ) and thus the basic logic of grns can be strongly simplified .",
    "the very small number of iterations required to obtain the @xmath11 suggests a direct control of the tf set over the pool of target genes , without a long _ chain of command _",
    "responsible for information transmission .",
    "this is reinforced by the fact that in all cases more than the @xmath18 of genes were eliminated after the first iteration of @xmath11 pruning ( data not shown ) .",
    "functional analyses did not reveal significant differences between @xmath11 and the set of root nodes .",
    "since they are at the top of hierarchy , we could conclude that they might be related to stimulus sensing .",
    "however , we must stress that the tf - gene target relation is a part of the regulation process and tf and promoter alteration through cell signalling processes or metabolism can operate in different elements of the regulatory set . in this context",
    ", further efforts in the integration of different regulatory levels would contribute to clarify this issue .",
    "the strong hierarchical @xmath11 structure found for bacteria is consistent with previous observations @xcite .",
    "our analysis reveals that bacterial grns are almost devoid of cycles , although not totally excluded , as previous studies have suggested @xcite .",
    "moreover , our results indicate that these cycles are organised into dynamical modules with essential biological functions , such as module a in _",
    "e. coli_. the pattern of connections of this module reveals a non trivial computational link between transcription and metabolic control under both normal and stress growth conditions . as we have shown , it is a common shared trait in bacteria despite the relative simple organisation of _ b. subtilis _ when compared with _",
    "( most probably due to a lesser knowledge of its regulatory wiring ) .",
    "in contrast with the prokaryotic @xmath11s , the yeast @xmath11 is fairly different , with a high content of cycles organised into a single scc , ( see @xcite ) .",
    "our analysis shows that this large dynamical module occupies a central position in the yeast @xmath11 suggesting a bow - tie causal organisation .",
    "it is worth to note that , according to its definition , scc components may be substantially modified by the addition of new links or by rewiring them . in this context , novel findings in the gene regulatory circuitry of these organisms may alter the current picture of these networks .",
    "now an interesting question arises . from an evolutionary perspective , mutations in regulatory boxes of target genes ,",
    "may alter the structure of sccs .",
    "then , it is reasonable to think that the regulatory system should be protected against this kind of perturbations .",
    "interestingly , when comparing real networks with their null model counterparts both @xmath11 and sccs are markedly smaller than what is expected by chance . at this point",
    ", the reduction of the dynamically relevant core and the hierarchical organisation of the smallest possible size sccs ( attending to dynamical requisites of the cell ) would contribute to reduce the impact of this type of mutations .",
    "in addition , another layer of complexity must be considered to play a relevant role to minimise the impact of this type of mutations .",
    "this is the distribution of the activatory and inhibitory weight in the genetic wiring .",
    "interestingly , it has seen that an experimental rewiring of the _ e. coli _",
    "gene regulatory network does not cause a dramatic impact on organism surveillance @xcite .",
    "uncovering the genetic circuitry of these organisms is still an ongoing task , and our results can only provide a tentative approximation to the final picture .",
    "however , due to the good quality of data for _ e. coli _ network , only slight modifications in the feed - forward architecture are expected . in the case of @xmath11 yeast ,",
    "its cyclic character is a distinctive trait .",
    "notice that the lack of knowledge for gene connections would not alter the cyclic character of @xmath11 .",
    "in addition , only a tree - like structure ( similar to bacteria ) could be suggested if further evidences demonstrate that current data is enriched with a high number of false connections causing loops in the network .",
    "this is a technical limitation in yeast due to the fact that tf - gene connections are defined according to a statistic value [ see yeast grn construction in methods ] . in our case , very restrictive conditions were used for yeast network construction in order to reduce the impact of possible false connections .",
    "this provides strong arguments supporting that different strategies for grn organisation are present in these prokaryotic and eukaryotic studied organisms .    attending to the biology of bacteria and yeast ,",
    "common patterns can be identified .",
    "both share an unicellular organisation , simple life cycles ( only sporulation and replication states for yeast and bacillus ) and similar nutritional requirements ( all of them are chemoheterotrophs absorbing molecules from the medium )",
    ". however , a more complex behaviour appears associated to the cell cycle control in yeast . as a consequence",
    ", these relatively simple organisms may operate under comparable external inputs and a similar grn organisation would be expected .",
    "this is consistent with the different output behaviour observed in yeast and bacteria .",
    "it is reasonable to think that this difference should originate by the different wiring displayed in these grns .",
    "yeast and bacteria drastically differ in their genomic organisation and cellular compartmentalisation , the two most distinctive features distinguishing eukaryotes from prokaryotes .",
    "it is widely accepted that spatial compartmentalisation and intronic organisation confer a more diverse regulatory behaviour @xcite and genomic plasticity .",
    "grn structures could be thus understandable as alternative evolutionary solutions .",
    "more complex wiring in yeast , in contrast to bacteria , would be the basis for this differential computational behaviour .",

    "interestingly , when the dynamical module is contracted to a single vertex , the resulting graph is a directed , acyclic graph ( figure [ dbb definition]c ) .",
    "such an operation is commonly referred in the literature as the _ condensation _ of a graph @xcite .",
    "accordingly , we can construct a new condensed graph , @xmath91 where @xmath92 and @xmath93 is the set of links connecting the different dynamical modules .",
    "in other words , we collapse the elements of every dynamical module into a single node and we let the links connecting different modules of the component of the @xmath17 we are working in . notice that , as a consequence , we can not state that @xmath94 interestingly , when we consider these @xmath95 s as single vertices of @xmath96 , we obtain a feed - forward graph .",
    "it is precisely the feed - forward organisation what enables us to define an order relation among the elements of @xmath17 .",
    "such an order relation can be interpreted as the dynamical hierarchy of the network s dynamical core and it is defined among the different modules of @xmath97 . if we define @xmath98 as the set of all existing directed walks over all nodes of @xmath96 , we can define the order relation `` @xmath99 '' as : @xmath100 such an order relation is called the _ transitive closure _ of the graph @xmath101 @xcite .",
    "the above order relation provides our definition of causal hierarchy .",

    "<S> gene regulatory networks constitute the first layer of the cellular computation for cell adaptation and surveillance . in these webs , a set of causal relations is built up from thousands of interactions between transcription factors and their target genes . </S>",
    "<S> the large size of these webs and their entangled nature make difficult to achieve a global view of their internal organisation . here , this problem has been addressed through a comparative study for _ escherichia coli _ , _ bacillus subtilis _ and _ saccharomyces cerevisiae _ gene regulatory networks . </S>",
    "<S> we extract the minimal core of causal relations , uncovering the hierarchical and modular organisation from a novel dynamical / causal perspective . </S>",
    "<S> our results reveal a marked top - down hierarchy containing several small dynamical modules for _ e. coli _ and _ b. subtilis_. conversely , the yeast network displays a single but large dynamical module in the middle of a bow - tie structure . </S>",
    "<S> we found that these dynamical modules capture the relevant wiring among both common and organism - specific biological functions such as transcription initiation , metabolic control , signal transduction , response to stress , sporulation and cell cycle . </S>",
    "<S> functional and topological results suggest that two fundamentally different forms of logic organisation may have evolved in bacteria and yeast . </S>"
