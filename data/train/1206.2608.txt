    "how densely can one pack given objects into a given container ? problems of this sort , generally called _ packing problems _ , are fundamental problems in geometric optimization .",
    "an important example having a rich history is the sphere packing problem .",

    "is given by placing open disks centered at the points of the hexagonal lattice . in three dimensions ,",
    "the statement that the best sphere packing has density  @xmath1 was known as kepler s conjecture ; it was proved by hales  @xcite in 1998 by means of a computer - assisted proof .    currently , one of the best methods for obtaining upper bounds for the density of sphere packings is due to cohn and elkies  @xcite . in 2003",
    "they used linear programming to obtain the best known upper bounds for the densities of sphere packings in dimensions  @xmath2 .",
    "they almost closed the gap between lower and upper bounds in dimensions  @xmath3 and  @xmath4 .",
    "their method is the noncompact version of the linear programming method of delsarte , goethals , and seidel  @xcite for upper - bounding the densities of packings of spherical caps on the unit sphere .    from a physical point of view",
    ", packings of spheres of different sizes are relevant as they can be used to model chemical mixtures which consist of multiple atoms or , more generally , to model the structure of composite material . for more about technological applications of these kind of systems of polydisperse , totally impenetrable spheres we refer to torquato ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 6 ) . in recent work , hopkins ,",
    "jiao , stillinger , and torquato  @xcite presented lower bounds for the densities of packings of spheres of two different sizes , also called _ binary sphere packings_.    in coding theory , packings of spheres of different sizes are important in the design of error - correcting codes which can be used for unequal error protection .",
    "masnick and wolf  @xcite were the first who considered codes with this property .    in this paper",
    "we extend the linear programming method of cohn and elkies to obtain new upper bounds for the densities of multiple - size sphere packings .",
    "we also extend the linear programming method of delsarte , goethals , and seidel to obtain new upper bounds for the densities of multiple - size spherical cap packings .",
    "we perform explicit calculations for binary packings in both cases using semidefinite , instead of linear , programming .",

    "we model the packing problems using tools from combinatorial optimization .",
    "all possible positions of the objects which we can use for the packing are vertices of a graph and we draw edges between two vertices whenever the two corresponding objects can not be simultaneously present in the packing because they overlap in their interiors .",
    "now every independent set in this conflict graph gives a valid packing and vice versa . to determine the density of the packing we use vertex weights since we want to distinguish between `` small '' and `` big '' objects .",

    "grtschel , lovsz , and schrijver  @xcite defined a graph parameter that gives an upper bound for  @xmath14 and which can be computed efficiently by semidefinite optimization .",
    "it can be presented in many different , yet equivalent ways , but the one convenient for us is @xmath15    here we give a proof of the fact that @xmath16 upper bounds @xmath13 . in a sense , after discarding the analytical arguments in the proofs of theorems  [ thm : sphere ] and  [ thm : space ] , we are left with this simple proof .",

    "we can construct natural multiple - size spherical cap packings by taking the incircles of the faces of spherical archimedean tilings .",
    "a sequence of binary packings is for instance obtained by taking the incircles of the prism tilings .",
    "these are the archimedean tilings with vertex figure @xmath106 for @xmath107 ( although strictly speaking for @xmath108 this is a spherical platonic tiling ) .",
    "the question then is whether the packing associated with the @xmath50-prism has maximal density among all packings with the same cap angles @xmath109 and @xmath110 , that is , whether the packing is _",
    "maximal_. the packing for @xmath111 is not maximal while the one for @xmath108 trivially is , since here there is only one cap size , and adding a @xmath6th cap yields a density greater than  @xmath112 .",
    "heppes and kertsz  @xcite showed that the configurations for @xmath113 are maximal , and the remaining case @xmath114 was later shown to maximal by florian and heppes  @xcite .",

    "this linear system together with the additional assumptions @xmath128 has a one - dimensional space of solutions from which it is easy to select one which fulfills all requirements of theorem  [ thm : sphere ] .    for the remaining @xmath129 archimedean solids in dimension",
    "@xmath97 we are only able to show maximality of the packing associated to the truncated octahedron , the archimedean solid with vertex figure @xmath130 .",
    "its density is @xmath131 , the geometric bound shows that the density is at most @xmath132 , and using the semidefinite program we get @xmath133 as an upper bound .",
    "the first packing with caps of angles @xmath134 and @xmath135 which would be denser is obtained by taking @xmath136 of the smaller caps and @xmath5 of the bigger caps , and has density @xmath137 the upper bounds show however that it is not possible to obtain this dense a packing , thus showing that the truncated octahedron packing is maximal .",
    "we also used our programs to plot the upper bounds for @xmath70 , the classical linear programming bound of delsarte , goethals , and seidel  @xcite , for dimensions @xmath138 , @xmath5 , and  @xmath116 in figure  [ fig : single sized cap bounds ] . to the best of our knowledge these kinds of plots were not made before and they seem to reveal interesting properties of the bound . for better orientation we show in the plots the packings where the linear programming bound is sharp ( cf .",
    "levenshtein  @xcite ; cohn and kumar  @xcite proved the much stronger statement that these packings provide point configurations which are universally optimal ) .",
    "the dotted line in the plot for @xmath138 is the geometric bound , and since we know that both the geometric ( cf .",
    "florian  @xcite ) and the semidefinite programming bounds are sharp for the given configurations , we know that at these peaks the bounds meet .",
    "an interesting feature of the upper bound seems to be that it has some periodic behavior .",
    "indeed , the numerical results suggest that for @xmath139 , the two bounds in fact meet infinitely often as the angle decreases , and that between any two of these meeting points the semidefinite programming bound has a similar shape . although in higher dimensions we do not have a geometric bound , the semidefinite programming bound seems to admit the same kind of periodic behavior .",
    "we applied theorem  [ thm : space ] to compute upper bounds for the densities of binary sphere packings .",
    "the results we obtained are summarized in the plot of figure  [ fig : space - plots ] , where we show bounds computed for dimensions  @xmath140 ,  ,  @xmath116 .",

    "we refer to the introduction in the paper of heppes  @xcite which surveys the known results about binary circle packings in the plane .",
    "currently one of the best - known upper bounds for the maximum density of a binary circle packing is due to florian  @xcite .",
    "florian s bound states that a packing of circles in which the ratio between the radii of the smallest and largest circles is  @xmath141 has density at most @xmath142 and that this bound is achieved exactly for  @xmath143 ( i.e. , for classical circle packings ) and for  @xmath144 in the limit .",
    "the question arises of which bound is better , our bound or florian s bound . from our experiments , it seems that our bound is worse than florian s bound , at least for  @xmath145 .",
    "for instance , for  @xmath146 we obtain the upper bound  @xmath147 , whereas florian s bound is  @xmath148 whether this really means that the bound of theorem  [ thm : space ] is worse than florian s bound , or just that the computational approach of section  [ sec : euclidean space computations ] is too restrictive to attain his bound , we do not know .",
    "it is interesting to note that for  @xmath143 , that is , for packings of circles of one size , our bound clearly coincides with the one of cohn and elkies  @xcite .",

    "_ dimension 3.__much less is known in dimension @xmath150 .",
    "in fact we do not know about other attempts to find upper bounds for the densities of binary sphere packings in dimensions  @xmath150 and higher .",
    "let us compare our upper bound with the lower bound by hopkins , jiao , stillinger , and torquato  @xcite .",
    "the record holder for @xmath151 in terms of highest density occurs for @xmath152 and its density is @xmath153 our computations show that there can not be a packing with this @xmath141 having density more than @xmath154 , so this leaves a margin of  @xmath155 .    another interesting case is @xmath156 here the best - known lower bound of @xmath157 comes from the nacl - alloy .",
    "the large spheres are centered at a face centered cubic lattice and the small spheres are centered at a translated copy of the face centered cubic lattice so that they form a jammed packing .",
    "our upper bound for @xmath158 is @xmath159 , less than  @xmath160 away from the lower bound .",
    "therefore , we believe that proving optimality of the nacl - alloy might be doable .    _",
    "_ dimension 4 and beyond.__in higher dimensions even less is known about binary sphere packings .",
    "we observed from figure  [ fig : space - plots ] that it seems that the upper bound is decreasing : as the radius of the small sphere increases from  @xmath161 to  @xmath112 , the bound seems to decrease .",
    "this suggests that the bound given by theorem  [ thm : space ] is decreasing in this sense , but we do not know a proof of this .",
    "we also do not know the limit behavior of our bound when  @xmath141 approaches  @xmath162 .",
    "due to numerical instabilities we could not perform numerical calculations in this regime of  @xmath141 .",
