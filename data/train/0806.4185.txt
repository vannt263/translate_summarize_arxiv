    "@xcite were focused on the linearized level , i.e. , perturbing around an ads@xmath6 background .    in the present work we go beyond the linearized approximation and perform a non - perturbative ( classical ) canonical analysis of cctmg ( see also refs .",
    "our main goal is to derive the dimension of the physical phase space , which allows us to deduce the number of physical bulk degrees of freedom .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ se:2 ]",
    "we present a new chern ",
    "simons formulation of cosmological topologically massive gravity . in section [ se:3 ]",
    "we focus on the chiral point and establish the hamiltonian formulation , identifying all primary , secondary and ternary constraints . in section [ se:4 ] we perform a constraint analysis and check the first / second class properties of all constraints , which allows us to establish the dimension of the physical phase space . in section [ se:5 ]",
    "we conclude .",
    "our conventions are as follows .",
    "we use greek spacetime indices and latin frame indices .",
    "the former are raised and lowered with the spacetime metric @xmath0 and the latter with the flat metric @xmath7 .",
    "both have signature @xmath8 . for the dreibein @xmath9",
    "we choose @xmath10 .",
    "when writing @xmath11-forms we usually suppress the spacetime indices , e.g.  @xmath12 denotes the 1-form @xmath13 .",
    "we disregard boundary terms in the present work , so equivalences between actions have to be true only up to total derivatives .      instead of the action which functionally depends on the metric one",
    "can equivalently use the action @xmath14=\\int \\big[2e^a \\wedge r_a({\\omega } ) + \\frac{1}{3\\ell^2}\\,{\\varepsilon}_{abc}\\,e^a\\wedge e^b\\wedge e^c-\\frac1\\mu\\ , { \\rm cs}({\\omega})\\big ]   \\label{eq : can0}\\ ] ] which functionally depends on the dreibein . the gravitational chern ",
    "simons term @xmath15 and the ( dualized ) curvature 2-form @xmath16 depend both exclusively on the ( dualized ) connection defined by @xmath17 .",
    "note that the connection is not varied independently in the formulation , but rather it is the levi - civita connection , i.e. , metric compatible @xmath18 and torsion - free , @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the torsion 2-form .",
    "this means that @xmath21 in has to be expressed in terms of @xmath12 ( and derivatives thereof ) before variation .    for our purposes",
    "it is very convenient to employ a formulation where we can vary independently the dreibein and the connection @xcite .",
    "this is achieved by supplementing the action with a lagrange multiplier term enforcing the torsion constraint , @xmath22=\\int \\big[2e^a \\wedge r_a + \\frac{1}{3\\ell^2}\\,{\\varepsilon}_{abc}\\,e^a\\wedge e^b\\wedge e^c-\\frac1\\mu\\ , { \\rm cs}({\\omega})+{\\lambda}^a\\wedge t_a\\big ] .",
    "\\label{eq : can1a}\\ ] ] the first order action is classically equivalent @xcite to the second order action . this can be shown as follows .",
    "varying with respect to @xmath23 and @xmath24 establishes the condition of vanishing torsion and an algebraic relation for @xmath25 , @xmath26 in terms of dreibein , connection and derivatives thereof .",
    "thus , both @xmath24 and @xmath25 can be expressed in terms of the dreibein , and first and second derivatives thereof .",
    "varying with respect to the dreibein and plugging into that equation the relations for @xmath25 and @xmath24 in terms of @xmath27 yields a set of third order partial differential equations in @xmath27 . using the defining relation between dreibein and metric , @xmath28 , finally establishes @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the einstein tensor ( including cosmological constant ) and @xmath31 is essentially the cotton tensor .",
    "the equations of motion also follow directly from varying the second order action with respect to the metric .",
    "we make now some field redefinitions to further simplify the action .",
    "we shift the lagrange multiplier @xmath32 and obtain @xmath22=\\int \\big[2e^a \\wedge r_a + \\frac{1}{3\\ell^2}\\,{\\varepsilon}_{abc}\\,e^a\\wedge e^b\\wedge e^c-\\frac1\\mu\\ , { \\rm cs}({\\omega})+\\big({\\lambda}^a-\\frac{e^a}{\\mu\\ell^2}\\big)\\wedge t_a\\big ]   \\label{eq : can1}\\ ] ] in the absence of the @xmath33-term in , the well - known field redefinitions @xmath34 turn the action into a difference of two chern  simons terms @xcite .",
    "curiously , under the same redefinitions the lagrange multiplier term can be recast into a difference of two einstein  hilbert terms , where @xmath35 plays the role of the dreibein : @xmath36= \\big(1-\\frac{1}{\\mu\\ell}\\big)i_{\\rm cs}[a]+i_{eh}[{\\lambda},a]-\\big(1+\\frac{1}{\\mu\\ell}\\big)i_{\\rm cs}[\\tilde a]-i_{\\rm eh}[{\\lambda},\\tilde a ] .",

    "the reformulation of the action as difference of chern  simons and einstein - hilbert terms seems to be new .",
    "it is worthwhile repeating that in both einstein ",
    "hilbert terms the lagrange multiplier @xmath40 formally plays the role of a ` dreibein ' .",
    "this suggests that @xmath40 should be invertible .",
    "we have checked that for pure ads@xmath6 [ which obviously solves the field equations ] the symmetric tensor @xmath41 is proportional to the metric .",
    "thus , requiring invertibility of @xmath40 is necessary in general to guarantee invertibility of the metric .",
    "the advantage of the formulation is twofold . because the action contains only first derivatives ( linearly ) a canonical analysis is facilitated .",
    "moreover , at the chiral point @xmath42 one of the chern ",
    "simons terms vanishes .",

    "@xcite if an action is already in first order form a convenient short - cut exists . in the present case",
    "this short - cut consists basically of picking the appropriate sets of fields as canonical coordinates and momenta , respectively .",
    "we use the 18 fields @xmath47 as canonical coordinates and introduce the notation @xmath48 like in electrodynamics or non - abelian gauge theory the momenta @xmath49 of the zero components @xmath50 are primary constraints . the simplest way to deal with them",
    "is to exclude the pairs @xmath51 from the phase space and to treat the @xmath50 as lagrange multipliers for the secondary constraints ( `` gauss constraints '' ) .",
    "this reduces the dimension of our phase space to 18 .",
    "the 9 momenta @xmath52 , @xmath53 depend linearly on the fields @xmath54 .",
    "these fields are not contained in our set of canonical coordinates .    the hamiltonian action is now determined as @xmath55 = \\int d^3x \\,\\big(p_{i\\,a } \\dot q^a_i -{\\cal h}\\big)\\ , ,   \\label{eq : can11}\\ ] ] where the hamiltonian density @xmath56 is a sum over secondary constraints @xmath57 , as expected on general grounds",

    "we have found 9 secondary constraints @xmath64 .",
    "if all of them were first class then the physical phase space would be zero - dimensional , because each first class constraint eliminates two dimensions from the phase space , and the dimension of the phase space spanned by @xmath65 is 18 .      with the canonical poisson bracket @xmath66 we can now calculate the poisson brackets of the constraints @xmath64 with each other and with the hamiltonian density .",
    "the latter , @xmath67 reduce to a sum over brackets between the secondary constraints .",
    "we calculate now these brackets explicitly .    to this end",
    "we express the secondary constraints - in terms of canonical coordinates and momenta : @xmath68 note that instead of @xmath69 we use for convenience the linear combination @xmath70 .",
    "straightforward calculation obtains : @xmath71 we have used here the abbreviations @xmath72 or , equivalently ,",
    "@xmath73 if the quantities @xmath74 were all vanishing then all secondary constraints would be first class . since some of them are non - vanishing we have a certain number of second class constraints .",
    "namely , not all entries of @xmath75 can vanish because this would lead to a singular dreibein @xmath12 .",
    "similarly , not all entries @xmath76 can vanish because this would lead to a singular lagrange multiplier 1-form @xmath40 . since the algebra of constraints does not close we shall encounter ternary constraints from consistency requirements , namely the vanishing of the poisson brackets .    in the analysis below",
    ", the @xmath77-matrix @xmath78 evaluated on the surface of constraints will play a crucial role .",
    "first , note that before imposing the ternary constraints we can establish an upper bound on the dimension @xmath79 of the physical phase space in terms of the rank @xmath80 of @xmath81 .",
    "we started with a phase space of dimension @xmath82 and accounted for @xmath83 constraints .",
    "the rank @xmath80 counts how many of these that are second class .",
    "thus , before additional constraints are introduced we have @xmath84 now we turn to the ternary constraints .",
    "we note that after imposing these we are done , since the consistency conditions analog to arising from the @xmath85 do not generate quaternary constraints . since the algebra",
    " closes on @xmath86-functions , requiring vanishing of the brackets is equivalent to requiring @xmath87 because the ternary constraints @xmath85 contain the canonical partners of the primary constraints @xmath49 complications arise , since some of the latter may lose their status as first class constraints .",
    "thus we have to include the @xmath50 as canonical variables , giving a phase space of dimension @xmath88 before imposing the constraints .",
    "we determine now the rank of the @xmath89 matrix @xmath90 evaluated on the surface of constraints using the order @xmath91 . because of we have @xmath92 and",
    "thus @xmath93 has the block form @xmath94 where all the blocks are @xmath95 matrices .",
    "the form of the non - vanishing matrices @xmath96 and @xmath97 is not needed for determining a lower bound for the rank of @xmath93 .",
    "we can put all copies of @xmath98 and @xmath99 on lower triangular form by row - operations that do not spoil the block structure of .",
    "this makes @xmath93 lower triangular with @xmath100 non zero anti - diagonal elements .",
    "thus , a lower bound for the rank @xmath101 of @xmath93 is @xmath100 .",
    "we are now in a position to count the number of linearly independent first- and second - class constraints .",
    "we have @xmath101 second class constraints .",
    "the total number of constraints is 9(primary ) @xmath102 9(secondary ) @xmath102 9(ternary ) @xmath103 , but out of the nine ternary constraints @xmath85 , only @xmath80 are linearly independent .",
    "this is so because of .",
    "thus , the total number of linearly independent constraints is @xmath104 , and @xmath101 of these are second class .",
    "the dimension @xmath79 of the physical phase space is therefore bounded by @xmath105 the two inequalities and establish @xmath106 .",
    "thus , all that remains is to determine the rank of @xmath98 . using the order @xmath107",
    ", @xmath98 has the block form @xmath108 the block entries @xmath109 contain @xmath110 rows and @xmath111 columns of zeros . from",
    "we deduce that the rank of the antisymmetric matrix @xmath112 must be either six , four or two .",
    "its nine eigenvalues @xmath113 are given by @xmath114 therefore its rank equals ( at most ) four , and not six as suggested by naive counting .",
    "the polynomial under the square root in the last expression in is given by @xmath115 the rank of is four in general and two if in addition the condition @xmath116 holds .",
    "because of on - shell we obtain @xmath117 where ric@xmath118 is the ricci 1-form with respect to the levi - civita connection ( we recall that on - shell torsion vanishes ) .",
    "thus , the constraint must hold on all classical solutions . therefore , in the physically relevant sector , @xmath119 .",
    "this completes our constraint analysis . ]",
    "these constraints render the constraints @xmath120 and @xmath85 superfluous .",
    "thus , we have now 24 linearly independent constraints , @xmath49 , @xmath121 , @xmath122 , @xmath123 , @xmath124 , @xmath125 .",
    "the rank of the @xmath126 matrix analog to turns out to be equal to twelve .",
    "therefore , we have now twelve first class and twelve second class constraints , which eliminates all dimensions from the phase space .",
    "thus no physical bulk degrees of freedom remain .",
    "this is the anticipated result . ]    to summarize , the dimension of the physical phase space is two and therefore cctmg exhibits one physical bulk degree of freedom , which at the linearized level coincides with the topologically massive graviton .",
    "in this paper we have reformulated cosmological topologically massive gravity at the chiral point as a chern  simons action plus the difference between two einstein  hilbert actions , see .",
    "we have performed a canonical analysis and recovered the anticipated ' , i.e. , a 6-dimensional physical phase space .",
    "this result disagrees with ours and with previous literature , but it is then interpreted as a single graviton degree of freedom , concurrent with our result .",

    "result of one physical bulk degree of freedom , which at the linearized level corresponds to the topologically massive graviton .",
    "we have also encountered sectors of our first order theory that are not related to the second order formulation with regular field configurations , but that may be worthwhile studying in their own right .",
    "for instance , if one imposes by hand the constraints @xmath127 then no ternary constraints arise , but the dreibein and lagrange multiplier fail to be invertible .    finally , we mention that the poisson bracket algebra of the secondary constraints - closes with @xmath128-functions rather than with first derivatives thereof because of our gauge theoretic reformulation of cctmg .",
