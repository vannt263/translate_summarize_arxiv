    "the situation is changed when the dynamic nonlinearity is taken into account .",
    "the crucial point is that the dynamic equation for the magnetic part of the @xmath4-effect ( _ i.e. , _ the dynamic nonlinearity ) includes the flux of the magnetic helicity . without the flux ,",
    "the total magnetic helicity is conserved locally and the level of the saturated mean magnetic field is very low @xcite .",
    "the flux of the magnetic helicity results in that the total magnetic helicity is not conserved locally because the magnetic helicity of small - scale magnetic fluctuations is redistributed by a helicity flux . in this case",
