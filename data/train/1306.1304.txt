    "multi - hop networks , in various forms , e.g. wireless sensor networks , underwater networks , vehicular networks , mesh networks and unmanned aerial vehicle formations , and under various names , e.g. ad - hoc networks , hybrid networks , delay tolerant networks and intermittently connected networks , are being increasingly used in military and civilian applications .",
    "studying the capacity of these networks is an important problem . since the seminal work of gupta and kumar @xcite , extensive research has been done in the area .",
    "particularly , in @xcite gupta and kumar considered an ad - hoc network with a total of @xmath0 nodes uniformly and _ i.i.d .",
    "_ on an area of unit size .",
    "furthermore , each node is capable of transmitting at @xmath1 bit / s and using a fixed and identical transmission range .",
    "they showed that the transport capacity and the achievable per - node throughput , when each node randomly and independently chooses another node in the network as its destination , are @xmath2 and @xmath3 respectively[multiblock footnote omitted ] .",
    "when the nodes are optimally and deterministically placed to maximize throughput , the transport capacity and the achievable per - node throughput become @xmath4 and @xmath5 respectively .",
    "in @xcite , franceschetti _ et al .",
    "_ considered essentially the same random network as that in @xcite except that nodes in the network are allowed to use two different transmission ranges .",
    "the link capacity between a pair of directly connected nodes is determined by their sinr through the shannonhartley theorem .",
    "they showed that by having each source - destination pair transmitting via the so - called `` highway system '' , formed by nodes using the smaller transmission range , the transport capacity and the per - node throughput can also reach @xmath6 and @xmath7 respectively even when nodes are randomly deployed .",
    "the existence of such highways was established using the percolation theory @xcite . in @xcite grossglauser and",
    "tse showed that in mobile networks , by leveraging on the nodes mobility , a per - node throughput of @xmath8 can be achieved at the expense of unbounded delay .",
    "their work @xcite has sparked huge interest in studying the capacity - delay tradeoffs in mobile networks assuming various mobility models and the obtained results often vary greatly with the different mobility models being considered , see @xcite and references therein for examples . in @xcite , chen et al . studied the capacity of wireless networks under a different traffic distribution .",
    "in particular , they considered a set of @xmath0 randomly deployed nodes transmitting to single sink or multiple sinks where the sinks can be either regularly deployed or randomly deployed .",
    "they showed that with single sink , the transport capacity is given by @xmath9 ; with @xmath10 sinks , the transport capacity is increased to @xmath11 when @xmath12 or @xmath13 when @xmath14 .",
    "furthermore , there is also significant amount of work studying the impact of infrastructure nodes @xcite and multiple - access protocols @xcite on the capacity and the multicast capacity @xcite .",
    "we refer readers to @xcite for a comprehensive review of related work .",
    "the above efforts have led to many sophisticated and customized analytical studies on the capacity of particular networks .",
    "the obtained results often vary greatly with even a slight change in the scenario being investigated .",
    "while most of the analyses are intellectually challenging , they lack universal properties that can be extended to study the capacity of a different network . in this paper , we sift through these capacity - impacting parameters , e.g. mobility , traffic distribution , spatial node distribution , the capability of nodes to adjust their transmission power , the presence of infrastructure nodes , multiple - access protocols and scheduling algorithms , and present a simple relationship that can be used to estimate the capacity of wireless multi - hop networks .",
    "in addition to capacity , delay is also an important performance metric that has been extensively investigated . in this paper",
    "we focus on the study of capacity .",
    "we refer readers to @xcite for relevant work on delay .",
    "the main contribution of this paper is the development of a simple relationship for estimating the capacity of wireless multi - hop networks applicable to various different scenarios .",
    "the following is a detailed summary of our contributions :    * considering an arbitrary network , we show that the network capacity is determined by the link capacity , the average number of simultaneous transmissions , and the average number of transmissions required to deliver a packet to its destination ; * we extend the above relationship for arbitrary networks to random networks ; * we apply our new result to determine the asymptotic capacity of several typical random networks considered in the literature @xcite .",
    "the capacity analysis using the aforementioned relationship often becomes simpler ; * based on the intuitive understanding gained from our result , we point out limitations of some existing results and suggest further improvements ; * furthermore , using our result , the capacity analysis for different networks can be transformed into the analysis of the three key parameters , i.e. the link capacity , the average number of simultaneous transmissions , and the average number of transmissions required to deliver a packet to its destination .",
    "therefore our work makes important contributions towards developing a generic methodology for network capacity analysis that is applicable to a variety of different scenarios .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : section [ sec : network - models ] gives a formal definition of the network models and notations considered in the paper .",
    "section [ sec : capacity - of - static - networks ] gives the main results in this paper on the capacity of arbitrary networks and random networks . in section [ sec : applicability of the result ] , we demonstrate wide applications of our result by using it to analyze the asymptotic capacity of various random networks considered in the literature @xcite .",
    "finally section [ sec : conclusion - and - further ] concludes this paper .",
    "we consider two classes of networks in this paper : _ arbitrary networks _ and _ random networks_.      we use the term arbitrary network to refer to a network with a total of @xmath0 nodes arbitrarily and deterministically ( i.e. not randomly ) placed in a bounded area @xmath15 initially .",
    "these nodes may be either stationary or moving following arbitrary and fixed ( i.e. not random ) trajectories .",
    "a node may choose an arbitrary and fixed number of other nodes as its destination(s ) .",
    "in the case that a source node has multiple destination nodes , the source node may transmit the same packets to its destinations , viz .",
    "multicast , or transmit different portions of its packets to different destinations , viz .",
    "packets are transmitted from a source to its destination(s ) via multiple intermediate relay nodes .",
    "each node can be either a source , a relay , a destination or a mixture .",
    "it is assumed that there are always packets waiting at the source nodes to be transmitted , viz .",
    "a so - called saturated traffic scenario is considered .",
    "let @xmath16 be the node set .",
    "let @xmath17 be the set of links .",
    "the establishment of a link between a pair of nodes may follow either the protocol model or the physical model @xcite .",
    "our analysis does not depend on the particular way a link is established .",
    "when nodes are mobile , the link between a pair of nodes may only exist temporarily and the link set at a particular time instant @xmath18 may be more appropriately denoted by @xmath19 to emphasize its temporal dependence . in this paper",
    ", we drop the subscript @xmath18 for convenience .",
    "it is assumed that there is a spatial and temporal path between every source and destination pair .    without loss of generality@xcite",
    ", we further assume that each node can transmit at a fixed and known data rate of @xmath1 bits per second over a common wireless channel .",
    "following the same analytical approach as that in @xcite , it can be shown that it is immaterial to our result if the channel is broken into several subchannels of capacity @xmath20 bits per second , as long as @xmath21 .",
    "this assumption allows us to ignore some physical layer details and focus on the topological aspects of the network that determine the capacity .",
    "our result however can be readily extended to incorporate the situation that each link has a different and known capacity .",
    "we do not consider the impact of erroneous transmissions in our analysis .",
    "transmission errors will cause a decrease in the effective link capacity and its impact can be captured in the parameter @xmath1 , which is assumed to be known .    denote the above network by @xmath22 and in this paper , we study the capacity of @xmath22 .    in the following paragraphs , we give a formal definition of the capacity of @xmath22 .",
    "let @xmath23 be a source node and let @xmath24 be the @xmath25 bit transmitted from @xmath26 to its destination .",
    "let @xmath27 be the destination of @xmath24 . for unicast transmission",
    ", @xmath27 represents single destination ; for multicast transmission , @xmath27 represents the set of all destinations of @xmath24 .",
    "let @xmath28 be the number of bits transmitted by @xmath26 _ and _ which reached , i.e. successfully received by , their respective destinations during a time interval @xmath29 $ ] , with @xmath30 being an arbitrarily large number .",
    "the superscript @xmath31 denotes the spatial and temporal scheduling algorithm used in the network and @xmath32 denotes the set of all scheduling algorithms . if the same bit is transmitted from a source to multiple destinations , e.g. in the case of multicast , it is counted as one bit in the calculation of @xmath28 .    it is assumed that the network is _ stable _ @xmath33 . a network is called _ stable _ if and only if for any fixed @xmath0 , assuming that each node has an infinite queue , the queue length in any intermediate relay node storing packets in transit does not grow towards infinity as @xmath34 , or equivalently the long - term incoming traffic rate into the network equals the long - term outgoing traffic rate .",
    "it is further assumed that there is no traffic loss due to queue overflow .",
    "the transport capacity when using the spatial and temporal scheduling algorithm @xmath35 , denoted by @xmath36 , is defined as :    @xmath37    and the transport capacity of the network is defined as @xmath38 obviously @xmath39 .",
    "an important special case occurs when the scheduling algorithm divides the transport capacity equally among all source - destination pairs asymptotically over time .",
    "denote by @xmath40 the set of _ fair _ scheduling algorithms that divide the transport capacity equally among all @xmath41 source - destination pairs asymptotically over time .",
    "the throughput per source - destination pair is defined as @xmath42    the above definitions of the transport capacity and throughput capacity are valid for both finite @xmath0 and asymptotically infinite @xmath0 .",
    "in addition to arbitrary networks , random networks have also been extensively studied in the literature , particularly the asymptotic properties of random networks as the number of nodes @xmath0 approaches infinity @xcite . by a random network , we mean a network with a total of @xmath0 nodes and each node is i.i.d . in a bounded area @xmath15 initially following a known distribution .",
    "if these nodes are mobile , their trajectories may also be random and i.i.d . a link between a pair of nodes in a random network may be established following either the protocol model or the physical model @xcite .",
    "denote the above random network by @xmath43 to distinguish it from the arbitrary network considered in the previous subsection .    given the randomness involved in the problem statement ,",
    "the above definitions of throughput capacity for arbitrary networks need to be modified to account for `` vanishingly small probabilities '' @xcite .",
    "particularly , for asymptotic random networks whose number of nodes @xmath0 is sufficiently large , we say that under the spatial and temporal scheduling algorithm @xmath35 , the transport capacity of @xmath43 is @xmath36 if and only if @xmath36 is the _ maximum _ transport capacity that can be achieved _ asymptotically almost surely ( a.a.s . ) _ as _ @xmath44 _ under @xmath35 .",
    "given the above modification on @xmath36 , the transport capacity of an arbitrary network defined in ( [ eq : definition of capacity ] ) can still be used for random networks .",
    "the most extensively studied traffic distribution in random networks involves each node choosing another node independently as its destination and the transport capacity being divided equally among all source - destination pairs . in that case , the total number of source - destination pairs equals @xmath0 and the capacity of the network is often studied using the metric known as the _ per - node throughput _ or the _",
    "throughput capacity_. denote by @xmath40 the set of _ fair _ scheduling algorithms that divide the transport capacity equally among all @xmath0 source - destination pairs asymptotically over time .",
    "the per - node throughput ( or throughput capacity ) is defined as @xmath45    intuitively , a scheduling algorithm @xmath35 is fair if it divides the transport capacity equally among all source - destination pairs asymptotically over time and also distributes traffic evenly across @xmath15 such that there is no traffic hot spot . for nodes uniformly and i.i.d .",
    "on @xmath15 and each node choosing another node independently as its destination , which is the scenario studied in sections [ sub : capacity - of - random ] and [ sec : applicability of the result ] , the technique is well known to establish the ( asymptotic ) fairness of a scheduling algorithm @xmath35 , or to construct a ( asymptotically ) fair scheduling algorithm .",
    "it typically involves partitioning @xmath15 into a set of equal - size sub - areas , allocating transmission opportunities equally among all sub - areas and then demonstrating that using @xmath35 , the number of source - destination pairs crossing each sub - area varies by at most a constant factor .",
    "the conclusion readily follows that the throughput obtainable by each source - destination pair varies by at most a constant factor and each source - destination pair has access to throughput of the same order asymptotically , see @xcite for examples .",
    "the set of scheduling algorithms analyzed in section [ sec : applicability of the result ] are known to be fair in the sense that _ a.a.s .",
    "_ , each source - destination pair can achieve a throughput of the same order .",
    "note that the above definitions of transport capacity and throughput capacity for random networks are consistent with those in @xcite . particularly in @xcite , a throughput capacity of @xmath46 bits per second",
    "is called _ feasible _ if there is a spatial and temporal scheme for scheduling transmissions such that every node can send @xmath46 bits per second on average to its chosen destination @xcite .",
    "the throughput capacity of random networks with @xmath0 node is of order @xmath47 bits per second if there are deterministic constants @xmath48 and @xmath49 such that @xmath50 @xmath51",
    "in this section , we analyze the capacity of arbitrary networks and the capacity of random networks respectively .",
    "the following theorem on the capacity of arbitrary networks summarizes a major result of the paper :    [ thm : capacity relationship for policy pi]consider an arbitrary network @xmath22 .",
    "let @xmath35 be the spatial and temporal scheduling algorithm used in @xmath22 .",
    "let @xmath52 be the average number of transmissions required to deliver a randomly chosen bit to its destination .",
    "let @xmath53 be the average number of simultaneous transmissions in @xmath22 , the transport capacity @xmath36 satisfies : @xmath54    recall from section [ sec : network - models ] that @xmath55 represents a source node , @xmath24 represents the @xmath25 bit transmitted from @xmath26 to its destination(s ) , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 is the number of bits successfully transmitted by @xmath26 during a time interval @xmath29 $ ] .",
    "let @xmath56 be the number of transmissions required to deliver @xmath24 to its destination ( or all destination nodes in @xmath27 in the case of multicast ) when the spatial and temporal scheduling algorithm @xmath31 is used .",
    "let @xmath57 be the number of simultaneous transmissions in the network @xmath22 at time @xmath18 .",
    "it follows from the definitions of @xmath52 and @xmath53 that    @xmath58    and @xmath59    let @xmath60 , @xmath61 be the time required to transmit @xmath24 in the @xmath62 transmission and assume that the transmitting node is active during the entire @xmath60 interval . as each node transmits at the same data rate @xmath1 , @xmath63 .",
    "given the above definitions , we are now ready to prove the theorem .    the technique used in the proof is based on first considering the _ total transmission time _ ,",
    "the amount of traffic transmitted , measured in bits , multiplied by the time required to transmit each bit , in the network on the individual node level by aggregating the transmissions at different nodes , viz . @xmath64 shown in the latter equations , and then evaluating the total transmission time in the network on the network level by considering the number of simultaneous transmissions in the entire network , viz . @xmath65 shown in the latter equations .",
    "obviously , the two values must be equal .",
    "on the basis of this observation , the theorem can be established .    at time @xmath30 , the total transmission time during @xmath29 $ ] is given by @xmath66 where @xmath64 accounts for the transmission time for traffic that has reached its destination and @xmath67 accounts for the transmission time for traffic still in transit at time @xmath30 .",
    "let @xmath68 be the maximum length , measured in the number of hops , of all routes in @xmath22 under @xmath35 , obviously @xmath69 .",
    "furthermore , since the network is stable , there exists a positive constant @xmath70 , independent of @xmath30 , such that the total amount of traffic in transit is bounded by @xmath71 .",
    "therefore @xmath72    on the other hand , the total transmission time during @xmath29 $ ] evaluated on the network level equals @xmath65 .",
    "obviously @xmath73    when @xmath30 is sufficiently large and the network is _ stable _ , using ( [ eq : inequality on maximum queue length ] ) , the amount of traffic in transit is negligibly small compared with the amount of traffic that has already reached its destination .",
    "therefore , the following relationship can be established :    @xmath74    noting that @xmath63 , equation ( [ eq : capacity of mobile and static networks ] ) follows readily by combing ( [ eq : definition of capacity using phi ] ) , ( [ eq : definition of average number of transmissions ] ) , ( [ eq : definition of ey ] ) and ( [ eq : fundamental relation between capacity and average transmission ] ) .    equation ( [ eq : capacity of mobile and static networks ] ) can also be obtained using little s formula @xcite .",
    "intuitively , defining the _ system _ as consisting of the set of all wireless channels in @xmath22 , the long - term average effective arrival rate into the system equals @xmath75 , the long - term average amount of traffic in the system equals @xmath53 and the average time in the system equals @xmath76 .",
    "equation ( [ eq : capacity of mobile and static networks ] ) then readily follows using little s formula .",
    "equation ( [ eq : capacity of mobile and static networks ] ) is obtained under a very generic setting and is applicable to networks of any size .",
    "it reveals that the network capacity can be readily determined by evaluating the average number of simultaneous transmissions @xmath53 , the average number of transmissions required for reaching the destinations @xmath52 and the link capacity @xmath1 .",
    "the two parameters @xmath53 and @xmath52 are often related .",
    "for example , in a network where each node transmits using a fixed transmission range @xmath77 , reducing @xmath77 ( while keeping the network connected ) will cause increases in both @xmath53 and @xmath52 and the converse . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath53 and @xmath52 also have their independent significance , and can be optimized and studied independently of each other .",
    "for example , an optimally designed routing algorithm can distribute traffic evenly and avoid creating bottlenecks which helps to significantly increase @xmath53 at the expense of slightly increased @xmath52 only , compared with the shortest - path routing .",
    "the following corollary is an easy consequence of theorem [ thm : capacity relationship for policy pi ] :    [ cor : capacity of arbitrary networks upper bound]under the same setting as that in theorem [ thm : capacity relationship for policy pi ] , @xmath78    corollary [ cor : capacity of arbitrary networks upper bound ] allows the two key parameters that determining the capacity of @xmath22 , viz . @xmath53 and @xmath52 to be studied separately .",
    "parameter @xmath79 is determined by the maximum number of transmissions that can be accommodated in the network area . assuming that each node transmits using a fixed transmission range @xmath77 , each transmission",
    "will then `` consume '' a disk area of radius at least @xmath80 in the sense that two simultaneous active transmitters must be separated by an euclidean distance of at least @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is a constant determined by the interference model @xcite .",
    "the problem of finding the maximum number of simultaneous transmissions , viz .",
    "@xmath83 , can be converted into one that finds the maximum number of non - overlapping equal - radius circles that can be packed into @xmath15 and then studied as a densest circle packing problem ( see @xcite for an example ) .",
    "parameter @xmath53 can also be studied as the transmission capacity of networks @xcite . for unicast transmission",
    ", @xmath52 becomes the average number of hops between two randomly chosen source - destination pairs and has been studied extensively @xcite .",
    "as will also be shown in section [ sec : applicability of the result ] , @xmath53 and @xmath52 can be optimized separately to maximize the network capacity .",
    "we now consider the capacity of random networks .",
    "note the connection between random networks and arbitrary networks that an instance of a random network forms an arbitrary network .",

    "such two functions @xmath85 and @xmath86 required by corollary [ cor : capacity of random networks ] do not necessarily exist or are very difficult to find .",

    "therefore our definition of transport capacity in section [ sec : network - models ] is consistent with the definition of the multicast transport capacity in @xcite and the results established in section [ sec : capacity - of - static - networks ] can be used directly here .",
    "we first consider the situation that @xmath303 .",
    "we will obtain an upper bound on the multicast transport capacity .",
    "it can be readily shown that @xmath304 .",
    "furthermore , it can be shown that _",
    "_ any multicast tree spanning @xmath305 nodes that are randomly placed in @xmath15 has a total edge length of at least @xmath306 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 9 ) where @xmath259 is a positive constant .",
    "it follows that @xmath307 .",
    "therefore , as an easy consequence of corollary [ cor : an upper bound on per - node throughput ] , @xmath308 .    to obtain a lower bound on the multicast transport capacity , a scheduling algorithm @xmath35 is constructed ( see @xcite for a detailed description of the scheduling algorithm @xmath35 ) . more specifically , @xmath15 is partitioned into non - overlapping squares and each square is of size @xmath309 .",
    "calling these squares cells , the total number of cells equals @xmath310 .",
    "furthermore , nodes located in adjacent cells are directly connected , where two cells are _ adjacent _ if they have at least one point in common . using the property that nodes are uniformly and i.i.d . ,",
    "_ _ every _ cell has at least one node ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 18 ) . dividing time into time slots of equal length",
    ", it can be shown that there exists a positive integer @xmath127 , independent of @xmath0 , such that every @xmath311 time slots , _ every _ cell gets at least one time slot to transit . using the above results , _",
    ".    choosing one node from each cell , it can be shown that these nodes form a connected component , termed _ connected dominating set_. all other nodes are directly connected to at least one node in the connected dominating set .",
    "multicast traffic is routed using the connected dominating set . using the result that for an arbitrary cell , _",
    "_ , the probability that a randomly chosen multicast flow is routed via the cell is at most @xmath313 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 20 ) , _ a.a.s . _",
    "the number of cells crossed by a randomly chosen multicast flow is at most @xmath314 . therefore _",
    "_ @xmath315 and @xmath316 .    combing the upper and lower bounds on the transport capacity",
    ", conclusion can be obtained that when @xmath303 , _ a.a.s .",
    "_ @xmath317 .",
    "when @xmath318 , the situation becomes slightly different .",
    "more specifically , the density of the multicast destination nodes becomes high enough such that the probability that a single transmission will deliver the packet to more than one multicast destination nodes becomes high .",
    "in fact , using the above connected dominating set , it can be shown that _",
    "_ the number of transmissions required to deliver a packet to all nodes ( hence the @xmath299 multicast destination nodes ) is at most @xmath310 , which is independent of @xmath305 .",
    "consequently @xmath319 .",
    "conclusion then readily follows that when @xmath318 , @xmath320 .",
    "now we consider the impact of infrastructure nodes on network capacity .",
    "in addition to @xmath0 ordinary nodes uniformly and i.i.d .",
    "on a unit square @xmath15 , a set of @xmath321 infrastructure nodes are regularly or randomly placed in the same area @xmath15 where @xmath322 .",
    "these infrastructure nodes act as relay nodes only and do not generate their own traffic .",
    "following the same setting as that in @xcite , it is assumed that the infrastructure nodes have the same transmission range @xmath166 and link capacity @xmath1 when they communicate with the ordinary nodes and these infrastructure nodes are inter - connected via a backbone network with much higher capacity .",
    "furthermore a protocol interference model is adopted .",
    "the routing algorithm used in the above network @xcite has been optimized such that these infrastructure nodes do not become the bottleneck , which may be possibly caused by a poorly designed routing algorithm diverting excessive amount of traffic to the infrastructure nodes .",
    "first consider the case when @xmath323 .",
    "in this situation , the number of transmissions involving an infrastructure node as a transmitter or receiver is small and has little impact on @xmath162 , which has been shown in previous subsections to be @xmath324 .",
    "furthermore , it can be shown that the average euclidean distance between a randomly chosen pair of infrastructure nodes is @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "that is , a packet transmitted between two infrastructure nodes moves by an euclidean distance of @xmath8 whereas a packet transmitted by a pair of directly connected ordinary nodes moves by an euclidean distance of @xmath159 .",
    "therefore a transmission between two infrastructure nodes _ is equivalent to _ @xmath325 transmissions between ordinary nodes and the _ equivalent _ average number of simultaneous ordinary node transmissions equals @xmath326 .",
    "it follows using a similar procedure outlined in section [ sub : capacity - of - static - kumar ] that @xmath327 therefore when @xmath328 , the infrastructure nodes have little impact on the order of @xmath301 ; when @xmath329 ( and @xmath330 ) , the infrastructure nodes start to have dominant impact on the network capacity and the above equation on the transport capacity reduces to @xmath331 . noting that the fundamental reason why infrastructure nodes improve capacity is that they help a pair of ordinary nodes separated by a large euclidean distance to leapfrog some very long hops , thereby reducing @xmath161 .",
    "therefore the same result in the above equation can also be obtained by analyzing the reduction in @xmath161 directly .",
    "the analysis is albeit more complicated .    when @xmath332 , assuming that the transmission range stays the same as when @xmath330 at @xmath166 , the number of simultaneous active infrastructure nodes becomes limited by the transmission range .",
    "more specifically , only @xmath333 infrastructure nodes can be active simultaneously .",
    "furthermore , _ a.a.s .",
    "_ each ordinary node can access its nearest infrastructure node in @xmath8 hops .",
    "following a similar analysis as that in the last paragraph , it can be shown that @xmath334 when @xmath332 .",
    "the above results are consistent with the results in @xcite .",
    "however we further note that when @xmath335 a smaller transmission range of @xmath336 is sufficient for an ordinary node to reach its nearest infrastructure node and hence achieving connectivity .",
    "a smaller transmission range helps to increase @xmath162 and it has been shown previously that @xmath163 , while @xmath337 . therefore the achievable transport capacity using the smaller transmission range is @xmath338 , which is better than the result @xmath334 in @xcite . moreover , different from the conclusion in @xcite suggesting that when @xmath332 , further investment in infrastructure nodes will not lead to improvement in capacity , our result suggests that even when @xmath335 capacity still keeps increasing linearly with @xmath321 .",
    "this capacity improvement is achieved by reducing the transmission range with the increase in @xmath321 .",
    "in this paper , we show that the network capacity can be determined by estimating the three parameters , viz . the average number of simultaneous transmissions , the link capacity and the average number of transmissions required to deliver a packet to its destination .",
    "our result is valid for both finite networks and asymptotically infinite networks .",
    "we have demonstrated the usage and the applicability of our result by using the result to analyze the capacity of a number of different networks studied in the literature .",
    "the use of our result often simplifies analysis .",
    "more importantly , we showed that the same methodology can be used to analyze the capacity of networks under different conditions .",
    "therefore our work makes important contributions towards developing a generic methodology for network capacity analysis that is applicable to a variety of different scenarios .",
    "furthermore , as illustrated in section [ sub : capacity - of - hybrid ] , the simple capacity - determing relationship revealed in the paper can be used as a powerful and convenient tool to quickly estimate the capacity of networks based on an intuitive understanding of the networks .",
    "however we readily acknowledge that the analysis of the three parameters : the average number of simultaneous transmissions , the link capacity and the average number of transmissions required to deliver a packet to its destination , may still need some customized analysis that takes into account details of a network different from other networks .",
    "for asymptotically infinite random networks , the use of our result to estimate the capacity often involves estimating the capacity upper bound and the capacity lower bound separately .",
    "the capacity upper bound can be readily obtained by estimating the maximum number of simultaneously active transmissions satisfying the interference constraints that can be accommodated in the network area and the minimum number of transmissions required to deliver a packet .",
    "the capacity lower bound is more difficult to find .",
    "it usually involves constructing a spatial and temporal scheduling algorithm for the particular network and demonstrating that the network capacity is achievable using that algorithm .",
    "it remains to be investigated on whether a generic technique can be found such that the capacity lower bound can be obtained without resorting to designing customized algorithm for a particular network .    in this paper ,",
    "we have ignored physical layer details by assuming that each node is capable of transmitting at a fixed and identical data rate .",
    "this assumption allows us to focus on the topological aspects of networks that determine capacity .",
    "it remains to be investigated on how to develop a generic methodology to incorporate the impact of physical layer techniques , e.g. coding and mimo , on capacity .",
    "we refer readers to recent work by jiang et al .",
