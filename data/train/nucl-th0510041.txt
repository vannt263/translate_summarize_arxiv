    "chiral type models such as the njl model have been successful in explaining the low energy physics of mesons and nucleons in vacuum utilizing the concept of the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking @xcite .",
    "application of the model to low density , however , has posed serious problems like the absence of saturation @xcite .",
    "this is in contrast to non - chiral models like the walecka model @xcite which has been phenomenologically successful in describing the nuclear matter ground state in the mean field approximation .    in chiral models with a mexican hat potential , the nuclear medium moves the minimum of the vacuum effective potential towards smaller values .",
    "this implies a smaller curvature , i.e. the scalar sigma mass decreases .",
    "consequently , the attraction between nucleons due to sigma meson exchange increases .",
    "this effect may destroy the stability of nuclear matter . on the contrary , in non - chiral models",
    "e.g. the walecka type model , where the potential is simpler , a stable nuclear matter can be found .    at the nuclear matter",
    "saturation point the fermi momentum @xmath0 and the pion mass @xmath1 are of comparable scale ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "therefore , chiral dynamics may play an important role in a nuclear matter saturation mechanism .",
    "chiral symmetry is an approximate symmetry for quarks which is not necessarily translated into a symmetry for nucleon degrees of freedom .",
    "furthermore , the delta - nucleon mass splitting @xmath3 mev is also comparable to the fermi momentum @xmath0 at nuclear matter saturation .",
    "it has been shown that the main mechanism behind the delta - nucleon mass splitting stems from the fact that the delta and the nucleon have different internal quark structure @xcite .",
    "therefore one may naturally be led to ask if the internal structure of nucleon is important in order to describe the empirical nuclear matter ground state .",
    "quark degrees of freedom have also been important in order to describe deep - inelastic scattering at momentum transfers of several gev and the emc effect @xcite .",
    "moreover , at the moment a direct calculation of the many nucleons system based on qcd itself is not feasible .",
    "therefore , effective quark theories are the best tools to develop a microscopic understanding of a single nucleon together with nuclear and quark matter and their phase structure in a unified framework .    it has been shown that a non - local covariant extension of the njl model inspired by the instanton liquid model @xcite can lead to quark confinement for acceptable values of the parameters @xcite .",
    "there are other advantages of the non - local version of the model over the local njl model , for example : the constituent quark mass is momentum - dependent , as also found in lattice calculation @xcite .",
    "the regulator makes the theory finite to all orders in the loop expansion and leads to small next - to - leading order corrections @xcite .",

    ", we employ this model to investigate the role of the internal dynamics of nucleon in a nuclear matter environment .",
    "we explicitly construct nucleon degrees of freedom by binding diquarks and quarks with relativistic faddeev equations to describe nuclear matter . the relativistic faddeev approach to describe the nucleon as a composite object has been very successful @xcite .    very recently",
    "bentz and thomas @xcite have shown that local njl models may lead to saturating nuclear matter when the quark confinement effect is incorporated to avoid unphysical thresholds .",
    "although the idea is interesting , there may be some short - coming in their approach .",
    "quark confinement in their prescription is incorporated by introducing an infrared cutoff in the model .",
    "this way quark confinement is permanent and there is no confinement - deconfinement transition in their model . in their hybrid approach",
    ", the nucleon is described as a relativistic bound state in the static approximation of a scalar diquark and quark .",
    "it has been already noticed that the attractive axial - vector diquark plays an important role in description of a single nucleon @xcite .",
    "therefore , in order to treat the internal structure of the nucleon and its modification in the medium adequately , we will take into account both the scalar and the axial - vector diquark channels and solve the faddeev equation without invoking the static approximation .",
    "we start by investigating the role of diquarks in the bound nucleon . the in - medium modification of the nucleon mass and the nucleon size will be calculated .",
    "we obtain the nuclear matter equation of state when nucleon is taken as a composite object made of diquark and quark .",

    "( [ new - ve],[n9 ] )",
    ".    in the rest frame the mass of the nucleon and its total angular momentum are good quantum numbers . in the rest frame",
    "it is also possible to decompose the nucleon vertex function in terms of tri - spinor in different diquark channels each possessing definite orbital angular momentum and spin which allows a direct interpretation of different components @xcite .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "it is observed that at finite density the s - wave in the scalar diquark channel is the dominant contribution to the nucleon ground state . as the nuclear matter density increases the scalar and the axial diquark masses decrease , consequently the diquark interaction couplings @xmath68 and @xmath69 grow .",
    "this effect can be realized from fig .",
    "5 , since the maximum strength of the density function increases as we increase the baryonic density .",
    "it is interesting to notice that from fig .",
    "5 one can observe that the relative importance of the scalar and axial diquarks remains intact in medium ( at least at low density ) . in order to estimate the change of the nucleon size in response to nuclear matter environment",
    ", we compute @xmath149 at finite density .",
    "this leads to @xmath150 for @xmath151 and @xmath152 , respectively .",

    "we adjust the vector mean field coupling @xmath33 in order to have right binding energy per particle @xmath155 mev .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath156 when @xmath157 .",
    "the fact that the equation of state curve can not pass exactly through the empirical saturation point implies that our hybrid approach based on a mean field approximation in the medium is still a very crude approximation in medium and it is not straightforward to fix two values via it .",
    "a similar study by bentz and thomas in the context of the local njl model has shown that the binding energy saturates at too high density @xcite . ] .",
    "it is well known that in the chiral models the stability of the nuclear matter depends very much on the dynamical chiral restoration @xcite .",
    "the necessary condition for saturation of nuclear matter in any relativistic mean field theory is that nucleon attraction mediated from the @xmath158-meson exchange should decrease at high density .",
    "therefore , if @xmath158-meson mass decreases too rapidly with density due to chiral restoration , it may work against the stabilization of the system @xcite .",
    "however , as we have numerically proven , it is in principle possible to obtain a saturating nuclear matter equation of state , if the scalar field couples with the quarks instead of directly with the nucleons ( see also @xcite ) . to this end",

    "in this paper we have investigated the nuclear matter in a non - local njl model .",
    "we have worked out the equation of state of the nuclear matter in a hybrid approximation .",
    "first , we constructed the nucleon as a bound state of a diquark and a quark in the relativistic faddeev approach and then built up nuclear matter by means of these composite nucleons . in this way",
    ", we incorporated the internal quark structure of the nucleon in a very simple framework .",
    "we showed that in this approximation the binding energy saturates .",
    "this is in contrast to the local njl model , where in a similar framework , a stable normal nuclear matter does not exist unless one introduces a new extra parameter into the model either by including an @xmath159-fermi interaction term @xcite to induce the original coupling of the model density dependent or an infrared cutoff to simulate the confinement effect @xcite .",
    "therefore , the long standing problem of matter stability in the njl model can be resolved by introducing non - locality without invoking any adhoc new parameters .",
    "note that the form factor eq .",
    "( [ f - f ] ) does not introduce any new parameter except the cutoff @xmath31 which is also present in the local njl model .",
    "we have also studied the nucleon properties such as the modification of the nucleon mass and size in a nuclear matter medium .",
    "the nucleon mass in the medium decreases very rapidly but saturates near the nuclear matter density @xmath128 .",
    "we obtained the nucleon wave function from the faddeev equation and showed that the nucleon size significantly increases in the medium .",
    "this implies a swollen nucleon in nuclear matter which has many attendant consequences @xcite .",
    "our estimation of in - medium nucleon size should be taken more qualitatively since the quark density function given in eq .",
    "( [ density - f ] ) has not a unique definition .",
    "we found that the swelling of the nucleon is about @xmath153 at about half nucleon matter density .",

    "4 ( left panel ) and the nucleon becomes close to the fictitious diquark - quark threshold , see fig .",
    "4 ( right panel ) . moreover , since the nucleon mass saturates at high density , the nucleon will not expand forever .",
    "other studies have predicted different values . for an example , it has been shown within the friedberg - lee nontopological - soliton bag model that the swelling of the nucleon is about @xmath161 at normal nuclear matter density @xcite . in the skyrmion picture nucleon",
    "swelling about @xmath162 has been reported @xcite .",
    "it has been also shown that in the quark - meson coupling model nucleon swelling about @xmath163 in saturated nuclear matter can explain the observed depletion of the structure function in the medium bjorken @xmath164 region @xcite .",
    "we have also investigated the role of diquarks within the nucleon in the nuclear matter medium .",
    "the scalar and axial diquark masses decrease with a very similar slope in the medium . despite the fact that the nucleon mass decreases ( and its size increases ) significantly",
    ", the role of the scalar and the axial diquark in the nucleon description remains almost the same in the nuclear medium .    in this paper , for simplicity we assumed that the auxially vector field to be local .",
