    "a coherent source emitting two optical frequencies with a difference tunable over a wide range and having a high degree of correlation between their fluctuations could find applications in domains such as ultra - stable atomic clocks @xcite , pump - probe experiments , generation of high - purity optically - carried radio frequency ( rf ) signals useful for microwave photonics @xcite , and metrology @xcite . the dual - frequency laser , sustaining two orthogonal linear polarizations with a tunable frequency difference can perfectly fit the above mentioned applications . such dual - frequency operation has been achieved for different solid - state lasers @xcite , but these lasers suffer from relatively strong intensity noise due to relaxation oscillations inherent to their class - b dynamical behavior @xcite . the dual - frequency vertical - external - cavity surface - emitting laser ( df - vecsel ) exhibits low noise due to its relaxation oscillation free class - a dynamical behavior , as the photon lifetime ( @xmath010 ns ) inside the cm - long external cavity is longer than the carriers lifetime ( @xmath03 ns ) of the semiconductor gain medium .",
    "more importantly , the intensity and phase fluctuations of the two polarizations are expected to be strongly correlated as the two laser modes are oscillating inside the same cavity and pumped by the same laser source .",
    "such df - vecsels have been demonstrated for several different wavelengths such as 1 @xmath1 m @xcite , 852 nm @xcite , and recently we have realized df - vecsel operating at 1.55 @xmath1 m wavelength @xcite .",
    "the noise properties of such df - vecsel are not easy to analyze as the two laser modes are coupled and , in addition to that , phase and intensity fluctuations are linked with each other due to the large henry factor ( @xmath2-factor ) of the semiconductor gain medium @xcite .",

    "the aim of the present paper is to report the spectral behavior of intensity noise correlations and phase noise spectra of the rf beatnote for different values of the nonlinear coupling between the two modes for an optically pumped df - vecsel operating at 1.55 @xmath1 m .",
    "moreover , the spectral behavior of the correlations between the phase noise of the rf beatnote and the intensity noises of the two laser modes are also investigated for different coupling strengths between the laser modes .",
    "to put our understanding about the noise properties of df - vcsel on more solid basis , we investigate the spectral behavior of the pump noise , which is found to be the dominant source of noise within the frequency range of our interest ( 10 khz to 35 mhz ) . additionally , we figure out how the two laser modes , which are spatially separated inside the active medium but pumped by the same pump laser , are intercepting intensity fluctuations of the pump laser differently , depending on their spatial separation .",
    "we prove that this dependence of pump noise properties on the spatial separation between the modes , defining the nonlinear coupling between them , plays an important role in the strength and phase of the correlations between different noises of the two laser modes .",

    "[ fig:5](e),(f ) .",
    "finally , the change of slope in the rin spectra of the two laser modes at about 1 mhz as in figs .  [ fig:5](a),(b ) are also linked with the transition from dominant anti - phase to dominant in - phase mechanism around this cut - off frequency .      in this section ,",
    "we analyze the spectral behavior of the phase noise of the rf beatnote for both weak and moderately strong coupling .",
    "figures [ fig:7](a),(b ) respectively show the rf phase noise and the corresponding beatnote spectra for the weak coupling case .",
    "the beatnote spectrum , recorded with an esa ( resolution bandwidth ( rbw ) = video bandwidth ( vbw ) = 5 khz ) , is centered around 2.208 ghz and is sitting on a few mhz wide pedestal ( see fig . [ fig:7](b ) ) .",

[ fig:7](c),(d ) , respectively . for moderately strong coupling also , the beatnote is sitting on a noise pedestal of few mhz width ( fig .",
    "[ fig:7](d ) ) .",
    "the psd of the phase noise giving rise to the pedestal for the rf beatnote is reported in fig .",
    "[ fig:7](c ) . for both weak and moderately strong coupling ,",
    "the total theoretical rf phase noise is obtained by coherent addition of the two different mechanisms induced by pump noise : ( i ) thermal variation of the refractive index of the active medium [ eq .",

( [ eq:18 ] ) ] , dominating for higher frequencies due to the large @xmath58-factor of the semiconductor active medium ( dash - dotted blue line in figs .",
    "[ fig:7](a),(c ) ) . in figs .",
    "[ fig:7](a),(c ) , the pink filled circles represent the measured phase noise psd , whereas the purple solid line is the total rf phase noise obtained from the theoretical model [ eq .",

    "we obtain a very good agreement between theory and experiment for both weak and moderately strong coupling ( figs .",
    "[ fig:7](a),(c ) ) .",
    "the measurements reproduced in the preceding subsections , dealing with intensity noise spectra and correlation spectra on the one hand , and phase noise spectra on the other hand , have shown very good agreement with the model of sec .",
    "[ sec : theory ] .",
    "however , in order to further test this model and in particular the scenario that we have proposed for the propagation on the pump noise to the rf beatnote phase noise , we have chosen to measure the correlation between the phase noise of the rf beatnote and the intensity noises of the two laser modes generating the rf beatnote for both weak and moderately strong coupling , and to compare them with the theoretically expected spectra .",
    "the experimental and theoretical results for weak coupling are reproduced in fig .",
    "[ fig:8 ] .        the measured correlation amplitude spectra",
    "are reproduced in fig .",
    "[ fig:8](a ) .",
    "the red open squares and blue filled circles represent the amplitude of correlation between the rf phase noise with the intensity noises of x- and y - polarized modes , respectively . the correlation amplitude for the two modes are not perfectly identical as their intensity noises are different ( see figs .",
    "[ fig:4](a),(b ) ) due to the difference between their losses and/or gains .",
    "the correlation amplitude is high ( @xmath128  db ) for low frequencies and it starts to decrease for high frequencies starting from 1 mhz .",
    "the theoretical model satisfactorily reproduces this behavior , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:8](b ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig:8](a ) , the decrease of the correlation amplitude for frequencies higher than 5 mhz is due to the fact that the rf phase noise reaches the measurement floor level for these frequencies ( fig .",
    "[ fig:7](a ) ) .",
    "this explains the discrepancy here with theory ( fig .",
    "[ fig:8](b ) ) .",
    "the experimental correlation phase spectra are represented by fig .",
    "[ fig:8](c ) .",
    "the corresponding theoretical spectra ( fig .",
    "[ fig:8](d ) ) show good agreement with the experiment .",
    "the correlation phase is @xmath129 ( @xmath130 ) for frequencies lower than 100 khz , then it starts to roll off and reaches zero ( @xmath105 ) at about 1 mhz and remains at zero ( @xmath105 ) for all higher frequencies for the y - polarized ( x - polarized ) mode .",
    "the correlation phases for x- and y - polarized mode differ by @xmath105 for all the frequencies , due to the minus sign in eq.([eqfb03 ] ) .",
    "the results in the case of moderately strong coupling are reproduced in fig .",
    "[ fig:9 ] . here",
    "again we observe a good agreement between experiment ( figs .",
    "[ fig:9](a),(c ) ) and theory ( figs .",
    "[ fig:9](b),(d ) ) . in this case also , the difference of correlation amplitudes for the two modes ( red open squares and blue filled circles ) is related to their different intensity noises ( see figs .  [ fig:5](a),(b ) ) due to the nonidentical losses and/or gains . for moderately strong coupling , as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig:9](a),(b ) , the correlation amplitude is higher ( @xmath131  db ) compared to weak coupling for low frequencies .",
    "but again the correlation amplitude starts to decrease for high frequencies starting from 1 mhz , like in case of weak coupling . here also , the decrease of correlation amplitude for frequencies higher than 5 mhz is due to the fact that the phase noise reaches the measurement noise floor for these frequencies ( see fig .  [ fig:7](a ) ) . additionally , the correlation phases associated with the two modes ( see figs .  [ fig:9](c),(d ) ) always differ by @xmath105 , like in the weak coupling situation .",
    "moreover , for frequencies lower than 100 khz , the correlation phase is @xmath129 ( resp .",
    "@xmath130 ) , then the rolling off starts and it becomes zero ( resp .",
    "@xmath132 ) at about 1 mhz and remains at zero ( resp .",
    "@xmath132 ) for all higher frequencies for the @xmath5polarized ( resp .",
    "@xmath3polarized ) mode .    for both weak and moderately strong coupling , the change of correlation phase by @xmath133 from @xmath134 to few hundreds of khz for both @xmath3 and @xmath5polarized modes",
    "is related to the low - pass filter behavior of the thermal phase noise ( fig .",
    "[ fig:7](a ) ) . indeed",
    ", a @xmath133-phase change is associated with this passage through the cut - off frequency , like for any first - order filter .",
    "finally , we observe that the correlation amplitude for frequencies lower than 1 mhz is stronger ( - 2  db ) for moderately strong coupling than for weak coupling ( - 4 db ) , due to the fact that the pump noise correlation factor @xmath43 is stronger for moderately strong coupling than for weak coupling ( see fig.[fig:3](a ) ) .",
    "in this paper , we have reported the spectral behavior of the correlation between the different noises in a two orthogonal polarization dual - frequency vecsel operating at telecom wavelength .",
    "specifically , we have investigated the spectra of correlation between intensity noises of the two linear - orthogonal polarizations , the correlation between the phase noise of the rf beatnote and the intensity noises of the two eigenpolarizations .",
    "the effect of laser dynamics , which is governed by the strength of the nonlinear coupling between the modes , on the spectral behavior of noise correlations has been experimentally and theoretically investigated .",
    "we have found that the spectral behavior of the pump noise as well as the correlation between the pump noises entering the two spatially separated laser modes play a major role in the amplitudes and phases of the correlations between the different noises of our df - vecsel .",
    "a modified rate equation model has exhibited excellent agreement with the experimental results .",
    "moreover , it has allowed to interpret the correlation results in terms of linear response of two coupled over damped oscillators .",
    "this noise correlation study enables us to reach an understanding of the different mechanisms deteriorating the noise performance of a df - vecsel at telecom wavelength and hence in future will help us to improve the noise performance required for different applications .",
    "this understanding would even enable in near future to shape the noise spectra of the laser according to the targeted application .",
