    "the 12.75-minute orbital period detached binary wd system j0651 was discovered by @xcite as part of the extremely low mass ( elm , @xmath9 @xmath5 ) wd survey , a targeted spectroscopic search for elm wds . while that survey has yielded some two dozen merger systems , with orbital periods of tens of minutes to hours @xcite ,",
    "none are as compact as j0651 .",
    "in addition to a large radial - velocity amplitude , this double degenerate system is oriented in such a way that it yields a wealth of photometric information : eclipses of each star by the other , ellipsoidal variations and doppler boosting . while photometric observations engender an accurate way to measure the orbital and system parameters , they also provide multiple clocks with which to monitor the orbital evolution of the system .",
    "the orbital decay of compact binary systems is currently the best method to detect the influence ( and existence ) of gravitational waves , and few known systems are radiating as strongly or decaying as rapidly as j0651 .",
    "there are presently just five binaries known with orbital periods less than 15 minutes , and the other four are interacting : three are the am cvn systems hm cnc , v407 vul , and es cet , and the other is the low - mass x - ray binary 4u 1820 - 30 @xcite . after the 5.4-minute hm cnc @xcite ,",
    "j0651 is the second - loudest gravitational wave source known in the milli - hertz frequency range @xcite .",
    "j0651 is thus the shortest - period detached compact binary known and the cleanest system to observe at optical wavelengths for orbital decay due to gravitational wave radiation .    in this letter",
    "we present follow - up photometric and spectroscopic observations of j0651 , refine orbital and system parameters , and report the detection of rapid orbital decay in the system .",
    "we discuss the orbital period change in the context of expectations from general relativity , as well as deviations expected due to tidal interactions .",
    "section 2 describes our observations , and sections 3 and 4 present the refined system parameters and the orbital period decay , respectively .",
    "our discovery observations of j0651 ( @xmath10 mag ) were described by @xcite and included some 12.7 hr of photometry from the mcdonald observatory ( mcd ) 2.1 m otto struve telescope using the argos frame - transfer camera @xcite . in the subsequent year , we have obtained an additional 195.4 hr of photometry using four different facilities .",
    "the majority of our continuing photometric observations were carried out in an identical manner to the discovery observations , with the argos instrument through a 1 mm _",
    "bg40 _ filter to reduce sky noise .",
    "we obtained @xmath11 s exposures of the target , with a typical exposure time of 10 s , depending on the observing conditions .",
    "additionally , we obtained nearly 3 hr of data in december 2011 using the agile instrument @xcite mounted on the 3.5 m telescope at apache point observatory ( apo ) , using a 1 mm _",
    "filter and @xmath12 s exposures . in january and march 2012",
    ", we obtained 6.8 hr of data with 20 s exposures using gmos @xcite on the 8.1 m gemini north telescope as part of the queue programs gn-2011b - q-95 and gn-2012a - q-29 .",
    "most of the gemini data were taken using a sloan-_g _ filter , but we obtained nearly 2 hr of data using a sloan-_r _ filter to constrain the luminosity of the secondary wd ( see section  [ sec : param ] ) .",
    "additionally , we obtained 1.5 hr of data using 10 s exposures in march 2012 and 1.0 hr of data using 5 s exposures in april 2012 using the osiris instrument @xcite through a sloan-_g _ filter and in fast photometry mode , mounted on the gran telescopio canarias ( gtc ) 10.4 m telescope .",
    "we bias- and flat - field correct the raw science frames using standard iraf routines . for argos and agile , we perform weighted , circular , fixed - aperture photometry on the calibrated frames using the external iraf package @xmath13 @xcite . we divide the sky - subtracted light curves using five brighter comparison stars in the field to remove transparency variations .",
    "to remove any long - term trends caused by differential atmospheric extinction , we fit a low - order polynomial to observing runs exceeding 2 hr using the wqed software suite @xcite , which we also use to apply a timing correction to each observation to account for the motion of the earth around the barycenter of the solar system @xcite .",
    "we use the formalism described in @xcite to derive average point - by - point photometric errors of 1.0 mmag for gmos and osiris , and 2.8 mmag for argos observations .",
    "we calibrate these errors using the @xmath10 mag , photometrically constant star sdss  j065132.86 + 284408.4 , within 20@xmath14 of our target .    for the gmos and osiris data , we use daophot @xcite to perform aperture photometry on our target and",
    "a dozen photometrically constant sdss point sources in our images for calibration .",
    "we use a script by @xcite to apply a barycentric timing correction and check it against the timings based on wqed .      to obtain higher signal - to - noise - ratio spectroscopy and better phase coverage , we obtained additional time - series spectroscopy of j0651 at the 6.5 m mmt telescope in october 2011 and april 2012 .",
    "all 79 spectra were taken using the blue channel spectrograph @xcite with a 800 l mm@xmath2 grating and a 1@xmath14 slit .",
    "this set - up provides 2.1   resolution and a spectral coverage from 35505450  .",
    "the lower resolution compared to the discovery observations presented by @xcite enabled us to decrease the exposure time to 90 s , providing a radial velocity curve with better phase coverage ( see figure  [ fig : j0651newrv ] ) .",
    "the reduced spectra have an average radial velocity error of @xmath1531 km s@xmath2 .",
    "we compute the orbital elements using the code of @xcite , which weights each velocity measurements by its associated error .",
    "however , the observed velocity amplitude is an underestimate because our 90 s exposures span 12% of the orbital phase , and because the radial velocity curve is not linear . by integrating a sine curve at the phase covered by our exposures , we determine that the velocity amplitude correction is 2.3% .",
    "the resultant best - fit , corrected velocity semi - amplitude is @xmath16 km s@xmath2 .",
    "this is significantly lower than our original value , @xmath17 km s@xmath2 , computed in the same way .    given that the original radial velocity semi - amplitude depended on a dozen measurements at quadrature with 30 km s@xmath2 errors , the formal error was an underestimate .",
    "a monte carlo calculation indicates that the true uncertainty in @xmath18 using our original 27 spectra was actually 14 km s@xmath2 . the same calculation with the new data",
    "yields an uncertainty in @xmath18 of 5 km s@xmath2 .",
    "this implies that the companion is less massive than originally predicted by @xcite .",
    "we refine the physical parameters of the primary wd using the summed spectrum , which has s / n=78 per resolution element . fitting our new spectra with the stellar atmosphere models of @xcite , which include improved stark broadening profiles with non - ideal gas effects ,",
    "formally yields @xmath19  @xmath20 k and @xmath21  @xmath22 .",
    "this result is nearly identical to our original measurements ( @xmath19  @xmath23 k and @xmath21  @xmath24 , * ? ? ?",
    "additionally , we investigate the effect of velocity smearing on the derived atmospheric parameters by analyzing the spectra obtained at quadrature ( @xmath25 km s@xmath2 , when velocity smearing should be at its minimum ) . for these spectra at quadrature , we find that @xmath19  is 500 k lower and @xmath21  is 0.07 dex higher .",
    "these differences reflect our systematic error , and also indicate how the parameters of the tidally distorted primary depend on phase , but the parameters remain consistent with the higher s / n summed and phased spectrum .",
    "thus we adopt a mean @xmath19  @xmath26 k and @xmath21  @xmath27 , implying a @xmath28 @xmath5  primary @xcite .",
    "we use our high - quality _ g_-band gemini and gtc photometry to refine the system parameters using the light curve fitting code jktebop @xcite .",
    "we supply the limb - darkening coefficients from wd atmosphere models appropriate for the j0651 system using @xmath29 , where @xmath30 ( p. bergeron 2012 , private communication ) .",
    "these coefficients are included in table  [ tab : param ] ; their uncertainties are negligible given our observed @xmath19  and @xmath21  uncertainties .",
    "additionally , we have adopted gravity - darkening coefficients of @xmath31 for both the primary and secondary , where @xmath32 .",
    "we expect convection to be present in both stars , and our light curve fits do poorly for @xmath33 , as expected for a purely radiative atmosphere , so adopting @xmath34 is reasonable .",
    "we fix the limb- and gravity - darkening coefficients and fit for the inclination and component radii , and our error estimates result from 10,000 monte carlo simulations , as described in @xcite .",
    "gravitational lensing should minimally affect the derived radius of the primary and secondary , by roughly 0.1% and 0.7% , respectively @xcite , and have not been included in the fits .",
    "the primary radius is a volume - average ; the tidal distortions make the star 3.3% oblate .",
    "the photometry allows us to test the elm wd models by providing an independent estimate on the mass of the primary . to do so",
    ", we hold fixed a series of different mass ratios in our light curve fits , and in each case use the resultant secondary radius in combination with the tested mass - radius relation of @xcite in order to back out the mass of the primary . consistently , this method finds @xmath4 @xmath5 , which we adopt .",
    "taking @xmath4 @xmath5  and @xmath35 km s@xmath2 , the secondary mass is thus @xmath6 @xmath5  for the best - fit inclination of @xmath36 deg .",
    "table  [ tab : param ] shows our final light curve results found by fixing @xmath37 .",
    "the resulting radius of the secondary , @xmath38 @xmath39 , implies @xmath6 @xmath5  @xcite , in good agreement .",
    "pairing the volume - averaged primary radius @xmath40 @xmath39  with the observed surface gravity yields @xmath41 @xmath5 , somewhat larger but consistent with our adopted value , as well as with the result using the @xcite models .",
    "finally , we use our gemini _ r_-band data to constrain the luminosity and temperature of the secondary .",
    "fixing the limb- and gravity - darkening coefficients , and adopting the inclination and component radii from the _ g_-band fits , we find the secondary contributes @xmath42% of light in the _ g_-band and @xmath43% of light in the _ r_-band .    adopting @xmath44 mag and @xmath45 mag for the 0.26 @xmath5  primary @xcite , the secondary thus has @xmath46 mag . for a 0.5 @xmath5  wd , cooling models suggest a temperature of @xmath47 k for the secondary , which corresponds to a cooling age of roughly 700 myr @xcite .",

    "any secular change in the period , @xmath87 , will cause a parabolic curvature in an @xmath75  diagram .",
    "currently , the acceleration in the period change , @xmath88 , is negligible , and we will limit our discussion to a second - order polynomial fit .    to construct an @xmath75  diagram , we must first determine @xmath83 and @xmath85 .",
    "a preliminary estimate comes from a simple fourier transform of our whole data set , which we use to create an initial @xmath75  diagram .",
    "we then iteratively adjust @xmath83 and @xmath85 by the zeroth- and first - order terms from our best - fit parabola until the adjustments are smaller than the error in these terms ; these errors result from the covariance matrix .",
    "our recomputed , final @xmath75  diagram uses this new ephemeris and period and is shown in figure  [ fig : j0651omc ] .",
    "we find :    @xmath89 @xmath90    table  [ tab : omc ] presents the mid - eclipse times from each subset of our observations .",
    "each night of observing from gemini and gtc have been given their own subset , as have each month of data from mcdonald .",
    "since @xmath84 and @xmath91 are nonzero , the zeroth- and first - order terms of the parabola indicating the predicted @xmath87 in figure  [ fig : j0651omc ] have been allowed to vary within the current constraints on these terms .",
    "a weighted , second - order , least - squares fit to the mid - eclipse times yields a rate of period change of @xmath1 s s@xmath2 ( or @xmath3 ms yr@xmath2 ) .",
    "this value includes our may 2012 data point , which has just 3.4 hr of data spread over four nights at a minimum airmass of 2.0 .",
    "if we do not include this last point , the inferred rate of period change differs slightly , yielding @xmath92 s s@xmath2 ( or @xmath93 ms yr@xmath2 ) .",
    "a parabola is needed to best represent the data : the best second - order fit has @xmath94 ( 12 d.o.f . ) , whereas the best first - order fit has @xmath95 ( 13 d.o.f . ) .    as a sanity check",
    ", we also construct an @xmath75  diagram using a model - independent approach . here",
    "we perform a simultaneous least - squares fit to each subset of data using a series of sine curves at the orbital period ( @xmath85 ) up to the last harmonic before the nyquist frequency of that subset .",
    "this effectively uses the high - amplitude ellipsoidal variations at half the orbital period as our clock , with a fourier series of the orbital harmonics to reproduce the eclipses . a best - fit parabola to the observed minima of the ellipsoidal variations",
    "is shown in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : j0651omc ] and yields @xmath96 s s@xmath2 . in order to compare this to the mid - eclipse times at the orbital period",
    ", we must multiply this result by a factor of two , which yields @xmath97 s s@xmath2 ( or @xmath98 ms yr@xmath2 ) .",
    "this model - independent @xmath75  method retains larger errors because the harmonics are inevitably truncated by the nyquist frequency in the observations and so are only roughly capable of replicating the deep primary eclipses .",
    "our results from this method are not orthogonal to the model - dependent light curve fitting , as both fit the eclipses and ellipsoidal variations .",
    "therefore , both results can not be averaged , and we emphasize the results from the model - dependent approach .",
    "thus , our best estimate for the rate of orbital period change in j0651 after 13 months is @xmath1 s s@xmath2 ( or @xmath3 ms yr@xmath2 ) , a 3-@xmath99 detection .",
    "this yields a timescale for period change , @xmath100 myr .",
    "based on the refined parameters for the j0651 system ( see section  [ sec : param ] ) and treating each wd as a point mass in a non - relativistic circular orbit , general relativity predicts an orbital period decay in this system of @xmath7 s s@xmath2 ( or @xmath8 ms yr@xmath2 ) @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite demonstrated that the point mass approximation is valid to better than 1% in cases such as j0651 , so our uncertainty in the orbital decay from gravitational wave radiation is dominated by the uncertainty in the component masses .",
    "additional effects that could modulate the mid - eclipse times are unlikely to explain the observed shift : for example , given the estimated distance of 1.0 kpc @xcite , we expect the proper motion to change the period by no more than @xmath101 s s@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "it is evident from the high - amplitude ellipsoidal variations of the primary that strong tidal forces are also present .",
    "these tides will act as a torque to spin - up the wds if the system is synchronized , further robbing the orbit of angular momentum and increasing the rate of orbital period decay .",
    "the degree to which this tidal torquing influences the orbital evolution depends on the effective tidal locking , which is in many ways determined by the physical structure of the elm wd .",
    "this effect could increase the rate of period decay by at least 5% if the system is synchronized @xcite . with just 13 months of monitoring ,",
    "our sensitivity in the observed rate of orbital decay is not yet sufficient to detect a significant deviation from pure gravitational wave losses .",
    "however , future observations should constrain this discrepancy , providing an excellent probe of the interior of elm wds , in addition to the possibilities opened through asteroseismology @xcite .",
    "the short period of j0651 makes it one of the loudest known sources of gravitational wave radiation , and continued monitoring of orbital decay in the system will provide strong constraints on the gravitational wave strain of j0651 .",
    "this is important for future gravitational wave missions , like the evolved laser interferometry space antenna ( _ elisa _ ) .",
    "critical to that success is disentangling the contributions of tidal torques on the orbital decay , an effort worthy of further photometric observations and modeling .",
