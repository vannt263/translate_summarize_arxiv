    "galaxies detected by their thermal dust emission at submillimeter ( submm ) and millimeter ( mm ) wavelengths ( @xmath8 m ) comprise an important population of massive systems in the early universe that are thought to be undergoing an early phase of intense star formation in their evolution @xcite .",
    "dust grains within star - forming regions in these galaxies are heated by incident optical and ultraviolet ( uv ) radiation from young stars and thermally re - radiate this energy at far - infrared ( far - ir ) to mm wavelengths , with the peak of dust emission occurring at @xmath9 m in the rest - frame @xcite .",
    "it is estimated that about half of all star - formation in the universe is heavily obscured by dust and therefore difficult to identify in even the deepest surveys at optical / ultraviolet wavelengths @xcite .",
    "observations at submm / mm wavelengths sample the rayleigh - jeans tail of the thermal dust spectrum , which rises steeply with frequency @xmath10 @xcite . for observations at @xmath11 m , the climb up this steep spectrum with increasing redshift roughly cancels the effect of cosmological dimming with increasing distance ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , making galaxies with a fixed luminosity have roughly the same observed flux density at submm / mm wavelengths for redshifts between @xmath12 .",
    "this allows a distance - independent study of dust - obscured star - formation and galaxy evolution spanning the epoch of peak star formation activity in the universe ( @xmath13 , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "although first predicted by @xcite , the population of high - redshift and heavily dust - obscured galaxies ( submillimeter galaxies , smgs ) was first revealed a decade ago @xcite , and several wide - area surveys at 850@xmath14 m  1.2 mm have been carried out since then ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) at @xmath17 mm , the balloon - borne large aperture submillimeter telescope ( blast , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) at @xmath18 m , and the _ herschel space observatory _",
    "@xcite at @xmath19 m .",
    "mapping a total area of @xmath20deg@xmath16 to date @xcite , these surveys have uncovered a population of rare , and unusually bright , distant galaxies .",
    "their inferred ir luminosities and high redshifts are consistent with a significant fraction of these extremely bright submm / mm galaxies being gravitationally lensed @xcite , but proof requires extensive multi - wavelength follow - up campaigns .",
    "their observed flux densities can be magnified by factors @xmath21 due to lensing by intervening foreground galaxies or clusters , as observed in similarly bright systems ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . by targeting lensed objects",
    ", we can study the typical properties of the star forming galaxies in the early universe that would otherwise be inaccessible in a blank survey due to sensitivity limitations and source confusion .",
    "the ongoing herschel - astrophysical terahertz large area survey ( h - atlas , * ? ? ? * ) in the science demonstration phase ( sdp ) has already covered 14.4  deg@xmath22 out of the @xmath0550  deg@xmath22 planned , resulting in @xmath06600 sources @xcite with fluxes measured at 250 , 350 , and 500  @xmath14 m using the spectral and photometric imaging receiver ( spire , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". given the large areal coverage , h - atlas can detect the brightest ( i.e. rarest ) distant submm galaxies and is the first example where the efficient selection of lensed galaxies at submm wavelengths has been demonstrated @xcite . to understand the nature of these galaxies ,",
    "in particular whether they represent a previously undiscovered population of intrinsically bright sources ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) or are relatively normal starburst galaxies lensed by foreground structures ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , requires both complementary data at other wavelengths and measurements of their redshifts .",
    "however , measuring spectroscopic redshifts for these sources is challenging : their positional accuracy from submm / mm imaging is often poor due to diffraction limitations at these long wavelengths , and they tend to be highly extincted by dust , making spectroscopic measurements from optical ground - based telescopes difficult ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "photometric redshifts obtained using submm bands are very useful for estimating the high redshift nature of such sources , but suffer from errors due to the degeneracy between the dust temperature and the redshift , which limit their precision to @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "when the photometric redshift estimates involve sed template fitting , errors can also arise from our limited knowledge of the intrinsic smg sed from fir to radio , and its evolution with redshift .",
    "combined with multi - wavelength data , training sets of spectroscopic redshifts may prove useful for reducing these errors for application to the large photometric datasets from ongoing and future surveys .",
    "smgs contain large reservoirs of molecular gas ( @xmath24m@xmath2 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , whose cooling is dominated by the rotational lines of co , almost equally spaced by @xmath0115  ghz in the rest frame .",
    "thus , the co line detections at wavelengths beween 1  cm and 1  mm ( 30 - 300 ghz ) offer the most direct measurement of their redshifts .",
    "however , with the exception of only three other co redshifts measured to date @xcite , co detections have largely been limited to smgs whose redshifts were already known from optical spectroscopy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as a consequence of the small instantaneous bandwidth of typical mm - wavelength receivers .",
    "z - spec overcomes this limitation due to its large bandwidth , covering the entire 1 - 1.5 mm atmospheric window , allowing simultaneous observations of multiple co lines for galaxies at redshifts @xmath25 . although the potential of using the co ladder for redshift determination is well known ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , due to sensitivity limitations of current instruments , only large area submm surveys can provide a significant number of sources bright enough for such measurements .",
    "these spectra can be used not only for an efficient redshift determination , but also to constrain the physical properties of the gas and dust ( e.g. , mass , density , temperature ) in these galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , by measuring the co line strengths and the continuum slope .",
    "the analysis of the co properties requires measurements of multiple co lines , often involving the use of multiple instruments . to date , several spectral line energy distributions ( sleds ) for the co molecule have been constructed for small mixed samples of galaxies and quasars @xcite , or individual objects . relatively well sampled co sleds have been constructed from the ground for bright quasars @xcite , while complete co sleds have been measured by the @xmath26 @xmath27 @xmath28 in low redshift galaxies @xcite .",
    "most smgs have been observed in only one or two co lines ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and their physical properties remain largely unknown .",
    "this situation has improved in recent years , with observations of multiple co lines in individual smgs @xcite .",
    "the best sampled co sleds show that multiple co components are required to explain the full line luminosity distribution , where most of the mid-@xmath7 co emission can generally be fit by a warm component , with kinetic temperatures of 40 - 60  k and gas volume densities of 10@xmath29 - 10@xmath30  @xmath31 .",
    "however , solutions with kinetic temperatures of a few@xmath32100  k and lower densities are also allowed by the data @xcite , and this region of the parameter space has been insufficiently explored .",
    "z - spec has an important advantage over other instruments , since it covers a large portion of the co sled in a single observation ( depending on the redshift ) and with a common calibration for the entire bandpass .",
    "this paper describes observations of five h - atlas sources undertaken with z - spec .",
    "based on the co emission detected by z - spec , we successfully determined the redshifts of four out of five lensed galaxies .",
    "the z - spec observations are described in section  [ sobs ] , followed by the description of the algorithm for redshift determination in section  [ sredshift ] .",
    "we use the measured redshift to constrain the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of these galaxies , estimating the dust temperature and emissivity index , as well as the total infrared luminosity .",
    "we perform an analysis of the partial co sleds , constructed from the lines observed by z - spec , to constrain the physical conditions of the molecular gas .",
    "the analysis of the galaxy seds and co emission lines is presented in section  [ sgalaxy ] , and a summary of our results can be found in section  [ sconcl ] . throughout the paper",
    "we assume a standard @xmath33cdm cosmology , with h@xmath34=71  km  s@xmath4 mpc@xmath4 , @xmath35=0.27 , @xmath36=0.73 @xcite .",
    "we selected five high - z candidates among submm - bright galaxies with f(500@xmath14m)@xmath37100  mjy ( table  [ tab : obs ] ) from the h - atlas survey for follow - up observations with z - spec on the 10-m caltech submillimeter observatory ( cso ) .",
    "z - spec is a single spatial pixel grating spectrometer with 160 silicon - nitride micro - mesh bolometer detectors ( i.e. channels ) operating from @xmath38ghz @xcite .",
    "the frequency response of the z - spec channels is approximately gaussian , with a variable fwhm from 720 to 1290  km  s@xmath4 over the bandpass , that is roughly equal to the channel separation @xcite .",
    "this follow - up was undertaken to confirm that these sources are lensed by lower redshift galaxy clusters or individual galaxies by measuring their redshifts directly at submm wavelengths .",
    "the redshifts of the foreground objects have been measured in the optical , and found to be much lower than the redshifts of the submm galaxies , consistent with the lensing scenario @xcite . for convenience , throughout the paper we identify our targets by their names used in the sdp h - atlas catalogue ( sdp.9 , sdp.11 , sdp.17 , sdp.81 , and sdp.130 ) .",
    "we carried out the z - spec observations of h - atlas sources at the cso from 2010 march 07 - may 14 under generally good to excellent observing conditions , accumulating from 6.8 to 22.5 hour integrations on each target .",
    "the zenith opacity at 225ghz ( monitored by the cso tau meter ) was @xmath39 on average , and @xmath40 for 75% of the observations .",
    "a summary of the observations , including the total integration time on each source is given in table  [ tab : obs ] .",
    "the z - spec data were taken using the standard `` chop - and - nod '' mode in order to estimate and subtract the atmospheric signal from the raw data .",
    "the secondary mirror was chopped on- and off - source at a rate of 1.6hz with a chop throw of 90arc - sec while stepping through a 4-part nod cycle which position switches the primary mirror , integrating for 20sec at each nod position .",
    "the chopping removes atmosphere fluctuations and the nodding removes instrumental offsets due to imperfect match between the two chopped positions .",
    "we checked the pointing every @xmath41 hrs by observing quasars and other bright targets located close in elevation to the h - atlas targets , making small ( typically @xmath42  10arc - sec ) adjustments to the telescope pointing model in real - time .",
    "we analyze the data using customized software in the same manner as described in @xcite . for each channel ,",
    "the nods are calibrated and averaged together , weighting by the inverse variance of the detector noise .",
    "absolute calibration is determined by observations of mars once per night , which we use to build a model of the flux conversion factor ( from instrument volts to jy ) as a function of each detector s mean operating ( `` dc '' ) voltage @xcite .",
    "since the dc voltage depends on the combination of the bath temperature and the total optical loading on the detectors , we use these curves to determine appropriate calibration factors to apply to each nod individually . based on the root mean square ( rms ) deviations of the mars measurements from the best - fit curves ,",
    "the channel calibration uncertainties are @xmath43% , excluding the lowest frequencies for which a clean subtraction of the atmosphere is hindered by the pressure - broadened 183ghz atmospheric water line .",
    "these uncertainties are propagated through the data reduction .",
    "the median rms uncertainties on the final co - added spectra for the h - atlas galaxies are listed in table  [ tab : obs ] .",
    "these errors do not include the @xmath44% uncertainty on the brightness temperature of mars @xcite .",
    "the calibrated z - spec spectra of the five atlas galaxies are shown in figures  [ spectra ] and [ spectra17 ] .",
    "the redshifts of these sources are determined using a custom algorithm , tailored specifically for multiple lines observed simultaneously in the same bandpass .",
    "this algorithm is presented in the next section .",
    "the redshift determination relies on the simultaneous detection of multiple co and atomic lines . using the multiple co lines falling in the z - spec bandpass",
    ", we developed a redshift - finding algorithm that is capable of handling cases where the signal - to - noise in individual lines is low .",
    "the number of co lines redshifted in the z - spec bandpass grows from 2 at @xmath45 ( co(3 - 2 ) and co(4 - 3 ) ) to 4 or more at @xmath46 ( starting at co(5 - 4 ) through co(8 - 7 ) ) .",
    "the measurement of redshifts greater than @xmath47 requires the presence of high - excitation , warm co gas , where transitions between higher rotational levels become important .",
    "as the width of the z - spec channels varies from 720 to 1290  km  s@xmath4 over the bandpass , larger than most observed line widths , most of the signal from one line will be concentrated in a single channel .",
    "the redshift finding algorithm uses two test statistics , @xmath48 and @xmath49 ( eqs . [ e1eq ] and [ e2eq ] ) , constructed from combinations of the detection significance in those channels in which a reference line would be observed by z - spec at a given redshift @xmath50 .",
    "the reference line list contains all co rotational lines up to the co(17 - 16 ) transition , the [ ] 492.16  ghz line , the [ ] 1458.8  ghz line , and the [ ] 1900.569  ghz line . for redshifts @xmath51 the [ ] 809.342  ghz and co(7 - 6 ) 806.651  ghz lines can fall in the same z - spec channel , and are therefore degenerate for the purpose of this procedure",
    "the values of the test statistics are related to the probability that the lines from the reference list , redshifted by a factor of @xmath52 , are present in the spectrum .",
    "the null hypothesis is that there is no signal detected in the spectrum for any value of the redshift , and the distribution of the test statistics for the null hypothesis can be obtained using blank sky spectra , flat continuum sources , or noise simulations .",
    "both statistics are maximized when the redshifted frequencies of the reference lines match the frequencies where the largest signal is present in the spectra , after continuum subtraction .",
    "the continuum subtraction uses a fourth degree polynomial to better account for local deviations from a power - law . the use of two statistics instead of one helps reduce the number of false redshifts that can be due to random noise fluctuation in the spectra .",
    "we search a redshift range between 0.6 and 5.6 in steps of 0.001 .",
    "let @xmath53 be the number of reference lines that would fall in the z - spec bandpass at redshift @xmath50 .",
    "the algorithm loops through all the @xmath50 values , redshifting all the lines in the line list , and finding the set of @xmath53 z - spec channels corresponding to the lines in the bandpass at that redshift .",
    "the two test statistics , @xmath48 and @xmath49 , are evaluated for each redshift using the signal and noise in the set of @xmath53 channels determined in the previous step .",
    "the first test statistic , @xmath54 , is defined as the ratio of the signal to the noise summed only over the z - spec channels that correspond to a line in our list when redshifted to redshift @xmath50 ,    @xmath55    where the sum is taken from 1 to @xmath53 , and @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the continuum subtracted signal and noise , respectively , for the channel corresponding to line @xmath58 .",
    "the second test statistic , @xmath59 , is defined as    @xmath60    where the set contains all possible pairs of lines in the z - spec bandpass at the corresponding redshift .",
    "the @xmath49 statistic can be easily understood as a rejection criterion . setting @xmath61 as a lower limit is equivalent to discarding all redshifts for which the median value of the average s / n in any pair of channels is less than @xmath62 .",
    "note that @xmath48 would be a reasonable statistic for single line detections , but @xmath49 relies on multiple lines being present in the z - spec bandpass at a given redshift . for redshifts",
    "@xmath63 , @xmath48 is still a useful statistic , though the presence of only one line does not make for an unambiguous redshift determination .",
    "no a priori knowledge of the relative line strengths is assumed , and therefore the algorithm gives equal weight to all the lines in the search list .",
    "as such , the significance of the determined redshift is dependent on which lines are detected in the spectrum relative to the lines that were expected based on the reference list .",
    "this is the case for sdp.17b ( see section  [ iz ] ) , where the redshift significance increases greatly if we include the water line on our line list .",
    "however , such an extension of the reference line list is not always justified , since the significance for the redshift of another galaxy where the water line is not detected would be unnecessarily diminished .",
    "care must also be taken in using the current line list at higher redshifts , where the high @xmath7 co lines are likely to have much lower significance relative to the [ ] and [ ] lines .",
    "for example , the strength of the co lines drops with increasing @xmath7 for starburst galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , but remains relatively constant for agn - dominated galaxies and quasars ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "current knowledge of line strengths and the nature of the sources at high redshift does not warrant including this information in the redshift search .",
    "the distributions of @xmath48 and @xmath49 , as well as the effect of noise on the positions of their maxima , have been confirmed by simulating multiple realizations of _ blank sky _ spectra .",
    "the simulations take an input spectrum and generate new realizations by choosing random values of the signal in each channel , normally distributed around the value of the input signal in that channel , with a standard deviation equal to the measurement error in the same channel . the error array associated with the new realization",
    "is scaled accordingly , such that the signal - to - noise in each channel is equal to that of the input spectrum . as the input spectrum we used a 6.5 hour integration on blank sky , recorded on may 11 and 12 , 2010 .",
    "other featureless spectra can also be used for this test . for each realization",
    ", we calculate the values of both test statistics and determine the redshifts corresponding to their maxima .",
    "the distribution of these redshifts is shown in figure  [ simskyzearch ] , derived from a simulation containing 1000 realizations of the sky spectrum .",
    "ideally , this distribution should be uniform , but the input sky spectrum is not perfectly smooth , possibly due to small instrumental artefacts , which are reflected by the probability variations . the noise cross - correlation between channels are present in the initial sky spectrum , but not in the simulated spectra .",
    "we find that although the @xmath64 of @xmath48 and @xmath49 for each redshift are mostly correlated , the _ locations of their maxima _ are not ( pearson correlation coefficient 0.15 ) .",
    "figure  [ simskyzearch ] conveys this fact by comparing the maximum joint probability that @xmath48 and @xmath49 select the same redshift , relative to the maximum probability of a redshift found by @xmath48 independently ( @xmath03% vs. @xmath017% ) .",
    "this shows that the combination of two test statistics is more robust against random fluctuations , considerably reducing the noise floor across the redshift range .",
    "a realization of the two test statistics using a blank sky spectrum is shown in figure  [ skyzearch ] . in this case , the maxima of the two statistics occur for different redshifts , and no value of @xmath49 is above the threshold of 2 . for noise - dominated spectra , such as blank sky ,",
    "@xmath54 is well fit by a normal distribution with @xmath65=0.97 , and @xmath59 by a t distribution with 10 degrees of freedom ( figure  [ estdist ] ) . for our redshift determination",
    ", we first ask that the maximum value of @xmath48 have a significance @xmath66 .",
    "equivalently , the null is rejected at 99.73% confidence level . however , as noise fluctuations can still lead to random , albeit significant , peaks in these statistics even for blank sky spectra , the redshift confirmation also requires that the maxima of the two test statistics occur at the same redshift . to summarize ,",
    "a redshift @xmath67 is accepted when the following conditions hold :    @xmath68    for a line pair , the @xmath48 3@xmath69 threshold corresponds to an average s / n per channel of 2.12 .",
    "z - spec reaches a sensitivity of about 0.5  jy  s@xmath70 per channel for an atmospheric optical depth @xmath71=0.068 @xcite . combining the 3@xmath69 threshold criterion with the measured sensitivity of z - spec",
    ", we estimate that a redshift can be determined in less than 1.5 hours of integration time if the line flux densities per channel are on the order of 15  mjy , but can require more than 12.5 hours if the flux density is less than 5  mjy . for our galaxy sample , the mean integrated co line flux ( table  [ tab : lco ] ) is @xmath018  jy  km  s@xmath4 , while the average width of the channels is 950  km  s@xmath4",
    ". however , the flux density per channel could be only @xmath010  mjy if the line flux happens to be split between two adjacent channels . in this case",
    ", the typical integration time for obtaining a redshift with z - spec would be at least 3.5 hours .",
    "the results of applying this algorithm to our galaxy sample are shown in figure  [ a981zearch ] .",
    "the redshift value and its uncertainty ( table  [ tab : cont ] ) are determined from the position and width of the peak of the @xmath48 test statistic , and the significance of the redshift peak is tested against the null hypothesis ( figure  [ e1hist ] ) .",
    "we fit a gaussian to the peak of the @xmath54 statistic , and define the redshift error as the upper limit for the standard deviation of this gaussian .",
    "when lines are present in the spectrum , aside from the main peak due to the true redshift , secondary peaks will arise in the @xmath48 and @xmath49 distributions , corresponding to redshifts where some of the lines in the line list fall on the same channels as the observed lines .",
    "the secondary peaks are marked by blue asterisks for each source in figure  [ a981zearch ] .",
    "the real redshift will have higher significance than these secondary peaks , since the largest number of lines add their contribution to the total signal in this case . excluding the true redshift and all the redshifts corresponding to secondary peaks from the test statistics , we are left with the null distribution , as shown in figure  [ e1hist ] .",
    "this figure also shows the significance of the redshift determination for each source , by marking the position of the peak value of the test statistic relative to the 3@xmath69 threshold .    _",

    "a recent comparison of the co(3 - 2 ) and ( 1 - 0 ) lines @xcite shows that the ratio of the brightness temperatures for these two lines averages to 0.6 rather than 1 , due to the presence of multi - phase co gas . moreover , the mid-@xmath7 co transitions do not account for the possible presence of a colder gas component , making the @xmath114 derived in this manner a lower limit for the total gas mass in the galaxy .",

    "the ratios @xmath91/@xmath112 for each model listed in table  [ tab : radex ] suggest that the star formation efficiency is higher for the lte models . using the correlation between total @xmath156 and @xmath91 derived for a mixed sample of nearby and high redshift galaxies by @xcite , we find that the total @xmath156 obtained by integrating the models will overpredict the measured @xmath91 in both cases , but are consistent within the scatter . the deviation between the predicted and measured @xmath91 is larger for model m02 , slightly disfavoring this solution .",
    "while the lte models tend to underpredict the total gas masses , the non - lte models potentially underpredict the total infrared luminosity .",
    "the region of the parameter space that is most consistent with the observed line strengths is enclosed by the likelihood contours in figures  [ tnmcmc ] and [ nnmcmc ] .",
    "we see that the lte solution implies large gas densities ( @xmath140[h@xmath139 ] ) , as expected , but a class of non - lte solutions can be found in the region defined by the likelihood contours in parameter space .",
    "the likelihood space roughly splits into high density / low temperature , and low density / high temperature solutions .",
    "one possible additional complication to the interpretation can arise from high dust optical depths ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , not included in our models , that can lead to the suppression of mid-@xmath7 co lines and to an underestimate of the excitation temperature . however , the likelihood distribution is relatively shallow over the whole region , reflecting the insufficient amount of information in our data .",
    "comparatively , other studies of high redshift smgs find a warm co component with @xmath140[h@xmath139 ] around 10@xmath30  @xmath31 and temperatures between @xmath040 and 60  k @xcite , a region marginally allowed by our contours .",
    "the constraints on the parameter space for the non - lte models are weak , as expected given the average sampling of the sled , and can not distinguish at this point between the lte and non - lte scenarios . to emphasize the insight gained by including additional lines in the fit",
    ", we add to the sled of sdp.81 the co(1 - 0 ) integrated flux from @xcite . a likelihood analysis for the new set of lines results in the best fit parameters listed in table  [ tab : radex ] as m03 .",
    "the 2d marginalized likelihoods for this case are shown by the light grey contours in figures  [ tnmcmc ] and [ nnmcmc ] .",
    "the tightening of the likelihood contours is substantial with just one line added to the data , and the lte region of the parameter space becomes less favored .",
    "however , the limitation of this model is that it assumes a single gas component , while most of the emission in the co(1 - 0 ) line could be originating from cold molecular gas .",
    "the brightness temperatures predicted by the radex models m01 and m02 are shown in figure  [ tempsone ] , to emphasize the large deviations beween the predictions of the two models , especially for lower @xmath7 transitions .",
    "the measured data points have been scaled by the lensing magnification factors listed in table  [ tab : cont ] when available , and by a factor of 10 in all other cases .",
    "this figure shows that the constraints on the model parameters can be tightened by measurements of lower @xmath7 transitions , especially the co(1 - 0 ) line . even if most of the co(1 - 0 ) emission comes from a colder gas component , using this value as an upper limit will help rule out some regions of the parameter space , as in our example for sdp.81 .",
    "distinguishing between the different regions in parameter space will clarify the state of the ism in these galaxies , and thus their star formation histories .",
    "specifically , hot / low - density gas may signal the action of a feedback process quenching further star formation , by increasing the jeans mass . this high temperature / low density solution has not been fully investigated , but recent studies show that other co sleds can be consistent with it @xcite .",
    "the co sled in m82 is fit by a small co component with a kinetic temperature of almost 600  k @xcite , while solutions with @xmath119 of a few@xmath32100  k are found by @xcite , and can be allowed by the lvg models for iras f10212 + 4724 @xcite and apm 08279 + 5255 @xcite .",
    "such temperatures suggest energy input from outflows or agn activity .",
    "the presence of an agn component in sdp.17b is supported by the relatively flat sled from co(6 - 5 ) to co(8 - 7 ) , similar to the cloverleaf quasar or mrk231 @xcite , and the emission line of water , also observed in galaxies with an agn component , such as mrk231 @xcite .",
    "far - ir / submillimeter - wave surveys are revealing submillimeter - bright galaxies from the first half of the universe by the tens of thousands , but their detailed study requires spectroscopic redshift measurements .",
    "we have studied a sample of the brightest sources and have demonstrated a new redshift - measurement technique with our broadband millimeter - wave grating spectrometer , z - spec .",
    "z - spec measures multiple rotational transitions of carbon monoxide , the dominant coolant of molecular gas in galaxies , and thus is not dependent on optical counterparts which are often absent or hard to identify , as is the case for these galaxies .",
    "we find redshifts ranging roughly between 1 and 3 , in line with previous determinations @xcite , reaching back to an era when the universe was 15% is present age .",
    "their fluxes are proven to be amplified by gravitational lensing @xcite , making them ideal targets for spectroscopic follow - ups . from the observed co line luminosities and integrated @xmath91 , typical conversion factors reveal that these galaxies each house roughly 10@xmath157 m@xmath2 of molecular gas , and have sfrs between 10@xmath22 and 10@xmath29  m@xmath2yr@xmath4 , after correcting for lensing magnification . regardless of the magnification details , we are clearly witnessing a rare episode of rapid star formation in these galaxies , since the timescale over which the observed luminosity can be generated by converting the inferred mass of gas into stars is only a few tens of millions of years ( depending on the details of the star formation and the accretion of more gas ) , which is a small fraction of the universe s age even at this early epoch .",
    "we estimate that the dust masses in our sample of lensed galaxies are around a few@xmath3210@xmath1  m@xmath2 , and the wavelengths corresponding to the peaks of their dust seds fall within a narrow range , between 73 and 92  @xmath14 m in the rest frame . for this initial set of lensed submm galaxies both the dust properties derived from the ir",
    "sed , and the physical conditions of the molecular gas probed by the co lines , are broadly comparable to those in known smgs @xcite , with excitation temperatures in the 30 - 120  k range , and @xmath112/@xmath91 between 1 and 3@xmath3210@xmath158 k  km  s@xmath4  pc@xmath22/l@xmath2 , as measured from the mid-@xmath7 co lines .",
    "the partial sleds for the co molecule constructed from the lines observed by z - spec can not distinguish between different models of co excitation .",
    "the simplest assumption is that of local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) , under which we can derive the gas column density and excitation temperature .",
    "we find that the relative line strengths can be reproduced by relatively low excitation temperatures ( @xmath42  100  k ) , and optical depths ( @xmath42  1 ) . in the non - lte case ,",
    "other parts of the parameter space are allowed , including higher optical depths , while measurements of the lower rotational transitions are essential in confirming such models .    by being able to characterize galaxies that can be inaccessible at other wavelengths ,",
    "the combination of large - area submm surveys and spectroscopic follow - ups of the co emission lines will lead to substantial progress in our understanding of high redshift galaxies and their evolution .",
    "these results suggest the possibility of a rapid growth in our understanding of smgs , independent of their optical or radio counterparts , but enabled by strong gravitational lensing magnification .",
