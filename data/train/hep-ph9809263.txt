    "confinement implies that the nature of the quark dynamics has to change strongly in dependence on the scale of energy or distance associated with the interaction .",
    "let us consider the interaction between a quark and an antiquark . at short quark - antiquark distance @xmath0 ,",
    "the interaction is dominated by the one gluon exchange ( dipole configuration ) and is obtained by a perturbative expansion in @xmath1 . with increasing distance , the interaction becomes linear in @xmath0 ( flux tube configuration ) .",
    "the formation of a flux tube of constant energy density @xmath2 ( the so called string tension ) confining the quark and the antiquark to remain bound , is the most striking feature of confinement and is inherently nonperturbative .",
    "we have hints about this flux tube from the phenomenological spectrum and the regge trajectories .",
    "phenomenological potential models include interactions rising with the quark - antiquark distance .",
    "dual models explain this feature as a chromoelectric flux tube formation due to a dual meissner effect , the qcd vacuum behaving like a thooft - mandelstam superconductor .",
    "confinement is then due to monopoles condensation .",
    "lattice studies of the electric and magnetic fields strength distributions around a static quark - antiquark pair yield direct evidence and a detailed picture of the string formation ( see fig.[figuno ] ) .",
    "lattice data provide us with : a quark - antiquark static potential linear for @xmath3 ; an interquark flux tube structure with a transversal rms width ranging between @xmath4 and @xmath5 ; positive tests of monopole condensations ; abelian projected electric fields and currents distributions in agreement with the dual ginzburg landau predictions@xcite .",
    "the lattice remains the most suitable tool to obtain nonperturbative information .",
    "however , most of these appear as independent and uncorrelated measurements . on the other side",
    "we have many phenomenological models implementing confinement . finally , high order perturbative calculations are also available . in order to gain some insight in the mechanism of confinement and flux tube formation",
    "we need a model - independent , exact ( in the sense that it contains perturbative and nonperturbative physics and is valid at any scale ) , gauge - invariant and _ systematic _ approach to the quark interaction .",
    "it helps to have a formulation which is closely related to the lattice , allows analytic calculations and is physically transparent .    in secs . 2 and 3",
    "we show that this program is realizable in the heavy quark case since a small expansion parameter ( the quark velocity @xmath6 ) still exists .",
    "the result obtained is model independent and suitable for lattice evaluation .",
    "an analytic evaluation is possible once a qcd vacuum model is considered .",
    "therefore it is possible to test models of confinement in an unambiguous and direct relation with the phenomenological and lattice data .",
    "we know that in the low energy region new degrees of freedom become relevant",
    ". the flux tube formation hints to the fact that dynamical gluon effects are vital when attempting to incorporate nonperturbative interaction , indeed the gluonic degrees of freedom are condensed into stringlike flux tube .",
    "hence , the flux tube should determine the nonperturbative bound state quark dynamics .",
    "on one side , this means that also excited states of the interquark string has to be considered .",
    "this leads to the consideration of hybrids states and was discussed by michael@xcite at this conference . on the other side",
    ", this means that even when considering the ground state of the interquark glue , the flux tube energy should be taken into account properly .",
    "moreover , to understand the transition region , we should be able to control precisely how the collective behavior of gluons modifies and alters single gluon exchange .    in secs . 4 , 5 and 6 we discuss the heavy quark dynamics in qcd vacuum models that reproduce the flux tube structure , in comparison with the lattice data and with the `` @xmath7 '' models extensively used in the literature",
    "we find that all the flux tube models predict the same form for the heavy quark interaction also in the intermediate region .",
    "we show that the gaussian dominance of the wilson loop average has to be related with the abelian dominance of infrared qcd establishing a connection with the dual superconductor mechanism .    in secs .",
    "7 and 8 we extend our discussion to bound systems involving at least one light quark . here",
    "the spontaneous chiral symmetry symmetry breaking emerges in an interplay with confinement .",
    "we consider a gauge invariant quark - antiquark singlet state .",
    "this is equivalent to say that the contribution of the string is negligible in the limit @xmath8 , which will become more apparent when dealing with the wilson loop . ]",

    "in the heavy quark systems , the existence of an expansion parameter ( the inverse of the mass @xmath30 in the lagrangian and the velocity @xmath6 of the quark as a dynamical defined power counting parameter ) makes possible to establish a systematic expansion procedure .",

    "again , the scalar interaction is effectively generated .",
    "however , the wilson loop approach appears to be simpler and more powerful ( at least for heavy quarks ) ; the intermediates states that are explicitly considered in the fock hamiltonian approach here are summed up into the functional formalism . expressing the potential in terms of the wilson loop we keep the relevant degrees of freedom .",
    "our special trial function constructed with the string interquark operator has selected out the flux tube configuration .",
    "the mal model is in many respects too rough ( e.g. the @xmath88 v.e.v . turns out to be zero and the flux tube turns out to be infinitely thin ) and it may play some role only in the limit of very large interquark distances where an effective relativistic string model description is expected to hold . in the next sections we discuss more sophisticated assumptions .",

    "we want to exploit all the available lattice information on the mechanism of confinement and the measurements of wilson loop and field strength v.e .",
    "v .. about the mechanism of confinement , at this conference , evidence @xcite was presented that the qcd infrared dynamics is well approximated by a ( dual ) abelian higgs model .",
    "indeed , in the abelian projection the qcd gluodynamics is reduced to abelian fields , abelian monopoles and charged matter fields degrees of freedom .",
    "lattice simulations show abelian dominance and monopole dominance in the long range features of qcd and condensation of monopoles in the confined phase . for details we refer to @xcite .",

    "however these are lattice measurements and it is not clear e.g. the relation of @xmath94 and @xmath95 with the parameters of qcd .    on the other side , let us consider the v.e.v . of the wilson loop .",
    "it pays to expand this average in terms of fields strength expectation values , by using the non - abelian stokes theorem@xcite @xmath96 where @xmath97 , @xmath98 denotes a surface with contour @xmath67 and @xmath99 stands for the cumulant average@xcite . in principle , the v.e.v . of the wilson loop",

    "is identified with the dual gluon mass @xmath110 , without the london limit the relation is more involved but still @xmath108 is expressed in terms of the dual theory parameters .",
    "the conclusion is that we need two parameters @xmath108 and @xmath109 to describe the heavy quark dynamics and indeed they are necessary to control the structure of the flux tube .",
    "had we only one parameter , like the string tension @xmath76 , we could encode the information of a constant energy density in the flux tube .",
    "however , the whole structure is important , and also the information about the width of the flux tube has to be considered . in the limit of very large interquark distances and in particular dynamical regimes , we can store the relevant information in one parameter , the string tension .      as shown above ,",

    "the wilson loop is a good approach to the quark dynamics : it keeps automatically the relevant degrees of freedom and includes naturally the flux tube configurations .",
