    "* ) but both suffer from shortcomings and problems .",
    "our lack of understanding is unsatisfactory , especially in the prospect of using slsne as potential distance indicators @xcite and probes of the high-@xmath7 universe @xcite . as it has now been possible to collect and study large samples of h - poor slsne ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it is becoming clear that traditional photometry and spectroscopy alone will not be able to provide a definite answer as to what their powering mechanism is .",
    "alternative and complementary methods ought to be explored .",
    "polarimetry is a powerful diagnostic tool to study spatially unresolved sources such as sn explosions .",
    "a comprehensive review is given by , who argue that core - collapse sne are intrinsically aspherical explosions .",
    "this asphericity is especially prominent in the case of h - poor sne",
    "ib / c ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) , where the core of the exploding star can be directly observed .",
    "sne  iip that are surrounded by a massive h envelope show a sudden increase in the degree of polarisation after the end of the plateau phase @xcite .",
    "this can be explained by the photosphere receding within the ejecta and by the outer layers being approximately spherically symmetric .",
    "however , once the outer layers become optically thin , we are able to observe the core that has exploded asymmetrically .",
    "spherical symmetry is not expected to yield a polarisation signal , as the polarisation of photons scattered in orthogonal directions cancels out . on the other hand ,",
    "different geometries that possess a dominant axis , such as ellipsoidal or torus geometries , are expected to lead to different degrees of polarisation , and polarisation evolution , depending on the exact shape of the expanding photosphere and the observer viewing angle .    in this letter",

    "lsq14mo was discovered by the la silla quest survey ( lsq ; * ? ? ?",

    "the galactic extinction toward this direction is @xmath15  mag @xcite .",
    "the official discovery date was on 2014 january 30 ut , but the first detection of the sn in lsq frames dates back to january 12.2 ut .",
    "lsq14mo was classified during the course of the public eso spectroscopic survey of transient objects by @xcite as a slsn i , on january 31 , 04:52 ut .",
    "immediately after , we triggered our dedicated program on the very large telescope ( vlt ) in order to monitor the polarisation of a slsn .",
    "observations started on february 2.2 ut .",
    "section  [ sec : obs ] presents our observations and data analysis , focusing on the polarimetry .",
    "our results are discussed in section  [ sec : disc ] and in section  [ sec : conc ] we summarise our conclusions .",
    "in addition to the pessto classification spectrum , we secured a spectrum of lsq14mo with the magellan telescope equipped with imacs on march 24 , 05:40 ut . this spectrum covers the nominal wavelength range from 3900 to 10000 and consists of five individual exposures of 1200 s obtained through a @xmath16-wide slit .",
    "the classification spectrum of lsq14mo was reduced using the pessto pipeline .",

    "aditionally , after correcting the spectrum for galactic extinction , based on the balmer decrement , we estimate that the reddening in the host galaxy explosion site is low , @xmath18  mag .",
    "the @xmath19 light curves of lsq14mo were collected by the _",
    "carnegie supernova project - ii _ .",
    "the data were processed and the photometry was computed following @xcite .",
    "the optical and nir photometry can be found in tables  [ tab : photopt ] and [ tab : photnir ] , and the light curves are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : lcs ] .",
    "the csp - ii follow - up started immediately after the sn classification and close to maximum light .",
    "the time of maximum , which varies with wavelength , can be best constrained from our @xmath20-band data . by fitting a low - order polynomial , we estimate that maximum light occurred at @xmath21 ( february  10.9 ut ) .",
    "the @xmath22 band peaked @xmath23 days earlier and the bluer bands even earlier , however , the lack of sufficient pre - maximum data does not allow us to make accurate estimates .",
    "the @xmath20-band @xmath24 is the reference time that will be used throughout this paper . by applying a k - correction based on the pessto spectrum , we estimate that lsq14mo reached a maximum brightness of @xmath25 mag .",
    "broadband polarimetry was obtained with fors2 on the vlt in the @xmath0 band .",
    "fors2 is a dual beam polarimeter : a turnable half - wave retarder plate ( hwp ) is used to rotate orthogonal polarisation components and a wollaston prism separates them into an ordinary and extraordinary beam .",
    "a stripe mask is used on the focal plane to prevent the two beams from overlapping on the detector , at the expense of reducing the effective field of view ( fov ) by half .",
    "observations were obtained at four hwp angles ( @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 deg ) , which allows for an optimum determination of the linear stokes parameters . following @xcite ,",
    "the stokes parameters @xmath30 and @xmath31 were calculated through the normalised flux differences :    @xmath32    where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the intensities in the ordinary and extraordinary beams for each hwp angle @xmath35 respectively . in practice , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the fluxes ( in counts ) from the sn that are measured simultaneously for each angle in a single observation .",
    "we obtained five epochs of broadband polarimetry spanning 26 days in the rest - frame evolution of lsq14mo .",
    "a log of our observations is presented in table  [ tab : pola ] .",
    "the images were reduced in a standard manner .",
    "the flat - field frames that we used were obtained without polarisation units in the light path . to measure the sn fluxes",
    ", we used the python package pythonphot @xcite to perform psf photometry .",
    "unfortunately , the number of useful psf stars ( bright and non - saturated ) for each epoch was small and variable as the conditions , the exposure times , and even the exact centering of the sn ( affecting the masked fov ) varied between observations . however , we were always able to construct a reliable psf by using 2 - 5 stars .",
    "photometry was obtained for a total of 22 field stars in the fov , in addition to lsq14mo , although their number and utility vary with the epoch of observations .",
    "the errors in the @xmath33 and @xmath34 fluxes were propagated to obtain the errors in the stokes parameters @xmath30 , @xmath31 , the polarisation degree @xmath36 and the polarisation angle @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "the values of these parameters , describing the polarisation of lsq14mo , can be found in table  [ tab : pola ] .",
    "a consistency check was performed by observing the polarised standard star ngc  2014 - 1 and the unpolarised wd  0310 - 688 and wd  0752 - 676 @xcite .",
    "the values we derive for these standards are in agreement with @xcite , confirming that our reduction , photometry and analysis procedures are correct .",
    "three corrections need to be taken into account when computing @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 : instrumental polarisation , interstellar polarisation ( isp ; polarisation induced by dust along the line of sight  both in the milky way and the lsq14mo host ) , and ` polarisation bias ' .",
    "the instrumental polarisation caused by the instrument optics can vary across the fov .",
    "@xcite showed that fors1 exhibited a radial pattern in the @xmath0 band with polarisation increasing radially from the fov centre .",
    "because the two instruments are very similar , we used their relation to correct the measured stokes parameters of the field stars ( the sn is not affected as it is on the optical axis ) .",
    "the isp in the galaxy was estimated with the aid of the field stars .",
    "their positions on the @xmath30@xmath31 plane were used to determine ( weighted ) average galactic stokes parameters , which were subtracted vectorially from the measured @xmath30 and @xmath31 to obtain the intrinsic sn polarisation .",
    "the galactic isp was found to be small ( @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 ) in accordance with the maximum polarisation @xmath41 , which is expected by the low galactic extinction toward lsq14mo .",
    "similarly , we do not expect a large isp in the host galaxy : the estimated @xmath42 mag translates to a limit @xmath43 at the probed wavelength .",
    "the polarisation bias is a known effect ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) related to the fact that @xmath36 is obtained by adding @xmath30 and @xmath31 in quadrature and is therefore always a positive quantity . to correct for this effect we used the formula derived by @xcite through monte carlo simulations in their section 4.1 .",
    "the @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 for lsq14mo that are shown in table  [ tab : pola ] are the values obtained after applying the corrections above .",
    "finally , we checked the stability of the stokes parameters for the field stars during the different epochs .",
    "since these are not expected to vary with time , from their dispersion we estimated an rms error for each star .",
    "this rms error was included in the isp determination error budget but it was not applied directly to the lsq14mo stokes parameters in table  [ tab : pola ] .",
    "stars with similar s / n as the sn have typical rms errors of 0.38% in q and 0.24% in u. this can be considered as a systematic error that dominates over the errors in table  [ tab : pola ] .",
    "figure [ fig : qu ] shows the location of the sn on the @xmath30-@xmath31 plane .",
    "we perform a @xmath44 test to test the hypothesis that lsq14mo is not polarimetrically variable , i.e. that the values of @xmath30 and @xmath31 are constant with time .",
    "we obtain a reduced @xmath44/dof of 0.46 for @xmath30 and 1.63 for @xmath31 , around the values @xmath3 @xmath4 and @xmath5 @xmath6 .",
    "these @xmath44/dof correspond to p - values of 0.76 and 0.16 , respectively .",
    "there is thus no significant evidence for variability in the stokes parameters of lsq14mo .",
    "the @xmath31 parameter demonstrates higher dispersion than @xmath30 ( also visible in fig .",
    "[ fig : qu ] ) , but even in this case the evidence for variability is below @xmath45 .",
    "figure  [ fig : pv ] shows the time evolution of the polarisation degree @xmath36 together with the @xmath0-band light curve .",
    "this is consistent with an average value of @xmath46 @xmath4 .",
    "we only have five epochs of observations and therefore a more elaborate analysis is difficult .",
    "however , we note the following : our second epoch is the only epoch for which the polarisation measured for the field stars does not agree with the radial predictions by @xcite for the instrumental polarisation ( but it is higher ) . in addition , this epoch is the main source of dispersion ( rms error ) in the field stars stokes parameters . we were not able to understand the reasons behind this discrepancy but we note that these observations were carried relatively close to a bright moon . neglecting epoch 2 , and by inspecting figs .",
    "[ fig : qu ] and [ fig : pv ] , it is tempting to speculate whether our last point ( @xmath47 d ) tentatively indicates an increase in the polarisation .",
    "this would not be unprecedented : a similar behaviour is observed in sne  iip once the outer layers become optically thin @xcite . the picture suggested by @xcite in order to explain the spectroscopic evolution of slsne i is not very different : while we can not explain what causes the optically thick characteristic spectra of slsne i before and at maximum , it is reasonable to assume that during post - maximum phases we are peering deeper in the ejecta . if the core demonstrates a higher degree of asymmetry than the outer layers we would expect the polarisation to increase .",
    "even if motivated , this analysis remains speculative and it still does not yield any statistically significant result ( @xmath48-values @xmath49 for @xmath30 and @xmath31 ) . our data do not allow us to establish any evolution in the polarisation of lsq14mo .",
    "more and later data would be required to test this hypothesis .",
    "it was not possible to obtain such data as the fading sn quickly became too faint , making polarimetric observations very challenging .",
    "what is certain is that we did not detect a strong polarisation signal from lsq14mo and also that we found no significant evidence for evolution in this ( weak ) polarisation signal .",
    "the lack of polarisation evolution , which is not expected for a sn , suggests that the remaining weak signal ( @xmath3 , @xmath5 , @xmath50 ) could be explained entirely by isp in the host of lsq14mo .",
    "this is indeed consistent with the isp expected from the low reddening in the host ( @xmath43 ) , although this does not need to affect the sn line of sight .",
    "however , if this polarisation is indeed due to lsq14mo , and the accuracy of our measurements does not allow us to measure any polarisation evolution , the average @xmath50 would translate to a limit of @xmath51 in the asymmetry of the photosphere . therefore",
    ", at least during the period of our observations , the projected photosphere of lsq14mo appears close to spherically symmetric . on the other hand ,",
    "@xcite argue that for some sn atmospheres , where the continuum and the line formation regions overlap , and the electron scattering optical depth exceeds unity , cancellation effects might lead to a suppression of the polarisation , even for significantly aspherical geometries .",
    "this might be relevant for extended sne  iip . in any case",
    ", the type i slsn lsq14mo appears less polarised than sn  2006aj , a grb - associated sn that has been suggested to be powered by a magnetar @xcite , and more similar to sn  2008d , a more ordinary h - poor event for which spectropolarimetry suggests the presence of a stalled jet @xcite .",
    "the light curves and spectra of lsq14mo suggest that this is a typical slsn i. we can obviously not constrain the explosion mechanism of slsne from this single observation .",
    "however , the lack of significant asymmetries suggest that if lsq14mo is powered by csm interaction , this csm can not be significantly asymmetric .",
    "the same constraint applies to a magnetar model .",
    "we note that magnetars have been observed to show polarised emission in the radio @xcite .",
    "models based on the radioactive decay of @xmath52ni deposited symmetrically in the inner part of the ejecta @xcite have already been excluded by previous studies of slsne i ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    although broadband polarimetry does not probe spectral lines and the geometry of individual chemical elements in the same precision as spectropolarimetry , it is interesting to note that our @xmath0-band observations are centered exactly on the most prominent feature of the early lsq14mo spectrum , i.e. the w - shaped feature that has been identified as @xcite ( fig .",
    "[ fig : spec ] ) .",
    "the low polarisation in the broadband observations reduces the possibility that this feature is significantly polarised .",
    "our conclusions are not affected by the corrections we have applied for instrumental polarisation and isp . omitting these corrections ,",
    "the stokes parameters of lsq14mo remain low ( @xmath53 , @xmath54 ) and still do not show any significant ( @xmath55 ) evidence for variability .",
    "the main objective of this project is to infer geometric information on h - poor slsne that will expand our understanding of their nature . a pioneering step toward this direction",
    "was achieved by studying the broadband polarisation of the slsn i lsq14mo .",
    "these are challenging observations , as a target of 20 mag requires @xmath56 hr on the vlt to obtain a reasonable accuracy ( @xmath57 ) in the stokes parameters .",
    "furthermore , additional sources of polarisation , such as instrumental and interstellar polarisation , can increase the uncertainty budget to @xmath58 , which can become a nuisance , particularly if the target polarisation is intrinsically low .",
    "we have shown that lsq14mo can not be significantly polarised , at least during the phases it was observed ( between @xmath59 and @xmath60 days in the rest frame ) .",
    "this interval includes phases after maximum when deeper layers of the ejecta are exposed .",
    "in addition , we do not see any statistically significant ( @xmath61 ) evolution of the stokes parameters with time .",
    "this suggests that the low levels of polarisation ( @xmath3 , @xmath5 , @xmath50 ) can be entirely explained by isp in the host galaxy .",
    "such a low isp is consistent with the low levels of dust extinction in the host of lsq14mo . on the other hand ,",
    "if the polarisation we detect is entirely due to the sn , this would imply a constraint of @xmath51 in the photosphere asphericity .",
    "the conclusion we derive is that lsq14mo does not exhibit any significant deviation from spherical symmetry at the optical depths that we are probing .",
    "alternatively , it is a possibility that we may be looking at it from a special viewing angle or that cancellation effects in an extended atmosphere may have suppressed the polarisation @xcite .",
    "more observations of h - poor slsne are required in order to establish whether the results obtained here are general or apply only to lsq14mo . extending observations to later phases or obtaining spectral polarimetry , allowing to study the polarisation of each spectral feature separately , is especially interesting .    in the memory of our great friend and colleague javier",

    "<S> we conclude that , at least during the period of observations and at the optical depths probed , the photosphere of lsq14mo does not present significant asymmetries , unlike most lower - luminosity hydrogen - poor sne ib / c . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , it is possible that we may have observed lsq14mo from a special viewing angle . supporting spectroscopy and photometry confirm that lsq14mo is a typical slsn i. further studies of the polarisation of type i slsne are required to determine whether the low levels of polarisation are a characteristic of the entire class and to also study the implications for the proposed explosion models . </S>"
