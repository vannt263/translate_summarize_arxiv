    "oriented knots @xmath4 and @xmath5 in the 3-sphere are called ( topologically ) _ concordant _ if there is a topologically locally flat proper embedding of @xmath12 $ ] into @xmath13 $ ] that restricts to the @xmath9 on @xmath14 .",

    "this group is called the _ ( topological ) knot concordance group_. the classification of the knot concordance group is still open , and it has been one of the central problems in knot theory . a common strategy of investigating the knot concordance group is to extract information from abelian covers or metabelian covers of the exterior of a knot ( see @xcite ) .",
    "on the other hand , requiring smooth embedding instead of topologically locally flat embedding , we can define the _ smooth knot concordance group _ , which is denoted by @xmath18 . in smooth knot concordance theory , there have been recent and very interesting developments using knot floer homology @xcite and khovanov homology @xcite . in this paper",
    "we concern ourselves mainly with topological knot concordance .",

    "cot showed that the previously known abelian and metabelian concordance invariants are reflected at the first stage of their filtration @xcite , implying that the abelian group @xmath23 has infinite rank .",
    "they also established that @xmath24 has infinite rank @xcite .",
    "moreover , cochran and teichner showed that @xmath25 has positive rank for every integer @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "it is still unknown whether or not @xmath25 is infinitely generated for @xmath27 , or whether or not @xmath28 is non - trivial .",
    "thus , although @xmath29 has been shown to be highly non - trivial , many questions about its structure remain open .",
    "these non - triviality results have been refined in the case @xmath30 . c. livingston recently asked if one can always find non - concordant knots which share a given ( classical ) seifert form",
    "that is , given @xmath8 , can one always find other knots , distinct up to concordance , which share the same ( classical ) seifert form as @xmath8 ? as he observed , if @xmath8 has the seifert form of an unknot ( has alexander polynomial @xmath31 ) then the answer is certainly `` no '' , since all knots with alexander polynomial @xmath31 are topologically concordant to the trivial knot and hence concordant to each other ( by m. freedman s work @xcite ) .",
    "livingston gave a partial answer in the positive to his question using casson - gordon invariants @xcite .",
    "this work was completed by the second author , who showed that there always exist such knots for a given ( classical ) seifert form if and only if the alexander polynomial of the seifert form is not trivial .",
    "more precisely , in @xcite he showed that for a given knot @xmath8 whose alexander polynomial has degree at least @xmath32 , there are infinitely many knots @xmath9 ( with @xmath33 ) such that @xmath34 is @xmath31-solvable , but @xmath35 ( @xmath36 is not @xmath37-solvable , and @xmath9 shares the same ( classical ) seifert form ( hence the same ( classical ) alexander module ) as the knot @xmath8",
    ". we view these results as non - triviality results for @xmath29 that are finer ( for @xmath30 ) than those of @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "they suggest further questions .",

    "moreover , is there an even finer result that constructs such examples while fixing not only the ( classical ) seifert form ( hence the ( classical ) alexander module ) but also the higher - order seifert forms and higher - order alexander modules developed in @xcite ? this paper answers these questions in the positive as long as the degree of the alexander polynomial is at least @xmath39 ( see below ) .",
    "to do so we found the need to extend the technology of @xcite to a `` relative '' setting , and to greatly generalize the key technical result of cochran and teichner ( * ? ? ? * theorem 4.3 ) .",
    "we expect that this extended technology will be of independent interest , enabling further work in this area .    in this paper ,",
    "we introduce the notion of an _ @xmath6-cylinder _",
    "( definition  [ defn : n - cylinder ] ) , generalizing the notion of an @xmath6-solution of cot .",
    "the difference is that an @xmath6-solution allows only one boundary component , whereas an @xmath6-cylinder can have multiple boundary components .",
    "a basic ( trivial ) example of an @xmath6-cylinder ( with two boundary components ) is a ( spin ) homology cobordism between the zero surgeries on two knots .",
    "if two knots are concordant then one can easily find such an @xmath6-cylinder ( which in this case is a homology cobordism ) , by doing surgery on @xmath40 $ ] along the annulus cobounded by the knots ( remark  [ rem : n - cylinder](4 ) ) .",
    "using this , we define a family of new equivalence relations on the knot concordance group , that we call _ @xmath6-solvequivalence _ ( see definition  [ defn : n - solvequivalence ] ) : @xmath4 is _",
    "@xmath6-solvequivalent _ to @xmath5 if the zero - framed surgery on @xmath4 and the zero - framed surgery on @xmath5 cobound an @xmath6-cylinder . from the basic example",
    "above , it is clear that concordant knots are @xmath6-solvequivalent for all @xmath6 .    on the other hand",
    ", the filtration @xmath29 of cot immediately suggests another family of equivalence relations on @xmath0 , given as follows .",
    "we say @xmath4 and @xmath5 are _ concordant modulo @xmath6-solvability _ if @xmath15 is @xmath6-solvable .",
    "there is a close relationship between @xmath6-solvability and @xmath6-solvequivalence .",
    "it is not difficult to show that if two knots are concordant modulo @xmath6-solvability , then they are @xmath6-solvequivalent ( proposition  [ prop : old and new ] ) , but we have not been able to establish the converse . hence @xmath6-solvequivalence is a possibly weaker obstruction to concordance than @xmath6-solvability .",
    "note that @xmath6-solvequivalence reflects information on the zero surgeries on _ each _ @xmath9 separately , but _ concordance modulo @xmath6-solvability _ reflects only information on the zero surgery on @xmath15 ( see proposition  [ prop : p and p perb ] ) .    as an application of @xmath6-solvequivalence and of our other extensions of the technology of @xcite@xcite @xcite",
    ", we obtain the following theorem , generalizing the nontriviality results cited above .",
    "the condition that the degree of the alexander polynomial be at least @xmath39 may seem ad hoc",

    "therefore , the case @xmath30 of our theorem recovers the previously mentioned results of livingston and kim .",
    "if the degree of the alexander polynomial is precisely @xmath32 then the livingston - kim result says that it is possible to fix the _ classical _ seifert matrix ( @xmath64 ) , but we show , using recent work of friedl and teichner , that there are at least _ some _ such knots for which it is _ not possible _ to fix any higher - order seifert presentation matrices .",

    "<S> we establish certain `` nontriviality '' results for several filtrations of the smooth and topological knot concordance groups . </S>",
    "<S> first , as regards the _ n - solvable filtration _ of the topological knot concordance group , @xmath0 , defined by k. orr , p. teichner and the first author @xcite : @xmath1 we refine the recent nontriviality results of cochran and teichner @xcite by including information on the alexander modules . </S>",
    "<S> these results also extend those of c. livingston @xcite and the second author @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we exhibit similar structure in the closely related _ symmetric grope filtration _ of @xmath0 considered in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that the grope filtration of the _ smooth _ concordance group is nontrivial using examples that can not be distinguished by the ozsvth - szab @xmath2-invariant nor by j. rasmussen s @xmath3-invariant @xcite@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our broader contribution is to establish , in `` the relative case '' , the key homological results whose analogues cochran - orr - teichner established in `` the absolute case '' in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we say two knots @xmath4 and @xmath5 are _ concordant modulo @xmath6-solvability _ if @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> our main result is that , for any knot @xmath8 whose classical alexander polynomial has degree greater than 2 , and for any positive integer @xmath6 , there exist infinitely many knots @xmath9 that are concordant to @xmath8 modulo @xmath6-solvability , but are all distinct modulo @xmath10-solvability . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the @xmath9 and @xmath8 share the same classical seifert matrix and alexander module as well as sharing the same _ higher - order _ _ alexander modules _ and seifert presentations up to order @xmath11 .     the first author was partially supported by the national science foundation ] </S>"
