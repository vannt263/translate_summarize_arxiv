    "starting with the work of @xcite , percolation problems on geometric models defined over the poisson point process have garnered interest among both stochastic geometers and network theorists . relying and building upon the ( on - going ) successful study of its discrete counterpart(@xcite ) ,",
    "continuum percolation has also received considerable attention as evinced in the monographs @xcite and @xcite .",
    "our work shall deviate from the standard approach of studying geometric models based on the poisson point process , by focusing on percolation models defined over general stationary point processes .",
    "in particular , we shall try to _ formalize the comparison of `` clustering '' phenomena in point processes and investigate its impact on percolation models .",
    "_    the new approach contributes to both theory and applications .",
    "results regarding percolation on `` clustered '' or `` repulsive '' point processes are scarce ( we shall say more in section  [ sec : related ] ) .",
    "our methods help in a more systematic study of models over general stationary point processes apart from the ubiquitous poisson point process .",
    "in particular , we _ relate percolation properites of the geometric models to the more intrinsic properties of point processes such as moment measures and void probabilities_. as regards applications , we observe that the poissonian assumption on point processes is not always preferable in many models of spatial networks . in such scenarios , the question of whether clustering or repulsion increases various performance measures ( related to some property of the underlying geometric graph ) or not arises naturally .",
    "percolation is one such performance measure and we refer the reader to the upcoming survey ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 4 ) for a more comprehensive overview of applications of our methods for comparison of various other properties of geometric graphs .    with this succinct introduction , we shall now get into our key percolation model . as a sample of our results",
    ", we will present here in detail the particular case of @xmath0-percolation alone with a brief discussion of other results .",
    "the point process notions used in the rest of the section are described formally in section [ s.point_processes ] .      by _ percolation of a set _",
    "( in the euclidean space usually ) , we mean that the set contains an unbounded connected subset .",
    "we shall also use _ percolation of a graph _ , where it means existence of an infinite connected subgraph . by @xmath0-percolation in a boolean model ,",
    "we understand percolation of the subset of the space covered by at least @xmath0 grains of the boolean model and more rigorously , we define as follows .",

    "note that @xmath12 is the standard boolean model or continuum percolation model mentioned in the first paragraph .",
    "it can also be viewed as a graph by taking @xmath1 as the vertex set and the edge - set being @xmath13 this is the usual random geometric graph , called also the gilbert s disk graph .",
    "the two notions of percolation ( graph - theoretical and topological ) are the same in this case .",
    "the more general set @xmath14 can also be viewed as a graph on @xmath0-faces of the ech complex on @xmath1 and this shall be explained later in remark [ rem : cech_complex ] . clearly , @xmath15 is the _",
    "critical radius _ of the `` usual '' continuum percolation model on  @xmath1 , and we have @xmath16 .",
    "we shall use clustering properties of @xmath1 to get bounds on @xmath17 .      before stating our percolation result ,",
    "let us discuss more about clustering and percolation heuristics .",
    "clustering of @xmath1 roughly means that the points of @xmath1 lie in clusters ( groups ) with the clusters being well spaced out .",
    "when trying to find the minimal @xmath8 for which the continuum percolation model @xmath18 percolates , we observe that points lying in the same cluster of @xmath1 will be connected by edges for some smaller @xmath8 but points in different clusters need a relatively higher @xmath8 for having edges between them .",
    "moreover , percolation can not be achieved without edges between some points of different clusters .",
    "it seems to be evident that spreading points from clusters of @xmath1 `` more homogeneously '' in the space would result in a decrease of the radius @xmath8 for which the percolation takes place .",
    "this is a heuristic explanation why clustering in a point process @xmath1 should increase the critical radius @xmath19 and a similar reasoning can also be given for @xmath20 .",
    "our study was motivated by this heuristic .    to make a formal statement of the above heuristic",
    ", one needs to adopt a tool to compare clustering properties of point processes . in this",
    "regard , our initial choice was _ directionally convex _ ( @xmath21 ) order order of random vectors is an integral order generated by twice differentiable functions with all their second order partial derivatives being non - negative .",
    "its extension to point processes consists in comparison of vectors of number of points in every possible finite collection of bounded borel subsets of the space . ]",
    "( to be formally defined later ) .",
    "it has its roots in @xcite , where one shows various results as well as examples indicating that the @xmath21 order on point processes implies ordering of several well - known clustering characteristics in spatial statistics such as ripley s k - function and second moment densities .",
    "namely , a point process that is larger in the @xmath21 order exhibits more clustering , while having equal mean number of points in any given set .    in view of",
    "what has been said above , a possible formalization of the heuristic developed above , that clustering `` worsens '' percolation , would be @xmath22 implies @xmath23 .",
    "the numerical evidences gathered for a certain class of point processes , called perturbed lattice point processes , were supportive of this conjecture ( cf  @xcite ) .",
    "however , such a statement is not true in full generality and we shall provide a counterexample in section  [ sec : ex ] .",
    "we can also consider some weaker notions of clustering , for which only moment measures or void probabilities can be compared .",
    "[ defn : weak_subp ] a point process @xmath1  is said to be _ weakly sub - poisson _ if the following two conditions are satisfied : @xmath24 where @xmath25 are mutually disjoint bbs and @xmath26 is any bbs .",

    ". similar notions of super - poissonianity can be defined by reversing the inequalities .    again , larger values of these characteristics ( i.e , void probabilities and factorial moment measures ) suggest more clustering and hence they also can be used to compare clustering of point processes . this comparison is weaker than @xmath21 order and association as well .",
    "more details on these notions are provided in section [ s.notation ] .",
    "it is explained in  @xcite , that weak sub - poissonianity allows for a slightly different conclusion than the heuristic described before the definition .",
    "suppose that @xmath29 is a stationary poisson point process and @xmath30 is a stationary weakly sub - poisson point process .",
    "then , @xmath30 exhibits the usual phase transition @xmath31 , provided @xmath29 exhibits a ( potentially ) stronger , `` double phase transition '' : @xmath32 and @xmath33 , where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are some `` nonstandard '' critical radii   and @xmath35 are critical radii related , respectively , to the finiteness of asymptotic of the expected number of long occupied paths from the origin and the expected number of void circuits around the origin in suitable discrete approximations of the continuum model . ] sandwiching @xmath36 , and exhibiting opposite monotonicity with respect to clustering : @xmath37 conjecturing that the above `` double phase transition '' holds for the poisson point process @xmath29 , one obtains the result on the `` usual '' phase transition for @xmath38 for all weakly sub - poisson point processes @xmath30 . from (",
