    "electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) in atomic systems is a quantum interference effect resulting in reduced absorption of a weak probe field in resonance with an atomic transition while propagating through a medium in presence of a strong coupling field @xcite . since its first experimental realization in 1991 by boller et al .",
    "@xcite in strontium vapour , the phenomenon of eit has been instrumental in the progress of various fields , such as nonlinear optics @xcite , sensitive magnetometry @xcite , rydberg states spectroscopy @xcite and laser frequency stabilization @xcite . mostly , these eit related studies have been carried out either using doppler - free configuration of coupling and probe beams in an atomic vapour cell @xcite or in an inherently doppler - free environment of cold atoms @xcite .",
    "the elimination of doppler broadening effect and low collisional dephasing rate has made the cold atoms an attractive medium to explore the eit effect with moderate coupling beam intensities @xcite .",
    "the use of cold atoms , in addition to simplifying the analysis of the results , has also allowed a much more flexible experimental arrangement due to the possibility of propagation of coupling and the probe beams in arbitrary directions . as a result , many recent experiments on quantum information processing @xcite and quantum interference switching @xcite have successfully involved cold alkali atoms using either three - level atomic configurations such as @xmath2-type , @xmath6-type , ladder - type or their combinations @xcite .",
    "the strength of the signal in an eit experiment usually depends on the atomic configuration used .",
    "for example , a three - level @xmath2-type system with minimum coherence dephasing rate of the dipole - forbidden transition provides maximum transparency at the line centre for the eit signal @xcite .",
    "a practical @xmath2-type system such as that realized with alkali atoms , however , involves hyperfine energy levels with many associated degenerate zeeman - sublevels .",
    "chen et al .",
    "@xcite have observed that the spectral profile of the eit signal depends on the individual transitions among the zeeman - sublevels which can be grouped together according to the selection rules to form a multi - fold of @xmath2-type systems .",
    "yan et al . @xcite have further noticed that an ideal closed three - level @xmath2-type system can be obtained from such a laser - coupling formation , provided , the zeeman - sublevels of the excited hyperfine level f@xmath7 are simultaneously coupled to the zeeman - sublevels of ground coupling hyperfine level f@xmath8 and ground probe hyperfine level f@xmath9 . using a dark - mot configuration @xcite ,",
    "this formation was realized using cold @xmath10rb atoms collected in the lower hyperfine level of the ground state and satisfying the condition , f@xmath8 @xmath11 f@xmath9 .",
    "however , the strong coupling and trapping laser beams operating at d@xmath12-line and d@xmath13-line transitions , respectively , involved the same upper hyperfine level of the ground state .",
    "this required the experiment to be operated in a sequential mode with a periodic turning - off of the trapping beams .",
    "+ in this work , we present a new experimental scheme to obtain @xmath2-type eit systems using cold @xmath0rb atoms in the lower hyperfine level f = 2 of the ground state 5@xmath1 . here , the cold atoms were obtained by directly cooling and trapping them into the lower hyperfine ground state without resorting to the dark - mot technique .",
    "this magneto - optical trapping of @xmath0rb atoms involving cycling transition f = 2 @xmath14 f@xmath3 = 1 has been reported earlier by us @xcite . in contrast with the transient mode of operation reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , our scheme allowed us to use a steady state cold atomic sample in the lower hyperfine level of the ground state .",
    "moreover , the formation of @xmath2-type eit systems did not involve d@xmath12-line coupling and probe excitations resulting in a considerable simplification of the experimental setup . using mutually perpendicular linearly polarized coupling and probe beams , we obtained two steady state @xmath2-type eit systems when cold atoms were probed for transition into the hyperfine level f@xmath3 = 2 and f@xmath3 = 3 of the excited state 5@xmath4 in the presence of coupling transitions f = 3 @xmath5 f@xmath3 = 2 and f = 3 @xmath5 f@xmath3 = 3 , respectively .",
    "the experimental observations on the effects of uncoupled magnetic sublevel transitions and coupling field s rabi frequency on the eit signal from these systems were found to be in good agreement with the theoretical calculations .",
    "these results clearly demonstrate the role of zeeman sublevels associated with the common excited state in the consideration of a @xmath2-type eit system involving hyperfine levels .",
    "figure 1(a ) shows the schematic diagram of our experimental setup .",
    "the mot chamber was pumped down to a pressure of @xmath15 1@xmath1610@xmath17 torr using a turbo molecular pump and a sputter - ion pump .",
    "rb vapour was injected in the chamber by passing a constant current of  @xmath15 3.5 a through two rb - getters fixed in series .",
    "the magnetic field gradient required at the center of the trap was produced by a pair of quadrupole coils . during the experiment , the radial magnetic field gradient",
    "db / dz was fixed at 10 g / cm .",
    "all stray magnetic fields were removed by the use of three orthogonal pairs of compensating coils .",
    "three orthogonal pairs of @xmath18 and @xmath19 trapping laser beams ( t ) with nearly equal intensity were produced using pbs with @xmath20/2 and @xmath20/4 retardation plates .",
    "one pair of counterpropagating laser beams was aligned with the axis of the coils ( x - axis ) .",
    "the other two pairs of counterpropagating beams were located in the symmetry plane ( yz - plane ) of the coils , inclined at @xmath21 with respect to the vertical z - axis .",
    "these trapping laser beams of nearly gaussian shape with a 1/e@xmath22 diameter of 7.6 mm , intersected near the zero of the magnetic field .",
    "the frequency of the trapping laser was locked at the centre of the cyclic transition 5@xmath22s@xmath23(f = 2)@xmath245@xmath22p@xmath25 ( f@xmath3= 1 ) of @xmath26rb using the bi - polarization spectroscopy technique @xcite at @xmath27 = 780 nm .",
    "the total intensity of all the six trapping laser beams used in our experiment was 50 mw / cm@xmath22 ( the saturation intensity i@xmath29 @xmath15 2.8 mw / cm@xmath22 for the cooling transition ) .",
    "a linearly polarised repumping laser beam ( r ) separately propagated through the trap center along the vertical z - axis with its frequency locked to the peak of 5@xmath22s@xmath30(f = 3)@xmath245@xmath22p@xmath25 ( f@xmath3= 3 or 2 ) transition using the doppler - free dichroic lock technique @xcite .",
    "the repumping laser beam had a 1/e@xmath22 diameter of 5.6 mm with maximum power of 20 mw .",
    "in these experiments , the repumping beam of the trap was also used as a coupling beam c. a weak probe beam p of power 1 @xmath31w with nearly uniform intensity was passed through the atom cloud and its transmission was detected using photo - detector pd-1 .",
    "the two beams c and p have orthogonal linear polarizations and propagate perpendicular to each other",
    ". the mutual perpendicular propagation of these beams ensured that any observed eit signal was produced by the cold atoms and not by the thermal background rubidium vapour .",
    "the fluorescence of the cloud was measured using a low noise level photo - detector pd-2 and a ccd camera to estimate the number and temperature of the trapped atoms .",
    "the energy level diagram used for investigating three - level @xmath2-type system with @xmath0rb atoms trapped in the lower hyperfine ground state is shown in fig.1 ( b ) .",
    "the frequency of the trapping laser was red detuned by @xmath32 = -12 mhz , from the centre of the cyclic transition 5@xmath33s@xmath34(f = 2)@xmath245@xmath22p@xmath35 ( f= 1 ) of @xmath26rb by using a pair of accousto - optical modulators . in the @xmath2-type system",
    "studied here , the hyperfine level f@xmath3= 3 ( or f@xmath3= 2 ) of 5@xmath22p@xmath36 served as excited state @xmath37 .",
    "the hyperfine levels f = 2 and f = 3 of the ground state 5@xmath38s@xmath39 were used as two ground states @xmath40 and @xmath41 of the @xmath2-type system , respectively [ fig .",
    "2 ( a ) and ( b ) ] . the atoms were pumped between the 5@xmath38s@xmath39 , f = 3 and 5@xmath22p@xmath36 , f@xmath3= 3 ( or f@xmath3= 2 ) states by the coupling laser ( solid lines ) and probed between the 5@xmath38s@xmath39 , f = 2 and 5@xmath22p@xmath36 , f@xmath3= 3 ( or f@xmath3= 2 ) states by the weak probe laser ( dotted lines ) .",
    "to understand the experimentally obtained eit signal , we have used a theoretical model for three - level @xmath2-type system described by a semiclassical theory @xcite . in this three level model , the energy level @xmath40 is probed for transition to an upper energy level @xmath37 which itself",
    "is strongly coupled to another lower level @xmath41 . the transitions @xmath40",
    "@xmath5 @xmath37 and @xmath41 @xmath5 @xmath37 have the resonance frequencies as @xmath42 and @xmath43 , respectively .",
    "a weak probe laser beam having frequency @xmath44 scans over the excited state hyperfine level which is also coupled to the another hyperfine level of the ground state by a resonant strong coupling laser beam . + for a three level @xmath2-type system composed of hyperfine levels , the degenerate zeeman sublevels play an important role in deciding the strength of the eit signal @xcite .",
    "as long as all the zeeman probe transitions are connected with the coupling transitions , the @xmath2-type configuration can be treated as an effectively closed system .",
    "this system may be taken as the superposition of several independent three level systems @xcite .",
    "the resulting eit signal is also maximum for this case . on the other hand , presence of some probe transitions without the interference of the coupling field renders the eit system , effectively not closed .",
    "consequently such a system can be modeled by a combination of three level and two level systems .",
    "the resulting spectrum is a combination of the eit profile and the lorentzian absorption profile with a peak at the resonance frequency .",
    "since the spatial variation of magnetic field over the atom cloud dimensions was small ( @xmath45 1 g ) , we have assumed the hyperfine levels to be nearly degenerate . in this approximation",
    ", the decoherence rate due to the zeeman splitting of the hyperfine levels can be added to the decoherence rate of the relaxation process containing spontaneous decay @xcite . under this approximation ,",
    "the real and imaginary parts of the complex succetibility , @xmath46 = ( @xmath47 + @xmath48 ) for a resonant coupling field are given by , @xmath49\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath50\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , @xmath51 = @xmath44 - @xmath42 , x = @xmath52 and y = @xmath53 .",

    "the summation over ( k , l ) pair refers to the probe transitions from magnetic sublevels of state @xmath40 to the magnetic sublevels of excited state @xmath37 which are not connected by the coupling beam .",
    "accordingly , the first term inside the bracket on the right hand side of eqs ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) denotes the eit process whereas the second term in the respective equations corresponds to simple refraction and absorption of the probe beam .",
    "the rabi frequency of the coupling light is given by , @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the coupling laser beam intensity , @xmath59 is the saturation intensity and @xmath60 ( 2 @xmath61 5.9 mhz ) is the natural line - width of the transition .",
    "+ the mean radiative decay rates of levels @xmath37 and @xmath40 is @xmath62 , whereas the non - radiative decay rate between the ground states , @xmath40 and @xmath41 is @xmath63 .",
    "the strength of the eit signal strongly depends on the coherence dephasing rate of the dipole - forbidden transition between energy states @xmath40 and @xmath41 . for an ideal eit @xmath2-type system , @xmath62 = @xmath64 and @xmath63 = 0 , results in total transparency at the transition line center .",
    "however , when the laser line shape is considered to be a lorentzian shape , the effect of the finite laser line - width should be included in the decay rates .",
    "moreover , the magnetic field inhomogeneity further adds to the decoherence rates for the relaxation processes .",
    "this magnetic field inhomogeneity depends on the magnetic field shifting of the magnetic sublevels over the cold atom cloud dimensions . so that @xmath65 and @xmath66 , where @xmath67 and @xmath68 are the line - widths of the probe and coupling beams , respectively and @xmath69 is the zeeman shift caused by the magnetic field in the region of atom cloud . + the real and imaginary components of complex dielectric function are related with the components of the complex succeptibility , as follows , @xmath70 the propagation of the probe electric field along the z - direction in a medium having complex refractive index n = n@xmath71+@xmath72 n@xmath73 , is given by @xcite , @xmath74 where the real and imaginary components of the complex propagation wavevector are given by k@xmath71 = n@xmath71 @xmath75/c and k@xmath73 = n@xmath73 @xmath75/c , respectively and therefore , the wave propagates with phase velocity c/@xmath76 and attenuation constant @xmath77@xmath75/c .",

    "the results of calculation of eit@xmath84 and their comparison with experimental results are discussed in the next section .",
    "as mentioned earlier , we have investigated eit signal from @xmath2-type systems obtained by tuning coupling laser frequency to the peak of two different transitions , 5@xmath33s@xmath34(f = 3 ) @xmath14 5@xmath33p@xmath88 ( f@xmath3= 3 ) and ( f@xmath3= 2 ) , and shown in fig.2(a ) and ( b ) , respectively .",

    "eit@xmath84 was estimated to be @xmath45 0.45 for @xmath97@xmath45 10 mhz . whereas , the eit@xmath84 was @xmath45 0.9 for @xmath97@xmath45 10 mhz , when an effectively closed @xmath2-type system was obtained by coupling to f@xmath3 = 2 level .",
