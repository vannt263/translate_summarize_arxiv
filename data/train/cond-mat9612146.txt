    "<S> we study resonant tunneling through quantum - dot systems in the presence of strong coulomb repulsion and coupling to the metallic leads . </S>",
    "<S> motivated by recent experiments we concentrate on ( i ) a single dot with two energy levels and ( ii ) a double dot with one level in each dot . </S>",
    "<S> each level is twofold spin - degenerate . </S>",
    "<S> depending on the level spacing these systems are physical realizations of different kondo - type models . using a real - time diagrammatic formulation we evaluate the spectral density and the non - linear conductance . </S>",
    "<S> the latter shows a novel triple - peak resonant structure .    </S>",
    "<S> = 10000    quantum transport of electrons through discrete energy levels in quantum dots has been studied both experimentally @xcite and theoretically @xcite . in small dots </S>",
    "<S> the coulomb repulsion is strong and may yield the dominant energy scale , which gives rise to coulomb blockade phenomena ( see e.g. refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for single dots and refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for multiple dots ) . at high temperatures , or when the coupling between the dots and metallic leads is weak , the electrons tunnel through the system sequentially . at low temperatures and for strong coupling to the leads resonant tunneling processes contribute significantly to the current @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the purpose of this letter is to investigate electronic transport phenomena through two ultrasmall quantum - dot systems : ( i ) a single dot with two energy levels and ( ii ) a double dot with a single level in each dot ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fg : double dot ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> we will show that the two models can be mapped onto each other . </S>",
    "<S> thus , it is sufficient to concentrate on one , the single - dot model with two levels . in both cases we assume strong coulomb repulsion between the electrons , such that we have to consider only two charge states , e.g. the empty or the singly - occupied dot system . </S>",
    "<S> we further allow for strong coupling between the quantum dot(s ) and the metallic leads adjacent to them . </S>",
    "<S> this gives rise to resonant tunneling and  as has been shown for a single dot with one energy level @xcite  nonequilibrium kondo effects . in the following </S>",
    "<S> we consider the case with vanishing magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> accordingly the single - electron states are spin - degenerate , which is a prerequisite for kondo effects . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that the models could be realized experimentally in a setup resembling those in refs . .    </S>",
    "<S> a systematic description of resonant tunneling phenomena has been developed in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite in terms of a real - time diagrammatic technique . </S>",
    "<S> it has been applied to the problems of electron transport through a single - level quantum dot as well as through a small metal island , both connected to reservoirs via tunnel junctions . in the quantum dot kondo - type effects manifest themselves as a zero - bias maximum in the differential conductance . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , a zero - bias minimum has been predicted for the case where the level lies above the electrochemical potentials of the reservoirs @xcite . generalizing this method we calculate the spectral density of the two - level dot and the differential conductance for the current through the dot . as novel result </S>",
    "<S> we find a multiply peaked resonant structure both in the spectral functions and the differential conductance . </S>",
    "<S> when the two levels in the dot are positioned below the electrochemical potentials of the leads a triple - peak structure emerges in the nonlinear conductance : a zero - bias maximum with one satellite peak on each side . when the levels lie above the electrochemical potentials the peaks turn into notches . depending on the level spacing our model interpolates between an @xmath0 and an @xmath1 kondo - type model ( generalized to include transitions between all spin states ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we denote the two energy levels of the dot by @xmath2 and @xmath3 ( the choice of @xmath4 and @xmath5 arises from the eigenstates of the double dot system ) . </S>",
    "<S> both levels are spin - degenerate , @xmath6 for @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian is a generalization of the anderson model , @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> the term @xmath9 describes the isolated quantum dot . </S>",
    "<S> the interaction of the electrons in the dot is accounted for by @xmath10 , with @xmath11 being the electron number . </S>",
    "<S> the electrons in the reservoirs are taken to be non - interacting , @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> the tunneling hamiltonian @xmath13 describes tunneling between the dot and the reservoirs .    the double - dot system coupled in series between two reservoirs as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fg : double dot ] with one spin - degenerate level in each dot is described by the hamiltonian @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian of the two capacitively coupled dots is @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the terms referring to both dots it contains an additional interaction term @xmath16 . the index @xmath17 denotes the left or right dot , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the term @xmath18 describes the tunneling between the dots , while the tunneling hamiltonian @xmath19 is modified such that it only couples each dot to the lead adjacent to it .    </S>",
    "<S> the double - dot model can be mapped onto the two - level single - dot model in the regime of large charging energy , i.e. , when @xmath10 and @xmath20 are larger than all other energy scales of the system . </S>",
    "<S> then it is sufficient to consider only two adjacent charge states of the double dot . for appropriate values of a gate voltage coupled to the dots these states are the empty and the singly charged dot system . </S>",
    "<S> then , we first solve the exact eigenstates of the double dot isolated from the leads , i.e. , the eigenstates of @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> they are symmetric and antisymmetric combination of the single - dot states in the left and right - hand dots @xmath22 and @xmath23 , with energies @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the tunneling @xmath19 couples the leads to these new eigenstates . </S>",
    "<S> thus the effective tunneling matrix elements are @xmath24 . except for this modification of the matrix elements the double - dot system coincides with the two - level single dot .    </S>",
    "<S> the mapping is not possible if we consider doubly - occupied states . </S>",
    "<S> the interaction between electrons in the same dot is stronger than between electrons in different dots . </S>",
    "<S> hence two electrons in a double dot prefer to stay in different dots , and the low energy two - electron states are formed from these single - electron states only . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast in a single dot the two - electron states are composed of all single - electron states . by symmetry , </S>",
    "<S> in the case of three and four electron states the mapping is possible again .    </S>",
    "<S> physical quantities of interest can be expressed as quantum statistical averages . in particular , the d.c . </S>",
    "<S> current through the quantum dot takes the form @xmath25 the statistical average of an arbitrary operator @xmath26 can , quite generally , be expressed as @xmath27 the time integration is performed along the _ keldysh contour _ , </S>",
    "<S> i.e. , forward in time from some initial time @xmath28 to @xmath29 and then backward from @xmath29 to @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> the time - ordering operator @xmath30 arranges operators with respect to this keldysh contour . </S>",
    "<S> the subscript i denotes the interaction picture with respect to @xmath31 .    </S>",
    "<S> the leads are assumed to be large and in thermal equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> their electrochemical potentials are kept fixed at @xmath32 ( for r = l , r ) , and their electron distributions are described with fermi functions . </S>",
    "<S> we are interested in the time evolution of the quantum states of the dot system , and therefore consider the reduced density matrix of the dot . to do this we first expand the exponential part in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : average ] ) into a series of the form @xmath33 here the times of the integrals are ordered with respect to the keldysh contour , such that @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> the expectation value of this series is taken by tracing over the non - interacting reservoirs in the density matrices . </S>",
    "<S> we can perform the trace over the reservoir degrees of freedom exactly since the unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath35 is bilinear in the lead - electron operators . </S>",
    "<S> these facts allow us to apply wick s theorem , and the forward and backward propagators become coupled due to the trace over the leads . in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite a systematic diagrammatic technique has been developed for presenting the terms of the expansion eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : expansion ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> there are well - defined rules for evaluating an arbitrary diagram and it is possible to identify and study processes of different orders .    the current can be expressed in terms of the spectral densities @xmath36 of the electron states in the dot as @xmath37          a_{i\\sigma}(\\omega).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the factors @xmath38 describe the coupling between the dot level @xmath39 and the lead @xmath40 and they are assumed to be independent of energy @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the spectral function describes the spectrum of possible excitation of the system . in general there </S>",
    "<S> exist separate green s and spectral functions for the four states of the dot : one for each spin of each level . here </S>",
    "<S> we restrict ourselves to the zero - field case such that the levels and the corresponding spectral functions are spin - degenerate .    </S>",
    "<S> in general , we can not sum up _ all _ possible contribution from the expansion eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : expansion ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> similar as in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite we proceed in a conserving approximation , taking into account non - diagonal matrix elements of the total density matrix up to the difference of one electron - hole pair excitation in the leads . in this case </S>",
    "<S> we find a set of integral equations for the spectral densities @xmath36 . while the coupling between the dot and the reservoirs is described within this approximation scheme , the double - dot states are solved exactly . </S>",
    "<S> this is reasonable when the coupling strength between the dots is at least comparable to the coupling between the dots and the leads .    in the following , </S>",
    "<S> we choose a symmetrical bias @xmath41 and consider equal - strength coupling of the dot to the leads @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting conductance curves are symmetrical as a function of the voltage . </S>",
    "<S> the values for the energy levels that we mention , e.g. , in the context of the illustrations , refer to the level positions before the renormalization due to tunneling . </S>",
    "<S> however , when we talk about levels being above or below the electrochemical potentials we refer to the renormalized measurable level positions . finally , we choose the temperature @xmath43 , where @xmath44 provides the energy scale , such that the thermal energies are always lower than the level spacing in the dots and much lower than the charging energy .    in the spectral densities </S>",
    "<S> @xmath45 there appear a complex , energy - dependent self - energy term which yields a broadening as well as renormalization of the dot levels . </S>",
    "<S> the energy - dependence of the self - energy term is due to the resonant - tunneling processes , and it results in a non - trivial functional form of the spectral functions . on top of this structure </S>",
    "<S> kondo - type resonances may appear as a sharp peaked structure at the position(s ) of the electrochemical potential(s ) . </S>",
    "<S> these general effects of resonant tunneling have been found already in the investigations of a single one - level quantum dot @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we keep the lower level below the electrochemical potentials of the leads such that @xmath46 . tuning the upper level @xmath47 </S>",
    "<S> allows a crossover from the one - level limit , @xmath48 , to a fourfold - degenerate level , @xmath49 . for the single - dot model </S>",
    "<S> the level separation @xmath50 reflects the actual physical level separation , whereas it is proportional to the coupling strength between the two dots for the double - dot model . in the limit of infinite level separation </S>",
    "<S> the spectral density @xmath51 reproduces results obtained before for a single level  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these are the level renormalization and broadening , as well as  for @xmath46 </S>",
    "<S>  kondo - type resonances at the electrochemical potentials of the leads . for a low lying level </S>",
    "<S> this corresponds to the @xmath0 kondo problem , however generalized to a nonequilibrium situation if a transport voltage is applied .    </S>",
    "<S> when the second level is included , the kondo peak of the single - level model persists . </S>",
    "<S> however , the renormalization effect is stronger and , as long as @xmath52 , a further peak in the spectral functions appears ( see the dashed curves in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fg : split ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this peak is shifted from the electrochemical potentials by @xmath50 below ( above ) the kondo peak in the spectral function for the lower ( upper ) level . in the other extreme of zero level separation </S>",
    "<S> we have a fourfold degenerate case , and the model corresponds approximately to a spin @xmath1 single - channel kondo model ( in the limit of low lying levels , furthermore transitions between all spin states are allowed in the present case ) . in this case </S>",
    "<S> the resulting spectral functions are equal to each other and have a much more pronounced kondo peak ( see the solid curve in fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fg : split ] ) than in the single level case .    </S>",
    "<S> the large resonant peak , seen when @xmath49 , can be viewed as two kondo peaks being on top of each other . when the degeneracy is lifted the peak splits into two , separated by @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> one peak remains pinned at zero since the spin - degeneracy of the levels continues to lead to a kondo peak . </S>",
    "<S> this result differs from the situation where the spin degeneracy of a single level is lifted by a magnetic field  @xcite . when the upper level is lifted far above the lower one the properties of the system approach those of a single - level dot thus exhibiting just one kondo peak .    </S>",
    "<S> the spectral functions are normalized . </S>",
    "<S> since we have neglected multiple occupancy , the normalization is @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the probabilities of an empty dot and that with single electron state @xmath57 occupied . </S>",
    "<S> this expression allows us to relate differences in the magnitudes of the spectral functions to differences in occupation probabilities , e.g. when the spectral functions corresponding to different levels are compared to each other .    </S>",
    "<S> the bias voltage has the effect of splitting all the resonant peaks in the spectral functions by @xmath58 , see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fg : a with ev ] . </S>",
    "<S> the peaked structure of the spectral functions is reflected in a novel structure in the nonlinear conductance , see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fg : conductance ] . instead of a single zero - bias peak , known from the single level dot </S>",
    "<S> , there appear now three sharp resonant peaks between the broad peaks corresponding to the renormalized energy levels . </S>",
    "<S> the zero - bias anomaly , characteristic for the single level case remains , but two additional satellite peaks appear at @xmath59 . when the level separation is increased the new peaks decrease in size while the peak at zero bias remains unchanged . </S>",
    "<S> when the levels lie above the electrochemical potentials , the nonlinear conductance exhibits a triplet of minima with one minimum at the electrochemical potentials and two satellites on each side . when the levels are on opposite sides of the electrochemical potentials the spectral functions as well as the conductance show very varied structures , which are not easily classified .    </S>",
    "<S> the systems considered here have not yet been investigated experimentally . </S>",
    "<S> ralph and buhrman have measured tunneling  enhanced by the kondo effect  through a localized state of an impurity equivalent to a single one - level dot . some unexplained features in their results </S>",
    "<S> may be due to the existence of the other levels above the electrochemical potentials . </S>",
    "<S> the model of a single- or two - level dot with only one electron in it could possibly be realized with the setup used by tarucha _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> they argue that they can resolve situations with one or few one spin - degenerate levels and one or few electrons in the dot . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , they report that a third electron inserted into the dot finds two spin - degenerate levels whose separation can be continuously varied by a magnetic field . in this system , </S>",
    "<S> if the gate voltage is fixed near the first or third conductance peak the single- or double - level dot is realized , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the difference should be observable in the nonlinear conductance provided that the zero - bias anomalies can be resolved . </S>",
    "<S> the relevant parameters reported in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite  the coupling strength ( tunneling rate ) @xmath60 , voltage , and temperature  are already close to those used in our calculations .    in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> we have described electronic transport through a two - level quantum dot and a single - level double dot coupled between reservoirs . </S>",
    "<S> a real - time diagrammatic technique provides a very general tool for the description of various systems , both in the perturbative and nonperturbative regime . </S>",
    "<S> we have found a novel triple - peak structure in the nonlinear conductance of these systems and suggest experiments where it is observable . </S>"
