    "single electrons can now be emitted into a coherent conductor using either a mesoscopic capacitor or designed voltage pulses .",
    "the mesoscopic capacitor@xcite emits a sequence of electrons and holes in response to an external ac modulation . by applying a train of lorentzian - shaped voltage pulses to an ohmic contact ,",
    "noiseless excitations can be created on top of the fermi sea in a mesoscopic conductor.@xcite these clean few - electron excitations were proposed by levitov and co - workers@xcite and have recently been named levitons following their experimental realization.@xcite    the combination of these achievements will surely lead to rich physics in the giga - hertz regime .",

    "the interferometer consists of two paths of lengths @xmath0 and @xmath1 which enclose a magnetic flux @xmath2 .",
    "two quantum point contacts @xmath3 and @xmath4 allow the single particle states to be delocalized over both paths leading to interference contributions in current and noise measured at the outputs . ]    in this work , we consider a mzi driven by a time - dependent voltage .",
    "motivated by the experimental realization of levitons , we focus on lorentzian - shaped voltage pulses and compare our results to a sinusoidal and a constant voltage.@xcite the current at the outputs depends on the shape of the applied voltages if we use a mzi with a path - length difference .",
    "such an asymmetric mzi constitutes an energy - dependent scatterer .",
    "in addition to the current visibility , we investigate the noise produced by the periodically driven mzi and find a contribution with no dc counterpart as predicted in ref .  .",
    "for the visibility of the current as well as the noise oscillations , we identify a lobe structure which contains information about the energy distribution of the electrons in a driven contact .",
    "we note that a similar lobe structure was measured as a function of the applied dc voltage.@xcite these observations are attributed to interactions within the same@xcite or with a neighboring edge channel.@xcite since the interactions depend on the number of electrons in the mzi but not on their energy distribution , we employ a noninteracting scattering approach@xcite at filling factor @xmath5 and focus on the effect of dephasing through a path - length difference .",

    "[ fig : mzi ] .",
    "it consists of a mzi in the quantum hall regime biased with a periodic voltage @xmath6 at contact @xmath7 .",
    "electrons injected from contacts @xmath7 and @xmath8 are partitioned into two chiral edge channels at qpc @xmath3 .",
    "the two edge channels enclose a magnetic flux @xmath2 and are repartitioned into contacts @xmath9 and @xmath10 at qpc @xmath4 .",
    "the qpcs are described by the scattering matrices @xmath11 with @xmath12 .",
    "the phases of the reflection and transmission amplitudes can be incorporated into a shift of the magnetic flux @xmath2 and are thus omitted .",
    "due to interference between the two paths , the current and noise measured at the outputs of the mzi oscillate as functions of @xmath2 .",
    "in addition to this energy - independent phase , we consider an energy - dependent phase due to a difference in the path lengths @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "we assume a linear dispersion relation @xmath13 with drift velocity @xmath14 in the energy window of interest .",
    "the path - length difference is then characterized by the time @xmath15 which we assume to be positive without loss of generality .",
    "in addition to an overall phase - shift , the energy - dependent phase reduces the visibility of the oscillations depending on how the states of the charge carriers are distributed in energy .",
    "one of the main objectives of this work is to relate the energy distribution induced by a train of voltage pulses to the visibility of the current and noise oscillations in the mzi .    to describe the driven contact , it is convenient to split the voltage in a time - independent dc part and a time dependent ac part@xcite @xmath16 a dc voltage can be incorporated by a shift in the chemical potential . to treat the ac voltage we resort to the floquet scattering matrix",
    "approach.@xcite we assume that the potential in contact @xmath7 is uniform and completely screened from the rest of the mzi .",
    "the voltage drop is assumed to be smooth on length - scales comparable to the fermi wavelength in order not to induce additional scattering.@xcite the solution to the time - dependent ( single - particle ) schrdinger equation in contact @xmath7 then reads @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a solution of the schrdinger equation for @xmath19 .",
    "we note that the lower limit in the last integral can be shifted by a global phase shift .",
    "it is assumed that the ac voltage varies on a time scale which is sufficiently slow , such that the distribution of the electronic states is not disturbed.@xcite although energy is no longer a good quantum number , the states @xmath20 are then distributed according to the fermi distribution corresponding to a dc bias .",

    "in contrast to the static case , a periodic voltage thus induces transport mediated by electrons and holes.@xcite    at zero temperature , the last equation shows that the filling in general will be constant over the energy range @xmath57 .",

    "shows that the visibility vanishes when @xmath97 .",
    "this is the case when @xmath87 is an integer multiple of @xmath98 . at zero temperature ,",
    "the filling is constant , and does not cross @xmath24 , over the energy intervals [ @xmath99 .",

    "interestingly , these zeroes persist even at finite temperatures due to the factorization of eq .  .    for single - charge pulses , the visibility at finite @xmath87 for a driven contact",
    "is reduced compared to the static case [ see eqs .   and and fig .",
    "[ fig : visibility]@xmath106 .",
    "we interpret this reduction in the coherence length as a result of the bunching of charge carriers within the pulses .",
    "the effect is most obvious for levitons , where @xmath41 electrons are localized within each pulse .",
    "apart from this reduction , the @xmath45 case shows similar visibilities for a driven and a static contact . for",
    "@xmath107 pulses [ see fig .",
    "[ fig : visibility]@xmath88 ] , the behavior for the driven mzi becomes strikingly different from the dc case . for small @xmath87",
    "we still observe a fast decay similar to the @xmath45 case . for larger",
    "@xmath87 , however , since three charges are emitted during one period , the visibility only goes to zero at the third zero of the dc visibility .",
    "thus , the visibility for pulsed voltages can actually be higher than the dc visibility [ cf .",
    "figure [ fig : visibility]@xmath88 furthermore shows that the visibility for lorentzian pulses of width @xmath109 is strictly smaller than the visibility for @xmath110 .",
    "since the limit @xmath111 corresponds to the dc case , this implies that the visibility has a non - monotonic dependence on the pulse width for certain regions of @xmath87 .",
    "the same features can be seen for fractional pulses . in general , for @xmath96 , the visibility goes to zero if @xmath87 is an integer multiple of @xmath98 in the driven case and of @xmath112 for a constant voltage .",
    "however , for @xmath113 , also the points @xmath114 for arbitrary @xmath104 are special . from eq .",
    "we find that the visibility is universal and only depends on the pulse charge at these universality points @xmath115 the universality points are marked by circles in figs .  [ fig : visibility]@xmath116 and @xmath117 .",
    "as @xmath41 becomes smaller , they become denser and the visibility becomes increasingly independent of the pulse shape .",
    "the points of universality can again be explained by the filling .",
    "since the filling shows steps of width @xmath57 , one can again find pairs of particles which have a phase difference of @xmath102 for all steps except the one that crosses @xmath24 .",
    "since holes acquire an additional minus sign because of their charge , they add up constructively with the electrons which are @xmath118 away in energy .",
    "the number of remaining particles which contribute to the interference is independent of the step height because the contributions from electrons and holes are summed up .",
    "they give rise to the same visibility as the constant voltage @xmath62 which leads to the universality expressed in eq .  .",
    "it is interesting to note that the interference current becomes time - independent at the universality points ( not shown ) .    to summarize this section",
    ", we find a visibility which strongly depends on the applied voltage and differs significantly from the static case for @xmath119 .",
    "all the features can be explained by the filling of the driven contact .",
    "we now turn to the zero - frequency cross correlator between the currents in contacts @xmath9 and @xmath10 @xmath120 where @xmath121 is the anti - commutator and @xmath122 . in our four - terminal setup , where there is no direct transmission between contacts @xmath9 and @xmath10 , thermal equilibrium fluctuations do not contribute to the cross - correlator.@xcite the zero frequency noise arises due to partial occupation of the outgoing states . within the scattering matrix approach ,",
    "the outgoing states are mapped onto incoming states via the scattering matrix .",
    "partial occupation of outgoing states then translates into pairs of incoming states with different fillings which feed into the same outgoing state . for each term in the noise , there are thus two incoming states involved . in our setup , this has two consequences .",
    "first , as described in ref .  , the two states can either originate from two different contacts or from the same contact .",
    "the former contribution to the noise will be called transport noise , the latter interference noise ( not to be confused with the @xmath2-dependent part of the noise ) @xmath123 when the two states originate from the same contact , they have to originate from different energies . to end up in the same outgoing state , the charge carriers need to gain or lose energy provided by the ac voltage .",
    "the interference noise thus vanishes in the dc case .",
    "the second consequence is due to the fact that each of the two involved states can enclose the flux @xmath2 .",
    "the noise thus consists of a constant part ( no particles enclose the flux ) , a part which oscillates as a function of @xmath2 with period @xmath124 ( one particle encloses the flux ) and a part which oscillates with period @xmath102 ( both particles enclose the flux)@xcite @xmath125 note that the decompositions of the noise defined in eqs .   and",

    "the ratio @xmath150 has its maximum , equal to unity , for @xmath151 and monotonically decreases away from that point .",
    "the noise visibilities are plotted in figs .",
    "[ fig : visibilitynoise1 ] and [ fig : visibilitynoise2 ] for different pulse shapes and charges at zero and finite temperature .",
    "we find a qualitatively similar behavior to the current visibility .",
    "the noise visibilities show oscillations as a function of @xmath87 which fall of as @xmath95 . furthermore , narrower pulses as well as increasing temperatures generally lower the noise visibilities . at zero temperature",
    ", @xmath152 goes to zero if the path - length difference @xmath87 is an integer multiple of @xmath98 in the driven and @xmath112 in the static case ( where the charge of the current pulses is @xmath96 ) .",
    "analogous to the current visibility , this can be explained with the filling of the driven contact .",
    "since @xmath153 oscillates at twice the frequency , it behaves similarly as a function of @xmath154 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : visibilitynoise2 ] .",
    "in contrast to the current visibility , the temperature dependence of the noise visibilities does not factor out and the period of the oscillations ( and thus the zeroes ) depends on temperature as can be seen clearly in panels [ fig : visibilitynoise1]@xmath155 , @xmath88 and [ fig : visibilitynoise2]@xmath155 , @xmath88 . as a consequence ,",
    "a finite temperature can increase the visibilities for certain regions of @xmath87 . since the visibilities vanish at infinite temperature [ cf .",
    "( [ eq : noisetr4 ] ,  [ eq : noisevisibilities ] ) ] , this implies a non - monotonic dependence on temperature .",
    "also , both @xmath153 and @xmath152 for fractional pulses show additional features which arise due to the interference noise . in the insets of panels [ fig : visibilitynoise1]@xmath116 and [",
    "fig : visibilitynoise2]@xmath155 , we show the visibilities that arise solely from the transport noise which lack the additional features . for @xmath152 ,",
    "the interference noise only influences @xmath156 [ cf .",
    "since @xmath157 vanishes if @xmath87 is an integer multiple of @xmath66 , @xmath156 exhibits local minima at these points which leads to peaks in the visibility .",
    "these can be seen in panels [ fig : visibilitynoise1]@xmath116 and @xmath117 , where the visibility is finite at these points due to the fractional character of the pulses .",
    "the features in @xmath153 depend on the @xmath157 in a more complicated way and also arise for integer charge pulses .",
    "the noise visibilities thus clearly show signatures of the interference noise in a driven , energy - dependent mzi .",
    "we have investigated the current and the noise in a mzi with a path - length difference , driven by periodic voltage pulses . whereas the current can be expressed by the scattering matrix of the static mzi and the filling of the driven contact",
    ", the noise also depends on the coherences of the driven contact .",
    "all the visibilities show a lobe structure which falls off as the inverse path - length difference .",
    "quite generally , the visibilities of the current and noise oscillations decay faster with the path - length difference for narrower pulses .",
    "we interpret this as a result of a reduction in the delocalization of the electronic wavefunctions .",
    "the zeroes of the lobe structure can be explained with the filling of the driven contact and occur whenever the interference of each charge carrier is canceled by another charge carrier which picks up an additional minus sign due to the energy dependence of the mzi . because the temperature dependence factorizes out for the current visibility , these zeroes remain robust at finite temperatures .",
    "this is not the case for the noise visibilities .",
    "the fact that the zeroes have their origin in an exact cancellation of the interference effect of different particles can lead to a non - monotonic behavior .",
    "for the current visibility , this occurs as a function of the width of the lorentzian voltage pulses and for the noise visibilities as a function of temperature .",
    "additionally , the visibilities strongly depend on the charge of the voltage pulses and can behave remarkably different in the driven and the static case . for a charge @xmath96 , the visibilities go to zero at a path - length difference which is an integer multiple of @xmath98 for the driven and @xmath112 for the static case ( or twice as often for @xmath153 ) . for fractional charges ,",
    "we find a universal behavior in the current visibility for a path - length difference which is an integer multiple of @xmath66 .",
    "this can be explained similarly to the visibility zeroes . at the points of universality , pairing up particles which contribute to the current oscillations with an opposite sign",
    "may leave unpaired electrons and holes .",
    "the remaining charge carriers lead to a visibility that is independent of the voltage shape .",
    "such a universality is absent in the noise , because there electrons and holes contribute equally .    for time - dependent transport and energy - dependent scattering",
    ", the noise has an additional contribution with no dc counterpart due to processes where both involved states originate from the same ( driven ) contact.@xcite we found that this notably modulates the visibility @xmath152 for fractional pulses and @xmath153 for all charge values .",
    "we note that our setup can be used to implement the proposal of ref .  , where a constant scattering phase is applied to one of the ( grounded ) inputs of a mzi for a finite time .",
    "this scattering phase , which naturally occurs between well separated lorentzian pulses of non - integer charge , is envisioned as a carrier of quantum information .    in summary",
    ", we have shown that the visibilities of the current and noise oscillations in a driven mzi make it possible to address different aspects of coherent time - dependent transport .",
    "we hope our work may stimulate experiments in this direction .",
    "this work is dedicated to markus bttiker who suggested the problem .",
    "we thank f. battista for pointing out the advantages of separating the voltage in dc and ac components and we acknowledge fruitful discussions with p. roulleau , d. c. glattli , g. haack , d. dasenbrook , p. samuelsson , d. ferraro , m. moskalets and e. v. sukhorukov .",
