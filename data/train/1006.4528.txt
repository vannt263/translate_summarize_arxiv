    "surface plasmon polaritons ( spps ) can modulate light waves at the metal - dielectric interface with wavelength much smaller than that in free space@xcite , which enables the control of light in a subwavelength scale for nanophotonic devices@xcite .",
    "spps with large coherent length are useful in many areas , including optical processing , quantum information@xcite and novel light - matter interactions@xcite .",
    "the enhancement of local fields by spps is particularly important as it opens a new route to absorption enhancement@xcite , nonlinear optical amplification@xcite as well as weak signal probing@xcite .",
    "as the properties of spp are pretty much determined by the natural ( plasmon ) resonance frequency , there is not much room for us to adjust the spp response for practical applications .",
    "with induced surface current oscillations on an array of metallic building blocks@xcite , metamaterial surfaces can manipulate electromagnetic waves in a similar way as spps .",
    "such spps or surface resonance states on structured metallic surfaces are tunable by geometric parameters .    in this paper",
    ", we examine the properties of surface resonance states at a dielectric - metamaterial interface that exhibit magnetic response to the incident waves and strong local field enhancement .",
    "we will see that these surface resonance states can give highly directional absorptivity and emissivity , and may thus help to realize interesting effects such as spatially coherent thermal emission .",
    "as the structure is very simple , it can be fabricated down to the ir and optical regime@xcite .",
    "we will show that a thin metamaterial slab , with a thickness much smaller than the operational wavelength , supports delocalized magnetic surface resonance states with a long coherent length in a wide range of frequencies .",
    "operating in a broad frequency range , these spatially coherent spps are surface resonance states with quasi - tem modes guided in the dielectric layer that are weakly coupled to free space , and the coupling strength can be controlled by tuning structural parameters while the frequency can be controlled by varying structural and material parameters .",
    "the high fidelity of these surface resonance states results in directional absorptivity or emissivity , which is angle - dependent with respect to frequency .",
    "finite - difference - in - time - domain ( fdtd ) simulations verify that the highly directional emissivity from the slab persists in the presence of structural disorder in the grating layer .",
    "such metal - dielectric - metal ( mdm ) structures were recognized as artificial magnetic surfaces with high impedance by the end of last century@xcite , the magnetic response were described with an effective permeability in lorentz type@xcite .",
    "after the concept of metamaterial being proposed@xcite , p. alastair and his co - workers numerically and experimentally proved that the ultra - thin mdm structures can resonantly absorb or transmit radiations at low frequency limit[22 ] .",
    "they addressed that the central frequencies of absorption peaks are independent from the incident angle with an interpretation of farby - perrot resonant mode ( eq . 1 in ref . 22 ) .",
    "the same group further explored the angle - independent absorption , as the main scenario of the incremental work , by measuring the flat bands of surface wave dispersion in the visible@xcite as well as the microwave region@xcite .",
    "in contrast , we find that the structure with proper design also supports very narrow absorption peaks which are sensitive to the incident angle and obviously do not satisfy to the fabry - perot resonance condition suggested in the previous studies .",
    "it is worth noting that the physics origin of an angle - independent peak is quite different from that of angle - dependent ones .",
    "the former , investigated in refs .",
    "22 - 24 , mainly comes from the localized surface resonance states , while the latter , found by us , comes from collective surface resonance states .",
    "an intuitive picture is as follows : high order quasi - tem modes induced inside the dielectric layer can assign phase correlation to the outgoing waves emitted from the air slits of grating , thus are very crucial to the formation of collective response .",
    "weak enough both the leakage from dielectric layer to air slits and the material absorption , the spatial coherence of surface resonance states will survive .",
    "as the interaction between the structure and the incident waves will excite quasi - tem modes inside the dielectric layer , the magnetic induction must be parallel to the mdm surfaces if it exists .",
    "thus a surface resonance state on a mdm structure is usually magnetic in nature .",
    "our findings about spatially coherent surface resonance states are original compared to the common knowledge , and have great potentials in coherent control of spps as well as thermal emission radiations .",
    "our model system is schematically illustrated in fig .",
    "1 . lying on the @xmath0 plane , the slab comprises an upper layer of a metallic lamellar grating with thickness @xmath1 , a dielectric spacer layer as a slab waveguide with thickness @xmath2 and a metallic ground plane .",
    "the metallic strips are separated by a small air gap @xmath3 , giving rise to a period of @xmath4 for the lamellar grating .",
    "each metallic strip together with the ground plane beneath it constitutes a planar resonant cavity as the building block that gives magnetic responses at cavity resonances@xcite .",
    "the metallic grating is along the @xmath5 direction so that the guided waves in the dielectric layer ( at @xmath6 in region iii ) can only couple with the transverse magnetic ( @xmath7 polarized wave ( with the electric field@xmath8 in @xmath9 plane ) in the free semi - space ( at @xmath10 in region i ) .",

    "the spectra exhibit a low and broad peak at @xmath58thz which is almost independent of the incident angle , while the other absorption peaks at higher frequencies are narrow and sensitive to the incident angle with a maximum absorption approaching 100% .",
    "the slab thus acts as an all - angle absorber at @xmath58thz ( a similar result can be found in ref .",
    "31 ) , but exhibits sharp angle - selective absorption peaks at higher frequencies . shown as solid and dashed lines in fig .",
    "2(b ) , the sharp angular dependence of absorption coefficients ( note that the vertical axis is in log - scale ) at @xmath59thz and 54.3thz implicitly implies the existence of spatially coherent surface resonance states .",

    "this presents a way to realize nearly perfect absorption with weakly absorptive materials by coherent surface resonance states .",
    "the coherent length of a surface resonance state can be estimated by the ratio of the wavelength @xmath60 and the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) @xmath61 of the absorption peak@xcite .",
    "for example , for the @xmath62 state at 54.3thz and @xmath63 , the angular fwhm of the corresponding absorption peak @xmath64(from @xmath65to @xmath66 gives rise to a coherent length @xmath67 .",

    "the @xmath75 surface resonance states lie blow the light line @xmath76 ( magenta dashed line ) , and thus are non - radiative as evanescent modes .",
    "the surface resonances labeled as @xmath77 originate from the coupling of the fundamental magnetic resonance modes of the metal strip structure with the free space light line @xmath76 .",
    "the surface resonances @xmath78 and @xmath79 are harmonic modes of the magnetic resonances that hybridizes with the guided mode inside the dielectric layer .",

    "figure 5 also indicates that the enhancement of local field of an excited @xmath78 or @xmath79  state can be ten times larger than that of an excited @xmath77 state ; the enhancement factor at 50.22thz is about 100 , while it is only 10 at 13.2thz .",
    "we see from fig .",
    "3(a ) that the surface resonance dispersion of the slab comes from the interaction between the magnetic resonances and the ( folded ) light lines @xmath97 ( for dielectrics ) and @xmath76 ( for air ) grazing on the interfaces . in the limit of a small gap - period ratio ( @xmath98 for example ) , our system is weakly bragg - scattered , and as such , when a surface resonance state on branches @xmath78 or @xmath79 is excited , the induced wave fields inside the dielectric of region iii are guided quasi - tem modes dominated by @xmath99 bloch orders . for that reason ,",
    "the @xmath78 and @xmath79 states have high fidelity even though they are leaky modes , as most of their bloch wavefunction components lying outside the free space light line . as the air gaps of the metallic grating serve to couple the electromagnetic waves of region i and region iii , the quality factor of a resonance state can be estimated with the overlap integral between the fundamental waveguide mode @xmath100 in the air gap and the dominant bloch waves @xmath101",

    "it also explains why the state @xmath83 , a state precisely superposing on folded light line @xmath115 in dielectric layer , is dark to the incident plane wave as @xmath116 .",
    "different from @xmath78 and @xmath79 states , the @xmath77 states have a major fourier component in @xmath95 order which directly couples to the free space photons . as a consequence , the @xmath77 states , forming a flat band far away from the light line @xmath76 when @xmath117 is small , are localized with resonant frequency scaled by local geometry of unit cell .",
    "the high model fidelity of a @xmath78 or @xmath79 state also gives rise to much more intense local field compared to the @xmath77 states .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "5 , the induced local field is 100 times stronger than the incident field for the state on @xmath78 ; while it is only 10 times stronger for @xmath82 , and this is consistent with the absorptivity shown in fig .",
    "in addition , the coherent length can be adjusted by the gap width as the kernel @xmath118 is proportional to the gap - period ratio @xmath72 .",
    "more calculations demonstrate that the angular fwhm of the absorption peak is reduced from @xmath119 to @xmath120 when the gap is decreased from @xmath121 m to @xmath122 m , corresponding to a coherent length of @xmath123 .",
