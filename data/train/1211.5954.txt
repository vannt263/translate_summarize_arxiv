    "the numerical treatment of partial differential equations with rapidly varying and strongly heterogeneous coefficient functions is still a challenging area of present research , especially with regard to applications such as porous media flow or the transport of solutes in groundwater . in such problems ,",
    "the occurring permeabilities and hydraulic conductivities have rapidly changing features due to different types of soil , microscopic inclusions in the bottom or porous subsurface rock formations .",
    "any meaningful numerical simulation of relevant physical effects has to account for these highly heterogeneous fine scale structures in the whole computational domain .",
    "this means that the underlying computational mesh has to be sufficiently fine to resolve microscopic details .",
    "if pore scale effects become relevant or if domains spread over kilometers , therefore , the computational load becomes extremely large and in several applications even too large to treat the problem with standard finite element or finite volume methods .",
    "this is just one instance of a so called multiscale problem as it arises in hydrology , physics or industrial engineering .    in recent years",
    ", many numerical methods have been designed to deal with these computational issues that come along with multiscale problems .",
    "most of them aim to decouple the global fine scale problem into localized subproblems which can be treated independently from each other plus some global coarse problem .",
    "the list of meanwhile proposed multiscale methods is long . amongst the most popular methods are the heterogeneous multiscale finite element method ( hmm ) , initially introduced by e and engquist @xcite",
    "( see also @xcite , the variational multiscale method by hughes et al .",
    "@xcite ( see also @xcite ) or the approaches by owhadi and zhang @xcite .    in this paper , we deal with another popular method : the multiscale finite element method ( msfem ) proposed by hou and wu @xcite and further investigated in several contributions @xcite .",
    "there is an ongoing development of the method to apply it to various fields and equations .",
    "for instance , a msfem for nonlinear elliptic problems is proposed in @xcite , a formulation for two phase flow problems in porous media is presented in @xcite , advection diffusion problems are treated in @xcite and an application to elliptic interface problems with high contrast coefficients is presented in @xcite . a survey on the method",
    "is given in the book by efendiev and hou @xcite .",
    "there is vast literature of works devoted to the method but there are still open questions of strong interest . the most relevant issue is a rigorous error analysis of the method , in particular in the case of non - periodic microstructures .    the msfem is related to some common finite element space with an underlying coarse grid .",
    "the essential idea is to modify the corresponding basis functions in such a way that fine scale variations on finer scales are sufficiently well captured .",
    "more specifically , local fine scale computations are performed to determine so called _",
    "corrector functions_. these corrector functions can be added as local perturbations to the original set of basis functions of the coarse finite element space .    however , it is well known that the classical msfem suffers from so called resonance errors , which are typically of order @xmath0 , where @xmath1 denotes a characteristic size of the small scale and where @xmath2 denotes the mesh size of the coarse grid ( c.f .",
    "this implies that the numerical error becomes large in regions where the coarse grid size is close to the characteristic length scale of the microscopic oscillations .",
    "there are two different explanations for this error .",
    "the first one is a mismatch between the boundary conditions imposed for the local fine scale problems and global behavior of the oscillatory exact solution ( c.f @xcite ) .",
    "the second explanation is due to size and geometry of the sampling patch ( c.f .",
    "the averaged behavior in such a patch should be representative so that we can speak about a perfect sample size .",
    "if this is not the case , the final approximation might be distorted . in the periodic",
    "setting , for instance , the sampling domain should be some multiple of the periodic cell . on triangular patches with cathetuses of the length of a period ,",
    "this patch is only half a periodic cell ( i.e. the patch has bad size and geometry ) and lacks essential information .",
    "this yields a completely wrong approximation ( c.f .",
    "@xcite ) . in the periodic setting considerable improvements",
    "were obtained by gloria @xcite , who proposed a regularization of the local ( patch ) problems by adding a zero - order term . with this strategy ,",
    "both sources of the oversampling error could be significantly reduced ( c.f .",
    "* theorem 3.1 ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sections 5.3 and 5.4 ) .    in a lot of applications , such as oil reservoir simulations or the transport of solutes in groundwater ,",
    "a characteristic microscopic length scale @xmath1 is unknown , can not be identified or does not exist at all . in scenarios without a clear scale separation",
    "it is often impossible to predict whether or not we are in the regime of resonance errors .",
    "it is very likely to actually hit the problematic regime .",
    "hence , the quality of the final approximation can not be determined unless resonance errors are eliminated . for this purpose ,",
    "different _ oversampling strategies _ have been proposed .",
    "the fundamental idea of each of these techniques is to extend the local problems to larger patches , perform the computation on these _ oversampling domains _ but feed the coarse scale equation only with the information obtained within the original smaller patches .",
    "this reduces the effect of wrong boundary conditions and bad sampling sizes . in this paper",
    ", we present the two major strategies for oversampling and discuss their advantages and disadvantages . on the basis of these considerations",
    "we propose a new strategy that overcomes the issues of the existing strategies . the new approach is closely related to the vmm - type method presented in @xcite .",
    "we prove quantitative error estimates for the corresponding multiscale approximations under very general assumptions on the diffusion coefficient .",

    "the results are presented in subsection [ subsection - new - strategy ] and a corresponding proof is given in subsection [ subsection - proof - main - result ] .",

    "the operator is linear , surjective , bounded , and invertible on the finite element space @xmath58 .",
    "hence , the decomposition exists and is stable ; it is even orthogonal in @xmath235 .",
    "recall the ( local ) approximation and stability properties of the interpolation operators @xmath230 @xcite : there exists a generic constant @xmath236 such that for all @xmath231 and for all @xmath237 it holds @xmath238 where @xmath239 .",
    "the constant @xmath236 depends on the shape regularity of the finite element mesh @xmath16 but not on the local mesh size @xmath240 .",

    "since this constant enters basically all error estimates below , we would end up with an @xmath14-dependence of the multiplicative constants in the final error estimates . in 2d",
    "this can still be acceptable because the dependence on @xmath14 is only logarithmic .    with the decomposition we do not search the local correctors in the full fine scale space @xmath27 , but only in the constrained space @xmath227 .",
    "the advantage is the following : as stated in the previous section for oversampling strategy 1 and 2 , the standard decay for the difference between the local correctors and the global exact corrector is of order @xmath203 ( see theorem [ hou : wu : zhang:2004-theorem ] ) , but in the constrained space @xmath227 we can achieve an exponential - type decay ( cf .",

    "we obtain the classical msfem for @xmath182 .",
    "this is only a subtle detail and all results still remain valid for these modified local spaces , however , this version would generate some technicalities in the proofs later on , which is why we decided to work with the definition ( [ localspacedefos3 ] ) .",
    "the crucial differences between the classical strategies 1 , 2 and oversampling strategy 3 are the following :    * the variational problem for the local corrector in oversampling strategy 3 is posed in the constrained space @xmath256 whereas the classical corrector problem seeks the local corrector in the full space @xmath257 restricted to the patch . *",
    "the support of the integrals on the right hand side in ( [ corrector - os1 ] ) and ( [ corrector - os2 ] ) is @xmath92 . in our new version",
    "we use only the element @xmath38 .",
    "this allows us to exploit nice summation properties of the local projectors , without using indicator functions @xmath43 that lead to discontinuities . * in the classical setting , the local correctors are restricted to the corresponding elements to derive the global corrector . for oversampling strategy 3 , we simply sum up ( weighted by the coefficients of the finite element function ) the local contributions to get the global corrector .",
    "note that our global corrector is conforming in the sense that its image is a subset of @xmath258 whereas the classical setup leads to a non - conforming corrector . * in strategy 3 , we do not use a petrov - galerkin formulation for the global problem ( [ e : msvmmsym ] ) .",
    "since @xmath15 is assumed symmetric , a symmetric discretization appears more natural .",
    "furthermore , we immediately inherit coercivity for the global bilinear form @xmath259 .",
    "this gives us existence and uniqueness of @xmath260 and the arising msfem approximation is well posed and the method stable .",
    "the typical disadvantage of the symmetric version which still suffers from resonance errors ( which is why petrov - galerkin is typically preferred ) does not remain for our strategy .",
    "* in contrast to oversampling strategy 1 and 2 , the corrector @xmath261 does not preserve the support of @xmath262 .",

    "at least , this seems to be likely .",
    "the reason is that theorem [ gloria - theorem ] in particular covers the case without oversampling ( see also @xcite ) and the proof given in @xcite goes back to the arguments used for the case without oversampling .",
    "but for @xmath268 ( no oversampling ) , strategies 1 and 2 are identical , and strategy 3 is at least close to the classical approach . especially concerning strategy 3 : if the thickness of the oversampling layer decreases faster than the coarse mesh size , we are almost in the case of oversampling strategy 1 , up to a small perturbation of the source term that is of order @xmath269 and that converges to zero under the assumptions of theorem [ gloria - theorem ] .",
