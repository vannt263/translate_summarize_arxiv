    "dynamical properties of dense polymer systems like melts or dense solutions often are analyzed within the framework of the reptation model @xcite .",
    "reptation is a specific mechanism for the motion of a single tagged chain through an environment of other chains .",
    "it is based on the idea that the background chains act as impenetrable obstacles which confine the motion of the tagged chain to a tube roughly defined by its present configuration .",
    "the local motion of the inner parts of the chain is restricted to the diffusion of little wiggles of spared length along the tube . globally",
    "the motion is driven by the chain ends , where wiggles are created or destroyed .",
    "creation of a wiggle shortens the tube by its spared length , destruction prolongs the tube in some randomly choosen direction . in the long run",
    "this motion of the chain ends leads to the complete destruction of the original tube and to large scale diffusion of the chain .",
    "formulated in more precise terms , the reptation model deals with the stochastic motion of a flexible chain embedded in a fixed environment of obstacles which form the edges of a regular lattice in three dimensional space . in this work we present results for the coherent structure function measured in an extensive simulation of this model .",
    "the measured coherent structure functions of the total chain and of internal subchains are compared to the results of our recent analytical evaluation @xcite of the model . for the total chain there",
    "exist previous approximate theories based on reptation @xcite , which are included in the comparison .",
    "these theories do not treat the full dynamics of the model , but neglect so called ` tube length fluctuations ' . for typical chain lengths used in ( computer- or physical- )",
    "experiments these fluctuations are known to yield important contributions , as has first been pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite in the context of an analysis of the viscosity .",
    "as mentioned above , results of the reptation model generally are used to analyze data for systems like polymer melts @xcite , where the surrounding of a given chain certainly is far from forming an ordered time independent lattice of obstacles .",
    "clearly the surrounding chains slowly move away , which leads to ` constraint release ' @xcite , an effect that becomes important @xcite outside the limit of asymptotically long chains .",
    "also disorder in the distribution of obstacles might lead to fluctuations in the local tube diameter , thus affecting the local mobility of spared length . in this work",
    "we omit all such effects of the environment and study the coherent structure function of the pure reptation model , as described above .",
    "this is a necessary prerequisite for an analysis aiming at the separation of the different effects present in a real melt .    to illustrate the problem we now briefly recall some typical results @xcite of reptation , as established for very long chains .",
    "we concentrate on the motion of an internal segment , which from a theoretical point of view is the simplest quantity to discuss .",
    "simple as it is , the reptation scenario involves several time scales and leads to a rich phenomenology .",
    "it needs a microscopic time @xmath7 before the chain feels the existence of constraints due to its surrounding .",
    "generally @xmath7 is taken as the rouse time of a short subchain of @xmath8 segments : @xmath9 , where the entanglement length @xmath8 is choosen such that the coil diameter of the subchain is of the order of the diameter of the tube , which substitutes the surrounding chains .",
    "the second time scale @xmath10 is the relaxation time of the total chain in a fixed tube , i.e. the time a wiggle needs to diffuse over the whole chain .",
    "it depends on chain length @xmath11 as @xmath12 and thus behaves as the relaxation time of a free chain in the rouse model .",
    "the longest scale @xmath13 is the reptation time. it measures the time which the motion of the chain ends needs to completely destroy the initial tube . in the limit of long chains",
    "the reptation model predicts @xcite @xmath14 .    for observables like the motion of individual segments the model yields asymptotic power laws , where the exponent depends on the time range .",
    "we here quote the results for the motion of the central segment @xmath15 : @xmath16    we use the bar to denote the dynamic average , i.e. the average over the motion of spared length .",
    "the pointed brackets stand for the average over all initial configurations .",
    "considerable effort has been invested to check these predictions in simulations of melts , but the outcome to date is not conclusive @xcite . the @xmath17-regime has never been properly identified .",
    "( note that crossover from a region @xmath18 , to free diffusion easily can pretend the existence of a @xmath17-regime .",
    "what has to be demonstrated is the stability of this regime for a larger range of time and chain lengths . )",
    "slowing down of segment motion in the range @xmath19 is observed @xcite , with an effective exponent somewhere between 1/4 and 1/2 . only for some",
    "related observable , measuring the motion of a central segment relative to the center of mass , a @xmath20-behavior seems to be established @xcite .",
    "real experiments do not measure @xmath21 .",
    "however , a related quantity , the return - to - origin probability of a segment averaged over all segments , is measured in nmr - experiments . here",
    "the equivalent to @xmath20-behavior has been found in ref .",
    "@xcite , but ref .",
    "@xcite reports equivalent results only for motion through a crosslinked gel , where constraint release is suppressed .",
    "the corresponding melt shows quite different behavior .    invoking tube length fluctuations and constraint release we qualitatively may interpret the observed deviations from the asymptotic reptation results as crossover behavior outside the region of asymptotic chain lengths .",
    "however , there exist other theories of melt dynamics , which are not based on the tube concept and describe many experiments as well @xcite .",
    "( see also the review @xcite . )",
    "it thus is conceivable that the basic assumptions of the reptation scenario do not hold . to get more insight into these problems",
    ", we clearly have to quantitatively evaluate the consequences of the pure reptation model , beyond asymptotic power laws .",
    "in previous analytical work @xcite we determined the motion of individual segments of the chain . since our theory involves some approximations , we compared the results to simulations @xcite of the evans - edwards model @xcite , which is an accurate implementation of the pure reptation model .",
    "in essence , both theory and simulations agreed in showing that the crossover among various asymptotic power law regions is very slow .",
    "the crossover regions are so broad that the asymptotic power laws can be identified only for very long chains .",
    "for example , using the evans - edwards model with the smallest possible tube diameter we could identify the @xmath20-law for the motion of the central segment only for chain lengths @xmath22 .",
    "this law is the easiest to observe , and our evaluation of the theory predicts that other asymptotic laws unambiguously can be identified only for much longer chains .",
    "this result is in line with the known slow crossover behavior of the reptation time @xcite , which is predicted to reach the asymptotic law @xmath6 only for chain lengths far beyond present day experimental feasibilities .",
    "still , for the motion of individual segments , the full crossover functions can be calculated , and our analytical results very well agree with our simulations .",
    "furthermore , for shorter chains all our analytical and simulational results qualitatively are very similar to results of simulations of melts @xcite . in later work @xcite we considered chain motion in a time",
    "independent , but disordered environment , where the disorder affects only the chain mobility but leaves the equilibrium distribution of chain configurations unchanged .",
    "we found that with such kinematic disorder reptation prevails , an observation which recently has been supported @xcite by rigorous bounds on the diffusion coefficient . since such kinematic disorder certainly is present in a melt , these results again support reptation as adequate theory of melt dynamics .",
    "in contrast to the motion of individual segments the coherent structure function @xmath23 : scattering vector , @xmath24 : time ) , is well accessible in real experiments .",
    "it can be measured , for instance , by neutron scattering from a mixture of deuterated and hydrogenated chains .",
    "as mentioned above , approximate asymptotic forms for @xmath25 , based on reptation type theories , can be found in the literature @xcite . however , as for the motion of individual segments we can evaluate the full reptation theory for @xmath25 also outside the asymptotic regime . as for individual segments , we then expect to see important preasymptotic or crossover effects .",
    "the evaluation of @xmath25 including full reptational dynamics is somewhat complicated , and our theory in detail has been presented in ref .",
    "here we compare the results to simulations of the evans - edwards model .",
    "we consider both the scattering from the total chain and from interior subchains .",
    "the latter is important to estimate the reliability of the theory , which can treat end - effects only in some approximation .    in section 2",
    "we discuss our simulations .",
    "section 3 is devoted to a comparison with the expressions for @xmath25 given by doi and edwards @xcite or by de gennes @xcite , respectively . in section 4",
    "we qualitatively describe our theory and give an empirical fit formula which reasonably well describes our quantitative results .",
    "the comparison between our theory and our monte carlo data is presented in sect .",
    "section 6 contains our conclusions .",
    "a very simple model for simulating reptation has been introduced by evans and edwards @xcite .",
    "the configuration @xmath26 of the chain is taken as a random walk of @xmath27 steps @xmath28 on a cubic lattice .",
    "the lattice spacing @xmath29 henceforth defines the unit of length .",
    "the obstacles are taken as the edges of the dual lattice . in the interior of the chain ,",
    "the obstacles suppress any motion except for the motion of ` hairpins ' , i.e. , configurations of three subsequent beads of type @xmath30 . in an elementary move the tip @xmath31 of the hairpin with equal probability hops to any of the six neighbors of the site @xmath32 .",
    "the chain ends @xmath33 are free to hop between all neighbors of @xmath34 , respectively .",
    "1 shows a sequence of internal configurations resulting from this dynamics . in our simulations we used the same implementation of the model as in our previous work @xcite , and we measured the coherent structure function defined as @xmath35 where @xmath36 ( the imaginary part @xmath37 of @xmath38 is zero on average , of course . ) to get more information on the internal motion , we also measured the coherent structure function @xmath39 of the central subchain of length @xmath40 , defined by restricting the summations in eqs .",

    "( see sect .",
    "4.b ) , this yields values @xmath45 .",
    "similar values are extracted from many simulations or experiments on melts , so that our results should be relevant also for the interpretation of such data .",
    "monte carlo time @xmath46 is measured in units of one attempted move per bead on average .",
    "we performed runs up to @xmath47 , and we measured the structure function up to @xmath48 using a moving time average .      during a run , the longer chains do not diffuse very far , and data of a single run therefore are strongly correlated .",
    "to get reasonably accurate results we have to average over many independent runs . a priori",
    ", this poses a problem for larger momenta , @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the radius of gyration of the chain .",
    "it is easily checked that the reduced width of the distribution of the static structure function with increasing @xmath51 rapidly tends to @xmath52 .",
    "indeed , in the limit @xmath53 fixed , the distribution of @xmath54 approaches the exponential distribution .",
    "this suggests that @xmath55 runs are needed to reduce the statistical uncertainty to a few percent .",
    "this would pose no problems , if we just were interested in static properties .",
    "however , for the longer chains a single run extending to times well beyond the reptation time takes several hours on a standard work station . in measuring _",
    "dynamic _ quantities the number of runs therefore inevitably is much smaller than needed for a precise determination of _ static _ quantities .",
    "fortunately it turns out that the dynamics essentially is decoupled from the static configuration .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .  2 , which shows results for @xmath56 , normalized to the exact static structure function @xmath57 of the model , which easily is calculated analytically ( see sect .",
    "each curve in fig .  2",
    "a is averaged over @xmath58 independent short runs @xmath59 , including the moving time average for each run .",
    "clearly the scatter of @xmath54 is consistent with the above discussion . it is larger than the temporal variation of the curves .",
    "however , plotting in fig .",
    "2  b the normalized time dependence @xmath60/s_{0}(q , n)$ ] , we find that all curves nearly coincide .",
    "the global dynamics measured by the structure function , is not correlated with the static configuration , an observation which supports one of the basic assumptions of the reptation model .",
    "the reason behind that observation is easily understood .",
    "the mobility of the chain is governed by the number of hairpins which essentially is gaussian distributed and fluctuates much less than the static structure function . furthermore , except for rare events , viz . extremely stretched or extremely compact configurations ,",
    "the number of hairpins is independent of the overall ( tube- ) conformation of the chain . with this insight",
    ", we take as basic data the difference @xmath61 for each run .",
    "the error bars in our plots give twice the standard deviation of this difference .",
    "we always plot the normalized dynamic structure function defined as @xmath62 where @xmath57 is the exact static structure function , not the measured average value of @xmath54 .",
    "depending on the number of independent runs , these two quantities differ by @xmath63 .    for reasons of computer memory",
    ", we performed runs with three different values of the maximal time @xmath64 . to observe the small initial effects we for each value of chain length @xmath11 and wave vector @xmath65 averaged over @xmath55 short runs with @xmath66 , taking data up to @xmath67 .",
    "these data are denoted by small dots in the later figures . in the intermediate time range , @xmath68",
    ", we measured the structure function for @xmath69 and always performed 50 runs ( big dots in the figures ) . in the long time range , @xmath47",
    ", we took data for @xmath70 , averaging over 30 to 100 runs ( circles in the figures ) .",
    "for each set of runs with given maximal time , we also measured the average of @xmath54 .    for additional information on the statistical accuracy of our data",
    ", we measured the imaginary part of @xmath71 , which rigorously vanishes for @xmath72 , but fluctuates about zero for @xmath73 in a finite sample . for longer times",
    "we typically found average values of order @xmath74 , again smaller than the uncertainty of @xmath54 in long - time runs .",
    "first considerations suggest to restrict the analysis to the momentum range @xmath75 .",
    "momenta of order @xmath76 do not resolve the tube but rather see a cloud of beads .",
    "for momenta @xmath77 the micro - structure of the chain might play a role . in our simulations",
    "the above condition can only poorly be satisfied .",
    "for our longest chain @xmath78 it reads @xmath79 , leaving at best a small window close to @xmath80 .",
    "however , a closer inspection reveals that these considerations do not seriously restrict dynamic measurements . to check the relevance of the condition @xmath81 we analyzed the dynamics of a free chain .",
    "as is well known , asymptotically the standard rouse dynamics is found if for a lattice chain ` kink jumps ' : @xmath82 are allowed besides hairpin - moves .",
    "we found that with this modified dynamics , the normalized coherent structure function is in excellent agreement with the relaxation function calculated from the continuous chain rouse model , even for @xmath83 .",
    "micro - structure effects arising from the finite segment size die out very rapidly on the scale of about 10 @xmath84-steps and therefore should be negligible also for reptation dynamics . of course",
    "this does not exclude the possibility of dynamical micro - structure effects which might influence the short time regime and are not accounted for by the reptation model . in particular , reptation does not properly treat the dynamics of fluctuations perpendicular to the tube axis .    concerning the condition @xmath85 , we note that smaller wave vectors , of course , provide little information on the details of the internal motion of the chain , but at least they measure the global motion of the coil .",
    "however , the slowness of this motion asks for extremely large time ranges @xmath86 .",
    "we therefore performed only one series of simulations for @xmath87 , corresponding to @xmath88 .",
    "most of our simulations use values @xmath89 , with a maximal value of @xmath90 reached for @xmath91 .      in our simulations",
    "we choose @xmath92 to point into one of the three lattice directions . for that choice , the static correlations between segments @xmath93 and @xmath94 take the form @xmath95 where @xmath96 recall that the lattice constant @xmath29 defines the unit of length .",

    "a simplified version of the reptation model concentrates on the dynamics of the ` primitive chain ' @xcite , which is a reduced form of the chain , lying stretched in the tube . in the evans - edwards model",
    "the primitive chain can be viewed as the non - reversal random walk derived from the random walk configuration of the physical chain by cutting off all hairpins .",
    "all internal degrees of freedom are neglected so that within time interval @xmath98 , all parts of the primitive chain move the same distance @xmath99 along the tube .",
    "the length of the primitive chain is taken to be fixed .",
    "( this model often is addressed as ` the reptation model ' .",
    "we will use the term ` primitive chain model ' to distinguish it from the full reptation model which deals with the dynamics of spared length as the elementary process . )    with its simplifications , the primitive chain model treats only the destruction of the initial tube , as resulting from the global motion of the chain .",
    "it neglects tube length fluctuations which are due to the uncorrelated motion of the chain ends as well as relaxation in the interior of the tube . since both these additional effects",
    "are governed by the equilibration time @xmath10 of the chain , the primitive chain model is restricted to times @xmath100 .",
    "furthermore , the segment indices are taken as continuous variables , and this ` continuous chain limit ' restricts the theory to long chains : @xmath101 .    within this model the time dependent correlation function of two beads : @xmath102}\\right\\rangle\\ : \\ : \\:,\\ ] ] obeys a diffusion equation . solving this equation and integrating @xmath103 over the chain , doi and edwards arrive at the following result for the normalized coherent structure function ( see ref .",

    "we thus should fit the data to @xmath128 , with @xmath129 as another free parameter .    a detailed analysis of the reptation model points to tube length fluctuations as the origin of the initial decrease , rather than internal relaxation .",

    "we conclude that also from a purely phenomenological point of view , the form ( 3.9 ) of @xmath160 is not justified .",
    "the large and chain length dependent rescaling required for @xmath168 suggests that tube length fluctuations governed by time scale @xmath10 might be much more important than internal relaxation processes governed by an @xmath11-independent scale .",
    "we finally note that in ref .  @xcite a modified form of eq .",
    "( 3.9 ) has been proposed , in which the creep term @xmath172 is calculated from tube length fluctuations , but the form ( 3.7 ) of the local contribution is retained .",
    "the analysis is restricted to the time range @xmath173 , which is the relevant range for neutron scattering experiments . from fig .",
    "6 it is clear that with the proper parameter values @xmath174 as given in eq .",
    "( 3.8 ) , this modification can not improve the fit for @xmath173 , since tube length fluctuations only decrease the contribution @xmath172 . again",
    "a reasonable fit can be reached only if we take both @xmath161 and the scale of @xmath169 as free parameters .",
    "the primitive chain model neglects all internal degrees of freedom , and an attempt to model internal relaxation as one dimensional rouse motion leads to unphysical initial conditions , which seriously affect the results up to times of the order of the internal relaxation time @xmath10 .",
    "however , the simplifying assumptions underlying these approaches are no essential part of the original reptation model .",
    "as recalled in the introduction , reptation as single elementary process involves the diffusion of spared length along the chain , together with its decay and creation at the chain ends .",
    "the separation of the dynamics into internal relaxation , tube length fluctuations and motion of the primitive chain therefore is somewhat artificial . in particular , tube length fluctuations",
    "can not properly be separated from the motion of the primitive chain , as will be discussed in sect .",
    "furthermore , from our analysis of segment motion we know that for typical experimental chain lengths we are in a crossover region where all dynamic effects must be treated on the same level by evaluating the consequences of full reptational dynamics .    in our analytical work",
    "@xcite we use a very simple implementation of the reptation idea , in which the wiggles of spared length are represented by particles which hop along the chain , with hopping probability @xmath175 per time step .",
    "the particles do not interact , and a given particle sees the others just as part of the chain . if a particle passes a bead , it shifts the position of this bead in the tube by the spared length @xmath176 .",
    "the chain ends are coupled to large particle reservoirs , which absorb and emit particles at such a rate that the equilibrium density @xmath177 of spared length on the chain is maintained on the average .",
    "absorption or emission of a particle prolongs or shortens the tube at the corresponding chain end by the spared length @xmath176 . keeping track of the change in the occupation number of the reservoirs",
    ", we therefore control the tube length fluctuations as well as the destruction of the original tube .",
    "in particular , within time interval @xmath178 $ ] an end piece of length @xmath179 of the original tube has been destroyed , where @xmath180 is the largest negative fluctuation of the occupation number of the corresponding reservoir during this time interval .",
    "all moments of the stochastic processes which determine the motion of internal segments or the occupation of the reservoirs , can be evaluated rigorously , but the determination of the maximal fluctuation @xmath180 poses a serious problem .",
    "the occupation number of a reservoir carries out a _ correlated _ random process , since a particle emitted can be reabsorbed by the same reservoir later .",
    "this correlation dies out only on scale of the internal equilibrium time @xmath10 of the chain .",
    "it does not prevent the evaluation of arbitrary moments , but the maximal fluctuation can not be calculated rigorously .",
    "such a calculation is possible @xcite only for an _ uncorrelated _ random process . to determine the degree of tube destruction",
    ", we therefore have to resort to some approximation . in our method",
    ", we basically for each final time @xmath24 replace the correlated random process by that uncorrelated random walk which for this time yields the correct moments .",
    "the effective hopping rate of this random walk depends on the final time @xmath24 .",
    "it changes from the microscopic rate @xmath181 for @xmath182 to the mobility @xmath183 of the primitive chain for @xmath100 , which is a physically most reasonable behavior .",
    "in essence , this ` mean hopping rate ' approximation for the coherent structure function smoothly interpolates between two rigorously accessible limits . for @xmath182 , tube renewal does not influence the motion of an interior piece of the chain , and",
    "the coherent structure function of such pieces can be calculated rigorously .",
    "for @xmath100 the correlations of the stochastic processes are negligible and the mean hopping rate approximation should become exact . indeed , we find that in this limit the motion of all chain segments is tightly bound to the motion of the chain ends . as a result , the problem reduces to the uncorrelated motion of a single stochastic variable , as in the primitive chain model .",
    "the details of our approximation are discussed extensively in refs .",
    "@xcite , and will not be repeated here .",
    "the coherent scattering function can be determined by summing the contribution of two beads @xmath184 over the bead indices @xmath185 . for this function",
    "we in ref .",

    "measuring all lengths in units of @xmath29 , we introduce the dimensionless spared length @xmath205    it turns out that for all times beyond truly microscopic times @xmath206 , the hopping rate @xmath175 combines with @xmath24 to yield the time variable @xmath207 which we will use in the sequel .",
    "the relation of @xmath208 to the monte carlo time @xmath46 introduces the fit parameter @xmath209 : @xmath210 also @xmath177 and @xmath211 combine into a single important parameter .",
    "the number of particles that passed over a bead on average increases with time , and if it is sufficiently large , the discreteness of the individual hopping processes becomes irrelevant .",
    "the results then depend only on the combination @xmath212 . in our previous work on the motion of individual segments",
    "@xcite , we found that @xmath211 and @xmath177 separately enter the results only for @xmath213 . in this time region , a segment on average has moved less than 10 steps in the tube and still feels the discreteness of the process . for the structure function",
    "we find that not even this small time region is seriously affected .",
    "if we ignore the discreteness of the hopping process , the results for all @xmath214 change by less than 0.5 % , which coincides with the accuracy of our numerical evaluation .",
    "thus the only microscopic parameters relevant for the coherent structure function are the combination @xmath212 and the time scale @xmath209 .",
    "the reason behind this empirically observed suppression of initial discreteness effects will be discussed in subsect .",
    "we furthermore note that also the discreteness of the underlying chain turns out to be unimportant .",
    "provided we normalize the coherent structure function by the static structure function calculated for the same micro - structure , we for @xmath215 and wave vectors @xmath216 within the above quoted accuracy find the same results for a continuous chain as for the model where we sum over discrete bead indices @xmath185 .",
    "this observation is consistent with the independence of statics and dynamics discussed in sect .",
    "2.b and illustrates that our calculation indeed yields universal results .    since in our simulations we use the same model as in our previous work on segment motion @xcite",
    ", we can take the numerical values of the microscopic parameters from there . in analyzing the monte carlo data",
    ", we thus use the value @xmath217 having a much larger set of data available than previously , we somewhat readjust the time scale .",
    "we use @xmath218 rather than the previous value @xmath219 . for the logarithmic scale @xmath220 of the figures in ref .",
    "@xcite , this amounts to a shift by @xmath221 , which does not change the good agreement among theory an experiment which in ref .",
    "@xcite is shown to hold over about 6 decades of time .    in our formulation of the reptation model ,",
    "the entanglement length @xmath8 , or the tube diameter @xmath222 , equivalently , do not show up explicitly .",
    "they are hidden in the spared length and the density of the particles , i.e. , in the overall mobility of the chain . in contrast , the previous approaches explicitly involve these parameters .",
    "as discussed at the end of the last subsection , our theory in appropriate limits reproduces the previous results , which allows us @xcite to relate our parameters @xmath223 to those of these other models .",
    "specifically , we find a relation for the entanglement length : @xmath224 with the numerical value ( 4.6 ) this yields @xmath163 and implies that for the evans - edwards model with the smallest possible obstacle spacing it needs about 4 steps before the obstacles come into play seriously .",
    "we note that @xmath225 and thus @xmath8 have been determined @xcite by fitting data for the motion of individual segments in the time range @xmath226 .",
    "@xmath8 is thus not influenced by the deviations from the full reptation model occuring in the initial range @xmath213 , as discussed below , ( sect .",

    "tube destruction , tube length fluctuations , and internal relaxation are different facets of the same microscopic dynamics",
    ". therefore any separation of these processes is to some extent artificial .",
    "yet some rough discussion based on these concepts is useful with regard to the interpretation of the data presented in sect .",
    "we first consider tube length fluctuations @xmath235 . here",
    "a precise definition is possible by identifying @xmath235 with the fluctuations of the total spared length . on average",
    "the spared length equals @xmath236 , where @xmath237 is the average number of particles on the chain .",

    "this new piece has an average extension of @xmath240 , and to observe the effect , the scattering vector must obey @xmath241 , or @xmath242 equivalently . for large wave vectors ,",
    "the coherent structure function @xmath25 is determined by the part of the original tube that still exists at time @xmath24 . taking only tube length fluctuations into account",
    ", we therefore find for @xmath243 : @xmath244 provided @xmath127 is large compared to the bound ( 4.15 ) .",
    "this estimate yields the effect of fully developed tube length fluctuations .",
    "with increasing chain lengths it clearly is suppressed , but it should be well visible up to fairly long chains @xmath245 .",
    "tube destruction in the sense of the primitive chain model is responsible for the main part of the decay of the coherent structure function . according to eq .",
    "( 4.16 ) , it is the dominant effect as soon as @xmath246 . for @xmath247 ,",
    "it is strongly correlated with tube length fluctuations which , seen from a microscopic point of view , drive the tube destruction . it therefore is no surprise that evaluating the coherent structure function of the primitive chain model , @xmath248 , for @xmath85 and time @xmath249 , we find a decrease of the same order of magnitude as that due to tube length fluctuations . @xmath250",
    "recall that @xmath251 ( eq .  ( 3.6 ) ) is the limit of @xmath118 for @xmath85 .",
    "comparison of eqs .",
    "( 4.16 ) , ( 4.17 ) illustrates that tube length fluctuations can not properly be separated from tube destruction .",
    "being of the same order of magnitude for @xmath243 , they strongly interfere in the full theory .",
    "we finally note that the use of @xmath13 as fit parameter , necessary to fit the results of the primitive chain model to our data , illustrates that tube length fluctuations influence the efficiency of tube destruction for all times @xcite , even for chains of lengths @xmath252 .",
    "internal relaxation can be analyzed by considering a subchain of length @xmath40 in the center of an infinitely long chain .",
    "we thus consider the coherent structure function @xmath253 within time @xmath24 , segment @xmath93 is displaced along the tube by @xmath254 steps , and since the tube has a random walk conformation , the average over the paths of segment @xmath93 yields @xmath255 this expression is to be averaged over the distribution @xmath256 of the number @xmath257 of particles that diffused over bead @xmath93 .",
    "we note that in the situation considered here @xmath256 is independent of @xmath93 , since the process is translationally invariant along an infinitely long chain .",

    "( 4.20 ) yields the static structure function of the subchain .",
    "all time dependence results from the motion of the end pieces of the subchain and thus is due to the length fluctuations and the shift of the subchain in the tube .",
    "proper interior relaxation within the subchain has no effects on the coherent structure function .",
    "we want to stress that this does _ not _ imply that our theory _ neglects _ interior relaxation .",
    "the basic relation ( 4.19 ) only exploits the fact that the segment @xmath93 has carried out a random walk of @xmath262 steps .",
    "it does not imply that this walk is along the precise original configuration of the chain .",
    "rather the path will have changed by the motion of other segments , i.e. , internal relaxation .",
    "what our result shows is that the effects of interior relaxation _ average out _ in the structure function as calculated within the reptation model .",
    "this also explains the observation in subsect .",
    "4.b that the discreteness of the individual steps is unimportant numerically .",
    "it yields only a correction to the second term in eq .",
    "( 4.20 ) , which by itself is very small in the time range @xmath213 where discreteness corrections might show up .",
    "deviations among theory and data which we will find for short times and wave vectors of the order of the inverse segment size therefore must originate from effects not taken into account in the reptation model .    in this context",
    "some further remark on the model of rouse motion in a coiled tube seems appropriate .",
    "concerning the _ dynamics _ along the tube , our hopping model is essentially equivalent to rouse motion .",
    "specifically , beyond microscopic times the motion of individual segments approaches rouse type motion , as has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , sect .  3 .",
    "the difference found for the structure function results from the imposed initial conditions , only .",
    "it reflects the fact that the structure function measures correlations between two segments @xmath103 and thus is influenced by the initial configuration of the subchain connecting @xmath93 with @xmath94 .    to summarize",
    ", we have seen that in the limit @xmath196 with @xmath263 kept fixed , the coherent structure function of the total chain varies only on scale @xmath13 . in this limit , @xmath264 is given by the primitive chain model . for shorter chains ,",
    "tube length fluctuations come into play .",
    "they change the effective reptation time and lead to an initial decrease of @xmath160 on time scale @xmath10 .",
    "both effects are important for chains up to lengths @xmath245 , at least .",
    "proper internal relaxation , however , averages out .    with regard to the data presented in sect .  5",

    "@xmath11 , this may occur for times @xmath267 .",
    "@xmath38 then decreases like @xmath268 , this law reflecting the @xmath20-law ( eq .  ( 1.1 ) ) for the motion of an internal segment . for @xmath269 , the motion of the subchain",
    "is driven by particles created by the chain ends which leads to a decrease like @xmath270 ( cf .",
    "( 1.1 ) ) .",
    "finally , of course , this behavior is cut off by tube destruction reaching the position of the subchain . on the quantitative level",
    "this behavior can be extracted from our theory . in the discussion of our data",
    "we in some figures will include curves which show the effect of relaxation of the ( sub- ) chain moving in an infinitely long tube , i.e. , neglecting all tube renewal effects .",
    "the integral equations which yield the normalized coherent structure function @xmath264 of the full reptation model , can be solved only numerically .",
    "furthermore , also the kernel and the inhomogeneity in these equations do not take a simple form @xcite .",
    "in particular , the inhomogeneity is given by some integral with a lengthy integrand .",
    "thus , to present the results in a more easily tractable form some more or less heuristic analytical parameterization might be useful .",
    "it should be clear that such a parameterization can not be very simple .",
    "the coherent scattering function involves two time scales : @xmath10 and @xmath13 .",
    "furthermore also wave vector and chain length combine into two relevant variables : @xmath198 and @xmath271 .",
    "the latter variable should govern the contribution of tube length fluctuations ( cf .",
    "( 4.15 ) ) .",
    "in searching for a reasonable parameterization we exploit the fact that for very long chains our results reduce to those of the primitive chain model . furthermore , as shown in sect .",
    "3.a , the functional form of @xmath160 , given by this model , can be used to fit the long - time tail also for non - asymptotic chain lengths .",

    "the initial decrease of the scattering function over a sizeable range of time is approximated by a stretched exponential with an effective exponent which strongly decreases with increasing @xmath198 .",

    "( 4.9 ) : @xmath282 .    the parameterization ( 4.21)-(4.25 ) is fitted to the numerical evaluation of our theory in the range @xmath283 ; @xmath284 ; @xmath285 . in most of that range",
    "it reproduces our full results within deviations less than @xmath286 in absolute value .",
    "it becomes worse for shorter chains @xmath287 and larger wave vectors @xmath288 in the large time regime @xmath289 . in this region",
    "the large - time tail predicted by the full theory deviates somewhat from the functional form given by the primitive chain model , and also small differences between the continuous and the discrete version of the model start to show up . for @xmath290",
    "our theory breaks down , mainly due to the fact that tube length fluctuations become important even for @xmath291 .",
    "they thus affect the kernel @xmath292 of the integral equation ( 4.2 ) , and this effect has not been considered in our theory .    in the sequel",
    "we compare our monte carlo data to the results of the numerical evaluation of our full theory .",
    "it should be noted , however , that on the scale of the plots shown the difference between the results of the full theory and the effective parameterization ( 4.21)-(4.25 ) would be almost invisible .",
    "the reptation model in full detail treats the motion along the tube axis , but it does not account for all relaxation processes in a realistic chain . in particular , motions ` perpendicular to the tube ' , like the creation and decay of larger side branches , will be present for the monte carlo chain but are not treated properly in the reptation model . since larger side branches emerge by fusion of hairpins , they in the framework of our model would introduce some kind of interaction of the particles .",
    "scattering vectors of magnitude @xmath293 certainly resolve such effects which result in some additional relaxation on a microscopic time scale . in fitting the data to the theory we therefore allow for a phenomenological amplitude @xmath294 , multiplying the normalized structure function @xmath264 calculated for pure reptation .",
    "we typically find values @xmath295 for @xmath296 , @xmath297 for @xmath298 , and @xmath299 for all smaller @xmath127 measured .",
    "thus the deviations among theory and data which are found for small times , rapidly decrease with decreasing @xmath127 .    for a first illustration , we in fig .  7",

    "thus fig .",
    "7 demonstrates that the tube length fluctuations strongly influence the structure function up to times @xmath243 . for much larger times",

    "10 in the range @xmath315 is not due to relaxation within the subchain @xmath40 considered , but results from the internal dynamics of the total chain which leads to fluctuations of the position of the subchain in the original tube .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "11 , which for given @xmath121 and @xmath316 compares the scattering from central subchains of lengths @xmath317 .",
    "we note some peculiar behavior : as function of time , the normalized scattering function of the total chain @xmath318 initially decreases faster and eventually crosses results for internal pieces .",
    "this shows the efficiency of tube length fluctuations in comparison to the internal dynamics of the chain . according to the discussion of sect .",
    "4.c , subchains @xmath319 ( for @xmath320 are not influenced by tube length fluctuations , and for a large time range scattering from such subchains is determined by the diffusive motion of the total subchain in the initial tube .",
    "since the diffusion coefficient of this motion scales as @xmath321 , the diffusion of the longer subchains is very slow .",
    "taking place in the initial tube , it is also less efficient in reducing @xmath160 than tube length fluctuations or the tube destructing shift of the total chain .",
    "for these reasons , the normalized coherent scattering for @xmath322 stays above the result for the total chain up to times @xmath323 . for larger times",
    "the theory predicts that as for the shorter subchains the normalized scattering from subchain @xmath322 falls below the scattering from the total chain , but the effect is too small to be visible in fig .  11 , and it clearly is not resolved by the accuracy of the data .",
    "we also note that tube destruction reaches the initial position of the subchain @xmath322 only for @xmath324 . with decreasing @xmath40 , diffusion in the tube",
    "becomes faster , and for the shortest subchain , @xmath325 , we see indications of a new regime : the slope of the curve seems to change near @xmath326 .",
    "a doubly logarithmic plot reveals that in the range @xmath327 the data approach a @xmath328-law , and the upper bound of this interval is close to the time @xmath329 .",
    "these observations are consistent with the discussion of sect .",
    "finally we consider the deviations between theory and data present for @xmath213 and large wave vectors .",
    "a first important observation is that these deviations roughly are of the same size for interior pieces of the chain as for the total chain , see fig .",
    "11 . therefore their dominant source can not be searched in our treatment of tube length fluctuations in the mean hopping rate approximation . to show this in more detail , we in fig .",
    "12 have plotted the deviation between data and theory for wave vector @xmath316 and all chains and subchains measured .",
    "we note some end - effect : for the total chain @xmath330 the deviation is about 20 % larger than for the central piece @xmath322 in the chain @xmath121 . however , the bulk of the effect is independent of @xmath331 , as illustrated by the curves for @xmath325 and @xmath332 , which each in fact combine data for @xmath170 and @xmath121 . for these internal pieces ,",
    "tube length fluctuations are irrelevant , and in the time range shown , our evaluation of the reptation model is exact within the accuracy ( 0.5 % ) of our numerics . consequently the initial deviations must be dominated by some relaxation in the interior of the subchain @xmath40 which is not taken into account by the reptation model .",
    "we note that the amplitude @xmath333 of the effect depends on @xmath40 only weakly , but strongly increases with @xmath127 , as is illustrated by figs .",
    "it roughly is proportional to @xmath334 .",
    "these observations are consistent with an interpretation as micro - structure effects , which clearly increase strongly with the resolving power of the experiment and are expected to show a weak dependence @xmath335 on ( sub-)chain length .    in our previous work on the motion of individual segments , we found initial transients which also decayed on a time scale @xmath213 .",
    "these could be traced back to the discreteness of both the hopping process and the underlying chain and could be largely explained by a fully discrete analysis of our model . as mentioned in sect .",
    "4.a , it turns out that for @xmath336 this discreteness numerically is irrelevant . in the light of the discussion of sect .",
    "4.c , this is quite understandable : the internal dynamics of the subchain averages out .",
    "we thus have to search for effects going beyond our implementation of the reptation model .",
    "one source of discrepancy immediately comes into mind .",
    "a particle sitting on a bead is no exact representation of a hairpin .",
    "it , for instance , is not clear whether the bead sits in the tip or in the base of the hairpin .",
    "simple estimates of such effects easily yield a correction amplitude @xmath337 of the desired order of magnitude . however",
    ", the dynamics of single hairpins can not explain a time scale of order @xmath58 since it essentially relaxes within one monte carlo step .",
    "slower relaxation occurs for larger side branches .",
    "already a structure created by fusion of two hairpins shows a relaxation time of the order of @xmath338 steps .",
    "indeed , the fusion of hairpins destroys mobile units of the monte carlo chain . in the language of our model",
    "this induces some dynamical interaction of the particles .",
    "we therefore believe that the observed initial transients are due to the interference of reptation with the dynamics of larger side branches .",
    "in this paper , we presented results of simulations of the evans - edwards model , measuring the coherent structure function of a reptating chain in a large range of time and wave vector .",
    "this model contains the full reptational dynamics of a single chain , including internal relaxation , tube length fluctuations , and tube renewal , but omits all the dynamics of the environment . in particular",
    ", it ignores constraint release . we compared the data to two simplified versions of the reptation model as well as to our recent evaluation of the full theory .",
    "we found that the primitive chain model proposed by doi and edwards @xcite yields a good fit to the data for times large compared to the rouse time @xmath10 , provided we allow for a phenomenological amplitude factor and treat the reptation time @xmath13 as a second adjustable parameter .",
    "de gennes approach @xcite which adds a contribution meant to take one dimensional internal relaxation along the tube into account , can not explain the data consistently .",
    "so the success of this approach in fitting neutron scattering data on polymer melts @xcite indicates that the local contribution @xmath339 to de gennes structure function phenomenologically accounts for some dynamics not contained in the reptation model . in view of our findings for the evans - edwards model we would search the origin of the observed initial decay in a coupling of reptation to motion perpendicular to the tube . since in the experimental time range the initial decay accounts for most of the variation of the experimental curves @xcite , we have not tried to fit these curves with our theory .",
    "provided we allow for a single adjustable amplitude factor we , beyond the short time range influenced by microstructure relaxation , find quantitative agreement between our simulation data and our analytical evaluation @xcite of full reptation theory .",
    "the theory in all details explains not only the scattering function of the total chain but also the scattering from interior subchains . except for the phenomenological amplitude , which notably differs from @xmath52 only for wave vectors of the order of the inverse segment size",
    ", all parameters of the theory essentially are fixed by our previous analysis @xcite of the motion of internal segments .",
    "thus our version of the reptation model consistently explains both details of the internal motion and global features like the scattering function .",
    "our analysis shows that the effects of internal relaxation contained in the reptation model and seen , for instance , in the motion of internal segments , for the scattering functions average out . in the reptation model ,",
    "the time dependence of the scattering functions is determined solely by the interplay of tube destruction and tube length fluctuations .",
    "the latter not only determine the scattering function up to times of order @xmath10 , but also for intermediate chain lengths lead to the decrease @xcite of the reptation time @xmath13 in comparison to the asymptotic law , clearly seen also in the scattering function . numerically evaluating our theory , we found these effects to be well visible up to chain lengths of the order of 300 entanglement lengths .",
    "this is obvious from the numerical parameterization of our results , given in section 4  d.    our theory deviates from the results of the simulation in the initial time region @xmath340 .",
    "we stress that this is not due to the approximations inherent in our treatment of tube destruction .",
    "deviations of the same order of magnitude occur for the total chain and for internal subchains , and the coherent structure function of internal subchains in the initial time region is not affected by our approximations .",
    "thus the need to introduce some phenomenological parameter to take short time relaxation into account illustrates that even for the evans - edwards model , which is the most accurate computer - experimental implementation of the reptation model we can think of , some relaxation perpendicular to the tube shows up",
    ". clearly , for a melt , such effects must be much larger",
    ". however , our analysis suggests some way to suppress these contributions . the scattering from a chain of length @xmath341",
    "should be compared to the scattering from the central piece of length @xmath40 in a chain of length @xmath342 . up to small end effects",
    ", the difference of the two coherent scattering functions should be due to reptation alone , and can be calculated from our theory . to observe an effect ,",
    "the experiments must cover a time range extending at least up to the rouse time , with chain length being of the order @xmath343 .",
    "unfortunately , for physical experiments , this seems to be out of reach . as shown by the work of ref .",
    "@xcite it might be feasible in simulations .",
