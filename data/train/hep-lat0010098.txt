    "an important feature of both domain wall and overlap fermion formulations is that the chiral limit is disentangled from the continuum limit . for the case of the domain wall fermions ,",
    "the chiral symmetry breaking is solely controlled by the amount of coupling between the domain walls@xcite . to exploit the chiral properties of the domain wall fermions , it is essential to understand these chiral symmetry breaking effects .",
    "we reported earlier@xcite that for quenched simulations , although the quantity @xmath6 obtained from the pseudoscalar density correlator decreased as the separation between the domain walls @xmath7 was increased , it did not appear to vanish in the @xmath8 limit .",
    "further investigation shows that the chiral limit of the pion mass is distorted by many factors . besides the order @xmath9 effects and finite volume effects common to both dynamical and quenched simulations using domain wall fermions ,",
    "the presence of topological near - zero modes in the quenched approximation significantly affects the determination of the pion mass@xcite .",
    "these zero - mode effects can be suppressed by going to a larger volume .",
    "other non - linear behaviors caused by the absence of the fermion determinant in quenched simulations , such as `` quenched chiral logs '' , may also play an important role in the behavior of the pion mass as the chiral limit is approached .",
    "these factors make it difficult to determine the degree of chiral symmetry breaking from examination of the pion mass in the quenched chiral limit .",
    "the technique described in detail below quantifies the chiral symmetry breaking effects more precisely by a single residual mass measured from the extra term in the divergence of the axial current@xcite .",
    "close to the continuum , the effect of mixing between the domain walls produces chiral symmetry breaking terms with a coefficient @xmath10 , the residual mass , in the low energy effective lagrangian .",
    "this results in an effective quark mass of @xmath11 entering all low momentum green s functions .",
    "we can measure @xmath12 starting from the divergence of the axial current , given by@xcite @xmath13 compared with the corresponding continuum expression , the additional term from @xmath14 , referred as the `` mid - point '' contribution , should be equivalent to @xmath15 up to @xmath16 . therefore when t is large enough such that low energy physics dominates , the ratio @xmath17 should be equal to @xmath12 .",
    "[ fig : mres_plateau ] shows that the plateau for @xmath18 at @xmath19 , @xmath20 starts from @xmath21 , and at @xmath0 , @xmath22 it starts from @xmath23 .    =    being part of the mass term of the low energy effective lagrangian close to the continuum",
    ", @xmath12 should provide a universal description of the residual chiral symmetry breaking effects in all long distance observables .",
    "this is demonstrated in figure [ fig : mres_vs_mf ] where @xmath12 shows little @xmath24 or volume dependence at @xmath25 , @xmath22 .",
    "=    =    figure [ fig : mres_vs_ls ] shows the @xmath7 dependence of @xmath10 at @xmath19 .",
    "the residual mass decreases with @xmath7 , but the data points are poorly fit by a simple exponential .",
    "if we add a constant to the function , a much better fit can be obtained .",
    "this constant , which is the residual mass at infinite @xmath7 , is about 1 mev .",
    "the five points can also be fit extremely well to a double - exponential function ; this may suggest the existence of multiple decay modes .",
    "the exact asymptotic form for @xmath12 as a function of @xmath7 still needs further investigation .",
    "however for @xmath20 , @xmath12 is already as low as 3.87(16 ) mev in the @xmath26 scheme at 2 gev , about 1/30 of the strange quark mass .",
    "this value is so small that the residual chiral symmetry breaking is not very important for these simulations . even at the stronger coupling @xmath0 ( @xmath27 gev ) , when @xmath7 is increased from 32 to 48 , @xmath10 drops from 0.0105(2 ) to 0.00688(13 ) , which is about 1/14 of the strange quark mass .",
    "good chiral properties can be obtained by simulating at this value of @xmath7 .",
    "studies of this issue can also be found in @xcite .",
    "as a test of these measurements and chiral properties , we calculate the pion decay constant using the pseudoscalar density correlator , which requires knowledge of the residual mass , and compare the results with those obtained from the axial vector current correlator .",
    "following the definition of the pion decay constant , @xmath28 can be related to the amplitude of the axial current correlator @xmath29 : @xmath30 in eq .",
    "[ eq : aa_fpi ] , the renormalization factor @xmath31 is needed to relate the local axial current to the conserved current in the domain wall fermion formulation .",
    "@xmath31 can be measured by studying the large t behavior of the quantity @xmath32 , defined as the ratio of the coupling between the conserved current and the pion to the coupling between the local current and the pion .",
    "figure [ fig : za_plateau ] shows that nice plateaus for @xmath32 can be found over the ranges @xmath33 and @xmath34 for both @xmath19 , @xmath20 with @xmath5 volume and @xmath0 , @xmath22 with @xmath4 volume .",
    "the @xmath7 dependence of @xmath31 at @xmath19 is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : za_vs_ls ] . for @xmath7 ranging from 12 to 48 , the change in @xmath31 is less than @xmath35 .",
    "therefore , the effect of finite @xmath7 on the result for @xmath31 is negligible .",
    "=    =    another method to calculate @xmath28 uses the relation between @xmath28 and the amplitude of the pseudoscalar correlator @xmath36 : @xmath37 which directly depends upon the residual mass @xmath12",
    ".    results for @xmath0 , @xmath22 with lattice volume @xmath4 show a discrepancy in the @xmath24 dependence of @xmath28 between these two methods .",
    "while the difference appears to become somewhat smaller at the larger volume of @xmath5 , we attribute the discrepancy between these two methods of calculating @xmath28 to @xmath16 errors .",
    "=    figure [ fig : fpi_b6_0_2parm ] shows the comparison of these two independent calculations at the weaker coupling @xmath19 .",
    "consistent results are seen at each valence quark mass , and the @xmath28 values measured by extrapolation to @xmath38 agree well with the physical value of 130 mev , where @xmath39 is used to set the scale .",
    "it is important to note that these good properties disappear if the value for @xmath12 in eq .",
    "[ eq : pp_fpi ] is replaced by 0 or by the @xmath40 intercept of the simple linear fit to @xmath41 .",
    "therefore , the good agreement seen between the two approaches serves as a consistency check of the residual mass analysis and a demonstration of the good chiral properties of the domain wall fermion formulation .",
    "the chiral symmetry breaking effects in the domain wall fermion formulation can be characterized by a residual mass , which enters the effective quark mass in the low energy effective lagrangian .",
