    "the enigma of dark matter ( dm ) remains unsolved .",
    "still one of the most evasive and fascinating mysteries in physics , the problem of the dark matter in the universe stirs the imagination of most astronomers , cosmologists and particle physicists , that are convinced that at least 90% of the mass of the universe is due to some non - luminous form of matter .",
    "modernly , dark matter candidates converge to a variety of interesting and plausible candidates namely the _ weakly - interacting massive particles _ ( wimps ) : standard model neutrinos @xcite , sterile neutrinos @xcite , axions @xcite , supersymmetric candidates [ neutralinos , sneutrinos , gravitinos , axinos ] @xcite-@xcite light scalar dark matter @xcite , dark matter from little higgs models @xcite , kaluza - klein particles @xcite , superheavy dark matter @xcite .",
    "an excellent review in theoretical and experimental aspects of dark matter can be found in @xcite .",
    "in general they are present in theories of weak - scale physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) and give rise to appropriate relic abundance .",
    "calculations have shown that stable wimps can remain from the earliest moments of the universe in sufficient number to account for a significant fraction of relic dark matter density .",
    "this raises the hope of detecting relic wimps directly by observing their elastic scattering on targets . in the dark matter zoo many different types of particles",
    "have been introduced and their properties theoretically studied .    in the present work a renormalizable extension of the sm with a hidden sector which consists of sm gauge singlets ( a singlet dirac fermion @xmath0 and a singlet scalar @xmath1 ) plus a vector boson @xmath2 , which we shall call the _ dark massive photon _ ,",

    "the singlet fermion and vector boson field interact with the sm only via the singlet scalar .",
    "the scalar field generates the vector boson s mass .",
    "the model is defined by the following lagrangian density    & = & _ sm+_+_s - g_s|+ _ i + _ v + _ & = & |(i - m__0 ) + _",

    "the dark vector boson part is @xmath8 , with the field tensor given by @xmath9 .",
    "the form of @xmath10 clearly indicates the possibility of spontaneous broken symmetry in the model , which is parameterized by introducing @xmath11 .",
