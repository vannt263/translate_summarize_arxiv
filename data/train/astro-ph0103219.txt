    "understanding the processes , and distinctions between , star formation , binary formation and planetary formation is a major goal of stellar astronomy .",
    "a necessary step towards that goal is to understand the frequency of `` brown dwarf '' and `` planetary '' companions as a function of separation , primary mass , and secondary mass .",
    "it is now well - known that brown dwarfs are very rare as close companions to f - m dwarfs ( the `` brown dwarf desert , '' marcy & butler 2000 ) yet they are quite common in the field @xcite and in open clusters @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this letter is to show that current data allow an estimate of the wide ( @xmath0 a.u . )",
    "brown dwarf companion frequency to near - solar mass main sequence stars , despite the present lack of well - defined searches for wide companions .",
    "the observational constraints and resulting wide companion frequency are discussed in section  [ obs ] and the differences between this fraction and the close companion frequency are discussed in section  [ discussion ] .",
    "2mass searches for ultracool dwarfs are based on colors and magnitudes ; although designed to find isolated field dwarfs , they are not biased against widely separated ( @xmath6 arcsec ) companions whose photometry is uncontaminated by the primary star .",
    "three published brown dwarf companions with separations @xmath7 a.u .",
    "have been identified in the course of 2mass searches for isolated field brown dwarfs .",
    "the l4.5 dwarf gl 417b has an estimated mass of @xmath8 and age @xmath9 gyr while the l8 dwarf gl 584c has a mass of @xmath10 and an age of 1.0 - 2.5 gyr @xcite .",
    "the t dwarf gl 570d has a mass of @xmath11 and an age of 2 - 10 gyr @xcite .",
    "all are definitely substellar via spectroscopic crieria as well , since both l dwarfs pass the lithium test while the t dwarf is too cool to be a star .",
    "all three have been confirmed as companions by their common proper motion .",
    "these reflect the results from 2mass searches of only a fraction of the sky  wide brown dwarf companions continued to be discovered .",
    "@xcite will describe the discovery of three additional l dwarf secondaries at 880 a.u .",
    ", 1090 a.u . , and 2460 a.u .",
    "the usual procedure for determining companion frequency is to survey a number ( @xmath12 ) of potential primary stars .",
    "if @xmath13 brown dwarfs with spectral type l are found , the frequency of l dwarf companions ( in the searched separation range ) is simply @xmath14 . in the case of imaging surveys , only a fraction ( @xmath15 ) of the brown dwarfs can be detected as l dwarfs , since brown dwarfs fade to very low temperatures and luminosities .",
    "modelling of @xmath15 allows an estimate of the true brown dwarf frequency to be @xmath16 . in principle , the two micron all - sky survey ( 2mass ) allows a search for wide companions to nearby stars , allowing @xmath17 and @xmath18 to be determined . a complete search , however , has not yet been made , due to the complexities of the task .",
    "it is nevertheless possible to estimate the frequency of wide - separation brown dwarf companions , since the frequency can also be expressed as @xmath19 in this equation , @xmath20 is the space density of stars ( the potential primaries ) , @xmath21 is the space density of wide brown dwarf companions , @xmath22 is the space density of field brown dwarfs found by 2mass , and @xmath23 is the frequency of field brown dwarfs that have a stellar primary at @xmath0 a.u . each of these variables can be estimated from published data .",
    "separations of 1000 a.u .",
    "correspond to 40 arcseconds at 25 parsecs distance , and larger values at closer distances . for these wide systems ,",
    "the presence of the main sequence star does not affect the identification of the brown dwarf in searches for isolated field objects .",
    "in the final step , we have assumed that @xmath24 for all brown dwarfs is the same as @xmath24 for l dwarfs .",
    "the observed space density of l dwarfs can be determined using the @xcite sample of l dwarfs . adopting the limiting magnitude @xmath25 and the @xcite spectral type-@xmath26 relation , the @xcite @xmath27 technique yields an l dwarf space density of @xmath28 pc@xmath29 .",
    "the space density of t dwarfs is highly uncertain but comparable @xcite .",
    "only a small fraction ( @xmath30 ) of brown dwarfs are observable as l , or even t , dwarfs .",
    "we can estimate @xmath30 in two ways . _",
    "if _ the mass function of companions is similar to that of isolated field brown dwarfs , then we can use the correction determined for isolated brown dwarfs .",
    "@xcite estimate that _ if _ the substellar mass function can be described as a power law @xmath31 extending down to @xmath32 , then @xmath33 and @xmath34 b.d . pc@xmath29 with large uncertainties . for the cases @xmath35 and @xmath36 , then @xmath37 and 0.07 b.d .",
    "pc@xmath29 respectively .",
    "surveys of the pleiades are consistent with @xmath38 @xcite , and neither that cluster nor the field is consistent with @xmath39 .",
    "we adopt @xmath40 b.d .",
    "pc@xmath29 ; hence , the ratio of l dwarfs to brown dwarfs is @xmath41 .",
    "alternatively , we may attempt to estimate the parameter @xmath30 directly from the properties of the l dwarf companions .",
    "gl 584c is just at the limits of detectability ; since its age is in the range 1.0 - 2.5 gyr , it is only detectable for 0.1 - 0.25 of the age of the disk .",
    "gl 417b is easily detectable as an l4.5 , but would have been detectable down to spectral type l8 .",
    "comparison to evolutionary tracks indicates it would then be visible to an age of 0.3 - 1.0 gyr .",
    "the companions themselves then imply a correction factor @xmath15 in the range 0.07 - 0.18  consistent with the isolated brown dwarf estimate .",
    "the fraction of the `` isolated '' field brown dwarfs which are actually wide companions to main sequence stars can be estimated from the 2mass field brown dwarf searches .",
    "over 100 field l dwarfs are now published , primarily from the 2mass @xcite , denis @xcite , and sdss @xcite surveys , of which two are wide companions to near - solar mass stars .",
    "many of the l dwarfs , however , are at large distances ( @xmath42 pc ) , where it would be difficult to discover an l dwarf companion due to proximity of the primary star . we choose to consider only l dwarfs within 25 parsecs because at this distance , we can be confident that bright ( f - k ) primaries are cataloged and the l dwarf companions at @xmath0 a.u",
    ". will be detectable . in this case , 2 of 40 l dwarfs ( * ? ? ?",
    "* table 4 ) have primaries , indicating the fraction of field l dwarfs which are actually wide companions is @xmath43 .",
    "this estimate is supported by the ongoing 2mass t dwarf search @xcite , which has now discovered 17 field t dwarfs @xcite .",
    "since t dwarfs are simply the older counterparts of l dwarfs , the fraction of field dwarfs which are companions should be roughly the same .",
    "one ( gl 570d ) of the t dwarfs is the fourth member of a k / m / m / t quadruple system @xcite , leading to an estimate of @xmath44 .",
    "( note that gl 229b is too close to gl 229a to be counted or even detected by 2mass . ) combining the l dwarf and t dwarf values , we adopt @xmath45 .",
    "the space density of stars which are potential primaries for the brown dwarfs can be determined from the nearby star catalog as modified by hipparcos parallaxes .",
    "all of the primaries to wide l / t dwarf companions ( including the new wilson et al .",
    "2001 systems),have @xmath2 ( or mass @xmath46 ) .",
    "@xcite find that the space density of stars with @xmath47 is @xmath48 pc@xmath29",
    ". these are f to m0 main sequence stars .",
    "we do not consider fainter primaries because the incompleteness of the late - m dwarf catalog means that we might not recognize their presence near an l dwarf .",
    "we therefore have insufficient information to calculate the m / l dwarf binary statistics .",
    "contribute another @xmath49 stars pc@xmath29 , implying that we could decrease the derived brown dwarf frequency by a factor 2.9  but in this case we face the puzzling fact that the chance of all 5 primaries having @xmath2 is only @xmath50% .",
    "an analogous difficulty in interpretation would occur if a search for companions amongst f - m dwarfs found companions only around the f , g and k dwarfs .",
    "] we can now estimate the wide brown dwarf companion frequency to main sequence stars .",
    "taking the stars with @xmath47 as the available primaries , we find @xmath51 .",
    "these , however , represent only a small fraction of the total brown dwarf population .",
    "we estimate @xmath52 by assuming a mass function @xmath53 ; the @xmath15 values from the companions themselves suggest values in the range 0.08 - 0.20 @xmath54 .    the large uncertainties  due to the fact that the estimates are based only 3 companions",
    " indicate that a larger survey is needed to determine the brown dwarf companion fraction ; we certainly can not prefer @xmath55 over @xmath56 given the uncertainties .",
    "however , it is important to realize that the error bars are non - gaussian and that very low companion fractions ( @xmath18 ) are already ruled out with statistical significance .",
    "the situation is illustrated in figure  [ fig_prob ] .",
    "we run monte carlo simulations of samples of 57 brown dwarfs and determine the percentage that have at least 3 wide companions .",
    "( for each value of @xmath18 , we run 200,000 simulations . )",
    "the solid line plots our preferred scenario : a brown dwarf space density of 0.07 pc@xmath29 ( equivalently , @xmath57 ) and all primaries with @xmath2 considered .",
    "it is possible to consider other scenarios .",
    "if @xmath58 , equivalent to assuming @xmath39 or @xmath59 ( long - dashed line ) , then values of @xmath18 as low as 0.015 can still be excluded at the 95% confidence level .",
    "this corresponds to a scenario in which nearly all brown dwarfs are relatively massive and therefore detectable as l dwarfs for many gyr ; in this case , the observed l dwarfs represent a larger fraction of the total brown dwarf population .",
    "we finally consider an extreme model , in which @xmath58 and @xmath60 pc@xmath29 . in this case",
    ", the brown dwarf binary fraction can be much lower ; in other words , we can reduce the reported brown dwarf fraction by averaging the many brown dwarf companions to @xmath1 primaries with the more numerous population of lower mass stars for which no wide brown dwarf companions have ever been detected .",
    "the existence of the `` brown dwarf desert '' separating stars from `` planets '' at separations less than 3 a.u . is well established @xcite .",
    "the review of @xcite finds that _ less than _ 0.5% of f - m dwarfs have brown dwarf companions down to @xmath32 on the basis of over 500 stars .",
    "the @xcite analysis of the 164 nearby g dwarfs studied by @xcite indicates that @xmath61% of g dwarfs have _ stellar _ companions in this separation range , and that the mass distribution of these close companions is lacking in very - low - mass stars ( a `` red dwarf steppe '' ? ) compared to both wider companions and the field mass function . on the basis of @xcite s analysis ( their figure 7 )",
    ", we estimate that @xmath62 % of g dwarfs have stellar companions with separation @xmath0 a.u .",
    "our evidence that f - m0 dwarfs have a significant ( @xmath63% ) population of very - low - mass companions at wide separations indicates that the orbital separation distribution of brown dwarf companions is not simply a scaled - down version of the stellar companion distribution .",
    "g dwarfs have approximately equal numbers of stellar - mass companions at separations @xmath3 a.u . and @xmath64 a.u .",
    "( @xmath65 ) ; in contrast , we estimate their brown dwarf companions are at least four , and probably many more , times more common at the larger separations ( @xmath66 ) . within the very large uncertainties ,",
    "the number ratio of stellar and brown dwarf companions may be near unity , similar to the ratio for isolated stars and brown dwarfs @xcite , although a considerably larger sample is needed to investigate this .",
    "the fact that all the primaries are relatively massive suggests that wide brown dwarf companions do not form around  or are not retained by  less massive ( @xmath67 ) primaries , although the incompleteness of the nearby star catalog for m dwarfs may contribute to this effect . the extreme limit to this",
    "is noted by @xcite , who find that l dwarf primaries lack companions beyond @xmath68 a.u .",
    "where the `` brown dwarf desert '' for f - m0 dwarf primaries ends is unclear at present , but searches around stars in the range 1 - 100 a.u .",
    "have generally had little success even though this range is the peak of stellar companion distribution for both g and m dwarf primaries @xcite .",
    "most recently , @xcite failed to discover any brown dwarfs despite a sensitive _ hubble space telescope _",
    "search at separations of @xmath69 a.u . around 23 stars , while the extensive , highly sensitive search of 107 stars by @xcite found only 1 brown dwarf in range @xmath70 a.u .",
    "( note that these volume - limited samples are dominated by m dwarf primaries with @xmath67 . )",
    "the fraction in the range 100 - 1000 a.u . can not yet be constrained , but the recent discoveries of three l brown dwarf companions at those separations @xcite suggest that they _ may _ be as common as wide companions and that 2mass should detect many more .    while the uncertainty of our derived companion fraction is large , perspective on the brown dwarf desert may be gained by considering the numbers of stars and brown dwarfs within 25 parsecs .",
    "there are 1297 main sequence stars with @xmath2 in this volume according to the @xcite luminosity function .",
    "radial velocity surveys indicate that they will have fewer than 6.5 brown dwarf companions within 3 a.u . in constrast , three wide - separation ( two l , one t ) brown dwarf companions",
    "are already known to such stars even though 1 ) only a small fraction of the sky has been searched , 2 ) t dwarfs are not detectable all the way to 25 parsecs , and 3 ) older / lower - mass brown dwarfs are undetectable .",
    "our numbers suggest another @xmath71 wide l dwarf companions within 25 parsecs will be found , representing only the young , massive tip of the brown dwarf population .",
    "combined with the @xcite observation that 20% of l dwarfs have h.s.t . resolved ( @xmath72 arcsec ) brown dwarf companions within @xmath73 a.u . but that wider companions are lacking , ( see also koerner et al .",
    "1999 ) , there is strong evidence that the frequency of brown dwarf companions is strongly dependent on both primary mass and orbital separation . there is a `` brown dwarf desert '' at @xmath74 ( or @xmath75 ? ) a.u . for f to mid - m main sequence primaries , and another desert for wide ( @xmath76 a.u . )",
    "brown dwarf doubles .",
    "this situation arises naturally in some theories of star formation @xcite .",
    "we use the field l and t dwarfs which were discovered to be wide companions to known stars to derive a preliminary brown dwarf companion frequency .",
    "the observed l and t dwarfs indicate that brown dwarfs are not unusually rare as wide ( @xmath77 a.u . )",
    "systems , even though they are rare ( @xmath78 ) at close ( @xmath74 a.u.)separations .",
    "the current data indicate that @xmath79 of @xmath2 primaries have a wide l dwarf companion ; the brown dwarf fraction should be substantially ( @xmath80 times ) higher .",
    "stellar companions in these separation ranges are equally frequent .    our estimates indicate that continued searches for wide brown dwarf companions should not be discouraged by the existence of the `` brown dwarf desert '' at close separations .",
    "there is now strong evidence  from both the wide companions examined in this work , and the close double brown dwarfs examined by @xcite  that the brown dwarf companion frequency is a strong function of both primary mass and separation . a search using 2mass for both stellar and brown dwarf companions with separation @xmath81 a.u .",
    "will be quite rewarding .",
    "furthermore , provided the older and lower - mass wide brown dwarf companions are not stripped in the galactic disk , the majority of the brown dwarfs should be intrinsically cooler than gl 570d , suggesting that a deep wide - field sirtf search near g and k dwarfs is a promising avenue to extend our knowledge of brown dwarfs .",
