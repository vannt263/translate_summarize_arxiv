    "it has been known for a decade that web - document popularity follows the zipf law  @xcite . nevertheless , the exponent values reported by different authors vary significantly , from 0.60 to 1.03  @xcite ( see table  [ datasets ] ) .",
    "we believe that the scattering of the reported values is due to the small sample size in some cases and to the details of the fitting procedure used to extract the exponent .    in this paper , we propose that the rank distribution of the websites follows the zipf law and give arguments supporting our idea .",
    "we must note that website statistics are more extensive than web - document statistics , and the distribution parameters can be obtained with higher accuracy .",
    "we address the following questions : is the rank distribution of websites zipf - like ?",
    "if yes , what are the conditions under which the `` true '' exponent can be obtained ? does the exponent depend on the duration of the observation ? or on the geographical position of the observer ? and does the exponent vary with time , as the internet develops ?",
    "we report some answers to these questions .",
    "we have studied website statistics , which are indeed more stable than web - document statistics .",
    "we have analyzed log files accumulated on cache servers of russian academic networks ( freenet , rasnet , and rssi ) for about six years .",
    "these networks differ by their connectivity topology and bandwidth , both national and international .",
    "these cache servers have different geographical locations ( moscow , moscow region , and yaroslavl in russia ) .",
    "in addition , we analyzed some statistics collected during seven weeks in the fall of 2004 at a number of ircache servers in the united states ( see table  [ table - setus ] ) .",
    "we found that the statistics studied become stable when the number of queries for the given statistics exceeds @xmath0 .",
    "it is therefore meaningful to fit only those data for which the number of queries exceeds this value .",
    "this simple criterion can be used to estimate the critical window for the rank interval where the distribution is stable and the power law can be observed .",
    "we found that the statistics are independent of the geographical location of the cache server ( observer ) collecting the data , at least for the analyzed data sets .",
    "we found that the distribution is independent of the different years of data collection and is therefore stable over internet history and development .",
    "nevertheless , we found that the zipf - like law approximation is suitable only in the middle region of several orders of rank magnitude .",
    "we propose a modification of the zipf - like law with two additional parameters and explain its possible meaning .",
    "we found that if we fit the equation of the modified law to the data , the website popularity distribution becomes quite stable .",
    "the value of the exponent @xmath1 is @xmath2 for all datasets studied in this paper .",
    "we thus may suggest that website popularity follows the zipf law .",
    "we verified that the same modification also works perfectly for the web - document ranked distribution .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ nature ] , we present a brief history of the power laws observed in nature and society .",
    "we describe the data collection and processing in section  [ datasets ] .",
    "we discuss the results in section  [ discussion ] and present our conclusions in section  [ conclusions ] .",
    "more than 100 years ago , pareto  @xcite observed that the income distribution @xmath3 in all countries can be described by the relation    @xmath4    where the exponent @xmath5 and @xmath6 is some constant .",
    "about 70 years ago , george zipf  @xcite discovered a striking regularity in english texts : the relative occurrence frequency @xmath3 of the @xmath7th most popular word is inversely proportional to the rank @xmath7 :    @xmath8    a more general form of zipf law  ( [ zipf - law ] ) with the exponent @xmath9 is often encountered in the literature and is known as a _ zipf - like law _ :",
    "@xmath10    a zipf - like law has been found in many areas of human activity and in nature . among examples",
    "are the distribution of words in random texts  @xcite , of nucleotide `` words '' in dna  @xcite , of bit sequences in unix executable files  @xcite , of book popularities in libraries  @xcite , of countries areas and population sizes  @xcite , of scientific publication citation indices  @xcite , of forest - fire areas  @xcite .",
    "many other examples can be found in recent reviews  @xcite .    meanwhile , there are many discussions whether a lognormal or power law is a better fit for some empirical distributions , for example , income distribution , population fluctuations , file size distribution , and some others ( for a short review , see  @xcite ) . in many cases",
    "a lognormal distribution looks like a power law distribution for a several orders of magnitude  @xcite .",
    "we leave this question open and analyse our data using a zipf - like law .",
    ".characteristics of published web datasets [ cols=\"<,^,^,^ , < , < \" , ]     to check this statement deeper , we also analyze recently available data collected during the period from 11/03/2004 to 12/29/2004 at nine cache - servers of the us national cache - mesh system for science and education built - up within the ircache project  @xcite . table  [ table - setus ] presents data from the following locations :    * _ bo _  ncar at boulder , colorado * _ ny _  new york , new york * _ pa _  digital internet exchange in palo alto , california * _ pb _  psc at pittsburgh , pennsylvania * _ rtp _  research triangle park , north carolina * _ sd _  sdsc at san diego , california * _ sj _  mae west exchange point in san jose , california * _ sv _  nasa - ames / fix - west in silicon valley , california * _ uc _  ncsa at urbana - champaign , illinois .",
    "the second and third entries from the bottom demonstrate the stability of the fit for two subsets of the data collected at _",
    "uc_-location , for 12 days ( set name _ us-12d _ ) and for 1 day ( set _ us-1d _ ) .",
    "the last entry represents the fit to the sum of the preceding data sets .",
    "results of the fit by expression  ( [ bestfit ] ) are close to unity and quite similar to those for russian servers presented in table  [ alpha ] .",
    "we have presented modified zipf law  ( [ bestfit ] ) , which fits the rank distribution of web sites in the full range of ranks rather well .",
    "we found that the value of the exponent @xmath1 in expression  ( [ bestfit ] ) is stable for the analyzed datasets .",
    "it does not vary with ( 1 ) the year of data collection , ( 2 ) the period of data collection , or ( 3 ) the geographical location of the cache server where we collected data .",
    "we found that @xmath1 is very close to @xmath11 .",
    "we have reasons to suppose this value of @xmath1 is a universal property of web - traffic for the website rank . we have also presented a clear explanation of the `` trickle - down effect '' based on the properties of our modified zipf law .",
    "we suggest that website popularity is universal property of internet and follows the zipf law .    in a similar experiment ,",
    "fluctuations of the exponent value were checked  @xcite as a function of the volume of statistics , where cache traces of user requests to different internet domains were analyzed .",
    "user requests were sent to internet through the cache triangle , namely , they went to the master server , which sent each odd request to the left cache and each even request to the right cache .",
    "clearly , the traces should be nearly equal in the limit of a large number of requests .",
    "indeed , it was estimated that exponents extracted separately from the `` left '' traces and `` right '' traces were within five per cent for a set volume larger than ten thousand requests , and that those for set volume less than a few hundred fluctuated strongly .",
    "thus , rare statistics may significantly affect the results .",
    "the results in this paper may be useful for building mirror sites and cdns as well as for improving software for dns request caching .",
    "we also conjecture that fitting with the modified zipf law is suitable for describing the rank distribution of web - document popularity .",
