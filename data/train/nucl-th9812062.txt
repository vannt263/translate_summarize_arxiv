    "many different methods have been used to solve the few - body problem in the past .",
    "one of the most viable approaches appears to be the faddeev method @xcite .",
    "it has been successfully applied to solve the three - nucleon bound - state problem for various nucleon - nucleon potentials @xcite . for solution of the four - nucleon problem",
    "one can employ yakubovsky s generalization of the faddeev formalism @xcite as done , e.g. , in ref .",
    "alternatively , other methods have also been succesfully used in the past , such as , the green s function monte carlo method @xcite or the correlated hyperspherical harmonics expansion method @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "when studying the properties of more complex nuclei one typically resorts to the shell model . in that approach ,",
    "the harmonic - oscillator basis is used in a truncated model space . instead of the free nucleon - nucleon potential ,",
    "one utilizes effective interactions appropriate for the truncated model space .",
    "examples of such calculations are the large - basis no - core shell - model calculations that have recently been performed @xcite . in these calculations",
    "all nucleons are active , which simplifies the effective interaction as no hole states are present .",
    "the effective interaction is determined for a system of two nucleons in a harmonic - oscillator well interacting by the nucleon - nucleon potential and is subsequently used in the many - particle calculations .    in a recent paper",
    "we combined the shell - model approach to the three - nucleon problem with the faddeev formalism @xcite . that allowed us to extend the shell - model calculations to a model space of excitations of @xmath2 above the unperturbed ground state and to study the convergence with respect to the size of the model space .",
    "in the present paper we generalize these earlier calculations to the four - nucleon problem .",
    "we introduce equations for faddeev amplitudes that are fully antisymmetrized for three nucleons . as the center - of - mass term is removed , we are able to work in a model space up to an excitation of @xmath3 above the unperturbed ground state . for comparison the largest shell - model calculations",
    "so far for @xmath1he are those performed by r. ceuleneer et al . , in which a @xmath4 model space was utilized @xcite .",
    "the main motivation for the present work is to test the shell - model approach and the effective interactions derived from realistic nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) potentials that are used in the conventional shell - model applications for more complex systems .",
    "as the equations that we employ can be conveniently used with three - body interactions or three - body effective interactions , we investigate , in addition to two - body effective interactions , also three - body effective interactions in the present formalism .",
    "such effective interactions are not typically used in the traditional applications .",
    "we show that the inclusion of three - body effective interactions improves the overall convergence of the results . at the same time our work serves as an alternative method to solving the four - nucleon problem .",
    "we can study the convergence properties of the results with the increasing size of the model space .",
    "if convergence is achieved , our results will approach the exact solutions obtained by other methods . in our formalism",
    "we seek simultaneously solutions for both the ground - state and the excited states . in the past",
    ", the variational monte carlo method was used to investigate the excited states of @xmath1he using realistic nn potentials @xcite . in most four - nucleon calculations with realistic nn potentials , however , only the ground - state properties were evaluated @xcite . on the other hand , earlier studies that investigated the excited - state properties usually did not employ realistic nn potentials @xcite .",
    "recently , the four - nucleon resonant and scattering states were investigated using realistic nn potentials in the framework of the resonating group method @xcite , the correlated - hyperspherical - harmonics method @xcite as well as in the solution of the faddeev - yakubovsky equations in configuration space @xcite .",
    "the present calculation is simplified by using a compact formula for the matrix elements of the permutation operators in the harmonic - oscillator ( ho ) basis .",
    "also , because of the way we do the model - space truncation , we keep equivalence of the faddeev - like and schrdinger equations throughout the calculation .",
    "in addition to calculation of ground - state and excited state energies and point - nucleon rms radii , we also evaluate electromagnetic ( em ) and strangeness form factors in the impulse approximation .    in section [ sec2 ]",
    "we first discuss the faddeev equations for the shell - model problem of three nucleons .",
    "then a generalization to the four - nucleon system is introduced . in section [ sec3 ]",
    "we present the energy , radii and form factor results for @xmath1he .",
    "conclusions are given in section [ sec4 ] .",
    "in shell - model studies the one- plus two - body hamiltonian for the a - nucleon system , i.e. , @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the nucleon mass and @xmath7 , the nn interaction , is usually modified by adding the center - of - mass ho potential @xmath8 , @xmath9",
    ". this potential does not influence intrinsic properties of the many - body system .",
    "it provides , however , a mean field felt by each nucleon and allows us to work with a convenient ho basis .",
    "the modified hamiltonian , depending on the ho frequency @xmath10 , can be cast into the form @xmath11 + \\sum_{i < j}^a \\left [ v_{\\rm n}(\\vec{r}_i-\\vec{r}_j ) -\\frac{m\\omega^2}{2a } ( \\vec{r}_i-\\vec{r}_j)^2 \\right ] \\ ; .\\ ] ] the one - body term of the hamiltonian ( [ hamomega ] ) can be re - written as a sum of the center - of - mass term , @xmath12 , where @xmath13 , and a term depending only on the relative coordinates . in the present application we use a basis , which explicitly separates center - of - mass and relative - coordinate wave functions .",
    "therefore , the contribution of the center - of - mass term is trivial and will be omitted from now on .",
    "the shell - model calculations are performed in a finite model space .",
    "therefore , the interaction term in eq .",
    "( [ hamomega ] ) must be replaced by an effective interaction . in general , for an @xmath14-nucleon system , an @xmath14-body effective interaction is needed . in practice ,",
    "the effective interaction is usually approximated by a two - body effective interaction . in the present study we will also employ a three - body effective interaction . as approximations",
    "are involved in the effective interaction treatment , large model spaces are desirable . in that case , the calculation should be less affected by any imprecision of the effective interaction .",
    "the same is true for the evaluation of any observable characterized by an operator . in the model space ,",
    "renormalized effective operators are required . the larger the model space , the less renormalization is needed .",
    "we may take advantage of the present approach to perform shell - model calculations in significantly larger model spaces than are possible in the conventional shell - model approach . at the same time we can investigate convergence properties of effective interactions .",

    "@xcite . let us note that it follows from the antisymmetry of the two - nucleon states and from the symmetry properties of the ho brackets that the contributions of @xmath32 and @xmath31 in ( [ t13t23 ] ) are identical .",

    "( [ fadfour ] ) by permuting particle 4 with particles 1 , 2 , and 3 .",
    "their sum then leads to the schrdinger equation .",
    "we note that the present equations are different from the traditional faddeev - yakubovsky equations @xcite , which combine faddeev amplitudes depending on two sets of relative coordinates .",
    "we are working with a complete orthonormal basis .",
    "it is , therefore , sufficient and convenient to use a single set of coordinates defined by the relations ( [ fourtran ] ) . unlike the faddeev amplitudes used typically in the faddeev - yakubovsky equations , the amplitudes appearing in eq .",
    "( [ fadfour ] ) are antisymmetrized with respect to the first three particles .",
    "those amplitudes are obtained , as described below , in a straightforward manner with the help of our three - nucleon ho formalism introduced earlier .",

    "the latter property makes them particularly useful for the present extension of shell - model calculations for four nucleons . at the same time",
    ", the use of faddeev amplitudes antisymmetrized for particles 1 , 2 and 3 allows us to reduce the dimmension of the basis significantly .",

    "( [ t13t23 ] ) the brackets for two particles with mass ratio 3 also appear in the relation ( [ t4 ] ) . in the derivation of the expression ( [ t4 ] ) we relied on the antisymmetry of the basis states with respect to particles 1,2 and 3 .",
    "the calculation was facilitated by application of the operators @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "the relation ( [ t4 ] ) appears to be non - symmetric .",
    "however , its numerical evaluation leads to a symmetric matrix .",
    "it may also appear that the angular momentum sums in ( [ t4 ] ) can be summed up .",
    "in fact , it is possible to simplify the expression by introducing a @xmath66-coefficient of the fifth kind as defined , e.g. , in ref .",
    "@xcite , but , as such coefficients are seldomly used , we prefer to keep the summations in the explicit form . on the other hand , a significant simplification of the expression ( [ t4 ] )",
    "can be obtained , when the symmetry relations of different terms are exploited .",
    "first , it follows from the properties of the ho brackets and from the antisymmetry of the two - nucleon states that the contributions of @xmath67 and @xmath68 are identical .",
    "second , using the fact that the states ( [ fourbas ] ) are antisymmetrized for the particles 1 , 2 and 3 it follows that all three permutation operators appearing in ( [ t4 ] ) give identical contributions to the expression ( [ t4 ] ) .",
    "the computation of @xmath69 is the simplest . in that case",
    "a partial summation of the angular momentum coefficients can be performed , yielding a compact expression @xmath70 thus , by multiplying the expression ( [ t34 ] ) by three we obtain the same matrix element as from ( [ t4 ] ) .",
    "we note that a generalization of the evaluation of the permutation operator matrix element ( [ t34 ] ) to a more complex system , than the presently studied @xmath44 , is straightforward .",
    "its simplicity suggests that the present formalism can be extended to systems with @xmath71 .",
    "similarly , as for the operator @xmath29 ( [ metric ] ) , eigenstates of the operator @xmath72 defined by the relation ( [ metric4 ] ) can be subdivided into two subspaces .",
    "a physical subspace is spanned by totally antisymmetric states , in this case corresponding to the eigenvalue 4 , and a spurious subspace is spanned by eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalue 0 .",
    "it is possible to symmetrize the hamiltonian @xmath73 appearing in eq .",
    "( [ fadfour ] ) on the physical subspace .",
    "the symmetrized hamiltonian then takes the form @xmath74 where @xmath75 operates only on the physical subspace . in our calculations ,",
    "described later , we diagonalize the symmetrized hamiltonian ( [ foureq ] ) in the physical basis formed by the eigenstates of @xmath75 .    the operator @xmath72 ( [ metric4 ] ) is diagonal in @xmath76 .",
    "a basis truncation defined by a restriction on the totally allowed oscillator quanta @xmath42 preserves the equivalence of the hamiltonians ( [ fadham ] ) and ( [ fadhamh ] ) on the physical subspace .      from solving two - nucleon systems in a ho well , interacting by soft - core potentials , one learns that excitations up to about @xmath77 ( @xmath78 ) are required to get almost exact solutions .",
    "we anticipate , therefore , that at least the same number of excitations should be allowed to solve the many - nucleon system .",
    "the faddeev formulation has the obvious advantage compared with the traditional shell - model approach that the center - of - mass coordinate is explicitly removed .",
    "even then , it is not feasible to solve the eigenvalue problem either for ( [ fadhamh ] ) or for ( [ foureq ] ) in such a large space . on the other hand ,",
    "shell - model calculations are always performed by employing effective interactions tailored to a specific model space . in practice , these effective interactions can never be calculated exactly , because , in general , for an a - body effective interaction is required for an a - nucleon system .",
    "we may , however , take advantage of the present approach to perform shell - model calculations in significantly larger model spaces than are possible in conventional shell - model approach . at the same time we can investigate convergence properties of effective interactions .",
    "if convergence is achieved , we should obtain the exact solution , since by construction the effective interactions that we employ satisfy the condition @xmath79 for @xmath80 .",
