    "the search for higgs bosons is one of the principal objectives of present and future high - energy colliders , such as the international linear collider ( ilc ) @xcite , compact linear collider ( clic ) @xcite and large hadron collider ( lhc ) @xcite .",
    "it has been demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite that physics at the lhc and @xmath0 ilc will be complementary to each other in many respects .",
    "in many cases , the ilc can significantly improve the lhc measurements .",
    "the higgs boson @xcite plays an important role in the standard model ( sm ) @xcite because it is responsible for generating the masses of all the elementary particles ( leptons , quarks , and gauge bosons ) .",
    "however , the higgs - boson sector is the least tested in the sm , in particular the higgs boson self - interaction .",
    "if higgs bosons are responsible for breaking the symmetry from @xmath17 to @xmath18 , it is natural to expect that other higgs bosons are also involved in breaking other symmetries .",
    "one of the more attractive extensions of the sm is supersymmetry ( susy ) @xcite , mainly because of its capacity to solve the naturalness and hierarchy problems while maintaining the higgs bosons elementary .",
    "the theoretical framework of this paper is the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model ( mssm ) , which doubles the spectrum of particles of the sm , and the new free parameters obey simple relations .",
    "the scalar sector of the mssm @xcite requires two higgs doublets , thus the remaining scalar spectrum contains the following physical states : two cp - even higgs scalares @xmath19 with @xmath20 , one cp - odd higgs scalar @xmath21 and a charged higgs pair @xmath22 .",
    "the higgs sector is specified at tree - level by fixing two parameters which can be chosen as the mass of the pseudoscalar @xmath23 and the ratio of vacuum expectation values of the two doublets @xmath24 ; then , the masses @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 and the mixing angle of the neutral higgs sector @xmath28 can be fixed . however , since radiative corrections produce substantial effects on the predictions of the model @xcite , it is necessary to also specify the squark masses , which are assumed to be degenerated .    in particular , all the triple self - couplings of the physical higgs particles can be predicted ( at the tree level ) in terms of @xmath23 and @xmath29 .",
    "once a light higgs boson is discovered , the measurement of these triple couplings can be used to reconstruct the higgs potential of the mssm .",
    "the triple higgs self - couplings can be measured directly in pair - production of higgs particles at hadron and high energy @xmath0 colliders . in proton collisions at the lhc @xcite",
    ", higgs pairs can be produced through double higgs - strahlung off @xmath30 and @xmath31 bosons , @xmath32 and @xmath33 fusion , and gluon - gluon fusion .",
    "the triple higgs boson couplings are involved in a large number of processes at @xmath0 collider @xcite :    @xmath34 ,   \\nonumber \\\\",

    "the mssm higgs bosons are radiated by @xmath38 and @xmath39 quarks at future @xmath0 colliders @xcite with a c.m .",
    "energy in the range of 500 to 1600 @xmath12 , as in the case of the ilc @xcite and of 3 @xmath16 to the clic machine @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we study the pair - production as well as the triple self - couplings of the higgs bosons of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) at the future international linear @xmath0 collider ( ilc ) @xcite and compact linear collider ( clic ) @xcite .",
    "the analysis is based on the reactions @xmath40 with @xmath2 .",
    "we evaluate the total cross - section for both @xmath3 , @xmath4 and calculate the total number of events considering the complete set of feynman diagrams at tree - level .",
    "we vary the triple couplings @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 within the range @xmath11 and + 2",
    ". the numerical computation is done for the energies expected to be available at the ilc with a center - of - mass energy 500 , 1000 , 1600 @xmath12 and a luminosity 1000 @xmath13 .",
    "our analysis is also extended to a center - of - mass energy 3 @xmath16 and luminosities of 1000 @xmath13 and 5000 @xmath13 .",
    "we consider @xmath41 and @xmath42 @xmath12 .",
    "the higgs couplings with quarks , the largest couplings in the mssm , are directly accessible in the processes where the higgs boson is radiated off bottom quarks , @xmath43 as well as in the processes @xmath44 where the higgs boson is radiated off top quarks .",
    "these processes depend on the higgs boson triple self - couplings , which could lead us to obtain the first non - trivial information on the higgs potential .",
    "we are interested in finding regions that could allow the observation of the @xmath45 and @xmath46 processes at future linear @xmath0 colliders energies : ilc and clic .",
    "we consider the complete set of feynman diagrams at tree - level ( figs .",
    "[ f1]-[f3 ] ) and use the calchep @xcite packages to evaluate the amplitudes and cross - sections of the processes @xmath47 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii , the higgs boson interaction lagrangian and the self - couplings are presented . in sec .",
    "iii , we study the triple higgs boson self - coupling through the processes @xmath48 and @xmath49 at future @xmath0 colliders energies ( ilc / clic ) and , finally , we summarize our results in sec .",
    "the higgs sector of mssm includes five physical fields : two neutral cp - even higgs scalar @xmath19 , one neutral cp - odd higgs scalar @xmath21 and a charged higgs pair @xmath22 .",
    "the higgs boson interaction lagrangian has the form    @xmath50    where @xmath51 is the lagrangian of the triple higgs boson interactions , while @xmath52 is the lagrangian of the quartic higgs boson interactions .",
    "explicitly , @xmath51 is :    @xmath53    the triple higgs self - coupling of the mssm can be parameterized as @xcite ,    @xmath54    where @xmath55 and the connection between the mixing angles @xmath28 and @xmath56 is given by    @xmath57    as a function of @xmath23 and @xmath29 .",
    "in this section we present numerical results for @xmath58 and @xmath59 with double higgs bosons production .",
    "we carry out the calculations using the framework of the minimal supersymmetric standard model at the future linear @xmath0 colliders .",
    "we use the calchep @xcite packages for calculations of the matrix elements and cross - sections . these packages provide automatic computation of the cross - sections and distributions in the mssm as well as their extensions at tree - level .",
    "we consider the high energy stage of a possible future linear @xmath0 collider ( ilc ) with @xmath60 @xmath12 and design luminosity 1000 @xmath13 .",
    "for the numerical computation , we have adopted the following parameters : the angle of weinber @xmath61 , the mass ( @xmath62 @xmath12 ) of the bottom quark , the mass ( @xmath63 @xmath12 ) of the top quark , the mass ( @xmath64 @xmath12 ) of the @xmath65 , the mass ( @xmath66 @xmath12 ) of the cp - odd higgs scalar and @xmath41 .      to illustrate our results on the sensitivity to the @xmath68 triple modified higgs bosons self - coupling , we show the @xmath69 dependence of the total cross - section for @xmath58 in fig .  [ f4 ] .",
    "we consider one representative value of the higgs boson mass , @xmath42 @xmath12 , and @xmath41 with a center - of - mass energy of @xmath60 gev and vary the triple couplings @xmath70 within the range @xmath11 and @xmath71 . in all cases ,",
    "the cross - section is sensitive to the value of the triple couplings , as well as in the case of the process @xmath72 , where for large values of @xmath23 ( the decoupling limit ) , the corresponding mssm triple coupling approaches the sm triple coupling @xcite .",
    "however , the cross - section and its sensibility to @xmath73 decrease with increasing collider energy for @xmath74 , while for @xmath75 , the sensitivity to @xmath76 and @xmath77 increases with rising collider energy .",
    "in particular , we can see in fig .",
    "[ f5 ] for @xmath58 , the maximum cross - section ( for @xmath42 @xmath12 and @xmath41 ) is reached for @xmath78 @xmath12 and @xmath79 @xmath12 respectively , which is consistent with ref .",
    "@xcite in the case where @xmath80 is identified as the higgs boson of the standard model . as an indicator of the order of magnitude , in tables  [ t1]-[t3 ] we present the higgs boson number of events ( we have to multiplicate by the corresponding branching ratios to obtain the observable number of events ) for several higgs boson masses @xmath23 , center - of - mass energy and @xmath69 values and for a luminosity of @xmath81 .",
    "if we consider the @xmath82 decay for @xmath83 @xmath12 , we have some opportunity to detect this process . in this region",
    ", the number of events is small but sufficient to detect @xmath84 .",
    "the @xmath85 and the background for 6 b - jet are small .    finally , for completeness , in fig .  [ f6 ]",
    "we include a contour plot for the number of events of the studied processes as a function of @xmath86 and @xmath69 with @xmath87 @xmath12 and @xmath41 .",
    "these contour are obtained from tables  [ t1]-[t3 ] .",
    "because in major parts of the mssm parameter space the neutral higgs bosons @xmath88 and @xmath89 are quite heavy , it is difficult to detect the processes @xmath90 when the relevant mechanism is @xmath91 , as shown in the number of events given in tables  [ t1]-[t3 ] .",
    ".total production of higgs boson pairs in the mssm for @xmath41 , @xmath92 @xmath13 and @xmath93 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "@xmath0 linear colliders represent a possible opportunity for the triple higgs boson self - coupling analysis .",
    "therefore , we have analyzed the neutral higgs bosons self - couplings with a complete set of the tree - level feynman diagrams in the framework of the mssm .",
    "the dependence of the triple higgs bosons self - coupling @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 on @xmath29 and energy @xmath86 were evaluated .",
    "the extended higgs spectrum in supersymmetric theories gives rise to a plethora of triple couplings .",
    "the @xmath100 coupling is generally quite different from the one expected in the standard model .",
    "it can be measured in higgs double production at future international linear @xmath0 colliders ( ilc ) . even though the @xmath0 cross sections are below the hadronic cross sections , the strongly reduced number of background events renders the search easier for the higgs - pair signal , through @xmath101 final states for instance , in the @xmath0 environment than in jetty lhc final states . for sufficiently high luminosities",
    "the first phase of these colliders with an energy of 500 @xmath12 will allow the experimental analysis of self - couplings for higgs bosons in the intermediate mass range .",
    "other couplings between heavy and light mssm higgs bosons can be measured as well , though only in restricted areas of the ( @xmath102 ) plane as illustrated in the sets of figs .",
    "[ f6 ] and  [ f9 ] .    in summary",
    ", we have analyzed the triple higgs bosons self - coupling at future @xmath103 colliders energies , with the reactions @xmath58 and @xmath104 .",
    "the first is the most important after considering the @xmath80 decay , and is statistically sufficient for an accurate determination of @xmath69 . in the case of @xmath59 , after we consider the @xmath36 and @xmath80 decays the final number of events is small ; although they produce a non - vanishing number of events , statistically it is insufficient for the determination of @xmath69 . in these conditions",
    "the number of events is small but our results have never been reported in the literature before and could be of relevance for the scientific community ."
