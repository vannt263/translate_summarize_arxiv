    "a _ quantum hybrid _ is defined as a manifold obtained by gluing surfaces of different dimensionality . on this manifold",
    "the dynamics is described by a schrdinger equation .",
    "this kind of models have had considerable success in the literature for many reasons : they are descriptive models for quantum dynamics of microscopic mechanisms as for example semiconductors or quantum dots ( see @xcite ) , for the analysis of a microwave cavity ( see @xcite ) , and for models of quantum point - contact spectroscopy ( see @xcite , @xcite ) .    from the theoretical point of view",
    "the hybrids are interesting because the conduction of quantum particles inside the hybrid is strictly related to the formation of quantum resonances , as in the case of quantum wires . starting from some simplified models ( see @xcite )",
    "the development and refinement of spectral analysis techniques has allowed the possibility to consider more and more complicated structure or interactions ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . in this paper",
    "we apply results obtained in the case of models with point interactions and formation of resonances ( see @xcite,@xcite , @xcite ) .    in the model presented in this paper ,",
    "we first consider the spectral characterization for a wedge with a convex angle and dirichlet boundary condition .",
    "using the results in @xcite we obtain a family of self - adjoint non - friedrichs dirichlet laplacians realizations corresponding to dirichlet boundary conditions at all the points of the boundary except the corner . this allows to create a quantum hybrid with a half - line attached at the vertex of the not convex corner , using standard technique of the theory of self - adjoint extensions of symmetric operators .",
    "the concentration of the non - friedrichs eigenvectors around the vertex imply the formation of resonances and non trivial scattering properties .",
    "let us remark that this phenomenon is almost singular due to the dirichlet boundary condition for the wedge and that all the dynamical parameters , as the transmission and reflection coefficient , will depend explicitly on the parameter @xmath0 related to the measure @xmath1 of the interior angle of the wedge by @xmath2 .",
    "this makes this device `` tunable '' in the sense that the transitions from the half - line to the plane can be modulated by a variation of @xmath3 .",
    "in this section , following ( * ? ? ? * section 2 ) ( also see ( * ? ? ? * section 10.1 ) ) , we recall the definitions of the family of self - adjoint non - friedrichs dirichlet laplacians for a non - convex ( i.e. @xmath4 ) planar wedge @xmath5 let @xmath6 denote the linear given by the restriction of @xmath7 , the distributional laplacian on @xmath8 , to the domain @xmath9 by green s formula , @xmath6 is clearly symmetric ; however , since @xmath10 is not convex , @xmath6 is not self - adjoint ( see @xcite ) . indeed",
    "the kernel of @xmath11 is one dimensional and is generated by the function @xmath12 the unique ( up to the multiplication by a constant ) solution of the boundary value problem @xmath13 for later convenience we also consider @xmath14 , the solution of the boundary value problem @xmath15 for any @xmath16 such that @xmath17 , @xmath18 denoting the bessel function of order @xmath19 , @xmath14 is given by @xmath20 where @xmath21 denotes euler s gamma function . here",
    "the constants are chosen in order to have @xmath22 as @xmath23 and we use the determination of @xmath24 such that @xmath25 .",
    "by @xmath26 ( here @xmath27 ) , one has @xmath28 and so @xmath29 the set ext@xmath30 of self - adjoint extensions of @xmath31 is given by @xmath32 here @xmath33 denotes the friedrichs extension of @xmath34 , i.e. @xmath35 , where @xmath36 and @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 denotes the renormalized trace ( evaluation ) at the vertex @xmath40 the operator @xmath41 acts on its domain as the distributional laplacian , @xmath42 notice that @xmath43 and @xmath44 whenever @xmath45 and @xmath46 . using @xmath47 and @xmath14 we define the kren @xmath48-function for the wedge by @xmath49 since @xmath50 ( see e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* equation ( a.2 ) ) ) , by one gets @xmath51 for any @xmath52 the kernel of the resolvent @xmath53 is given by @xmath54 where @xmath55 denotes the resolvent kernel of the friedrichs - dirichlet laplacian @xmath56 , i.e. @xmath57 here @xmath58 denotes the @xmath59-th strictly positive zero of @xmath60 and @xmath61 is the normalized eigenfunctions of @xmath56 corresponding to the eigenvalue @xmath62 .",
    "notice that , since @xmath63 has only real zeroes , both @xmath64 and @xmath65 are well defined for any @xmath66 , @xmath67 .",
    "since @xmath68 if and only if @xmath69 , by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* example 3.1 ) , one gets @xmath70 thus @xmath71 where @xmath72 @xmath73 ( here @xmath74 denotes the modified bessel function of the first kind ) , @xmath75 by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* relations ( a.1 ) and ( a.3 ) ) one has @xmath76 here and below @xmath77 and @xmath78 denote the scalar product and the corresponding norm in @xmath79 .",
    "therefore @xmath80 and so the map @xmath81 is strictly increasing on @xmath82 . since @xmath83",
    ", @xmath84 one has @xmath85 the set @xmath86 is a nonempty singleton , @xmath87 if and only if @xmath88 and @xmath89 is nonempty if and only if @xmath90 .",
    "special cases are the following : @xmath91 @xmath92 @xmath93",
    "in this section we analyze the spectral and scattering properties related to a manifold obtained by gluing the wedge with an half - line .",
    "this procedure has been widely studied in literature ; the procedure allowing to paste varieties with different dimensionality is discussed in several papers ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the peculiarity of the present model lays in the fact that the sticking point is the vertex of the wedge , and along its boundary , outside the vertex itself , dirichlet boundary condition hold . in general , in this configuration , it is usually impossible to obtain a hybrid with non - trivial properties .",
    "however the appearing of resonances shows that this procedure can be applied .",
    "this model shows also an interesting tunability : the opening angle of the wedge , in a suitable range of values , will influence the spectral properties .",
    "the hilbert space for the hybrid is @xmath94 the functions in @xmath95 will be written as @xmath96 .",
    "as hamiltonian on the half - line ( the lead ) we will take the operator @xmath97 , where @xmath98 denotes the laplacian @xmath99 with neumann boundary condition at the endpoint .",
    "for the wedge we will consider the hamiltonian @xmath100 .",
    "the kernel of the resolvent @xmath101 , @xmath102 , is given by @xmath103 as before we use the determination of @xmath24 such that @xmath25 .",
    "the corresponding kren @xmath48-function for the lead is @xmath104 for the construction of the hybrid we will follow a standard procedure for the construction of self - adjoint extensions ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite for the general theory and @xcite , @xcite for hybrids ) starting from the green function of the decoupled system .",
    "we define the boundary maps @xmath105 , @xmath106 , by @xmath107 where @xmath108 notice that @xmath109 is a boundary triple ( see e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 14 ) ) for the symmetric operator @xmath110 , where @xmath111 is the minimal realization of @xmath112 , i.e. @xmath113 introducing the symmetric matrix @xmath114 and the kren @xmath48-function for the hybrid @xmath115 one then obtains the self - adjoint hamiltonian @xmath116 on the hybrid defined by @xmath117 and the kernel of the resolvent @xmath118 , @xmath119 , is @xmath120 let us consider preliminarly the case @xmath121 . from ( [ greenhyb ] ) we get the operator @xmath122 for the decoupled case , where @xmath123 is the self - adjoint operator describing a point interaction of strength @xmath124 placed at the endpoint of the half - line ; the operator is diagonal and there is no interaction between the two components . in this case @xmath125",
    "@xmath126 @xmath127 notice that @xmath128 whenever @xmath129 , otherwise @xmath130 .",
    "let us now discuss what happens to the eigenvalues embedded in the continuos part of the spectrum after the hybridization .",
    "the positive eigenvalues in @xmath131 relative to the friedrichs extension are unaffected by the hybridization except for the fact that they are embedded in the continuos spectrum of @xmath132 .",
    "the positive eigenvalues in @xmath133 are also embedded in the continuous spectrum and for @xmath134 they can eventually move from the real line .",
    "they will correspond to the solutions of @xmath135 we resume the spectral properties for the hybrid in the following    the spectrum of @xmath116 is given by :    * the essential and absolutely continuous spectra @xmath136 ; * the discrete spectrum @xmath137 ; * the point spectrum @xmath138 ; * the continuous spectrum @xmath139 .",
    "moreover    * there are infinitely many resonances @xmath140 where @xmath141 is a positive non - friedrichs eigenvalue of @xmath142 and @xmath143 is explicitly given below in .",
    "since @xmath116 is a rank two resolvent perturbation of @xmath144 , the preservation of the essential and absolutely continuous spectrum spectrum is consequence of the weyl and of kato - birman criteria : @xmath145 @xmath146 from the structure of the resolvent it is clear that the eigenvalues of @xmath33 in @xmath131 are unperturbed by the formation of the hybrid while the other ones , belonging to @xmath147 , are in @xmath148 ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* example 3.1 ) ) .",
    "the only others points in the spectrum are given by the singularities of @xmath149 , i.e. by the solutions of the equation ( [ nf ] ) @xmath150 by a direct computation one can easily check that there are no square integrable solutions of the equation @xmath151 , so that @xmath152 .",
    "the wedge eigenvalues of the unperturbed hamiltonian , corresponding to @xmath153 , are all simple , and since the perturbation is of finite rank in the resolvent sense , continuity of the singularities with respect to @xmath154 is guaranteed .",
    "preliminarily we examine qualitatively the solutions of .",
    "we can rewrite ( [ nf ] ) with @xmath155 as @xmath156 this equation can not be solved by any real positive @xmath157 because on the left - hand side we have always a real positive number while on the right - hand side is always purely imaginary : any solution of this equation lies outside the real axis .",
    "the singularities of the resolvent , in the weak coupling regime , can be found as a series expansion in @xmath154 using a recursive procedure . to begin with we rewrite the equation as @xmath158 in the next recursive procedure we denote by @xmath159 the eigenvalues in @xmath133 ( so that @xmath160 ) and we look for the fixed points of the equations ( here we use ) @xmath161 in this way we can determine the position of the singularities in the leading order in @xmath154 .",
    "we will start from @xmath162 and evaluate the fixed points with the recursive procedure , from ( [ rec ] ) . at the end",
    "we have a positive real part and a negative imaginary part ; in a leading order in @xmath154 the resonances @xmath163 are given by , where @xmath164 the convergence of the sequence in a ball of radius @xmath165 centered at @xmath162 can be proved using the following estimates , @xmath166 where the constants @xmath167 and @xmath168 are independent of @xmath154 .",
    "the results of the previous theorem are shown in the following plots obtained numerically .     with @xmath169     with @xmath169     with @xmath170,width=226 ]    as it is usual in many models involving resonance problems ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) for large values of the coupling constant @xmath154 the resonance can approach an eigenvalue again : this is due to the fact that that @xmath116 reduces in the limit @xmath171 to @xmath172 .",
    "an interesting feature of this model is that , as evidenced by the ( [ weakres ] ) and by figure ( [ angledep ] ) , the spectral properties are related to the value of the geometric parameter @xmath3 . in this way it is possible to tune the conduction along the hybrid by the variation of @xmath3 .    using the formula for the rank two resolvent difference @xmath173 given in and results provided in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 4.3.2 ) ( see also @xcite ) , it is possible to write the scattering matrix @xmath174 , @xmath175 , explicitly in terms of the kren @xmath48-function and the parameters @xmath176 , @xmath177 , @xmath3 and @xmath178 : @xmath179 putting @xmath180 , @xmath181 , we can describe the reflection amplitude of a particle travelling along the halfline as    @xmath182",
    "in this paper we have shown that it is possible to build a quantum hybrid consisting of a particular structure that allows to glue an half - line to the edge of a domain with dirichlet boundary conditions .",
