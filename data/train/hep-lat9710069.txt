    "the mass spectrum of quarkonia with valence bottom and charm quarks are interesting in a number of aspects . though only a handful of events have been detected , upcoming b - factories should produce copious amounts of them .",
    "hence , we are put in the interesting circumstance of making a _",
    "pre_-diction rather than a _",
    "post_-diction for non  exotic hadron masses . as they interpolate the non - relativistic bottomonium states and fully relativistic heavy  light states such as the @xmath0 and @xmath1 they provide an interesting probe of qcd dynamics .",
    "of course , the calculation of these masses are also a first step in the calculation of decay constants and semi - leptonic widths , and these are of interest phenomenologically as an accurate calculation of @xmath2 is crucial to obtaining as accurate as possible a result for @xmath3 from lep data @xcite and the semi  leptonic decay @xmath4 will give another estimate of the matrix element @xmath5 , which will be seen at the lhc - b @xcite .",
    "previous quenched lattice calculations of the @xmath6 spectrum @xcite has been carried out at @xmath7 , where both valence quarks are simulated using the non - relativistic formalism @xcite . on such coarse lattices ,",
    "@xmath8 and @xmath9 and the effective green s functions for both quark masses can be calculated without introducing large radiative corrections to the hamiltonian .",
    "however , it has been demonstrated that for such lattice spacings the charmonium spectrum is not reproduced very accurately .",
    "for quenched gluon fields at @xmath10 , quenched one can still use the non - relativistic approach for the @xmath11 quarks and the relativistic formalism can now be used for treating the @xmath12 quark .",
    "as one expects the dominant errors to be a function of @xmath13 , which still approaches 1 , we use the sheikholeslami  wohlert action @xcite , using a mean - field estimate of the clover coefficient @xmath14 . while not eliminating all errors up to @xmath15 , this mean field estimate approach",
    "does reduce errors significantly @xcite .",
    "on a @xmath16 lattice at @xmath10 , corresponding to a lattice spacing of approximately @xmath17 , two point functions were constructed for the following states ; @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 ( using the notation @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the radial excitation ) . the operators were calculated using coulomb gauge fixed smeared sources@xcite . in order to maximise the statistics ,",
    "the non - relativistic green s functions were calculated forwards and backwards in time , so that as many of the componants of the relativistic propagator could be used .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in table [ tab : masses ] the quark mass parameters and the number of configurations are listed .",
    "we note that @xmath24 and @xmath25 correspond roughly to charm and bottom quark masses from studies of charmonium and bottomonium systems respectively .",
    "the nrqcd hamiltonian was corrected to @xmath26 , using tadpole improved estimates of the relevant coefficients .",
    "as the configurations are quenched , the lattice spacing should be determined from one of the @xmath6 observables .",
    "as the splitting @xmath27 for charmonium and bottomonium only changes by a few mev , we took an average of these splittings and hence assumed that @xmath28 .",
    "one expects that the @xmath20 and @xmath29 states to mix ( this has been observed at @xmath7 @xcite and with two relativistic propagators at higher @xmath30 s with different masses around that of charm ) .",
    "therefore we calculated the following matrix of correlators @xmath31 however , for all three combinations of quark masses , the off  diagonal elements of this matrix were very noisy and were consistent with zero .",
    "in figure [ fig : com_vs_beta ] the results for the @xmath6 spectrum using the the best estimates for the bottom and charm quark masses are compared with the previous lattice calculation at @xmath7 @xcite and a potential model calculation @xcite .",
    "the @xmath32 states at both @xmath30 s are consistent with each other . for the @xmath33-wave states , where we have a measurement of the @xmath34 states , the agreement is to within two standard deviations , albeit with large errors .",
    "the potential model calculation agrees with the lattice results except for the hyperfine splitting .",
    "it is not clear whether this difference is due any systematic error in the potential model or by a choice of the scale using @xmath35 .    in figure",
    "[ fig : comp_vs_mass ] the results for the @xmath6 spectrum for different combinations of quark masses at @xmath10 are shown . once again .",
    "there is a general broad agreement . for the splittings , we find that the splittings behave as expected .",
    "for example , in figure [ fig : threesone_mass ] we see that as the @xmath11 quark mass is increased , and the system behaves more like a heavy - light @xmath36 state the splitting tends to zero . likewise , the fine splitting ( in figure [ fig : threepone_oneszero_mass ] ) is constant , indicating that @xmath35 should be insensitive to variations in the quark masses .",
    "it is very promising that the quenched lattice results at two different lattice spacings are in good agreement with each other , despite potential concerns over the size of the discretisation error at @xmath7 .",
    "the broad agreement with potential models is also quite interesting as it is not clear that a semi - relativistic system such as this could be modelled with a simple potential .",
    "given the amount of research that has been done on the @xmath37 and @xmath38 spectrum , it would be interesting to see how the splittings of these states vary as the masses of the quarks are changed .",
    "the absence of mixing between the @xmath29 and @xmath20 states at @xmath10 is quite strange , given its presence at @xmath7 .",
    "it is of course possible that the mixing is a strong function of the lattice spacing and that the mixing is very small in the continuum .",
    "this would give a qualitatively different result from potential models . in order to verify",
    "if this is true , the calculation should be repeated using some other set of operators , defined in a different gauge or a gauge invariant fashion .",
