    "multiple light fields during inflation automatically widens the narrow predictions of single - field inflation for now there are multiple entropy perturbations @xcite-@xcite which are , in general , correlated to some degree with the standard adiabatic mode @xcite-@xcite .",
    "correlations are produced when the valley of the effective potential is curved @xcite and this also leads to non - gaussianity @xcite .",
    "since the effective masses of the various fields typically depend on the vacuum expectation values of the other ( dynamical ) fields these are time - dependent and can cause violations of standard slow - roll conditions and spectral indices for the perturbations which run with scale @xcite .",
    "this is a crucial aspect of this present work because previous analyses of correlated adiabatic and entropy ( isocurvature ) perturbations have always assumed power - law spectra for all the perturbations @xcite .",
    "when applied to the wmap data they found that with standard priors on cosmological parameters the degree of correlation allowed is small ( although see @xcite ) . allowing running of the spectral index , at least in the supersymmetric hybrid models we study , does not change this conclusion .",
    "the code we have developed allows us to numerically study any inflationary model without approximation ( except in the treatment of spinodal / tachyonic instabilities ) and builds on that used in @xcite .",

    "it is important to solve the perturbation equations without approximation right up to the end of inflation , since the curvature perturbation is not necessarily conserved after hubble radius crossing @xcite , unlike the case of single - field inflation .    the resulting data : @xmath29 given at a wave number of @xmath30 , @xmath31 , are optimally fitted with a polynomial function @xmath32 by minimizing @xmath33 .    for each set of parameters",
    "we derive the best - fit coefficients @xmath34 for each of the three power spectra .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the coefficients @xmath35 and @xmath36 are intimately linked to the spectral index @xmath37 and its running of scalar perturbations by the relations @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "we check that our fitting method agrees very well with numerically obtained power spectra and is sufficient to accurately capture any running of the spectral index over cosmologically relevant scales .",

    "we assume spatial flatness , so @xmath64 .",
    "it is well - known that the allowed ranges for these parameters has a large impact on the acceptable amount of correlated isocurvature perturbations @xcite .",

    "let us consider a fairly realistic multi - field inflation model with potential @xmath70 corresponding to the original version of the hybrid inflation @xcite .",
    "this is closely linked with those obtained in supersymmetric theories @xcite , which generically leads to a very strong correlation between the adiabatic and isocurvature perturbations due to the presence of a tachyonic instability between the two phases of inflation @xcite . in this work",
    "we concentrate on the supersymmetric case with @xmath71 .",
    "then we have three potential parameters : @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 , which are constrained by our likelihood analysis .",
    "we can have two stages of inflation for the potential ( [ po ] ) depending upon the model parameters .",
    "one corresponds to the stage with @xmath75 driven by the slow - roll evolution of @xmath1 during which the potential is approximately described by @xmath76 .",
    "another inflationary stage is the one with @xmath77 driven by the field @xmath2 with a tachyonic instability .    when the condition @xmath78 is satisfied , then @xmath79 , and so the hubble rate is roughly constant with a value @xmath80 , around @xmath81 ( here @xmath82 is the planck mass ) .",
    "we can estimate the condition for double inflation by estimating the effective masses of the two fields , i.e. , @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "double inflation occurs when both of the masses of the two fields are smaller than @xmath85 , which gives the condition @xmath86    we are mainly interested in the double inflation scenario in which the second stage of inflation occurs after the symmetry breaking . since @xmath87 is smaller than @xmath85 around @xmath81 , the field @xmath2 is hardly suppressed during the first stage of inflation , unless @xmath1 is not too much larger than @xmath88 .    on the other hand , when @xmath89 , the field @xmath2 is exponentially suppressed for @xmath90 and rapidly waterfalls toward the global minimum of the potential after symmetry breaking",
    "this corresponds to the original version of the hybrid inflation without a second stage of inflation @xcite .    in this case",
    "the homogeneous mode of @xmath2 can be vanishingly small relative to its fluctuations , so the analysis using linear perturbations is not fully trustworthy . in our work the linear perturbation equations in ref .",
    "@xcite are used to evaluate the three power spectra at the end of inflation .",
    "while the system is stable for the parameter range in which double inflation occurs , we found a strong numerical instability for perturbations in the tachyonic instability region when the field @xmath2 is strongly suppressed before symmetry breaking .",
    "thus the latter case is effectively excluded from our analysis . in this case",
    "we need to account for the effect of diffusion using e.g. , a fokker planck equation @xcite , but we do not consider this here .    in order to constrain the double inflation model given by ( [ po ] ) , we perform a likelihood analysis over 9 parameters : 5 inflationary @xmath91 and 4 cosmological @xmath92 .",
    "a grid - based analysis over all 9 parameters would require a great deal of time and computing resources , and would still lead to very coarse sampling of the parameter space .",
    "instead we conducted the analysis using a markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) approach .",
    "we ran independent chains on different hpc facilities and used the gelman and rubin statistic to test for convergence and mixing of our mcmc chains , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "our 2d likelihood plots show two different results for the 1 and 2-@xmath93 contours @xcite .",
    "the filled contours are computed by binning the mcmc chains , and drawing contours around points where the likelihood @xmath94 has dropped to 0.32 ( 1-@xmath93 ) and 0.05 ( 2-@xmath93 ) respectively to denote the standard statistical estimate of likelihood ( @xmath95 ) in order to distinguish it from the square of the @xmath2 field . ] .    on the other hand ,",
    "the unfilled line contours show the regions which contain @xmath96 ( 1-@xmath93 ) and @xmath97 ( 2-@xmath93 ) of all the points in our chains ( after burn - in phases are removed ) .",
    "we define the burn - in point for a chain to be the place where the @xmath94 of the chain drops below the global median @xmath94 for the first time , as in @xcite .      in fig.[2dinf ]",
    "we show the 2-dimensional likelihood plots for various combinations of dimensionless inflationary parameters : @xmath98 and @xmath99 . from the left panel it is clear that the 2-@xmath93 likelihood area is clustered in a small region around @xmath100 .",
    "the square of the effective mass of @xmath2 relative to @xmath101 is given as @xmath102 for @xmath100 . therefore @xmath103 is smaller than @xmath85 for @xmath77 , which means that the second stage of inflation occurs after the symmetry breaking .",
    "when @xmath100 , the condition ( [ double1 ] ) translates into @xmath104 . from the right panel of fig.[2dinf",
    "] one finds that @xmath105 varies in the range @xmath106 , in which case the condition for the first stage of inflation is satisfied .",

    "we show @xmath107 and @xmath108 contour bounds from @xmath94 data ( shaded contours ) and the contours which contain @xmath96 and @xmath97 of all the points in our mc chains ( solid lines , see discussion in the text ) .",

    "this means that initial values of @xmath1 close to @xmath81 are favoured .",
    "since @xmath87 is much larger than @xmath85 for @xmath112 , the field @xmath2 is strongly suppressed for the initial conditions @xmath113 .",

    "a natural question is whether the extra complexity and fine - tuning involved in double inflation is actually preferred by the data over standard single - field inflation .",
    "this can be addressed by using the akaike information criterion ( aic ) and bayesian information criterion ( bic ) @xcite .",
    "these two criteria are defined as : @xmath130 here @xmath131 is the maximum value of the likelihood , @xmath132 is the number of parameters and @xmath133 is the number of wmap data points .",
    "the optimal model minimises the aic or bic . in the limit of large @xmath134",
    ", aic tends to favour models with more parameters while bic more strongly penalises them ( since the second term diverges in this limit ) .",
    "bic provides an estimate of the posterior evidence of a model assuming no prior information .",
    "hence bic is a useful approximation to a full evidence calculation when we have no prior on the set of models ( in this case single versus double inflation ) . in this case , we have no strong reason _ a priori _ to favour double inflation over single field inflation so bic provides sensible approximation to a full evidence calculation .",
    "our double inflation model has 5 inflationary parameters ( @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath72 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 ) .",
    "we compare this with a single - field scenario with potential @xmath135 this has 3 inflationary parameters ( @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath25 ) .",
    "there are also 4 cosmological parameters , common to both models . in table",
    "[ criteriatable ] we show the best - fit @xmath94 and the values taken by the criteria for the models we have considered .",

    "however both the aic and bic values for double inflation are significantly larger than those in the latter case , which suggests that single - field inflation is favoured relative to double inflation .",
    "in addition one could argue that single light - field inflation should theoretically be preferred _ a priori _ since it does not require fine - tuning to achieve more than one field to be light relative to the hubble constant . adding this",
    "prior will further favour single - field inflation .",
    "we have only included wmap data .",
    "evidence for running of the spectral index from wmap and lyman-@xmath137 data @xcite would favour double inflation models in which tilt is generic @xcite",
    ". however evidence for running is currently weak @xcite and hence should not affect our conclusions significantly .",
    "strong evidence for running in future data might change the situation however .",
    "in this paper we have studied observational constraints on double inflation using the wmap first year data .",
    "the model we adopted is the supersymmetric hybrid potential given in eq .",
    "( [ po ] ) .",
    "the presence of a tachyonic instability region after symmetry breaking leads to the correlation between adiabatic and isocurvature perturbations , which can significantly alter the cmb power spectrum compared to the case of adiabatic perturbations alone .    comparing with first year wmap cmb data we found that the correlated isocurvature component can be at most @xmath0 of the total contribution which is dominated by the adiabatic spectrum .",
    "we carried out likelihood analysis in terms of 5 inflationary parameters and 4 cosmological parameters .",
    "the likelihood values of inflationary parameters are clustered in a narrow region around @xmath138 , @xmath100 and @xmath139 ( see fig.[2dinf ] ) .    in spite of the large number of freedom of model parameters relative to single - field inflation , the parameter space of double inflation is severely constrained .",
    "this comes from the fact that it is not so easy to satisfy all constraints including cobe normalization and sufficiently suppressed isocurvature perturbations .",
    "we also found that the number of @xmath26-folds in the second stage of inflation are constrained to lie in the range @xmath117 .",
    "loss of power on large scales ( relevant to achieving suppressed cmb low multipoles ) is possible when the number of @xmath26-folds is around @xmath128 .",
    "we also compared double inflation with single - field inflation by using the akaike ( aic ) and bayesian information criteria ( bic ) .",
    "while the minimum value of @xmath94 in double inflation is slightly smaller than in single - field inflation , the information criteria strongly support single - field inflation over the supersynmmetric hybrid double inflation models we studied .",
    "nevertheless we need to caution that the minimum @xmath94 is still larger than the number of data points @xmath134 in current observations .",
    "we expect that future high - precision data such as the planck satellite will provide more sophisticated information to distinguish between double inflation and single - field inflation .    in this regard",
    "it will be interesting to extend our analysis to include more fields , so that the matter power spectrum can exhibit sharp features , and to allow more realistic treatment of reheating . both of these will increase the number of inflationary parameters ( by about 2 or 3 each ) and it is difficult to imagine them producing smaller values of the aic and bic as a result .",
    "it seems likely therefore that single field inflation will continue to be the scenario to beat .",
    "it is intriguing that both the early and late universe seem well - described by very simple inflationary stages , and perhaps even two pure de sitter phases . finding a theoretical basis for this perplexing high - energy / low - energy duality may become a dominant quest in cosmology in the coming years .",
