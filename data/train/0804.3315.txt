    "coherent resonant excitation represents an important notion in quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "resonant pulses of specific pulse areas are widely used in a variety of fields in quantum physics , including nuclear magnetic resonance , coherent atomic excitation , quantum information , and others .",
    "resonant excitation allows to establish a full control over the quantum system , particularly in a two - state system , and realize any unitary transformation ( qubit rotation ) in it .",
    "particularly important transformations include complete population transfer ( transition probability @xmath0 ) , complete population return ( @xmath1 ) and hadamard transformation ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "crucial conditions for resonant coherent excitation are resonance ( the frequency of the external field must be equal to the bohr transition frequency ) and coherence .",
    "deviations from resonance ( detuning ) are detrimental and lead to rapid departure of the transition probability from the desired value . in this respect , an alternative to resonant excitation is provided by adiabatic excitation @xcite , which is robust against such variations .",
    "even more crucial for resonant excitation is coherence .",
    "incoherent excitation , as described by einstein s rate equations , allows only partial population transfer , e.g. , at most 50% in a two - level system with equal degeneracies of the two levels @xcite .",
    "deviations from perfect coherence , which can be described by the quantum liouville or bloch equations , inevitably cause departure from the desired unitary transformation .",
    "two general types of decoherence processes can be present : depopulation ( e.g. , due to spontaneous emission or ionisation ) and dephasing ( e.g. , due to elastic collisions , field fluctuations , coupling to the environment , etc . ) .    in this paper , we present an exact analytic solution for pulsed resonant excitation of a two - state system in the presence of pure dephasing .",
    "dephasing is recognised as one of the main obstacles in quantum information and the availability of precise analytic estimates of its effect can be very useful and important .",
    "we derive the exact solution of the bloch equation for a hyperbolic - secant pulse shape and a constant dephasing rate .",
    "we provide examples of the general solution , which is expressed in terms of gamma functions , in various special cases of interest , e.g. for pulses with specific pulse areas .",
    "these results allow us to determine explicitly the deviations from the desired probabilities caused by the dephasing .",
