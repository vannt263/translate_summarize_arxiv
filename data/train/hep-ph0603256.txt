    "theoretical studies reveal an increasing richness in the structure of the phase diagram of strongly interacting matter . at high temperature @xmath0 and/or quark chemical potential @xmath1 it is expected that the system undergoes a phase transition from the ordinary hadronic phase to a chirally restored and deconfined quark gluon plasma ( qgp )  @xcite .",
    "other phases such as a two - flavor ( 2sc ) and color - flavor locked ( cfl ) color - superconducting phase are predicted at high densities and small temperatures . for small chemical potential and high temperature recent lattice calculations",
    "suggest the existence of mesonic bound states even above the deconfinement phase transition temperature  @xcite , indicating a strongly coupled qgp .",
    "based on model calculations  @xcite as well as lattice qcd simulations  @xcite , the existence of a critical endpoint ( cep ) ) in the phase diagram is suggested .",
    "this is the endpoint of a first - order transition line in the @xmath2-plane and is a genuine singularity of the qcd free energy . here",
    "the phase transition is of second order , belonging to the three - dimensional ising universality class .",
    "its precise location , which is e.g.  highly sensitive to the value of the strange - quark mass , is not known at present .",
    "it might be accessible with current and future experimental facilities and its observable implications in relativistic heavy - ion experiments such as event - by - event fluctuations of suitable observables are intensively discussed  @xcite .    from lattice studies",
    "it is known that the dynamics of the transition along the temperature axis is strongly affected by the presence of light quarks .",
    "the transition temperature is lowered substantially from its value in the pure gauge limit of infinitely heavy quarks , mostly due to the nearly massless up- and down quarks .",
    "this indicates a prominent role of the ( nearly exact ) chiral @xmath3 symmetry , which is spontaneously broken to @xmath4 at small temperatures and baryon densities .",
    "indeed , a chiral phase transition is observed numerically whose transition temperature coincides with that for the deconfinement transition . in the limit of vanishing up- and down quark masses and infinite strange quark mass ,",
    "the chiral phase transition is likely to be of second - order at vanishing @xmath1 and the static critical behavior is expected to fall in the universality class of the heisenberg @xmath5 model in three dimensions  @xcite .",
    "lattice calculation of the qcd phase transition with finite @xmath1 is much more difficult . due to the fermion sign problem",
    ", simulations of similar precision as at @xmath6 are still lacking . from direct numerical evaluation of the qcd partition function and its quantum - statistical analysis  @xcite or from a taylor expansion of the pressure around @xmath6",
    "there is , however , evidence for a cep at finite @xmath1 . at this point",
    "both the chiral- and the quark number susceptibility diverge .",
    "the existence of a cep in the ( @xmath7)-plane implies that massless two - flavor qcd has a tricritical point ( tcp ) at which the @xmath5 line of critical points ends . for larger @xmath1 s",

    "there is a variety of model studies of the cep and the critical region around it  @xcite . in future searches for the cep in heavy - ion reactions the size of the critical region is especially important  @xcite .",
    "most of these studies rely in one way or another on a mean - field description of the phase transition .",
    "as is well known , mean - field theory very often fails to give the correct description of phase transitions and fluctuations have to be included .",
    "an efficient way to describe critical phenomena beyond mean - field theory is the renormalization group ( rg ) method .",
    "it can be used to describe the universal and non - universal aspects of second - order as well as first - order phase transitions . in the context of the phase diagram of strongly interacting matter",
    "the rg - method has been applied in  @xcite using a two - flavor quark - meson model , which captures essential chiral aspects of qcd .    extending our previous analysis , the present work primarily focuses is the question how large the critical regions around the tcp and cep might be .",
    "the size of a critical region is defined as the one where mean - field theory breaks down and non - trivial critical exponents emerge .",
    "a well - known criterion is the ginzburg criterion which estimates the size by some unknown coupling coefficients .",
    "it is based on an expansion of the singular part of the free energy for a second - order phase transition .",
    "since the expansion coefficients , appearing in this criterion are not known for strong interactions the ginzburg criterion is of limited use in the present context . also universality arguments are not helpful , if the underlying microscopic dynamics is not well determined .",
    "this can be seen , for example , in the @xmath8 transition of liquid helium he@xmath9 and the superconducting transition of metals .",
    "both transitions belong to the same universality class of the @xmath10 spin model but their critical regions defined by their corresponding ginzburg - levanyuk temperature @xmath11 , differ by several orders of magnitude . for hadronic matter",

    "we find that the rg calculation yields non - trivial critical exponents , consistent with the expected 3d ising universality class .",
    "close to the cep our exponent is consistent with the ising class but we also see a novel crossover phenomenon .",
    "3 .   as a consequence of fluctuations , the size of the critical region around the cep",
    "is substantially reduced , as compared to mean - field results .",
    "this is particularly true in the @xmath1-direction , where a shrinkage by almost one order of magnitude is observed .",
    "this may have consequences for the experimental localization of the cep in the phase diagram since it further complicates its detection through event - by - event fluctuations .",
    "the success of the rg approach in predicting the expected critical behavior of the thermodynamics in the quark - meson model encourages us to pursue the issue of the existence of a cep in the phase diagram of strongly interacting matter and its location in the ( @xmath7)-plane further .",
    "it is known from lattice studies that the strange quark plays a major role .",
    "we therefore intend to extend the analysis to three quark flavors  @xcite .",
    "one of the drawbacks of the quark - meson model is the lack of explicit gluonic degrees of freedom , which are known to play a big role in the thermodynamics of qcd and are associated with confinement aspects of the theory .",
