    "a superconductor ( sc ) is an emergent state of matter in which electrons pair up forming cooper pairs , the different cooper pairs become phase coherent , and the system undergoes bose - einstein condensation .",
    "what is the effect of disorder on such a phase - coherent state ? it was argued by anderson  @xcite that three - dimensional superconductivity is quite robust , persisting even in polycrystalline or amorphous materials .",
    "two dimensions turns out to be particularly intriguing because it is the marginal dimension for localization and superconductivity .",
    "one can ask : does a two - dimensional system develop superconducting behavior when all its eigenstates are localized due to a random potential and if so , what is the mechanism  @xcite ? it is seen from experiments that superconductivity in two dimensions does exist but can be destroyed by a large variety of tuning parameters including temperature , inverse thickness ( characterized by sheet resistance ) , disorder , gate voltage , coulomb blockade , perpendicular magnetic field , and parallel magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "once superconductivity is destroyed the system becomes an insulator beyond a quantum phase transition at @xmath0 ( see fig .",
    "[ schematicscales ] ) .",
    "much progress has made in the field of superconductor - insulator transitions ( sit ) over the years , however , there are still several open questions :    * for zero disorder , we know that above the superconducting transition temperature @xmath1 the system is a normal fermi liquid . what is the nature of the state above @xmath1 at finite disorder ?",
    "is it a fermi liquid , or a quantum critical phase with a pseudogap ? * what is the nature of the insulator ?",
    "is it a localized anderson insulator , a mott insulator , a fermi glass , a bose glass , or something else ? * what are the energy scale(s ) in the insulator that vanish at the sit ? * what is the mechanism that drives the sit ?",
    "* how do the single - particle spectral functions and dynamical conductivity behave in the superconductor , the insulator , and near the sit ?",
    "* what is the universality class ( critical exponents , amplitude ratios , and scaling functions ) ?",
    "* is the critical resistance universal and equal to the quantum of resistance @xmath2 ?",
    "if so ( as in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , does this indicate self - duality ?",
    "* can one develop a theory that captures both coulomb amplitude suppression and phase fluctuations , and thus unify the fermionic and bosonic pictures of the sit ?",
    "* does the sit happen concomitantly with the metal - insulator transition ( mit ) , or not ? * what is the origin of the gigantic peak in the magnetoresistance in the insulating state ?    in our work",

    "in order to understand the role of amplitude and phase fluctuations , it is useful to consider a clean problem of fermions with attractive interactions .",

    "[ bcsbec ] , with increasing attraction the pairing scale @xmath18 increases , whereas the phase coherence scale @xmath19 decreases ( because tightly bound pairs have a larger effective mass in a lattice ) .",
    "the transition temperature @xmath1 is determined by the lower of the two scales @xmath20 and @xmath17 .",
    "weak - coupling superconductors such as al are described by the bcs ( bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ) limit of large overlapping cooper pairs , where @xmath21 .",
    "the phase coherence scale is of the order of the fermi energy , @xmath22 , whereas the pairing scale is exponentially suppressed , @xmath23 .",
    "thus , the critical temperature is determined by pairing , and we have a mean - field like , amplitude - driven transition .",
    "conversely , in the bec ( bose - einstein condensation ) limit where @xmath24 , the cooper pairs are small and tightly bound , and the transition is determined by the temperature @xmath17 above which phase coherence is lost . however , a pseudogap  a suppression in the density of states around the fermi energy  persists up to a higher temperature @xmath20  @xcite .",
    "although the crossover from bcs to bec regimes is not directly relevant to superconductivity in weakly coupled traditional superconductors , we will see that as disorder is introduced , the amplitude - driven mechanism for the loss of superconductivity is modified to a phase - driven mechanism opening up a pseudogap regime .",
    "this manifests itself as the discrepancy between transport and tunneling measurements ( fig .",
    "[ karimphasediagram ] ) : transport measurements are sensitive to global phase coherence and hence to @xmath17 , whereas tunneling densities of states are sensitive to local pairing correlations and hence to @xmath20 .    the key reason for the formation of a pseudogap regime even in a weakly coupled bcs superconductor is the phenomenon of disorder - induced `` emergent granularity '' : a `` homogeneously disordered '' model or sample may have a strongly inhomogeneous pairing amplitude .",

    "these can be understood to arise primarily as a consequence of the number - phase uncertainty . in a bulk superconductor ,",
    "the number of fermions is completely uncertain and phase is uniform .",
    "disorder confines the wavefunctions and places constraints on fermion number , thus introducing phase fluctuations that can ultimately drive the system into an insulator .",
    "these fluctuations can be captured qualitatively with the self - consistent harmonic approximation  @xcite or more quantitatively using quantum monte carlo and maximum entropy methods .",
    "to model the competition between superconductivity and localization that leads to the sit in quench - condensed films with thicknesses less than the coherence length , we take the simplest lattice hamiltonian that has an @xmath9-wave superconducting ground state in the absence of disorder ( @xmath29 ) and exhibits anderson localization when the attractive interaction is turned off ( @xmath30 ) . thus , we study the two - dimensional attractive hubbard model in a random potential : @xmath31 with lattice sites @xmath32 and @xmath33 , spin indices @xmath34 or @xmath35 , fermion creation and annihilation operators @xmath36 and @xmath37 , number operators @xmath38 , hopping @xmath39 between neighboring sites @xmath40 , and a chemical potential @xmath41 chosen such that the average density is @xmath42 .",

    "there has been considerable debate about whether the transition is driven by a destruction of the pairing amplitude or the phase stiffness .",
    "it was believed that homogeneously disordered films would show a closing of the single particle gap in tunneling signaling a destruction of the pairing amplitude , whereas intentionally grown granular films would lose global superconductivity because of a loss of phase coherence between grains even though the individual grains could be locally superconducting .",
