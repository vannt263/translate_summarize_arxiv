    "we combine these data with recent data from @xcite and @xcite to better constrain the orbit and atmosphere of @xmath1 pic b.",
    "our study originates from the need to test the adi / loci reduction pipeline first presented in @xcite and updated in @xcite at separations smaller than those where the pipeline had previously extracted planet signals ( r @xmath12 0.375@xmath11 ) .",
    "because @xmath1 pic b s reported projected separation in 2009 was @xmath2 0.3@xmath11 @xcite , we chose the now publicly available @xcite @xmath3 band data from december 29 , 2009 to test our code performance .",
    "@xcite discusses the details of the @xmath3 band observations . the total field rotation in units of the image fwhm was @xmath5 3 @xmath14/d , sufficient for using our reduction pipeline .",

    "the planet is easily detected and is well separated from residual speckle noise .",
    "the planet signal - to - noise , determined from the dispersion in pixel intensity values in concentric annuli , is snr @xmath5 21 : about a factor of 45 greater than from @xcite .    motivated by this success , we searched for additional @xmath1 pic data in the vlt / naco archive taken in adi mode between 2003 and 2009 , finding a set taken on november 11 , 2008 with the l27 camera .",
    "most of these data were taken in sparse aperture masking mode in @xmath19 , @xmath3 , and @xmath0 bands over a span of @xmath5 4 hours : these data were mentioned in @xcite as not providing good constraints on the companion .",

    "basic image processing of the @xmath0 band data followed steps outlined in @xcite . after registering each image and subtracting off the smooth seeing halo , we fourier filtered the data to remove residual low spatial frequency noise and masked any hitherto unidentified bad pixels previously lost in the seeing halo .",
    "we explored a range of loci parameter space , varying @xmath18 , @xmath17 , and the ratio of the radial to azimuthal lengths of the subtraction annulus ( @xmath20 ) . because @xmath1 pic b is very luminous in the mid - ir ( e.g. @xmath21@xmath3 @xmath2 7.7 ; * ? ? ? * and section 3 of this work ) , we focused on  aggressive \" loci settings of @xmath18 = 0.250.5 , @xmath17 = 200 - 300 , and @xmath20 = 0.31 , which better remove residual speckle noise .",

    "a signal - to - noise map of the median - combined image also shows that the peak does not result from latent image artifacts .",
    "slightly different settings for @xmath18 , @xmath17 , and @xmath20 also yield significant detections ( bottom panels ) .",
    "our new @xmath0 band detection and high signal - to - noise @xmath3 band detection allow new constraints on the planet s orbit .",
    "to derive precise astrometry needed to investigate the planet s orbit , we adopt the naco plate scale and orientation for the l27 camera from @xcite : 27.1 mas / pixel and a north position angle of -0.6 degrees .",
    "these values are nearly identical to those for the l27 camera quoted by @xcite for 2003 naco data and for the s27 camera from @xcite calibrated from trapezium data acquired closest in time to the @xmath1 pic data : our astrometric results does not leverage on which calibration we use .    to fine tune our measurements ,",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "while we lack unsaturated data from this run to directly confirm the psf shape , unsaturated @xmath0 data taken in prior runs such as that for hd 158882 ( march 2007 ) show that the ao - assisted naco @xmath0 psf core is axisymmetric and well reproduced by a simple gaussian intensity distribution . for the @xmath3 band data ,",
    "the astrometric bias is minimal , whereas @xmath1 pic b s measured radial separation in @xmath0 band is biased by about + 0.5 pixels ( 0.013 \" ) .",
    "the position angle offsets for both data were minimal .",
    "we determine the @xmath0 band position to be at a separation of r = 0.210 @xmath8 0.027@xmath11 and position angle of 211.49 @xmath8 1.9 degrees .",
    "the @xmath3 band position is at 0.326 @xmath8 0.013@xmath11 and 210.64 @xmath8 1.2 degrees ( table 1 ) .",
    "here we conservatively assume an uncertainty in radial separation of one pixel for @xmath0 band and 0.5 pixels for the ( higher signal - to - noise ) @xmath3 band data . the position angle uncertainty  determined from the dispersion in values using different centroiding estimates ( e.g. vs. ) is 0.25 pixels ( 0.7 mas@xmath16r ) , or 1.2 and 1.9 degrees for @xmath3 and @xmath0 , comparable to uncertainties for @xmath1 pic b by @xcite and @xcite . assuming that @xmath1 pic is 19.3 pc distant @xcite , the planet was at a projected separation of 4.05 @xmath8 0.50 au on november 11 , 2008 and 6.29 @xmath8 0.25 au on december 29 , 2009 . to determine the range of allowable orbits for @xmath1 pic b , we follow the method described in @xcite used to model the orbit of the low - mass brown dwarf companion gj 758 b @xcite , somewhat similar to earlier analyses for @xmath1 pic b @xcite . in this approach",
    ", we perform a monte carlo simulation comparing the astrometry to predictions from randomly selected orbits , where we allow all orbital parameters to vary .",
    "the minimum @xmath22 value in our simulation is @xmath22 @xmath5 1.23 .",
    "given our data s weak constraints on the orbital acceleration and the degeneracies due to the unknown line - of - sight components of planet position and velocity , no single best orbital solution emerges .",
    "rather , the best - fitting solutions describe an extended , well- defined family of solutions that all match the data equally well .",
    "we choose a cut of @xmath22 @xmath23 2.23 ( @xmath22 @xmath10 @xmath22@xmath24 + 1 ) to represent the family of best - fitting orbits .",
    "we also consider the results for a cut of @xmath22 @xmath23 8 ( @xmath22 for a 1-@xmath25 deviation in each of the data s degrees of freedom ) : a family of average- fitting solutions . from the set of models satisifying this criterion",
    ", we determine the median value of each parameter , weighted by the ratio of the mean to current orbital velocity for the corresponding orbit , and identify the weighted 68% confidence interval about the median .",
    "we include astrometry from the highest signal - to - noise data separated in time by more than @xmath5 3 months ( table 1 ) .",
    "figures [ orbitfit ] and [ orbitfit2 ] displays our monte carlo simulation results . for a @xmath22 @xmath23 2.23 cutoff ( figure [ orbitfit ] ) ,",
    "the range of best - fit orbital parameters ( weighted median , [ weighted 68% confidence interval ] ) include @xmath26 = 10.99 [ 8.18 , 15.88 ] au , @xmath4 = 89.47 [ 89.19 , 89.69 ] degrees , @xmath27 = 0.12 [ 0.03,0.31 ] , and @xmath7 = 30.89 [ 30.57 , 31.17 ] degrees . for nearly circular orbits ( @xmath27 @xmath12 0.1 ) , the range in semimajor axes is much narrower ( @xmath26 @xmath5 812 au ) .",
    "if we relax our fitting criteria to accept models with @xmath22 @xmath23 8 ( figure [ orbitfit2 ] ) , we find @xmath26 = 9.50 [ 7.80 , 13.43 ] au and @xmath27 = 0.10 [ 0.02,0.23 ] . more importantly , the inclination and longitude of ascending node are still nearly single valued : @xmath4 = 88.93 [ 88.06 , 89.40 ] and @xmath7 = 31.32 [ 30.56 , 32.12 ] .",
    "thus , @xmath1 pic b s orbit must be viewed almost perfectly edge on , consistent with that for @xmath1 pic s debris disks , with a north position angle of @xmath5 30.8 degrees for the outer debris disk ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also boccaletti et al .",
    "2009 ) but inconsistent with the inner disk position angle , which is offset by @xmath5 5 degrees @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the @xmath0 band observations of @xmath1 pic were taken with the star saturated within @xmath5 3 pixels ( @xmath5 0.6 fwhm ) of the centroid and there were likewise no unsaturated standard star observations .",
    "we derive a very crude magnitude estimate by scaling the @xmath0 psf of hd 158882 to the unsaturated portion of the @xmath1 pic psf and use hd 158882 s known brightness ( @xmath19 = 5.09 ; @xmath19-@xmath0 @xmath5 0 ) to calibrate @xmath1 pic b s brightness .",
    "we estimate @xmath28 @xmath2 8.02 @xmath8 0.50 ( m@xmath29 @xmath2 9.99 ) , where we consider the uncertainties in our psf fitting scaling , the dispersion in individual planet magnitude estimates drawn from separate reductions , and the intrinsic signal - to - noise of our detection .",
    "we determine an @xmath3 contrast of @xmath21@xmath3 = 7.71 @xmath8 0.06 . combining the @xmath3 measurement with the @xmath19 band and [ 4.05 ] data from @xcite and @xcite",
    ", we have three good quality photometric points to investigate the family of possible solutions for @xmath1 pic b s atmospheric properties .",
    "figure [ atmosfit ] compares the @xmath1 pic b photometry to best - fit spectra for models with log(@xmath20 ) = 3.5/44.5 and @xmath30 = 10001800 k for a range of cloud prescriptions : the model a and ae thick cloud prescriptions respectively from @xcite and @xcite that best fit the hr 8799 planet seds , the model e cloud deck prescription appropriate for brown dwarfs @xcite , and a cloudless atmosphere .",
    "the @xmath31 values for these models are , respectively , @xmath31 = 24.8 , 12.3 , 20.4 , and 43.2 for models a , ae , e , and the cloudless case . the ae thick cloud model provides the best fit .",
    "thick cloud models also produce redder @xmath3-@xmath0 colors at high temperatures , similar to that estimated here ( @xmath2 -0.22 @xmath8 0.50 ) , though our lack of a reliable @xmath0 photometric calibration precludes strong conclusions .",
    "good photometry is available in only three filters , so we can not yet say that @xmath1 pic b has thick clouds like the hr 8799 planets @xcite .",
    "the range of gravities and effective temperatures are log(g ) = 3.54.5 and @xmath30 = 14001800 k. the implied masses for these models range between 4.1 m@xmath9 and 19.2 @xmath32 and ages range between 1 and 27 myr , broadly consistent with the planet mass ( 9 @xmath8 3 m@xmath9 ; * ? ? ?",

    "we can not extract reliable photometry from our @xmath0 band data ; new data at 11.65 @xmath34 and @xmath5 33.5 @xmath34 is needed to constrain @xmath1 pic b s atmosphere .",

    "more recently , the presence of a warp in the disk at @xmath5 80 au  due to the combined effects of the main disk with pa @xmath5 30.8 and a second , inclined disk offset by 5 degrees  was identified as a clear signpost of a perturbing planet ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , motivating high - contrast imaging studies to image the planet .",
    "@xcite identified @xmath1 pic b as a likely source of the inclined disk and used the disk morphology to derive mass estimates ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "our results suggest that @xmath1 pic b is probably _ not _ aligned with the inner disk / warp but rather the main disk , as the allowed range in @xmath7 is offset from the main disk as measured by @xcite by no more than @xmath5 1 degree .",
    "furthermore , the planet may be misaligned with the submm disk emission @xcite , which is sensitive to dynamical sculpting by planets @xcite .",
    "however , models accounting for the inclined inner disk presume that the planet s orbit is also inclined relative to the main disk ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "new beta pic b astrometry , a more precise astrometric calibration of existing beta pic naco data by determining and correcting for image distortion , and a detailed relative calibration between naco data and data revealing the disk will further clarify how beta pic b s orbital plane compares to that for the main disk and the inner disk / warp .",
    "furthermore , our new orbital constraints for @xmath1 pic b strongly motivate new studies of the dynamical sculpting of @xmath1 pic s debris disk by planets .",
    "if @xmath1 pic b or non - planet related mechanisms ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) fail to explain the inclined debris disk / warp , the existence of additional planets in the system may be required .",
    "our @xmath0 band detection demonstrates that it is possible to directly image planets at separations approaching the telescope diffraction limit without sparse aperture masking interferometry ( sam ; * ? ? ?",
    "the high strehl ratio , large amount of field rotation , large mid - ir planet brightness , and loci processing pipeline are the keys to closing this gap .",
    "while sam can detect planets interior to the telescope diffraction limit , it is overall less sensitive .",
    "however , the techniques can be complementary , yielding detections or robust limits on infant gas giant planets around the youngest stars on @xmath5 5100 au scales .",
    "upcoming facilities like gpi , sphere , scexao , and project 1640 achieve higher contrast at small inner working angles in the near - ir primarily through more sophisticated wavefront control @xcite .",
    "our results , coupled with previous @xmath3 band detections of @xmath1 pic from @xcite and the high signal - to - noise @xmath3 band detection of hr 8799e @xcite suggest that the mid - ir may also be fertile ground for new exoplanet detections at small separations for very young systems .",
    "young , nearby 1.52 @xmath40 stars like @xmath1 pic are particularly promising targets for direct imaging surveys ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and many have resolved debris disks ( e.g. hd 181327 , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
