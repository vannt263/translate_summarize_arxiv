    "the phase diagram of the high temperature superconducting cuprates has been under extensive investigation since their discovery , almost three decades ago.@xcite in addition to high temperature superconductivity , a variety of ground states have been proposed and partly realized upon charge carrier doping . for example , the parent compound la@xmath3cuo@xmath2 , which is an antiferromagnetic ( af ) mott insulator with nel temperature t@xmath7=325  k , @xcite is known to exhibit a short - range glassy phase @xcite and subsequently diagonal stripe order upon doping with e.g. sr ( la@xmath0sr@xmath1cuo@xmath2 ) .",
    "@xcite recently , research has refocused on the highly underdoped cuprates.@xcite however the evolution of the electronic ground state with the very first added charge carriers , in particular in the search for a possible broken symmetry associated with an exotic ground state and subsequent effects on the anomalous normal state properties , remains an enigma .    although earlier efforts had in fact suggested that ferroelectricity could be present in la@xmath3cuo@xmath5 and yba@xmath3cu@xmath8o@xmath9,@xcite a low temperature ferroelectric ( fe ) phase with an associated magnetoelectric ( me ) coupling",
    "was recently observed in highly underdoped la@xmath3cuo@xmath5 ( t@xmath10  k).@xcite",
    "notably , ferroelectricity is characterized by broken spatial inversion symmetry and typically emerges in the absence of mobile charge carriers . in the case of lightly oxygen doped la@xmath3cuo@xmath5 ( t@xmath7 = 320",
    "k ) it was proposed that the non - stoichiometric oxygen ions take interstitial positions in the la@xmath3cuo@xmath2 unit cell , causing a displacement in the apical oxygen ions of the cuo@xmath6 octahedra , which are the building blocks of the la@xmath3cuo@xmath2 unit cell @xcite . therefore , local - scale structural cuo@xmath6 distortions take place , breaking the spatial inversion symmetry , resulting in the formation of local electric dipoles.@xcite these dipoles are localized around the oxygen interstitials forming charge clusters , which couple and freeze at low temperature , giving rise to an observable polar state .",
    "other microscopic mechanisms have also been proposed .",
    "these include a model based on polaron formation around the dopant atoms , @xcite a purely magnetic origin associated with dzyaloshinskii - moriya ( dm ) interaction leading to local structural distortions and concomitant local broken inversion symmetry , @xcite and a proposal for the emergence of electric polarization due to the formation of magnetic vortex / anti - vortex pairs at the edges of oriented stripe segments .",
    "@xcite the presence of the me effect in la@xmath3cuo@xmath5 @xcite has also been studied by landau theory , which includes a bi - quadratic coupling between the electric polarization and the magnetic order.@xcite at present , there is no consensus on the origin of the fe phase in these materials .",
    "the question arising therefore is whether ferroelectricity is present in la@xmath3cuo@xmath2 when different dopant ions are introduced into the lattice . to shed further light on the nature of ferroelectricity and magnetoelectricity in la@xmath3cuo@xmath2 system ,",
    "it is important to study other members of the la-214 cuprate family , especially the case where charge carriers originate from sr and li doping .",
    "both of these ions occupy stoichiometric positions in the la@xmath3cuo@xmath2 unit cell and therefore , no dipole moments are directly associated with the dopant sites , in contrast to the case of interstitial excess oxygen ions in la@xmath3cuo@xmath5 .",
    "@xcite    here , we report measurements of the electric polarization on sr and li doped la@xmath3cuo@xmath2 single crystals . we show that la@xmath11sr@xmath12cuo@xmath2 exhibits distinct fe behavior along different crystallographic directions .",
    "similar behavior is also shown in lightly oxygen doped la@xmath3cuo@xmath5 samples ( different samples than those investigated in ref .  )",
    "studied here for direct comparison to la@xmath11sr@xmath12cuo@xmath2 .",
    "the magnetic field dependence of the electric polarization is anisotropic and it can be tuned through the dm interaction . in la@xmath3li@xmath1cu@xmath4o@xmath2 ( @xmath13 and @xmath14 ) ,",
    "the measured electric polarization is in the order of @xmath15c @xmath16 i.e. , several times higher than for la@xmath11sr@xmath12cuo@xmath2 ( as shown below ) and la@xmath3cuo@xmath5.@xcite the electric polarization in la@xmath3li@xmath1cu@xmath4o@xmath2 is also tunable by an applied magnetic field similar to la@xmath11sr@xmath12cuo@xmath2 and la@xmath3cuo@xmath5 .",
    "these results taken together demonstrate that the fe phase is present in all underdoped la-214 cuprates investigated so far , and is prompted by charge carrier doping .",
    "we propose ferroelectricity may originate from a mechanism that breaks inversion symmetry by local structural distortions of the cuo@xmath6 octahedra due to the presence of the dopant ions and/or clustering of the added holes .",
    "such local symmetry breaking induces electric dipoles which couple and order at low temperature .",
    "the experiments were performed on twinned single crystals .",
    "la@xmath11sr@xmath12cuo@xmath2 crystals were grown using the laser - diode heated floating zone method @xcite .",
    "high purity la@xmath3o@xmath8 ( 99.99 % ) , srco@xmath8 ( 99.9 % ) and cuo ( 99.9 % ) were used as starting materials .",
    "sr ions take la stoichiometric positions and thus the sr concentration ( x = 0.001 ) is higher than the purity of la@xmath3co@xmath8 . on the other hand ,",
    "the sr concentration is comparable to the purity of cuo .",
    "furthermore , the crystals were carefully annealed at 1000  c for 20 h under 1ppm o@xmath3 - ar flowing atmosphere .",
    "the crystal axes were determined by x - ray laue backscattering technique .",
    "the sharp antiferromagnetic transition at 312  k ( see supplementary s1 ) is suggestive of homogeneous distribution of the dopant ions ( either sr or excess oxygen ions that might be included in the unit cell ) into the la@xmath11sr@xmath12cuo@xmath2 samples as any inhomogeneous distribution of the ion dopants would cause either the suppression - broadening of the af peak at 312  k , or the appearance of secondary magnetic peaks at temperatures lower than 312  k.        to overcome the difficulty in quantifying experimentally the very low sr concentration , we synthesized ( crystal growth and annealing ) oxygen doped la@xmath3cuo@xmath5 using the same method as la@xmath11sr@xmath12cuo@xmath2 .",
    "@xcite the excellent agreement in the magnetic transition ( supplementary s1 ) , indicate similar excess oxygen doping in both materials , as the very small sr doping will not affect the magnetic transition temperature of la@xmath11sr@xmath12cuo@xmath2 significantly @xcite ( therefore la@xmath11sr@xmath12cuo@xmath17 is the appropriate chemical formula for the sr - doped la@xmath3cuo@xmath2 samples ) .",
    "any possible difference in their transport properties therefore would be attributable to sr doping .",
    "la@xmath3cu@xmath4li@xmath1o@xmath2 single crystals were grown using the conventional lamp heated floating zone technique .",
    "@xcite high purity la@xmath3o@xmath8 ( 99.999 % ) , li@xmath3co@xmath8 ( 99.99 % ) and cuo ( 99.99 % ) were used as starting materials in order to achieve the lowest possible impurity level .",
    "the crystal axes were again determined by x - ray laue backscattering technique .",
    "the samples were annealed at 900  c for 48h , in flowing ar atmosphere .",
    "the li concentration was estimated from x - ray diffraction measurements of the lattice constants .",
    "@xcite all crystals were cut appropriately and pairs of plate - like samples were extracted .",
    "each pair consists of a sample with the thinnest direction along the c - axis and another with the thinnest direction along the ab - plane .",
    "the magnetization of the samples was measured using a commercial mpms quantum design squid magnetometer , in heraklion .",
    "the la@xmath11sr@xmath12cuo@xmath17 crystals exhibit t@xmath7 = 312 k , whereas for the la@xmath3cuo@xmath5 t@xmath7 = 313  k. for la@xmath3li@xmath1cu@xmath4o@xmath2 crystals , t@xmath7 = 255  k ( @xmath18 = 0.01 ) and t@xmath7 = 150  k ( @xmath18 = 0.04 ) , respectively .",
    "the impedance and loss of the samples were measured using an lcr meter , over a frequency range 21 hz - 2 mhz , and the dielectric permittivity was extracted , as described elsewhere.@xcite electric polarization measurements were performed using two different home - built experimental stations in heraklion and singapore employing the pyrocurrent technique .",

    "figure  [ fig:1]a shows the real part of the in - plane dielectric permittivity @xmath21 for la@xmath22sr@xmath12cuo@xmath17 . at high temperatures , a step - like decrement is observed for all measured frequencies .",
    "this decrement shifts to higher temperature with increasing frequency f , indicative of a common dielectric relaxation process . at low frequencies , an additional dielectric",
    "peak develops which shifts to higher temperature and is suppressed with increasing f. such a peak in the dielectric permittivity can be attributed either to an intrinsic charge relaxor characterized by a diffused phase transition or to spurious effects arising from the electrical contacts such as extrinsic maxwell - wagner phenomena .",
    "@xcite    to reveal the intrinsic character of the dielectric peaks , measurements of the dielectric permittivity were repeated several times with renewed contacts , giving consistent experimental results in the temperature regime around the peaks .",
    "thus the electrical contacts do not affect the measured dielectric permittivity .",
    "also , both the temperature t@xmath23 where the dielectric peak occurs and the magnitude of the permittivity at the peak position @xmath24 can not be described by the empirical relations reported for pseudo - fe relaxor behavior .",
    "@xcite nevertheless , such a relaxation process due to the slowing of polar clusters , can be described by the vogel - fulcher ( vf ) relation @xmath25 $ ] , where the characteristic freezing temperature t@xmath26 corresponds to the estimated temperature below which the polar clusters freeze .",
    "@xcite notably , electric polarization may emerge below t@xmath26 in relaxor ferroelectrics .",
    "@xcite figure 1b shows f as a function of t@xmath23 for la@xmath11sr@xmath12cuo@xmath17 .",
    "we estimated the t@xmath27 = ( 7.3 @xmath28 0.3 ) k by fitting the experimental data against the vf relation .",
    "similar analysis of the imaginary part @xcite of the out - of - plane dielectric permittivity @xmath29 gives a freezing temperature t@xmath30 = ( 8.6 @xmath28 0.5 ) k , as ( fig  [ fig:1]c and fig  [ fig:1]d ) .",
    "therefore , the observed behavior could be due to a fe relaxor behavior , characterized by a diffused phase transition and the freezing of short - range cluster - like order .",
    "the above data analysis also reveals an anisotropic behavior in the charge dynamics in agreement with an earlier report.@xcite    figure  [ fig:2 ] shows the in - plane ( p@xmath20 ) and the out - of - plane ( p@xmath19 ) electric polarization as a function of temperature for la@xmath11sr@xmath12cuo@xmath17 . for both directions ,",
    "the polarization increases with decreasing temperature , below 10 k. p@xmath19 and p@xmath20 exhibit distinct temperature dependencies .",
    "furthermore , corresponding pyroelectric curves ( fig  [ fig:2]a inset ) show that the pyroelectric current local minima occur at different temperatures , namely 4 k and 6.5 k , for the in - plane and the out - of - plane directions , respectively .",
    "these temperatures are also lower than the corresponding freezing temperatures extracted from vf analysis.@xcite notably , a similar anisotropy has been observed in the spin - glass temperature .",
    "@xcite furthermore , the electric polarization curves reverse with reversing the polarity of the applied electric field .    in proper fe s",
    "the onset of ferroelectricity is defined as the temperature above which there is no measurable polarization and the corresponding pyroelectric current exhibits a sharp minimum . on the other hand , in relaxor fes",
    "a transition occurs over a large time scale .",
    "similar to our data , the pyroelectric minimum is not sharp , resulting in a broad transition in the polarization with respect to temperature , therefore preventing a precise assignment of a transition temperature .",
    "we assign the transition towards a fe state as the temperature where a minimum ( albeit broad ) occurs in the pyroelectric current .",
    "this assignment is corroborated by the fact that the temperature where the local minimum occurs is robust against both the electric field applied during cooling and the temperature sweep rate .",
    "the p - e hysteresis loops for both p@xmath19 and p@xmath20 , are shown in fig  [ fig:2]b ( t = 2 k ) .",
    "the raw data yield a sizable anisotropic electric polarization , with the in - plane and out - of - plane values reaching p@xmath20 = 18 nc@xmath16 and p@xmath19 = 36 nc@xmath16 respectively . the dielectric anomaly and the relaxor behavior in the charge dynamics",
    "indicate a dominant electronic contribution towards the polarization .",
    "in addition , the observation of non - zero polarizations along both the c - axis and ab - plane implies that the electric polarization may arise from an ensemble of charge clusters with varying polarization vectors .",
    "although the intrinsic nature of the different trends in our observations for la@xmath11sr@xmath12cuo@xmath17 ( t@xmath7 = 312 k , n @xmath31 10@xmath32 @xmath33),@xcite it is not clear whether they come from sr doping or from the excess oxygen ions included in the la@xmath3cuo@xmath2 unit cell ( as discussed before ) . to this point , we performed electric polarization measurements on lightly oxygen - doped la@xmath3cuo@xmath5 with t@xmath7 = 313 k ( n @xmath31 10@xmath32 @xmath33).@xcite both p@xmath20 and p@xmath19 increase ( fig  [ fig:3 ] ) with decreasing temperature , however p@xmath19(t ) exhibits a different temperature dependence compared to p@xmath20(t ) .",
    "namely , a change in slope is observed at 5 k and 3 k , for out - of - plane and in - plane directions respectively , coinciding with the corresponding pyrocurrent local minima .",
    "these values are also lower than the charge freezing temperatures obtained from the vf analysis ( supplementary s5 ) . at t",
    "= 2 k , p@xmath19 is almost equal to p@xmath20 .",
    "though , both the remnant electric polarization ( p ( e = 0 ) ) and the coercive electric field ( e ( p=0 ) ) differ for the two measured orientations ( inset fig  [ fig:3 ] ) . electric polarization appears stronger in the out - of - plane direction ( i.e. larger remnant electric polarization and coercive electric field compared to the ab - plane ) .",
    "we note that a finite conductivity could lead to an expanded `` banana - like '' p - e loop.@xcite however , this is not the case in the p - e loops depicted in the inset of fig .",
    "3 . electrical transport experiments in la@xmath3cuo@xmath2 single crystals @xcite",
    "reveal that the in - plane conductivity is considerably larger than the out - of - plane counterpart .",
    "such high conductivity could result in a relatively lossy dielectric , which can manifest itself as a `` chubby '' banana - like p - e curve , in the ab - direction .",
    "however , in our case the in - plane p - e loop is slimmer than the out - of plane loop , indicating the intrinsic nature of both the enhanced out - of - plane remnant electric polarization and the coercive electric field .",

    "the distinct dielectric permittivity , anisotropy , remnant polarization and coercive field between la@xmath3cuo@xmath5 and la@xmath11sr@xmath12cuo@xmath17 indicate distinguishing effects between oxygen and sr doping .",
    "we also measured la@xmath35sr@xmath36cuo@xmath17 however the material is not sufficiently insulating to permit transport measurements of the electric polarization . hence , although possible excess oxygen may still affect the observations in la@xmath11sr@xmath12cuo@xmath17 , the above mentioned observations indicate a characteristic effect due to sr doping ( supplementary table s1 ) .",
    "we now turn to the effect of the applied magnetic field .",
    "the spins in the af phase of la-214 are weakly canted out - of - plane due to the presence of a finite dm interaction.@xcite spin canting causes a weak ferromagnetic ( wf ) moment along the c - axis in each cuo@xmath3 plane , although the opposite spin canting in alternate planes leads to a net cancelation of the wf moments . by applying an external magnetic field along the c - axis ,",
    "the wf moments can be aligned in the same direction above a critical magnetic field h@xmath37 , which for our la@xmath11sr@xmath12cuo@xmath17 samples is 6  t ( supplementary section s6 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig:4]a shows p@xmath19 as a function of applied magnetic field ( here e@xmath38c and h@xmath38c ) . p@xmath19 decreases abruptly above h@xmath37 = 6 t and the pyroelectric current minimum ( inset in fig  [ fig:4]a ) shifts to lower temperatures , indicating a suppression of the fe state as the material enters the wf state ( such abrupt changes are also observed for h@xmath38c and e@xmath39c ) . on the other hand , both p@xmath20 and",
    "the pyrocurrent minimum ( e@xmath38ab and h@xmath38ab ) decrease smoothly with increasing h , as seen in fig  [ fig:4]b ( similar changes are observed for e@xmath39ab and h@xmath38ab ) .",
    "hence , the fe order in la@xmath11sr@xmath12cuo@xmath17 is coupled to the underlying af structure and is influenced by the dm interaction in a manner similar to the recent observations for la@xmath3cuo@xmath5 . @xcite    the similarity in the fe state among la@xmath3cuo@xmath5 and la@xmath11sr@xmath12cuo@xmath17 cuprates is notable even though oxygen and sr doping do not affect the cuo@xmath6 structure in the same way ; while the excess oxygen take non - stoichiometric positions , sr ions substitute for la . because sr and oxygen dopants take positions outside the oxygen octahedra it is important to study the evolution of ferroelectricity in the la-214 family of cuprates using also li doping , which directly replaces cu ions in the cuo@xmath6 octahedra . among other dopants , such as mg and",
    "zn which can be used to replace cu , li ions exhibit the largest ionic radius ( 0.76  ) compared to 0.74   for zn , 0.72   for mg and 0.73   for cu . furthermore , la@xmath3li@xmath1cu@xmath4o@xmath2 remains insulating up to 4 % , @xcite allowing pyrocurrent measurements even at relatively high dopings .",

    "@xcite suggesting charge glassiness may be associated with the onset of ferroelectricity in la-214 cuprates .",
    "it was not possible to calculate the corresponding t@xmath26 for @xmath18 = 0.04 , since the dielectric permittivity peaks are too broad to define a characteristic peak position ( supplementary section s7 ) .",

    "the corresponding magnetization is comparable to earlier studies .",
    "to measure the electric polarization of our samples we employed the pyrocurrent method .",
    "the sample is placed between two metallic plates to form a capacitor .",
    "an electrometer and a voltage source are connected to form the electric circuit shown in fig  [ fig : s2]a .",
    "the capacitor is placed into a cryostat , where we can accurately control the temperature .",
    "when the sample exceeds its ferroelectric transition temperature its electric polarization decreases abruptly to zero .",
    "this induces a current , which is called pyroelectric current or pyrocurrent .",
    "further to the pyrocurrent , resistive and capacitive parasitic electric signals are also included in the total measured current , which can be expressed by @xcite    @xmath49    here v is the applied voltage , r and c are the resistance and the capacitance of the sample respectively , p is the electric polarization and a is the area of the capacitor .",
    "the first term corresponds to the resistance of the sample , and can be neglected as long as the sample is highly resistive or when the measurement is performed in v = 0 bias voltage .",
    "the second term relates to the charging current of the capacitor and is negligible for a zero voltage across the circuit .",
    "the third term is related to the current that could be caused when the dielectric permittivity of the sample changes considerably with temperature and can be ignored when a zero bias voltage is applied .",
    "the fourth term corresponds to the pyrocurrent component of the measured current .",
    "it follows that pyroelectric current measurements should be performed under zero bias voltage v = 0 to ensure that the first three parasitic terms do not contribute to the measured current , and thus the measured current will be purely due to the change of the electric polarization with respect to temperature . in this case",
    "we can write eq ( 1 ) as follows :    @xmath50    hence , the pyrocurrent is proportional to the sweep rate of the sample s temperature .",
    "thus we can measure pyrocurrent by keeping a constant sweep rate of the temperature ( fig  [ fig : s2]b ) .",
    "integrating the pyrocurrent curves , with respect to time gives a quantitative measure of the charge induced due to the depolarization of the sample ( fig  [ fig : s2]c ) .",
    "dividing by the area of the capacitor we obtain the electric polarization of the sample .",
    "to measure accurately the electric polarization of our samples we employ the following protocol .",
    "the measurement process begins with the sample well above its ferroelectric transition temperature ( paraelectric state ) .",
    "an electric field is applied and the sample is cooled to 2 k. the electric field is removed to fulfill the conditions described in the former paragraph . the sample is then heated at 3 k / min while measuring time , temperature and current at a constant interval of 0.5 seconds .",
    "we continue to heat the sample well above its ferroelectric transition temperature . in the case of measuring the pyrocurrent in the presence of an applied magnetic field , we apply the magnetic field as soon as the sample reaches at 2 k and before removing the applied electric field ( zero magnetic field cooling ) .",
    "a typical measured current - vs .- time data set is shown in fig  [ fig : s3]a . for t",
    "@xmath51 7 k the current increases steeply with increasing temperature , indicating the conductive character of the sample .",
    "although v = 0 during the measurement process , a small but unavoidable voltage arising from the voltage source is still applied to the circuit causing the observed resistive behavior - the level of this voltage depends on the current measurement range used in the current meter , and can be between @xmath15v and 200 mv .",
    "however , in the temperature range 2 k - 6 k there is a local current minimum ( inset fig  [ fig : s3]a ) and its sign is reversed ( fig  [ fig : s3]b ) upon reversing the electric field during the cooling process .",
    "furthermore , it becomes sharper with increasing the temperature sweep rate suggesting its pyroelectric nature .",
    "thus it is important to distinguish between the pyrocurrent and the resistive components of the current in order to accurately determine the electric polarization of the sample . to this point",
    ", we fit the experimental data above 8 k against a resistivity model.@xcite the best fit is subtracted from the experimental data and the resulting curve is the pure pyroelectric component ( fig  [ fig : s3]c ) . beyond 250 seconds there is considerable noise due to the data processing .",
    "thus , the pyrocurrent curve is integrated with respect to time in the range 0 - 250 seconds , and the electric polarization with respect to time is acquired .",
    "we obtain p(t ) by converting time to temperature .",
    "we analyzed the dielectric permittivity data for the lightly oxygen - doped la@xmath3cuo@xmath5 ( t@xmath7 = 313 k ) ( fig  [ fig : s4 ] ) .",
    "the out - of - plane component of the permittivity @xmath54c ( fig  [ fig : s4]a ) exhibits a step - like decrement ( at t @xmath51 60 k ) with decreasing temperature and shifts to higher temperature with increasing frequency indicating a common dipolar relaxation process .",
    "furthermore , a dielectric peak is observed at t @xmath31 20 k. this peak becomes smoother and shifts to higher temperature with increasing frequency , suggesting a charge relaxor - like similar to la@xmath11sr@xmath12cuo@xmath17 .",
    "figure  [ fig : s4]b shows the frequency f as a function of peak temperature t@xmath23 extracted from fig  [ fig : s4]a .",
    "application of the vf model gives a freezing temperature t@xmath30 = ( 8 @xmath28 0.5 ) k. similar analysis was performed for the in - plane component of the dielectric permittivity ( fig  [ fig : s4]c ) and the calculated freezing temperature was found to be t@xmath27 = ( 5.2 @xmath28 0.4 ) k ( fig  [ fig : s4]d ) .",

    "the direction of the ( wf ) moments @xmath55 induced by the dm interaction is fixed by the cross product @xmath56 between the dm vector @xmath57 ( oriented along the shorter of the two in - plane orthorhombic directions - the a - axis ) and the af order parameter @xmath58 ( pointing along the b - axis ) so that @xmath55 is oriented along the c - axis , perpendicular to the cuo@xmath3 planes of the crystal structure .",
