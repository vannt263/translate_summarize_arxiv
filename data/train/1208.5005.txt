    "theoretical investigations of spin systems are often motivated by the applications to real systems as magnetic molecules or spin lattices . in the case of a system of three spins with realistic spin quantum numbers varying from @xmath2 to , say , @xmath3",
    ", the underlying hilbert space has a maximal dimension of @xmath4 .",
    "hence , even without using any dimensional reduction due to rotational symmetry , it is an easy exercise to numerically calculate physically relevant quantities , e.  g.  , specific heat or magnetization curves , by using standard codes .",
    "other aspects of spin triangles have been treated in recent publications @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "thus a detailed theoretical investigation of the general spin triangle requires additional justification . in my opinion ,",
    "the reasons to study this special class of spin systems are threefold .",
    "+ first , the spin triangle is interesting in its own right since it exhibits salient features which might evade the purely numerical treatment .",
    "it is a straight forward task to reduce the pertinent hamiltonian @xmath5 to that of a two - chain with coupling constants @xmath6 and @xmath7 and to restrict it to invariant subspaces of maximal dimension @xmath1 , see section [ sec : d ] . here",
    "the reduced hamiltonian has a tridiagonal matrix representation , see section [ sec : h ] , which can be understood by virtue of the wigner - eckhard theorem .",
    "some properties of tridiagonal matrices that are relevant for our purpose are collected in appendix a. the corresponding characteristic polynomial and the spectral curves @xmath8 exhibit a number of symmetries that i have dubbed  spectral symmetries \" in section [ sec : s ] .",
    "usually , symmetries in quantum mechanics lead to operators commuting with @xmath5 .",
    "spectral symmetries are of a different kind and can be expressed by functional equations for the @xmath8 .",
    "they can be traced back to permutational invariance , not of a particular hamiltonian , but of the whole class of triangle hamiltonians . despite its elementary origin",
    ", spectral symmetry allows a qualitative discussion of the spectral curves and , e.  g.  , the calculation of the moments of the restricted hamiltonian up to fifth order without using its explicit matrix representation .",
    "+ a second reason to study spin triangles is that their properties might help to understand more complex systems .",
    "one example , not considered in this article , is the @xmath9 ground state ( for integer @xmath0 and approximately equal coupling constants ) that has been used to build ground states of larger spin systems including spin lattices , see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "another example is the observation that the first few terms of the perturbation series for the eigenvalues of @xmath5 yield certain classes of universal polynomials that occur in the graph expansion of the @xmath10-th moments of @xmath5 , see section [ sec : m ] and [ sec : t ]",
    ". these polynomials also occur in the high temperature expansion for general heisenberg systems , not only triangles , see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "appendix b contains explicit expressions for the @xmath10-th moments of spin dimers that are used in the formulas for the the above - mentioned polynomials .",
    "+ finally , spin triangles may serve as simple but non - trivial examples to study theoretical problems of general interest . here",
    "we will concentrate on one aspect , namely integrability .",
    "classical systems are completely integrable in the sense of arnold - liouville iff they possess @xmath11 poisson - commuting integrals of motion , where @xmath12 is the phase space dimension . sometimes the corresponding quantum systems are also analytically solvable ( harmonic oscillator , hydrogen atom ) but not always .",
    "one counter - example is the one - dimensional particle in a potential @xmath13 , another one is the general spin triangle .",
    "in the latter case we have classically three unit spin vectors , i.  e.  , a six - dimensional phase space , and three constants of motion , @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the corresponding quantum system , notwithstanding the partial results of this paper , can not be solved in closed form . however , there are weaker notions of  quantum integrability \" that justify , e.  g.  , to consider the @xmath2 chain as integrable by means of the bethe ansatz , see @xcite or @xcite for generalizations . in this context",
    "one could see the results of the present paper as another example within the wide range of the not yet fully understood notion of quantum integrability .",
    "we will come back to this question in the section [ sec : so ] containing the summary and an outlook .",
    "we consider the general heisenberg spin triangle with one and the same individual spin quantum number @xmath16 and the hamiltonian @xmath17 where the @xmath18 are three arbitrary real parameters and the @xmath19 denote the three individual spin vector operators , @xmath20 .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ d1 ] ) can be analytically diagonalized if two of the @xmath21 s coincide ( i.  e.  for the isosceles triangle ) or if @xmath0 is small in a sense to be made more precise subsequently . in the first case of , say , @xmath22",
    "we have @xmath23 where @xmath24 it is well - known that @xmath25 and @xmath26 commute and have simultaneous eigenvalues of the form @xmath27 where @xmath28 and the triangle inequality @xmath29 immediately follow from ( [ d2b ] ) .",
    "the corresponding eigenbasis of @xmath30 will be used to split the matrix representation of the general @xmath31 into smaller block matrices .",
    "+ in the general case we write @xmath32 and , since @xmath31 and @xmath25 commute , the problem of diagonalizing @xmath31 can be reduced to the task of finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of @xmath33 in the invariant subspace @xmath34 .",
    "the latter denotes the common eigenspace of @xmath25 and @xmath35 corresponding to the eigenvalues @xmath36 and , say , @xmath37 it will be simply denoted by @xmath38 , since the eigenvalues of @xmath39 do not depend on the chosen eigenspace of @xmath35 .",
    "the dimension of @xmath38 can be determined by counting the possible values of the quantum number @xmath40 .",
    "we obtain @xmath41 according to the triangle inequality ( [ d5 ] ) . in order to avoid the case distinction ( [ d9a]),([d9b ] ) in",
    "what follows , we will write the above condition in a uniform way as @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 , @xmath45 are defined according to ( [ d9a ] ) and ( [ d9b ] ) .",
    "+ the dimension @xmath11 of @xmath38 increases in steps of two in the range @xmath46 and decreases in steps of one in the range @xmath47 .",
    "the maximal dimension @xmath48 is assumed for @xmath49 .",
    "the figures [ figg1 ] and [ figg2 ] show typical examples .",
    "especially , it follows that for @xmath50 the dimension of @xmath38 will be at most four and hence @xmath31 can be analytically diagonalized . at this point",
    "one should mention that for moderate @xmath0 , also exceeding @xmath51 , the computer - algebra system mathematica renders the eigenvalues of @xmath39 in the form of root objects which have many properties of special functions .",
    "for example , the @xmath52-th eigenvalue of @xmath39 can be expanded into an exact power series w.  r.  t.  @xmath7 up to some finite order .",
    "+ the total dimension @xmath53 of the eigenspace of @xmath35 with eigenvalue @xmath54 amounts to @xmath55 in accordance with the general formula in @xcite .",
    "+    the range of the quantum numbers @xmath40 and @xmath56 for @xmath57 .",
    "it is typical for integer @xmath0 that @xmath56 has a minimal value of @xmath58 and the corresponding eigenspace @xmath38 will be one - dimensional .",
    "note that dimensions of the various spaces @xmath38 are @xmath59 in accordance with ( [ d11]).,width=302 ]    the range of the quantum numbers @xmath40 and @xmath56 for @xmath60 .",
    "it is typical for half - integer @xmath0 that @xmath56 has a minimal value of @xmath61 and the corresponding eigenspace @xmath38 will be two - dimensional . note that dimensions of the various spaces @xmath38 are @xmath62 in accordance with ( [ d11]).,width=302 ]",
    "in order to find the matrix representation of @xmath39 within the invariant subspace @xmath38 one has to choose an appropriate basis .",
    "an obvious choice is the eigenbasis of @xmath63 .",
    "the transformation to the eigenbasis of @xmath64 within @xmath38 is achieved by the unitary , real , symmetric matrix @xmath65 with the entries @xmath66 where @xmath67 denotes the @xmath68symbol , see , e.  g.  , @xcite . for the sake of simplicity we will not distinguish between operators and their matrix representation in @xmath38 , if no misunderstanding is likely to arise .",
    "hence we may write @xmath69 and @xmath70 usually , the matrix @xmath65 is fully occupied and contains only few zeroes .",
    "thus it is somewhat surprising that @xmath64 will always be tridiagonal . on the other hand",
    "it is a straight forward task to directly calculate @xmath64 in the eigenbasis of @xmath71 if one adopts the theory of irreducible tensor operators ( ito ) , see , e.  g.  @xcite or , for a recent account , @xcite . in this theory",
    "the tridiagonal form of @xmath64 is a direct consequence of the wigner - eckhard theorem , since @xmath72 is an ito of rank one .",
    "moreover , it follows by the same theorem that , for @xmath49 , @xmath73 which we will derive later by different arguments .",
    "we will not dwell upon the details of the ito calculations and simply present the result . in order to avoid the case distinction ( [ d9a]),([d9b ] ) in the formula for the secondary diagonals of @xmath39 we will express @xmath0 and @xmath56 through @xmath74 and @xmath75 , the bounds of @xmath76 , see ( [ d10 ] ) : @xmath77 then @xmath78_{g , g}=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(g(g+1)-2s(s+1 ) \\right)+\\frac{y}{4}\\left(-g ( 1 + g ) - s ( 1 + s ) + s ( s + 1 ) \\right),\\\\ \\label{h4b } & & \\left [ {     \\fontdimen12\\textfont3=2pt\\fontdimen12\\scriptfont3=1.4pt     \\!\\null\\mathop{\\vphantom{h}\\smash{h}}\\limits_{\\sim}\\null\\!}_2(y ) \\right]_{g , g+1}=\\left [ {     \\fontdimen12\\textfont3=2pt\\fontdimen12\\scriptfont3=1.4pt     \\!\\null\\mathop{\\vphantom{h}\\smash{h}}\\limits_{\\sim}\\null\\!}_2(y ) \\right]_{g+1,g}\\\\ \\label{h4c } & & = y\\sqrt{\\frac{(1+g - g_1)(1+g+g_1)(g - g_2)(g - g_1-g_2)(2+g+g_2)(2+g+g_1+g_2)}{16(1 + 2g)(3 + 2 g ) } } \\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the other matrix elements of @xmath39 vanish .",
    "for example , if @xmath79 then @xmath39 has the matrix form @xmath80 we note in passing that a negative sign of the square root in ( [ h4c ] ) gives the matrix representation of @xmath81",
    ". this will be later used in section [ sec : t ] to derive ( [ t2a ] ) .",
    "+ the diagonalization of tridiagonal matrices is considerably simpler than for general matrices and has been extensively studied also from a numerical point of view , see , e.  g.  @xcite . for the related problem of the inversion of tridiagonal matrices",
    "see @xcite .",
    "we have collected some results which will be of relevance for our purpose in the appendix a. for example , in our problem the entries ( [ h4c ] ) of the secondary diagonals do not vanish . in this case",
    "the eigenvalues of the tridiagonal matrix will never be degenerate .",
    "of course , there is the usual degeneracy due to rotational invariance and some accidental degeneracy between the energy eigenvalues of @xmath31 of different invariant subspaces @xmath38 , not to mention the special case of @xmath82 . +",
    "another interesting property is the following : if we perturb a diagonal matrix by a tridiagonal perturbation the resulting perturbation series will be given by relatively simple formulas , at least for the first few terms , see ( [ a5a])-([a5c ] ) .",
    "these formulas seem to be of little use at first sight since , at least for small @xmath0 , the eigenvalues can be numerically calculated very fast , but we will present different applications in the sections [ sec : m ] and [ sec : t ] .",
    "for given quantum numbers @xmath0 and @xmath56 let @xmath83 denote the characteristic polynomial of @xmath39 restricted to @xmath38 , that is , @xmath84{0.06ex}{1.60ex } } { } $ } } } } \\smash{{\\;\\smash{\\raisebox{-0.5ex}{$\\!\\!\\stackrel{\\!\\mbox{1 }              \\hspace{-0.4ex}\\rule[0.0ex]{0.06ex}{1.60ex } } { } $ } } } } } \\limits_{\\sim}\\null\\!}_{\\;\\mathcal{h}(s)}\\right ) \\;.\\ ] ] it is a polynomial in the variables @xmath85 and @xmath7 of total degree @xmath86 .",
    "for example , if @xmath87 we have @xmath88 and @xmath89 obviously , the above coefficients of @xmath90 are symmetric under the reflection @xmath91 or @xmath92 this can be proven generally as follows .",
    "+ the two hamiltonians @xmath93 and @xmath94 are unitarily equivalent under the permutation @xmath95 and hence have the same eigenvalues , say , @xmath96 .",
    "this means that , upon an appropriate ordering of eigenvalues , @xmath97 from which ( [ s3 ] ) follows by @xmath98 the coefficients of @xmath99 are determined by the well - known eigenvalues of @xmath100 @xmath101 for example , the factors in front of the lines of ( [ s2 ] ) result from @xmath102    there exist further symmetries of @xmath83 which are not so obvious as the reflection symmetry .",
    "they are revealed by employing arbitrary permutations of the spin triangle .",
    "these permutations can be composed of transpositions @xmath103 that induce rational transformations of @xmath104 in the following way : @xmath105 for almost all real numbers @xmath7 the permutation group @xmath106 thus produces cycles of six different numbers .",
    "the exceptions are @xmath107 and @xmath108 , where only three different numbers are involved . in general , if @xmath7 runs through such a @xmath109-cycle the spectrum of the corresponding hamiltonians @xmath39 will be related by affine transformations .",
    "( [ s4 ] ) is a first example .",
    "a second example which , together with ( [ s4 ] ) generates all remaining ones , is @xmath110 where @xmath111 and a suitable ordering of the eigenvalues is assumed .",
    "+ geometrically , ( [ s9 ] ) means that the system of spectral curves @xmath112 in the @xmath113-plane is point - symmetric w.  r.  t.  the point @xmath114 . for odd @xmath11 ,",

    "applies to the upper curves .",
    "+ the asymptotic lines meet at the red point @xmath125 .",
    ", width=453 ]    a related consequence of ( [ s9 ] ) is that the shifted characteristic polynomial @xmath137 will contain only even or odd sub - polynomials @xmath138 .",

    "+ anticipating the result ( [ s16a ] ) it can be shown that the @xmath11 asymptotic lines meet at the point @xmath148 : @xmath149    by the sequence of rational maps ( [ s8 ] ) the closed interval @xmath150 $ ] is mapped as follows : @xmath151\\rightarrow [ 2,+\\infty]\\rightarrow [ -\\infty,-1 ] \\rightarrow[-1,0 ] \\rightarrow [ 1,2 ] \\rightarrow [ \\frac{1}{2},1 ] \\rightarrow [ 0,\\frac{1}{2 } ] \\;.\\ ] ] this set of six closed intervals covers the whole real axis , hence the values of @xmath8 for @xmath152 $ ] completely determine the full spectral curve @xmath153 .",
    "we have already exploited this principle for the discussion of the asymptotic behavior of @xmath8 for @xmath140 .",
    "+ conversely , if we choose some analytic function , restrict it to @xmath152 $ ] and extend it to the full real line by means of the functional equations ( [ s4 ] ) and ( [ s9 ] ) , the resulting function will not automatically be analytic at the borders of the intervals , e.  g.  at @xmath135 .",
    "this makes it plausible that ( [ s4 ] ) and ( [ s9 ] ) impose conditions on the perturbation series ( [ s13 ] ) .",
    "let us consider some small @xmath7 .",
    "after the first three steps of the sequence ( [ s8 ] ) @xmath7 is mapped onto @xmath154 which is again small .",
    "simultaneously , @xmath8 is mapped onto @xmath155 equating the coefficients of the power series ( [ s15a ] ) and ( [ s15b ] ) leads to the following system of equations : @xmath156 consequently , for all @xmath157 the perturbation coefficients @xmath158 , @xmath52 odd , can be expressed in terms of the perturbation coefficients @xmath159 , @xmath160 even and @xmath161 . the first few of the corresponding equations read : @xmath162 sometimes we will switch from the index notation of eigenvalues using @xmath157 to the notation using @xmath163 introduced before . in this notation",

    "we conclude @xmath165 and , by ( [ s16a ] ) , @xmath166 .",
    "especially it follows that @xmath167 , which was previously , in section [ sec : h ] , mentioned as a consequence of the wigner - eckhard theorem .",

    "the eigenvalues of @xmath31 will be constant , i.  e.  , we have the rare case of isospectrality for spin systems , see @xcite . + as a further application of the spectral symmetry we calculate the first five moments of @xmath39 .",

    "general formulas for these polynomials are rare .",
    "the only ones previously known to the author are , besides the explicit expressions for the dimer polynomials @xmath226 , see appendix b , those which result from certain rules given in @xcite . for example , @xmath221 if @xmath213 is a single - bond connection of two disjoint ( possibly empty ) graphs .",

    "the general quantum spin triangle is not integrable in the strict sense that its eigenvalues and eigenvectors can be given in closed form , as , e.  g.  , for the isosceles triangle .",
    "however , our results show that we are rather close to integrability .",
    "the reduced hamiltonian has a triangular matrix representation the entries of which are explicitly given .",
    "hence also the characteristic polynomial can be expressed either recursively or explicitly in terms of finite sums , see appendix a. similarly , the perturbation series for the eigenvalues could , in principle , be calculated up to any finite order , although with rapidly increasing complexity .",

    "+ comparing this situation with , e.  g.  , the bethe ansatz for the @xmath2 chain with @xmath11 spins shows that the difference is not huge .",
    "also in the bethe ansatz the eigenvalues have to be calculated as the numerical solutions of certain equations which become more and more complex for large @xmath11 .",
    "perhaps the general triangle should also be regarded as  quantum integrable \" in some weaker sense .",
    "+ one virtue of integrability in whatever sense is the possibility to calculate certain limits , e.  g.  , the thermodynamic limit @xmath280 in the case of the @xmath2 chain . in the present case",

    "this seems to be a sensible project for future work .",
    "another aspect that has only be touched in the present paper is the closer investigation of physical properties of the general spin triangle , as , for instance , ground state diagrams or magnetization curves . as already pointed out in the introduction",
    ", these properties could be of paradigmatic character in order to understand more complex systems .",
    "to check the equations ( [ m11 ] ) , ( [ m12 ] ) , ( [ m14 ] ) , ( [ m15 ] ) , ( [ t8 ] ) , and ( [ t10 ] ) i have used unpublished results for @xmath239 that have been obtained in collaboration with andre lohmann and johannes richter .",

    "consequently , the computer - algebraic calculation of the characteristic polynomial of @xmath282 is markedly faster than for a general @xmath283-matrix . + we will write down the explicit formula for @xmath288 in order to substantiate our claim that the characteristic polynomial of the general triangle can be given in closed form . to this end",
