    "understanding the place of spiral galaxies in hierarchical models of galaxy formation is of special importance for two main reasons .",
    "firstly , one of the principal , justifiable , assumptions underpinning many studies of galaxy formation in a cold dark matter ( cdm ) context is that all galaxies form initially as discs ( e.g. , baugh , cole & frenk 1996 ; abadi et al .",
    "2003 ; although see nulsen & fabian 1997 for a different view ) .",
    "only subsequently are the signatures of discs erased by ubiquitous process of violent galaxy mergers @xcite .",
    "thus , understanding galaxy discs is a prerequisite for understanding all galaxies .",
    "secondly , because of their ongoing star formation and disc morphology ( indicating a lack of _ recent _ violent mergers ) , spiral disc galaxies give a unique insight into the formation and evolution of `` quiescent '' galaxies .",
    "this quiescent evolution depends strongly on certain processes and the way in which they are modelled , such as gas cooling , star formation ( sf ) and feedback .",
    "these phenomena , because of their complex nature , are amongst the most difficult to incorporate in the models . in this work",
    ", we hope to improve our understanding of these processes by comparing the properties of local spiral galaxies with model spiral galaxies from the semi - analytic cole et al .",
    "( 2000 ; clbf hereafter ) simulations .",
    "semi - analytic models attempt to capture the essential features of galaxy formation in a cdm cosmology using simple but effective parameterisations of the relevant physical processes . in this way",
    ", it becomes possible to establish the relative importance of various processes in determining galaxy properties , and to identify specific areas of uncertainty @xcite .",
    "the results of state - of - the - art , but computationally expensive , @xmath2-body and gas dynamical simulations are used to motivate the prescriptions employed in semi - analytic models to describe processes such as the the growth of dark matter haloes and the radiative cooling of gas @xcite .",
    "the global properties of galaxies are generally well reproduced by semi - analytic models . here",
    ", we highlight just a few of the many successes of this approach .",
    "galaxy sizes , morphological mixes , luminosity functions , the slope and scatter of the tully - fisher ( tf ) relation , and the star formation history ( sfh ) of the universe are all reproduced well ( * ? ? ?",

    "* clbf ) . for spheroids , the black hole mass ",
    "luminosity / velocity dispersion relation and the colour  magnitude relation can be interpreted within this framework @xcite .",
    "furthermore , when combined with high resolution @xmath2-body simulations , these models provide a good description of the clustering properties of galaxies at both low and high redshift @xcite .",
    "however some predictions of the semi - analytic models are not in such good agreement with the observations .",
    "no model has yet been able to match the luminosity function and the tf relation zero - point _",
    "simultaneously _ if the disc circular velocity is constructed in a way that accounts for the gravitational effect of the baryon collapse ( kauffmann et al .  1993 ;",
    "cole et al .",
    "1994 ; heyl et al .",
    "1995 ; somerville & primack 1999 ; van kampen , jimenez & peacock 1999 ; clbf ) .",
    "this problem has also been seen in @xmath2-body gas - dynamic simulations ( navarro & steinmetz 2000 ; eke , navarro & steinmetz 2001 ; n.  katz , 2002 , private communication ) and ` analytical ' studies @xcite . in the model of clbf , who give most weight to matching the luminosity function when",
    "setting model parameter values , this problem manifests itself as a velocity offset of @xmath330 per cent in the zero point of the tf relation ( when the disc circular velocity at the half mass radius is used : when the halo circular velocity is used the offset disappears ) .",
    "furthermore , it is unclear whether it is possible to reproduce the colour - magnitude relation of early - type galaxies without drastically upsetting the agreement with the observed optical and near - ir luminosity functions ( * ? ? ? * clbf ) .",
    "the colour - magnitude relation of spiral galaxies is also poorly - reproduced @xcite ; this is a correlation that we investigate in depth in this paper .",
    "in addition , the radial profiles of model spiral galaxies are roughly exponential , but inevitably have large , prominent central concentrations which are not seen in many later - type spiral galaxies @xcite .    in this paper , we concentrate on the global properties of local spiral galaxy discs in the fiducial model of clbf . by focusing on local discs",
    ", we can develop an understanding of how best to parameterise complex baryonic processes such as star formation and gas cooling , not only for this model , but for all models of this type .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section [ sec : model ]",
    ", we briefly discuss the model . in section [ sec : obs ] , we outline which model observables we test against data , and describe the observational datasets used in these comparisons . in section [ sec : phys ] , we compare model predictions for physical properties of spiral galaxies ( such as luminosity , size or gas fraction ) with the observations . in section [",
    "sec : colour ] , we compare the optical  near - ir colours of a diverse sample of spiral galaxies with the models , to elucidate their metallicities and sfhs . in section",
    "[ sec : sfl ] , we examine the observed and model present day star formation rates ( sfrs ) . we discuss maximum - disc constraints on the model stellar mass to light ratios ( m / ls ) in section [ sec : ml ] . in section",
    "[ sec : spin ] , we revisit the scale - size distribution of spirals ( which was already discussed in clbf ) , in the light of new data . in section [ sec : disc ]",
    ", we present a discussion of the major discrepancies between the models and the observations , identifying a few possibilities for reconciling the two .",
    "finally , we summarise our conclusions in section [ sec : conc ] .",
    "novel features of this paper include : a discussion of comparisons between the observed spiral galaxy scale - size distributions in different passbands with the spin parameter distribution predicted by galaxy formation models ; an explicit comparison between the model and observed sf laws ; a presentation of a novel method for comparing models with inhomogeneously - selected datasets ; a discussion of age and metallicity effects on the spiral galaxy colour - magnitude relations ; and , a demonstration of the utility of comparing spiral galaxy m / ls and their luminosity - linewidth relation to models , simultaneously .",
    "we set @xmath4 hereafter unless stated otherwise .",
    "the semi - analytic model used in this paper is comprehensively described by clbf .",
    "a cursory outline of the model is as follows : ( i ) the growth of dark matter haloes through mergers and accretion is followed using a monte - carlo algorithm .",
    "( ii ) the lowest mass branches of the dark matter halo merger tree are filled with hot gas , which is assumed to be shock - heated to the virial temperature of the halo .",
    "( iii ) gas is allowed to cool by atomic radiative processes .",
    "( iv ) cooled gas is turned into stars according to an adopted star formation law . (",
    "v ) the return of energy into the cooled gas , by stellar winds or supernovae , reheats a fraction of this gas , thereby providing a feedback mechanism to regulate star formation ; this is particularly effective in low circular velocity haloes .",
    "( vi ) galaxies merge with the central galaxy in a halo if their dynamical friction timescale is shorter than the lifetime of the host dark matter halo . a violent merger is marked by a burst of star formation and the destruction of any stellar disc .",
    "the semi - analytic model of clbf follows the chemical evolution of gas and stars and uses the bruzual & charlot stellar population synthesis model to compute the luminosity of a galaxy in any desired passband .    here",
    ", we provide only a brief description of the physical processes which we show have a direct bearing on the properties of disc galaxies : gas cooling and disc formation , star formation and feedback , and the chemical and stellar evolution of galaxies .",
    "we discuss in section [ sec : disc ] what changes are produced in the model predictions if some of the prescriptions adopted by clbf are varied .",
    "we note that the fiducial model of clbf assumes a baryon density a factor of two lower than subsequent measurements have indicated @xcite .",
    "we discuss the effects of cosmic baryon density later in section [ sec : disc ] .      motivated by the results of extensive @xmath2-body simulations ,",
    "the dark matter is assumed to follow a navarro , frenk & white density profile .",
    "haloes also have a hot gas component which is assumed to have been shock - heated to the virial temperature of that halo during that halo s collapse .",
    "motivated by the simulations of eke et al . , we assume that the hot gas follows a @xmath5-model profile , @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the core radius of the gas distribution .",
    "the core radius starts as a constant fraction of the halo size , and grows as low entropy gas cools ( the growth is roughly a factor of four by the present day ) .",
    "the rate at which gas cools is density and metallicity - dependent , and is quite sensitive to this hot gas density profile : this means that different assumptions about the density profile can produce significant changes in the formation history and angular momentum content of present - day discs ( although comparison of gas - dynamical models and the semi - analytic prescription have given a reassuring overall agreement ; benson et al .",
    "2001 ; helly et al .",
    "2002b ) .",
    "the dark matter and hot gas have angular momentum , imparted by tidal torques .",
    "the magnitude of the dark matter and gas angular momentum are characterised by the dimensionless spin parameter @xmath8 , where @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 are the total halo mass , angular momentum and energy . motivated by the @xmath2-body simulations of cole & lacey , we adopt a log - normal distribution of @xmath12 with mean 0.039 and logarithmic width 0.53 .",
    "this distribution agrees with more recent determinations @xcite . in order to estimate the radial distribution of angular momentum in the halo and gas",
    ", we choose to adopt a constant mean rotation velocity within the halo as a function of radius , broadly consistent with the results of cole & lacey . during cooling and collapse",
    "we assume that the gas conserves angular momentum and forms a disc .",
    "the assumption of conservation of angular momentum leads to good agreement between predicted and observed galaxy sizes ( e.g. , mo , mao & white 1998 , clbf ) .",
    "however , this assumption is not supported by gas - dynamical simulations of galaxy formation which include radiative cooling , but no effective stellar feedback . in these gas - dynamical simulations ,",
    "the gas transfers most of its angular momentum to the dark haloes , resulting in galaxy sizes that are much smaller than observed @xcite .",
    "feedback from star formation may promote conservation of angular momentum , leading to better agreement with observed disc sizes ( e.g. , weil , eke & efstathiou 1998 ; thacker & couchman 2001 ) . in order to be consistent with the observed distribution of disc sizes",
    ", we assume that angular momentum is conserved ; we leave the mechanism by which it is conserved as an as yet unanswered question .    in this paper , we compare the properties of observed field spiral galaxies with _ central _ halo disc - dominated galaxies in haloes less massive than @xmath13 m@xmath14 . this selection is made because observationally , our sample galaxies are typically reasonably isolated , or are at least the dominant members of their group , and @xmath13 m@xmath14 is the halo mass of a large group or small cluster .",
    "we do not compare the observations with model satellite galaxies .",
    "gas is assumed to cool only onto the galaxy at the centre of a halo ( see van kampen , jimenez & peacock 1999 for an alternative cooling model ) .",
    "thus , satellite galaxies are starved of a fresh infalling gas supply , and quickly fade and redden .",
    "it is impossible to test the accuracy of this assumption using observations of what are more than likely to correspond to central halo galaxies in our model . including satellite galaxies in the comparisons with the observed data leaves our conclusions regarding luminous discs unchanged",
    "; however , it would introduce a substantial population of non - star - forming , red discs at lower luminosities ( in clear conflict with the data ) .",
    "gas is converted into stars at the rate @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the sfr , @xmath17 is the mass of cold gas , and @xmath18 is the timescale for star formation .",
    "this timescale is related to the disc dynamical timescale , @xmath19 , and the disc potential : @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is a star formation efficiency , @xmath22 is the circular velocity of the disc at the half - mass radius , and @xmath23 governs the galaxy mass dependence in the sf law . if @xmath24 , the star formation timescale is simply proportional to the disc dynamical timescale .",
    "clbf s fiducial model adopts @xmath25 to suppress star formation in smaller haloes , ensuring a good match to the observed high gas fractions of less luminous galaxies .    in this model ,",
    "energy from supernovae and stellar winds ejects cold gas and metals from the disc into the halo .",
    "the mass of cold gas ejected into the halo is given by @xmath26 , where @xmath27 ; @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the parameters that govern the strength of the feedback process .",
    "the cold gas takes its share of metals with it into the halo .",
    "none of the freshly - synthesised metals are ejected directly into the halo .",
    "this freshly - ejected gas plays no role in gas cooling until is incorporated into a hot gas halo as a result of a galaxy merger .",
    "these parameter values are quoted for the fiducial model ; in particular , @xmath29 was adopted so that the model predictions are in agreement with both the slope of the faint end of the luminosity function and the shape of the tf relation .",
    "adopting a larger value of @xmath30 leads to excessive curvature in the tf relation ( cole et al .",
    "if feedback was not included , the luminosity function would be much steeper than that estimated from observations @xcite .",
    "chemical evolution of the gas and stars is followed assuming that the initial reservoir of gas is free of metals .",
    "metals are formed by stars and incorporated into the cold gas using the instantaneous recycling approximation @xcite .",
    "furthermore , some of the cold gas may be ejected into the halo , taking with it its share of metals .",
    "the luminosities , spectra and integrated colours of the stellar components are modelled using the stellar population synthesis ( sps ) models of bruzual & charlot ( in preparation ) , which are described in more detail in lui , charlot & graham and charlot & longhetti .",
    "the models allow for a wide range of stellar ages and metallicities .",
    "briefly , stellar populations with older ages or higher metallicities are redder and fainter ( because of lower mean stellar temperatures ) than populations which are younger , or have lower metallicity . uncertainties in the predictions of the colours , luminosities and spectra of sps models for older stellar populations are @xmath310 per cent @xcite",
    "we assume a universal stellar initial mass function ( imf ) : the one adopted by kennicutt .",
    "this imf is similar to a salpeter imf at the high mass end ( and therefore has similar colours ) , but has fewer low mass stars ( and therefore has a lower stellar",
    "m / l , by around a factor of two ) . in order to match the zero point of the luminosity function , the stellar",
    "m / l is increased by a factor of 1.38 ( which was ascribed to a contribution to the total stellar mass from brown dwarves , but in reality simply reflects uncertainty in the shape of the imf at low masses ) .",
    "this imf , with this modification of stellar",
    "m / l , is consistent with estimates of and limits on stellar m / ls ( bell & de jong 2001 ; clbf ; see also section [ sec : ml ] ) .",
    "dust affects the luminosities and colours of stellar populations .",
    "dust is taken into account using the model of ferrara et al .  , which assumes a smooth dust distribution mixed in with the stellar disc .",
    "the overall optical depth of the galaxy is computed self consistently using the total mass of metals per unit area in the cold gas .",
    "the luminosities and colours of the model galaxies include the effects of dust , assuming a random distribution of galaxy inclinations @xmath31 degrees ( in the case of the predictions presented in this paper ) .",
    "we choose this inclination distribution to mimic as closely as possible the observational selection of the bell & de jong sample .",
    "the optical  near - infrared luminosity and colour effects of dust for @xmath31 degrees galaxies are relatively minimal in this model , and our results are not significantly affected by assuming a clumpy dust distribution @xcite , or by neglecting the effects of dust entirely ( @xmath32 mag and @xmath33 mag respectively , for the most dusty , usually most luminous model galaxies ; these effects are smaller than the dust vectors in figs .   [",
    "fig : colcolmag][fig : colcolfg ] ) .",
    "we select disc - dominated galaxies from the fiducial model of clbf with @xmath34-band bulge - to - disc ratios @xmath35 to compare with observations ( see baugh et al .",
    "1996 for a plot of @xmath36 versus t - type ) .",
    "different aspects of this comparison allow us to focus in detail on the following model features",
    ".    * differences in the luminosity function probe the physics of galaxy mergers and gas heating and cooling processes . *",
    "the colours of spiral galaxies are driven by their stellar populations , which in turn allow us to test the gas cooling , star formation and feedback prescriptions . *",
    "the sfrs of spiral galaxies primarily reflect the adopted star formation prescription . * the observational limits on the m / ls of spiral galaxies depend principally on the imf .",
    "when combined with the tf relation , further insight can be gleaned about the imf and the fraction of dark matter contained within the inner parts of galaxies . *",
    "the sizes of spiral galaxies primarily constrain the adopted distribution of angular momentum or , equivalently , the halo spin parameter .    in this paper",
    ", we compare the model predictions with a number of datasets .    1",
    ".   an inhomogeneously - selected sample of 121 galaxies from bell & de jong .",
    "this sample lacks a well - defined selection criterion ; however , it has high - quality optical  near - ir colours at the disc half - light radius , accurate physical parameters , and is very diverse , allowing the exploration of the properties of a huge range of galaxy discs .",
    "it is a combination of three samples : de jong , which is diameter - limited ; tully et al .",
    ", which is volume - limited ( with magnitude and surface brightness cutoffs ) ; and bell et al .  , which is selected to have low surface brightness ( lsb ) , and as wide a range of luminosity , size and colour as possible .",
    "due to the inhomogeneous selection , the selection of model galaxies for comparison with these observations is made by matching with the observed @xmath34-band surface brightness and @xmath34-band luminosity ( and , therefore , to within a factor of two , the stellar surface density and mass ; bell & de jong 2001 ) of each galaxy in the sample .",

    "* clbf ) , when we feel that their discussion will prove useful .",
    "in this section , we introduce the method used to select model galaxies to compare with the inhomogeneously - selected dataset of bell & de jong .",
    "we also discuss the luminosities , surface brightnesses and gas fractions of the model galaxies and examine how well they match the observations .",
    "we adopt total @xmath34-band magnitudes corrected for galactic foreground extinction following schlegel , finkbeiner & davis .",
    "central surface brightnesses @xmath38 are extrapolated disc - only central surface brightnesses , corrected to face - on assuming the optically - thin limit @xcite .",
    "we do not account for dust extinction owing to dust in the individual galaxies , as this is accounted for in the galaxy modelling .    in fig .",

    "we ensure that we compare observed galaxies with model galaxies with appropriate luminosities and disc central surface brightnesses .    examining the upper left - hand panel of fig .",

    "the optical  near - ir colours of stellar populations with ongoing star formation ( such as those in spiral galaxies ) can potentially provide a powerful insight into the sfhs and metallicities of those populations .",
    "essentially , optical colours are sensitive to the position of the main sequence turn - off , whereas near - ir colours are more sensitive to the properties of the red giants and asymptotic giant branch stars . using the optical and near - ir colours together , it is possible to differentiate between the effects of metallicity and , to first order , the ratio of young ( @xmath472 gyr ) to old stars ( which can be taken as an age , or a kind of birthrate parameter ; de jong 1996 ; bell & de jong 2000 ) .",

    "to give an impression of the trends expected in optical  near - ir colours resulting from changes in galaxy age and metallicity , we overplot stellar population models from bruzual & charlot ( in preparation ) , as described in more detail by liu , charlot & graham ( 2000 ) .",
    "the model of kodama & arimoto , or the multi - metallicity pgase stellar population model ( see fioc & rocca - volmerange 1997 for an earlier version of this model ) give similar optical  near - ir colours .",
    "the stellar population models , like the models of clbf , adopt the imf used by kennicutt .",
    "these models assume an exponentially decreasing sfr with an @xmath52-folding time @xmath53 , @xmath54 ; star formation is assumed to start 12 gyr ago .",
    "models with the same metallicity but different @xmath53 are connected by solid lines ; models with different metallicities and the same @xmath53 are connected by dashed lines .",

    "the @xmath49 colours of the model galaxies match the observed colours well . to the extent that one believes that @xmath55 colours are a reasonable metallicity indicator ,",
    "this indicates that the metallicity  luminosity relation for model spiral galaxies is a good match to the observed metallicity  luminosity relation .",
    "in contrast , clbf found that the metallicity ",
    "luminosity relation predicted by the model was shallower than the gas metallicity ",
    "luminosity relation from zaritsky , kennicutt & huchra .",
    "there are no systematic trends in the model between the gas and stellar metallicities that would generate a difference in the slopes of the gas and stellar metallicity  magnitude relations .",
    "we note , however , that there is a disagreement between the observational datasets .",
    "16 of bell & de jong compares metallicities derived from the optical  near - ir colours with gas metallicities from zaritsky et al .  , amongst other studies . where the colour - based metallicities are reasonably reliable ( at metallicities @xmath561 dex ) , bell & de jong find that the colours suggest a shallower metallicity - luminosity relation and somewhat lower metallicities than the strong - line derived region abundances ( see , e.g. , kennicutt , bresolin & garnett 2003 for a discussion of the limitations of strong - line region abundances ) .",
    "thus , we conclude that the metallicity ",
    "luminosity relation of the clbf model is in agreement with the data , to within the systematic uncertainties .",
    "in contrast , the trends in observed @xmath48 colour with absolute magnitude are relatively poorly matched by the models ( recall that @xmath48 colour is more sensitive to sfh than metallicity ; fig .",

    "model galaxies are @xmath57 mag bluer in @xmath48 colour than the observed galaxies , indicating that the luminous model galaxies have too much ongoing star formation .",
    "the distributions of model and observed galaxy colours are inconsistent at much greater than 99.9 per cent confidence . at lower luminosities ,",

    "[ fig : sfl ] is a close correspondence between the ratio of the gas surface density to the dynamical time and the gas surface density for both the real and model galaxies ( fig .",

    "however , signatures of the dynamical time term are visible , especially in the distribution of the model points .",
    "in particular , the dynamical time is largest for galaxies with gas surface densities between 10m@xmath14pc@xmath67 and 30m@xmath14pc@xmath67 , and lower for galaxies with higher and lower gas densities within . at the low density end ,",
    "galaxy discs are smaller and typically low surface brightness , thus is relatively small .",
    "these galaxies are also dark matter dominated , thus driving down the dynamical time , and driving up the ratio of gas surface density to dynamical time . at the high density end",
    ", the large surface density of baryons ( and the attendant increase in dark matter density through the adiabatic response of the dark matter to the large baryon density ) causes these galaxies to have shorter dynamical times .",
    "this can be illustrated very simply by neglecting the influence of dark matter , assuming gas fractions of order unity , and assuming that galaxies have identical ; then @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the gas surface density within .",
    "this would give @xmath79 ( as denoted by the dotted line ) .",
    "whatever the driving mechanism is that causes ( weak ) departures from a linear relationship between @xmath78 and @xmath80 , it is clear that sf laws formulated using either parameter are practically indistinguishable using present - day sfrs alone .",
    "one of the most serious shortcomings of semi - analytic galaxy formation models is their inability to match the luminosity function and the zero - point of the tully - fisher ( tf ) relation simultaneously when the rotation velocity of the disc is properly constructed ( e.g. , white & frenk 1991 , kauffmann et al .",
    "1993 ; cole et al .  1994 ; heyl et al .  1995 ;",
    "somerville & primack 1999 ; clbf ) .",
    "clbf constrain their models to reproduce the @xmath81-band and @xmath34-band luminosity functions ; however , these models fail to match the zero - point of the tf relation ( when disc circular velocities are used the offset is @xmath31 mag , or 30 per cent in terms of circular velocity , in the sense that galaxies are either too faint or they rotate too quickly ) .",
    "a fresh insight into the problem can be obtained by considering the mass - to - light ( m / l ) ratios of spiral galaxies .",
    "the zero - point of the tf relation is intimately related to stellar m / ls : for example , larger stellar m / ls than inferred from observation would lead to fainter galaxies , resulting in an offset from the zero - point of the tf relation .",
    "the stellar m / ls of the models were discussed briefly in section 7.7 of clbf and were found to be roughly consistent with observations . in this section , we discuss the stellar m / l of model and observed discs in greater detail ; we discuss the relationship to the tf relation in more detail in section [ disc : tf ] .",
    "observationally , stellar m / ls are difficult to estimate reliably .",
    "m / l values in the solar neighbourhood are inferred using dynamical arguments and by direct accounting of the stellar mass ( e.g.  binney & tremaine 1987 ) . estimates of m / l in spiral galaxies can be obtained from ( challenging ) measurements of velocity dispersion , under some assumptions about the disc vertical structure @xcite .",
    "alternatively , upper limits on the stellar m / l can be derived from estimating the m / l required to maximise the contribution of the stars to the observed rotation curve : this is called the _ maximum disc _ stellar m / l estimate @xcite .    here , we focus on comparing model stellar m / ls with observations of maximum disc stellar m / ls .",
    "this is facilitated by recent results from bell & de jong , who argue that stellar",
    "m / l is primarily a function of colour , almost completely independent of sfh and model uncertainties . in fig .",
    "[ fig : ml](a ) , we compare the observed @xmath34-band maximum disc stellar m / l estimates for spiral galaxies in the ursa major cluster @xcite with stellar m / ls from the fiducial model of clbf , as a function of @xmath48 colour .",

    "an important point is that the stellar m / l of a given observed galaxy can not exceed its maximum disc value . increasing the amount of dark matter in the inner parts of a galaxy",
    "requires a corresponding decrease in the stellar m / l , as shown by the arrows .",
    "the lower envelope of the observed galaxies is the key constraint : observed galaxies with maximum disc stellar m / ls substantially larger than this lower envelope are likely to be dark matter dominated , primarily lsb , galaxies .",
    "the rotation curve of ngc 4085 suffers from substantial beam smearing , which artificially lowers the observed m / l .",
    "we therefore ignore this galaxy in the following discussion .",
    "further discussion of the sources of error in , and the implications of , this plot are presented in bell & de jong .    from fig .",
    "[ fig : ml](a ) it is clear that the model galaxies have stellar m / ls which are consistent with the m / l values inferred using the maximum disc assumption ( in agreement with clbf s less detailed analysis of spiral discs )",
    ". however , galaxies in the semi - analytic model are in fact poorly described by the maximum disc model as they have a significant amount of dark matter within the half - light radius of the disc .",
    "this is clearly shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ml](b ) , in which we plot the m /",
    "l for model galaxies using a dynamical estimate of the mass contained within the half mass radius , derived from the rotation speed .",
    "the inclusion of the dark matter component increases the scatter in the model m / l values and also shifts the lower envelope upwards by around 60 per cent .",
    "this effect is similar in size to the offset in the zero - point of the tf relation .",
    "possible solutions to this discrepancy are discussed later in section [ disc : tf ] , and include a reduced amount of dark matter in the inner parts of galaxies , and a reduced stellar m / l .",
    "the distribution of disc scale - sizes , as a function of luminosity , is a powerful test of the assumed distribution of initial halo angular momentum , under the assumption of angular momentum conservation during disc formation .",
    "the disc sizes were calculated by equating the disc specific angular momentum with the mean specific angular momentum of the cooled gas , accounting for the dark matter and gas profiles , disc self - gravity , the gravitational influence of the halo and bulge , and adiabatic contraction of these components as a response to disc formation ( * ? ? ? * clbf ) .",
    "the form of the distribution of halo specific angular momentum has been firmly established by @xmath2-body simulations ( e.g. , barnes & efstathiou 1987 ; efstathiou et al .",
    "1988 ; zurek , quinn & salmon 1988 ) .",
    "the logarithmic width of the distribution of the dimensionless spin parameter , @xmath12 is @xmath84 , essentially independently of galaxy halo parameters @xcite . at low luminosities , the scale - size distribution also tests the feedback model . in fact , the strength of feedback is tuned , in part , to reproduce the observed trend in the scale - size distribution as a function of luminosity ( clbf ) .",
    "the distribution of scale - size as a function of luminosity was tested by both clbf ( their fig .",

    "because @xmath87 is believed to be independent of halo properties , this is not a trivial discrepancy to rectify .",
    "possible solutions were discussed by de jong & lacey , and include disc instabilities and the adoption of thresholds for star formation and feedback ( e.g.  martin & kennicutt 2001 ) .    since then , there have been three papers which have published determinations of the width of the scale - size distribution : cross & driver with a 45000-galaxy sample from the two degree field galaxy redshift survey @xcite , and kauffmann et al .   and shen et al .   with @xmath3120000-galaxy samples from the sloan digital sky survey @xcite . whereas the hybrid stellar mass@xmath88-band determination of kauffmann et al .",
    "( 2003 ) yielded a distribution with a width equivalent to @xmath89 , cross & driver s photographic @xmath81 sample gave a spin distribution width of only @xmath90 !",
    "shen et al.s distribution showed @xmath91 in @xmath92-band , with @xmath93 galaxies having lower valies of @xmath87 .",
    "we note that shen et al .",
    "present simple model - based interpretation of this distribution ( in the spirit of mo et al .",
    "1998 ) , which we do not discuss further here .",
    "however , these seemingly discrepant results ( with widths of 0.25 in @xmath81-band , @xmath30.35 in @xmath92-band around @xmath94 and in @xmath85-band , and 0.45 in terms of stellar mass ) can , in fact be explained if variations in the stellar populations and the dust content of spiral galaxies are taken into account .",
    "the scale - size  luminosity distribution can be thought of as a surface brightness  luminosity distribution , by noting that @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is the luminosity , @xmath97 is the surface brightness and @xmath92 is the scale - size .",
    "thus , effectively , what is sought is the width of the stellar surface density  stellar mass distribution , whereas what is observed is the surface brightness  luminosity distribution .",
    "it is well - known that there is a correlation between surface density and sf history , such that at low surface density , galaxies tend to have rather younger mean stellar ages ( and therefore lower stellar m / ls , especially so in bluer bands ; bell & de jong 2001 ) than higher surface density galaxies @xcite .",
    "furthermore , higher surface density galaxies will tend to have somewhat more dust because of the combined effect of higher surface density and higher metallicity @xcite .",
    "thus , at high surface density the surface brightness becomes somewhat lower , and for low surface density the surface brightness becomes somewhat higher ( both trends are stronger in the bluer bands ) .",
    "thus , the width of the surface brightness  luminosity distribution will be decreased compared to the surface density  mass distribution , particularly so in the bluer bands ( as is observed , with @xmath98 in @xmath81 , 0.35 in @xmath85 , and 0.45 in terms of stellar mass ) .",
    "quantitatively , the magnitude of this effect can be crudely estimated using the results of bell & de jong and the surface brightness - dependent dust correction of de jong & lacey . from the models of bell & de jong , @xmath99 in the @xmath46 and @xmath85 bands",
    "is roughly proportional to @xmath100 and @xmath101 , respectively , where @xmath102 denotes the surface brightness in the @xmath34-band . using the @xmath85-band as an example ,",
    "the surface brightness is given by : @xmath103 , where @xmath104 is the luminosity surface density in @xmath85-band , and @xmath97 is the mass surface density .",
    "taking @xmath105 , where @xmath106 is the stellar surface mass density ( this assumption makes only a @xmath107% difference to the final answer ) , @xmath108 ( the corresponding result in @xmath46-band is @xmath109 ) .",
    "thus , differences in stellar m / l alone across the surface brightness distribution cause the distribution to decrease in width by 15% in @xmath85-band and 30% in @xmath46-band .",
    "the effect of dust is less trivial to estimate .",
    "de jong & lacey dust - correct their data to a face - on aspect , making the impact of dust extinction modest in this case and therefore relatively easy to deduce",
    ". de jong & lacey estimate a 5% effect on the @xmath85-band half - light surface brightness , when going from an inclination of 60 degrees to face - on .",
    "it is perhaps not absurd to postulate a further 5% effect when going from face - on , extinguished , to face - on , dust - corrected . using the extinction curve of gordon et al .   to estimate the effect in the @xmath46-band ( a factor of 2.75 greater than in the @xmath85-band ) , and noting that cross & driver do not extinction correct their data ( and , therefore , the correction from 60 degrees to unextinguished is perhaps more appropriate ) , leads to an estimate of around a 30% effect in @xmath46 band",
    "thus , the observed @xmath85-band and @xmath46-band widths of @xmath110 and @xmath111 correspond to `` mass '' widths of @xmath112 for @xmath85-band , and a @xmath46-band `` mass '' width of @xmath113 .",
    "both values are fully consistent with kauffmann et al.s `` stellar mass '' value of @xmath114 and the theoretical estimates of @xmath84 .",
    "it should be borne in mind that these are rough estimates of this effect ; more systematic investigation of the width of the luminosity  surface brightness ( or scale - size ) distributions as a function of passband will further test and refine this crude correction ( bell , mcintosh , katz & weinberg 2003 , in preparation ) .",
    "many of the properties of spiral galaxies are well - matched by the models of clbf .",
    "for example , the gas fractions are quite well - matched , with only a small excess of gas - poor galaxies , the metallicities are matched to within the errors , the model scale sizes reproduce the data well , the optical  near - ir colours as a function of gas fraction are accurate , and the present - day sfrs are a good match to the observational data .",
    "nevertheless , the keenest insight into the models is gained when exploring aspects that poorly match the observations .",
    "therefore , we focus in this section on the discrepancies between the fiducial model and the observations . sections [ disc : mag ] discusses the deficit of the most luminous model spiral galaxies , [ disc : col ] discusses the ` backwards ' optical colour  magnitude relation of model spiral galaxies , and section [ disc : tf ] explores the relationship between the model stellar m / ls and the tf relation",
    ".      both the datasets of de jong & lacey and bell & de jong support the view that the models of clbf under - produce luminous , large , spiral galaxies .",
    "we explore this deficit in more detail in fig .",
    "[ fig : lf ] .",
    "two observational determinations of the @xmath34-band luminosity function of late - type galaxies are shown by open symbols @xcite and filled symbols @xcite . the two studies morphologically classify their galaxies using totally different methodologies .",
    "kochanek et al .",
    "classify their galaxy samples visually , whereas bell et al .",
    "use the sloan digital sky survey @xmath92-band concentration parameter to classify the galaxies , following strateva et al .  .",
    "the model @xmath34-band luminosity function for galaxies with @xmath35 in @xmath34-band is shown by the solid blue line .",
    "the faint end slope of the observations and models are different ; at least part of this discrepancy is because of incompleteness in the two micron all sky survey with respect to low surface brightness galaxies @xcite , although some of this discrepancy may be real .",
    "significantly , the luminosity function of galaxies with @xmath34-band @xmath35 cuts off sharply above @xmath115 , in clear contrast to the observational data . because the parameters of the clbf model are chosen to reproduce the _ total _ observed local luminosity function closely , it is challenging to construct a model which produces more luminous spiral galaxies without violating the constraints of the overall luminosity function . because of this , there are two possible solutions to these problems : first , that many of the most luminous model galaxies are being incorrectly converted into ellipticals ; and second , that the prescription for the accretion of gas by spirals may require modification .",
    "the first possibility is that the underproduction of bright spirals is linked to deficiencies in the parameterisation of the physics of galaxy mergers .",
    "the mass ratio at which ( major ) mergers transform spirals into ellipticals is tuned to reproduce the morphological mix of galaxies brighter than @xmath116 .",
    "nevertheless , there are a number of bulge - dominated galaxies in haloes less massive than 10@xmath117 with @xmath118 and with magnitudes up to @xmath119 .",
    "if mergers were , for some reason , less effective in transforming spirals into ellipticals , it may be possible to produce a larger population of red , massive spirals .",
    "this could be achieved by altering the prescription for redistributing the disc stars after a major merger ; for example , a good fraction of the pre - existing stellar population could be transferred to a thick disc instead of being assigned to a spheroid component ( see , e.g. , dalcanton & bernstein 2002 ) .",
    "alternatively , the dynamical friction calculation of orbital decay may underestimate the merger timescale due to the neglect of mass stripping from the satellite @xcite . to explore the possibility that galaxies could be mislabeled in the model ,",
    "we extend the comparison with observation in fig .",
    "[ fig : bd100 ] to include model galaxies with @xmath120 .",
    "using this extreme cut - off , the model produces as many luminous galaxies as required ( to within the typing uncertainties ) .",
    "furthermore , these additional galaxies are very red , bettering the match between model and observed luminous spiral galaxies .",
    "such an extreme shift in the boundary of the @xmath36 ratio demarcating spirals and ellipticals is a highly unattractive option , however , as this would grossly violate the constraints on the morphological mix of bright galaxies , and substantially under - produce the observed luminosity function of early - type galaxies .",
    "the other possibility is that the prescription for accretion of cool gas by spiral galaxies may require modification .",
    "this could be modelled by changing the gas cooling prescription .",
    "indeed , when clbf changed the density profile of cooling gas , the bright end of the luminosity function was substantially affected ( their fig .  6 , panel c ) .",
    "the @xmath5-profile adopted by clbf was chosen as it is in good agreement with the results of numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "furthermore , comparisons of gas cooling in semi - analytic and gas - dynamical simulations have , rather encouragingly , given , similar results overall ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* although see katz et al .",
    "2002 for a differing viewpoint ) . an interesting and potentially fruitful approach ( which is beyond the scope of this paper ) would be to search for a physical motivation for a modification of the gas cooling which allows more gas inflow at earlier times ( to produce brighter , discy galaxies ) and less infall now ( to produce redder bright galaxies ) to address both the under - production of large , bright spiral galaxies and the rather blue colours of bright model spiral galaxies .",
    "another way to vary the amount of gas accreted by spiral galaxies is to modify the feedback prescription .",
    "we examine a variant of the clbf fiducial model in fig .",
    "[ fig : super ] . in this new model , the baryon density is twice the value used by clbf , in line with recent constraints on primordial nucleosynthesis inferred from quasar absorption line studies @xcite .",
    "a further key change is that some fraction of the gas reheated by feedback is permanently ejected in a `` superwind '' @xcite .",
    "the removal of baryons by the superwind has the consequence that fuel is removed from the more massive galaxies that form later on in the hierarchy .",
    "the superwind model does somewhat better than the fiducial model of clbf at reproducing large scale length , bright spirals .",
    "this strong feedback delays gas cooling to somewhat later epochs , yielding larger galaxy sizes .",
    "the feedback does not delay this gas cooling too long , however , and indeed is efficient enough to substantially suppress very late gas cooling , yielding relatively red colours for these large scale - length galaxies .",
    "typically , models with a `` high '' baryon fraction ( @xmath121 as opposed to the value of @xmath122 adopted in the fiducial model of clbf ) require a significant fraction of brown dwarfs to be invoked in order to match the luminosity function at @xmath123 .",
    "this is not the case in the superwind model , which predicts m / ls in line with those presented in section [ sec : ml ] ( because baryons that would have been locked up into brown dwarfs in a high baryon fraction model without superwinds are incorporated in these energetic winds and lost forever in the superwind model ) .",
    "a significant challenge to this model , however , is the stringent energetic requirement : the amount of energy required to eject the gas exceeds that available in stellar winds and supernovae , necessitating a significant contribution from active galactic nuclei @xcite .",
    "arguably the most significant discrepancy between the models and the data is the ` backwards ' colour  magnitude relation .",
    "the data clearly indicate that bright spiral galaxies are redder in the optical than fainter spiral galaxies .",
    "in contrast , the models predict that fainter spiral galaxies should be slightly redder than bright spiral galaxies ( figs .",
    "[ fig : colcolmag ] and [ fig : colcum ] ) .",
    "this result is robust to _ modest _ changes in the @xmath36 limits we adopt , up to @xmath124 .",
    "a more sophisticated dust model is unlikely to help in this respect , as we saw earlier that varying the dust prescription produced only a very minor effect ( much smaller than the discrepancy discussed here ) , and in any case would not address the red colours of the faint model disc galaxies .",
    "that the models should predict that the colours of luminous spiral galaxies would be bluer than their fainter counterparts is relatively easy to understand .",
    "hierarchical galaxy formation models predict that small halos are assembled before larger haloes ; therefore , it is natural to find that more massive galaxies in larger haloes should have bluer colours , indicative of younger stellar populations , than those of less massive galaxies in smaller haloes .",
    "thus , the challenge is to find a mechanism which can override this natural sequence of formation by ensuring that the stellar populations ending up in more massive spirals today can form earlier than those ending up in less massive spiral galaxies .",
    "we discuss three possible remedies for this discrepancy : varying the definition of the model spiral galaxies , varying the prescription for turning gas into stars , and varying the amount of gas in the galaxies in the first place .",
    "one of the options discussed in section [ disc : mag ] for increasing the numbers of luminous spiral galaxies was making morphological transformation from a disc - dominated to a spheroidal galaxy more difficult .",
    "this increases the number of red galaxies in the most luminous bin ( the right hand panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : bd100 ] ) , in better accord with the observations .",
    "this comes , however , at the cost of violating constraints set by the morphological mix of @xmath116 galaxies , making this option relatively unattractive . furthermore",
    ", this does not affect the faint model galaxy colours , which remain too red .",
    "another possible way to both redden the most luminous model galaxies and make the faintest model galaxies bluer is to modify the sf law .",
    "indeed , bell & bower argued that a sf law of the type used here may imprint a weak ` backwards ' optical colour  magnitude relation ( brighter galaxies blue and fainter galaxies red ) .",
    "however , tests that we have carried out have shown that the use of ( for example ) a density - dependent star formation law does not significantly affect the colours of spiral galaxies in this model .",
    "furthermore , van den bosch adopts a density - dependent schmidt sf law in his semi - analytic model , and finds , if anything , a stronger ` backwards ' colour  magnitude relation for spiral galaxies than the model explored in this paper .",
    "perhaps the most promising possibility for altering the colours of the brightest spiral galaxies is to modify the gas accretion prescriptions ( as discussed above ; this is also the favoured solution of van den bosch 2002 ) .",
    "varying the amount of gas that cools onto luminous model galaxies can substantially change their recent sfh ( as well as their luminosities ; clbf ) .",
    "however , a detailed exploration of this possibility is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "varying the amount of gas that can cool today through modifications to the feedback prescription ( the superwinds model ) does clearly produce a number of optically red , large scale length spiral galaxies , in much better agreement with the observations .",
    "however , as is expected for a model with very strong feedback at all galaxy masses , the metallicity  magnitude relation is somewhat too shallow ( the metallicity , as measured by @xmath49 colour , is too low for the luminous spiral galaxies ; not shown ) .",
    "another significant challenge is that the strong feedback makes faint disc - dominated galaxies even redder than the fiducial model , exacerbating the already poor match between the red model galaxies and the observed blue galaxies .",
    "further work is required to explore the origin of the spiral galaxy colour  magnitude relation in more detail .      in section",
    "[ sec : ml ] , we discussed the _ stellar _ m / ls of model galaxies from clbf , finding that they are as large as can be plausibly accommodated by the data .",
    "thus , in order for the model galaxies to satisfy observed maximum disc constraints they must have little dark matter in their inner parts .",
    "however , in the fiducial model , typically 60 per cent of the mass in the inner half - light radius of the galaxy is non - baryonic dark matter ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ml](b ) ) .",
    "this is exactly the offset that the models have from the observed tf relation : the rotation speed ( which is proportional to the square root of the enclosed mass ) is too high at a given luminosity .",
    "this is the origin of the discrepancy between the good match to the luminosity function and the poor match to the zero - point of the tf relation .",
    "this discrepancy could be alleviated by lowering the stellar m / ls to become substantially sub - maximal , in concert with reducing the overall mass of baryons that end up in discs .",
    "this is achieved by clbf in their @xmath125 model ( which was considered by clbf only to illustrate the effects of parameter changes on the results ) , which , because it is normalised to reproduce the luminosity function of galaxies , needs to produce the same amount of light with a smaller baryonic mass , leading to a lower stellar m / l .",
    "it is worth noting that this baryon density is four times lower than the current best estimate for the cosmic baryon density from both big bang nucleosynthesis @xcite and the cosmic microwave background @xcite , and is strongly ruled out  we discuss this case to illustrate lower stellar m / ls only .",
    "this lower baryonic mass in the disc leads to less adiabatic contraction of the halo . for both reasons ,",
    "disc circular velocities are lowered , leading to a smaller offset from the tf relation .",
    "the level to which all discs , even hsb spiral galaxies , could be sub - maximal is a matter of intense debate ( see e.g.  courteau & rix 1999 ; weiner et al .",
    "2001 and references therein ) .",
    "the tightness of the lower envelope of the observed stellar",
    "m / l  colour correlation in fig .",
    "[ fig : ml ] suggests that at least the highest surface brightness galaxies have to be a roughly constant fraction of maximal ( of course , maximal discs automatically adhere to that constraint ) .",
    "alternatively , the discrepancy could be alleviated by reducing the amount of dark matter in the inner parts of the galaxy , by for example changing the dark matter halo profile to have a flatter core .",
    "this has been suggested a number of times in the past , to better explain e.g.  the rotation curves of lsb galaxies @xcite , or lensing constraints on kpc scales in elliptical galaxies @xcite .",
    "an _ ad hoc _ modification of this kind is relatively unattractive , at least from a theoretical point of view , given the strength of @xmath2-body evidence indicating that cold dark matter haloes should be at least as concentrated as an nfw profile ( nfw , ghigna et al .",
    "2000 ) . alternatively , adopting an alternative type of dark matter , such as warm dark matter ( which leads to less concentrated haloes ) may also solve this problem @xcite .",
    "we have compared the properties of local spiral galaxies with model spiral galaxies from the simulations of clbf while taking into account observational selection and striving to construct model and observational quantities in very similar ways . in this fashion",
    ", we have undertaken a detailed exploration of baryonic processes such as gas cooling and the sf law .",
    "model successes include the following :    * model galaxy magnitudes , scale - sizes and gas fractions are in reasonable accord with the data ( although there is a small excess of gas - poor model galaxies ) .",
    "particular successes include a tight gas fraction  surface brightness correlation , and the variation in mean scale - size with luminosity . *",
    "we demonstrate that the seemingly narrow ( @xmath0 ) spiral galaxy scale - size distribution derived from optical data is consistent with the the theoretically - favoured @xmath126 halo spin distribution , when one takes into account variations in stellar populations and dust content . *",
    "the model metallicity ",
    "magnitude relation is consistent with the data , to within the systematic uncertainties . *",
    "the model optical  near - ir colours match trends in the observed dataset well as a function of gas fraction , and to a certain extent scale - size and surface brightness . *",
    "the present - day sfrs of the model galaxies are in reasonable agreement with the data .",
    "we find that it is practically impossible to differentiate between star formation laws that depend on density or on dynamical time based on global present - day sfrs alone .",
    "* fiducial model stellar m / ls are consistent with maximum disc constraints of local spiral galaxies .",
    "substantially higher model stellar m / ls are difficult to obtain using current stellar population synthesis models .",
    "there are some interesting model shortcomings , which offer considerable insight into the models :    * there is a deficit of luminous model spiral galaxies .",
    "furthermore , the model has a ` backwards ' colour  magnitude relation .",
    "an attractive possibility for resolving these discrepancies is the adoption of a gas cooling model that would lead to enhanced ( suppressed ) infall at earlier times for larger ( smaller ) galaxies .",
    "first promising steps have been taken by adopting a superwind model in which some fraction of the gas reheated by feedback is permanently ejected , thus suppressing cooling rates at low redshifts for bright galaxies .",
    "however , the faint galaxies become even redder , owing again to this strong feedback .",
    "another possible solution might be a more accurate treatment of galaxy mergers which might suppress the number of major mergers that lead to the formation of elliptical galaxies . *",
    "the model produces stellar mass - to - light ratios which are similar to the values derived for many galaxies under the `` maximum disc hypothesis . ''",
    "yet , there is a substantial dark matter component within the half - light radius of the model galaxies .",
    "this produces model discs which rotate too fast at a given luminosity , giving rise to the well - known offset between the observed and model tf relations .",
    "possible resolutions of this discrepancy include lowering the model stellar m / ls to substantially sub - maximal values , in concert with a reduction in the mass of baryons that ends up in galaxy discs , or modifying the dark matter halo profiles so that they have less dark matter in the inner parts of the galaxy .",
