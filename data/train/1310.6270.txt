    "we begin by reviewing the geometric formulation of the problem of swimming at low reynolds number developed by shapere and wilczek @xcite . the instantaneous rigid motion ( translation and rotation ) of a swimmer",
    "is determined by the condition that the swimmer not be able to exert a net force or torque on itself , and the condition that the fluid velocity vanishes at infinity .",
    "we should first explain why the problem of swimming at low reynolds number can be formulated in a purely geometric way , independent of the mass of the swimmer or the speed of the swimming stroke ( assuming the speed of the stroke is still small enough so that there is no appreciable momentum transfer to the fluid ) .",
    "recall that the reynolds number , which is associated with a viscous fluid and an object in motion in that fluid , is a ratio of the inertial and viscous forces on that object ( we are not yet considering systems with odd viscosity so in this sentence the word  viscous \" refers to the traditional dissipative ( even ) viscosity of the fluid ) .",
    "if @xmath1 is the even viscosity coefficient , @xmath2 is a typical speed of the fluid flow , @xmath3 is a characteristic dimension of the swimming object , and @xmath4 is the density of the fluid , then the reynolds number can be expressed as =  .",
    "the low reynolds number regime can be interpreted as the regime where the momentum density of the fluid , @xmath5 , is negligible compared to the scale @xmath6 .    at low reynolds number",
    "the drag force on the swimmer is proportional to its velocity .",
    "this means that if the swimmer stops its stroke and just coasts through the fluid , its speed will decay exponentially until it comes to a stop . in the low reynolds number regime",
    "this exponential decay is so fast that the motion of the swimmer at any given time can be considered to be completely independent of what the swimmer was doing at all previous times @xcite .",
    "the motion of the swimmer at time @xmath7 depends only on its shape and the velocity of its surface at time @xmath7 . with these remarks in mind",
    "we can move on to discuss the geometric theory of swimming at low reynolds number .    in two dimensions , for swimmers modeled as the interior of deformed circles",
    ", we can represent the swimming stroke ( the motion of the boundary of the swimmer ) by a time - dependent complex function @xmath8 , @xmath9 , whose real and imaginary parts give the @xmath10 and @xmath11 positions of the point on the swimmer described by the parameter @xmath12 at the time @xmath7 .",
    "when we want to emphasize the dependence of @xmath8 on the real parameter @xmath13 instead of the complex parameter @xmath14 ( as we do in appendix [ sec : areaproof ] ) we call it @xmath15 instead",
    ".    the function @xmath8 lives in a space of  un - located \" shapes , which can be obtained from the space of  located \" shapes by partitioning it into equivalence classes @xmath16 $ ] containing all shapes differing only by a rigid motion .",
    "the location and orientation of the swimmer in real space is specified by a rigid motion @xmath17 acting on a representative of the equivalence class @xmath16 $ ] , the simplest choice being @xmath8 itself : s(,t ) = ( t)s_0(,t )  . to take an example",
    ", @xmath8 might be the representative of @xmath16 $ ] with its centroid at the origin and a distinguishing feature of the shape aligned with the x - axis at time @xmath18 .    to be concrete ,",
    "let us encode the translation and rotation represented by @xmath17 into a @xmath19 matrix and let this matrix act on @xmath8 represented as a three - dimensional vector with third entry equal to one , ( t)s_0(,t ) =    ( ) & ( ) & x + - ( ) & ( ) & y + 0 & 0 & 1    [ s_0(,t ) ] + [ s_0(,t ) ] + 1    , where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the vector and angle representing the translation and rotation effected by @xmath22 . the matrix @xmath17 is determined by integrating the equation = ( t)(t )  , [ eq : diffeq ] where the matrix @xmath23 determines the infinitesimal rigid motion of the swimmer during a time @xmath24 in the sense that @xmath25 _ is _ the rigid motion of the swimmer during the interval @xmath24 .",
    "the matrix @xmath23 is completely determined by the requirements that the net force and torque on the swimmer vanish and that the fluid velocity goes to zero at infinity . to determine the swimming path we need to find @xmath26 for a given swimming stroke and then integrate eq .",
    "[ eq : diffeq ] .    integrating this equation",
    "gives the solution for the rigid motion @xmath17 , ( t ) = ( 0 ) |p  , where @xmath27 denotes a reverse path - ordering operation .",
    "explicitly , we have |p & = & i + _ 0^t ( t ) dt + & + & _ 0^t ( _ 0^t_1 ( t_2)(t_1 ) dt_2 ) dt_1 + & + &  [ poi ] so the matrix @xmath28 with the latest time @xmath29 appears furthest to the right in each integral , which is the reverse of the usual path ordering operation where the latest time goes furthest to the left in each integral .",
    "we show how this integration is carried out numerically in appendix [ app : computation ] .    to see how the idea of a gauge theory of shapes enters we first note that the choice of a representative from the equivalence class @xmath16 $ ] is analogous to a choice of gauge , and the matrix @xmath23 plays the role of a gauge potential . if we choose a different representative @xmath30 , related to @xmath8 by a rigid motion @xmath31 ( we can choose a different representative at each time t ) , _ 0(,t ) = u(t ) s_0(,t )  , then the requirement that the rigid motion of the swimmer in real space remain unchanged leads to the transformation law for @xmath17 ( t ) (t ) = ( t)u^-1(t )  .",
    "the fact that the transformed gauge potential must satisfy the new differential equation = (t)(t ) yields the familiar transformation law ( t ) (t ) = u(t)(t)u^-1(t ) + u(t )  , which shows that @xmath23 does indeed transform like a gauge potential .",
    "we can also represent @xmath23 in the form of a @xmath19 matrix , ( t ) =    0 & & v_x + - & 0 & v_y + 0 & 0 & 0    [ gauge ] where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the instantaneous linear and angular velocity of the swimmer ( so @xmath23 is in the lie algebra of rigid motions ) .",
    "sometimes we will refer to the translational and rotational parts @xmath34 and @xmath35 of the gauge potential , defined by    _ tr & = & v_x + iv_y + _ rot & = &  .",
    "the components of @xmath23 can be completely determined by solving the equations of motion for stokes flow of the viscous fluid surrounding the swimmer , subject to no - slip boundary conditions at the surface of the swimmer .",
    "now that we have reviewed the geometric formulation of swimming we will introduce the concept of the odd / hall viscosity in time - reversal breaking fluids .",
    "we now review the basic definition of odd viscosity and the derivation of the isotropic odd viscosity contribution to the fluid stress tensor in two dimensions . throughout this section",
    "we follow the presentation of ref .   where most of these details were first worked out .",
    "the general linear relation between the fluid stress tensor @xmath36 and the rate of strain tensor @xmath37 ( @xmath38 are the components of the fluid velocity vector @xmath39 ) is of the form t_ij = _ ijkl v_kl  .",
    "the symmetry of the stress and rate of strain tensors imply the symmetry of the viscosity tensor @xmath40 under the exchanges @xmath41 and @xmath42 , but in general @xmath40 can contain terms which are symmetric or anti - symmetric under the exchange of the pair of indices @xmath43 with the pair of indices @xmath44 .",
    "we can always split @xmath40 into parts which are even and odd under such an exchange by writing @xmath45 .    to extract the isotropic contribution to @xmath46",
    "it is convenient to use a simple basis for representing a real , 4th - rank tensor that is symmetric under exchange of its first two and second two indices .",
    "one such basis is provided by the tensor products ^a ^b ,  a , b \\{0,1,3 } of the pauli matrices @xmath47 , @xmath48 and the @xmath49 identity matrix @xmath50 , where we have been careful to only use the symmetric matrices .",
    "we can expand the viscosity tensor as _",
    "ijkl = _ a , b = 0 , 1,3 _ ab ^a_ij^b_kl and then identify the odd part as ^o_ijkl = _ a b ^o_ab ( ^a_ij^b_kl - ^b_ij^a_kl )  .    in two dimensions the generator of spatial rotations is @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the second pauli matrix . in an isotropic fluid the viscosity tensor must commute with @xmath53 to be rotationally invariant . using the familiar commutation and anti - commutation relations for the pauli matrices , and the fact that all matrices commute with the identity @xmath50 , we find that in an isotropic fluid the odd part of the viscosity tensor must have the form ^o_ijkl = ^o ( ^1_ij^3_kl - ^3_ij^1_kl )  , where the single constant @xmath0 is the coefficient of odd viscosity .",
    "finally we can use the explicit expressions    ^1_ij & = & _ i1_j2 + _ i2_j1 + ^3_ij & = & _ i1_j1 - _ i2_j2    for the elements of the pauli matrices @xmath47 and @xmath48 to write down the form of the odd viscosity contribution to the stress tensor t^o_ij & = & ^o_ijklv_kl + & = & - 2^o ( _ i1_j1 - _ i2_j2)v_12 + & + & ^o ( _ i1_j2 + _ i2_j1)(v_11 - v_22 ) which was first obtained in ref . .",
    "for comparison we also display the much more familiar even viscosity part of the stress tensor ( for an incompressible fluid ) t^e_ij = 2^ev_ij  , where @xmath1 is the coefficient of even viscosity .",
    "we see that diagonal elements of @xmath54 are proportional to off - diagonal elements of @xmath55 and off - diagonal elements of @xmath54 are proportional to diagonal elements of @xmath55 .",
    "this atypical relation between the elements of @xmath54 and @xmath55 has a number of non - intuitive consequences .",
    "for example , a circular object rotating in a fluid with odd viscosity will feel a pressure , directed either radially inwards or outwards depending on the sense of the rotation ( see @xcite and fig .",
    "[ fig : droplet ] ) .",
    "this is quite different from what would happen in a fluid with even viscosity only , where a rotating circle would feel a torque that opposes the rotation .",
    "the fact that the direction of the pressure force ( radially inwards or outwards ) on a circle rotating in an odd viscosity fluid depends on the sense of the rotation means that time - reversal symmetry is broken in systems with odd viscosity .",
    "in classical fluids with both even and odd viscosity avron has shown ( see @xcite ) that the equations of motion for incompressible stokes flow ( viscous force - dominated flow ) are    ( p - ^o ) & = & ^e ^2 + & = & 0  ,    where @xmath56 is the pressure , @xmath57 is the vorticity , and @xmath1 and @xmath0 are the coefficients of even and odd viscosity , respectively . if @xmath58 , taking the curl of the first equation shows that the vorticity is a harmonic function , i.e. , @xmath59 .",
    "this means that the stream function @xmath60 ( which can be used here because the flow is incompressible ) , defined by @xmath61 , is a biharmonic function , ^2(^2 ) = 0  . in two dimensions we can package the velocity vector @xmath62 into a complex variable @xmath63",
    "the solution for @xmath64 can then be expressed in the complex form ( see @xcite ) v = _",
    "1(z ) - z + [ velocity ] where @xmath65 , the bar denotes complex conjugation and @xmath66 .",
    "the functions @xmath67 and @xmath68 are analytic functions ( away from the point @xmath69 , which lies inside the swimmer ) with the laurent series expansions    _ 1(z ) & = & _ k<0a_k z^k+1 + _",
    "2(z ) & = & _ k<-1b_k z^k+1  .    to solve for the coefficients @xmath70 and @xmath71",
    "we impose no - slip boundary conditions at the surface of the swimmer .",
    "solving for these coefficients can be very difficult for general swimming strokes , so we will focus our attention on a class of simple swimmers introduced in ref .",
    "whose shapes are conformal maps of the circle of degree @xmath72 . in appendix",
    "[ app : degree3 ] we extend our results to swimmers that are conformal maps of the circle of degree @xmath73 .    to calculate the force and torque on the swimmer",
    "we will need the stress tensor .",
    "we have seen in section [ sec : oddvisc ] that in the presence of odd viscosity the stress tensor gets an extra contribution .",
    "the full stress tensor is now t_ij & = & -p_ij + 2^ev_ij - 2^o ( _ i1_j1 - _",

    "since the fluid is incompressible , an application of the divergence theorem shows that the force and torque on the surface of the swimmer are the same as the force and torque on the fluid at infinity . using this equivalence , the components of the force on the swimmer are f_i & = & _ r_0 ^ 2 ( t_ijr_j ) r dand the torque on the swimmer is n = _",

    "here we present some simple examples of swimming strokes that clearly demonstrate the difference between swimming in a fluid with just even viscosity and swimming in a fluid with both even and odd viscosity .",

    "the motion for different values of the odd viscosity can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : ellipse ] .      to further test our results",

    "this swimming parameterization represents a conformal map of degree @xmath102 to see how to extend the analysis of the previous section to swimmers which are conformal maps of the circle of degree @xmath73 ( i.e. how to include @xmath103 terms ) , see appendix [ app : degree3 ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig : dwave ] we see very similar results to the dipolar case , e.g. , the motion of the swimmer is just a rotation proportional to the growth of the area .",
    "this indicates , as we expected from the general result of appendix [ sec : areaproof ] , that the odd viscosity does not distinguish between different types of shape distortions , and only couples to changes in the total area of the interior of the swimmer .",
    "the third example is a swimmer parameterized with the cyclic stroke    [ wandering ] _ 0 & = & r_0 + _ -2 & = & -i_1 ( 2 t ) + _ -3 & = & -i_2 ( 2 t )    where @xmath104 , @xmath105 and @xmath106 are all real parameters .",
    "we chose this particular stroke because in the case when only the even viscosity is present , the swimmer s centroid moves in a straight line through the fluid .",
    "additionally , this stroke has a periodic time - dependent area a(t ) =  , which implies that it will feel a cyclic stress from the odd viscosity term when present . in fig .",

    "we show that the amplitude of the transverse oscillation at a fixed time increases linearly with the slope @xmath109 as the swimmer continues it will wander further and further off of the straight - line course although on average it seems like it will still progress linearly at a similar rate to that of the swimmer in the fluid with vanishing odd viscosity .",
    "the fourth example is a stroke which will nominally rotate when just even viscosity is present , but for which the variation of the area of the shape has been chosen carefully so that when odd viscosity is also present the shape will not rotate at all . in other words ,",

    "now any choice of the periodic functions @xmath114 will give a cyclic swimming stroke that will not rotate in a fluid with our chosen ratio @xmath119 .",
    "this shows in principle that it is possible to construct a stroke for which the even and odd viscosity contributions to the angular velocity exactly cancel each other .",
    "swimmers using this type of stroke might be able to more efficiently navigate odd - viscosity fluids since the particular choice of stroke cancels the rotation effects due to the odd - viscosity .",
    "we have applied the geometric theory of swimming at low reynolds number developed by wilczek and shapere  @xcite to the case where the fluid has a non - vanishing hall , or odd , viscosity .",
    "the main effect of the hall viscosity is to introduce an additional torque on the swimmer , proportional to the rate of change of the area of the swimmer , independent of the other shape changes occurring in the stroke pattern .",
    "this torque is the companion effect to the fact that a swimmer rotating in a fluid with odd viscosity feels an inwards or outwards pressure proportional to its angular velocity  @xcite .",
    "as we show in appendix [ sec : areaproof ] this conclusion applies to generic swimming shapes and is not limited to swimmers whose boundaries are simple conformal maps of the unit circle .    as a consequence of this extra torque , a swimming stroke which would not cause the swimmer to rotate in a fluid with conventional viscosity can cause the swimmer to rotate in a fluid with hall viscosity if the area of the swimmer is changing .",
    "it is even possible to design a stroke which will rotate the swimmer in an even viscosity fluid but not in a fluid with both even and odd viscosity , for a certain value of the ratio @xmath96 .",
    "it is possible that swimmers placed in fluids with an odd viscosity would have to adapt their strokes to efficiently move in a straight line .",
    "additionally , it would be interesting to see if swimmers could use the interplay between the even and odd viscosity to perform more interesting or efficient motion patterns .",
    "we acknowledge useful discussions with j. e. avron and p. zhang .",

    "we are thankful for the support of the institute for condensed matter theory at uiuc .",
    "to calculate the matrix @xmath17 , which gives the rigid motion of the swimmer after a finite time @xmath7 , we need to evaluate the reverse path - ordered integral . in practice",
    "we do this by slicing time into many small steps ( say n steps ) of size @xmath120",
    ". we can write |pe^_0^t ( t ) dt = |pe^_i=1^n _ ( i-1)t^it ( t ) dt  .",
    "if the time steps are small enough then we can approximate this as |pe^_i=1^n _",
    "( i-1)t^it ( t ) dt _ i=1^n |pe^_(i-1)t^it ( t ) dt  , where on the right side we now have a product of reverse path - ordered integrals over many small time intervals of size @xmath120 and we should put the earliest times on the right so that we are applying the rigid motions in these small intervals in chronological order .",
    "since these time intervals are very small we can make a further approximation by expanding the path - ordered integral over the time interval @xmath120 to first order and neglecting the higher order terms to find : |pe^_(i-1)t^it ( t ) dt i + _ ( i-1)t^it ( t ) dt  .",
    "finally we can make one further approximation for the integral of the matrix @xmath23 over the small time interval @xmath120 , _",
    "t_i-1^t_i ( t ) dt ( t_i-1)t where @xmath121 ( and @xmath122 ) .",
    "our final expression for the approximation of the full path - ordered integral is then |pe^_0^t ( t ) dt _ i=1^n ( i + ( t_i-1)t )  , where again the matrices for the earliest times must to be to the right so that the rigid motions are applied in the proper order .",
    "we have also tried expanding the reverse path - ordered integrals over the time interval @xmath120 to second order , but it seems that this makes almost no visible correction to the swimming trajectory when the swimming deformations are not too large and the step size @xmath120 is small .",
    "our analysis of the simple swimmer suggests a deeper connection between the area of the swimmer and the odd viscosity contribution to the torque on the swimmer . to explore this connection",
    "further we now show that eq",
    ". holds for any swimmer whose boundary is a smooth curve without self - intersections .",
    "the boundary of the swimmer is just a smooth curve parameterized by @xmath123 which also depends on the time @xmath7 .",
    "if we write the shape in terms of real components s_0(,t ) = x(,t ) + iy(,t ) and plug into the area formula we find a(t ) = _ 0 ^ 2 d  , where the prime denotes a derivative with respect to @xmath123 .",
    "next take a time derivative to get & = & _ 0 ^ 2 d  .",
    "we can integrate by parts on the terms with mixed partial derivatives and use the fact that the boundary terms vanish since @xmath124 , @xmath125 , @xmath126 and @xmath127 are @xmath128-periodic in @xmath13 to get = _ 0 ^ 2 d  . because of the no - slip boundary conditions the vector @xmath129 is just the fluid velocity @xmath130 evaluated on the surface of the swimmer , ( ) | _ = ( , t ) + ( , t )  .",
    "then we can write = _",
    "ds = ( )  , where @xmath131 is a vector normal to the surface of the swimmer with magnitude @xmath132 .",
    "this integral is just the flux of the fluid at the surface of the swimmer . by the divergence theorem we have ( ) - ( )",
    "= _  dxdy and since the fluid is incompressible , @xmath133 , we get = ( )  . a comparison with eq . for the flux of the fluid at",
    "infinity yields the final result [ b_-2 ] =  , proving that this relation is valid for general swimming shapes in incompressible fluids .",
    "it is known that an object which rotates in a fluid with odd viscosity will feel a pressure directed radially inwards or outwards depending on the direction of the rotation @xcite .",
    "the relation is the companion to this statement .",
    "it says that an object which tries to expand or contract in a fluid with odd viscosity will feel a torque whose direction ( @xmath134 ) depends on whether the area of the object is growing or shrinking .",
    "a swimmer whose boundary is a degree 3 ( @xmath73 ) conformal map of the circle has the form s_0(,t)= _ 0(t)+ _ -2(t)^-1 + _ -3(t)^-2 + _ -4 ^ -3  , with area a(t)= ( |_0|^2 - |_-2|^2 - 2|_-3|^2 - 3|_-4|^2 )  .    to solve for @xmath135 and @xmath136 we need the coefficients @xmath137 and @xmath138 .",
    "equations for these coefficients can be obtained by plugging into the pulled - back velocity expansion .",
    "we find that      the equation for @xmath139 is really just a matrix equation for a two - component vector consisting of the real and imaginary parts of @xmath139 .",
    "the solution is a_-2^ * =  . in terms of this coefficient",
    "we find that a_-1 = -(|_0)^-1(|a_-2^*_-3 + 2_-3_-4 ) and b_-2 & = & |_0_0 - |_-2_-2 - 2_-3_-3 + & - & 3_-4_-4 + |_-2a_-2^ * - _ -2|a_-2^ *  .",
    "note that the last two terms in @xmath80 are complex conjugates of each other and appear with the opposite sign so that they will cancel when we take the real part of @xmath80 .",
    "this means that the relation @xmath94 = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\frac{da(t)}{dt}$ ] still holds in this case , as we expect based on the general arguments presented in appendix [ sec : areaproof ] .    to solve for the new form of the angular velocity necessary to cancel the torque on the swimmer",
