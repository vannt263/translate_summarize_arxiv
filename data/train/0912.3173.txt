    "let us now concentrate on the case a ) , i.e. the one where the chiral limit mass function is large .",
    "from now on , we shall consider only renormalised quantities , in the @xmath9 scheme , and skip any subindex meant to recall the renormalisation  : we quote only the subtraction point .",
    "let us first recall the puzzle underlined in @xcite , where one studies the results of lattice data by the qcdsf group at @xmath10 .",
    "if we consider the ope with tree level coefficient for the condensate , we have in the chiral limit the politzer formula quoted above @xcite  : @xmath11 note the remarkable fact that the expansion begins with the power correction .",
    "the purely perturbative contribution vanishes in the chiral limit , since it is proportional @xmath12 .",
    "we observe immediately an * enormous discrepancy * between both sides at the momenta usually considered  ; indeed , with the estimate of @xmath13gev@xmath14 ^ 3=-(1.9 \\pm 0.35)10^{-2}~$]gev@xmath15 from the mass of the pion and gmor formula with overlap fermions ( @xcite ) , or @xmath16 gev@xmath15 from clover fermions , as given above @xcite , see eq .",
    "( [ gmor - lubicz ] )  ; taking @xmath17 ( at one loop , with @xmath18 ) , we find a r.h.s . around @xmath19 ,",
    "much smaller , by a factor 4 , than the value we find from the lattice result for the l.h.s .  :",
    "@xmath20gev .note that there is an habit to present condensates through cubic roots , which hides the discrepancies .",
    "we want to avoid it .",
    "le us recall that @xmath21 .",
    "note also that , in the initial paper @xcite , the discrepancy was found still larger , around 10 .",
    "the reason is twofold  : first we adopted as reference the standard qcd sum rule value of the condensate , @xmath22  , which is twice smaller ; second , the lattice value of @xmath23 that we estimated was larger , as explained in the beginning of section [ discontinuity ] , because we could do only a linear extrapolation .",
    "nevertheless , the discrepancy remains huge .",
    "working at higher momentum would not help much in this respect  : using the @xmath24 lattice , we have momenta up to more than @xmath25 , but nevertheless the discrepancy is not much smaller  : the prediction at tree level , with @xmath26 @xmath27 , against @xmath28 according to our lattice measurements , therefore there is a factor about three of discrepancy . note that here we choose to calculate @xmath29 at one loop for simplicity in this first discussion . to be more quantitative",
    ", it seems that we should adopt the best possible approximation for @xmath30 , i.e. including @xmath31 . .",
    "at @xmath32 , the resulting values of @xmath30 are sizeably smaller , which reinforces the problem .",
    "we can include , as done already in @xcite , the one - loop correction to the coefficient , which has been calculated a long time before by pascual and de rafael @xcite  ; we set in their formula @xmath33 for the lorentz gauge , @xmath34 , and for the renormalisation point , @xmath35 in their notation  ; we also take their @xmath36 as minus the euclidean @xmath36 of the lattice  ; whence  : @xmath37 we can in addition make a fit on the whole range of our data .",
    "we take into account the evolution of the condensate from @xmath38 down to the reference point @xmath39 where we want to determine the condensate , by using the formula for the evolution of the @xmath9 quark mass , which is just the inverse of the one for @xmath40  : @xmath41 to the corresponding order .",
    "we have checked this formula by calculating it from both the expressions in @xcite and @xcite respectively .",
    "it coincides exactly with the one given in @xcite .    in the common range of momenta at @xmath10 and @xmath24 , @xmath42 , cf fig .",
    "[ mp - chir-6.0 - 6.4-ir ] , we find a good superposition of the lattice curves for @xmath23 at @xmath43 and @xmath44 , and a very consistent fit where the  condensate \" at @xmath39 in @xmath9 scheme would have the fitted value @xmath45 at @xmath10 , @xmath46 at @xmath47 , therefore around 3 or 3.5 times the actual value .",
    "this is still clearly unacceptable .",
    "the situation is only slightly better if we use larger momenta , available only with the @xmath43 lattices  ; in this case , using the full range of momenta , we get @xmath48 . term and with a different treatment of discretisation effects , the condensate in @xcite remains sizeably larger than required  : @xmath49  ; without the @xmath50 term , it rises to a still larger value , larger by a factor @xmath51 , whence @xmath52 , i.e. a factor 2 of discrepancy . ]    obviously , the discrepancy is so huge that we have to find a non trivial explanation .",
    "we can think at once of two types of explanation of the discrepancy , preserving the ope  : -either the above condensate value , taken from the pion mass , has something basically wrong  ; it is hard to believe  ; note also that many successful considerations have been based on roughly this value , and one would have to reconsider a whole sector of particle physics  ; -or it is the perturbative expansion of the coefficient which is strongly modified by higher orders , or even , which is simply not valid , at least at available momenta . in @xcite , the second explanation is suggested , i.e. it was suggested that the perturbative expansion may merely break down at available lattice momenta , since already the one - loop correction is found as large as @xmath53 of the tree level at @xmath39 .",
    "it could mean that either there is merely no sort of convergence or that the ope is practically useless .",
    "equivalently , it could mean that we have to reach very high momenta for the known , low order , perturbative expansion to be valid .",
    "however , since the decrease of @xmath30 is very slow , we would require prohibitively large momenta to test the idea on the lattice .",
    "fortunately , an impressive progress has been performed in the calculation incorporating the higher order terms recently computed by k. chetyrkin and a. maier gives ( cf eq .",
    "( [ ordre4 ] ) in the appendix )  :    @xmath54    we write @xmath55 because there is in addition a correction of the same formal order from the quark self - energy , @xmath56 , beginning at two loops , which is found to be very small(@xmath57 ) .",
    "the positive and steadily increasing coefficients are much larger than in the purely perturbative series for the propagator(see for instance eq . [ sigma ] ) .",
    "it do much in convincing one that the perturbative expansion of the wilson coefficient is not well behaved . for @xmath58 one",
    "gets  :    @xmath59    on one hand , it shows that the series is meaningless at @xmath39 . and",
    "it implies that claims to recover the value of the condensate from data around @xmath60 with only the low orders can not be justified . on the other hand",
    ", it suggests that the discrepancy we have observed at lower orders between the fitted and the real value of @xmath61 could be explained by the strength of high order radiative corrections .",
    "working at higher @xmath38 would presumably not suffice , even assuming some convergence of the series . with @xmath62 , the behaviour of the series",
    "is substantially improved  : @xmath63 and , as can be seen on figure ( [ p2mp ] ) the inclusion of the higher terms results in reducing the gap between the lattice data and the ope estimation by a factor of 2 .",
    "but is it is unable to reconcile them .",
    "equivalently , the fit gives a fictitious value for the condensate of @xmath64 gev@xmath15 , twice too large .",
    "to summarize , not even on our @xmath65 lattice , where momenta run up to more than @xmath25 , can we apply safely ope . in the case of @xmath66 @xcite , we could use the @xmath67 lattices , which provide momenta up to @xmath68 , to study the @xmath7 condensate ; this is not possible for the quark condensate in the present case , because of the collapsing to zero of the quark mass function at those small volumes .",
    "what is encouraging is that the terms of the series are all positive , and , if this behaviour persists , it makes understandable that the real curve lies above the ope contribution presently calculated .",
    "-0.5 cm      of course , one should consider the possibility that there remain discretisation artefacts .",
    "we feel that in spite of the good superposition of @xmath44 and @xmath43 , there is some * positive * @xmath69 invariant artefact ( e.g. @xmath70 ) , but presumably much too small to explain the discrepancy",
    ". signals of a small artefact ( see figure [ p2mp ] are 1 ) @xmath44 and @xmath43 differ somewhat around the endpoint of @xmath44 , @xmath71gev ( see fig .",
    "[ p2mp ] )  ; 2 ) the central curve of the @xmath43 points seems too flat beyond @xmath72gev , although our errors are too large to ascertain this statement . about point 2 )  : the theoretical perturbative curve is falling more and more rapidly with increasing order , as seen in figure.[p2fitp_6.4_uv ] .",
    "one may then expect the exact continuum curve to fall still more rapidly . and",
    "not to be flat .",
    "the flatness of the lattice data could be explained by a positive artefact of the type @xmath73 or @xmath74 , corresponding to an artefact @xmath75 or @xmath76 .",
    "the magnitude of this artefact is however strongly limited by the region around @xmath71gev , where both @xmath77 points are present and give close central values of @xmath78 ( difference is around @xmath79 gev@xmath15 against a total magnitude of @xmath78 @xmath80gev@xmath15 at @xmath71gev,@xmath81gev@xmath15 at @xmath82gev ) but of course it would be better to have smaller errors to strengthen this conclusion . ) are very small at large @xmath38 , but the extraction of the residue increases them much . ]",
    "0.5 cm    -0.5 cm",
    "the method of circumventing the wilson term artefact which affects the clover propagator quark mass function , by passing through the pseudoscalar vertex , seems efficient , and yields a result no too far from the continuum .    .",
    "the present study give useful indications for the extraction of ope power corrections , at least for elementary green functions .",
    "in the regime of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking , the quark mass function is in principle an exceptionally favorable case for the study of the ope power corrections , since    \\1 ) the @xmath83 quark condensate contribution is the leading order in the chiral limit ,    \\2 ) the value of the condensate is well known by other methods .",
    "in fact , it is the best place for a lattice , nonperturbative , measurement of a wilson coefficient . in practice ,",
    "the present study strengthens the previous conclusion that an accurate ope analysis is a very difficult task .",
    "the present case illustrates one of the difficulties , which will also appear in other cases according to the calculations of chetyrkin and maier  : the perturbative series giving the wilson coefficient of the power term converges at best very slowly  ; it is difficult to work at sufficiently large momenta to have it converge better . in the present work , at the largest momenta ,",
    "even with the huge improvement provided by the recent work of chetyrkin and maier ( three loops ) , a discrepancy of a factor 2 seems to remain with the actual value of the condensate  ; we find a fictitious @xmath84 gev@xmath15 .",
    "equivalently , one can say that , practically , the ope even with the very high orders calculated can work only at very high @xmath38 .",
    "effects of similar magnitudes are found by chetyrkin and maier in several other cases , concerning the @xmath85 vacuum condensate contribution to propagators .",
    "the situation about the ope of composite operators is not known .",
    "this causes a difficulty for the program of renormalisation through the lattice measurement of mom renormalisation constants .",
    "this is especially true if we require a high precision of order of the  percent \" , as often considered .",
    "indeed , let us recall that the final aim of the method is to extract from the measured renormalisation constants * their purely perturbative * part .",
    "of course , in principle , we could work at a very large @xmath38 to kill completely the power corrections , and at a sufficiently large cutoff , in order that this large @xmath38 should not be affected by appreciable uv artefacts .",
    "however , from our findings , power corrections due to @xmath7 can be guaranteed to be @xmath57 only around @xmath86 gev .",
    "then the task would be obviously very difficult .",
    "the alternative method is to perform ope fits at available momenta .",
    "such fits must include first the known purely perturbative part , multiplied by the unknown @xmath87 , second the power corrections , which are predicted to be important at usual momenta , but also , as a third contribution , discretisation terms invariant under @xmath69 , which should be important as well at this degree of accuracy , and whose magnitude is unknown .",
    "the method is then to exploit the different behaviour of the various types of terms , as function of both @xmath38 and @xmath88 .",
    "this method of extraction of @xmath87 is then also difficult , when the form of the discretisation artefacts ( as we have shown for the vector part of the propagator ) as well as the functional form of the wilson coefficient , which depends on high orders , are not known accurately .",
    "moreover , we have not an independent knowledge of the @xmath85 condensate value in contrast to the quark condensate .",
    "let us stress that the difficulty of ope is presently manifest only in elementary , non gauge invariant , green functions , but these are precisely the ones used for mom normalisation conditions .    .",
    "on the other hand , the study has revealed the unexpected and remarkable feature , that there is a general discontinuity of chiral properties , as obtained by the standard chiral extrapolation methods  : when the physical volume passes through some critical value , chiral symmetry seems to be restored abruptly although we do not expect a real phase transition .",
    "the discontinuity affects simultaneously the quark mass function , the pion mass and the chiral condensate .",
    "since the critical volume coincides with the one found for the phase transition to symmetry restoration advocated since several years by neuberger and narayanan at @xmath89 , we are tempted to establish a connection with it  : it could be a remnant of this at @xmath90 .",
    "we stress the fact that this property is revealed only through a polynomial extrapolation from non negligible quark masses of @xmath91 or more ( bare masses ) .    as a by - product",
    ", our calculations suggest that the rather direct method of calculating the condensate through the chiral extrapolation of @xmath92 is efficient . for our larger lattice ,",
    "the results is very encouraging , considering the simplicity of the method  : @xmath93 .",
    "we thank very much k. chetyrkin and a. maier to have communicated us the results of their calculation before publication , and for useful comments .",
    "we thank also very much damir becirevic for communicating us their plot at @xmath94 , and for many useful discussions on the subject since a very long time  ; and benot blossier for many useful suggestions and constant discussions .",
    "we thank c. urbach for having informed us of their own work .",
    "from the calculations of chetyrkin and maier ( @xcite @xcite ) , we extract the following result at @xmath32 for euclidean @xmath38  : @xmath95(1+\\sigma(p ) ) <",
    "\\bar \\psi \\psi>(p ) \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath30 being taken at @xmath38 .",
    "it is easily seen that the first order is as given by politzer , and the second one as given by pascual and de rafael .",
    "we have obtained these numbers by the following manipulations .",
    "the authors consider the renormalised ope of the quark propagator renormalised in the @xmath9 scheme , and write the contribution of the quark condensate as @xmath96 .",
    "they find for the scalar part and vector part of the renormalised propagator @xmath97  : @xmath98 where dots denote @xmath99 orders in @xmath100 or power corrections with power larger than @xmath83 , or terms suppressed by @xmath99 powers of @xmath101 . in @xmath102 , the tree order term @xmath101 is kept in a first step to indicate the conventions of the authors .",
    "we note that @xmath23 as we calculate from the ratio of bare quantities is also the ratio of the renormalised quantities in any scheme , since the factor @xmath103 applies to both terms of the fraction .",
    "then , at @xmath104 ,  : @xmath105 where @xmath56 is the @xmath106 quark self - energy .",
    "now , we pass to the euclidean space by setting @xmath107 , or making the substitution @xmath108 . then @xmath109 being read as @xmath110 , where @xmath111 represents the radiative corrections and is a polynomial in @xmath30 , one ends on  : @xmath112 @xmath111 and @xmath61 being negative , @xmath113 as observed on the lattice .",
    "finally , we set @xmath35 .",
    "then @xmath56 is found to give a very small correction .",
    "we borrow the expression from chetyrkin and retey  : @xcite  : @xmath114 or numerically  : @xmath115 this is @xmath116 for @xmath117 ( @xmath118 )      a general method for nonperturbative renormalization of lattice operators",
