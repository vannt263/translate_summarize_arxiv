    "<S> multisimultaneity is a causal model of relativistic quantum physics which assigns a real time ordering to any set of events , much in the spirit of the pilot - wave picture . </S>",
    "<S> contrary to standard quantum mechanics , it predicts a disappearance of the correlations in a bell - type experiment when both analysers are in relative motion such that , each one in its own inertial reference frame , is first to select the output of the photons . </S>",
    "<S> we tested this prediction using acousto - optic modulators as moving beam - splitters and interferometers separated by 55 m. we did nt observe any disappearance of the correlations , thus refuting multisimultaneity .    </S>",
    "<S> many experiments have demonstrated quantum correlations between spatially separated measurements , under several conditions @xcite , in perfect concordance with quantum mechanical predictions . </S>",
    "<S> the most striking feature of quantum correlations being the violation of bell s inequalities @xcite .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we confront quantum correlations with a natural alternative model , called multisimultaneity @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> first , we summarize multisimultaneity , stressing its close relation to the famous pilot - wave model of de broglie and bohm @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> next , we oppose the predictions of quantum mechanics and of multisimultaneity in the situation where two entangled particles are analyzed by two beam - splitters moving apart in such a way that each beam - splitter in its own inertial reference frame analyses his particle before the other . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that multisimultaneity is the natural application of the pilot - wave intuition to this configuration . </S>",
    "<S> we stress that it has the nice feature that it can be tested using available technology . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we present an experimental test based on 2-photon interferences .    within newtonian physics , where time is absolute , it is possible to describe quantum correlations at a distance in a causal  </S>",
    "<S> mechanistic  </S>",
    "<S> way @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a first class of examples assume that the collapse of the state vector is a real physical phenomenon@xcite : the first measurement produces a collapse and the second measurement happens on a system in the collapsed state .    </S>",
    "<S> another explicit example , closer in spirit to the subject of this letter , is provided by the pilot - wave model of de broglie and bohm . </S>",
    "<S> there , the particle and the wave always co - exist , the wave guiding the particle and the particle triggering the detectors . </S>",
    "<S> the two slit experiment is then not more difficult to understand than the evolution of a cork floating in a river : if an island separates the river in two arm over a certain length , then the cork passes on one ( and only one ) side of the island , but its subsequent evolution is also affected by the water that passes around the other side . when this model is applied to two entangled particles , </S>",
    "<S> the model is less intuitive ( the  wave flows  in configuration space ) , but it still provides a clear mechanistic description of how quantum correlations built up : the measurement on one side modifies the  wave  which in turn guides the distant particle ( the model is local in configuration space , but nonlocal in real space ) . </S>",
    "<S> this model reproduces all quantum predictions . </S>",
    "<S> if furthermore one assumes that a privileges reference frame ( e.g. defined by the cosmic micro - wave background radiation ) determines the time ordering , then this model is self - consistent . </S>",
    "<S> however , </S>",
    "<S> when time is relative , as in special relativity , it is ambiguous . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , it is then no longer defined which measurement modifies the wave first and which particle is then guided .    </S>",
    "<S> multisimultaneity is an attempt to set the pilot - wave intuition in a relativistic context . for this , </S>",
    "<S> one of the author of this letter , a. suarez , together with v. scarani , proposed a model in which a causal temporal order is defined for each measurement@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the basic idea is that the relevant reference frame for each measurement is the inertial frame of the massive apparatus . </S>",
    "<S> more specifically , multisimultaneity assumes that the relevant frame is determined by the analyzer s inertial frame ( e.g. a polarizer or a beam - splitter in our case ) . paraphrasing bohr </S>",
    "<S> , one could say that the relevant frame , hence the relevant time ordering , depends on the very condition of the experiment @xcite . in multisimultaneity , as in the pilot - wave model , </S>",
    "<S> each particle emerging from a beam - splitter follows one ( and only one ) outgoing mode , hence particles are always localized , although the guiding wave ( i.e. the usual quantum state @xmath0 ) follows all path , in accordance with the usual schrdinger equation . </S>",
    "<S> when all beam - splitters in an experiment are at relative rest , this model reduces to the pilot - wave model and has thus precisely the same prediction as quantum mechanics . </S>",
    "<S> however , when two beam - splitters move apart , then there are several ( i.e. two ) relevant reference frames , each defining a time ordering , hence the name of multisimultaneity . </S>",
    "<S> in such a configuration it is possible to arrange the experiment in such a way that each of the two beam - splitter in its own reference frame analyses a particle from an entangled pair before the other . in the pilot - wave picture </S>",
    "<S> , each particle has then to  decide  where to go before its twin particle makes its choice ( even before the twin is forced to make a choice ) . </S>",
    "<S> multisimultaneity predicts that in such a _ before - before _ </S>",
    "<S> configuration , the correlations disappear , contrary to the quantum prediction .    </S>",
    "<S> let us emphasize that the model of multisimultaneity , although conceptually quite foreign both to quantum mechanics and to relativity , is not in contradiction with any existing experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , it has the nice feature that it can be tested using existing technology . in order to realize a configuration with moving beam splitters </S>",
    "<S> , we proposed to use traveling acoustic waves as beam splitter @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> energy - time entanglement can be demonstrated by 2-photon interference experiments@xcite . in this experiment ( figure 1 ) we use the franson configuration @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> each photon from an energy - time entangled photon pair source is sent to an analyzer . </S>",
    "<S> each one consists in an unbalanced interferometer , the difference between the long and short arms being much longer than the coherence length of a single photon . </S>",
    "<S> the coincidence events when both photons take the short arms or both the long ones are indistinguishable because the emission time is undetermined , due to the long coherence time of the pump laser . </S>",
    "<S> if we select only those events , the coincidence rate between the 2 outputs is proportional to @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the visibility and @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the phase differences between the long and the short arms in interferometers 1 and 2 , respectively . in an ideal case </S>",
    "<S> the visibility is @xmath5 , but experimentally it is always lower due , e.g. , to detector noise and to partial distinguishability of the interfering paths . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , it can be larger than 71% , that is larger than the maximal visibility compatible with any theory based only on local variable , as demonstrated by bell s theorem @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we use a recently developed ppln waveguide source of energy - time entangled photons@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it features very high efficiency , so we can register interferences in reasonable measuring times . </S>",
    "<S> violation of bell inequality has already been demonstrated with this source @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the beam - splitters have to be in motion , to achieve the desired relativistic configuration . </S>",
    "<S> therefore we built two unbalanced bulk michelson interferometers using aom ( acousto - optic modulator , brimrose amf-100 - 1.3 - 2 mm ) as beamsplitters . </S>",
    "<S> indeed it would have been very difficult to put real beamsplitters in motion at sufficiently high speed , but an aom can be seen as a realization of such a moving beamsplitter . </S>",
    "<S> let us take a look on the internal mechanism of the aom : the traveling acoustic wave inside the material changes the refractive index , thus creating a diffraction grating . </S>",
    "<S> the reflection coefficient is maximal at bragg angle @xmath6 : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the sound wavelength , @xmath9 is the light wavelength in vacuum and @xmath10 the refractive index of the material . </S>",
    "<S> the reflection coefficient is given by @xmath11 @xcite , where @xmath12 is the acoustic power and @xmath13 depends of the aom size and material , and of the light wavelength . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the acoustic power was set , such that the beamsplitting ratio is 50/50 . </S>",
    "<S> the aom ends by a skew cut termination , thus the wave is damped rather than reflected , hence the wave is effectively traveling rather than stationary . </S>",
    "<S> a point which gives us confidence in using aom @xcite is that the reflection on a moving mirror produces a frequency change of the light , due to the doppler effect , given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the mirror velocity and @xmath16 the angle between the incident light and the plane of reflection . within an aom </S>",
    "<S> the reflected light is also frequency shifted and the frequency shift is equal to the acoustic wave frequency ( 100 mhz in our case ) : @xmath17 using @xmath18 for the sound wave and equations ( [ bragg ] ) and ( [ shift ] ) we found that the frequency shift induced by the aom is the same as the one induced by a mechanical grating traveling at speed @xmath19 .    </S>",
    "<S> the frequency shift induced by the aoms on the reflected beam ( 200 mhz because it passes twice through the modulator ) forces us to use an  aom in each interferometers , otherwise the total energy of both photons would not be the same for the short - short and the long - long paths , leading to distinguishability between the 2 paths . </S>",
    "<S> therefore both interferometers are build such that the shifts compensate , and the total energy remains the same . </S>",
    "<S> moreover both frequencies have to be exactly identical to avoid beatings . </S>",
    "<S> this requires to synchronize the frequency of both aom rf drivers @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> because of the small deviation angle ( about 5@xmath20 ) we collect only the light coming out from the input port by using an fiber optical circulator ( see figure 1 ) . as the deviation angle depends of the light wavelength , an aom act as a band - pass filter for the reflected beam with an bandwidth of about 30 nm . </S>",
    "<S> therefore we have to insure that the bandwidth of the photons is smaller by placing a spectral filter after the source . </S>",
    "<S> the transmission through each interferometer is about 25% .    </S>",
    "<S> when the phase @xmath21 is changed by slightly moving back and forth one of the mirrors with a piezo - electric actuator , we observe 2-photon interference fringes with a visibility of about 85% after substraction of the accidental coincidences ( figure 2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the relatively low value for the visibility is probably due to beatings originating from a small difference in the electric spectrums of the rf signals driving the two aoms .    in order to test multisimultaneity , both interferometers have to be far away , and both photons have to reach the moving beamsplitters at the same time . </S>",
    "<S> the criterion given by special relativity for the change in time ordering of two events in two reference frames counterpropagating at speed @xmath22 is @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25  are respectively the time difference and distance between the two events in the laboratory frame @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this criterion is much more stringent than the spacelike separation condition @xmath26 . due to the high speed of the acoustic wave ( 2500 m / s , specified by the manufacturer or computed from the mechanical properties of amtir ( amorphous material transmitting ir ) @xcite ) , </S>",
    "<S> a distance of 55 m between the interferometers is enough , and allows us to realize the experiment inside our building . </S>",
    "<S> the permitted discrepancy on the time of arrival of the photons in the aom is then , according to ( [ dt ] ) , @xmath27 ps , corresponding to a distance of @xmath28 mm in air . the fiber path length can me measured with a precision of 0.1 mm using a low coherence interferometry method . </S>",
    "<S> the error on the interferometers path lengths is measured manually with a precision smaller than 0.5 mm . to be sure that we have set the lengths </S>",
    "<S> as required we scan the path length difference by pulling on a 1 m long fiber . </S>",
    "<S> the scan steps are of 0.12 mm . </S>",
    "<S> simultaneously we keep scanning the phase to observe interferences .    </S>",
    "<S> it is not sufficient to precisely equalize the path lengths , we also have to insure that the coherence length of the photons is smaller than the permitted discrepancy . </S>",
    "<S> this is the case because , with the interference filter placed after the photon pair source , the photons coherence length is about 0.14 mm . </S>",
    "<S> another effect to take into account is the chromatic dispersion in the fibres . </S>",
    "<S> this will spread the photon wave packet . </S>",
    "<S> however , thanks to the energy correlation , the dispersion can be almost canceled . </S>",
    "<S> the requirement for the 2-photon dispersion cancelation @xcite is that the center frequency of the 2 photon is equal to the zero dispersion frequency of the fibers . </S>",
    "<S> we measured this value on a 2 km fiber with a commercial apparatus ( eg&g ) which uses the phase shift method . </S>",
    "<S> we found a value of @xmath29 nm for @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> then we used 100 m of the same fiber assuming that the dispersion is equally distributed . </S>",
    "<S> we set the laser wavelength at half this value . </S>",
    "<S> the pulse spreading over 100 m , if we conservatively assume a 1 nm difference between the laser wavelength and @xmath30 , is 0.2 ps @xcite  corresponding to a length of 0.06 mm in air , which is much smaller than the permitted discrepancy .    </S>",
    "<S> according to the multisimultaneity model , the correlations should disappear on a range of about 2 - 3 scanning steps . </S>",
    "<S> we scanned the path difference over a range of @xmath313 mm ( figure 3 ) , around the equilibrium point . </S>",
    "<S> hence the time order of the events passes from a before - after situation , where there is a defined time ordering in all reference frames to the ambiguous before - before condition and then back to an after - before situation . </S>",
    "<S> however several scans like the one presented in figure 2 show no effects on the visibility . a similar measure with both acoustic waves traveling against each other ( _ after - after _ condition @xcite ) </S>",
    "<S> does nt show any change of the correlations either . </S>",
    "<S> we can add that given the distance and the incertitude on the time of arrival , we can fix a lower bound of the speed in the laboratory frame of any hypothetical quantum influence to be @xmath32 .    every day correlations are correlations between events ; either the events have a common cause or one event has a direct influence on the other(s ) . </S>",
    "<S> that is , ordinary correlations is a secondary concept , built upon the primary concept of event : the cause of ordinary correlations can be reduced to the cause of the events . </S>",
    "<S> the violation of bell s inequality rules out the common cause explanation , and correlations between space - like separated events exclude influences propagating slower than the speed of light .    </S>",
    "<S> multisimultaneity is an alternative model to standard quantum mechanics in which several reference frames , determined by the local physical devices and apparatuses , each define a time - ordered causality with faster than light influences [ the influences being not under human control , they ca nt be used for signaling ] . in all situations where the different components of the measuring apparatuses are at relative rest , multisimultaneity has the same prediction as quantum mechanics . </S>",
    "<S> however , in the intriguing situation where entangled particles are analyses by two beam - splitters in relative motion such that each one analyses  his  particle before the other , multisimultaneity predicts that the quantum correlations disappear . </S>",
    "<S> since in the reported experiment the correlations did not disappear , multisimultaneity is refuted .    </S>",
    "<S> this refutation stresses the oddness of quantum correlations . </S>",
    "<S> not only are they independent of the distance , but also it seems impossible to cast them in any real time ordering . recall that a model assuming that the detectors determine the relevant frames has already been refuted @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> hence one ca nt maintain any causal explanation in which an earlier event influences a later one by arbitrarily fast communication . in this sense , quantum correlations </S>",
    "<S> is a basic ( i.e. primary ) concept , not a secondary concept reducible to that of causality between events : quantum correlations are directly caused by the quantum state in such a way that one event can not be considered the `` cause '' and the other the `` effect '' . </S>"
