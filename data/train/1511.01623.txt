    "scalar mesons are progressively gaining attention for their important roles in low - energy qcd . they induce spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking and therefore probe the qcd vacuum , and also they appear as intermediate states in goldstone boson interactions away from threshold ( such as in @xmath4 , @xmath0 and @xmath5 scatterings ) in a range of energy that is too low for a perturbative qcd study and too high in the context of chiral perturbation theory .",
    "moreover , the scalar mesons have connections to important issues in qcd such as violation of isospin , diquarks and glueballs . a general discussion of the experimental situation on light scalars is given in ref",

    "the lowest - lying scalars ( below 1 gev ) have a mass spectrum that is much lighter than expected and is also inverted .",
    "this immediately rules out a naive simple quark - antiquark substructure for these states ; a picture that is known to work reasonably well for other spins such as vectors and pseudoscalars . a fundamental framework for understanding the lowest - lying scalars",
    "was first proposed by jaffe in mit bag model @xcite , in which a four - quark ( i.e. two quarks and two antiquarks ) substructure is considered .",
    "this picture provides an explanation for the light and inverted mass spectrum of the scalars below 1 gev .",
    "scalars above 1 gev are expected to be closer to quark - antiquark states , but they too have some peculiar properties that make their identification with pure quark - antiquark states rather questionable . then it is natural to wonder whether the complexities of the scalars below and above 1 gev have some underlying connections and whether a global study of these states that includes possible underlying mixings can be useful .",
    "this global treatment defines the philosophy of the framework developed in @xcite ( and references therein ) upon which the present work is built .    in the global study of ref .",
    "@xcite , a generalized linear sigma model which is formulated in terms of two scalar nonets and two pseudoscalar nonets ( a two- and a four - quark nonet ) and the underlying mixings among the scalars and among pseudoscalars is studied .",
    "it is shown that a simple picture for scalar states below 2 gev seems to emerge which automatically leads to light scalars that are dominantly of two quark - two antiquark nature and light conventional pseudoscalars that are , as expected from established phenomenology , dominantly of quark - antiquark nature .",
    "the free parameters of the leading order of the model are completely determined by fitting to various low - energy data . after these parameters are determined several predictions of the model",
    "are studied in follow up works , including the prediction of @xmath4 scattering amplitude in @xcite which , after unitarizing the amplitude using the k - matrix method , gives a reasonable agreement with data up to around 1 gev . in the work of @xcite , the poles of the k - matrix unitarized amplitude are determined and used to calculate the physical masses and decay widths of the isosinglet scalar mesons .",

    "the main advantages of k - matrix are the fact that it enforces exact unitarity , and that it does not introduce any additional parameters , and as such , acts as a useful mapping of the model predictions to the appropriate experimental data .",

    "<S> the underlying mixing of quark components of scalar mesons is probed in @xmath0 scattering within a generalized linear sigma model that contains two scalar meson nonets and two pseudoscalar meson nonets ( a quark - antiquark and a four - quark ) . in the leading order of this model , </S>",
    "<S> all free parameters have been previously fixed using the mass spectra and several low - energy parameters known from experiment and consistent predictions have been made . </S>",
    "<S> as other predictions of the model , in the present work the isospins @xmath1= 1/2 , 3/2 and @xmath2=0 projection of @xmath0 scattering amplitude ( as well as phase shifts ) are computed and compared with experiment . in the @xmath1=1/2 channel , it is shown that within the uncertainties of the model parameters a good agreement with experimental data up to an energy of about 1 gev is obtained , whereas in the @xmath1=3/2 channel there is a better agreement with experiment which extends to about 1.4 gev . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of final state interactions of @xmath0 in the @xmath1=1/2 channel is approximated by the k - matrix method and the poles of the unitarized scattering amplitude are found . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the model predicts a light and broad kappa resonance with a mass and decay width of 670 - 770 mev and 640 - 750 mev consistent with other prior works . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the scattering lengths in the @xmath1=1/2 , 3/2 are also computed and shown to qualitatively agree with experiment . the overall predictions presented here further support previous findings that the scalar mesons below and above 1 gev have substantial underlying mixings and that those below 1 gev have dominant four - quark substructures while those above 1 gev are closer to conventional @xmath3-wave quark - antiquark states </S>"
