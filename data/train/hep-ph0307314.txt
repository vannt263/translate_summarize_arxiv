    "the energetic , highly polarized photons can be produced at a high rate in the compton process as a result of the backscattering of bright laser - photons on high - energy electrons .",
    "this is a basic concept of the photon collider ( compton collider ) - called also a photon linear collider ( plc ) @xcite .",
    "such collider is considered as an option to be realized in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 modes at all discussed future @xmath2 liner colliders ( lc ) : tesla , nlc , jlc and clic @xcite .",
    "the potential of photon collider is very rich , in some cases even spectacular @xcite .",
    "first of all , plc seems to be the most suitable place to observe a scalar ( higgs ) sector .",
    "especially useful should be a @xmath0 mode , where the c=+ resonances , like higgs boson(s ) , can be produced , and determination of their basic properties can be performed with a high accuracy . such a mode allows for a precision measurement of the fundamental effective ( loop- ) coupling @xmath3 , which involves contributions from all fundamental , massive charged particles , with masses originating from the higgs mechanism .",
    "in general , such contributions do not decouple and therefore this effective coupling is sensitive to heavy particles , even if their masses are in a range well beyond a reach of the existing and even the next generation experiments .",
    "plc with highly polarized photon - beams offers excellent opportunity for testing of new interactions , including cp - violating one , in the scalar sector .",
    "it should discover heavy spin - zero particles , e.g. higgs bosons from extended models , supersymmetric particles , etc ... , in the mass range not accessible at other experiments .",
    "this is due to the fact that at plc such particles can be produced singly , in contrast to a @xmath2 lc , where they are produced in pairs or with other heavy particles .",
    "the @xmath4 mode allows to measure another effective ( loop- ) coupling , namely @xmath5 .",
    "this mode is of particular importance for studies of the anomalous @xmath6- interactions in a process @xmath7 , and for an investigation of the slepton sector .",
    "the plc , both in the @xmath0 and @xmath4 modes , is a perfect place to study qcd , in particular @xmath8-quark interaction and a hadronic `` structure '' of the real photon .",
    "the realistic simulations of the basic processes for various designs of the photon collider are being performed currently , allowing for a reliable comparison with similar simulations done for the main @xmath2 option and for the hadron colliders .",
    "there are specific aspects of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 colliders , absent at @xmath2 colliders , which arise mainly from the facts that the photon - beams have a wide spread of energy and a varying with energy degree of polarization .",
    "also , a large hadronic background is expected at a photon collider , as photon may ( with a probability @xmath9 ) behave like a hadron ( vector meson dominance idea ) . to deal with all these issues",
    "the dedicated `` tools '' are needed .",
    "the photon - photon and photon - electron physics working group has a mission to investigate a physics potential of a photon collider .",
    "there is a large activity in this working group - more than 15 talks were presented during this workshop , most of them in the joint sessions with other working groups like higgs , susy , ew and qcd .",
    "a special panel discussion was organized to discuss a need of a photon collider .",
    "the maximum energy of the back - scattered photons produced in the compton scattering , to be used as a beam for plc , is equal to @xmath10 , where @xmath11 .",
    "this energy may reach up to 80 % of the energy of the initial electrons @xmath12 ( for @xmath13 gev and laser energy @xmath14 1.17 ev ( @xmath15 ) and @xmath164.5 @xcite ) . for larger @xmath17 ,",
    "the energy spectrum for the photon - beam is more monochromatic , being peaked at a high energy .",
    "however , if @xmath17 becomes too large ( in the above example larger than 4.8 ) then the @xmath2 pairs can be created in the collision of the back - scattered photons with the laser photons .",
    "this process leads to decrease of the luminosity of the photon collider . for @xmath18",
    "the maximum cms energy of the @xmath0 collision is equal to 80 % of the energy for the @xmath2 collision and it reaches 90 % for the @xmath1 case . if lower energy of photon collider is needed , one can use the same laser and decrease electron energy keeping all beam parameters as for higher energy ( a bypass solution ) , then the luminosity for @xmath0 collider is proportional to @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "one considers also a technique with a tripled laser frequency ( nlc / jlc ) @xcite .",
    "this way even at smaller electron beam - energy @xmath12 @xmath17 remains large and a resulting energy spectrum for the back - scattered photons is peaked @xcite .",
    "the photon collider can be realized using only @xmath19 beams . a dedicated interaction point , with a finite crossing angle to avoid background from the disrupted beams ,",
    "is foreseen at all lc colliders .",
    "if electron bunches are tilted with respect to the direction of the beam motion ( `` crab''-crossing scheme ) , the luminosity is the same as for the head - on collisions .",
    "luminosities of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 colliders are of the order of 10 % of the @xmath20 geometric luminosity , which can be larger than the corresponding luminosity for a @xmath2 collider @xcite .",
    "the shape ( monochromaticity ) of the energy - spectrum and the degree of polarization of the back - scattered photons depend crucially on the ( product of ) polarization of the initial electrons and laser photons .",
    "the 80 % polarization for the parent electrons ( i.e. twice the electron helicity < @xmath21 > equal to @xmath22 ) is feasible at lc while a circular polarization of the laser photons , @xmath23 , can be close to @xmath24 . when @xmath25 one obtains a highly monochromatic and highly polarized photon - beam .",
    "it has a characteristic high - energy peak in the energy spectrum for @xmath26 larger than 0.8 @xmath27 , and its circular polarization reaches up to 100 % for the photon energy close to @xmath28 ( the average polarization is equal to 90 - 95 % for a high - energy part ) .",
    "also , a linear polarization of the photon - beams can be obtained by using a linearly polarised laser - light .",
    "the maximum degree of a linear polarization of the back - scattered photon , < @xmath29 > , is obtained at its maximum energy , unfortunately this maximum degree is higher for a lower @xmath17 ( up to 63.3 % for @xmath161.8 and only 33.4 % at @xmath164.8 @xcite . ) .",
    "if both photon - beams are obtained from parent particles with @xmath25 , then the luminosity spectra for the @xmath0 collision has a high - energy peak ( for @xmath30 larger that @xmath31 ) , with a width at half maximum of about 15 % and the integrated luminosity about 1/3 of the luminosity for @xmath2 collider @xcite , e.g. for tesla 84 @xmath32 . in the considered case",
    "both photon - beams have a high degree of circular polarization , < @xmath33>,<@xmath34 > @xmath35 , with @xmath36 , hence < @xmath37 > is close to 1 .",
    "this means a domination of a state with a projection of the total angular momentum on the @xmath38-axis , @xmath39 , equal to 0 .    by flipping the helicities and polarization of the parent electrons and laser photons for one or both photon - beams",
    ", one can easily optimize the photon collider to work either as a factory or a discovery machine .",
    "in particular , to produce in a @xmath0 mode a particle with a definite mass @xmath40 , one rather chooses a factory design , i.e. with the monochromatic spectra ( @xmath25 , possibly large @xmath17 ) , to tune a maximum of @xmath41 to the mass @xmath40 ( however first an energy of the @xmath42 collision has to be adjusted : @xmath43/0.8 ) .",
    "a high rate for the spin - zero state is an extra benefit of this option . on other hand ,",
    "a maximum degree of linear polarization of the photon - beam , transferred from a linearly polarised laser - photons , is high enough to select in an effective way states with a definite cp - quantum number , i.e. cp - even or cp - odd states , depending whether the polarization - vectors of colliding photons are parallel or perpendicular . to discover new particles , a discovery design of plc with the broad energy spectra of photon - beams ( e.g. with @xmath44 ) will be more useful .",
    "the realistic spectra for the photon - beam , which include the higher order qed processes , differ significantly from an ideal ( the lowest - order ) compton form .",
    "the programmes generating the realistic luminosity spectra for the @xmath0 and @xmath1 colliders exist for all machines ( cain and phocol with circe and an analytic compaz parametrization @xcite ) .",

    "model - independent analysis of the effects due to higgs bosons without definite cp - parity was performed using the interference among higgs particles , as well with a background , for fixed top - quark helicities .",
    "photon beams are assumed to be polarized ( both circular and linear polarization is needed ) and @xmath8 and @xmath109 helicities are fixed and equal . the extension of a new analysis reported in @xcite to the cp - violating case is in under way .",
    "also in @xcite a model - independent analyses was done for the same channel .",
    "it was observed that the angular distribution of the decay lepton from @xmath117 is independent of any cp violation in the @xmath118 vertex and hence directly related to a cp mixing in the higgs sector . in the analysis the combined asymmetries in the initial state ( parent ) electron ( hence also photon - beam ) polarization and the final - state lepton - charge have been applied .",
    "if cp - violation is observed , then all the asymmetries , both for circular and linear polarizations , should be used to determine the form factors describing the @xmath115 and @xmath116 vertices .",
    "this method allows to discriminate models , e.g. sm and mssm , see fig .",
    "[ fig8](right ) , where in a plane of the cp - even and cp - odd observables ( @xmath119 and @xmath120 ) the blind regions for the sm and the mssm are shown .    in the cp - violating susy ,",
    "the spin - zero top squarks contribute only to the cp - even part of the @xmath121 coupling , while charginos can contribute to the cp - odd as well as the cp - even parts @xcite , leading to a cp - violation .",
    "it was demonstrated in @xcite , that the measurement of the lightest higgs boson , produced in the collision of the linearly - polarized photon - beams , allows to confirm the existence of the cp - violating chargino contributions to the @xmath3 coupling even in the decoupling regime of mssm .",
    "results were obtained in a specific cp - violating scenario , in agreement with existing constraints .",
    "the obtained predictions depend strongly on the cp - violating phase @xmath122 both for a ratio of cross section to the sm presented in figs .",
    "[ fig9](left ) , and for the polarization asymmetry @xmath123 , see figs .",
