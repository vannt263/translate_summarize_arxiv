    "how and when did the first sources of light form in the universe ? within the framework of modern cosmology , we have learned that the first stars and quasars formed at the end of the so - called `` dark ages '' , a few @xmath4  yr after the big bang ( e.g. , barkana & loeb 2001 ; miralda - escud 2003 ) .",
    "the cosmic dark ages began @xmath5  500,000  yr after the big bang when the photons of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) were emitted . at this time , the cmb photons redshifted into the infrared wavelength band so that they were no longer energetic enough to ionize hydrogen atoms , and could henceforth propagate freely . from the viewpoint of a human observer , the universe descended into a state of complete darkness , that lasted until the cosmic renaissance of first light occurred much later on .    at these early times",
    ", the universe did not yet contain any gravitationally bound structures , and its state was simple enough to allow a description in terms of precise , linear physics ( e.g. , hu & dodelson 2002 ) . we know from observations of the highest redshift quasars and galaxies that the dark ages must have ended prior to @xmath6 ( e.g. , hu et al .",
    "2002 ; fan et al .",
    "2003 ) . whereas we can directly probe the state of the universe at @xmath7 , by measuring cmb anisotropies , and at @xmath8 , by observing quasar absorption lines and lyman-@xmath9 emission from galaxies , we know little about the formative epoch in between .",
    "thus , this era is the final frontier of observational cosmology , and the crucial question is ( e.g. , barkana & loeb 2001 ; loeb & barkana 2001 ; miralda - escud 2003 ) : _ how and when did the dark ages end ? _    within the now firmly established model of cosmological structure formation ( e.g. , spergel et al .",
    "2003 ) , the first stars are predicted to have formed at redshifts @xmath0 in dark matter ( dm ) halos of total mass @xmath10 ( e.g. , couchman & rees 1986 ; ostriker & gnedin 1996 ; tegmark et al .",
    "1997 ; abel et al . 1998 ; yoshida et al .",
    "numerical simulations of the collapse and fragmentation of metal - free gas , assumed to contain no dynamically significant magnetic fields yet , have indicated that the first stars , the so - called population  iii ( e.g. , bond 1981 ) , were predominantly very massive , with @xmath11 ( e.g. , bromm , coppi , & larson 1999 , 2002 ; abel , bryan , & norman 2000 , 2002 ; nakamura & umemura 2001 ) .",
    "many uncertainties , however , remain .",
    "two key problems are : ( i ) the physics of accretion from a dust - free envelope , which determines the final stellar mass , is not yet well understood ( e.g. , omukai & palla 2001 , 2003 ; tan & mckee 2003 ) .",
    "( ii ) a complete theory of primordial star formation would allow us to predict the exact functional form of the population  iii initial mass function ( imf ) .",
    "again , a reliable determination is still eluding us ( see , e.g. , nakamura & umemura 2001 , 2002 ; omukai & yoshii 2003 for first attempts ) .",
    "i will address both issues in  3 .",
    "the first quasars , on the other hand , powered by accretion onto supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) , are expected to have formed later on , at @xmath2 , in more massive , dwarf - sized systems ( e.g. , haiman & loeb 2001 ; bromm & loeb 2003a ) .",
    "numerical simulations of high - redshift smbh formation indicate that these could have formed only _",
    "after _ a significant episode of previous star formation ( e.g. , bromm & loeb 2003a ; di matteo et al .",
    "2003 ) . the long - standing question ( e.g. , silk & rees 1998 ) of what came first , stars or quasars , would then be answered in favor of the former .",
    "the formation of the first luminous sources had important implications for the evolution of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) .",
    "massive population  iii stars were efficient producers of ionizing photons ( e.g. , tumlinson & shull 2000 ; bromm , kudritzki , & loeb 2001b ; schaerer 2002 , 2003 ; tumlinson , shull , & venkatesan 2003 ) . the contribution from these stars , thus , could have been important in reionizing the igm early on , at @xmath12 , as may be required by the recent _ wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) _ data ( kogut et al . 2003 ; spergel et al .",
    "2003 ) on the optical depth to thomson scattering ( e.g. , cen 2003a , b ; ciardi , ferrara , & white 2003 ; haiman & holder 2003 ; holder et al . 2003",

    "once the igm has been metal - enriched above a minimum level , star formation is predicted to shift from a predominantly high - mass ( population  iii ) to a lower - mass ( population  ii ) mode ( e.g. , omukai 2000 ; bromm et al .",
    "2001a ; bromm & loeb 2003b ; schneider et al .",

    "2002 ) , measurements of the near ir cosmic background radiation ( e.g. , santos , bromm , & kamionkowski 2002 ; salvaterra & ferrara 2003 ) , and the prospect of detecting high - redshift gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) with the _ swift _ satellite to be launched in 2004 ( e.g. , lamb & reichart 2000 ; bromm & loeb 2002 ) .    in this review",
    ", i will briefly summarize the current state of key aspects in this rapidly evolving field ( see bromm & larson 2004 for a more detailed discussion ) .",
    "the establishment of the current standard @xmath13cdm model for cosmological structure formation has provided a firm framework for the study of the first stars ( spergel et al .",
    "2003 ) . within variants of the cdm model , where larger structures are assembled hierarchically through successive mergers of smaller building - blocks , the first stars are predicted to form in dm minihalos of typical mass @xmath14 at redshifts @xmath15 ( e.g. , couchman & rees 1986 ) .",
    "the virial temperatures in these low - mass halos , @xmath16 ( barkana & loeb 2001 ) , are below the threshold , @xmath17  k , for efficient cooling due to atomic hydrogen ( e.g. , oh & haiman 2002 ) .",
    "it was realized early on that cooling in the low - temperature primordial gas had to rely on molecular hydrogen instead ( saslaw & zipoy 1967 ; peebles & dicke 1968 ) .    since the thermodynamic behavior of the primordial gas",
    "thus is primarily controlled by h@xmath18 cooling , it is crucial to understand the non - equilibrium chemistry of h@xmath18 formation and destruction ( e.g. , lepp & shull 1984 ; anninos & norman 1996 ; abel et al .",
    "1997 ; galli & palla 1998 ; puy & signore 1999 ) . in the absence of dust grains to facilitate their formation ( e.g. , hirashita & ferrara 2002 ) , molecules have to form in the gas phase .",
    "the most important formation channel is given by the sequence : h + @xmath19 h@xmath20 , followed by h@xmath21 h @xmath22 h@xmath23 ( mcdowell 1961 ) .",
    "the free electrons act as catalysts , and are present as residue from the epoch of recombination ( seager , sasselov , & scott 2000 ) , or result from collisional ionization in accretion shocks during the hierarchical build - up of galaxies ( e.g. , mac low & shull 1986 ; shapiro & kang 1987 ) .",
    "the formation of hydrogen molecules thus ceases when the free electrons have recombined .",
    "calculations of h@xmath18 formation in collapsing top - hat overdensities , idealizing the virialization of dark matter halos in cdm cosmogonies , have found a simple approximate relationship between the asymptotic h@xmath18 abundance and virial temperature in the overdensity ( or halo ) : @xmath24 ( tegmark et al .",
    "1997 ) .    applying the familiar criterion ( rees & ostriker 1977 ; silk 1977 ) for the formation of galaxies that the cooling timescale has to be shorter than the dynamical timescale , @xmath25",
    ", one can derive the minimum halo mass at a given redshift inside of which the gas is able to cool and eventually form stars ( e.g. , tegmark et al . 1997 ) .",
    "the h@xmath18 cooling function has been quite uncertain over the relevant temperature regime , but recent advances in the quantum - mechanical computation of the collisional excitation process ( h atoms colliding with h@xmath18 molecules ) have provided a much more reliable determination ( see galli & palla 1998 , and references therein ) . combining the cdm prescription for the assembly of virialized dm halos with the h@xmath18 driven thermal evolution of the primordial gas , a minimum halo mass of @xmath14",
    "is required for collapse redshifts @xmath26 . from detailed calculations",
    ", one finds that the gas in such a ` successful ' halo has reached a molecule fraction in excess of @xmath27 ( e.g. , haiman , thoul , & loeb 1996 ; tegmark et al .",
    "1997 ; yoshida et al .",
    "these systems correspond to @xmath28 peaks in the gaussian random field of primordial density fluctuations . in principle , dm halos that are sufficiently massive to harbor cold , dense gas clouds could form at higher redshifts , @xmath29 .",
    "such systems , however , would correspond to extremely rare , high-@xmath30 peaks in the gaussian density field ( e.g. , miralda - escud 2003 ) .",
    "to more realistically assess the formation of cold and dense star forming clouds in the earliest stages of cosmological structure formation , three - dimensional simulations of the combined evolution of the dm and gas are required within a cosmological set - up ( e.g. , ostriker & gnedin 1996 ; gnedin & ostriker 1997 ; abel et al .",
    "these studies confirmed the important role of h@xmath18 cooling in low - mass halos at high @xmath31 .",
    "recently , the problem of forming primordial gas clouds within a fully cosmological context has been revisited with high numerical resolution ( yoshida et al . 2003a , b , c ) .",
    "the resulting gas density field is shown in figure  1 for a standard @xmath13cdm cosmology at @xmath32 .",
    "the bright knots at the intersections of the filamentary network are the star forming clouds , having individual masses ( dm and gas ) of @xmath14 .",
    "whether a given dm halo successfully hosts a cold , dense ( @xmath33,@xmath34@xmath35 ) gas cloud can nicely be understood with the rees - ostriker criterion , as can be seen in figure  2 .",

    "( 2003a ) derive a minimum collapse mass of @xmath36 , with only a weak dependence on collapse redshift ( see also haiman et al . 1996 ; fuller & couchman 2000 ; machacek , bryan , & abel 2001 ) . the dynamical heating accompanying the merging of dm halos has an important effect on the thermal and chemical evolution of the gas .",
    "clouds do not successfully cool if they experience too rapid a growth in mass .",
    "the primordial gas clouds that are found in the cosmological simulations are the sites where the first stars form .",
    "it is , therefore , important to learn what properties these clouds have in terms of overall size , shape , and angular momentum content .",
    "the latter is often expressed by the familiar spin - parameter @xmath37 , where @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 are the total angular momentum , energy , and mass , respectively .",
    "the spin parameter is a measure of the degree of rotational support , such that the ratio of centrifugal to gravitational acceleration is given by @xmath41 at virialization .",
    "the spin values measured in pure dm cosmological simulations can be described by a lognormal distribution function with a mean value of @xmath42 , similar to what is found for larger - scale systems ( jang - condell & hernquist 2001 ) .",
    "the overall sizes of the population  iii star forming clouds are close to the virial radius of the host dm halo , with @xmath43  pc , not too different from the typical dimensions of present - day giant molecular clouds ( e.g. , larson 2003 ) .",
    "depending on the degree of spin , the clouds have shapes with various degree of flattening ( e.g. , bromm et al .",
    "2002 ; yoshida et al .",
    "due to the importance of pressure forces , however , overall cloud shapes tend to be rather spherical .",
    "to fully elucidate the properties of the star - forming primordial clouds , even higher resolution cosmological simulations will be necessary .",
    "the theoretical predictions for the formation sites of the first stars sensitively depend on the exact nature of the dm component and its fluctuation spectrum .",
    "recently , two models have been discussed that would much reduce the fluctuation power on small mass scales .",
    "the first of these , the warm dark matter ( wdm ) model ( e.g. , bode , ostriker , & turok 2001 ) , has been proposed to remedy the well - known problems of standard @xmath13cdm on sub - galactic scales ( e.g. , flores & primack 1994 ; moore et al .",
    "these concern the predicted large abundance of substructure or , equivalently , of satellite systems , and the high ( cuspy ) densities in the centers of galaxies .",
    "both predictions are in conflict with observations . the second model , the ` running ' spectral index ( rsi ) model , is suggested by the combined analysis of the _ wmap _ data , the 2df galaxy redshift survey , and lyman-@xmath9 forest observations ( spergel et al . 2003 ; peiris et al .",
    "a series of recent studies have worked out the consequences of these reduced small - scale power models on early star formation ( somerville , bullock , & livio 2003 ; yoshida et al .",
    "2003b , c ) . within these models , the star formation rate at @xmath12",
    "is significantly reduced compared to the standard @xmath13cdm case .",
    "this is due to the absence of low - mass halos and their associated gas clouds that are cooled by molecular hydrogen .",
    "such a reduced rate of early star formation makes it difficult to achieve the large optical depth to thomson scattering , as measured by _ wmap _",
    ", with reasonable choices for the star formation efficiency in the first galaxies .",
    "the metal - rich chemistry , magnetohydrodynamics , and radiative transfer involved in present - day star formation are complex , and we still lack a comprehensive theoretical framework that predicts the imf from first principles .",
    "star formation in the high redshift universe , on the other hand , poses a theoretically more tractable problem due to a number of simplifying features , such as : ( i ) the initial absence of heavy elements and therefore of dust ; ( ii ) the absence of dynamically - significant primordial magnetic fields ; and ( iii ) the absence of any effects from previous episodes of star formation which would completely alter the conditions for subsequent generations of stars .",
    "the cooling of the primordial gas depends only on hydrogen in its atomic and molecular form .",
    "whereas in the present - day interstellar medium ( ism ) the initial state of the star forming cloud is poorly constrained , the corresponding initial conditions for primordial star formation are simple , given by the popular @xmath13cdm model of cosmological structure formation .",
    "how did the first stars form ?",
    "this subject has a long and venerable history ( e.g. , schwarzschild & spitzer 1953 ; yoneyama 1972 ; hutchins 1976 ; silk 1977 , 1983 ; yoshii & sabano 1979 ; carlberg 1981 ; kashlinsky & rees 1983 ; palla , salpeter , & stahler 1983 ; yoshii & saio 1986 ) . in this review ,",
    "i focus mainly on the more recent work since the renewed interest in high - redshift star formation beginning in the mid-1990s ( e.g. , haiman et al .",
    "1996 ; uehara et al . 1996 ; haiman & loeb 1997 ; tegmark et al .",
    "1997 ; larson 1998 ) .",
    "the complete answer to this question would entail a theoretical prediction for the population  iii imf , which is rather challenging .",
    "a more tractable task is to estimate the characteristic mass scale , @xmath44 , of the first stars , and most of the recent numerical work has focused on this simpler problem .",
    "the characteristic mass is the mass below which the imf flattens or begins to decline ( see larson 1998 for examples of possible analytic forms ) .",
    "this mass scale is observed to be @xmath45 in the present - day universe .",
    "since the detailed shape of the primordial imf is highly uncertain , it is reasonable to first constrain @xmath44 , as this mass scale indicates the typical outcome of the primordial star formation process or , in other words , where most of the available mass ends up ( e.g. , clarke & bromm 2003 ) .    to fully explore the dynamical , thermal , and chemical properties of primordial gas , three - dimensional numerical simulations",
    "are needed , although more idealized investigations in two , one , or even zero dimension are important in that they allow to probe a larger parameter space .",
    "the proper initial conditions for primordial star formation are given by the underlying model of cosmological structure formation ( see   2 ) .",
    "it is , therefore , necessary to simulate both the dm and gaseous ( ` baryonic ' ) components . to date , two different numerical approaches have been used to simulate the general three - dimensional fragmentation problem in its cosmological context .",
    "the first series of simulations used the grid - based adaptive mesh - refinement ( amr ) technique ( abel et al .",
    "2000 , 2002 ; abn henceforth ) , and the second one employed the smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) method ( bromm et al . 1999 , 2002 ; bcl henceforth ) .",
    "the sph approach has the important advantage that it can easily accommodate the creation of sink particles ( e.g. , bate , bonnell , & bromm 2003 ) .",
    "recently , the dynamical range of the standard sph method has been significantly improved by implementing a ` particle splitting ' technique ( kitsionas & whitworth 2002 ; bromm & loeb 2003a ) .",
    "when the simulation reaches such high density in a certain region that a sink particle would normally be created , a complementary strategy is now adopted : every sph particle in the unrefined , high - density region acts as a parent particle and spawns a given number of child particles , and endows them with its properties . in effect , this is the sph equivalent of the grid - based amr technique .",
    "the most important difference between these two studies lies in the way the initial conditions are implemented .",
    "the abn simulations start at @xmath46 with a periodic volume of physical size @xmath47  kpc .",
    "the amr technique allows abn to bridge the gap from cosmological to protostellar scales .",
    "the bcl effort , on the other hand , initializes the simulations , also at @xmath46 , by realizing spherical overdensities that correspond to high-@xmath30 peaks in the gaussian random field of cosmological density fluctuations .    in comparing the simulations of abn and bcl , the most important aspect is that both studies , employing very different methods , agree on the existence of a preferred state for the primordial gas , corresponding to characteristic values of temperature and density , @xmath48  k , and @xmath49 @xmath35 , respectively .",
    "these characteristic scales turn out to be rather robust in the sense that they are not very sensitive to variations in the initial conditions . in figure  3 ( panel c ) , this preferred state in the @xmath50 phase diagram can clearly be discerned .",
    "this figure , from the simulations of bcl , plots the respective gas properties for each individual sph particle .",
    "the diagram thus contains an additional dimension of information : where evolutionary timescales are short , only few particles are plotted , whereas they tend to accumulate where the overall evolution is slow .",
    "such a ` loitering ' state is reached at @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "these characteristic scales can be understood by considering the microphysics of h@xmath53 , the main coolant in metal - free , star forming gas ( abel et al . 2002 ; bromm et al . 2002 ) . at temperatures @xmath54  k ,",
    "cooling is due to the collisional excitation and subsequent radiative decay of rotational transitions .",
    "the two lowest - lying rotational energy levels in h@xmath53 have an energy spacing of @xmath55 .",
    "collisions with particles ( mostly h atoms ) that populate the high - energy tail of the maxwell - boltzmann velocity distribution can lead to somewhat lower temperatures , but h@xmath53 cooling can not proceed to @xmath56  k. this explains the characteristic temperature . the characteristic density , in turn ,",
    "is given by the critical density above which collisional de - excitations , which do not cool the gas , compete with radiative decays , which lead to cooling .",
    "this saturation of the h@xmath53 cooling marks the transition from nlte rotational level populations to thermal ( lte ) ones . at densities below @xmath52 ,",
    "the cooling rate is proportional to the density squared , whereas at higher densities , the dependence is only linear .",
    "once the characteristic state is reached , the evolution towards higher density is temporarily halted due to the now inefficient cooling , and the gas undergoes a phase of quasi - hydrostatic , slow contraction . to move away from this ` loitering ' regime , enough mass has to accumulate to trigger a gravitational runaway collapse .",
    "this condition is simply @xmath57 , where the jeans mass or , almost equivalently , the bonnor - ebert mass can be written as ( e.g. , clarke & bromm 2003 ) @xmath58 primordial star formation , where magnetic fields and turbulence are expected to initially play no important dynamical role , may be the best case for the application of the classical jeans criterion which is describing the balance between gravity and the opposing _ thermal _ pressure .",
    "a prestellar clump of mass @xmath59 is the immediate progenitor of a single star or , in case of further subfragmentation , a binary or small multiple system . in galactic star - forming regions , like @xmath60  ophiuchi ,",
    "such clumps with masses close to stellar values have been observed as gravitationally bound clouds which lack the emission from embedded stellar sources ( e.g. , motte , andr , & neri 1998 ) .",
    "the high - density clumps are clearly not stars yet . to probe the further fate of a clump , one first has to follow the collapse to higher densities up to the formation of an optically thick hydrostatic core in its center ( see   3.2 ) , and subsequently the accretion from the diffuse envelope onto the central core ( see   3.3 ) .",
    "the parent clump mass , however , already sets an upper limit for the final stellar mass whose precise value is determined by the accretion process .",
    "although abn and bcl agree on the magnitude of the characteristic fragmentation scale , abn have argued that only one star forms per halo , while bcl have simulated cases where multiple clumps form , such that the number of stars in a minihalo is @xmath61 . among the cases studied by bcl favoring @xmath62 , are high - spin runs that lead to disk - like configurations which subsequently fragment into a number of clumps , or more massive halos ( with total mass @xmath63 ) .",
    "notice that the case simulated by abn corresponds to a gas mass of @xmath64 .",
    "such a low - mass halo is only marginally able to cool , and when bcl simulated a system with this mass , they also found that only a single star forms inside the halo .",
    "further work is required to elucidate whether the multiple - clump formation in bcl does also occur in simulations with realistic cosmological initial conditions .",
    "a possible clustered nature of forming population  iii stars would have important consequences for the transport of angular momentum .",
    "in fact , a crucial question is how the primordial gas can so efficiently shed its angular momentum on the way to forming massive clumps . in the case of a clustered formation process",
    ", angular momentum could be efficiently transported outward by gravitational ( tidal ) torques .",
    "tidal torques can then transfer much of the angular momentum from the gas around each forming clump to the orbital motion of the system , similar to the case of present - day star formation in a clustered environment ( e.g. , larson 2002 ; bate et al .",
    "2003 ) . in the isolated formation process of abn , however , such a mechanism is not available . alternatively , abn have suggested the efficient transport of angular momentum via hydrodynamic shocks during turbulent collapse .",
    "again , more work is required to convincingly sort out the angular momentum transport issue .",
    "important contributions have also been made by more idealized , two- to zero - dimensional , studies .",
    "these investigations typically ignore the dark matter component , thus implicitly assuming that the gas has already dissipatively collapsed to the point where the dark matter ceases to be dynamically dominant .",
    "much attention has been paid to the collapse of filamentary clouds ( uehara et al . 1996 ; nakamura & umemura 1999 , 2001 , 2002 ) .",
    "results from one- and two - dimensional simulations that otherwise include all the relevant processes for the primordial chemistry and cooling have estimated fragmentation scales @xmath65 and @xmath66 , depending on the ( central ) initial density . when sufficiently high ( @xmath67@xmath35 ) , the low - mass value is reached .",
    "this bifurcation has led to the prediction of a bimodal imf for the first stars ( nakamura & umemura 2001 ) .",
    "it is however , not obvious how such a high initial density can be reached in a realistic situation where the collapse starts from densities that are typically much smaller than the bifurcation value .      what is the further fate of the clumps discussed above ?",
    "in particular , one would like to test the notion that such a jeans unstable clump is the immediate progenitor of a single star which forms in its center .",
    "that will evidently only be correct if the clump does not undergo further subfragmentation upon collapsing to higher densities .",
    "it has long been suspected that such subfragmentation could occur at densities in excess of @xmath68@xmath35 , at which point three - body reactions become very efficient in converting the atomic gas ( with only a trace amount of h@xmath53 molecules from the h@xmath69 channel ) into fully molecular form : 3h @xmath22 h@xmath53 + h ( palla et al . 1983 ) .",
    "as the h@xmath53 coolant is now suddenly more abundant by a factor of @xmath70 , the corresponding boost in cooling could trigger a thermal instability , thus breaking up the clump into smaller pieces ( silk 1983 ) .",
    "both abn and bcl have included the three - body reactions in their chemical reaction networks , and have followed their simulations to higher densities to test whether subfragmentation does occur or not .",
    "both groups report that no further subfragmentation is seen .",
    "with hindsight , that may not be too surprising .",
    "the reason being that any small density fluctuations which are present earlier on , and which could serve as seeds for later fragmentation , will have been erased by pressure forces during the slow , quasi - hydrostatic ` loitering ' phase at @xmath71 .",
    "in addition , inefficient cooling may also play a role in suppressing high - density fragmentation . despite the increase in the cooling rate throughout the fully molecular gas ,",
    "this never leads to a significant drop in temperature due to the countervailing effect of compressional heating .    extending the analogous calculation for the collapse of a present - day protostar",
    "( larson 1969 ) to the primordial case , omukai & nishi ( 1998 ) have carried out one - dimensional hydrodynamical simulations in spherical symmetry .",
    "they also consider the full set of chemical reactions , and implement an algorithm to solve for the radiative transfer in the h@xmath53 lines , as well as in the continuum .",
    "the most important result is that the mass of the initial hydrostatic core , formed in the center of the collapsing cloud when the density is high enough ( @xmath72@xmath35 ) for the gas to become optically thick to continuum radiation , is almost the same as the ( second ) core in present - day star formation : @xmath73 . in figure  4 ,",
    "the radial profiles of density , temperature , velocity , and h@xmath53 abundance are shown ( reproduced from omukai & nishi 1998 ) .",
    "the profiles of density and velocity before the time of core formation ( corresponding to the curves with label 6 ) are well described by the larson - penston ( lp ) similarity solution .",
    "once the core has formed , the self - similarity is broken .",
    "similar results have been found by ripamonti et al .",
    "( 2002 ) who have in addition worked out the spectrum of the radiation that escapes from the collapsing clump ( mostly in the ir , both as continuum and line photons ) .",
    "this type of approximately self - similar behavior seems to be a very generic result of collapse with a simple equation of state , even when rotation and magnetic fields are included ( see larson 2003 ) .",
    "the apparent robustness of the lp solution thus supports the results found for the population  iii case .",
    "the small value of the initial core does not mean that this will be the final mass of a population  iii star .",
    "this instead will be determined by how efficient the accretion process will be in incorporating the clump mass into the growing protostar .",
    "how massive were the first stars ?",
    "star formation typically proceeds from the ` inside - out ' , through the accretion of gas onto a central hydrostatic core . whereas the initial mass of the hydrostatic core is very similar for primordial and present - day star formation ( see above ) , the accretion process  ultimately responsible for setting the final stellar mass ",
    "is expected to be rather different . on dimensional grounds , the accretion rate is simply related to the sound speed cubed over newton s constant ( or equivalently given by the ratio of the jeans mass and the free - fall time ) : @xmath74 .",
    "a simple comparison of the temperatures in present - day star forming regions ( @xmath75  k ) with those in primordial ones ( @xmath76  k ) already indicates a difference in the accretion rate of more than two orders of magnitude .",
    "recently , omukai & palla ( 2001 , 2003 ) have investigated the accretion problem in considerable detail , going beyond the simple dimensional argument given above .",
    "their computational technique approximates the time evolution by considering a sequence of steady - state accretion flows onto a growing hydrostatic core .",
    "somewhat counterintuitively , these authors identify a critical accretion rate , @xmath77  yr@xmath78 , such that for accretion rates higher than this , the protostar can not grow to masses much in excess of a few @xmath79 . for smaller rates , however , the accretion is predicted to proceed all the way up to @xmath80 , i.e. , of order the host clump .",
    "the physical basis for the critical accretion rate is that for ongoing accretion onto the core , the luminosity must not exceed the eddington value , @xmath81 . in the early stages of accretion , before the onset of hydrogen burning , the luminosity is approximately given by @xmath82 . by demanding @xmath83 it follows @xmath84 where @xmath85 , a typical value for a population  iii main - sequence star ( e.g. , bromm et al",
    ". 2001b ) . in figure  5 ( from omukai & palla 2003 ) , the mass - radius relation is shown for various values of the accretion rate .",
    "as can be seen , the dramatic swelling in radius effectively shuts off accretion at @xmath86 , when the accretion rate exceeds @xmath87 .",
    "realistic accretion flows are expected to have a time - dependent rate , and the outcome will thus depend on whether the accretion rate will decline rapidly enough to avoid exceeding the eddington luminosity at some stage during the evolution .",
    "the biggest caveat concerning the omukai & palla results seems to be the issue of geometry .",
    "a three - dimensional accretion flow of gas with some residual degree of angular momentum will deviate from spherical symmetry , and instead form a disk .",
    "it is then conceivable that most of the photons can escape along the axes whereas mass can flow in unimpeded through the accretion disk ( see tan & mckee 2003 ) .",
    "as described above , the accretion process may be able to incorporate a large part of the parent clump into the central star .",
    "_ can a population  iii star ever reach this asymptotic mass limit ? _",
    "the answer to this question is not yet known with any certainty , and it depends on whether the accretion from the dust - free envelope is eventually terminated by feedback from the star ( e.g. , omukai & palla 2001 , 2003 ; omukai & inutsuka 2002 ; ripamonti et al .",
    "2002 ; tan & mckee 2003 ) .",
    "the standard mechanism by which accretion may be terminated in metal - rich gas , namely radiation pressure on dust grains ( wolfire & cassinelli 1987 ) , is evidently not effective for gas with a primordial composition .",
    "recently , it has been speculated that accretion could instead be turned off through the formation of an region ( omukai & inutsuka 2002 ) , or through the radiation pressure exerted by trapped ly@xmath9 photons ( tan & mckee 2003 ) .",
    "the termination of the accretion process defines the current unsolved frontier in studies of population  iii star formation",
    ".      how and when did the transition take place from the early formation of massive stars to that of low - mass stars at later times ?",
    "the second generation of stars formed under conditions that were much more complicated again due to the feedback from the first stars on the igm , both due to the production of photons and of heavy elements .",
    "in contrast to the formation mode of massive stars ( population  iii ) at high redshifts , fragmentation is observed to favor stars below a solar mass ( population  i and ii ) in the present - day universe .",
    "the transition between these fundamental modes is expected to be mainly driven by the progressive enrichment of the cosmic gas with heavy elements , which enables the gas to cool to lower temperatures .",
    "the concept of a ` critical metallicity ' , @xmath88 , has been used to characterize the transition between population  iii and population  ii formation modes , where @xmath89 denotes the mass fraction contributed by all heavy elements ( omukai 2000 ; bromm et al .",
    "2001a ; schneider et al .",
    "2002 , 2003a ; mackey et al .",
    "these studies have constrained this important parameter to only within a few orders of magnitude , @xmath90 , under the implicit assumption of solar relative abundances of metals .",
    "this assumption is likely to be violated by the metal yields of the first sne at high - redshifts , for which strong deviations from solar abundance ratios are predicted ( e.g. , oh et al . 2001 ; heger & woosley 2002 ; qian , sargent , & wasserburg 2002 ; qian & wasserburg 2002 ; umeda & nomoto 2002 , 2003 ) .",
    "recently , bromm & loeb ( 2003b ) have shown that the transition between the above star formation modes is driven primarily by fine - structure line cooling of singly - ionized carbon or neutral atomic oxygen .",
    "earlier estimates of @xmath88 which did not explicitly distinguish between different coolants are refined by introducing separate critical abundances for carbon and oxygen , [ c / h]@xmath91 and [ o / h]@xmath91 , respectively , where [ a / h]= @xmath92 .",
    "since c and o are also the most important coolants throughout most of the cool atomic ism in present - day galaxies , it is not implausible that these species might be responsible for the global shift in the star formation mode . under the temperature and density conditions that characterize population  iii star formation , the fine - structure lines of and dominate over all other metal transitions ( see hollenbach & mckee 1989 ) .",
    "cooling due to molecules becomes important only at lower temperatures , and cooling due to dust grains only at higher densities ( e.g. , omukai 2000 ; schneider et al .",
    "the presence of dust is likely to modify the equation of state at these high densities in important ways ( schneider et al .",
    "2003a ) , and it will be interesting to explore its role in future collapse calculations .",
    "the physical nature of the dust , however , that is produced by the first sne is currently still quite uncertain ( e.g. , loeb & haiman 1997 ; todini & ferrara 2001 ; nozawa et al . 2003 ; schneider , ferrara , & salvaterra 2003b ) .",
    "numerically , the critical c and o abundances are estimated to be : [ c / h]@xmath93 and [ o / h]@xmath94 .",
    "even if sufficient c or o atoms are present to further cool the gas , there will be a minimum attainable temperature that is set by the interaction of the atoms with the thermal cmb : @xmath95 ( e.g. , larson 1998 ; clarke & bromm 2003 ) . at @xmath96 ,",
    "this results in a characteristic stellar mass of @xmath97 , where @xmath98 is the density at which opacity prevents further fragmentation ( e.g. , rees 1976 ) .",
    "it is possible that the transition from the high - mass to the low - mass star formation mode was modulated by the cmb temperature and was therefore gradual , involving intermediate - mass ( ` population  ii.5 ' ) stars at intermediate redshifts ( mackey et al .",
    "this transitional population could give rise to the faint sne that have been proposed to explain the observed abundance patterns in metal - poor stars ( umeda & nomoto 2002 , 2003 ) .",
    "when and how uniformly the transition in the cosmic star formation mode did take place was governed by the detailed enrichment history of the igm .",
    "this in turn was determined by the hydrodynamical transport and mixing of metals from the first sn explosions ( e.g. , mori et al .",
    "2002 ; bromm et al .",
    "2003 ; scannapieco et al .",
    "2003 ; wada & venkatesan 2003 ) .",
    "the transport and the mixing of the first heavy elements into the pristine igm is currently another subject at the frontier of astrophysical cosmology .",
    "it has long been realized that the most metal - poor stars found in our cosmic neighborhood would encode the signature from the first stars within their elemental abundance pattern ( e.g. , bond 1981 ; beers , preston , & shectman 1992 ) . for many decades , however , the observational search has failed to discover a truly first - generation star with zero metallicity .",
    "indeed , there seemed to have been an observational lower limit of [ fe / h ] @xmath99 ( e.g. , carr 1987 ) . in view of the recent theoretical prediction that most population  iii stars were very massive , with associated lifetimes of @xmath100  yr , the failure to find any ` living ' population  iii star in the galaxy is not surprising , as they would all have died a long time ago ( e.g. , hernandez & ferrara 2001 ) . furthermore , theory has predicted that star formation out of extremely low - metallicity gas , with @xmath101 ( see   3.4 ) , would be essentially equivalent to that out of truly primordial gas . again , this theoretical prediction was in accordance with the apparent observed lower - metallicity cutoff .",
    "recently , however , this simple picture has been challenged by the discovery of the star he0107 - 5240 with a mass of @xmath102 and an _ iron _ abundance of @xmath103 } = -5.3 $ ] ( christlieb et al .",
    "this finding indicates that at least some low mass stars could have formed out of extremely low - metallicity gas .",
    "does the existence of this star invalidate the theory of a metallicity threshold for enabling low - mass star formation ?",
    "as pointed out by umeda & nomoto ( 2003 ) , a possible explanation could lie in the unusually high abundances of carbon and oxygen in he0107 - 5240 .    in figure  6 ,",
    "the theoretical c and o thresholds derived by bromm & loeb ( 2003b ) are compared to the observed abundances in metal - poor dwarf ( akerman et al .",
    "2003 ) and giant ( cayrel et al . 2003 ) stars in the halo of our galaxy . as can be seen ,",
    "all data points lie above the critical o abundance but a few cases lie below the critical c threshold .",
    "all of these low mass stars are consistent with the model since the corresponding o abundances lie above the predicted threshold .",
    "the sub - critical [ c / h ] abundances could have either originated in the progenitor cloud or from the mixing of cno - processed material ( with carbon converted into nitrogen ) into the stellar atmosphere during the red giant phase .",
    "note that the extremely iron - poor star he0107 - 5240 has c and o abundances that both lie above the respective critical levels .",
    "the formation of this low mass star ( @xmath104 ) is therefore consistent with the theoretical framework considered by bromm & loeb ( 2003b ) .    the lessons from stellar archaeology on the nature of the first stars are likely to increase in importance ,",
    "since greatly improved , large surveys of metal - poor galactic halo stars are under way , or are currently being planned .",
    "quasars are believed to be powered by the heat generated during the accretion of gas onto smbhs ( e.g. , rees 1984 ) .",
    "the existence of smbhs with inferred masses of @xmath105 , less than a billion years after the big bang , as implied by the recent discovery of quasars at redshifs @xmath106 ( e.g. , fan et al . 2003 ) , provides important constraints on the smbh formation scenario ( haiman & loeb 2001 ) .",
    "_ can the seeds of smbhs form through the direct collapse of primordial gas clouds at high redshifts ?",
    "_ previous work ( loeb & rasio 1994 ) has shown that without a pre - existing central point mass , this is rendered difficult by the negative feedback resulting from star formation in the collapsing cloud .",
    "the input of kinetic energy due to supernova explosions prevents the gas from assembling in the center of the dark matter potential well , thus precluding the direct formation of an smbh .",
    "if , however , star formation was suppressed in a cloud that could still undergo overall collapse , such an adverse feedback would not occur .",
    "the smbh formation problem has recently been revisited with sph simulations of isolated 2@xmath107peaks with total masses of @xmath108 that collapse at @xmath109 ( bromm & loeb 2003a ) .",
    "the virial temperature of these dwarf galaxies exceeds @xmath110k , so as to allow collapse of their gas through cooling by atomic hydrogen transitions ( oh & haiman 2002 ) . since structure formation proceeds in a bottom - up fashion , such a system would encompass lower - mass halos that would have collapsed earlier on .",
    "these sub - systems have virial temperatures below @xmath111  k , and consequently rely on the presence of h@xmath18 for their cooling . molecular hydrogen , however , is fragile and readily destroyed by photons in the lyman - werner bands with energies ( @xmath112  ev ) just below the lyman limit ( haiman , rees , & loeb 1997 ) .",
    "these photons are able to penetrate a predominantly neutral igm .    at first ,",
    "the limiting case is considered where h@xmath18 destruction is complete .",
    "depending on the initial spin , either one ( for zero initial spin ) or two compact objects form with masses in excess of @xmath113 and radii @xmath114  pc ( see fig .",
    "7 ) . in the case of nonzero spin",
    "a binary system of clumps has formed with a separation of @xmath115  pc .",
    "such a system of two compact objects is expected to efficiently radiate gravitational waves that could be detectable with the planned _ laser interferometer space antenna _",
    "( lisa ; wyithe & loeb 2003c ) .",
    "what is the further fate of the central object ? once the gas has collapsed to densities above @xmath116  @xmath35 and radii @xmath117  cm , thomson scattering traps the photons , and the cooling time consequently becomes much larger than both the free - fall and viscous timescales ( see bromm & loeb 2003a for details ) . the gas is therefore likely to settle into a radiation - pressure supported configuration resembling a rotating supermassive star .",
    "recent fully - relativistic calculations of the evolution of such stars predict that they would inevitably collapse to a massive black hole ( baumgarte & shapiro 1999 ; shibata & shapiro 2002 ) . under a wide range of initial conditions , a substantial fraction ( @xmath118% ) of the mass of the supermassive star",
    "is expected to end up in the black hole .",
    "is such a complete destruction of h@xmath18 possible ? when including an external background of soft uv radiation in the simulation , bromm & loeb ( 2003a ) find that a flux level comparable to what is expected close to the end of the reionization epoch is sufficient to suppress h@xmath53 molecule formation .",
    "this is the case even when the effect of self - shielding is taken into account ( draine & bertoldi 1996 ) .",
    "the effective suppression of h@xmath18 formation crucially depends on the presence of a stellar - like radiation background .",
    "it is therefore likely that stars existed before the first quasars could have formed .",
    "the first stars and quasars , their formation and their cosmological implications , are a fascinating subject at the frontier of modern cosmology . up to now ,",
    "most of our efforts have been theoretical , but we are approaching the point where observations can test our ideas .",
    "this is very significant , as we are bound to learn important lessons about the physical state of the universe at the end of its dark age .",
    "these empirical probes are provided by both high - redshift observations , and complementary to this , by the ` near - field cosmology ' ( freeman & bland - hawthorn 2002 ) of scrutinizing the chemical abundance patterns in extremely metal - poor stars in our local cosmic neighborhood .",

    "<S> i review recent progress in understanding the formation of the first stars and quasars . </S>",
    "<S> the initial conditions for their emergence are given by the now firmly established model of cosmological structure formation . </S>",
    "<S> numerical simulations of the collapse and fragmentation of primordial gas indicate that the first stars formed at redshifts @xmath0 , and that they were predominantly very massive , with @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> important uncertainties , however , remain . </S>",
    "<S> paramount among them is the accretion process , which builds up the final stellar mass by incorporating part of the diffuse , dust - free envelope into the central protostellar core . </S>",
    "<S> the first quasars , on the other hand , are predicted to have formed later on , at @xmath2 , in more massive dark matter halos , with total masses , @xmath3 , characteristic of dwarf galaxies . </S>"
