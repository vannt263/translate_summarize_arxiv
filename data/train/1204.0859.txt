    "we thus need first exactly solve the eigen - problem of the twisted fokker - planck equation , with time - independent @xmath54 : @xmath156 with @xmath157 note that in the main text , we set @xmath158 for the sake of clarity .",
    "we make an ansatz of the solution : @xmath159 where @xmath160 is the coefficient depending on initial conditions , @xmath161 denotes the @xmath41-th eigenvalue of @xmath54 , @xmath162 is the corresponding eigenfunction , and @xmath163 is a parameter to be determined in follows . put this ansatz into the twisted fokker - planck equation , and utilize the following relations : @xmath164 we then have @xmath165y\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\\\ + \\left[\\frac{k_b}{4t^2}\\left(\\frac{t_1}{\\gamma_1}+\\frac{t_2}{\\gamma_2}\\right)-\\frac{k}{2t}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\gamma_1}+\\frac{1}{\\gamma_2}-\\frac{2k_bt_1}{\\gamma_1}\\bm{i}\\chi\\right)+k^2\\left(\\frac{k_bt_1}{\\gamma_1}\\left(\\bm{i}\\chi\\right)^2-\\frac{1}{\\gamma_1}\\bm{i}\\chi\\right)\\right]y^2+\\\\ k\\left(\\frac{1}{\\gamma_1}+\\frac{1}{\\gamma_2}-\\frac{k_bt_1}{\\gamma_1}\\bm{i}\\chi\\right)-\\frac{k_b}{2t}\\left(\\frac{t_1}{\\gamma_1}+\\frac{t_2}{\\gamma_2}\\right)-\\lambda_n\\bigg\\}f_n(y)=0.\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] to eliminate the term related to @xmath166 , we found that one needs to set @xmath167 thus , the above equation reduces to : @xmath168y^2+\\frac{k}{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\gamma_1}+\\frac{1}{\\gamma_2}\\right)-\\lambda_n\\right\\}f_n(y)=0.\\ ] ] let us set @xmath169 , @xmath170 , then we have : @xmath171y^2+\\frac{r_1+r_2}{2}-\\lambda_n\\right\\}f_n(y)=0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath172y^2+\\frac{r_1+r_2}{2}-\\lambda_n\\right\\}f_n(y)=0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] then set @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath173 , we can simplify the above equation as @xmath174 we further set @xmath175 and @xmath176 , which finally leads to the eigen - problem of quantum harmonic oscillator s schrdinger s equation : @xmath177 this equation requires @xmath178 , with @xmath179 . from any textbook of quantum mechanics which solves the schrdinger s equation of quantum harmonic oscillator , we know the eigenvalue : @xmath180,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the eigenfunction @xmath181 where @xmath182 denotes the @xmath41-th order hermite polynomials .",

    "if the system is under time - dependent modulation such that the fokker - planck operator is time - dependent @xmath25 , then as discussed in the main text , the full counting statistics rely on the instantaneous right and left ground - state @xmath199 and @xmath200 .",

    "let us set the counting parameter @xmath33 to look into spectrum of the operator @xmath206 in the real physical space . from eq .",
    "( 30 ) , we can see that the spectrum is ordered by @xmath41 and the eigenvalue of the ground state @xmath207 .",
    "this is apparent , since it corresponds to the long time steady state of the evolution .",
    "so , the rate of relaxation to the steady state is determined by the inverse energy gap @xmath208 . as a consequence ,",
    "the system s characteristic time scale of relaxation is given as @xmath209 where @xmath210 has the physics meaning of the effective damping rate .",

    "we assume the system is already at its steady state , or say ground state .",
    "and then , time - dependent modulations are imposed on the system adiabatically .",
    "thus , we can make the ansatz @xmath212 , and substitute it into the time - dependent twisted fokker - planck equation @xmath213 .",
    "we then obtain @xmath214 utilizing the bi - orthonormal condition @xmath215 , we left multiply @xmath216 , and do integral over @xmath35 , such that : @xmath217 therefore , in the adiabatic limit , we obtain @xmath218 consequently , the characteristic function finally reads @xmath219\\exp\\left[{\\int_0^t\\lambda_0(\\chi , t')dt'}\\right ] \\exp\\left[{-\\int_0^tdt'\\int^{\\infty}_{-\\infty }   dy\\varphi_0(y,\\chi , t')\\dot{\\psi}_0(y,\\chi , t')}\\right].\\ ] ] the first exponent , the time integral of the instantaneous ground - state eigenvalue , is an analog of the dynamic phase . while the second additional exponent resulting from the time - evolving of ground eignstates is an analog of the geometric phase .",

    "<S> the geometric effect is absent in the case of merely modulating system - bath couplings . </S>",
    "<S> similar phenomenon is also observed in quantum heat transport @xcite , which implies that this may have connection with some universal pumping restrictions @xcite in open systems . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , this absence of geometric heat flux may relate to a no - pumping theorem of a different quantity , probability current , in closed driven systems without explicitly connecting with heat baths @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> ( [ eq : fp ] ) , the probability current is absent when @xmath73 is time - independent . </S>",

    "<S> for example , if we modulate one system - bath coupling @xmath76 and one bath temperature @xmath77 , the nonzero first derivative of curvature , @xmath78\\neq0 $ ] can induce nonzero geometric heat flux @xmath79 . </S>",
    "<S> for another example , if two baths are kept isothermal @xmath80 , then the dynamic heat flux will be always zero , @xmath81 . </S>",

    "<S> the most typical modulation is driving bath temperatures @xmath84 @xcite , because implementing this protocol is much easier than modulating @xmath26 and @xmath27 in practice . </S>",
    "<S> the curvature for this two - temperature driving reads : @xmath85 when the couplings are symmetric , @xmath86 , one can see that @xmath87 . </S>",
    "<S> that is , the geometric - phase effect is absent in the symmetric linear ( harmonic ) system . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , even when two couplings are asymmetric , @xmath88 , we find @xmath89 in spite of nonzero @xmath90 , so that the geometric heat flux is still vanishing , @xmath91 . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , although the geometric effect exists in the classical asymmetric linear system , its contribution is not observable if one measures only the average flux . </S>",
    "<S> the geometric effect can only manifest itself in the higher order heat fluctuations , like the shot noise of currents , i.e. , @xmath92 .    </S>",
    "<S> recalling the modulation @xmath93 can induce the nonzero geometric heat flux , we speculate that as long as the viscosity @xmath94 is temperature dependent , the modulation @xmath84 can be effectively equal to the modulation @xmath93 . as a consequence , in such systems of temperature - dependent viscosity , merely modulating @xmath84 may produce nonzero curvature thus nonzero geometric heat flux . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , viscosity is generally temperature - dependent @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> phenomenologically , we can assume @xmath95 , with @xmath96 . </S>",
    "<S> thus for the typical modulation @xmath84 , we indeed obtain the nonzero geometric heat flux @xmath97 @xmath98 clearly , the temperature - dependence plays a key role for the manifestation of geometric effect . </S>",
    "<S> given a modulation cycle , the geometric heat flux @xmath99 vanishes when the temperature - dependency @xmath100 ; while @xmath99 increases to a saturated value as @xmath101 increases . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath102 , @xmath103 also becomes temperature independent , and in turn @xmath99 becomes zero as well .    </S>",
    "<S> considering the intrinsic effective temperature - dependencies of system parameters are ubiquitous in nonlinear interacting oscillators @xcite , we thus speculate that with the help of nonlinearity , the existing geometric effect is able to manifest itself into the geometric heat flux as well . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we further consider the fpu-@xmath104 model @xcite , with nonlinear interacting potential : @xmath105 . as we shall see in follows , that the nonlinear strength @xmath106 can induce effective temperature dependence of system parameters  @xcite is the crucial ingredient to manifest geometric heat flux .    </S>",

    "<S> when @xmath29 becomes large ( adiabatic limit ) , @xmath114 saturates to a fixed value independent of @xmath29 , which indicates that it is purely a geometric property . </S>",
    "<S> the geometric heat per driving cycle does not rely on the driving rate , but only depends on the geometry of the driving contour in parameter spaces . </S>",
    "<S> the deviations of @xmath114 from the fixed value at the fast driving regime are due to the breakdown of the adiabatic precondition .    </S>",
    "<S> the inset of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : nonlinear ] verifies that when the nonlinear interaction reduces to harmonic coupling @xmath115 , the geometric contribution disappears @xmath116 . only with the help of nonlinearity , the geometric effect of temperature modulations can manifest itself into the heat flux . </S>",

    "<S> the simulations are well fitted by @xmath139 , approximated from eq . </S>",

    "<S> parameters are @xmath140k@xmath141/k , @xmath142pf , @xmath143k.,title=\"fig : \" ]    nonlinear capacitor can be used to simulate the nonlinearity effect . to mimic the related temperature - dependent viscosity </S>",
    "<S> , we can choose resistors of temperature - dependent resistance , e.g. @xmath144 , with contacting them to their respective reservoirs . </S>",
    "<S> from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ nonlinear - berry ] ) , we then have @xmath145 for cyclic modulation : @xmath146 , @xmath147 , we will have zero @xmath148 but nonzero @xmath99 . </S>",
    "<S> although this geometric heat flux is independent of @xmath121 and @xmath120 , the adiabatic precondition eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : adiabatic ] ) requires @xmath149 . </S>",
    "<S> assume we use @xmath140 k@xmath141/k , @xmath142 pf , @xmath143 k , we will have the adiabatic condition @xmath150 @xmath151s . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : rc](b ) . clearly , for @xmath152 @xmath151s , the geometric heat per cycle already reaches the adiabatic limit . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , as long as the system evolves a long time , i.e. with large number of cycles , we can accumulate a large geometric heat , e.g. , for @xmath152 @xmath151s , @xmath153 k , @xmath154 mev , after each minute we can have @xmath155 ev . moreover , </S>",
    "<S> if we scale up many @xmath0 circuits in parallel , we are able to obtain even larger geometric heat flux . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , by increasing the modulation amplitude , one can also increase geometric heat flux , as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : rc](c ) .    </S>",
    "<S> given the fact that the fluctuation theorems in electric circuits @xcite as well as the energy rectification have been experimentally realized in a nonlinear electrical transmission line @xcite , we believe that our prediction of geometric - phase effect on heat transport can be also experimentally validated in a foreseeable future . furthermore , as our ability to design and manipulate nano / micro - sized systems improves , we believe that the present study of geometric energy ( heat ) flux could provide a new means of energy harvesting by harnessing the ubiquitous cyclic changes in the universe .    </S>",
