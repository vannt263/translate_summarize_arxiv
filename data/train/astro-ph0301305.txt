    "the presence of a strong absorption line ( equivalent width of @xmath8 ) in the spectrum of a galaxy is an indication that the spectral energy distribution of that galaxy is dominated by a stars .",
    "models of galaxy evolution indicate that such a strong line ( in the spectrum of a galaxy ) can only be reproduced using models that include a recent burst of star formation , followed by passive evolution , as any on  going star  formation in the galaxy would hide the absorption line due to emission  filling ( of the line ) and the dominance of hot o and b stars , which have intrinsically weaker absorption than a stars ( see , for example , balogh et al .",
    "1999 ; poggianti et al .",
    "therefore the existence of a strong absorption line in the spectrum of a galaxy suggests that the galaxy has under  gone a recent transformation in its star  formation history . in the literature ,",
    "such galaxies are called `` post  starburst '' , `` e+a '' , k+a , and h@xmath9strong galaxies and the exact physical mechanism(s ) responsible for the abrupt change in the star formation history of such galaxies remains unclear .",
    "these galaxies have received much attention as they provide an opportunity to study galaxy evolution _ `` in action''_.    strong galaxies were first discovered by dressler & gunn ( 1983 , 1992 ) in their spectroscopic study of galaxies in distant , rich clusters of galaxies .",
    "they discovered cluster galaxies that contained strong balmer absorption lines but with no detectable emission lines .",
    "they named such galaxies `` e+a '' , as their spectra resembled the superposition of an elliptical galaxy spectrum and a star spectrum .",
    "therefore , e+a ( or k+a ) galaxies were originally thought to be a cluster  specific phenomenon and several physical mechanisms have been proposed to explain such galaxies .",
    "for example , ram ",
    "pressure stripping of the intra  stellar gas by a hot , intra  cluster medium , which eventually leads to the termination of star formation once all the gas in the galaxy has been removed , or used up ( gunn & gott 1972 ; farouki & shapiro 1980 ; kent 1981 ; abadi , moore & bower 1999 ; fujita & nagashima 1999 ; quilis , moore & bower 2000 ) .",
    "alternative mechanisms include high  speed galaxy  galaxy interactions in clusters ( moore et al .",
    "1996 , 1999 ) and interactions with the gravitational potential well of the cluster ( byrd & valtonen 1990 ; valluri 1993 ; bekki , shioya & couch 2001 ) .    to test such hypotheses , zabludoff et al .",
    "( 1996 ) performed a search for e+a ( or k+a ) galaxies in the las campanas redshift survey ( lcrs ; shectman et al .",
    "1996 ) and found that only 21 of the 11113 lcrs galaxies they studied , satisfied their criteria for a e+a galaxy .",
    "this work clearly demonstrates the rarity of such galaxies at low redshift .",
    "furthermore , zabludoff et al . ( 1996 ) found that 75% of their selected galaxies reside in the field , rather than the cores of rich clusters .",
    "this conclusion was confirmed by balogh et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , who also performed a search for strong galaxies in the redshift surveys of the canadian network for observational cosmology ( cnoc ; yee , ellingson , & carlberg 1996 ) , and found that the fraction of such galaxies in clusters was consistent with that in the field .",
    "alternatively , the study of dressler et al .",
    "( 1999 ) found an order  of  magnitude increase in the abundance of e+a ( or k+a ) galaxies in distant clusters compared to the field ( see also castander et al .",
    "2001 ) . taken together",
    ", these studies suggest that the physical interpretation of strong galaxies is more complicated than originally envisaged , with the possibility that different physical mechanisms are important in different environment , _",
    "e.g. _ , 5 of the 21 e+a galaxies discovered by zabludoff et al .",
    "( 1996 ) show signs of tidal features , indicative of galaxy  galaxy interactions or mergers .",
    "furthermore , redshift evolution might be an important factor in the differences seen between these surveys .",
    "in addition to studying the environment of strong galaxies , several authors have focused on understanding the morphology and dust content of these galaxies .",
    "this has been driven by the fact that on  going star formation in post  starburst galaxies could be hidden by dust obscuration ( see poggianti & barbaro 1997 ; poggianti et al .",
    "1999 ; bekki et al .",
    "2001 for more discussion ) .",
    "in fact , smail et al ( 1999 ) discovered examples of such galaxies using infrared ( ir ) and radio observations of galaxies in distant clusters .",
    "they discovered five post  starburst galaxies ( based on their optical spectra ) that showed evidence for dust  lanes in their ir morphology , as well as radio emission consistent with on  going star formation .",
    "however , radio observations of the zabludoff et al .",
    "( 1996 ) sample of nearby e+a galaxies indicates that a majority of these galaxies are not dust  enshrouded starburst galaxies .",
    "for example , miller & owen ( 2001 ) only detected radio emission from 2 of the 15 e+a galaxies they observed , and the derived star  formation rates ( sfrs ) were consistent with quiescent star formation and thus much lower than those observed for the dust  enshrouded starburst galaxies of smail et al ( 1999 ) .",
    "chang et al . ( 2001 ) also did not detect radio emission from 5 e+a galaxies they observed from the zabludoff et al .",
    "( 1996 ) sample and concluded that these galaxies were not dust  enshrouded starbursts . in summary , these studies demonstrate that some e+a galaxies have dust  enshrouded star formation , but the fraction remains ill  determined .",
    "furthermore , it is unclear how these different sub  classes of galaxies are related , and if there are any environmental and evolutionary processes at play .",
    "the interpretation of strong galaxies ( e+a , k+a , _ etc .",
    "_ ) suffers from small number statistics and systematic differences in the selection and definition of such galaxies between the different surveys constructed to date .",
    "therefore , many of the difficulties associated with understanding the physical nature of these galaxies could be solved through the study of a large , homogeneous sample of galaxies . in this paper , we present such a sample derived from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; york et al .",
    "the advantage of this sample , over previous work , is the quality and quantity of both the photometric and spectroscopic data , as well as the homogeneous selection of sdss galaxies which covers a wide range of local environments .",
    "we present in this paper a sample of galaxies that have been selected based solely on the observed strength of their absorption line .",
    "our selection is thus inclusive , containing many of the sub  classes of galaxies discussed in the literature until now , _",

    "the wavelength coverage of the spectrographs is 3800  to 9200 , with a spectral resolution of 1800 . the data from these spectrographs is automatically reduced to produce flux and wavelength  calibrated spectra ( spectro2d data analysis pipeline ) .",
    "the sdss spectra are then analyzed via the sdss spectro1d data processing pipeline to obtain a host of measured quantities for each spectrum ( see stoughton et al .",
    "2002 ; frieman et al .",
    ", in prep , for further details ) . for example , spectro1d determines the redshift of the spectrum both from absorption lines ( via cross - correlation ; heavens 1993 ) , and emission lines ( via a wavelet  based peak  finding algorithm ; see frieman et al .",
    ", in prep ) . once the redshift is known , spectro1d estimates the continuum emission at each pixel using the median value seen in a sliding box of 100 pixels centered on that pixel .",

    "unfortunately , this smearing correction can systematically bias the observed flux of any emission and absorption lines in the spectrum , as the correction is only applied to the continuum . as shown by hopkins et al . in prep .",

    "furthermore , the equivalent width of our lines is almost unaffected by this smearing correction as , by definition , they are computed relative to the height of the continuum .",
    "in this section , we discuss the measurement of the equivalent width ( ew ) of the absorption line in the sdss galaxy spectra described in section [ data ] .",
    "the presence of a strong absorption line in a galaxy spectrum indicates that the stellar population of the galaxy contains a significant fraction of a stars , which must have formed within the last gigayear ( see section [ intro ] ) .",
    "the line is preferred over other hydrogen balmer lines ( _ e.g. _ , h@xmath23 , h@xmath24 , h@xmath25 , h@xmath26 ) because the line is isolated from other emission and absorption lines , as well as strong continuum features in the galaxy spectrum ( _ e.g. _ , d4000 ) .",

    "several different methods have been employed to measure the line , or select post  starburst galaxies .",

    "1999 ; poggianti et al .",
    "1999 ) . in light of the potential systematic differences between the different methods of measuring the line ,",
    "we have investigated the relative merits of the two main approaches in the literature  fitting a gaussian and summing the flux in a narrow wavelength window  for determining the ew of the line for the signal  to  noise , resolution , and size of the sdss spectral dataset used in this paper .",
    "first , we investigate the optimal method for computing the ew of the line from the sdss spectra using the non  parametric methodology outlined in abraham et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and balogh et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , _ i.e. _ , summing the flux within narrow wavelength windows centered on and off the  absorption line .",
    "we estimate the continuum flux via linear interpolation between two wavelength windows placed either side of the line ( 4030  to 4082and 4122  to 4170 ) .",
    "we used the same wavelength windows as in abraham et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and balogh et al .",
    "( 1999 ) for estimating the continuum because they are devoid of any strong emission and absorption features , and the continuum is relatively smooth within these wavelength ranges .",
    "also , these windows are close to the line without being contaminated by the line emission . when fitting the continuum flux level , the flux in each pixel was weighted by the inverse square of the error on the flux in that pixel . after the initial fit to the continuum",
    ", we re  iterate the fit once by rejecting @xmath27 outliers to the original continuum fit . this guards against noise spikes in the surrounding continuum .",
    "the rest  frame ew of the line was calculated by summing the ratio of the flux in each pixel of the spectrum , over the estimated continuum flux in that pixel based on our linear interpolation . for this summation , we investigated two different wavelength windows for the line ; 4088  to 4116 , which is the same as the wavelength range used by balogh et al .",
    "( 1999)@xmath28 and 4082  to 4122 , which is the wider range of abraham et al .",
    "we summarize the wavelength ranges used to measure the ews in table [ tab : wavelength ] .    in figure",
    "[ fig : hd_narrow_wide ] , we compare the two non  parametric measurements of  ( _ i.e. _ , using the narrow and wide wavelength windows ) , and find , as expected , a strong linear relationship between the two measurements : the scatter about the best fit linear relationship to these measurements is gaussian with @xmath29 .",
    "however , there are systematic differences between the two measurements which are correlated to the intrinsic width of the line .",
    "for example , for large ews of , we find that the wider wavelength window has a larger value than the narrower window .",
    "this is because the 28  window is too small to capture the wings of a strong line and thus a wider window is needed .",
    "alternatively , for smaller ews , the narrower 28  window is better as the larger window of 40  is more affected by noise as it contains more of the continuum flux than the narrow window .",
    "this is seen in figure [ fig : hd_narrow_wide ] where the larger window systematically over  estimates the ew of the weaker lines .    as a compromise",
    ", we have empirically determined that the best methodology for our analysis is to always select the larger of the two ew measurements ( this was discovered by visually inspecting many of the spectra and their various measurements ) .",
    "this is a crude adaptive approach of selecting the size of the window based on the intrinsic strength of the line .",
    "in fact , we find that 20.2% of our selected galaxies ( see section [ catalog ] ) were selected based on the measurement in the larger wavelength window . therefore , for the analysis presented in this paper , we use h@xmath30 , which is the maximum of the two non  parametric measurements discussed above .    in figure",
    "[ fig : hd_max_1d ] , we now compare the h@xmath30 measurement discussed above to the automatic gaussian fits to the line from the sdss spectro1d analysis of the spectra .",
    "as expected , the two methods give similar results for the ew of the line for the largest ews .",
    "however , there are significant differences , as seen in figure [ fig : hd_max_1d ] , between these two methodologies .",
    "first , there are many galaxies with a negative ew ( emission ) as measured by spectro1d , but possess a ( large ) positive ew ( absorption ) using the non  parametric method .",
    "these cases are caused by emission  filling , _",
    "i.e. _ , a small amount of emission at the bottom of the  absorption line ( see section [ emfilling ] ) .",
    "this results in spectro1d fitting the gaussian to the central emission line , thus producing a negative ew . on the other hand , the non  parametric method simply sums all the flux in the region averaging over the emission and still producing a positive ew . in figure",
    "[ fig : spec-0293 - 51689 - 144.ps ] , we present five typical examples of this phenomenon .",
    "another noticeable difference in figure [ fig : hd_max_1d ] is the deviation from the one  to  one relation for ews near zero , _",
    "i.e. _ , as the line becomes weak , it is buried in the noise of the continuum making it difficult to automatically fit a gaussian to the line . in such cases",
    ", spectro1d tends to over  estimate the ew of the line because it preferentially fits a broad , shallow gaussian to the noise in the spectrum .",
    "typical examples of this problem are shown in figure [ fig : spec-0415 - 51810 - 304.ps ] .",
    "we conclude from our study of the sdss spectra that the non  parametric techniques of abraham et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and balogh et al .",
    "( 1999 ) are preferred to the automatic gaussian fits of spectro1d , especially for the lower signal  to  noise sdss spectra which are a majority in our sample ( see figure [ fig : sng ] ) .",
    "we note that many of the problems associated with the automatic gaussian fitting of spectro1d can be avoided by fitting gaussians interactively . however , this is not practical for large datasets such as the sdss .",
    "in addition to estimating the ew of the line , we have used our flux  summing technique to estimate the rest frame equivalent widths of both the and emission lines .",
    "we perform this analysis on all sdss spectra , in preference to using the spectro1d measurements of these lines , as these emission lines are the primary diagnostics of on  going star ",
    "formation in a galaxy and thus , we are interested in detecting any evidence of these lines in our hds galaxies . as discussed in section [ hdelta ] , the flux  summing technique is better for the lower signal  to  noise spectra , while the gaussian  fitting method of spectro1d is optimal for higher signal  to  noise detections of these emission lines , especially in the case of where spectro1d de  blends the and lines .",
    "we use the same flux ",
    "summing methodology as discussed above for the line , except we only use one wavelength window centered on the two emission lines .",
    "we list in table [ tab : wavelength ] the wavelength intervals used in summing the flux for the and emission lines and the continuum regions around these lines .",
    "once again , the continuum flux per pixel for each emission line was estimated using linear interpolation of the continuum estimated either side of the emission lines ( weighted by the inverse square of the errors on the pixel values during a line fitting procedure ) .",
    "we again iterate the continuum fit once rejecting @xmath27 outliers to the original continuum fit .",
    "we do not de  blend the and lines and as a result , some of our ew measurements may be over  estimated .",
    "however the contamination is less than 5% from line at 6648  and less than 30% from line at 6583 .",
    "we present estimates of the external error on our measurements of and in section [ error ] .    in figure",
    "[ fig : oii_1d_tomo ] , we compare our equivalent width measurements to that from spectro1d for all sdss spectra . in this paper ,",
    "positive ews are absorption lines and negative ews are emission lines .",
    "there is a good agreement between the two methods for ew()@xmath31 , where the scatter is @xmath32 .",
    "however , at lower ews , the spectro1d measurement of is systematically larger than our flux  summing method which is the result of spectro1d fitting a broad gaussian to the noise in the spectrum .",
    "furthermore , our continuum measurements for the line are estimated close to the line , in a region of the spectrum where the continuum is varying rapidly with wavelength ( _ e.g. _ , d4000 break ) .",
    "once again , we are only concerned with making a robust detection of any emission , rather than trying to accurately quantify the properties of the emission line . therefore , we prefer our non  parametric method , especially for the low signal  to  noise cases .    in figure",
    "[ fig : ha_1d_tomo ] , we compare our equivalent width measurements against that of spectro1d for all sdss spectra regardless of their  ew .",
    "the two locii of points seen in this figure are caused by contamination in our estimates of due to strong emission lines in agns , _",
    "i.e. _ , the top locus of points have larger ews in our flux ",
    "summing method than measured by spectro1d due to contamination by the lines .",
    "this is confirmed by the fact that the top locus of points is dominated by agns . at low ews ,",
    "we again see a systematic difference between our measurements and those of spectro1d , with spectro1d again over  estimating the line because it is jointly fitting multiple gaussians to low signal  to  noise detections of the and emission lines .",
    "finally , we do not make any correction for extinction and stellar absorption on our flux ",
    "summed measurements of ( see section [ emfilling ] ) .",
    "as mentioned above , our measurements of the absorption line can be affected by emission  filling , _",
    "i.e. _ , emission at the bottom of the absorption line .",
    "this problem could be solved by fitting two gaussians to the line ; one for absorption , one for emission .",
    "we found however that this method is only reliable for spectra with a signal  to  noise of @xmath33 and , as shown in figure [ fig : sng ] , this is only viable for a small fraction of our spectra",
    ". therefore , we must explore an alternative approach for correcting for this potential systematic bias ; however , we stress that the sense of any systematic bias on our non  parametric summing method would be to always decrease ( less absorption ) the observed ew of the absorption line and thus our technique gives a lower limit to the amount of absorption in the spectrum .    to help rectify the problem of emission  filling , we have used the and  emission lines ( where available ) to jointly constrain the amount of emission  filling at the line as well as estimate the effects of internal dust extinction in the galaxy .",
    "furthermore , our estimates of the emission  filling are complicated by the effects of stellar absorption on the and  emission lines . in this analysis",
    ", we have used the spectro1d measurements of and  lines in preference to our flux  summing technique discussed in section [ oiiha ] , because the emission  filling correction is only important in strongly star  forming galaxies where the and  emission lines are well fit by a gaussian and , for the line , require careful de  blending from the lines .    to solve the problem of emission  filling ,",
    "we have adopted two different methodologies which we describe in detail below .",
    "the first method is an iterative procedure that begins with a initial estimate for the amount of stellar absorption at the  and emission lines , _",
    "i.e. _ , we assume ew ( absorption ) = 1.5  and h@xmath34 ew ( absorption ) = 1.9  ( see poggianti & barbaro 1997 ; miller & owen 2002 ) . then , using the observed ratio of the and  emission lines ( corrected for stellar absorption ) , in conjunction with an attenuation law of @xmath35 ( charlot & fall 2000 ) for galactic extinction and a theoretical to  ratio of 2.87 ( case b recombination ; osterbrock 1989 ) , we solve for @xmath36 in the attenuation law and thus gain extinction  corrected values for both the and emission lines . next , using the theoretical ratio of  emission to emission , we obtain an estimate for the amount of emission  filling ( extinction  corrected ) in the absorption line .",
    "we then correct the observed absorption ew for this emission  filling and , assuming the ew(h@xmath9 ) absorption is equal to ew ( ) absorption and ew ( ) absorption is equal to 1.3 + @xmath37 ew ( ) absorption ( keel 1983 ) , we obtain new estimates for the stellar absorption at the and  emission lines , _",
    "i.e. _ , where we begun the iteration .",
    "we iterate this calculation five times , but on average , a stable solution converges after only one iteration .",
    "our second method uses the d4000 break to estimate the amount of stellar absorption at h@xmath26 , using ew(h@xmath26 ) @xmath38 ( poggianti & barbaro 1997 ; miller & owen 2002 ) .",
    "then , assuming ew ( ) absorption is equal to 1.3 + @xmath37 ew(h@xmath26 ) absorption , we obtain an measurement for the amount of stellar absorption at both the and h@xmath26 absorption lines .",
    "as in the first method above , we use the charlot & fall ( 2000 ) attenuation law , and the theoretical to h@xmath26 ratio , to solve for the amount of extinction at and h@xmath26 , and then use these extinction  corrected emission lines to estimate the amount of emission  filling at .",
    "we do not iterate this method , as we have used the measured d4000 break to independently estimate the amount of stellar absorption at  and .",
    "we have applied these two methods to all our sdss spectra , except for any galaxy that possesses a robust detection of an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) based on the line indices discussed in kewley et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and gomez et al .",
    "( 2003 ) . for these agn classifications",
    ", we have used the spectro1d emission line measurements .",

    "we determine the sigma of the distribution by fitting a gaussian ( as a function of signal  to  noise ) as shown in figures [ fig : err_from_double_obs_hd_gauss_fit ] , [ fig : err_from_double_obs_hd_gauss_fit_oii ] & [ fig : err_from_double_obs_hd_gauss_fit_ha ] , and then use a 3rd order polynomial to interpolate between the signal  to  noise bins , thus obtaining the solid lines shown in figures [ fig : err_from_double_obs_hd ] , [ fig : err_from_double_obs_oii ] & [ fig : err_from_double_obs_ha ] . using these polynomial fits , we can estimate the @xmath40 error on our ews for any signal  to  noise .",

    "<S> we present here a new and homogeneous sample of 3340 galaxies selected from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) based solely on the observed strength of their hydrogen balmer absorption line . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of a strong line within the spectrum of a galaxy indicates that the galaxy has under  gone a significant change in its star formation history within the last gigayear . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , such galaxies have received considerable attention in recent years , as they provide an opportunity to study galaxy evolution _ in action_. these galaxies are commonly known as `` post  starburst '' , `` e+a '' , `` k+a '' and strong galaxies , and the study of these galaxies has been severely hampered by the lack of a large , statistical sample of such galaxies . in this paper , we rectify this problem by selecting a sample of galaxies which possess an absorption equivalent width of @xmath0from 106682 galaxies in the sdss . </S>",
    "<S> we have performed extensive tests on our catalog including comparing different methodologies of measuring the absorption lines and studying the effects of stellar absorption , dust extinction and emission  filling on our measurements . </S>",
    "<S> we have determined the external error on our measurements using duplicate observations of 11538 galaxies in the sdss . </S>",
    "<S> the measured abundance of our selected ( hds ) galaxies is @xmath1% of all galaxies within a volume  limited sample of @xmath2 and m(@xmath3 , which is consistent with previous studies of such galaxies in the literature . </S>",
    "<S> we find that only 25 of our hds galaxies in this volume  limited sample ( @xmath4% ) show no , or little , evidence for and emission lines , thus indicating that true e+a ( or k+a ) galaxies ( as originally defined by dressler & gunn ) are extremely rare objects at low redshift , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ , only @xmath5% of all galaxies in this volume  limited sample are true e+a galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , @xmath6% of our hds galaxies in the volume  limited sample have significant detections of the and emission lines . of these </S>",
    "<S> , only 131 galaxies are robustly classified as active galactic nuclei ( agns ) and therefore , a majority of these emission line hds galaxies are star  forming galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we find that @xmath7% ( 27/52 ) of galaxies in our volume  limited hds sample that possess no detectable emission , do however possess detectable emission lines . </S>",
    "<S> these galaxies may be dusty star  forming galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we provide the community with this new catalog of selected galaxies to aid in the understanding of these galaxies , via detailed follow  up observations , as well as providing a low redshift sample for comparison with higher redshift studies of hds galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we will study the global properties of these galaxies in future papers . </S>"
