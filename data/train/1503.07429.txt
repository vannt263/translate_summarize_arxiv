    "coulomb interactions can be screened to some intent by the low - energy fermions near double - weyl points .",
    "the screening effect by low - energy electrons is given by the boson s self - energy appeared in rg analysis . implementing random phase approximation ( rpa ) , we shall consider only one loop diagram , which is first order quantum correction to boson self - energy ( see next section ) : ( p ) & = & g^2 + & = & 4g^2 _ k ,   where @xmath106 , @xmath107 , and @xmath108 , @xmath109 . at this rate ,",

    "it is worth to point out that @xmath26 flows to zero at infrared even though the bare value of @xmath150 is close to one because of isotropic coulomb interaction in the ultraviolet .",
    "this is qualitatively consistent with rpa calculations that low - energy double - weyl fermions screen the coulomb interactions in an anisotropic way . for simplicity",

    "since @xmath152 describes the strength of coulomb interaction , we conclude that coulomb interaction is marginally irrelevant in the infrared limit , which gives rise to logarithmic corrections to physical quantities as we mentioned in the main text . for the stable fixed point , because @xmath153 the scaling properties of spatial coordinates are same at the tree level , namely , @xmath154 at the fixed point .",

    "so , induced charge density in real space is @xmath167 .",
    "since coulomb interaction is marginally irrelevant at the stable fixed point , we expect logarithmic corrections to physical quantities . here",
    ", we specifically calculate how specific heat of double - weyl fermions are affected by coulomb interactions in low temperature .",
    "corrections to other measurable quantities may be obtained similarly by taking account of scaling hypothesis near the fixed point as well as the flow of coupling constants . according to scaling hypothesis , free energy density scales as @xmath168 , where @xmath169 and @xmath79 are scaling exponent of coordinates along @xmath110 ( or @xmath170 ) and @xmath9 directions respectively . as a result",

    "near the fixed point , @xmath142 and @xmath173 ( see the preceding section of this appendix for details ) .",
    "because @xmath41 is magically irrelevant and @xmath45 is irrelevant near the stable fixed point , the rg flow along @xmath45 direction is much faster than that along @xmath41 direction .",
    "this is obviously seen in fig .",
    "2(b ) of the main text .",
    "as logarithmic correction is caused by marginal flow of @xmath41 , we can set @xmath174 in the following calculations as a good approximation . for @xmath41 close to @xmath153",
    ", we obtain the asymptotic behavior of @xmath144 and @xmath145 : g_1&&- , [ g1 ] + g_2&&-c_1-,[g2 ] where @xmath175 is a positive constant .",

    "the deviation of specific heat from the usual fermi liquid behavior is apparent : c(t ) & & t^2 + & = & , [ specific_heat_1 ] the exponential factor in the last line of eq .",

    "<S> so , without loss of generality , we assume that scaling dimensions are given by @xmath34=-z_3,[x_1,x_2]=-z_1,[t]=-1 $ ] . in the following rg analysis , we integrate out the degree of freedoms in a momentum shell of @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the flow parameter , @xmath37 is the ultraviolet energy cutoff , and @xmath38 which is the energy of double - weyl fermions . </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize that momentum shell of this kind correctly includes the high - energy degrees of freedom which effect the low - energy physics . from the various coupling constants in the action , </S>",
    "<S> we construct two dimensionless coupling constants that will be useful to characterize the rg flow : @xmath39 and @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> note that the dimensionless parameter @xmath41 , which has the form of a fine - structure constant , characterizes the strength of coulomb interactions .       </S>",
    "<S> we outline the main results of rg analysis here and provide calculational details in appendix . </S>",
    "<S> we choose @xmath42 and @xmath43 such that the physical quantities @xmath12 and @xmath44 characterizing the dispersion of double - weyl fermions are finite at the fixed point </S>",
    "<S> . then , we can use only two parameters @xmath41 and @xmath45 to depict the full rg flow . by iterating the rg equations </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain the rg flow of @xmath41 and @xmath45 , as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ rg_flow](b ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that there are only two fixed points : @xmath46 is the unstable fixed point of noninteracting double - weyl fermions while @xmath47 is the stable one . near the fixed points , </S>",
    "<S> the rg equations to the lowest order of @xmath41 and @xmath45 are given by & = & - ^2 , + & = & ( 1-+ ) , from which it is apparent that the coulomb interaction characterized by @xmath41 is marginally irrelevant close to the stable fixed point of @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> it is known that marginally irrelevant interactions will give rise to logarithmic corrections to physical quantities in low energy or low temperature . </S>",
    "<S> besides being marginally irrelevant , coulomb interaction becomes infinitely anisotropic due to the screening of anisotropic gapless double - weyl fermions , namely , @xmath49 in the infrared . </S>",
    "<S> this phenomenon is captured by the particle - hole polarization , p_^2+p_z^2-(p ) ~p_^2(1+l ) + p_z^2(1+l ) . at the stable fixed point @xmath47 </S>",
    "<S> , we find that boson kinetic energy in the @xmath27 plane gets no qualitative renormalization , while it is strongly renormalized along the @xmath9 axis . </S>",
    "<S> this renormalization can be understood as anomalous dimensions , ^2-(p ) & = & p_x^2+p_y^2+p_z^2[1 + ] + & ~ & p_x^2+p_y^2+|p_z| . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , the coulomb potential is renormalized to be @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> this result is qualitatively consistent with the one from the rpa calculation in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ rpa_potential ] ) , which we believe further shows that the divergent anisotropic screening of the coulomb interaction is correct .    * </S>",
    "<S> screening of a coulomb impurity : * we expect that the anisotropic dispersion of double - weyl fermions can cause the unusual feature of induced charge density of a coulomb impurity , which interacts with the double - weyl fermions through usual coulomb potential proportional to @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> we shall consider both the case of noninteracting double - weyl fermions and of coulomb - interacting double - weyl fermions . for noninteracting double - weyl fermions , a coulomb impurity causes a divergent distribution of density of induced charges , while for coulomb </S>",
    "<S> - interacting double - weyl fermions , the induced charge distribution is instead a simple @xmath51 function located around the impurity . </S>",
    "<S> this @xmath51 function feature of induced charge density is caused by effective screening of the coulomb interactions by double - weyl fermions .    to be specific , we consider an impurity of charge @xmath52 located at the origin , where @xmath53 is an integer constant . for noninteracting double - weyl fermions , this impurity generates a bare coulomb potential to them , namely , @xmath54 , where @xmath55 characterizes the coulomb interaction between the impurity and the double - weyl fermions . </S>",
    "<S> then , the density of induced charges is given by @xmath56 , where @xmath57 , with @xmath58 being the particle - hole polarization which we assume , without loss of generality , to be @xmath59 according to rpa calculations . </S>",
    "<S> the anomalous characteristic of charge distribution can be seen from partially induced charge densities , i.e. , @xmath60 and @xmath61 with @xmath62 and @xmath63 . </S>",
    "<S> note that partially induced charge density @xmath64 above is divergent at the long - wavelength limit , which arises because of the particular dispersion of noninteracting double - weyl fermions . </S>",
    "<S> such singularity does not appear when we consider coulomb interactions in the double - weyl fermions .    for the interacting case , </S>",
    "<S> the coulomb interaction is renormalized as @xmath65 , where we have rescaled momentum to make the parameters look simpler . </S>",
    "<S> the induced charge density is now given by ( q)&= & ze v(q ) ( = 0,q ) + & = & - , from which we can compute @xmath66 and @xmath67 . furthermore , @xmath68 requires that @xmath69 ( see appendix ) . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , we obtain @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is a constant of order one . </S>",
    "<S> it is now clear that @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the usual @xmath51 function . </S>",
    "<S> this feature is similar to the induced charge discussed in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , though the coulomb interaction there is irrelevant .    </S>",
    "<S> * logarithmic corrections to specific heat : * since the coulomb interaction is marginally irrelevant at the nontrivial stable fixed point of @xmath48 , measurable physical quantities will receive logarithmic corrections , which originate from the logarithmic behavior of the coupling constant under rg flow . </S>",
    "<S> more specifically , consider the fine - structure constant as a function of energy scale @xmath74 , @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the bare fine - structure constant and @xmath37 is the ultraviolet energy cutoff . </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that as the energy / temperature decrease , the interaction strength becomes weaker in a logarithmic manner . </S>",
    "<S> one would expect that this feature shall bring logarithmic corrections to various physical quantities .    </S>",
    "<S> near the fixed point , the free - energy density scales as @xmath77 , where @xmath78 and @xmath79 are scaling dimensions of the @xmath27 coordinates and @xmath9 coordinate , respectively@xcite . for the specific heat @xmath80 </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain @xmath81 </S>",
    "<S> . remember that we have set the scaling dimension of time to be one , while allowing @xmath79 to flow . as discussed earlier </S>",
    "<S> , close to the fixed point , we choose @xmath82 and @xmath83 , where @xmath84 , such that the mass @xmath12 and fermi velocity @xmath44 in the dispersion of double - weyl fermions remain fixed . taking account of the logarithmic flow of fine - structure constant @xmath41 , the specific heat at low temperature ( for details see appendix ) is given by c(t ) & & + & & ,  [ second ] where @xmath85 . </S>",
    "<S> the first line is the usual logarithmic correction to specific heat found in much of the literature . </S>",
    "<S> however , the second line in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ second ] ) , which actually dominates at low energy , is a different phenomenon that we find for double - weyl fermions with marginally irrelevant coulomb interactions . </S>",
    "<S> it decays faster than the usual logarithmic correction , which indicates that this marginal phenomenon deviates from fermi liquid in a more radical way and may be tested in future measurements of hgcr@xmath0se@xmath1 and srsi@xmath0 at low enough temperature . </S>",
    "<S> it is crucial for the fermi level to be at the double - weyl points to observe the above logarithmic behavior of specific heat ( see appendix for a schematic specific heat curve ) . </S>",
    "<S> an interesting specific heat measurements in hgcr@xmath0se@xmath1 was reported recently@xcite . however , because the fermi level in the measured material deviates from double - weyl points , electron contribution to the specific heat does not show the logarithmic correction in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ second ] ) . to possibly see the logarithmic corrections , it is desired to experimentally tune the fermi level to the double - weyl points in these candidate materials in the future . </S>",
    "<S> as discussed in appendix , this unusual logarithmic correction is caused by the logarithmic term in the rg equations close to the fixed points . </S>",
    "<S> logarithmic terms also appear in rg equations describing certain quantum criticality such as nematic quantum critical points in nodal @xmath86-wave superconductors@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> * discussions : * so far , we have considered a minimal model with only two double - weyl points , e.g. in hgcr@xmath0se@xmath1 , interacting through coulomb interactions . for such systems including hgcr@xmath0se@xmath1 , </S>",
    "<S> the coulomb interactions are screened anisotropically : the screened coulomb potential is qualitatively unchanged along the @xmath9 axis , i.e. , @xmath32 but behaves as @xmath33 in the @xmath27 plane , which decays qualitatively faster because of screening by the low - lying quadratic fermions in the @xmath27 plane . in a material that possesses many double - weyl nodes along various directions , </S>",
    "<S> e.g. , in the predicted candidate material srsi@xmath0 , one needs to take into account the contributions to particle - hole polarization from all double - weyl fermions while the interactions between different double - weyl fermions can still be neglected as long as we care about low - energy and long - wavelength physics , namely , @xmath87 , where @xmath88 ranges over all double - weyl points . </S>",
    "<S> in general , there is no special spatial direction when many double - weyl points are present . </S>",
    "<S> thus , by averaging , we expect @xmath89 . in other words , </S>",
    "<S> the screened coulomb potential has the form @xmath90 , where @xmath91 . in real space </S>",
    "<S> , it behaves like @xmath92 , where @xmath93 is a bessel function of the first kind and @xmath94 is of the order of the lattice constant . for @xmath95 , @xmath96 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the coulomb potential is modified to be @xmath97 .    </S>",
    "<S> to conclude , in this work , we explored the fate of double - weyl semimetals in the presence of long - range coulomb interaction . instead of being screened to be short ranged , the coulomb interaction is marginally irrelevant at low energy . at the infrared stable fixed point , </S>",
    "<S> the coulomb potential is strongly anisotropic , which is qualitatively different from the noninteracting gaussian fixed point . </S>",
    "<S> because of the marginal irrelevance of coulomb interactions at the stable fixed point , physical quantities received logarithmic corrections in low energy or in low temperature . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , we find that the specific heat features an exotic logarithmic correction , deviating from the usual fermi liquid , which originates from the interplay of anisotropic double - weyl fermions and the bare isotropic interactions between them .    _ acknowledgement _ : we would like to thank xin dai for helpful discussions . </S>",
