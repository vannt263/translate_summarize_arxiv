    "method developments , the existence of user friendly distributed codes and the ever increasing computer power are making the calculation of band - structures , for even relatively complex materials , more and more straight forward .",
    "as several properties can be calculated from the energy bands and their derivatives , the usefulness off a generally applicable , easily portable and documented code for analysis of the bands should be clear .",
    "the code presented here relies on a fourier expansion of the band energies where the space group symmetry is maintained by using star functions .",
    "the idea of the fourier expansion is to use more star functions than band energies , but to constrain the fit so that the extrapolated energies are exactly equal to the calculated band - energies and use the additional freedom to minimize a roughness function and thereby suppress oscillations between the data - points.@xcite using the analytical representation of the bands it is then a reasonable simple procedure to calculate band - structure dependent quantities .",
    "the method has been tested for several applications based on boltzmann theory , including the transport coefficients of intermetallic compounds,@xcite high @xmath0 superconductors@xcite and thermoelectrics.@xcite furthermore the present code has already been applied to calculate the transport coefficients in a series of different clathrate structures@xcite and a very good agreement was found with experimental values.@xcite the good agreement was also found for the demanding hall coefficient that depends on the second derivative of the bands.@xcite    because of the known limitations of boltzmann theory@xcite the comparison with experimental measurements is not the best method for testing the actual algorithm for expanding the bands . as the interpolated bands pass exactly though the calculated band energies , the precision of the present method is mainly limited by possible band crossings where the band derivatives will be calculated wrongly .",
    "we will therefore test our method by comparing with the resent results by scheidemantel et al.@xcite .",
    "scheidemantel et al . calculated transport coefficients of bi@xmath1te@xmath2@xcite by calculating the group velocities from the momentum matrix elements .",
    "as the momentum matrix elements can be calculated directly from the wavefunction,@xcite their method should avoid any problems at band crossings.@xcite as the calculations were documented in detail@xcite and bi@xmath1te@xmath2 has a complex band - structure that is strongly influenced by spin orbit coupling , it constitutes a challenging test - case which we will use in the present paper .",

    "is minimized , the algorithm needs sufficient freedom .",
    "this means that the number of planewaves must be larger than the number of band energies .",

    "however , band crossings only happen on symmetry lines ( symmetry planes in hexagonal systems ) , so , while the problem exists , as long as the @xmath26-sampling is dense enough to keep the error localized at the crossing it will have little effect on global quantities like transport .",
