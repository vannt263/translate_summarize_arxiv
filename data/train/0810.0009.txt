    "supernova remnants ( snrs ) are a diverse class of objects that play an essential role in the dynamics of the interstellar medium ( ism ) and that produce and distribute most of the metals in the universe @xcite .",
    "since its launch , the _ chandra _ x - ray telescope has observed over one - hundred snrs in the milky way galaxy @xcite . the sub - arcsecond spatial resolution and spectro - imaging capabilities of _ chandra _ have facilitated detailed studies of the metal - rich ejecta from supernova explosions as well as the interactions with their environments as they expand ( see weisskopf & hughes 2006 for a review ) .",
    "_ chandra _ has revealed that x - ray spectral and spatial morphologies of snrs are extremely complex .",
    "however , no systematic , quantitative methods for comparison within and between snrs have been applied to develop a global picture of these varied sources .",
    "rigorous mathematical techniques are necessary to maximally utilize these _ chandra _ datasets . toward this end",
    ", we apply well - estalished tools to characterize the x - ray morphologies of snrs .",
    "we present three methods especially suited for application to _ chandra _ advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) observations : a multipole power - ratio technique to probe morphological symmetry , correlation - length analysis ( an adaptation of two - point correlation ) to measure chemical segregation and distribution , and wavelet - transform analysis to quantify substructure .",
    "these methods have been used previously in other astronomical contexts , and we have extended and further developed them for snr science . in @xmath22 , we describe the methods in detail and demonstrate their application to synthetic data of extended sources . in @xmath23 , we apply these techniques to the 55-ks _ chandra _ acis observation of w49b , a snr with a particularly complex spatial distribution . in @xmath24 , we discuss how the results can be used to discern between the heating and explosion properties of the source .",
    "we present our concluding remarks in @xmath25 .",
    "w49b ( g43.3@xmath30.2 ) is a principal example of a galactic snr with complex x - ray morphology .",
    "it is the brightest ejecta - dominated snr in x - rays ( @xmath4 erg s@xmath5 ; immler & kuntz 2005 ) , and it has one of the highest surface brightnesses at 1 ghz of all galactic sources @xcite .",
    "radio maps of the source show w49b has a prominent shell structure @xmath64  in diameter , yet it has a center - filled morphology in the x - rays .",
    "hi absorption measurements indicate the remnant is 8@xmath72 kpc away @xcite , and due to its distance through the galactic plane , no optical emission is detected from the source .",
    "a recent _ spitzer _ study of snrs in the galactic plane observed filamentary structure of infrared line emission in w49b from both shocked ionic and molecular gas @xcite .",
    "w49b was first detected in x - rays by the _ einstein observatory _ @xcite .",
    "an _ exosat _",
    "observation soon after revealed intense iron line emission from the source .",
    "_ asca _ spectra confirmed the high abundances of several metals in w49b @xcite , and the emission was described best by two distinct thermal components of optically - thin plasma .",
    "given the remnant s relatively young age ( pye et al .",
    "1984 ; smith et al .",
    "1985 ) , the line emission was attributed primarily to the ejecta from the progenitor star .",
    "recent high - resolution x - ray images ( see figure  [ fig : three ] ) and spectra from _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _  @xcite have shown that the metals have remarkable spatial distributions .",
    "the emission is elongated in a centrally - bright bar that is enriched in iron and nickel and has two plumes at its eastern and western edges that are perpendicular to the axis of this bar .",
    "the eastern part of the remnant terminates sharply , while the western portion of w49b is remarkably diffuse .",
    "additionally , the western regions have weak iron emission , whereas the lower-@xmath8 elements have significant emission in these areas @xcite .",
    "two potential scenarios may account for the complex morphology of w49b ( miceli et al .",
    "2006 , 2008 ; keohane et al .",
    "the high - metallicity and barrel - shaped morphology could be signatures of a bipolar explosion ( possibly a hypernova ) of a massive star .",
    "conversely , a complex environment around a typical , symmetric supernova explosion could give rise to inhomogeneous heating to x - ray emitting temperatures .",
    "the latter is an appealing model as it is a commonly observed phenomenon ( e.g. , snr g292.08 + 1.8 : park et al .",
    "however , this scenario would require unrealistic ejecta masses @xcite .",
    "the bipolar origin of w49b is problematic as well because the predicted rate of such events is only 1 per @xmath9 years per galaxy @xcite .",
    "thus , it is uncertain presently which scenario is the correct interpretation of w49b s exotic shape .    in order to break the degeneracy of environment versus explosion effects",
    ", quantitative methods can be applied to the existing data .",
    "the _ chandra _",
    "images of w49b contain a wealth of physical information that can be extracted using appropriate mathematical anaylses .",
    "measurement of elemental segregation and mixing are important clues to explosion and evolution histories .",
    "additionally , a rigorous description of x - ray substructure enables much more reliable estimates of elemental abundances and temperature variations than any previous work .",
    "together , these calculations can distinguish the correct interpretation of asymmetries ( anisotropic ejection or heating inhomogeneities ) , one of the biggest outstanding questions in snr studies today @xcite .",
    "the anomalous spatial distribution and substructure of w49b make it an ideal source to test our methods .",
    "we aim to define quantitatively the spatial and spectral features of w49b as a means to extract physical insights about this enigmatic source .",
    "in this section , we describe the techniques that can be used to quantify x - ray morphology of extended sources .",
    "we present their mathematical formalism as well as examples of their application to synthetic data .",
    "the power - ratio method ( prm ) was developed initially to quantify the x - ray morphology of galaxy clusters observed with _",
    "rosat _ as a probe of their dynamical states ( buote & tsai , 1995 , 1996 ) . the technique was extended to _",
    "chandra _ observations to measure the evolution of cluster morphology as a function of redshift @xcite .",
    "the prm measures sensitively asymmetries in an image via calculation of the multipole moments of the x - ray surface brightness in a circular aperture .",
    "we present an overview of this technique below , and we refer the reader to the above papers for the rigorous details and examples of its application to synthetic data and x - ray observations .    the prm is derived similarly to the multipole expansion of the two - dimensional gravitational potential interior to radius @xmath10 :    @xmath11    where the moments @xmath12 and @xmath13 are @xmath14    @xmath15 , and @xmath16 is the surface mass density . for our imaging analyses ,",
    "the x - ray surface brightness replaces surface mass density in the power ratio calculation .",
    "the powers of the multipole expansion are obtained by integrating the magnitude of @xmath17 ( the _ _",
    "m__th term in the multipole expansion of the potential ) over a circle of radius @xmath10 ,    @xmath18    ignoring the factor of @xmath19 , this equation reduces to    @xmath20 ^ 2 \\nonumber\\ ] ]    @xmath21    the moments @xmath22 and @xmath23 ( and consequently , the powers @xmath24 ) are sensitive to asymmetry in the x - ray surface brightness distribution , and the higher - order terms measure asymmetries at successively smaller scales relative to the remnant size . to normalize with respect to flux , we divide the powers by @xmath25 to form the power ratios , @xmath26 .",
    "@xmath27 approaches zero when the aperture is centered on the centroid of an image , so we have set the origin in all analyses to the centroid of each individual image . in this case ,",
    "morphological information is given by the higher - order terms @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 .",
    "the quadrupole power @xmath31 is sensitive to the ellipticity of a source .",
    "the moment @xmath32 measures deviations from mirror symmetry ( such as triangular morphology ) , and it is not affected by mirror - symmetrical features .",
    "the power @xmath33 is correlated with @xmath31 but is more sensitive to smaller - scale structure than @xmath31 .",
    "thus , the power ratios provide complementary measures of x - ray morphology in extended sources .      two - point correlation has been applied to measure galaxy clustering ( e.g. , davis & peebles 1983 ) as well as to map the anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background ( e.g. , kogut et al .",
    "we have adapted this method to characterize spatial distribution and segregation between elements in an x - ray source , and we call our modified technique correlation - length analysis ( cla )",
    ".    cla measures essentially whether two images have statistically similar spatial distributions .",
    "we define the correlation length of each pixel in one image as the minimum distance ( @xmath340 pixels ) to another pixel of equal intensity in a second image .",
    "the two images are normalized to have the same maximum intensity , and pixel values are rounded to give integer counts throughout the images .",
    "we calculate the correlation length for each pixel , and we create maps of these values to identify regions with and without particular emission features .    additionally , we determine whether two images have similar overall spatial distributions by calculating the difference between the cumulative distributions of their correlation lengths to the cumulative distributions of each of their auto - correlations .",
    "if the two images have distinct spatial distributions , the correlation lengths between them will be disparate from those of their auto - correlations .",
    "thus , the difference in the trends of correlation length values provides a measurement of the similarity of two images .",
    "we perform auto - correlations on mock images produced via a monte carlo approach to estimate the uncertainty of the calculation .",
    "we test the utility of cla by applying the method to three groups of ten synthetic images ( figure  [ fig : examplecl ] has examples and a mathematical description of the datasets ) .",
    "groups 1 and 2 have similar distributions and represent auto - correlations , while group 3 reflects comparison of disjoint distributions .",
    "we performed cla on every combination ( ninety different pairings ) of the ten images within each group and produced the three mean correlation - length cdfs and their 1-@xmath35 ranges shown in figure  [ fig : cl ] .    to determine whether the size of substructure influences cla results , groups 1 and 2 have clumps at fixed location but with scales selected from gaussian distributions of different variance : the clump - size distribution of group 2 has @xmath36 larger variance than that of group 1 . comparing their resulting cdfs , we find that the confidence ranges overlap for these datasets , with an average separation of 0.5@xmath35 .",
    "thus , images in groups 1 and 2 have statistically similar spatial distributions , indicating that clump - size variation does not hinder cla from distinguishing homogeneous populations .    to ascertain how clump position affects cla results , clump locations of group 3 datasets",
    "were selected randomly while the clump sizes did not vary much ( with 11% of the group 1 variance ) . in this case , many pixels have large correlation lengths , so the group 3 cdf is very disparate from those of groups 1 and 2 with average separations of 3.1@xmath35 and 2.7@xmath35 , respectively . thus , group 3 has a statistically distinct spatial distribution from groups 1 and 2 , and we conclude that cla is a good measure of whether substructures have similar locations . therefore , cla is well - suited to compare morphologies within and between extended sources .",
    "wavelet - transform analysis ( wta ) was applied successfully to _ rosat _ and _ einstein _ data to extract small - scale x - ray structure of galaxy clusters @xcite . with the superior spatial resolution of _ chandra",
    "_ , this technique can be extended to characterize precisely the size and distribution of emitting regions in x - ray sources .",
    "a wavelet basis enables scale as well as spatial localization , thus wta can identify substructure , its extent , and its position .",
    "a wavelet - transformed image is a decomposed image of a signal s intensity ( from herein , power ) measured at the scale of a filter size .",
    "mathematically , a wavelet transform @xmath37 is the correlation of a signal @xmath38 in an image with the analyzing wavelet function @xmath39 :    @xmath40    where @xmath41 is the scale ( or width ) of the wavelet transform . for astronomical images ,",
    "a radial mexican - hat function ( the normalized second derivative of a gaussian function ) is the optimal wavelet to use because of its similar shape to gaussian signals and it removes flat features ( like diffuse emission ) since it has a zero mean @xcite . in the analysis that follows , we use a radial mexican - hat wavelet @xmath42 of the form    @xmath43    wavelet - transformed images are produced by calculating @xmath44 for each pixel @xmath45 in a raw ]    where @xmath46 is the number of counts in the ( @xmath47 ) pixel . if we assume the number of counts in a given pixel is independent of the counts in nearby pixels , we can use poisson statistics to calculate the variance @xmath48 of @xmath49 :    @xmath50    where @xmath51 is the variance of @xmath46 in the @xmath52 pixel of a raw image .",
    "essentially , @xmath37 measures the summed intensity enclosed by the area of the mexican hat .",
    "thus , the size of an individual source can be characterized by the scale where the convolution of the wavelet and a signal reaches a maximum . to exemplify this point mathematically",
    ", we assume that a source has an isotropic gaussian shape with signal @xmath53 given by    @xmath54,\\ ] ]    where @xmath55 is the intensity of the source located at @xmath56 . using eq . 5 and eq .",
    "6 , the wavelet coefficient @xmath57 at this position is    @xmath58    if we divide eq . 10 by @xmath41",
    ", we find that    @xmath59    eq .",
    "11 has a global maximum at @xmath60 = @xmath35 .",
    "consequently , by identifying the peak @xmath61 value at the central pixel of an emitting region , we measure its characteristic size .      to demonstrate the utility of wta for astronomical images , we apply the method to relevant synthetic datasets .",
    "we begin by using wta to extract the size of a single two - dimensional gaussian function ( from herein , a clump ) with a width @xmath35 .",
    "figure  [ fig : gauss]a shows this synthetic data , and figure  [ fig : gauss]b gives the plot of @xmath61 versus @xmath41 ( intensity per unit area as a function of scale ; from herein , wta plot ) for the central pixel of the clump .",
    "larger @xmath61 values correspond to more power emitted at the given scales , so local and absolute maxima indicate the size of emitting regions .",
    "indeed , the peak @xmath60 of the wta plot occurs at the exact value of @xmath35 .",
    "therefore , the method can measure accurately the size of an individual emitting region or substructure .    by applying wta to all the pixels in an image and summing their results for each scale",
    ", the method can be utilized to calculate the intensity profile of an entire extended source . as an example , we have applied wta to all pixels in three synthetic datasets with randomly - distributed clumps of equal width ( figure  [ fig : nsigma ] , left ) . the number of clumps in these images are varied to demonstrate the effects of increased emitting surface area , or filling factor .",
    "figure  [ fig : nsigma ] ( right ; solid lines ) displays the averaged wta plot ( @xmath62 versus @xmath41 ) for the three datasets .",
    "the curves have similar shape as figure  [ fig : gauss ] , and increased @xmath62 values correspond to more power emitted at a particular scale over an entire image . as the number of clumps increases and",
    "they overlap , larger agglomerates are formed .",
    "this effect increases the surface area of contiguous emitting regions , and the amount of power measured at large scales to rise .",
    "thus , increased numbers of clumps shift the peak @xmath60 to higher values , and the turnover in @xmath62 becomes less prominent .    in images with many clumps , we can measure the scale of isolated structures using the wta plot for their central pixels . however , larger filling factors cause individual clumps to agglomerate , and the number of segregated structures decrease as a result . in figure  [ fig : nsigma ] ( right ; dashed lines ) , we plot the averaged wta plot for the individually identified clumps in the three synthetic datasets of randomly - distributed clumps of equal width ( figure  [ fig : nsigma ] , left ) .",
    "we define the centroid of individual clumps as the locations with local maxima in @xmath61 separated at least three pixels from another local maximum . in all cases , the algorithm successfully reproduces the scale of the isolated structures . generally , our ability to identify individual clumps decreases with greater emitting surface area ( see figure  [ fig : nsigma ] ) .",
    "consequently , wta probes an extended source s filling factor as well as the size of its individual emitting regions .",
    "real astronomical images have noise that will naturally influence these wta results . to investigate the effects of noise ,",
    "first we apply our techniques to synthetic data of pure noise ( figure  [ fig : purenoise ] , left ) . the noise intensity in each pixel",
    "was selected from a poisson distribution .",
    "figure  [ fig : purenoise ] ( right ) shows the resulting averaged wta plot ; the absolute maximum of the wta curve is at @xmath41 = 1 pixel .",
    "since the noise is distributed on a pixel - by - pixel basis , it is natural that the most power is emitted at the single - pixel scale .",
    "we then add the pure noise ( figure  [ fig : purenoise ] , left ) to synthetic data of randomly - distributed clumps to simulate realistic images of an extended astronomical source .",
    "clump sizes were selected from gaussian distributions , and images were produced using different variances in the clump - size distribution to investigate the effects of substructure on wta results .",
    "we calculate the averaged wta plot for the datasets ; two example images and their results are shown in figure  [ fig : npd ] .",
    "all curves have global maxima at @xmath63 pixel since the noise is dominant .",
    "however , we can reduce its contribution by ignoring all pixels with global maxima at the smallest scales . using this approach , the global maxima shift toward the scale of mean clump size since the most power resides there when noise is excluded .",
    "we determine that the variance in clump size did not alter the wta results either : the intensity profile is similar regardless of how divergent individual clumps are from the average scale .",
    "instrumental effects may alter wta results : in particular , an image s resolution is limited by the point - spread function ( psf ) of the detector . to investigate how an instrument s psf changes the scale where most power is emitted",
    ", we convolved the data in figure  [ fig : npd]a with gaussian functions and then add noise .",
    "the resulting four images are shown in figure  [ fig : convolve ] , along with their averaged wta plot . generally , the convolution did not influence the intensity profile measurement .",
    "we find that the results are unaffected for all psfs 60% or less of their scale , and the maxima in the wta plot increase with psfs larger than this fraction .",
    "based on the results from the synthetic data presented above , we conclude that wta is a useful technique to extract the individual sizes of emitting regions and to measure a source s filling factor , an important geometric parameter .",
    "noise increases the power extracted at the smallest scales , but we can limit this contribution by ignoring pixels with global maxima of a single pixel .",
    "generally , large variation in clump sizes does not reduce the accuracy in determining their intensity profiles , and wta measures the various emitting regions scales necessary to produce a given surface brightness .",
    "thus , wta is a useful tool to probe the substructure of extended sources , such as supernova remnants .",
    "although the methods are successful on these synthetic data , the techniques have uncertainties and limitations that should be considered .",
    "the power - ratio method necessitates an accurate determination of an image s centroid ; this calculation requires a source to have a minimum flux and minimum signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) . as shown by @xcite , circular apertures with greater than 500 net counts and s / n greater than 3.0",
    "are sufficient to locate the centroid for unbinned _ chandra _ data .",
    "furthermore , to obtain accurate net moments of extended sources , a few criteria should be satisfied : point sources must be removed , the background moment must be much less than the source moment , and the source must fit entirely on the detector . @xcite",
    "also notes that low s / n images with highly symmetric / circular sources will have systematically higher power ratios due to noise .",
    "a monte carlo approach can be employed to estimate the uncertainty associated with noise ( as described in @xmath23.2 ) .    in the case of the cla",
    ", the primary limitation is associated with the normalization of the two images to have maximum equal intensity .",
    "if the images have very disparate s / n , the normalization procedure will alter the relative quality of the images .",
    "namely , if the maximum intensity of the high s / n image is scaled down to match that of the low s / n image , weaker features in the high s / n image would be removed artificially and thus ignored in the cla results .",
    "therefore , the method is best applied to images with similar intensity prior to normalization . as with the prm",
    ", a monte carlo approach can be used to measure the the effects of noise on the resulting cumulative - distribution function ( as described in @xmath23.3 ) .    unlike the other methods ,",
    "noise is not a significant source of uncertainty in wta provided that certain criteria are met .",
    "we have shown in @xmath22.3.2 that we can limit the affects of noise by ignoring pixels with global maxima of a single pixel .",
    "generally , we find that with this procedure , the averaged wta plot is roughly independent of s / n for s / n @xmath34 2.0 as long as @xmath64 is much greater than 1 pixel ( @xmath64 @xmath34 8 pixels ) . if emitting regions have s / n and @xmath64 below these values , a monte carlo approach can be employed to estimate the uncertainty introduced by noise .    for wta ,",
    "the principal limitation arises from increased filling factor . in @xmath22.3.2",
    ", we demonstrated that our ability to identify individual clumps diminishes with greater filling factor ( see figure  [ fig : nsigma ] ) .",
    "the reason for this difficulty is that when clumps agglomerate into larger structures , it becomes challenging to distinguish the central pixel of that emitting region .",
    "thus , isolated clumps in sources with low filling factors are the best candidates for wta to measure indiviudual clump sizes .",
    "large filling factors negatively influence the averaged wta results as well : the turnover in the averaged wta plot becomes less prominent with increased emitting surface area in an extended source .",
    "generally , we find that images with filling factors above @xmath030% do not produce a statistically significant @xmath64 .",
    "in the subsequent sections , we demonstrate the application of the three techniques of @xmath22 to a particular snr , the galactic remnant w49b .",
    "we analyzed a 55-ks archival _ chandra _ acis observation of w49b ( obsid = 117 ) .",
    "the remnant was observed with the backside - illuminated s3 chip in the timed - exposure faint mode .",
    "data reduction and analysis was performed using the _ chandra _ interactive analysis of observations ( ciao ) version 3.4 .",
    "we followed the ciao data preparation thread to reprocess the level 2 x - ray data : we adjusted the charge transfer inefficiency and time - dependent gain , and we randomized the pha distribution and the event positions .",
    "_ asca _ grade 0 , 2 , 3 , 4 , and 6 events were used in the analysis , and good time intervals were applied .",
    "data below and above were ignored . throughout the paper",
    ", we assume the distance @xmath65 to w49b is @xmath65 = 8 kpc ; this value implies an acis pixel size of 0.492  @xmath6 0.019 pc .",
    "we extracted the global _ chandra _ acis x - ray spectrum of w49b ( shown in figure  [ fig : spectrum ] ) using the ciao command _",
    "specextract _ , and @xmath62.4@xmath6610@xmath67 total counts were detected from the remnant .",
    "the x - ray spectrum is quite complex : it has a thermal bremsstrahlung continuum and numerous emission features .",
    "prominent blends include both he - like ions and the h - like ions of silicon , sulfur , argon , and calcium . additionally , a strong iron line is detected .",
    "modeling of _ xmm - newton _  spectra from w49b suggests at least two plasma components are necessary to adequately fit these diverse emission features since they are produced at different electron temperatures @xcite .",
    "exposure - corrected images of the strong emission features were produced by filtering data to the narrow energy ranges of the prominent emission lines ( as labeled in figure  [ fig : spectrum ] ) : si xiii ( 1.741.93 kev ) , si xiv ( 1.942.05 kev ) , s xv ( 2.252.50 kev ) , s xvi ( 2.522.71 kev ) , ar xvii ( 2.983.21 kev ) , ca xix ( 3.754.0 kev ) , and fe xxv ( 6.46.9 kev ) .",
    "we multiplied all the exposure - corrected images by the maxima of their exposure maps so that every image had units of counts .",
    "the spatial distribution of the elements that produce these lines is inhomogeneous ( figure  [ fig : ions ] gives examples ) .",
    "the iron is much more prominent in the eastern portion of the remnant , while silicon and sulfur are comparatively more symmetric .",
    "additionally , all three ions have discernible x - ray substructure , particularly in the central and western regions where clumping is evident .",
    "the line emission in these images will have contamination from the underlying thermal continuum , and it is necessary to remove this component prior to imaging analyses .",
    "we estimate the flux of the bremsstrahlung and lines by phenomenologically modeling the x - ray spectra from different regions of the remnant .",
    "we find that the relative flux of the thermal emission in the narrow - band images varies by only @xmath05% over the entire source .",
    "for example , bremsstrahlung in the energy range of the si xiii line contributes 3540% of the flux for all regions .",
    "thus , we continuum - subtract the elemental images by reducing the counts in each pixel by the average fraction of flux from the thermal component in that spectral band .",
    "we calculate the power ratios @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 of the continuum - subtracted , exposure - corrected images of the five strongest emission features in the w49b spectrum ( si xiii , s xv , ar xvii , ca xix , and fe xxv ) using the method outlined in @xmath22.1 .",
    "these five images have @xmath0750025000 counts each ; thus , they satisfy the criteria outlined in @xmath22.4 for accurate net moment determinations .",
    "the results are listed in table 1 . for each ion image",
    ", we determined its centroid and calculated the power ratios using a aperture radius that encloses the entire remnant , @xmath68 = 150 . to account for the x - ray background",
    ", we measured the counts per pixel in a circular annulus 155  ",
    "190  from the centroid of each ion image . assuming a constant background , we produced background images for each ion with the same dimensions as the source images by setting every pixel to the extracted count - per - pixel values .",
    "we calculated the moments of the source and of its background separately , and we subtracted the background moments from the source moments to obtain the powers using these net moments .    to estimate the uncertainty in the power ratios , we follow the monte carlo approach employed in the x - ray cluster studies @xcite .",
    "exposure - corrected images ( normalized to have units of counts ) are adaptively - binned using the program _ adaptivebin _ @xcite such that all zero pixels are removed ( corresponding to a minimum of @xmath62 ) to smooth out noise .",
    "then , noise is added back in by taking each pixel intensity as the mean of a poisson distribution and selecting randomly a new intensity from that distribution .",
    "this process was repeated 100 times for each of the five elements , creating 100 mock images per ion .",
    "the 90% confidence limits listed in table 1 were obtained using the fifth highest and fifth lowest power ratios from the 100 mock images of each element .",
    "we find that the power ratios of fe xxv are statistically different than the other elements",
    ". the ratio @xmath28 ( a measure of ellipticity ) of iron is roughly half the values obtained for si xiii , s xv , ar xvii , and ca xix .",
    "similarly , @xmath30 ( a measure of ellipticity on smaller scales than @xmath28 ) of fe xxv is 24 times smaller than the lighter ions .",
    "however , @xmath29 ( a measure of deviations from mirror symmetry ) of fe xxv is a factor of 45 higher than the values of the other ions .",
    "the surface brightness contours of these ions demonstrate the reason for these results ( figure  [ fig : contours ] ) .",
    "the large @xmath28 and @xmath30 of the lighter ions reflect their comparatively elongated distribution relative to fe xxv .",
    "the large @xmath29 of fe xxv arises because of its absence from the western part of the remnant while it has bright substructure in the central and eastern regions of w49b .",
    "the other ions have much smaller @xmath29 values since their distributions are comparatively more balanced in the eastern and western portions of the remnant .",
    "therefore , the morphology of fe xxv is quantitatively less elongated and more asymmetric than the lighter ions .",
    "we perform the correlation - length analysis ( cla ) outlined in @xmath22.2 on images of the five strongest emission lines in the _ chandra _ acis spectrum .",
    "all the ion images have roughly the same maximum pixel intensity ( @xmath05 counts ) prior to normalization , so the limitations of cla discussed in @xmath22.4 do not apply to the w49b data .",
    "we analyzed each combination of the five images and produced their correlation - length maps , with examples shown of the three most prominent lines ( fe xxv , si xiii , and s xv ) in figure  [ fig : ccmaps ] .",
    "we find that all ions are well - mixed throughout the remnant , except for fe xxv which is largely absent from the plumes of the remnant relative to the other ions .",
    "additionally , we produced the correlation - length cumulative - distribution functions shown in figure  [ fig : cdf ] .",

    "this result indicates that si xiii and s xv have the same spatial distribution and are well mixed .",
    "conversely , fe xxv has a very different spatial distribution than si xiii and s xv : the cdfs are very disparate from those of the auto - correlations , with average differences of 4.6@xmath35 from si xiii and 3.7@xmath35 from s xv for correlation lengths under 10 .",
    "thus , the iron is more segregated and disjoint from the other ions , whereas all except fe xxv seem to be well - mixed and similarly distributed throughout the remnant .",

    "consistent with the previous analysis , the fe xxv emission is absent from the western region of the fields , whereas other ions are more symmetrically distributed .    as in the procedures outlined in @xmath22.4.2 , we determine the scale of individual x - ray emitting regions as well as the intensity profile in our acis ion images .",

    "thus , the characteristic sizes of x - ray emitting regions of the low-@xmath8 ions are equal , whereas the scale of fe xxv clumps is greater .",
    "fe xxv contributes much less power at small scales relative to these ions as well : below scales of 15 , fe xxv emits 3060% less power than the other ions .",
    "these results indicate that the x - ray emitting plasma has a characteristic size , and this scale is similar for all ions except for fe xxv in w49b .",

    "the points at the largest scale reflect the size and flux of these emission lines over the entire remnant .",
    "on the small scale , the x - ray fluxes go roughly as the cube of clump size ( i.e. , volume ) .",

    "the line fluxes over the entire remnant are @xmath665100 times less than if they were proportional to volume .",
    "the inverse of these values gives the filling factor of the emission in the remnant : 11.5% .",
    "this small value underscores the importance of considering substructure when using x - ray flux to estimate remnant properties ( such as abundance ratios or elemental masses ) .",
    "from the above analyses , it is obvious that fe xxv has a distinct x - ray morphology . the distribution of fe xxv is more asymmetric than and disjoint from the other ions , and emitting regions of fe xxv are larger than those of the lighter ions .",

    "this process produced the confidence contours plotted in figure  [ fig : cc ] .",

    "the six regions gave best - fit hot plasma temperatures ( corresponding to ) , very close to the values obtained for regions with strong fe xxv emission .",
    "at these electron temperatures , fe xxv should have a prominent line ( see figure [ fig : fe ] ) if iron is abundant there .",
    "however , little - to - no iron is x - ray illuminated in these regions , indicating that the iron is depleted from these parts of the remnant ( with an abundance 1.49@xmath70.88 relative to solar ) .",
    "thus , insufficient heating is not a viable explanation for observed asymmetries , and the anomalous fe xxv distribution must arise from an anistropic ejection of iron .      since we have determined that the asymmetries in w49b result from an anisotropic ejection , we now explore supernova explosions that could lead to the observed fe xxv morphology .",
    "bipolar explosions , a special class of core - collapse supernovae , are highly asymmetric explosions that would distribute heavy metals similarly to those in w49b .",
    "core - collapse supernovae occur when the iron cores of massive stars ( @xmath82 ) collapse to form neutron stars or black holes .",

    "with the number of bipolar explosion / hypernovae candidates growing , the distinguishing properties of these extreme sources are being revealed . in the case of",
    "sn 1998bw , the [ fe ii ] lines were broader than the [ o i ] @xmath84 doublet , indicating that the @xmath85ni ( which decays into iron ) was ejected at larger velocities with respect to the oxygen @xcite .",

    "perpendicular to the rotational axis , mechanical heating decreases ; thus , this phenomenon predicts that lower-@xmath8 elements are ejected more isotropically and at smaller velocities than the nickel ( e.g. , mazzali et al . 2005 ) .",
    "generally , these asymmetries alter the chemical yield of bipolar explosions relative to typical cc sne . while the typical core - collapse event ejects @xmath86 of @xmath85ni , bipolar explosions can have much greater nickel yields that also increase with asphericity , progenitor mass and explosion energy @xcite",

    "the abundance ratios obtained in our spectral fits can be used to constain whether w49b may be the remnant of a core - collapse , bipolar explosion .",
    "@xcite performed similar analyses for the bright , central region of w49b ( circle i in fig .",
    "[ fig : locations ] ) and compared its abundance ratios to aspherical explosion models of extremely metal - poor stars by @xcite . based on low silicon and sulfur abundances",
    "relative to iron , these authors exclude massive progenitors ( @xmath87 25 @xmath1 ) as well as large explosion energies ( @xmath88 erg ) .",
    "this conclusion assumes that the abundances in the central region are reflective of the entire remnant .",
    "however , the iron abundance is greatly enhanced in that location : as listed in table 2 , this area ( circle i ) has the lowest si / fe and s / fe abundance ratios of all twenty - three regions in figure  [ fig : locations ] .",
    "additionally , we have demonstrated in @xmath23 that the iron has statistically different symmetry , distribution , and substructure than the other elements .",
    "this attribute makes it imperative to average over many regions of the remnant to get an accurate representation of the abundance ratios .",
    "however , it is not adequate to estimate abundances from fits to the total spectrum because the central bar dominates the emission , giving uncharacteristicly low values for the lighter elements relative to iron .",
    "for example , the total spectrum gives a si / fe ratio of @xmath00.18 and a s / fe ratio is @xmath00.07 , close to the circle i values .",
    "we also note that the miceli ratios are derived solely from the hot plasma , which affects the accuracy of the silicon abundance determination since it comes mostly from the cool plasma ( as shown in figure  [ fig : si ] ) .",
    "consequently , the miceli estimate of the silicon abundance is low since it does not include the primary heating source for that element .    to obtain an accurate measurement of the global abundance ratios in w49b , we fit the _ xmm _  spectra from the twenty - three regions in figure  [ fig : locations ] , seventeen with strong fe xxv emission and six with depleted fe xxv emission .",
    "we plot the mean abundance ratios of the hot plasma ( since the cool plasma is fixed to solar values ) relative to iron for silicon , sulfur , argon , and calcium in figure  [ fig : abundances ] as well as list their values and 1-@xmath35 errors in table 2 .",
    "the ratios have fairly large dispersions , with all spanning factors of 58 .",
    "this result demonstrates that relative abundances of the elements change throughout the remnant , underscoring the importance of averaging over many regions in this calculation .",
    "we increase the silicon abundances plotted in figure  [ fig : abundances ] by 30% from their table 2 values to account for the contribution of the cool component .",
    "we estimated this factor by re - fitting the regions spectra and fixing all elements of the cool plasma to solar metallicity except the silicon abundance , which was allowed to vary . following this procedure , the combined silicon abundance of the two plasmas was 30% greater than the hot component alone .    in figure",
    "[ fig : abundances ] , we compare our abundance ratios to those predicted by six core - collapse , type ic models : four energetic , spherical explosions @xcite and two aspherical , bipolar explosions ( 25a , 25b : maeda & nomoto 2003 ) .",
    "the aspherical cases have the best agreement with our measured abundance ratios ; both models values are within the 1-@xmath35 range for all elements in the w49b spectrum .",
    "the primary difference between the two aspherical models is their jet opening angles @xmath89 : 25a has @xmath89 = 15@xmath90 and 25b has @xmath89 = 45@xmath90 . for the fixed kinetic energy ,",
    "a larger @xmath89 means less mechanical energy is released per unit solid angle in 25b , causing the explosion to appear less luminous and altering the nucleosynthetic products . despite these distinctions ,",
    "the dispersion in measured abundance ratios for w49b prevents us from discriminating between these two alternatives .",
    "nonetheless , we can exclude the spherical explosion cases based on the silicon and sulfur ratios .",
    "therefore , we find that a bipolar origin with typical or slightly larger kinetic energies of w49b is consistent with its global abundance ratios .      the explosion mechanism can also be constrained by estimating the mass of metals in w49b .",
    "we perform this calculation using the elements filling factor ( as determined by the wta ) and the strength of the emission lines .",
    "appendix b of @xcite summarizes a similar method to find masses of individual regions of a source ; we adapt this technique to the full w49b remnant and account for substructure using wta .",
    "masses are determined based on parameters given in the x - ray spectral fits . for a given electron temperature ,",
    "the flux of an emission line is proportional to its emission measure , @xmath91 , where @xmath92 is the ion number density and @xmath93 is the emitting volume . if @xmath94 is defined as the ratio of electron and ion number densities , @xmath95 , then @xmath92 is given by    @xmath96    where we have set @xmath97 , the volume of a chosen emitting region .",
    "from there , it is simple to derive the ion mass @xmath98 over the remnant :    @xmath99    where @xmath100 is the mass per ion in grams and @xmath101 is the filling factor of the ion s emission over the remnant .",
    "the primary uncertainty in the above mass calculation is the electron number density @xmath72 .",
    "however , since the plasma is in a collisional equilibrium state , we can set a physically motivated lower limit on @xmath72 . by setting @xmath71 to the age of the remnant in equation  [ eq : spitzer ] and setting the electron temperature to the greatest value obtained by our spectral fits ,",

    "our uncertainties are defined by the range of possible @xmath72 , and our values are consistent with the results of @xcite",

    "putting all of these relations together , the filling factor @xmath101 is    @xmath115    thus ,    @xmath116    we use equation [ eq : all ] to calculate the total mass of iron in w49b . from figure",

    "these values give a filling factor @xmath101 = 0.016 , an order of magnitude smaller than previous estimates that were based on assumptions about the extension of the emitting plasma @xcite .",
    "thus , a rigorous measurement of @xmath101 demonstrates that the value is actually much smaller , and iron especially must emit its power in concentrated locations of the remnant .",
    "we find the emission measure of iron @xmath118 by the following procedure .",
    "using the model from @xmath24.1 , we fit the global chandra _ acis _ x - ray spectrum of w49b ( figure  [ fig : spectrum ] ) to obtain the emission measure of the hot - plasma component : @xmath119 = 1.805 @xmath66 10@xmath120 @xmath73 . to compute the emission measure of an individual line @xmath121",
    ", we reduce @xmath119 by the ratio of flux in the line to that of the entire spectrum .",
    "x - ray fluxes are computed using the xspec command _ flux _ over the energy ranges of interest for a phenomenological model of the lines and continuum.based on this procedure , iron contributes 23% of the flux to the hot component , so .",
    "using the equations above , we find an iron mass of @xmath122 @xmath6 0.12 @xmath1 assuming a solar abundance plasma .",
    "for the case of hydrogen mass equal to that of metals , we obtain an iron mass of @xmath122 @xmath6 0.80 @xmath1 .",
    "the condition of a plasma in collisional equilibrium defines the upper - limit iron mass in w49b ( since it gives the minimum @xmath72 necessary to reach cie by the age of the remnant ) : @xmath122 @xmath6 1.29 @xmath1 .",
    "while this range of iron masses is large ( reflecting the uncertainty in electron density ) , masses above 1.29 @xmath1 and below 0.12 @xmath1 can be excluded because it would require physically implausible metal abundances .",
    "furthermore , the large iron mass can not be attributed to a thermonuclear explosion since the abundance ratios relative to iron in figure  [ fig : abundances ] are much greater than those expected from type ia events .",
    "although the derived iron masses are larger than those usually predicted for core - collapse supernovae , the lower limit is close to those values for typical bipolar explosions ( @xmath123 ) . additionally , as noted in @xmath24.2 ,",
    "recent models of bipolar explosions demonstrate that nickel yields ( which decays into iron ) can actually be much greater than the typical core - collapse scenario ( up to 4 @xmath1 ) with increased asphericity , explosion energy , or progenitor mass ( umeda & nomoto 2008 ) .",
    "the anisotropic ejection of iron ( as shown in @xmath24.1 ) and abundance ratios ( given in @xmath24.2 ) in w49b are consistent with such an asymmetric explosion that would overproduce nickel .",
    "generally , we emphasize that this calculation is an order - of - magnitude estimate , and precise measurement of the filling factor is an important step in obtaining a plausible range of masses .",
    "a few factors contribute to the uncertainty in our analyses . as noted previously , the largest source of error is the electron number density since we do not know precisely the plasma s composition .",
    "we attempt to limit this uncertainty by defining a plausible range in its value .",
    "another source of error is the physical modeling of the x - ray spectrum .",
    "while the cie model produces a chi - squared value lower than an nei plasma , it is barely a statistically significant difference ( @xmath010% ) .",
    "however , nei models give abundance ratios within the errors of our cie results , so we expect this uncertainty is minimal .",
    "other sources of error are instrumental in nature : the off - axis point - spread function ( psf ) effects with _",
    "chandra _ and the possible clump contamination with _ xmm - newton _  from its limited spatial resolution .",
    "the psf of _ chandra _ acis increases as a function of energy and of off - axis angle . at its aimpoint ,",
    "the psf is @xmath01  at 1.49 kev and @xmath02  at 6.4 kev ; at a distance 6  off - axis , the psf increases to @xmath03  at 1.49 kev and @xmath05  at 6.4 kev ( where we have characterized the psf as the scale where the encircled energy fraction is 90% ) .",
    "we anticipate that these effects do not alter our results much since the overall extent of w49b is small ( @xmath04  in diameter ) and the characteristic clump sizes of all ions are many factors greater than these values .",
    "we minimize the uncertainty associated with _",
    "xmm - newton _  clump contamination by selecting emitting regions that were sufficiently isolated from other substructure .",
    "the snr mass estimate in this paper is the first with the contribution of substructure rigorously defined .",
    "measurement of ejecta masses requires detailed knowledge about the scale of the emitting regions since emission measure increases linearly with volume .",
    "previous snr studies assume generally that a source s emission is homogeneous ( e.g. , hughes & singh 1994 ) or estimate the filling factor from basic arguments about the plasma s extension ( e.g. , miceli et al .",
    "2006 ) when calculating physical parameters .",
    "however , the complex ion distribution and low filling factor in w49b demonstrates the necessity for more rigorous approaches .",
    "consequently , it is vital to probe accurately the role of substructure when determining global properties of a supernova remnant .",
    "in this paper , we have explored three methods that quantify the morphologies of extended sources . we have demonstrated the accuracy of these techniques on relevant synthetic data , and we have exemplified the utility of these tools by applying them to the chandra _ acis _ observation of the snr w49b .    using a multipole power - ratio technique , we measured the asymmetry of the ion distributions in w49b .",
    "we discovered that the morphology of fe xxv is less elongated and more asymmetric than the lighter ions .",

    "we found that the mean clump scale of fe xxv is roughly 25% larger than those of the lighter ions .",

    ", we determined that the electron temperatures throughout the remnant should heat any iron there to radiate at x - ray temperatures .",
    "thus , iron is strongly depleted from the identified regions , and the distinct x - ray morphology must arise from an anisotropic ejection . therefore ,",
    "any models used to describe the explosion mechanism of w49b must include a means for the iron to be ejected an asymmetric way .",
    "we further constrained the nature of the explosion by measuring the mean abundance ratios of elements in our twenty - three x - ray spectral fits .",
    "the ratios varied tremendously in different locations , demonstrating the importance of averaging the ratios over many regions to obtain the global abundances in w49b .",
    "we found that the mean ratios are consistent with bipolar explosion models of massive stars .",
    "this type of explosion could also account for the anistropic ejection of nickel since heavy elements are preferentially ejected along the polar axis of the progenitor in this scenario .",
    "we calculated the total iron mass in w49b by determining the filling factor ( using our wavelet - transform analysis ) and the emission measure .",
    "we found that the iron mass and abundance ratios are broadly consistent with a core - collapse supernova .",
    "this work is a first attempt to rigorously describe the physical properties of supernova remnants .",
    "snrs play a vital role in our galaxy , and the wealth of data available on these sources is tremendous .",
    "robust methods for comparison within and between these complex targets can advance snr science as well as probe many poorly understood phenomena .",
    "we plan to apply the techniques presented here to other sources to constrain further processes as particle acceleration , interactions with environments , and explosion mechanisms .",
