    "the value of compilation , evaluation and computer storage of neutron cross section data was first recognized in the early 50 s @xcite prompted by the urgent needs of nuclear industry .",
    "these cross sections were summarized in bnl-325 report and evaluated nuclear data file ( endf ) library @xcite . over the years",
    ", the nuclear data activities were extended to all low- and intermediate - energy nuclear physics topics .",
    "computer storage and worldwide dissemination of nuclear data strongly depend on the presently available computer technologies @xcite and data format developments . in present days ,",
    "size and representation of nuclear data files are no longer limited by the computer hardware and software . however , for historic and consistency reasons , nuclear data are still stored in 80-character long formats .    for years , nuclear data research and developments were driven by nuclear science and technology applications .",
    "these developments evolved and lead to the creation of complementary products such as experimental nuclear reaction data ( exfor ) database @xcite .",
    "the overall nuclear data improvements , maturation and modern computer technologies created many new opportunities for nuclear reaction calculations , data mining and analysis . for the capture @xmath0-ray spectroscopy purposes",
    ", we will concentrate on the selected nuclear astrophysics and reactor operation integral quantities that can be extracted from the beta version of endf / b - vii.1@xmath13 library .",
    "current results will be finalized by the end of this year during the public release of endf / b - vii.1 library @xcite .    3 thermal neutron capture cross sections . ]",
    "neutron capture cross sections govern the production of chemical elements in the agb and red giant stars , safe operation of nuclear reactors , serve in nuclear structure measurements , etc .",
    "the low - energy neutron cross section values are often influenced by the contributions from resolved and unresolved resonance regions . to estimate these contributions across the whole endf / b - vii.1 library range of nuclei @xcite and provide additional insights on the data quality for nuclear reactor and astrophysics applications ,",
    "we have selected thermal and maxwellian - averaged cross sections , resonance integrals and westcott factors @xcite for calculation and further analysis .",
    "endf / b - vii.0 @xcite and endf / b - vii.1@xmath13 evaluated neutron cross sections were doppler broadened using the code prepro @xcite with the precision of 0.1% .",
    "these reconstructed and linearized data were used to calculate the selected quantities using the definite java integration method @xcite .    the ratio of thermal @xmath2(n,@xmath0 )",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . using the method of visual inspection we notice the deviations for light and medium nuclei and minor actinides evaluations .",
    "these differences , in the low- and medium - z region , are attributed to the lack of or insufficient experimental data for @xmath3b , @xmath4o , @xmath5ca , @xmath6kr , @xmath7pd , deficiencies for @xmath8co,@xmath9mo and recent re - evaluation of @xmath10zr . while , in the actinide region , deviations are due to new evaluations from the actinoid file @xcite .",
    "neutron capture resonance integrals were calculated for 0.5 ev - 20 mev incident neutron energy range and shown in fig .",
    "[ iq.3 ] .",
    "3 thermal neutron capture resonance integrals . ]",
    "several data outliers in this case could be traced to the lack of measurements and incomplete overlap of experimental and theoretical data for @xmath4o , @xmath11ru , @xmath12ho and @xmath13ca , @xmath8co , @xmath14cs , @xmath15hg , respectively .",
    "however , there are neutron capture cross section deficiencies in the kev region of energies for @xmath16o,@xmath17si and @xmath18pb evaluations .    maxwellian - averaged cross sections play an important role in power reactor developments and slow - neutron capture ( _ s_-process ) nucleosynthesis calculations @xcite .",

    "the detailed analysis of the fig .",
    "[ iq.5 ] data @xcite demonstrates the nuclear astrophysics potential of endf libraries as a complimentary source of evaluated cross sections and reaction rates .    3 maxwellian - averaged cross sections at _ kt_=30 kev . ]",
    "there are noticeable differences between kadonis @xcite and endf / b - vii.1@xmath13 libraries for light and medium nuclei .",
    "@xmath22h deviation is due to differences between center of mass and lab system cross section values . for @xmath23si , @xmath24p , @xmath25ni and @xmath26hg kadonis values",

    "deficiencies in @xmath16o , @xmath33ca and @xmath34s originate from the old or insignificant for integral tests endf evaluations and coverage problems in exfor database @xcite , respectively .    shown in fig .",
    "[ iq.6 ] ratio of capture westcott factors indicate large deviations for @xmath35u and @xmath36lu .    3 libraries .",
    "]    these deviations reflect the changes in endf / b - vii.1@xmath13 library where westcott factors evolved from 3.997 to 0.989 and from 1.002 to 1.711 for @xmath35u and @xmath36lu , respectively .",
    "the last number agrees well with the recommended value of 1.75 @xcite .",
    "smaller deviations as in @xmath37xe are due to adoption of new evaluations in endf / b - vii.1@xmath13 library and lack of experimental data for this nucleus .",
    "the present work demonstrates large potential of endf libraries for capture @xmath0-ray spectroscopy applications .",
    "maxwellian - averaged and thermal capture cross sections , resonance integrals and westcott factors have been extracted from the beta version of endf / b - vii.1@xmath13 library .",
    "these results are important in fundamental science , nuclear technologies and for nuclear data validation .",
    "several @xmath1-version @xmath2(n,@xmath0 ) deficiencies ( @xmath16o , @xmath8co , ... ) will be resolved during the official library release . the new endf / b - vii.1 library @xcite will be publicly available in december of 2011 at the national nuclear data center website _ http://www.nndc.bnl.gov _",
