    "the highest - significant outliers are the first hvs ( hvs1 ) , the four hvss previously discovered in this survey ( hvs4 - hvs7 ) , and a new object : sdss j144955.58 + 310351.4 .",

    ", we would expect to find 3.6 stars with @xmath1 km s@xmath2 and 1.6 stars @xmath56 km s@xmath2 .",
    "thus there is an excess of @xmath47 stars with large positive velocity and no apparent excess of stars with large negative velocity , significant at the @xmath4@xmath57 level .",
    "if the positive velocity outliers are main sequence stars , they are located at large distances 20 - 80 kpc ( see table [ tab : bound ] ) .",

    "if , on the other hand , the positive velocity outliers are halo stars on radial orbits , we would expect to find equal numbers of stars moving toward and away from us , contrary to observation .",
    "compact binary systems may also produce outliers in the velocity distribution .",
    "but velocity outliers resulting from compact binaries should be distributed symmetrically , again contrary to observation .",
    "we note that neutron stars are observed traveling at velocities of 1000 km s@xmath2 , but such neutron stars are the remnants of asymmetric supernova explosions , and are not b - type stars .",
    "one explanation for the significant excess of b - type stars traveling @xmath1 km s@xmath2 is the hvs mechanism .",
    "hvss are ejected by three - body interactions involving a mbh @xcite .",
    "hvss almost certainly come from the galactic center .",
    "the presence of a @xmath58 m@xmath32 mbh @xcite in the crowded galactic center inevitably produces a `` fountain '' of hvss ejections .",
    "the actual hvs ejection rate depends on the number of stars with radial orbits in the mbh s so - called `` loss cone . ''",
    "if the mbh s loss cone is replenished with stars scattered in by massive star clusters , molecular clouds , or imbhs @xcite , then the ejection rate can be orders of magnitude larger than the original @xcite predictions .",
    "regardless of the exact rate , this fountain picture results in a broad spectrum of hvs ejection velocities which include bound and unbound orbits @xcite .",
    "@xcite recently calculated ejection velocities for binaries containing 3 - 4 m@xmath6 primaries matched to our survey of b - type stars .    over the volume sampled by our survey ,",
    "@xcite predict comparable numbers of hvss ejected into bound and unbound orbits .",
    "our survey has discovered 4 hvss on unbound orbits suggesting that @xmath59 of our excess @xmath47 positive velocity outliers are plausibly hvss on bound orbits .",
    "although the predicted and observed numbers of bound hvss are statistically consistent , we note that additional hvs mechanisms may be at work .",
    "for example , @xcite show that single stars can be ejected by encounters with stellar mass black holes orbiting the central mbh .",
    "such hvss tend to have lower ejection velocities than hvss ejected by the @xcite mechanism , and thus may account for additional hvss on bound orbits .",
    "figure [ fig : hvs ] plots the @xcite predicted velocity distributions for main sequence hvss ejected by the central mbh as a function of galactocentric radius .",
    "hvs velocities increase with depth because only the most rapidly moving hvss survive long enough to reach large galactocentric distances .",
    "the large squares in figure [ fig : hvs ] are our 4 hvss ( solid squares ) and the 11 stars with @xmath1 km s@xmath2 ( open squares ) .",
    "we assume that the stars are main - sequence stars , and use the observed colors and spectral types of the stars to estimate stellar luminosity , distance , and stellar mass ( see table [ tab : bound ] ) .",
    "the solid lines in figure [ fig : hvs ] indicate our survey limits for main sequence stars of a given stellar mass .",
    "we evaluate the probability of drawing our observed sample from the @xcite predicted distributions .",
    "we use the two - dimensional , two - sample kolmogorov - smirnov test @xcite to compare the observed and predicted distributions of hvs velocity and distance .",
    "first , we generate @xmath60 realizations of the observations  4 hvss plus 7 bound hvss randomly drawn from the 11 high velocity outliers  and calculate the maximum difference in integrated probability against the @xcite distributions .",
    "we use only the portion of the @xcite distributions that fall within our observational survey limits ( see figure [ fig : hvs ] ) .",
    "second , we randomly sample 11 objects from the @xcite distributions @xmath60 times and calculate the maximum difference in integrated probabilities against the @xcite distributions . again , we use only the portion of the @xcite distributions that fall within our observational survey limits . finally , the likelihood is the fraction of time that the probabilities of the synthetic data sets exceed the probabilities of the real data sets .",
    "the mean likelihood of drawing our observed sets of stars from the predicted distributions is approximately 0.128 , which neither strongly supports nor strongly rejects the @xcite model .",
    "we conclude that the most plausible explanation for the observed excess of positive velocity outliers is the hvs mechanism ejecting stars from the galactic center on bound orbits .",
    "we note that other stars in the literature may also be explained as bound hvss .",
    "for example , the 5 m@xmath6 main sequence b star hip 60350 has a heliocentric velocity of + 230 km @xmath61 and a full space velocity of 417 km @xmath61 based on _ hipparcos _ measurements @xcite .",
    "the star s large radial motion @xmath62 km @xmath61 means that it originated from well inside the solar circle , perhaps from the galactic center .",
    "our full sample of b - type stars contains many early - type stars at bright magnitudes .",
    "four of the early b stars in the full sample are possibly bound hvss with @xmath63 km s@xmath2 . if they are main sequence stars , the four early b stars have masses of 5 - 7 m@xmath6 and they are located at distances ranging 30 - 60 kpc ( bounded by the fast survey limiting magnitudes ) .",
    "we now ask whether the number of early and late b - type bound hvss are consistent with a standard initial mass function . assuming the stars are main sequence stars , there are nine 3 - 5 m@xmath6 stars in our sample located in the same volume as the four 5 - 7 m@xmath6 stars : a ratio of 2.25 .",
    "a salpeter initial mass function predicts a ratio of 2.7 , similar to what we observe .",
    "however , the lifetimes of 5 - 7 m@xmath6 main sequence stars are only 40 - 90 myr @xcite , a factor of 2 - 3 shorter than 3 - 5 m@xmath6 stars .",
    "the travel times of the four early b stars , assuming @xmath64 is their full space velocity , range from @xmath4100 to @xmath4150 myr from the galactic center .",
    "thus if the early b stars are main sequence stars ejected from the galactic center , they do not have high enough velocities to survive to their inferred distances .",
    "how can we reconcile the lifetimes of the early b - type stars with their travel times from the galactic center ?",
    "it is possible that the early b - type stars are blue stragglers , main sequence stars that have undergone mass transfer or mergers .",
    "blue stragglers are usually associated with globular clusters , yet surveys of field bhb stars in the halo find that half of the stars are in fact high surface - gravity blue stragglers or a dwarfs @xcite . because hvss likely originate in tight binary systems , it is possible that some hvss experience mass - transfer from their former companion prior to being ejected from the galactic center .",
    "a blue straggler origin is one explanation for hvs2 , an 8 m@xmath6 hvs with a main sequence lifetime otherwise inconsistent with travel time from the galactic center @xcite .",

    "the 11 possible bound hvss , on the other hand , appear more evenly distributed across the sky : 6 bound hvss are located @xmath67 and 5 bound hvss are located @xmath68 . to calculate the variation in unbound hvs fraction",
    ", we consider only 7 bound hvss ( the excess number of high velocity outliers in figure [ fig : hist ] ) and split them 4/3 between the anti - center and galactic - center hemispheres , respectively .",
    "the fraction of unbound hvss is then 50@xmath6930% in the anti - center hemisphere and 0@xmath6940% in the galactic - center hemisphere .",
    "although small number statistics overwhelm our measurement , the unbound hvs fraction appears consistent with the predictions of @xcite and the galactic center ejection picture .",
    "there is another possible explanation for spatial anisotropy : hvss ejected via single star encounters with a mbh binary are preferentially ejected in the orbital plane of the mbh binary @xcite .",
    "recent n - body simulations for the case of an imbh inspiralling into a mbh , however , show that hvss are ejected nearly isotropically because the angular momentum vector of the imbh rapidly changes on a @xmath41 myr timescale @xcite .",
    "moreover , our observed set of hvss do not share common travel times from the galactic center .",
    "different imbh inspiral events would likely have different orbital histories , thus it seems unlikely that the observed hvs spatial distribution can point back to a binary mbh origin .",
    "a set of hvss with common travel times must be found in order to test the binary mbh origin .",
    "we discuss our targeted survey for hvss , a spectroscopic survey of stars with b - type colors . we introduce a new component of the survey that samples brighter and bluer stars using the fast spectrograph .",
    "our combined set of observations now contains 699 stars of b spectral type , 188 white dwarfs , and 1 previously unidentified @xmath21 quasar located at @xmath70 ( j2000 ) .",
    "we find no new unbound hvs , but we find evidence for a new class of _ bound _ hvss .",
    "the velocity distribution of the b - type stars shows a significant excess of @xmath47 stars with large positive velocities @xmath1 km s@xmath2 and no apparent excess of stars with large negative velocity , significant at the @xmath4@xmath57 level .",
    "neither halo stars on radial orbits , compact binary stars , nor main sequence run - away stars ejected from the disk can explain simultaneously the large velocities and distances of these stars .",
    "the most plausible explanation is that the positive velocity outliers are hvss ejected from the galactic center on bound orbits .",
    "our bright fast survey contains a large number of early b - type stars , four of which have velocities @xmath1 km s@xmath2 .",
    "these four possible bound hvss have main sequence lifetimes too short to survive to their inferred distances , however .",
    "one explanation is that the stars are post - main sequence stars .",
    "establishing hvss as main sequence or post - main sequence stars is important for measuring the stellar mass function of hvss and probing the types of stars that orbit near the mbh .",
    "stellar rotation is a useful discriminant between rapidly rotating main sequence b stars @xcite and slowly rotating bhb stars @xcite .",
    "metallicity is also a good discriminant between young main sequence b stars and post - main sequence halo stars .",
    "echelle observations of the brightest hvss , underway now , will reveal the stars true nature .",
    "a galactic center origin predicts that unbound hvss should be found preferentially towards the anti - center as a result of survey selection .",
    "we observe that the unbound hvss have a marginally anisotropic distribution at 2-@xmath0 confidence .",
    "our estimates of unbound hvs fraction are consistent with the galactic center ejection picture .",
    "measuring the spatial distribution of a larger sample of hvss may provide a strong test of the stars origin .",
    "we note that full space motions for the hvss will be known in a few years .",
    "a _ hubble space telescope _",
    "program is measuring the stars positions with 0.5 mas accuracies by registering background galaxies across advanced camera for surveys images .",
    "the hvss have predicted proper motions of 0.5 - 1 mas yr@xmath2 , thus 3@xmath0 proper motion measurements are possible over a three year baseline @xcite .",
    "we are continuing our targeted hvs survey of faint b - type stars .",
    "sdss data release 5 provides additional targets that we are now following - up with the mmt and whipple 1.5 m telescopes .",
    "given our current discovery rate , we expect to find another few unbound hvss in the coming months .",
    "identifying hvss throughout the galaxy will allow us to measure the mass function of stars in the galactic center and the history of stellar interactions with the central mbh .",
