    "we plot the corrected flare cooling times predicted by serio s scaling law in fig .  6 ( bottom right panel ) .",
    "the major effect of serio s correction is that the cooling times of the larger and hotter soft x - ray emitting flare loops become shorter , limiting essentially all flare loop cooling times to @xmath251 s. thus , large flares that last significantly longer ( up to @xmath252 s ) must consist of multiple subflares .",
    "the combined @xmath253 diagram for solar and stellar flares ( fig .",
    "3 ) shows some similarities but also intriguing differences in the scaling behavior .",
    "solar flares have been observed mostly in the temperature range of @xmath254 mk ( or @xmath255 mk if we include the euv nanoflares ) , while stellar flares have been detected within the temperature range of @xmath107 mk .",
    "the lack of observations of cooler stellar flares @xmath256 mk is likely to be due to the sensitivity limit , which is about at @xmath257 @xmath12 for stellar flares .",
    "the sensitivity limit also systematically increases with higher flare temperatures , up to @xmath258 @xmath12 for the hottest stellar flares with @xmath259 mk , which is likely a consequence of the decreasing sensitivity of current soft x - ray detectors at higher temperature lines .",
    "what is similar for both solar and stellar flares is the overall slope of the @xmath69 relationship , which was found to have a powerlaw slope of @xmath260 for solar flares ( excluding the rhessi data that have a high - temperature bias ) , and a slope of slope of @xmath261 for stellar flares ( fig .  3 ) .",
    "both powerlaw slopes are consistent with the theoretically expected scaling of @xmath262 ( eq .  33 ) , which is based on the rtv scaling law ( eq .  23 ) , the fractal volume scaling ( eq .  29 ) , and the observed spatial scaling @xmath263 in solar flares ( eq .  18 ) .",
    "this agreement supports the assumption of the fractal volume scaling .",

    "what is different between solar and stellar flares is the emission measure in the same temperature range . in the overlapping temperature range of @xmath267 mk",
    "we find that the total emission measure of stellar flares is larger by an average factor of @xmath268 comparing the factors ( eqs .",
    "15 , 16 ) of the two linear regression fits in fig .",
    "if we compare the theoretical model of the rtv law and the fractal volume scaling ( eq .  31 ) for the same temperature range ( eq .  33 ) , we see that the total volume - integrated emission measure ratio of stellar to solar flare depends on the volume filling factor @xmath269 , length scale @xmath3 , and volume fractal dimension @xmath270 .",
    "since the sensitivity limit of stellar soft x - ray detectors represents a bias for larger emission measures , we think that the observed stellar flares have a bias for both higher volume filling factors @xmath269 and flare sizes @xmath3 . for solar flares we found",
    "spatial filling factors in the range of @xmath19 ( aschwanden & aschwanden 2006b ) , so stellar filling factors can be up to a factor of @xmath271 higher , ameliorating the size requirement to be @xmath272 to match the 250 ( eq .",
    "48 ) times larger emission measures of of detected stellar flares .      the electron density @xmath63 of the flare plasma can not directly be measured and is therefore dependent on the volume model if derived from the total emission measure .",
    "if the density is naively derived from an euclidian flare volume , i.e. , @xmath273 , we obtain only a lower limit . however , detailed measurements of the area fractal dimension and modeling of the volume fractal dimension has yielded volume filling factors of @xmath274 for solar flares , which raises the average electron densities in the flare loops ( at the flare peak time ) by a factor of @xmath275 .",
    "thus , a more realistic estimate of the plasma density in flare loops , based on the observed total emission measure @xmath1 and flare length scale @xmath3 is ( using the fractal scaling of eq .",

    "21 ) applied to the observed flare peak temperature @xmath0 and loop half length @xmath3 , @xmath278 we show the two estimated electron densities versus each other in fig .  7 and find a good agreement within less than an order of magnitude .",

    "34 ) , as it can be seen in fig .  8 by comparing with the rtv predictions for individual flare loop lengths .",
    "this scaling law predicts a electron densities of @xmath281 @xmath12 for nanoflares at @xmath13 mk , densities of @xmath282 @xmath12 for typical solar flares at @xmath15 mk , and densities of @xmath283 @xmath12 for large stellar flares at @xmath17 mk .",
    "is there evidence for such higher electron densities in stellar flare loops ?",
    "recent reviews ( e.g. ,  10 in gdel 2004 ; ness et al .",
    "2004 ) of electron density measurements in stellar flare loops based on density - sensitive iron line pairs quote a typical range of @xmath284 @xmath12 .",
    "a density of @xmath285 @xmath12 and a spatial scale of 0.1 stellar radius ( @xmath286 mm ) was measured in a spatially resolved flare on the eclipsing binary algol b ( schmitt et al .",
    "this range of observed densities ( @xmath287 @xmath12 ) brackets our theoretically predicted range .",
    "we have also to keep in mind that previously measured densities from stellar spectroscopy ( from he - like triplets of ov ii , ne ix , mg xi , si xiii , and density - sensitive line ratios ) have severe sensitivity limitations for densities above @xmath288 @xmath12 .",
    "so our densities predicted by the rtv law are in the same ballpark as the observed stellar flare densities .",
    "the rtv law seems to be a good prediction tool , and the effects of short heating times , which can be a factor of @xmath190 lower than the rtv predicted densities ( appendix a ; fig .",
    "9 ) , largely cancel out the effects of short heating scale heigths , which can reach up to a factor of @xmath190 higher densities than predicted by the rtv law .",
    "a correlation between the volume emission measure @xmath289 and the flare peak temperature @xmath0 was extended from solar flares to stellar flares ( e.g. , feldman et al .",
    "1995b ; stern 1992 ; shibata & yokoyama 1999 , 2002 ) .",
    "a theoretical attempt was made to explain the solar / stellar @xmath69 correlation with a universal flare model in terms of magnetic reconnection by shibata & yokoyama ( 1999 , 2002 ) . using the result of numerical mhd simulations of flares conducted in yokoyama & shibata ( 1998 ) , where the flare peak temperature scales as @xmath290 ( with @xmath291 the magnetic field strength and @xmath292 the electron density outside the reconnection region ) , setting the thermal pressure equal to the magnetic pressure , @xmath293 , and assuming euclidian volume scaling ,",
    "@xmath294 , they arrived at an `` universal scaling law '' of ( their eq .",
    "5 ) @xmath295 \\ , \\ ] ] so the emission measure scales with a power of @xmath296 .",
    "if we introduce the fractal scaling of the flare volume , @xmath297 , the universal scaling law of shibata and yokoyama ( 1999 ) takes the following form , @xmath298 which yields the following coefficients for fractal scaling ( @xmath299 and @xmath300 ) and euclidian scaling ( @xmath301 ) , @xmath302 thus , if the magnetic field @xmath291 and electron density @xmath292 outside the reconnection region do not have a systematic scaling with the flare peak temperature @xmath0 , the universal scaling law of shibata and yokoyama ( 1999 ) predicts a scaling law of @xmath303 for the observed volume fractal scaling of @xmath300 , which is somewhat steeper than our measured values of @xmath304 for stellar flares , or predicted by the rtv law , i.e. , @xmath9 .",
    "testing the validity of the universal scaling law of shibata and yokoyama ( 1999 ) requires also statistics on magnetic field strengths @xmath291 and ambient electron densities @xmath292 in flares .",
    "we compiled directly observed parameters from solar and stellar flares , such as the volume peak emission measure @xmath1 , flare peak temperature @xmath0 , flare duration @xmath2 , and flare length scale @xmath3 ( the latter only for solar flares ) .",
    "a prominent statistical correlation is found between the volume emission measure @xmath1 and flare peak temperature @xmath0 , which scales as @xmath305 for both solar and stellar flares .",
    "another recent study demonstrated that the flare volume has a fractal scaling , @xmath306 , rather than the generally used euclidian scaling of @xmath307 . applying the rtv scaling law , combined with the fractal volume scaling and the statistical @xmath308 correlation @xmath6 , leads directly to a theoretically predicted scaling law of @xmath9 , which explains the observed correlations in both solar and stellar flares .",
    "a second result we find is an unexplained offset by a factor of about 250 between solar and stellar flares at the same temperature , which is likely due to a selection bias for stellar flare events with larger volume filling factors and larger spatial scales .",
    "interestingly , however , this selection bias does not affect the overall @xmath253 relationship and the lower threshold has a similar functional dependence of @xmath309 , probably because the detector sensitivities are dropping off with a similar function with higher temperatures .",
    "a third result is that our model of fractal flare volume scaling provides realistic estimates of volume filling factors , and thus of flare densities .",
    "we find that the electron densities in solar flare loops can be predicted based on our fractal scaling in close agreement to the predictions of the rtv law .",
    "the agreement of the predicted electron densities with both methods agrees always better than an order of magnitude ( fig .",
    "7 ) , although the absolute magnitude varies by three orders of magnitude between the smallest nanoflares and the largest solar flares , i.e. , @xmath310 @xmath12 .",
    "since the rtv scaling law ( combined with the observed @xmath311 correlation ) predicts about a linear relationship between the electron densities and flare peak temperatures , i.e. , @xmath312 , we expect up to an order of magnitude higher electron densities in the largest stellar flares due to the higher temperature than in solar flares .",
    "the determination of correct scaling laws allows us also to infer realistic estimates of the ( conductive and radiative ) flare cooling times , which can be tested from the e - folding decay time of individual peaks in ( solar and stellar ) flare light curves .",
    "the scaling laws allow us also to eliminate temperature biases in the statistics of the total thermal energy of flares , i.e. , @xmath313 .",
    "since we find that the electron density ( corrected for a fractal filling factor ) scales approximately as @xmath314 , the thermal energy scales approximately as @xmath315 , and thus the observed total emission measure @xmath1 can be used as a good proxy for the thermal flare energy @xmath53 .",
    "such unbiased frequency distributions of flare energies @xmath316 permit us then to determine whether there is more energy in large or small flares , an important test for nanoflare heating theories .",
    "we acknowledge very helpful comments from the referee , kazunari shibata , marc audard , rhessi data from marina battaglia , and hydrodynamic simulations from david tsiklauri .",
    "part of this work was supported by nasa contract nas5 - 38099 ( trace mission ) and the nasa / lws - trt contract `` energy scaling of flares '' nag5 - 13490 .",
    "here we compare the electron densities predicted by the rtv law ( eq .  19 ;  4.1 ) with maximum flare densities @xmath317 obtained from hydrodynamic simulations of heated flare loops .",
    "we make use of a parametric study of radiative hydrodynamic modeling conducted in tsiklauri et al .",

    "we show 4 evolutionary curves of the apex temperature @xmath321 as a function of the electron density @xmath322 for the lowest and highest heating rate , as well as for the shortest and longest heating duration in fig .",
    "we see that the 5 different sets of heating rates produce approximately maximum flare temperatures of @xmath323 14 , 22 , 35 , 43 , and 53 mk .",
    "all parametric values are also tabulated in table 1 of tsiklauri et al .",

    "9 and compare it with the rtv law ( eq .  21 ) , which is indicated with a dashed line in fig .  9 .",
    "we can consider now the density ratio @xmath324 at the flare maximum temperature and find that this ratio is a systematic function of the heating time scale @xmath320 , but is almost independent of the heating rate @xmath325 and maximum temperature @xmath139 .",
