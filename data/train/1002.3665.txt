    "graphene , a two - dimensional single - layer crystal of carbon atoms arraying in a honeycomb lattice , is a novel and exciting material @xcite .",
    "the low energy excitation of a graphene has a linear dispersion relation , and the dynamics of the charge carriers obeys the massless dirac - like equation @xcite . because of the unique band structures , the graphene has many peculiar properties , such as that the hall plateaus occur at half - integer multiples of @xmath1 with the spin and valley degeneracy @xmath2 , and the conductivity at the zero magnetic field has a non - zero minimal value @xcite . for the neutral graphene , its fermi level is located at the dirac points , the corners of the hexagonal first brillouin zone . in experiment ,",
    "a gate voltage can be used to tune the fermi level , which can be above or below the dirac points @xcite .",
    "in addition , graphene also exhibits many excellent transport characteristics : the high mobility @xcite , long spin relaxation length @xcite , and stable behaviors under ambient conditions . at room temperature , its mobilities",
    "can be above @xmath3 , implying that the mean free path can be as long as a few hundred nanometers .",
    "because of weak spin - orbit coupling @xcite and low hyperfine interaction @xcite , its spin relaxation length can reach the order of the micrometer at room temperature .",
    "thus , graphene may be an excellent candidate for microelectronic applications , in particular for spintronic applications @xcite .    in general",
    ", the charge carriers in graphene are not spin - polarized . for spintronic applications , people try to inject the spin - polarized current or to induce the spin - polarized carriers in the graphene .",
    "recently , many works are focusing on this issue .",
    "for example , haugen _ et al _ @xcite suggested that the spin - polarized carriers can be realized by growing the graphene on a ferromagnetic ( fm ) insulator ( e.g. euo ) .",
    "owing to the magnetic proximity effect , an exchange split between the spin - up and spin - down carriers in the graphene is induced , and then the carriers are spin - polarized .",
    "based on the first - principles calculations , son _",
    "et al _ @xcite predicted that the zigzag graphene nanoribbon becomes a half metal when an in - plane transverse electric field is applied . also , lin _ et al _ @xcite demonstrated that electron - electron correlation in armchair graphene nano - ribbon can generate the flat - band ferromagnetism . on the experiment side ,",
    "a large spin injection into the graphene has been realized by connecting the graphene to an fm electrode @xcite .",
    "furthermore , several groups @xcite have performed nonlocal magnetoresistance(mr ) measurements , in which a net spin current is brought between the injector and detector .",
    "the well - known application in spintronics is the spin - valve effect @xcite , in which the resistance of devices can be changed by manipulating the relative orientation of the magnetizations .",
    "motivated by the spintronic application with the novel material , the spin - polarized transport through graphene are currently attracting a great deal of attentions @xcite . using the tight - binding model , brey and",
    "fertig @xcite studied the mr of the fm / graphene / fm junction in the limit of infinite width .",
    "they found that the mr is rather small since the conductivity is weakly dependent on the relative magnetization orientations of fm leads . ding _",
    "et al _ @xcite investigated the similar device with two fm leads by a continuous model .",
    "the results showed that the mr versus the bias exhibits a cusp around the zero bias in absence of external magnetic field and oscillating behavior at the high magnetic field .",
    "based on the first - principles calculation , kim and kim @xcite predicted that a graphene - based spin - valve device could have a high mr .    in this paper , we study the conductance and mr of a graphene - based spin valve .",
    "the device consists of a graphene nanoribbon coupling to two fm leads , as shown in figure  [ fig1](a ) . here",
    "the width of the device is finite in the order of 10 nanometers , i.e. the size effect is considered . in recent experiments",
    "@xcite , a few 10-nanometer or sub-10-nanometer graphene nanoribbons have already been fabricated successfully .",
    "for a finite - width graphene nanoribbon , the wave vectors along the confined direction are discrete , and the transverse subbands emerge .",
    "the characteristics of the subbands are strongly dependent on the chirality of the graphene - nanoribbon edge @xcite , e.g. the zigzag edge or armchair edge .",
    "so the conductance and mr should be strongly dependent on the boundary condition of graphene nanoribbon .",
    "in addition , we consider that two fm leads also have the hexagonal lattice structure as the graphene . in other words ,",
    "the leads are graphene - based fm or called the fm graphene . on the experiment ,",
    "the fm electrode ( e.g. the cobalt electrode ) usually overlaps on the graphene through a thin oxide layer @xcite . because of the magnetic proximity effect and the zeeman effect , an exchange split in the graphene underneath the oxide layer is induced , then its carriers are spin - polarized .",
    "so the graphene covered with the fm electrode has the magnetization .",
    "then the spin - polarized charge carriers , driven by a bias , travel from one fm graphene through the central normal graphene to another fm graphene .    in the tight - binding model the landauer - bttiker formula and non - equilibrium green s function method are applied to calculate the conductance and mr . for the zigzag graphene ribbon case",
    ", we found that when the graphene nanoribbon is narrow enough and its separation @xmath4 between the first subband and the zeroth subband is larger than the exchange split energy @xmath5 , the conductance for the antiparallel magnetization configuration can almost be zero in a quite large energy window around the dirac point .",
    "but for the parallel configuration the conductance is always larger than @xmath0 , so the mr exhibits a plateau with the value @xmath6 . as the width of the nanoribbon increases , the sub - band separation @xmath4 gradually decreases , and the mr can keep at the value @xmath6 at the beginning of @xmath7 , then decreases when @xmath8 . in the presence of the disorder , the mr slightly drops , but even in quite large disorder it can keep the value @xmath9 , which is still much larger than 10% , the lower limit of the giant magnetoresistance effect .",
    "what is more , for the armchair graphene nanoribbon case , the mr is always small regardless of the width of nanoribbon . by comparing two cases of graphene ribbons with different edges ,",
    "it is more reasonable to apply zigzag graphene ribbons to the spin - valve devices .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ ii ] , we describe the model and the details of the calculations . in sections iii and [ iv ] we will give the numerical results of the conductance and mr for the zigzag and armchair edge cases , respectively . finally , a brief conclusion is presented in section [ v ] .     vs. the fermi energy @xmath10 for the different magnetization @xmath5 at the parallel configuration ( @xmath11 ) .",

    "the graphene nanoribbon with the specific parity edge has already been successfully fabricated @xcite .",
    "in summary , we have studied the electronic transport and magnetoresistance ( mr ) in graphene - based ferromagnetic / normal / ferromagnetic junction where the finite width and the arbitrarily relative orientation between the lead magnetizations are taken into account . for the zigzag edge case ,",
    "the conductance for the parallel configuration is always larger than @xmath0 under any parameter condition , but for the antiparallel configuration the conductance is exactly zero when fermi energy is around the dirac point due to the band - selective rule .",
    "this leads to a 100% mr plateau .",
    "the 100% mr plateau is almost not affected by the length of the central graphene region . with the increasing of the width of the ribbon , the 100% mr plateau is kept stable in the beginning , but is smeared at the wide ribbon limit . in the presence of the disorder , the mr is slightly suppressed , but can still keep the plateau shape with the value about @xmath9 even in quite large disorder strengths . when the orientation between magnetizations of two ferromagnetic leads is arbitrary , the conductance versus the relative angle @xmath174 is similar to a cosine formation .",
    "what s more , for the armchair edge case , the mr is relatively small .",
    "therefore , it is more favorable to fabricate the graphene - based spin valve devices by using the zigzag edge graphene ribbons .",
