    "understanding pairing correlations has been and still remains a challenge for nuclear physicists .",
    "several decades ago it was thought that pairing correlations will only affect a few nuclei and the properties of a few observables at low energy and small angular momentum ; mainly the level density of odd nuclei as compared with the even ones , the energy of the two quasiparticle states and the moments of inertia of rotational nuclei .",
    "such simplistic view has changed over the years in such a way that nowadays we expect pairing correlations playing a major role in many nuclear phenomena . to mention a few recent examples let us remember the important role of pairing correlations in halo nuclei , in @xmath2 systems and in the understanding of the second moment of inertia in superdeformed nuclei .    in spite of all that the theoretical understanding of the pairing force is rather limited .",
    "the recognition of this fact has motivated in the last years a proliferation of approximate methods ( lipkin - nogami , kamlah at second order and exact particle number projection ) and new pairing forces ( density dependent , surface and volume pairing ) .    within the mean field approaches",
    "the most successful calculations , aiming at describing low energy nuclear structure phenomena have been performed with density dependent forces .",
    "the most popular , because of its simplicity , is the skyrme force .",
    "most of the calculations have been performed with the skm@xmath3 parameterization @xcite .",
    "the main disadvantage of the skyrme interaction is that realistic pairing matrix elements can not be extracted from the force , and therefore the pairing interaction ( normally a monopole pairing term ) has to be added by hand .",
    "recently , other alternative forms of the pairing interaction , like density dependent pairing have been explored in connection with the skyrme interaction @xcite .",
    "theories beyond mean field with simple pairing forces have been also developed @xcite .",
    "pairing properties , on the other hand , are very important in the description of high spin properties . since the pioneer work of mottelson and valatin @xcite many papers and experiments have been devoted to this topic .",
    "this is why the investigation of high spin states with a realistic force that is able to treat the short range correlations properly is most desirable .",
    "the gogny force @xcite is well known for providing , with the same set of parameters , a good description of many nuclear properties at low spins over the nuclide chart as , for example , ground state energies , odd - even mass differences , electron scattering data @xcite , fission barriers @xcite , etc .",
    "the main ingredients of the force are the phenomenological density dependent term which was introduced to simulate the effect of a g - matrix interaction and the finite range of the force which provides the pairing matrix elements from the force itself . in recent calculations",
    "the gogny force has been applied to high spin problems at normal deformations @xcite and to superdeformed shapes @xcite .    in these calculations",
    "the cranked hfb approximation ( chfb ) was used .",
    "the angular momentum and number of particles of the system were determined by the corresponding constraints on the wave function .",
    "it turned out @xcite , however , that in spite of the finite range of the force , the condition of holding the particle number to be right on the average was not enough and a superfluid normalfluid sharp phase transition was found , contrary to what one would expect for a finite system . to remedy this problem , in @xcite we have formulated the lipkin - nogami method for density dependent forces , the so - called chfb lipkin - nogami approximation(chfbln ) . when this formalism was applied the sharp phase transition",
    "was washed out , the results of the calculations being in much better agreement with the experiment .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to report on calculations in the @xmath1 and @xmath0 regions within the chfb and chfbln approximations and the gogny force . in section 2.1",
    "we first derive the lipkin - nogami approximation from the kamlah expansion to second order . in sect .",
    "2.2 we extend this formalism to density dependent forces obtaining an extra contribution due to the rearrangement term . in sect .",
    "3.1 we discuss results for the @xmath1 region , namely for the @xmath4hg and @xmath5pb , and in sect .",
    "3.2 the @xmath0 region , taking as examples the @xmath6dy and @xmath7gd nuclei .",
    "we conclude the paper with conclusions and some appendixes .",
    "mean field theories ( mft ) are based on the assumption of a product wave function ; they constitute the basic ( and in most cases the only one feasible ) approximation to a many body system .",
    "the success of mft is based on the concept of spontaneous symmetry breaking . by this mechanism",
    "the hilbert space is considerably enlarged and many correlations can be taken into account . obviously , the corresponding wave functions have to be considered as `` intrinsic '' wave functions .",
    "the most sophisticated mean field theory is the hfb approximation , in which the intrinsic wave function @xmath8 is defined as the non - trivial vacuum to the quasi - particle annihilation operators @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the set of single particle creation and annihilation operators in terms of which the quasi - particle operators are expanded , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the so - called bogoliubov wave functions .",
    "product wave functions , @xmath8 , of quasiparticles @xmath13 , in general , are neither eigenfunction of the angular momentum nor of the particle number operator . for heavy , well deformed nuclei , the usual approach of demanding that ,",
    "at least , the expectation values of the angular momentum and the particle number operators take the right value , is a good approximation for the angular momentum but not for the particle number .",
    "this has to do with the number of nucleons participating in the breaking of the associated symmetry @xcite .",
    "the ideal treatment of pairing correlations in nuclei is particle number projection ( pnp ) before the variation @xcite . at high spin",
    "this theory is rather complicated to implement and up to now it has only been applied to separable forces @xcite . on the other hand , the semi - classical recipe of solving the mean field equations with a constraint on the corresponding symmetry operator can be derived as the first order approach to a full quantum - mechanical expansion ( the kamlah expansion @xcite ) of the projected quantities .",
    "the second order in this expansion takes into account the particle number fluctuations and might cure some of the deficiencies of the first order approximation . however , full selfconsistent calculations up to second order are rather cumbersome and just simple model calculations have been carried out up to now @xcite .",
    "most second order calculations have been done using the lipkin - nogami ( ln ) recipe , which was originally proposed in refs .",
    "recently , the ln method has been applied to study superdeformed nuclei at high spins adding a monopole pairing interaction to the woods - saxon plus strutinsky approximation @xcite , and to the skyrme force @xcite .",
    "the usual derivation of the ln method is not valid for density dependent forces because the dependence in density is not taken explicitly into account . in refs.@xcite",
    "the ln approach was generalized to properly deal with this situation .",
    "the derivation is based in the kamlah expansion for the particle number projected energy . in the new formulation additional terms",
    "arise in the equations determining the parameters of the theory . to introduce the approximation and the corresponding notation we make in the following a short derivation of it .",
    "the ln method can be derived using different arguments . as the usual ways of deriving the ln method are not well suited for a generalization to the case of density dependent forces , in this section we shall derive the equations for non - density dependent forces using the kamlah expansion .",
    "this derivation can be easily extended to the density dependent case , see sec .",
    "let @xmath14 be a product wave function of the hartree - fock - bogoliubov type , i.e. a particle number symmetry violating wave function .",
    "we can generate an eigenstate of the particle number , @xmath15 , by the projection technique @xcite @xmath16 the particle number projected energy is given by @xmath17 where we have introduced the hamiltonian and norm overlaps @xmath18 in the case of large particle numbers and strong deformations in the gauge space associated to @xmath19 , one expects the @xmath20 and @xmath21 overlaps to be peaked at @xmath22 and to be very small elsewhere in such a way that the quotient @xmath23 behaves smoothly . in this case",
    "one can make an expansion of @xmath20 in terms of @xmath21 in the following way @xcite @xmath24 where we have introduced the kamlah operator @xmath25 which is a representation of the particle number operator in the space of the parameter @xmath26 .",
    "@xmath27 represents the order of the expansion , for @xmath28 eq .",
    "( [ hphi ] ) is exact . for large symmetry breaking systems and",
    "large particle number one expects convergence with a few terms .",
    "the expansion coefficients @xmath29 are determined by applying the operators @xmath30 on eq .",
    "( [ hphi ] ) and taking the limit @xmath31 , one obtains @xmath32 with @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",

    "i.e. @xmath40 , one obtains @xmath41 with @xmath42 in this case to minimize the approximate projected energy , we have to solve the hfb equations with the constraint @xmath43 , i.e. the old bcs recipe .",
    "this approximation is expected to be good for very strong violating wave functions . in atomic nuclei where only a few pairs participate in the pairing correlations",
    ", we do not expect the first order approximation to be a good one .    for @xmath44",

    "this can be easily realized noticing that eq .",
    "( [ cran ] ) must hold for any variation @xmath57 , in particular , we can choose @xmath58 .",
    "substitution of this specific variation in eq .",
    "( [ cran ] ) provides @xmath59 comparison with eq .",
    "( [ h_1 ] ) shows that @xmath60 .",
    "we have formulated the approximation for one class of nucleons ( i.e. protons or neutrons ) , in practical cases one has to do it simultaneously for protons and neutrons but it is easy to show that for @xmath44 there is no coupling between protons and neutrons .",
    "the energy to be minimized is @xmath61 with the constraints @xmath62 and @xmath63 . in these expressions",

    "now we would like to generalize the formulae of the former section to density dependent forces , like the gogny force @xcite @xmath72 where the dependence on the wave function @xmath39 , through the density @xmath73 , adds some peculiarities .",
    "density dependent forces do not exhibit , in general , the same properties as the bare two - nucleon force .",
    "let @xmath39 be a @xmath74-symmetry breaking wave function and @xmath75 the corresponding interaction .",
    "it is obvious that @xmath76 that means , the two - body interaction in a @xmath74-rotated system is the same as the interaction calculated with the rotated density .",
    "( [ tbs ] ) is valid for any symmetry @xmath74 , in the particular case of symmetries with no dependence on the spatial coordinate @xmath77 , for example the particle number , it also holds @xmath78 i.e. the @xmath79 interaction and the generators of the symmetry @xmath74 do commute . in particular , for the particle number , in which we are interested here , @xmath79 satisfies the same properties as the bare force .    in the context of plain mean field theories",
    "there is no ambiguity left concerning the density dependence of the hamiltonian . in theories beyond mean field , for example the generator coordinate method or projected theories , in evaluating the expectation value of the energy , appear matrix elements like @xmath80 , or in the case of pnp , the overlap @xmath81 . here",
    "a complication arises from the density dependent term of the hamiltonian because it is not obvious which density dependence should be taken in the potential ( [ gognyforce ] ) .",
    "a skyrme force with a _ linear _ dependence in the density can be cast as a three body force . for this particular case",
    "it can be shown that the density to be used in the hamiltonian in the evaluation of the matrix elements @xmath80 must be a non - diagonal density @xmath82 given by @xmath83 where we have introduced the density operator @xmath84 .",
    "for the particular case of pnp , this density is given by @xmath85 up to now , based on this result , the same prescription has been adopted for skyrme forces with a _",
    "non linear _ dependence in @xmath86 @xcite as well as with the gogny force @xcite .",
    "this prescription is , however , not well founded . in the context of the ln approximation there have been two approaches to this problem .",
    "the first one @xcite , considers the energy as a functional of the densities ( normal and abnormal ) while the second one @xcite , is based on a many - body density dependence of the potential .",

    "we shall derive the approximate particle number projection equations for potentials with a density dependence like eq .",

    "( [ delener ] ) provides @xmath204",
    "we want to define a prescription to evaluate overlaps of the hamiltonian @xmath205 for density dependent forces where both @xmath206 and @xmath207 are product wave functions of the hfb type .",
    "the philosophy behind the prescription is that a density dependent force does not define a hamiltonian but rather the energy , which is a functional of the density and the pairing tensor @xmath208=\\sum _ { k_{1}k_{2}}t_{k_{1}k_{2}}\\rho _ { k_{2}k_{1}}+ \\frac{1}{4}\\sum _ { k_{1}k_{2}k_{3}k_{4}}\\overline{\\nu}_{k_{1}k_{2}k_{3}k_{4}}\\left ( 2\\rho _ { k_{4}k_{2}}\\rho _ { k_{3}k_{1}}+\\kappa _ { k_{3}k_{4}}\\kappa ^{*}_{k_{1}k_{2}}\\right )   \\label{erk}\\ ] ] where the two - body interaction could depend upon the spatial density @xmath209 to some power @xmath210 , @xmath211 $ ] , as is the case for the gogny force . in the above expression the spatial density",
    "is defined in the usual way @xmath212 where the density operator is given by @xmath213    the formal evaluation of the hamiltonian overlap for _ non - density dependent forces _ is straightforward . using the extended wick theorem",
    ", one gets @xmath214 where @xmath215 therefore , for _ non - density dependent forces _ both , the energy , eq .",
    "( [ erk ] ) and the hamiltonian overlap , eq .",
    "( [ ove ] ) , are given by the _ same functional _ of the density matrix and the pairing tensor but evaluated with the corresponding densities and pairing tensors .",
    "inspired by these results we use the following prescription for _ density dependent forces _  : in the evaluation of the hamiltonian overlap a density dependent interaction depending upon @xmath216 , eq .",
    "( [ rhotilde ] ) , must be used . from the point of view of defining a hamiltonian the previous prescription amounts to use the density latexmath:[\\[\\widetilde{\\rho }",
    "( \\vec{r})=\\frac{\\left\\langle \\phi |\\hat{\\rho } ( \\vec{r } )    the density dependent part of the hamiltonian .",
    "this prescription coincides with the one obtained for a skyrme force with a linear dependence in @xmath86 .",
    "the above density is , in general , not a real quantity rendering the density dependent `` hamiltonian '' a non hermitian operator .",
    "this is not a real problem as the hamiltonian overlap can be a complex quantity , we only have to be sure that the projected energy is a real quantity as it will be shown below .",
    "another important check concerning the consistency of the prescription is the following  : since @xmath218 and the density dependent hamiltonian do commute and @xmath219 , we may write @xmath220 according to our prescription , to evaluate non - diagonal matrix elements of the first expression of @xmath221 in eq .",
    "( [ rel1 ] ) , in the hamiltonian we have to consider the density @xmath222 whereas for the non - diagonal matrix elements of the second expression of @xmath221 in eq .",
    "( [ rel1 ] ) one should use @xmath223 the final result , should be independent of whether we use the first or the second expression .",
    "this is clearly true , since eq .",
    "( [ first ] ) can be written as @xmath224 due to the commutativity of @xmath225 with @xmath226 .",
    "the operator @xmath225 also commutes with @xmath227 showing that @xmath228e^{i\\phi ' \\hat{n}}\\left| \\phi \\right\\rangle                    = \\left\\langle \\phi \\right| \\hat{h}[\\widetilde{\\rho } _ { 0,\\phi           ' -\\phi } ( \\vec{r})]e^{i(\\phi ' -\\phi ) \\hat{n}}\\left| \\phi           \\right\\rangle \\nonumber \\\\           & = & h(0,\\phi ' -\\phi ) \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is the property needed to obtain the second expression of eq ( [ rel1 ] ) .",
    "obviously , we shall use the second expression for the projected energy and eq .",
    "( [ mypres ] ) , for the density entering in the density dependent part of the interaction , in the evaluation of @xmath229 .    next , in order to ensure the reality of the projected energy",

    "in order to evaluate @xmath236 we will use the following relation @xmath237 in this expression the density appearing in the density dependent part of the hamiltonian is , obviously @xmath238 .",
    "the matrix element of the right hand side is given by eq .",
