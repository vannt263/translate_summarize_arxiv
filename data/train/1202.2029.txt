    "in the present paper , we consider the following semilinear stochastic partial differential equation driven by a finite - dimensional wiener process : @xmath0{\\mathrm{d}}t+\\sigma(u)\\,{\\mathrm{d}}w,\\quad x\\in{\\mathbb{t}}^n,\\;t\\in(0,t),\\\\ u(0)&=u_0 , \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 is a strongly elliptic differential operator , @xmath2 is generally nonlinear unbounded operator and the diffusion coefficient in the stochastic term is also nonlinear .",
    "it is a well known fact in the field of pdes and spdes that many equations do not , in general , have classical or strong solutions . unlike deterministic problems , in the case of stochastic equations we can only ask whether the solution is smooth in the space variable . thus , the aim of the present work is to determine conditions on coefficients and initial data under which there exists a spatially smooth solution to .",
    "the literature devoted to the regularity for linear spdes is quite extensive mainly due to krylov ( see @xcite ) , krylov and rozovskii ( see @xcite , @xcite and the references therein ) and flandoli ( see @xcite )",
    ". however , there seems to be less papers concentrated on regularity for nonlinear spdes .",
    "a class of second order parabolic semilinear spdes was studied by gyngy and rovira ( see @xcite ) but they were only concerned with @xmath3-valued solutions .",
    "so our work can be regarded as an extension of their result .",
    "related problems were also discussed by zhang ( see @xcite , @xcite ) , however , his assumptions are not satisfied in our case .",
    "the main difficulty in the case of semilinear equations lies in the nonlinearities @xmath2 and @xmath4 as , in higher order sobolev spaces , we can not expect the lipschitz condition to be satisfied and hence the fixed point argument can not be applied .",
    "in fact , even the linear growth condition does not hold true in general since the norm of a superposition does not grow linearly with the norm of the inner function ( cf .",
    "proposition [ admissible ] , corollary [ admissible1 ] and remark [ first ] ) .    in order to deal with",
    ", we proceed in several steps .",
    "first of all , we consider the equation in @xmath5 and apply the banach fixed point theorem to conclude the existence of an @xmath3-valued mild solution .",
    "next , we study the picard iterations as processes having values in sobolev spaces ( @xmath6 and afterwards @xmath7 ) and find suitable uniform estimates which remain valid also for the limit process .    as an immediate consequence of the main result",
    ", we obtain a continuous @xmath8-valued solution . here",
    ", we use the sobolev embedding theorem so the stochastic integration in banach spaces ( see @xcite , @xcite ) , i.e. @xmath7 , allows us to weaken the smoothness assumptions on coefficients .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we review the basic setting and state our main result . in section 3",
    ", we collect important preliminary results related to superposition operators . in the final section ,",
    "these results are applied and the proof of the main theorem is established .",
    "this work was motivated by our research in the field of degenerate parabolic spdes of second order ( see @xcite ) , where smooth solutions of certain approximate nondegenerate problems were needed in order to derive the so - called kinetic formulation and to obtain kinetic solution . nevertheless , since the regularity result of the present paper",
    "is based on properties of strongly elliptic operators , generalization to higher order equations does not cause any additional problems .",
    "let us first introduce the notation which will be used later on . we will consider periodic boundary conditions : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the @xmath11-dimensional torus .",
    "the sobolev spaces on @xmath10 will be denoted by @xmath12 and by @xmath13 we will denote the space of all functions @xmath14 such that @xmath15    we now give the precise assumptions on each of the terms appearing in the above equation .",
    "we will work on a finite - time interval @xmath16,\\,t>0.$ ] the operator @xmath1 is a strongly elliptic differential operator of order @xmath17 with variable coefficients of class @xmath18 .",
    "let us assume , in addition , that @xmath1 is formally symmetric and positive , i.e. we assume that @xmath19 belongs to the resolvent set of @xmath1 .",
    "as an example of this operator let us mention for instance the second order differential operator in divergence form given by @xmath20 where the coefficients @xmath21 are real - valued smooth functions and satify the uniform ellipticity condition , i.e. there exists @xmath22 such that @xmath23    let us now collect basic facts concerning strongly elliptic differential operators satisfying our hypotheses ( for a detailed exposition we refer the reader to @xcite ) .",
    "set @xmath24 .",
    "then the linear unbounded operator @xmath25 in @xmath26 defined by @xmath27 is the infinitesimal generator of a bounded analytic semigroup on @xmath26 .",
    "let us denote this semigroup by @xmath28 .",
    "fractional powers of @xmath29 are well defined and their domains correspond to classical sobolev spaces ( see ( * ? ? ?",

    "the diffusion coefficient @xmath4 is then defined as @xmath51 where the functions @xmath52 satisfy the following linear growth condition @xmath53    since we are going to solve in @xmath26 , for @xmath32 , we need to ensure the existence of the stochastic integral as an @xmath26-valued process .",
