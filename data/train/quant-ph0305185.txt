    "in quantum theory , measurements encapsulate our observation of nature .",
    "they are the link between the abstract machinery of the theory and its observational consequences . because of this",
    ", it is not surprising that often new measurement techniques and strategies can drive new applications .",
    "moreover , the production of conditional quantum states and quantum operations based on the results of measurement is now seen as a key tool in realizing quantum information processing goals @xcite . in optical schemes ,",
    "conditional measurements provide an effective nonlinearity that allows optical quantum gates to be fashioned @xcite , and the creation of highly entangled states suitable for quantum metrology @xcite .",
    "often , however , the ideal measurements envisioned in theoretical proposals are not so easily realized experimentally .",
    "linear optics quantum computation schemes such as in  @xcite , require high efficiency _ selective _ detectors ( detectors able to distinguish between zero , one and several photons ) .",
    "the most promising detector candidate in this regard is the visible - light photon counter ( vlpc ) @xcite which has achieved efficiencies of the order of 88% .",
    "unfortunately these detectors require extreme operating conditions and suffer from high dark - count rates .    in this manuscript",
    "we introduce the idea of a non - deterministic detector based on _ photon added detection _ ( pad ) , where we make use of high efficiency homodyne detection and mix the input state with an @xmath1 fock state prior to detection .",
    "this detector works non - deterministically , and there is an essential trade - off between the probability that the detector works and the degree to which the detector functions as an @xmath0-fock state projector .",
    "when the detector fails , this is clearly signalled in the output .",
    "the essence of the detecting scheme is based on the observation that if we use homodyne detection and post - select within a narrow band of @xmath2 around @xmath3 then the detection will only be sensitive to even photon numbers , see figure  [ fig : pxn ] . by careful use of quantum interference",
    ", we can make the detector act like a projector onto a particular photon number .     value if we measure the @xmath4 quadrature using homodyne detection .",
    "results shown for various initial fock states . ]",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows .",
    "first we will introduce the scheme in general , then focus on the limiting case where @xmath5 to motivate its function .",
    "we then consider the effect of a finite @xmath6 and discuss the trade off between probability of operation and fidelity . finally , before concluding , we examine the effect of detector inefficiencies in our scheme .",
    "in order to characterise how well the detector functions we shall calculate the ability of the detector to pick out an appropriate state @xmath7 from an entangled state of the form @xmath8 when we measure mode @xmath9 . the normalisation is @xmath10 , and the parameter @xmath11 defines a window of states , from which we want to pick out the central component .",
    "the reason for choosing this comparison is two - fold .",
    "firstly we are interested in states precisely of the above form where the states @xmath12 represent multi - mode states which we are conditioning by detection and post - selection .",
    "secondly , this approach provides an easily computable measure of how close to a @xmath13 projector the detector functions in this context , since this approach reduces to a characterisation of state preparation @xcite .        with this characterisation in mind , consider the circuit in figure  [ fig : det ] .",
    "we have some multi - mode state @xmath14 and we wish to condition the state of mode(s ) @xmath15 dependent on a photon number measurement on mode @xmath9 . for simplicity consider only a single @xmath0-photon fock state component in mode @xmath9 , the general case is recovered through additivity , i.e. @xmath16 . the input state is then some state @xmath17 , where @xmath12 is the associated component in mode @xmath15 and mode @xmath18 is initially in a @xmath19-photon fock state . after interacting on a beam - splitter of reflectivity @xmath20 and undergoing a phase shift @xmath21 on mode @xmath9 the output state is @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the bosonic creation operators for modes @xmath9 and @xmath18 respectively , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and finally we also have the usual binomial coefficients @xmath27 .    modes @xmath9 and @xmath18 are now detected using separate balanced homodyne detectors . to an excellent approximation",
    "such detectors can be modeled as projectors onto small ranges of quadrature amplitude eigenstates @xmath28 where @xmath29 is a continuous variable with infinite dimension , and @xmath30 describes the phase relationship with the local oscillator of the homodyne detector .",
    "the final conditional state ( unnormalised ) , given we obtain @xmath29 in one detector and @xmath31 in the other , is @xmath32 where , @xmath33 where we have used the fact that the overlap between the quadrature amplitude eigenstates and the number states is given by @xmath34 and @xmath35 is the hermite polynomial of order @xmath0 .",
    "we have chosen the convention that the @xmath36 quadrature operator can be written in terms of the mode operators as @xmath37 .",
    "notice that the quadrature phase angles @xmath30 and @xmath38 are effectively not independent of @xmath21 and that without loss of generality we can absorb those terms into @xmath21 ( so we will take @xmath39 ) .",
    "for simplicity we shall also take @xmath40 and set the overall phase of this component to zero , and hence we can also drop the quadrature angle subscript on @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "now consider the case where we use a 50:50 beam - splitter so that @xmath43 and we set @xmath44 . with these conditions equation  ( [ eq : psi_cond ] )",
    "reduces to @xmath45    to see how this detecting scheme is only sensitive to the @xmath19-fock component we focus on the limiting case of @xmath5 next .",
    "consider only the special case where we happen to detect @xmath46 in the homodyne detectors .",
    "for these values , we can use @xmath47 this relation implies that only terms with even @xmath48 will be non - zero , which in turn implies that @xmath49 must be even also . if we now write @xmath50/2 $ ] where @xmath51 simply has the order of the summations reversed , we get @xmath52 where we have set @xmath53 and used the fact that @xmath48 must be even . from this expression",
    "it is clear that terms with odd @xmath54 will also vanish .",
    "terms with even @xmath55 will also vanish  this can be readily verified numerically .",
    "this then only leaves the terms with @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) as contributing to the state  ( [ eq : psi_cond_simple ] ) and so the detector picks out the @xmath7 component .",
    "this analysis assumes an infinitesimal acceptance band for the detector . in order to assess the practicalities of the system we need to integrate over some range of values around @xmath46 and evaluate success and failure probabilities .",
    "clearly there will be a tradeoff between how well we project onto the @xmath19-photon fock state and the probability of obtaining a successful outcome .",
    "the probability density for obtaining a value @xmath41 in mode @xmath18 and @xmath42 in mode @xmath9 will be @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the three mode density matrix describing the state after the beam - splitter .",
    "this distribution is radially symmetric about the origin , so we will switch to the polar co - ordinates @xmath60 and @xmath30 ( where @xmath61 ) and accept a particular result if it lies within a certain radius @xmath6 .",
    "intuitively we can see what the effect will be from figure  [ fig : density ] .",
    "as we make @xmath6 larger , the probability that a result falls within the accepted band , picks up contributions from nearby states to the target state , and these will contribute to the error .",
    "the total probability that we get @xmath62 is @xmath63 the ( unnormalised ) state immediately after destructively obtaining a particular @xmath41 and @xmath42 in the first two modes is @xmath64 .",
    "consequently the ensemble of states that we would obtain if we where to only accept values within a radius @xmath6 , would be @xmath65    , between two successive window sizes , @xmath11 and @xmath66 . as can be seen , increasing the size of the window of states we are testing against makes little difference past a few states , consequently we will adopt @xmath67 in calculations .",
    "note that @xmath68 in the plots . ]    to compare how well such a projector functions we can use the fidelity against the target state @xmath7 : @xmath69 note that in calculating this quantity we will assume that the @xmath70 are orthonormal .",
    "one of the important features of the pad scheme is that it is sensitive only to a band of number states near the target state .",
    "this effect can be seen in the behaviour of the probability densities for states far away from the target state in figure  [ fig : density ] , and is clearly demonstrated in figure  [ fig : win - converge ] , where we show the rapid convergence in fidelity as we increase the number of nearby states to the one we are projecting out .",
    "as we increase @xmath6 , the probability that we get a result we will accept also increases , but due to the overlap with the states near the target state the fidelity of the detector will drop .",
    "the actual probability is not a meaningful quantity in this context as it depends as much on the test state ( [ eq : test - state ] ) as on the parameters of the detector .",
    "the quantity we will use instead is a probability rate @xmath71 , which is the probability we get divided by the expected probability if we had an ideal photo - counter .",
    "the tradeoff between fidelity and probability is quantified in figure  [ fig : rates ] .     from the distributions ( [ eq : test - state ] ) is given ( with @xmath67 ) .",
    "the curves are for fixed probability rates @xmath72 . ]",
    "the calculations so far have assumed unit efficiency detection . in this section",
    "we explore the effect of non - unit detection efficiencies for the pad , although it should be noted from the outset that detection efficiency for homodyne detection is very high ( in the region of 98% @xcite ) .",
    "we will compare the performance of the pad to an ideal , but inefficient photon counter , which we model by the povm elements @xmath73 , where @xmath19 is the number of detected photons , with @xmath74 visible - light photon counters can be modelled as ideal , but inefficient photon counters , at least for small photon numbers @xcite .",
    "the fidelity of the ideal detector in picking out the state @xmath7 when used with the input state  ( [ eq : test - state ] ) is then @xmath75 where the summation extends to the maximum photon number , so for the test state in ( [ eq : test - state ] ) @xmath76 .    for the pad detector we can model inefficiencies simply by considering a beam splitter of transitivity @xmath77 in front of both homodyne detectors @xcite .",
    "the first observation we make is that for high efficiency , the ideal detector obtains a higher fidelity .",
    "the trend with higher photon number is similar for both detectors . where the advantage lies for the pad is that the efficiency for current homodyne detectors is very high compared with available photon counters .",
    "for a particular @xmath6 and @xmath77 we can consider an equivalent ideal detector that gives the same fidelity .",
    "constructing an equivalence in this fashion is particularly useful and was considered by @xcite where they compared an ideal photon counter with homodyne detection in the context of quantum communication .",
    "as such , they used the mutual information as a means of comparison .",
    "for our scheme , we envision state preparation as the main application so we will use the fidelity as a means of comparison . this comparison is plotted in figure  [ fig : equic ] , for the ability to project out the state @xmath78 from the input state @xmath79 . a detector able to achieve this projection forms a _ selective _ detector which is needed in many linear optics schemes .    , and the homodyne efficiency @xmath77 . ]",
    "because of it s non - deterministic nature , we envision applications of this detector mainly in state preparation , where non - classical states are prepared through conditioning on photon number detection . we could prepare a good approximation to an @xmath1 photon state required by our detector , by using spontaneous parametric down conversion and a detector cascade in one arm . even if the detectors in the cascade are inefficient , if , say three detectors register a click , then we have at least a three photon term in the other arm .",
    "the errors caused by having more than the required number of photons are offset by the low probability of such events .",
    "one intriguing possibility is to employ this detector in a proposal by dakna , _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite . in the dakna scheme ,",
    "a good approximation to an optical schrdinder cat state is generated by mixing a single mode squeezed state on a beam - splitter with the vacuum and conditioning on detecting a certain number of photons in one of the exit ports .",
    "we have presented a non - deterministic scheme which functions as a high - fidelity fock state projector .",
    "this detecting scheme allows a tunable tradeoff between the fidelity and probability of detection .",
    "the weaknesses of the scheme are that it requires an @xmath1 photon state and that it is non - deterministic .",
    "the @xmath1 photon state could be prepared in the first instance simply by conditioning the output of a spontaneous parametric down converter with a traditional detector cascade .",
    "the non - deterministic nature of the scheme leads us to conclude that the main application for the detector will be in state generation .",
