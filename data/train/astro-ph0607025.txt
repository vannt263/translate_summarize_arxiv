    "in a high mass x - ray binary ( hmxb ) , a compact object , either a neutron star or a black hole , sweeps up material as it orbits through the stellar wind of a massive o- or b - type companion star .",

    "the continuum from the neutron star is highly absorbed during phase 0.5 whereas the absorption column density is reduced during phase 0.25 .",

    "the average continuum intensities are nearly identical during the two phase ranges .",
    "the presence of strong soft x - ray lines during phase 0.5 , however , suggests that this absorber is localized and does not cover the x - ray emission line regions , which most likely extend beyond the size of the absorber .",
    "the emission lines during phase 0.50 is approximately an order of magnitude brighter than those during eclipse .",
    "this indicates that a significant fraction of the x - ray line emission is produced in a region between the neutron star and the companion star , which is occulted during eclipse .",
    "the velocity shifts and widths provide additional constraints on the properties of the emission region .",
    "the measured doppler shifts of @xmath18  km  s@xmath1 are much smaller than the terminal velocity of vela x-1 ( @xmath19  km  s@xmath1 ; @xcite ) . for a @xcite stellar wind velocity profile of isolated ob stars ,",

    "the doppler broadening of emission lines is also small ( @xmath20  km  s@xmath1 ) .",
    "these observational results shows that the emission site of lines from highly ionized ions is distributed on a plane between the neutron star and the companion star , with most of the emission coming from near the line of centers .",
    "finally , the detection of a narrow radiative recombination continuum from h - like ne during phase 0.5 and in eclipse with electron temperatures of 68  ev provides direct evidence that the emission lines from highly ionized gas in vela x-1 are driven through photoionization .",
    "other possible sources of mechanical heating are , therefore , not important in characterizing the ionization structure of at least the highly - ionized regions of the stellar wind .",
    "the x - ray emission lines detected from vela x-1 can be interpreted as due to emission from a gas photoionized by the continuum radiation from the neutron star . when line photons are created through recombination cascades following photoionization",
    ", they interact with the surrounding gas as they propagate out of the binary system , and this is controlled by the ionization structure and the density distribution of the gas in the stellar wind .",
    "therefore , by investigating the properties of the emission lines , we can infer the physical conditions , geometrical distribution , and the velocity structure of the wind .    in order to compute the ionization structure and to reproduce the wealth of information provided by the high - resolution hetgs  spectra , it is necessary to model the emission using realistic physical models of the stellar wind in a binary system .",
    "we have developed three - dimensional monte carlo radiative transfer code to simulate the interactions of x - rays with the particles in the stellar wind .",

    "our detailed procedures are described in the following subsections .",
    "the ionization balance and electron temperature are determined primarily by the particle density and the local flux and spectral shape of the ionizing x - rays .",
    "we compute the three - dimensional ionization structure by first dividing the binary system into square cells of equal size . since the system is assumed to be cylindrically symmetric along the line of centers , we compute the ion fractions and temperatures on a two - dimensional grid as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : geom_grid ] .",
    "each cell is @xmath21  cm along the side and the system consists of @xmath22 cells .",
    "the density structure around the companion star is specified from the velocity profile determined from the uv observation and an assumed mass - loss rate , which is treated as a free parameter .",
    "this assigns a particle density to each of the cells .",
    "the intrinsic luminosity and spectrum shape of the x - ray source as determined from the observed spectrum are then placed in the cell where the neutron star is located .",
    "the ion fractions and the electron temperatures of the cells immediately surrounding the neutron star are computed using this initial continuum shape as the input ionizing radiation field .",
    "the computation moves outwards to the next layer of cells , this time , using a different continuum shape , which accounts for absorption by the inner cells .",
    "this procedure continues until the outermost cells are reached .",
    "we have use the xstar program to calculate the ion fractions h , he , c , n , o , ne , mg , si , s , ar , ca , and fe , and the electron temperature in each cell .",
    "a flowchart of the procedures is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sim_scheme1 ] .",
    "this procedure ignores the diffuse radiation field as the source of additional ionization , which is a small contributor to the total photoionization rate at least for the ions observed in our spectra .",
    "a more accurate treatment of this effect might involve an iterative scheme , which is not necessary for our present analysis , but may be important for extremely optically thick media .",
    "the map of the ion fractions calculated by the method described in the previous subsection assures equilibrium between photoionization and recombination .",
    "we then use this ionization structure to propagate again the continuum photons originating from the neutron star to compute the emitted x - ray spectra as a function of the orbital phase .",
    "this is done by accounting for radiative transfer effects in detail and using monte carlo methods as described below .",
    "the cells are set up somewhat differently from those used in the calculation of the ionization structure .",
    "the cells sizes are chosen so that each of them are not optically thick to the strongest resonance lines .",
    "smaller cells are required near the companion star where both the density and density gradient are high , and we choose cubic cell sizes of @xmath21  cm on each side .",
    "the cells are increased in size outwards and the outermost cells of the simulation space are larger by a factor of 7.5 compared to the inner ones as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : geom_grid ] .",
    "we start the monte carlo simulation with a photon at the position of the central neutron star .",
    "the photon energy is drawn from the observed power - law spectral energy distribution and is initially given a random direction .",
    "this photon is then traced through the cells and interacts with the ions in the stellar wind , which then generates a secondary photon through radiative recombination , radiative transitions , and fluorescent emission .",
    "all of the photons including those from the central continuum and subsequent line photons produced by interactions are propagated until they either completely escape the simulation space or are destroyed by one of the physical processes described below .",
    "the emergent photons are then selected depending on the viewing angle of the system , and are finally histogrammed to produce a spectrum .    when a photon interacts with a particle , one of three physical processes is allowed to occur : ( 1 ) photoionization , ( 2 ) photoexcitation , and ( 3 ) compton scattering . for a given photon energy , the absorption and scattering cross sections and",
    "hence the optical depths are calculated for each ion within a given cell .",
    "interaction probabilities are then assigned to each possible process and are drawn via monte carlo .",
    "although process ( 1 ) produces a free electron and process ( 3 ) changes the energy of a free electron , we do not trace them in our simulations , but instead simply assume that they are thermalized before any further interaction takes place .    as mentioned earlier",
    ", we assume that photoionization equilibrium is established locally everywhere in the plasma .",
    "therefore , photoionization of h- or he - like ions is always followed by radiative recombination and radiative cascades to the ground level . for ions of lower charge states ,",
    "k - shell photoionization is followed by either fluorescent emission or auger decay .",
    "after photoexcitation , the ion in an excited state produces one or more photons in the downward radiative transitions that eventually lead to the ground level . by the combination of the photoexcitation and the downward radiative transitions ,",
    "the resonance scattering of the lines is incorporated in the monte carlo simulation .    for the h - like and he - like ions ,",
    "we compute all of the atomic quantities with the flexible atomic code ( fac ) .",
    "this includes energy levels , oscillator strengths , radiative decay rates , photoionization cross sections from all levels between the ground state up to @xmath23 .",
    "radiative recombination rates onto each of levels as a function of the electron temperature are also computed from the photoionization cross sections using the milne relation .",
    "collisional transfers and uv photoexcitations in the he - like ions are not included in the current version of the code .",
    "photoionization of ions with three or more electrons de - excites by either an emission of fluorescent photon or ejection of one or more auger electrons .",
    "the k - shell photoionization cross sections are computed using the fitting formulae provided by @xcite , which roughly accounts for the change in the k - edge energy and cross section as functions of the charge state .",
    "the fluorescence yields and k@xmath10 energies , however , are assumed to be fixed for a given element and their values are adopted from @xcite and @xcite , respectively , for neutral atoms .",
    "we also do not account for k - shell ionization of li - like ions , which can lead to the production of the he - like forbidden line .",
    "we use l - shell cross sections from epdl97 , which is also valid for neutral atoms .",
    "the l@xmath24 , l@xmath25 and l@xmath26-shell cross sections are taken into account for the ions with three , five , and six electrons , respectively . finally , we do not include l - shell fluorescent emission , since the yields are typically much smaller compared to the k - shell fluorescence yields .",
    "we consider compton scattering only by free electrons , which is an excellent approximation for highly ionized media .",
    "the differential cross section is given by the the klein - nishina formula and the electrons velocities are drawn from a maxwellian distribution with the local electron temperature .",
    "doppler shifts due to the motion of the stellar wind are accounted for in all of the processes .",
    "when a photon enters a cell , the cross sections are calculated for the photon energy in the co - moving frame and lorentz transformed back into the rest frame .",
    "the doppler shifts could affect the line strength through the resonance line scattering .",

    "the lack of obvious discrete spectral features at phase 0.25 is consistent with the model predictions , which show p - cygni lines with comparable emission and absorption equivalent widths and are therefore washed out after convolution with the spectral response .",
    "we note that the additional absorption component observed at phase 0.50 does not appear to be affecting the emission lines , which implies that this absorber is localized to a small region along the line of centers and in front of the neutron star at phase 0.5 .",

    "all of the simulated line intensities are within the observed values to within a factor of @xmath73 .",

    "if there is an additional absorption of 10% of the assumed value , the intensities of ne lines are reduced to @xmath4  50% .",
    "additionally , the absorption cross sections are very sensitive to the ionization degree of the absorption matter .      fluorescence emission lines , in particular the bright iron line complex , provide information about the distribution of cold material around the x - ray source .",
    "figure  [ fig : vela_fek ] shows the iron k@xmath10 line spectrum at the three orbital phases , together with the models obtained from the simulations described in the previous subsection . during eclipse ,",
    "the iron k@xmath10 line intensity calculated from the simulation is consistent with the observed one .",
    "therefore , it seems likely that the iron k@xmath10 line observed in eclipse is produced in the cool regions of the extended stellar wind . on the other hand , we find that this same model can not explain the observed intensity of the k@xmath10 line in the other two phases .",
    "the equivalent widths from the simulations are only 4  ev and 11  ev for phases 0.25 and 0.50 , whereas the observed values are 51  ev and 116  ev , respectively .",
    "as an obvious source of additional line production regions , we first consider the surface of the companion star .",
    "using monte carlo simulations and adopting the geometrical parameters listed in table  [ tbl : simparams ] , we obtain reflected iron k@xmath10 equivalent widths of 29  ev and 65  ev during phase 0.25 and phase 0.50 , respectively , assuming that the metal abundance of the companion star is also 0.75 times the cosmic value .",
    "therefore , the stellar wind and the companion surface combined yield equivalent widths of 33  ev ( phase 0.25 ) and 76  ev ( phase 0.50 ) .",
    "the observed values are still in excess these values by 18  ev and 40  ev at phase 0.25 and 0.5 , respectively .",
    "we note the presence of excess absorption of @xmath75  =  1.7  @xmath2  10@xmath76  @xmath47 observed during phase 0.5 relative to that at phase 0.25 .",
    "this suggests that a distribution of cold localized material lies along the line of centers somewhere behind the neutron star as viewed from the companion .",
    "we therefore expect that at least some amount of fe - k line photons are produced in this cloud .",
    "this has already been pointed out by @xcite using the _ tenma _ data .    in order to estimate the contribution of the cloud to the iron line flux",
    ", we have performed a monte carlo simulation of a partially covered cloud irradiated by an x - ray source .",
    "the geometrical configuration is shown schematically in fig .",

    "the thickness of the cloud is assumed to be @xmath77  @xmath47 and we assume a uniform density .",
    "the cloud is assumed to be neutral and its metal abundance is set to 0.75 cosmic .",
    "the resulting emission spectra as functions of the orbital phase with the solid angle as the free parameter are computed through the same procedures as in the previous simulations , and the simulated fe k@xmath10 line equivalent widths are measured at the three orbital phases .",
    "figure  [ fig : eqw_cover ] shows the relation between the solid angle subtended by the cloud and the iron line equivalent width . as can be seen from this figure , the missing equivalent widths outside of eclipse ( 18  ev at phase 0.25 and 40  ev at phase 0.50 ) can be explained if the cloud covers 2540  % of the sky as viewed from the neutron star .",
    "although this geometrical configuration may be oversimplified , its general characteristics are consistent with the fact that the spectrum observed at phase 0.25 does not exhibit heavy absorption and the fact that soft x - ray lines are still observed during phase 0.5 .",
    "@xcite reported a gradual increase of average absorption column density between orbital phase @xmath78 and @xmath79 from @xmath75  @xmath80  1  @xmath2  10@xmath81  @xmath47 to @xmath75  @xmath80  3  @xmath2  10@xmath76  @xmath47 observed in the _ tenma _ data of vela x-1 .",
    "the enhanced absorption at orbital phase 0.50 , and the localized cloud responsible for the iron line production can be attributed to an `` accretion wake '' , which is produced by a combination of several physical effects , including gravitational , rotational , and radiation pressure forces , and x - ray heating .",
    "numerical simulations by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite exhibit such structures trailing the accreting neutron star .",
    "when the observed line profiles of a few of the brightest lines are compared with the output of the monte carlo simulations , we find that there is a mismatch in the average velocity shift at both phase 0.5 and eclipse .",
    "figure  [ fig : comparison_doppler ] shows comparison of the observed and ly@xmath10 lines with the simulations convolved with the instrument response .",
    "although the sign of the shifts are correct , the simulations seem to predict a larger velocity shift than seen in in the data .",
    "figure  [ fig : dopplershift ] shows the velocity shifts for all of the bright highly ionized emission lines detected in the spectrum .",
    "the average velocity shifts ( @xmath82 ) observed between phase 0.5 and eclipse lie range in @xmath4  300600  km  s@xmath1 whereas the simulations predict @xmath83  1000  km  s@xmath1 , which is larger approximately by a factor of two .",
    "one of the most obvious candidate mechanisms that is capable of reducing the wind velocity is x - ray photoionization . in the cak - model of isolated ob stars ,",
    "a stellar wind is driven by the radiation force on the large number of resonance lines that lie in the uv .",
    "in particular , the dominant ions that are responsible for this are the l - shell ions of c , n and o , which have strong valence shell transitions in the uv range and have large abundances compared to the other metals .    in hmxbs , there are regions in the stellar wind where x - ray photoionization destroys the l - shell ions of c , n , and o into k - shell ions and , therefore , reduce the amount of radiative force .",
    "this effect is maximized near the neutron star where the x - ray flux is high and which also happens to coincide with the region where the wind would otherwise be accelerated in the absence of the x - ray source . as a result",
    ", the stellar wind velocity within this region should be lower than that predicted by the cak - model .",
    "the effect of x - ray irradiation on line - driven stellar winds in hmxb  systems has been studied theoretically by @xcite and @xcite , and they have also been seen in uv spectral observations @xcite .      in order to investigate how the stellar wind velocity is affected due to x - ray ionization , we have performed a simple one - dimensional calculation to estimate the velocity profile along the line of centers .",
    "the extension of this calculation to three - dimensions is required to self - consistently incorporate into the monte carlo simulator and predict the emission line spectra , which is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "nevertheless , as we show below , this estimate in 1-d is still useful for understanding semi - quantitatively the mismatch between the observed and predicted velocity shifts .    in this calculation , we make two simplifying assumptions .",
    "we first assume that the wind is driven radiatively by uv resonance absorption and that there are no other relevant forces that provide additional acceleration .",
    "the other assumption is that the force is proportional to the local number densities of c , n and o ions with more than one electron in the l - shell ( i.e. , li - like and lower charge states ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : cakmodel_v_f_r ] shows the velocity as a function of distance along the line of centers in the cak - model and the radiative force , which is numerically derived from the cak - model velocity structure .",
    "as can been seen from these figures , the radiation force peaks in the region between the companion star surface and the location of the neutron star .",
    "this is , however , the region where most of the x - ray lines are produced in this system .",
    "therefore , the acceleration of the stellar wind in this region must be reduced since the c , n , and o ions inside this region are primarily h - like , he - like , or fully - stripped , and they alone can not provide the force required to maintain the acceleration .",
    "we estimate the magnitude of this effect as follows .",
    "we start with the cakvelocity profile , which has an implicit assumption about the force as a function of distance , and can calculate the density everywhere in the wind .",
    "this can then be used to derive the ionization structure and , in particular , the distribution of c , n , and o ions , which provides an estimate of the new force and hence the velocity profile .",
    "this process can be repeated and iterated to find an ionization structure that is self - consistent with the velocity profile through the following steps ,    1 .",
    "start from the velocity structure ( @xmath84 ( cak - model ) ) , and , calculate a force structure ( @xmath85 ) , then , obtain @xmath86 .",

    "[ fig : velocity_calc ] .",
    "as shown , the solution has converged after the 5th iteration . in this simple model ,",
    "the stellar wind velocity at the point of the neutron star is only @xmath4  180  km  s@xmath1 compared to @xmath4  570  km  s@xmath1 predicted by the cak - model .",
    "this reduction in velocity of @xmath4  390  km  s@xmath1 is remarkably similar to the observed velocity offset between the model and data observed during phase 0.5 , where most of the emission is believed to originate from near the neutron star .",
    "our one dimensional calculations confirm that the photoionization by the x - ray radiation can make the stellar wind near the neutron star slower by a factor of 23 compared to an undisturbed cak  wind .",
    "this results are in agreement with the observed doppler shifts in the emission lines .",
    "the x - ray radiation of the neutron star is disturbing the flow of the cak - model stellar wind in the vela  x-1 system , and then , the velocity of the stellar wind in the highly photoionized region becomes slower than that estimated from cak - model .    in order to understand the flow of stellar wind precisely and",
    "obtain the x - ray spectrum from the photoionized stellar wind , further considerations should be needed .",
    "a three dimensional calculation of the electromagnetic hydrodynamics would be required for a fully quantitative analysis .",
    "the lower velocity of the stellar wind due to the x - ray photoionization leads to a density increase and changes of emission line intensities .",
    "in that case , an adjustment of the mass loss rate could be needed to reproduce the observed spectra . though the mass loss rate is proportional to the density and the velocity , how large the adjustment is required",
    "is not simple .",
    "the neutron star goes around the companion star , and , the photoionized region moves in association with the orbital motion of the neutron star .",
    "it takes about 0.5 days for the stellar wind to reach the position of the neutron star from the surface of the companion star assuming the cak - model .",
    "it is not negligible in comparison to the orbital period of the neutron star ( 8.96 days ) , and , calculations including the time evolution due to the orbital motion are required .",
    "additionally , gas pressure forces not only in the radial directions but along the circumferential directions are important since the stellar wind flow is not spherically symmetry any more .",
    "vela x-1 was observed by the _ chandra _  hetgs  at three distinct orbital phase ranges . in order to understand the geometry and the dynamics of the x - ray irradiated stellar wind in this system ,",
    "we have developed a monte carlo spectral simulator to predict the emission line spectrum for a given set of stellar wind parameters .",
    "the model spectra were then compared to the observed spectra to construct a self - consistent picture that explains the global properties of the x - ray spectra .",
    "the qualitative aspects of this model and its various components are illustrated in fig  [ fig : hmxb_illust ] .",
    "the x - ray emission line intensities of highly ionized h- and he - like ions are well - reproduced by a cak - model of a stellar wind with a mass loss rate of ( 1.52.0 )  @xmath103 and a terminal velocity of 1100  km  s@xmath1 irradiated by the x - ray continuum radiation from the neutron star . through comparisons of the spectra observed at eclipse and at phase 0.50 , we find that most of the x - ray recombination emission lines are produced in the region between the neutron star and the companion star ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : hmxb_illust ] ) where both the gas density and the local x - ray flux are high .",
    "this region is occulted by the companion star during the eclipse phase , which explains the relative strengths of the emission line intensities during phase 0.50 and eclipse .",
    "the same set of model parameters also nicely explains the lack of obvious discrete spectral features observed at phase 0.25 .    the properties of the intense iron fluorescent lines , which are observed throughout the binary orbit , are sensitive to the distribution of cold material relative to the location of the neutron star .",
    "although the iron fluorescent line intensity observed during eclipse can be explained entirely by fluorescence in the extended stellar wind , the line intensities during the other two phases are far brighter than predicted by the same model .",
    "we find that , in addition to the stellar wind and the x - ray irradiated surface of the companion star , a cold cloud partially covering the neutron star is required to explain the data . from the quantitative analysis",
    ", we find that a cloud with a thickness of @xmath77  @xmath47 and covers 2540  % of the solid angle viewed from the neutron star , explains both the iron k@xmath10 line intensities as well as the excess column density observed during phase 0.5 .",
    "the one observed feature that this model fails to reproduce is the velocity shift of the highly - ionized recombination emission lines , which are observed to be smaller in magnitude by several hundred @xmath104 compared to the predictions . using a simple 1-d model",
    ", we find that destruction of uv - absorbing ions by x - ray photoionization can explain this reduction in velocity .",
    "however , the fully self - consistent 3-d model including the x - ray photoionization effect still remains an issue to be resolved .",
    "a full 3-d electromagnetic hydrodynamics calculation including time dependent effects would be required for the further study .    in addition",
    ", there are much more things to be done with this data set .",
    "these include study of the compton shoulder in the iron k line and the ratio of he - like triplet lines , which constrain the physical conditions in the emission region .",
    "there is also much more to be improved in the monte carlo code .",

    "<S> we present results from quantitative modeling and spectral analysis of the high mass x - ray binary system vela x-1 obtained with the _ chandra _  high energy transmission grating spectrometer . </S>",
    "<S> the observations cover three orbital phase ranges within a single binary orbit . </S>",
    "<S> the spectra exhibit emission lines from h - like and he - like ions driven by photoionization , as well as fluorescent emission lines from several elements in lower charge states . </S>",
    "<S> the properties of these x - ray lines are measured with the highest accuracy to date . in order to interpret and make full use of the high - quality data , we have developed a simulator , which calculates the ionization and thermal structure of a stellar wind photoionized by an x - ray source , and performs monte carlo simulations of x - ray photons propagating through the wind . </S>",
    "<S> the emergent spectra are then computed as a function of the viewing angle accurately accounting for photon transport in three dimensions including dynamics . from comparisons of the observed spectra with results from the simulator , </S>",
    "<S> we are able to find the ionization structure and the geometrical distribution of material in the stellar wind of vela x-1 that can reproduce the observed spectral line intensities and continuum shapes at different orbital phases remarkably well . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the stellar wind profile can be represented by a cak - model with a star mass loss rate of ( 1.52.0 )  @xmath0 , assuming a terminal velocity of 1100  km  s@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that a large fraction of x - ray emission lines from highly ionized ions are formed in the region between the neutron star and the companion star . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that the fluorescent x - ray lines must be produced in at least three distinct regions  ( 1 ) the extended stellar wind , ( 2 ) reflection off the stellar photosphere , and ( 3 ) in a distribution of dense material partially covering and possibly trailing the neutron star , which may be associated with an accretion wake . </S>",
    "<S> finally , from detailed analysis of the emission line profiles , we demonstrate that the stellar wind dynamics is affected by x - ray photoionization . </S>"
