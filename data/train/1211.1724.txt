    "feedback control , useful in reducing the effects of noise on quantum dynamical systems  @xcite , can be realized in one of two ways : repeatedly measure the system and apply operations conditional on the measurement results  @xcite , or couple the system to another quantum system ( a `` quantum controller '' ) thus avoiding the use of measurements  @xcite .",
    "this second form of feedback is referred to as _ coherent feedback_.",
    "our motivation here is that numerical optimization performed on linear feedback networks by nurdin , james , and petersen  @xcite showed that coherent feedback can outperform feedback mediated by measurements , but a clear dynamical explanation for this intriguing difference is yet missing .",
    "just recently it has been shown that coherent feedback can do very much better than measurement - based feedback when using a linear interaction to cool a linear oscillator  @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that passing the noise signal through the auxiliary system coherently allows it to cancel the quantum noise in a way that a measured signal can not  @xcite , but it is not obvious how to design protocols to exploit the coherent advantage .",
    "here we present a clear dynamical explanation for the superior performance of coherent feedback , for linear and nonlinear systems .",
    "the task we consider is that of using an auxiliary system to extract all the entropy from a `` target '' system in the shortest time , given that the norm of the interaction hamiltonian between the target system and the auxiliary is bounded .",
    "we show that a coherent protocol can extract all the entropy from the target system faster than any measurement - based protocol .",
    "the reason for this is that the coherent protocol can follow a more efficient path in the state - space .",
    "since entropy extraction is at the heart of all feedback protocols that regulate a system against noise , this result has profound implications .",
    "we expect that the notion of a geodesic , the most efficient path in state - space , will be useful in designing superior continuous - time coherent feedback protocols .",
    "we must first elucidate the precise relationship between measurement - based and coherent control . in doing so",
    "it is conceptually useful to define measurement - based feedback in both a strict sense and a broad sense . to begin , coherent feedback control is a scenario in which a system to be controlled ( the `` target system '' , from now on just `` the system '' ) is coupled to another quantum system ( `` the auxiliary '' ) for the purpose of implementing control .",
    "this scenario is _ feedback _ control so long as the auxiliary has no direct access to the noise driving the system ; in this case all information exploited by the auxiliary must be obtained from the system , and so the process is one of feedback  @xcite .",
    "we do not need an explicit feedback `` loop '' in the definition of feedback for the same reason that there is no explicit loop in the hamiltonian description of the watt governor  @xcite .    in a measurement - based feedback ( mf )",
    "protocol a sequence of measurements is made on the system , and its hamiltonian is modified after each measurement in a manner determined by the measurement result .",
    "we will refer to a single measurement with its subsequent feedback step as a single iteration of an mf protocol .",
    "every quantum measurement can be modeled as an interaction with a probe system , in which each measurement result corresponds to a subspace of the probe .",
    "the subspaces corresponding to the set of all the measurement results are mutually orthogonal . because of this",
    "it is simple to realize feedback within this model : one merely choses a different hamiltonian for the system for each of the orthogonal subspaces .",
    "the result is an implementation of mf using only a coherent interaction between the system and an auxiliary ( in this case the probe ) , and as a result all mf protocols can be implemented using coherent feedback as defined above .",
    "examples of the implementation of measurement - based feedback using unitary operations can be found in , e.g.  @xcite .    while mf is subsumed by coherent feedback ,",
    "the reverse is not true .",
    "the reason for this is that each iteration of an mf protocol is divided into two steps , and the second ( the feedback step ) is restricted to a certain form : an action performed on the system alone that is conditional on a set of mutually orthogonal subspaces of the auxiliary .",
    "if we denote the set of projectors onto the auxiliary subspaces by @xmath0 , then the unitary that acts during the feedback step must have the form @xmath1 where the @xmath2 unitaries @xmath3 act on the system .",
    "further , just prior to the implementation of the feedback step the controller is decohered in the basis @xmath4 .",
    "this decoherence process is part of the definition of measurement , since the possible measurement outcomes are classical numbers that can be recorded by an observer , and thus can not have quantum coherences between them .",
    "the decoherence applies the operation @xmath5 .",
    "we note that in fact the decoherence part of the measurement process is not required for measurement - based feedback , or for our analysis below .    in considering the measurement step of an mf iteration , it is important to note that the general formulation of an efficient quantum measurement implicitly includes feedback .",
    "an efficient measurement is described by a set of operators @xmath6 , where @xmath7 , the probability of the @xmath8 outcome is @xmath9 $ ] , and the state following the measurement is @xmath10 .",
    "every operator @xmath11 can be factored via the polar decomposition theorem as @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is unitary and @xmath14 is positive .",
    "since @xmath13 is unitary it is equivalent to an explicit feedback step applied after a measurement described by the set of operators @xmath15 .",
    "we now have a choice in defining measurement - based feedback . under the strictest definition ,",
    "all unitary actions are restricted to the explicit feedback part , and as a result the measurement must be described by a set of positive operators .",
    "measurements in this class we will refer to as being `` bare ''  @xcite , and we will refer to the class of mf protocols for which the measurements are bare as _ strict - sense _ mf .",
    "many real feedback protocols belong to this class .",
    "strict - sense mf is a significantly smaller class of protocols than coherent feedback because the unitary operators are restricted in both steps .",
    "our primary result is that this restriction reduces the speed at which certain joint operations can be performed .",
    "it is also important to consider how our result impacts measurement - based feedback control when defined in the broadest sense .",
    "that is , when we allow the measurement step to include any generalized measurement .",
    "while the measurement step can now perform _ any _ coherent feedback process , the distinction between mf and coherent feedback ( cf ) remains , due to the fact that an mf protocol is only a feedback protocol if the feedback step contributes to ( improves ) the performance of the control .",
    "since the geodesic path for our task can not be broken into a measurement and feedback step , the feedback part of the protocol can not follow this geodesic .",
    "measurement - based feedback can therefore only follow the shortest path when the feedback step vanishes .",
    "_ * the task : * _ to take an @xmath16-state system that is initially in an arbitrary mixed state to a specified pure state in the shortest time .",
    "this simple control task is a central element of a large number of control problems , because the faster a continuous - time protocol can reduce the entropy of a system the lower the resulting steady - state noise .    _ * the constraint on the speed of control : * _ we impose the physically relevant constraint that the norm of the interaction hamiltonian , @xmath17 , between the system and auxiliary is bounded . specifically , we bound the difference between the maximum and minimum eigenvalues of @xmath17 by @xmath18",
    ". the fact we choose this particular norm does not further restrict the generality of the result , since all norms in a finite dimensional space are equivalent .",
    "the reason that we chose this norm is because the constant @xmath19 has a clear physical meaning .",
    "it is the maximal speed of rotation that the hamiltonian can generate in hilbert space .",
    "we state this as a theorem , which is proved in  @xcite :    [ th::ensforrho ] let @xmath20 and @xmath21 be two orthogonal quantum states . if the difference between the maximum and minimum eigenvalues of a hamiltonian @xmath17 is @xmath22 , then i ) the fastest way that @xmath17 can transform @xmath20 to a state @xmath23 is via the path @xmath24 .",
    "this path also has the shortest length between the two states , and is therefore a _",
    "geodesic_. ii ) the minimum time required for the transformation is @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the angle between the initial and final state - vectors .",
    "iii ) the term in @xmath17 that is required to generate the transformation @xmath27 is @xmath28    in addition to the above theorem , to obtain the optimal protocols below we will need an answer to the following question . if we wish to transform a single state , @xmath29 , to one of a set of @xmath16 orthogonal states , what is the minimum time required ?",
    "more precisely , how small can we make the distance ( the angle of rotation ) to the state that is furthest from @xmath29 ? the following lemma answers this question .",
    "[ lemm1 ] consider an arbitrary state @xmath29 and a set of @xmath16 orthogonal states @xmath30 , @xmath31 .",
    "denote the @xmath16 angles between @xmath29 and each of the states @xmath30 by @xmath32 , and the largest of these angles by @xmath33 .",
    "if we are allowed complete freedom in choosing the set of orthogonal states @xmath34 , then the smallest value of @xmath33 we can achieve is @xmath35 and this is only achieved when @xmath29 is unbiased with respect to the states @xmath34 .",
    "that is , when @xmath36 , @xmath37 .    since the states @xmath34",
    "are orthogonal , @xmath38 where @xmath39 is orthogonal to all the @xmath30 .",
    "we have also @xmath40 .",
    "now let us take @xmath29 to be unbiased with respect to the set @xmath34 . in this case",
    "@xmath41 for every @xmath42 .",
    "now , since @xmath43 for every orthogonal set @xmath34 , if we increase the moduli of any of the @xmath44 we must reduce at least one other of these moduli , thus increasing one of the angles @xmath45 above the value @xmath46 .",
    "the value of @xmath33 can therefore be no less than @xmath46 .    combining the above theorem and lemma ,",
    "the minimum time required to transform a single state to any one of @xmath16 mutually orthogonal states , under the hamiltonian constraint above , is @xmath47 .",
    "how fast can strict - sense mf perform our task ?",
    "well , for the bare measurement to prepare the system in a pure state each of the measurement operators must be a rank - one projector .",
    "we can therefore write the measurement operators as @xmath48 for some set of @xmath49 states @xmath50 that span the @xmath16-dimensional space of the system . to realize this measurement the interaction with the auxiliary system , followed by decoherence in an auxiliary basis that we will denote by @xmath51 , must prepare the joint system in the form @xmath52 since the auxiliary starts in a single pure state , by lemma 1 the minimum angle required to rotate this state to each of the @xmath49 basis states @xmath30 is @xmath46 . the minimum value of @xmath49 is @xmath16 , and so the minimum angle is @xmath53 .",
    "this gives us the minimum time for the measurement step .    to leave the system in a single pure state",
    ", the feedback step must rotate each of the states @xmath50 to this state .",
    "if the set @xmath54 were a basis , then our lemma above would tell us that the minimal angle required to rotate all of them to the final pure state would be @xmath53 .",
    "but the @xmath50 need not be orthogonal . not surprisingly the minimum angle is still @xmath53 for an arbitrary set of states that decomposes the @xmath16-dimensional identity operator , but it is a little more involved to prove .",
    "we now extend lemma 1 to this case .    _ * extending lemma 1 : * _ let us assume that each of the @xmath49 states @xmath50 has an overlap , @xmath55 , with the state @xmath56 , that is greater than or equal to @xmath57 , and that the density matrix @xmath58 is maximally mixed . since the probability for being in the state @xmath56 is @xmath59 , we must have @xmath60 . since @xmath61 by assumption , we must have @xmath62 , with equality if and only if @xmath63 for all @xmath42 .",
    "now consider the probability that the state of the system is not @xmath56 , which is @xmath64 , and is given by @xmath65 . since @xmath66 , @xmath67 can only be equal to @xmath68 if @xmath69 , and from the analysis above , if none of the @xmath70 are less than @xmath71 , this can only be true if all the @xmath70 are equal to @xmath71 .",
    "we can therefore conclude that at least one of the overlaps @xmath55 must be no greater than @xmath57 .",
    "since our protocol must prepare the system in a desired pure state , @xmath56 , for every initial state , in determining the requirements for the protocol , we have the freedom to chose this initial state .",
    "we will assume that the initial state is maximally mixed , as this will simplify our analysis . a theorem by ando states that for any bare measurement , the density matrix @xmath72 satisfies @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the von neumann entropy  @xcite . since @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the identity , we have also @xmath77 .",
    "we can therefore conclude from the extension of lemma 1 above that the minimum angle required to rotate each of the @xmath50 to @xmath56 is the same as that required by the measurement step , being @xmath53 .",
    "the fastest measurement - based feedback protocol therefore take a time of @xmath78      we first consider a straightforward state - swapping protocol , which we will find is not optimal , but is faster than all measurement - based protocols for @xmath79 .",
    "we can prepare the system in a pure state by bringing up an auxiliary that is already in a pure state , and swapping the states of the two systems .",
    "if we denote a basis for the joint system by @xmath80 , meaning the tensor product of system state @xmath81 with auxiliary state @xmath30 , then a swap operation simply swaps the indices of the system and auxiliary states : @xmath82 we can perform a swap by choosing a joint hamiltonian to perform the above transformation for each joint state @xmath83 .",
    "since the initial and final states are orthogonal except when @xmath84 , the hamiltonian must rotate the states through @xmath85 , and thus requires at time of @xmath86    we now show that there is a faster protocol that will also swap the states of the two systems .",
    "we first note that we can perform local unitary transformations on both systems , after the swap has been performed , and this will not affect the entropy transferred by the swap .",
    "we can therefore implement the entropy transfer by using the transformation @xmath87 where @xmath88 and @xmath89 are any bases of the system and auxiliary , respectively .",
    "we now examine what happens when we chose the basis @xmath88 to be unbiased with respect to @xmath90 and @xmath89 to be unbiased with respect to @xmath91 , so that @xmath92 for this new swap operation , for each @xmath93 and @xmath42 the final state @xmath94 is no longer orthogonal to the initial state @xmath83 .",
    "the overlap between the initial and final states is the same for every @xmath93 and @xmath42 , being @xmath95 the time required for this swap operation is therefore @xmath96    we now show that our second swap protocol is optimal .",
    "we first recall that from the proof of lemma 1 we know that if we have @xmath16 positive numbers @xmath97 that sum to a fixed value , then the way to make he smallest of these numbers maximal is to make them all equal .",
    "we now observer that for our protocol to transfer all of the entropy from the system , it must map a full set of basis states , @xmath98 to a single state , @xmath29 . to satisfy unitarity",
    ", this means that the initial state of the auxiliary , which we will denote by @xmath99 , must be rotated to @xmath16 orthogonal states .",
    "denoting these @xmath16 states of the auxiliary by @xmath100 .",
    "the transformation must therefore perform the map @xmath101 to perform this transformation in the shortest time , we need to chose the bases @xmath98 and @xmath100 to maximize the minimum overlap between the initial and final states .",
    "let us denote these @xmath16 overlaps by @xmath102 .",
    "if we write @xmath103 in the basis @xmath104 , and @xmath99 in the basis @xmath100 as @xmath105 then @xmath106 where @xmath107 , @xmath108 , and the inequality is the cauchy - schwartz inequality . to maximize the smallest @xmath97 we need to maximize @xmath67 , which means choosing @xmath109 so that @xmath110 .",
    "we thus maximize the minimum @xmath97 by setting @xmath111 .",
    "the minimum rotation angle required to perform the transformation in eq.([minter ] ) is therefore @xmath112 , and this is achieved by our second protocol above .",
    "we have considered the time required to prepare a system in a pure state under a constraint on the speed of evolution in hilbert space .",
    "we have shown that the fastest measurement - based protocol , defined in the strict sense , takes a time given by eq.([tmeas ] ) , and the optimal protocol takes a shorter time given by eq.([topt ] ) . for an @xmath16-dimensional system",
    "the optimal protocol is faster by a factor of @xmath113 for a single qubit this factor is @xmath114 .",
    "it increases monotonically with @xmath16 , and for large @xmath16 we have @xmath115 while we expect our results to help elucidate situations in which coherent feedback is a better choice than measurement - based feedback , we also expect that they will help in the design of coherent feedback protocols",
    ". it may be useful to consider the ideal transformation that will perform the desired task , and then consider implementing this transformation using geodesics .",
    "firstly our analysis suggests that when designing coherent feedback protocols , translating measurement - based protocols directly into coherent protocols is not the best approach . as an example , the design of coherent protocols that implement quantum error correction ( qec ) is a natural candidate for such an approach  @xcite .",
    "the process of correcting errors in quantum encoded data is a single - shot feedback process , in which the `` error - syndrome '' is measured and the information used to apply the correction  @xcite . rather than translating this process directly into coherent measurement and feedback steps",
    ", geodesics could be used to design a faster implementation .",
    "secondly , we have shown that the use of a hamiltonian that implements the usual swap operation is not necessarily the fastest way to transfer entropy .",
    "superior coherent protocols might be obtained by generalizing the process by which we found the optimal purification protocol .",
    "that is , by finding the class of transformations that will perform the desired function , and then searching for those that have the shortest geodesics .",
