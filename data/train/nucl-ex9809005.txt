    "in central heavy ion collisions the number of mesons produced increases with bombarding energy . in the energy range between @xmath10 and @xmath11 agev , 8% to 22% of the available energy",
    "is dissipated into this channel which predominantly consists of pions @xcite .",
    "the amount of dissipated energy also depends on system mass : in central au + au reactions at @xmath10 agev it is 8% , but 15% in central ni + ni reactions at the same bombarding energy .",
    "the process responsible for meson production is believed to be predominantly the excitation of baryon resonances during the early compression phase of the collision . in the later expansion phase these resonances decay .",
    "the primordial decay yields a number of different mesons , mainly pions .",
    "mesons with masses higher than the pion mass , e.g. @xmath12 , may subsequently decay also into several pions . in total , the average mass of the excited baryon resonances and the number of pions produced by their decay chains increase with bombarding energy .",
    "this mechanism is the basic process of pion production which is used in nuclear transport models to describe the dynamics of relativistic heavy ion collisions @xcite . in a recent publication",
    "@xcite it was shown that all resonances up to the @xmath13 resonance have to be included to successfully reproduce the experimental pion data at energies between 1 and 2 agev .",
    "the experimental confirmation that baryon resonances are excited in relativistic heavy ion collisions is rather scarce .",
    "the earliest indication came from the comparison by brockmann et al .",
    "@xcite of the pion and proton energy spectra observed in @xmath14 agev ar @xmath15 kcl reactions .",
    "this comparison was later extended with the attempt to determine the @xmath4 resonance mass and temperature @xcite .",
    "similar analyses of the pion energy spectra measured in @xmath10 agev au + au collisions were published in @xcite . at much higher energies , i.e. @xmath16 agev , the fraction of nucleons excited to the @xmath4 resonance was determined for si @xmath15 al , pb reactions @xcite . in this study also the invariant mass distribution of the @xmath4 resonance was reconstructed from correlated @xmath7 pairs .",
    "to identify structures in the invariant mass distribution of correlated proton and pion pairs provides the direct proof that nucleons are excited to high - lying resonances .",
    "the major obstacle in reconstructing the invariant mass is the large background of non - correlated @xmath17 pairs , which increases with the number of protons and is therefore particularly large for central reactions of heavy - mass systems . in peripheral reactions with very light projectiles ,",
    "e.g. p @xcite or @xmath18he @xcite induced reactions at around @xmath11 gev bombarding energy , the @xmath7 correlations were successfully analyzed and the mass distribution of the @xmath4 resonance was determined . the resonance mass was found to be shifted by @xmath19 mev / c@xmath3 to lower masses in reactions on various targets , compared to those on protons .",
    "very recently the @xmath4 was reconstructed from @xmath7 pairs detected at @xmath20 agev bombarding energy in @xmath21ni + cu collisions @xcite . in this case",
    "much larger mass shifts of @xmath22 mev / c@xmath3 were observed in central collisions , the shift became smaller with increasing impact parameter . that the @xmath1 pairs can also be successfully studied in central collisions of very heavy systems at @xmath10 agev bombarding energy was shown in @xcite .",
    "this report contained a preliminary analysis of the data used in the present publication .",
    "although at @xmath10 agev energy the excitation of the @xmath4 resonance is the dominating channel there is direct experimental evidence from the identification of the @xmath23 meson @xcite , that at this energy also higher - lying resonances , in particular the @xmath24 resonance , must become excited .",
    "if this is the case then the resonance decay into the @xmath25 channel also has to be present , and the analysis of @xmath1 correlations will not yield a complete picture of the resonance distribution . on the other hand , the @xmath25 decay channel can be observed in the pion transverse momentum spectra @xcite .",
    "the subsequent sections are organized as follows : the section 2 contains a short description of the experimental procedures",
    ". a more detailed description can be found in @xcite .",
    "the methods to extract the invariant mass distributions of the resonances involved are presented in section 3 .",
    "these methods include the analyses of the measured @xmath26 and @xmath27 transverse momentum spectra , and the analyses of the @xmath6 and @xmath7 correlations . in both cases the residual coulomb interaction between the charged pions and the positively charged baryon distribution causes a perturbation @xcite , which is of opposite sign for @xmath26 and @xmath27 and which we compensate by analyzing the average of the @xmath26 and @xmath27 spectra , respectively by taking the average invariant mass distribution from @xmath6 and @xmath7 . the justification to apply this procedure is given in the appendix 6.1 .",
    "the experimental results are presented in section 4 , section 5 contains their discussion and the summary .",
    "the reactions @xmath28au + @xmath28au and @xmath21ni + @xmath21ni were studied at nominal beam energies of @xmath29 , respectively @xmath30 and @xmath31 agev .",
    "the @xmath28au and @xmath21ni beams were accelerated by the @xmath32 accelerator combination of the @xmath33 /darmstadt .",
    "the duty cycle was 75% with a spill length of @xmath34 s. the average beam intensities varied between @xmath35 and @xmath36 particles per spill .",
    "the targets consisted of self supporting foils with a thickness of @xmath37m(au ) , respectively @xmath38m(ni ) .",
    "this corresponds to an interaction probability of 0.5% .",
    "the energy loss of the beams in the targets is of around @xmath39 agev and was neglected .",
    "the particles produced by the au + au and ni + ni reactions were detected by the @xmath40 detector which is a modular detection system with almost @xmath41 coverage .",
    "of particular importance for the present investigation is the central drift chamber @xmath42 which is mounted inside the superconducting magnet with a solenoidal field of @xmath43 t strength .",
    "the @xmath42 has complete cylindrical symmetry , it covers the polar angles @xmath44 from @xmath45 to @xmath46 in the laboratory frame and allows the particles masses and charges to be simultaneously determined . for charged pions",
    "the geometrical boundaries of the @xmath42 guarantees a detection efficiency of better than 65% , in particular the midrapidity region @xmath47 is fully covered above a transverse momentum limit @xmath48 ( for the definition of the variables used here , see below ) .",
    "notice , however , that to distinguish the @xmath27 from protons an additional momentum limit @xmath49 gev / c was introduced @xcite .",
    "this limit which corresponds to @xmath50 at midrapidity , has no consequences for the situation shown in fig.1 , and it is not required for the @xmath26 . for protons the geometrical @xmath42 boundaries",
    "@xmath51 reduce their detection efficiency to approximately 45% .",
    "the situation for particles produced in symmetric reactions at @xmath31 agev bombarding energy is depicted in fig.1 .",
    "the fully drawn curves display the lower and upper geometrical limits @xmath52 and @xmath53 in the laboratory frame , the dotted curves are drawn for pions respectively protons with @xmath54 kinetic energies of @xmath55 mev .",
    "the shaded area displays the momentum distribution of identified @xmath4 resonances , i.e. the decay proton and pion were measured by the @xmath42 .",
    "the resonances are monte carlo generated using a fixed mass @xmath56 mev / c@xmath3 and an isotropic boltzmann distribution with temperature @xmath57 mev , which corresponds to a mean kinetic energy of @xmath55 mev . because of the decay into a correlated @xmath17 pair the @xmath4 resonance can be observed in regions of the momentum space which are prohibited for single pions or protons by the @xmath52 cut . at midrapidity",
    "the @xmath4 resonance is detected for transverse momenta @xmath58 .",
    "notice that the symmetry law @xmath59 which holds for all symmetric reactions guarantees that the region @xmath60 can be reconstructed by reflection around midrapidity from the region @xmath61 . in this way the properties of around 50% af",
    "all @xmath4 resonances are known .",
    "the remaining ones which can not be reconstructed decay into a @xmath17 pair , where either one of the two particles or both are not detected within the geometrical boundaries of the @xmath42 . under the assumptions made ,",
    "i.e. isotropic resonance distribution and isotropic resonance decay , the efficiency of the @xmath42 for detecting resonances can be calculated as a function of the mass and the kinetic energy of the resonance .",
    "= 8.5 cm    the efficiencies to detect resonances with masses @xmath62 and kinetic energies @xmath63 are plotted in the right panel of fig.1 , without employing symmetrization .",
    "the detection efficiencies decrease rapidly with mass for small kinetic energies . without the proper efficiency corrections , which in this case are solely due to the incomplete @xmath41 acceptance of the detector ,",
    "the contributions from small mass values @xmath62 would be reduced .",
    "notice that from the results published in @xcite for the au + au reaction at @xmath10 agev bombarding energy , the expected mean kinetic energy of the @xmath4 resonance with mass @xmath64 mev / c@xmath3 is @xmath65 mev . to obtain the efficiency correction for a given mass the data shown in fig.1 have to be weighted by the energy distribution of that mass and integrated .",
    "in addition to the @xmath42 , the information from the forward plastic scintillation wall @xmath66 mainly served trigger purposes . the @xmath66 is a high - granularity component of the @xmath40 detector and covers the polar angles @xmath44 from @xmath67 to @xmath68 with full cylindrical symmetry .",
    "it separates particles only according to their charges . in the present analysis",
    "the particle multiplicities @xmath69 measured with the @xmath66 were required to be larger than 80% of the maximum multiplicity which is defined by the lower boundary of the @xmath70 multiplicity bin , see @xcite .",
    "this multiplicity criterion selects near - central collisions in the impact parameter range from @xmath71 to @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the maximum impact parameter of a given reaction . on the average",
    "the fireball then contains around @xmath74 of the maximum number @xmath75 of nucleons .    in the present study we shall use the identical conventions which were used in @xcite .",
    "all quantities which refer to the laboratory(@xmath76 ) or target frames will be labeled by small letters .",
    "the center of mass(@xmath54 ) or fireball frames are generally characterized by capital letters .",
    "exceptions are those quantities , like the transverse momentum , which remain unchanged under the transformation of frames . for the transverse momentum we sometimes use the quantity @xmath77 where the index @xmath78 indicates a normalization by the factor @xmath79 and where @xmath80 is the particle s mass number .",
    "similarly the rapidity y in the @xmath54 frame is normalized by the factor @xmath81 and this quantity is labeled @xmath82 . in the present experiments the normalization factors for the pion transverse momenta have the values @xmath83 ( gev / c)@xmath84 for @xmath85 agev bombarding energy , to obtain the equivalent values for protons these numbers",
    "should be multiplied with a factor @xmath86 .",
    "for the rapidities the corresponding normalization factors are @xmath87 .",
    "the data from the drift chamber @xmath42 were analyzed by using three different tracking algorithms as described in @xcite .",
    "differences in tracking are mainly observed in case of the au + au reaction , they consist in a slightly different ( 10% ) efficiency with which negative pions are identified .",
    "equal tracking efficiencies can be obtained by adjusting the limits in which the tracking parameters are allowed to vary @xcite .",
    "we have verified that our results do not depend on these limits , and agree for the different versions of the tracking algorithm .",
    "our final data , i.e. transverse momentum and invariant mass spectra , are the average of three independent analyses with these different trackers , and this data sample has been used before in our study of the pion production in au + au @xcite and ni + ni @xcite reactions .",
    "the accuracy with which the particle momenta can be measured with the @xmath42 was determined in @xcite .",
    "for the transverse momentum the relative standard deviation @xmath88 is @xmath89 for @xmath90 gev / c , and then increases to @xmath91 for transverse momenta @xmath92 gev / c .",
    "the accuracy in determining the azimuthal angle @xmath93 is better than @xmath94 , the accuracy to determine the polar angle @xmath44 is better for protons ( @xmath95 ) than for pions ( @xmath96 ) .",
    "these values may be used to estimate the accuracy with which the mass @xmath62 of a baryon resonance b can be determined . without going into the details which will be more",
    "fully presented in the next section , the accuracy estimate is @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the sum of the proton and pion masses and @xmath99 is the angle between @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "taking representative values , i.e. +    @xmath102    one obtains for , e.g. the mass of the @xmath4 resonance an error of @xmath103 mev / c@xmath3 , with decreasing accuracy for larger masses @xmath62 .",
    "this estimate is certainly sufficient to determine the resonance mass distribution , it is however not representative , since a second source of systematic errors comes from the reconstruction of the combinatorial background of uncorrelated @xmath1 pairs , as will be discussed in the next section . in the present analysis",
    "the number of directly measured @xmath1 pairs is larger than @xmath104 for a given reaction , to reconstruct the background for this reaction we have used approximately @xmath105 times more pairs .",
    "the statistical errors are therefore not the decisive factor in our analysis .",
    "we have employed two independent procedures to determine the mass distribution of baryon resonances excited in near - central collisions of identical nuclei . in the first method",
    "the pion @xmath0 spectrum is defolded to yield the mass distribution , in the second method the invariant mass distribution of the correlated @xmath1 pairs is deduced from the data .",
    "both methods rely on the assumption that the resonances involved in the production of pions decay via the emission of only one pion .",
    "this assumption is not necessarily fulfilled as was pointed out in the introduction .",
    "if the two - pion decay is present it effects the results of the two methods in different ways . in the first case",
    "the presence of the two - pion channel will cause a distortion of the mass spectrum , in the second case it will mainly contribute to the background .",
    "it is therefore not expected that both methods should yield identical results , however these results should be reasonably close since the two - pion channel is expected to be weak @xcite .",
    "we therefore also take a reasonable agreement as an indication that systematic errors are sufficiently small .",
    "the sizes of the mass shifts @xmath106 and the widths @xmath107 deduced from our monte carlo studies are listed in table 4 .",
    "it is evident that the results from the correlation analyses are less affected by the coulomb distortion than those from the defolding analysis . nevertheless adding the @xmath26 and @xmath27 data one comes closest to the primordial conditions , which is the procedure employed in the present analysis .",
    "the discussion in section 2 is primarily concerned with the efficiency of reconstructing the baryon resonances within the geometrical boundaries of the @xmath42 .",
    "another efficiency reduction , which requires a careful investigation , is imposed by the limited capabilities of the available tracking algorithms to separate and identify individual particle tracks in the @xmath42 .",
    "these inefficiencies become largest when the mass of the decaying resonance is close to the threshold mass @xmath98 , i.e. when the relative momentum between the proton and the pion is small and the two particle tracks are close to each other . for the tracking algorithm , which analyzes particle tracks in the @xmath108 plane perpendicular to the @xmath109 direction of the magnetic field , the closeness of tracks is given by the relative angle @xmath110 and by the magnitude of @xmath111 . the smaller @xmath112 and the larger @xmath111",
    "the more difficult it becomes to separate pion tracks from proton tracks .",
    "the size of the efficiency reduction as function of @xmath112 and @xmath111 can be obtained from a comparison of the invariant mass distributions @xmath113 and @xmath114 as functions of @xmath112 and @xmath111 since in the latter all pairs are identified with identical efficiencies .",
    "we show in fig.12 the ratio @xmath115 for @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and monte carlo generated @xmath17 tracks as functions of @xmath112 , where the monte carlo simulation illustrates the ideal case of complete tracking efficiency . in the simulation",
    "the conditions are similar to the experimental ones , in particular the fraction of @xmath1 pairs due to resonance decay is in the order of 1% . the comparison with the monte carlo simulation proves , that the probability to miss correlated @xmath1 pairs never exceeds 20% for a given value of @xmath112 , and that it is certainly more appropriate to correct for this inefficiency than to remove all data with @xmath116 , as was done in @xcite .",
    "that the efficiency reduction is different for @xmath6 and @xmath7 pairs was to be expected since the @xmath117 and @xmath27 have the same curvature signs , whereas these are different in case of @xmath117 and @xmath26 .",
    "furthermore the fact that in case of @xmath6 pairs the efficiency is reduced only for negative @xmath112 angles offers the possibility to check the consistency of the efficiency correction .",
    "the invariant mass spectra @xmath118 have to be the same for @xmath119 and @xmath120 .",
    "this check was done in our analyses and was shown to yield identical @xmath118 distributions within the given uncertainties .",
    "all data shown in this paper were therefore efficiency corrected according to the results of fig.12 and the similar dependences on @xmath111 .",
    "the sizes of the efficiency corrections were directly obtained from the data , their dependence on @xmath112 and @xmath111 was , however , smoothed by the spline algorithm .",
