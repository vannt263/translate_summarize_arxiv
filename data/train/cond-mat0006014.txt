    "in 1952 , lee and yang in their famous papers @xcite first proposed a new and effective method for investigation of phase transitions .",
    "they studied the distribution of zeros of the partition function considered as a function of a complex magnetic field ( fugacity ) , and proved the circle theorem , which states that the zeros of the partition function of ising ferromagnet lie on the unit circle in the complex fugacity plane ( _ yang - lee zeros _ ) . after these pioneer works of lee and yang , fisher  @xcite , in 1964 , initiated the study of partition function zeros in the complex temperature plane ( _ fisher zeros _ ) .",
    "these methods are then extended to other type of interactions and were widely applied @xcite .",
    "recently , binek @xcite showed that the density of yang - lee zeros can be determined experimentally from the field dependence of the isothermal magnetization data .",
    "the fractal structure of fisher zeros in q - state potts model on the diamond lattice was obtained by derrida , seze and itzykson  @xcite .",
    "they showed that the fisher zeros in hierarchical lattice models are just the julia set corresponding to the renormalization transformation .",
    "bosco and goulard rosa  @xcite investigated yang - lee zeros of the ferromagnetic ising model on the cayley tree and associated these with the julia set of the cayley tree recursion map .",
    "they studied the case when the complex magnetic field was applied only to spins on lattice surface and found that yang - lee zeros are distributed along the unit circle .",
    "the lattice models with multisite interaction ising and heisenberg models have been used for modelling the physical systems such as the binary alloys  @xcite , classical fluids  @xcite , liquid bilayers  @xcite , solid @xmath0  @xcite , rare gases  @xcite and anisotropic magnets ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 , etc . ) .",
    "these systems have rather complicated phase diagrams and unusual properties . indeed , the monte carlo results give evidence of the presence of phase transitions at nonzero values of the magnetic field for a number of ferromagnetic multisite interaction models @xcite .",
    "there are few analytical results for these systems due to their greater complexity .",
    "here we proposed a numerical algorithm for investigation of complex zeros of partition functions of models on the cayley - type lattices .",
    "this letter is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we give the model and derive the generalized recurrence equation . in section 3 it is shown that the zeros of partition function can be associated with the set of external parameters ( _ kt , magnetic field _ ) at which the recurrence function has neutral periodic cycles . in section 4",
    "we present some definitions and theorems from complex analytic dynamics and give the numerical algorithm for obtaining yang - lee and fisher zeros of the models . in the last section we give the explanation of the results and make conclusions .",

    "<S> a general analytical formula for recurrence relations of multisite interaction ising models in an external magnetic field on the cayley - type lattices is derived . using the theory of complex analytical dynamics on the riemann sphere , a numerical algorithm to obtain yang - lee and fisher zeros of the models is developed . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the sets of yang - lee and fisher zeros are almost always fractals , that could be associated with mandelbrot - like sets on the complex magnetic field and temperature planes respectively . </S>"
