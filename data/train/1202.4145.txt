    "monolayer graphene is a one atom thick carbon layer in a hexagonal honeycomb lattice . from the lattice properties one can deduce the band structure and , hence , the energy spectrum .    in graphene ,",
    "charge carriers are described by the dirac equation instead of schrdinger s as it is the case of traditional semiconductors .",
    "this is a direct consequence from the fact that graphene has two equivalent triangular sublattices a and b@xcite .",
    "therefore , the dispersion relationship is linear and is expressed by @xmath0 @xcite where the positive ( negative ) sign describes electrons ( holes ) as carriers .",
    "thus , it is deduced that carriers in graphene have the same dispersion relationship than massless particles with velocity @xmath1 .    according to previous studies",
    ", graphene might be the ideal material for electronic devices@xcite due to several properties which are present in graphene such as its high mobility ( up to 15000@xmath2@xcite ) , the large scattering length@xcite and also because graphene can stand a current density which is six order of magnitude greater than in copper@xcite .",
    "the conductance of pn junctions in graphene has been studied previously@xcite and different configurations of junctions nnn , npn , ppp and pnp have been also studied@xcite .",
    "experimental measurements have been carried out in order to study the conducting properties of pnp structures@xcite obtained by the deposition of a top gate separated from the graphene by an air gap .",
    "quantum oscillations of the conductance in graphene have been studied both theoretically@xcite and experimentally@xcite .",
    "+ because of its electrical properties , graphene is an interesting potential material to develop nanodevices usable in technological applications , such as field effect transistors ( fet ) . in this work",
    "we have modelised a fet based on graphene and analyzed its electrical transport capabilities based on an exact analytical solution to the dirac equation .",
    "finally , we study the different behaviour of the conductance shown by a fet considering that the current does not flow perpendicularly to the top gate .",
    "we start our model considering that the carriers in graphene can be considered as massless ultrarelativistic dirac particles , since the tight binding hamiltonian for graphene leads to a linear dispersion relationship .",
    "therefore , graphene carriers are described by the dirac eigenvalue equations : @xmath3 in where @xmath4 are the pauli matrices , and @xmath5 is a two component spinor . @xmath6 considering an external potencial v(x , y ) , the hamiltonian is : @xmath7 which yields @xmath8 in the particular case of v a constant , eventually zero , the solution will be a plane wave spinor in the form of @xmath9 where @xmath10 where the positive ( negative ) sign will be due to electronlike ( holelike ) regime .",
    "[ c3 ] shows an scheme of the device under consideration : a rectangular single layer of graphene ( blue),with two gold contacts which will be the source and drain .",
    "the device also has a back gate and a top gate which is on dielectric layer ( sio@xmath11 , pmma resist or rx resist , for example ) .",
    "the back gate controls the charge carrier density of the sample and the top gate modulates the current which flows through the device from source to drain passing through a square potential barrier .",
    "we will suppose that the sample is big enough not to be considered as a strip , therefore there will not be edge effects .",
    "furthermore , at temperatures close to 0  k , the charge carrier density @xmath12 is proportional to fermi energy squared@xcite ( @xmath13 ) and will show a linear dependence with the back gate voltage ( @xmath14 ) @xcite .",
    "we apply the expressions obtained earlier ( eq . [ wfunction ] ) in order to calculate the transmission coefficient through a square barrier potential @xmath15 and width @xmath16@xcite .",
    "each charge carrier will have an energy @xmath17 and the angle of incidence @xmath18 will be @xmath19 .",
    "+ the wavefunction will be a linear combination of wavefunctions in regions i and ii and iii .",
    "@xmath20    for further discussion , we consider that in zone i the amplitude of the incident wavefunction is 1 , whereas the amplitude of the reflected wavefunction is @xmath21 . in zone",
    "ii the amplitude of the incident wavefunction is @xmath22 and the amplitude of the reflected wavefunction is @xmath23 . finally , in zone iii only transmitted wavefunction with and amplitude of value @xmath24 is to be observed .",
    "we define @xmath25 and @xmath26 which are related to the nature of the charge carriers ( hole or electron regime ) .    for convenience ,",
    "we define the following quantities : @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29,@xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 . + in order",
    "to obtain the parameters of the wavefunctions @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 we will impose boundary conditions such as the wavefunction must be continuous at the borders of the barrier potential .",
    "straightforward algebra , whose details are given in reference @xcite , yields the expression of the transmission coefficient    @xmath33    as we can see , the transmission coefficient depends upon the energy of the charge carrier @xmath17 , the angle of incidence @xmath18 and the parameters of the barrier potential @xmath15 and @xmath16 whereas it does not depend upon the dimensions of the graphene sheet @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "also , the transmission coefficient is symmetric with respect to the angle of incidence @xmath18 . according to this expression , in the case of normal incidence , the transmission coefficient is the unity with independance upon any other parameters . that is the case of the klein paradox for dirac particles @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "the analytical expression obtained for the transmission coefficient @xcite can be used in order to calculate the conductance across a potential barrier .",
    "the momentum of the charge carriers along the graphene is @xmath36 .",
    "the contribution of each carrier to current density along the x direction is given by : @xmath37    the total current is caused by the charges with all possible values of @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "the number of carriers with momentum between @xmath40 and @xmath41 depends on the number of the available states , and its occupation degree , given the fermi - dirac distribution @xmath42 .",
    "the area element in the momentum space is @xmath43 and the number of electrons in this area is ( 2 due to the spin and 2 due to the duplicity of the valleys of dirac )    @xmath44    thus , the current density can be calculated by means of @xmath45 we proceed now to use polar coordinates , and use the relation @xmath46 @xmath47 thus , the total current density is @xmath48    if we consider that the current is by both , electrons and holes , @xmath49 and @xmath50 @xmath51    we consider now that the contacts are actually nothing but ideal reservoirs which stablish equilibrium of the distribution of electrons to a certain chemical potential @xmath52 ( source ) and @xmath53 ( drain ) yielding two electron fluxes .",
    "when these two currents are considered , being symmetric the transmission coefficient as it is , we obtain :    @xmath54    the later expression can be reduced in some cases :    * if the bias that exists is large at low temperature , the contribution due to the reservoir with lesser chemical potential ( right ) is negligible .",
    "it is possible to obtain the total density of current if we consider only the current that provide the reservoir on the left .",
    "* at low temperature ( @xmath55 ) , when the electrons are hightly degenerated , the fermi function can be approximated by the step function , and therefore @xmath56 * if the bias is very small , we can approximate the fermi distribution by its taylor approximation around the mean value of the chemical potentials @xmath57 and considering that the difference between the chemical potentials is established in fact by means of the bias @xmath58 : @xmath59 and therefore + @xmath60 + the minus sign describes the correct direction of the electrical current carried for both electrons and holes .",
    "therefore , since the conductance is given by @xmath61 and the intensity is @xmath62 the conductance is given by @xmath63 .",
    "we define the effective conductance as @xmath64 , and @xmath65 * at ultra low temperatures ( at zero temperature @xmath66 ) we can approximate @xmath67 so that we obtain @xmath68 in units of @xmath69 : @xmath70    we point out that if we express the lengths in _ nm _ and the energies in _ mev _ , it results @xmath71 @xmath72 and the effective conductance is given in units of @xmath69 .",
    "the conductance will depend on the potential applied by the top gate ( through the transmission coefficient ) , the potential applied by the back gate ( through @xmath73 ) and the width of the graphene sheet , but not upon its length .",
    "furthermore , we observe in ( eq.[geff ] ) that the maximun value of the effective conductance is at @xmath74 , and therefore @xmath75    by introducing the expresion in ( eq.[ctrans ] ) into ( eq.[geff ] ) we obtain the effective conductance for one square barrier potential in graphene :    @xmath76    as it is seen , the effective conductance of a graphene - based fet depends upon the fermi energy and the properties of the potential barrier created by the top gate ( height @xmath15 and width @xmath16 ) .",
    "figure [ f1 ] shows conductance versus fermi energy .",
    "it is shown that the curve of the effective conductance has a local maximum when @xmath77 . at this point , the sign of the quantity @xmath78 is changed from positive to negative . therefore , in ( eq.[gb ] ) the sine of this quantity will become a hyperbolic sine , and the conductance will become smaller .",
    "thus , the resistance will increase .",
    "this situation will persist until a local minimum is reached , at @xmath79 .",
    "when @xmath80 is greater than @xmath81 , since the transmission coefficient tends to unity , the effective conductance grows proportionally to the fermi energy , similarly to ( eq.[gmax ] ) .",
    "we observe oscillations of the conductance at fermi energies which verify @xmath82 . for @xmath83",
    "there are several oscillations , whereas for values of the fermi energy such that @xmath84 there is only one oscillation .",
    "if @xmath85 the conductance does not depend on the value of the barrier width and varies linearly with the fermi energy .    as we can see in figure [ f1a ] ; when @xmath81 increases , the effective conductance decreases linearly and takes the same value indepently of the value of the width , for @xmath81 verifying @xmath86 .",
    "when @xmath15 takes the value of the fermi energy , there is a local minimum , whose value depends on the width of the barrier @xmath16 . for @xmath87 , the conductance increases and exhibits oscillations which are bigger as the width of the barrier decreases .",
    "furthermore , it is appreciated that , as the value of @xmath16 decreases the amplitude of the oscillations increases .",
    "these oscillations appear only for values of @xmath15 which verify @xmath88 .",
    "the dependance of the effective conductance upon the width @xmath16 of the barrier is shown in figure [ fd ] : the conductance decreases until it tends to be stabilised in the vicinities of a constant value .",
    "it is also observed that the oscillations tend to be lesser as the fermi energy grows .",
    "up to now we have considered that the carriers scatter through the barrier with the same probability for each angle of incidence .",
    "it should be considered another scenarios in which , due to the inhomogeneities of the material or the design of the device , the carriers flow around certain direction .",
    "thus , the angle of incidence will be different from 0@xmath89 and will obey certain probability distribution function @xmath90 centered around an angle @xmath91 .",
    "this probability distribution function must verify the condition    @xmath92    next , we will consider different probabilities of distribution and we will study its effect on the effective conductance .",
    "we consider now the case of a gaussian function for the probability distribution of the angle of incidence .",
    "this assumption represents that transport is of ballistic nature and that there are a few inhomogeneities which cause scattering processes within the sample and deviates carriers from their ballistic trajectory ; making them to impact the barrier potential with a non zero angle of incidence . since not all the carriers will suffer the same scattering process",
    ", we can assume that the majority of carriers will impact the barrier potential with a similar angle @xmath91 and that there will be more carriers impacting the barrier potential with an angle of incidence @xmath91 than carriers impacting the barrier with an angle of incidence that differs substantially from @xmath91 .",
    "thus , we assume that the angles of incidence of the carriers will obey a probability distribution function that has the form @xmath93 .",
    "+ the parameter @xmath22 of the gaussian functions makes the distinction between an homogeneus sample ( a narrow gaussian bell ) or a sample with plenty of inhomogeneities ( a wide distribution ) .",
    "a narrow gaussian function represents the case in which almost all the carriers scatter with the barrier at the same angle of incidence .",
    "this will happen when the sample is homogeneus and the carriers do not scatter with the sample inhomogeneities , and therefore the transport will be ballistic and almost all the carriers will move through the sample with a similar direction . obviously , a wide gaussian function represents the opposite case . + we start the analysis by considering the scenario in which the transmission coefficient equals the unity : @xmath91 = 0@xmath89 .",
    "+ obviously , the parameters @xmath22 and @xmath94 are not independent , since they must hold the normalization condition @xmath95 .",
    "as we can see , as @xmath94 becomes smaller @xmath22 becomes greater .",
    "the conductance is given by :    @xmath96    as in the previous case , the effective conductance depends on @xmath80 , @xmath97 and @xmath16 but it shows a different behaviour , as shown in figures [ gauss3 ] and [ gauss2 ] .",
    "+    we study the behaviour of the conductance when the fermi energy is changed while the other variables remain at fixed values ( see figure  [ gauss3 ] ) .",
    "the conductance oscillates whilst it increases until a local maximum is reached .",
    "the value and position of this maximum depends on the parameters of the gaussian function used .",
    "once the maximum is reached , the conductance decreases until it reaches a local minimum when @xmath98 .",
    "once the minimum is surpassed , the conductance increases monotonically .",
    "+    at it is shown in figure [ gauss2 ] , when using @xmath15 as the driving parameter and the other parameters remain fixed at constant values , we can see that the effective conductance decreases until it reaches a minimum around @xmath98 .",
    "it is also observed that the narrower gaussian function ( which is equivalent to a less disordered distribution ) the variation of the conductance is more pronounced .",
    "once @xmath73 is greater than @xmath15 we can observe oscillations of the conductance whose frequency tends to the value @xmath99 .",
    "+    we consider now the case in which the gaussian distribution is not centered around @xmath100 .",
    "this might be done by tilting the orientation of the top gate in a graphene based device as , for example , shown in @xcite . in this case , the normalization condition is given by the expression @xmath101 .",
    "as we can see in figures [ gauss31 ] and [ gauss21 ] the results are similar than the obtained in the previous case , but the minima observed previously are wider .",
    "in fact as @xmath22 is closer to zero these minima become wider .",
    "next , we consider the extreme scenario in which the gaussian function is so narrow that it can be represented by a delta function @xmath102 .",
    "this is the case in which the material is ideal and all the carriers scatter through the barrier with the same angle of incidence @xmath91 .    in this case , the conductance is given by :    @xmath103    it is observed that the effective conductance depends now on the angle of incidence , along with the rest of the parameters previously considered ( fermi energy , @xmath73 , height of the barrier , @xmath15 , and width of the barrier , @xmath16 ) .",
    "+ in particular , if the current flows perpendicularly to the barrier , the transmission coefficient equals 1 with no dependance on the fermi energy and the parameters of the barrier , as a consequence of the klein paradox@xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "therefore , the conductance is proportional to the fermi energy : @xmath104 for non normal incidence , the conductance presents an effective gap between the values @xmath105 of the fermi energy , developing an effective minimum at @xmath106 ( as shown in figure [ gdelta2 ] ) , whose value is @xmath107    in this scenario in which we assume a delta - like probability distribution function , we can see that for an angle of incidence of @xmath108 ( or @xmath109 ) a wide minimum of the conductance is developed ( figures [ gdelta2 ] and [ gdelta1 ] ) .",
    "this minimum is formed both when using the fermi energy ( which can be associated with the back gate voltage of the transistor shown in figure [ c3 ] ) and the height of the barrier ( the top gate voltage in our model schematized ) as a driving parameter . in this case , the dependance of the conductance on the width of the barrier shows no remarkable features but a small oscillation whose amplitude depends on the fermi energy ( see figures [ gdeltad ] and [ gdeltad1 ] ) .    as the angle of incidence",
    "is increased , the features described tend to be greater .",
    "in particular , the effective gap which appears is wider and more pronounced , as seen in figures [ gdelta21 ] and [ gdelta11 ] where we have assumed an angle of incidence @xmath108 .",
    "the observed minimum of the conductance shows that in certain conditions the klein tunneling might be avoided and that the fabrication of an effective fet based on graphene with a noticeable on - off ratio is feasible .",
    "we have obtained an analytical expression of the transmission coefficient through a square barrier potential based on the previous work done @xcite in which the continuity conditions were applied in order to obtain the dirac functions of carriers in graphene in the presence of a barrier potential .",
    "+ within this approach , we have stablished a theoretical model to study transport through a square barrier potential in graphene .",
    "analytical expressions for the transmission coefficient in several different scenarios have been obtained .",
    "these different scenarios are a modelization of the different scattering conditions of the sample due to the different degree of inhomogeneity in the sample .    in this model",
    "we have also studied a graphene based device and its effective conductance between its two terminals . in particular , we have found an scenario in which the klein paradox is neglected and the creation of an effective gap is induced . therefore we think that it might be suitable to control the transport in a graphene based field effect transistor .",
    "+ we believe that a top gate which is non - perpendicular to the source - drain direction might create a gap in the case in which the graphene is clean and shows almost no inhomogeneities .",
    "this phenomenon occurs for any angle of incidence @xmath91 .",
    "the position and width of the energy gap , depend on both the barrier height and @xmath91 itself .",
    "this feature might be an important step in the development of transistors based on graphene , as the non existance of a gap is one of the main difficulties found to effectively modulate the current via the bias .",
