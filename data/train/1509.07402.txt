    "the predicted over - abundance of galaxy satellites is a well known challenge to the standard cold dark matter ( cdm ) scenario , and it appears to be related to the large small - scale power of the cdm power spectrum of density perturbations ( see e.g. , @xcite ) . the inclusion of baryonic processes in the models can reduce this discrepancy ( e.g. , by suppressing star formation through supernovae feedback or photoionizing uv background , @xcite ) , although it is still difficult to maintain a simultaneous matching with other properties of satellite galaxies , like colors and star - formation histories .",
    "an interesting alternative is to assume that dark matter is composed of particles with mass @xmath13 kev ( warm dark matter , e.g. , @xcite ) . the larger corresponding free - streaming length results in a strong suppression of the power spectrum at the dwarf galaxy scales ( @xcite ) .",
    "this effect reduces the expected abundance of dwarfs with respect to the predictions of cdm models , providing a better agreement with observations ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    in this context ,",
    "an attractive way to probe different dm cosmological scenarios is to look for faint dwarf galaxies in the local universe and in particular in the virgo cluster , which represents the densest nearby region .",
    "this large galaxy concentration allows us to probe the abundance of dwarf galaxies down to dm masses @xmath14 m@xmath10 ( e.g. , @xcite ) where predictions of wdm and cdm diverge ( @xcite ) . nevertheless , the search for very faint dwarfs in virgo is not straightforward , as it implies pushing the detection toward very low limits in central surface brightness , as first noted by @xcite .",
    "@xcite found a population of blue lsb dwarfs in the virgo cluster with @xmath15 not detected in previous surveys .",
    "they stressed the effects of this new lsb dwarf population on the faint - end of the virgo galaxy luminosity function ( lf hereafter ) .",
    "more recently @xcite performed a survey in five different local fields of varying galaxy density including the center of the virgo cluster .",
    "they obtained relatively deep subaru images in a small area of the virgo cluster surrounding the m86 bright galaxy .",
    "they made also use of part of the vcc sample of @xcite to derive the bright end of the lf .",
    "their new subaru dwarf sample allowed the evaluation of the virgo lf down to @xmath16 .",
    "since the slope found at the faint end ( @xmath17 ) was significantly flatter than the cdm mass function slope ( @xmath18 ) , they suggested a high degree of suppression of star formation in small dm halos .",
    "the suppressed luminosity of low - mass dm clumps would then explain the flat slope of the luminosity function .",
    "@xcite performed a wide survey ( 14 deg@xmath3 ) down to @xmath19 with the isaac newton telscope ( 2.5 m ) . despite some success in discovering faint lsb dwarfs",
    ", they could not reach a high level of completeness and their derived lf appears flat in the magnitude interval @xmath20 .",
    "however , when combining their sample with the brighter virgo cluster sample , they suggest a somewhat steeper faint end lf than previously found .    a recent investigation of the dwarf population using cfht imaging has been performed by @xcite , reaching a completeness limit of @xmath21 in 3.75 deg@xmath3 .",
    "they found an average slope of the lf as steep as @xmath22 in the range @xmath23 .",
    "very recently , @xcite have provided a first analysis of the lsb dwarf population in a field of about 100 deg@xmath3 from the next generation virgo survey ( @xcite ) . this survey is larger with respect to the one by @xcite although not deeper , reaching completeness at @xmath24 ( which approximately corresponds to @xmath25 for an average @xmath26 ) .",
    "their lf slope is consistent with previous values @xmath27 .    to summarize",
    ", a population of faint lsb dwarfs in the virgo cluster has emerged from imaging analysis , although the images were not deep enough to reach firm conclusions about the shape of the very faint - end of the virgo lf .    in this paper",
    "we show the results of a _ pilot _",
    "lsb dwarf search in a deep virgo field .",
    "although smaller than previous surveys , our observations are significantly deeper thanks to the use of the large binocular camera ( lbc , @xcite ) of the large binocular telescope .",
    "the images were acquired by @xcite ( see also @xcite ) in the context of the study of the high redshift ( @xmath28 ) galaxy cluster xmmu j1230.3 + 1339 , that is located in the projected region of the virgo cluster including ngc 4477 .",
    "although the field of view covers an area of only 0.16 deg@xmath3 , it is particularly deep and provides a first estimate of the dwarf surface density at the faint - end of the galaxy lf in virgo .",
    "we adopt @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 in units of 100 km / s / mpc .",
    "ab magnitudes have been adopted except for figure 5 .",
    "the images were obtained in the u , b , r , i , z bands with exposure times ranging from 3.2 ks to 9 ks , and calibrated using zeropoints derived from landoldt standards or sloan dr7 catalog @xcite .",
    "the size of the field of view at full depth is @xmath32 arcmin@xmath3 .",
    "further observational details can be found in @xcite .    to detect faint lsb dwarfs and to confirm their association with the virgo cluster we have used their distribution in the @xmath33 plane , as previously done by several authors ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite and reference therein ) .",
    "we have performed the detection in the @xmath34 band using sextractor ( @xcite ) setting a surface brightness limit of @xmath35 at the 2@xmath36 level and a minimum detection circular area of diameter 2.5 arcsec .",
    "sextractor has also been used to derive a first estimate of the central surface brightness .",
    "we plot the galaxies found down to @xmath37 as a function of the central surface brightness in figure 1 .",
    "there are 11 galaxies that are well separated from the bulk of the galaxies in the catalog ( note that magnitudes and central surface brightnesses of the blue circles are more accurately derived from profile fitting , see below ) .",
    "a visual inspection has been executed to confirm the reality of such detections .",
    "all 11 lsb dwarf candidates are clearly extended sources with low surface brightness , and they are all detected in the full u , b , r , i , z multicolor dataset used . a further visual inspection over the whole image failed to detect additional candidates .",
    "to perform a more quantitative selection , we have plotted in the same figure 1 a straight line representing the lsb selection threshold used by @xcite to separate virgo galaxies from the background sample , extrapolated to our fainter magnitudes .",
    "9 out of our 11 candidates are above or very close to their selection threshold , and the remaining 2 are in any case well separated by the locus of the background sample .",
    "we note that the @xcite threshold is a robust but not complete selection criterion , since there is a small overlap between the two populations , as shown by the spectroscopic detection of a few virgo galaxies below the selection threshold ( i.e. at brighter central surface brightness with respect to the adopted line for a given total magnitude ) . as an independent check ,",
    "we have also verified that dwarfs with similar characteristics are absolutely absent in our database of lbc fields even deeper than this ( i.e. , with exposure times @xmath38 hr and limiting magnitudes @xmath39 ) obtained in different sky regions for a total area of @xmath40 deg@xmath3 ( @xcite , grazian et al . in preparation ) , lending further support to the association of the selected lsb dwarf candidates to the virgo cluster .",
    "for these reasons , in the following we will consider all the 11 lsb dwarfs as bona fide virgo members .",
    "the positions of all candidates in our image are shown in figure 2 and their @xmath34-band morphologies are shown in figure 3 . in the latter ,",
    "their low central surface brightness with respect to the background sources is clearly evident . in some cases",
    "compact sources are overlapping with our lsb dwarf candidates , possibly altering the estimate of their total magnitude and morphological parameters . to obtain cleaner measurements",
    "we have used the galfit package ( @xcite ) , a versatile software that allows radial profile modeling with different functions .",
    "we used srsic power - law profiles ( @xcite ) , without truncation , usually adopted to fit spiral as well as spheroidal morphologies . in the fitting procedure we leave the srsic power - law index @xmath41 , the scale radius @xmath42 , the axial ratio , the total magnitude ( or the central surface brightness ) as free parameters .",
    "the de vaucouleurs and exponential disk profiles are included as cases with srsic index @xmath43 or 1 , respectively .",
    "the psf profile was convolved with the intrinsic profiles for the fitting . small , compact sources superimposed on our lsb dwarfs were simultaneously fit with the main lsb galaxy to remove their contribution .",
    "the most striking example is given by `` k '' galaxy which is contaminated by several compact sources , and which is shown in more detail in figure 4 . in this",
    "specific case differences with respect to the sextractor parameters can reach values of the order of 0.4 in total magnitude .",
    "in general , however , differences between galfit and sextractor total magnitudes or central surface brightnesses are no more than 0.15 mag or mag arcsec@xmath44 , respectively .",
    "the resulting parameters , including magnitudes and central surface brightnesses , for the lsb dwarf candidates are shown in table 1 . for most sources",
    "the central surface brightness in the @xmath34 band lies within the interval @xmath45 and the srsic scale radius in the interval @xmath46 arcsec or equivalently @xmath47 pc adopting an angular scale of 80 pc arcsec@xmath7 , that corresponds to a distance of the virgo cluster of @xmath48 mpc .",
    "absolute magnitudes derived from the fit are in general fainter than @xmath49 and reach values as faint as @xmath8 in the @xmath34 band . also , the srsic index @xmath41 is always @xmath50 typical of high surface brightness spirals and dwarfs . in general the axial ratio is larger than 0.6 , and for @xmath51% of the sample it is @xmath52 .",
    "formal statistical errors provided by galfit are typically a few percent .",
    "to estimate galaxy colors in a similar way , without the contribution from overlapping compact sources , we have repeated the same procedure in our u , b , i , z images .",
    "we have again used galfit , fixing the radial profile obtained in the @xmath34 band image and leaving only the total magnitude free to change . in the estimate we assumed negligible color gradients along the galaxy profile .",
    "we have checked that the @xmath53 did not increase because of this assumption .",
    "the procedure is often needed in the low signal - to - noise blue and uv images where only the central part of the galaxy profile emerges from the background noise .",
    "results are shown in table 1 , where all the galaxies appear red with an average @xmath54 . to compare with the sloan colors we fit the observed colors to theoretical spectral energy distributions ( sed ) using the procedure described below .",
    "we computed the sloan @xmath55 magnitude from the resulting best  fitting spectrum , yielding an average @xmath56 .",
    "the latter color is somewhat bluer than that of the brightest virgo galaxies in our field ( @xmath57 for ngc 4477 and 4479 , respectively ) .",
    "the lsb colors are also bluer than predictions from cdm models ( @xmath58 , @xcite ) , which include specific prescriptions for star formation and feedback for simulated brighter virgo dwarfs with @xmath59 . as suggested by the same authors ,",
    "the model predicts redder colors mainly because it could overestimate the star formation quenching in virgo dwarfs due to environmental effects ( e.g. , ram pressure stripping ) , required to make their number density consistent with the observations .",
    "the lsb dwarfs found in our field are similar to dwarfs found , e.g. , by @xcite , @xcite or @xcite but are considerably fainter .",
    "in particular we have only one dwarf in common with @xcite : in our data the `` k '' dwarf ( lsbvcc025 ) appears more diffuse with a scale radius twice larger .",
    "this is a combined effect of the larger depth of our data and of our galfit analysis , which shows that appropriate photometry can be derived only after removing the faint background sources present inside the lsb profile ( see figure 4 ) .",
    "for this reason , a direct comparison between the magnitudes derived by us and by @xcite must take into account the contribution by the faint interlopers , which amounts to @xmath60 . by assuming an average @xmath61 ( as derived from our table 1 with appropriate interpolation and filter conversion ) we obtain the value @xmath62 as in @xcite .",
    "we have derived physical quantities for the 11 lsb dwarfs fitting the ubriz multicolor data to the synthetic seds based on a grid of models from the @xcite ( bc ) spectral synthesis code .",
    "the synthetic spectra are characterized by exponentially declining star formation histories of timescale @xmath63 and by a set of ages , metallicities and dust extinctions ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite for details ) .",
    "the redshift has been fixed to that of the virgo cluster ( peculiar velocities are irrelevant in this context ) .",
    "the output of this sed fitting procedure is shown in table 1 .",
    "all the galaxies are consistent with a stellar metallicity 0.2 solar and no dust .",
    "the resulting star formation rates ( sfr ) and stellar masses are indicative of old stellar populations with low sfr .",
    "in particular the ratio @xmath64 is indicative of a passively declining stellar population , although this ratio is not as large as in brighter ellipticals ( @xmath65 @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , extrapolating the linear relation between star formation and stellar mass found for the main sequence galaxies in the local universe ( see @xcite ) toward low masses , our dwarfs show average sfrs a factor 10 lower for a given stellar mass with respect to the linear relation , consistent with a quenched star formation phase with typical specific sfr @xmath66 yr@xmath7 .",
    "the main outcome of the present study is the large number density of lsb dwarfs found in a single lbc pointing , corresponding to 11 lsb virgo candidates ( after removing bright extended objects ) in an effective field of 0.12 deg@xmath3 .",
    "the derived projected number density can be compared with corresponding projected densities of brighter virgo galaxies .",
    "we use here the @xcite sample , whose projected lf is computed per square megaparsec , per magnitude and is normalized at a distance from the virgo center ( i.e. m87 position ) of 200 kpc .",
    "we split our small sample into two bins ( each 2 mags wide , one centered at @xmath67 and one at at @xmath68 ) that contain 4 and 7 candidates , respectively .    adopting for virgo the angular scale of 80 pc arcsec@xmath7",
    "we obtain a density of 200 and 350 objects mpc@xmath44 mag@xmath7 in our two bins at the position of our field , which is about 1.3 deg or 340 kpc from m87 .",
    "to rescale to 200 kpc for comparison with the @xcite lf we have adopted their projected radial density distribution of brighter virgo galaxies .",
    "we derive an increase by a factor @xmath69 from 340 to 200 kpc .",
    "the resulting projected densities of lsb dwarfs at 200 kpc scale to 320 and 560 mpc@xmath44 mag@xmath7 , respectively .",
    "these two average densities derived in our relatively small field are shown in figure 5 together with lf data adapted from @xcite . under the hypothesis",
    "that the small lsb dwarfs are distributed following the smooth gravitational potential well of the virgo cluster we assume that the derived density is a fair representation of the average lsb dwarf density at @xmath70 kpc from the virgo center .",
    "we explicitly neglect any possible dwarf clustering or anti - clustering around the bright virgo galaxies .",
    "our sample shows an excess at @xmath71 compared to the lf of @xcite but it is difficult to ascertain whether this is due to a real deviation of the lf from a schechter shape ( @xcite ) or to observational biases which produce deviations from a featureless faint - end power law ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in practice",
    "the lf is derived by connecting points from @xcite brighter than @xmath72 , which are mainly based on the vcc survey ( @xcite ) , with our two faint bins .",
    "the resulting slope is @xmath73 and it is shown in figure 5 .",
    "we also show in the same figure a flatter @xmath74 and steeper @xmath75 slope for comparison .",
    "our value is consistent with very recent estimates derived from the overall virgo region by @xcite @xmath76 , in the @xmath55 band .",
    "however , their slope evaluation is limited to @xmath77 which corresponds to @xmath78 assuming @xmath26 .",
    "although statistically limited by the small lbc area , our complementary data allows us to probe the extension of the lf slope about 4 magnitudes fainter .",
    "the presence of a significant density of faint dwarfs in a rich cluster like virgo can put interesting constraints on the nature of dark matter and on the physical mechanisms regulating galaxy star formation activity . in dm scenarios ,",
    "galaxies form at the center of dm halos collapsed in over - dense regions . following the progressive inclusion of previously collapsed halos into larger and larger structures , the central massive galaxies",
    "are then surrounded by a number of satellites whose abundance depends on the nature of dm and on the baryonic physics driving the process of galaxy formation .",
    "cdm models tend to predict a large number density of small - mass galaxies ( @xmath79 ) , significantly higher than is observed ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "in particular cdm models predict faint - end slopes of the galaxy lf that are much steeper than observed unless strong feedback from star formation activity is assumed , particularly for the dwarf galaxy population ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the feedback should be strong enough to inhibit all star formation in many small cdm halos as recently suggested by @xcite . in this case",
    ", simple abundance matching between simulated dm halos and observed galaxies would not apply .",
    "alternatively , the power of the dm spectrum at small scales can be reduced if density perturbations are damped below some characteristic scale by the action of the free streaming of wdm particles with thermal relic mass of the order of @xmath80 kev , see e.g. , @xcite .",
    "this would decrease the predicted number density of small dm halos , reducing the tension with the observed dwarf number density .",
    "note that the suppression of the power spectrum with respect to the cdm case directly depends on the particle mass @xmath81 if the candidate is a thermal relic . for sterile neutrinos",
    ", the same suppression is obtained for a mass @xmath82 if the sterile neutrinos are produced from oscillations with active neutrinos in the @xcite scenario ( see @xcite ) . for different production mechanisms ( see @xcite ) the conversion factor @xmath83 ranges between 2 and 4 ( see @xcite ) .    here",
    "we discuss the potential implications of our findings , and especially the constraints on the mass of the wdm particles .",
    "in particular , we compare the faint - end slope of the lf shown in figure 5 with those derived from the sub - halo mass function in different dm models , including a proper treatment of the present uncertainty on the @xmath84 ratio of dwarf galaxies .",
    "the mass dependence of the cumulative mass function can be described by a universal form @xmath85^{\\alpha_{dm}}$ ] , independent of the mass of the host structure @xmath86 , with an exponent determined by the assumed power spectrum .",
    "cdm simulations yield @xmath87 ( see also @xcite ) , while smaller slopes are derived for wdm particles with mass @xmath88 kev ( see , e.g. , knebe et al .",
    "2005 ; maccio & fontanot 2010 ; lovell et al .",
    "2014 ) .    to derive the slope for different wdm models we need to explore the effects of different power spectra ( corresponding to different dm particle masses ) on the dynamical evolution of sub - halos .",
    "while full high - resolution n - body simulations provide complete theoretical tools to perform such computations , they are also extremely time consuming and are generally applied to study specific dm models .",
    "in addition , they are limited in resolution to sub - halo masses @xmath89 . to effectively explore a wide range of dm ( thermal relic ) candidate masses ( @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 kev , and the cdm case @xmath93 kev ) with a resolution extending down to @xmath94",
    ", we adopt a semi - analytic model ( see @xcite for a review of n - body and semi - analytic models as theoretical tools to study galaxy formation ) .",
    "this model ( see @xcite , @xcite for details ) follows the merging histories of dm halos and sub - halos through a monte carlo simulation of the collapse and subsequent merging history of the peaks of the primordial density field .",
    "this lets us generate a synthyetic catalogue of model dm halos and of their past merging histories .",
    "although the model can include a specific treatment of the baryonic physics inside the halo s evolution ( e.g. , gas cooling , star formation etc . ) , we prefer to derive constraints on the wdm particle mass assuming a general parametric power - law dependence between the galaxy luminosity and the total dm mass .",
    "the model includes the main processes affecting the dynamical evolution of sub - haloes within larger dm haloes , i.e. , dynamical friction , merging , and stripping .",
    "for a recent comparison of the dynamics of sub - halos in semi - analytic models and n - body simulations see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we first tested our semi - analytic modeling of the sub - halo population against previous works in specific test cases where detailed results are available . in the left panel of figure 6",
    "we have compared the sub - halo mass function obtained from our model with those obtained by @xcite for a cdm spectrum and for a wdm spectrum corresponding to a thermal relic particle mass @xmath91 kev .",
    "those authors adopt a semi - analytic model calibrated and tested through the comparison with ultra high - resolution n - body simulations .",
    "the average slopes of the sub - halo mass functions we derive match the existing results not only for the cdm case ( black curve , black points ) but also for the wdm case ( red dotted curve , red points ) with @xmath91 kev .",
    "as we increase the relic wdm particle masses in our model , we obtain increasing slopes for the dm sub - halo mass distribution .",
    "in particular we obtained @xmath95 for @xmath90 kev , @xmath96 for @xmath91 kev , @xmath97 for @xmath92 kev , and @xmath98 for the cdm case .    to convert the sub - halo mass distribution @xmath99 into a lf ( i.e. a @xmath100 ) we parametrize the mass - to - light ratio at low masses as @xmath101 ( @xcite ) ,",
    "so that the slope of the lf can be written as @xmath102 assuming proportionality between the galaxy luminosity and stellar mass .",
    "this turns out to be a good approximation for a limited range of ( faint ) magnitudes and for fairly old stellar populations .",
    "both assumptions are satisfied here according to our sed fitting .",
    "since at present substantial uncertainty affects the measured @xmath84 ratio for dwarf galaxies , our strategy is based on bracketing the present uncertainty by exploring values of @xmath103 in a wide range from 1 to 3 .",
    "a value of @xmath104 is derived from abundance matching techniques ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) assuming a standard cuspy ( e.g. navarro , frenk & white ) inner density cdm profiles for the observed satellites in the local group . in this case",
    "only a fraction of cdm halos can host galaxies .",
    "more complex and shallower density profiles assuming a dynamical interaction between baryons and dm halos are consistent with a shallower slope @xmath105 ( see @xcite and @xcite for both cases ) .",
    "assuming that all halos host a galaxy , we can then derive the slope @xmath106 of the lf obtained in different cdm / wdm scenarios as a function of the assumed value for @xmath103 , and compare it with our measured value @xmath107 derived from our dwarf sample .",
    "the output of this exercise is shown in the right panel of figure 6 .",
    "we confirm that the cdm model needs a relatively large value of @xmath108 to be compatible with the data . in the case of wdm models , we are able to set a lower limit of @xmath109 kev to be consistent with the measured slope @xmath106 , adopting lower values of @xmath110 . on the contrary , wdm models with @xmath111 kev are not able to provide the observed faint - end lf slope if @xmath112 represents a reasonable lower limit for the @xmath84 relation .",
    "of course , our low limit on the wdm particle mass could even increase if we allow for a complete inhibition of star formation in a fraction of the low - mass sub - halo population due to reionization and background uv radiation , as suggested for instance by @xcite .",
    "this limit compares well with other existing limits .",
    "lower limits @xmath113 kev have been derived from galaxy counts in the hubble ultra deep field ( @xcite ) , while limits @xmath114 kev have been derived from the abundance of ultra - faint milky way satellites measured in the sloan digital sky survey ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "much tighter constraints , @xmath115 kev ( e.g. @xcite ) , have been derived by comparing the observed lyman-@xmath106 forest of high- resolution ( @xmath116 ) quasar spectra with hydrodynamical n - body simulations .",
    "various uncertainties may still affect these constraints ( see discussions in @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the comparison of subhalos to milky way dwarfs assumes a factor @xmath117 correction for the number of dwarfs being missed by current surveys , and lower correction factors would appreciably weaken the constraints .",
    "lyman-@xmath106 absorption is also a challenging tool and requires disentangling the effects of pressure support and thermal broadening from those caused by dm spectrum , as well as assumptions on the thermal history of the intergalactic medium and of the ionizing background .",
    "we have used deep lbc exposures obtained in five bands ( ubriz ) over a @xmath2 arcmin@xmath3 pointing located within the virgo field to find and study faint lsb dwarfs associated with the virgo cluster at an unprecedented depth of @xmath118 . despite the relatively small field of view",
    ", we detect in the @xmath34 band as many as 11 lsb dwarfs in the magnitude interval @xmath4 , which we identify as virgo members on the basis of their position in the @xmath119 plane .",
    "due to the significant depth of our images , their morphology appears to be contaminated by smaller , or compact sources , most likely in the background , which would affect the estimate of their total flux and morphological parameters . to remove them from our analysis",
    ", we have used galfit to separately model the lsb dwarfs and the other sources , in order to derive contamination - free morphological parameters and magnitudes .",
    "this procedure has been applied to all images in five bands .",
    "we find that our sources have scale radii @xmath5 pc and an average red color @xmath120 . based on this evidence",
    ", we claim that these sources represent the faintest extremes of the population of low luminosity lsb dwarfs that has been recently detected in wider surveys of the virgo cluster ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the average ratio between the age of the last episode of star formation and the exponentially declining star formation timescale @xmath121 indicates a passively evolving phase with a specific sfr of @xmath66 yr@xmath7 .",
    "they are older ( @xmath122 gyr ) than the typical cluster formation age and appear regular in morphology .",
    "we have converted our detections into average projected number densities , normalized at 200 kpc from the virgo center , computed in two magnitude bins centered at @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",
    "we find a number density of 320 and 560 sources mpc@xmath44 mag@xmath7 , respectively .",
    "these results allow us to extend the estimate of the virgo lf down to very faint limits .",
    "merging our data with the brighter points mainly based on the vcc survey , we find an average faint - end slope of about @xmath125 down to @xmath126 .",
    "it is well known that the relatively shallow slope of the lf sets challenging constraints on dark matter scenarios .",
    "strong baryonic feedback processes must be invoked to reconcile the intriniscally steep cdm slopes with the observed flatter lf .",
    "instead , we explore the alternative options , i.e. , those provided by wdm scenarios with particles of @xmath127kev mass scale .    using our semi - analytic model @xcite",
    "we show that the slope @xmath128 we derive for the lf can be translated into an interesting low limit on the wdm particle mass @xmath12 kev , regardless of the exact relation present at low masses between the @xmath84 ratio and the halo mass @xmath129 ( i.e. regardless of the details of the baryonic feedback processes ) .",
    "this limit compares well with previous limits derived from galaxy counts in the hubble ultra deep field ( @xcite ) , from the abundance of ultra - faint milky way satellites in the sloan digital sky survey ( see @xcite ) or from the observed lyman-@xmath106 forest ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it is intriguing to see that this small but non - negligible sample has been detected in a single pointing taken with a @xmath130 imager at an 8 m telescope ( lbc at lbt in this case ) .",
    "while it is still limited by the small area surveyed so far and by the lack of spectroscopic follow up , the extension of the same analysis to a larger virgo region using deep ( 2 - 4h of exposure time per band ) multicolor images at 8 m class telescopes is clearly needed to reduce the current uncertainties .",

    "<S> we have discovered 11 ultra - faint ( @xmath0 ) low surface brightness ( lsb , central surface brightness @xmath1 ) dwarf galaxy candidates in one deep virgo field of just @xmath2 arcmin@xmath3 obtained by the large binocular camera ( lbc ) at the large binocular telescope ( lbt ) . </S>",
    "<S> their association with the virgo cluster is supported by their distinct position in the central surface brightness - total magnitude plane with respect to the background galaxies of similar total magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> they have typical absolute magnitudes and scale sizes , if at the distance of virgo , in the range @xmath4 and @xmath5 pc , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> their colors are consistent with a gradually declining star formation history with a specific star formation rate of the order of @xmath6 yr@xmath7 , i.e. 10 times lower than that of main sequence star forming galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> they are older than the cluster formation age and appear regular in morphology . </S>",
    "<S> they represent the faintest extremes of the population of low luminosity lsb dwarfs that has been recently detected in wider surveys of the virgo cluster . </S>",
    "<S> thanks to the depth of our observations we are able to extend the virgo luminosity function down to @xmath8 ( corresponding to total masses @xmath9 m@xmath10 ) , finding an average faint - end slope @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> this relatively steep slope puts interesting constraints on the nature of the dark matter and in particular on warm dark matter ( wdm ) often invoked to solve the overprediction of the dwarf number density by the standard cdm scenario . </S>",
    "<S> we derive a lower limit on the wdm particle mass @xmath12 kev . </S>"
