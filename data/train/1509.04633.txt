    "ultra - relativistic heavy ion collisions are studied mainly to understand the properties of strongly interacting matter under extreme conditions of high energy densities when the creation of the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) is expected .",
    "the results obtained in a broad collision energy range by experiments at the super proton synchrotron ( sps ) at cern , the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) at bnl , and at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern indeed suggest that in collisions of heavy nuclei such a state with sub - hadronic degrees of freedom appears when the system is sufficiently hot and dense .",
    "the phase diagram of strongly interacting matter is most often presented in terms of temperature ( @xmath5 ) and baryochemical potential ( @xmath6 ) , which reflects net - baryon density .",
    "it is commonly believed that for large values of @xmath6 the phase transition is of the first order and turns into a rapid but continuous transition ( cross - over ) for low @xmath6 values .",
    "a critical point of second order ( cp ) separates these two regions .",
    "the phase diagram can be scanned by varying the energy and the size of the colliding nuclei and the cp is believed to cause a maximum of fluctuations in the measured final state particles . more specifically , the cp is expected to lead not only to non - poissonian distributions of event quantities like multiplicities or average transverse momentum  @xcite , but also to intermittent behavior of low - mass @xmath7 pair and proton production with power - law exponents calculable in qcd  @xcite .",
    "the na49 experiment at the cern  sps  @xcite pioneered the exploration of the phase diagram by an energy scan for central pb+pb collisions in the range 20@xmath0 to 158@xmath0  gev ( @xmath8  =  6.317.3  gev ) , as well as a system size scan at the top sps energy of 158@xmath0  gev .",
    "evidence was found  @xcite that quark / gluon deconfinement sets in at a beam energy of about 30@xmath0  gev .",
    "thus the sps energy range is a region where the cp could be located . at present the search for the critical point is vigorously pursued by the na61/shine collaboration at the sps  @xcite and by the beam energy scan program bes at rhic  @xcite .",
    "the na49 experiment already measured multiplicity fluctuations in terms of the scaled variance @xmath9 of the distribution of event multiplicity @xmath10  @xcite and event - by - event fluctuations of the transverse momentum of the particles employing the strongly intensive measure @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "the present paper reports a continuation of this na49 study by analyzing two new strongly intensive measures of event - by - event transverse momentum and multiplicity fluctuations , @xmath3 $ ] and @xmath4 $ ] @xcite .",
    "these measures are dimensionless and have scales given by two reference values , namely they are equal to zero in case of no fluctuations and one in case of independent particle production . unlike @xmath2",
    "they allow to classify the strength of fluctuations on a common scale .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "in thermodynamics _ extensive _ quantities are those which are proportional to the system volume .",
    "examples of extensive quantities in this case are the mean multiplicity or the variance of the multiplicity distribution . in contrast , _ intensive _ quantities are defined such that they do not depend on the volume of the system .",
    "it was shown @xcite that the ratio of two extensive quantities is an intensive quantity , and therefore , the ratio of mean multiplicities , as well as the commonly used scaled variance of the distribution of the multiplicity @xmath10 , @xmath11 = ( \\langle n^2 \\rangle - \\langle n \\rangle ^2)/ \\langle n \\rangle$ ] , are intensive measures .",
    "finally , one can define a class of _ strongly intensive _ quantities which depend neither on the volume of the system nor on the volume fluctuations within the event ensemble .",
    "such quantities can be truly attractive when studying heavy ion collisions , where the volume of the produced matter can not be fixed and may change significantly from one event to another .",
    "examples of strongly intensive quantities are mean multiplicity ratios , the @xmath12 measure of fluctuations @xcite , and the recently introduced @xmath13 and @xmath14 measures of fluctuations @xcite .",
    "in fact , it was shown @xcite that there are at least two families of strongly intensive measures : @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the previously introduced measure @xmath12 is a member of the @xmath14-family .    in nucleus - nucleus collisions",
    "the volume is expected to vary from event to event and these changes are impossible to eliminate fully .",
    "thus , the strongly intensive quantities allow , at least partly , to overcome the problem of volume fluctuations .",
    "generally , the @xmath13 and @xmath14 measures can be calculated for _ any _ two extensive quantities @xmath0 and @xmath15 . in this paper @xmath15",
    "is taken to be the _ accepted _ particle multiplicity , @xmath10 ( @xmath16 ) , and @xmath0 the sum of their transverse momenta @xmath17 ( @xmath18 , the summation runs over the transverse momenta @xmath19 of all _ accepted _ particles in a given event ) . following refs .",
    "@xcite the quantities @xmath3 $ ] and @xmath4 $ ] are defined as :    @xmath20= \\frac { 1}{\\langle n \\rangle \\omega(p_{t } ) } [ \\langle n \\rangle \\omega[p_t ] - \\langle p_t \\rangle \\omega[n ] ] \\ ] ]    and    @xmath21 = \\frac { 1}{\\langle n \\rangle \\omega(p_{t } ) } [ \\langle n \\rangle \\omega[p_t ]   + \\langle p_t \\rangle \\omega[n ] - 2 ( \\langle p_t n \\rangle - \\langle p_t \\rangle \\langle n \\rangle ) ] , \\ ] ]    where : @xmath22 = \\frac { \\langle { p_t}^2 \\rangle - { \\langle p_t \\rangle}^2 }   { \\langle p_t \\rangle}\\ ] ] and @xmath23 = \\frac { \\langle n^2 \\rangle - { \\langle n \\rangle}^2 } { \\langle n \\rangle}\\ ] ]    are the scaled variances of the two fluctuating extensive quantities @xmath17 and @xmath10 , respectively . the brackets @xmath24 represent averaging over events .",
    "the quantity @xmath25 is the scaled variance of the _ inclusive _ @xmath26 distribution ( all accepted particles and events are used ) :    @xmath27    equations  ( [ delta_eq ] ) and ( [ sigma_eq ] ) can be used only when assuming that @xmath25 is not equal to zero .",
    "there is an important difference between the @xmath3 $ ] and @xmath4 $ ] measures . only the first two moments : @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 , @xmath31 are required to calculate @xmath3 $ ] , whereas @xmath4 $ ] includes also the correlation term @xmath32 .",
    "therefore @xmath3 $ ] and @xmath4 $ ] can be sensitive to various physics effects in different ways . in ref .",
    "@xcite all strongly intensive quantities containing the correlation term are named the @xmath14 family , whereas those based only on mean values and variances the @xmath13 family .",

    "@xcite these quantities are dimensionless and have a common scale making possible a quantitative comparison of fluctuations of different , in general dimensional , extensive quantities .",
    "the basic properties of the @xmath3 $ ] and @xmath4 $ ] measures are the following :    1 .   _",
    "absence of fluctuations_. in the absence of event - by - event fluctuations ( @xmath34 , @xmath35 ) the values of @xmath3 $ ] and @xmath4 $ ] are equal to zero . 2",
    ".   _ independent particle model _ ( ipm ) .",
    "if the system consists of particles that are emitted independently from each other ( no inter - particle correlations ) @xmath3",
    "$ ] and @xmath4 $ ] are equal to one . for this case",
    "@xmath36 vanishes .",
    "_ model of independent sources _ ( mis ) .",
    "when particles are emitted by a number ( @xmath37 ) of identical sources , which are independent of each other and @xmath38 is the distribution of this number , then @xmath3(n_s)$ ] and @xmath4(n_s)$ ] are independent of @xmath37 ( intensive measures ) and of its distribution @xmath38 ( strongly intensive measures ) .",
    "the @xmath36 measure has the same property .",
    "an example of mis is the wounded nucleon model ( wnm ) @xcite , where @xmath39 ( number of wounded nucleons ) .",
    "another example is a model where nucleus - nucleus ( @xmath40 ) collisions are an incoherent superposition of many independent nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath41 ) interactions . for these cases",
    "all three fluctuation measures , namely @xmath36 , @xmath3 $ ] and @xmath4 $ ] , are independent of the number of sources ( and therefore insensitive to the centrality of the collisions ) and have the same values for @xmath40 and @xmath41 collisions .    the measures @xmath3 $ ] and @xmath4 $ ] have similar advantages to @xmath11 $ ] .",
    "like @xmath11 $ ] they have two reference values , namely @xmath11 $ ] equals zero when the multiplicity is constant from event to event and one for a poisson multiplicity distribution .",
    "therefore one can judge whether fluctuations are large (  @xmath42   ) or small (  @xmath43   ) compared to independent particle production .",
    "however , @xmath11 $ ] is not a strongly intensive quantity , and in the mis one finds @xmath11(n_s$ ] sources ) = @xmath11 $ ] ( 1 source ) + @xmath44 $ ] , where @xmath45 is the mean multiplicity of particles from a single source and @xmath46 $ ] represents fluctuations of @xmath37 .",
    "a comparison of the properties of @xmath3 $ ] , @xmath4 $ ] , and @xmath36 is presented in table [ measures_tab ] .",
    "the quantities @xmath3 $ ] and @xmath4 $ ] were studied in several models .",
