    "it was suggested long ago by witten@xcite that fundamental superstrings ( f - strings ) of macroscopic length could be observed in the form of cosmic strings .",
    "after the discovery of @xmath4-branes@xcite , it is natural to expect that a similar role could be played by other extended objects of string theory such as @xmath5-branes wrapped around internal @xmath6-cycles .",
    "it is interesting that brane inflation@xcite generically predicts the formation of such objects , whereas the formation of point - like or wall - like extended objects is suppressed@xcite .",
    "various aspects of the dynamics , formation and evolution of cosmic @xmath7 and @xmath0strings have been discussed in @xcite .",
    "needless to say that a possible observation of these objects would provide a direct window into string theory .",
    "thus , both from an observational as well as from the fundamental point of view it is important to understand the precise nature and structure of the _ stringy _ cosmic strings .",
    "this is the motivation that led to the present work .",
    "we shall derive non - singular bps string solutions which resemble many of the features of the @xmath0strings .",
    "following the conjecture in @xcite , which we review below , we interpret our solutions as the @xmath0strings of string theory . independently from the conjecture the solutions presented in this paper are new bps objects which have interest of their own : they are the first example of finite energy cosmic strings coupled to an axion field .    in trying to understand the @xmath2 picture of the @xmath0strings , it is useful to consider their description in terms of sen s tachyonic vortices formed on the worldvolume of a higher dimensional unstable @xmath0brane - anti-@xmath0brane ( @xmath8 ) pair@xcite .",
    "for example , a @xmath9-brane in ten dimensions can be viewed as a tachyonic vortex on the worldvolume of a @xmath10 pair .",
    "this vortex originates as follows .",
    "the gauge symmetry of the system consists of two @xmath11 s belonging to the worldvolume theories of the @xmath12 and @xmath13 respectively .",
    "the tachyon ( @xmath14 ) , which is an excitation of an open string stretched between the two branes , is charged under the diagonal combination of the two @xmath11 s .",
    "when the branes annihilate , the tachyon condenses and this gauge symmetry is higgsed .",
    "since the tachyonic vacuum is topologically non - trivial @xcite , there are topologically stable vortex configurations , analogous to abrikosov - nielsen - olesen @xcite flux tubes , which carry magnetic flux of the higgsed @xmath11 .",
    "these flux tubes are the @xmath15strings . in this picture",
    "we can understand their ramond - ramond ( rr ) charge as originating from the wess - zumino coupling on the @xmath16 worldvolume .",
    "] , @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the rr two - form and @xmath19 denotes the field strength of the diagonal @xmath11 gauge field .",
    "after compactification to four dimensions @xmath15strings become cosmic strings .",
    "since in ten dimensions @xmath0branes preserve half of the supersymmetries , in @xmath2 it should be possible to find some kind of cosmic @xmath4-strings which are still bps saturated objects .",
    "it is therefore natural to ask whether there are such solitons in @xmath2 supergravity . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that the only bps gauge strings in supergravity are @xmath4-term strings .",
    "these are the strings that are formed by higgsing a @xmath11 gauge symmetry due to the presence of a fayet - iliopoulos ( fi ) @xmath4-term .",
    "because of this fact , it was conjectured that @xmath4-strings , if they have any solitonic counterpart in the effective four dimensional field theory description , must be represented by some form of bps @xmath4-term strings .",
    "the `` _ @xmath4-string @xmath4-term - string equivalence _ ''",
    "conjecture leads to the conclusion that the energy density stored in an unstable @xmath20 pair is a @xmath4-term associated with the fi term of the worldvolume @xmath11 that is higgsed by the tachyon . therefore , in the ten dimensional limit",
    ", the effective potential for the tachyon is schematically , @xmath21 where the ellipses stand for all the other charged fields in the system .",
    "these fields have positive mass squared and vanish throughout the annihilation process .",
    "it follows from ( [ dterm1 ] ) that the fi term @xmath22 is related to the @xmath12 brane tension by @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the @xmath12 tension and @xmath25 is the @xmath11 gauge coupling constant .",
    "in the ten dimensional limit , the annihilation proceeds solely through the tachyon condensation , which compensates the fi term in ( [ dterm1 ] ) .",
    "the resulting @xmath0strings are purely tachyonic vortices , carrying ten dimensional rr charge . under the term",
    "_ purely tachyonic _",
    "what is meant here is that the only winding phase responsible for the topological stability of the string , and consequently for the existence of the magnetic flux , is the phase of the tachyon . from eq .",
    "( [ wz1 ] ) it follows that the electric rr charge of the @xmath15brane arises from the quantized magnetic flux carried by the vortex .    the effect of compactification on the above system is rather profound .",
    "first , after dimensional reduction we are left with the zero mode of the rr two - form , @xmath18 , which in four dimensions is dual to an axion field @xmath26 . in a supersymmetric scenario the axion has a scalar partner @xmath27 .",
    "is related to the dilaton and the volume modulus .",
    "in general the axion of the four dimensional theory arises from the zero mode of a ramond - ramond field @xmath28 with two of the indices in the large dimensions . ]",
    "dualizing the two - form one generically obtains the following term in the action @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 is the four dimensional planck mass . from this",
    "we see that the wess - zumino term ( [ wz1 ] ) gauges the shift symmetry of the axion . from eq .",
    "( [ axiondual ] ) it is also clear that after compactification , the worldvolume @xmath11 symmetry is always in the higgs phase , even when the tachyon vacuum expectation value ( vev ) is set to zero .",
    "the mass of the gauge field of course vanishes in the infinite space limit , as @xmath32 .",
    "another effect of the compactification is that the @xmath4-term potential ( [ dterm1 ] ) aquires an @xmath27-dependent contribution , @xmath33 notice that this correction too dies off in the decompactified limit .",
    "this fact is consistent with the picture that in ten dimensions @xmath4-strings are purely tachyonic vortices whose tension is set by the fi term @xmath22 .",
    "previous attempts to derive solutions for @xmath4-strings as bps solitons in four - dimensions were in the following directions . as we have already mentioned , in @xcite smooth bps @xmath4-term string solutions were derived in the presence of a fi term @xmath22 , but the dilaton - axion multiplet was not included in the solution .",
    "notice however that this is consistent with supersymmetrically removing this multiplet as shown in @xcite . in @xcite",
    "axionic string solutions were studied in a model in which the @xmath11 anomalies are cancelled by green - schwarz ( gs ) mechanism .",
    "although this model is primarily motivated by the heterotic @xmath34 compactification , it nevertheless shares some similarities with the type ii string compactifications that are our main interest .",
    "the low energy effective actions are very similar , with the crucial difference that in the heterotic theory the existence of a dilaton - independent part of fi term @xmath22 is not obvious and was not included in @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the string solutions found in these models are either singular or break all the supersymmetries .    in this paper",
    "we show that the presence of the @xmath22 term in ( [ dterm2 ] ) allows us to construct smooth bps @xmath0string solutions .",
    "other than being new interesting bps objects , their existence provides an additional support for the conjecture of @xcite .",
    "some complementary string theoretic evidence for this conjecture was also provided in @xcite , where @xmath0term strings were identified in intersecting brane systems",
    ". a discussion of @xmath0term strings in the context of wrapped branes has also appeared in @xcite .",
    "let us also mention that , while we only study in detail supersymmetric strings , the bps properties of @xmath0strings on a background such as flux compactifications @xcite or the deformed conifold @xcite may be lost .    in the present work we focus on explicit field theoretic solutions for @xmath0strings and then interpret them in the framework of @xmath0brane systems .",
    "actually we find two different types of smooth bps cosmic string solutions , both of which have an interpretation in string theory : +   +   + the first type of solutions , which fits all the features of the @xmath4-strings , is the tachyonic vortex . in this case",
    "the magnetic flux is induced by the winding of the tachyon phase , and not by the axion . at large distances from the core",
    "the asymptotic values of the fields for this solution are , @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the angular coordinate in the plane perpendicular to the string . as we will show the asymptotically infinite value of @xmath27 is the only way to avoid the logarithmic divergence of the energy in this case .",
    "such a divergence would be incompatible with the bps condition .",
    "since @xmath27 represents a combination of the dilaton and the volume modulus , the space gets decompactified ( or the @xmath2 effective coupling goes to zero ) at large distances from the core .",
    "this effect however happens very slowly since @xmath27 depends only logarithmically on the distance .",
    "+   +   + in the second class of solutions the tachyon vev vanishes at infinity , and the magnetic flux is induced by the winding of the axion .",
    "@xmath27 now goes asymptotically to a constant in such a way to compensate the @xmath22 term in the potential ( [ dterm2 ] ) .",
    "these strings can be interpreted as the vortices produced by higgsing the @xmath11 group of a @xmath1 pair by compactification , as opposed to tachyon condensation .",
    "thus , far away from the string core the tachyon mass is zero and the branes do not annihilate .",
    "the tachyon may only develop an expectation value in the core of the string .",
    "the existence of a bps configuration on a background with a @xmath16 pair may come as a surprise , because in ten - dimensions this background breaks all the supersymmetries ( for an exception see @xcite ) .",
    "however , the identification of the @xmath16 tension with the @xmath4-term energy density suggests that tachyon condensation may not be the only way for restoring part of the supersymmetries once the effects of the compactification are taken into account . instead",
    ", the fi term may be compensated by the dilaton @xmath27 .",
    "the corresponding bps strings are then the @xmath3strings . +",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we describe the supersymmetric models that we will be considering . in section 3",

    "we end with some conclusions and future directions .",
    "for the globally supersymmetric case the effective @xmath37 lagrangian that we will consider takes the following form in superspace ( we follow the conventions in @xcite ) , @xmath38 + \\int d^2\\theta ~\\frac 1 4 f(s ) w^\\alpha w_\\alpha+ h.c . \\label{lagrangian}\\ ] ] @xmath39 are chiral fields with integer @xmath11 charges @xmath40 . since the @xmath11 symmetry is linearly realized on the @xmath39 for simplicity we will consider the minimal khler potential for this superfield .",
    "the axion is contained in a chiral superfield @xmath41 whose lowest component is @xmath42 where @xmath27 is ( loosely speaking ) the dilaton .",
    "invariance of the action under a constant shift of the axion demands that the khler potential @xmath43 is a function of @xmath44 .",
    "this shift symmetry is gauged under the @xmath11 . in the string",
    "motivated models that we have in mind one typically finds khler potentials of the form @xmath45 $ ] ( up to a numerical coefficient ) so we will study this case in detail even though most of our results hold for any @xmath46 .    as far as the string theory motivation is concerned , we will use ( [ lagrangian ] ) as the prototype lagrangian describing interactions of the open string tachyon @xmath14 ( represented by lowest component of one of the @xmath39 ) and the complexified rr axion @xmath47 in type ii compactifications with @xmath1 background .",
    "we shall show that these fields are sufficient to describe non - singular bps @xmath4-string solutions .",
    "it is important to stress that ( [ lagrangian ] ) is not the complete low energy action , because a @xmath1 system contains other light fields , e.g. , such as the brane - separation mode .",
    "however , these additional fields can be consistently ignored .",
    "note that the action above is similar to the one of @xmath34 heterotic string compactifications in which the @xmath11 anomalies are cancelled by the green - schwarz mechanism , but with the important difference that we include a constant ( moduli independent ) fi term @xmath22 . for type ii compactifications ,",
    "such constant term is necessary in order to account for the @xmath1 tension , which should survive in the ten - dimensional limit . as we shall show",
    "this term is crucial for the existence of non - singular bps @xmath4-string solutions . in this respect",
    "our action differs from the one considered in @xcite in which no @xmath22 term was included , and consequently no smooth bps string solutions were found .",

    "gauge invariance of the action then fixes @xmath54 to be a constant and @xmath55 to be arbitrary .",
    "when the sum of the charges is different from zero the theory has mixed anomalies . in any consistent theory all the gauge anomalies must vanish . in this case",
    "the anomaly can be cancelled by the green - schwarz mechanism applied to four dimensions @xcite by choosing the gauge kinetic function @xmath56 .",
    "the axion has a universal coupling of the form @xmath57 . under the gauge transformation the axion shifts and",
    "generates a contribution to the anomaly which cancels the one of the matter sector .",

    "the pseudo - anomalous case requires only minor modifications .",
    "the vacuum manifold corresponds to the zeros of the @xmath0term in ( [ action ] ) , @xmath61 due to the fact that the axion shifts under the @xmath11 gauge transformation the theory is always in the higgs phase in any vacuum . in general",
    "the gauge boson eats a linear combination of the axion and of the phase of the higgs field while the orthogonal combinations remain massless .",
    "the mass of the vector boson is given by , @xmath62 with @xmath27 and @xmath63 lying in the vacuum manifold ( [ vacuum ] ) .",
    "in the supersymmetric vacuum the gauge boson belongs to a massive @xmath37 multiplet .",
    "we consider solitonic string solutions with the fields only varying in the transverse plane @xmath64 .",
    "remarkably for _ any _ khler potential of the form @xmath46 the energy density of this configuration can be organized in the bogomolnyi form , @xmath65 where we have integrated by parts assuming that the boundary term at infinity is zero and is understood that the signs are chosen so that the energy is positive . from this",
    "we can directly read off the bogomolnyi equations , @xmath66 where the covariant derivatives are given in ( [ covariant ] ) .",
    "when the bogomolnyi equations are satisfied the tensions of these solutions is minimal and proportional to the magnetic flux through the string , @xmath67 the minimization of the energy guarantees that the equations of motion are also satisfied .    generically in a supersymmetric theory the bogomolnyi energy bound signals that the solution leaves a fraction of the supersymmetries unbroken , i.e. it is a bps state .",
    "the same holds here .",
    "a configuration of the fields preserves some supersymmetries if the variations of all the fermions is zero for some projection of the supersymmetry parameters .",
    "the transformations of the fermions under supersymmetry evaluated on the bosonic background are given by , @xmath68 where @xmath69 and @xmath70 are the fermionic partners of the scalar fields and @xmath71 is the gaugino .",
    "it is straightforward to check that , when the bogomolnyi equations ( [ bogo ] ) are satisfied , the solutions leave half of the supersymmetries unbroken , so as expected these are bps states .",
    "this guarantees their stability even quantum mechanically .",
    "supersymmetry immediately explains why the bogomolnyi equations do not depend on the khler potential ( except through the @xmath0term ) , giving a rationale for why it was possible to rearrange the energy in the simple bogomolnyi form ( [ bogoenergy ] ) .",
    "it is also easy to see considering the supersymmetry variations , that in the presence of a non zero @xmath7term all the supersymmetries must be broken .",
    "therefore only @xmath0term strings can be bps objects @xcite .",
    "the only exception to this statement is when the superpotential generating the @xmath7term is chosen such that the system has @xmath72 supersymmetry because in this case there is no distinction between @xmath48 and @xmath4 terms @xcite .",
    "however this mechanism does not seem viable in supergravity because it appears to be impossible to construct supersymmetric actions with constant fi terms in @xmath72 supergravity with charged hypermultiplets @xcite .",
    "it is important to stress that when the bps equations are satisfied the tension is equal to the constant fi term @xmath22 times the magnetic flux .",
    "this shows that any attempt to find smooth bps configurations with a field dependent fi term is bound to fail because this configuration would have zero energy and therefore it can only be the vacuum .",
    "of course this leaves the possibility to build singular bps string solutions .",
    "in this section we present the bps string solutions of our model for the relevant case @xmath73 $ ] . for simplicity we first consider the globally supersymmetric case ( here we set @xmath74 ) . we find two classes of string solutions , the ones created by the higgs field @xmath14 and the ones created by the dilaton @xmath27 which have rather different properties .",
    "we consider in some detail the case with constant gauge kinetic function ( corresponding to no anomalies ) .",
    "the case where anomalies are cancelled by the gs mechanism is slightly more complicated but leads to qualitatively similar results that are briefly reported in section [ pseudo ] .",
    "finally we show that our solutions can also be coupled to supergravity preserving their bps nature .",

    "one could construct more general bps strings where several @xmath63 s are different from zero . in fact",
    "our solutions are reminiscent of semilocal strings @xcite and the relation will be clarified in section [ discussion ] .",
    "notice that , while it is consistent with the bps equations ( see below ) to set the other chiral fields to zero , @xmath27 can not be a constant in a supersymmetric configuration because in the bps equations the dilaton is sourced by the gauge field .    using the ansatz above for the fields the bps equations read ,",

    "the precise nature of the potential is model dependent , but the important",
    "fact is that the potential is only generated for the gauge - invariant combination of phases @xmath116 thus , only the strings for which the combination @xmath117 winds at infinity can potentially become boundaries of the domain walls . for the heterotic @xmath48-strings the possibility of becoming boundaries of domain walls",
    "was suggested by witten@xcite and for the @xmath4-strings such a possibility was discussed by copeland , myers and polchinski@xcite .",

    "flat direction is not lifted by the axion - potential .",
    "in such a case the domain walls should `` dissolve '' at infinity , because the potential should vanish in either of the two limits @xmath119 and for @xmath120 .",
    "this follows from the fact that in both of these limits the physical gauge invariant axion becomes ill - defined . ]      in this section we briefly show how the string solutions presented in the previous sections can be coupled to supergravity .",
    "localized lumps of energy with codimension two create an asymptotically conical space - time with a deficit angle at infinity proportional to the tension of the object . at first sight",
    "this suggests that all supersymmetries must be broken when gravity is dynamical because covariantly constant spinors can not be defined on a conical space .",
    "this is the same problem faced and solved in the case of the pure abelian higgs model vortices @xcite ( see also @xcite for related work ) . in the presence of a fi term the gravitino and the supersymmetric parameter @xmath121",
    "become charged under the @xmath11 gauge symmetry so that the gravitino supersymmetric variation has an extra contribution proportional to the gauge connection which cancels exactly the one due to the deficit angle . in this section",

    "we take the following ansatz for the metric , @xmath122 in most general case @xcite one can consider several chiral fields @xmath123 transforming under the @xmath11 symmetry where the transformation corresponds to an isometry of the scalar manifold . in a bosonic background the variations of the fermions read , @xmath124 where @xmath125 are the covariant derivatives of the scalar fields in the theory which can be expressed in terms of the killing vectors of the scalar manifold . for a general khler potential the current @xmath126",

    "this is indeed the case as one can check that ( [ ein00 ] ) is simply the @xmath133 einstein equation for the metric when the bps equations ( [ gravbps ] ) are imposed .",
    "the other equations of motion are also satisfied as the energy can still be cast in the bogomolnyi form ( [ bogoenergy ] ) ( with appropriate metric factors ) .",
    "this concludes the proof that the bps string solutions studied in this paper can be lifted to supergravity .    at large distance from the core of the string",
    "( [ ein00 ] ) can be easily integrated since ( @xmath134 ) go to zero faster than @xmath135 ( this assumption is necessary to write the energy in the bogomolnyi form and is satisfied in our model ) .",

    "these are rather different from the ordinary abelian higgs model strings .",
    "the large @xmath139 dependence of our solutions has a simple and important physical origin .",

    "the two phases of the problem @xmath141 and @xmath26 have periodicities equal to @xmath142 and @xmath143 respectively .",
    "it is then clear that for generic windings of @xmath87 and @xmath86 it is possible to cancel both gradient terms at infinity only if we allow the factors @xmath144 or @xmath145 to go to zero .",
    "in fact this is the behavior of the fields required by the bps equations but we would like to stress that the argument only relies on the finite energy condition .",
    "we therefore have three different asymptotic strategies to find finite energy solutions .",
    "we can cancel the gradient energy associated with the tachyon field by choosing the gauge field appropriately and consequently have @xmath146 as @xmath147 .",
    "these are the @xmath14-strings .",
    "if the axion does not wind ( @xmath90 ) the dilaton goes to a constant at the core implying , contrary to the standard abelian higgs model , that the gauge symmetry is not restored there .",
    "the bps equations however force the fields to be away from the vacuum at the core . at infinity",
    "the gauge symmetry is higgsed by the tachyon field instead .    on the other hand",
    ", we can choose the gauge field such that it cancels the gradient term for the axion forcing @xmath148 as @xmath147 .",
    "these are the @xmath27-strings .",
    "these solutions resemble in some ways the stringy cosmic strings studied in the early nineties @xcite which are also relevant for the description of the @xmath149brane@xcite . in that case",
    "the only field is the complex dilaton @xmath150 and finite energy supersymmetric configurations are achieved by using the @xmath151 invariance of the action .",
    "the solution for @xmath41 is a holomorphic function of the transverse coordinate @xmath152 .",
    "close to the core , @xmath153 which is the same asymptotic solution as for the @xmath3strings .",
    "the divergence of the dilaton at the core was interpreted in @xcite as decompactification of the space or weak coupling . as we will see in the next section",
    "a similar understanding will be very useful to interpret our solutions as the @xmath0strings of string theory .",
    "the last possibility to achieve finite energy is to tune the winding numbers of the two fields in such a way that both gradients are canceled and therefore the string solutions can approach any point of the vacuum manifold at infinity .",
    "the reader might have also noticed close similarities between the strings of this paper and semilocal strings ( see @xcite and refs . therein ) . in the simplest semilocal strings",
    "there is a complex higgs doublet with equal @xmath11 charges .",
    "string solutions can be found for example by setting one of the components of the doublet to zero . in the bogomolnyi",
    "limit the strings can also be made supersymmetric . in this case the stability of the strings is not guaranteed by the topology of the vacuum manifold which is @xmath154 since @xmath155 .",
    "the same holds in our solutions .",
    "even though the vacuum manifold @xmath156 in our case appears different at first sight , we still have @xmath157 .",
    "the axion phase becomes not well defined when @xmath146 so the winding of the axion can be undone by taking @xmath158 without leaving the vacuum manifold .",
    "these solutions are stable because of supersymmetry not because of topology .",
    "another typical feature of the semilocal strings in the bps limit , is the presence of zero modes @xcite beside those due to the breaking of spacetime symmetries .",
    "this is also present in our case since our solutions depend on an arbitrary integration constant @xmath81 which controls the size of the string core .",
    "it is interesting to notice however that this does not lead to extra localized zero modes at least for the @xmath14-strings . to compute the effective action of the string",
    "we promote the integration constant @xmath81 to a field depending on the coordinates of the string . considering the asymptotic expansion of the dilaton for the @xmath75strings ,",
    "@xmath159 it is easy to see that the kinetic term for @xmath81 is badly divergent ( power - like ) .",
    "this implies that this mode is frozen , it can not be excited with any finite energy excitation",
    ". it would be interesting to test numerically whether this mode can be excited in a collision of two strings or whether due to the power divergence of the kinetic term it is always frozen .",
    "for the @xmath3strings the situation is different since @xmath79 approaches the vacuum as a power law and therefore seems to be possible ( and model dependent ) to have an integrable bosonic zero mode in this case .",
    "finally , we should also mention the presence of localized fermionic zero modes . in the globally supersymmetric scenario",
    "there are at least two fermionic zero modes localized on the string due to partial supersymmetry breaking .",
    "these modes are the supersymmetric partners of the translation modes living on the string .",
    "their profile can be obtained as usual by acting on the string background with the broken supersymmetry generators . in supergravity",
    "the story is rather different because , according to a well known argument due to witten @xcite , unbroken supersymmetry does not guarantee fermi - bose degeneracy .",
    "in fact it can be seen @xcite that the fermionic zero modes become non - normalizable when gravity is dynamical so they are projected out of the spectrum of the worldsheet theory .",
    "in this section we argue that the string solutions studied in this paper have a natural interpretation in terms of string theory solitons . to begin with let us review the key argument behind the conjecture of @xcite .",
    "according to this conjecture , in four dimensions any non - singular bps solitonic representation of @xmath4-strings ( admitting an asymptotically locally flat space ) must be some sort of a @xmath0term string .",
    "this can already be argued in a globally supersymmetric limit , but supergravity gives the following general argument ( see section [ supergravity ] ) .",
    "any finite tension ( more precisely @xmath160 ) codimension two object , _ irrespective _ of its core structure , creates a conical angular deficit at infinity .",
    "covariantly constant spinors can not be defined on a conical spacetime , so generically all the supersymmetries are broken .",
    "the only way to avoid this conclusion is if the gravitino is charged under the @xmath11 responsible for the string magnetic flux , because in this case the gravitino variation contains a piece proportional to gauge connection .",
    "the @xmath11 in question is therefore a gauged @xmath161symmetry . in @xmath2 supergravity",
    "the necessary and sufficient condition for the gravitino to carry a @xmath11 charge is the presence of a constant fi term @xmath22 .",
    "this gives the gravitino a charge @xmath162 thus , if bps @xmath4-strings admit a @xmath2 solitonic description , they should be seen as @xmath0term strings with a fi term .",
    "this is the key point of @xcite .",
    "what is the physical origin of this fi term ?",
    "we have seen , that in theories with gs anomaly cancellation there always is a dilaton - dependent contribution to the fi term .",
    "one may naively hope to convert this into a constant fi by stabilizing @xmath27 .",
    "however , there is an obvious reason why such a program can not work@xcite .",
    "even if one imagines that there can be a susy - preserving dynamics that stabilizes @xmath27 , the same dynamics should also get rid of fi term at low energies .",
    "this is because @xmath27 becomes part of a massive vector supermultiplet , and if we supersymetrically integrate out @xmath27 , consistency demands that the whole vector field is integrated out leaving no @xmath0term at low energies .",
    "thus , the constant fi term responsible for the bps @xmath4-strings must be there `` from the beginning '' .",
    "the natural candidate is the tension of the @xmath163 system .",
    "this conjecture passes several consistency checks , in particular it reproduces the correct relation between the @xmath0brane tensions .",
    "however , the solution presented in @xcite was incomplete as bps @xmath0strings should also be charged under ramond - ramond fields which were not included in that solution .",
    "because of this , the above conjecture left some puzzling questions , which our solutions clarify .",
    "+   +   + in ten dimensions @xmath164branes are supersymmetric objects carrying a quantized charge of the @xmath165 ramond - ramond gauge field .",
    "upon compactification to four dimensions a @xmath5-brane can generate strings by wrapping a non trivial @xmath101cycle of the internal manifold .",
    "these strings are will be charged under the two - form arising as the zero mode of the rr field to which the @xmath166brane couplesstrings will remain charged under the four dimensional rr two - form is model dependent as some zero modes may be projected out by the compactification @xcite .",
    "here we imagine a compactification where the relevant zero modes are not projected out . ] . in four dimensions",
    "a two - form is dual to a scalar so the @xmath0string should be an axionic string .",
    "this naively leads to a puzzle because if the string carries an axionic charge @xmath55 , the energy density of the long range field should be @xmath167 which produces a logarithmic divergent energy per unit length .",
    "while the formally infinite energy of a single global string can be acceptable phenomenologically when several strings are included ( such that the total axion charge is equal to zero ) the infinite contribution to the energy of the axion would certainly destroy the bps nature of the solutions .",
    "this would seem to contradict to the expectation that @xmath4-strings are bps saturated objects .",
    "the string solutions found in this paper have precisely the correct properties to solve this puzzle . to be concrete let us consider @xmath9-strings produced in @xmath16 annihilation . when the two branes are far apart , that is at a distance greater than the string length @xmath168 , this system breaks all the supersymmetries",
    ". in the worldvolume description supersymmetry",
    "is broken by the positive energy density of the branes . according to our description ,",
    "this breaking is reproduced in the low energy effective action by a constant fi term .",
    "the normalization is given by ( in string frame ) @xmath169 where @xmath170 is the string coupling and @xmath171 ( we follow the conventions of @xcite ) .",
    "when the branes come closer than @xmath168 a complex tachyon develops in the spectrum of the open strings stretching between the brane - anti - brane pair , signaling an instability of the system .",
    "this is the origin of the tachyon @xmath14 in our effective action .",
    "as explained earlier the gauge symmetry of the @xmath16 pair is @xmath172 and the tachyon is charged with respect to the diagonal subgroup .",
    "the annihilation proceeds through tachyon condensation in which the tachyon compensates the positive energy density restoring the supersymmetric vacuum without @xmath173branes .",
    "this is the essence of sen s tachyon condensation @xcite . in the annihilation process codimension",
    "two objects are produced which are @xmath0strings . in our picture",
    "the strings produced in the annihilation are simply the @xmath75strings created by the winding of the phase of the tachyon .",
    "one can see that the tension has the same scaling as in string theory . in our solution ,",
    "@xmath174 comparing with eq .",
    "( [ t3 ] ) this implies the relation @xmath175 .",
    "this formula has the correct scaling between the yang - mills and string coupling .",
    "the numerical coefficient is also reproduced for @xmath176 .",
    "let us now discuss the rr charges .",
    "the gauge field on the worldvolume of a @xmath12-brane couples to the rr two - form @xmath18 via the wess - zumino coupling , @xmath177 this coupling means that a magnetic flux tube carries the rr charge of @xmath18 in ten dimensions , or in other words it is a @xmath15brane . in the @xmath16 system branes",
    "have opposite rr charges so that @xmath18 couples precisely to the same linear combination under which the tachyon is charged . by compactifying to four dimensions only the zero mode of @xmath18",
    "is kept , leading to an effective action of the form , @xmath178 \\label{action2}\\ ] ] up to numerical factors and coupling to the dilaton . in order to connect our solutions with the string theory picture",
    "it is useful to dualize the axion @xmath26 to a two - form @xmath18 in the lagrangian ( [ action ] ) .",
    "the duality transformation is given by , @xmath179 through which the action takes the form ( [ action2 ] ) .",
    "one can deduce that the axionic charge under the @xmath11 scales as @xmath30 which as expected vanishes in the large volume limit .",
    "the four dimensional rr charge of the string solutions is given by , @xmath180 where the integral is taken over a circle surrounding the string . using eq .",
    "( [ duality ] ) one can see that in all our solutions this integral is zero at infinity signifying that the rr charge , as measured with respect to the zero mode of @xmath18 , is always completely screened at large distances .",
    "notice however that the integral is not zero at finite distances signaling the presence of an effective rr charge .",
    "this behavior , beside being forced by finite energy , has a natural interpretation in the full string theory .",
    "after compactification the four dimensional field @xmath27 is a combination of the radius modulus and the ten dimensional dilaton .",
    "@xmath27 going to infinity therefore corresponds to decompactification of the space ( or alternatively the string coupling going to zero ) .",
    "this is similar to the effect advocated in the stringy cosmic strings @xcite which also plays a crucial rle in the f - theory @xcite .",
    "since the space is opening up new dimensions at large distances it is not surprising that the rr charge goes to zero as measured with the zero mode of the two - form @xmath18 .",
    "similar arguments can be used for the @xmath181 system where @xmath6 dimensions are wrapped on the internal manifold . in this case",
    "@xmath5 objects will be produced , which from a four dimensional point of view are just @xmath0strings .",
    "@xmath5 branes couple to a @xmath182 form . upon",
    "dimensional reduction the @xmath0strings will couple to a two - form arising as a zero mode of @xmath182 so the analysis above can be repeated almost verbatim in this case .",
    "let us now turn to the @xmath3strings .",
    "the above discussion set the stage for a simple interpretation of our @xmath27-string solution in the form of a bps @xmath183 bound state . in the @xmath27-strings",
    "the @xmath1 energy is not compensated by the tachyon , but by the dilaton field .",
    "since the tachyon is not condensed in the vacuum , this suggests that the branes do not annihilate but rather form some sort of boundstate . in ten dimensions the @xmath163 system is unstable but",
    "this is not inconsistent with our findings since compactification is crucial in this case .",
    "in fact even in ten dimension a @xmath184 pair can be made supersymmetric by switching on a constant electric field on the worldvolume @xcite .",
    "in our case it is the magnetic flux that stabilizes the configuration so it would be interesting to investigate the relation between the two solutions .",
    "we should also mention that since asymptotically @xmath27 goes to a constant of order one , it might be that the effective theory breaks down due to strong coupling .",
    "even though we have focused on the @xmath185 system we believe that our @xmath27-type string solutions are more generic and will exist in any compactification in which there is at least one surviving @xmath186-brane with the wess - zumino type coupling @xmath187 between the worldvolume @xmath11 field and the bulk rr @xmath188-form .",
    "the topological reason for the existence of such strings is that in the effective @xmath2 theory the @xmath11 symmetry is higgsed , provided the zero mode of @xmath189 form is not projected out .",
    "this topological argument was already noticed in @xcite and @xcite but no smooth solutions were found . from above it follows that the tachyon plays an irrelevant role for the existence of the @xmath27-strings and its vev can consistently be set to zero .",
    "the purpose of this paper was twofold .",
    "first , we tried to find explicit bps - saturated string solutions in the supersymmetric abelian higgs model coupled to an axion - dilaton multiplet . these are new bps string solutions which arise in string motivated four dimensional models which have interest of their own .",
    "secondly , we gave evidence that the strings in question have the basic features to describe the @xmath4-strings arising from unstable @xmath1 systems in type ii theories . in making this connection",
    "our guidelines were : _ 1 ) _",
    "sen s picture in which a @xmath5 brane can be thought of as a vortex of the complex open string tachyon of a @xmath190 pair ; _ 2 ) _ the conjecture @xcite that in @xmath2 the bps @xmath4-strings are the @xmath0term strings formed by higgsing the @xmath11 gauge symmetry due to the presence of a constant fi term .",
    "one important result , supporting our string theory interpretation , is that finite energy bps solutions can only exist in the presence of a constant fi term in the effective action .",
    "any field dependent fi term in isolation , for example those generated in heterotic string theory compactifications , can not support smooth bps strings because these configuration would have zero energy .",
    "the difference between the two cases arises from the fact that a field dependent fi term is generated from the gauging of the shift symmetry of the axion while the constant fi term only affects the potential ( in global supersymmetry ) .",
    "we have also shown that the finiteness of energy forces the bosonic partner of the axion to vary along the radial direction .",
    "this behavior has a simple physical explanation .",
    "an infinite straight axionic string in four dimensions is analogous to an electric charge in 2 + 1 dimensions so it would naively have a logarithmically divergent energy per unit length .",
    "the only way to avoid this conclusion is if the charge is screened at large distances .",
    "this precisely achieved by the variation of the dilaton .",
    "the charge as measured from the flux goes to zero at large distances from the string so that the charge becomes completely screened .",
    "we have found two qualitatively different classes of bps string solutions which we have dubbed the @xmath75strings and the @xmath3strings depending on whether the solution is supported by the tachyon field @xmath14 or the dilaton @xmath27 .",
    "for the @xmath75strings the magnetic flux tube of the string is induced by the winding of the phase of the tachyon while for the @xmath3strings what is relevant is the axion winding .",
    "for special values of the windings the two solutions merge into each other .",
    "the coupling to supergravity was also discussed generalizing previous studies of @xcite .",
    "under very general assumptions we have shown that bps string solutions in flat space ( with any khler potential for the chiral fields ) remain supersymmetric even after the coupling to supergravity .",
    "as usual a finite energy configuration with codimension two produces an asymptotically conical space with deficit angle proportional to the tension of the object . the possibility to define killing spinors in this space relies on a remarkable cancellation between the deficit angle and the aharonov - bohm phase as first noticed in 2 + 1 dimensions in @xcite",
    "we have shown that this effect is generic .",
    "the main motivation for this work was the study of the connection between @xmath4-term strings and stringy @xmath0strings along the lines of @xcite .",
    "@xmath0strings carry rr charges so it was our goal to clarify how to couple the @xmath0term strings to the rr fields .",
    "a string couples electrically to a two - form which is dual to an axion in four dimensions . in this paper",
    "we have shown that it is indeed possible to couple the abelian higgs model strings to an axionic multiplet preserving their bps nature .",
    "the relation between @xmath0strings and gauge theory strings has interesting consequences for string cosmology and phenomenology such as the fact that brane - anti - brane energy is represented by an fi @xmath0term of the worldvolume theory .",
    "this observation relates @xmath0term inflation @xcite to @xmath0brane inflation@xcite .",
    "we hope to return to this and related issues in a future publication .",
    "also having explicit solutions could be useful for a better understanding of the reconnection probability of cosmic @xmath4-strings and differentiating between ordinary gauge theory cosmic strings and the stringy ones@xcite .    in this paper we heavily relied on supersymmetry and bps properties for two main reasons . on one hand we wished to obtain exact solutions at least in some approximation . on the other hand , supersymmetry was an useful tool for `` tagging '' the solutions in the @xmath2 theory and tracing their origin in full string theory picture . in the real world",
    ", of course , supersymmetry is broken , and this breaking is expected to affect some properties of our solutions .",
    "for example , dilaton stabilization may create a divergent tension . in this case",

    "<S> in this work we derive non - singular bps string solutions from an action that captures the essential features of a @xmath0brane - anti-@xmath0brane system compactified to four dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> the model we consider is a supersymmetric abelian higgs model with a @xmath0term potential coupled to an axion - dilaton multiplet . </S>",
    "<S> the strings in question are axionic @xmath0term strings which we identify with the @xmath0strings of type ii string theory . in this picture </S>",
    "<S> the higgs field represents the open string tachyon of the @xmath1 pair and the axion is dual to a ramond ramond form . </S>",
    "<S> the crucial term allowing the existence of non - singular bps strings is the fayet - iliopoulos term , which is related to the tensions of the @xmath0string and of the parent branes . despite the presence of the axion , </S>",
    "<S> the strings are bps and carry finite energy , due to the fact that the space gets very slowly decompactified away from the core , screening the long range axion field ( or equivalently the theory approaches an infinitely weak @xmath2 coupling ) . within our @xmath2 effective action </S>",
    "<S> we also identify another class of bps string solutions ( @xmath3strings ) which have no ten dimensional analog , and can only exist after compactification . </S>"
