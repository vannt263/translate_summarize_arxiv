    "cerium - based intermetallic compounds have received widespread attention in recent years due to the wide variety of strongly correlated electron behavior they exhibit including heavy fermion behavior , quantum criticality , unconventional superconductivity , and complex magnetic order @xcite .",
    "their ground state properties are determined by a delicate balance of competing kondo and rkky interactions @xcite , which tend to suppress or promote magnetic order , respectively .",
    "both interactions arise from the coupling of ce 4f electrons to conduction electrons . when the hybridization is sufficiently strong to produce comparable kondo and rkky interaction strengths , magnetic order is suppressed to t=0",
    "k. quantum fluctuations of the 2nd - order magnetic transition at this quantum critical point ( qcp ) give rise to unusual power law ( or logarithmic ) temperature dependencies of the electrical resisitivity ( @xmath10 with @xmath11 ) and thermodynamic ( sommerfeld coefficient @xmath12 ) properties , in contrast to the expected behavior for a fermi liquid ( @xmath13 and @xmath14 const . )",
    "unconventional superconductivity often appears near this quantum critical point and may be mediated by the magnetic fluctuations that are most abundant at the qcp @xcite .",
    "the concept of a quantum critical point provides an appealing framework with which to understand the behavior of several classes of correlated electron materials including the f - electron heavy fermion compounds , and the high-@xmath15 iron - pnictide and cuprate superconductors , but the nature of the quantum criticality and its connection to unconventional superconductivity is still fiercely debated .",
    "the f - electron / conduction electron hybridization that controls the behavior of ce - based compounds depends sensitively on the crystal chemical environment .",
    "thus , certain families of cerium materials that crystallize in a particular structure type or are made from similar atomic building blocks tend to show interesting correlated electron behavior . for instance",
    ", the chemical environment of the tetragonal cem@xmath1x@xmath1 compounds changes the hybridization to produce a variety of ground states ranging from magnetically ordered ( e.g. , cecu@xmath1ge@xmath1 ) @xcite to quantum critical ( e.g. , ceni@xmath1ge@xmath1 ) @xcite , to superconducting ( e.g. , cecu@xmath1si@xmath1 ) @xcite ; furthermore , the hybridization in a given material may be tuned with modest amounts of pressure or chemical substitution to reach the quantum critical point @xcite .",
