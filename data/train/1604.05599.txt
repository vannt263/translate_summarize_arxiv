    "the dwarf galaxies surrounding the milky way are the most extreme dark matter dominated objects known to us with central mass to light ratios typically of the order of tens to hundreds  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "additionally , little or no emission has been detected in wavebands other than the optical , and so the intrinsic astrophysical backgrounds are low .",
    "this makes the dsphs attractive targets to look for signals of dark matter annihilation products  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 ray differential flux from dark matter annihilation measured within a solid angle @xmath2 is  ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath3 the first term on the right - hand side depends on the particle physics ( i.e. dark matter particle mass , annihilation cross section , and standard model final states ) .",
    "the second term is the astrophysical factor , or j - factor , and encapsulates the distribution of dark matter within the system of interest : @xmath4 it is therefore the square of the dark matter density integrated along the line of sight and over the solid angle of the sky corresponding to the observation .    for the dsphs",
    ", the dark matter density is not known , but can be constrained from the line of sight velocities of individual stars .",
    "the spherical jeans equations are often used to relate the velocities of the stars to the underlying dark matter distribution .",
    "nowadays , this is often explored in a bayesian framework using monte carlo techniques , so that the calculation of the j - factors requires significant computational effort  @xcite .    however , it is reasonable to look for a simpler way of computing j - factors for two reasons .",
    "first , for many of the recently discovered ultrafaint dwarf galaxies , there are few stars with line of sight velocities . in some cases , such as ursa major ii",
    ", the giant branch itself is so sparse that there are very few target stars for spectroscopy  @xcite .",
    "given such fundamental limitations on the observational data , the extensive exploration of model - space in conventional jeans analyses may be needlessly elaborate .",
    "second , an entirely characteristic feature of the dsphs is that they are flattened .",
    "in fact , some of the ultrafaints are very highly flattened with ellipticities exceeding @xmath5 , such as ursa major ii  @xcite , hercules  @xcite , ursa major i  @xcite and reticulum ii  @xcite . therefore , the underlying physical model of a spherical dark halo containing a round distribution of stars satisfying the jeans equation may fail to capture important aspects of the physics .",
    "this leaves the value of computationally intensive approaches based on sphericity open to question , as they may suffer from systematic effects when applied to flattened or triaxial systems . while there have already been some investigations of axisymmetry and triaxiality  @xcite , the implications of these effects on the dark matter annihilation signal warrants a systematic study , which we provide elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "the question as to whether dsphs have cored or cusped dark matter densities has been investigated intensively over the past few years .",
    "the latest simulations have reached a resolution where the effect of individual supernovae can be modelled , making them much less sensitive to the details of the ` sub - grid ' star formation and feedback physics  @xcite .",
    "they suggest that dark matter cores of size comparable to the half - light radius of the stellar component should be present in objects like carina and fornax that have formed stars for a hubble time",
    ". however , dsphs with patchy star formation may be more cuspy , with the ultra - faints possibly retaining a pristine cusp of the form originally proposed by navarro , frenk & white ( nfw )  @xcite .",
    "this picture is broadly consistent with simple energy constraints  @xcite , as well as tidal arguments suggesting that if the ultra - faints had dark matter cores , then they would not survive for long on their current orbits  @xcite .",
    "all this suggests that , even if the larger classical dsphs are cored as implied by the current observational data on general grounds  @xcite , the smaller dsphs and the ultra - faints are probably cusped with dark matter densities behaving like @xmath6 at small radii .    here , we provide a set of simple formulae for j - factors in spherical cusped geometries .",
    "our approach is entirely elementary , but we show that it leads to formulae that are very competitive with more laborious approaches .",
    "section ii concentrates on the cosmologically motivated @xmath7 cusp exemplified by the nfw model .",
    "we provide an analytic formula for the j - factor of the nfw model , as well as new estimates for the classical and ultrafaint dwarfs , including the newly discovered horologium i , grus i , hydra ii , and pisces ii .",
    "section iii extends the work into more general cusped and cored dark haloes and explores the possibilty of inferring halo structure from j - factor profiles .",
    "in particular , we show how the behaviour of the j - factor at small and large integration angles is controlled by the halo parameters .",
    "finally , we investigate the existence of a sweet spot  namely an integration angle at which the value of the j - factor is reasonably insensitive to the unknowable aspects of the underlying dark halo profile  @xcite .",

    "here , we provide a simple calculation for the j - factor of both a spherical cusp and a navarro - frenk - white ( nfw ) halo . we show our formulae reproduce the results of more sophisticated calculations .      in spherical symmetry , dsphs follow the empirical law @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the ( projected ) half - light radius of the stars and @xmath12 is the luminosity weighted square of the velocity dispersion .",

    "( [ eq : wolf ] ) is that the mass enclosed within the half - light radius is robust against changes in anisotropy .",
    "this result was demonstrated from solutions of the spherical jeans equations  @xcite .",
    "there are known biases in this formula when applied to populations deeply embedded with dark haloes , such as the metal - rich sub - populations of dsphs  @xcite . in our application to the entirety of the stellar population of the dsph , any such bias is negligible , especially compared to the uncertainty in the velocity dispersion itself , which dominates the overall error budget .",

    "the dark matter density is @xmath19 this gives us a one - parameter family of dark matter cusps that always obey the empirical law  ( [ eq : wolf ] ) .",
    "we now make two assumptions to enable us to perform the integration in the j - factor analytically .",
    "first , we assume that the dsph is sufficiently distant that @xmath20 here , @xmath21 is the heliocentric distance , @xmath22 is the line of sight and @xmath23 is a polar coordinate in the plane of the sky .",
    "this approximation means that the projection is from infinity rather than from a finite distance .",
    "the integration volume is a cylinder rather than a cone .",
    "as even the nearest ultrafaints ( segue 1 and reticulum ii ) are @xmath24 kpc distant , this incurs little actual error .",
    "second , we assume that the j - factor is dominated by contributions from the singular cusp .",
    "we show _ a posteriori _ that this approximation is fine by comparing our formula to the results of more elaborate calculations .    the integration in eq .",
    "( [ eq : jfactor ] ) can now be done analytically @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a dimensionless number depending on the cusp slope @xmath0 @xmath27 here , @xmath28 is the gamma function , whilst we require @xmath29 for convergence .",
    "this constraint can be interpreted physically .",
    "if the density is too shallow ( @xmath30 ) , then the dark matter extends too far along the line of sight , causing the @xmath22 integral to diverge .",
    "similarly , if it is too strongly cusped ( @xmath31 ) , then the contribution from the cusp at @xmath32 also causes the @xmath22 integral to diverge .",
    "the angular integration is usually performed out to @xmath33 from the centre of the dsph , as this is typical of the resolution of fermi - lat data in the gev range . @xcite",
    "have argued that the j - factor is most robust to modelling uncertainty when the integration angle is @xmath34 , or twice the half - light radius of the stars divided by distance to the dsph .",

    "so far , we have focussed on the nfw model with its @xmath7 density cusp .",
    "although this has a preferred status because of its importance in theories of galaxy formation , there is some evidence that dark haloes may have a different structure .",

    "the behaviour at the origin encodes information on the inner cusp slope @xmath0 .",
    "if the model is cored or weakly cusped ( @xmath117 ) , then the j - factor rises quadratically from the origin , @xmath118 . if the model is more strongly cusped ( @xmath119 ) , then @xmath120 .",
    "the asymptotic value of the j - factor  which can be worked out analytically  depends on both inner slope @xmath0 , outer slope @xmath1 as well as the halo scale length and normalisation .",
    "finally , we have identified a sweet spot , or preferential integration angle , at which the j - factor is robust against changes in the dark halo model .",
    "this is at the integration angle @xmath121 , or the ratio of the dsphs half - light radius @xmath11 to distance from the observer @xmath21 .",
    "this result holds good for models that exactly obey the empirical relation between velocity dispersion and mass enclosed within half - light radius  @xcite .",
    "an important outstanding problem is the extension of this work to flattened geometries .",
    "most dsphs are flattened  and some of the most promising targets such as reticulum ii or horologium i are very highly flattened .",
    "spherical models can provide useful guides , especially for the largest classical dsphs ( like leo i or fornax ) that look nearly round on the sky .",
    "they are least useful for the flattened ultrafaints . in a companion paper , we show how to extend the techniques presented here to explore flattened and triaxial geometries  @xcite .    the authors thank the anonymous referees for helpful reports , as well as vasily belokurov and matt walker for useful discussions .",
