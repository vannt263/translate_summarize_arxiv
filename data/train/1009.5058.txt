    "there is a great deal of activity in recent years in trying to interpret the excess of hard positron events reported by the pamela experiment @xcite as a possible signal for dark matter @xcite . in the framework of the minimal supersymmetric standard models ( mssm ) ,",
    "one expects the wino to be the lightest supersymmetric particle , and hence a dark matter candidate , in the anomaly mediated supersymmetry breaking model @xcite as well as some string inspired models @xcite .",
    "more over , such a wino dark matter is known to give the right cosmological relic density for a relatively heavy wino mass of   2 tev @xcite .",
    "it is also widely recognized that such a heavy wino dark matter can naturally account for a hard positron signal from their pair - annihilation into the @xmath5- channel , followed by the leptonic decay of the w bosons @xcite .",
    "it is equally well known , however , that the model would need a very large boost factor to match the observed magnitude of the positron signal .",
    "one of the main theoretical mechanisms invoked to explain the above mentioned boost factor is the so called sommerfeld effect @xcite .",
    "it is recognized , however , that in order to get a large enhancement of dm annihilation cross - section ( boost factor ) , the dm mass has to lie very close to one of the sommerfeld resonances @xcite , in which case the sommerfeld enhancement will also have a profound effect on the dm relic density . in this work",
    ", we shall assume the wino dm mass to lie very close to the first sommerfeld resonance of about 4 tev , and see if the sommerfeld effect can simultaneously account for the right cosmological relic density as well as the large boost factor required to explain the size of the hard positron signal .",
    "recently a quantitative analysis of the sommerfeld effect in the dm relic density calculation has been made by feng et al @xcite in the context of a new physics scenario , where the effect arises from multiple exchanges of a light gauge boson in a hidden sector .",
    "we shall follow their procedure closely for incorporating the sommerfeld effect in the relic density calculation for a wino dm of the mssm , where it arises from the multiple exchanges of the standard w boson .",
    "we shall see below that for a wino mass of about 4 tev , the sommerfeld effect can indeed account for the right wmap compatible relic density @xcite as well as a large boost factor , required to explain the pamela positron excess .",
    "we shall also see that increasing the wino mass to 4 tev helps make the predicted anti - proton signal compatible with the pamela measurements @xcite of @xmath6 ratio by shifting the anti - proton peak to higher energies .",
    "the flux ratio @xmath7 measured by pamela @xcite gets a contribution from the secondary positrons generated by cosmic ray electrons and protons .",
    "the measurement of the @xmath8 flux by fermi - lat @xcite along with the measurements of heavier nuclei flux spectrum in the @xmath9 gev range by heao-3 @xcite , atic-2 @xcite and cream @xcite fix the parameters of primary cosmic ray background and the diffusion parameters in the galaxy .",
    "this leaves us essentially with the boost factor as the free parameter to adjust in comparing the theory with the pamela positron data .",
    "having fixed the boost factor , which in our case turns out to be @xmath10 , we show that the @xmath11-rays produced by the dm annihilation do not exceed the diffuse @xmath11-ray observations by fermi - lat@xcite .",
    "the work is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we summarize the wino dm model along with the procedure for incorporating the sommerfeld effect in the dm relic density calculation . then in section 3 , we present the results for the dm relic density after incorporating the sommerfeld effect along with the corresponding boost factor as functions of the dm mass",
    ". in section 4 we compare the model predictions for the hard positron and antiproton events with the experimental data .",
    "we conclude with a summary of our results in section 5 .",
    "in mssm with universal gaugino mass @xmath12 at the gut scale , the one - loop renormalized gaugino masses at weak scale are in the ratio , m_1:m_2:m_3 : : _ 1 : _ 2 : _ 3 1 : 2 : 7 and the wino is not the lsp .",
    "the wino lsp scenario is realized in the anomaly mediated supersymmetry breaking ( amsb ) model @xcite , where the gaugino and scalar masses arise from supergravity breaking in the hidden sector via super - weyl anomaly contributions .",
    "the gaugino masses are proportional to the gravitino mass @xmath13 m_1= m_3/2 , m_2=m_3/2,m_3=-3 m_3/2 and the renormalised gaugino masses at the weak scale are in the ratio , m_1:m_2 : |m_3| : : _ 1 : _ 2 : 3 _ 3 2.8 : 1:7.1 in the minimal amsb model the slepton masses come out negative at the weak scale , and this situation is ameliorated by adding a common scalar mass term @xmath14 at tree level .",
    "this model has four free parameters , @xmath15 and @xmath16 . besides the wino turns out to be the lsp in some string inspired models @xcite .",
    "both the wino annihilation and the sommerfeld enhancement processes of our interest are controlled by its isospin gauge coupling @xmath17 to @xmath0 boson .",
    "so our results are essentially independent of the underlying susy model ; and depend only on the wino lsp mass .",
    "the scattering or annihilation cross section of non - relativistic particles in the initial state can be substantially changed if there is a long - range force between the incoming particles which distorts their wave function .",
    "the corrected cross section due to the distortion of incoming states from the plane wave can be calculated from the wave function of the two - body system in the attractive potential of the exchanged light particles .",
    "taking @xmath18 as the initial particles mass and @xmath19 the exchanged boson mass and @xmath20 the coupling , the l=0 partial wave obeys the schrodinger equation + e^-m_r = -m v^2 [ schr ] with the boundary condition @xmath21 and @xmath22 at @xmath23 .",
    "the sommerfeld enhancement factor is @xmath24 .",
    "the sommerfeld factor can be calculated by solving the schrodinger equation ( [ schr ] ) numerically @xcite . in this paper",
    "we use an analytical approximation for the sommerfeld factor which can be written as @xcite , s(v , m , m_)= [ s ]    the annihilation cross section of the s - wave initial states gets enhanced at low velocities by the factor @xmath25 . for the w ladder",
    "processes taking @xmath26 and @xmath27 , the plots for @xmath25 as a function of the dm mass @xmath18 at different velocities is shown in fig  [ s - v ] .",
    "we see that the maximum enhancement takes place at @xmath28 for any given velocity .",
    "exchange as a function of the dm mass for different relative velocities.,width=453 ]    for the calculation of the boost factor relevant to pamela signal we find with dm mass @xmath29tev , the peak enhancement at rms velocities @xmath30 the sommerfeld enhancement is @xmath10 .",
    "it is possible that there are cold pockets in the galaxy where the rms velocities are lower ( @xmath31 ) , and in these cold pockets the dm annihilation can get a larger boost factor ( @xmath32 ) and they can make significant contribution to the pamela signals @xcite . in that case",
    "the boost factor of @xmath33 represents an average dm contribution from such cold clumps and the smooth halo , which is parameterized here via an effective velocity of @xmath30 .    for the calculation of relic density we use the relation ( [ s ] ) for @xmath34 to calculate the thermal average of the cross - section which is a function of the temperature @xmath35 or @xmath36 , by averaging the cross - section over all velocities at a given temperature , v = ^dv ( v ) s(v , m ) v^2 e^ -x v^2/4 this thermal averaged cross section",
    "is used in the calculation of relic abundance which we describe in the next section .",
    "the thermal averaged annihilation cross section @xmath37 determines the relic density @xmath38 through the boltzman equation + 3 h n_=- v ( n_^2-n__eq^2 ) where @xmath39 is the the number density of @xmath40 produced by the back - reaction @xmath41 at a given temperature .",
    "the boltzman equation can be written in terms of dimensionless variables @xmath42 ( where @xmath43 is the entropy density ) and @xmath44 as , = - ( y_^2(x ) - y__eq^2 ( x ) ) [ yeqn ] where ( x ) ( ) ^1/2 m m_pl ( ) v ( x ) where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the effective degrees of freedom of the energy density and entropy density respectively .",
    "the freeze - out temperature is defined as the solution of y(x_f)=(1+c ) y_eq(x_f)=(1+c ) ( 0.145 ) x_f^3/2 e^-x_f ; where the constant @xmath47 , @xmath48 for neutralinos ; and the freeze - out temperature turns out to be given by @xmath49 . below the freeze - out temperature @xmath50",

    "the observed value of cdm density from the seven year wmap data is @xmath54 ( 3@xmath55 ) @xcite ( where @xmath56 is the hubble parameter in units of @xmath57 km / s / mpc ) .    from the calculation of relic density in the wino lsp models",
    "@xcite it is known that the wmap relic density @xmath58 is attained if the wino mass is in the range @xmath59 .",
    "a wino mass of 4 tev results in an overabundance by a factor of 3 larger than the wmap limit .    in the following we calculate the relic density of wino lsp by including the sommerfeld factor in the annihilation cross section . in @xcite",
    "an approximate form of sommerfeld factor was included in the annihilation cross section and it was found that wino mass which gave the correct relic density was in the range @xmath60 .    in this paper",
    "we incorporate the sommerfeld effect following feng et al @xcite , taking into account the fact that the dm particles do not share the same temperature with radiation bath below a the kinetic decoupling temperature but in fact cool faster than radiation .",
    "the sommerfeld factor becomes very effective at temperatures below kinetic decoupling , and that solves the problem of dm overabundance at m=4 tev .",
    "for the wino dm , the annihilation channels are @xmath61 with a cross section @xcite ( v)= and the dominant co - annihilation channel @xmath62 with the cross section for the @xmath63 initial state ( v)= the chargino - neutralino mass difference is @xmath64 , so the co - annilation channel will not take place below @xmath65 or @xmath66 .",
    "* kinetic decoupling : * it has long been recognized that after the freezout the dark matter distribution at some point will not have the same temperature as the radiation bath but cool more rapidly@xcite .",
    "it has also been pointed out that in cases where the dm annihilation has strong velocity dependent cross sections as in the case of sommerfeld effect the kinetic decoupling of dm will result in rapid annihilation of dm much below the freeze - out temperature @xcite . in this section",
    "we calculate the temperature of kinetic decoupling of heavy wino dm and incorporate it in the wino relic density calculation .",
    "the @xmath67 dm will have the same temperature as the radiation bath of standard model particles till the rate of momentum transfer due to scattering _",
    "n_r v is larger than the hubble expansion rate @xmath68 .",
    "the kinetic decoupling temperature @xmath69 is defined as the temperature where @xmath70 . for @xmath71 the scattering process",
    "@xmath72 has a cross section @xmath73 and the kinetic decoupling condition gives the kinetic decoupling temperature to be t_kd^w = 2.5 ( ) ^1/2= 5.4 mev ( ) ^3/2 .",
    "but at this temperature there are no @xmath74 in the radiation bath , so the kinetic decoupling temperature for this interaction channel is @xmath75 .",
    "other processes that maintain temperature equality between the dm and the radiation bath are the elastic scattering with relativistic fermions , @xmath76 . in the absence of a higgsino component in the dm",
    "there is no @xmath77 exchange diagram , and the elastic scattering process will come from s and u - channel sfermion exchanges with the cross section @xcite , v = 12 _ 2 ^ 2 i_f^4 where @xmath78 is the isospin of @xmath79 , @xmath80 is the sfermion mass and @xmath81 is the fermion energy . the kinetic decoupling temperature of the relativistic fermion - wino scattering process will then be given by t_kd^f= 4.2 ( ) ^1/4 if we take @xmath82 and @xmath83 , then the kinetic decoupling for this channel takes place at @xmath84 while for @xmath85 .",
    "finally the quasi - elastic scattering @xmath86 will maintain the kinetic - coupling of @xmath87 with radiation down to a temperature @xmath88 , assuming a typical charged and neutral wino mass difference @xmath89 mev @xcite .",
    "below the temperature @xmath90 there will be no charginos in the heat bath so the kinetic decoupling of the winos from the heat bath will take place at @xmath91 .",
    "since this is the lowest of the kinetic decoupling temperatures from various processes discussed above , we will take @xmath92 for the calculation of wino relic abundance . in fig  [ tkd ]",
    "we show the effect of the kinetic decoupling temperature on the relic density .",
    "early de - couplings enhance the annihilation and lower the relic abundance .",
    "we take @xmath93mev as the effective kinetic decoupling temperature for calculating the relic abundance .",

    "as the velocities of nr particles in the expanding universe goes down with the scale factor as @xmath96 , dm temperature falls with the scale factor as @xmath97 while the radiation temperature goes as @xmath98 .",
    "the integration in ( eqn .",
    "[ yxse ] ) in the interval @xmath99 is performed by replacing @xmath44 in the integrand by @xmath100 , which corresponds to the temperature of the dm particles .",
    "this is because the thermal equilibrium in this region is maintained by scattering between dm particles via multiple w boson exchange ( sommerfeld ladder ) .",
    "the rapid reduction in velocities or temperatures of dm particles below the kinetic decoupling temperatures results in a large enhancement in the annihilation cross section and reduction of the relic abundance in the late universe ( @xmath101 ) . with these inputs we carry out the integration in equation ( [ yxse ] ) numerically to obtain @xmath102 .",
    "we plot @xmath102 in fig  [ yxs ] and find that @xmath102 remains constant after @xmath103 which corresponds to the temperature @xmath104 .",
    "below this temperature there is a chemical decoupling of the winos in the sense that their comoving abundance remains constant .",
    "this can be physically understood as follows . in the range @xmath105 ,",
    "the dm particles are kept in thermal equilibrium by their mutual scattering .",
    "but at @xmath106 the scattering rate falls below the hubble expansion ; so the dm particles no longer maintain a maxwell - boltzmann thermal distribution .",
    "consequently the low velocity particles with enhanced annihilation rate ( [ s ] ) are decoupled from the high velocity particles .",
    "the latter escape annihilation , leading to a constant comoving abundance of dm at @xmath106 and this process is called chemical decoupling .    .",

    "we see that two narrow bands of wino masses @xmath109tev and @xmath110tev are compatible with wmap measurements at 3@xmath55 .",
    "we choose the central values @xmath111tev ( which is the center of the higher mass band ) to compute the positron , electron , antiproton and diffuse @xmath11-ray flux to compare with the observations of pamela and fermi - lat .",

    "however the @xmath115 flux is within the expected range of what is expected of secondary @xmath115 produced from the primary cr protons from agn s and other sources .",
    "any dm annihilation or decay model must explain the large flux of positrons and the paucity of @xmath115 s in the pamela signal .",

    "<S> in a wino lsp scenario the annihilation cross section of winos gravitationally bound in galaxies can be boosted by a sommerfeld enhancement factor which arises due to the ladder of exchanged @xmath0 bosons between the initial states . </S>",
    "<S> the boost factor obtained can be in the range @xmath1 if the mass is close to the resonance value of @xmath2 tev . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we show that if one takes into account the sommerfeld enhancement in the relic abundance calculation then the correct relic density is obtained for 4 tev wino mass due to the enhanced annihilation after their kinetic decoupling . at the same time </S>",
    "<S> the sommerfeld enhancement in the @xmath3 annihilation channel is sufficient to explain the positron flux seen in pamela data without significantly exceeding the observed antiproton signal . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that @xmath4 and gamma ray signals are broadly compatible with the fermi - lat observations . in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> we show that a 4 tev wino dm can explain the positron and antiproton fluxes observed by pamela and at the same time give a thermal relic abundance of cdm consistent with wmap observations . </S>"
