    "as an atomically thin sheet of carbon atoms , graphene can be thought of as a flexible membrane .",
    "very recently , the prospect of using strain to engineer the electronic properties of graphene @xcite has opened up new opportunities and directions for graphene research .",
    "strain essentially can be considered as a perturbation to the in - plane hopping amplitude , which induces a gauge potential in the effective hamiltonian.@xcite previously , strain engineering of graphene has been theoretically applied _",
    "e.g. _  in beam collimation@xcite and the quantized valley hall effect.@xcite experimentally , controllable strain has been induced in graphene via deposition onto stretchable substrates @xcite and free suspension across trenches.@xcite    the valleys in graphene refer to the dirac cones situated at the six corners of the hexagonal brillouin zone ( bz ) , of which there are two inequivalent types labeled @xmath0 and @xmath1.@xcite the valley degree of freedom represents a spin - like quantity , and the study of manipulating and making use of valleys in technology has fittingly been termed _",
    "valleytronics_.@xcite a prerequisite for this technology is a simple and effective method for preparing valley polarized currents .",
    "a number of such _ valley filters _ have been proposed in the literature .",
    "@xcite the valley filter in ref",
    ".   operates by passing electronic current through graphene nanoconstrictions .",
    "one caveat is that the filter is sensitive to the edge profile of the graphene sample , which is difficult to control practically .",
    "the filter in ref .",
    ", on the other hand , exploits the valley - asymmetry of trigonal warping which is large for energies far away from the dirac point .",
    "large energy scales , however , enhance intervalley scattering and adversely affect the filter s efficiency .",
    "lastly , the filter described in ref .",
    "is effective in bilayer graphene only under intense irradiation by high frequency light .    in this letter",
    ", we propose an efficient and robust way to filter monolayer graphene s valleys through strain engineering .",
    "significantly , we found that almost pure valley polarized currents can be attained within experimentally relevant parameters .",
    "moreover , it operates in the low energy limit , in which intervalley scattering is negligible.@xcite",
    "we consider the five - layered graphene device shown in fig .",
    "[ device.fig ] , comprising of two cascaded components ; ( a ) a region of uniform uniaxial strain , followed by ( b ) a magnetic field configuration arising from a pair of pattered ferromagnetic ( fm ) gates . for clarity ,",
    "the two components are analyzed separately in sec .",
    "[ strain.sec ] and [ mag.sec ] , respectively .",
    "the combined structure is studied in sec .",
    "[ full.sec ] .",
    "we assume a region ( length : @xmath2 ) of uniform uniaxial strain along the armchair direction ( corresponding to the @xmath3-direction ) of monolayer graphene as shown in fig .",
    "[ device.fig](a ) . in the presence of strain",
    ", the effective hamiltonian reads @xmath4 for the @xmath0-valley , and @xmath5 for the @xmath1-valley where @xmath6.@xcite the sign difference between the induced gauge potentials @xmath7 ensures overall time - reversal ( tr ) symmetry .",
    "explicitly , we have @xmath8,@xcite where @xmath9 parametrizes the strain by its effect on the nearest neighbor hopping , @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ev ) . to study the transmission across the strained region , we start by writing down the electronic wavefunctions in the three regions .",
    "translational invariance along @xmath12 permits solutions in the @xmath0-valley of the form @xmath13 , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 . for the @xmath1-valley ,",

    "the phases @xmath18 and @xmath19 are parametrized as @xmath20 and @xmath21 , where the upper ( lower ) sign corresponds to valley @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) , and are related via the conservation of @xmath22 ; @xmath23 ( in this paper we assume @xmath24 and @xmath25 ) .",
    "the transmission coefficient @xmath26 is solved via wavefunction continuity , and determines the transmission probability @xmath27 . in fig .",
    "[ valley_dep_trans.fig ] we plot @xmath28 as a function of @xmath18 [ assuming @xmath29 mev and @xmath30 nm ] , which reveals a remarkable valley - dependence.@xcite in particular , we find that transmission of opposite valleys is well separated in @xmath18-space for low energies @xmath31",

    ", @xmath18 must satisfy @xmath36 in the @xmath0-valley and @xmath37 in the @xmath1-valley .",
    "thus , electron transmission is restricted to valley - dependent windows of @xmath38 ; & k \\\\",

    "the onset of total separation occurs at @xmath41 , as confirmed in fig .",
    "[ valley_dep_trans.fig](c ) .",
    "this separation of the two valleys in @xmath18-space forms the basis of our proposed valley filter . in the next section",
    "we design a simple structure which filters electrons in @xmath18-space .",
    "the required @xmath18-filter is hinted from our analysis above .",
    "[ valley_dep_trans.fig ] shows that each of the valleys undergo separate @xmath18-space filtering .",
    "the fact that the filtering characteristics are mirrored about @xmath42 ( equivalent to @xmath43 ) reflects the tr symmetry . for the current application",

    "i.e. _  a magnetic field . in sec .",
    "[ strain.sec ] , @xmath7 assumed a rectangular function in the region of uniaxial strain ; this can be matched by a magnetic vector potential @xmath44 due to a pair of asymmetric , magnetic @xmath45-barriers which can be formed via patterned fm gating structures ( see fig .",

    "[ valley_dep_trans.fig ] for matched values @xmath51 corresponding to a field strength of @xmath52 a strain of @xmath53 mev , for example , requires a field strength of @xmath54 t. the pass band of the filter when @xmath55 is matched to the strain is shown in fig .",
    "[ valley_dep_trans.fig ] as the blue , shaded regions .",
    "perfect valley filtering can then be expected so long as @xmath56 , _",
    "i.e. _  there is no mixing of valley currents in @xmath18-space . before proceeding",
    ", we note that the wavevector filtering property of magnetic fields is generic,@xcite and not limited to @xmath45-type barriers , which are chosen above for simplicity .",
    "wavevector filtering occurs just as effectively in graphene for uniform magnetic fields and other periodic structures.@xcite      we analyzed the combined structure in fig .",
    "[ device.fig ] , confirming our predictions for fully valley polarized currents .",
    "the conductance of the device is @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the fermi energy , @xmath59 is the valley - dependent transmission probability and @xmath60 [ @xmath61 is the width along @xmath12 ] .",
    "we define the _ valley polarization _ as @xmath63 where @xmath64 . assuming a device with matched stages and the following parameters ; @xmath65 mev , @xmath54 t , and @xmath66 nm",
    ", we obtain for the conductances @xmath67 and @xmath68 , which results in @xmath69 .",
    "these values represent experimentally relevant conditions ; magnetic field barriers of @xmath70 t may be systematically fabricated at these length scales,@xcite and strains in graphene of @xmath71 have already been achieved @xcite ( @xmath53 mev corresponds to @xmath72 strain ) .",
    "we analyze the robustness of @xmath73 for _ unmatched _ filter stages keeping the fermi level constant . in fig .",
    "[ p.fig](a ) , we plot @xmath73 for continuous values of the strain @xmath74 $ ] mev and magnetic field strength @xmath75 $ ] t , for fixed @xmath76 mev and @xmath77 nm .      as is evident",
    ", @xmath73 remains large and is robust ( @xmath78 ) for a large window of strain and magnetic field values .",
    "this is coupled with a significant conductance @xmath79 ( normalized to @xmath80 ) as shown in fig .",
    "[ p.fig](b ) .",
    "we therefore expect the proposed valley filter to be relevant for practical valleytronic applications which demand a very high and robust valley polarization _ and _ an appreciable electronic current .",
    "the polarity of the filter ( @xmath81 ) can be interchanged in one of two ways .",
    "firstly , one could reverse the direction of the magnetic field @xmath82 , which flips the effect of the @xmath18-filter . alternatively",
    ", one may reverse the strain ( @xmath83 ) , which interchanges the curves for @xmath0 and @xmath1 in fig .",
    "[ valley_dep_trans.fig ] .",
    "finally , it has been shown that strain can induce a bandgap in graphene . however",
    ", this occurs for large strains of @xmath84@xmath85 and is due to the shifting of the valleys away from the bz corners.@xcite for the small strains used here , we assume a negligible deformation of the valleys .    1 v.  m.  pereira and a.  h.  castro neto , phys .",
