    "a common assumption in the study of stellar structure and evolution is that the interior of a star can be modeled as a perfect fluid @xcite .",
    "this perfect fluid model necessarily requires the pressure in the interior of a star to be isotropic .",
    "this approach has been used extensively in the study of polytropes , including white dwarfs , and of compact objects such as neutron stars @xcite . however , theoretical advances in the last decades indicate that deviations from local isotropy in the pressure , in particular at very high densities , may play an important role in determining stellar properties @xcite .",
    "the physical situations where anisotropic pressure may be relevant are very diverse . by anisotropic pressure",
    "we mean that the radial component of the pressure , @xmath4 , differs from the angular components , @xmath5 .",
    "( that @xmath6 is a direct consequence of spherical symmetry . ) of course , spherical symmetry demands both to be strictly a function of the radial coordinate .",
    "boson stars , hypothetical self - gravitating compact objects resulting from the coupling of a complex scalar field to gravity , are systems where anisotropic pressure occurs naturally @xcite . in the interior of neutron stars",
    "pions may condense .",
    "it has been shown that due to the geometry of the @xmath7 modes , anisotropic distributions of pressure could be considered to describe a pion condensed phase configuration @xcite .",
    "the existence of solid cores and type p superfluidity may also lead to departures from isotropy within the neutron star interior @xcite .",
    "since we still do not have a detailed microscopic formulation of the possible anisotropic stresses emerging in these and other contexts , we take the general approach of finding several exact solutions representing different physical situations , modeled by _ ansatze _ for the anisotropy factor , @xmath8 .",
    "previous studies have found some exact solutions , assuming certain relations for the anisotropy factor @xcite .",
    "our goal here is two fold : first , to find new exact solutions which may better model realistic situations and explore their physical properties @xcite ; second , to investigate their stability against small radial perturbations @xcite . for this , we generalize chandrasekhar s well - known variational approach to anisotropic objects .",
    "we find that not only interesting exact solutions can be found @xcite , but that they may have a wider stability range when contrasted with their isotropic counterparts @xcite .",
    "we consider a static equilibrium distribution of matter which is spherically symmetric . in schwarzschild",
    "coordinates the metric can be written as    @xmath9    where all functions depend only on the radial coordinate @xmath10 .",
    "the most general energy - momentum tensor compatible with spherical symmetry is @xmath11 we see that isotropy is not required by spherical symmetry ; it is an added condition .",
    "the einstein field equations for this spacetime geometry and matter distribution are @xmath12 @xmath13    @xmath14    note that this is a system of 3 equations with 5 unknowns .",
    "consequently , it is necessary to specify two equations of state , such as @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "it is often useful to transform the above equations into a form where the hydrodynamical properties of the system are more evident . for systems with isotropic pressure",
    ", this formulation results in the tolman - oppenheimer - volkov ( tov ) equation . the generalized tov equation , including anisotropy , is @xmath17 with @xmath18 and @xmath19 taking @xmath20 in the above expression gives us the schwarzschild mass , @xmath0 .",
    "[ this implicitly assumes that @xmath21 for @xmath22 . ]    in order to solve the above equations we must impose appropriate boundary conditions .",
