    "@xcite estimate that a mach 57 shock is in the early stages of interacting with an ellipsoidal cloud with @xmath22 .",
    "numerical studies of shock - cloud interactions have now been performed for many decades .",
    "however , the motivation for the current work comes from our realization that , barring the work in the code development paper of @xcite , _ all _ 3d `` pure - hydrodynamic '' shock - cloud calculations ( i.e. those without additional physical processes such as cooling , magnetic fields , thermal conduction and gravity ) in the astrophysics literature are for one set of parameters only : @xmath4 and @xmath5 ( see sec .

    "a detailed resolution test is presented in an appendix . in a follow - up paper @xcite , an investigation of a shock striking a filament ( as opposed to a spherical cloud )",
    "will be presented .",
    "the idealized problem of the hydrodynamical interaction of a planar adiabatic shock with a single isolated cloud was first studied numerically in the 1970s .",
    "the evolution of the cloud can be described in terms of a characteristic cloud - crushing timescale , and is scale - free for strong shocks .",
    "the cloud is first compressed , becomes overpressured , and then re - expands , and is subject to a variety of dynamical instabilities , including kelvin - helmholtz ( kh ) , rayleigh - taylor ( rt ) and richtmyer - meshkov ( rm ) .",
    "strong vorticity is deposited at the surface of the cloud and this vorticity aids in the subsequent mixing of cloud and ambient material .",
    "detailed two - dimensional ( 2d ) axisymmetric calculations by @xcite showed that a numerical resolution of about 120 cells per cloud radius ( hereafter referred to as @xmath27 ) was required in order to properly capture the main features of the interaction .",
    "the effects of smooth cloud boundaries , radiative cooling , thermal conduction and magnetic fields have now been considered ( see * ? ? ? * for a summary of work up until 2010 ) .",
    "the interaction is milder at lower shock mach numbers ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and when the post - shock gas is subsonic with respect to the cloud a bow - wave instead of a bow - shock forms .    a dedicated study of how the adiabatic interaction of a shock with a cloud depends on @xmath0 , @xmath1 and the numerical resolution was recently presented by @xcite .",
    "using 2d axisymmetric simulations , the results from `` inviscid '' models with no explicit artificial viscosity were compared against results when a @xmath2-@xmath3 subgrid turbulence model is included .",
    "the 2d inviscid models confirmed that a resolution of approximately @xmath28 is necessary for convergence in simple adiabatic simulations .",
    "however , this requirement was found to reduce to @xmath29 when a subgrid turbulence model is included .",
    "the cloud lifetime , defined as the point when material from the core of the cloud is well mixed with the ambient material , is about @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the growth - timescale for the most disruptive , long - wavelength , kh instabilities .",
    "cloud density contrasts @xmath32 are required for the cloud to form a long tail - like feature .",
    "the first three - dimensional ( 3d ) shock - cloud calculation was presented by @xcite .",
    "the simulation was adiabatic , had @xmath4 and @xmath5 , and used a numerical resolution of @xmath33 .",
    "more rapid mixing was observed since 3d hydrodynamical instabilities are able to fragment the cloud in all directions , although this was not quantified when the cloud has a smooth boundary ( their @xmath34 ) . ] .",
    "subsequently , @xcite noted that 2d hydrodynamical simulations did not compare well against experimental results obtained with the nova laser , which showed a `` voiding '' of the shocked cloud , and break up of the vortex ring by the azimuthal bending - mode instability @xcite .",
    "crucially , a 3d simulation reproduced both of these features . other 3d work in the astrophysics literature ( summarized in table  [ tab : previous ] ) has investigated the effects of additional physics , including the cloud shape and edges , radiative cooling , thermal conduction and magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "additional 3d simulations have been used to study the behaviour of clouds accelerated by winds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "though each of these scenarios are similar in some ways to a shock - cloud interaction , the details differ in each case , and therefore we do not discuss these works further .    outside of the astrophysics literature ,",
    "the shock - cloud interaction is commonly referred to as a shock - bubble interaction ( the bubble can be lighter or denser than the surrounding medium ) .",
    "simulations carried out by the fluid dynamics community have focused on a similar region of parameter space as their experiments , which for practical reasons tend to have lower @xmath1 and @xmath0 than the work noted in table  [ tab : previous ] . in the most comprehensive 3d study to date ( performed at a resolution of @xmath35 ) , @xcite examined shock mach numbers up to 5 , and cloud density contrasts up to 4.2 .",
    "they also considered different ( fixed ) values of the ratio of specific heats , @xmath9 , for the ambient and cloud gas .",
    "the work by @xcite is also noteable for its detailed study into the development and behaviour of vorticity . in a 2d axisymmetric simulation",
    ", the vorticity can only have a @xmath36-component , and the late - time flow is dominated by large and distinct vortex rings .",
    "however , in 3d simulations , this restriction no - longer applies , and the vorticity develops components in the axial and radial directions .",
    "@xcite find that when @xmath37 , the axial and radial components of the vorticity grow to a similar magnitude as the azimuthal component - it is this growth which accounts for the differences in the late - time flow - field in 2d and 3d simulations .",
    "@xcite also find that the degree of mixing of cloud and ambient material increases as @xmath1 increases , due to the greatly increased complexity and intensity of scattered shocks and rarefaction waves , which ultimately cause the formation of the turbulent wake .",
    "finally , we note that @xcite present 3d hydrodynamical simulations of a mach 5 interaction of an r12 bubble in air ( @xmath38 ) with a resolution of @xmath39 .",
    "they find that the vorticity field becomes so complex that the primary vortex core becomes almost indistinguishable .",
    "there are two broad types of laboratory experiments : those which use a conventional shock - tube , and those which are laser - driven .",
    "the literature has recently been reviewed by @xcite .",
    "of most relevance to this work are the shock - bubble experiments of @xcite , who reported shock waves ( @xmath40 , 1.16 , 1.4 and 1.61 ) through air striking a krypton gas bubble ( @xmath41 ) , the experimental results of @xcite for @xmath42 and 3.38 shocks striking an argon bubble in nitrogen ( @xmath43 ) , an @xmath44 shock striking a bubble of r22 refrigerant gas ( @xmath45 ) , and @xmath46 and 3.0 shocks striking a sulfur - hexafluoride bubble ( @xmath47 ) , and the experiments of @xcite of a sulfur - hexafluoride bubble in air , with @xmath48 and @xmath49 . also noteable are the experiments by @xcite of an argon bubble in nitrogen struck by an @xmath50 shock , which provided the first detection of distinct secondary vortex rings .",
    "laser - driven experiments of strong shocks ( @xmath51 ) interacting with a copper , aluminium or sapphire sphere embedded in a low - density plastic or foam ( @xmath52 ) have been reported by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite for the omega laser at the laboratory of laser energetics , and by @xcite for the nova laser at the lawrence livermore national laboratory .",
    "in particular , @xcite found the first evidence of 3d bending mode instabilities in high mach number shock - cloud interactions .",
    "the experimental results also indicate much faster destruction and mixing of the cloud at late times than occurs in 2d simulations ( see figs .",

    "alternatively , this may instead just be a result of the larger scatter when @xmath10 and the small number of simulations performed in 3d .",
    "@xcite postulated that clouds may be mixed more rapidly in 3d simulations due to the non - axisymmetric instabilities which develop , but this has not been tested prior to this work .",

    "this is the third of a series of papers investigating the turbulent destruction of clouds .",
    "our first paper @xcite noted the benefits of using a sub - grid turbulence model in simulations of shock - cloud interactions and found that clouds could be destroyed more rapidly when overrun by a highly turbulent flow .",
    "the inviscid and @xmath2-@xmath3 simulations were found to be in good agreement when the cloud density contrast @xmath68 , but they became increasingly divergent as @xmath1 increased .",
    "the @xmath2-@xmath3 simulations also displayed significantly better convergence properties , such that @xmath69 grid cells per cloud radius is needed for reasonable convergence ( compared to the @xmath70 needed in inviscid simulations ) .",
    "our second paper @xcite investigated how the nature of the interaction changed with the mach number @xmath0 and density contrast @xmath1 . for @xmath71 ,",
    "the lifetime of the cloud , @xmath57 , showed little variation with @xmath0 or @xmath1 and we found that @xmath72 . due to the gentler nature of the interaction , @xmath57 increases significantly at lower mach numbers .",
    "a popular analytical formula for the mass - loss rate due to hydrodynamic ablation @xcite was shown to predict cloud lifetimes which were inconsistent with mach scaling and which had a @xmath1 dependence which was not supported by the simulation results .    in this third paper",
    "we have examined whether the conclusions in @xcite remain valid for three dimensional simulations , and whether the nature of the interaction is different in 2d axisymmetric and fully 3d simulations .",
    "this was motivated by previous reports that clouds are destroyed more rapidly in 3d due to the additional development of non - axisymmetric instabilites . however",
    ", our detailed investigation , covering mach numbers from @xmath73 and cloud density contrasts from @xmath74 , has instead revealed that the interaction proceeds very similarly in 2d and 3d .",
    "although non - azimuthal modes lead to different behaviour in the later stages of the interaction , they have very little effect on key global quantities such as the lifetime of the cloud and its acceleration .    in particular , we are not able to confirm differences in the hollowing or `` voiding '' of the cloud between 2d and 3d simulations with @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "this contrasts with the findings in @xcite , where 3d experimental data and 3d simulations display such voiding but synthetic shadowgrams based on 2d simulations do not .",
    "we note that the 2d and 3d simulations in @xcite are computed with different numerical codes and different initial conditions .",
    "our work shows that when the same code and initial conditions are used the interaction evolves almost identically .",
    "the biggest differences between our 2d and 3d simulations occur for @xmath64 and @xmath5 - the destruction is noticeably slower in 3d .",
    "it is not clear why this is so , though secondary vortices form earlier and are more prevelant in the higher resolution 2d simulations .",
    "having said this , our resolution tests indicate that increasing the resolution of the 3d simulation is likely to slow the destruction of the cloud yet further ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : mcore_restest_m10 ] ) .",
    "additional 3d simulations at higher resolution are necessary to resolve this issue .    we have also shown how the cloud acceleration ( through @xmath55 ) and mixing ( through @xmath56 ) are affected by low resolution .",
    "we find that these timescales are up to @xmath75 shorter for clouds at resolution @xmath76 ( i.e. _ very _ poorly resolved clouds ) .",
    "this is relevant to simulations of the mixing and entrainment of cold clouds in multiphase - flows : simulations which do not adequately resolve the cold clouds in the flow will underestimate @xmath55 and @xmath77 , often to a significant degree .",
    "our work has also highlighted that 3d inviscid and @xmath2-@xmath3 simulations give typically very similar results .",
    "this is somewhat surprising given that 2d calculations can show significant differences ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but must be related to the different way that vortices behave and evolve in 2d and 3d flows . unlike in 2d , we find no evidence for convergence at lower resolution when employing the @xmath2-@xmath3 model .",
    "hence , there seems to be no compelling reason to use the @xmath2-@xmath3 model in 3d calculations , but clearly it remains very useful in 2d calculations .    in future work",
    "we will examine the dependence of the interaction on the shape and orientation of the cloud , and in particular whether the nature of the interaction changes when the cloud is elongated / filamentary . by examining the destruction of spherical clouds in 3d",

    "in an actual shock - cloud interaction , the smallest instabilities have a length scale , @xmath78 , which is set by the damping of hydromagnetic waves .",
    "this is typically through particle collisions , but can also be through wave - particle interactions ( see sec .  2.2 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and is dependent on the nature of the problem . for instance , in astrophysical problems it depends on whether the cloud is ionized , neutral or molecular , and the strength of the magnetic field and thermal conductivity .",
    "the reynolds number of a flow past a cloud is @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is the average flow speed past the cloud , @xmath81 is the radius of the cloud , and @xmath82 is the kinematic viscosity . for astrophysical scenarios , re can easily exceed a value of @xmath83 @xcite .",
    "the size of the smallest eddies , @xmath84 , where the largest eddies have a length scale , @xmath85 , comparable in size to the cloud . resolving the smallest eddies in a numerical simulation can thus be very challenging .",
    "alternatively , a @xmath2-@xmath3 model can be used to explicitly model the effects of sub - grid - scale turbulent viscosity through the addition of turbulence - specific viscosity and diffusion terms to the euler equations @xcite .    without any prescription for the small - scale dissipative physics , new unstable scales",
    "will be added as the resolution of the simulation is increased .",
    "this is the case for simulations which simply solve the euler equations for inviscid fluid flow .",
    "for instance , simulations of a shock striking a cloud will produce features which depend on the resolution adopted .",
    "higher resolution simulations allow the development of smaller instabilities , and surfaces and interfaces become sharper",
    ". these differences can affect the rate at which material is stripped from the cloud and mixed into the surrounding flow , and the acceleration that the cloud experiences . increasing the resolution simply creates finer and finer structure as re increases . in the shock - cloud scenario",
    ", the different instabilities present at different resolution will break up the cloud differently , thus eventually affecting the convergence of integral quantities .",
    "thus formal convergence may be impossible in `` inviscid '' simulations .",
    "@xcite have shown that initial value problems for the euler equations involving shock - contact interactions exhibit features indicating that such problems are ill - posed , including non - convergence of the solution at a given time .",
    "simulations of problems for which there is no analytical solution typically rely on a demonstration of self - convergence .",
    "lower resolution simulations are compared against the highest resolution simulation performed , and a resolution is chosen which balances accuracy against computational cost .",
    "@xcite suggested that @xmath86 cells per cloud radius was required to adequately model the adiabatic interaction of a mach 10 shock with a @xmath5 cloud .",
    "most simulations in the astrophysics literature since then have adopted resolutions matching or exceeding this requirement , though some 3d studies have been performed at lower resolution .",
    "more recently , @xcite examined the issue of convergence for 2d calculations of the purely adiabatic interaction of a shock with a spherical cloud .",
    "they find that although the solution is locally and pointwise nonconvergent , some aspects of the computed flowfields , particularly certain integrated and mean quantities , do reach a converged grid - independent state .",
    "for instance , they show that the maximum density in the flowfield continues to vary with the spatial resolution ( even for resolutions up to @xmath87 ) , while the mean cloud density converges to a nearly grid - independent value for resolutions @xmath88",
    ".    at very low resolution , important features of the flow may not be present , and ultimately the simulated interaction will compare poorly to reality .",
    "thus , rather than attempting to obtain a converged solution , some previous work has instead focussed on resolving key features of the flow . in purely hydrodynamic shock - cloud simulations",
    "this includes the stand - off distance of the bowshock ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the thickness of the turbulent boundary layer on the cloud surface ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) ; in radiative shock - cloud simulations it is the cooling layer behind shocks @xcite , while in the mhd simulations of @xcite it is the magnetic draping layer on the upstream surface of the cloud .    to understand how the grid resolution affects our results we have run a variety of simulations at different resolutions , with and without inclusion of a @xmath2-@xmath3 sub - grid model . in the following subsections we examine the resolution dependence of the cloud morphology ,",
    "study some statistics of the interaction , determine how certain integral quantities vary with resolution , and finally study the impact of resolution on the cloud acceleration and mixing timescales , @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "we first study the resolution dependence of the cloud morphology for `` inviscid '' simulations with @xmath4 and @xmath5 , which are the most popular parameter choices in the astrophysical literature to date ( see table  [ tab : previous ] ) .",
    "we expect the bowshock to have a stand - off distance of @xmath89 @xcite .",
    "hence the bowshock will be resolved at resolutions @xmath90 , while resolving the turbulent boundary layer requires resolutions @xmath91 .",
    "[ fig : m10chi1e1_3dresplot_4.09tcc ] shows volumetric plots of the density of cloud material at @xmath92 ( this focus means that features in the ambient medium - e.g. , the bowshock - are not visible ) .",
    "as the resolution increases we see that the shape of the cloud changes , from rounded and relatively featureless at lower resolutions , to displaying a torus of high vorticity at the highest resolutions .",
    "the cloud and the vortex ring at the rear of the cloud are merged together in the @xmath93 simulation , but become increasingly separate and distinct as the resolution increases . at @xmath94",
    "numerous density structures occur within the cloud interior ( these are not readily visible in fig .  [",
    "fig : m10chi1e1_3dresplot_4.09tcc ] , but are clearly identifiable when this figure is rotated on the computer screen ) , which break up into smaller structures in the @xmath35 simulation ( these are clearly visible in the 2d slices shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : chi1e1_2dvs3d ] ) . at @xmath94",
    "the vortex ring shows azimuthal variations for the first time .",
    "in addition , the thickness of the slip surface decreases and the maximum density of cloud material increases as the resolution increases .",
    "[ fig : m10chi1e2_3dresplot_3.87tcc ] shows the resolution - dependent behaviour of simulations with @xmath4 , @xmath11 .",
    "it is interesting to see how the dominant scale of the instabilities changes with resolution . for @xmath93 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 ,",
    "the cloud has 4 dominant fingers . at @xmath94 and @xmath35",
    "smaller scale structures develop which change these fingers into a single ring - like feature .",
    "the main effect of the resolution in `` inviscid '' simulations is to set the size of the instabilities which develop : at low resolution only longer - wavelength instabilities can develop . the tail appears to display some characteristics of turbulence at @xmath94 and above .",
    "[ fig : m10chi1e3_3dresplot_0.79tcc ] shows volumetric plots of the cloud density at @xmath97 for the @xmath4 , @xmath10 simulations as a function of the resolution . as the resolution increases",
    "we again see that the thickness of the slip surface decreases and the maximum density of the shocked cloud increases .",
    "the tail of ablated material also becomes more hollow , and its shape changes . at the highest resolution",
    "studied the tail is disrupted by instabilities after about 3 cloud radii , and becomes `` turbulent '' . at this time",
    "very little material has been stripped from the cloud but there are already important qualitative and quantitative differences in the flow .",

    "the important point is that simulations with a resolution of @xmath96 appear to show that the time evolution of @xmath63 and @xmath102 are reasonably converged .",

    "high resolutions , particularly at high cloud density contrasts , are very computationally demanding when @xmath64 because of the gentler nature of the interaction and the longer run times which ensue .",

    "the only published resolution test for 3d hydrodynamic simulations that we are aware of in the astrophysics literature is shown in fig .  5 of @xcite .",
    "they plot the time evolution of a number of cloud properties , including @xmath63 and @xmath102 , for simulations with @xmath4 and @xmath5 , with 11 , 25 and 53 cells per cloud radius .",
    "they find smaller differences between the @xmath107 and @xmath108 simulations , than between the @xmath109 and @xmath107 simulations , and thus claim that their highest resolution simulation captures the dominant dynamical effects .",
    "our work is consistent with these claims .      to gain further insight into the effect of the grid resolution on our simulations we examine the variation of some integral quantities computed from the datasets .",
    "one method for examining the degree of convergence between simulations at different resolution is to study the relative error , which is defined as the fractional difference between the value measured at resolution @xmath110 and the value at the finest resolution , @xmath111 : @xmath112 if @xmath113 shows a monotonic decrease with increasing resolution , and is small , then self - convergence is occurring ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this behaviour translates into an asymptotic levelling off with increasing resolution of a particular quantity .",
    "however , there is also the danger of `` false convergence '' , whereby further increases in resolution show that the models actually have not converged ( see , e.g. , fig .",
    "10a in * ? ? ?",
    "this can happen when an important flow feature is resolved for the first time ( e.g. , the standoff of the bowshock , or the cooling zone of radiative shocks ) .",
    "furthermore , simulations which demonstrate convergence at a particular simulation time may well not be converged at a later time .",
    "this is expected for simulations of the `` inviscid '' euler equations , where rt and kh instabilities in simulations at different resolution will break up the cloud differently , thus eventually affecting the convergence of integral quantities .",
    "therefore , any statement that such simulations are `` converged '' must be qualified by a time , and by the caveat that this does not imply that convergence exists at later times .        the variation in @xmath114 , @xmath115 , @xmath101 , @xmath116 , @xmath117 and @xmath63 with the spatial resolution for the @xmath4 , @xmath5 3d inviscid and @xmath2-@xmath3 simulations is shown in fig .",

    "@xmath63 may be showing signs of convergence , but more data is needed .",
    "we conclude that our simulations are again not formally converged , but it appears that the highest resolution simulations have sufficient resolution that some of the integral quantities are showing signs of convergence at this time .    moving to later times ( @xmath119 ) , fig .",
    "[ fig : m10_chi1e3_convergence_error_2dvs3d_6tcc ] shows that none of the quantities ( except perhaps @xmath116 ) display any signs of convergence .",
    "this demonstrates that as the simulations advance in time they move from showing _ some _ convergence to showing non - convergence .",
    "thus we can be totally clear that still higher resolution is necessary in order to obtain formal convergence ( at @xmath120 , let alone at later times ) , if indeed this is even possible given the nature of the inviscid euler equations .",

    "in general , @xmath55 increases with resolution .",

    "it is also of interest to note by how much @xmath55 and @xmath56 are underestimated in lower resolution calculations . by averaging the values in fig .",
    "[ fig : tdragrestest ] we find that @xmath55 is only 40% of its maximum resolution value at @xmath76 , climbing to 83% at @xmath93 and 93% at @xmath95 , and is on average within 1% of its maximum resolution value for @xmath96 and higher resolutions .",

    "note that there is a tight correlation in the trend of @xmath56 when @xmath5 , for the 3 mach numbers investigated : at @xmath76 and @xmath93 , @xmath77 is 26% and 64% of the true value , respectively .",
