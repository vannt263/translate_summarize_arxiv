    "the detection of hot atomic hydrogen in the upper atmosphere of hd209458b @xcite has inspired numerous attempts to model physical and chemical processes in highly irradiated atmospheres , including rapid escape as one of the most challenging aspects .",
    "subsequent detection of heavy atoms and ions @xcite point out the need for more complex models that include the chemistry associated with these species as well as the collision coupling between them and the major species . indeed , close - in extrasolar planets offer a natural laboratory to constrain the theory of rapid escape , including hydrodynamic escape .",
    "this is important because aspects of the theory are controversial , and yet rapid escape is believed to have played a role in shaping the early evolution of the atmospheres in the solar system ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "escape may also be a crucial factor in determining atmospheric conditions and habitability of super - earths and earth - like planets around m dwarfs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that may be amenable to spectroscopic studies in the near future ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the basic ideas about the nature of the upper atmospheres around close - in egps were laid out almost as soon as the first planet , 51 peg b @xcite , was detected .",
    "for instance , @xcite argued that heating by the stellar euv radiation and interaction with the stellar wind leads to high temperatures of several thousand kelvins in the upper atmosphere and exosphere of close - in egps .",
    "they also suggested that the upper atmosphere is primarily composed of atoms and ions , and that hydrodynamic escape might be able to drag species heavier than h and he into the exosphere . at the same time",
    ", @xcite argued that material escaping from the atmospheres of close - in egps would form a potentially observable comet - like tail .",
    "when @xcite detected the transits of hd209458b in the stellar fuv emission lines , they also argued that the planet is followed by comet - like tail of escaping hydrogen , and that hydrodynamic escape is required to drag oxygen and carbon atoms to the thermosphere .",
    "the model of @xcite was the first attempt to model the aeronomy and escape processes in detail and most of the assumptions in that work have been adopted by subsequent investigators .",
    "it solved the vertical equations of continuity , momentum , and energy for an escaping atmosphere , including photochemistry in the ionosphere and transfer of stellar xuv radiation .",
    "based on a composition of hydrogen and helium , the results demonstrated that h@xmath3 dissociates in the thermosphere , which at high altitudes is dominated by h and h@xmath1 .",
    "the model also showed that stellar heating leads to temperatures of @xmath410,000 k in the upper atmosphere , and predicted an energy - limited mass loss rate of 4.7  @xmath5  10@xmath6 kg  s@xmath7 @xcite .",
    "@xcite argued that conditions beyond @xmath43 @xmath2 were too complex and uncertain to be modeled reliably and therefore chose an upper boundary at 3 @xmath2 , rather than at infinity , as adopted in early solar wind models .",
    "this led to a requirement for boundary conditions for the fluid equations at a finite radius .",
    "@xcite required consistency between fluid and kinetic simulations , based on the well established fact that kinetic and fluid approaches provide consistent results for the escape flux ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this led to subsonic velocities of a few km  s@xmath7 in his model  although the presence of a sonic point at a higher altitude was not ruled out .",
    "many other models for the upper atmospheres of close - in egps have been published ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these include one - dimensional , two - dimensional , and three - dimensional models that make different assumptions regarding heating efficiency , the effect of stellar tides , photochemistry , and the escape mechanism . despite significant differences in the temperature and velocity profiles , almost all of the existing models agree that close - in egps such as hd209458b are surrounded by an extended , hot thermosphere that is undergoing some form of escape .",
    "most of the models to date concentrate on the distribution of h and h@xmath1 in the upper atmosphere .",
    "@xcite developed the only model to address the presence of o and c@xmath1 in the thermosphere @xcite .",
    "this model is otherwise similar to @xcite , but it includes the photochemistry of heavy ions , atoms , molecules , and molecular ions .",
    "it also extends to higher altitudes , and includes the effect of substellar tidal forces and stellar wind , albeit in an approximate manner .",
    "@xcite developed a three - dimensional model for the thermospheres of egps at wide orbits .",
    "they pointed out that the atmospheres of close - in egps do not escape hydrodynamically unless they receive enough stellar xuv energy to dissociate molecules in the euv heating layer below the exobase .",
    "although their results are limited to the specific case of h@xmath3 , they can be generalized as follows .",
    "the most important molecules h@xmath3 ( through the formation of h@xmath8 ) , co , h@xmath3o , and ch@xmath9 act as strong infrared coolants in the thermosphere .",
    "high temperatures and rapid escape are only possible once these molecules are dissociated .",
    "@xcite showed that h@xmath3 dissociates in the thermosphere of a jupiter - type planet orbiting a sun - like star within 0.2 au .",
    "once h@xmath3 dissociates , it is reasonable to assume that other molecules dissociate too . at this point",
    "the pressure scale height is enhanced by a factor of @xmath410 when h becomes the dominant species in the thermosphere and temperatures reach 10,000 k.    it should be noted that a composition of h and h@xmath1 with high temperatures does not guarantee that the atmosphere escapes hydrodynamically .",
    "for instance , @xcite showed that hydrodynamic escape is extremely unlikely to occur on a planet such as hd17156b because of its high mass and eccentric orbit .",
    "these types of results have implications on statistical studies that characterize the escape of planetary atmospheres by relying on the so - called energy - limited escape ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these studies often include an efficiency factor in the mass loss rate that is based on the heating efficiency of the upper atmosphere ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "unless the atmosphere is escaping rapidly , the heating efficiency could be considerably larger than the fraction of energy that actually powers escape through adiabatic cooling . under diffusion - limited escape or in the jeans regime the energy - limited escape rate is just an upper limit and the true escape rate can be lower .",
    "ideally , the uncertainties in the models can be limited by detailed observations of the escaping species . at present , multiple observations are only available for hd209458b , and they reveal the presence of h , o , c@xmath1 , and si@xmath10 at high altitudes in the thermosphere @xcite .",
    "visible and infrared observations have also revealed the presence of na , h@xmath3o , ch@xmath9 , and co@xmath3 in the lower atmosphere @xcite . taken together",
    ", these observations are beginning to reveal the composition and thermal structure in the atmosphere of hd209458b .",
    "the purpose of the current paper is to characterize the density profiles of all of the detected species in the thermosphere , and to explain the presence of the heavy atoms and ions at high altitudes in the upper atmosphere .",
    "the results can be used to infer some basic properties of the atmosphere .    to this end",
    ", we introduce a one - dimensional escape model for the upper atmosphere of hd209458b that includes the photochemistry of heavy atoms and ions .",
    "as pointed out above , previous models agree broadly on the qualitative nature of the thermosphere but the temperature , density , and velocity profiles predicted by them differ significantly ( see section  [ subsc : tempvel ] ) .",
    "some authors have argued that the density of h in the thermosphere is not sufficient to explain the observed transit depths ( see * ? ? ? * for a review ) , thus lending support to alternative interpretations of the observations such as the presence of energetic neutral atoms @xcite or a comet - like tail of hydrogen shaped by radiation pressure @xcite .",
    "accurate modeling of the thermosphere is required to enable better judgment between different explanations of the observations .",
    "the differencies between previous models arise from different assumptions regarding heating rates and boundary conditions .",
    "in addition to modeling the density profiles of the detected heavy species , we have improved these aspects of the calculations in our work .",
    "for instance , the lower boundary conditions are constrained by results from a detailed photochemical model of the lower atmosphere ( lavvas et al .",
    ", _ in preparation _ ) .",
    "with regard to the upper boundary conditions , we demonstrate that for hd209458b the extrapolated ` outflow ' boundary conditions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are consistent with recent results from kinetic theory @xcite as long as the upper boundary is at a sufficiently high altitude  although uncertainties regarding the interaction of the atmosphere with the stellar wind may limit the validity of both boundary conditions .",
    "we highlight the effect of heating efficiency and stellar flux on the density and temperature profiles , and constrain the likely heating rates by using photoelectron heating efficiencies based on the results of @xcite and our own estimates ( section  [ subsc : tempvel ] ) . as a result",
    "we provide a robust qualitative description of the density profiles , and constrain the mean temperature and velocity profile in the thermosphere .",
    "a second paper by @xcite ( paper ii ) compares our results directly with the observations .",
    "we use a one - dimensional escape model for hd209458b ( @xmath11  1.32 @xmath12 , @xmath13  0.69 @xmath14 , @xmath15  0.047 au ) that is similar to the models of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "because such models are extensively discussed in the literature , we include only a brief overview of the model here , with the emphasis on how it differs from previous work .",
    "the model solves the one - dimensional equations of motion for an escaping atmosphere composed of several neutral and ionized species : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the density of species @xmath18 , @xmath19 is the vertical velocity , @xmath20 is the diffusive flux of species @xmath18 , @xmath21 is the net chemical source term for species @xmath18 , @xmath22 is a force term arising from viscous acceleration , @xmath23 is the specific internal energy of the gas , @xmath24 is the specific net radiative heating rate , @xmath25 is the coefficient of heat conduction , and @xmath26 is the viscous dissipation functional ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the total density and pressure are given by @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively , where electrons contribute to the total pressure .",
    "we assumed equal temperatures for the neutral species , ions and electrons , and calculated the electron density at each altitude from the requirement of charge neutrality .",
    "the model solves separate continuity equations for each species , but treats the atmosphere otherwise as a single fluid .",
    "the differences in the velocities of the individual species are taken into account by including the diffusive flux @xmath20 .",
    "we calculated the fluxes by solving simultaneous equations for multiple species based on the diffusion equation given by @xcite ( equation 18.2,6 , p.344 ) .",
    "we also included a force term due to the ambipolar electric field given by @xmath29 , where the subscript @xmath30 refers to electrons , that can be important in highly ionized flows .",
    "the collision terms account for neutral - neutral , resonant and non - resonant ion - neutral , and coulomb collisions .",
    "this method is in principle similar to those of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we verify that the single temperature and diffusion approximations are valid for hd209458b based on our results in section  [ subsc : ionescape ] .",
    "the model includes heat conduction and terms due to viscosity in both the momentum and energy equations .",
    "thus the equations are consistent with the level of approximation in the navier - stokes ( ns ) equations .",
    "the ns equations themselves are a simplification of the 13-moment solution to the boltzmann equation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that is valid when the knudsen number @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the mean free path and @xmath33 is the typical length scale for significant changes in density or temperature . broadly speaking ,",
    "the equations are valid below the exobase , and terms due to heat conduction and viscosity gain significance as @xmath34  1 .",
    "we note that the exobase on hd209458b is typically located at a very high altitude ( see section  [ subsc : tempvel ] ) , and viscosity and heat conduction are not particularly important .",
    "we included species such as h , h@xmath1 , he , he@xmath1 , c , c@xmath1 , o , o@xmath1 , n , n@xmath1 , si , si@xmath1 , si@xmath10 , and electrons in the hydrodynamic model .",
    "we also generated simulations that included mg , mg@xmath35 , na , na@xmath35 , k , k@xmath1 , s , and s@xmath1 , but the presence of these species did not affect the density profiles of h , o , c@xmath1 , or si@xmath10 significantly .",
    "the model includes photoionization , thermal ionization , and charge exchange between atoms and ions .",
    "the reaction rate coefficients for these processes are listed in table  [ table : reactions ] .",
    "multiply charged ions were included only if the ionization potential of their parent ion was sufficiently low compared to the thermal energy and radiation field in the upper atmosphere .",
    "we note that our model also includes impact ionization by thermal electrons . in general",
    ", this can be important for species with low ionization potential such as alkali metals ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although we find photoionization to be more significant in the thermosphere ( see section  [ subsc : denprofs ] ) .    in order to simulate photochemistry in a numerically robust fashion",
    ", we coupled the dynamical model with the asad chemistry integrator developed at the university of cambridge @xcite . in most cases we used the impact integration scheme that is provided by asad .",
    "we did not include any molecules in the present simulations , and thus placed the lower boundary of the hydrodynamic model at @xmath36  1 @xmath0bar ( see section  [ subsc : photochemistry ] ) .",
    "molecular chemistry is not significant in the thermosphere , where our results agree qualitatively with @xcite despite simpler chemistry ( see section  [ subsc : denprofs ] ) .",
    "this is an important result because it implies that complex molecular photochemistry does not need to be included in the models for the thermosphere .",
    "however , the chemistry of molecular ions may be important on hd209458b below the 0.1 @xmath0bar level and it needs to be studied in greater detail .",
    "the upper atmosphere is heated by stellar xuv radiation .",
    "we simulated heating and photoionization self - consistently by using the model density profiles and the uv spectrum of the average sun .",
    "the spectrum covers wavelengths between 0.13000   .",
    "the xuv spectrum between 0.11050    was generated by the solar2000 model @xcite .",
    "it includes strong emission lines separately and weaker lines binned by 50   .",
    "the lyman  @xmath37 line was included with a wavelength spacing of 0.5    from @xcite and the rest of the spectrum was taken from @xcite .",
    "we assumed that most of the lyman @xmath37 radiation absorbed by h is resonantly scattered and does not contribute significantly to the heating of the atmosphere .",
    "this is because the lifetime of the 2p state of h is only 1.6 ns , compared with the typical collision timescale of @xmath41 s near the temperature peak in the thermosphere of hd209458b .    references for photoabsorption cross sections of the different species are included in table  [ table : reactions ] . in general",
    ", we divided the incident stellar flux by a factor of 4 to account for uniform redistribution of energy around the planet .",
    "this is expected to be approximately valid in the lower thermosphere based on the three - dimensional simulations of @xcite . in the extended upper thermosphere ,",
    "on the other hand , radiation passes through to the night side and leaves only a small region free of direct heating ( e.g. , see figure 2 of * ? ? ?",
    "the current model also includes heating due to photoabsorption by c , o , n , and metals .",
    "this is relatively insignificant  although it leads to some additional heating in the lower thermosphere by fuv radiation .",
    "heating of the thermosphere is mostly driven by photoionization and the generation of photoelectrons , although direct excitation of atoms and molecules may also play a role .",
    "photoelectrons excite , ionize , and dissociate atoms and molecules until they lose enough energy and become thermalized i.e. , share their energy with thermal electrons in coulomb collisions .",
    "thermal electrons share their energy with ions and eventually , the neutral atmosphere . in highly ionized atmospheres such as on hd209458b",
    "the photoelectron heating efficiency can be close to 100  % @xcite , depending on the energy of the photoelectrons .",
    "we used scaled heating efficiencies that depend on photoelectron energy to estimate the net heating efficiency in the atmosphere ( section  [ subsc : tempvel ] ) .",
    "generally , we refer to two different definitions of heating efficiency in section  [ subsc : tempvel ] in order to highlight the effect of heating efficiency on the temperature and velocity profiles .",
    "the net heating efficiency @xmath38 is defined simply as the fraction of the absorbed stellar energy that heats the atmosphere .",
    "photoelectron heating efficiency , on the other hand , applies to photoelectrons with energy @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the ionization potential of species @xmath18 and @xmath41 is the energy of the ionizing photon .",
    "the photoelectron heating efficiency is the fraction of @xmath42 that heats the thermosphere , and it is generally higher than @xmath38 because it does not account for recombination . the net heating efficiency is often used to calculate mass loss rates for extrasolar planets ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ". therefore it is important not to confuse these two definitions of heating efficiency .",
    "we included radiative cooling by recombination under the assumption that the thermosphere is optically thin to the emitted photons .",
    "this implies that the ionization potential energy @xmath40 never contributes to heating at any levels .",
    "we also considered the influence of lyman  @xmath37 cooling by excited h , although this cooling rate is uncertain and likely to be low for hd209458b .",
    "we discuss the effect of different cooling rates further in section  [ subsc : tempvel ] .",
    "as stated above , we placed the lower boundary of the hydrodynamic model at @xmath43  1 @xmath0bar and did not include h@xmath3 or other molecules in the model .",
    "this decision was motivated by photochemical calculations for hd209458b ( lavvas et al .",
    ", _ in preparation _ ) that we used to constrain the lower boundary condition .",
    "the photochemical model was originally developed for the atmosphere of titan @xcite but it was recently expanded to simulate egp atmospheres .",
    "it calculates the chemical composition from the deep troposphere ( 1000 bar ) up to the thermosphere above the 0.1 nbar level by solving the coupled continuity equations for all species based on a database of @xmath41,500 reaction rate coefficients and 103 photolysis processes .",
    "forward and reverse rates are included for each reaction with the ratio of the rate coefficients defined by thermochemical data .",
    "thus , the results are consistent with thermochemical equilibrium at deep atmospheric levels but differences develop at higher altitudes due to photolysis , diffusion , and eddy mixing . at the lower boundary the chemical abundances of the main species ( h , c , n , and o )",
    "are set to their thermodynamic equilibrium values and , depending on the vertical temperature profile and their abundances , species are allowed to condense .",
    "figure  [ fig : photochemistry ] shows the mixing ratios of h@xmath3 , h , h@xmath3o , o , ch@xmath9 , co , co@xmath3 , and c as a function of altitude from the photochemical model . in general ,",
    "the results are similar to those of @xcite .",
    "the h@xmath3/h transition is located near 1 @xmath0bar . at lower pressures ,",
    "the mixing ratio of h@xmath3 decreases rapidly with altitude and falls below 0.1 above the 0.1  @xmath0bar level . in agreement with @xcite ,",
    "the dissociation of h@xmath3 is caused by dissociation of h@xmath3o , which leads to the production of oh radicals that attack the h@xmath3 molecules . we note that the exact location of the h@xmath3/h transition depends on the temperature profile and , depending on the thermal structure , it could occur even below the 1 @xmath0bar level .",
    "the major oxygen - bearing molecules , co and h@xmath3o , have roughly equal abundances from 10 to 10@xmath44 bar .",
    "this is in line with thermochemical equilibrium at the temperatures and pressures relevant to hd209458b @xcite . h@xmath3o and co are effectively dissociated at pressures lower than 0.3 and 0.1 @xmath0bar , respectively .",
    "we note that molecular abundances could be significant at 0.11 @xmath0bar , and technically the results of the hydrodynamic calculations are only valid above the 0.1 @xmath0bar level .",
    "the presence of molecules such as h@xmath3 , h@xmath3o , and co can lead to enhanced uv heating as well as efficient radiative cooling by h@xmath8 , h@xmath3o and co in the 0.11 @xmath0bar region .",
    "the photochemical model also includes the chemistry of silicon . due to condensation into forsterite and enstatite ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the abundance of si in the observable atmospheres of giant planets was thought to be negligible and thus the photochemistry of silicon in planetary atmospheres has not been studied before .",
    "the photochemical calculations indicate that , in agreement with thermochemical calculations @xcite , sio is the dominant silicon - bearing gas .",
    "sio dissociates in the thermosphere at a similar pressure level as h@xmath3o and co. we note that the detection of si@xmath10 in the thermosphere implies that silicon does not condense in the atmosphere of hd209458b ( paper ii ) .",
    "in addition to composition , lower boundary conditions are required for temperature and velocity .",
    "we specified @xmath45 and @xmath46 at the lower boundary , and used them to calculate @xmath47 from the ideal gas law .",
    "the steady state continuity equation @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the flux constant , was used to calculate the velocity @xmath50 at the lower boundary during each time step .",
    "the flux constant is solved self - consistently by the model , and it depends largely on the terms in the energy equation . in general",
    "we assumed that @xmath51  1,300 k , which is close to the effective temperature of the planet .",
    "we note that this temperature is largely unconstrained .",
    "radiative transfer models for close - in egps ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) do not account for heating by stellar uv radiation or possible opacity sources created by photochemistry ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "therefore these models may not accurately predict the temperature at the base of the thermosphere .",
    "@xcite used observations of the na d line profile to constrain the temperature profile in the upper atmosphere .",
    "they suggested that na condenses into clouds near the 3 mbar level , and thus predicted a deep minimum in temperature in this region that is required for condensation .",
    "the detection of si@xmath10 implies that condensation of na in the lower atmosphere is unlikely ( paper ii ) , and thus this result is unreliable .",
    "relying on the same observations , @xcite predicted that the temperature increases steeply from 1,300 k to 3,500 k near the 1 @xmath0bar level .",
    "however , their method to retrieve the temperature relies on the density scale height of na to express the optical depth along the line of sight ( los ) .",
    "this is not consistent with the argument that na is depleted above the 3 mbar level .",
    "if such a depletion takes place , the density scale height of na is not the same as the scale height of the atmosphere and it can not be used to retrieve temperatures .",
    "previous models of the thermosphere disagree on the details of the density and temperature profiles ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this is partly due to different boundary conditions , although assumptions regarding the heating rates and composition are probably more important ( see section  [ subsc : tempvel ] ) .",
    "unfortunately , the planetary wind equations can have an infinite number of both subsonic and supersonic solutions . in time - dependent models ,",
    "the upper boundary conditions in particular can determine if the solution is subsonic or supersonic , and they can alter the temperature and velocity profiles ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the choice of proper boundary conditions is therefore important .",
    "@xcite studied the escape of neutral atmospheres under different circumstances by using the kinetic monte carlo ( dsmc ) method .",
    "because the fluid equations are a simplification of the kinetic equations at low values of @xmath52 , the hydrodynamic model should ideally be consistent with the dsmc results both above and below the exobase .",
    "@xcite found that the nature of the solutions depends on the thermal escape parameter @xmath53 and the knudsen number @xmath54 at the lower boundary @xmath55 of a region where diabatic heating is negligible .",
    "they argued that hydrodynamic escape is possible when @xmath56  23 ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . when @xmath57  3 , on the other hand , the sonic point is at such a high altitude that the solution is practically subsonic and with @xmath57  6 the escape rate is similar to the thermal jeans escape rate .",
    "the results of the dsmc calculations can be incorporated into hydrodynamic models with appropriate upper boundary conditions .",
    "@xcite suggest that the modified jeans escape rate , which is based on the drifting maxwellian velocity distribution function , is a good approximation of the dsmc results in fluid models , consistent with @xcite . in order to contrast the modified jeans upper boundary conditions ( hereafter , the modified jeans conditions ) with other possibilities ,",
    "we used them and the extrapolated upper boundary conditions ( hereafter , the ` outflow ' conditions ) adopted by @xcite and @xcite in our simulations . in general",
    ", we placed the upper boundary at 16 r@xmath58 .",
    "the impact of the boundary conditions is discussed in section  [ subsc : boundaries ] .",
    "we formulated the outflow conditions simply by extrapolating values for density , temperature and velocity with a constant slope from below .",
    "for the modified jeans conditions , we calculated the effusion velocity @xmath59 at the upper boundary separately for each species by using equation ( 9 ) from @xcite . using this equation violates the conservation of electric charge at the upper boundary because the small mass of the electrons causes their velocity to be much larger than the velocity of the protons . in reality charge separation",
    "is prevented by the generation of an ambipolar electric field that ensures that the vertical current is zero at the upper boundary .",
    "this electric field causes the ions to escape faster while it slows the electrons down .",
    "effectively this lowers the escape velocity ( @xmath60 ) of the ions and increases the escape velocity of the electrons .    in order to incorporate the ambipolar electric field in the modified jeans conditions we expressed the jeans parameters for ions and electrons as : @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the ambipolar electric potential",
    ", @xmath63 is the electric charge and subscripts @xmath64 and @xmath30 stand for electrons and ions , respectively .",
    "we used these jeans parameters to calculate the effusion velocities for the electrons and ions , and then solved iteratively for @xmath62 by using the condition of zero current i.e. , @xmath65 .",
    "this approach is consistent with kinetic models for the solar and polar winds @xcite .",
    "having obtained the correct effusion velocities for the charged and neutral species , we evaluated the mass weighted outflow velocity from : @xmath66 and used this velocity as an upper boundary condition .",
    "the values of temperature and density that are required for this calculation were extrapolated from below .",
    "as the model approaches steady state , the solution approaches a value of @xmath19 at the upper boundary that is consistent with the modified jeans velocity .",
    "we solved the equations of motion on a grid of 400550 levels with increasing altitude spacing .",
    "the radius @xmath67 from the center of the planet at level @xmath68 is thus given by a geometric series ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : @xmath69 where @xmath70  1.08 r@xmath58 , @xmath71  10 km , and @xmath72  1.014 .",
    "we solved the equations of motions in two parts , separating advection ( eulerian terms ) from the other ( lagrangian ) terms .",
    "the lagrangian solution is performed first , and all variables are updated before advection .",
    "we used the flux conservative van leer scheme ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) for advection , and the semi - implicit crank - nicholson scheme ( e.g , * ? ? ? * ) to solve for viscosity and conduction in the momentum and energy equations , respectively .",
    "we employed a time step of 1 s in all of our calculations . despite the sophisticated numerical apparatus ,",
    "the model is still occasionally unstable , particularly in the early stages of new simulations .",
    "the primary source of the instabilities are pressure fluctuations ( sound waves ) that are not balanced by gravity .",
    "we used a two - step shapiro filter @xcite periodically to remove numerical instabilities .",
    "we assumed that a steady state has been reached once the flux constant @xmath49 is constant with altitude and the flux of energy is approximately conserved .",
    "in this section we constrain the range of mean temperatures and velocities based on stellar heating in the thermosphere of hd209458b and similar close - in egps .",

    "although not discussed by @xcite , the restricted energy range is likely an attempt to account for the fact that the absorption cross section decreases with energy implying that photons of sufficiently high energy will be absorbed too deep in the atmosphere to affect escape or the thermal structure , or composition of the thermosphere .",
    "whether this is true , however , depends on the composition and temperature of the atmosphere .",
    "the gray assumption also fails to include the fact that the net heating efficiency increases with higher photon energy .",
    "these difficulties highlight the basic problem with a gray model , that the results can only be accepted with confidence if verified by a more sophisticated calculation or direct observations .",
    "hydrodynamic models should be consistent with kinetic theory of rarefied media even if the modeled region is below the exobase .",
    "this is because the atmosphere is escaping to space , and the density decreases with altitude , falling below the fluid regime at some altitude above the exobase .",
    "therefore the conditions in the exosphere affect the flow solutions even below the exobase .",
    "inappropriate use of the hydrodynamic equations can lead one to overestimate the flow velocity and mass loss rate , and these errors also affect the temperature and density profiles . thus it is important to demonstrate that the hydrodynamic solutions agree with constraints from kinetic theory ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as an example , we calculated @xmath54 and @xmath111 ( see section  [ subsc : upbound ] ) based on the c1 and c2 models .",
    "the knudsen number @xmath52 depends on the mean collision frequency , and it is much smaller than unity at all altitudes below 16 @xmath2 .",
    "thus the exobase is located above the model domain ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "calculating values for @xmath111 is complicated by the broad stellar heating profile .",
    "we consider the region where stellar heating is negligible to be where the flux of energy @xmath135 is approximately constant .",
    "this criteria is consistent with the equations of motion , and it means that @xmath55 that should be used to calculate @xmath111 is above the upper boundary of our model because significant stellar heating persists at all altitudes .",
    "thus we evaluated values of @xmath136 near the upper boundary for guidance .",
    "we also calculated the values with both the mass of the proton ( @xmath137 ) and the mean atomic weight ( @xmath136 ) .",
    "in the c1 model , @xmath137 decreases with altitude , and above 11.4 @xmath2 it has values of less than 3 .",
    "the mean atomic weight near the upper boundary is @xmath40.6 amu , and thus the general value of @xmath138  2 above 11.1 @xmath2 .",
    "the sonic point in the c1 model is below 11 @xmath2 , and it is in a region where stellar heating is significant . in the c2 model ,",
    "both @xmath136 and @xmath139 are greater than 3 at all altitudes below 16 @xmath2 .",
    "in fact , @xmath136 increases with altitude above 9 @xmath2 because the temperature gradient parameter exceeds unity .",
    "thus the values @xmath136 in the c1 and c2 models are consistent with the difference in altitude between the sonic points in these models ( see section  [ subsc : sonicpoint ] ) .",
    "indeed , our results show , in line with parker s original ideas about the solar wind , that supersonic escape is possible if there is significant heating of the atmosphere over large distances above the temperature peak .",
    "such heating flattens the temperature gradient and brings the sonic point closer to the planet .",
    "we note that there are some caveats to applying the simple criteria based on @xmath54 and @xmath111 to close - in extrasolar planets .",
    "the upper atmospheres of these planets are strongly ionized , and the dsmc simulations of @xcite apply only to neutral atmospheres . partly due to ionization , the collision frequencies in the thermospheres of close - in planets are also high .",
    "further , the atmospheres are affected by a broad stellar heating profile in altitude whereas the dsmc calculations do not include any diabatic heating .",
    "however , the results of @xcite also indicate that consistency with kinetic theory can be enforced approximately by applying the modified jeans conditions to the hydrodynamic model at some altitude close to the exobase .",
    "this result is likely to be more general , and it applies to ionized atmospheres as long as ambipolar diffusion is taken into account ( see section  [ subsc : upbound ] ) .",
    "we compared the temperature and velocity profiles from the c1 and c2 models with results from similar models c5 and c6 that use the modified jeans conditions . note again that our version of the modified jeans conditions includes the polarization electrostatic field that is required in strongly ionized media .",
    "figure  [ fig : modjeans ] shows the temperature and velocity profiles from the models .",
    "there is no difference between the c5 model and the c1 model as long as the upper boundary of the c5 model is at a sufficiently high altitude . in this case",
    "we extended it to 36 @xmath2 .",
    "when the upper boundary is placed at lower altitudes , the flow decelerates and the temperature increases near the upper boundary .",
    "a comparison between the c2 and c6 models provides an example of the difference that can arise when the modified jeans boundary conditions are used significantly below the exobase .",
    "a better agreement is achieved if the upper boundary of the c6 model is placed at a slightly higher altitude . in summary , we have shown that the c1 and c2 models are both consistent with kinetic theory .     for the input parameters).,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=70.0% ]   for the input parameters).,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=70.0% ]    we note that extending the models to 16 @xmath2 or higher is not necessarily justified because it ignores the complications arising from the possible influence of the stellar tide , the stellar wind , and interactions of the flow with the magnetic field of the planet or the star .",
    "we placed the upper boundary at a relatively high altitude to make sure that the boundary is well above the region of interest , but generally we do not consider our results to be accurate above 35 @xmath2 . instead",
    ", our results provide robust lower boundary conditions for multidimensional models of the escaping material outside the roche lobe of the planet .",
    "such models often can not include detailed photochemical or thermal structure calculations .",
    "the results from the more complex models can then be used to constrain the upper boundary conditions in 1d models .",
    "this type of an iteration is a complex undertaking , and it will be pursued in future work .      in this section",
    "we provide a qualitative understanding of the density profiles and transition altitudes that affect the interpretation of the observations .",
    "based on the gas giants in the solar system it might be expected that heavy species undergo diffusive separation in the thermosphere .",
    "if this were the case , the transit depths in the o i , c ii , and si iii lines @xcite should not be significantly higher than the transit depth at visible wavelengths .",
    "it is therefore important to explain why diffusive separation does not take place in the thermosphere of hd209458b , and to clarify why h and o remain mostly neutral while c and si are mostly ionized .",
    "also , doubly ionized species such as si@xmath10 are not common in planetary ionospheres , and their presence needs to be explained . in order to do this",
    ", we modeled the ionization and photochemistry of the relevant species , and prove that diffusive separation does not take place .    in order to illustrate the results ,",
    "figure  [ fig : denprofs ] shows the density profiles of h , h@xmath1 , he , he@xmath1 , o , o@xmath1 , c , c@xmath1 , si , si@xmath1 , and si@xmath10 from the c2 model . the location of the h / h@xmath1 transition obviously depends on photochemistry , but it also depends on the dynamics of escape . with a fixed pressure at the lower boundary",
    ", a faster velocity leads to a transition at a higher altitude .",
    "thus the transition occurs near 3.1 @xmath2 in the c2 model whereas in the c1 and c3 models it occurs at 3.8 @xmath2 and 5 @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "these results disagree with @xcite and @xcite who predicted a lower transition altitude , but they agree qualitatively with the solar composition model of @xcite",

    "we only included h , h@xmath1 , and electrons in the model , and used the recombination rate coefficient and lyman  @xmath37 cooling rate from @xcite .",
    "we also calculated the heating and ionization rates with the gray approximation by assuming a single photon energy of 20 ev for the stellar flux of 0.45 w m@xmath131 at the orbital position of hd209458b .",
    "figure  [ fig : mc09 ] shows the density profiles of h and h@xmath1 based on this model ( hereafter , the mc09 model ) .",
    "the h / h@xmath1 transition in the mc09 model occurs near 1.4 @xmath2 .",
    "if we replace the gray approximation with the full solar spectrum in this model , the h / h@xmath1 transition moves higher to 23 @xmath2 .",
    "this is because photons with different energies penetrate to different depths in the atmosphere , extending the heating profile in altitude around the heating peak .",
    "this is why the temperature at the 30 nbar level in the c2 model is 3,800 k and not 1,000 k. in order to test the effect of higher temperatures in the lower thermosphere , we extended the mc09 model to @xmath36  1 @xmath0bar ( with @xmath114  1,300 k ) and again used the full solar spectrum for heating and ionization . with these conditions , the h",
    "/ h@xmath1 transition moves up to 3.4 @xmath2 , in agreement with the c2 model .",
    "we conclude that the unrealistic boundary conditions and the gray approximation adopted by @xcite and @xcite lead to an underestimated overall density of h and an overestimated ion fraction . thus their density profiles yield a h lyman @xmath37 transit depth of the order of 23 % i.e. , not significantly higher than the visible transit depth .",
    "we note that @xcite also predicted a relatively low altitude of 1.7 @xmath2 for the h / h@xmath1 transition  despite the fact that his model does not rely on the gray approximation and the lower boundary is in the deep atmosphere .",
    "the reason for the low altitude of the h / h@xmath1 transition in this case is the neglect of heavy elements . in the absence of heavy elements , h@xmath8 forms near the base of the model and subsequent infrared cooling balances the euv heating rates",
    "this prevents the dissociation of h@xmath3 below the 10 nbar level . in reality , reactions with oh and thermal decomposition dissociate h@xmath3 near the 1 @xmath0bar level ( see section  [ subsc : photochemistry ] ) and cooling by h@xmath140 is negligible at all altitudes .",
    "it should be noted that even if h@xmath3 does not initially dissociate , h@xmath8 can be removed from the lower thermosphere in reactions with carbon and oxygen species ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) unless these species undergo diffusive separation .",
    "the subsequent lack of radiative cooling will then dissociate h@xmath3 again near the 1 @xmath0bar level .",
    "based on the mc09 model that is similar to that of @xcite ( see text ) .",
    "compared with our models ( see figure  [ fig : denprofs ] ) , the h / h@xmath1 transition occurs at a significantly lower altitude .",
    "the difference arises from the lower boundary conditions and gray approximation to heating and ionization in the mc09 model.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    in our models , charge exchange with oxygen ( reactions r14 and r15 in table  [ table : reactions ] ) dominates the photochemistry of h below 3 @xmath2 and charge exchange with silicon ( r25 , r26 ) is also important below 1.4 @xmath2 .",
    "these reactions are secondary in a sense that they require the ions to be produced by some other mechanism .",
    "in fact , h@xmath1 is mainly produced by photoionization ( p1 ) , although thermal ionization ( r3 ) is also important near the temperature peak .",
    "the production rates are mainly balanced by loss to radiative recombination ( r1 ) .",
    "the net chemical loss timescale for h is longer than the timescale for advection above 1.7 @xmath2 .",
    "this allows advection from below to replenish h at higher altitudes .",
    "the density profiles of o and o@xmath1 are strongly coupled to h and h@xmath1 by charge exchange ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "as a result , the o / o@xmath1 transition occurs generally near the h / h@xmath1 transition . for instance , in the c2 model it is located near 3.4 @xmath2 .",
    "the same is not true of carbon .",
    "the c / c@xmath1 transition occurs at a much lower altitude than the h / h@xmath1 and o / o@xmath1 transitions .",
    "for instance , in the c2 model it is located near 1.2 @xmath2 .",
    "c@xmath1 is mainly produced by photoionization ( p4 ) , although thermal ionization ( r8 ) and charge exchange with he@xmath1 ( r13 ) are also important near the temperature peak .",
    "the production is balanced by loss to radiative recombination ( r10 ) .",
    "the chemical loss timescale for c is shorter than the timescale for advection below 1.8 @xmath2 .",
    "thus advection is unable to move the c / c@xmath1 transition to altitudes higher than 1.2 @xmath2 .",
    "silicon is almost fully ionized near the lower boundary of the model .",
    "much of the si@xmath35 below 4 @xmath2 is produced by charge exchange of si with h@xmath1 , he@xmath1 , and c@xmath1 ( r22 , r23 , r24 ) .",
    "the low ionization potential of si ( 8.2 ev ) means that si@xmath1 can also be produced by thermal ionization ( r18 ) , and photoionization ( p6 ) by stellar fuv radiation and x - rays that propagate past the euv heating peak . above 4 @xmath2 ,",
    "si@xmath1 is mostly produced by photoionization .",
    "@xcite suggested that the balance of si@xmath1 and si@xmath10 depends on charge exchange with h@xmath1 and h , respectively , and our results confirm this .",
    "however , the location of the si@xmath1/si@xmath10 transition also depends on the dynamics .",
    "for instance , in the c2 model it occurs near 5.8 @xmath2 while in the c1 model it occurs near 8.5 @xmath2 .",
    "thus slow outflow and high temperatures favor si@xmath10 as the dominant silicon species as long as the flux constant is high enough to overcome diffusive separation ( paper ii ) .",
    "we have now explained the presence of the atoms and ions that have been detected in the thermosphere of hd209458b . due to advection and charge exchange , h and o are predominantly neutral up to about 3 @xmath2 and give rise to the observed transit depths in the h lyman @xmath37 and o i lines .",
    "carbon , on the other hand , is ionized at a low altitude and thus c@xmath1 is also detectable in the upper atmosphere .",
    "si@xmath1 is the dominant silicon species below 5 @xmath2 , but charge exchange with h ensures that there is also a significant abundance of si@xmath10 in the atmosphere .",
    "we note that these conclusions are only valid if the heavier species are carried along to high altitudes by the escaping hydrogen .",
    "we show that this is the case below in section  [ subsc : ionescape ] .",
    "@xcite explored the properties of the ionospheres of egps at different orbital distances from a sun - like host star by using a hydrostatic general circulation model ( gcm ) that also includes realistic heating rates , photochemistry , and transport of constituents .",
    "they predicted that the eip layer on hd209458b is centered at 1.35 r@xmath58 where the electron density is @xmath141  6.4  @xmath5  10@xmath142 m@xmath130 and @xmath143  3  @xmath5  10@xmath131 . in the c2 model , the eip layer is centered at 1.3 r@xmath58 ( @xmath99  2 nbar ) where @xmath141  4.4  @xmath5  10@xmath142 m@xmath130 and @xmath78  3.7  @xmath5  10@xmath131 .",
    "the vertical outflow velocity at 1.3 r@xmath58 is 90 m  s@xmath7 .",
    "thus the results of @xcite were not significantly affected by the simplifying assumptions of the gcm .",
    "this means that hydrostatic gcms can be extended to relatively low pressures as long as the escape rates are incorporated as boundary conditions .",
    "we also calculated the plasma frequency based on the electron densities in the c2 model .",
    "this constrains the propagation of possible radio emissions from the ionosphere .",
    "the ordinary plasma frequency @xmath144 exceeds 12 mhz at all altitudes below 5 r@xmath58 and reaches a maximum of almost 64 mhz in the eip layer .",
    "this presents a limitation on the detection of radio emissions from the ionospheres of close - in egps .",
    "any emissions that originate from the ionosphere at 15 r@xmath58 and have frequencies lower than 1070 mhz can be screened out by the ionosphere itself .",
    "we note that a detection of radio emissions from an egp has not yet been achieved ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "such a detection would be an important constraint on the magnetic field strength and the ionization state of the source region ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "models of the ionosphere are required to predict radio emissions from the possible targets .      in this section",
    "we verify _ a posteriori _ that the velocity and temperature differences between different species in the thermosphere of hd209458b are small .",
    "this demonstrates that the single fluid approximation of the momentum and energy equations is valid , and that diffusive separation of the heavy species does not take place .",
    "our model includes velocity differences between different species by including all of the relevant collisions between them through the inclusion of diffusive fluxes in the continuity equations .",
    "however , we have explicitly assumed that @xmath145 , and this assumption in particular needs to be verified . also , the diffusion approach to the continuity equation is only valid if the velocity differences between the species are reasonably small .",
    "we calculated the collision frequencies based on the c2 model , and found that collisions with neutral h dominate the transport of heavy neutral atoms such as o below 3.5 @xmath2 . at altitudes",
    "higher than this , collisions with h@xmath1 are more frequent . in paper ii we demonstrate that a mass loss rate of 6  @xmath5  10@xmath134 kg  s@xmath7 is required to prevent diffusive separation of o ( the heaviest neutral species detected so far ) in the thermosphere .",
    "the mass loss rate in our models is @xmath146  10@xmath6 kg  s@xmath7 and thus o is dragged along to high altitudes by h. on the other hand , collisions with h@xmath1 dominate the transport of heavy ions such as si@xmath1 as long as the ratio [ h@xmath1]/[h ]  @xmath148  10@xmath149 ( paper ii ) .",
    "this explains why coulomb collisions in our models are more frequent than heavy ion - h collisions at almost all altitudes apart from the immediate vicinity of the lower boundary .",
    "these collisions are much more efficient in preventing diffusive separation than collisions with neutral h.    figure  [ fig : difftimes ] compares the timescale for diffusion @xmath150 for o and si@xmath1 with the timescale for advection @xmath151 based on the c2 model . in both cases , @xmath152 and",
    "thus diffusion is not significant .",
    "this implies that there are no significant velocity differences between heavy atoms and hydrogen .",
    "we note that coulomb collisions of doubly ionized species with h@xmath1 are more frequent than collisions between a singly ionized species and h@xmath1 .",
    "thus diffusion is even less significant for a species like si@xmath10 .",
    "we verified these results from our simulations by switching diffusion off in the model and rerunning the c2 model . as a result",
    "the density of the heavy atoms and ions increased slightly at high altitudes , but the differences are not significant  the results were nearly identical to the density profiles of the original simulation .     of o and si@xmath1 , and for advection @xmath153 based on the c2 model .",
    "we calculated the diffusion coefficients in a mixture of h and h@xmath1 .",
    "the large scale height of the atmosphere and relatively high collision frequencies mean that diffusion is not significant ( @xmath154 ) in the thermosphere of hd209458b.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    we note that the atmosphere can also be mixed by vertical motions associated with circulation that are sometimes parameterized in one - dimensional models by the eddy diffusion coefficient @xmath155 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this mechanism is efficient in bringing the heavy elements to the lower thermosphere but it is unlikely to mix the atmosphere up to 3 @xmath2 and beyond .",
    "also , there is no generally accepted method of estimating the degree of global mixing based on circulation models , and most circulation models for egps do not adequately treat the relevant energy deposition and forcing mechanisms in the upper atmosphere . thus there is considerable uncertainty over the values of @xmath155 and rapid escape is a much more likely explanation for the lack of diffusive separation on hd209458b .",
    "in fact , the calculations of @xcite show that the temperature in the thermosphere of planets such as hd209458b is high enough to practically guarantee an effective escape rate .",
    "the only way to prevent this is to provide enough radiative cooling to offset most of the xuv flux , but there are no radiative cooling mechanisms efficient enough to achieve this in a thermosphere composed of atoms and ions .",
    "as we noted above , the temperatures of the electrons , ions , and neutrals are roughly equal in the thermosphere of hd209458b . in order to show this",
    ", we assumed that photoelectrons share their energy with thermal electrons , which then share this energy further with ions and neutrals .",
    "we also assumed that the collisions frequencies between the species are higher than the timescale for advection .",
    "if the velocity differences between the species are negligible , the steady state 5-moment energy equations for thermal electrons and ions @xcite can be used to obtain the following approximations : @xmath156 where @xmath157 is the volume heating rate , and @xmath158 and @xmath159 are the electron - ion and ion - neutral momentum transfer collision frequencies , respectively .",
    "we calculated the temperature differences for h , h@xmath1 , and electrons based on the c2 model .",
    "the difference between the electron and ion temperatures decreases with altitude and is mostly less than 2 k. the difference between the ion and neutral temperatures , on the other hand , increases with altitude .",
    "the ion temperature is approximately 10 k higher than the neutral temperature near 5 @xmath2 and the difference reaches 150 k at 16 @xmath2 . in both cases , the temperature differences are negligible compared to the temperature of the thermosphere .",
    "further , the timescale for advection in the c2 model is always significantly longer than the relevant collision timescales .",
    "thus we have shown that @xmath160 and that equations ( [ eqn : temp1 ] ) and ( [ eqn : temp2 ] ) are approximately valid .",
    "we have constructed a new model for the upper atmosphere of hd209458b in order to explain the detections of h , o , c@xmath1 , and si@xmath10 at high altitudes around the planet @xcite .",
    "there are many different interpretations of the observed transits in the h lyman  @xmath37 line @xcite , and these interpretations rely on results from models of the upper atmosphere that are based on many uncertain assumptions ( see section  [ subsc : gendep ] and * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) .",
    "also , the detection of heavy atoms and ions in the thermosphere is not without controversy , and the detection of si@xmath10 is particularly intriguing . thus these observations present several interesting challenges to modelers .",
    "the observed transit depths are large , and substantial abundances of the relevant species are required to explain the observations . however , on every planet in the solar system heavier species are removed from the thermosphere by molecular diffusion and doubly ionized species are not commonly observed .",
    "also , the observations imply that h and o remain mostly neutral in the thermosphere while c and si are mostly ionized at a relatively low altitude .",
    "hydrodynamic models coupled with chemistry and thermal structure calculations are required to explain the detection of these species in the upper atmosphere and the differences between their density profiles .",
    "ours is the first such model that benefits from repeated detections of both neutral atoms and ions to constrain the composition and temperature .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that the h lyman  @xmath37 transit observations @xcite can be explained with absorption by h in the thermosphere if the base of the hot layer of h is near 1 @xmath0bar , the mean temperature within the layer is about 8,250 k , and the atmosphere is mostly ionized above 3 @xmath2 .",
    "these parameters are based on fitting the data with a simple empirical model of the upper atmosphere .",
    "the density and temperature profiles from our new hydrodynamic model agree qualitatively with these constraints , demonstrating that the basic assumptions of @xcite are reasonable .",
    "this confirms once again that a comet - like tail @xcite or energetic neutral atoms @xcite are not necessarily required to explain the h  lyman  @xmath37 observations .    in line with recent results by @xcite and the empirical constraints mentioned above , we used a photochemical model of the lower atmosphere to show that h@xmath3 dissociates near the 1 @xmath0bar level . above this level , the lack of efficient radiative cooling and strong stellar euv heating lead to high temperatures .",
    "we constrained the range of possible mean ( pressure averaged ) temperatures based on the average solar flux by using the hydrodynamic model to calculate temperatures with different heating efficiencies . for net heating efficiencies between 0.1 and 1 ,",
    "the mean temperature below 3 @xmath2 varies from 6,000 k to 8,000 k. this means that 8,000 k is a relatively strict upper limit on the mean temperature if the xuv flux of hd209458 is similar to the corresponding flux of the sun .",
    "a mean temperature of 8,250 k estimated from the observations implies the presence of an additional non - radiative heat source , or that the xuv flux from hd209458 is higher than the average solar flux . given that our best estimate of the net heating efficiency is 0.44 ( see section  [ subsc : cecchieff ] )",
    ", the xuv flux of h209458 would have to be 510 times higher than the average solar flux to cause a mean temperature of 8,250 k ( see section  [ subsc : gendep ] ) .",
    "if the mean xuv flux of hd209458 is generally higher than the solar flux and the observations took place during stellar maximum , such an enhancement is not impossible .",
    "this would also lead to higher outflow velocity and mass loss rate .",
    "however , the uncertainty in the observed transit depths is also large @xcite , and it can accommodate a range of temperatures",
    ". therefore our reference model c2 with a mean temperature of 7,200 k also agrees qualitatively with the empirical constraints . in this respect , it is interesting to note that with 100x solar flux , the mean temperature is still only 9,800 k. temperatures significantly higher than 8,000 k ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) therefore imply a strong non - radiative heat source .",
    "in contrast to the mean temperature , the velocity and details of the temperature profile depend strongly on the heating efficiency and stellar flux ( see section  [ subsc : gendep ] ) .",
    "they are also sensitive to the upper and lower boundary conditions .",
    "this explains the large range of temperature and density profiles predicted by earlier models that arise from different boundary conditions and assumptions about the stellar flux , radiative transfer , and heating efficiencies .",
    "the differences highlight the need for accurate thermal structure calculations that are constrained by the available observations .",
    "these calculations are important because the density profiles of the detected species depend on the temperature and velocity profiles , and inappropriate assumptions made by the models can bias the interpretation of the observations .    in the absence of stellar gravity , the location of the sonic point and the outflow speed also depend on the heating efficiency . as the heating efficiency increases from 0.1 ( in models with the average solar flux ) , the high altitude temperature increases and the sonic point moves to lower altitudes , reaching down to 4 @xmath2 with a net heating efficiency of 1 .",
    "we found that supersonic solutions are possible as long as there is significant heating over a large altitude range above the temperature peak .",
    "this conclusion is supported both by the hydrodynamic model and new constraints from kinetic theory @xcite .",
    "however , the isentropic sonic point of the c2 model is located above the model domain . in principle , this is an interesting result but it should be treated with caution .",
    "we used parameterized heating efficiencies for low energy photons , and the location of the sonic point is very sensitive to the temperature profile .",

    "as long as the upper boundary is at a sufficiently high altitude , we found that the results based on the outflow boundary conditions and modified jeans conditions are identical ( see section  [ subsc : boundaries ] ) .",
    "this shows that our simulations are roughly consistent with kinetic theory .",
    "an agreement between these two types of boundary conditions on hd209458b is an interesting theoretical result .",
    "it shows that the boundary conditions for hydrodynamic escape are appropriate in this case .",
    "however , an upper boundary at 16 @xmath2 or higher is not necessarily justified for other reasons because we did not consider the effect of the possible planetary magnetic field , interaction of the atmosphere with the stellar wind , or horizontal transport ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we chose an upper boundary at a high altitude in order to preserve the integrity of the solution in our region of interest below 5 @xmath2 .",
    "the purpose of this work is to model energy deposition and photochemistry in this region .",
    "these aspects are often simplified in more complex models to a degree that it may be difficult to separate the effect of multiple dimensions and other complications from differences arising simply because of different assumptions about heating efficiencies and chemistry .",
    "also , the uncertainty in the observations does not necessarily justify the introduction of more free parameters to the problem until the basic properties of the thermosphere are better understood .",
    "however , technically we do not consider our solutions to be accurate far above 35 @xmath2 . instead",
    ", our results provide robust lower boundary conditions for more complex multidimensional models that characterize the atmosphere outside the roche lobe of the planet .",
    "results from such models can then be used to constrain the upper boundary conditions of the 1d models further .    in order to model the density profiles of the detected species in the ionosphere",
    ", we assumed solar abundances of the heavy elements @xcite , although this assumption can be adjusted as required to explain the observations ( paper ii ) .",
    "as we already stated we found that h@xmath3 , h@xmath3o , and co dissociate above the 1 @xmath0bar level , releasing h , o , and c to the thermosphere ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we note that the detection of si@xmath10 in the upper atmosphere implies that silicon does not condense into clouds of forsterite and enstatite in the lower atmosphere as argued by e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the dominant si species is then sio , which dissociates at a similar pressure level as the other molecules .",
    "in fact , practically all molecules dissociate below 0.1 @xmath0bar .",
    "this leads to an important simplification in hydrodynamic models of the thermosphere .",
    "the complex chemistry of molecular ions does not need to be included as long as the lower boundary is above the dissociation level .",
    "we found that the h / h@xmath1 transition occurs near 3 @xmath2 or , depending on the velocity profile , at even higher altitudes . the o / o@xmath1 transition is coupled to the h / h@xmath1 transition through charge exchange reactions . thus both h and o are mostly neutral up to the boundary of the roche lobe at 35 @xmath2 .",
    "in contrast , c is ionized near the 1 @xmath0bar level and c@xmath1 is the dominant carbon species in the thermosphere .",
    "si is also ionized near the 1 @xmath0bar level , and the balance between si@xmath1 and si@xmath10 is determined by charge exchange with h@xmath1 and h , respectively .",
    "si@xmath1 is the dominant silicon ion below 5 @xmath2 but the abundance of si@xmath10 is also significant .",
    "we found that neutral heavy atoms are dragged to the thermosphere by the escaping h , while heavy ions are transported efficiently by the escaping h@xmath1 .",
    "thus the advection timescale is much shorter than the diffusion timescale of the detected species , and diffusive separation does not take place in the thermosphere .",
    "we also verified that the neutral , ion , and electron temperatures are roughly equal .",
    "taken together , these results imply that the thermospheres of close - in egps can differ fundamentally from the gas giant planets in the solar system .",
    "for instance , the thermosphere of hd209458b is composed mainly of atoms and atomic ions , and diffusive separation of the common heavy species is prevented by the escape of h and h@xmath1 .",
    "it is important to note , however , that results such as these can not be freely generalized to other extrasolar planets . as in the solar system , each planet should be studied separately .",
    "for instance , the dissociation of molecules depends on the temperature profile that is shaped by the composition through radiative cooling and stellar heating .",
    "the mass loss rate and escape velocity , that determine whether diffusive separation takes place or not , depends on the escape mechanism that again depends on the temperature and composition of the upper atmosphere .",
    "the results from different models can only be verified by observations that are therefore required for multiple planets if we are to characterize escape in different systems and under different conditions . + we are grateful to a. volkov for reading the manuscript and providing useful feedback .",

    "<S> the detections of atomic hydrogen , heavy atoms and ions surrounding the extrasolar giant planet ( egp ) hd209458b constrain the composition , temperature and density profiles in its upper atmosphere . </S>",
    "<S> thus the observations provide guidance for models that have so far predicted a range of possible conditions . </S>",
    "<S> we present the first hydrodynamic escape model for the upper atmosphere that includes all of the detected species in order to explain their presence at high altitudes , and to further constrain the temperature and velocity profiles . </S>",
    "<S> this model calculates the stellar heating rates based on recent estimates of photoelectron heating efficiencies , and includes the photochemistry of heavy atoms and ions in addition to hydrogen and helium . </S>",
    "<S> the composition at the lower boundary of the escape model is constrained by a full photochemical model of the lower atmosphere . </S>",
    "<S> we confirm that molecules dissociate near the 1 @xmath0bar level , and find that complex molecular chemistry does not need to be included above this level . </S>",
    "<S> we also confirm that diffusive separation of the detected species does not occur because the heavy atoms and ions collide frequently with the rapidly escaping h and h@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> this means that the abundance of the heavy atoms and ions in the thermosphere simply depends on the elemental abundances and ionization rates . </S>",
    "<S> we show that , as expected , h and o remain mostly neutral up to at least 3 @xmath2 , whereas both c and si are mostly ionized at significantly lower altitudes . </S>",
    "<S> we also explore the temperature and velocity profiles , and find that the outflow speed and the temperature gradients depend strongly on the assumed heating efficiencies . </S>",
    "<S> our models predict an upper limit of 8,000 k for the mean ( pressure averaged ) temperature below 3 @xmath2 , with a typical value of 7,000 k based on the average solar xuv flux at 0.047 au . </S>",
    "<S> we use these temperature limits and the observations to evaluate the role of stellar energy in heating the upper atmosphere .    </S>",
