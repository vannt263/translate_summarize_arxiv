    "the first evidence of the superiority of quantum over thermal fluctuations in order to find the global minimum of a real physical system was only obtained in 1999 , in the context of quantum spin glasses @xcite .",

    "sqa has proved to work less efficiently than sta in other problems , such as 3-sat @xcite and some benchmark 1d potentials @xcite .    despite the success of the pimc - sqa , there are reasons to look for different implementations @xcite .",
    "first of all , pimc simulations must be carried out at finite temperature , with lower temperatures requiring a larger number or replicas and , therefore , higher computational cost .",

    "some comments about it are provided in section [ discussion ] .",
    "this preliminary analysis can be summarized as : ( a ) the energy landscape of the classical problem is complex , and ( b ) there is a quantum phase transition at a finite value of @xmath6 .",
    "quantum wavefunction annealing ( qwa ) is an implementation of simulated quantum annealing ( sqa ) which does not require real time evolution , configurations sampling or trotter splitting .",
    "it makes extensive use of matrix product states ( mps ) @xcite and the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) @xcite . for the benefit of the readers which are not acquainted with those techniques ,",
    "the first paragraph of this section describes a simpler formulation based on the lanczos algorithm , but which can only be used for very small lattices .",
    "the lanczos diagonalization method improves its performance dramatically if a good seed to the real ground state of the system is provided @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian given by equation [ ritf ] has a simple behaviour for @xmath14 : its ground state is known to be given by the state @xmath49 defined in equation [ paramagnetic_state ] .",
    "therefore , starting with such a state as a seed , it is fairly easy for the lanczos algorithm to obtain the exact ground state for a finite but high value @xmath50 .",
    "this value may be decreased at small finite steps , @xmath51 , and the ground state for the previous value of @xmath6 can be employed as the seed for the computation of the ground state at the new value . in quantum annealing , the adiabatic theorem is needed in order to prove that convergence to the cgs is sure in the limit @xmath52 . in our case ,",
    "a weaker result is enough : convergence is sure as long as there is a finite overlap between the ground states at any two consecutive values of @xmath6 .",
    "the obvious drawback of the previous algorithm is the size of the hilbert space , @xmath53 . using the plain lanczos algorithm ,",
    "all the wavefunction components should be stored and acted upon .",
    "a solution is to choose a low - dimensional subspace which is known to contain the ground state of the hamiltonian given by equation [ ritf ] for all values of @xmath6 .",
    "matrix product states ( mps ) can provide such a subspace in some cases .",
    "these states may be written down as :    @xmath54    where @xmath55 are the eigenstates of @xmath8 and the @xmath56 are @xmath57 matrices of dimension @xmath58 , whose entries are the variational parameters of our ansatz .",
    "the dimension of the mps subspace is , therefore , bounded by @xmath59 .",
    "both the computational cost and the accuracy of the method depend strongly on the dimension @xmath60 of the matrices , whose physical meaning is the following : for all possible left - right splittings of the system , the ground state is approximated retaining @xmath60 states to represent the left part and other @xmath60 states for the right part . for any possible state of the system , its representation as an mps becomes exact for @xmath60 large enough .",
    "of course , the dimensions @xmath60 can be made local , @xmath61 , if necessary .",
    "the dmrg is a variational method within the subspace of the mps @xcite .",
    "it profits from the use of a density matrix in order to select the @xmath60 states for the left and right blocks which fit best to our current approximation of the global ground state .",
    "the neglected eigenvalues of the density matrix provide a way to monitor the accuracy of the method . in all our applications , the tolerance to the total _ neglected probabilities _",
    "is fixed beforehand to a certain value @xmath62 , and the number of retained states @xmath63 , is adapted in consonance .",
    "the mps represent _ faithfully _ ground states of local 1d hamiltonians @xcite .",
    "in other cases , at this stage , only educated experience can decide whether they are appropriate or not .",
    "they are specially suited to 1d and quasi-1d problems ( e.g. ladders , trees ) , although natural extensions to higher dimensions are in active development @xcite .",
    "a crucial tool is von neumann s _ block entropy _ , @xmath64 . in crude terms",
    ", @xmath60 should scale as @xmath65 in order to obtain an accurate dmrg method . in 1d ,",
    "the entropy @xmath66 is known to be bounded for non - critical systems and to scale as @xmath67 for a critical one @xcite . for higher dimensions , the _ area law _ predicts the entropy to scale as @xmath68 out of criticality , where @xmath24 is a typical dimension of the system @xcite .    as in the lanczos case",
    ", the dmrg can benefit from a good _ seed _ when searching the ground state of a hamiltonian through the use of the _ wavefunction transformations _",
    "@xcite , which allow to use the solution of an rg - step as an initial step for the next one .",
    "having found the ground state of a certain hamiltonian @xmath69 , a few finite - size sweeps will",
    "_ adapt _ it to become the ground state of a slightly modified hamiltonian @xmath70 . in normal cases ,",
    "this procedure is not needed , since the number of sweeps required for convergence to the ground state for any hamiltonian is small .",
    "it may become very useful when ( a ) it is known that the ground state of a certain hamiltonian _ can _ be represented as a mps with low @xmath60 but ( b ) the probability of the dmrg getting stuck at an excited state is very high .",
    "this is the case for the ground state of [ ritf ] in the quantum spin - glass phase@xcite .",
    "our proposed qwa algorithm is , therefore , the following one :    * ( a ) * : :    the ground state of the system [ ritf ] is obtained for very high    @xmath6 . *",
    "( b ) * : :    the transverse field @xmath6 is decreased    @xmath71 . * ( c ) * : :    a few finite - size sweeps of the dmrg are carried out , which adapt the    ground state to the current value of @xmath6 . *",
    "( d ) * : :    go to ( b ) if @xmath6 is not yet zero .",
    "* ( e ) * : :    measure the energy and classical ground state .",
    "this approach is _ deterministic _ , i.e. : not limited by sampling problems .",
    "it works directly with the quantum hamiltonian , therefore does not require any trotter break - up , and works directly at @xmath17 . since it does not simulate real time evolution , it is not prone to landau - zener level - crossings .",
    "loss of adiabaticity is not , therefore , a crucial issue .",
    "as it was stated , it is enough to ensure that the overlap between the ground states at consecutive values of @xmath6 is finite .",
    "a high value of @xmath72 is allowed far away from the quantum phase transition , while a more reduced value will be taken near it .",
    "our precise adaptive reduction schedule is described in the following section .    on the negative side",
    ", it is based on a method which is specially designed for 1d systems .",
    "we will say more about this in the conclusions .",
    "its main weakness stems from the inability of the mps to represent faithfully the ground state for all values of @xmath6 for higher dimension .",
    "the efficiency and practical issues of the implementation are analyzed in the next section .",
    "in order to study the applicability of qwa , we have generated random samples of ladders with @xmath73 and @xmath74 legs , and lengths ranging from @xmath75 to @xmath76 . we have also considered random graphs of fixed connectivity @xmath77 and , as a check , we have also analysed linear chains ( although the optimization problem is trivial in that case ) .",
    "the annealing scheme has always been the same : starting with @xmath78 and using an adaptative reduction , @xmath51 with    @xmath79    where @xmath66 is the maximum block entropy for the previous value of @xmath6 . this way we ensure",
    "that , near the qsgt when the entropy is higher the steps are shorter .",
    "we insist in this fact : the adiabatic theorem and landau - zener level crossings are not the limitations of this method .",
    "therefore , a decrease in the size of the steps does not necessarily increase the probability of success .",
    "the last annealing step was always taken with @xmath80 , a value which is low enough for practical purposes .",
    "the obtention of the minimum energy configuration was carried out measuring the @xmath81-component of the spin polarization of all sites after convergence for @xmath82 . of course ,",
    "due to the obvious symmetry @xmath13 , the expectation value for each of these components is zero .",
    "we have used a common procedure in quantum spin - glass calculations : the insertion of a very small longitudinal magnetic field @xmath83 in a single site , selected at random , in order to break the symmetry . in the qsg phase , because of the divergence of the spin - glass susceptibility discussed above , an infinitesimal localized magnetic field polarizes the full sample .    table [ results : table ] provides the basic set of results . for each geometry",
    "we have selected 20 samples and performed the qwa algorithm on them .",
    "we have also chosen different values of the neglected probabilities tolerance , @xmath62 .",
    "for each run , qwa is said to obtain a success if its minimum energy is equal to the value obtained by sta and pimc - sqa .",
    "qwa has had success , in all the attempted geometries , whenever @xmath84 .",
    "when the tolerance was decreased , the cgs was missed with higher probability , although the method can be seen to be rather robust for spin - glass ladders , since the tolerance must be raised up to @xmath85 in order to decrease the probability of success to @xmath86 .",

    "if the size is increased , that tolerance can not be set , since the number of states @xmath60 to be kept becomes prohibitive .",
    "therefore , we have carried out the experiments with @xmath121 for a @xmath122 sample , and the probability of success reduces to @xmath123 .",
    "the time for the qwa algorithm scales as a power law of the system size : @xmath124 . for linear chains , using the results from table [ results : table ] , @xmath125 . for 2-legged ladders , @xmath126 . in the case of the 4-legged ladders ,",
    "the power law fit has a higher errorbar , with a surprising exponent of @xmath127 .      this polynomial growth can be theoretically explained . for quasi-1d systems at criticality",
    ", the von neumann entropy grows as a logarithm of the system size@xcite , @xmath128 .",
    "the value of @xmath129 has been related , in some random systems , to the central charge of the associated conformal field theory@xcite . on the other hand , the maximum number of retained states scales as the exponential of the entropy , @xmath130 , and the time for a dmrg sweep scales as @xmath131 .",
    "the most expensive dmrg sweep for a qwa simulation takes place at the critical point , and therefore we may expect @xmath132 .",
    "thus , the theoretical prediction is @xmath133 .    in the linear chain case ,",
    "the entropy at criticality was predicted by refael and moore @xcite to have a coefficient @xmath134 , in agreement with our own numerical measurements .",
    "therefore , the theoretical prediction for the @xmath135 exponent is @xmath136 , which is not far from the @xmath137 obtained numerically . in the case of the 2-legged ladder , there is no theoretical estimate , but our own numerical simulations provide a value @xmath138 , thus giving an estimate for @xmath135 around @xmath139 , in agreement with the numerically observed value @xmath140 .",
    "in this paper we have introduced a method for the obtention of the minimum energy configuration of a spin - glass , based on the annealing of the full wavefunction represented as a matrix product state ( mps ) using the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) .",
    "the method has been termed _ quantum wavefunction annealing _ ( qwa ) , and we have assessed and quantified its efficiency , by comparing its results with those provided by other robust methods . for spin - glass ladders of 2 and 4 legs with lengths ranging from @xmath87 to @xmath94 , the method has always provided the optimum solution when the probability tolerance is set to @xmath84 .",
    "the running time scales as @xmath141 for 2-legged ladders , and , surprisingly , as @xmath142 for 4-legged ones .",
    "this anomaly requires further clarification , perhaps in the line of thought of ferraro et al @xcite . for random graphs with fixed connectivity @xmath77 ,",
    "on the other hand , the tolerance has to be increased in practice to @xmath118 , and the probability of success falls to @xmath123 for @xmath122 .    the most crucial parameter which determines the success of the method is the probability tolerance @xmath62 . whenever we were able to set @xmath84 , for whichever topology , the system always attained the optimum configuration .",
    "unfortunately , for topologies which are not quasi-1d , the number of retained states in dmrg , @xmath60 , grows very fast when the tolerance is decreased .",
    "other parameters , such as the annealing velocity , do not have such a direct relevance to the quality of the results .",
    "loss of adiabaticity is not the main issue for this method : a finite overlap between the ground state wavefunctions at consecutive annealing steps is enough to ensure convergence , as long as the number of retained states @xmath60 is large enough for our ansatz wavefunction to represent both of them faithfully .",
    "therefore , it seems reasonable to think that qwa can be converted into a method to find the optimum configuration of all quasi-1d systems in polynomial time .",
    "this suggests that , in fact , no quasi-1d problem can be np - complete . on the other hand , for problems which are known to be np - complete , such as the random ising spin - glass in a 2d lattice with a longitudinal field , or on random graphs of fixed connectivity , the time for an algorithm which is able to obtain the optimum with certainty should scale exponentially with the size of the system .",
    "this fact puts a limit to possible extensions of the qwa algorithm described in this paper .",
    "the natural extension of the mps are the _ tensor product states _",
    "( tps ) analyzed by nishino and coworkers @xcite or the pair - entangled particle states ( peps ) @xcite of verstraete and cirac .",
    "the computational power of this type of states has been analyzed recently @xcite , pointing to the fact that any attempt to solve np - complete problems with an exact qwa algorithm using these states would require an exponential time , which is compatible with the usually believed notion that p @xmath143 np .",
    "the most promising lines for future work are , therefore , in the development of heuristic algorithms , running in polynomial time , which may give the absolute minimum energy state with high probability for _ some _ problems .",
    "a possibility is the development of a qwa algorithm using tps ( or peps ) with a fixed number of retained states @xmath60 .",
