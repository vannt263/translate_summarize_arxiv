    "the study of polyelectrolytes has attracted an increased attention in the scientific community over the last decades .",
    "this interest is motivated by technological applications including viscosity modifiers , or leak protectors and by the hope that advances in this domain will allow to unravel the structure of complex biological macromolecules .",
    "in these systems , the coulomb interactions leads to many remarkable and counterintuitive phenomena @xcite .",
    "a celebrated example is the manning - oosawa counterion condensation . in his classical work @xcite",
    ", manning showed that a charged rod - like polymer can create such a strong attractive force on its counterions , that a finite fraction condenses onto the polymer backbone .",
    "this condensation - phenomenon was also described by oosawa within a two state model @xcite .",
    "it leads to an effective decrease of the polymer charge , and the macroscopic properties of the polyelectrolyte , like migration in an electrophoresis experiment , are not determined by its bare charge , but by an effective charge that accounts for the manning - oosawa counterion condensation .",
    "it is now well - established that counterion condensation is a fundamental phenomenon , and that it occurs in many important systems including dna in both its double - stranded and single - stranded form @xcite .",
    "it was predicted in @xcite that condensation occurs whenever the average distance @xmath0 between co - ions on the polymer backbone is smaller than the bjerrum length @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the co - ion charge , @xmath3 the thermal energy and @xmath4 the ( relative ) dielectric constant of the solvent .",
    "this condensation is expected to lead to an average charge density of @xmath5 on the polymer backbone . since the original prediction by manning ,",
    "important efforts have been devoted to a description of the manning - oosawa condensation within the poisson - boltzmann theory and beyond @xcite , establishing the influence of salt , the thickness of the condensed counterion layer and the corrections induced by short range correlation .",
    "while the conformation of many polyelectrolytes is well described by the rod - like model , many proteins organize into complex self - assembled structures @xcite . a challenging and important topic",
    "is the extent to which the structural complexity of biological enzymes can be understood from simple physical models .",
    "polyelectrolytes with an hydrophobic backbone may provide an interesting system , that achieves a certain degree of self - organization while the relevant interactions remain relatively simple .",
    "indeed it has been predicted in a seminal paper by dobrynin and rubinstein that hydrophobic polyelectrolytes should fold into an organized pearl - necklace structure where regions of high and low monomer density coexist @xcite",
    ". therefore both theoretical and experimental studies of the hydrophobic polyelectrolytes have shown a growing activity in the past few years @xcite .",
    "the question of the validity of the manning condensation model for hydrophobic polyelectrolytes has been addressed experimentally by w. essafi _",
    "the authors have measured the effective charge fraction of a highly charged hydrophobic polyelectrolyte ( poly(styrene)-co - styrene sulphonate ) by osmotic - pressure and cryoscopy measurements .",
    "their findings , which are recalled on fig .",
    "4 , showed that the measured effective charge is significantly smaller than that predicted by the manning - oosawa theory .",
    "the aim of the present article is to provide a theoretical explanation of the counterion condensation in this system , where the presence of hydrophobic interactions influences drastically the conformation of the polymer backbone .",
    "this problem was first addressed theoretically by dobrynin , and rubinstein @xcite , who determined the phase diagram of a solution of hydrophobic polyelectrolytes as a function of solvent quality and polymer concentration .",
    "however the question of the effective charge was not directly investigated by the authors .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii the pearl - necklace model is reviewed briefly , while the poisson - boltzmann theory of a hydrophobic globule permeable to counterions is performed in sec .",
    "the resulting effective charge is analyzed in sec .",
    "some aspects of the model are discussed in sec .",
    "v and finally , sec .",
    "vi concludes the paper .",
    "let us first recall for completeness the pearl - necklace theory of hydrophobic polyelectrolytes ( for a more complete review see @xcite ) .",
    "the polyelectrolyte solution is parameterized by its degree of polymerization @xmath6 , its monomer size @xmath7 , the charge fraction along the chain @xmath8 , and the reduced temperature @xmath9 , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 denote the theta temperature of the polyelectrolyte and the temperature of the system , respectively .",
    "we note that in a bad solvent , the reduced temperature is negative @xmath12 .",
    "we let @xmath13 be the average monomer concentration in the solution .    in a poor solvent , an uncharged polymer forms a globule in order to decrease its surface energy . in a similar way ,",
    "a drop of water adopts a spherical configuration in a hydrophobic environment .    to estimate the gyration radius @xmath14 of the polymer , we divide the polymer into smaller units , in such a way that inside each unit the thermal fluctuations dominate and the chain has gaussian behavior .",
    "these units are usually called thermal blobs in the literature and the typical radius of the blobs is denoted by @xmath15 .",
    "it can be shown that they contain about @xmath16 monomers , and have a typical size of @xmath17 . at larger scales ,",
    "the polymer tends to collapse onto itself in order to minimize its contact surface with the liquid .",
    "this can happen by forming a dense packing of thermal blobs .",
    "a polymer of polymerization degree @xmath6 can be split into @xmath18 thermal blobs and the volume occupied by the polymer is proportional to the number of subunits .",
    "therefore one can estimate the gyration radius of the polymer as @xmath19 the surface energy @xmath20 associated with this configuration is given by @xmath3 times the number of thermal blobs in contact with the solvent .",
    "this leads to @xmath21    upon charging , the electrostatic repulsion sets in , which results in a change of the globule shape .",
    "when the electrostatic repulsion energy becomes larger than the surface energy , the globule splits into several globules of smaller size consisting of @xmath22 monomers .",
    "the typical size of these globules can be found from eq .",
    "( [ eq : rg ] ) with the number of monomers @xmath22 , which gives @xmath23 this behavior is reminiscent of the rayleigh instability of a charged droplet @xcite . in this state ,",
    "the polyelectrolyte forms a sequence of globules that are connected by strings made of thermal blobs ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig - pearl ] ) . in the literature , this conformation is known as the `` pearl - necklace '' structure .",
    "the presence of counterions will screen the electrostatic repulsion .",
    "therefore it is important to account for their role explicitly in the balance between the surface tension and the electrostatic repulsion that governs the equilibrium structure of the necklace .",
    ", that we call pearl or globule in the text .",
    "the inset shows on a larger scale , that these pearls are connected by thin polymer strings , thus forming the pearl necklace structure .",
    "the average distance between the pearls is @xmath24 ( black vertical scale line ) .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ] +    for simplicity we assume that the main effect of the counterions is to reduce the charge of the pearls .",
    "indeed , some counterions can be attracted inside the globules due to the attractive electrostatic forces .",
    "we assume that the charged monomers of the polyelectrolyte have only one elementary charge @xmath2 . in the absence of any counterion condensation , the total electrostatic charge of a globule consisting of @xmath22 monomers",
    "is given by @xmath25 .",
    "as long as the counterions penetrate inside the globule , the effective charge of a globule is decreased and is given by @xmath26 , where @xmath27 denotes the effective charge fraction .",
    "we can understand this relation by noting that in the presence of counterion condensation the total charge of the pearl is the chemical charge of the pearl minus the charge of the counterions inside it .",
    "therefore , the electrostatic energy @xmath28 of a pearl can be estimated as @xmath29 where the bjerrum length is defined as @xmath30 where @xmath4 is the dielectric constant of the medium and @xmath3 denotes the thermal fluctuation energy .",
    "for example for water at room temperature ( @xmath31 , @xmath32 ) the value of the bjerrum length is @xmath33 . using the relation between @xmath14 and the @xmath22 given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : rg - ng ] ) , the electrostatic energy of a pearl is simplified to @xmath34 in its equilibrium configuration the pearl - necklace tends to balance its electrostatic and surface energies @xmath35 .",

    "this suggests that the hydrophobic polyelectrolytes studied in the experiment of w. essafi actually formed a pearl necklace structure .",
    "the problem of the effective charge of spherical microion - permeable globules of size @xmath14 surrounded by their own counterions can be solved in the mean - field approximation using the poisson - boltzmann theory .",
    "this problem was first studied numerically and analytically by wall and berkowitz @xcite .",
    "it was shown that counterion condensation around such a globule is possible ( see e.g. ref @xcite for a general discussion of the condensation phenomenon ) . in this approach",
