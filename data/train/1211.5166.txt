    "the bond valence of an individual bond @xmath8 is defined in eq ( 7 ) to be proportional to the square of hopping integral @xmath25 .",

    "the desired bond valence of @xmath97 in the undistorted structure is set to be @xmath78 , and therefore the hopping integral is equal to @xmath98 , where @xmath99 is a constant .",

    "accordingly , the hopping integral for the longer @xmath97 become @xmath106 and the shorter one @xmath107 . the bond - valence conservation principle is obeyed in both structures so they can not be distringuised at the second moment or bond - valence level .",

    "<S> we present a modified bond - valence model of pbtio@xmath0 based on the principles of bond - valence and bond - valence vector conservation . the relationship between the bond - valence model and the bond - order potential </S>",
    "<S> is derived analytically in the framework of a tight - binding model . </S>",
    "<S> a new energy term , bond - valence vector energy , is introduced into the atomistic model and the potential parameters are re - optimized . </S>",
    "<S> the new model potential can be applied both to canonical ensemble ( @xmath1 ) and isobaric - isothermal ensemble ( @xmath2 ) molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations . </S>",
    "<S> this model reproduces the experimental phase transition in @xmath1 md simulations and also exhibits the experimental sequence of temperature - driven and pressure - driven phase transitions in @xmath2 simulations . </S>",
    "<S> we expect that this improved bond - valence model can be applied to a broad range of inorganic materials .    </S>",
    "<S> the use of ferroelectric perovskite oxides in a variety of technological applications has prompted extensive investigations of their structure and dynamics .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite first - principles density functional theory ( dft ) calculations have played an important role in enhancing microscopic understanding of the relationships between composition , structure and properties .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite despite the success of first - principles methods , the great computational expense and the difficulties of studying finite - temperature properties have driven the development of more efficient atomistic and effective hamiltonian potentials suitable for large - scale molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite in particular , an atomistic potential based on the widely used bond - valence ( bv ) theory  @xcite has been developed .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite bv - based atomistic potentials have since been used to study phase transitions  @xcite and domain wall motion in pbtio@xmath0  @xcite , as well as structure and dynamics in the classic 0.75pbmg@xmath3nb@xmath4o@xmath0 - 0.25pbtio@xmath0 relaxor ferroelectric material .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite + the bond - valence theory , or bond - valence conservation principle , states that in a crystal structure , each atom @xmath5 prefers to obtain a certain atomic valence , @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the actual atomic valence @xmath7 , for atom @xmath5 can be obtained by summing over the bond valences @xmath8 , which can be calculated from an empirical inverse power - law relationship  @xcite between bond valence and bond length @xmath9 : @xmath10 @xmath11 and @xmath12 are brown s empirical parameters . </S>",
    "<S> the energy contribution of the bond - valence is chosen to have the following form : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the atomic bond - valence energy and @xmath15 is a scaling parameter . + despite the success of the rather simple ten - parameter bv model potential  @xcite for pbtio@xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> , no rigorous quantum mechanical justification has been provided for the bond - valence potential energy , raising questions about the general applicability of this type of atomistic potential . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the potentials obtained in previous work  @xcite were found to be accurate for @xmath1 simulations only , with incorrect ground state structures obtained when the constant volume constraint is lifted . in this paper , we show how the bond - valence energy can be derived from the second - moment bond - order potential , extend the model to represent higher moments of the local density of states ( ldos ) , and show that this allows accurate simulations for both constant - volume and constant - pressure conditions . </S>",
    "<S> + an analysis of the physics that gives rises to the bond - valence conservation principle shows that the bond - valence energy can be naturally derived from the second - moment bond - order potential , such as the well - known finnis - sinclair potential .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite within the framework of a tight - binding model  @xcite , the finnis - sinclair potential can be partitioned into atomic contributions as : @xmath16,\\ ] ] where @xmath17 is the atomic position , @xmath18 is the local atomic energy and @xmath19 is a pair - wise repulsive potential depending on the distance between atom @xmath5 and its nearest - neighboring atom @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> the second term represents the bonding energy ; @xmath21 is a constant and @xmath22 is the second moment of the ldos . </S>",
    "<S> the second moment @xmath22 measures the width of the ldos distribution , and as shown by cyrot - lackmann and ducastelle ,  @xcite can be evaluated from the summation over all the nearest - neighbor hopping paths that start and end on atom @xmath5 : @xmath23 where @xmath24 means the summation of nearest neighbors of @xmath5 , and @xmath25 is the _ averaged _ hopping integral between atom @xmath5 and @xmath20 . because the overlap of atomic orbitals decays as @xmath26  @xcite , eq  ( 3 ) can be written as @xmath27 with @xmath28 and @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is a constant that scales the strength of the repulsive interactions between atom @xmath5 and atom @xmath20 , and @xmath31 scales the bonding interaction . + despite the different appearance of eq  ( [ bve ] ) and eq  ( [ ufs ] ) , we can rewrite the bond - valence energy in a similar form to the fs potential . </S>",
    "<S> first of all , we point out that the energy function for bond - valence energy is not unique since eq  ( [ bve ] ) simply enforces that any deviation from the desired atomic valence will incur an energy penalty . in principle , </S>",
    "<S> any energy function that reflects this principle should be equivalent to eq  ( [ bve ] ) . therefore , we could rewrite the bond - valence energy as @xmath32 with @xmath33 as a scaling parameter . </S>",
    "<S> the bond - valence is an empirical concept , and it has been modeled with various functional forms including inverse power law and exponential .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for the narrow range of distances of first nearest neighbor pairs , exponential and power law yield similar results . </S>",
    "<S> given that the bond - valence reflects the bonding strength , we define it as an exponential of the interatomic distance : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is a parameter depending upon the type of atomic pair . </S>",
    "<S> expanding eq  ( [ bve2 ] ) gives @xmath36 the last term , @xmath37 , is a constant and will cancel out when energy differences are considered . </S>",
    "<S> henceforth we will not write out this constant term explicitly . substituting eq  ( [ bv2 ] ) into eq  ( [ bve3 ] ) , we obtain @xmath38 it becomes evident that the bond - valence energy expressed in eq  ( [ bve4 ] ) is remarkably similar to the fs potential in eq  ( [ ufs ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> eq  ( [ ufs ] ) and eq  ( [ bve4 ] ) becomes equivalent if we choose    [ bv5 ] @xmath39 @xmath40    rearranging eq  ( [ bv5 ] ) , we obtain @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , for any system where the ratio of coefficients for bonding and repulsive interactions , @xmath42 , is constant among the neighbors of atom @xmath5 , this ratio defines this atom s bond valence . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the bond valence energy eq  ( [ bve4 ] ) is equivalent to eq  ( [ ufs ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the equivalence between the bond - valence energy and the finnis - sinclair potential means that the bond - valence conservation experimentally observed in solids is based on the quantum - mechanical description of bonding that underlies the finnis - sinclair model . </S>",
    "<S> + compared to the bond - order potential , the application of the bond - valence model does not require extra efforts to parametrize hopping integrals , because the bond - valence parameters for a wide variety of atomic pairs are already known from crystallography .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite since the bond - valence model is a second - moment bond - order potential , its limitations , such as the inability to obtain the correct ground state structure in @xmath2 simulations , are likely due to the fact that the second moment only accounts for the width of ldos but does not reflect its shape . </S>",
    "<S> one consequence of this is that the bv energy depends only on the total valence and is entirely insensitive to the number of bonds or their relative strengths . </S>",
    "<S> this feature of all second - moment models makes it difficult to distinguish between competing crystal structures , which are controlled by the higher moments .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite therefore , a systematic way to improve the bond - valence model is to include the contributions of higher moments of the ldos ( such as fourth moment ) to the total energy .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite + in this work , we choose the bond - valence vector sum ( bvvs )  @xcite to reflect the change of the fourth moment of the ldos . </S>",
    "<S> the bond - valence vector is defined as a vector lying along the bond with magnitude equal to the bond - valence ( @xmath43 ) , as shown in figure 1 . </S>",
    "<S> a simple argument is presented in the appendix to illustrate the relationship between the fourth moment of the ldos and the sum of the bond - valence vectors in a periodic structure . </S>",
    "<S> generally , the changes in the local symmetry of the bonding environment affect the value of the fourth moment of the ldos , which is also reflected by the change of bvvs . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that bvvs is a natural way to capture the change in the fourth moment of ldos . for many materials </S>",
    "<S> , it has been shown that the ground - state structure favors symmetric local bonding environment and a zero bvvs . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the criterion of bvvs = 0 for the ground - state structure has been suggested as a complement to the original bond - valence conservation principle .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite however , this is not followed for crystal structures in which symmetry breaking ( bvvs @xmath44 0 ) becomes significant due to electronic - structure driven distortions , such as the second order jahn - teller distortion exhibited by ti atoms in an octahedral environment and the stereochemical lone - pair driven distortions of pb@xmath45 cation . </S>",
    "<S> the bvvs can thus be considered as a measure of local symmetry breaking . we therefore generalize this principle by proposing that each ion has a desired length of bond - valence vector sum . </S>",
    "<S> the bond - valence vector energy , @xmath46 , is defined as @xmath47 where @xmath48 @xmath49 is the scaling factor , @xmath50 is the calculated bond - valence vector sum and @xmath51 is the desired value of bond - valence vector sum . </S>",
    "<S> it is noted that only the norm of the bond - valence vector sum is taken in the energy term ( square of @xmath52 ) since the energy is a scalar quantity and the energy expression should bot break the system symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> the value of @xmath51 can be computed using the optimized atomic positions in the lowest - energy structure identified from first principles . </S>",
    "<S> we note here that the proposed bvv energy is a simplified fourth - moment bond - order potential , as the calculation of bvvs for a given atom only requires the knowledge of its nearest neighbors . </S>",
    "<S> + the interatomic potential for our modified bond - valence model is given by : @xmath53 @xmath54 @xmath55 @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the coulomb energy and @xmath58 is the short - range repulsive lennard - jones energy . in both the finnis - sinclair potential and the bond - valence model , only averaged hopping integrals between neighboring atoms are used , which is equivalent to approximating all the atomic orbitals as @xmath59-type .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite however , bonding in pbtio@xmath0 involves @xmath60-@xmath61 orbital hybridizations , which do display angular dependence . </S>",
    "<S> physically , in pbtio@xmath0 this results in an energy cost for rotations of oxygen octahedra . to introduce the dependence of energy on the interatomic angles </S>",
    "<S> , we include an angle potential term , @xmath62 , which is defined locally for all the o - o - o angles along the oxygen octahedral axes , as shown in figure 2 . </S>",
    "<S> this rotationally - invariant angle potential prevents unphysically large tilting of oxygen octahedra . </S>",
    "<S> + the potential parameters required to be fitted for pbtio@xmath0 can be summarized as follows : spring constant @xmath63 for angle potential , charges @xmath64 , scaling factors @xmath15 and @xmath49 for each species , and short - range repulsion parameters , @xmath65 , for each pair type ( pb - ti , pb - o , ti - o and o - o ) . </S>",
    "<S> the brown s empirical parameters ( @xmath11 and @xmath66 ) are taken from ref . </S>",
    "<S> 23 and ref . 24 . </S>",
    "<S> we implemented this bond - valence model in the lammps code .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite +    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     figure 3 shows our parameterization protocol . </S>",
    "<S> the optimization of the potential parameters is performed using simulated annealing ( sa ) global optimization method to fit a database of structural energy differences and atomic forces ( @xmath67 & * f * ) derived from _ ab initio _ dft calculations with the abinit code .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite we used the @xmath68 supercell as the reference structure . </S>",
    "<S> the energy and atomic forces are computed with @xmath68 monkhorst - pack @xmath63-point mesh  @xcite using pbesol  @xcite as the exchange - correlation energy functional . </S>",
    "<S> we start with an initial database that contains the lowest - energy tetragonal structure , strained tetragonal structures , the lowest - energy cubic structure , strained cubic structures , and randomly picked orthorhombic structures with various lattice constants . after each sa run </S>",
    "<S> , the optimized potential parameters are used to perform constant - stress md simulations to generate equilibrium structures at various temperatures , which are then put back to the database . </S>",
    "<S> the process is continued until the energies and forces of the structures sampled during md simulations are accurately reproduced ( difference between md value and dft value is @xmath694  mev / atom ) . </S>",
    "<S> + table i presents the optimized potential parameters . to account for the overestimation of the pbtio@xmath0 @xmath70 ratio by pbesol ( @xmath70=1.10 versus @xmath70=1.07 experimentally )  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , we adjusted brown s empirical parameter @xmath11 to make the @xmath71 for pb , ti and o reach their atomic valences in the lowest - energy tetragonal structure obtained with pbesol . </S>",
    "<S> the value of preferred bvvs is then calculated with the modified @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the oxygen atoms do not have a preference for a specific value of bond - valence vector sum . </S>",
    "<S> this is because in perovskites , some oxygen atoms are highly displaced ( @xmath72 ) , while others stay around the high - symmetry point ( @xmath73 ) . so the bvvs term is included for pb and ti only . </S>",
    "<S> + using this optimized model potential for pbtio@xmath0 , we studied the temperature dependence of lattice constants , polarization and displacements of pb and ti ions using an @xmath74 supercell . </S>",
    "<S> we first performed canonical - ensemble md simulations with lattice constants fixed to experimental values , using the nos - hoover thermostat to control the temperature . </S>",
    "<S> figure 4(a ) shows the evolution of polarization at different temperatures : only @xmath75 along the @xmath76 axis has significant values at low temperature and the overall polarization becomes zero at and above @xmath77 . for these simulations , we obtained 830  k for the ferroelectric - to - paraelectric first - order phase transition temperature @xmath77 , shown in figure 4(b ) . </S>",
    "<S> this agrees well with the experimental @xmath77 of 765  k ,  @xcite and is an improvement relative to the 550  k value obtained in @xmath1 calculations with an earlier bv potential without bvvs term .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite we then used the new potential in @xmath2 simulations , with the pressure maintained at 0.1 mpa by the parrinello - rahman barostat .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for the ground state structure at 10  k , we obtained the lattice constant @xmath78=3.834    and @xmath70=1.15 . </S>",

    "<S> @xcite figure 5 displays the temperature dependence of lattice constants , spontaneous polarization and atomic displacements of pb and ti obtained from @xmath2 simulations . as temperature increases , </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath70 ratio decreases gradually , together with the polarization and atomic displacements . </S>",
    "<S> the phase transition from tetragonal to cubic occurs at 400  k , lower than the experimental value . </S>",
    "<S> the rather large magnitude of spontaneous polarization compared to experimental value ( @xmath79 = 1.25  c / m@xmath80 vs. experimental @xmath79 = 0.75  c / m@xmath80 )  @xcite and the large atomic displacements at temperatures below @xmath77 are due to the overestimated tetragonality of the pbesol functional and some amplification of this effect in the resulting potential . </S>",
    "<S> + we find that the new potential is capable of describing domain wall ( dw ) energetics and structures . </S>",
    "<S> the supercell used to model the domain wall is constructed following the method in ref . </S>",

    "<S> the dimensions of the supercell are fixed to the values calculated based on experimental lattice constants of tetragonal pbtio@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the domain wall energy is estimated to be 90 mj / m@xmath91 and also shows a satisfying agreement with the pbesol dft value of 64 mj / m@xmath80 ( with an @xmath87 supercell ) . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the bv potential is highly efficient , as all the interactions are pair - wise . </S>",
    "<S> this allows simulation of a 40@xmath9240@xmath9240 supercell ( 320,000 atoms ) for 40 ps with a 1.0 fs timestep using only 2268 seconds of clocktime with 320 cpus on the ibm idataplex supercomputer at the navy dod supercomputing resource center . </S>",
    "<S> + we have also examined the performance of the potential in simulations of pressure - induced phase transitions in pbtio@xmath0 with a @xmath93 supercell . </S>",
    "<S> figure 7 shows the pressure dependence of lattice constants and polarization . </S>",
    "<S> we find two phase transitions , at 6.5 gpa and 11 gpa . </S>",
    "<S> below 6.5 gpa , the structure is ferroelectric . </S>",
    "<S> the tetragonality decreases with increased pressure and the magnitude of polarization along the long axis reduces accordingly . above 6.5 gpa , </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath70 ratio becomes 1 but the structure maintains ferroelectricity up to 11  gpa . between 6.5  gpa and 11  gpa , we find the coexistence of multiple monoclinic phases . </S>",
    "<S> the polarization disappears when the pressure exceeds 11  gpa and the structure becomes centrosymmetric and paraelectric . </S>",
    "<S> our simulated results are consistent with wu and cohen s first - principles studies  @xcite and recent experimental results by ahart _ </S>",
    "<S> et al_.  @xcite we did not find any reentrance of ferroelectricity up to 60  gpa . </S>",
    "<S> + we have shown that bond - valence energy is formally equivalent to the second - moment bond - order potential . </S>",
    "<S> the introduction of bond - valence vector energy based on the bond - valence vector conservation principle improve the bond - valence model . </S>",
    "<S> the new potential of pbtio@xmath0 reproduces the polarization , ferroelectric instability and phase transition in @xmath1 simulations , and also captures the temperature - driven phase transition qualitatively in @xmath2 simulations . </S>",
    "<S> both calculated 180@xmath86 dw energy and 90@xmath86 dw energy using this new potential are in agreement with dft values . </S>",
    "<S> this new potential is efficient enough to simulate large supercells . </S>",
    "<S> the studies of pressure - induced phase transition with the new potential show two phase transitions , consistent with previous experimental studies . </S>",
    "<S> we expect that this improved bond - valence model can be applied to other oxides due to its simplicity , efficiency and accuracy .  </S>",
