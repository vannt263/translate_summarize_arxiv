    "half - metallic ( hm ) ferromagnetism@xcite is an ideal property of materials from the viewpoint of their application in spintronic devices@xcite .",
    "thus a considerable research has been devoted in recent years to the designing and measurement of the physical properties of such materials .",
    "one group of such materials is known as the dilute magnetic semiconductors ( dms)@xcite , where the magnetic properties are mediated by the percolation effects connecting a very small concentration of transition metal ( tm ) atoms such as mn or cr in a semiconductor host .",
    "another group , that has been studied extensively , consists of tm - semiconductor binary / ternary alloys , where the tm concentration can be as high as the other components@xcite .",
    "in particular , some zb structure transition metal chalcogenides and pnictides have been predicted to be hm ferromagnets on the basis of theoretical calculations@xcite . here",
    "the magnetic properties of the transition metal matrix is modified via the hybridization between the transition metal 3-@xmath2 and the @xmath3 and @xmath4 orbitals of the pinctogen or the chalcogen .",
    "half - metallicity arises as a result of interplay between the exchange splitting and the hybridization . some cr - based chalcogenides and pnictides@xcite ,",
    "have been predicted to be not only hm but also potential candidates for possessing high curie temperatures @xmath5 .",
    "akinaga @xcite have reported growing zb thin films of cras on gaas ( 001 ) substrates via molecular beam epitaxy .",
    "these showed ferromagnetic behavior at temperatures in excess of 400 k and magnetic moments of 3@xmath6 per cras unit .",
    "thin films of crsb grown similarly on gaas , ( al , ga)sb , and gasb substrates have been found to be of zb structure and ferromagnetic with @xmath5 higher than 400 k@xcite .",
    "deng @xcite were successful in increasing the thickness of zb - crsb films to @xmath7 3 nm using ( in , ga)as buffer layers , and li @xcite were able to grow @xmath7 4 nm thick zb - crsb films on nacl ( 100 ) substrates .",
    "two of the present authors have recently presented an extensive theoretical study of the exchange interactions and curie temperatures in a series of cr - based pnictides and chalcogenides in zb structure as a function of the lattice parameter@xcite .",
    "one important issue is that although the zb phase of these compounds shows half - metallicity and often ( the promise of ) high curie temperature , the ground state usually has a different structure . for many of these compounds",
    "the ground state is nias - type hexagonal ( na ) .",
    "the semiconductor substrates on which thin films of these compounds are grown have cubic structures , usually rs or zb . the other point is that often the equilibrium volume does not show half - metallicity , which appears only at an expanded volume . from this stand - point",
    "it would be useful to explore the possibility of the half - metallic phase in structures other than zb , and in particular the rs structure . in this work",
    "we have examined this problem for crte .",
    "zhao and zunger@xcite argued that zb crte should be epitaxially unstable against the na structure .",
    "however , recently sreenivasan @xcite and bi @xcite have reported growing @xmath75 nm thick thin films of zb crte by low temperature molecular beam epitaxy .",
    "their measurements of temperature - dependent remanent - magnetization indicate a curie temperature of @xmath7100 k in these films .",
    "one attractive feature of bulk crte , at least from a theoretical view point , is that the equilibrium volume in the zb structure is already half - metallic , whereas most other cr - based chalcogenides and pnictides show half - metallicity only at expanded volumes@xcite . besides , the half - metallic gap is larger in the chalcogenides like crte or crse than in the pnictides such as cras or crsb",
    "this is due to larger cr - moment in the half - metallic phase for the chalcogenides ( @xmath74@xmath6 ) than for the pnictides ( @xmath73@xmath6 ) , which results in larger exchange splitting .",
    "our previous study@xcite has revealed that chalcogenides such as crs and crse have a high likelihood of exhibiting antiferromagnetic or complex magnetic behavior for a range of the lattice parameter , whereas such tendencies are less pronounced in crte .",
    "hence , the focus of this work is on crte .",
    "we study the appearance of half - metallicity in three competing structures for crte : na , rs and zb .",
    "the ground state structure ( na ) shows half - metallicity not at the equilibrium volume but at some expanded volume , while both rs and zb structures show half - metallicity at their respective equilibrium ( lowest energy ) volumes .",
    "the rs structure is found to be more stable than the zb , with an energy that is lower by 0.25 ev / atom .",
    "some band calculations for crte in the na structure have already appeared@xcite in the literature , and the same goes for zb crte@xcite .",
    "ahmadian @xcite have recently discussed half - metallicity at a zb crte(001 ) surface and its interface with znte(001 ) .",
    "so far crte in the rs structure has not been studied from the viewpoint of its electronic and magnetic properties .",
    "although both rs and zb structures are fcc - based , their magnetic properties should differ somewhat for the same lattice parameter due to different levels of hybridization between the cr 3-@xmath2 and te @xmath8-orbitals .",
    "this should influence the magnetic moments , half - metallic gaps and the exchange interactions .",
    "we find that the exchange interactions are predominantly ferromagnetic and strong in the rs structure , while in the zb structure cr - cr interactions can have non - negligible antiferromagnetic components for some lattice parameters .",
    "this results in a lower curie temperature @xmath5 for the zb structure over a wide range of the lattice parameter .",
    "the promise of lower energy and higher @xmath5 should prompt the experimentalists to try to fabricate crte thin films in the rs structure .",
    "the two fcc - based structures zb ( @xmath9 , no.@xmath10 ) and rs ( @xmath11 , no.@xmath12 ) are well - known .",
    "the na structure(p6@xmath13/mmc , no.@xmath14 ) is based on a distorted hcp array of the arsenide anions .",
    "by contrast with the wurtzite structure , which shares the same formula type ( ab ) with the na structure , the cations occupy all the octahedral sites rather than half the tetrahedral holes .",
    "there is one octahedral hole for each hcp lattice site , and so the ab stoichiometry is preserved . the local co - ordinations of the anions and cations are different in the na and wurtzite structures .",
    "bulk samples of crte are known to crystallize in this structure@xcite with cell parameters @xmath15 , @xmath16@xmath17 at room temperature .",
    "the cr - te bond length is 2.78@xmath17 and the @xmath18 ratio is 1.557 , different from the ideal hcp value of 1.633 .",
    "thus the six te atoms form a trigonally distorted octahedron around cr .",
    "the cr - cr nearest neighbor distance in the @xmath19 plane is @xmath15 , while the out of plane distance is @xmath20 .",
    "readers may consult fig . 1 of ref .",
    "[ ] to view the structure .    for the electronic structure study",
    "we have used the wien@xmath21k code @xcite , which employs the full - potential linear augmented plane waves ( fp - lapw ) plus local orbitals method . the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) proposed by perdew",
    "was used for exchange and correlation potentials@xcite . according to a study by continenza @xcite , gga is essential for obtaining accurate equilibrium volumes and magnetic moments for mn - based pnictides of zb and na structures .",
    "we consider full relativistic effects for the core states and use the scalar approximation for the valence states .",
    "spin - orbit coupling is neglected , as it should have negligible effect on the results for crte .",
    "convergence with respect to basis set and k - point sampling was carefully verified . about @xmath22 k points",
    "were used for the brillouin zone ( bz ) integrations , using the monkhorst - pack scheme@xcite and @xmath23 divisions of the bz .",
    "we used @xmath24 and angular momentum expansion up to @xmath25 in the muffin tins , and @xmath26 for the charge density .",
    "all core and valence states were treated self - consistently .",
    "for the calculations involving the different structures the muffin - tin ( mt ) radii were taken to be equal to @xmath27 and @xmath28 bohrs for cr and te atoms , respectively .",
    "the same mt radii were used in the calculations of different structures at their equilibrium volumes in order to compare accurately the total energies .",
    "self - consistency in charge density was achieved to an accuracy higher than @xmath29 .",
    "we carried out a systematic structural optimization of na , zb , and rs crte in fm , nm and afm configurations .",
    "for the na structure the c / a ratio was optimized and the result @xmath30 for the fm phase is in good agreement with previously obtained result@xcite .",
    "this optimized c / a ratio was used for the final na structure volume optimization .",
    "bulk modulus was calculated by fitting the volume vs. energy results to the empirical murnaghan equation of state@xcite .",
    "we find that for all three structures the fm phase has lower energy than the nm and afm phases . to assess the relative stability of crte in different structures we consider the total energy per formula unit in the zb and rs structures relative to the na structure .",
    "the calculated optimized equilibrium lattice constant a , bulk modulus b , the total energy difference e@xmath31 between the nm and the fm states : @xmath32 , and e@xmath33 between the afm and the fm states : @xmath34 , and the metastability energy @xmath35 , which is the total energy per formula unit relative to the na structure , are given in table[table1 ] .",
    "note that for rs and zb structures , in calculating @xmath36 we have considered the energies of three afm configurations : [ 001],[110 ] and [ 111 ] and considered the lowest of these energies .",
    "for the hexagonal na structure , the afm state was created by simply ascribing equal but opposite magnetic moments to the two cr atoms in the unit cell .",
    "cohesive properties are dependent on the treatment of the exchange - correlation effects in a non - trivial manner , as indicated by the lda values of the lattice parameter and bulk modulus shown in parentheses in table[table1 ] for the rs and zb equilibrium structures , where all other values are from gga . increased correlation effects in gga increases the equilibrium lattice parameter and lowers the bulk modulus .",

    "for the rs structure , the moment on the te atom is small ( around 1 - 2% of that of the cr atom ) for low values of the lattice parameter , while the moment on the two empty spheres are each about 3.5 - 4% of that of the cr atom . with increasing lattice parameter , the te - moment increases with respect to the cr - moment to about 7 - 8% at the highest lattice parameter studied .",
    "at these high lattice parameters the moments on the empty spheres , originating from the tails of the nearby cr-3@xmath2 orbitals , drop to about 2% of the cr - moment .    in the zb structure , the two empty spheres are not equivalent and the induced moments on the empty spheres and the te atoms in this case has been described in detail in our recent publication@xcite . for the zb structure",
    "the induced moment on te is negligible for small lattice parameters , increases steadily with increasing lattice parameter , achieving a maximum value of 4% of the cr - moment at the highest value of the lattice parameter studied .",
    "most often it is less than 1% .",
    "the magnitudes of the induced moments on the empty spheres decrease in the following order : sublattice es-1 ( the sublattice of empty spheres that is at the same distance with respect to the cr - sublattice as the te - sublattice ) , sublattice es-2 ( sublattice of empty spheres further away from the cr - sublattice ) .",
    "the induced moment on es-2 is always small , decreases with increasing lattice parameter from about 2% to about 0.4% of the cr - moment .",
    "the induced moment on es-1 is higher than the other two induced moments for smaller lattice parameters . for larger lattice parameters",
    "it is comparable to the te - moment , but opposite in sign . above a critical value of the lattice parameter , the moment per formula unit ( f.u . )",
    "saturates at a value of 4.0 @xmath6 , as the hm state is achieved , while the local moments on the cr- and te - sublattices increase in magnitude , remaining opposite in sign .",
    "sandratskii @xcite have discussed the problem associated with such induced moments in calculating the curie temperature .",
    "lmto - asa results using lda for the zb and rs structures are presented in fig.[fig8 ] .",
    "magnetism is strongly dependent on correlation effects . even in the metallic states , where magnetism is believed to be described reasonably well by density functional methods and lda , different treatment of the exchange - correlation effects",
    "lead to different values of magnetic moments .",
    "we thus compare the magnetic moments of our lmto - asa calculations for lda and lda+u@xcite .",
    "the enhanced correlation effects in the lda+u calculations ( using u=0.075 ry , j=0 ) increase the values magnetic moments and bring the results in general close agreement with those obtained via using gga in the wie2@xmath37 package .",
    "this is shown in fig.[fig9 ] .",
    "the agreement between gga and lda+u results is due to the fact that the gga goes beyond the lda by including electron correlations in some way .",

    "if the magnetic state is indeed fm , then according to the prescription of sandratskii@xcite @xmath5 should be enhanced with respect to the value given by eq.(4 ) and may be positive but small .",
    "this explains why sreenivasan @xcite and bi @xcite observe @xmath5s only as high as 100 k in their thin film sample of zb crte . for rs crte , on the other hand ,",
    "all dominant interactions are fm , and as a result the @xmath5 calculated by using eq.(4 ) and based on only cr - cr interactions give positive values .",

    "it would transpire from fig.[fig10 ] that a j@xmath57-j@xmath58 model may suffice to describe the magnetism of the rs phase .",
    "however , for quantitative accuracy of @xmath5 the more distant interactions , although individually small compared to the first two , can not be neglected , i.e. their cumulative effect is non - negligible .",
    "note that for the zb phase a j@xmath57-j@xmath58 model would clearly be inadequate .",
    "for the rs phase , if one is prepared to neglect interactions beyond the next nearest neighbor pairs , then the nearest neighbor interaction j@xmath57 and the next nearest interaction j@xmath58 can be obtained from the energies of the fm and afm[001 ] and afm[111 ] states@xcite .",
    "we have calculated j@xmath57 and j@xmath58 using this procedure for the fp - lapw - gga equilibrium lattice parameter of 5.727  , and the results are : j@xmath57=3.76 mev , j@xmath58=27.63 mev ( fp - lapw - gga ) , j@xmath57=3.29 mev , j@xmath58=18.32 mev ( fp - lapw - lda ) , j@xmath57=4.61 mev , j@xmath58=20.0 mev ( lmto - asa - lda ) . to compare these results with those given by the procedure based on the multiple scattering formalism and eq.([eq - jij ] ) we need to consider that all the distant neighbor interactions between the cr atoms ( and the interactions involving the induced moments ) get mapped effectively on to just two interactions in the j@xmath57-j@xmath58 model .",

    "<S> using full - potential linear augmented plane wave method ( fp - lapw ) and the density functional theory , we have carried out a systematic investigation of the electronic , magnetic , and cohesive properties of the chalcogenide crte in three competing structures : rock - salt ( rs ) , zinc blende ( zb ) and the nias - type ( na ) hexagonal . </S>",
    "<S> although the ground state is of na structure , rs and zb are interesting in that these fcc - based structures , which can possibly be grown on many semiconductor substrates , exhibit half - metallic phases above some critical values of the lattice parameter . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the na structure is not half - metallic at its equilibrium volume , while both zb and rs structures are . </S>",
    "<S> the rs structure is more stable than the zb , with an energy that is lower by 0.25 ev / atom . while confirming previous results on the half - metallic phase in zb structure , we provide hitherto unreported results on the half - metallic rs phase , with a gap in the minority channel and a magnetic moment of @xmath0 @xmath1 per formula unit . </S>",
    "<S> a comparison of total energies for the ferromagnetic ( fm ) , non - magnetic ( nm ) , and antiferromagnetic ( afm ) configurations shows the lowest energy configuration to be fm for crte in all the three structures . </S>",
    "<S> the fp - lapw calculations are supplemented by linear muffin - tin orbital ( lmto ) calculations using both local density approximation ( lda ) and lda+u method . </S>",
    "<S> the exchange interactions and the curie temperatures calculated via the linear response method in zb and rs crte are compared over a wide range of the lattice parameter . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated curie temperatures for the rs phase are consistently higher than those for the zb phase . </S>"
