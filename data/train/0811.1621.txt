    "quantum error correcting codes are a central weapon in the battle to overcome the effects of environmental noise associated with attempts to control quantum mechanical systems as they evolve in time @xcite .",
    "it is thus important to develop techniques that assist in determining whether one code is better than another for a given noise model . in this paper",
    "we make a contribution to this study by introducing a notion of entropy for quantum error correcting codes .",
    "no single quantity can be expected to hold all information on a code , its entropy included .",
    "nevertheless , the entropy of a code is one way in which the amount of effort required to recover a code can be quantified . in the extremal case ,",
    "a code has zero entropy if and only if it can be recovered with a single unitary operation .",
    "this is the simplest of all correction operations in that a measurement is not required as part of the correction process .",
    "these codes have been recently coined _ unitarily correctable _",
    "@xcite , and include _ decoherence - free subspaces _",
    "@xcite in the case that recovery is the trivial identity operation .",
    "thus more generally the entropy can be regarded as a measure of how close a code is to being unitarily correctable , or decoherence - free in some cases .    in the next section",
    "we introduce the entropy of a code , along with required nomenclature .",
    "we also consider an example motivated by the stabilizer formalism @xcite and discuss an extension of code entropy to operator quantum error correcting subsystem codes @xcite .",
    "we then consider in detail an illustrative class of quantum operations for which the code structure has recently been characterised , the class of _ binary unitary channels _ @xcite .",
    "let @xmath0 denote a quantum state : a hermitian , positive operator , satisfying the trace normalisation condition tr@xmath1 . a linear quantum operation ( or channel ) @xmath2 , which sends a density operator @xmath0 of size @xmath3 into its image @xmath4 of the same size may be described in the choi - kraus form @xcite @xmath5 the kraus operators @xmath6 can be chosen to be orthogonal @xmath7 , so that the non - negative weights @xmath8 become eigenvalues of the dynamical ( choi ) matrix , @xmath9 .",
    "we refer to the rank of the choi matrix as the _ choi rank _ of @xmath2 .",
    "observe that the choi rank of @xmath2 is equal to the minimal number of kraus operators required to describe @xmath2 as in ( [ kraus ] ) .",
    "hence in the canonical form the number @xmath10 of non - zero kraus operators does not exceed @xmath11 . due to the theorem of choi the map",
    "@xmath2 is completely positive ( cp ) if and only if the corresponding dynamical matrix is positive if and only if @xmath2 has a form as in ( [ kraus ] ) .",
    "the map @xmath2 is _ trace preserving _",
    ", @xmath12 , if and only if @xmath13 where we assume some @xmath14 are zero if @xmath10 is less than @xmath15 .",
    "the family of operators @xmath6 is not unique .",
    "however , if @xmath16 is another family of operators that determine @xmath2 as in ( [ kraus ] ) , then there is a scalar unitary matrix @xmath17 such that @xmath18 for all @xmath19 .",
    "we refer to this as the _ unitary invariance _ of choi - kraus decompositions .",
    "to characterise the information missing in a quantum state one uses its _ von neumann _ entropy , @xmath20 we will use the convention that @xmath21 refers to logarithm base two as this provides a cleaner operational qubit definition in the context of quantum information .    in order to describe the action of a cp map @xmath2 , represented in the canonical choi - kraus form ( [ kraus ] ) , for an initial state @xmath0 we may compare its entropy with the entropy of the image @xmath22 . to obtain a bound for such an entropy change we can define an operator @xmath23 acting on an extended hilbert space @xmath24 , @xmath25 if the map @xmath2 is stochastic , the operator @xmath26 is positive definite and normalised so it represents a density operator in its own right , @xmath27 ( specifically , it is an initially pure environment evolved by the unitary dilation of @xmath2 ) .",
    "observe that for any unitary map , @xmath28 , the form ( [ kraus ] ) consists of a single term only .",
    "hence in this case the operator @xmath26 reduces to a single number equal to unity and its entropy vanishes , @xmath29 .",
    "the auxiliary state @xmath26 acting in an extended hilbert space was used by lindblad to derive bounds for the entropy of an image @xmath30 of any initial state .",
    "the bounds of lindblad @xcite , @xmath31 are obtained by defining another density matrix in the composite hilbert space @xmath32 , @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 forms an orthonormal basis in @xmath36 .",
    "thus , @xmath37 is simply the system and an initially pure environment evolved by the unitary dilation of @xmath2 .",
    "computing partial traces one finds that tr@xmath38 and tr@xmath39 .",
    "it is possible to verify that @xmath40 , so making use of the subadditivity of entropy and the triangle inequality @xcite one arrives at ( [ boundent ] ) .",
    "if the initial state is pure , that is if @xmath41 , we find from ( [ boundent ] ) that the final state @xmath4 has entropy @xmath42 . for this reason @xmath42",
    "was called the _ entropy exchange _ of the operation by shumacher @xcite . in that work",
    "an alternative formula for the entropy exchange was proven , @xmath43 where @xmath44 is an _",
    "arbitrary _ purification of the mixed state , tr@xmath45 .",
    "thus , the entropy exchange is invariant under purification of the initial state and remains a function only of the initial density operator @xmath0 and the map @xmath2 .      a quantum operation @xmath2 allows for an error correction scheme in the standard framework for quantum error correction @xcite if there exists a subspace @xmath46 such that for some set of complex scalars @xmath47 the corresponding projection operator @xmath48 satisfies @xmath49 specifically , this is equivalent to the existence of a quantum _ recovery operation _ @xmath50 such that @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the map @xmath53 .",
    "the subspace related to @xmath48 determines a _ quantum error correcting code _ ( qecc ) for the map @xmath2 .",
    "a special class of codes are the _ unitarily correctable codes _ ( ucc ) , which are characterised by the existence of a unitary recovery operation @xmath54 .",
    "these codes include _ decoherence - free subspaces _ ( dfs ) in the case that @xmath50 is the identity map , @xmath55 .",
    "it can be shown that the matrix @xmath56 is hermitian and positive , and is in fact a density matrix , so it can be considered as an auxiliary state acting in an extended hilbert space of size at most @xmath11 .",
    "it is easy to obtain a more refined global upper bound on the rank of @xmath57 in terms of the map @xmath2 .",
    "[ upperbound ]",
    "let @xmath57 be the matrix determined by a code @xmath58 for a quantum map @xmath2 .",
    "then the rank of @xmath57 is bounded above by the choi rank of @xmath2 .",
    "* proof . * without loss of generality assume the choi matrix @xmath59 is diagonal .",
    "we have for all @xmath19 , @xmath60 and the result follows from the positivity of @xmath59 and @xmath57 .    ' '' ''",
    "unitarily correctable codes are typically highly _ degenerate _ codes , as the map @xmath2 collapses to a single unitary operation when restricted to the code subspace .",
    "in particular , the unitary invariance of choi - kraus representations implies the restricted operators @xmath61 are all scalar multiples of a single unitary .",
    "more generally , one can see that a code @xmath62 is degenerate for @xmath2 precisely when the choi rank of @xmath2 is strictly greater than the rank of @xmath57 .",
    "indeed , the choi rank counts the minimal number of kraus operators required to implement @xmath2 via ( 2.1 ) , and satisfaction of this strict inequality means there is redundancy in the description of @xmath63 by the operators @xmath64 . thus , for these reasons we shall refer to codes as _ non - degenerate _ if the choi rank of @xmath2 coincides with the rank of @xmath57 and if the spectrum of @xmath57 is equally balanced  that is to say that non - degenerate codes correspond to the maximally degenerate error correction matrix , @xmath57 proportional to the identity matrix      assume now that an error correcting code @xmath46 exists and all conditions ( [ compression ] ) are satisfied .",
    "if a quantum state @xmath0 is supported on the code then @xmath65 and calculation of the entropy exchange ( [ osigma ] ) simplifies , @xmath66 in this way we have shown that the error correction matrix @xmath57 is _ equal _ to the auxiliary matrix @xmath26 of lindblad , provided the initial state belongs to the code subspace .    from another direction ,",
    "given an error correcting code @xmath67 for a map @xmath2 , in @xcite it was shown that there is a quantum state @xmath68 and an isometry @xmath69 such that for all @xmath70 , @xmath71 the result , which can be seen as a consequence of the decoupling condition of @xcite , gives an explicit way to `` see '' a code at the output stage of a quantum process for which the code is correctable . the result ( and its subsystem generalization ",
    "see below ) may also be viewed as a formalisation of the _ subsystem principle _ for preserving quantum information @xcite . from the proof of this result",
    "one can see directly that the entropy of @xmath68 satisfies @xmath72 .",
    "this equality follows also from the fact that @xmath68 and @xmath57 can be interpreted as the states obtained by partial trace of an initially pure state with respect to two different subsystems .",
    "thus , from multiple perspectives we find motivation for the following :    [ entdefn ] given a quantum operation @xmath2 with kraus operators @xmath73 and a code @xmath67 with matrix @xmath57 given by ( [ compression ] ) , we call the von neumann entropy @xmath74 the _ entropy of _",
    "@xmath75 _ relative to _ @xmath2 .",
    "the entropy of a code depends only on the map and the subspace defined by @xmath76 , not on any particular state in the code subspace .",
    "thus , the entropy exchange will be the same for all initial states supported on the code subspace and is therefore a property of the code itself .    in the following result",
    "we determine what possible values the code entropy can take , and we derive a characterisation of the extremal cases in terms of both the code and the map .",
    "[ ucccase ] let @xmath2 be a quantum operation and let @xmath77 be a code with matrix @xmath57 given by ( [ compression ] ) .",
    "then @xmath78 belongs to the closed interval @xmath79 $ ] , where @xmath80 is the choi rank of @xmath2 .",
    "furthermore , the extremal cases are characterised as follows :    * @xmath81 if and only if @xmath77 is a unitarily correctable code for @xmath2 . *",
    "@xmath82 if and only if @xmath83 is a non - degenerate code for @xmath2 .",
    "* by lemma  [ upperbound ] and the subsequent discussion , the maximal entropy case occurs when the rank of @xmath57 and @xmath59 coincide and the spectrum of @xmath57 is equally balanced ; that is , the code is non - degenerate .",
    "this occurs ( by a standard spectral majorization argument ) precisely when the code entropy satisfies @xmath82 .    for the minimal entropy case",
    ", first suppose that @xmath67 is a ucc for @xmath2 .",
    "then by ( [ superoperator ] ) there is a unitary operation @xmath84 such that @xmath85 .",
    "thus by the unitary invariance of choi - kraus decompositions , it follows that @xmath86 for some scalars @xmath87 .",
    "hence we have @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is the vector state with coordinates @xmath87 , and so @xmath90 .",
    "on the other hand , suppose @xmath91 is rank one .",
    "let @xmath69 be a scalar unitary that diagonalises @xmath57 .",
    "it follows that @xmath69 induces a unitary change of representation for @xmath2 via ( [ compression ] ) from @xmath92 to @xmath16 .",
    "but since @xmath93 is diagonal , only one @xmath94 , say @xmath95 , is non - zero , and hence by unitary invariance we have @xmath96 for some unitary @xmath97 .",
    "thus @xmath98 , and the result follows .    ' '' ''    from an operational perspective , the numerical value of the entropy of a code allows us to quantify the number of ancilla qubits needed to perform a recovery operation .",
    "specifically , the choi rank , @xmath80 , of a map @xmath2 gives the minimum number of kraus operators necessary to describe the map or , by stinespring s dilation theorem  @xcite , the dimension of the ancilla required to implement @xmath2 as a unitary .",
    "the rank of @xmath57 then gives the number of kraus operators necessary to describe the action of the map restricted to @xmath99 and thus the number of kraus operators , @xmath10 , necessary for a recovery operation in the usual measurement cum reversal picture of recovery .",
    "again by stinespring s dilation theorem we need an @xmath10-dimensional ancilla to implement the recovery as a unitary , and thus this requires @xmath100 qubits .",
    "hence the entropy is equal to zero for a unitarily correctable code , in which the action of the noise is unitary and thus requires no ancilla to implement the recovery operation .",
    "if the code entropy is positive , then any state of the code can potentially evolve to any one of multiple locations in the system hilbert space under the action of the noise @xmath2 .",
    "this fact has to be compensated by the recovery operation @xmath50 .",
    "the maximal entropy case for a particular @xmath2 is characterised by evolution to each of these locations ( @xmath101 by lemma  [ upperbound ] ) with equal probability ( by theorem  [ ucccase ] ) . here the entropy and thus the number of qubits in the ancilla will be @xmath102 .",
    "as an example from the stabilizer formalism , consider a three - qubit system with the usual notation @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 , for pauli operators @xcite .",
    "the single - qubit stabilizer code with generators @xmath106 , is spanned by @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "the set of operators @xmath109 form a correctable set of errors for this stabilizer thus we can consider a channel , a three - qubit bit - flip channel , comprised of these operators  for example , the channel with kraus operators @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "using @xmath114 ,  ( [ compression ] ) tells us that the error correction matrix is @xmath115 the entropy of this code is therefore @xmath116 as we would expect , the minimum entropy is achieved when @xmath117 .",
    "the maximum entropy occurs when , which we might also expect since this puts the auxiliary density matrix @xmath57 into the maximally mixed state . here , the choi rank of our map is @xmath118 as is the rank of @xmath57 , and the spectrum of @xmath57 is equally balanced .",
    "so @xmath99 is non - degenerate for @xmath2 .",
    "further , as we expect from theorem  [ ucccase ] , the entropy is . since the rank of @xmath57 is the number of kraus operators required for a recovery operation we find that in order to dilate the recovery operation to a unitary process , we need a @xmath118-dimensional space , or equivalently a @xmath119-qubit ancilla , which matches the value of the entropy .",
    "we next consider a variant of this noise model , in which the third qubit undergoes no error and the first and second qubits are flipped with probability equal to that of no error .",
    "thus the map @xmath2 has noise operators @xmath120 , each weighted by @xmath121 .",
    "the entropies for a trio of correctable codes for @xmath2 are given in table  [ enttable ] ( vectors are assumed to be normalised ) .",
    "the first code is non - degenerate , and thus yields the maximal entropy for this noise model .",
    "the second code has positive entropy less than the maximum since it is partially degenerate for @xmath2 .",
    "indeed , one can check that @xmath122 ( and @xmath123 ) act trivially on the code , whereas @xmath124 maps the code to an orthogonal subspace .",
    "the final code shows zero entropy since it is fully degenerate for @xmath2 .",
    "in fact , as can be directly verified it is a decoherence - free subspace for @xmath2 .",
    ".codes for the noise model @xmath125 . [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      we next consider an extension of code entropy to the case of operator quantum error correcting subsystem codes .",
    "we shall only introduce this notion here and leave a potential further investigation for elsewhere .",
    "subsystem codes were formally introduced under the umbrella of _ operator quantum error correction _",
    "@xcite , a framework that unifies the active and passive approaches to quantum error correction .",
    "these codes now play a central role in fault tolerant quantum computing .",
    "let @xmath126 be a hilbert space of finite dimension @xmath3 .",
    "any decomposition @xmath127 determines subsystems @xmath128 and @xmath129 of @xmath126 .",
    "given a quantum operation @xmath2 acting on @xmath126 , we say that a subsystem @xmath129 of @xmath126 is _ correctable _ for @xmath2 if there exists maps @xmath50 on @xmath126 and @xmath130 on @xmath128 such that @xmath131 where @xmath132 and @xmath133 is the projection onto the subspace @xmath134 .",
    "subsystem codes generalize standard ( subspace ) codes ( [ superoperator ] ) in the sense that subspaces may be regarded as subsystems with trivial ancilla ( @xmath135 ) .",
    "thus , it is natural to suggest that a notion of entropy for subsystem codes should generalize the subspace definition .",
    "we find motivation for such a notion through the main result of @xcite alluded to above . to every correctable subsystem for @xmath2",
    ", there are subsystems @xmath136 and @xmath137 , a map @xmath138 from @xmath128 to @xmath136 and a unitary map @xmath139 from @xmath129 to @xmath140 such that @xmath141    recall that the _ maximal output entropy _ of a channel @xmath50 is given by @xmath142 .",
    "this motivates the following .",
    "let @xmath2 be a quantum operation with correctable subsystem @xmath129 that satisfies ( [ subsystemcode ] ) .",
    "then we define the entropy of @xmath129 relative to @xmath2 as the maximal output entropy of the associated ancilla channel , @xmath143 from ( [ ksresult ] ) .",
    "observe that this generalizes definition  [ entdefn ] , since a density operator may be regarded as a channel from a one - dimensional input space .",
    "the minimal entropy case is characterized by the ancilla channel @xmath138 having range supported on a one - dimensional subspace .",
    "such codes are unitarily correctable , in fact as subspaces , but the converse is not true . instead , in the more general subsystem setting",
    ", the minimal entropy case is described by the associated ancilla subsystem @xmath128 undergoing `` cooling '' to a fixed state . in principle one",
    "should be able to conduct a deeper analysis of subsystem code entropy .",
    "we leave this as an open investigation for elsewhere .",

    "it is clear that the problem of finding an error correcting code subspace @xmath46 for the above map is equivalent to the case @xmath149 where @xmath150 .",
    "the number @xmath10 of kraus operators is equal to @xmath119 , with @xmath151 and @xmath152 .",

    "for instance , any channel ( [ biunitary2 ] ) acting on a two qubit system and described by unitary matrix @xmath150 of size @xmath118 may be characterized by the radius @xmath213 of the point in which two diagonals of the quadrangle of the spectrum cross .",
    "the larger @xmath173 , the smaller entropy @xmath214 , and the closer the error correction code is to a decoherence - free space .",
    "the code entropy can be also used to classify codes designed for a binary unitary channel acting on larger systems .",
    "for instance in the case of two qutrits , @xmath215 , one can find a subspace supported on @xmath169 dimensional subspace .",
    "the solution is by far not unique and can be parametrized by complex numbers @xmath154 belonging to an intersection of @xmath216 triangles , which forms a convex set of a positive measure . from this set",
    "one can thus select a concrete solution providing a code @xmath46 , such that @xmath213 is the largest , which implies that the code entropy , @xmath214 , is the smallest ",
    "see figure  1.c .",
    "such an error correction code is distinguished by being as close to a decoherence - free subspace as possible .",
    "we have investigated a notion of entropy for quantum error correcting codes and quantum operations .",
    "the entropy has multiple natural realisations through fundamental results in the theory of quantum error correction .",
    "we showed how the extremal cases are characterised by unitarily correctable codes and decoherence - free subspaces on the one hand , and the non - degenerate case determined by the choi matrix of the map on the other .",
    "we considered examples from the stabilizer formalism , and conducted a detailed analysis in the illustrative case of binary unitary channels .",
    "recently developed techniques on higher - rank numerical ranges were used to give a complete geometrical description of code entropies for binary unitary channels ; in particular , the structure of these subsets of the complex plane can be used to visually determine how close a code is to a decoherence - free subspace .",
    "we also introduced an extension of code entropy to subsystem codes , and left a deeper investigation of this notion for elsewhere .",
    "it could be interesting to explore further applications of the code entropy in quantum error correction .",
    "for instance , although quantum error correction codes were originally designed for models of discrete time evolution in the form of a quantum operation , generalizations to the case of continuous evolution in time @xcite have been investigated .",
    "further , we have investigated perfect correction codes only , for which the error recovery operation brings the quantum state corrupted by the noise back to the initial state with fidelity equal one .",
    "such perfect correction codes may be treated as a special case of more general approximate error correction codes @xcite .",
    "another recent investigation @xcite includes analysis that suggests the measurement component of recovery may prove to be problematic in quantum error correction , and hence may motivate further investigation of unitarily correctable codes .",
