    "the _ wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe _ satellite ( wmap ) has provided the clearest view of the primordial universe to date .",
    "its unprecedented high sensitivity and spatial resolution resulted in a unique set of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation maps with close to full sky coverage and uniformly high quality . as a result , fundamental cosmological parameters can be constrained to the highest precision ever .",
    "thorough analysis of this dataset @xcite yielded a cosmic variance limited measurement of the angular power spectrum , @xmath0 s , of the cmb temperature anisotropy for multipoles @xmath20 ( @xcite ; hereafter h03 ) .",
    "this confirmed and improved measurements from previous experiments ( @xcite ) . the acoustic peak structure revealed by the wmap temperature and polarization power spectra provided strong observational support to inflation and",
    "constrained viable cosmological scenarios to the domain of flat models and its close variants .",
    "considering the importance of these results , our principal aim is to estimate the angular power spectrum in a completely independent way in the full range of multipoles probed by wmap , @xmath21 , and systematically compare results to h03 .",
    "our @xmath9 estimation pipeline is based on spice ( spatially inhomogeneous correlator estimator ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a quadratic estimator based on correlation functions .",
    "spice performs edge corrections and heuristic minimum variance weighting in pixel s is master @xcite . ] space to produce nearly optimal results .",
    "our fast healpix implementation of spice scales as @xmath22 ( @xmath23 is number of pixels ) .",
    "our estimation methodology closely follows that of h03 , but adapted to our technique :    _ step 1 : _ we use the _ foreground cleaned intensity maps _ for the 3 highest frequency bands q , v & w downloaded from the lambda website .",
    "strong diffuse galactic emission and resolved point sources are masked out using the kp0 and kp2 masks , that leaves @xmath24 and @xmath25 of the sky useful for cosmological analyses , respectively .",
    "monopole @xmath26 and dipole @xmath27 terms are also removed from non - masked pixels .",
    "_ step 2 : _ power - spectrum estimation is performed via spice : we compute the cross - correlations from 28 different pairs of channels constructed from the 8 `` differencing assemblies '' ( das ) q1 through w4 .",
    "noise correlation among different channels is negligible , therefore our cross - power estimator is unbiased with respect to the noise ( see h03 ) . like h03",
    ", we implement an heuristic @xmath3-dependent pixel noise weighting scheme that minimizes errors : we use flat weights ( mask weight only ) for @xmath28 , inverse pixel noise variance for @xmath29 , and a transitional inverse rms noise weight in the intermediate range @xmath30 .",
    "_ step 3 : _ a model for the power spectrum for unresolved extragalactic radio sources is subtracted from the cross - power spectrum of each channel .",
    "we implement the model given in  3.1 of h03 .",
    "_ step 4 : _",
    "@xmath0 s from different channels are optimally combined using an inverse noise weighting , with da sensitivities as described in the lambda website .",
    "all channels are included , except for those in q - band that are only used in the intermediate @xmath3-range .",
    "this helps minimizing galactic contamination at low @xmath3 and the window function cut - off at the highest multipoles .",
    "_ step 5 : _ our quadratic estimator is defined in pixel space , where mask effects can be easily corrected for ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "the two point correlation function is then transformed into harmonic space via gauss - legendre quadrature to obtain the @xmath9 s deconvolved from the window function of the experiment .",
    "symmetrized non - gaussian beam transfer profiles @xcite and pixel window functions are corrected for in @xmath3-space .",
    "figure  [ fig : cls ] shows the angular power spectrum of wmap , @xmath31 , in @xmath32k@xmath33 units , measured with spice .",
    "upper panel shows the power spectrum for individual multipoles , using kp2 sky cut .",
    "our measurement ( red line ) is in excellent agreement with h03 ( black line ) , multipole by multipole . in particular , for the quadrupole and octopole we find @xmath34k@xmath33 and @xmath35k@xmath33 , respectively ( h03 get @xmath36k@xmath33 and @xmath37k@xmath33 ) . for the highest @xmath38 s we find slightly different amplitudes than h03 , but consistent at the 1-@xmath8 level .    for the most part , we observe no systematic dependence of the measured @xmath9 s on the sky cut ( see difference between red and blue lines in bottom panel of figure  [ fig : cls ] ) .",
    "however , using kp0 instead of kp2 yields a @xmath39 lower amplitude of the octopole @xmath40 and a @xmath41 smaller amplitudes for the 3 highest band - powers centered at @xmath42 .",
    "this effect might be due to imperfect foreground removal and/or the intrinsic estimator variance due to finite volume and edge effects .",
    "we estimated the dispersion in a set of wmap simulations with kp0 & kp2 sky cuts to be of the same order as the measured differences in the @xmath9 s of the data . on the other hand ,",
    "the cross - correlation amplitude between the clean wmap maps and the best fit foreground templates is at the 5% and 10% level of the wmap @xmath9 s for the lowest and highest @xmath3 s , respectively .",
    "we thus conclude that sample variance due to sky coverage can account for most of the observed difference in the @xmath0 s , while residual foreground contamination is always subdominant .",
    "the low level of systematics in kp2 , and the increased statistical errors due to the decreased sky fraction left by kp0 , motivate us to adopt kp2 ( as in h03 ) for the best estimate of the @xmath9 s .",
    "in order to estimate the covariance of our @xmath0 s , we generated mc simulations of the cmb sky and instrument noise for each of the 8 da s ( q1 through w4 ) .",
    "we used the _ running index _",
    "model that best fits a combination of wmap , cbi & acbar data ( denoted _ wmapext _ in @xcite ) .",
    "maps were convolved with the symmetric ( non - gaussian ) beam transfer function for each da @xcite . as for the noise simulations , we downloaded 100 sky maps per da from the lambda website .",
    "these simulate 1 full year of flight instrument noise and they include all known radiometric effects @xcite .",
    "simulations were analyzed in exactly the same way as the data ( see  [ sec : ps ] ) .",
    "all in all , we have constrained the errors from @xmath43 measurements in mc simulations ( combining cross spectra using 100 mc s for each of the 6 highest frequency da s v1 through w4 ) for the multipole ranges @xmath28 and @xmath29 , and @xmath44 measurements ( combining cross - spectra using 100 mc s from each of the 8 da s q1 through w4 ) for the intermediate @xmath3-range @xmath30 .    for multipoles",
    "@xmath45 , errors in the wmap power spectrum are dominated by cosmic or sample variance ( see h03 ) and the noise only contributes at the few percent level .",
    "figure  [ fig : lowlerr ] displays the noise contribution to the relative errors at low multipoles , @xmath46 .",
    "correlated noise simulation results are displayed ( smooth solid line ) along with results from uncorrelated noise simulations ( dashed line ) .",
    "the latter tends to underestimate errors by @xmath47 .",
    "alternatively the noise level can be estimated from the data rms dispersion among the wmap channels used ( oscillating solid line ) .",
    "these results are in excellent agreement with h03 ( cf .",
    "lower panel in their figure  4 ) .    at higher @xmath3 s pixel noise and systematic effects ( beam and mode coupling , residual foregrounds ) increasingly dominate the errors .",
    "mc methods assume detailed knowledge of all such effects . to provide a model independent check of the errors ,",
    "we introduce a novel technique that allows estimating errors directly from the data : the _ intra - bin variance _ ( ibv ) method .",
    "ibv estimates the variance of a given @xmath9 from the rms dispersion in a bin @xmath48 centered on @xmath3 .",
    "the bin - width @xmath49 is a matter of practical consideration , balancing variance and bias .",
    "more precisely , our estimator for @xmath50 reads @xmath51 where @xmath52 @xmath53 , @xmath54 is the mean of the measured @xmath9 s over channels , and @xmath55 is our best guess for the data mean using a theoretical model .",
    "the latter is subtracted to decrease the bias due to the slope of the angular power spectrum .",
    "we used @xmath55 from the wmap best - fit _ running index _ model @xcite , although this is not critical : no baseline subtraction only biases at a few percent level . by construction , ibv should not be used to obtain errors with high resolution but to assess the overall level of errors in a range of @xmath3 s , typically larger than @xmath56 .",
    "figure  [ fig : ibcal ] shows the ratio between the _ mean _ ibv rms dispersion to the usual mc rms dispersion , both estimated from @xmath57 wmap simulations of cmb signal and correlated noise .",
    "narrow bins yield slightly biased ( under-)estimates of the mc error at few percent level , possibly due to small mode - to - mode couplings .",
    "ibv method with @xmath58 yields unbiased estimates of the error for wmap simulations at the 1% level for @xmath5 .",
    "doubling @xmath56 introduces a slight high bias and significant edge effects for low @xmath3 s that could be caused by the residual slope of the @xmath9 s .",
    "the unbiased bin - width , @xmath58 , with @xmath39 variance is our choice for the wmap error estimation .",
    "figure  [ fig : ibdata ] displays the wmap data diagonal errorbars computed with the ibv method ( spiky solid line ) compared to the previously published diagonal errors ( @xcite,@xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "the largest ibv errors appear to correlate well with the outliers of the data @xmath9 s with respect to the best - fit model ( see figure  3 in @xcite ) , suggesting that our ibv estimator is closely related to a diagonal @xmath59 test .",
    "it is clear that the mean overall error is higher than originally estimated ( otherwise the ibv curve would fluctuate around unity ) .",
    "the simplest and most conservative interpretation of our results yields a monotonic error increase with respect to the wmap team diagonal errors of the form , @xmath60 for @xmath61 ( straight solid line in figure  [ fig : ibdata ] ) .",
    "this smooth prediction results from a least squares minimization to the ibv curve ( large amplitude oscillating line in figure  [ fig : ibdata ] ) . note that for @xmath29 , the error excess is consistent with the errors estimated from mc simulations with _ correlated _ instrument noise ( see noisy line in figure  [ fig : ibdata ] growing from left to right ) .    in the range",
    "@xmath7 the mean error level is incompatible with both mc simulations that include correlated noise and the wmap team published errors : given that there are approximately 16 independent @xmath62 bins , with an intrinsic 15 % error each , and that the mean error excess is 9 % in this @xmath3-range , this amounts to a 2.4 @xmath8 detection of the error excess .",
    "we have checked that using the @xmath9 s measured by @xcite yields comparable ibv errors in this multipole range .",
    "the excellent @xmath3-by-@xmath3 agreement between the spice and wmap team s measurement of the @xmath9 s ( see figure  [ fig : cls ] ) indicates that both estimators window functions are virtually identical in this regime , and thus the observed error excess points to systematics unaccounted for in the wmap team analyses . for @xmath29",
    "the interpretation is less clear as there are hints that both window functions might be slightly different ( see lower panel in figure  [ fig : cls ] ) .",
    "such differences might arise in the practical implementation of the estimators .",
    "we also estimate a @xmath63 correlated noise contribution at @xmath64 ( see figure  [ fig : lowlerr ] ) , that was neglected in previous likelihood analyses .",
    "a more robust assessment of errors is provided below using the full @xmath59 test , where off - diagonal terms are also taken into account following eq.(15 ) in @xcite .",
    "we investigate the implications of our measurements using a bayesian analysis of cosmological parameter estimation .",
    "we use cosmomc , a markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) implementation @xcite based on camb ( @xcite ; see also cmbfast , @xcite ) . in order to allow direct comparison with @xcite , we focus on the simplest 6-parameter cosmological model consistent with the wmap temperature and cross - polarization data .",
    "following @xcite , we assume a set of flat models with radiation , baryons , cold dark matter and cosmological constant .",
    "primordial fluctuations are taken to be adiabatic and gaussian with a power - law power spectrum .",
    "we use the physical dark matter @xmath65 and baryon @xmath66 densities , the reionization optical depth @xmath67 , the scalar spectral index @xmath68 , the normalized hubble constant @xmath69 , and the dark matter power spectrum normalization @xmath70 @xcite .",
    "we estimate paramaters by combining 4 independent chains with 30000 accepted points each , and use the 6 paramater covariance matrix as proposal density from precomputed runs .",
    "this yields an excellent convergence - mixing gelman & rubin statistic @xmath71 for all cases studied .",
