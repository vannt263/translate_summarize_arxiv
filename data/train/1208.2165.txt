    "one of the most interesting problems in particle physics is the confinement of quarks in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "there are various frameworks to solve this difficult problem .",
    "one is the dual superconductor picture proposed by nambu , t hooft , mandelstam , and others in the 1970s . which is based on the existence of magnetic monopoles in qcd and their condensations @xcite .",
    "monopole condensation can explain the confinement via the dual meissner effect .",
    "indeed , one can easily argue that the dual meissner effect guarantees the confinement as a consequence of monopole condensation .",
    "however there has not been a satisfactory proof for monopole condensation in qcd , yet .    if the dual superconductivity is considered as a promising mechanism for describing quark confinement , the existence of magnetic monopoles should be confirmed .",
    "the quantum theory of the magnetic monopole , initially proposed by dirac @xcite , has played a very important role in qed .",
    "dirac showed that the existence of magnetic monopoles leads to the quantization of electric charges . in the meantime",
    ", it was discovered that magnetic monopoles would occur naturally in non - abelian models like the georgi - glashow model but without the difficulties of the dirac magnetic monopoles . in this model",
    "the non - abelian local symmetry is broken into an electromagnetic @xmath5 symmetry by the higgs mechanism @xcite .",
    "these magnetic monopoles called t hooft - polyakov monopoles , are topological solitons which are massive and can not become superconducting in order to explain confinement . on the other hand , in the pure yang - mills theory",
    "no matter fields exist . in the absence of matter fields",
    ", two popular methods have been introduced to extract magnetic monopole degrees of freedom in the yang - mills theory .",
    "one is the abelian projection , which is a partial gauge fixing proposed by t hooft @xcite .",
    "the second is a field decomposition method where new variables are introduced by cho , faddeev and niemi @xcite .",
    "the first method leads to abelian dominance @xcite and magnetic monopole dominance @xcite in the maximal abelian gauge @xcite .",
    "the second method enables one to establish the dual superconductivity in yang - mills theory . by applying the second method ,",
    "one is able to extract the abelian part of the theory that confines the quark .    in this paper",
    "we use the field decomposition method proposed by cho in his paper @xcite . in this method , an extra symmetry called magnetic",
    "symmetry decreases the dynamical degrees of freedom .",
    "it restricts the original gauge theory and makes it abelian .",
    "in fact , the original @xmath0 gauge field is decomposed to two fields , electric and magnetic , and the lagrangian is rewritten based on these two new fields .",
    "although the two potentials appear in a symmetric way in the lagrangian , there still exists a significant disparity between them . while the electric potential is regular , the magnetic one is singular and it contains a string singularity . in addition , the magnetic potential that describes monopoles is a `` spacelike '' potential while the electric one describes isocharges with a `` timelike '' potential .",
    "cho tried to solve these apparent asymmetries by introducing the concept of the dual magnetic potentials .",
    "but it leads to some singularities in both electric and magnetic potentials .",
    "we remove these singularities to obtain a local lagrangian with regular electric and magnetic potentials by applying zwanziger formalism @xcite to the cho lagrangian . as a result",
    ", we obtain a dual of ginsburg - landau lagrangian , which can describe quark confinement . using this lagrangian",
    ", we calculate the potential in a static quark - antiquark pair in two different limits : @xmath2 and @xmath1 , where @xmath3 is the mass of the dual gauge boson and @xmath4 is the distance between quarks .",
    "the limit @xmath2 has already been discussed with different approaches @xcite .    in the next section ,",
    "we briefly review the cho decomposition method as a restricted gauge theory . in sec .",
    "iii , we apply zwanziger formalism and improve the cho lagrangian to a dual ginsburg - landau lagrangian in the framework of a dual - superconductor picture . in sec .",
    "iv , the coulombic and the linear parts of the potential are obtained by calculating the propagator from the lagrangian in two different limits .",
    "finally , the conclusion and summary are given in sec . v.",
    "in cho formalism , an extra symmetry called magnetic symmetry is applied to the theory by a unit vector field @xmath6 in the adjoint representation @xmath7 where @xmath8 is an @xmath0 gauge potential .",
    "equation ( 1 ) can be solved exactly for @xmath8 @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the abelian part of @xmath8 that is not restricted by eq .",
    "the unrestricted part @xmath10 is called the electric potential and the other part , which is restricted , is called the magnetic potential .    using @xmath8 of eq . ( 2 ) , one can easily show that the field strength is decomposed to two parts @xmath11 and @xmath12    @xmath13    where @xmath14 equation ( 3 ) shows that @xmath15 is parallel to @xmath6 , and it is made of two parts : @xmath11 , which comes from the unrestricted potential @xmath10 , and @xmath12 , which comes from the restricted part which contains @xmath6 .",
    "it is natural to call @xmath11 the electric strength and @xmath12 the magnetic strength .",
    "it is possible to associate a magnetic potential @xmath16 to the field strength @xmath12 by choosing a hedgehog configuration for @xmath6 @xmath17 using eq .",
    "( 5 ) in eq . ( 4 ) , @xmath12 is @xmath18 where @xmath19 @xmath16 is called magnetic potential .",
    "now , an @xmath0 qcd lagrangian is constructed with @xmath20 defined in eq .",
    "fermions are included as well    @xmath21    fixing the gauge by choosing @xmath6 along the third axis , @xmath22 is obtained @xmath23 this magnetic gauge is chosen to make the su(2 ) lagrangian abelian . after breaking the symmetry to the u(1 ) gauge group , @xmath22 will be an abelian gauge field .",
    "however , unlike qed , a magnetic current @xmath24emerges in the theory @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the dual field strength , @xmath27 is the dual magnetic field strength and @xmath24 is the magnetic current four - vector .",
    "monopole current results from the magnetic potential @xmath28 and it appears because of some unusual magnetic potential features .",
    "this potential is spacelike and contains a dirac string .",
    "actually , one can obtain wu - yang monopoles from @xmath28 by choosing the appropriate @xmath29 and @xmath30 in eq .",
    "( 7)@xcite .",
    "since in field theory we have a field for every particle , we must introduce a field for magnetic monopoles in the lagrangian ( 8) .",
    "moreover , @xmath28 is spacelike and this is not desirable .",
    "in addition , the dirac string that appeared in the theory is an unphysical singularity . for a field - theoretic description ,",
    "it is necessary to remove these undesirable features . adding a complex scalar field @xmath31 for the monopole , one has to define a dual gauge field @xmath32 to couple to the monopole field as well @xcite    @xmath33    however , there still exist spacelike potentials @xmath34 and @xmath28 in the lagrangian .",
    "these potentials contain dirac strings . in the next section",
    "we remove these potentials by zwanziger formalism @xcite so that a final local lagrangian is obtained , and it depends on matter fields that are spinor fields for quarks , scalar fields for monopoles , and regular timelike electric and magnetic potentials .",
    "a local lagrangian that contains electric and magnetic charges and leads to local field equations without unphysical singularities like dirac strings has been introduced by zwanziger @xcite .",
    "it depends on two electric and magnetic four - potentials , and an arbitrary fixed four - vector . using this framework",
    "we can avoid the undesirable features of lagrangian of eq . (",
    "11 ) by constructing a lagrangian depending on a spinor field @xmath35 for a quark , a scalar field @xmath36 for a monopole , an electric potential @xmath10 , a magnetic potential @xmath37 , and a fixed spacelike four - vector @xmath38 .    in cho formulation @xmath39 where @xmath40 is an electric current",
    ".    in zwanziger formalism both electric and magnetic currents are noether currents .",
    "the general solutions for the above equations are @xcite @xmath41 g can be described locally in terms of the electric and magnetic potentials @xmath42 and @xmath43 @xcite . since for a field theoretical description ,",
    "we need local fields without singularities , we have been motivated to apply zwanziger formalism to the cho - restricted theory . in zwanziger formalism , there exist electric and magnetic potentials , plus a spinor field for a fermionic particle that has both electric and magnetic charges . to get the same physics as the cho - restricted theory but without singularities , we add a scalar monopole field @xmath31 to the zwanziger lagrangian that couples to the magnetic potential @xmath43 .",
    "in addition , we couple the fermionic field @xmath44 to the electric potential @xmath42 . in contrast to zwanziger formalism where @xmath44 has electric and magnetic charges",
