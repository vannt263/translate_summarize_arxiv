    "another interesting feature of duality invariant models is that making it manifest at the level of the action requires new variables , `` electric '' and `` magnetic '' potentials , and doubling the number of gauge symmetries ( see @xcite for the case of electromagnetism and gravity with electric and magnetic sources ) . despite these sorts of frictions between duality invariance and other symmetries in field theory ,",
    "the interest in it comes from the belief that understanding an eventual relation between the two of them might enrich our view of hidden symmetries in supergravity and m theory @xcite .    in @xmath0 dimensions ,",
    "one has for gravity that the electric - magnetic duality relates the graviton , a rank-2 symmetric tensor , with fields of higher rank .",
    "if we account for duality , then there are two equivalent descriptions of linearized einstein theory : one based on the metric @xmath2 and the other in terms of its dual field @xmath3 , a mixed young tableaux of @xmath4 symmetry type whose covariant action was given by curtright @xcite . in four dimensions",
    "the dual graviton is a rank-2 symmetric tensor , as is the graviton itself . at nonlinear level , however , there are obstructions for the implementation of duality in the einstein - hilbert action .",

    "the search for modifications and/or deformations of general relativity ( gr ) is actually a very active trend of current research .",
    "the aim there is to find a gravity theory that bypasses the basic problems associated with the quantization of the classical formulation of gravity as a standard field theory . among the many directions in this trend one can find noncommutative gravity , stringy corrections to the gr action , new massive gravity , double field theory and , recently , hoava - lifshitz gravity @xcite .",

    "the aim of the present note is to implement the electric - magnetic duality in the linearized part of the hl action .",
    "the interesting point is that the breaking of full diffeomorphism invariance for generic values of @xmath5 is not an obstacle for the implementation of duality .",
    "then , this can be viewed as an exercise to test how duality is affected when we put spacetime covariance under stress .",
    "the implementation of duality as a symmetry of the action of linearized gravity was done in @xcite .",
    "the approach of the authors in that work is to solve the hamiltonian and momentum constraints to obtain the prepotentials ( analogous to the magnetic and the electric vector potentials in electromagnetism the latter arising from solving the gauss constraint ) , and then to show the manifest invariance of the action under @xmath10 rotations of those variables .",
    "here we do not follow this method but instead we parallel the work of @xcite where the authors connect fierz - pauli ( fp ) theory with its dual through a parental action ; still , we do make some comments on the former approach in sec . [",

    "despite that such modifications due to a value of @xmath31 are subtle , the structural consequences are big .",
    "foliation preserving diffeomorphisms act on the field variables as @xmath32 and they are a subset of the full group of diffeomorphisms : @xmath33 . having less gauge symmetry than the fp lagrangian , we would expect linearized hl gravity to have more than 2 d.o.f .. however , this is not seen by the constraint structure of the model .",
    "we briefly summarize its analysis here because it shows a detail that we use in the argument of the next section .",
    "the highlights of the constraint analysis go as follows : we get from the start the set of primary constraints @xmath34 and @xmath35 , the variables @xmath36 being the conjugate momenta of @xmath37 , respectively . the canonical hamiltonian is given by @xmath38 with @xmath39 the variables @xmath40 being the conjugate momenta of @xmath41 .",
    "the trace @xmath42 is proportional to the linearized trace of the extrinsic curvature : @xmath43 for @xmath44 there is one more primary constraint : @xmath45 .",
    "this case has been analyzed by the authors of @xcite , where they show that the same is equivalent to fp theory ( and manifestly in the transverse - traceless gauge ) . in the following",
    "we exclude from our analysis this particular value of @xmath5 .",
    "stabilization of the primary constraints results in the set of secondary constraints , @xmath46 ( the same hamiltonian and momentum constraints as in fp theory ) , and there are more secondary constraints : @xmath47 @xmath48 results from stabilization of @xmath49 , placing a constraint on the trace of the extrinsic curvature , and @xmath50 from stabilization of @xmath51 . at the end ,",
    "stabilization of @xmath52 results in conditions for a lagrange multiplier ( @xmath53 gives no further constraints nor conditions on lagrange multipliers ) . following the authors of @xcite , the constraint equation @xmath54 in",
    "asymptotically flat spacetime determines the lapse function and in fact forces it to vanish , freezing in this way the evolution in time of the theory .",
    "the authors also showed ( see @xcite ) that time reparametrizations are trivial gauge transformations and so there is no first class constraint associated to it .",
    "indeed , by inspection of the poisson brackets between the constraints we see that they vanish except for @xmath55 and as a consequence the hamiltonian constraint , the one we would have expected to generate the evolution in @xmath56 , is second class .",
    "thus we have a set of four second class ( @xmath57 ) and a set of six first class ( @xmath58 ) constraints , and thereby we might conclude that there are 2 d.o.f .. the fact that the extra mode is not manifest here is because we are taking the linearized theory around flat spacetime @xcite . given that @xmath53 are first class , the only are just arbitrary shifts of @xmath59 . ]",
    "nontrivial gauge transformations of the lagrangian ( [ eq : lagadmlin ] ) are those associated to @xmath60 .",
    "now , there is one detail of the constraint structure that is relevant for the electric - magnetic duality on lagrangian ( [ eq : lagadmlin ] ) . following the approach of @xcite for the case of fp",
    ", we can try to analyze duality rotations in terms of the prepotentials @xmath61 and @xmath62 defined by solving the constraints @xmath63 and @xmath64 [ see eqs .",
    "( 2.7 ) and ( 2.11 ) of @xcite ] .",
    "however , in the present case we face an extra constraint placing a condition on @xmath62 , namely , @xmath65 with no counterpart for the @xmath61 variables . besides , there is no exchange between the kinetic and potential energies after these rotations as it happens in fp theory , and the condition above does not help to make the match .",
    "this leaves us with the idea that linearized hl gravity is not self - dual .",
    "nevertheless , we can analyze duality from another point of view that allows us to draw a map to the magnetic dual of linearized hl gravity we call the lagrangian ( [ eq : lagadmlin ] ) the electric one .",
    "the path goes through a parent action , analogous to the one constructed in @xcite for fp theory .",
    "this procedure is reformulated in @xcite in a way that suits the purpose of the present study . in the following section , we use this approach to find the magnetic dual of linearized hl gravity .",
    "schematically , the road map presented in @xcite starts from the second order action in _ vielbein _",
    "formalism for fp , taking it up to a first order parent action and then down from it to the second order dual theory given by the curtright lagrangian ( see fig . [",
    "fig : parentalscheme ] ) . in the present case , and to keep parallelism with fp theory , we need an action in the _ vielbein _ basis as a starting point , the same that should be obtained by a parental one ( see left branch of fig .",

    "the transformation of the longitudinal part of @xmath113 on the other hand gets linked to the transformation of the longitudinal part of @xmath115 , and hence their shifts are not arbitrary anymore . to sum up , the gauge symmetries of lagrangian ( [ eq : lagrhorlin ] ) are given by    [ eq : gaugsymm ] @xmath116    the transformations ( [ eq : gaugsymmh ] ) , which are just @xmath117 projected on adm variables , show that @xmath118 enjoys full diffeomorphism invariance , and the ( [ eq : gaugsymmf ] ) part that the variables @xmath111 and the transverse part of @xmath113 are pure gauge ( but not the longitudinal part of @xmath113 , which is the one appearing in @xmath96 ) .",
