    "after more than 25 years of considerable theoretical and experimental efforts , it appears that qcd is the theory of strong interactions .",
    "ideally , in high - energy qcd one needs one single piece of information from the experiments : the value of @xmath0 . starting from that measured value , every observable can be computed from first principles . in practice",
    "this is not feasible , since we do nt know how to perform calculations in terms of the hadrons that experiments measure in their detectors .",
    "perturbation theory offers a viable way out , since it allows to prove , at least formally , the so - called factorization theorems .",
    "these give explicit prescriptions to write physical observables as the convolution of short- and long - distance parts , up to terms suppressed by the power of some large scale .",
    "we can imagine this factorization to occur at an arbitrary scale @xmath1 ; with a suitable choice of @xmath1 the short - distance pieces , which are entirely expressed in terms of quarks and gluons , are perturbatively calculable .",
    "the long - distance pieces ( such as parton densities ) can not be computed in perturbation theory , but their dependence on @xmath1 can .",
    "furthermore , they are universal , which means that they do nt depend on short - distance physics , but solely on the nature of the hadrons involved , which is a key factor for perturbative qcd to have predictive power .",
    "pending a general solution of qcd , the computing framework based on perturbation theory may be regarded as a hypothesis , which needs to be supported , or disproved , by experimental observations .",
    "countless tests have indeed been successful , convincing us of the correctness of this approach and of the capability of qcd to describe strong interactions ; in many areas precise measurements , rather than tests , are being carried out .",
    "this success may give to the non - expert the impression that current efforts in theoretical qcd are perhaps technically appealing , but not compelling physics - wise .",
    "to counter this view , it is worth reminding that in the past decade the studies of several technically - involved problems , such as computations to next - to - leading order accuracy , resummation techniques , and monte carlo simulations , have been key factors to the outstanding achievements of lep , slc , hera , and tevatron .",
    "however , the solutions devised so far are not sufficient any longer . for an improvement of the accuracy in the extraction of @xmath0 , for a deeper understanding of the interplay between perturbative and non - perturbative physics , and for a realistic modelling of tevatron run ii and lhc physics , new ideas and computations",
    ". it must be clear that such investigations are not only relevant to the study of qcd itself , but also to a variety of other issues , from sm precision tests to searches of beyond - the - sm physics .",
    "besides , a few unsatisfactory results remain in qcd , which deserve further studies .    needless to say , this review can not be complete , and i ll have to leave out several interesting results , such as new nlo calculations , progress in small-@xmath2 physics , diffraction , fully numerical computations , and spin physics . also , i ll not present most of the recent experimental results in high - energy qcd , since they can be found in k.  long s writeup @xcite .",
    "i d rather use a few phenomenological examples to discuss some theoretical advancements , and open problems .",
    "related topics can be found in z.  bern s writeup @xcite .",
    "i ll quote papers submitted to this conference as [ s - nnn ] , s and nnn being the session and paper numbers respectively .",
    "heavy flavour production is one of the most extensively studied topics in qcd .",
    "an impressive amount of data is available , for basically all kinds of colliding particles .",
    "the non - vanishing quark mass allows the definition of open - heavy - quark cross sections ( whereas for light quarks one must convolute the short - distance cross sections with fragmentation functions , in order to cancel final - state collinear divergences ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the presence of the mass makes the calculation of the matrix elements more involved . the breakthrough was the computation of total @xmath3 hadroproduction rates to nlo accuracy @xcite , readily extended to other production processes and more exclusive final states @xcite .",
    "the resummation of various classes of large logarithms affecting these fixed - order computations , such as threshold , large-@xmath4 , and small-@xmath2 logs , has also been accomplished , typically at the next - to - leading log ( nll ) accuracy .    in those kinematical regions not affected by large logs , the mass of the heavy quark sets the hard scale .",
    "furthermore , the impact of effects of non - perturbative origin ( such as colour drag or intrinsic @xmath5 ) is known to be larger the smaller the quark mass and cm energy .",
    "thus , top physics is expected to be the ideal testing ground for perturbative computations .",
    "rate at the tevatron.,title=\"fig : \" ] -2.2pc    the agreement between nlo results @xcite ( dashed lines  the band is the spread of the prediction due to scale variation ) , and tevatron run i data @xcite , shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : topattev ] for total @xmath6 rates , appears in fact to be satisfactory .",
    "the inclusion of soft - gluon effects ( solid lines ) , resummed to nll accuracy according to the computation of ref .",
    "@xcite , is seen to increase only marginally the nlo prediction , while sizably reducing the scale uncertainty .",
    "top production appears therefore under perturbative control .",
    "more stringent tests will be performed in run ii : the errors on mass and rate will be smaller , and measurements will be performed of more exclusive @xmath6 observables and of single - top cross section ( for which fully differential nlo results are now available @xcite ) .",
    "bottom quarks are copiously produced at colliders , and precise data for single - inclusive distributions have been available for a long time .",
    "it is well known ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) that nlo predictions are about a factor of two smaller than data at the sps and at the tevatron ( on the other hand , the shape of the @xmath4 spectrum of the centrally - produced @xmath7 is fairly well described by qcd ) . in a recently - published measurement @xcite of the @xmath8 @xmath4 spectrum ,",
    "cdf find that the average data / theory ratio is @xmath9 .",
    "however , this worrisome result is largely due to an improper computation of the nlo cross section .",
    "let me remind that the spectrum of a @xmath7-flavoured meson @xmath10 is computed as follows : = dzd_td(z ; ) ( p_t - z_t ) , [ btobsec ] where @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) is the transverse momentum of @xmath7 ( @xmath10 ) , @xmath13 is the cross section for open-@xmath7 production , and @xmath14 is the non - perturbative fragmentation function ( npff ) , which describes the @xmath15 fragmentation .",
    "npff is not calculable from first principles , and the free parameter it contains ( @xmath16 ) is fitted to data after assuming a functional form in @xmath17 ( such as peterson @xcite , kartvelishvili @xcite , etc ) .",
    "this fit is typically performed using eq .",
    "( [ btobsec ] ) , identifying the l.h.s . with @xmath18 data .",
    "it follows that the value of @xmath16 is strictly correlated to the short - distance cross section @xmath13 used in the fitting procedure , and thus is _ non - physical_. when eq .",
    "( [ btobsec ] ) is used to predict @xmath10-meson cross sections ,",
    "it is therefore mandatory to make consistent choices for @xmath16 and @xmath13 . this has not been done in ref .",
    "@xcite : for @xmath13 , the nlo result of ref .",
    "@xcite is used , but the value of @xmath16 adopted ( 0.006 ) has been derived in the context of a lo , rather than nlo , computation . on the other hand , if a more appropriate value of @xmath16 is chosen ( @xmath190.002 @xcite ) , the theoretical prediction increases by a mere 20% @xcite , still rather far from the data .",
    "there are , however , a couple of observations which save the day .",
    "first , one has to remark that in the upper end of the @xmath4 range probed by cdf ( @xmath20  gev ) , large-@xmath21 effects may start to show up .",
    "therefore , fonll computations @xcite should be used rather than nlo ones .",
    "the fonll formalism consistently combines ( i.e. , avoids overcounting ) the nlo result with the cross section in which @xmath22 logs are resummed to nll accuracy ( such resummed cross section is sometimes incorrectly referred to as `` massless '' ) .",
    "thus , fonll can describe both the small-@xmath4 ( @xmath23 , where resummed results do nt make sense ) and the large-@xmath4 ( @xmath24 , where nlo results are not reliable ) regimes . the second observation concerns again the npff : @xmath25 is a rather steeply falling function , and one can approximate it with @xmath26 in the whole @xmath11 range ; then ( from eq .",
    "( [ btobsec ] ) ) @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the @xmath29 mellin moment of the npff .",
    "this fact has been noticed some time ago @xcite , and @xmath30 is seen to approximate the exact result fairly well @xcite . since @xmath315 ( at the tevatron ) , it follows that , in order to have an accurate prediction for the @xmath4 spectrum in hadroproduction , it is mandatory that the first few mellin moments computed with @xmath32 agreed with those measured . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is pointed out that this is not the case , in spite of the fact that the prediction for the inclusive @xmath7 cross section in @xmath18 collisions , obtained with _ the same _ @xmath32 , displays an excellent agreement with the data .",
    "there may seem to be a contradiction in this statement : if the shape is reproduced well , why this is not true for mellin moments ?",
    "the reason is that when fitting @xmath32 one excludes the region of large @xmath17 , since it is affected by sudakov logs , and by complex non - perturbative effects which are unlikely to be described by the npff . on the other hand ,",
    "the large-@xmath17 region is important for the computation of @xmath33 ( because of the factor @xmath34 in the integrand ) .",
    "therefore , for the purpose of predicting @xmath10-meson spectra at colliders , ref .",
    "@xcite advocates the procedure of fitting the npff directly in the @xmath35-space .",
    "a fit to the second moment ( denoted as @xmath36 fit henceforth ) is found to fit well all the @xmath33 s for @xmath35 up to 10 ; and although kartvelishvili s form is used , peterson s gives comparable results .",
    "data vs theory @xcite.,title=\"fig : \" ] -2.2pc    using the fonll computation , and a @xmath36 fit for the npff , the average data / theory ratio reduces to @xmath37 @xcite . taking the scale uncertainty into account , @xmath8 data appear to be compatible with qcd predictions ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : bpluscn ] ) .",
    "if one wants to avoid the pitfalls of npff s , an alternative possibility consists in considering @xmath7-jets rather than @xmath10 mesons , since in this case the npff simply does nt enter the cross section .",
    "the comparison between nlo predictions for @xmath7-jets @xcite and d0 measurements @xcite is indeed satisfactory : data are consistent with theory in the range @xmath38  gev .",
    "overall , one can conclude that @xmath7 data at the tevatron are reasonably described by nlo qcd .",
    "it is worth mentioning that some existing results , presented in terms of @xmath7-quark cross sections , are likely affected by the findings of ref .",
    "@xcite , and need to be reconsidered . among the various mechanisms which can further increase the theoretical predictions , small-@xmath2 @xcite and threshold resummations @xcite will probably play a secondary role wrt nnlo contributions , which are expected to be large given the size of the k - factor at the nlo .",
    "i now turn to the case of charm production .",
    "a thorough discussion on this topic is beyond the scope of this review , and i ll only give the briefest of the summaries ( which will not do any justice to the field ) .",
    "lep data for total rates are in agreement with nlo qcd predictions @xcite ; the shapes of single - inclusive @xmath39 spectra in @xmath40 collisions are as predicted by nlo qcd @xcite , whereas normalization is off by a factor 1.52 , but still consistent with qcd when theoretical uncertainties are taken into account .",
    "the vast majority of fixed target hadro- and photoproduction data are well described by nlo computations , but only if predictions for single - inclusive distributions and correlations are supplemented by some parametrizations of non - perturbative phenomena ( such as intrinsic @xmath5 ) . at hera ,",
    "dis data are in agreement with nlo qcd results @xcite . in photoproduction",
    ", some concerns have arisen in the past because of the discrepancy between zeus and h1 measurements in the comparison with theory : h1 @xcite appears to be in perfect agreement with qcd , whereas zeus @xcite is at places ( for intermediate @xmath4 s and large @xmath41 s ) incompatible with nlo predictions .",
    "zeus have submitted to this conference [ 5 - 786 ] data with unprecedented coverage at large @xmath4 .",
    "the comparison to fonll predictions @xcite , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : zeusdstar ] , appears to be satisfactory , although data are marginally harder than theory .",
    "the agreement improves if a @xmath36 fit for the npff is adopted ( this result is still preliminary ) .",
    "data in @xmath42 collisions vs fonll predictions , title=\"fig : \" ] -2.2pc    let me finally mention the increasing amount of measurements for @xmath7 rates from fixed - target @xcite , hera @xcite , [ 5 - 783,5 - 784,5 - 785,5 - 1013,5 - 1014 ] , and lep @xcite , [ 5 - 366,5 - 475 ] experiments .",
    "a summary of the situation , in the form of ratios data / nlo qcd , is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : brates ] .",
    "while the fixed - target measurements are in overall agreement with qcd , hera and lep measurements are largely incompatible with theory .",
    "i find this hard to reconcile with the results presented so far , and the size of the discrepancy also makes it problematic to find an explanation in terms of beyond - the - sm physics , let alone higher orders in qcd .",
    "rates.,title=\"fig : \" ] -2.2pc    it is necessary to note that in many cases the experimental results are extrapolated to the full phase space from a rather narrow visible region .",
    "it is encouraging to note that in the cases of the recent zeus measurements in dis  [ 5 - 783 ] and photoproduction  [ 5 - 785 ] ( full boxes in fig .  [ fig : brates ] ) , results for single - inclusive distributions are given too , which are seen to be fully compatible with the corresponding nlo predictions .",
    "the necessity of understanding long - distance effects in final - state measurements is not peculiar to @xmath7 hadroproduction .",
    "the hadron - parton duality assumption states that there is a class of observables ( such as jet variables or event shapes in @xmath18 collisions ) whose description in terms of quarks and gluons is expected to reproduce the data , up to terms suppressed by some inverse power of the hard scale @xmath43 of the process ( power corrections ) .",
    "these terms are usually estimated by comparing the parton- and hadron - level predictions of monte carlo ( mc ) generators .",
    "this procedure is not really satisfactory , since mc parameters are tuned to data ( which creates a bias on the `` predictions '' for power - suppressed effects ) , and since the definition of parton- and hadron - level is far from being straightforward .",
    "it is remarkable that we can get insight on non - perturbative physics from perturbative considerations .",
    "the perturbative series , being asymptotic , can be summed to all orders only after defining a summation procedure ( in a rather arbitrary manner ) ; one assumes that this technical manipulation mimics the role played in nature by non - perturbative effects , which are necessary for qcd to be self - consistent .",
    "the summation procedure must eliminate the divergence of the perturbative series , but some finite quantities are left unconstrained .",
    "thus , the idea is to use the ambiguities of the summation procedure to study non - perturbative effects .",
    "although the regularization of the divergence can be technically very complicated , it can always be seen as a prescription to deal with the landau pole of @xmath0 . the idea of ref .",
    "@xcite ( dmw from now on ) is to bypass such a prescription by _ defining _ @xmath0 in the infrared ( ir ) region , assuming its universality ; thus , @xmath0 should effectively measure confinement effects in inclusive quantities ( in order to use such an @xmath0 in actual computations , it is also necessary to assume that the concepts of quarks and gluons still make sense in the ir ) . after giving the gluon",
    "a fake ( `` trigger '' ) mass @xmath1 , the ( fully inclusive ) observable under study is computed in perturbation theory ; the small-@xmath1 behaviour determines the power @xmath44 of the leading power - suppressed term @xmath45 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath46 can not be computed , but can be expressed as an integral of @xmath47 over @xmath48 , with @xmath49 .",
    "since all the ( non computable ) power - correction effects are contained in this coefficient , one effectively gets a factorization formula .",
    "a class of observables of great physical relevance is that of event shapes for which @xmath50 ; their mean values can be computed with the dmw approach .",
    "the property of @xmath0 universality is _ formally _ even more far - reaching ; for example , it implies that the non - perturbative effects it describes exponentiate for observables that do so @xcite .",
    "this offers the possibility of studying not only mean values , but distributions .",
    "the results of dmw for mean values can then be recovered by an expansion of the ( sudakov ) exponent and subsequent average .",
    "more precisely , if @xmath51 denotes the observable , the sudakov is expanded in the region @xmath52 , and only the first non - trivial term in the expansion is kept .    in this context",
    ", factorization derives from the hypothesis of @xmath0 ir universality , which is an effective description of long - distance effects , and as such must be insensitive to the details of parton dynamics .",
    "for example , these details are irrelevant when one sums inclusively over the decay products of any parton branchings .",
    "it has been observed @xcite that inclusiveness is lost to a certain extent when recoil effects ( i.e. , higher orders ) are considered , and thus factorization breaks down in this case .",
    "one may still insist that factorization holds , and devise a procedure to systematically account for those effects which would break it in a naive treatment @xcite .",
    "the results for mean values and distributions of event shapes can be written as follows : & & t= t_pert + c_tp , [ evmean ] + & & ( t)= .|_pert(t - c_tp ) , [ evdistr ] + & & p= , [ pshift ] + & & _ i_0(_i)= _ 0^_idk(k ) . here , @xmath53 is a computable coefficient , `` pert '' means perturbatively - computed , and @xmath54 includes the two - loop results of refs .",
    "@xcite ; in principle , @xmath54 can depend upon @xmath51 , but ( accidentally ) it does not .",
    "the @xmath55 and @xmath56 terms in eq .",
    "( [ pshift ] ) are there to avoid double counting with the perturbatively - computed part , which shows again that long- and short - distance effects are correlated . since no small parameter is involved in the two - loop computation of @xmath54 , one may wonder whether factorization could be spoiled beyond two loops .",
    "although it is _ argued _ that this is not the case @xcite , a comparison with the data is mandatory .",
    "also notice that the formulae above need to be modified when more complicated kinematical effects have to be described , as in the case of broadenings @xcite .",
    "( [ evmean])([pshift ] ) are used to fit the data in terms of @xmath55 and @xmath57 .",
    "updated analyses relevant to @xmath18 collisions have been presented to this conference [ 5 - 228,5 - 229,5 - 389 ] , @xcite  see also @xcite .",
    "results obtained from mean values are satisfactory , with comparable @xmath58 s obtained from different observables , and @xmath59 values fairly consistent with the world average .",
    "the situation worsens in the case of distributions : @xmath58 universality holds at @xmath1925% level ( 12 @xmath60 ) , and @xmath59 values are systematically lower than the world average , especially for observables such as wide broadening @xmath61 and heavy jet mass @xmath62 .",
    "this fact is disturbing since the same data for distributions , with hadronization effects described by mc s , return @xmath59 values in much better agreement with the world average .     from event shapes in @xmath18 collisions.,title=\"fig : \" ] -2.2pc",

    "( [ evshape ] ) it is not necessary to assume that @xmath68 ( all terms @xmath69 are now expected to be included ) , and therefore the fit ranges can be extended .",

    "( [ evshape ] ) , it is suggested to combine sudakov and renormalon resummations in a single formalism .",
    "a renormalon ambiguity appears in the exponent , and the prescription necessary to resolve it can be naturally formulated in terms of a shape function , automatically constraining its functional form .",

    "@xcite , it has to be stressed that the perturbative result @xmath70 in eq .",
    "( [ evshape ] ) is different in the two formalisms , since dge includes a class of subleading logs of renormalon origin . in @xmath18 physics ,",
    "( [ evshape ] ) gives satisfactory results : a good fit to the second moments of 1-thrust , @xmath62 , and @xmath71 parameter is obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite , and the fits for thrust and @xmath62 of ref .",
    "@xcite are in better agreement in the @xmath72 plane wrt those obtained with dmw . on the other hand , according to ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath73 ( the theory error is estimated to be around 5% ) . therefore , it seems that a more refined treatment of non - perturbative effects , which is helpful in other respects , is not what one needs in order to get larger @xmath0 values .",
    "in a couple of interesting analyses , delphi adopted rather unconventional methods to study event shapes . in ref .",
    "@xcite , event shape distributions were compared to fixed - order @xmath74 ( nlo ) results ( i.e. , resummation has not been included ) , using the renormalization scale as a free parameter in the fit , and correcting for hadronization effects with mc s .",
    "although i m not aware of any theoretical consideration which justifies such a procedure ( called in ref .",
    "@xcite `` experimental optimization of the scale '' ) , the @xmath0 values obtained from different observables display a remarkable consistency , and they are also consistent with those obtained by using nll - resummed predictions . in [ 5 - 228 ] ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) event shape means were shown to give mutually consistent @xmath0 values in the context of a renormalization group approach ( rgi @xcite ) , without needing any hadronization corrections .",
    "the final @xmath0 results of refs . @xcite and [ 5 - 228 ] are in excellent agreement with the world average .",
    "i interpret these findings as the indication that ( at least in a given cm energy range ) the uncertainties affecting theoretical predictions at the nlo are larger than or of the same order as the power - suppressed effects that one aims to study .",
    "it thus appears that the computation of event shapes at the nnlo is necessary for a deeper understanding of this matter .    in summary , in the past few years a solid progress has been achieved in the understanding of power - suppressed effects in @xmath18 collisions and in dis .",
    "although models such as dmw can successfully describe many features of the data , some aspects deserve further studies . in some cases ,",
    "improvements are obtained within approaches which refine the treatment of the non - perturbative part , using a shape function , but the computation of the next order in perturbation theory will likely be necessary in order to obtain a more consistent overall picture .",
    "it is worth recalling that the study of hadron - mass effects has been found @xcite to induce further power - suppressed terms , some of which can be eliminated by adopting a suitable definition for the observables ( e - scheme ) . furthermore , more stringent tests of the models for power - suppressed effects should be performed using observables with more complicated kinematic structure and/or gluons at the lo ( see refs . @xcite and references therein ) . finally , it appears to be mandatory to extend the studies of such models to the case of hadronic collisions ( for jet observables in particular ) , where little work has been done so far .",
    "bottom production at the tevatron and event shapes in @xmath18 collisions are a couple of examples which provide physical motivations to increase the precision of the perturbative computations .",
    "if tree @xmath75-point functions contribute to a given reaction at the lo , the n@xmath76lo result ( i.e. , of relative order @xmath77 wrt to the lo ) will get contributions from the @xmath78-loop , @xmath79-point functions , with @xmath80 .",
    "there are basically three major steps to make in order to get physical predictions : _ i _ ) explicit computation of all the @xmath78-loop , @xmath79-point functions ; _ ii _ ) cancellation of soft and collinear divergences ( which i ll denote  improperly  as ir cancellation henceforth ) ; _ iii _ ) numerical integration of the _ finite _ result obtained from _ i _ ) and _ ii _ ) , with mc techniques to allow more flexibility .",
    "one should also mention that uv renormalization has in general to be carried out ; however , this is basically textbook matter by now , and thus i ll not deal with it in the following . for nlo computations ( @xmath81 ) , steps _",
    "i)__iii ) _ appear to be understood .",
    "one - loop integrals have been computed up to five external legs @xcite ; the case of @xmath82 can not probably be handled with feynman - diagram techniques only , and still awaits for a general solution ( see @xcite ) .",
    "subtraction @xcite and slicing @xcite methods , to achieve ir cancellation with semi - analytical techniques , have been available for a long time . in their modern versions",
    "@xcite they are formulated in an universal ( i.e. , process- and @xmath75-independent ) way , which simplifies step _ iii ) _ considerably , and allows the computation of any ir safe observable ( no matter how exclusive ) .",
    "no modification is needed in order to incorporate new one - loop results .",
    "attempts to achieve ir cancellation through full numerical computations @xcite are still in a preliminary stage , reproducing known results for three - jet production in @xmath18 collisions .    only a handful of production processes have been computed to nnlo accuracy and beyond : results are available for dis coefficient functions @xcite and for the drell - yan k - factor @xcite at @xmath74 , and for the rate @xmath83 hadrons @xcite at @xmath84 ( i ll later deal with inclusive higgs production in some details ) .",
    "all these computations are inclusive enough to allow a complete analytical integration over the phase - space of final - state partons .",

    "the second problem stems from the fact that multi - parton me s are ir divergent .",
    "clearly , in hard - particle configurations ir divergences do nt appear ; however , the definition of what hard means is , to a large extent , arbitrary . in practice ,",
    "hardness is achieved by imposing some cuts on suitable partonic variables , such as @xmath4 s and @xmath131-distances @xmath132 in hadronic collisions .",

    "this means that , when generating events at a fixed @xmath128 number of primary particles , physical observables in general depend upon @xmath133 ; i refer to this as the @xmath133-bias problem .",
    "any solution to the @xmath133-bias problem implies a procedure to combine consistently the treatment of me s with different @xmath128 s . here , the difficulty is that of avoiding double counting , that is , the generation of the same kinematical configuration more often than prescribed by qcd .",
    "the vast majority of recent approaches to me corrections address only the first of the two problems mentioned above .",
    "a considerable amount of work has been devoted to the coding of hadronic processes with vector bosons / higgs plus heavy quarks in the final state , which can not be found ( regardless of the number of extra partons ) in standard mc s .",
    "the complexity of hard - process generation for large @xmath128 suggests to implement it in a package ( which i call me generator ) distinct from the shower mc .",
    "the me generator stores a set of hard configurations in a file ( event file ) ; the event file is eventually read by the mc , which uses the hard configurations as initial conditions for the showers .",
    "the advantage of this procedure is that it is completely modular : one given event file can be read by different mc s , and conversely one mc can read event files produced by different me generators .",
    "it is clearly convenient to reach an agreement on the format of such event records : this is now available @xcite ( les houches accord # 1 ) .",
    "ready - to - use me generators ( with different numbers of hard processes implemented ) are acermc @xcite , alpgen @xcite , and madgraph / madevent @xcite .",
    "related work , at present set up to function only with pythia , has been presented by the comphep @xcite and grace @xcite groups .",
    "all of these me generators use feynman - diagram techniques in the computation of me s , except alpgen , which uses the iterative algorithm alpha @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",

    "thus , @xmath133 must be chosen in a range which is somewhat dependent upon the observables that one wants to study .",
    "this implies that , strictly speaking , the combination of an me generator with a shower mc is _ not _ an event generator , since the event record depends upon the observables .",

    "@xcite uses a technique similar to that of ref .",
    "@xcite , based on the definition of a local ir counterterm . at variance with ref .",
    "@xcite , where the resummation of large logs is performed to ll accuracy , refs .",
    "@xcite advocate an nll ( or beyond ) resummation ; for this to happen , it is argued that the standard formulation of collinear factorization must be extended .",
    "this approach has been fully formulated @xcite only in the unphysical @xmath193 theory so far .",
    "current qcd implementations do not include gluon emission .",
    "it seems appropriate to start this section by mentioning a couple of phenomenological issues which would have deserved more attention .",
    "one is the problem affecting the single - inclusive , isolated - photon measurements at the tevatron .",
    "if d0 data are considered @xcite , a moderate disagreement with nlo qcd is present in the low-@xmath4 , central-@xmath41 region , which disappears when the ratio @xmath194 is considered .",
    "the situation worsens in the case of cdf data @xcite : not only the discrepancy with qcd is statistically more significant for cross sections , but the measured ratio @xmath195 also disagrees with theory .",
    "the consistent inclusion of recoil effects , along the lines of refs .",
    "@xcite , might increase the qcd prediction at small @xmath4 s , and thus reduce the discrepancy .",
    "the second problem affects the single - inclusive jet cross section as measured by d0 @xcite , the jets being reconstructed with a @xmath5-algorithm .",
    "the data display a rather poor agreement with theory for @xmath196  gev ; this is disappointing , given the excellent results obtained with the cone algorithm ( as far as the cone algorithm is concerned , i should also mention here that the previously reported excess of data over theory at large @xmath4 has now completely disappeared : nlo qcd perfectly reproduces the data , if updated pdf sets are used .",
    "an explanation in terms of pdfs has been already given in the past , but the pdf set used at that time resulted from an _ ad hoc _ fit  named `` hj '' by the cteq collaboration .",
    "this is not necessary any longer , since in the newest pdf releases the gluon density of the _ best _ fit naturally results to be hj - like .",
    "@xcite for a discussion on this point ) .",
    "it is hard to believe that the discrepancy in the case of the @xmath5-algorithm is the signal of a serious problem in qcd ( since it would probably affect the cone algorithm as well ) ; however , it may indicate a deficiency in current mc simulations , or in the understanding of hadronization and/or detector effects , which would surely worsen at the lhc energies .",
    "it has to be remarked that the @xmath5-algorithm appears to work well at hera .    in general ,",
    "the capability of qcd to describe hard production processes is quite remarkable ( with the exception of @xmath7-production at lep and hera ) .",
    "the definition of a formalism for the computation of exclusive observables at the nnlo is one of the most challenging and hot topics in perturbative qcd , which will have an important impact on phenomenological studies and will be crucial in improving the precision of @xmath0 ( and other fundamental parameters ) measurements  at colliders , exclusive drell - yan production will necessarily have to be calculated to nnlo , in order to match the experimental precision .",
    "the substantial progress made in the past couple of years in the computation of two - loop integrals and three - loop splitting functions , and the nnlo results for direct inclusive sm - higgs production , are certainly very encouraging .",
    "nnlo results will also help to understand better the interplay between soft and hard physics ; the @xmath18 and dis environments will serve as a laboratory for the more involved case of hadronic collisions , where most of the work remains to be done .",
    "monte carlos are much better equipped to face the challenges of tevatron run ii and lhc .",
    "the implementation of new processes in matrix element generators proceeds steadily and , although there is still work to be done on the general structure of matrix element corrections , these techniques are rather well established by now .",
    "formalisms for @xmath156 s have received considerable attention in the recent past ; the field has still to reach a mature stage , and new ideas will certainly be presented in the near future .",
    "a rather obvious but quite challenging step is that of merging matrix element corrections and @xmath156 approaches .",
