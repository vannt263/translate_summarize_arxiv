    "these dimer calculations allow us to compare the methods with a larger basis set and to have a reliable theoretical reference with ccsd(t ) .",
    "they also permit us to assess the methods for a range of distances between the molecules and to estimate what the effect of the optimization of the lattice parameters in the crystal would be for each method .    for these dimers , mp2 and ccsd(t ) give very close interaction energies for all distances and can be considered as the reference .",
    "pbesol gives quite accurate interaction energies for urea and formamide , but an overestimated interaction energy for ammonia and a largely underestimated interaction energy for carbon dioxide .",
