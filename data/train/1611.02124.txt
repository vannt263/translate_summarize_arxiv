    "inflation is the best - known solution to the initial condition problems of the standard hot big bang model .",
    "an inflationary epoch can arise from a modified type of gravity , that includes a quadratic term @xmath0 @xcite , or from the dynamics of a scalar field @xcite , the inflaton .",
    "features of the scalar field potential are now quite constrained by the recent measurements of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) @xcite .",
    "most of the inflationary models are based on general relativity ( gr ) . despite its impressive agreement with astrophysical observations in the solar system",
    ", gr requires the introduction of two major dark components in order to account for the cosmological data @xcite .",
    "alternatively , one may think that gr is not the ultimate theory and several modified gravity models have been developed .",
    "perhaps the simplest ones are the so - called @xmath1 theories @xcite , in which one replaces the ricci scalar , @xmath2 , in the einstein - hilbert action by a generic function of the scalar curvature .",
    "another interesting possibility is to introduce additionally a non - minimal coupling between matter and curvature , expressed as a product of another function of the curvature @xmath3 and the matter lagrangian @xcite .",
    "this model has quite interesting implications for stellar stability @xcite , preheating after inflation @xcite , as well as in mimicking the dark matter in galaxies and clusters @xcite or the late time accelerated expansion of the universe @xcite .",
    "this scenario has also a non - negligible impact in black hole physics @xcite , and on the generalisation of the layzer - irvine equation @xcite .",
    "the idea that non - minimal couplings can affect inflation is not new . for example , in the bezrukov - shaposhnikov model , the higgs boson acts as the inflaton non - minimally coupled to the scalar curvature @xcite , although in this case only a particular function of the field , and not the full scalar lagrangian , is non - minimally coupled to @xmath2 .    in this work ,",
    "we consider the modifications to inflationary scenarios driven by a slowly rolling scalar field introduced by a non - minimal coupling between the inflaton lagrangian and the ricci scalar , and show that both the dynamics of inflation and its observational predictions can be considerably different from the minimally coupled case .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , we introduce the non - minimal coupling between matter and curvature and discuss the resulting field equations and their main features .",
    "we then study the inflationary regime in these theories using the slow - roll approximation .",
    "some potentials for the inflaton are studied and compared to the observational limits set by the planck collaborations in sections iii and iv .",
    "our main conclusions are summarised and discussed in section v.",
    "in the extended @xmath1 theories with a non - minimal coupling between a curvature term and the matter lagrangian density , the action functional reads @xcite : @xmath4~,\\ ] ] where @xmath5 are arbitrary functions of the ricci scalar @xmath2 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 is the matter lagrangian density .",
    "varying the action with respect to the metric , @xmath8 , leads to the following field equations : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the einstein tensor , @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "it is straightforward to see that choosing @xmath13 and @xmath14 , one recovers general relativity .    using the bianchi identities in the above field equations",
    ", one finds that the matter energy - momentum tensor is not covariantly conserved in this model : @xmath15    for a perfect fluid , one can find an extra force acting on a test particle , given by @xcite : @xmath16h^{\\mu\\nu } ~,\\ ] ] where @xmath17 is the projection operator and @xmath18 denotes the particle s 4-velocity . in these theories ,",
    "the degeneracy between the lagrangian choices @xmath19 or @xmath20 is lifted in opposition to what happens in gr @xcite , since it yields different behaviours for the extra force term ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a thorough discussion ) .",
    "we start by assuming the robertson - walker metric for a homogeneous and isotropic universe : @xmath21 where @xmath22 denotes the comoving spatial metric .",
    "since inflation will exponentially dilute the effects of spatial curvature , thus addressing the flatness problem , we consider for simplicity a flat euclidean metric @xmath23 .",
    "the matter content in the universe is well approximated by a set of perfect fluids that dominate the energy balance at different epochs .",
    "for each fluid , the energy - momentum tensor takes the form : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the fluid s 4-velocity .",
    "the time component of the non - conservation of the stress tensor , @xmath26 , gives @xmath27 where the dots denote time derivatives .",
    "in the case of a homogeneous scalar field with lagrangian density @xmath28 we have @xmath29 and @xmath30 , and the inflaton s dynamics is given by the field equation : @xmath31 where @xmath32 .",
    "we thus see that the non - minimal matter - curvature coupling will induce a friction term in the inflaton s equation of motion , likewise the case of warm inflation @xcite .",
    "an analogous term also appears in the continuity equation for radiation , such that for @xmath33 , one gets : @xmath34 integrating the above expression , one obtains @xcite :    @xmath35^{4/3}~.\\ ] ]    for the case @xmath36 , we may expect this friction term to damp the inflaton s motion and thus facilitate slow - roll .",
    "however , as opposed to the case of warm inflation , @xmath37 yields a sink rather than a source for the radiation energy density , so that the non - minimal coupling would dilute the latter faster than expansion instead of counter - acting this dilution effect .",
    "thus , only for @xmath38 may the non - minimal coupling sustain a thermal bath during inflation .",
    "as we will see in the next sections , we are interested in modifications of gravity in the strong curvature / density regime , i.e.  in scenarios where @xmath39 . in addition , during inflation @xmath40 is a decreasing function of time , so that @xmath38 . however , since @xmath41 does not vary considerably during inflation , @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the usual slow - roll parameter ( defined below ) .",
    "this implies that the friction term will have a negligible effect on the inflaton s motion and will not be able to counteract the dilution of the radiation energy density .",
    "inflation will thus occur in a supercooled regime unless interactions between the inflaton and other degrees of freedom are additionally considered , as e.g.  in @xcite . in this work",
    ", we will henceforth neglect the effects of @xmath44 .",
    "the modified friedmann equation in the theories under study is written as @xcite : @xmath45 ~.\\ ] ] from the @xmath46 and the @xmath47 components of the modified field equations , we get @xcite : @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 is the reduced planck mass . we thus see that @xmath51 up to terms that depend on time derivatives of the scalar curvature @xmath2 and matter density @xmath52 , which vanish in the exact de sitter limit . defining the slow - roll parameters : @xmath53 and noting that @xmath54 , such that @xmath55 we conclude that a slow - roll regime where one can consistently neglect the time variation of @xmath52 and @xmath41 requires , as in gr , that the conditions @xmath56 are satisfied .    in this work",
    "we will focus on theories such that the pure gravitational sector of the action has the einstein - hilbert form , i.e. @xmath13 , so as to isolate the effects of the non - minimal coupling between matter and curvature . taking the slow - roll limit of the modified friedmann equation ( [ friedmann ] ) , for @xmath57",
    ", we then obtain : @xmath58 it is thus clear that the friedmann equation may have a different form depending on the inflaton energy density and on the form of the non - minimal matter - curvature coupling .",
    "in particular , we expect a different behaviour in the high and low densities regimes , as we will see in the next sections once we specify the form of @xmath3 .",
    "in addition , we note that the @xmath59-component of the field equations , for flat frw model for @xmath13 and @xmath20 is given by : @xmath60\\left(1 + 2\\frac{f_2p}{m_p^2}\\right ) = \\frac{f_2p}{m^2_p } + \\frac{2}{m_p^2}\\frac{\\delta_{ij}\\left(f_2p\\right)}{g_{ij}}-\\frac{1}{m_p^2}f_2pr~.\\ ] ] as seen above , for this cosmological model , @xmath61 and thus : @xmath60\\left(1-\\frac{f_2p}{m_p^2}\\right ) + 3h^2\\frac{f_2p}{m_p^2 } = \\frac{f_2p}{m^2_p}+\\frac{2}{m^2_pa^2}\\delta_{ij}\\left(f_2p\\right)~.\\ ] ] using the friedmann equation in the slow - roll regime , eq .",

    "is also unaffected in the slow - roll regime , so that we have for the dimensionless curvature power spectrum : @xmath72 as we have mentioned earlier , we are interested in non - minimal couplings that introduce modifications in the high curvature / density regime and reduce to gr in the low - density limit , in particular functions of the form @xmath73 for @xmath74 . since @xmath2 is quadratic in curvature and tensor perturbations , the non - minimal coupling will not modify the action for these perturbations at the leading quadratic order , such that the spectrum of tensor perturbations also retains its gr form : @xmath75      in the previous sections , we have seen that the main modification introduced by the non - minimal coupling in the slow - roll regime is a modified form of the friedmann equation .",
    "this motivates us to discuss in more detail the dynamics of inflation for a generic form @xmath76 , which may then be applied to different forms of the non - minimal coupling function @xmath3 , as well as in other scenarios where such modifications arise but where the slow - roll form of the inflaton s equation of motion , @xmath77 , is unaffected .",
