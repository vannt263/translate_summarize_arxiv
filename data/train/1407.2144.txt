    "cosmic rays ( crs ) are the most outstanding example of accelerated particles .",
    "understanding their origin and propagation through the interstellar medium is a fundamental problem which has a major impact on models of the structure and nature of the universe .",
    "the observed primary cr energy spectrum exceeds 10@xmath5 ev showing a few basic characteristics : ( a ) a power - law behaviour @xmath6 e@xmath7 until the so - called `` knee '' , a small downwards bend around few pev ; ( b ) a power - law behaviour @xmath6 e@xmath8 beyond the knee , with a slight dip near 10@xmath9 ev , sometimes referred to as the `` second knee '' ; ( c ) a transition back to a power - law @xmath6 e@xmath7 ( the `` ankle '' ) around @xmath10  ev ; ( d ) a cutoff due to extra - galactic cr interactions with the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) around 10@xmath5 ev ( the greisen - zatsepin - kuzmin effect ) .",
    "all these features are believed to carry fundamental information to shed light on the key question of the cr origin .",
    "crs below 10@xmath9 ev are expected to be mainly galactic , produced and accelerated in supernova ( sn ) blast waves , which can provide the necessary energy input and naturally produce particles with a power law energy spectrum and spectral index close to the value inferred from the observations .",
    "the sn acceleration mechanisms are limited by the rate at which the particles can gain energy and by the lifetime of the shock . as an example , for a typical sn , lagage and cesarsky @xcite calculated that this limit corresponds , for a particle of charge @xmath11 ( in natural units ) , to a total energy of @xmath12 10@xmath13 ev .",
    "as crs are mostly charged nuclei , their paths are deflected and highly isotropized by the action of galactic magnetic field ( gmf ) they propagate through before reaching the earth atmosphere .",
    "the gmf is the superposition of regular field lines and chaotic contributions .",
    "although the strength of the non - regular component is still under debate , the local total intensity is supposed to be @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "in such a field , the gyro - radius of crs is given by @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is in astronomic units and r@xmath17 is the rigidity in teravolt .",
    "clearly , there is very little chance of observing a point - like signal from any radiation source below @xmath18 , as they are known to be at least several hundreds parsecs away .",
    "if it is true that magnetic fields are the most important `` isotropizing '' factor when they randomly vary on short distances , it is clear as much that some particular features of the magnetic field at the boundary of the solar system or farther might focus crs along certain lines and the observed arrival direction distribution turns out to be consequently an - isotropic .",
    "as it will be discussed in this paper , different experiments observed an energy - dependent _ `` large scale '' _ anisotropy in the sidereal time frame with amplitude spanning 10@xmath2 to 10@xmath3 , from tens gev to hundreds tev , suggesting the existence of two distinct broad regions , one showing an excess of crs ( named _ `` tail - in '' _ ) , distributed around 40@xmath4 to 90@xmath4 in right ascension ( r.a . ) .",
    "the other a deficit ( the so - called _ `` loss cone '' _ ) , distributed around 150@xmath4 to 240@xmath4 in r.a ..    the origin of the galactic cr anisotropy is still unknown , but the study of its evolution over the energy spectrum has an important valence to understand the propagation mechanisms and the structure of the magnetic fields through which crs have traveled .    the propagation in the galaxy of crs trapped by the magnetic field is usually described in terms of diffusion at least up to 10@xmath19 ev @xcite .",
    "the gyro - radius of particles is smaller than the largest scale ( 100 - 300 pc ) on which the turbulent component of the gmf is believed to vary .",
    "therefore , the cr propagation resembles a random walk .",
    "the diffusion produces density gradients and thus an anisotropy as intense as @xmath20 takes place : @xmath20 = @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the particle velocity , @xmath23 the particle density and @xmath24 the diffusion coefficient expected to increase with the rigidity @xmath25 .",
    "the models proposed to describe the cr propagation adopt different dependence of @xmath24 with energy : @xmath26 in the `` leaky box '' approximation with a regular magnetic field @xcite ; @xmath27 , for models with re - acceleration and an additional random turbulent component of the gmf ; @xmath28 for models with a hall diffusion @xcite .",
    "a measurement of the evolution of anisotropy with the energy is therefore important to disentangle between different models of cr propagation in the galaxy .",
    "moreover , the study of the anisotropy can clarify the key problem of galactic crs , i.e. the origin of the knee .",
    "indeed , if the knee is due to an increasing inefficiency in cr containment in the galaxy a change in @xmath20 is expected .",
    "if , on the contrary , the knee is related to the inefficiency of the acceleration mechanism , we do not expect a change of anisotropy when nearing the knee .    around 10@xmath29 ev",
    "the gyro - radius of crs becomes comparable to the thickness of the galactic disk , therefore their confinement in the galaxy is less effective and the diffusive motion loses importance . as a consequence , if the cr sources are distributed mainly in the galactic plane , an increase of the anisotropy toward the galactic disk is expected , due to the proton component .    above 10@xmath29 ev ,",
    "the crs are believed to be extra - galactic . with increasing energy the _",
    "`` charged - particle astronomy '' _ becomes possible in principle , because the magnetic field should not affect significantly the cr propagation .",
    "nevertheless , the uncertainty about the extra - galactic magnetic field structures and about the cr chemical composition at that energy makes challenging to achieve significant results .",
    "although observations of anisotropy were reported up to energy around 10@xmath5 ev , in this paper we review measurements and models concerning crs below @xmath30 , where the counting rate of detectors is high enough to give solid arguments on which to ground the discussion .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the section [ sec : methods ]",
    "the detection methods used so far are summarized .",
    "the existing data on the cr anisotropy below the knee are reviewed in the section [ sec : datareview ] . in the section [ sec : models ]",
    "the different models proposed to interpret data are reported .",
    "some conclusions follow .",
    "the amplitude of the anisotropy is so small ( @xmath31 or less ) that the experimental approach to detect it has to be sensitive on necessity . in order to measure such a tiny effect ,",
    "large exposures are needed , i.e. large instrumented areas and long - lasting data acquisition campaigns . until now",
    ", only ground - based detectors demonstrated to have the required sensitivity , making use of the earth s rotation to order data in solar and sidereal time .",
    "as the earth rotates , the field of view of ground - based detectors points towards different directions at different times , sweeping out a cone of constant declination .",
    "the cr arrival direction is given after the definition of a reference frame .",
    "if sun - related effects are looked for , a system of coordinates co - moving with the earth has to be used .",
    "usually , it is a spherical system centered on the earth .",
    "instead , if phenomena originated outside the heliosphere are considered , a reference frame co - moving with the sun is set , usually a spherical system centered there .",
    "whatever the spherical system is , because of the earth rotation , the direction @xmath32 is periodically observed from ground - based detectors , that is why the @xmath32 axis is regarded as a time axis .",
    "the `` solar '' or `` universal '' time is used when the sun is wanted to be at rest in the reference frame , whereas the `` sidereal '' time is used when the galactic center is wanted to be at rest .",
    "the _ sidereal anisotropy _ is spoken about when the sidereal time is used , whereas the _ solar anisotropy _ is measured by using the solar time .",
    "the _ anti - sidereal _ time analysis is often performed too , as no signal is expected in this non - physical reference frame and any positive result there can be used as estimation of the systematic uncertainty on the sidereal time detection .    once the reference frame is defined , data are collected and ordered accordingly .",
    "there are a number of ways in which the degree of anisotropy of a given distribution can be defined .",
    "perhaps the most traditional one in cr physics is : @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the maximum and the minimum observed intensity .",
    "this definition is the most general to be given , as no hypothesis on the form of the anisotropy is needed : either it is a peak in a smooth distribution or a di - polar modulation , the definition ( [ eq : delta_anisotropy ] ) can be applied .    in 1975",
    "linsley proposed to perform analyses in right ascension only , through the so - called `` harmonic analysis '' of the counting rate within a defined declination band , given by the field of view of the detector @xcite .",
    "in general , one calculate the first and second harmonic from data by measuring the counting rate as a function of the sidereal time ( or right ascension ) , and fitting the result to a sine wave .",
    "the rayleigh formalism allows to evaluate the amplitude of the different harmonics , the corresponding phase ( the hour angle of the maximum intensity ) and the probability for detecting a spurious amplitude due to fluctuations of a uniform distribution .",
    "let @xmath36 be the right - ascension of the @xmath37 collected events . from this data series",
    ", the experimenter has to determine the components of the two - dimensional vector amplitude ( or , equivalently , the scalar amplitude @xmath38 and phase @xmath32 ) .",
    "the r.a.distribution @xmath39 can be represented with a fourier series : @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the fourier coefficients and @xmath43 @xmath44 are the amplitude and the phase of the @xmath45 harmonic , respectively .",
    "it is known that the fourier coefficients can be computed from the @xmath46 data series by means of the equations : @xmath47 @xmath48 where @xmath37 is the number of data points .",
    "this formalism can be applied up to whichever order @xmath49 , but historically experiments never had the sensitivity to go beyond @xmath50 and anthologies are usually compiled about @xmath51 only . if a non - zero first harmonic amplitude is found , it is important to estimate the chance probability @xmath52 that it is a fluctuation of an isotropic distribution . if the sample @xmath53 , @xmath54 , ... , @xmath55 is randomly distributed between 0 and 2@xmath56 , then , as @xmath57 , the probability @xmath52 of obtaining an amplitude greater than or equal to @xmath38 is given by the well - known rayleigh formula @xmath58 where @xmath59 .    in general , harmonic analysis is effective for revealing broad directional features in large samples of events measured with poor angular resolution but good stability .",
    "the technique is rather simple : the greatest difficulty lies in the treatment of the data , that is , of the counting rate themselves .",
    "in fact , the expected amplitudes are very small with related statistical problems : long term observations and large collecting areas are required .",
    "spurious effects must be kept as low as possible : uniform detector performance both over instrumented area and over time are necessary as well as operational stability .",
    "in addition , cr experiments typically suffer from large variations of atmospheric parameters as temperature and pressure , which translate into changes of the effective atmospheric depth , affecting the cr arrival rate .",
    "therefore , the measured rate must be corrected precisely for instrumental and atmospheric effects to prevent any misinterpretation of cr flux variations .",
    "the _ east - west method _ was designed to avoid performing such corrections , preventing potential subsequent systematic errors introduced by data analysis .",
    "the original idea was proposed in the early 1940s to study asymmetries in the flux of solar crs @xcite and was later applied by nagashima to extensive air showers ( eass ) at higher energy @xcite .",
    "it is a differential method , as it is based on the analysis of the difference of the counting rates in the east and west directions @xcite . by considering this , the method is able to eliminate any atmospheric effect or detector bias producing a common variation in both data groups .    for primary crs with energy",
    "lower than 10@xmath60 - 10@xmath61 ev , underground muon detectors have been widely used .",
    "the muon rate deep underground can be affected by a spurious periodic modulation as the result of the competition between pion decay and interaction in the upper atmosphere . as the atmosphere cools at night ( or during the winter ) , the density increases and the pions produced in cr collisions with the atmosphere are fractionally more likely to interact than decay when compared with the day ( or summer ) when the climate it is warmer .",
    "the daily modulation introduced by solar heating and cooling is seen when muons are binned in solar - diurnal time ; yearly or seasonal modulations are seen when events are binned with a period of a ( tropical ) year @xcite . with increasing energy an increasing fraction of high energy secondary pions",
    "interact in the higher atmosphere instead of decaying to muons and the muon intensities decrease too rapidly to yield sufficient statistics for high - energy primary crs .",
    "the detection of eass by employing ground detector arrays with large extensions ( from 10@xmath62 to 10@xmath63 m@xmath64 ) and long operation time ( up to 20 years ) , extended the anisotropy studies up the highest energy region .",
    "the information about the individual shower was very limited but the very high counting rate , in particular for arrays located at high altitude , made this energy range attractive for anisotropy studies .",
    "the observation of anisotropy effects at a level of 10@xmath2 with an eas array is a difficult job , because of how difficult is to control this kind of devices .",
    "a wrong estimation of the exposure may affect the cr arrival rate distribution , even creating artifacts ( i.e. fake excesses or deficit regions ) .",
    "in fact , drifts in detector response and atmospheric effects on air shower development are quite hard to be modeled to sufficient accuracy .",
    "the envisaged solution is to use the data to estimate the detector exposure , but data contain either signal and background events , so that some distortions could be present in the results .",
    "the shape and the size of possible artifacts depend on the characteristic angle and time scale over which all the aspects of the data acquisition vary more than the effect to be observed . therefore ,",
    "if an anisotropy of the order 10@xmath2 is looked for , operating conditions must be kept ( or made up ) stable down to this level , all across the field of view and during all the acquisition time . in addition , as it is well known , the partial sky coverage carried out by a given experiment will bias the observations of structure on largest scales .",
    "finally , the observation of a possible small angular scale anisotropy region contained inside a larger one relies on the capability for suppressing the anisotropic structures at larger scales without , simultaneously , introducing effects of the analysis on smaller scales .",
    "both multi - directional and uni - directional detectors have been widely used to investigate different declination intervals defined by the center direction of viewing of the telescopes .",
    "former experiments were not able to reconstruct the arrival direction of the primary , but the anisotropy induces periodicity in the response from a cr detector , having a fundamental frequency corresponding to the duration of a sidereal day .",
    "physicists exploited the rotation of the earth to build 1d distributions of the cr relative intensity . due to the poor statistics , any attempt to reconstruct the all - sky structure of the anisotropy was quite unrealistic and the only chance was to check if any strong statistical indication of a genuine cr intensity variation was there or not .    in the last decade ,",
    "some experiments have been able to reconstruct the primary arrival direction with good precision on large amount of data , thus allowing to build two - dimensional ( 2d ) maps of the anisotropy .",
    "when 2d sky maps are realized , excesses and deficits observed in one dimension appear to be localized and to have their own extension and morphology .",
    "any hypothesis about the correlation of the observed features with astrophysical sources can be confirmed or denied by the exact information on the direction .",
    "as 2d sky - maps for the cr anisotropy appeared only in the last few years , there is not any standard way to present data yet .",
    "data are usually compared on the basis of the position and the extension of the observed features , as well as on their relative intensity .",
    "recently , the icecube experiments introduced a multi - scale analysis in spherical harmonics @xcite .",
    "in the figure [ fig:1amplitude ] the amplitude and the phase of the first harmonic measured by different experiments starting since 1973 are shown as a function of the primary cr energy .",
    "a history of the experimental results is outlined in the next subsections .",
    "the earliest evidence of periodicity in the cr intensity was reported in 1932 by hess and steinmaurer @xcite , see the figure [ fig : hess ] .",
    "indeed , the question of a possible variation of the cosmic radiation flux with time arose soon after its discovery .",
    "this observation , interpreted by compton and getting ( cg ) as an effect of the earth motion relative to the sources of crs @xcite , stimulated many measurements to verify the cg model .    ]",
    "although different ground - based experiments reported evidence of a diurnal variation of galactic crs long before the 50s , solar modulation , the geomagnetic field and some atmospheric effects were considered a considerable obstacle for primary crs of energy less than @xmath65 ev .",
    "indeed , this energy range , mainly investigated by underground muon telescopes , turned out to be very critical to get clear evidence on the anisotropy of crs before they enter the solar cavity .",
    "variations due to the geomagnetic field or to the solar activity become negligible with increasing energy but , for a long time , the existence of the cr anisotropy in the multi - tev energy range remained uncertain .",
    "in fact , the amplitude of the temporal variation of the eas trigger rate ( a few percent ) , mostly due to the atmospheric pressure and temperature effects , is much larger than the expected amplitude of the galactic cr anisotropy .",
    "the additional problem of the low event rate with increasing energy led to a number of contradictory results ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .    only during 50s , when large detectors were operated underground or at the surface monitoring of the atmospheric variations , a clear evidence of the existence of the galactic anisotropy was obtained .    in 1954",
    "farley and storey @xcite published the results of the analysis of more than 10@xmath66 eas events recorded in auckland , in the southern hemisphere , with 3 counter trays at the corners of a 4 m - side triangle , in the period february 1951 - february 1952 .",
    "they reported a significant observation of solar and sidereal diurnal variations of the cr intensity . by introducing the concept of anti - sidereal time an allowance",
    "were made , for the first time , for the seasonal amplitude modulation of the solar diurnal variation .",
    "the comparison with two other experiments carried out in the northern hemisphere showed that the variations were in phase and the maxima coincident in local sidereal time .",
    "this gave important grounds for believing that the observed variation was a genuine sidereal effect and not a residual due to seasonal changes in the solar diurnal effect .    in 1957",
    "two large wide angle muon telescopes were installed under 18 m of sandstone near hobart @xcite in the southern hemisphere .",
    "the median primary energy was 1.8@xmath6710@xmath68 ev and the counting rate 7@xmath6710@xmath69 particles / hour .",
    "early in 1958 in the northern hemisphere two almost similar muon telescopes were operated at a similar depth underground in budapest @xcite .",
    "the combined analysis of the hobart - budapest data was very important to get evidence that the galactic anisotropy has higher order features besides the fundamental harmonic .",
    "observations of the sidereal daily variation revealed a latitude - dependent pattern in the first and second harmonics , as shown in the figure [ fig : hobartbuda ] . a 12-hour difference between the phase of maxima in the two hemispheres",
    "was observed , as well as larger semi - diurnal maxima at the low latitudes .",
    "n in hobart , ( c ) with vertical telescopes in hobart .",
    "the first and second harmonics of best fit are shown .",
    "the latitude angles are those of the asymptotic directions of viewing .",
    "the error tails shown are the standard errors of the fitted amplitudes . ]",
    "39@xmath4 , ( b ) from a narrow angle telescope inclined 70@xmath4 n of zenith , scanning an average northern latitude @xmath70 20@xmath4 .",
    "the first and second harmonics of best fit are shown .",
    "the error tails shown are the standard errors of fitted amplitudes.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    these results suggested the existence of a global galactic anisotropy consisting of a collinear types of bidirectional anisotropy and a smaller unidirectional anisotropy in line with it .",
    "the particular bidirectional type was indicated by the diurnal maxima in phase with one of the semi - diurnal maxima and the remarkable dependence on the latitude of the intensity of the semi - diurnal modulation .",
    "the fact that the diurnal amplitude in hobart was considerably larger than in budapest suggested the presence of a unidirectional diurnal variation in phase with the bidirectional component in hobart and therefore 12 hours out of phase with that in budapest @xcite .",
    "however , the 12-hour phase difference between the two hemispheres naturally suggests the possibility that the result is not due to a genuine sidereal anisotropy but to a spurious sidereal effect arising from the seasonal modulation of the solar daily variation of cr intensity . to test the difference between the two experiments a narrow angle telescope",
    "was installed in hobart pointing north at a sufficiently high angle ( 70@xmath4 ) to the zenith so as to view into the northern hemisphere .",
    "the telescope observed a sidereal daily variation not in phase with the vertical telescope in hobart , but with the budapest phase , see the figure [ fig : hobart ] , thus excluding the presence of a spurious component @xcite .",
    "a very large narrow angle air cerenkov telescopes operated in nagoya confirmed these results recording the variation of cr intensity at a median energy of about 2@xmath6710@xmath68 ev in the period 1968 - 1971 @xcite .",
    "further evidences came from a couple of narrow angle telescopes operated in mawson in 1968 @xcite .    from 1965",
    "onwards a great increase took place in the number and size of underground experiments . a highly significant development in the early 1970s was the start of observations of small air showers at a median energy around 10@xmath61 ev at mt .",
    "norikura in japan @xcite .",
    "in fact , the observations made in the energy range 10@xmath61 - 10@xmath71 ev until that moment did not give concrete evidence for the existence of the sidereal anisotropy due to several reasons .",
    "first , the counting rates attained was not sufficient to obtain the necessary accuracy of the order of 10@xmath2 .",
    "moreover , the experiments were carried out with no consideration of the stability of the apparatus , thus with dispersion of actual data far greater than the statistical one .    in the mt .",
    "norikura experiment these problems were worked around because the apparatus was a multi - directional telescope housed in an air - conditioned laboratory with daily temperature variation less than @xmath60.1@xmath4c . in this way , th effect of the temperature on the detector was controlled to be less than @xmath60.01% .",
    "the high counting rate ( @xmath645,000/hour ) was attained due to the large detector area and the high altitude location ( 2770 m a.s.l . ) . in addition , to reduce the atmospheric effects , especially that of external temperature variations , the observation of directional air showers ( east and west component ) was carried out utilizing the absorption effect of air showers by a 10 cm lead wall @xcite . the omni - directional norikura array measured a sidereal anisotropy consistent with the hobart - budapest results , thus making the scientific community",
    "confident that no significant spurious component had affected the experimental results .",
    "the importance of this measurement was due to its being the first directional - measurement of anisotropy ever .",
    "norikura observations were confirmed by other eas arrays from peak musala in bulgaria and from baksan in georgia , in the energy range 10@xmath61 - 10@xmath13 ev @xcite . in 1970s",
    "another important experiment , made of three vertical telescopes for muon detection , started operations in poatina , tasmania , at a median energy of about 5@xmath6710@xmath68 ev .",
    "other important results came from a group of large muon - directional plastic scintillator telescopes located at ground in nagoya and underground in misato and sakashita @xcite .    nevertheless , in spite of the progress in detection techniques , the reported amplitudes were so small in relation to factors affecting observations ( geomagnetic and helio - magnetic fields , solar modulations , temperature and pressure variations , low counting rates ) that their accuracy as a measure of the cr anisotropy remained in doubt for many years and the results not conclusive yet .",
    "the munich international cosmic ray conference ( icrc ) in 1975 marked a change in viewpoint regarding the cr arrival direction anisotropy @xcite .",
    "in fact , in three papers by gombosi et al .",
    "@xcite , nagashima et al .",
    "@xcite and fenton and fenton @xcite , the observation of a sidereal anisotropy seen with approximately the same amplitude ( @xmath6 0.07% ) and phase ( @xmath6 00 hr ra ) at approximately the same latitude in both hemispheres was reported in the energy interval 10@xmath60 - 10@xmath13 ev / nucleon .",
    "in addition , in this conference there was a clear experimental evidence that solar effects overwhelm the results of underground telescopes detecting muons produced by primary crs with energy less than @xmath7210@xmath60 ev / nucleon .",
    "such effects prevented any clear determination of the anisotropy from being made in this energy range @xcite .    in 1977",
    "linsley and watson reviewed the data on cr anisotropy pre-1965 in the energy range 10@xmath13 - 3@xmath7310@xmath9 ev concluding that the combined results can not be explained by random fluctuations or selection effects @xcite .    in the following years",
    "other measurements carried out at musala peak @xcite , mt norikura @xcite and in baksan @xcite provided additional confirmation of the existence of a sidereal cr anisotropy . in addition these results from eas - arrays in the energy range 10@xmath61 - 10@xmath13 ev were in good agreement with observations from experiments with underground muon telescopes around 10@xmath60 ev @xcite .    in 1983",
    "linsley concluded that the results obtained by a harmonic analysis in sidereal time `` should be accepted without any reservations about spurious effects of a statistical , instrumental or atmospheric nature .",
    "( ... ) the success of the small air shower experiments shows that the residual effect of instrumental instabilities can be held to 1 part in 10@xmath69 '' @xcite .    in the mid 80s ,",
    "new analysis techniques for underground muon observations were developed , to eliminate the spurious sidereal variation from the apparent variation .",
    "those methods were based on the observed anti - sidereal diurnal variation @xcite , which was demonstrated to be capable to eliminate effects on the low energy crs due to the reversal of the sun s polar magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the same methods were soon applied to the observation of eass conducted since 1970 with an air shower detector at mount norikura in japan ( median energy @xmath70 1.5@xmath6710@xmath61 ev ) .",
    "a significant sidereal diurnal variation at higher energy was observed , together with the strong evidence of semi - diurnal and tri - diurnal variations @xcite . as semi - diurnal and tri - diurnal",
    "modulations correspond to 180@xmath4 and 120@xmath4 periodicity respectively , excesses as wide as 60@xmath4 were found , showing some hints of sub - structures and medium scale features already at that time .",
    "a continuous observation of the 24 hr profile of the cr rate in sidereal time over 12 years revealed that the sidereal diurnal variation of 10 tev cr intensity exhibits a deficit with a minimum around 12 hr @xcite .",
    "a similar anisotropy was reported in those years by other experiments in the same energy region @xcite , and also down to @xmath74 ev , by underground muon detectors , with the same form and almost the same phase .    until this moment ,",
    "the observation of the galactic anisotropy was concerned with two types , unidirectional and bidirectional @xcite .",
    "they may occur independently of each other or as a component of a more complex global anisotropy .",
    "the unidirectional anisotropy can be produced by the motion of the solar system relative to a frame of reference in which the cr system can be regarded as isotropic ( the cg effect ) .",
    "the diurnal variation is symmetric , in the sense that it is the same at the same latitude in both hemispheres . on the contrary ,",
    "a bidirectional diurnal variation is asymmetric with respect to the hemisphere , since times of maximum will differ by 12 hr between northern and southern latitudes of observation . consequently ,",
    "if the total observed diurnal variation consists of superimposed unidirectional and bidirectional components they can be separately identified by taking the sum and difference of observations , made under the same detecting conditions , at the equal latitudes in both hemispheres .",
    "the unidirectional component is separated out in the sum of observations and the bidirectional one in the difference .    in 1998 nagashima , fujimoto , and jacklyn ( nfj hereafter ) reported the first comprehensive observation of a large angular scale anisotropy in the sub - tev crs arrival direction by combining data from different experiments in the northern and southern hemispheres @xcite .",
    "they analyzed data of the muon telescopes underground in sakashita and hobart ( median energies @xmath70 331 - 387 gev and @xmath70 184 gev , respectively ) , and at the nagoya ground station ( @xmath70 60 - 66 gev ) .",
    "data recorded with the small air shower array at mt .",
    "norikura were also used .",
    "the results obtained by the nfj analysis are shown in the figure [ fig : nfjobs ] .",

    "after this energy , the new contribution was observed to be less and less important , even if disappearing at @xmath610 tev ( mt norikura ) .",
    "nfj suggested that such a decrease is consistent with a signal related to the acceleration of particles arriving from the helio - tail direction , i.e. , @xmath6 6 hr in sidereal time .",
    "it was an indirect confirmation that higher energy particles are an ideal tool to investigate the galactic anisotropy , being insensitive to sun - related effects .    .",

    ", the excess and deficit cones were obtained by interpolating between one dimensional anisotropy measurements made in several different declination strips .",
    "the result was qualitative in nature because data were from different detector types ( shallow underground muon telescopes and surface eas array ) with large spread in energy sensitivity and different systematic uncertainties .",
    "the tail - in excess was recognized to be not symmetric along the r.a .",
    "direction and this result confirmed the discovery of the semi- and tri - diurnal variations ten years before .",
    "some long - period measurements from neutron s monitors did not observe any decrease of the tail - in excess amplitude during the reversal of the solar magnetic field from the negative to the positive polarity state ( 1989 ) .",
    "this result strengthened the hypothesis of the `` helio - spheric '' origin of the phenomenon , against the `` galactic '' one @xcite .",
    "the positive pole of the di - polar anisotropy slightly overlaps with the tail - in zone , what makes the deficit di - polar region more evident alone .",
    "this region is often referred as _",
    "`` loss - cone''_.    the discovery of the tail - in gave an important piece for the solution of the problem of the observed phase shift in the sidereal diurnal variation , from 6 to 0 hours with the increase of the energy .",
    "in fact , nfj explained the phenomenology by distinct contributions from two anisotropies .",
    "the amplitude of the tail - in anisotropy , with a maximum at @xmath6 6 hr in sidereal time , decreases with increasing primary energy above @xmath6 1 tev , while the galactic anisotropy , with a minimum at @xmath6 12 hr , remains constant .",
    "furthermore , nfj suggested that the phase of the composite first harmonic vector turns counterclockwise from @xmath6 3 to @xmath6 0 hr with increasing energy ( the composite amplitude is also expected to decrease by @xmath6 30% when the amplitudes of two anisotropy components are equal at @xmath72 1 tev ) .    finally , it was clearly demonstrated that the observed sidereal variation was not compatible with the cg effect expected from the motion of the solar system in the interstellar space .",
    "the authors drew the conclusion that the solar system drags with it in its motion the surrounding interstellar magnetic field within which the crs with low energy are isotropically confined .",
    "the work @xcite was so important to make the `` tail - in '' and `` loss - cone '' names used by the scientific community , although there is no agreement yet about their origin .",
    "a detailed analysis of the sidereal diurnal modulations observed in a total of 48 directional channels of the underground muon detectors monitoring both the northern and southern sky indicated that the maximum phase of the new anisotropy component , which is @xmath66 hr in the northern hemisphere , shifts toward earlier times as the declination of the incident crs moves southward to the equator @xcite .    in 1996",
    "the eas - top collaboration reported a detailed analysis of high energy cr anisotropy at @xmath76 ev .",
    "data were analyzed in solar , sidereal and anti - sidereal time using the east - west method , see the figure [ fig : eastop ] . a signal compatible with the cg effect",

    "the eas - top collaboration reported the first evidence ever of anisotropy around 400 tev @xcite .",
    "hints of increasing amplitude and change of phase above 100 tev resulted from the analysis of the full data set , as shown in the figure [ fig_eastop400 t ] .    in the same period",
    "the underground macro experiment , measuring @xmath7810 tev muons , found evidence for modulations ( @xmath79 ) in solar and sidereal diurnal periods , at the limit of the detector statistics .",
    "the solar diurnal modulation was attributed to the daily atmospheric temperature variations at 20 km , the altitude of primary cr interaction with the atmosphere @xcite .    from the measurements done by `` old '' experiments ( see @xcite for a review )",
    "it was claimed that the amplitude of the first harmonic increases with increasing energy , starting from 10@xmath71 ev .",
    "the phase too seemed to be energy dependent , with changes correlated with the galactic structure .",
    "however , the statistical uncertainty was too large to drew any conclusions .",
    "in fact , the anisotropy apparent amplitude naturally increases as the number of events decreases ( i.e. , as the energy increases ) , as a simple consequence of ( lack of ) statistics : @xmath20 = ( i@xmath80 - i@xmath81)/(i@xmath80 + i@xmath81 ) @xmath82 n@xmath83/n = 1/n@xmath83 @xcite .    in 2004",
    "the kascade experiment presented an analysis of the cr anisotropy in the pev energy range .",

    "distributions were reported and upper limits for the rayleigh amplitude between 10@xmath3 at a primary energy of 0.7 pev and 10@xmath84 at 6 pev were set , see the figure [ fig : kascade ] @xcite .",
    "the eas - top collaboration in 2003 published a measurement of the first harmonic parameters up to 1.2 pev @xcite .",
    "the amplitudes are shown in the figure [ fig : kascade ] .",
    "since the signal above 300 tev was not statistically significant , they set upper limits ranging between 4@xmath7310@xmath2 at 0.3 pev and 2@xmath7310@xmath3 at 1.2 pev .",
    "we recall what already mentioned in this section , i.e. in 2009 the eas - top collaboration published a new analysis providing the amplitude and phase of the first harmonic at 370 tev .",
    "the eas - top and kascade experiments did not confirm the increase of anisotropy with energy ( from 10@xmath71 ev upward ) claimed by old eas arrays , though limited statistics still prevents to draw any firm conclusion .",
    "based on a harmonic analysis , these observations are consistent with the large - scale diffusive propagation of crs in the galaxy @xcite , but there was no consensus for a production mechanism in the local interstellar region surrounding the heliosphere that would reproduce the sidereal diurnal variation .",
    "in fact , although a general view of the situation could be obtained by merging data from different experiments ( e.g. , see the figure [ fig : nfjmodel ] ) the lack of homogeneous ( i.e. , one - experiment ) information on the dependence of the anisotropy on declination impeded a complete experimental formulation of the problem @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the 24 hr profile and its declination dependence can be measured _ together _ only with direction - sensitive devices .    in the last decade",

    "the panels ( a ) and ( b ) of figure [ fig : tibet05 ] show the full 24 hr profile of the sidereal diurnal variation averaged over all declinations and primary energies , together with the results of the mt norikura eas array , which was not capable of resolving the declination of the incident direction .",
    "the tibet as@xmath85 results are in good agreement with the norikura profile , if the average over all declinations is considered .",
    "the importance of this new result became even clearer when looking at the panel ( c ) , where the sidereal profiles in each declination band separately are shown .",
    "the phase of maximum changes from @xmath6 7 to @xmath6 4 hr in sidereal time , and the amplitude of the excess increases as the viewing direction moves from the northern hemisphere to the equatorial region .",
    "this is consistent with the anisotropy component firstly found in the sub - tev region by underground muon detectors and referred to as tail - in anisotropy .",
    "the tibet as@xmath85 experiment clearly showed that the tail - in anisotropy continues to exist in the multi - tev region , what have deep implications for all models of cr acceleration and propagation providing predictions on the anisotropy .",

    "the global anisotropy is dominated by the dipole and quadrupole components @xcite . at higher energies the non - dipolar structure of the anisotropy challenges the current models of cosmic ray diffusion .",
    "whether the strengthening of the deficit region with energy is due to propagation effects from a given source or to the contribution of heavier nuclei at the knee is not clear . in this regard , the study of cosmic ray spectrum and composition in correlation to the anisotropy and vice - versa of the anisotropy for different primary particle masses , would provide an experimental basis to test scenarios of particle transport in the local interstellar medium @xcite .      in 2007 , modeling the large scale anisotropy of 5 tev cr , the tibet - as@xmath85 collaboration ran into a `` skewed '' feature over - imposed to the broad structure of the so - called tail - in region @xcite .",

    "the modulations show that the observations follow the scg model at 6.7 tev ( right panel ) , but some deviations are there at lower energy , 3.8 tev ( left panel ) .",
    "this finding suggested that some related effects may influence the cr arrival direction distribution also in the few tev energy region @xcite .    in spite of these successful results about the scg",
    ", the arrival distribution in sidereal time was never found to be purely di - polar , neither any signature of the gcg effect was ever observed in sidereal time .",
    "consequently , the cr plasma is supposed to co - move with the solar system and the origin of the observed anisotropy is thought to be related to `` harder '' effects , to be searched for in unknown features of the local interstellar medium ( lism ) , either for the magnetic field and the closest cr sources .",
    "some authors suggested that the large scale anisotropy can be explained within the diffusion approximation taking into account the role of the few most nearby and recent sources @xcite .",
    "other studies suggest that a non - di - polar anisotropy could be due to a combined effect of the regular and turbulent gmf @xcite , or to local uni- and bi - dimensional inflows @xcite .",
    "in particular the authors modeled the observed anisotropy by a superposition of a large , global anisotropy and a midscale one .",
    "the first one is proposed to be generated by galactic crs interacting with the magnetic field in the local interstellar space surrounding the heliosphere ( scale @xmath62 pc ) .",
    "the midscale anisotropy is possibly caused by a modulation of galactic crs in the helio - tail @xcite .",
    "the highest energy observations by eas - top and icecube @xcite of the existence of a new anisotropy around 400 tev suggest that the global anisotropy is the superposition of different contributions due to phenomenologies at different distances from the earth @xcite .",
    "a possible underlying anisotropy due to the cr sources distribution seems to manifest itself at energies above 100 tev , being at lower energies the proton gyro - radius of the same order of the helio - tail @xcite .",
    "therefore , probably in the one hundred tev energy region we are observing a transition in the cause of the anisotropy , being mainly due to local solar effects the lower energy phenomenology .    about the medium scale anisotropy",
    ", no theory of crs in the galaxy exists yet which is able to explain few degrees anisotropies in the rigidity region 1 - 10 tv leaving the standard model of crs and that of the local galactic magnetic field unchanged at the same time .",
    "first interpretations based on observing the excess are inside the `` tail - in '' zone , that induced authors to drag in interactions of crs with the heliosphere@xcite .",
    "several authors , noticing that the tev region is usually free of heliosphere - induced effects , proposed a model where the excesses are produced in the geminga supernova explosion @xcite . in the first variant of the model crs simply diffuse ( bohm regime ) up to the solar system , while the second version limits the diffusion to the very first phase of the process and appeals to non - standard diverging magnetic field structure to bring them to the earth .",
    "other people @xcite proposed similar schemes involving local sources and magnetic traps guiding crs to the earth . it must be noticed that sources are always intended to be near - by , at less than 100 - 200 pc .",
    "moreover the position of the excesses in galactic coordinates , symmetrical with respect to the galactic plane , played an important role in inspiring such models .",
    "grounding on the observation that all nearby sources and new magnetic structures brought in to explain the medium scale anisotropy should imply other experimental signatures that would have been observed in the past , some other models were proposed . in @xcite",
    "the authors suggest that the magnetic field in the helio - tail ( that is , within @xmath670 au to @xmath6340 au from the sun ) is responsible for the observed midscale anisotropy in the energy range of 1 - 30 tev .",
    "in particular , this effect is expressed as two intensity enhancements placed along the hydrogen deflection plane , each symmetrically centered away from the helio - tail direction .",
    "the hypothesis that the effect could be related to the interaction of isotropic crs with the heliosphere has been re - proposed in @xcite .",
    "grounding on the coincidence of the most significant localized regions with the helio - spheric tail , magnetic reconnection in the magneto - tail has been shown to account for beaming particles up to tev energies . on a similar line , in @xcite",
    "the authors suggest that even the large scale anisotropy below 100 tev is mostly due to particle interactions with the turbulent ripples generated by the interaction of the helio - spheric and interstellar magnetic field",
    ". this interaction could be the dominant factor that re - distribute the large scale anisotropy from an underlying existent anisotropy . at the same time",
    ", such scattering can produce small angular scale features along line of sights that are almost perpendicular to the local interstellar magnetic fields .",
    "recently , the role of interactions of tev - pev crs with a turbulent magnetic field across they propagate through has been emphasized to explain the small scale anisotropy @xcite .",
    "the authors show that energy - dependent medium and small scale anisotropies necessarily appear , provided that there exists a large scale di - polar anisotropy , for instance from the inhomogeneous source distribution .",
    "the small scale anisotropies naturally arise from the structure of the local turbulent gmf , typically within the cr scattering length .",
    "there has been also the suggestion that crs might be scattered by strongly anisotropic alfven waves originating from turbulence across the local field direction @xcite .    besides all these `` ad hoc '' interpretations , several attempts occurred in trying to insert the cr excesses in the framework of recent discoveries from satellite - borne experiments , mostly as far as leptons are concerned . in principle",
    "there is no objection in stating that few - degree cr anisotropies are related to the positron excess observed by pamela @xcite and to the electrons excess observed by fermi @xcite .",
    "all observations can be looked at as different signatures of common underlying physical phenomena .",
    "the cosmic ray arrival direction distribution and its anisotropy has been a long - standing problem ever since the 1930s .",
    "in fact , the study of the anisotropy is a powerful tool to investigate the acceleration and propagation mechanism determining the cr world as we know it . nonetheless , with respect to other classics of cr physics , fewer experiments managed to get significant results , due to the small intensity of the effect .    from the theoretical viewpoint ,",
    "apart from some effects of kinetic nature ( scg and gcg effect ) , no signal is expected either in the sidereal and the solar time reference frame .",
    "if the energy is high enough , i.e. solar effects are negligible , the standard model of production , acceleration and propagation of crs does not foresee any deviation from the isotropy . in this picture of the outer space , a major role",
    "is played by the magnetic fields the crs pass through before touching the earth atmosphere .",
    "when the energy increases enough , a weak dipole may arise , as a mild signature of the closest and most recent cr sources .",
    "current experimental results show that the main features of the anisotropy are uniform in the energy range ( 10@xmath68 - 10@xmath13 ev ) , both with respect to amplitude ( 10@xmath2 - 10@xmath3 ) and phase ( ( 0 - 4 ) hr ) .",
    "the existence of two distinct broad regions , one showing an excess of crs ( called `` tail - in '' ) , distributed around 40@xmath4 to 90@xmath4 in r.a . , the other a deficit ( the `` loss cone '' ) , distributed around 150@xmath4 to 240@xmath4 in r.a .",
    ", has been clearly observed .",
    "the framework became clearer in the last decade , when more and more experiments demonstrated to have the capability of drawing 2d sky - maps , thus giving to the scientific community the evidence of localized regions whose physical nature is still unknown .    in the last years the milagro and argo - ybj collaborations reported evidence of the existence of a medium angular scale anisotropy contained in the tail - in region .",
    "the observation of similar small scale anisotropies has been recently claimed also by the icecube experiment in the southern hemisphere .",
    "so far , no theory of crs in the galaxy exists which is able to explain both large scale and few degrees anisotropies leaving the standard model of crs and that of the local galactic magnetic field unchanged at the same time .    a joint analysis of concurrent data recorded by different experiments in both hemispheres , as well as a correlation with other observables like the interstellar energetic neutral atoms distribution @xcite , should be a high priority to clarify the observations .",

    "<S> the measurement of the anisotropy in the arrival direction of cosmic rays is complementary to the study of their energy spectrum and chemical composition to understand their origin and propagation . </S>",
    "<S> it is also a tool to probe the structure of the magnetic fields through which cosmic rays travel .    </S>",
    "<S> as cosmic rays are mostly charged nuclei , their trajectories are deflected by the action of galactic magnetic field they propagate through before reaching the earth atmosphere , so that their detection carries directional information only up to distances as large as their gyro - radius . if cosmic rays below @xmath0 are considered and the local galactic magnetic field ( @xmath1 ) is accounted for , gyro - radii are so short that isotropy is expected . at most , </S>",
    "<S> a weak di - polar distribution may exist , reflecting the contribution of the closest cr sources .    however , a number of experiments observed an energy - dependent _ `` large scale '' _ anisotropy in the sidereal time frame with an amplitude of about 10@xmath2 - 10@xmath3 , revealing the existence of two distinct broad regions : an excess distributed around 40@xmath4 to 90@xmath4 in right ascension ( commonly referred to as `` tail.in '' excess ) and a deficit ( the `` loss cone '' ) around 150@xmath4 to 240@xmath4 in right ascension . in recent years </S>",
    "<S> the milagro and argo - ybj collaborations reported the of a `` medium '' scale anisotropy inside the tail - in region . </S>",
    "<S> the observation of such small features has been recently claimed by the icecube experiment also in the southern hemisphere .    </S>",
    "<S> so far , no theory of cosmic rays in the galaxy exists which is able to explain the origin of these different anisotropies leaving the standard model of cosmic rays and that of the galactic magnetic field unchanged at the same time .    </S>",
    "<S> although observations of the cr anisotropy were reported up to 10@xmath5 ev , this work is focused on the energy range below @xmath0 , where the counting rates of the detectors are high enough and the evidence for the anisotropy well established . </S>"
