    "the global structure of the heliosphere is determined in large part by the local ism flow vector in the rest frame of the sun .",
    "older determinations of this vector , particularly those based on measurements of interstellar he flowing through the inner heliosphere by the gas instrument on _ ulysses _ , have recently been challenged by new measurements of the he flow by the _",
    "interstellar boundary explorer _ ( ibex ) .",
    "the canonical _ ulysses _ analysis of @xcite suggested the following he flow parameters : @xmath11 km  s@xmath2 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14  k ; where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the ecliptic longitude and latitude direction in j2000 coordinates .",
    "in contrast , ibex data recently yielded the following flow properties @xcite : @xmath15 km  s@xmath2 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18  k. significant inconsistencies exist between the _ ulysses _ and ibex measurements , particularly for @xmath19 and @xmath7 .",
    "the lower @xmath19 value of ibex is of particular interest , as it may imply the nonexistence of a bow shock around the heliosphere .",
    "the @xmath20 km  s@xmath2 interstellar flow speed happens to imply a fast magnetosonic mach number of @xmath21 , making the existence or nonexistence of a bow shock around the heliosphere very much an open question .",
    "uncertainties in the strength and orientation of the interstellar magnetic field , @xmath22 , represent one obstacle in determining whether a bow shock exists .",
    "the higher @xmath22 is ( and the more perpendicular to the ism flow ) , the lower @xmath23 should be , and the less likely there is to be a bow shock . but uncertainties in @xmath19 are also important .    for many years",
    "the best assessments of ism velocity suggested @xmath24 km  s@xmath2 , not only the _",
    "ulysses_/gas measurements @xcite but measurements from ism absorption lines as well ( @xmath25 km  s@xmath2 ; lallement & bertin 1992 ) . with these relatively high values",
    ", heliospheric modelers favored @xmath26 , implying the existence of a bow shock .",
    "however , not only has the new ibex measurement called this into question , but so has one reanalysis of ism absorption line data @xcite , which suggests @xmath27 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "the lower @xmath28 km  s@xmath2 values reported recently have been enough for many to argue that @xmath29 should be preferred @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite argue that including he@xmath30 density in the calculation of alfvn speeds instead of just assuming a pure proton plasma would still suggest @xmath26 even if @xmath31 km  s@xmath2 . on the other hand , @xcite",
    "note that charge exchange processes may turn the bow shock into more of a `` bow wave '' even if @xmath26 .    in any case",
    ", the existence or nonexistence of a heliospheric bow shock is one issue driving interest in whether the he flow vector of _ ulysses _ or that of ibex is to be preferred . assuming that the ism cloud around the sun is nonrigid , @xcite have reanalyzed ism absorption line data and infer cloud kinematics more consistent with the _ ulysses _ velocity being valid close to the sun .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite have recently made additional arguments in favor of the older _ ulysses _ vector , implying that the ibex measurements must somehow be in error .",
    "@xcite propose a very different solution .",
    "they propose that the local ism flow actually varies with time , and that these variations are responsible for the _ ulysses_/ibex discrepancy .",
    "however , observations of interstellar h from the solar wind anisotropies instrument on the _ solar and heliospheric observatory _ and the space telescope imaging spectrograph instrument on the _ hubble space telescope _ do not provide support for a variable ism flow vector @xcite .    all this attention on",
    "the he flow vector provides motivation for taking another long look at the old _",
    "ulysses_/gas data , in order to see if a new , independent analysis confirms the @xcite results , and to see if there is any evidence for he flow variability in the _ ulysses _ data that would support the @xcite interpretation favoring a variable ism flow vector .",
    "further justification is that while the @xcite analysis considered data taken from 19902002 , later data acquired up until the end of the _ ulysses _ mission in 2007 were not considered .",
    "@xcite have recently analyzed a couple of _ ulysses _ he beam maps , including one from 2007 , demonstrating that the new ibex he vector can not reproduce either map .",
    "they also note that the @xcite vector might in principle be able to fit the ibex data if the temperature is allowed to be @xmath32  k , consistent with more extensive ibex analyses @xcite .",
    "we here present our own comprehensive reanalysis of the full _",
    "ulysses_/gas data set , providing a new assessment of the he flow vector using analysis techniques developed independently from both the original _",
    "ulysses_/gas team @xcite and the ibex team @xcite .",
    "launched in 1990 october , the primary mission of the _ ulysses _ spacecraft was to study various interplanetary constituents like the solar wind , magnetic fields , radio waves , dust , solar and galactic cosmic rays , etc .  outside the ecliptic plane in an orbit passing over the solar poles",
    "this orbit was accomplished with a gravitational assist from jupiter in 1992 february , leading to an orbit nearly perpendicular to the ecliptic plane , with an aphelion near jupiter s distance of 5  au , and a perihelion near 1  au .",
    "_ ulysses _ continued to make observations from this orbit until the mission ended in late 2007 .",
    "the _ ulysses_/gas instrument , described in detail by @xcite , was designed primarily to study interstellar neutral he atoms flowing through the inner heliosphere .",
    "neutral helium provides the best diagnostic of the undisturbed ism flow due to the high abundance of helium , and due to the fact that helium is not greatly affected by charge exchange during its journey through the outer heliosphere , in contrast to hydrogen and oxygen , for example .",
    "the first he observations were made by _",
    "ulysses_/gas during its cruise phase out to jupiter ( 19901992 ) .",
    "these data were first studied by @xcite . however , in this paper we will focus on data taken during the operational phase of the _ ulysses _ mission , with _",
    "ulysses _ in its polar orbit after the jupiter encounter . these he data are generally of higher quality than the cruise phase data @xcite , with better sampling of the he beam .",
    "additional advantages of the operations phase data will become very clear below .",
    "successful detection of interstellar he required that the inflow velocity be high enough for the he atoms to exceed the particle detection threshold of the gas instrument . with the _ ulysses _ orbital plane being basically perpendicular to the ism flow vector , the detectability of he depended mostly on the spacecraft velocity . only when _",
    "ulysses _ was in the near - sun part of its orbit was the spacecraft traveling rapidly enough so that the incoming he had sufficient energy to exceed the detection threshold .",
    "thus , the _",
    "ulysses_/gas he observations were confined to the three fast latitude scans made by _",
    "ulysses _ , in the periods 19941996 , 20002002 , and 20062007 .",
    "these are the three epochs that we will focus on here .",
    "@xcite considered the first two epochs of observations , but not the last epoch .",
    "the gas device works essentially like a pin - hole camera with a single - element detector , so observing the he beam requires making many different exposures in different directions to fully map out the count rate distribution .",
    "the _ ulysses _ spin axis , which was always pointed towards earth , defined how this was done .",
    "_ ulysses _ had a rotation period of 12  s. during this period , the gas instrument would observe at a particular elevation angle , measured relative to the spin axis , mapping out a ring on the celestial sphere .",
    "detected counts were accumulated in 32 bins , which could uniformly cover the full @xmath33 rotation ; or more commonly cover smaller arcs of @xmath34 , @xmath35 , or @xmath36 . after a period of typically 68  min , the elevation angle scanned by gas would be changed by a step of @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , or @xmath40 ; allowing another arc to be observed . over the course of @xmath41 days , typically , a full scan across the he beam would be completed , and a new map begun .",
    "the gas instrument actually utilized two different channels with independent detectors , one with a wide field of view ( wfov ) and one with a narrow field of view ( nfov ) , and both channels were exposed simultaneously .",
    "over the course of the three fast latitude scans mentioned above , _",
    "ulysses _ obtained @xmath42 wfov maps and @xmath43 nfov maps .",
    "we will be working almost exclusively with the wfov data here , which have higher signal - to - noise ( s / n ) than the nfov maps .",
    "figure  1 shows a typical wfov map , from 2001  january  24 .",
    "the gas instrument suffers from some sensitivity to uv emission even when in its particle detection mode @xcite , so some hot stars are visible in the map , in addition to the broad he beam .",
    "the stars can be inconvenient if blended with the he beam , but are actually useful as calibrators of pointing accuracy otherwise .",
    "in this article we will in fact be using a recent recalibration of the _ ulysses_/gas data set making extensive use of the stars as pointing calibrators , which is described in more detail by @xcite .",
    "in an end - to - end test , the calibration of the direction determination was adjusted so that the positions of stars observed by the instrument coincided with their astronomical position . based on many more star observations from the whole mission a minor further adjustment of a few tenth of a degree was required and subsequently all he data were reprocessed in 2013 with this new calibration .",
    "this recalibration provides yet another motivation for reanalyzing these data , though the change in the data is modest .",
    "note that although the archival _ ulysses _ data , and its original analyses reported in the witte et al .",
    "series of papers , are in b1950 coordinates , the numbers and figures we provide in this article will be in the more modern j2000 system .",
    "a final distinction to be made is that we will only be considering observations of the so - called `` direct beam '' formed by he atoms that flow directly to the detector ( with modest gravitational deflection ) , as opposed to the `` indirect beam '' created by particles that go around the sun and are gravitationally redirected back towards the detector , arriving from a very different direction than the direct beam atoms .",
    "the indirect beam is much fainter than the direct beam due to massive photoionization and electron - impact ionization losses that occur when these particles pass close to the sun .",
    "_ ulysses _ has nevertheless detected the indirect beam in observations from 1995 @xcite , but we will not be considering those data here .",
    "rather than immediately try to extract a he flow vector from the data , which requires a somewhat complex forward modeling analysis ( see sections 4 and 5 ) , we find it worthwhile to first make some purely empirical investigations of the beam .",
    "the primary motivation for this is to look for any evidence that the beam is changing at all during the 1994 - 2007 time period .",
    "we quantify the properties of the beam using 2-d gaussian fits to the beam , as mapped into ecliptic coordinates ( as in figure  1 ) .",
    "note that there is no physical reason the beam should be precisely gaussian , but in practice the beams observed by _",
    "ulysses _ are reasonably gaussian in shape , so this is a practical way to quantify them .",
    "an example gaussian fit is shown in figure  2 .",
    "there are six free parameters of such a fit : the central longitude and latitude , the latitudinal and longitudinal widths [ specifically the full - width - at - half - maximum ( fwhm ) ] , the count rate amplitude at beam center , and a background count rate ; where we assume a flat background underneath the he beam .    in the following discussion , we make use of an orbital phase for _ ulysses _ , @xmath44 , based on the angle defined by the positions of the spacecraft and the sun , and the location of the ecliptic plane crossing near aphelion . in this system ,",
    "the ecliptic plane crossing near aphelion at ecliptic coordinates ( @xmath7,@xmath8)=(@xmath45,@xmath46 ) is at @xmath47 , and that near perihelion at ( @xmath48,@xmath46 ) is at @xmath49 .",
    "the @xmath50 and @xmath51 orbital phases correspond to the near south pole and near north pole locations ( relative to the sun ) , so _",
    "ulysses _ is below the ecliptic at @xmath52 and above it at @xmath53 .",
    "( _ ulysses _ travels from south to north during its fast latitude scans . )",
    "the gaussian fits are performed using a semi - automated procedure , but all the fits are visually verified .",
    "many beam maps end up being excluded for various reasons . at @xmath54 and @xmath55 the data are simply deemed too noisy .",
    "observations with @xmath56 are excluded due to contamination from a star ( specifically the rightmost star seen in figure  1 ) .",
    "some maps are excluded for having a background that is not flat , possibly due to solar activity at that time .",
    "the most common reason for exclusion is simply that some scans did not fully cover the he beam .",
    "we only want to consider beam maps where the scan fully encompasses the he beam .",
    "ultimately , fits are accepted for 234 nfov maps and 238 wfov maps , including the map in figure  1 .",
    "as mentioned above , we will be focusing on the higher s / n wfov data , but we always do verify that results are not different when considering the nfov data instead .",
    "the gaussian fit parameters of the wfov maps are plotted in figures  3 and 4 .",
    "figure  3a shows that the he beam traces out a horseshoe pattern in the sky during a fast latitude scan .",
    "performing polynomial fits to longitude and latitude as a function of orbital phase allows us to define the average beam location illustrated in figure  3a .",
    "we will emphasize below how the shape of this horseshoe is a powerful diagnostic for the he flow parameters .",
    "figure  3a demonstrates that basically the same horseshoe pattern is made during all three fast latitude scans , showing little indication for variation in beam location .",
    "figures  3b - d provide a better indication for the deviations of beam position about the average .",
    "the scatter of the data points is indicative of the measurement uncertainties , but some systematic deviations are discernible despite the scatter .",
    "for example , the beam longitude appears to be lower during epoch 3 by a few tenths of a degree .",
    "the beam latitude is also a few tenths of a degree lower during epoch 3 , but only for @xmath57 .",
    "the latitudes observed during epochs 1 and 2 are discrepant for @xmath58 .    of particular interest",
    "are longitude variations , as it is in longitude that the ibex and _ ulysses _ flow vectors are in disagreement , and it is in longitude that @xcite claim evidence for a systematic increase with time .",
    "there is , however , no evidence for any increase in longitude during the _ ulysses _ era , with the epoch 3 data suggesting if anything a slight _ decrease _ , as noted above .",
    "the average discrepancy in figure  3d is @xmath59 .",
    "this can be interpreted as an estimate of the pointing uncertainties inherent in the _ ulysses _ data , consistent with expectations based on the pointing calibration done using stars @xcite .    in any case",
    ", the longitude variations in figure  3b are much smaller than the @xmath60 discrepancy in longitude between the ibex and _ ulysses _ he flow vectors .",
    "we conclude that there is no indication from the _ ulysses _ data to support the notion that he flow variability is responsible for the ibex/_ulysses _ discrepancy .",
    "furthermore , given that we now know that the 2007 _ ulysses _ data are not more consistent with the ibex results than the older data , there is only a 2 year time gap between the _ ulysses _ and ibex eras for the he flow to have changed so significantly .",
    "figures  4c - d also demonstrate that there is no evidence for any significant change in the he beam shape from 19942007 .",
    "the latitudinal and longitudinal beam widths change with orbital phase , but the same sort of variation is observed during all three fast latitude scans .",
    "figures  4a - b show that the three epochs do , however , exhibit noticeable differences in background and beam amplitude . the _",
    "ulysses_/gas background is a complicated mix of solar and cosmic sources , and we will not discuss it much here , other than to note that both orbital phase and epochal variations are indicated by figure  4b .",
    "as for the beam count rate amplitude in figure  4a , it naturally peaks near @xmath49 during each fast latitude scan , as that is when the spacecraft is moving fastest . the different count rate levels observed during the three epochs",
    "are most naturally interpreted as being indicative of variations in the solar euv photoionization rate .",
    "it makes perfect sense for epoch 2 ( 20002002 ) to have the lowest he fluxes , as this is a time near solar maximum , with high photoionization rates and therefore substantial losses of neutral he due to photoionization . in contrast , epochs 1 and 3 are both near solar minimum , thereby minimizing photoionization losses .",
    "we will return to the related issues of photoionization and he density , @xmath61 , in section  5 .",
    "the simple quantification of the he beam properties provided by the gaussian fitting in the previous section is not helpful for actually inferring a he flow vector from he beam maps , which instead requires a forward modeling approach . in this procedure",
    ", a maxwellian he velocity distribution is assumed at infinity , characterized by five parameters ( @xmath61 , v@xmath62 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , t ) , and then this maxwellian is propagated to the position of the spacecraft .",
    "the distribution will be primarily affected by the sun s gravitational influence .",
    "loss processes can also be accounted for in this forward modeling , the most important being photoionization by solar euv photons .",
    "we will initially ignore photoionization in our forward modeling , but we will consider it later to see if it changes our inferred he flow parameters .    the forward modeling method utilized in the original _",
    "ulysses_/gas team analyses is described by @xcite .",
    "our forward modeling routine , which is described in detail elsewhere @xcite , involves a rather different approach to the problem than the usual method involving numerical integration from infinity . in our computations ,",
    "quantities that are conserved along a trajectory , such as total energy , angular momentum , eccentricity , and direction of perihelion , are used to determine in one algebraic step the neutral he velocity at a desired point in space when its velocity at infinity is given .",
    "conversely , when both location and velocity of a he atom are given , the conservation equations dictate a unique corresponding velocity at infinity .",
    "the entire phase space distribution , f(*v * ) , can be calculated at a desired point in the inner heliosphere by decomposing the problem into a family of trajectories with different velocities ( different conserved quantities ) that all converge at the chosen point . by assuming a thermal maxwellian as the original distribution at infinity , each of those trajectories",
    "can then be assigned its corresponding phase space density , yielding f(*v * ) at the point of interest @xcite .",
    "computing count rates in a given direction involves first transforming f(*v * ) into the spacecraft rest frame and converting into a coordinate system defined around the view direction of interest , resulting in f(@xmath63,@xmath64,@xmath65 ) , where @xmath63 is the speed relative to the spacecraft , @xmath64 is the poloidal angle with respect to the view direction , and @xmath65 is the azimuthal angle . with a volume element `` @xmath66 '' , the predicted count rate can then be expressed as @xmath67 where @xmath68  @xmath69 is the effective area , @xmath70 is the detection efficiency , and @xmath71 is the detector geometry function .",
    "figure  5 shows our digitized versions of @xmath71 and @xmath72 , approximated from figures  1 and 3 of @xcite , with the latter expressed as a function of incoming particle energy , @xmath73 , with @xmath74 being the mass of the he atom . for a given elevation angle , particles in the azimuthal",
    "bins described in section  2 are observed while the spacecraft is spinning , so there is `` scan smoothing '' along the azimuthal direction .",
    "we account for this by averaging @xmath75 values computed at pixel center and at @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the azimuthal angular bin size .    by computing @xmath75 for all @xmath78 observed directions ,",
    "we compute a synthetic he beam map , @xmath79 ( for i=1,n ) , for comparison with the real one .",
    "this synthetic beam is multiplied by a normalization factor , @xmath80 , in order to best match the count rates of the observed beam .",
    "this amounts to a revision of the assumed @xmath61 value to @xmath81 . in making this normalization",
    "we are in effect replacing @xmath61 with @xmath80 as the true density - related free parameter of our fit .",
    "we also have to account for the background count rate , @xmath82 . as we did in the gaussian fitting",
    ", we simply assume a flat background .",
    "thus , the new predicted count rates are @xmath83 we perform a @xmath84 minimization ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to determine the @xmath80 and @xmath82 values that lead to the best fit to the data .",
    "the @xmath84 value of this best fit represents our measure of merit for this particular synthetic he beam map , which can be expressed as @xmath85 where @xmath86 $ ] are the predicted count rates , @xmath87 are the observed count rates , @xmath88 their poissonian uncertainties , and @xmath78 the number of points considered in the he beam map .",
    "we then have to determine what he flow parameters ( @xmath19 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and t ) truly minimize @xmath84 , representing the best fit to the data .",
    "the standard approach for determining a set of best - fit parameters is to start with a guess for the parameters , compute @xmath84 , and then use a @xmath84 minimization routine to refine the parameters to reduce @xmath84 until ultimately the true @xmath84 minimum is reached .",
    "if @xmath89 is the number of degrees of freedom of the fit ( the number of data points minus the number of free parameters ) , then the reduced chi - squared is defined as @xmath90 , which should be @xmath91 for a good fit .",
    "we use the marquardt method described by @xcite as our @xmath84 minimization routine .    figure  6a shows a wfov map from 1995  august  20 , and figure  6b - c shows a fit to this map , with the @xcite vector used as our initial guess for the fit parameters .",
    "it is a simple matter for the particle tracking code mentioned above @xcite to compute the expected beam location based on the @xcite vector , if we assume @xmath92  k ( meaning all he atoms have the exact same velocity and follow the exact same trajectory ) .",
    "we use this prediction to define the map region to be fitted .",
    "in particular , we only consider data points within @xmath93 of this location ( white dots in the figure ) , which encompasses enough of the region beyond the he beam to estimate the background .",
    "figure  6b shows the synthetic beam map of the best fit , and figure  6c explicitly plots observed versus predicted count rates , with a data point plotted for each of the white dots in figure  6b .",
    "the he flow vector parameters listed in figure  6c are gratifyingly close to the @xcite vector , and the @xmath94 value indicates an excellent quality fit .",
    "unfortunately , the best - fit parameters that we infer are actually highly dependent on our initial guesses for the parameters .",
    "this is shown explicitly in a second fit to the 1995  august  20 data in figure  6d - e . with an initial guess very different from the @xcite vector used in figure  6b - c",
    ", we end up with a fit to the data with very different parameters .",
    "the parameters listed in figure  6e are very far from all modern estimates of the local ism flow vector , so we know they are wrong .",
    "but these parameters lead to a fit that is just as good as the more plausible fit in figure  6b , with a @xmath95 value that is actually slightly lower even .",
    "this exercise emphasizes just how difficult it is to find a unique he flow vector from a single he beam map .",
    "a single map does not sufficiently constrain the problem .",
    "there are significant degeneracies among the fit parameters , leading to long diagonal troughs in @xmath84 space where it is very hard to find the true @xmath84 minimum along the trough .",
    "this is true for the analysis of ibex data as well ( see figure  22 in * ? ? ?",
    "the most basic degeneracy is between flow direction and flow speed , which can be explained by the following question : if a beam is seen from a given direction , is that due to a fast beam coming from roughly that direction , or due to a slower beam that has been gravitationally deflected into that direction ?",
    "since the he flow vector happens to lie near the ecliptic plane , this degeneracy basically ends up mostly between @xmath19 and @xmath7 ( rather than @xmath8 ) .",
    "we argue here that these degeneracies can be effectively broken if _ ulysses _ data from different parts of the _ ulysses _ orbit are fitted together , as opposed to fitting one beam map at a time , as in figure  6 .",
    "the utility of this approach is illustrated by figure  7 .",
    "we had previously emphasized how the he beam traces out a horseshoe pattern in the sky during a fast latitude scan ( see figure  3a ) .",
    "figure  7 shows the horseshoe pattern expected based on the @xcite vector ( assuming @xmath92  k ) , and also shows what happens to the horseshoe when @xmath8 , @xmath7 , and @xmath19 are changed .",
    "when @xmath8 and @xmath7 are changed the horseshoe shifts vertically and horizontally , respectively . in contrast , @xmath19 affects the size of the horseshoe , with higher @xmath19 yielding a smaller horseshoe .",
    "the crucial point is that @xmath19 affects the horseshoe shape very differently from @xmath8 and @xmath7 , thereby breaking the direction / velocity degeneracy noted above .",
    "but this diagnostic power can only be properly considered if he beam maps from all parts of the horseshoe are considered simultaneously in fitting the data ; hence the global fit approach .",
    "the specific data used in this global fit approach are the 238 wfov maps used in the gaussian fitting ( see section  3 ) .",
    "the global fit is similar to the individual map fits in figure  6 , but we are now fitting many more data points , naturally ; 81,405 count rates within the 238 maps , to be precise .",
    "in addition to the four he flow parameters of interest ( @xmath19 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath96 ) , there are also @xmath80 and @xmath82 parameters for each individual map , for a total of 480 free parameters .",
    "summing over the 238 separate maps , equation ( 3 ) becomes @xmath97 where @xmath98 $ ] .",
    "figure  8 shows the 238 @xmath99 and @xmath100 values that result from our best fit .",
    "the @xmath100 values are essentially identical to the backgrounds shown in figure  4b , measured in the gaussian fit analysis .",
    "the @xmath99 factors are directly related to inferred he densities ( see above ) , so that is how they are shown in the figure .",
    "the clear phase dependence is an effect of photoionization losses , which are more severe at intermediate phases when the spacecraft is closer to the sun .",
    "we will discuss this issue in detail in section  5 when we actually seek to correct for photoionization .",
    "we need to not only find the best fit but also to estimate uncertainties in the fit parameters , so the full analysis actually involves a series of fits with one of the four flow parameters held constant , as we scan through the parameters to see how @xmath84 varies with @xmath19 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath96 .",
    "results are shown in figure  9 .",
    "there is a very clear @xmath84 minimum , @xmath101 , in each panel .",
    "we define @xmath102 , and each panel of figure  9 shows the variation of @xmath103 across the @xmath101 region .",
    "fifth order polynomials are fitted to the data points to interpolate between them .",
    "the @xmath103 values are used to define the error bounds around @xmath101 .",
    "@xcite and @xcite both provide useful discussions about how best to do this . for the number of free parameters of our fit ( 480 )",
    ", the @xmath104 confidence contour corresponds to @xmath105 , based on relation 26.4.14 of @xcite .",
    "this is the @xmath103 level used to define the uncertainty ranges shown in figure  9 .",
    "our final derived he flow parameters are : @xmath3 km  s@xmath2 , @xmath106  deg , @xmath107  deg , and @xmath6  k ; which are listed in the first line of table  1 .",
    "our best global fit has @xmath108 , which is somewhat higher than it should be ideally , indicating a modest level of systematic discrepancy from the data .",
    "it is not practical to show the actual fit to the data for all 238 beam maps , but for illustrative purposes figure  10 shows the fit for two particular maps , one from 1994  november  9 and another from 2007  november  26 .",
    "the former exhibits no clear systematic deviation between the fit and the data , but the latter shows some systematic deviation",
    ".    calculations involving photoionization will be discussed in more detail in section  5 , but at this point we mention that in order to see whether photoionization could be affecting our he vector and t measurements , we tried redoing the global fit assuming a he photoionization rate at 1  au of @xmath109 s@xmath2 , which is near the high end of those typically estimated @xcite .",
    "the resulting parameters and @xmath84 are : @xmath110 km  s@xmath2 , @xmath111  deg , @xmath112  deg , @xmath113  k , @xmath114 .",
    "these values are very similar to those found before , so considering photoionization does not change the derived vector or temperature significantly , and does not affect the quality of fit , consistent with the findings of @xcite .    figure  9 and table  1 demonstrate that our results are generally in very good agreement with the previous canonical _ ulysses _ measurements from @xcite , with the exception of @xmath96 .",
    "our temperature is significantly higher than the @xmath14  k measurement of @xcite .",
    "as discussed in section  2 , we are working with a new reduction of the _ ulysses _ data , but we have performed fits to he beam maps from the older data reduction , and we do not find any significant effect on our derived temperature .",
    "we initially suspected that our higher @xmath96 measurement may be an artifact of the global fitting approach .",
    "to first order , @xmath96 is determined mostly by the size of the observed he beams , while the other three parameters determine its direction .",
    "if the global fit has difficulty simultaneously reproducing the beam center for all 238 beam maps , it will try to compromise by broadening the beam , increasing the inferred @xmath96 .",
    "this effect will not be an issue with single - map fits , and so would not affect the @xcite analysis approach .",
    "we perform single - map fits to our 238 beam maps , where we fix @xmath115 km  s@xmath2 in order to resolve the parameter degeneracy problem with single - map fits described above .",
    "this provides 238 measurements of @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath96 .",
    "the average and standard deviation of these values are reported in the second line of table  1 .",
    "the @xmath7 and @xmath8 measurements are nearly identical to the global fit values .",
    "the @xmath116  k measurement is somewhat lower than the @xmath6  k global fit value , as expected , but not by that much .",
    "experimenting with other velocity values within our quoted @xmath3 km  s@xmath2 range does not change things significantly .",
    "we conclude that the beam - broadening effect of the global fit is not the dominant cause of our higher @xmath96 .",
    "differences in background treatment are another possible cause of the @xmath96 discrepancy .",
    "the original _ ulysses _ data analyses excluded pixels with count rates too close to the background value @xcite .",
    "typically only the upper @xmath117% of the profile was considered , whereas our approach is to consider all pixels within @xmath93 of the beam , with the background determination actually being part of the fit rather than assuming a predetermined background .",
    "we have considered the possibility that focusing more on the central part of the beam could lead to the perception of a narrower beam and therefore a lower @xmath96 . however , using single - map fits we have investigated the effects of focusing on the central part of the beam and we do not find that such fits consistently lead to significantly lower temperatures .",
    "thus , we ultimately dismiss this possible explanation for our high @xmath96 measurement .",
    "we note that our higher temperature is in better agreement with the @xmath118  k local interstellar cloud ( lic ) temperature estimated from ism absorption lines @xcite .",
    "it is also consistent with another contemporaneous reassessment of the _ ulysses _ he data by @xcite , largely following the same analysis approach used previously to study ibex data @xcite .",
    "their derived best - fit he flow parameters ( @xmath119 km  s@xmath2 , @xmath120 , @xmath121 , @xmath122  k ) are in reasonably good agreement with our results , including the higher temperature .",
    "the only difference is that @xcite claim much larger uncertainties .",
    "specifically , the parameters are quoted as having uncertainty ranges of @xmath123 , @xmath124 , @xmath125 km  s@xmath2 , and @xmath126  k. the large error bars are based on independent analyses of data taken from different parts of the _ ulysses _ orbit , but we consider these error bars to be overly conservative , as this analysis approach greatly weakens the diagnostic power of considering data from all parts of the _ ulysses _ orbit simultaneously , which is crucial to the efficacy of the global fit approach .",
    "figure  7 indicates how @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath19 change the shape of the horseshoe - shaped track for the he beam in different ways , and it is this effect that allows the global fit approach to break the degeneracies that plague single - map analyses ( see figure  6 ) .",
    "considering observations from only one part of the _ ulysses _ orbit will in effect reintroduce the degeneracy problem , naturally leading to the inference of the large uncertainties quoted by @xcite . to put it another way",
    ", we see the large uncertainties quoted by @xcite as being a further demonstration of the importance of considering data from _ all _ parts of the _ ulysses _ orbit together , rather than being an accurate quantification of systematic uncertainties inherent in these data .",
    "the cause of the higher t inferred both by ourselves and @xcite remains to be explained .",
    "having excluded the possibilities mentioned above , we conclude that the most likely cause of this discrepancy with @xcite lies in the bayesian statistics of the older analyses . while our analysis and that of @xcite rely solely on the @xmath84 statistic to quantify how well a set of parameters is fitting the data , the older analyses instead use a bayesian merit function that considers not only consistency with the data , but also consistency with prior assumptions about what the best - fit parameters should be ( see eqn .  10 from * ? ? ?",
    "the advantage of this bayesian approach is that this is one way to break the degeneracies in single - map fits , and derive relatively self - consistent single - map measurements like those shown in figure  2 of @xcite .",
    "the disadvantage is that the analysis is potentially biased by the a  priori assumption of expected best - fit parameters , as well as the question of how to weight the relative importance of consistency with those parameters and consistency with the data .",
    "the clearest distinction between our analysis and the older ones lies in this difference in how the best fit is defined , so we propose that the bayesian approach of the older work drove the analysis towards a lower temperature , while the pure @xmath84-minimization analysis used here and by @xcite leads to a higher temperature .    the higher temperature suggested by both our analysis and that of @xcite could have relevance for the discrepancy in the ibex and _ ulysses _ he flow vectors .",
    "the ibex analysis suffers from the same kind of parameter degeneracies discussed above for _ ulysses_. although the ibex data suggest a @xmath84 minimum for @xmath127  k @xcite , it is not clear that significantly higher temperatures are excluded by the data .",
    "furthermore , the parameter dependencies for ibex are such that assuming a higher temperature would push the ibex - derived @xmath7 and @xmath19 values closer to those of _",
    "ulysses_. specifically , assuming our @xmath6  k measurement would yield the following values from ibex : @xmath128 and @xmath129 km  s@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "these values are still not quite consistent with _ ulysses _ , but they are significantly closer than the @xcite values quoted in section  1 .    a likely important source of systematic uncertainty in the _ ulysses _ data analysis that we want to emphasize is uncertainty in the detection efficiency ( @xmath72 ) curve in figure  5b .",
    "it is important to note that he atoms are typically detected in the @xmath130  ev range .",
    "this is very much in the `` knee '' of the @xmath72 curve , where @xmath72 is significantly energy dependent .",
    "combine this energy dependence with the fact that there is generally a significant gradient of average particle energy across a he beam , and the result is a situation where particle detection efficiency is higher on one side of the beam than the other , leading to an observed beam that is shifted from where one might naively expect to see it .",
    "this is clearly the case in figure  6 for example , where the observed beam is shifted to the left from its expected location based on a zero - temperature calculation assuming the @xcite vector .",
    "this effect is shown in more detail in figure  11 , which compares the observed trace of the he beam center from figure  3a with a trace computed from our best - fit he flow vector , assuming @xmath92  k. the average discrepancy between these two horseshoe - shaped tracks is @xmath131 , which is at least mostly due to the effects of @xmath72 described above",
    ". the magnitude of this effect will be quite sensitive to the slope of the @xmath72 curve around @xmath132  ev .",
    "we therefore suspect that uncertainties in this slope are an important source of systematic error in the _ ulysses _ analysis .",
    "could this effect in principle resolve the discrepancy in the ibex and _ ulysses _ he flow vectors ? to investigate this possibility , figure  11 shows the location of the horseshoe track that _ ulysses _ should have observed if the ibex vector of @xcite was correct , approximated once again with the @xmath92  k assumption . in most places along the horseshoe",
    ", the @xmath72 slope effect is not shifting the track towards the ibex track , so assuming @xmath72 curves with different slopes will unfortunately not resolve the ibex/_ulysses _ discrepancy .",
    "the ibex track in figure  11 is an average of @xmath133 from the observed track , illustrating the magnitude of the disagreement in angular terms .",
    "based on figure  7 , the lower @xmath19 and higher @xmath7 values measured by ibex ( see section  1 ) would be expected to produce a horseshoe track that is broader and shifted to the right from that observed by _",
    "ulysses _ , and figure  11 shows that explicitly .",
    "finally , we revisit the issue of he flow variability by performing global fits to the _ ulysses _ data separately for the three fast latitude scans , leading to independent measurements for 19941996 , 20002002 , and 20062007 .",
    "results are listed in table  1 and displayed in figure  12 .",
    "consistent with the findings of the empirical analysis of section  3 , we see no evidence for any he flow parameter variability , with the he flow direction varying by no more than @xmath0 from 19942007 , and the velocity varying by no more than @xmath1 km  s@xmath2 . with ibex data acquisition",
    "beginning in early 2009 , there is less than a two year time gap for the @xmath134 jump in flow longitude to occur , if the variable flow interpretation of the ibex/_ulysses _ discrepancy is correct @xcite .",
    "the previous section described how we measured four of the five parameters describing the assumed maxwellian he distribution in the ism .",
    "the remaining parameter is the density , @xmath61 . unlike the other four parameters ,",
    "the density is significantly affected by loss processes that occur during the he atoms journey from the ism to _",
    "ulysses_. thus , measuring @xmath61 is somewhat more complicated .",
    "the loss rate , @xmath135 , is assumed to vary as @xmath136 , and is generally quantified by quoting the loss rate at 1  au . for he ,",
    "the most dominant loss process is photoionization by solar euv photons , though electron impact ionization may also be non - negligible @xcite . for an assumed @xmath137 at 1  au",
    ", our particle tracking code can account for losses along the track , assuming the @xmath136 dependence . at the ism",
    "flow speed it takes about 500 days to travel from 10 au inward to the observer ( see , e.g. , figure  3 in witte 2004 ) , so the effective ionization rate should be an average of the rates encountered over the past year or so , weighted as @xmath136 .    the usual procedure for dealing with photoionization is to rely on estimates of @xmath137 from various monitors of solar euv emission @xcite .",
    "however , this process carries significant uncertainties , as many of the euv irradiance proxies are less than ideal for our purposes , and some of them are inconsistent .",
    "the solar euv experiment ( see ) on the thermospheric ionospheric mesospheric energy and dynamics ( timed ) spacecraft has significantly improved matters , but it was launched in 2002 , and so does not cover most of the _ ulysses _ time period .",
    "@xcite quote uncertainties in euv irradiance of 10%-20% in the see era , but up to a factor of 2 uncertainties before it .",
    "the see euv measurements have been correlated with other solar activity indicators that have been monitored for many decades ( e.g. , mg  ii , @xmath138 ) , allowing those indicators to be utilized as euv proxies .",
    "this has improved matters even for the older time period .",
    "nevertheless , we here try a different technique for dealing with photoionization that uses only _",
    "ulysses _ constraints . focusing on the second fast latitude scan ( 20002002 ) ,",
    "figure  13a shows densities measured as a function of orbital phase , computed assuming different photoionization rates .",
    "when an overly low rate is assumed ( @xmath139 s@xmath2 in the figure ) the result is a u - shaped curve with low densities at intermediate phases ( @xmath140 ) .",
    "although densities at all phases will be underestimates , the effect is more pronounced at these intermediate phases , since that is when _ ulysses _ is closest to the sun and therefore observes a he flow with the highest losses .",
    "conversely , when an overly high rate is assumed ( @xmath141 s@xmath2 in the figure ) the pattern reverses and overly high densities are observed at intermediate phases , indicative of an overcompensation in the loss correction .",
    "we define the most likely photoionization loss rate as that which leads to the flattest density - vs - phase curve . specifically , we compute the standard deviation of the density measurements divided by the average density , @xmath142 , and we find the @xmath137 value that minimizes this quantity . at this minimum ,",
    "the average density @xmath143 is then our @xmath61 measurement , and the minimum deviation is @xmath144 .",
    "we estimate 1@xmath145 uncertainties for our loss rate and density measurements using the standard deviation of the mean at this minimum , @xmath146 , where here @xmath147 is the number of measurements .",
    "the range of acceptable loss rates are then defined to be where @xmath148 for the epoch  2 data in figure  13a , the minimum density variance is at @xmath149 s@xmath2 , and the resulting densities are shown in the figure . assuming this rate , the average he density is then computed to be @xmath150 @xmath10 .",
    "figure  13b displays the density measurements for all three epochs .",
    "the inferred densities and photoionization rates are listed in table  2 , along with the @xmath151 uncertainties computed as described above . for epoch  3 ,",
    "the analysis is less constrained due to fewer data points and intrinsically greater scatter ( see figure  13b ) , so we essentially find only an upper limit to @xmath137 .",
    "the densities independently measured from the three epochs are not identical . assuming that the ism he density does not really vary , the degree of inconsistency is presumably an indication of the uncertainties in the loss correction , although detector sensitivity uncertainties are also a potential factor .",
    "the stability of the detector sensitivity was tested twice during the course of the mission .",
    "new layers of lif were evaporated onto the surface from the gas instrument s lif supply in 1995 and 2001 .",
    "the he signal was measured immediately before and after each deposition .",
    "it showed that the detection efficiency did not change within the available statistical accuracy of 20% .",
    "unfortunately , a third test planned for 2006 had to be cancelled , as the power necessary to heat the lif supply may have exceeded the power available to the spacecraft at the time , which had decreased during the course of the mission .",
    "thus , it can not be proven that the detection efficency did not degrade during the third and final epoch , altough it seems unlikely in view of past experience . in any case",
    ", the average and standard deviation of the three measurements in table  2 provides our final best estimate for the ism he density : @xmath9 @xmath10 .",
    "this is somewhat higher than the @xmath152 @xmath10 measurement from @xcite , due at least in part to higher assumed photoionization rates , but the error bars overlap .",
    "table  2 compares our inferred loss rates with average ones estimated by @xcite for the three epochs based on solar wind and euv constraints , taking into consideration both photoionization and electron impact ionization .",
    "there is actually good agreement for epochs 2 and 3 , but not for epoch 1 , where our @xmath153 s@xmath2 is significantly higher than the @xmath154 s@xmath2 rate expected for this period .",
    "given that our estimated density is also rather high , it seems likely that our analysis approach has led to an overestimate of @xmath137 .",
    "our technique of minimizing phase - dependent density variation does have the drawback of not accounting for any change in photoionization rate that might occur in the 20 month period covering the @xmath155 fast - latitude scan range .",
    "however , the loss rates estimated by @xcite do not actually show much variation during epoch 1 , so unidentified issues may also be present .",
    "motivated in part by the discrepancy in the he flow vectors measured by _",
    "ulysses _ and ibex , we have performed an independent analysis of the _",
    "ulysses_/gas data set from 1994 - 2007 , newly reprocessed in 2013 , including 20062007 data not included in the canonical @xcite analysis .",

    ": :    we first perform a purely empirical analysis of the he beam observed    by _ ulysses _ , using 2-d gaussian fits to quantify beam location ,    amplitude , and width ; in order to see how these parameters vary with    orbital phase and time .",
    "there is no evidence for intrinsic variability    in beam direction by more than a few tenths of a degree .",
    "the beam    widths are also invariant within measurement uncertainties .",
    "2 . : :    the lack of variability in the he beam from 19942007 makes it harder    to explain the ibex/_ulysses _ discrepancy in terms of he flow    variability , with less than a two - year time gap for that change in    flow to occur before ibex observations begin in 2009 . 3 . : :    we demonstrate that the most powerful constraint that the    _ ulysses_/gas data provide on the he flow vector lies in the shape of    the horseshoe - shaped track made by the he beam over the course of a    _ ulysses _ orbit , which breaks parameter degeneracies that plague    attempts to derive he flow parameters from individual beam maps . only    by fitting the _ ulysses_/gas data collectively can this diagnostic    power be fully utilized .",
    "4 . : :    from a global fit to the full _ ulysses_/gas data set from 19942007 ,    we find the following he flow parameters :    @xmath3 km  s@xmath2 ,    @xmath4 ,    @xmath5 , and    @xmath6  k. separate global fits to the three    separate fast - latitude scans confirm a lack of he flow parameter    variability , with the flow direction varying by no more than    @xmath0 and the velocity by no more than    @xmath1 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "5 . : :    our ( @xmath19,@xmath7,@xmath8 )    he vector is consistent with the previous canonical measurements of    @xcite and the contemporaneous analysis of @xcite , proving that the    ibex/_ulysses _ discrepancy is not a product of different analysis    approaches .",
    "the cause of the ibex/_ulysses _ discrepancy remains    unknown . 6 .",
    ": :    our temperature measurement ( @xmath6  k ) is    somewhat higher than the @xmath14  k value of    @xcite , but is consistent with the @xmath122  k best - fit    value of @xcite , although @xcite quote a much larger range of    acceptable values ( @xmath126  k ) .",
    "a higher temperature    potentially mitigates the ibex/_ulysses _ discrepancy somewhat , as the    parameter dependencies in the ibex analysis are such that a higher    @xmath96 would lead to lower @xmath7 and higher    @xmath19 , moving the ibex - derived values closer to those    of _ ulysses_. 7 .",
    ": :    using a technique to infer photoionization loss rates solely from    _ ulysses _ constraints , we compute he densities and loss rates for the    three epochs of observation ( 19941996 , 20002002 , and 20062007 ) .",
    "our    loss rates agree well with expectations from solar euv constraints for    epochs 2 and 3 , but not for epoch 1 , where we seem to overestimate the    rate .",
