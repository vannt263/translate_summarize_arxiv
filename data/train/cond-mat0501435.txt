    "the fcc(111 ) surfaces of noble metals exhibit a large sp - band gap in the projected bulk band structure along the @xmath0-l line .",
    "@xcite these gaps reach down below the fermi energy at the center of the surface brillouin zone and support an occupied free electron surface - state.@xcite electrons occupying these shockley - type surface - states form a two - dimensional nearly free electron gas parallel to the surface .",
    "@xcite electrons are confined to the vicinity of the top layer by the vacuum barrier on one side and a band gap in the bulk states on the other side .",
    "scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) and spectroscopy ( sts ) are particularly sensitive tools to study these surface - states that dominate in the zone between the tip and the surface .",
    "@xcite these techniques map the local electronic density of states ( ldos ) in real space .",
    "stm has provided real space observation of electrons in surface - states and of their interactions with adsorbates , @xcite steps , @xcite , and other structures @xcite in the form of standing wave patterns .",
    "these spatial oscillations are quantum mechanical interference patterns caused by the scattering of electrons in the two - dimensional electron gas from defects .",
    "the standing wave patterns contain information about the surface - state dispersion and they give insight into the interaction between surface - state electrons and scattering sites on the surface .",
    "@xcite    sts images of the local differential tip - surface conductance ( called di / dv maps ) have been used to investigate how the surface - state interacts with a single straight atomic step @xcite and with a pair of adjacent straight steps.@xcite from the measurement of spatial oscillation periods normal to the step it was possible to extract fermi wave vectors @xcite and complete energy dispersion curves.@xcite thus , the surface - state on clean , disorder - free systems is well characterized .",
    "however , growth and catalysis , which are both influenced by the electronic structure of the surface , @xcite also occur on surfaces where disorder is present .",
    "in particular , the ldos modulations on irregular step arrays@xcite can have a dramatic impact on these processes .",
    "therefore , it is important to understand and to be able to predict the electronic structure on disordered terraces of varying width limited by steps with irregular edges .",
    "a study of the electronic structure of such terraces is the focus of this paper .    in a recent publication ,",
    "we have investigated the dependence of the ldos near the fermi - energy , e@xmath1 , on the width of terraces on ag(111 ) at 7 k.@xcite we showed that the _ apparent _ surface - state band minimum shifts monotonically towards the bulk @xmath2 with decreasing terrace width leading to a depopulation at a mean terrace width @xmath3 nm , in quantitative agreement with a fabry - prot model with energy dependent finite asymmetric reflectivity of the step edges .",
    "in addition , a switch from confinement by terrace modulation to step modulation was observed at @xmath4 ( @xmath5=3.7 nm ) , half of the fermi wavelength on an infinite terrace .",
    "this switch occurs on cu(111 ) surfaces also at @xmath4 as proven by photoemission .",
    "@xcite    in this paper , we present sts data revealing spatial oscillations of the local density of states on ag(111 ) for narrow disordered terraces of varying width up to 8.5 nm . apparent band edge shifts of the surface - state onset ( as reported in ref .",
    "[ ] ) lead to conductance variations on terraces of different width at the same energy .",
    "a standing wave pattern also evolves parallel to the steps , i.e.  in the non - confined direction .",
    "its wavelength follows the dispersion relation of an electron in the clean , infinite surface - state . in order to understand the wave pattern , theoretical simulations based on scattering theory",
    "are performed for disordered terraces .",
    "these calculations successfully reproduce the observed oscillations parallel to the terraces as well as interesting tip - sample voltage polarity dependent effects .",
    "this paper is organized in the following way . in sec .",
    "[ sec : exp ] we discuss the details of the experiment , including sample preparation , the types of measurements made , and the main features observed in the data . in sec .  [ sec : theory ] we discuss the theoretical model used to interpret the experiments and its assumptions .",

    "[ sec : conclusions ] we give the main conclusions of our work .",
    "the experiments have been performed in ultrahigh vacuum with a low temperature scanning tunneling microscope that operates at temperatures between 6 and 300 k. the single crystalline ag(111 ) surface is cleaned by sputtering and annealing cycles .",
    "the surface separates into large flat terraces and step bunches with an average terrace width of 4 nm.@xcite in this paper , we investigate the spatial oscillations of the ldos in these stepped regions .",
    "measurements are performed at 7 k.    the topographic images are taken in constant current mode .",
    "di / dv spectra are recorded with the lock - in technique ; the ac tunnel current is driven by a 4 mv signal added to the junction bias with a frequency of 327.9 hz , 381.8 hz , or 738.1 hz .",
    "voltages are applied to the sample with respect to the tip .",
    "thus , for a negative voltage the occupied side of the spectrum is probed .",
    "di / dv maps are recorded simultaneously with the topographic images at the same voltage by recording the lock - in signal at each pixel .",
    "it is not possible to run the stm in constant height mode in imaging a step array of more than 1 nm change in height .",
    "thus , the constant - current image recorded simultaneously with the di / dv map is used for an adjustment in tip - sample separation .",
    "this leads to a superposition of the di / dv signal with a variance in height at the step edges .",
    "a di / dv map of 256x256 pixels is recorded in about 80 minutes .",
    "series of di / dv maps therefore requires a high stability stm , which our system provides . typically , the drift is less than 0.3 nm during a series of 10 di / dv maps , i.e.  13 hours .",
    "major drift problems arise from the increasing temperature at the end of helium evaporation .",
    "therefore , measurement series on the same spot of the crystal are limited by the helium amount available in the bath cryostat .      for a defect - free terrace of ideally parallel steps ,",
    "the surface - state electrons on each terrace are confined perpendicular to steps but are free parallel to them .",
    "thus , the wave functions of surface - state electrons are separable , with standing waves normal to the steps and plane waves parallel to the steps .",
    "this leads to a wave pattern _ perpendicular _ to the steps .",
    "[ large_terrace]a shows these well known spatial oscillation of the surface - state electrons _",

    "note the irregularities of the plane waves introduced by the natural deviation of the step edge position from a straight line .",

    "the example shown in fig.[large_terrace]c , taken on a terrace of 6.1 nm width , displays onsets at -53 mev and 32 mev with onset widths of @xmath11 mev and @xmath12 mev , respectively .",
    "these two peaks correspond to the first two transverse modes of the surface state confined by the terrace edges .",

    "we have shown before that these variations close to the step edges are in accordance with a fabry - prot model with the steps acting as finite , energy - dependent barriers , so this is no indication of a shift in energy.@xcite as a consequence of strong scattering of the surface - state electrons by the step potential , the amplitude of the surface - state is smaller close to the step edges.@xcite thus , the peak intensity of di / dv varies for the same terrace width depending on the distance from the step edges ( fig .",

    "[ didv_occupied ] to [ didv_unoccupied ] .    below the onset of the surface - state , di / dv maps display bright lines and spots on a continuous background ( fig .",
    "[ didv_occupied]b to d ) .",
    "the bright lines correspond to the surface steps and are an artifact of the constant current scanning process ( see above ) .",
    "the brightest spot in the di / dv maps corresponds to an impurity at the step edge .",
    "it is visible in the topography as a protrusion imaged 20 pm higher than the surrounding step edge ( fig .",

    "this impurity can be used as a reference point to compensate for thermal drift .",
    "the two less bright spots are not visible in the topographic stm image in the contrast shown .",

    "we therefore attribute them to subsurface impurities .",

    "examples of this effect can be seen in figs .",
    "[ didv_occupied ] to [ didv_unoccupied ] , although the oscillations in the narrower terraces are less regular for the narrower terrace .",
    "we attribute this to larger relative variations in width for fixed edge variations in the narrower terraces .",
    "furthermore , a quadratic variation of @xmath29 with @xmath30 is expected for a free electron dispersion ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : e_n ] ) ) provided no additional transverse modes are occupied over the energy range probed .",
    "indeed , the data can be well fitted by @xmath31 .",
    "we find @xmath32 mev , the same value as the bottom of the surface - state band determined from the surface - state onset on large terraces ( see above ) and from perpendicular wave patterns on large terraces . @xcite also the wavelengths determined from the negative di / dv maps of fig .

    "[ didv_unoccupied]n displays the dispersion relation deduced from this measurement that reproduces the dispersion relation determined from perpendicular wave patterns .",
    "@xcite thus , parallel wave patterns originate also from the scattering of surface - state electrons .",
    "in this paper we are focused on understanding the role of disorder in the terrace edge profile on the observed modulations in the local density of states .",
    "disorder in the edge profile breaks translational symmetry along the direction parallel to the terrace edges .",
    "this broken symmetry prevents a simple separation of the energy ( and the wavefunctions ) of the electrons into a parallel and transverse component , as was done in eq .",
    "( [ eq : e_n ] ) . in order to conveniently handle the broken translational symmetry another approach is needed .",
    "we chose to use a scattering theory@xcite that has been quite successful in predicting the standing wave patterns in the ldos observed with the stm around impurities and step edges on the surfaces of the noble metals that support surface - states .    the scattering theory given in ref .",
    "[ ] most naturally describes the scattering of electrons in the surface - state from point - like impurities ( adatoms ) where an s - wave scattering approximation can be made ; scattering from an extended impurity , such as a terrace edge , requires some modification of the theory , which otherwise can not directly describe scattering from an extended object .",
    "fortunately , since the standing wave patterns we are interested in ( those parallel to the terrace edges ) are observed most clearly in the central portion of the terrace , we may make a simple approximation in the scattering theory for the terrace edge : we treat the terrace edge as a dense `` row '' of point ( s - wave ) scatterers .",
    "far from the terrace edges ( near the middle of the terrace , for example ) the results will be indistinguishable from a terrace edge that is continuous .",
    "a `` row '' of atoms is expected to be a good approximation to the terrace edge provided the atoms that make up the wall are well within a wavelength ( the wavelength of the surface - state electron ) of each other and the distances probed are of the order of the separation of the atoms or larger . in the calculations described below our objective will be first to understand the qualitative features we can expect from scattering theory and second to compare as directly as possible with experiment .",
    "the latter requires determining the phase shift of a single atom ( one of many that make up the terrace edge ) so that the correct phase shift results for the edge as a whole . since the input to the scattering theory is the wall profile , the dispersion of the surface - state electrons , and the s - wave scattering phase shift @xmath34 , the only free parameter we have in the theory is @xmath34 .",
    "we tune @xmath34 for a fixed wall profile and surface - state dispersion to reproduce the experimental di / dv vs. v spectra at the center of the terrace .",
    "once @xmath34 is optimized in this way , we computed the di / dv image maps ( at a fixed voltage ) over all positions using this value and the exact edge profile of the terraces .        to understand the qualitative effects we expect from a scattering theory approach to the ldos modulations from disordered terraces",
    ", we first carried out calculations on a single terrace with perfectly straight walls and then added in increasing amounts of disorder .",
    "the terraces were modeled by placing 21 point ( s - wave ) scatterers at a distance of @xmath35 along the terrace edge .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ theorie_unitless ] .",
    "the di / dv maps were computed using the surface - state dispersion @xmath36 .",
    "( confinement effects that do not cause an apparent shift in the surface - state band minimum are captured automatically by electron scattering from the terrace `` edges '' . )",
    "an approximation to the `` constant current '' condition used in the experiment ( while simultaneously aquiring topographic and di / dv maps ) is achieved by calculating @xmath37_{\\rm   meas}\\equiv\\left[\\frac{di}{dv}(ev)\\right]_{\\rm calc}- \\langle   \\left[\\frac{di}{dv}\\right]_{\\rm calc } \\rangle\\ ] ] where @xmath38_{\\rm calc } \\rangle =   \\int_0^{ev } d\\epsilon \\left[\\frac{di}{dv}(\\epsilon)\\right]_{\\rm calc}(ev)^{-1}$ ] .",
    "this procedure correctly reproduces brightness variations in di / dv maps simultaneously taken with topographic maps.@xcite    in these initial model calculations , each scatterer is assumed to have a phase shift of @xmath39 .",
    "this value turns out to be almost `` universal '' for adatoms on the surfaces of noble metals@xcite so we take it as a starting point ; later we will find a different value matches the experiments better when we attempt to make a direct , quantitative comparison between theory and experiment .",
    "the initial choice of @xmath39 is arbitrary and does not affect any of the qualitative conclusions reached from the calculations presented in figs .",
    "[ theorie_unitless ] and  [ theorie_9images ] .",
    "while this value works well for single adatoms , the physics of scattering from a terrace edge is very different from the physics of scattering from an isolated atom , and this is why the best phase shift for the terrace edge atom differs from @xmath39 .    fig .",
    "[ theorie_unitless]a shows the calculated @xmath40_{\\rm calc}$ ] map for a trough of @xmath41 in length and @xmath35 in width limited by 21 point scatterers on each side .",
    "while the perpendicular standing wave pattern outside the trough is clearly visible , its narrowness inhibits a similar wave pattern within the trough .",
    "it is too small to support even half of a fermi - wavelength .",
    "the introduction of an arbitrary defect in one of the terrace walls leads to standing waves parallel to the rows of atoms with the same wavelength @xmath4 as the perpendicular wave outside the trough ( fig .",
    "[ theorie_unitless]b ) .",
    "note the faint signs of oscillations in the `` perfect '' terrace as well .",
    "these originate from the finite length of the trough , where its ends act as defects .",
    "these first calculations demonstrate that a parallel wave pattern is indeed a result of terrace disorder .    for a better understanding of particular features in the wave patterns observed in the experiments , we compare @xmath40_{\\rm calc}$ ] maps of varying terrace width and terrace disorder ( fig.[theorie_9images ] ) .",

    "a , d , and g support the idea that a wave pattern perpendicular to the steps can only develop for larger terraces .",
    "the intensity of the parallel wave pattern increases with increasing disorder ( figs.[theorie_9images]a to c ) and shows the same qualitative features as in the experiments .",
    "for example , some of the maxima in fig.[theorie_9images]c are brighter than neighboring ones ; some of them seem to be disconnected from neighboring maxima by deep minima , while between other maxima there are only little contrast variations .",
    "[ theorie_9images ] c and i show that two bright protruding lines are seen instead of one for a larger terrace width . for the broadest disordered terrace ( fig .",

    "[ theorie_9images]i ) as in the experiment .",
    "many of the qualitative features of the experiments can thus be reproduced by the scattering theory , showing they result from terrace edge disorder .",
    "the calculations presented so far were meant to illustrate that the main physics is captured by the scattering theory and to emphasize the quality of the qualitative agreement between the scattering theory and experiment .",
    "now , we go beyond these simple qualitative model calculations and use the actual surface - state dispersion for ag(111 ) listed above and a terrace edge profile taken from experiment .",
    "the surface - state onset on a large terrace lies at @xmath42 ev ; the effective mass is @xmath43 . these values lead to @xmath44 nm for the fermi - wavelength on an infinite terrace .",
    "first , we calculate position dependent @xmath40_{\\rm calc}$ ] spectra for a 7.9 nm wide terrace with varying phase shift and compare them to the experimental spectra for the broadest terrace in fig .",
    "the phase shift of the scatterers is chosen to best reproduce the fabry - perot type oscillations with the tip - sample bias , as shown in fig .",
    "[ compare_didv ] .",
    "the best agreement is reached with a phase shift of @xmath45 .",
    "those spectra resemble the experimental ones with a shift in the apparent surface - state onset and a second peak in the unoccupied region .",
    "note that in order to keep our fitting parameter to only the number @xmath34 , we do not include any energy dependence in the phase shift .",
    "there is good agreement between the spectra calculated for the right half of the terrace ( fig .",
    "[ compare_didv]a ) , if spectrum number 14 showing no second maximum is taken as the central spectra , though it is measured 0.6 nm to the right of the geometrical center .",
    "this might be simply due to difficulties in determining the geometrical center of the terrace edges or may be due to the asymmetry of the reflection properties of ascending and descending step edges.@xcite the reflectivities of steps on this surface have been measured to be @xmath46 and @xmath47 @xcite for the descending and the ascending step , respectively .",
    "spectra 15 , 16 , and 17 are measured at a distance of 0.6 nm , 1.2 nm , and 1.8 nm from spectra 14 are compared to calculations performed at ` 0.7 nm ' , ` 1.5 nm ' , and ` 2.0 nm ' from the center of the terrace , respectively . in all cases ,",
    "the peak at @xmath48 mev lies at almost exactly the same energy and its relative intensity is well reproduced .",
    "the first peak lies also at approximately the correct energy .",
    "however , a sharp rise in the theoretical spectra ( an artifact of the calculation procedure ) makes a comparison difficult for the first peak . in both theory and experiment , the second peak is broader than the first peak , because the reflectivity and thus the lifetime of the resonance decreases with increasing energy .    in fig .",
    "[ compare_didv ] the peaks are sharper and more intense in theory than in experiment .",
    "several processes may explain this difference in sharpness and intensity .",
    "on the experimental side , the spectra show thermal and modulation voltage broadening .",
    "we simulate the modulation voltage averaging and temperature broadening by averaging the theoretical spectra ( fig .",
    "[ compare_didv]b ) .",
    "indeed , this broadening makes the additional peak in the theory at @xmath49 mev undetectable in the experiment and lowers the intensity of the peak at + 20 mev .",
    "however , the theoretical peaks remain somewhat sharper , presumably from details associated with how the terrace edges are modeled .",
    "one may think that the `` porous '' nature of the walls my lead to a shorter lifetime , and hence a broader thoery peak than what is observed experimentally .",
    "however , this appears not to be the case . changing the number of atoms that make up the edge profile by 50% has a negligible effect on the widths of the peaks .",
    "discrepancies may result from not correctly modeling the energy dependence of the reflectivity by replacing the steps by point scatters : the peaks in di / dv can be associated with fabry - prot type resonance with an energy dependent reflectivity.@xcite as a narrower resonance means a longer lifetime , and thus a greater reflectivity , we conclude that theory has an effective reflectivity which is larger than experiment .",
    "the calculation has an energy dependent reflectivity , but because the walls are built up from point scatterers , it is difficult to determine the reflectivity exactly in order to compare it directly with experimental results for a `` perfect '' terrace . with effort",
    ", a very close match could be made by making the phase shift energy dependent and possibly adding imaginary parts as well , but extremely accurate numerical agreement is not our goal here .",
    "rather , we wish to understand what is responsible for the essential features of the data .",
    "a more accurate calculation than ours would also include changes to the surface - state band dispersion itself due to the terrace edges . recall that our theory uses the surface - state dispersion of the free surface - states .",
    "the di / dv spectra to the left and to the right of the center differ in both experiment and theory as a result of an asymetry in the disorder of the two terrace edges . however , for the experimental spectra to the left of the center , the second peak shifts with position on the terrace .",
    "this is not recovered in the calculation ( fig.[compare_didv]c ) .",
    "we attribute this difference to the fact that the spectra are calculated for a terrace that is some 10% smaller than the experimental terrace and that has a different shape in detail , on the one hand , and to the larger difference in reflectivity properties between a row of atoms and a descending step than a row of atoms and an ascending step , on the other hand .",
    "the asymmetry in scattering properties of the two steps that can not be captured by replacing them by two rows of equivalent atoms leads thus to the ` off - center middle ' ( noted earlier in this section ) and to larger discrepancies on the half of the terrace that is closer to the descending step edge . despite these deviations in detail , the scattering theory does satisfactorily reproduce the experimental spectra .",
    "thus , we have calculated di / dv maps for a particular terrace for a direct quantitative comparison of experiments to theory .",
    "we have chosen terrace `` 3 '' of fig .",

    ", the comparison seems to be less favourable .",
    "the simulation shows two bright protruding lines close to the step edges separated by a dark stripe with little contrast variations .",

    "[ compare_mappositive]d ) . only a phase shift in the lower part",
    "is not recovered .",
    "thus , again the major difference lies in intensity .",
    "this last example underlines the complexity of the evolved wave pattern and that it may depend quite sensitively on various details of the geometry .",
    "we have probed the ldos of disordered terraces of varying width and observed oscillations _ parallel _ to the terraces with a wavelength in accordance with a free electron dispersion , and we have shown that these parallel oscillations arise naturally in scattering theory calculations for disordered terraces .",
    "the theory also captures important contrast variations with tip - sample voltage polarity .",
    "thus , the wave patterns observed experimentally are a result of step disorder .",
    "the complete pattern is a combination of fabry - prot ( surface - state ) and disorder scattering effects along with surface reconstruction effects .",
    "the fabry - prot effects are intrinsic in scattering theory , but the changes to the underlying surface - state band structure are not ( in the theortical model used here , which assumes a clean surface - state dispersion ) .",
    "as the scattering theory recovers all the qualitative features of the experiment and yields semi - quantitative agreement , the surface - state scattering effects dominate ( at least for the wider terraces ) .",
    "remaining differences are attributed to surface reconstruction effects .",
    "the semi - quantitative agreement in the simulation also shows that the cross - talk between the large terraces and their neighbors is negligible .",
    "the terraces that the di / dv maps have been calculated for are wide enough to allow us to use the surface - state band structure valid for infinitely broad terraces . in principle",
    "narrower terraces could be calculated within the same theory by using the appropriate dispersion relation for narrower terraces , which will in general be anisotropic and depend on terrace width .",
    "@xcite    as a future project , we suggest to locally investigate the reaction dependence on the vicinal surface and we expect local variation on the nanometer scale due to the reported variation of the ldos .",
