    "the most important observational advance in cosmology since the early studies of cosmic expansion in the 1920 s was the dramatic and unexpected discovery , in the waning years of the twentieth century , that the expansion rate is accelerating .",
    "this was first announced in february 1998 , based on the concordance of two groups data on supernovae type 1a @xcite .",
    "a plethora of subsequent experiments concerning the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , large scale structure ( lss ) , and other measurements have all confirmed the 1998 claim for cosmic acceleration .",
    "there have been many attempts to avoid the conclusion of the cosmic acceleration .",
    "typically they involve an ingenious ruse which assigns a special place to the earth in the universe , in a frankly ptolemaic manner and in contradiction to the well - tested and time - honored cosmological principle at large distance .",
    "we find these to be highly contrived and _",
    "ad hoc_.    we therefore adopt the position that the accelerated expansion rate is an observed fact which we , as theorists , are behooved to interpret theoretically with the most minimal set of additional assumptions .",
    "on the basis of general relativity theory , together with the cosmological principle of homogeneity and isotropy , the scale factor @xmath0 in the frw metric satisfies @xcite the friedmann - lematre equation    @xmath1    where we shall normalize @xmath2 at the present , time @xmath3 , and @xmath4 is an energy density source which drives the expansion of the universe .",
    "two established contributions to @xmath4 are @xmath5 from matter ( including dark matter ) and @xmath6 radiation , so that    @xmath7    with @xmath8 and @xmath9 .    for the observed accelerated expansion ,",
    "the most popular approach is to add to the sources , in eq.([flequation ] ) , a dark energy term @xmath10 with    @xmath11    where @xmath12 is the equation of state parameter . for the case",
    "@xmath13 , as for a cosmological constant , @xmath14 , and discarding the matter and radiation terms which are relatively negligible we can easily integrate the friedmann - lematre equation to find    @xmath15    where @xmath16 .",
    "by differentiation of eq .",
    "( [ cc ] ) with respect to time @xmath17 times we obtain for the @xmath18 derivative    @xmath19    therefore , if @xmath20 is positive , as in a de sitter geometry , not only is the acceleration ( @xmath21 ) positive and non - zero , but so are the jerk ( @xmath22 ) , the snap ( @xmath23 ) , the crackle ( @xmath24 ) , the pop ( @xmath25 ) and all @xmath26 .    the insertion of the dark energy term eq .",
    "( [ rhode ] ) in eq .",
    "( [ flequation ] ) works very well as a part of the @xmath27 model . however , it is an _",
    "ad hoc _ procedure which gives no insight into what dark energy is . identifying",
    "the cosmological constant with vacuum energy leads to the infamous cosmological constant problem : the observed value of the cosmological constant @xmath28 and the theoretical prediction ( assuming a uv cutoff at the planck scale ) @xmath29 , disagree by an embarrassing 120 orders of magnitude .    with this background",
    ", we shall now move to a different explanation for the accelerated expansion which obviates the need for any ambiguous dark energy component , including scalar fields .",
    "this approach ( which does not directly solve the cosmological constant problem ) even leads to new insight into the perplexing ratio @xmath30 discussed above .",
    "we now adopt a different approach , with no dark energy , where instead the central role is played by the ideas of information and holography , entropy and temperature .",
    "the first and only assumption is that a horizon has both a temperature and entropy associated with it .",
    "this was first shown clearly to hold for black hole horizons with a temperature given by the hawking temperature and an entropy given by the bekenstein entropy . here",
    "we take the apparent horizon of the universe .",
    "universe so the apparent horizon coincides with the hubble radius . we relegate a more general discussion of @xmath31 to the appendix . ]    at this horizon , there is a horizon temperature , @xmath32 , which we can estimate as    @xmath33    such a temperature is closely related to the de sitter temperature  , must be replaced by @xmath34 , although this is not our present concern . ] . more relevant to the central question is the fact that the temperature of the horizon leads to the concomitant entropic force and resultant acceleration @xmath35 of the horizon given by the unruh  @xcite relationship    @xmath36    when @xmath37 is used in eq .",
    "( [ acceleration ] ) , we arrive at a cosmic acceleration essentially in agreement with the observation .    from this viewpoint , the ambiguous dark energy component is non - existent .",
    "instead there is an entropic force contribution acting at the horizon and pulling outward towards the horizon to create the appearance of a dark energy component  .",
    "we emphasize again that because we have nothing new to say about the physics governing quantum fluctuations , the above argument does not , by itself , solve the cosmological constant problem .",
    "however , the interpretation of cosmic acceleration as due to entropic force helps to understand why the accelerating component is expected to be small today ( of order @xmath38 as in eq .",
    "( [ acceleration ] ) ) , in contrast to the embarasingly large value predicted by quantum field theory combined with general relativity .",
    "we shall next amplify on the distinction , and study more the entropy and surface screen considerations , showing that even the present fraction of the critical energy associated with acceleration can thereby be understood .",
    "the next portion derives an expression for the pressure , which is negative and thus a tension in the direction of the screen .",
    "the following results rely on simple principles of entropy and thermodynamics and are not dependent on any specific model .",
    "the entropy on the hubble horizon , e.g. the hubble radius @xmath39 , is    @xmath40    increasing the radius @xmath41 , by @xmath42 , increases the entropy by @xmath43 according to    @xmath44    the entropic force is simply @xmath45 where the minus sign indicates pointing in the direction of increasing entropy or the screen , which in this case is the horizon .",
    "the pressure from entropic force exerted is @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the critical energy density @xmath48 .",
    "this is close to the value of the currently measured dark energy / cosmological constant negative pressure ( tension ) . in this case",
    "the tension does not arrive from the negative pressure of dark energy but from the entropic tension due to the entropy content of the horizon surface .",
    "this is equivalent to the outward acceleration @xmath49 of eq .",
    "( [ acceleration ] ) .    if we chose to put the information screens at smaller radii , then",
    ", associating entropy with information , we would have found a proportionally smaller pressure , and an acceleration that decreases linearly with the radius in accordance with our expected hubble law .",
    "thus , the acceleration of the universe simply arises as a natural consequence of the entropy on the horizon of the universe .",
    "in this section , we present a specific phenomenological model inspired by surface terms usually ignored in general relativity and show that this also leads to an accelerating universe . while the surface terms source our motivation , the model is best viewed as a phenomenological model which we introduce here without rigorous derivation .",
    "we consider the least additional assumption is that general relativity is correct , and that it can be easily understood and derived from a variational principle using the action .",
    "we show that , under reasonable assumptions , the new terms lead to an acceleration term in the friedmann - lematre equations .",
    "there is a solution to the acceleration equation that evolves from a decelerating to an accelerating phase .",
    "our discussion of surface terms presents a specific class of models that give rise to cosmological acceleration ; however , we note that our main result , the derivation of cosmological acceleration as an entropic force presented in the previous section , is model independent .    the einstein - hilbert action including the surface term and a matter action is ( schematically )    @xmath50    where @xmath51 is the scalar curvature , @xmath52 is the matter and field lagrangian , and @xmath53 is the trace of the extrinsic curvature of the boundary  @xcite .",
    "the application of variational procedures then produces the usual einstein equations for general relativity with the addition of a surface energy term : @xmath54 typically the surface terms are neglected though they make a significant appearance when a horizon is present .",
    "this would in the case of spherical symmetry and homogeneity lead to the friedmann - lematre equations : @xmath55    now , there are a number of approaches to determine the form of the new terms . here",
    "we consider a simple possibility . from our surface term motivation",
    ", we would anticipate that the integral of the trace of the intrinsic curvature would be of order @xmath56 so that the term would be approximately @xmath57 .",
    "we can also take an approach motivated by entropic ideas and see that these naturally lead to a slowly expanding , late time accelerating universe .    for a horizon",
    ", it is well known that there is an associated curvature and temperature , and that these two quantities are related .",
    "the temperature @xmath58 is given by the unruh , de sitter , or hawking temperature prescriptions ( except for a pesky factor of two difference between the hawking temperature and the other two due to location of evaluation of the temperature - at the horizon or remote ) .",
    "we can then associate the surface entropy or surface term with its temperature and its acceleration . using the relations we find ( see eq .",
    "( [ acceleration ] ) ) for the horizon acceleration @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the hubble expansion rate .",
    "if we have a scale , which is naturally and necessarily the hubble horizon scale , @xmath61 , for our cosmological treatment , then we can complete the friedmann - lematre acceleration equation @xmath62 this is remarkably like the surface term order of magnitude estimate except for the @xmath63 factor . with the hawking temperature description",
    "the coefficient would have been 1/2 .",
    "there is some freedom here and we chose the value that leads to nice equations in the two limiting cases .",
    "it is easy to show that if the @xmath64 is highly dominant over the @xmath65 , the solution to the equation is simply a de sitter space with scale factor @xmath66 .",
    "the alternate equation @xmath67 may provide a better fit to the data ( see  [ sec : dis ] ) or a rigorous derivation but does not have the simplicity of eq .",
    "( [ good ] ) .    in order to adopt a broader approach , we generalized our discussion by considering @xmath68 where we anticipate the coefficients to be bounded by @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "we conclude with a demonstration that the entropic acceleration mechanism inspired by surface terms can provide a surprisingly remarkable fit the supernova data , assuming the simple form for the acceleration equation ( [ bad ] ) . because we are using a metric theory of gravity",
    ", we may use the standard formula for the luminosity distance : [ lumd ] d_l(z ; h(z ) , h_0 ) = _ 0^z , where @xmath71 is the redshift defined by @xmath72 . for @xmath14cdm",
    ", the luminosity distance can be written  @xcite : [ lumlcdm ] d_l(z ; _ m , _ , h_0 ) = s ( _ 0^z dz ^- ) where , @xmath73 and @xmath74 for @xmath75 while @xmath76 with @xmath77 for @xmath78 while @xmath79 and @xmath80 , for @xmath81 .",
    "for the @xmath14cdm models we take @xmath82 .",
    "here we have defined @xmath83 and @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the critical energy density .",
    "the results are that the entropic acceleration models we consider can provide excellent fits to the data as can be seen from fig .",
    "( [ dlfig ] ) .  ) . ]",
    "the entropic models move smoothly from a decelerating to an accelerating phase sometime near a redshift of @xmath86 , analogous to the @xmath14cdm models .",
    "we suspect a complete model may be further constrained by consideration of big - bang nucleosynthesis and possibly by precision data relating to the equivalence principle .    cdm models .",
    "the supernovae data points are plotted with error bars and the data is taken from  @xcite .",

    "the theoretical predictions for @xmath14cdm are represented by the solid curves.,width=384 ]",
    "we have proposed a theory underlying the accelerated expansion of the universe based on entropy and entropic force .",
    "this approach , while admittedly heuristic , provides a physical understanding of the acceleration phenomenon which was lacking in the description as dark energy .",
    "the evidence and general arguments supporting our hypothesis were presented in   [ sec : ent ] .",
    "in addition we considered an interesting phenomenological model , loosely based on surface terms in  [ sec : surt ] , and showed the models are capable of providing a good fit to the supernova data .    following the above arguments to their logical conclusion , the accelerated expansion rate is the inevitable consequence of the entropy associated with the holographic information storage on a surface screen placed at the horizon of the universe .",
