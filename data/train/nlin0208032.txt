    "large - scale structures such as vortices , background and tidal currents are the main constituents in geophysical flows that strongly influence all the transport and mixing phenomena .",
    "transport of heat and mass plays a crucial role in dynamics of the ocean and atmosphere . to study the transport and mixing processes",
    "the lagrangian representation is convenient to adopt .",
    "the motion of a test particle ( a tracer ) satisfies the differential equation @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the position of the particle and @xmath3 represents the incompressible eulerian velocity field .",
    "it has been recognized that particle trajectories even in simple flows can be chaotic in the sense that nearby trajectories separate exponentially in time . while in a three - dimensional flow it is possible",
    "even if the flow is time independent @xcite , _ lagrangian chaos _ or",
    "_ chaotic advection _ in a two - dimensional flow may occur only in time - dependent flows @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we study the dynamics of passive particles ( which take on the velocity of the flow very rapidly and do not influence the flow ) in a simple two - dimensional open flow composed of a fixed point vortex and a background current with a periodic component .",
    "this model is inspired by a very interesting natural phenomena , _ topographical vortices _ over mountains , to be found in the ocean and atmosphere @xcite . in the deep sea , they have been found in different regions of the world ocean with the help of buoys of neutral buoyancy @xcite . a laboratory prototype of a topographical vortex is a cylindric anticyclonic vortex to be found by taylor @xcite in homogeneous fluid over an underwater obstacle . in the homogeneous ocean",
    "the topographical vortices are cylindric whereas they are of cone - like form in the stratified ocean .",
    "we adopt , of course , an oversimplified model with a point vortex in an attempt to catch and quantify the main features of the tracer dynamics in the flow from the dynamical standpoint .",
    "the fixed point vortex is embedded in a background planar flow composed of steady and time - dependent components .",
    "if the flow satisfies the incompressibility condition , @xmath4 , the evolution equation ( [ 1 ] ) can be written in the hamiltonian form @xmath5 \\displaystyle{\\frac{dy}{dt}=v_y\\,(x,\\,y,\\,t)=\\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial x } } , \\end{array } \\label{2}\\ ] ] where the streamfunction @xmath6 plays the role of a hamiltonian .",
    "thus , the configuration space of an advected particle is a hamiltonian phase space of an associated dynamical system .",
    "it means that coordinate - space trajectories of tracers coincide with phase - space trajectories , and more importantly , the configuration space contains all the typical structures of hamiltonian phase space including islands of regular motion , islands around islands , cantori , stochastic layers , etc .",
    "( for a recent review of hamiltonian chaos see , for example @xcite ) .",
    "this prominent non - uniformity of the phase space implies anomalous transport of tracers , including lvy flights , their dynamical trapping and fractal properties , stickiness to islands boundaries , etc .",
    "these phenomena have been studied theoretically in the field of chaotic advection in a large number of systems ( see , for example , papers @xcite which represent a small part of relevant publications ) and observed in laboratory experiments @xcite .",
    "in our model flow , advected particles from the inflow region enter the region where the fixed point vortex is located and then wash out to the outflow region . while the tracer trajectories in the inflow and outflow regions , where the influence of the vortex is negligibly small , are simple as they just follow the streamlines of the background current , the trajectories in an influence zone of the vortex , called the _ mixing region _ in the following , are typically chaotic @xcite .",
    "so , the problem of tracer dynamics in the open flow we address in this paper is , in fact , a problem of chaotic scattering @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we introduce the model streamfunction and the equations of motion of advected particles , consider the integrable time - independent version of the model flow and prove analytically transversal intersections of stable and unstable manifolds of the saddle point producing homoclinic chaos in the time - dependent system . a numerically simulated image of the homoclinic structure and a typical poincar section of the particles trajectories in the mixing region provide a general picture of chaotic advection .",
    "in section 3 , we report our main results .",
    "we observe and discuss the phenomenon of stickiness of tracers trajectories to the boundaries of the vortex core and islands of regular motion which act as _ dynamical traps _ for tracers .",
    "we show that distribution of the dynamical traps over the space of initial tracer s positions is fractal - like , and the trapping time distribution demonstrates initially exponential decay followed by a _ power - law decay _ at the probability distribution function ( pdf ) tail with a characteristic exponent @xmath7 .",
    "we compute also dependence of tracer s trapping time on their initial positions and find it to be a typical fractal scattering function with an uncountable number of singularities .",
    "the mechanism of generating the _ fractal _ is shown to resemble the famous cantor - set generation with the hausdorff fractal dimension of the scattering function to be equal to @xmath0 .",
    "finally , in section 4 , we discuss some possible applications of the results .",
    "we consider a point fixed vortex embedded in a planar flow of an ideal incompressible fluid with a stationary and periodic components .",
    "the respective dimensionless streamfunction @xmath8 generates the lagrange equations of motion of a passive particle in the flow @xcite @xmath9 \\displaystyle{\\dot y=\\frac{x}{x^2+y^2}+{\\varepsilon}+\\xi\\,\\sin\\tau},\\\\ \\end{array } \\label{4}\\ ] ] where dot denotes differentiation with respect to dimensionless time @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the normalized velocities of a particle in the stationary and periodic components of the current flowing in the @xmath13 direction from the south to the north . without perturbation , @xmath14 , the phase portrait of the dynamical system ( [ 4 ] )",

    "depending on initial positions and the values of the control parameters , particles either are trapped inside the separatrix loop and move along closed streamlines or move along infinite streamlines outside the loop . in the integrable system , the stable manifold of the saddle point , along which particles move towards the saddle , and its unstable manifold , along which they move outward the saddle , coincide .",
    "taking into account the separatrix value of the energy @xmath20 , one can easily derive the travel time for a particle between two points with the coordinates @xmath21 nearby the separatrix @xmath22 where @xmath23 is a small deviation of the energy from its separatrix value .    under perturbation ,",

    "namely these dynamical traps are the ultimate reason for appearing fractals in our simple model flow . to give an insight into a mechanism of generating the fractal we plot in fig.7b segments of the initial string with @xmath66 tracers which are trapped in the mixing region after @xmath67 rotations around the fixed point vortex . after each rotation ,",
    "a portion of tracers is washed out in the downstream region with @xmath68 .",
    "this process resembles the mechanism of generating the famous cantor set but is more complicated .    in conclusion , we compute the length of the curve @xmath62 shown in fig.7a @xmath69 as a function of the inverse number of tracers , @xmath70 , distributed initially on the same line segment with @xmath44 and @xmath71 $ ] in the upstream region of the flow .",

    "we have shown that chaotic advection of passive particles by the open flow , composed of a fixed point vortex and a background current with a time - dependent component , has a fractal nature .",
    "appearance of fractals and dynamical traps in geophysical flows with topographical vortices should fluence strongly transport and mixing of heat and mass . instead of homogeneous mixing ,",
    "one expects a highly - structural , hierarchical fractal distribution of advected particles that is of great interest in oceanography and atmospheric sciences .",
    "it should be emphasized that the fractals and dynamical traps are not specific for our particularly simple model .",
    "they are typical in low - dimensional hamiltonian systems and should exist in more realistic models with elliptic topographical vortices and different boundary conditions considered , for example , in @xcite .",
    "if tracers are not passive but active ( chemical reagents or biological species ) , their activity is superimposed on chaotic mixing in open background flows .",
    "typically , there exists a local coupling between a spatial character of the activity and the spatial character of the fluid with coherent structures , dynamical traps and fractals .",
    "say in chemistry , molecules will react if they are in a close contact with each other .",
    "so , the imperfect mixing should largely increases the chemical or biological activity in some regions of the flow and suppress it in other regions . in marine biology , the paradoxical observational fact of coexisting thousands of phytoplankton species in spite of a limited number of resources for which they compete has been known for a long time @xcite .",
    "chaotic mixing of active particles in open nonstationary flows in the ocean with small - scale spatial inhomogeneities and fractal patterns can provide a natural explanation of the plankton paradox @xcite .",
    "homogeneous and complete mixing leads to an equilibrium state in the system of competing species resulting in the survival of the most fitted species , whereas chaotic mixing generates , typically , a persistent nonequilibrium state in the system providing the coexistence of much more species than the number of ecological niches they occupy .",
