    "manipulation of magnetic properties by an external electric field has long been a big challenge in the quest for novel spintronic devices . in conventional ferroelectric or ferromagnetic materials ,",
    "the controlled motion of ferroic domain walls ( dws ) is essential to achieve the desired functionalities.@xcite usually , the motion of dw in magnetic materials are driven by a magnetic fieldschryer - jap-1974,wang1,beach2005 or spin - polarized current.berger-84,tatara-prl-04 a key concept in the context of dw motion is the so - called walker breakdown,@xcite which distinguishes the two regimes with high- and low - mobility and sets a limit to the dw velocity . to achieve fast and efficient control of dw motion",
    ", various attempts have been made to prevent this breakdown process , such as applying a transverse field@xcite or considering a perpendicular magnetic anisotropy@xcite and the spin - orbit coupling effect.@xcite in this context , a way to manipulate the dynamics of the dws by an electric field , which is critical for developing low - power - consumption spintronic devices , would be extremely appealing .",
    "recently , it has been shown that modulating the magnetic anisotropy by an applied electric field is possible,@xcite and thus will allow for the electric field control of dw dynamics in ultrathin metallic ferromagnets.edw1,edw2,edw3,edw4,edw5,edw6,edw7 nevertheless , the search for alternative schemes allowing fast and energy - efficient dw propagation is of great relevance in advanced spintronics research .",
    "multiferroic materials,@xcite which exhibit simultaneously ferroelectric and magnetic orders , may provide a promising arena to realize electric control of magnetization and even for dw motion .",
    "multiferroics display a particularly rich variety of magnetoelectric ( me ) cross - coupling effects .",
    "an intriguing scenario of me coupling is that spiral spin orders can by themselves produce electric polarization , which is called the spin - current mechanism,@xcite or equivalently the _ inhomogeneous magnetoelectric interaction_.@xcite therefore , a nonzero electric polarization can be induced not just in bulk but also within local magnetic textures , like magnetic dws and vortices .",
    "the possibility of such a magnetoelectricity in ferromagnetic nel walls has been anticipated theoretically@xcite and recently demonstrated experimentally.@xcite  especially , this mecoupling also enables the electric field couple to the magnetization with its spatial gradients , which necessarily presents in metallic as well as insulating ferromagnets.@xcite the influence of this coupling on the spin waves of the multiferroics has recently been explored in ref .",
    "however , the relevance of the electric field to the motion of a multiferroic dw , even though it is crucial to future me multiferroic devices based on dw control , still remains unclear .    in this paper",
    "we identify the dynamical nature of a prototypical type of multiferroic dw , that is , a magnetic dw simultaneously displaying an electric polarization .",
    "this is a good basis for studying the dynamical properties of the multiferroic dws , in which the electric field can couple to the magnetization via the inhomogeneous magnetoelectric interaction .",
    "we derive the equations of motion for electric field controlled dw dynamics in such a multiferroic dw .",
    "we report two main findings .",
    "the first one is that the magnetic dw velocity can be considerably enhanced due to the delay of the occurrence of walker breakdown by an applied electric field .",
    "this electric - field - modulated higher dw speed implies faster device operation , which is one of the main aim of the conventional dw device applications .",
    "the second finding is that the electric field can be used to control the switching of the dw chirality .",
    "this control of the chirality could provide an additional degree of freedom , which can be useful in future magnetoelectric logic devices .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] we present the model for a multiferroic dw .",
    "we obtain the equations of motion for the multiferroic dw dynamics using the collective coordinate description . in sec .",

    "the dw chirality which describes the sense of rotation of the spins in the wall is preserved during the motion . for fields @xmath67 ,",

    "this dw chirality can be used as an information unit.@xcite therefore , a controllable switching of the dw chirality is desirable .",

    "such a difference between the two walker fields @xmath116 and @xmath118 enables the chirality of a moving dw to be switched .",
    "that is , when @xmath55 increases beyond the first walker field @xmath119 , the walker breakdown process does not occur until @xmath55 further reaches the higher walker field @xmath120 . in the meantime ,",
    "the initial tilt angle @xmath121 switches from @xmath27 to @xmath22 at the first threshold field @xmath116 and thus the dw chirality can be switched .",

    "[ fig : figure4](d ) as red solid line , which is in excellent agreement with the numerical results @xmath123 extracted from the @xmath107 curves .",
