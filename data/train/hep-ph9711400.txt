    "the investigation of the fundamental properties of neutrinos ( neutrino masses and neutrino mixing , the nature of massive neutrinos ( dirac or majorana ? ) , neutrino magnetic moments , etc . ) is the most important problem of today s neutrino physics .",
    "this investigation is one of the major directions of search for physics beyond the standard model .    at present , there are three experimental indications in favor of neutrino oscillations .",
    "the first indication comes from solar neutrino experiments ( homestake @xcite , kamiokande @xcite , gallex @xcite , sage @xcite and super - kamiokande @xcite ) .",
    "the second indication was found in the kamiokande @xcite , imb @xcite , soudan @xcite and super - kamiokande @xcite atmospheric neutrino experiments .",
    "the third indication in favor of neutrino oscillations was obtained by the lsnd collaboration @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , in many short - baseline ( sbl ) reactor and accelerator experiments ( see the reviews in refs.@xcite ) and in the recent long - baseline ( lbl ) reactor experiment chooz @xcite no indications in favor of neutrino oscillations were found .",
    "neutrino oscillation experiments can not provide an answer to the question : what type of particles are massive neutrinos , dirac or majorana ?",
    "( see ref.@xcite ) .",
    "the answer to this question , that is of fundamental importance , could be obtained from experiments on the investigation of processes in which the total lepton number @xmath5 is not conserved .",
    "the classical process of this type is neutrinoless double-@xmath6 decay ( @xmath7 ) @xmath8    the neutrinoless double-@xmath6 decay of different nuclei has been searched for in many experiments ( see , for example , ref.@xcite ) .",
    "no positive signal was found up to now .",
    "the most stringent limits on the half - lives for @xmath7 decay were found in @xmath9ge and @xmath10xe experiments . in the experiments of the heidelberg - moscow @xcite and caltech - neuchatel - psi @xcite collaborations",
    "it was found that @xmath11    the standard mechanism of @xmath7 decay is the mechanism of mixing of neutrinos with majorana masses . in accordance with the hypothesis of neutrino mixing ( see refs.@xcite ) , the left - handed flavor neutrino fields @xmath12 are combination of fields of neutrinos with definite masses : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the field of neutrinos with mass @xmath15 and @xmath16 is the unitary mixing matrix .",
    "if massive neutrinos are majorana particles , the fields @xmath14 satisfy the majorana condition @xmath17 ( @xmath18 is the charge conjugation matrix ) , the total lepton number is not conserved and @xmath7 decay is possible . in the framework of neutrino mixing the process ( [ 01 ] ) is a process of the second order in the cc weak interaction hamiltonian @xmath19 with a virtual neutrino . in ( [ 04 ] ) @xmath20 is the fermi constant and @xmath21 is the standard hadronic charged current .",
    "the matrix element of @xmath7 decay is proportional to the effective majorana neutrino mass ( see , for example , refs.@xcite ) @xmath22    the negative results of the experiments searching for @xmath7 decay imply upper bounds for the the parameter @xmath0 .",
    "the numerical values of the upper bounds depend on the model that is used for the calculation of the nuclear matrix elements . from the results of the @xmath9ge and @xmath10xe experiments",
    "the following upper bounds were obtained : @xmath23 a significant progress in search of neutrinoless double-@xmath6 decay is expected in the future .",
    "several collaborations are planning to reach a sensitivity of @xmath24 for @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "contributions to the matrix element of @xmath7 decay of different non - standard mechanisms for violation of the lepton number ( right - handed currents @xcite , supersymmetry with violation of r - parity @xcite , and others @xcite ) have recently been considered in the literature . at present , it is not possible to distinguish different mechanisms .",
    "it is obvious that it is important to obtain independent information about the contribution to the matrix element of @xmath7 decay of majorana neutrino masses and mixing , given by the effective majorana neutrino mass @xmath0 .    in this paper",
    ", we will show that the existing neutrino oscillation data imply rather strong constraints on the effective majorana mass @xmath0 under the general assumption of a neutrino mass hierarchy .",

    "we will use all these data and the results of the kamiokande @xcite and super - kamiokande @xcite atmospheric neutrino experiments in order to obtain new bounds on the effective majorana mass @xmath0 . in sections",
    "[ constraints from reactor neutrino experiments and the lsnd experiment ] and [ constraints from atmospheric neutrino experiments ] we will see that these data imply rather strong constraints on this parameter . in section [ non - hierarchical neutrino mass spectra ]",
    "we present some remarks on non - hierarchical neutrino mass spectra .",
    "the results of the lep experiments on the measurement of the invisible width of the @xmath25 boson imply that only three flavor neutrinos exist in nature ( see ref.@xcite ) .",
    "the number of light massive majorana neutrinos is equal to three in the case of a left - handed majorana mass term and can be more than three in the general case of a dirac and majorana mass term ( see , for example , refs.@xcite ) .",
    "let us notice that the result of lep measurements does not exclude this last possibility . if the number of light massive majorana neutrinos is more than three , sterile neutrinos must exist .",
    "the sterile fields do not enter in the standard neutral current and their effect is not seen in lep experiments .",
    "we will consider here the simplest case of three light majorana neutrinos . ] .",
    "as is well known , a general characteristic feature of the mass spectra of leptons and quarks is the hierarchy of the masses of the particles of different generations .",
    "what about neutrinos ?",
    "different possibilities for the mass spectrum of three neutrinos were considered in the literature ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we assume that the neutrino masses @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , as in the case of the masses of quarks and leptons , satisfy the hierarchy . ] @xmath29 such a spectrum corresponds to the see - saw mechanism for neutrino mass generation @xcite which is the only known mechanism that explains naturally the smallness of neutrino masses with respect to the masses of other fundamental fermions .",
    "we do not assume , however , any specific ( quadratic or linear ) see - saw relation between neutrino masses .",
    "we will use only the results of neutrino oscillation experiments in the general framework of a hierarchy ( [ 10 ] ) of neutrino masses .    in all solar neutrino experiments ( homestake @xcite , kamiokande @xcite , gallex @xcite , sage @xcite and super - kamiokande @xcite )",
    "the detected event rates are significantly smaller than the event rates predicted by the existing standard solar models ( ssm ) @xcite .",
    "moreover , a phenomenological analysis of the data of the different solar neutrino experiments , in which the values of the neutrino fluxes predicted by the ssm are not used , strongly suggest that the solar neutrino problem is real @xcite . in order to take into account the results of solar neutrino experiments in the framework of a hierarchy of neutrino masses",
    ", it is necessary to assume that @xmath30 is relevant for the suppression of the flux of solar @xmath31 s . in this case , the results of the solar neutrino experiments and the predictions of the ssm can be reconciled if @xmath32 in the case of msw resonant transitions @xcite and just - so vacuum oscillations @xcite , respectively .    under the assumption of a neutrino mass hierarchy ,",
    "the effective majorana mass @xmath0 is given by @xcite @xmath33 with @xmath34 .",
    "in order to obtain information on @xmath35 and the effective majorana mass @xmath0 from the results of reactor oscillation experiments , we will follow the method presented in ref.@xcite ( see also ref.@xcite ) .    in the case of a small @xmath36 and a neutrino mass hierarchy ,",
    "the probability of the transitions @xmath37 of terrestrial neutrinos is given by @xmath38 here @xmath39 is the distance between the neutrino source and the detector and @xmath40 is the neutrino momentum . in eq.([14 ] ) we used the unitarity of the mixing matrix and we took into account the fact that for the distances and energies of neutrinos in terrestrial experiments @xmath41 . for the @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) survival probability , from eq.([14 ] ) we have ( see ref.@xcite ) @xmath44 where the oscillation amplitudes @xmath45 are given by @xmath46    several sbl oscillation experiments with reactor @xmath47 s have been performed in the last years ( see the review in ref.@xcite ) .",
    "no indications in favor of neutrino oscillations were found in these experiments . in our analysis , we will use the exclusion plot of the bugey @xcite experiment and the recently published results of the first lbl neutrino reactor experiment chooz @xcite ( the inclusion of the results of the krasnoyarsk @xcite experiment in the analysis does not add any new constraint ) .",
    "these experimental results provide the most stringent limits for the neutrino oscillation parameter @xmath48 .",
    "we will consider the square of the largest neutrino mass @xmath49 as a parameter and we will consider values of this parameter in the wide range of sensitivity of sbl and lbl reactor neutrino experiments @xmath50    from the 90% cl exclusion plots of reactor neutrino experiments , at any fixed value of @xmath51 in the range ( [ wide ] ) , the amplitude @xmath52 of @xmath53 transitions is bounded by @xmath54 from eqs.([19 ] ) and ( [ 21 ] ) , it follows that @xmath35 must satisfy one of the two inequalities : @xmath55 where @xmath56 in fig.[fig1 ] , we have plotted the values of the parameter @xmath57 obtained from the 90% cl exclusion plots of the bugey and chooz experiments .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows that @xmath57 is small for @xmath51 in the range ( [ wide ] ) .",
    "thus , the results of the reactor oscillation experiments imply that @xmath35 can only be small or large ( close to one ) .",
    "the results of the solar neutrino experiments exclude the possibility of a large value of @xmath35 .",
    "the argument goes as follows .",
    "the averaged probability @xmath58 for solar @xmath31 s to survive , in the case of a neutrino mass hierarchy with @xmath36 relevant for the oscillations of solar neutrinos , is given by ( see ref.@xcite ) @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the @xmath61 survival probability due to the mixing of @xmath62 and @xmath63 and @xmath64 is the neutrino energy . if @xmath65 satisfies the inequality ( [ 23 ] ) , we have @xmath66 . in fig.[fig2 ] we have plotted the values of @xmath67 obtained from the exclusion plots of the bugey and chooz experiments .",
    "it can be seen that @xmath68 for @xmath69 .",
    "furthermore , eq.([25 ] ) implies that the maximal variation of @xmath70 as a function of neutrino energy is given by @xmath71 . if @xmath72 satisfies the inequality ( [ 23 ] )",
    ", we have @xmath73 , which is a very small quantity ( from fig.[fig1 ] one can see that @xmath74 for @xmath51 in the range ( [ wide ] ) and @xmath75 for @xmath69 ) .",
    "thus , if @xmath72 is large , @xmath58 is practically constant .",
    "the large lower bound for the survival probability @xmath76 and its practical independence of the neutrino energy are not compatible with the data of the solar neutrino experiments ( see refs.@xcite ) .",
    "therefore , from the results of solar and reactor neutrino experiments we can conclude that @xmath35 is small and satisfies the inequality ( [ 22 ] ) .    the limit ( [ 22 ] ) for @xmath35",
    "implies the following upper bound for the effective majorana mass @xmath0 : @xmath77 the upper bounds obtained with eq.([26 ] ) from the 90% cl exclusion plots of the bugey @xcite and chooz @xcite experiments for @xmath78 is presented in fig.[fig3 ] ( the solid and dashed lines , respectively ) . the thick solid line in fig.[fig3 ] represents the unitarity upper bound @xmath79 .    as can be seen from fig.[fig3 ]",
    ", the upper bound for the effective majorana mass @xmath0 depends rather strongly on the value of @xmath51 ( whose square root is equal to the heaviest mass @xmath28 ) . from fig.[fig3 ] one can see that if @xmath51 is less than @xmath80 , the effective majorana mass @xmath0 is smaller than @xmath81 .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] show also that if @xmath51 is less than @xmath82 , from exclusion plots of the bugey and chooz experiments it follows that @xmath1 .    up to now",
    "we have considered only the data of reactor neutrino experiments .",
    "let us now take into account also the results of the lsnd experiment @xcite .",
    "the data of this experiment fix an allowed region of @xmath51 .",
    "combined with the negative results of the bugey @xcite and bnl e776 @xcite experiments , the allowed plot of the lsnd experiment imply that @xmath51 lies in the range @xmath83 the corresponding region of allowed values of @xmath0 is represented by the shadowed region in fig.[fig3 ] .",
    "one can see that the results of the lsnd experiment , together with the negative results of other sbl experiments , imply that the value of @xmath0 is very small : @xmath1 .",
    "thus , we conclude that if massive neutrinos are majorana particles and if there is a hierarchy of neutrino masses , the existing data of reactor neutrino experiments imply a strong constraint on the parameter @xmath0 : @xmath84 for @xmath85 .",
    "let us stress that the value @xmath86 corresponds to the sensitivity of the next generation of @xmath7 decay experiments @xcite .    if the results of the lsnd experiment are confirmed by future experiments , the upper bound for the parameter @xmath0 is about @xmath87 .",
    "such small values of @xmath0 can be explored only by @xmath7 decay experiments of future generations ( see ref.@xcite ) .",
    "in the previous section we have obtained constraints on the majorana parameter @xmath0 from the results of reactor experiments and of the lsnd experiment . in this section",
    "we present the allowed region for the parameter @xmath0 obtained from the data of atmospheric neutrino experiments in the scheme with mixing of three majorana neutrinos and a neutrino mass hierarchy .",

    "the matter effect for the atmospheric neutrinos reaching the kamiokande detector from below has been taken into account .",
    "the presence of matter is important because it modifies the phases of neutrino oscillations @xcite and its effect is to enlarge the allowed region towards low values of @xmath51 ( see ref.@xcite ) .",

    "the solid and dashed lines in fig.[fig4 ] represent the upper bounds obtained with eq.([26 ] ) from the 90% cl exclusion plots of the bugey @xcite and chooz @xcite experiments , respectively .",
    "the thick solid line represents the unitarity upper bound @xmath79 . from fig.[fig4 ] it can be seen that the results of the kamiokande experiment , together with the exclusion plots of the bugey and chooz experiments , imply that @xmath106    the horizontally shadowed region in fig.[fig4 ] indicates the range ( [ 34 ] ) of @xmath51 allowed at 90% cl by the preliminary analysis of the data of the super - kamiokande experiment @xcite .",

    "if this is the value of @xmath51 , the exclusion curve of the chooz experiment puts a very strong constraint on @xmath0 : @xmath108    thus we can conclude that in all possible scenarios with mixing of three massive majorana neutrinos and a neutrino mass hierarchy , the existing neutrino oscillation data imply that the effective majorana mass , which characterizes the matrix element of @xmath7 decays , is very small .",
    "in this section we consider the following two possibilities :    i. _ `` inverted '' mass hierarchy of three neutrinos .",
    "_ in the previous sections we have assumed that there are three majorana neutrinos with a hierarchy of masses and that @xmath109 is relevant for the suppression of the flux of solar @xmath31 s .",
    "another possibility to explain the solar neutrino data in the framework of three neutrino mixing is to assume that the neutrino mass spectrum has the form @xcite @xmath110 and @xmath111 is relevant for the suppression of the flux of solar @xmath31 s . in this case ,",

    "the value of @xmath114 depends on @xmath115 . from fig.[fig1 ] one can see that @xmath114 is small for @xmath51 in the range ( [ wide ] ) . in this case , the effective majorana mass is given by @xmath116 if cp is conserved in the lepton sector and the relative cp parity of @xmath63 and @xmath117 is equal to unity , @xmath0 is ( practically ) equal to @xmath118 @xcite . in general , we have @xmath119 thus , in the case of the neutrino mass spectrum ( [ 41 ] ) , the upper bound for the effective majorana mass can be in the ev region . if the spectrum ( [ 41 ] ) is realized in nature , from the inequality ( [ 42 ] ) it follows also that neutrino mass @xmath120 measured in @xmath121-decay experiments is practically equal to the heaviest mass @xcite : @xmath122 let us notice that in the case of a hierarchy of three neutrino masses the contribution of the term that depends on @xmath123 to the @xmath6-spectrum of @xmath121 is suppressed by the factor @xmath124 .",
    "therefore , the observation of the effect of a neutrino mass in the experiments measuring the high - energy part of the @xmath6-spectrum of @xmath121 @xcite would be an indication in favor of the neutrino spectrum ( [ 41 ] ) with an `` inverted '' mass hierarchy .",
    "_ four massive neutrinos .",
    "_ all the existing indications in favor of neutrino mixing ( solar neutrinos , atmospheric neutrinos , lsnd ) can not be described by any scheme with three massive neutrinos @xcite . if we take all data seriously , we need to consider schemes of mixing with ( at least ) four massive neutrinos @xcite , that include not only @xmath31 , @xmath125 and @xmath126 , but also ( at least ) one sterile neutrino . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that among all the possible mass spectra of four neutrinos only two can accommodate all the existing data : @xmath127 in the case of scheme a , @xmath109 is relevant for the atmospheric neutrino anomaly and @xmath128 for the suppression of solar @xmath31 s , whereas in the scheme b the roles of @xmath109 and @xmath128 are reversed . in both schemes two groups of close masses",
    "are separated by the `` lsnd gap '' of the order of 1 ev . in the scheme b , the upper bound for the effective majorana mass is given by @xmath129 with @xmath130 .",
    "hence , in the scheme b the effective majorana mass @xmath0 must satisfy the constraints discussed in section [ constraints from reactor neutrino experiments and the lsnd experiment ] and presented in fig.[fig3 ] .",
    "this means that in the scheme b the contribution of majorana neutrino masses to the amplitude of @xmath7-decay is strongly suppressed . in the scheme",
    "a , the effective majorana mass is bounded by @xmath131 hence , no a priori suppression of the majorana mass contribution to @xmath7-decay is expected in the scheme a.    also the values of the effective neutrino mass @xmath120 measured in the experiments that investigate the high - energy part of the @xmath6-spectrum of @xmath121 @xcite are different in the schemes a and b. in the scheme a we have @xmath132 , whereas in the scheme b the contribution of the term that depends on the heavy masses @xmath133 to the @xmath6-spectrum of @xmath121 is suppressed by the factor @xmath134 .",
    "we have obtained various constraints on the parameter @xmath0 ( that characterizes the contribution of majorana neutrino masses to the matrix element of neutrinoless double - beta decay ) from the results of neutrino oscillation experiments .",
    "we have shown that in the scheme with mixing of three majorana neutrinos and a mass hierarchy ( which corresponds to the see - saw mechanism for the generation of neutrino masses ) the results of neutrino oscillation experiments put rather severe restrictions on the value of @xmath0 .",
    "the numerical value of the upper bound for @xmath0 depends rather strongly on the value of the parameter @xmath135 .",

    "we have also calculated the region of the parameter @xmath0 allowed by the data of the kamiokande atmospheric neutrino experiment , using the recent three - neutrino @xmath99 analysis presented in ref.@xcite .",
    "taking into account this allowed range of @xmath0 and the constraints obtained from the results of the bugey and chooz experiments , we conclude that very small values of @xmath0 are allowed : @xmath138 .",
    "taking into account also the results of the preliminary analysis of super - kamiokande data , an even stronger constraint can be placed : @xmath139 .",
    "the constraints on the value of the effective majorana mass @xmath0 that follow from the results of neutrino oscillation experiments must be taken into account in the interpretation of the data of @xmath7-decay experiments .",
    "the observation of neutrinoless double - beta decay with a probability that corresponds to @xmath4 ( which is the sensitivity of future @xmath7-decay experiments ) would imply that the spectrum of three neutrinos does not follow a hierarchical pattern and the neutrino masses are not of see - saw origin , or that there are more than three massive neutrinos .",
    "this observation could also imply that non - standard mechanisms for the violation of lepton number , such as right - handed currents ( see refs.@xcite ) , supersymmetry with violation of r - parity @xcite , and others @xcite , are responsible for neutrinoless double - beta decay .",
    "thus , the observation of @xmath7-decay could allow us to obtain information not only about the nature of massive neutrinos ( dirac or majorana ? ) , but also about the pattern of the mass spectrum of neutrinos and/or about non - standard mechanisms of violation of the lepton number .",

    "<S> it follows that @xmath1 if @xmath2 ( @xmath3 is the largest mass - squared difference ) . </S>",
    "<S> hence , we conclude that the observation of neutrinoless double - beta decay with a probability that corresponds to @xmath4 would be a signal for a non - hierarchical neutrino mass spectrum and/or non - standard mechanisms of lepton number violation . </S>"
