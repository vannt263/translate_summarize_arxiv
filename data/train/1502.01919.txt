    "the notion of distortion was introduced by gromov  @xcite .",
    "if @xmath1 is a rectifiable simple closed curve in @xmath2 , then its distortion @xmath3 is defined as    @xmath4    where @xmath5 denotes the length of the shorter arc connecting @xmath6 and @xmath7 in @xmath1 and @xmath8 denotes the euclidean norm on @xmath2 . for a knot @xmath9",
    ", its distortion @xmath10 is defined as the infimum of @xmath11 over all rectifiable curves @xmath1 in the isotopy class @xmath9 .",
    "gromov  @xcite asked in 1983 if every knot @xmath9 has distortion @xmath12",
    ". the question was open for almost three decades until pardon gave a negative answer .",
    "his work  @xcite presents a lower bound for the distortion of simple closed curves on closed pl embedded surfaces with positive genus .",
    "pardon showed that the minimal intersection number of such a curve with essential discs of the corresponding surface bounds the distortion of the curve from below .",
    "in particular for the @xmath13-torus knot he obtained the following bound .",
    "let @xmath14 denote the @xmath13-torus knot .",
    "then @xmath15    by considering a standard embedding of @xmath16 on a torus of revolution one obtains @xmath17 , hence for @xmath18 pardons result is sharp up to constants .",
    "an alternative proof for the existence of families with unbounded distortion was given by gromov and guth  @xcite .",
    "in both works the answer of gromovs question was obtained by an estimate of the conformal length , which is up to a constant a lower bound for the distortion of rectifiable closed curves .",
    "however the conformal length is in general not a good estimate for the distortion .",
    "for example one finds easily an embedding of the @xmath0-torus knot with conformal length @xmath19 and distortion @xmath20 by looking at standard embeddings on a torus of revolution with suitable dimensions .",
    "in particular neither pardon s nor gromov and guth s arguments yield lower bounds for @xmath21 . while pardon writes that surely @xmath22 and that there are to his knowledge no known embeddings of @xmath23 with sublinear distortion  @xcite [ p.2 ] , gromov and guth  @xcite write that the distortion of @xmath23 appears to be @xmath24 up to constants [ p.33 ] . in this article",
    "we show that the growth rate of @xmath21 is in fact sublinear in @xmath24 .",
    "[ t1 ] let @xmath25",
    ". then @xmath26 .",
    "in particular the distortion of the @xmath0-torus knot is not bounded linearly from below .",
    "most thank is owed to sebastian baader and pierre dehornoy for their inspiring introduction to the topic .",
    "i would like to thank john pardon for useful comments on the presented example and peter feller , filip misev , johannes josi and livio liechti for many mathematical discussions .",
    "i also thank paul frischknecht for the pictures .",
    "in order to prove theorem  [ t1 ] we need to give for every odd integer @xmath27 an embedding @xmath1 of the @xmath0-torus knot with distortion smaller or equal to @xmath28 . the idea is to use a logarithmic spiral .",
    "let @xmath29 be a logarithmic spiral of unit length starting at its center @xmath30 and ending at some @xmath31 .",
    "an elementary calculation shows that its distortion is equal to @xmath32 . for another path @xmath33 of unit length and diameter @xmath34 with endpoints",
    "@xmath35 we get @xmath36 hence up to at most a factor @xmath37 the logarithmic spiral has the smallest distortion among all paths for a prescribed pathlength - pathdiameter - ratio .",
    "it seems therefore natural to pack the @xmath24 windings of the @xmath0-torus knot into a logarithmic spiral in order to minimize distortion .",
    "[ proof of theorem 1 ] let @xmath24 be an odd integer greater or equal to @xmath38 , and @xmath39 .",
    "we define the embedding @xmath1 as the union of a segment of the logarithmic spiral with slope @xmath40 , denoted by @xmath29 , and a piecewise linear part , denoted by @xmath41 , see figure  [ f2 ] . the segment of the logarithmic spiral s is contained in the yellow painted @xmath42 plane and parametrized by @xmath43 \\to { \\mathbf{r}}^2 ,   \\   \\   \\",

    "\\sin(s )              \\\\ \\end{pmatrix } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] see figures  [ f2 ] and [ f3 ] .",
    "the segment of the piecewise linear part l is in the green painted @xmath44 plane , see figures  [ f2 ] and [ f4 ] .",
    "note that @xmath45 hence the lengths defining @xmath41 in figure  [ f4 ] are chosen such that the union @xmath1 of @xmath29 and @xmath41 is the simple closed curve illustrated in figure  [ f2 ] .",
    "the linear segments @xmath46 and @xmath47 indicated in figure  [ f4 ] are named because of their special role in the following computations .    to see that the obtained curve is an embedded @xmath0-torus knot , we perturb @xmath1 , see figure  [ f5 ] .",
    "this simple closed curve is ambient isotopic in @xmath2 to @xmath1 and if we project it onto the @xmath44 plane , we see a well known diagram of the @xmath0-torus knot , see figure  [ f6 ] .                              in the case where @xmath75 , we make the estimate with the path that connects @xmath6 with @xmath7 through @xmath76 .",
    "it works exactly the same and yields the same estimate .",
    "_ case 3 : @xmath77 _ consider figure  [ f4 ] and note that all pairs of points @xmath78 that could cause big distortion are of euclidean distance at least 1 .",
    "therefore we get @xmath79 a calculation shows that @xmath80 for q greater or equal to 50 . _",
    "case 4 : @xmath81 _ note that for these pairs of points we have @xmath82 we estimate @xmath83 using results of case 1 and 3 : @xmath84 we conclude that @xmath85 which finishes the proof .    with the same technique and somewhat more effort one can give an embedding @xmath86 of @xmath23 with @xmath87 .",
    "in addition a more technical proof yields that this asymptotical upper bound for @xmath21 is sharp for those embeddings of @xmath23 that project to a standard knot diagram via a linear projection .",
