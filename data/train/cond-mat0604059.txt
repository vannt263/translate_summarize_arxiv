    "we focus on the surface oscillator through @xmath27 . if @xmath28 is the matrix that performs the change of basis from sites to diagonal form in @xmath29 , one has:@xmath30 that is , the @xmath31th eigenmode projection over @xmath20th site .",
    "in this case one can write,@xmath32    by performing the analytical continuation @xmath33 for @xmath34 and taking its imaginary component , one obtains the spectral density associated to the surface site . in the case where @xmath35 bulk modes and surface modes have no projection and oscillations",
    "survive undamped .",
    "@xmath34 can be obtained through an infinite order perturbation theory @xcite that accounts for the surface mode corrections due to the presence of the neighbor oscillators .",
    "let us begin with the surface oscillator and a single bulk mass .",
    "if the two masses are uncoupled ( @xmath36 ) the surface frequency is simply @xmath37 but if @xmath38 , eq.([eq_greenop ] ) yields@xmath39    here , @xmath37 is affected by the static correction @xmath40 and the dynamic correction @xmath41 due to presence of the other oscillator .    by taking the limit of the oscillators number to infinite , the dynamic correction becomes@xmath42    because of the presence of an infinite number of oscillators at the right",
    ", a correction on the @xmath8th oscillator is just the same as that in the @xmath43th oscillator .",
    "the solution of eq.([eq_correction ] ) is complex and its imaginary part gives the decay rate of a surface excitation with frequency @xmath17 .",
    "therefore , in the thermodynamic limit , the temporal recurrences @xcite ( mesoscopic echoes @xcite ) disappear .",
    "in the case of a surface oscillator with natural frequency @xmath37 , coupled to an infinite number of bulk oscillators , the green s function is:@xmath44    hence , in the region of continuous modes ( @xmath45 ) one has@xmath46 where @xmath47 is a first approximation to the resonance frequency and@xmath48 describes the dissipation process . comparing eq.([eq_green ] ) with a standard damped oscillator ( frictional force proportional to velocity )",
    ", it is easy to see that in the broadband limit ( @xmath49 @xmath50 and @xmath51 . )",
    "they have the same behavior taking @xmath52 as friction coefficient .    for a dynamic description of the surface oscillator",
    ", we look for the pole structure of @xmath34 , equivalent to find @xmath17 such that:@xmath53    if we denote the surface mode frequency as @xmath54 and @xmath55 as@xmath56 then one has@xmath57{cc}% -\\sqrt{\\omega_{0}^{2}+\\delta\\left [   \\omega_{-}^{2}+\\sqrt{\\omega_{+}% ^{4}-4\\omega_{x}^{2}\\omega_{0}^{2}}\\right ]   } & p<-1\\\\ \\sqrt{\\omega_{0}^{2}+\\delta\\left [   \\omega_{-}^{2}-\\mathrm{i}\\sqrt{4\\omega _ { x}^{2}\\omega_{0}^{2}-\\omega_{+}^{4}}\\right ]   } & \\left\\vert p\\right\\vert \\leq1\\\\ \\sqrt{\\omega_{0}^{2}+\\delta\\left [   \\omega_{-}^{2}-\\sqrt{\\omega_{+}^{4}% -4\\omega_{x}^{2}\\omega_{0}^{2}}\\right ]   } & p>1 \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] where @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "the dependence of the pole with @xmath37 can be seen in fig.[fig_resonance ] .",
    "[ h ]    resdamp.eps    here , we show the real and imaginary parts of the pole separately and we find three well - defined regimes that emphasize the onset of quite different dynamical properties .",
    "* localized - extended transition . *",
    "this transition occurs when @xmath37 lays close to the upper band edge .",
    "there , the real part of the pole makes an excursion into the band gap conserving an imaginary component which is lost at the cusp zoomed in the inset .",
    "this is analogous to the virtual states described by hogreve @xcite for electronic states which are missed under other approximations @xcite .",
    "they become real normalized states which are exponentially localized @xcite when the pole touches back the band edge .",
    "it can be seen in fig.[fig_resonance ] that for large values of surface natural frequency @xmath60 we only have real component in @xmath61 and the oscillation frequency is approximately @xmath37 . in this localized regime , displacements are exponentially smaller as the oscillators increase their distance to the surface .",
    "the lack of an imaginary part implies that the displacement amplitude , independently of bulk oscillators ,  survives indefinitely . in other words",
    ", there is no energy propagation to bulk oscillators .",
    "as @xmath37 decreases , below a critical frequency @xmath62 , @xmath61 becomes complex .",
    "its real part is the resonance frequency whereas its imaginary part describes the dissipation .",
    "this is the extended oscillatory regime where surface oscillations have an @xmath63 frequency and the amplitude of displacement decays with a lifetime proportional to @xmath64",
    ".    * oscillatory - overdamped transition . * for @xmath65",
    "the system is in the regime where @xmath66 and hence eq.([eq_polos1 ] ) yields ohmic dissipation in which the surface kinetic energy decays into bulk modes without return .",
    "this describes a frictional force proportional to the velocity .",
    "as @xmath37 goes below the critical frequency @xmath67 , the pole of the green s function @xmath61 becomes purely imaginary .",
    "this is the overdamped regime where no oscillations occur .",
    "notice that @xmath68 decreases at both sides of the transition , this means that a further decrease of @xmath37 or increase in the friction @xmath69 also implies a _ decrease _ in the relaxation rate .",
    "all this counter intuitive effect arrises from the exact solution of the simple mechanical model .    considering eq.([eq_displacement ] ) , we can complete our previous analysis obtaining the time evolution of surface displacement by performing a numerical fourier transform of the analytical expression for @xmath34 .",
    "these results coincide with the numerical integration of the equation of motion in the hamilton - jacobi representation which is performed with an _ ad hoc _ version of the trotter - suzuki method @xcite . setting the ratio @xmath70 between masses and fourier transforming for several @xmath37 values in the previously mentioned regimes ,",
    "we obtain the displacement pattern shown in fig.[fig_dynamic ] .",
    "[ h ]    dynamic.eps    here , the time evolution of the surface displacement depends on the initial condition .",
    "it is easy to see in this picture how gray regions `` diverge '' near the critical frequency @xmath71 so that for smaller @xmath37 values @xmath72 is always positive . on the other hand",
    ", the period of the oscillation ( reflected from the fringe edges ) shows a cusp at @xmath73 where it start to increase again .",
    "this is consistent with the decrease of @xmath63 as @xmath37 crosses @xmath73 ( see inset in fig.[fig_resonance ] ) .",
    "dynamical features in dissipation processes have been described by a simple classical model that contains the essential properties of a surface oscillator interacting with bulk vibrational modes .",
    "we arrive to results equivalent to the phenomenological description of dissipation where these effects are summarized in a single term proportional to the oscillator velocity .",
    "a complete analytical solution of the dynamics allowed us to identify a variety of dynamical phases available for the vibrational excitations : localized , extended oscillatory and overdamped .",
    "two numerical methods ( fft and a trotter - suzuki algorithm ) have been employed to obtain the dynamics with equivalent results .",
    "the identification of the different dynamical regimes becomes very important in nano - physics when cantilevers @xcite involving a relative small number of atoms fail to satisfy the standard thermodynamical approximations .",
    "localization , weak diffusion and recurrences become usual phenomena in the nanomechanical devices . in a quantum description of finite size systems",
    ", we should consider the quantization of oscillation amplitudes .",
    "our formalism , based on the green s functions in discrete but open systems , seems to be the ideal tool for this purpose ."
