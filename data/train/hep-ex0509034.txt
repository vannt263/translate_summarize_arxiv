    "since the discovery of the @xmath0 at brookhaven  @xcite and slac  @xcite in 1974 , more than one hundred exclusive decay modes of the @xmath0 have been reported .",
    "the @xmath0 decays provide an excellent source of events to study light hadron spectroscopy and search for glueballs , hybrids , and exotic states .",
    "recently , @xmath2 @xmath0 events have been obtained with the upgraded beijing spectrometer ( besii)@xcite .",
    "many important results on the search for multiquark , study oc the light scalar mesons and excited baryon states , as well as the measurements of @xmath0 decays are performed based on this data sample .",
    "in this letter , we report the first analysis on the @xmath3 decay channel . in the analysis , @xmath4 is tagged in its two decay modes , @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "igure  [ x1835dis](a ) shows the @xmath7 invariant mass distribution and the @xmath4 signal is seen . the @xmath8 invariant mass spectrum for the selected events is shown in fig .",
    "[ x1835dis](b ) , where a peak at a mass around 1835 mev / c@xmath9 is observed .",
    "the @xmath10 invariant mass distribution shows a clear @xmath4 signal ( fig .",
    "[ x1835dis ] ( c ) ) .",
    "a peak near 1835  mev / c@xmath9 is also evident in the @xmath8 invariant mass spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ x1835dis ] ( d ) ) .",
    "figure  [ x1835fit ] shows the @xmath8 invariant mass spectrum for the combined @xmath3 @xmath11 and @xmath3 @xmath12 samples .",
    "a clear peak near 1835  mev / c@xmath9 is observed . to ensure that the peak near 1835  mev / c@xmath9 is not due to background , we have made extensive studies of potential background processes using both data and mc .",
    "non-@xmath4 processes are studied with @xmath4 mass - sideband events .",
    "the main background channel , @xmath13 , and other background processes with multi - photons and/or with kaons are reconstructed with the data .",
    "in addition , we also checked for possible backgrounds with a mc sample of 60 million @xmath14 decays generated according to the lund model  @xcite .",
    "none of these backgrounds are found to produce a peak around 1835 mev / c@xmath9 in the @xmath8 invariant mass spectrum .",
    "this spectrum is fitted with a breit - wigner ( bw ) function convolved with a gaussian mass resolution function ( with @xmath15  mev / c@xmath9 ) to represent the @xmath16 signal plus a smooth polynomial background function . the bw mass and width obtained from the fit ( shown in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ x1835fit ] ) are @xmath17 mev / c@xmath9 and @xmath18 mev / c@xmath9 . the bw signal yield from the fit is @xmath19 events and the statistical significance for the signal is 7.7  @xmath20 .",
    "the mass and width of the @xmath16 are not consistent with any known particle  @xcite .",
    "while the measured @xmath16 mass is consistent with the mass obtained from the @xmath21 channel , the measured width is higher by @xmath22 than the upper limit on the width reported in ref .",
    "thus , the @xmath16 is a candidate for the resonance that produces the @xmath23 mass threshold enhancement in @xmath21 process .",
    "using mc - determined selection efficiencies of @xmath24 and @xmath25 for @xmath26 and @xmath6 modes , respectively , we find the product branching fraction to be :    @xmath27",
    "the analysis on a study of @xmath28 resonances was reported in ref .",
    "more than 100 thousand @xmath29 candidate events are obtained and the backgound level is about 8% .",
    "there are four clear peaks around 1360 mev/@xmath30 , 1500 mev/@xmath30 , 1670 mev/@xmath30 and 2065 mev/@xmath30 observed in the @xmath31 invariant mass spectrum , as shown in fig .",
    "[ nstar ] .",
    "they are the first direct observation of the @xmath32 peak and a long - sought `` missing '' @xmath33 peaks above 2 gev in the @xmath34 invariant mass spectrum .",
    "a simple breit - wigner fit gives the mass and width for the @xmath32 peak as @xmath35 mev/@xmath30 and @xmath36 mev/@xmath30 , and for the new @xmath33 peaks above 2 gev as @xmath37 mev/@xmath30 and @xmath38 mev/@xmath30 .",
    "the largest @xmath0 sample , 58 million @xmath0 events , offers a unique opportunity to measure precisely the branching fractions of @xmath0 decays .",
    "the largest @xmath14 decay involving hadronic resonances is @xmath39 .",
    "its branching fraction is measured to be @xmath40@xcite which is obviously higher than the pdg value,@xmath41 . to check this result , we present another independent measurements of this branching fraction obtained from a comparison of the rates for @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "the result is @xmath45 which is consistent with that obtained from direct @xmath0 decays .",
    "the weight mean of these two measurements is @xmath46 which is in good agreement with the subsequent result , @xmath47@xcite , from babar collaboration .",
    "then we presented the branching fractions of @xmath48 which are shown in table .",

    "@xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 are observed and their branching fractions are measured for the first time to be @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 .",
    "the large @xmath0 sample also provides a chance to observed new decay modes of @xmath1 through @xmath58 . in the analysis ,",
    "the decays of @xmath1 to @xmath59 and @xmath60 are observed for the first time .",
    "the product branching fractions are determined to be @xmath61 @xmath62 and @xmath63 , respectively . the upper limits of @xmath64 is also obtained as @xmath65 at 90% confidence level .",
    "based on @xmath66 @xmath0 events accumulated at the besii detector , a resonance around 1835 mev/@xmath30 is observed in @xmath3 which could be the same struncture observed in @xmath21 .",
