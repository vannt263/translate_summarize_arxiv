    "composite systems where microscopic bodies move in a viscous fluid are ubiquitous in both biological and technological contexts , and the flows involved are often characterized by very small reynolds numbers . in an early seminal contribution , stokes @xcite computed the flow past a translating rigid sphere in the low - reynolds - number limit , determining the corresponding drag force and showing how newtonian liquids can evade dalembert s paradox .",
    "this result was extended to ellipsoidal particle shapes by oberbeck @xcite , and to the case of rotating and shearing surrounding flows by edwardes @xcite and jeffery @xcite , respectively .",
    "the solution for a general surrounding flow was provided by kim and karrila @xcite .",
    "an explicit solution of the same problem for a rigid body of general shape immersed in a low - reynolds - number flow appears to be out of reach , but the broad spectrum of possible applications have favoured the development of methods to approximate the velocity field generated by the body , or at least the drag force and torque exerted on it . for a rigid body",
    "whose length is large compared with its breadth , starting with an idea of burgers @xcite , various authors , including tuck @xcite , tillett @xcite , batchelor @xcite , and cox @xcite , have contributed to the development of what is known as slender - body theory . in essence ,",
    "that theory provides approximate expressions for the relevant quantities simulating the action of the immersed body on the surrounding fluid by means of force and torque distributions concentrated on suitable lines .",
    "the flow generated by those distributions is divergent precisely on the lines where forces concentrate , hence the use of the name `` singularity method '' to describe this technique .",
    "the same methodology has been exploited also for particles which are not slender since the formative contribution of oseen @xcite and a clear account of it with applications to stokes flows is given by chwang & wu @xcite .    despite the possibility of approximating with good accuracy many quantities of physical interest , it is difficult to apply classical slender - body theory to particles of arbitrary shape and to situations featuring the presence of many particles , which are clearly important for applications .",
    "for this reason , modifications of the theory have been proposed by de  mestre @xcite , johnson @xcite , barta and liron @xcite , and barta @xcite , and also somewhat different theories have been developed by lighthill @xcite and keller and rubinow @xcite . in a recent paper , cortez and nicholas @xcite presented a new theory in which the concentrated force densities are replaced by forces which are localized in a small three - dimensional region lying within the slender body .",
    "our approach can be viewed as complementary to theirs , in that we consider not only concentrated force distributions , but also concentrated bodies , regularizing in turn the flow equation .",
    "we propose a new slender - body theory which can be applied to rigid bodies whose slenderness can affect one dimension ( flat bodies ) , two dimensions ( elongated bodies ) , or even three dimensions ( point - like spherical particles ) .",
    "in so doing , we are motivated by the understanding that the hyperviscous regularization of the stokes equation described in  [ sec : hypvis ] makes it possible to obtain a solution for the flow past a translating point - like spherical particle such that : ( i ) the drag exerted by the particle on the fluid is equal to the total viscous traction exerted on a newtonian fluid by a spherical particle ; ( ii ) the solution of the regularized problem is a good approximation of the classical solution for a point - like sphere .",
    "moreover , by comparing the classical and regularized solutions , it is possible to assign to the coefficient of the hyperviscous term the geometric meaning of effective thickness of the slender body , as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : drhyp ] .    in  [ sec : greenf ]",
    ", we derive the green s function for the regularized stokes operator , which is exploited , in  [ sec : sph0 ] , to compute the flow generated by a point - like spherical particle , and to evaluate the hydrodynamic interaction between point - like spheres .",
    "the problem of the flow generated by a rigid rod is considered in  [ sec : rod ] , where some limitations of the singularity method , associated with the rigidity constraint , are considered . in the final discussion ,",
    "we mention possible advantages in numerical simulations based on our theory , and we outline further developments .",
    "the classical stokes equation for incompressible newtonian fluids , that is the low - reynolds - number linearisation of the navier  stokes equation , reads @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the pressure field , @xmath2 is the divergence - free velocity field , @xmath3 is the constant and homogeneous mass density , @xmath4 is the dynamic viscosity , and @xmath5 is a volumetric force density . for a steady flow , the stokes equation reduces to @xmath6    it is well - known that the regularity of solutions to the three - dimensional navier  stokes equation is still an open problem , and various modifications of that equation with better regularity theories have been analysed . among those , the hyperviscous regularization ( see lions @xcite , chap .",
    "i , remarque 6.11 ) entails adding a term proportional to @xmath7 to the equation . for this modified equation ,",
    "the existence and uniqueness of regular solutions ( that is of solutions which are continuous on the flow domain for every instant in a finite time interval ) have been established .",
    "the low - reynolds - number linearisation of that equation is , for a steady flow , @xmath8 where the additional parameter @xmath9 is called the hyperviscosity .    despite the mathematical appeal of the hyperviscous regularization , assigning a relevant physical meaning",
    "to @xmath10 can be problematic , other than that of a higher - order dissipation coefficient . in a series of papers , fried and gurtin @xcite , musesti @xcite , giusteri _ _ et al .  _",
    "@xcite , and giusteri @xcite introduce and analyse different contributions to @xmath10 associated with dissipation functionals . here , we assign to @xmath10 a geometric , rather than dynamical , meaning , thereby allowing for a clearer interpretation in terms of standard physical quantities . to this end",
    ", we introduce a length - scale @xmath11 , and set @xmath12 , so that the hyperviscous steady flow equation becomes @xmath13      in the slender - body theory presented in this paper , the length scale @xmath14 is viewed as the effective thickness of the lower - dimensional objects which approximate three - dimensional bodies that are in one way or another slender .",
    "we now clarify how the hyperviscous regularization discussed above can be combined with dimensional reduction to approximate the flow past slender bodies , and elucidate the role of @xmath14 in this procedure .",
    "recall the stokes problem of determining the steady flow @xmath15 past a rigid sphere @xmath16 of radius @xmath14 centred at the origin , @xmath17 where @xmath18 denotes the constant far - field velocity .",
    "the hyperviscous stokes problem for the steady flow @xmath2 past a point - like spherical particle placed at the origin has the form @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the three - dimensional dirac distribution and @xmath21 is the drag force .",
    "notice that a far - field condition akin to that entering   is not imposed in  .",
    "however ,   admits a unique solution , and the value of @xmath2 at infinity is determined by the force @xmath21 .",
    "the solution to the stokes equation   in the entirety of @xmath22 is divergent at the origin ; the solution of   ( with @xmath11 ) is bounded and continuous in @xmath23 , making explicit the reason why the hyperviscous equation   is considered a regularization of the classical one , namely   with @xmath24 .",
    "it is important to notice that , in the limit @xmath25 , the problem   becomes ill - posed .    in  [",
    "sec : sphere ] , we solve explicitly problem  , showing that , far enough from the sphere of radius @xmath14 , @xmath2 is a good approximation of the solution @xmath15 of problem  .",
    "moreover , @xmath2 takes at the origin the same value taken by @xmath15 on the spherical surface @xmath26 , and it turns out that , to obtain also @xmath27 at infinity , we must take the drag force exerted by the point - like spherical particle as @xmath28 where @xmath29 denotes the unit outward normal to @xmath26 and @xmath30 denotes the transpose of @xmath31 .",
    "namely , @xmath21 must be equal to the traction exerted on the fluid by the sphere in problem  .",
    "it is precisely this last fact which suggests the interpretation of @xmath14 as the effective thickness of the point - like spherical particle .",
    "a point - like spherical particle represents a body which is slender in all spatial directions , but we are interested also in describing the motion of flat and elongated bodies . actually , there are two different classes of problems worthy of mention : resistance problems and mobility problems .    * in a resistance problem , the velocities of the immersed objects are assigned and the goal is to determine the drag force required to sustain the motion . * in a mobility problem , the forces acting on the immersed objects are prescribed and the goal is to determine the resulting velocity field .",
    "the solution of resistance and mobility problems in the case of a point - like spherical particle provides a linear relation between the assigned velocity and the drag force , which is the only force acting on the point - like spherical particle .",
    "the situation is remarkably different when dealing with flat or elongated rigid bodies .",
    "whereas in resistance problems the prescription of the velocity of an immersed body automatically includes the rigidity constraint , the same constraint can be imposed in mobility problems only by assigning as force density the sum of the drag force and the reactive forces that are generated within an immersed body as a consequence of the assumption that it is rigid .",
    "we comment further on this in  [ sec : rod ] .",
    "the basic tool used to construct solutions to the stokes problem is the stokeslet , that is the green s function for the stokes operator in @xmath22 .",
    "its classical expression is given by @xmath32 @xmath33({\\vec{x}}-{\\vec{x}}')}{8\\pi\\mu|{\\vec{x}}-{\\vec{x}}'|^3}\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath34 is any fixed vector and @xmath35 is the oseen tensor , with cartesian components @xmath36 where @xmath37 is kronecker s symbol .",
    "to compute the regularized stokeslet , we first need a green s function solution @xmath38 of the fourth - order elliptic equation @xmath39 using the fourier transform , we easily obtain @xmath40 we choose a basis for the momentum space in such a way that @xmath41 is along the @xmath42-direction , set @xmath43 , switch to polar coordinates @xmath44 , and use the calculus of residues to obtain @xmath45\\\\ & \\mbox{}=\\frac{1}{(2\\pi)^2\\mu r}\\left(\\pi-\\pi e^{-\\frac{r}{l}}\\right).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] hence , the desired green s function is @xmath46\\,.\\ ] ] notice that , in the limit @xmath25 , reduces to the green s function @xmath47 for the laplace equation .",
    "we now proceed to construct the regularized stokeslet , that is a pressure field @xmath48 and a velocity field @xmath49 satisfying @xmath50 with @xmath34 and @xmath51 .",
    "let @xmath52 satisfy @xmath53 . then , since @xmath54 commutes with @xmath55 , a solution for   is given by @xmath56 @xmath57 the scalar field @xmath58 entering this solution is chosen to satisfy the divergence - free constraint and turns out to have the explicit form @xmath59 where @xmath60 is as defined in .",
    "now , exploiting the properties of the convolution and of the operator @xmath54 , and using the green s function @xmath38 given by equation  , we find that @xmath61 and , with a procedure similar to that leading to  , @xmath62 \\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we used the notation @xmath63 .    defining now , for @xmath64 , the functions @xmath65 and @xmath66 we can write our regularized stokeslet as @xmath67 @xmath68 notice that the regularization does not alter the pressure field . moreover , the velocity field @xmath49 is well - defined for any @xmath69 , as is the green s function @xmath38 , at variance with the classical expression for @xmath70 , which is singular at the origin .",
    "we also define the tensor field @xmath71 , the regularized oseen tensor , such that , using cartesian components , @xmath72 whereby it follows that @xmath73 .",
    "the stokeslet allows us to obtain an integral representation for the solution of  , with vanishing condition at infinity , in the form of a convolution : @xmath74    due to the regularity of the tensor @xmath71 at the origin and the properties of convolution , @xmath2 as determined by   is bounded and continuous on all of space , even if the force density @xmath5 is localized on a set of zero lebesgue measure  for example , if @xmath75 is a measure concentrated on a lower - dimensional subset of @xmath22 , determines a well - behaved velocity field .",
    "this makes it possible to model interactions between the fluid and lower - dimensional objects by assigning force distribution concentrated on them , and thereby to turn the approximate singularity solutions of the classical theory into exact solutions of an approximate model .",
    "notice that although   readily offers a solution for mobility problems , the force density @xmath75 must represent the interactions taking place in all of space , not only in the fluid region ; knowledge of both the drag force applied on the rigid body and the reactive forces generated within the body is therefore required .",
    "the mobility problem for a point - like spherical particle subjected to a drag force density @xmath76 ( viewed in a reference frame in which the point - like spherical particle is at rest ) can be readily solved on applying formula  , and doing so gives the velocity field @xmath77    the resistance problem requires a bit more of work . recall that the disturbance field generated by a sphere rigidly translating with constant velocity @xmath78 in a newtonian liquid is given by ( see _ _ e.g .  _",
    "_ @xcite ) @xmath79 where the constants @xmath80 and @xmath81 can be determined by imposing the no - slip condition @xmath82 on the surface of any sphere of finite radius .",
    "however , since @xmath83 is divergent at the origin , we can not impose the no - slip condition on a point - like spherical particle , namely a sphere with vanishing radius .    for a hyperviscous liquid",
    ", we seek the divergence - free disturbance field @xmath2 produced by a translating sphere .",
    "it satisfies the equation @xmath84 since , given a velocity field @xmath83 defined on all of space , it is always possible to find a pressure field @xmath85 such that @xmath86 , any solution of @xmath87 provides a solution for  , with pressure @xmath85 .",
    "it is readily checked that @xmath88 is a particular solution of  .",
    "we write the general solution of the associated homogeneous equation , using spherical coordinates @xmath89 , as @xmath90 where @xmath91",
    "are vectors of coefficients , @xmath92 are spherical hankel functions of the first kind , and @xmath93 are spherical harmonics .",
    "any solution of   is then of the form @xmath94 , and the boundary conditions determine the coefficients .",
    "we now wish to show that it is possible to obtain a disturbance field that is bounded at the origin and satisfies the no - slip condition on a sphere with vanishing radius .",
    "we assume without loss of generality that @xmath95 , and we write the cartesian components of @xmath2 in spherical coordinates ( the angular dependence of @xmath93 being understood ) , obtaining : @xmath96 @xmath97 @xmath98 thanks to the orthogonality of the spherical harmonics and the properties of the spherical hankel functions , imposing @xmath99 , we find , for any value of @xmath80 , that @xmath100 and that the other non - vanishing coefficients are given by @xmath101 the third condition , namely @xmath102 , implies that @xmath103 , @xmath104 , and @xmath105 , while all the remaining @xmath106 vanish .    hence , the disturbance field is given by @xmath107 @xmath108 @xmath109 we thus find that the velocity field , in a reference frame in which the point - like spherical particle is at rest , is @xmath110 comparing   and  , we conclude that the drag force needed to sustain the latter motion is given by the celebrated stokes relation @xmath111 . finally , when @xmath112 , the difference between the velocity field given by   and the classical solution of  , obtained by   with @xmath105 and @xmath113 , is small and decays as @xmath114 in the far field .",
    "for the resistance problem related to the motion of two point - like spherical particles translating with constant velocity , it is tempting to exploit the correspondence developed in  [ sec : sphere ] , and solve instead the mobility problem , using   and the superposition principle .",
    "that procedure works only when the two point - like spheres move with the same velocity , because the flow produced by the motion of the particles must be steady .",
    "let us consider the disturbance field @xmath115 produced by the two particles translating with velocity @xmath78 .",
    "we apply the drag force density @xmath116 to the system , where @xmath117 and @xmath118 are the positions of the particles in a co - moving frame . now",
    "the solution of the mobility problem reads @xmath119 and , to find the solution for the resistance problem , we must be able to choose @xmath120 and @xmath121 in such a way that @xmath122 .",

    ", we find that a component of the force which is not in the direction of the motion is needed . that additional component of force is required to cancel the hydrodynamic interaction which tends to move the points away from the desired trajectory , since the leading point ( the one in front with respect to the direction of @xmath78 ) pulls and is pushed by the other point with a force directed along @xmath126 .      even though the above techniques can not provide the full solution to the unsteady situation in which two point - like spherical particles move with different velocities , it is possible to utilize a procedure , known as method of reflections ( see kim and karrila @xcite ) , to approximate the instantaneous flow field and the instantaneous hydrodynamic interaction between the particles .",
    "so far , we have considered particles moving in a fluid which is at rest at infinity , but it is easy to include the effect of more complicated conditions in the far - field , as described by a field @xmath128 . indeed , the disturbance field produced by a particle uniformly translating with velocity @xmath78 in an ambient flow @xmath128 is @xmath129\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath130 is the position of the particle in a co - moving frame .",
    "the method of reflections for two particles ( labelled @xmath131 and @xmath132 ) consists of an iterative scheme which , at every step @xmath133 , takes as ambient field for a particle @xmath128 plus the field generated by the other particle in the step @xmath134 .",

    "it therefore becomes easy to keep track of the order of the approximation in terms of that small parameter : the @xmath133-th approximation @xmath152 is exact up to the order @xmath153 .",
    "the same is not true if we extend the procedure to the case of @xmath154 point - like spherical particles , because of the appearance of corrections to lower - order terms even after many iterations .",

    "!    indeed , such a solution is almost constant in a neighbourhood of the origin , and it would still be possible to impose a genuinely constant velocity on the boundary of a slender body of non - vanishing breadth , when @xmath177 lies well within it . this justifies the classical approximation for slender bodies , but , since the object under consideration is one - dimensional , we actually need to obtain a velocity field which is exactly constant on the whole of @xmath177 .",

    ", we observe that the magnitude of the force needed to sustain the motion increases with @xmath14 .",
    "we have presented a new slender - body theory , which , in contrast to previously developed alternatives , might be viewed as a modelling scheme , based on the concepts of dimensional reduction and hyperviscous regularization .",
    "we propose to approximate the geometry of flat , elongated , or point - like rigid bodies immersed in a viscous fluid with lower - dimensional objects , while adding a hyperviscous term to the flow equation .",
    "the hyperviscosity is given by the product of the ordinary viscosity with the square of a length that replaces the characteristic size of the body along the dimensions that are shrunken to zero in the slender - body limit .",
    "we explicitly solved some simple problems to show that the proposed method is able to represent with good approximation both the velocity field and the drag forces generated by rigid motions of the immersed bodies , in analogy with classical slender - body theories .",
    "the regularized stokeslet and the regularized oseen tensor were determined .",
    "these objects are basic to the solution of mobility problems , in which the concentrated force density acting on the system is prescribed .",
    "we explained the limitations of this kind of solution technique , which stems from the need to determine the reactive force arising from the rigidity constraint . that force can be computed starting from the solution of resistance problems , in which the velocity of the immersed objects is prescribed .",
    "the construction of a numerical scheme for the simulation of slender bodies in viscous fluids is a necessary step for any realistic application , and will be the object of a forthcoming paper . within the present approach , the computational strategy stands to benefit from the understanding that the unsteady movement of the slender bodies is no longer represented by a time - varying domain , but rather by a time - dependent constraint on the function space of admissible velocity fields .",
    "the complexity of the geometry is therefore reduced at the expense of involving higher - order derivatives of the velocity field in the flow equation , and a time - dependent constraint on it .",
    "we nevertheless believe that this approach has the potential to enable more effective computational techniques , especially when dealing with suspensions featuring large numbers of particles .",
    "another important aspect of our approach is that both the dimensional reduction and the hyperviscous regularization , combined with suitable numerical schemes , can be used also in situations where inertia is not negligible . indeed , as giusteri _ _ et al .  _",
    "_ @xcite show , the flow generated by one - dimensional rigid bodies , moving in a fluid governed by a generalization of the navier  stokes equation with hyperviscosity , can be uniquely determined .",
