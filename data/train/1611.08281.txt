    "( b ) kink velocity as the function of time .",
    "the perturbation parameters are @xmath39 and @xmath106.,width=359 ]    finally , we examine if the collective variable model predicts the energy exchange between the kink translational and oscillation modes as was found in frame of the continuum model ( see fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] we plot ( a ) the kink s i m amplitude as a function of time for @xmath130 and ( b ) the kink velocity as a function of time .",
    "the perturbation parameters are @xmath39 and @xmath106 .",
    "very good qualitative agreement can be seen with the results for the continuum model .",
    "the kink velocity decreases when the i m amplitude increases , so that the kink translational and oscillation modes are coupled , as expected and as discussed previously . in fact , the collective coordinate equations ( [ coll_var1a])-([coll_var1aa ] ) in some sense render this coupling explicit via their terms involving both @xmath131 ( and @xmath132 ) and @xmath133 ( and @xmath134 ) .",
    "the interaction of moving @xmath0 kinks with periodic @xmath1-symmetric perturbations was investigated numerically .",
    "it has been shown that the kink s i m can be excited with a time - dependent amplitude .",
    "the kink inverse width varies in time quasiperiodically , with the maximal amplitude depending on the kink velocity .",
    "the maximal i m amplitude sharply increases when the kink velocity is such that it propagates over one period of the gain - loss terrain in about one period of kink s i m oscillation .",
    "this resonant effect is clearly seen for the kinks having sufficiently large velocity , @xmath135 .",
    "the explanation of this resonance effect is as follows .",
    "when the i m is excited , the kink kinetic energy oscillates in time having two maxima within one period of i m in the case of small kink velocity and only one maximum if the velocity is relatively large .",
    "the periodic in space perturbation considered in this work is of the dashpot type with alternating regions of positive and negative damping proportional to @xmath136 .",
    "this means that the effect of the perturbation is maximal when kink s kinetic energy is maximal .",
    "thus , for slowly moving kinks one can expect to observe the resonance effect when the kink velocity is such that it travels two periods of the perturbative function in one i m period . in this case",
    "the period of the perturbative function should be much smaller than the kink width and the effect becomes very weak .",
    "for the kinks with relatively large speed , in order to observe the resonance , the period of the perturbed function should be comparable to or even larger than the kink width , and the resonance takes place when the kink travels one period of this function in one i m cycle .",
    "the results of numerical simulations for the continuum perturbed @xmath0 model have been compared to the results of the collective coordinate method that takes into account not only the kink s translational but also its vibrational degrees of freedom  @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that this theoretical approximation qualitatively predicts all major effects observed for the continuum model . while the collective coordinate method is not quantitatively accurate , it is expected that a variant thereof incorporating relativistic effects is more likely to be .",
    "the latter would be an interesting direction for future study .",
    "we conclude that the periodic @xmath1-symmetric perturbation gives new opportunities in the manipulation of the kink dynamics .",
    "particularly , one can control the kink s i m amplitude by varying the parameters of the perturbation function and the kink velocity . presumably , such features are of broader physical interest and relevance than the specifics of our @xmath0 example . in light of the recent realization of optical solitons in @xmath1-symmetric lattices  @xcite",
    ", it would be interesting to extend relevant notions to nonlinear schrdinger classes of models , especially since recent work has developed non - conservative variational approximations in the latter context  @xcite .",
    "these directions are currently under investigation and will be reported in future publications .",
    "we consider eq .",
    "( [ phi4 ] ) for @xmath137 .",
    "its kink solution ( [ kink ] ) depends on the special variable @xmath138 .",
    "we introduce one more variable as @xmath139 .",
    "then we see that by passing from variables @xmath140 to @xmath141 we have @xmath142 ( i.e. , this is the lorentz invariance ) and this change of variables thus preserves the first two terms in equation ( [ phi4 ] ) with @xmath137 .",
    "then , it can be rewritten as @xmath143 while the kink solution becomes @xmath144 . at the next step",
    "we want to construct an approximate solution to ( [ d3 ] ) in the form @xmath145 where @xmath77 is assumed to be a small real parameter , and @xmath146 , @xmath147 are some functions to be determined . by approximate solution",
    "we mean the following :    \\1 .",
    "the expansion ( [ d5 ] ) is an asymptotic one , i.e. , each next term is smaller by order the previous . in particular , it means that functions @xmath146 , @xmath147 are to be bounded .    \\2 . by substituting the ansatz ( [ d5 ] ) into ( [ d3 ] ) we should get an error of order @xmath148 for small @xmath77 .",
    "the latter condition leads us to the equations for @xmath146 , @xmath147 .",
    "namely , substituting ( [ d5 ] ) into ( [ d3 ] ) and writing then a power series expansion w.r.t .",
    "@xmath77 , we obtain : @xmath149 and therefore , @xmath150 we seek special solutions to the above equations by separation of variables : @xmath151 where @xmath152 is some constant",
    ". then equation ( [ d6 ] ) becomes @xmath153 and since @xmath154 , we finally have @xmath155 equation ( [ d7 ] ) yields @xmath156    equation ( [ d8 ] ) is the eigenvalue equation for the operator @xmath157 its essential spectrum is @xmath158 and the equation @xmath159 has the only bounded solution @xmath160 this solution has two zeroes and it means that operator @xmath161 has two eigenvalues below the essential spectrum . by straightforward calculations one can check that these eigenvalues are @xmath162 and @xmath163 , namely , @xmath164    if we choose @xmath165 as a solution to ( [ d7 ] ) , it leads us to @xmath166 and this is not the solution with the i m .",
    "if we choose @xmath167 , then equation ( [ d8 ] ) has a bounded solution .",
    "however , as one can check , then equation ( [ d9 ] ) has no bounded solution .",
    "this is why we choose @xmath168 and constant @xmath152 is non - zero : @xmath169 .",
    "then for @xmath45 we obtain the equation @xmath170 unfortunately , we can not solve it in elementary functions .",
    "nevertheless , this is an inhomogeneous linear second order ordinary differential equations and its solution can be written by the method of variation of coefficients in terms of the fundamental system of solutions .",
    "thanks to the well - known wkb estimates , these solutions behave at infinity as @xmath171 and it implies that equation ( [ d10 ] ) has a bounded solution .    the final form of ansatz ( [ d5 ] ) expressed in variables @xmath140 is as follows : @xmath172 } \\frac{\\sinh\\delta_k(x - x_0-v_kt)}{\\cosh^2 \\delta_k(x - x_0-v_kt ) }    \\\\   & \\pm a^2e^{2{\\mathrm{i}}\\sqrt{3 } \\delta_k [ t - v_k(x - x_0)]}\\phi_2[\\delta_k(x - x_0-v_kt ) ]   \\\\ & + \\ldots , \\end{aligned}\\label{final}\\ ] ] where @xmath45 is a solution to equation ( [ d10 ] ) .",
