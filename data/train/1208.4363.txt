    "over the past decades quantitative studies of high - redshift galaxy structure have advanced tremendously .",
    "sensitive , high resolution instruments such as the hubble space telescope s ( _ hst _ ) advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) and the wide field camera 3 ( wfc3 ) have made it possible to measure the structure of faint high - redshift galaxies at sub - kpc scales .",
    "furthermore , the availability of easy - to - use photometric redshift and stellar population fitting packages has made it possible to straightforwardly measure a wide variety of parameters for ever - increasing numbers of galaxies .    since a small amount of recent star formation",
    "can have a disproportionately large contribution to a galaxy s light compared to its mass , galaxies are usually observed at the redmost wavelengths , where emission from young stars is weakest . at low redshift , this can be done quite effectively , since rest - frame near - infrared ( nir ) data is available at high enough resolution . at higher redshifts , however , it is impossible to observe at such long wavelengths with sufficiently high angular resolution . until recently , the hubble space telescope ( _ hst _ ) advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) was the only wide - field instrument capable of measuring the structure of high - redshift galaxies in any detail . at @xmath5 ,",
    "the reddest filter available on acs , @xmath6 , corresponds to rest - frame near - ultraviolet ( nuv ) wavelengths .",
    "use of such short - wavelength data has been shown to result in drastically different conclusions about galaxy structure and morphology , compared to rest - frame optical data ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .    with the introduction of the _ hst _ wide field camera 3 ( wfc3 ) it has become possible to measure rest - frame optical light of @xmath7 galaxies at a resolution approaching that of the acs .",
    "the redder light detected by this instrument provides a much better proxy for stellar mass . however , color gradients are known to exist to some extent in all types of galaxies at redshifts up to at least @xmath8 , such that most galaxies contain a relatively red core and blue outer regions ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "these color variations are caused by a combination of varying dust content , metallicity and stellar age , and imply that the stellar mass - to - light ratio ( @xmath9 ) of a given galaxy varies with position within that galaxy . thus , even though rest - frame optical light is a better tracer of stellar mass than rest - frame nuv light , neither accounts for the complexity of stellar population variations within galaxies .    by fitting stellar population models to resolved galaxy photometry , it is in principle possible to infer spatial variations in stellar mass , age , metallicity , dust content , and other parameters .",
    "this approach is currently somewhat limited by the lack of high - resolution data at infrared wavelengths , but can nonetheless be used to measure several basic stellar population properties .",
    "an example of this technique is presented in @xcite , who have performed stellar population modeling on resolved _ hst _ data , using integrated ir observations as constraints on the overall properties of their galaxies . in this approach",
    "the integrated photometry serves as an important tool to constrain the overall spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of a galaxy , while the _ hst _ data provide information regarding the spatial variation of the stellar populations within these constraints .    in this paper",
    "we explore an alternative method to recover @xmath9 variations , using a simple empirical relation between rest - frame @xmath10 color and @xmath9 . using this method",
    "we construct stellar mass surface density profiles corrected for the effects of the psf , for a mass - selected sample of galaxies between @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "we compare the resulting half - mass radii to half - light radii based on rest - frame optical imaging .",
    "all sizes presented in this paper are circularized sizes : @xmath13 . throughout the paper",
    "we assume a @xmath14cdm cosmology with @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 km s@xmath18 mpc@xmath18 .",
    "we make use of deep near - ir imaging of the goods - south field , obtained with _",
    "hst_/wfc3 as part of the cosmic assembly near - infrared deep extragalactic legacy survey ( candels ; @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "when completed , this survey will cover @xmath19 arcmin@xmath20 to 2 orbit depth in @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 ( cosmos , egs and uds fields ) , as well as @xmath24 arcmin@xmath20 to 12 orbit depth ( goods - south and goods - north fields ) .",
    "we use the deepest currently available data , which consist of 9 orbits in @xmath22 and @xmath23 taken over goods - south .",
    "these nir data are combined with deep _",
    "hst_/acs data in the @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath6 filters from the great observatories origins deep survey ( goods acs v2.0 ; @xcite ) .",

    "the wfc3 and acs images have been drizzled to pixel scales of 0.06 and 0.03 arcsec pixel@xmath18 , respectively ( see @xcite for a detailed description of the candels data reduction , and @xcite for details of the acs reduction ) .",
    "we select galaxies using the @xmath30-selected fireworks catalog @xcite .",

    "we select galaxies with stellar masses above @xmath1 , which is the completeness limit in this redshift range @xcite .",
    "this redshift and mass cut results in a sample of 177 galaxies , of which 110 are at @xmath37 and 67 at @xmath38 .",
    "we compare our high - redshift galaxies to low - redshift galaxies observed as part of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; @xcite ) . in order to obtain the deepest possible galaxy photometry we limit our analysis to data from sdss stripe 82 @xcite .",

    "we base our galaxy selection on the nyu value - added galaxy catalog ( @xcite ) ; stellar masses and star formation rates are taken from the mpa - jhu catalogs @xcite .",
    "we select galaxies with spectroscopically measured redshifts in a narrow redshift range @xmath41 and with stellar masses above @xmath1 .",
    "this results in a sample of 220 galaxies .",
    "most studies of galaxy structure at high redshift are based on parametrized two - dimensional surface brightness profile fits ( e.g. , using the galfit package of @xcite ) .",
    "however , such methods do not to account for deviations from the assumed model profile , which is generally an @xmath42 srsic profile .",
    "the technique used in this paper , which is described in more detail in @xcite and @xcite , is different in the sense that these deviations are explicitly included in the measurement process .",
    "the intrinsic profile is derived by first fitting a srsic model profile convolved with the psf to the observed flux , using a psf constructed from unsaturated bright stars in the image .",
    "the residuals from this fit are then measured in radially concentric ellipses which follow the geometry of the best - fit srsic profile . by adding these residuals to the best - fit srsic profile , we effectively perform a first - order correction for deviations from the model profile and are able to account for complex substructures such as rings and faint outer disks .",
    "the resulting profiles closely follow the true intrinsic galaxy profiles , as shown in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the surface brightness profiles of all galaxies in the high - redshift sample are measured in the @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath6 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 filter ; this ensures sufficient wavelength coverage to accurately measure rest - frame @xmath10 colors .",
    "the sdss galaxy profiles are measured in the @xmath36 , @xmath4 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 bands .",
    "errors in the flux profiles are calculated by adding the formal flux errors , sky variance , and the estimated error in the sky background determination .",
    "the radial extent of the profiles is mostly limited by uncertainties in the sky background estimation ; typically , the profiles are accurate out to radii of approximately 10 kpc . at larger radii the profiles are extrapolated using the srsic model profile .",
    "the extrapolated part of the profile typically contains @xmath45 of the total flux , depending on the galaxy profile shape .",
    "rest - frame @xmath36 and @xmath4 band profiles are derived by interpolating between the observed fluxes at each radius , using the sed - based interpolation package interrest @xcite .",
    "this package uses a set of template seds to interpolate between observed fluxes .",
    "the resulting rest - frame fluxes thus take into account the shape of a galaxy s sed and the filter throughputs of both the observed and rest - frame filters .",
    "stellar mass - to - light ratios are estimated using an empirical relation between @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "the @xmath36 and @xmath4 filters straddle the balmer and 4000  breaks ; @xmath10 color is therefore sensitive to changes in stellar age , dust , and metallicity .",
    "our empirical @xmath10  @xmath47 relation is based on fireworks photometry of galaxies in the cdfs , shown in figure  [ fig : mlcolor ] @xcite . in this figure",
    "we plot the integrated rest - frame @xmath10 colors and @xmath48 of galaxies in three redshift bins ( grey circles ) .",
    "rest - frame colors have been calculated using interrest @xcite , and the mass - to - light ratios are obtained from the sed fits described in section  [ sec : data ] .",
    "the black lines indicate the best - fit linear relation at each redshift .",
    "the slope of the relation is 1.0 at @xmath7 , 0.9 at @xmath49 , and 0.7 at @xmath50 .",
    "the uncertainty in @xmath48 , given a value for @xmath10 , is approximately 0.28 at @xmath7 , and 0.13 at lower redshifts .",
    "the reason that these relations exist is due to the fact that stellar population variations ( i.e. , changes in stellar age , metallicity , and dust content ) all produce roughly the same effects in the @xmath10  @xmath47 plane ( @xcite ) .",
    "this is indicated by the arrows in each panel of figure  [ fig : mlcolor ] , which all point roughly in the same direction .",
    "due to this degeneracy we can not distinguish between dust , age , and metallicity effects , but @xmath47 can be determined quite robustly .",
    "it should also be noted that the axes in figure  [ fig : mlcolor ] are not completely independent , since the rest - frame @xmath10 color enters into the stellar population fit from which @xmath47 is determined .",
    "there is significant scatter around the empirical relation used to convert @xmath10 color to @xmath9 .",
    "although age , metallicity , and dust variations produce similar shifts in the color-@xmath51 plane , their effects are not exactly parallel to our empirical relation .",
    "this could lead to a systematic underestimate of the mass - to - light ratios in galaxy regions that are relatively metal - rich or old , and an overestimate in regions that are relatively metal - poor or young .",
    "since the central regions of galaxies generally contain older stars , the inferred @xmath9 gradients would then be too shallow .",
    "this effect is likely small , since the vectors shown in figure  [ fig : mlcolor ] do not diverge very strongly , and the magnitude of the shift is small for moderate stellar population differences .",
    "the process of deriving stellar mass surface density profiles is illustrated for four galaxies in figure  [ fig : example ] .",
    "the galaxies are selected to show a range of color gradients . for each galaxy",
    "we show , from top to bottom , a rest - frame @xmath52 color image , the observed - frame and rest - frame surface brightness profiles , the rest - frame @xmath10 color profile , and the resulting stellar mass surface density profile .",
    "the extent of the psf half width at half - maximum ( hwhm ) is indicated by grey hatched areas .",
    "the observed - frame residual - corrected surface brightness profiles , shown in grey - scale in the second row , are generally of high quality .",
    "the profiles deteriorate somewhat in the bluer bands for the highest - redshift galaxies . however , the profiles that are used for interpolating to rest - frame @xmath36 and @xmath4 wavelengths ( i.e. , measured in the bands directly red- and blueward of the rest - frame @xmath36 and @xmath4 wavelengths ) have high signal - to - noise . the observed surface brightness profiles , and by extension the rest - frame @xmath10 profiles , are generally accurate out to @xmath53 kpc .    in the third row of figure",
    "[ fig : example ] we plot the observed @xmath10 color profiles as well as the average @xmath10 colors for the entire galaxy ( in red and blue , respectively ) .",
    "the color gradients range from very steep ( @xmath54 ) to very shallow . at large radii",
    "( @xmath55 kpc ) the color profiles become extremely uncertain . due to the low surface brightness at these radii",
    ", the ratio of @xmath36 band to @xmath4 band flux is very sensitive to small errors in either flux profile .",
    "this can result in colors that become unrealistically blue or red .",
    "we therefore limit the color profiles to radii where the error in @xmath10 is smaller than 0.2 dex ; the @xmath10 color at larger radii is fixed to the value at the threshold radius .",
    "this should not have a strong effect on the resulting stellar mass surface density profile , since the surface densities at these large radii are so low that they contribute very little to the total mass , even for high @xmath47 .",
    "the resulting mass profiles are shown in the fourth row , with the same color coding ( blue assuming a constant @xmath9 , red for radially varying @xmath9 ) .",
    "effective radii obtained by integrating the surface density profiles are shown for both profiles , with the hatched areas indicating the @xmath56 errors .",
    "the difference between assuming a radially constant mass - to - light ratio and actually accounting for @xmath9 variations is clear .",
    "radial @xmath9 variations can lead to half - mass radii that are more than a factor 5 smaller than rest - frame @xmath4 band half - light radii , with errors ranging from more than a factor 2 ( first column ) to smaller than 10% ( second through fourth columns ) .",
    "these size differences will be discussed in more detail in the next section .",
    "the surface density profiles of all galaxies in our sample are shown in figure  [ fig : profiles ] , and are also given in table  [ tab : profiles ] .",
    "parameters derived from these profiles are given in table  [ tab : pars ] .",

    "similarly , the values for starforming galaxies are consistent with no evolution with redshift . for quiescent galaxies , there is a hint of decreasing values of @xmath231 at higher redshifts , although the large scatter at @xmath7 means that these results are also consistent with zero redshift evolution .",
    "the lack of evolution with redshift agrees with the color gradients presented in @xcite .",
    "this study showed that the radial color gradients in galaxies with @xmath232 are nearly constant between @xmath233 .",
    "this seems counterintuitive , since one would expect bulge growth in galaxies to result in steeper color gradients at lower redshift .",
    "however , it should be stressed that the comparison in figure  [ fig : sizediff ] is between galaxies of the same mass .",
    "it is therefore not a comparison between high - redshift galaxies and their descendants , but rather a comparison between high - redshift galaxies and their low - redshift analogs .",
    "thus , @xmath7 galaxies have similar color gradients as low redshift galaxies of the same mass .",
    "this holds for starforming and quiescent galaxies",
    "seperately , and for the entire population as a whole .",
    "the transition of galaxies from the starforming to the passive population is coupled to changes in almost all aspects of their structure and morphology ( e.g. , @xcite;@xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the growth of a bulge , in particular , implies that color gradients should steepen as galaxies are quenched .",
    "we therefore expect some degree of correlation between @xmath225 and the galaxy parameters that correlate with star forming activity , such as ssfr , size , srsic index , and effective surface density .",
    "we investigate these correlations in figure  [ fig : corr ] .",
    "individual galaxies are indicated by small light - colored circles , and the running medians in each panel are indicated by darker lines .    somewhat surprisingly , the median value of @xmath225 is close to constant as a function of galaxy parameters in all redshift bins .",
    "there is some evidence for a trend between @xmath225 and galaxy morphology , such that @xmath225 is smaller for galaxies with low ssfr , small sizes and high srsic indices .",
    "however , this trend is very weak .",
    "overall , the correlation coefficients at @xmath49 and @xmath7 are very low and not significant ( @xmath234 , @xmath235 ) .",
    "the exceptions to this are the correlations between @xmath231 and @xmath236 and @xmath237 , at @xmath7 ; although these are also quite low , they are significant ( @xmath238 , @xmath239 )",
    ". similarly , the correlation coefficients at @xmath11 are low , but significant ( @xmath240 , @xmath239 ) . we conclude that the difference between half - mass size and half - light size correlates very weakly with galaxy structure and star forming activity .",
    "although the average difference between half - mass and half - light radius is remarkably constant , for some galaxies the difference is up to a factor eight .",
    "these large differences warrant closer inspection . in figure",
    "[ fig : extreme ] we show images and profiles of a number of galaxies with @xmath241 .",
    "four representative galaxies have been selected from each redshift bin , and are plotted in order of decreasing ssfr .",
    "the flux profile errors of the galaxies shown are typical for the galaxies in this sample .",
    "nearly all of these galaxies are dominated by large central bulges , but also contain extended , blue disks .",
    "these large galaxies have very well - measured surface brightness profiles ; errors are low , and the profiles are measured accurately out to very large radii .",
    "we are therefore confident that the color gradients , although very steep , are real .",
    "this group of galaxies demonstrates the importance of obtaining resolved stellar mass information .",
    "measurements made at rest - frame optical wavelengths severely underestimate the relative importance of the central bulge component in these galaxies , due to the high luminosity of the blue disks surrounding them . as a result , for a sizeable fraction ( @xmath242 ) of massive galaxies",
    "the structure as measured at rest - frame optical wavelengths severely misrepresents the mass distribution in these galaxies .",
    "this population of large , bulge - dominated disk galaxies is very interesting .",
    "they have stellar masses up to @xmath243 and are distributed across the entire range of measured ssfrs . moving from high to low ssfr , we can see a progression from sa or sb - like systems to objects that look more like s0s and elliptical galaxies .",
    "this is most evident at low redshift , where galaxies have large angular sizes . the color difference between the central bulge and extended disk gradually decreases from high- to low - ssfr galaxies .",
    "in other words , it seems that we are observing these galaxies during the phase where a central bulge has recently formed and star formation is turning off .",
    "it is unclear why other galaxies with similar ssfrs do not contain such large bulges ; this may depend on the dark matter halos in which they are located , or may perhaps be due to different quenching processes .",
    "we have presented the first consistently measured stellar mass surface density profiles for individual galaxies at redshifts between @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "these profiles have been derived using an empirical relation between rest - frame color and stellar mass - to - light ratio .",
    "this simple method does not yield the same detailed information regarding , e.g. , stellar ages and dust content as resolved sed - fitting techniques .",
    "however , it is robust to variations in stellar population properties ; changes in stellar age , metallicity , or dust content shift galaxies roughly along the empirical relation , and are thus implicitly included in our @xmath9 determination .",
    "the key advantage of this study compared to previous work at high redshift ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) is the fact that the profiles presented here are deconvolved for psf smoothing .",
    "this is crucial for measurements of high - redshift galaxy structure , since these distant and often physically small galaxies have angular sizes that are in many cases comparable to the _ hst _ psf size ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "since our surface density profiles are derived from deconvolved surface brightness profiles , they can be used to correctly measure structural parameters such as sizes and srsic indices .",
    "the considerable depth of the data used in this study allows us to probe galaxy fluxes and colors out to large radii .",
    "the robustness of the resulting structural parameters has been tested using ultradeep data taken over the hudf , which overlaps with the candels goods - south field .",
    "a comparison of galaxy parameters derived using the two datasets confirms that our results are not systematically affected by surface brightness effects .",
    "we have shown that the half - mass radii of galaxies between @xmath11 and @xmath12 are on average 25% smaller than their rest - frame optical half - light radii .",
    "there is significant scatter in this size difference , with some galaxies having half - mass radii that are almost an order of magnitude smaller than their half - light radii .",
    "we find that , on average , this size difference does not vary with redshift for galaxies at fixed mass .",
    "this holds for the population as a whole , as well as for the quiescent and starforming subpopulations seperately .",
    "this is an interesting result , as it implies that @xmath7 galaxies have similar color gradients as their low - redshift analogs , despite the fact that these low - redshift galaxies formed at a different epoch , and perhaps through very different formation mechanisms .",
    "there does not seem to be a strong correlation between galaxy morphology or star forming activity and the difference between half - mass size and half - light size .",
    "however , we do find that the galaxies with the most extreme size differences are almost all extended disk galaxies with very prominent central bulges .",
    "these galaxies range from strongly starforming to almost completely quiescent , and may represent a short transitional phase during which the central bulge is prominent and the starforming disk is very young .",
    "there is significant scatter around the empirical relation used to convert @xmath10 color to @xmath9 , which could lead to a systematic underestimate of the mass - to - light ratios in galaxy regions that are relatively metal - rich or old .",
    "however , this effect is likely small for moderate stellar population variations .",
    "similarly , very high central dust concentrations may result in an underestimate of the inner mass content of galaxies , biasing our results towards larger half - mass radii .",
    "the high - resolution infrared data needed in order to quantify such dust effects will be available in the ( near ) future , with instruments such as alma .",
    "inside - out galaxy growth , as described by , e.g. , @xcite , implies that the growth of the most massive galaxies since @xmath7 is largely due to material being accreted onto the outer regions of these galaxies .",
    "the cores of massive galaxies likely formed in short , violent bursts at higher redshift , and should therefore have star formation histories and stellar populations that are quite different from those in the outer regions .",
    "the results presented in this paper broadly agree with such a picture ; the central regions of massive galaxies are redder , and therefore likely older , than the outer regions .",
    "using the method presented in this paper we can not , however , disentangle dust , age and metallicity gradients ; nor can we constrain the star formation histories within our galaxies . first steps towards a better understanding of stellar population variations within high - redshift galaxies have been made by several authors .",
    "results based on photometry of early - type galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) indicate that stellar age and metallicity are the dominant drivers of radial color gradients .",
    "studies based on spectroscopic measurements of gravitationally lensed high - redshift galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) have shown that most of these galaxies have negative metallicity gradients .",
    "these results seem to be roughly consistent with each other , but are based on very differently selected , and rather small , galaxy samples .",
    "a broader , more in - depth analysis of radial stellar population variations , for a well - defined sample of starforming galaxies as well as quiescent galaxies , could provide valuable insights into the processes which have shaped the structure of galaxies today .",
