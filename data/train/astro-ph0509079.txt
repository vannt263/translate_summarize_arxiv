    "it is a remarkable fact that our observational knowledge of the universe can be justified in terms of a model , the so - called power - law @xmath9 model , characterized by just six parameters , describing the matter content of our universe ( the physical density of baryons @xmath10 , the physical density of matter @xmath11 , the hubble constant @xmath12 ) , the initial conditions from which it evolved ( the amplitude @xmath13 and the spectral index @xmath14 of the primordial power spectrum ) and the optical depth at reionization @xmath15 . in particular , this model provides a good fit to both the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) @xcite and large scale structure ( lss ) data ( although in this last case one additional parameter , the bias parameter @xmath16 , is needed ) @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the data leave room for more refined models , described by additional parameters : among them , the spatial curvature , the amplitude of tensor fluctuations , a running spectral index for scalar modes , the equation of state for dark energy , the neutrino fraction in the dark matter component , a non - standard value for the relativistic energy density . all",
    "have been considered in previous works .",
    "in particular the last two have been studied in order to gain deeper information on the properties of neutrinos @xcite . before the measurements of the cmb anisotropy spectrum carried out by the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) @xcite , the combined cmb and lss data yielded the following upper bound on the sum of neutrino masses : @xmath17  ev @xcite .",
    "the wmap precision data allowed to strengthen this limit . using rather simplifying assumptions , i.e. , assuming three thermalized neutrino families all with the same mass and a null chemical potential ( thus implying perfect lepton symmetry ) , the wmap team found that the neutrino mass should be lower than 0.23 ev @xcite .",
    "this tight limit has been somewhat relaxed to @xmath18  ev @xcite owing to a more careful treatment of the ly-@xmath19 data , and its dependence on the priors has been examined @xcite .",
    "the lss data can also be used to put similar constraints , although they are usually weaker . using the data from the 2 degree field galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ) and assuming `` concordance '' values for the matter density @xmath20 and the hubble constant @xmath12 it is found that @xmath21  ev @xcite . a combined analysis of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) and wmap data gives a similar bound : @xmath22  ev @xcite .",
    "quite interestingly , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite claim that , from a conservative point of view ( i.e. , making as few assumptions as possible ) , the wmap data alone do nt give any information about the neutrino mass and are indeed consistent with neutrinos making up the 100% of dark matter . in ref .",
    "@xcite it is claimed that the cosmological data favor a non - zero neutrino mass at the 68% confidence limit , while the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite find the limit @xmath23 .    at the same time",
    ", more detailed scenarios with a different structure of the neutrino sector have been studied .",
    "the first and more natural extension to the standard scenario is the one in which a certain degree of lepton asymmetry ( parameterized by the so - called _ degeneracy parameter _ @xmath1 , i.e. , the dimensionless chemical potential ) is introduced @xcite .",
    "although standard models of baryogenesis ( for example those based on @xmath24 grand unification models ) predict the lepton charge asymmetry to be of the same order of the baryonic asymmetry @xmath25 , nevertheless there are many particle physics motivated scenario in which a lepton asymmetry much larger than the baryionic one is generated @xcite . in some cases",
    ", the predicted lepton asymmetry can be of order unity .",
    "one of the interesting cosmological implications of a net leptonic asymmetry is the possibility to generate small observed baryonic asymmetry of the universe @xcite via the so - called sphaleron process @xcite .",
    "the process of big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) is very sensitive to a lepton asymmetry in the electronic sector , since an excess ( deficit ) of electron neutrinos with respect to their antiparticles , alters the equilibrium of beta reactions and leads to a lower ( higher ) cosmological neutron to proton ratio @xmath26 .",
    "on the other hand , an asymmetry in the @xmath27 or @xmath28 sector , even if not influencing directly the beta reactions , can increase the equilibrium @xmath26 ratio due to a faster cosmological expansion .",
    "this can be used to constrain the value of the degeneracy parameter @xcite .",
    "this leads to the bounds @xmath29 and @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "the effect of a relic neutrino asymmetry on the cmb anisotropy and matter power spectrum was first studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , and is mainly related to the fact that a lepton asymmetry implies an energy density in relativistic particles larger than in the standard case .",
    "the cosmological observables can then be used to constrain this extra energy density , parameterized by the effective number of relativistic neutrino species @xmath31 .",
    "although this is somewhat more general than the case of a lepton asymmetry , in the sense that the extra energy density can arise due to other effects as well , nevertheless the case of a non - null chemical potential is not strictly covered by the introduction of @xmath31 .",
    "this is because the increased relativistic energy density is not the only effect connected to the lepton asymmetry ( an additional side effect is for example a change in the jeans mass of neutrinos @xcite ) . in the hypothesis of a negligible neutrino mass , it has been shown that the wmap data constrain @xmath31 to be smaller than 9 ; when other cmb and lss data are taken into account , the bound shrinks to @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "a combined analysis of cmb and bbn data leads to even tighter bounds @xcite .",
    "a more detailed analysis , in which the effective number of relativistic relics and the neutrino mass are both left arbitrary and varied independently , can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the same paper , the effect of different mass splittings",
    "is also studied .",
    "finally an extension of these arguments to the case in which additional relativistic , low - mass relics ( such as a fourth , sterile neutrino or a qcd axion ) are present , has been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the goal of this paper is to perform an analysis of the wmap data using the degeneracy parameter , together with the effective number of relativistic particles , as additional free parameters , in order to put constraints on the lepton number of the universe .",
    "we work in the framework of an extended cosmological model with three thermally distributed neutrino families having all the same mass and chemical potential , plus a certain amount of exotic particles species , considered to be effectively massless .",
    "we use the physical neutrino density @xmath33 , the degeneracy parameter @xmath1 and the extra energy density in exotic particles @xmath2 as additional parameters that describe the neutrino sector .",
    "we perform an analysis in a 8-dimensional parameter space that includes the standard , `` core '' cosmological parameters .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . after a discussion on the motivations that drive our work in sec .",
    "[ sec : motivation ] , we shortly review some basic formulae in sec .",
    "[ sec : basic formulae ] and discuss the impact of a non - null degeneracy parameter on the cmb spectrum in sec .",
    "[ sec : effect ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec : method ] we describe the analysis pipeline , while in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] we present our basic results . finally , we draw our conclusions in sec . [",
    "sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the main motivation for this work comes from the fact that , even though several analyses have been performed which were aimed at putting constraints on the number of effective relativistic degrees of freedom , a statistical analysis of the cmb data aiming to put bounds directly on the degeneracy parameter , instead of on @xmath31 , is nevertheless still missing .",
    "there are two reasons for this : first of all , in the limit of a vanishing neutrino mass , the increase in @xmath31 is in effect all that is needed to implement the non null chemical potential into the standard model of the evolution of perturbations @xcite .",
    "it is then argued that , since neutrinos with mass smaller than roughly @xmath34  ev , being still relativistic at the time of last scattering , would behave as massless , the distinction between @xmath1 and @xmath31 is no more relevant in this case for what concerns their effect on the cmb anisotropy spectrum .",
    "although this is certainly true , it is our opinion that this does not allow to neglect _ a priori _ the difference between the two parameters .",
    "one reason is that the most conservative bound on neutrino mass , coming from the tritium beta decay experiments , reads @xmath35  ev ( at the @xmath5 level ) @xcite , that is quite higher than the value of 0.3  ev quoted above .",
    "the main evidences for a neutrino mass in the sub - ev range come , in the field of particle physics , from the experiments on neutrinoless double beta decay @xcite , whose interpretation depends on assumptions about the majorana nature of neutrinos and on the details of the mixing matrix .",
    "other indications of a sub - ev mass come , as stated above , from cosmology and in particular from the power spectrum of anisotropies , but since we want to keep our results as much as possible independent from other analyses , we should not use information on neutrino mass derived from the previous analyses of the cmb data .",
    "moreover , let us note that cmb data analyses are often refined using the results from lss experiments .",
    "since the structure formation , starting close to the epoch of matter - radiation equality , goes on until very late times , even very light neutrinos ( in the range @xmath36  ev ) can not be considered massless for the purpose of evaluating their effect on the matter power spectrum .",
    "this means in particular that using @xmath31 would lead to overlook the change in the free streaming length and in the jeans mass of neutrinos due to the increased velocity dispersion @xcite .",
    "it is then our opinion that the use of @xmath31 , even if correct with respect to the interpretation of cmb data , precludes the possibility of correctly implementing the lss data as a subsequent step in the analysis pipeline .    the second point against the cosmological significance of the degeneracy parameter",
    "is related to the constrain from bbn .",
    "it was recently shown that , if the large mixing angle ( lma ) solution to the solar neutrino problem is correct ( as the results of the kamland experiment suggest @xcite ) , then the flavor neutrino oscillations equalize the chemical potentials of @xmath37 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 neutrinos prior to the onset of bbn , so that a stringent limit @xmath38 actually applies to all flavours @xcite .",
    "this would constrain the lepton asymmetry of the universe to such small values that it could be safely ignored in cosmological analyses . however",
    ", the presence of another relativistic particle or scalar field would make these limits relax @xcite , while the effect of the mixing with a light sterile neutrino , whose existence is required in order to account for the results of the liquid scintillation neutrino detector ( lsnd ) experiment @xcite , is still unclear @xcite .",
    "moreover , it has been recently shown that a hypothetical neutrino - majoron coupling can suppress neutrino flavor oscillations , thus reopening a window for a large lepton asymmetry @xcite .",
    "for all these reasons , we judge it is interesting to study if cmb data alone can constraint or maybe even rule out such exotic scenarios .",
    "it is customary in cosmology to call ultrarelativistic ( or simply relativistic ) a species @xmath39 that decouples from the photon bath at a temperature @xmath40 such that its thermal energy is much larger than its rest mass energy : @xmath41 .",
    "owing to liouville s theorem , the distribution function in momentum space @xmath42 of the species @xmath39 is given , after decoupling , by ( we shall use all throughout the paper units in which @xmath43 ) : @xmath44^{-1},\\ ] ] where @xmath45 is the dimensionless chemical potential , often called degeneracy parameter , the sign @xmath46 corresponds to the case in which the @xmath39 s are fermions ( bosons ) , @xmath47 is the number of quantum degrees of freedom , and the temperature @xmath48 evolves in time as the inverse of the cosmological scale factor @xmath49 , so that @xmath50    the energy density of the @xmath39 s at a given temperature is readily calculated : @xmath51 = \\frac{g_x}{2\\pi^2}\\int_0^\\infty \\,p^2 \\sqrt{p^2+m_x^2}\\,f(p\\,;\\,t_x,\\xi_x)dp .",
    "\\label{eq : rhox}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] using the dimensionless quantities @xmath52 and @xmath53 , the expression for the energy density can be put in the form : @xmath54 we stress the fact that a temperature dependence is still present in the integral through the term @xmath55 .",
    "however , the temperature dependence disappear from the integral in two notable limits , the ultrarelativistic ( ur ) and non - relativistic ( nr ) one , corresponding respectively to the two opposite cases @xmath56 and @xmath57 @xcite . then , defining @xmath58 so that @xmath59 , we have @xmath60 \\left ( \\begin{array}{c } 1 \\\\ 3/4 \\end{array } \\right ) g_x \\displaystyle \\frac{\\zeta(3)}{\\pi^2 } m_x j_2^\\pm(\\xi_x ) t_x^3   \\qquad \\mathrm{nr } \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] where the upper and lower values in parentheses in front of the expression in the right - hand side hold for bosons and fermions respectively , and @xmath61 is the riemann zeta function of order @xmath14 .",
    "it is useful to express @xmath62 in terms of the present day energy density of the cosmic background photons : @xmath63 \\rho_\\gamma^0 ( 1+z)^4 \\equiv\\\\[0.2 cm ] \\equiv g_x^\\mathrm{eff}\\rho_\\gamma^0 \\left(1+z\\right)^4 , \\label{eq : rhox_ur}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] having defined an effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom @xmath64 as @xmath65 .",
    "\\label{eq : geff_def}\\ ] ] it is often the case that one has to consider a fermion species @xmath39 together with its antiparticle @xmath66 , the most notable example being the relic neutrinos and antineutrinos . in chemical equilibrium ,",
    "the relation @xmath67 holds owing to the conservation of chemical potential , as can be seen considering the reaction : @xmath68 and noting that the chemical potential in the final state vanishes @xcite .",
    "this relation holds for neutrinos and antineutrinos in several cosmological scenarios .",
    "there are some exceptions to this , most notably early universe scenarios in which lepton asymmetry is generated @xcite or destroyed @xcite by active - sterile neutrino oscillations at low temperatures .",
    "however , we shall assume all throughout the paper that the relation @xmath69 holds .",
    "it can then be shown that @xmath70 = \\frac{7}{8}g_x \\left[1 + \\frac{30}{7 } \\left ( \\frac{\\xi_x}{\\pi } \\right)^2 + \\frac{15}{7 } \\left ( \\frac{\\xi_x}{\\pi } \\right)^4 \\right ] \\left ( \\frac{t^0_x}{t^0_\\gamma } \\right)^4 , \\label{eq : geff x+xbar}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where the factor between square parentheses can be recognized as what it is often quoted as the contribution of a non - vanishing chemical potential to the effective number of relativistic species @xmath31 .",
    "the definitions introduced above can be easily extended to the case when several ultra - relativistic species @xmath71 are present : @xmath72 where photons are excluded from the summation .",
    "this means that , since @xmath73 , the actual number of relativistic degrees of freedom is @xmath74 .",
    "the total density of ultrarelativistic particles at a given time is thus : @xmath75    finally we can use this expression to find the dependence on @xmath76 of the redshift of radiation - matter equality @xmath77 ( the subscripts @xmath16 and @xmath78 stands for baryons and cold dark matter respectively ) :    @xmath79    so , the larger is the energy density of ultra - relativistic particles in the universe , parameterized by the effective number of degrees of freedom @xmath76 , the smaller @xmath77 will be , i.e. , the later the equality between radiation and matter will occur .",
    "in other words , supposing that the density in non - relativistic particles ( baryons + cdm ) is well known and fixed , having more relativistic degrees of freedom will shift @xmath77 closer to us and to the cmb decoupling .    in the standard cosmological scenario ,",
    "the only contribution to the energy density of relativistic particles other than photons is the one due to the three families of standard neutrinos , with zero chemical potential .",
    "the ratio of the neutrino temperature to the photon temperature is @xmath80 , due to the entropy transfer that followed the electron - positron annihilation , shortly after neutrino decoupling . then    @xmath81    where @xmath82 is the number of neutrino families .",
    "the energy density in a single neutrino species is :    @xmath83    however , several mechanisms that could increase ( or even decrease ) the energy density of relativistic particles have been proposed . in the presence of some extra relics ( such as sterile neutrinos , majorons , axions , etc . )",
    "the energy density of radiation would obviously increase .",
    "a non - zero chemical potential for neutrinos or an unaccounted change of @xmath84 , due for example to particle decays that increase the photon temperature , would produce the same result . in all cases",
    "the effect is the same : a change in @xmath76 , as it can be seen by looking at eq .",
    "( [ eq : geff_def ] ) .",
    "it is usual in the literature to parameterize the extra energy density by introducing an effective number of neutrino families @xmath31 , defined as :    @xmath85    where again the sum runs over all ultrarelativistic species with the exceptions of photons .",
    "it is clear from this definition that @xmath31 is actually the energy density in ultrarelativistic species ( apart from photons ) normalized to the energy density of a single neutrino species with zero chemical potential and standard thermal history .",
    "it is easy to show that a relation formally similar to ( [ eq : geff vs n ] ) holds in the non - standard scenario :    @xmath86    in addition , it should be noted that even in the standard scenario @xmath87 , but instead @xmath88 .",
    "this is due to the fact that neutrino decoupling is not instantaneous , so that neutrino actually share some of the entropy transfer of the @xmath89 annihilation , on one side , and to finite temperature quantum electrodynamics corrections on the other @xcite .",
    "it is also useful to introduce the effective number of additional relativistic species @xmath90 defined as : @xmath91 so that @xmath92 in the standard scenario . please note that @xmath93 can also be negative , for example in very low reheating scenarios @xcite .",
    "in this paper we shall consider a scenario in which the radiation content of the universe at the time of radiation - matter equality is shared among photons , three neutrino families with standard temperature but possibly non - zero chemical potential , and some other relic particle .",
    "we shall suppose that the presence of the latter can be completely taken into account through its effect on @xmath31 .",
    "this is true if the species has been in its ultrarelativistic regime for the most part of the history of the universe .",
    "the presence of this extra relic is required for our analysis , in order to circumvent the equalization of neutrino chemical potentials , as explained at the end of section [ sec : motivation ] .",
    "we also assume that the degeneracy parameters for neutrinos and antineutrinos are equal and opposite , and that @xmath37 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 neutrinos all have the same chemical potential .",
    "the extra energy density can thus be split into two distinct contributions , the first due to the non - zero degeneracy parameter of neutrinos and the second due to the extra relic(s ) : @xmath94 following our assumptions , @xmath95 can be expressed as a function of the chemical potential only : @xmath96 .",
    "\\label{eq : dnnu}\\ ] ]",
    "as anticipated above , the main effect connected to the presence of a non - vanishing degeneracy parameter , is an increase in @xmath76 ( or , equivalently , in @xmath31 ) .",
    "the presence of this extra number of effective relativistic degrees of freedom can in principle be detected from observations of the cmb radiation .",
    "the shift of matter - radiation equality has important consequences for the cmb anisotropy spectrum , these being due to the larger amplitude of the oscillations that enter the horizon during the radiation dominated phase , and to a larger early integrated sachs - wolfe ( isw ) effect .",
    "however these effects , basically due to the speeding up of the cosmological expansion , can be similarly produced by the variation of other cosmological parameters , for example by a smaller cdm density .",
    "moreover since the change in the redshift of matter - radiation equality depends on the ultra - relativistic species only through the quantity @xmath76 , it can not be used to distinguish between the different species ( i.e. , it is `` flavor blind '' ) , nor to understand if the excess energy density is due to the presence of some unconventional relic , to an extra entropy transfer to photons , or to a non - null chemical potential ( i.e. , to a lepton asymmetry ) , or maybe to all of the previous .",
    "however ultrarelativistic particles , other than changing the background evolution , have an effect even on the evolution of perturbations , as it was pointed out in @xcite with particular regard to the case of neutrinos .",
    "first of all , the high velocity dispersion of ultrarelativistic particles damps all perturbations under the horizon scale .",
    "second , the anisotropic part of the neutrino stress - energy tensor couples with the tensor part of the metric perturbations . it was shown in @xcite that this reduces the amplitude squared of tensor modes by roughly 30% at small scales . finally , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite claimed that the perturbations of relativistic neutrinos produce a distinctive phase shift of the cmb acoustic oscillations .",
    "these effects can thus be used to break the degeneracy between @xmath76 and other parameters .",
    "it remains to establish whether they can be used to break the degeneracy between the different contributions to @xmath76 or not . even without performing a detailed analysis ,",
    "it can be seen by looking at the relevant equations in ref .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , that both the absorption of tensor modes and the phase shift depend on the quantity @xmath97 .",
    "the effect of free streaming , even if more difficult to express analytically , is also mainly dependent on the value of @xmath98 @xcite . if we consider the case where the three standard neutrinos are the only contribution to the radiation energy density other than photons , but we allow for the possibility of a non - vanishing chemical potential or for a different @xmath99 ratio , we see again that the changes in the shape of the cmb anisotropy spectrum depend only on @xmath76 as whole , as long as eq .",
    "( [ eq : rhox_ur ] ) retains its validity , i.e. , as long as neutrinos are in their ultra - relativistic regime . even considering",
    "the presence of some additional relic particle @xmath39 does not seem to change this picture .",
    "supposing that the other ultrarelativistic particles behave as neutrinos for what concerns the effects under consideration , we can argue that in all cases the relevant quantity is @xmath100 , so that we are again lead to the conclusions that @xmath76 is the only relevant parameter .",
    "this means , for example , that in the case of neutrinos with mass less than @xmath101  ev , so that they stay ultrarelativistic until the time of last scattering and for some time after , the effect on cmb perturbations is exactly the same of massless neutrinos , and every change in their temperature or chemical potential , as even the presence of an additional , sterile neutrino , is absorbed in @xmath76 ( moreover , we do nt have obviously any possibility to extract information about their mass ) .",
    "however the picture changes when considering neutrinos ( or other relic particles ) that go out from the ultrarelativistic regime before matter - radiation decoupling .",
    "if the neutrino mass is larger than @xmath101  ev , the effect of its finite mass is felt by the perturbations that enter the horizon after neutrinos have gone out from the ultrarelativistic regime , because from some point on the evolution the energy density will be given no more by the approximate formula ( [ eq : rhox_ur ] ) , but instead by eq .",
    "( [ eq : rhox ] ) that contains a dependence on mass through the term @xmath55 . a side effect of this is that it will not be possible to single out the dependence of @xmath102 from @xmath48 and @xmath1 as an overall factor , so that these two contributions become distinguishable .",
    "let us make this more clear with an example . consider a gravitational wave entering the horizon after neutrinos became non - relativistic , but before matter - radiation decoupling .",
    "this wave will be absorbed , according to @xcite , proportionally to @xmath103 .",
    "on the other hand the free streaming length of neutrinos will vary according to the velocity dispersion @xmath104 @xcite .",
    "the key point is that , for a gas of non - relativistic particles , @xmath103 and @xmath104 will depend on @xmath105 and @xmath106 in different ways , so that measuring independently the absorption factor and the free streaming length , it would be possible at least in principle to obtain the values of @xmath105 and @xmath106 without any ambiguity left .",
    "what we have just said is even more true with respect to the lss data , since even neutrinos with mass greater than @xmath107  ev are in their non - relativistic regime during the late stages of the process of structure formation .",
    "we conclude then by stressing that one should be careful when parameterizing the lepton asymmetry by means of an effective number of degrees of freedom .",
    "we used the ` cmbfast ` code @xcite , modified as described in ref .",
    "@xcite in order to account for a non vanishing chemical potential of neutrinos , to compute the temperature ( tt ) and polarization ( te ) cmb spectra for different combinations of the cosmological parameters . as a first step , we added three more parameters , namely the effective number of additional relativistic species @xmath2 , the neutrino degeneracy parameter @xmath1 ( both defined in sec .",
    "[ sec : basic formulae ] ) and the neutrino physical energy density @xmath33 to the standard six - parameters @xmath9 model that accounts in a remarkably good way for the wmap data . as anticipated above , @xmath2 accounts only for the extra energy density due to the presence of additional relic relativistic particles other than the three standard model neutrinos .",
    "we shall refer to the @xmath108 subspace as the `` neutrino sector '' of the parameter space ( although , as we have just noticed , @xmath2 does not refer directly to neutrinos ) .    with the above mentioned choice of the parameters we can make a consistency check to our results , by verifying that imposing the priors @xmath109 , @xmath110 and @xmath111",
    ", we obtain results that are in agreement with the ones of the wmap collaboration . moreover , by choosing a sufficiently wide range for the variation of the three additional parameters",
    ", we can check how much their introduction affects the estimation of the best - fit values of the core parameters .",
    "thus we choose to use the following parameters : the physical baryon density @xmath112 , the total density of non relativistic matter @xmath113 , the scalar spectral index @xmath14 , the optical depth to reionization @xmath28 , the overall normalization of the cmb spectrum @xmath13 , the physical neutrino density @xmath114 , the neutrino degeneracy parameter @xmath1 and the extra energy density in non - standard relics @xmath2 .",
    "we will be considering the scenario in which the three standard model neutrinos have all the same mass and chemical potential .",
    "we take the chemical potential to be positive ( this corresponds to an excess of neutrinos over antineutrinos ) , but since the effects on the cmb do not depend on the sign of @xmath1 , we quote the limits that we obtain in terms of its absolute value",
    ". we do not include as a free parameter the hubble constant @xmath115 , whose degeneracy with the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom and with the neutrino mass has been studied in previous works @xcite .",
    "instead we decided , according to the recent measurements of hubble space telescope ( hst ) key project @xcite , to assume that @xmath116 .",
    "moreover , we restrict ourselves to the case of a flat universe , so that the density parameter of the cosmological constant @xmath117 is equal to @xmath118 .",
    "we are thus dealing with a 8-dimensional parameter space .",
    "let us discuss in a bit more detail the way we deal with priors in the neutrino sector of parameter space , i.e. , with information coming from other observations , and in particular from bbn . as we have stressed in section [ sec : motivation ] , the standard bbn scenario , together with the equalization of chemical potentials , constraints the neutrino degeneracy parameter to values lower than the ones considered in this paper ; on the other hand this conclusion possibly does not hold in non - standard scenarios where additional relativistic relics are present . however , even non - standard scenarios of this kind usually single out some preferred region in parameter space . at the present ,",
    "several non - standard scenarios that can account for the observed helium abundance exist ( see for example refs . @xcite and @xcite ) so that we adopt a conservative approach , and choose not to impose any prior on the neutrino sector , other than the ones that emerge `` naturally '' as a consequence of our choice of parameters . anyway",
    ", this does not preclude the possibility of successively using the bbn information : in fact once the likelihood function in the neutrino sector has been calculated , it can be convolved with the relevant priors coming from non - standard bbn scenarios .",
    "we span the following region in parameter space : @xmath119 , @xmath120 , @xmath121 , @xmath122 , @xmath123 , @xmath124 , @xmath125 , @xmath126 .",
    "we shall call this our `` ( 5 + 3 ) parameter space '' . in order to obtain the likelihood function @xmath127 in this region , we sample it over a grid consisting of 5 equally spaced points in each dimension . for each point on our grid ,",
    "corresponding to a combination of the parameters , we compute the likelihood relative to the tt @xcite and te @xcite angular power spectrum observed by wmap , using the software developed by the wmap collaboration @xcite and kindly made publicly available at their website . to obtain the likelihood function for a single parameter",
    ", we should marginalize over the remaining ones .",
    "however for simplicity we approximate the multi - dimensional integration required for the marginalization procedure with a maximization of the likelihood , as it is a common usage in this kind of likelihood analysis .",
    "this approximation relies on the fact that the likelihood for cosmological parameters is supposed to have a gaussian shape ( at least in the vicinity of its maximum ) and that integration and maximization are known to be equivalent for a multivariate gaussian distribution .    according to bayes theorem , in order to interpret the likelihood functions as probability densities , they to be inverted through a convolution with the relevant priors , representing our knowledge and assumptions on the parameters we want to constrain .",
    "here we shall assume uniform priors , i.e. we will assume that all values of the parameters are equally probable .",
