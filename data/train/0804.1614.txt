    "long term quasi periodic variations with a period of about 217 d are also seen from the rapid burster ( x1730333 ) which is in the form of recurrent outburst rather than a gradual change in x - ray flux @xcite .",
    "cen x-3 is a high mass x - ray binary pulsar with a spin period of @xmath1 s and an orbital period of @xmath2 d , discovered with @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "this x - ray binary is known to have strong long term flux variations with transient quasi - periodicity @xcite .",
    "the long term lightcurve of this source obtained with the all sky monitor ( asm ) of the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( _ rxte _ ) showed very strong aperiodic flux variations along with two different accretion modes @xcite . in 12 years of monitoring data obtained with the _ rxte_-asm in three different energy bands , the hardness ratio between the 5 - 12 kev and 3 - 5 kev bands was found have a larger value during december 2000 to april 2004 , compared to the same outside this period .",
    "long term observations with burst and transient source experiment ( batse ) of the _ compton gamma ray observatory ( cgro ) _ found that cen x-3 has alternate spin - up and spin - down intervals which last from about 10 to 100 days @xcite .",
    "however , _ ginga _",
    "observations revealed that there is no correlation between the observed x - ray flux and pulse period derivative of cen x-3 @xcite and it was suggested that the observed x - ray flux of cen x-3 does not represent its mass accretion rate .",
    "the periodic long term variations seen in x - ray binaries are explained by variable obscuration of the central x - ray source by an accretion disk precessing under tidal force .",
    "the tidal precession can be in the form of forced precession of accretion disks in the gravitational field of the companion star @xcite or slaved precession of accretion disc due to the rotation axis of the star being inclined @xcite .",
    "tilted and twisted disks due to coronal winds @xcite and radiation pressure induced warped precessing disks @xcite can have variable or chaotic precession periods .",
    "iping and petterson ( 1990 ) simulated the temporal evolution of radiatively warped accretion disk and found that it can give rise to aperiodic variability in the x - ray lightcurves .",
    "they suggested that the long term variability of cen x-3 could be caused by such a radiatively warped accretion disk .",
    "other more detailed disk warping models have also been developed where warping instabilities are incorporated into the models which give rise to unstable and chaotic disk precession with no stable long term period @xcite .",
    "accretion torque induced precession of magnetic axis can also be a possible explanation for the observed flux variations @xcite in some x - ray binaries .",
    "third body mechanism is also known to cause periodic x - ray flux variation by modulating the mass accretion rate @xcite .    in the present work",
    "we investigate the orbital modulation of the 1.5 - 12 kev x - ray flux of cen x-3 when the source is in high , intermediate and low states to understand if the aperiodic variations are occuring due to a variable mass accretion rate or due to the variable obscurtion of the central x - ray source by an accretion disk .",
    "the eclipse structure is useful to know the size of the observed x - ray emission region in different flux states .",
    "we have also measured the pulsed and total x - ray emission of the source in its different flux states using many observations by the proportional counter array ( pca ) of the @xmath4 .",
    "evolution of the pulsed fraction with observed x - ray flux is useful to know the relative importance of scattered x - ray emission in different flux states .",
    "the asm on board @xmath4 has three detectors which scan the sky in a series of 90 s dwells in 3 energy bands , namely 1.5 - 3 , 3 - 5 and 5 - 12 kev @xcite .",
    "we have used the 1.5 - 12 kev lightcurves of four sources cen x-3 , her x-1 , smc x-1 and lmc x-4 , covering about 4100 days from january 1996 to study and compare the orbital modulation of these sources in three different flux states .",
    "the lightcurves of the 4 sources binned with their respective orbital periods after excluding the eclipse data are shown in figure 1 , for 500 days .",
    "the distinctly aperiodic flux variation of cen x-3 is in sharp contrast with the periodic modulation in her x-1 ( with one main - on and one short - on state ) , lmc x-4 ( with smaller signal to noise ratio ) and the quasi - periodic modulation in smc x-1 ( with some scatter within each high state ) .",
    "for each of the three sources cen x-3 , her x-1 and smc x-1 , we have made 3 separate lightcurves , one each for the high , intermediate and low flux states .",
    "to do this , we first calculated the average count rate per orbit after excluding the eclipse data ( see paul et .",
    "2005 for more details ) .",
    "depending on the average count rate in a binary orbit , the data points available during that orbit were collected in one of the three high , intermediate or low state lightcurves ( see table 1 for the interval of count rates defining different flux states the three sources ) .",
    "these 3 lightcurves of each source were then folded with the respective orbital period of the source to get the orbital modulation lightcurves .",
    "we have adopted a slightly different analysis for lmc x-4 since its signal to noise ratio is small .",
    "we first folded the asm lightcurve with the superorbital period and determined the ephemeris for superorbital modulation as follows .",
    "@xmath5 } = 50092.8 + ( 30.31\\pm 0.01 ) n , \\label{eq : so_ephemeris}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is an integer . the high , intermediate and low states",
    "were determined based on the suerorbital phase being 0.35 to 0.55 , ( 0.20 to 0.35 , 0.55 to 0.80 ) , and @xmath70.20 to 0.20 , respectively .",
    "data points from the full asm lightcurve belonging to the three different states were then used to make three different lightcurves and folded with the orbital period of lmc x-4 to get the orbital modulation lightcurves .",
    "in figure 2 we have shown the orbital moduation of the four sources in different flux states .",
    "for each soure , the orbital modulation lightcurves of the high and intermediate flux states are shown in the top panel , high state points are indicated by circles .",
    "the low state modulations are shown in the bottom panels .",
    "all the orbital modulation curves are normalised by dividing the original lightcurves by the average count rate calculated over an orbital phase of 0.2 near the peak flux of the respective orbital modulation curve .",
    "the low state asm lightcurve for lmc x-4 does not show any orbtial modulation . in table 1 we have also given the orbital periods and eclipse durations of these 4 sources determined from the _",
    "rxte_-asm lightcurves . in figure 3 , we have shown the flux dependent orbital modulation lightcurve of cen x-3 separately for the hard spectral state , that started in december 2000 and ended in april 2004 ( paul et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "we have also investigated the pulsation characteristics of cen x-3 at different flux levels in the 2 - 60 kev band .",
    "cen x-3 was observed by _",
    "rxte_-pca many times during the years 1996 , 1997 and 1998 .",
    "all these observations have been obtained when cen x-3 was in the soft spectral state .",
    "we have chosen 18 pca observations depending on the orbit averaged asm count rates at that time such that a wide range of x - ray flux is covered .",
    "the 2 - 60 kev band lightcurves were obtained from the standard-1 mode data of the pca .",
    "background lightcurves were generated using the background models provided for _",
    "rxte_-pca by heasarc and were subtracted from standard-1 lightcurves to get the source lightcurves .",
    "the source lightcurves were first barycenter corrected and then searched for the spin period of the neutron star .",
    "we did not detect any pulsations when the orbit averaged asm count rate of cen x-3 was less than 0.8 count / sec ( equivalent to about 50 count / sec per proportional counter unit ) with a 90 per cent upper limit of 0.8 % on the pulsed fraction .",
    "the pulse profiles were then generated by folding the barycenter corrected lightcurves by the respective spin period found in that lightcurve .",
    "to avoid smearing of the pulse profiles due to the orbital motion of the pulsar , the pulse profiles were generated from short data segments of duration of a hundred pulses . in figure 4",
    "we have shown six pulse profiles obtained at different source flux levels including a lightcurve folded in the low flux state with a period of 4.81 s when no pulses were detected .",
    "figure 5 is a plot of the maximum - minimum count rate per proportional counter unit ( pcu ) against the maximum count rate per pcu for the 18 pulse profiles .",
    "the points marked with the circles are for the pulse profiles shown in figure 4 .",
    "epochs of the six pca observations , pulse profiles from which are shown in figure 4 , are marked in the top panel of figure 1 .",
    "a two component function was fitted to the points in figure 5 .",
    "@xmath8    the pulse fraction @xmath9 of the pulsating component was determined to be 90% , while the unpulsed component grows upto a count rate of @xmath10 = 175.5 per pcu .    as seen in figure 4 , apart from the changing ratio of the unpulsed component of the flux to the total flux",
    ", the pulse shape is also varying from one observation to another . to see whether the pulse shape changes are related to the flux , we selected three different observations with very similar eclipse subtracted orbit average asm count rates of @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 . within these three observations ,",
    "the pulse shape changed from a double peak profile to a broad single peak profile but the pulsed fraction remained the same .",
    "we therefore conclude that while the pulsed flux of cen x-3 is related to the total flux , the pulse shape is independent of the x - ray flux .",
    "we have found that in the four sources cen x-3 , her x-1 , smc x-1 and lmc x-4 , the binary orbital modulation of the x - ray flux shows remarkable dependence on the x - ray flux state ( figure 2 ) .",
    "x - ray eclipses are found to be sharp in the high flux state which becomes more gradual in the intermediate state . in the low state , instead of sharp eclipse ingress and egress , there is a smooth flux variation with orbital phase . though the orbital modulation of lmc x-4 is not detectable in the low state of lmc x-4 with asm data , we note that a weak and smooth orbital modulation in the low state of lmc x-4 was clearly detected earlier with _ bepposax _ observations ( naik & paul , 2003 ) . the her x-1 orbital lightcurves show some pre - eclipse dips ( figure 2 ) . in the intermediate state of cen x-3 the eclipse egress starts earlier in phase by  0.03 compared to the high state as is shown with a vertical dashed line .    using a subset of the _ rxte_-asm lightcurve for her",
    "x-1 , scott & leahy ( 1999 ) also found that the orbital modulation is shallower in the short - on state compared to the same in the main - on state . in the _ bepposax _ observations of lmc x-4 , the absence of clear eclipse transitions in low state",
    "was interpreted as due to obscuration of the central x - ray source by the precessing accretion disk .",
    "the weak orbital modulation of the lightcurve in the low state is due to an extended x - ray scttering region , emission from which dominates the detectable x - rays in the low state .",
    "the flux dependent orbital modulations of these four sources indicate that at lower flux , an increasing fraction of the observed x - rays are from a larger region , comparable to the size of the companion star .",
    "the larger emission region may have different visibility at different orbital phases , leading to the smooth orbital modulation in the low state .",
    "reprocessing of x - rays emitted from the compact star by scattering from stellar wind of the companion star is one likely scenario .",
    "however , for her x-1 , which has a low mass companion star , the scattering medium is more likely to be part of the accretion disk and disk outflows than the stellar wind .",
    "zdziarski et al ( 2007a ) have perfomed a similar analysis of _",
    "rxte_-pca lightcurve of the x - ray binary 4u 1820303 and found a significant dependence of the profile of the orbital modulation on the average count rate .",
    "however , in 4u 1820303 , the superorbital modulation is associated with an accretion rate modulation , probably due to third body interaction .",
    "poutanen , zdziarski & ibragimov ( 2008 ) discovered a superorbital phase dependence of the soft x - ray orbital modulation in cyg x-1 in its hard spectral state , that is related to the size of a bulge in the outer accretion disk .",
    "the ratio of the x - ray flux when the source is in eclipse and when it is out - of - eclipse is a measure of the relative scattering efficiency . only for cen",
    "x-3 there is good enough statistics to compare the ratios .",
    "we find that the out - of - eclipse count rates differ by large factor ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 for high , intermediate and low states respectively ) while the in - eclipse count rates of the three states are comparable ( @xmath17 for high , @xmath18 for intermediate and @xmath19 for low state ) .",
    "the eclipse count rate varies by a factor of only about @xmath02.5 while the out of eclipse count rate varies by a factor of @xmath018 .",
    "the ratio of x - ray flux of cen x-3 during eclipse and out - of - eclipse is larger in the low state by a factor of @xmath20 compared to the same in the high state .",
    "this behaviour is similar to smc x-1 , in which the eclipse count rate was found to be comparable in high and low states whereas the out - of - eclipse count rate varied by more than a factor of 20 @xcite .    the measurement of pulsed x - ray flux as a function of the peak x - ray flux of cen x-3 as presented in the figures 4 and 5 , is also consistent with a scenario in which the measured x - ray flux has two components .",
    "one component is highly variable with a pulsed fraction of about 90% and a second component that is unpulsed .",
    "similar result was obtained for smc x-1 over a wide range of its measured x - ray flux @xcite . in the low state ,",
    "the unpulsed component becomes dominant leading to non - detection of pulses .",
    "we also note that in all the four sources mentioned here , the x - ray pulsations ( pulse period of @xmath04.8 s in cen x-3 , 1.24 s in her x-1 , 0.7 s in smc x-1 and 13.5 s in lmc x-4 ) have never been detected during the low state of the superorbital period , indicating that most of the radiation observed in low state is probably reprocessed emission from a large region @xcite .",
    "the non - detection of pulsations is not due to faintness of the sources . even in the low state ,",
    "cen x-3 , her x-1 and smc x-1 are bright enough for detection of a few percent pulse modulation with the _ rxte_-pca .",
    "we point out the possibility that the intrinsic x - ray luminosity of the central x - ray source may remain unchanged for a long time .",
    "it can be seen in figure 1 that except during the anomalous low state events of her x-1 , the peak luminosity of superorbital modulation of her x-1 , smc x-1 and lmc x-4 does not change very much and the peak of the 5 - 12 kev x - ray luminosity of cen x-3 also has a ceiling ( see figure 1 of paul et al .",
    "2005 ) . though the results presented here indicate that the different flux states of cen x-3 are largely due to varying degree of obscuration , as is the case with her x-1 , smc x-1 and lmc x-4 , we can not completely rule out some contribution to the variability from a varying mass accretion rate , especially the variations associated with spectral change . but",
    "as shown in figure 3 , even during the hard spectral state of cen x-3 from december 2000 to april 2004 , the orbital modulation lightcurve indicate an extended x - ray source at low flux level .",
    "detailed observations over a wide spectral range with future missions like _ astrosat _ can throw more light on these aperiodic variations and spectral mode changes seen in cen x-3 lightcurves .",
    "the binary orbital modulation of x - ray from cen x-3 is similar to that seen in the other three accreting x - ray pulsars . from sharp eclipse in high state",
    ", it turns to a gradual modulation in the low state .",
    "cen x-3 eclipse egress starts earlier in the intermediate state compared to the high state .",
    "these observations indicate a larger emission region in the low state of cen x-3 . the ratio of x - ray flux of cen x-3 during eclipse and out - of - eclipse is larger in the low state by a factor of @xmath20 compared to the same in the high state .",
    "a measurement of the pulsed x - ray flux in different flux states of cen x-3 is consistent with the x - ray flux having two components , one with a large pulsed fraction and a second unpulsed component that dominates in the low state .",
    "we propose that the long term intensity variations in cen x-3 are mostly due to aperiodic obscuration of the compact source by the accretion disk .",
    "the unpulsed x - ray emission from an extended region appears to be due to scattering of the x - rays from the central source by the stellar wind .",
    "we thank the referee a. zdziarski for very useful suggestions that helped us very much to improve this paper .",
    "this research has made use of data obtained from the high energy astrophysics science archive research center ( heasarc ) , provided by nasa s goddard space flight centre .",
