    "multiple andreev reflection ( mar ) , first suggested by klapwijk , blonder , and tinkham @xcite for explaning the subharmonic gap structure ( sgs ) in sns junctions , is presently accepted as a general mechanism of subgap current transport in superconducting junctions . during the last five years",
    "a considerable effort has gone into developing a consistent theory of mar capable of including effects of quantum coherence and normal electron scattering by the junction .",
    "different techniques have been used for calculating current - voltage characteristics , including various modifications of keldysh formalism @xcite and the landauer - bttiker scattering method @xcite .",
    "the theory has been extended to resonant tunnel junctions @xcite and junctions of d - wave superconductors @xcite . the theory has successfully explained the sgs in transmissive planar junctions @xcite and atomic - size point contacts @xcite .",
    "the good agreement between the theory and experimental data obtained for one - channel tunnel junctions without fitting parameters @xcite has provided a firm basis for further investigations - revealing the transport channels and transmissivity of individual channels in single - atom contacts @xcite .    despite successful numerical calculations of subgap current- voltage characteristics for different types of junctions ,",
    "the general understanding of mar is still not sufficient , and interpretation of particular features of sgs , e.g. current peaks , presents difficulties .",
    "this especially concerns resonant mar , where the energy dispersion of electron scattering phase shifts is important .    in this paper",
    ", we present an approach where mar is treated as a wave propagation problem in energy space ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . using scattering theory formalism , we derive an adequate mapping of mar onto a transmission problem through a 1d wave guide with a built in multiple tunnel barrier structure .",
    "all parameters of this structure are uniquely determined by the junction characteristics ( normal and andreev scattering amplitudes ) and by the applied voltage . in terms of such a mapping , the onsets and peaks of sgs",
    "are explained in terms of resonances in the transmission along the energy axis .",
    "the mapping allows us consistently to separate currents associated with @xmath0-particle transmission processes @xcite and to prove the cancellation of non - physical ground state currents , which is equivalent to the pauli exclusion principle .",
    "we consider two superconducting reservoirs connected to a single normal conducting channel which may contain tunnel barriers ( x - region ) ( see fig .",
    "the transport properties of this channel is described by its transfer matrix . using an energy dependent transfer matrix we can model any effective single - particle potential structure , including the important scattering phase shifts in long and resonant junctions . in general",
    "the transfer matrix is also voltage dependent , and deriving this dependence for any given physical model is a problem in its own right . but having found this transfer matrix , we can determine the current when the contacting reservoirs are in the superconducting state .",
    "we place the origin of our coordinate system in the middle of the junction ; the normal - superconducting ( ns ) interfaces are then located at @xmath1 and @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the length of the junction ( fig .",
    "1 ) . due to the point - contact geometry of our junction , the superconducting pair potential can be considered steplike , @xmath4",
    ".    we will construct scattering states in terms of the transfer matrix of the x - region .",
    "to this end we introduce two auxilliary normal regions , between the x - region and the superconducting electrodes .",
    "these regions are assumed to have the same material parameters as the electrodes , providing perfect ns - interfaces , and their length is much smaller than the coherence length .    to calculate the scattering states we first make an ansatz in terms of a sum of plane - wave solutions to the bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) equation in the left / right auxiliary normal regions ( @xmath5 ) and in the left / right superconductors ( @xmath6 ) . in superconductors ,",
    "the energy is commonly counted from the chemical potential which is motivated by the electron - hole symmetry .",
    "this is not convenient in voltage biased junctions because the chemical potentials in the left ( @xmath7 ) and right ( @xmath8 ) electrodes are different . a global reference of energy , which is particularly desirable in the case of an energy dependent transfer matrix , can be introduced by making different gauge transformations in the left and right superconducting electrodes .",
    "this procedure gives rise to the appearance of time - dependent phase factors in the wave functions of the superconducting electrodes implying inelastic scattering .",
    "to get symmetrical expressions for quasiparticles incoming from the left and from the right we choose @xmath9 as a global reference of energy , i.e. the reference energy is in the middle of the chemical potentials in the left and right superconductors .",
    "we thus get different time - dependences for electron and hole components in _ both superconductors , _",

    "we notice that both electrons and holes with positive @xmath49-value gain energy in passing the junction ( for our choice of the sign of bias ) , while particles with negative @xmath49-value lose energy .",

    "the charge current in the original superconducting junction is expressed through this leakage , which is identical to the probability current of outgoing quasiparticles in the superconductors . in terms of such a mapping , the sgs is explained in terms of resonances in the transmission along the energy axis .",
    "three different types of resonances have been found which are important for the interpretation of sgs : ( i ) superconducting resonances induced by electron - hole dephasing and the andreev reflections , ( ii ) boundary resonances induced by reflections from the boundaries of the wave guide , and ( iii ) normal electron ( breit - wigner ) resonances , which may exist in addition to former two types of the resonances , which are always present in mar .",
