    "the observed azimuthal asymmetries in the @xmath1 spectra in non - central collisions ( the so - called elliptic flow , @xmath2 ) can be well accounted for through the pressure gradients as obtained from a locally equilibrated medium driven by hydrodynamic expansion  @xcite .",

    "the emission of virtual photons ( aka dileptons , @xmath4 or @xmath5 ) carries additional information in terms of their invariant mass , @xmath6 .",
    "in fact , dilepton invariant - mass spectra are the only observable which gives direct access to the in - medium modification of a hadronic spectral function ( strong decays like @xmath7 or @xmath8 suffer from final state absorption and are largely emanating from the freezeout process of the collision ) .",
    "this is evident from the 8-differential thermal production rate , @xmath9 which only depends on the in - medium spectral function , im@xmath10 , its thermal weight in terms of the bose - einstein distribution , @xmath11 , and a free virtual - photon propagator , @xmath12 .",

    "note that light vector mesons ( especially the @xmath21 ) may well serve as a prototype hadronic resonance ( it is neither a goldstone boson nor a heavy - quark state ) in the sense that their fate in hot / dense matter is shared by large set of resonances .",
    "a hadron - resonance gas is known to give a good approximation of the the qcd partition function until close to the phase transition  @xcite .",
    "mass de - generation and deconfinement are closely related to the fate of the qcd condensates in the medium .",
    "figure  [ fig_lat ] shows recent results of thermal lattice qcd for order parameters of the corresponding qcd phase transition(s ) .",
    "these calculations are carried out for @xmath24=2 + 1-flavor qcd with realistic light quark masses and clearly demonstrate the cross - over of the transition from a chirally broken hadronic phase to chirally restored partonic matter .",
    "it is rather intriguing , though , that the inflection points of these quantities , usually associated with the pseudo - critical temperature , seem to be separated by about 20mev , i.e. , @xmath25mev and @xmath26mev for chiral restoration and deconfinement , respectively . even without the notion of a pseudo - critical temperature , which is not unambiguous , it is still remarkable that at , say , @xmath27@xmath28160  mev the polyakov loop has risen by merely @xmath2910% toward its asymptotic value while the chiral condensate has already dropped to below 50% .",

    "this would furthermore imply that hadronic degrees of freedom are the adequate basis to address mechanisms of chiral restoration .",
    "partial chiral restoration in the hadronic phase is very encouraging from an experimental point of view , as it turns out that thermal dilepton emission in the low - mass region ( lmr , @xmath31gev ) is dominated by the contribution from hot and dense matter at temperatures @xmath32mev ( this follows from the interplay of the increasing 3-volume and the decreasing thermal bose factor in the space - time integrated spectral yield , see sec .",

    "the level of precision set by the na60 mass spectra several further diagnostics of the produced medium become available , as discussed in the following .",

    "it also exhibits a rather strong rise for temperatures beyond that .",
    "this rise becomes even more pronounced in chemically equilibrated matter where the effective meson - chemical potentials are switched off ( squares ; at fixed @xmath157 this also implies a slight reduction in @xmath30 ) .",
    "it is not unlike the increase of the thermodynamic state variables in the hadron - resonance gas around a similar temperature .",
    "no such behavior emerges at comparable temperatures if baryon - induced medium effects are switched off .",
    "since the average width implies the occurrence of larger widths in the course of the medium expansion , a situation with @xmath158 must be realized , i.e. , resonance melting .",
    "it is important to note that baryon - induced medium effects remain a key player at rhic  @xcite .",
    "this is so because the @xmath21 equally interacts with baryons ( @xmath159 ) and anti - baryons ( @xmath160 ) due to cp invariance of strong interactions ( the @xmath21 is a cp eigenstate ) .",
    "therefore , the sum ( not the difference ) of @xmath152 and @xmath161 is the relevant quantity for medium effects . at rhic ,",
    "the rapidity density of baryons plus antibaryons is slightly larger than at sps , while the pion rapidity density is roughly a factor of 2 larger , implying an accordingly increased fireball volume at given temperature .",
    "thus , the  effective \" density @xmath162 , is not very different at sps and rhic , and probably also at lhc . from a theoretical point of view",

    "let us briefly comment on the current situation of low - mass dilepton measurements at rhic .",
    "the phenix collaboration found a very large enhancement for masses below the free @xmath21 mass in central au - au(@xmath129=200agev ) collisions  @xcite which is largely concentrated at low transverse momenta , @xmath166gev .",

    "historically , the best experimental tool to serve as a  thermometer \" of the early phases in urhics was believed to be thermal radiation of photons . with a structureless emission rate , the slope of the spectrum",
    "is directly related to the temperature of the system , modulo a blue - shift from transverse expansion which is expected to be small in the early stages . at sps energies ,",
    "the presence of a significant excess signal of photons , i.e. , beyond those from initial production and final - state decays of long - lived hadrons ( mostly @xmath167 ) , remains inconclusive  @xcite . at rhic , however , the phenix collaboration has observed a strong excess signal in semi-/central au - au collisions  @xcite for transverse momenta above @xmath168gev up to at least 3 - 4gev , beyond which the primordial production extrapolated from binary @xmath169-@xmath169 collisions dominates , see left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig_phenix - gam ] (  excess \" plus  primordial \" are usually referred to as  direct \" photons , i.e. long - lived decays subtracted ) .",
    "this range nicely coincides with theoretical expectations of where the qgp radiation is most visible  @xcite .",
    "the inverse slope of the excess radiation was found to be consistent with an exponential with temperature @xmath170mev .",
    "this seems to point at a source well inside the qgp , albeit not to the very early phases where temperatures above 300mev are expected , recall  fig .",

    "i.e. , for @xmath171gev , the elliptic - flow coefficient , @xmath172 , is comparable to those of pions , which are only emitted at the end of the fireball evolution , i.e. , with maximal @xmath2 . on the contrary ,",
    "the excess photons are supposed to be emitted throughout the evolution ( including early , where the @xmath2 is still small ) , and the primordial ones should carry zero @xmath2 .",
    "more quantitatively , predictions of thermal - photon @xmath2 using hydrodynamic models with qgp - dominated excess radiation lead to maximal values of @xmath173% for direct photons in 0 - 20% au - au(@xmath129=200agev ) collisions  @xcite , well below the phenix data . in these calculations",

    "@xcite we therefore revisited our earlier calculations of direct photons  @xcite by refining the thermal fireball model as to quantitatively describe the @xmath1 spectra and elliptic flow of bulk hadrons , freezing out at @xmath174mev , and multistrange hadrons , kinetically decoupling close to chemical freezeout , @xmath175mev .",
    "this , in particular , led to harder thermal photon spectra from the hadronic phase , thus exceeding the qgp contribution over the for thermal emission relevant @xmath154 range up to 3 - 4gev .",

    "however , the latter part of the interpretation is not unique and one should keep in mind the following features : ( a ) the @xmath21-mass region , @xmath181-@xmath182gev , is predominantly populated by contributions from the late fireball stages , since the @xmath21 spectral shape is recovering its vacuum form which prominently figures around @xmath183 ; ( b ) the interplay of thermal factor and 3-volume implies that going up in mass the emission is  biased \" toward the earlier phases ( recall fig .

    "<S> a status report of utilizing soft electromagnetic radiation ( aka thermal photons and dileptons ) in the diagnosis of strongly interacting matter in ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions is given . </S>",
    "<S> after briefly elaborating on relations of the electromagnetic spectral function to chiral symmetry restoration and the transition from hadron to quark degrees of freedom , various calculations of electromagnetic emission rates in the hadronic and quark - gluon plasma phases of qcd matter are discussed . </S>",
