    "for asymmetric nuclear matter we follow the thermodynamic approach of refs . @xcite and @xcite",
    ". the system will be stable against separation into two phases if the free energy of a single phase is lower than the free energy in all two - phase configurations .",
    "this requirement can be formulated as @xcite @xmath135 with @xmath136 where @xmath137 is the helmholtz free energy per unit volume .",
    "the two phases are denoted by a prime and a double prime .",
    "the stability condition implies the following set of inequalities : @xmath138 @xmath139 if one of the stability conditions is violated , a system with two phases is energetically favored .",
    "the phase coexistence is governed by the gibbs conditions : @xmath140 @xmath141 where the temperature is the same in the two phases .",
    "the parameters in this model are determined by the meson masses in vacuum and the properties of nuclear matter which were listed in table i of ref .",
    "we first discuss the liquid - gas phase transition of symmetric nuclear matter . in fig .  1 , we show the pressure of the system versus nucleon density at different temperatures using the square root anstz for the effective nucleon mass ( eq .",
    "( [ square ] ) ) . at low temperature , the pressure first increases and then decreases with increasing density .",
    "the @xmath142 isotherms exhibit the form of two phase coexistence , with an unphysical region for each . at temperature",
    "@xmath143 mev , there appears a point of inflection , where @xmath144 , @xmath145 .",
    "this temperature is called the critical temperature .",
    "symmetric nuclear matter can only be in gas phase above this temperature .",
    "the pressure versus nucleon density with the linear definition of effective nucleon mass ( eq .",

    "in this case , the critical temperature is 17.9 mev . in both cases ,",
    "the calculated critical temperature is close to the recent result @xmath8 mev , which was obtained by natowitz @xmath6 @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the critical temperature calculated with the walecka model is larger than 20 mev .",
    "this large @xmath1 is partially caused by the large incompressibility modulus k ( @xmath146 540 mev ) .",
    "for the same reason the stiff skyrme interaction sk1 gives a large @xmath1 , which is close to 20 mev , while the soft skyrme interaction skm@xmath147 gives a small @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the qmc model and the effective model based on @xmath148 chiral symmetry provide reasonable values of @xmath1 , around 15 - 16 mev @xcite .    for the asymmetric case ,",
    "the situation is more complicated .",
    "one can not get the critical temperature from the @xmath142 isotherms .",
    "the chemical potentials of the proton and neutron are different .",
    "we show the chemical potential versus asymmetric parameter @xmath4 at temperature @xmath149 mev and pressure @xmath150 mev@xmath151 with the square root definition of effective nucleon mass in fig .  3 ( for convenience , we use the reduced chemical potential which is defined as @xmath152 . ) the solid and dashed lines are for proton and neutron respectively .",
    "the gibbs equations ( [ eq_gibbsmu ] ) and ( [ eq_gibbsp ] ) for phase equilibrium demand equal pressure and chemical potentials for two phases with different concentrations . the desired solution can be found by means of the geometrical construction shown in fig .  3 , which guarantees the same pressure and chemical potentials for protons and neutrons in the two phases with different asymmetry parameter @xmath4 .",
    "the pairs of solutions found using the method just described , yield a binodal curve which is shown in fig .  4 .",
    "there is a critical point where the pressure is about 0.205 mev-@xmath151 and the corresponding asymmetry parameter is around 0.7 .",
    "the two phases have the same @xmath4 and therefore the same density at this point .",
    "the binodal curve is divided into two branches by the critical point .",
    "one branch corresponds to the high density ( liquid ) phase , the other corresponds to the low density ( gas ) phase .",
    "assume the system is initially prepared in the low density ( gas ) phase with @xmath153 .",
    "when the pressure increases to some value , the two - phase region is encountered at point a and a liquid phase at b with a low @xmath4 begins to emerge .",
    "as the system is compressed , the gas phase evolves from point a to c , while the liquid phase evolves from b to d. if the pressure of the system continues to increase , the system will leave the two - phase region at point d. the gas phase disappears and the system is entirely in the liquid phase .",
    "this kind of phase transition is different from the normal first order phase transition where the pressure remains constant during phase transition .",
    "if the initial asymmetric nucleon gas is larger than some value , the system enters and leaves the two phase region on the same branch .",
    "for example , the system becomes unstable at point a@xmath154 and a liquid phase with a higher nucleon density begins to emerge at b@xmath154 . the system is compressed at a fixed total @xmath4 , with the gas phase evolving from a@xmath154 to c@xmath154 and the liquid phase from b@xmath154 to d@xmath154.the system leaves the two - phase region point c@xmath154 which is still in the original gas phase .",
    "therefore , for a given temperature , if the total asymmetry parameter of the system is larger than a critical value , the system can not change completely into the liquid phase , however large the pressure .",
    "in other words , for a system with a fixed asymmetric parameter @xmath4 , there exists a critical temperature , above which the system can only be in the gas phase at any pressure .    the @xmath4 dependence of the critical temperature is shown in fig .",
    "the solid and dashed lines correspond to the square root anstz and the linear definition of effective nucleon mass , respectively .",
    "@xmath1 decreases with increasing @xmath4 . for the square root case ,",
    "when @xmath4 is less than 0.2 , the decrease of @xmath1 is very small .",
    "when @xmath4 is larger than 0.6 , @xmath1 decreases very fast .",
    "if @xmath4 is larger than 0.88 , the system can only be in the gas phase at any temperature . in the linear case ,",
    "the critical temperature is 2 mev larger than that in the square root case .",
    "the liquid - gas phase transition can occur for nuclear matter with any @xmath4 if the temperature is lower than the critical temperature .",
    "the critical temperature of asymmetric nuclear matter was also studied in the walecka model , the derivative scalar coupling model and the qmc model @xcite where the authors found different critical temperatures for protons and neutrons .",
    "the lower critical temperature was chosen to be the @xmath1 of the system as an approximation .",
    "their results show that @xmath1 decreases almost linearly with increasing @xmath4 , which is different from the results shown in fig .",
    "we use the stability conditions on the free energy , conservation laws and the gibbs criterion for the liquid - gas phase transition of asymmetric nuclear matter , following mller and serot @xcite .",
    "this is expected to be better than the approximation used in the earlier discussion .      in this subsection",
    ", we discuss the liquid - gas phase equilibrium for finite nuclei . compared with the case of infinite nuclear matter ,",
    "the size effect and coulomb interaction are important for finite nuclei . when the coulomb interaction is considered , the chemical potential for the protons will have an additional term corresponding to a uniformly charged sphere : @xmath155 where @xmath156 and @xmath157 are the charge number and radius of finite nuclei .",
    "meanwhile , the pressure also has an extra term : @xmath158 where a is the mass number of the nucleus and @xmath104 is its density . for a liquid droplet ,",
    "the surface pressure is @xmath159 in the above equation , @xmath160 is the surface tension suggested by goodman @xmath6",
    "@xmath7 @xcite @xmath161\\left[1-\\frac{t}{t_c}\\right],\\ ] ] where @xmath1 is the critical temperature for infinite symmetric nuclear matter .",
    "the gibbs conditions for two phase equilibrium now becomes @xmath162 @xmath163 @xmath164 when the temperature is higher than a temperature ( limiting temperature ) , the above equations have no solution .",
    "the finite nuclei can not exist in equilibrium with the surrounding vapor .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "6 the mass number dependence of the limiting temperature , @xmath5 , for nuclei along the line of @xmath165-stability : @xmath166 the solid and dashed lines correspond to the square root anstz and the linear definition of the effective nucleon mass , respectively .",
    "the experimental values obtained recently by natowitz @xcite are also plotted in the figure for comparison .",
    "the calculated results in this model are in good agreement with the experimental data . the limiting temperature decreases with increasing mass number .",
    "this means that when the temperature is higher than the limiting temperature , the heavy nuclei will fragment to light nuclei .",
    "two useful parameterizations of @xmath167 , valid for @xmath168 , are @xmath169 ( square root case ) and @xmath170 ( linear case ) , which are comparable with that given in ref",
    ".  @xcite .",
    "calculations from other models also show that @xmath5 decreases with increasing mass number .",
    "numerical results show that there is a relationship between @xmath5 and @xmath1 . for larger @xmath1 ,",
    "the calculated @xmath5 is also larger .",
    "therefore , the results for @xmath5 found with the walecka model and the sk1 interaction are larger , while the results of the skm@xmath147 interaction are smaller compared with the experiments @xcite .",
    "the values of @xmath5 calculated for both the qmc model and the effective model suggested by furnstahl @xmath6 @xmath7 @xcite are close to our results .",
    "in this paper , we extended the chiral @xmath0 quark mean field model to finite temperature and density .",
    "this model describes properties of infinite nuclear matter , finite nuclei and hypernuclei very well at zero temperature .",
    "the saturation properties and compression modulus of nuclear matter are reasonable .",
    "the hyperon potentials are close to the empirical values for hadronic matter .",
    "the results for finite nuclei and hypernuclei are also consistent with experiment .",
    "we therefore want to know whether this model can also describe the system at finite temperature .",
    "the liquid - gas phase transition of infinite nuclear matter and the coulomb instability of finite nuclei at finite temperature are discussed in this model .",
    "all the parameters have been determined in earlier papers and there is no further parameter to be adjusted .",
    "the critical temperatures for two - phase coexistence of symmetric nuclear matter , @xmath1 , is 15.82 mev ( square root case ) and 17.9 mev ( linear case ) .",
