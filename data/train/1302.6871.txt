    "numerous and different data collected during the last years have established the standard cosmological model as a simple framework showing a remarkable agreement with observations . this model is based on einstein s general relativity and a homogeneous and isotropic _ ansatz _ for the metric .",
    "however , in addition to ordinary matter , two new elements need to be added : a cosmological constant or other form of dark energy to account for the late time acceleration of the universe , and dark matter ( dm ) to explain the formation and dynamics of cosmic structures .",
    "however , despite the multiple efforts , the fundamental nature of dm remains still as an open problem .",
    "there are strong astrophysical evidences for dm from galactic to cosmological scales , but the interactions with ordinary matter have not been probed beyond gravitational effects . in this sense ,",
    "both direct and indirect dm searches are fundamental to explore particle models of dm .    in the framework of indirect searches ,",
    "the observation of gamma - ray fluxes from astrophysical sources represents one of the main approaches to the dm puzzle . if dm annihilates into sm particles , the subsequent chains of decay and hadronization of unstable products produce gamma - ray photons generically .",
    "the observation of this signal is highly affected by astrophysical uncertainties in the gamma - ray backgrounds and in the dm densities and distribution . on the other hand , depending on both astrophysical and particle physics models of dm , the signature could be distinguishable from the background .",
    "appealing targets for gamma - ray observations of annihilating dm are mainly selected according to the abundance of dm in the source and their distance .",
    "galaxy clusters , dwarfs spheroidal galaxies ( dsph ) or the galactic center ( gc ) of the milky way are traditional targets of interest .",
    "galaxy clusters are very rich in dm , but they are very distant objects .",
    "dsphs are also characterized by high dm densities but at much shorter distances . in any case , despite their proximity , observations of dsphs have not been able to detect any gamma - ray flux signature over the background so far @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the gc represents a very close target , but the complexity of the region , due to the high concentration of sources , makes the analysis quite involved .    in this work , we will focus on the analysis of very high energy ( vhe ) gamma - rays coming from the gc .",
    "different observations from the gc have been reported by several collaborations such as cangaroo @xcite , veritas @xcite , hess @xcite , magic @xcite and fermi - lat @xcite .",
    "in particular , we will analyze the data collected by the hess collaboration during the years 2004 , 2005 , and 2006 associated with the hess j1745 - 290 gc source @xcite .",
    "the interpretation of these fluxes as dm signal has been widely discussed in the literature from the very early days of the publication of the observed data @xcite .",
    "it was concluded that the spectral features of these gamma - rays disfavored the dm origin @xcite .",
    "however , in recent studies @xcite , it has been pointed out that these fluxes are compatible with the spectral signal of dm annihilation provided it is complemented with a simple background .",
    "this extra source of gamma - rays can be originated by radiative processes generated by particle acceleration in the vicinity of sgr a east supernova and the supermassive black hole @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we present a systematic study of this assumption : in section [ hess ] , we show an analysis of the source , while a brief review of the gamma - ray flux coming from annihilating dm in galactic sources is presented in section [ dm ] .",
    "the fit of the hess data with a total fitting function given by the combination of the background power law component with annihilating dm signature is discussed in section [ fit ] . in section",
    "v , we include in the analysis the data collected by fermi - lat from the same region .",
    "we summarize the main results of our work and prospects for future analyses in section [ con ] .",
    "finally , an appendix provides useful details for reproducing the statistical study performed in these analyses .",
    "dm is expected to be clumped in the central region of standard galaxies . in this sense , the central part of the milky way could be an important source of gamma - rays produced in the dm annihilation processes .",
    "because of its closeness , the gc represents a very appealing target for the indirect search of dm , but the complex nature of this area makes the identification of the sources quite difficult .",
    "several sources have been detected not only in the gamma - ray , but also in the infrared and x - ray ranges of the spectrum .",
    "the absence of variability in the collection of hess j1745 - 290 data in the tev scale , during the years 2004 , 2005 and 2006 , suggests that the emission mechanism and emission regions differ from those invoked in the variable infrared and x - ray emissions @xcite .",
    "the significance of the signal reduces to few tenths of degree @xcite , but the angular distribution of the very high energy gamma - ray emission shows the presence of an adjunctive diffuse component .",
    "the fundamental nature of this source is still unclear .",
    "these gamma - rays could have been originated by particle propagation @xcite in the neighborhood of the sgr a east supernova remnant and the supermassive black hole sgr a , both located at the central region of our galaxy @xcite .",
    "if it was originated by the dm distribution , the morphology of the source requires a very compressed dm structure .",
    "in fact , it has been claimed @xcite that baryonic gas could account for similar effects when falling to the central region , modifying the gravitational potential and increasing the dm density in the center ( see however @xcite ) .",
    "if this is the case , the dm annihilating fluxes are expected to be enhanced by an important factor with respect to dm alone simulations , such as the classical nfw profile @xcite .    in previous works @xcite , important deviations from a power law spectrum have been already reported , and a cut - off at several tens of tevs has been proved as a distinctive feature of the spectrum .",
    "for instance , the observed data were compared to a simple power law : @xmath5 and a power law with high energy exponential cut - off : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the flux normalization , @xmath8 is the spectral index and @xmath9 is the cut - off energy . the measured spectrum for the three - year dataset ranges from 260 gev to 60 tev .",
    "we have reproduced these analyses with the results that can be found in figs .",
    "[ bgfit ] and [ bgcutfit ] .",
    "they are consistent with previous works @xcite , since the spectrum is well described by a power law with exponential cut - off ( fig .",
    "[ bgcutfit ] ) , while a simple power law is clearly inconsistent ( fig .",
    "[ bgfit ] ) ."
