    "the leo  ii dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) galaxy was originally discovered in the course of the palomar sky survey @xcite .",
    "its great distance from the milky way ( mw ) marked it as being significant , so it was the target of early studies ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "@xcite found evidence for dark matter from its 11 kms@xmath5 velocity dispersion , while @xcite obtained the first hst - based color magnitude diagram ( cmd ) from wfpc2 photometry , deriving an age of @xmath11 gyr for its intermediate age population .",
    "the most recent distance estimates , measured from the tip of the red giant branch , place leo  ii at @xmath12 kpc @xcite from the mw , and it remains as one of the most distant known mw satellites that are candidates to be bound to the galaxy .",
    "a recent analysis of 171 stellar radial velocities by @xcite finds no evidence that the galaxy is experiencing the effects of tidal disruption , and indicates a mass to light ratio of 2550 ( m / l)@xmath13 .",
    "the leo  ii dwarf galaxy is of great interest not only as a distant companion that offers a constraint on the mass of the milky way ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but also as one of the nearest galaxies that might have conceivably undergone evolution in isolation from the effect of the milky way .",
    "furthermore , its orbital path provides an important feature of the evolutionary history of the leo  ii dwarf .",
    "proper motions of other nearby dsphs have been detected and estimated using images from the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "a proper motion was determined for the fornax dsph ( d@xmath14 kpc ) by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , for ursa minor ( d@xmath666 kpc ) by @xcite , sculptor ( d@xmath679 kpc ) by @xcite , carina ( d@xmath6 100 kpc ) @xcite , and the small magellanic cloud ( d@xmath658 kpc ) by @xcite . in all cases , the orbital integration based on current galactic mass models yields bound orbits , with apogalactic distances not exceeding @xmath15150 kpc ,",
    "although including the proper motion uncertainties , one can not rule out apogalactic distances as high as 300 kpc for sculptor at the 95% confidence level @xcite .",
    "however , recent proper motion measurements of the large and small magellanic clouds yield space velocities larger than expected , which suggests that the two objects may be only marginally bound to the galaxy @xcite .    due to their relatively large distances ,",
    "the proper motions of dsphs are at the sub - pixel level over the baselines typically available from hst archival images ( @xmath16 years ) .",
    "for example , at a distance of 100 kpc , a 100 kms@xmath5 velocity translates into a proper motion of only 0.211 mas yr@xmath5 , which yields a net motion of only 0.03 pixels on the wfpc2 camera over a period of 15 years . due to the undersampling of the point spread function in hst images ,",
    "the detection of such a small astrometric motion requires a special astrometric reduction procedure .",
    "the _ effective point spread function _ ( epsf ) method , pioneered by @xcite and @xcite , is well suited to the task .",
    "we have developed our own reduction software , based on the epsf method , in order to detect and calculate the proper motion of leo  ii .",
    "this paper presents initial results from this analysis , which allows us for the first time to investigate whether this remote dsph is an actual , bound satellite to the mw and , if so , to study in detail its orbital characteristics .",
    "the archival hst datasets used in our study are described in  2 .",
    "the astrometric reduction is summarized in  3 .",
    "the identification of extragalactic sources , critical in establishing an astrometric reference frame , is described in  4 .",
    "the proper motion of leo  ii is calculated in  5 .",
    "the inferred space motion and orbit of leo  ii is discussed in  6 .",
    "the dsph leo  ii was first observed with the wide field and planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) on may 15 , 1994 .",
    "in addition to a pair of shallow 80s exposures in the f555w band , a total of eight deep exposures ( 600 seconds each ) were obtained in each of the f555w and f814w bands .",
    "dithering patterns were not generally used at the time , and the 1994 frames have no significant offsets between them .",
    "leo  ii was reobserved on march 19 , 2004 .",
    "this time , only eight exposures in the f814w band were obtained , 500 - 700 seconds each .",
    "the 2004 fields are aligned with the 1994 fields to within @xmath17 , and with the same field orientation .",
    "the 2004 exposures followed a 4-point dithering pattern .",
    "frames 1 and 2 constitute a pair with no offset between each other , as are the pairs consisting of frames 3 - 4 , 5 - 6 , and 7 - 8 .",
    "the 4-point dithering pattern occurs between each of the pairs .",
    "leo  ii was observed again on march 25 , 2008 , yielding eight exposures of 1,100 seconds in each of the f555w and f814w bands .",
    "this time an 8-point dithering pattern was used , so no two images are perfectly aligned , and display small offsets between each other .",
    "the 2008 frames have the same orientation as the 1994 and 2004 frames , but are offset by 20@xmath18 in the direction of right ascension .",
    "this means that on one side of each wf camera frame from 1994/2004 , there is a band @xmath19 pixels wide which is not covered by the 2008 exposures .",
    "this leaves an area approximately 4 arcmin@xmath20 , or 75% of the field of view of the wide field camera chips , which was imaged at all three epochs .",
    "the center of the wfpc2 field of view was offset only @xmath21 from the center of the dwarf spheroidal . with leo  ii having a core radius of 2.64@xmath22 @xcite",
    ", the hst observations thus cover @xmath23 of the area within the core radius of leo  ii .",

    "the method consists of fitting the pixel profile of a source @xmath24_{i , j}=p_k(i , j)$ ] with a local representation of the response of the camera to a point source @xmath25 , where @xmath26 denote the hypothetical location of the point source in the @xmath27 pixel grid . instead of being modeled by a mathematical function , the functional form of @xmath28 , the epsf ,",
    "is extracted from the data using the multiple samplings provided by the large number of point sources in the field , because each of the @xmath29 sources provides samplings of @xmath28 at the locations @xmath30 . because the hypothetical locations of the point sources @xmath26 are not known _ a priori _ , the functional form of @xmath28",
    "must be determined using an iterative procedure , where the @xmath26 are re - calculated and the functional form of @xmath28 re - evaluated after each iteration , as described in @xcite .",
    "we have developed our own reduction software , which determines the epsf directly out of the data , using an iteration procedure , exactly as prescribed in ak .",
    "our epsf is determined separately for each of the three epochs , and independently for each band .",
    "an epsf is also calculated separately for each of the wide field camera frames ( wf2 , wf3 , wf4 ) , and the epsf is allowed to vary continuously across the frame , following its separate determination in each of nine sectors across the chip . since our general procedure is in most points identical to the one described in @xcite , we do not repeat the details here .",
    "once a satisfactory epsf is determined , an algorithm is used to converge the centroid @xmath26 of each source .",
    "the algorithm differs from a least - square fit in that it uses a weighting of all the pixels proportial to the local first derivative of the epsf profile , which gives more weight to the profile edges than to the central pixel which often yield little positional information .",
    "the flux @xmath31 of the source is re - evaluated after each iteration from an epsf fit of the stellar profile calculated for the current @xmath26 estimate .",
    "convergence is attained after 5 - 10 iterations .",
    "a @xmath32 test is then used to evaluate the goodness of fit ; sources which differ significantly from the epsf  such as camera artifacts , cosmic ray events , and very extended sources ( e.g. galaxies )  are rejected .",
    "the first moments of the residuals @xmath33 are calculated as : @xmath34_{i , j } - f_k \\psi(i - x_k , j - y_k ) , \\ ] ] and should be @xmath350 assuming @xmath31 is a close estimate of the flux .",
    "second moments of the distribution @xmath36 are then calculated , which offer a quantification of how much intrinsic `` spread '' there is in the source compared to the local epsf : @xmath37_{i , j } - f_k \\psi(i - x_k , j - y_k ) \\right ) .\\ ] ] the second moment is expected to be @xmath38 only if the source has approximately the same spread as the local epsf  i.e. it is unresolved by the camera .",
    "but if the source has a profile different from the epsf , then @xmath36 could be significantly different from 0 .",
    "this value @xmath36 thus works like a `` sharpness parameter '' , distinguishing between resolved and unresolved sources .",
    "we find that the vast majority of the stars in the leo  ii field have @xmath39 , which determines the range over which sources can be considered point - like ; we use those sources to define the local astrometric grid .",
    "sources with a second moment @xmath40 , have a significantly larger spread than expected from the local epsf , and are effectively resolved by the camera .",
    "this is clear in fig.1 where we see a tail of sources with larger @xmath36 values .",
    "visual examination of sources with large measured values of @xmath36 indeed reveals the sources to be noticeably extended compared with most other sources in the field .",
    "sources with a very large sharpness factor ( @xmath41 ) are so broadened compare to the epsf that they generally _ fail _ the @xmath32 test and are rejected by the code ; hence the sources which are detected by the code but flagged as `` resolved '' are still relatively compact objects .",
    "the `` unresolved '' sources are used to build a relative astrometric frame .",
    "astrometric corrections are performed in multiple steps , in order to bring the positions measured in all exposures / epochs into a single common reference grid .",
    "each unresolved source is used in defining the grid with a weight proportional to its estimated astrometric uncertainty ; in effect this yields a larger weight on the brighter sources .",
    "corrections are performed first on individual frames of a given epoch / band ; these correct for small offsets , rotations , or dilations between successive images , notably the offsets from the dithering patterns and also changes in the field scale due to thermal dilation in hst and the wfpc2 .",
    "average positions are then recalculated for each epoch / band using the mean position of all the measurements from that particular set .",
    "additional corrections are then performed to bring the calculated mean positions from all seven epochs / bands into a common master grid .",
    "finally , proper motions are calculated for each individual source , by a linear regression of the mean position of the source as a function of epoch .",
    "astrometric and photometric data for all of the unresolved ( point - like ) sources is provided in table 1 .",
    "the table lists the measured positions and relative proper motions of the 3,224 sources , along with f555w and f814w magnitudes .",
    "we also list the second moments @xmath42 of the source profiles .",
    "the wf camera frame ( 2 - 4 ) in which the source was detected is also listed .",

    "extragalactic reference objects are distributed over all three independent camera frames .",
    "the extragalactic sources are also relatively spread out and sample both the centers and edges of each field .",
    "astrometric and photometric data for the extra - galactic reference objects is provided in table 2 .",
    "the table lists the measured positions and proper motions of the 17 sources , along with f555w and f814w magnitudes .",
    "we also list the second moments @xmath42 of the source profiles ( see  3 above ) , which measures how the profiles compare to a point source .",
    "the wf camera frame ( 2 - 4 ) in which the source was detected is also listed .",
    "the identification of a set of extra - galactic sources makes it possible , in principle , to estimate a proper motion for leo  ii by measuring the systemic proper motion of these extra - galactic sources relative to the astrometric reference frame defined by the stellar members of leo  ii .",
    "absolute _ proper motion of leo  ii with respect to the extragalactic rest frame is then simply the vector opposite to this _ relative _ proper motion of extragalactic sources .",
    "as this represents the proper motion measured from the heliocentric rest frame , the component of the solar motion around the galaxy must the be taken into account to determine an absolute proper motion relative to a reference frame at rest relative to the galactic barycenter , from which the orbit of leo  ii can be calculated .",
    "first we examine the proper motion in the direction of the x and y pixel positions ( @xmath47 , @xmath48 ) .",
    "these are different from r.a . and dec .",
    ", because each of the three wf2 , wf3 , and wf4 cameras has its x - y axis oriented differently .",
    "the x and y positional accuracy is thus more sensitive to instrumental effects ( systematic errors in particular ) , and better sets the astrometric accuracy of our measurements . the proper motion distribution is plotted in fig .  5 ( left panels ) as a function of magnitude .",
    "sources brighter that f814w=24.0  a total of 634 objects  have mean values @xmath49 millipixels yr@xmath5 with a dispersion @xmath50 millipixels yr@xmath5 .",
    "the low mean values are consistent with these brighter sources being part of the astrometric reference grid ( of which they are a subset ) .",
    "the dispersion values yield an estimate of the intrinsic uncertainty in the proper motion measurement for individual point sources , which is thus on the order of @xmath51 pixels yr@xmath5 along both lines ( x ) and columns ( y ) on the wfpc2 frames .",
    "the fact that the scatter values are very nearly identical in x and y suggests that charge transfer efficiency ( cte ) effects are negligible in this context , otherwise one would expect a larger scatter in the proper motion along the columns ( y ) .",
    "sources fainter that f814w=24.0  2,593 sources  have mean proper motion values @xmath52 millipixels yr@xmath5 with a dispersion @xmath53 millipixels yr@xmath5 .",
    "the astrometric errors are thus a factor 2.5 larger than for the brighter sources ; the scatter is also observed to increase as the magnitudes get fainter .    to further examine possible cte effects ,",
    "we plot @xmath47 a a function of @xmath54 and @xmath48 as a function of @xmath55 ( fig .  5 , right panels ) .",
    "cte effects yield systematic offsets between the centroid of bright and faint sources at large @xmath55 .",
    "degradation of cte over time would increase this offset in the later epochs , resulting in an apparent proper motion @xmath48 of the faint sources relative to bright ones . in fig .  5 , we plot @xmath47,@xmath48 as individual points for the bright sources ( f814w@xmath4624.0 ) , and plot the mean proper motions @xmath56 for the faint sources , in 7 bins along the x and y positions ( broken lines ) .",
    "for the faint sources , the dispersion @xmath57 is noted for each bin with errobars .",
    "we observe that the bright sources do not show any systemic offset in their proper motion as a function of x or y , except for perhaps a weak increase in @xmath48 for @xmath58 .",
    "the faint sources have their mean proper motions @xmath56 within 3@xmath59 of 0.0 for all x and y ; there is , however , a weak trend of @xmath60 increasing with x , and @xmath61 increasing with y , which could possibly be due to cte effects .",
    "however , the extra - galactic objects are also bright sources , and we expect them to behave more like the bright stars , which show negligible cte effects , if any .    the 17 extra - galactic ( resolved ) sources have mean motion values @xmath62 millipixels yr@xmath5 with a dispersion @xmath63 millipixels yr@xmath5 .",
    "their scatter is thus significantly larger than that of the stellar ( resolved ) sources .",
    "additionally the scatter appears to be larger in y , though this may be due to small number statistics . in any case",
    ", the scatter in the motions is clearly larger for the extragalactic sources by a factor of about 3 .",
    "part of this scatter could be due to a net relative proper motion of the extra - galactic sources : this is because the wf2 , wf3 , and wf4 frames have their xy grids rotated by 90 degrees ; a net offset in ( @xmath0,@xmath64 ) would result in a scatter in ( @xmath65,@xmath66 ) , since the sources come from different frames .",
    "indeed , the opposite should be true for systematic offsets in ( @xmath65,@xmath66 ) , which would conspire to yield a large scatter in ( @xmath0,@xmath64 ) ; see below . beside the possibility of a net proper motion ,",
    "the larger scatter in the extra - galactic sources could simply be due to their resolved nature .",
    "the epsf would not be the best model for those sources , which would result in larger astrometric errors .",
    "individual epsf profiles , tailor - made for each source , would yield more accurate results as suggested by @xcite ; however such models require large numbers of sampling ( @xmath67 ) of _ each object individually _ , whereas the epsf of point sources is built from the sample of all of the point sources on the image , requiring fewer exposure frames .",
    "our current dataset does not contain nearly enough frames of leo - ii to build such individual epsf profiles .",
    "reported in the equatorial frame , the stellar sources in leo  ii with f814w@xmath4624 mag have mean proper motion ( @xmath68,@xmath69)=(-2.7,-7.8 ) @xmath4as yr@xmath5 with a dispersion ( @xmath70,@xmath71)=(271.9,297.2 ) @xmath4as yr@xmath5 .",
    "the dispersion yields an estimate of the accuracy in the proper motion of invidual sources , while the near - zero value of the mean proper motion confirms the stability of our astrometric reference frame .",
    "the distribution of proper motions for these unresolved sources is shown in fig.6 ( dots ) .",
    "the proper motion distribution of our 17 selected extra - galactic sources is also plotted in fig.6 , where we also plot the estimated internal uncertainties in the proper motion estimates for each individual source ( errorbars ) .",
    "the unweighted mean value is ( @xmath72,@xmath73)=(@xmath7431.9,@xmath7425.9 ) @xmath4as yr@xmath5 and the points have a dispersion ( @xmath70,@xmath71)=(790.5,683.9 ) @xmath4as yr@xmath5 .",
    "since one pixel on the wf cameras is @xmath75mas , a 700@xmath4as yr@xmath5 motion is equivalent to 7 millipixels yr@xmath5 .",
    "hence the scatter in ( @xmath0,@xmath64 ) is comparable to the scatter in ( @xmath65,@xmath66 ) .",
    "however , the scatter in the data points is significantly larger than the estimated statistical uncertainties of the individual points , which are @xmath76 @xmath4as yr@xmath5 on average .",
    "this indicates that the proper motion of the extra - galactic sources suffers from systematic errors , which are probably due to the sources being resolved and the local epsf a marginal fit to their profile .",
    "the dispersion in the data points suggests that the uncertainties on individual measurements are underestimate by a factor @xmath77 .",
    "we account for these systematic errors by increasing the uncertainties of the individual proper motions by the same factor .",
    "we then estimate the systemic proper motion of the extragalactic sources by calculating their weighted average .",
    "we find the systemic proper motion to be ( @xmath68,@xmath69)=(@xmath43104@xmath3113,+33@xmath3151 ) @xmath4as yr@xmath5 , where the quoted errors are the 1-@xmath59 uncertainties . the 1-@xmath59 , 2-@xmath59 , and 3-@xmath59 limits are plotted as ellipses in fig.6 .",
    "the proper motion of leo  ii in the extra - galactic frame is the opposite of this vector .",
    "we therefore estimate that leo  ii has an absolute proper motion ( @xmath68,@xmath69)=(@xmath74104@xmath3113,@xmath4333@xmath3151 ) @xmath4as yr@xmath5 , which is the proper motion as observed from the heliocentric rest frame .",
    "if leo  ii had no net motion in the plane of the sky , we would expect the dwarf spheroidal to have a net proper motion due to the reflex motion of the sun in the galactic rest frame ; based on the distance to leo  ii , this reflex motion is predicted to yield a relative proper motion ( @xmath0,@xmath64)@xmath78=(+80,+186 ) @xmath4as yr@xmath5 .",
    "this value is denoted by the crosshairs in fig.6 , and must be accounted for in calculating the orbital motion of leo  ii . adding up this component due to the reflex motion of the sun yields for leo  ii a proper motion ( @xmath79,@xmath80)=(@xmath81 , @xmath82 )",
    "@xmath4as yr@xmath5 in the _ galactic rest frame_. this indicates that the transverse motion of leo  ii is detected at the 2-@xmath59 confidence level .",
    "to evaluate the space motion of leo  ii and , in particular , to constrain the parameters of its orbit , it is useful to report the position and motion of leo  ii in a reference frame centered on , and at rest with respect to , the galactic center .",
    "the most straightforward method is to start with the angular position ( @xmath83 ) and proper motion ( @xmath84 ) in the galactic coordinate system , and include both the measured distance from the sun ( @xmath85 kpc ) and heliocentric radial velocity ( @xmath86 km s@xmath5 ) of leo  ii .",
    "the position ( @xmath87 ) and motion ( @xmath88 ) in this spherical , right - handed coordinate system have a sun - centered , cartesian equivalent ( @xmath89 ) and ( @xmath90 ) defined as : @xmath91 with x , y , and z expressed in kpc , and u , v , w expressed in km s@xmath5 .    here",
    "we recalculate the angular position and distance of leo  ii in a galactic coordinate system defined by a cartesian set ( @xmath92 ) and ( @xmath93 ) such that the system has its origin at the galactic center and , by definition , is also at rest with respect to the galactic center .",
    "positions and motions can be transformed to this system from the sun - centered positions and motions following : @xmath94 where we have adopted the galactocentric distance of 7.94 kpc for the sun from @xcite , a relative motion of the sun to the local standard of rest ( u@xmath13,v@xmath13,w@xmath13)=(+10.00 , + 5.25 , + 7.17 ) km s@xmath5 @xcite , and a galactic rotation velocity of 225 km s@xmath5 at the solar vicinity . in this system , we calculate for leo  ii a position ( @xmath92)@xmath35(@xmath4376.8 , @xmath4358.2 , 214.8 ) kpc .",
    "we convert the motion into this galactic reference frame , using a monte carlo simulation to evalutate the range of uncertainties , and find ( @xmath93)=(100.8@xmath3126.6 , 216.0@xmath3156.9 , 118.1@xmath349.3 ) km s@xmath5 , for a total galactocentric space velocity of @xmath95128.7 km s@xmath5 .",
    "this galactocentric cartesian system also has an associated spherical coordinate system ( @xmath96 ) and ( @xmath97 ) , which are related to the cartesian system ( @xmath92 ) and ( @xmath93 ) with the same relationships as in eqs .",
    "38 . in this system",
    ", we calculate that leo  ii is located at ( @xmath96)@xmath35(235.5 kpc , 217.132@xmath98 , + 65.839@xmath98 ) .",
    "its galactocentric radial velocity and proper motion is ( @xmath99 ) = ( 21.5@xmath34.3 km s@xmath5 , @xmath4399.8@xmath3147.8@xmath4as yr@xmath5 , 215.6@xmath3112.8@xmath4as yr@xmath5 ) .",
    "this proper motion yields a total transverse velocity @xmath10=265.2@xmath3129.4 km s@xmath5 , a large value compared to the estimated radial motion @xmath100=21.5@xmath34.3 km s@xmath5 .",
    "this yields a mostly tangential space velocity , from which we infer that leo  ii either has a low - eccentricity orbit , or is currently close to perigalacticon or apogalacticon distance . with these kinematic components at hand we integrated its orbit for a variety of galactic potentials , where the integration was carried out 14 gyr backwards and forward in time .",
    "all potentials used for our test cases have disk and bulge components ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which , however , do not contribute significantly to the potential given the large distance ( in particular its large height above the disk ) of the dsph .",
    "more importantly , this large distance renders remote satellites like leo  ii important tracers of the galactic halo and its total mass distribution @xcite .",
    "this is already obvious from plotting the escape velocity of such models at the position of leo  ii ( fig .  7 ) .    .",
    "both under exclusion ( triangle ) or inclusion ( cross ) of our proper motion measurement it appears likely that leo  ii is bound to the mw _ at present_. also shown are the 1 , 2 , and 3@xmath59- contours ) . ]    in this figure , we show the best - fit scale - free potential from @xcite with its total mass of @xmath101 that has been established using tracer satellites out to larger distances of @xmath15300 kpc , but we note that the same arguments hold for the various ( dark ) mw halo models found in the literature to date ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . even if our proper motion measurements were significantly in error and assuming that only the radial velocity component contributed reliably , leo  ii s space velocity of v@xmath102 kms@xmath5 is still high and similar to the value we obtain from using the full kinematic information",
    "thus , it is the large distance and radial velocity which govern its derived dynamics .",
    "the comparison in fig  7 implies that leo  ii is a true , bound satellite to the mw : the local escape velocity exceeds the space velocity of leo  ii by 1.0@xmath59 .",
    "we note , however , that the concept of `` escape velocity '' for the present arguments should be taken with caution , since its definition commonly neglects all mass _ outside _ of the considered radius .",
    "moreover , recent evidence suggests that the rotation velocity of the milky way may be larger than used in the present work and all current galactic potential models , at @xmath103 kms@xmath5 @xcite .",
    "we will address these issues in a future work dealing with the implications of leo ii s boundedness for current mw mass models ( koch et al . in prep . ) .    in fig .",
    "8 we show the orbital solution based on the aforementioned integrations and our fiducial proper motion measurements . while currently formally `` bound '' to the mw potential , it is evident that leo  ii has come a long way over its recent past .",
    "currently at pericenter , its `` orbital '' period implied from the calculations is 50 gyr and , rather than an apocenter , it reaches its largest distance from the mw at the limits of our integrations , at @xmath151.8 mpc . considering these time scales and large distances from the actual galactic potential , any timing argument and orbital solution becomes necessarily unreliable and one would need to account for the entire dynamical history of the local group .",
    "( 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 ) gyr ( small points ) . ]    in order to better understand leo  ii s orbital characteristics , we recomputed its parameters in a monte carlo sense by varying position , velocity , and proper motion within their uncertainties . as a result , we find periods shorter than 6.5 ( 9.1 , 11.6 ) gyr in only 5% ( 10% , 15% ) of the realizations . likewise ,",
    "in only 4% ( 6% , 12% ) of the cases can we reproduce pericenters within 100 ( 150 , 200 ) kpc , thus bringing leo  ii into the realm of the majority of the mw s closer , bound satellites @xcite .",
    "therefore , we conclude that this dsph is rather an isolated local group satellite that is falling into the mw regions and passing its ( dark ) halo for the first time ( e.g. , chapman et al . 2007 ;",
    "majewski et al . 2007 ) .",
    "in fact , interactions or common origins of dynamical interlopers like leo  ii with other local group systems appears plausible @xcite .",
    "our astrometric analysis provides the first - time detection of a proper motion for the dwarf satellite galaxy leo  ii .",
    "the transverse motion of leo  ii is detected , but only after accounting for the solar reflex motion .",
    "the question of its origin and whether or not leo  ii is a bound satellite has important implications for our understanding of the infall and merging of cosmological subhalos and the dynamics and structure of the local group . on the other hand , watkins et al .",
    "( 2010 ; their fig .  5 ) estimate that the cumulative contribution of leo  ii to the mass budget of the mw is typically less than 8% ( thus @xmath104 ) . removing it from the family of bound mw satellite tracers would thus only have a minor impact .",
    "we can compare the idea that leo  ii spent most of its life in seclusion from the mw to the properties of other isolated local group dsphs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite and @xcite find evidence of star formation as recent as 2 gyr ago , which is comparable to another , remote mw dsph , leo  i @xcite .",
    "tucana ( at 900 kpc ) and cetus ( 775 kpc from the mw ) are associated with neither m31 nor the mw and neither of them shows any evidence of past or present interactions with these massive galaxies . despite the lack of any obvious , dynamic gas removing agents at those large distances , none of these dsphs contains any gas ; in particular tucana appears to have had no active star formation over the past 810 gyr .",
    "this may imply that galaxies like leo  ii had experienced efficient galactic winds , which is also consistent with its flat age - metallicity relation during the first seven or so gyr after the big bang @xcite .",
