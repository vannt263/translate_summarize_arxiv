    "the study of the in - medium properties of anti - kaon ( @xmath1 ) has attracted continuous attention  @xcite .",
    "@xmath1 has been theoretically expected to be bound by nuclear systems due to attractive strong interaction between @xmath1 and nucleon @xmath11  @xcite .",
    "these @xmath1-nuclear bound systems assisted mainly by the strong interaction , which are so - called kaonic nuclei , have at least two important aspects ; the kaonic nuclei are strongly interacting exotic many - body systems , and they provide favorable sysmets for the studies of the @xmath1 properties at finite density .",
    "however , in spite of experimental efforts to search for the @xmath1-nuclear bound systems  @xcite , there are no clear evidences observed yet .    in order to understand the @xmath1-nucleus systems ,",
    "it is important to investigate theoretically the decay mechanism of the kaonic nuclei , or the absorption process of the @xmath1 into nuclei .",
    "especially the decay ( absorption ) ratios of various modes and explicit numbers of the decay ( absorption ) widths are key quantities for the @xmath1-nucleus systems .",
    "the decay of the kaonic nuclei in strong interactions can be categorized into two processes ; one is the mesonic process such as @xmath12 , and the other is the non - mesonic process such as @xmath13 , where @xmath14 denotes hyperon ( @xmath15 or @xmath16 ) .",
    "the non - mesonic decays have advantage in experimental observations , since signals from kaonic nuclei are readily distinguished from backgrounds and no extra mesons do not have to be detected . therefore ,",
    "systematic studies of the non - mesonic decay of the kaonic nuclei are desirable",
    ". especially the ratios of the decay widths are interesting , since they will be insensitive to details of the production mechanism .",
    "the absorption of the @xmath1 in nuclei may take place dominantly through the @xmath10 ( @xmath4 ) resonance , owning to the presence of the @xmath4 just below the @xmath17 threshold .",
    "namely the @xmath4 can be a doorway of the @xmath1 absorptions in nuclei .",
    "the @xmath4 doorway picture is more probable , in case that the @xmath4 is a quasi - bound state of @xmath17  @xcite , which has large @xmath17 components as almost real particles .",
    "therefore the strong @xmath17 correlations are expected to be responsible for the @xmath4-induced decays of the @xmath1 in nuclei .",
    "motivated by the @xmath4 doorway picture , we study the non - mesonic transition of @xmath18 ( @xmath19 and @xmath20 ) in uniform nuclear matter with a one - meson exchange approach .",
    "now let us define the transition rate of the @xmath22 process by the transition probability divided by time @xmath23 as , _ yn _",

    "d_2 |t_yn|^2 ( 2 ) ^4 ^4 ( p _ + p _ - p_n - p_y ) , [ eq : transition - rate ] with the @xmath24-matrix @xmath24 for the transition process given by the transition amplitudes @xmath25 as @xmath26 .",
    "@xmath27 is volume of the system , and @xmath28 is the phase - space for the final state .",
    "the transition rate depends on the center - of - mass energy @xmath29 , equivalently the initial nucleon momentum . summing up the @xmath22 transition rate in terms of the initial nucleon states",
    ", we can estimate the non - mesonic decay width of the @xmath4 in nuclear medium as a function of the nucleon density .",
    "the factor @xmath30 in the last form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : transition - rate ] ) is responsible for the fact that only one @xmath11 exists in the initial state in the volume @xmath27 .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     fixing the ratios of the @xmath4 coupling constants , @xmath31 , we plot the ratio of the non - mesonic decay widths of the in - medium @xmath1 to @xmath7 and @xmath32 as a function of the proton ( or neutron ) density in fig .  [",
    "fig : gvsrho](a ) .",
    "this figure shows that the ratio of the non - mesonic decay widths @xmath33 is around @xmath34 almost independently of the nucleon density .",
    "the density independence of the ratio of the decay widths is caused by sufficiently large phase - space in the final states .",
    "we also obtain the absolute values of the non - mesonic decay widths of the @xmath4 in nuclear matter .",
    "we use the couping constants of the @xmath4 to @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath35 obtained by the chiral unitary approach , which gives the in - vacuum mesonic decay as @xmath36 with @xmath37 as observed in a @xmath38 initiated channel  @xcite .",
    "we show the non - mesonic decay widths in fig .",
    "[ fig : gvsrho](b ) .",
    "the linear dependence of the decay widths is caused by the large phase - space in the final states . at the normal nuclear density ( @xmath39 ) ,",
    "the total non - mesonic decay width is @xmath40 , which is almost half of the mesonic decay width of @xmath4 ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "we have investigated the non - mesonic transition @xmath42 in nuclear medium as one of the essential processes for the non - mesonic absorption of @xmath1 in nucleus . calculating the @xmath18 transition rates in the one - meson exchange processes",
    ", we have found that the ratio of the @xmath43 transition rates to @xmath7 and @xmath44 strongly depends on the ratio of the @xmath4 couplings , @xmath45 . especially , larger @xmath4 couplings to @xmath17 lead to enhancement of the non - mesonic @xmath4 decay with @xmath7 emission .",
    "furthermore , describing the @xmath4 properties by the chiral unitary approach , we have obtained the ratio of the non - mesonic decay widths to @xmath7 and @xmath46 as @xmath47 almost independently of the nucleon density .",
    "we have also estimated that the total non - mesonic decay width is @xmath40 at the saturation density .",
