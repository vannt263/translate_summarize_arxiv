    "it was conjectured and later proved in @xcite and then in @xcite that there is no indecomposable quandle of size @xmath239 for @xmath583 . in particular",
    ", this implies that the lattice with one top and one bottom element and an antichain of @xmath239 incomparable elements in between is not the subrack lattice of a quandle .",
