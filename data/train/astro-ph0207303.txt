    "recent progress in deep optical imaging with 8 - 10 m class telescopes has enabled new searches for star - forming galaxies beyond redshift 5 . in particular , imaging surveys using narrow - passband filters have proved to be a particularly efficient way to find such galaxies ( hu & mcmahon 1996 ; cowie & hu 1998 ; steidel et al . 2000 ; kudritzki et al .",
    "2000 ; hu et al .",
    "indeed the most distant ly@xmath0 emitter known to date is hcm 6a at @xmath6 ( hu et al .",
    "2002 ) , and more than a dozen ly@xmath0 emitters beyond @xmath7 have been discovered ( dey et al .",
    "1998 ; spinrad et al .",
    "1998 ; weymann et al .",
    "1998 ; hu et al . 1998 , 1999 , 2002 ; dawson et al . 2001 , 2002 ; ellis et al . 2001 ) , most by using this technique .",
    "one interesting object is j123649.2 + 621539 at @xmath8 which was found serendipitously in the hdf - north flanking fields ( dawson et al .",
    "its ly@xmath0 emission - line profile shows a sharp blue cutoff and broad red wing emission , both of which are often observed in star - forming systems with prominent wind outflows .",
    "these features are also expected from radiative transfer in an expanding envelope",
    ". therefore , dawson et al . (",
    "2002 ) suggested that the ly@xmath0 profile of j123649.2 + 621539 is consistent with a superwind with a velocity of @xmath9 300 km s@xmath5 .",
    "galactic superwinds are now considered to be one of the key issues for understanding the interaction and evolution of both galaxies and intergalactic matter ( e.g. heckman 1999 ; taniguchi & shioya 2000 ) . in order to improve our knowledge of galactic superwinds at high redshift , a large sample of superwind candidates at @xmath10 is needed . during the course of our new search for ly@xmath0 emitters at @xmath1",

    "we have carried out a very deep optical imaging survey for faint ly@xmath0 emitters in the field surrounding the quasar sdssp j104433.04@xmath16012502.2 at redshift 5.74 ( fan et al .",
    "2000 ) . since , however , the subsequent optical spectroscopic observations suggested a bit lower redshift ; @xmath17 ( djorgovski et al . 2001 ) and @xmath18 ( goodrich et al . 2001 ) , we adopt @xmath2 in this letter . ]",

    "suprime - cam consists of ten 2k@xmath194k ccd chips and provides a very wide field of view  @xmath20 ( 0.2 arcsec pixel@xmath5 ) . in this survey",
    ", we used the narrow - passband filter , nb816 , centered on 8160    with a passband of @xmath21  ; the central wavelength corresponds to a redshift of 5.72 for ly@xmath0 emission .",
    "we also used broad - passband filters , b , r@xmath22 , i@xmath23 , and z@xmath24 .",
    "a summary of the imaging observations is given in table 1 .",
    "all observations were done under photometric conditions , and the seeing was between 0@xmath257 and 1@xmath253 arcsec during the entire run .",
    "photometric and spectrophotometric standard stars used in the flux calibration are sa101 for the @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 data , and gd 50 , gd 108 ( oke 1990 ) , and pg 1034 + 001 ( massey et al .",

    "the @xmath29 data were calibrated by using the magnitude of sdssp j104433.04@xmath16012502.2 ( fan et al .",
    "2000 ) ; since any quasar is a potentially variable object , the photometric calibration of the @xmath29 data may be more unreliable than those of the other - band data .    to avoid delays in obtaining follow - up spectroscopy",
    ", we analyzed only two of the ccd chips , one of which included the quasar sdssp j104433.04 - 012502.2 .",
    "the individual ccd data were reduced and combined using iraf and the mosaic - ccd data reduction software developed by yagi et al .",
    "the total size of the reduced subfield is @xmath30 , corresponding to a total solid angle of @xmath31 136 arcmin@xmath32 .",

    "the sky position of lae j1044@xmath160130 is shown in fig .",

    "the nb816 image reveals that lae j1044@xmath160130 is spatially extended .",
    "it is interesting to note that this object shows not a circular shape but an irregular shape .",
    "the angular diameter is 2.3 arcsec ( above the 2@xmath39 noise level ) .",
    "the size of the point spread function in the nb816 image is 0.90 arcsec . correcting for this spread",
    ", we obtain an angular diameter of 2.1 arcsec for the object . in the cosmology adopted here",
    ", this corresponds to a diameter of @xmath49 kpc .",
    "in order to investigate the nature of lae j1044@xmath160130 , we obtained optical spectroscopy .",
    "first , we used the subaru faint object camera and spectrograph ( focas ; kashikawa et al .",
    "2000 ) with the lowest spectral resolution grism , 150 lines mm@xmath5 , blazed at @xmath50=6500    together with an order - cut filter sy47 on 2002 , march 11 ( ut ) .",
    "the wavelength coverage was @xmath9 4900    to 9400  .",
    "the use of an 0.8 arcsec - wide slit gave a spectroscopic resolution of @xmath51 at 8000  .",
    "the total integration time was 1800 seconds .",
    "the spectrum is shown in the upper panel of fig .",
    "we detected a single emission line at @xmath52 8130  .",
    "this observation was done under photometric conditions , and we used the spectroscopic standard star , feige 34 ( massey et al . 1988 ) to calibrate the spectrum .",
    "the emission line flux was calculated to be @xmath53 ergs s@xmath5 @xmath54 .",
    "a second spectrum with focas was obtained on 2002 , march 13 ( ut ) in non - photometric conditions .",
    "this time , we used the 300 lines mm@xmath5 grating blazed at 7500    together with the same order cut filter sy47 , giving a spectral resolution @xmath55 with the same 0.8 arcsec - wide slit .",
    "this setting gave the same wavelength coverage as the lower resolution observation .",
    "again the total integration time was 1800 seconds .",
    "the spectrum is shown in the lower panel of fig .",
    "the emission - line profile marginally shows the sharp cutoff at wavelengths shortward of the line peak .",
    "however , the spectral resolution is insufficient to confirm this feature .    to clarify the shape of the line profile seen in the focas observations , additional observations were obtained with keck / echelle spectrograph and imager ( esi ; sheinis et al .",
    "2000 ) in echellette mode using a 1@xmath56 slit , which provided a spectral resolution of @xmath57 at @xmath50=8000  .",
    "two 1800-second integrations were obtained in photometric conditions on 2002 , march 15 ( ut ) .",
    "the spectra were calibrated using the spectroscopic standard stars feige 34 and hz 44 ( massey et al . 1988 ) . the combined spectrum is shown in the middle panel of fig .",
    "only one emission line , at @xmath58   is found in the esi optical spectrum , which covers the wavelength range 4000   to 9500  .",
    "the emission - line profile at 8130   is confirmed to slightly asymmetric , showing a cutoff at wavelengths shortward of the line peak .",
    "although a single emission line in the wavelength range 4000   to 9500   may alternatively be identified as [ o ii]@xmath503727 , the fact that the observed profile appears to be skewed suggests that this line is in fact ly@xmath0 emission ( e.g. stern et al .",
    "2000 ; dawson et al .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the emission line at 8129.3@xmath593.0 must be ly@xmath0 , which then yields a redshift of 5.687@xmath590.002 . the rest - frame equivalent width of the putative ly@xmath0 emission is estimated to be @xmath60  .",
    "the observed ly@xmath0 flux is @xmath61 ergs @xmath54 s@xmath5 .",
    "this appears consistent with our focas observations made on 2002 , march 11 .",
    "the observed ly@xmath0 flux is @xmath62(ly@xmath0 ) = @xmath63 ergs @xmath54 s@xmath5 based on the esi spectrum .",
    "given the cosmology adopted in this _",
    "letter _ , we obtain an absolute ly@xmath0 luminosity of @xmath64(ly@xmath0 ) @xmath65 ergs s@xmath5 .",
    "this ly@xmath0 luminosity is comparable to those of other @xmath66 galaxies ; 1 ) @xmath67 ergs s@xmath5 for hcm 6a at @xmath6 ( hu et al .",
    "2002 ) , 2 ) @xmath68 ergs s@xmath5 for ssa22-hcm1 at @xmath2 ( hu et al .",
    "1999 ) , 3 ) @xmath69 ergs s@xmath5 for hdf 4 - 473.0 at @xmath70 ( weymann et al . 1998 ) , and 4 ) @xmath71 ergs s@xmath5 for j123649.2 + 621539.5 at @xmath72 ( dawson et al .",
    "note that all the above luminosities are estimated by using the same cosmology as that used here .",
    "we note that approximately half of the intrinsic ly@xmath0 emission from lae j1044 - 0130 could be absorbed by intergalactic atomic hydrogen ( e.g. , dawson et al .",
    "2002 ) . in order to reproduce the observed ly@xmath0 emission - line profile a two - component profile fit",
    "was made using the following assumptions :  1 ) the intrinsic ly@xmath0 emission line profile is gaussian , and 2 ) the optical depth of the ly@xmath0 absorption increases with decreasing wavelength shortward of the rest - frame ly@xmath0 peak .",
    "the resulting fit is shown in figure 4 ( thick curve ) , which corresponds to the following emission and absorption line parameters  1 ) ly@xmath0 emission : the line center , @xmath73  , the line flux , @xmath74 ergs s@xmath5 @xmath54 , and the line width , @xmath75 km s@xmath5 ; 2 ) ly@xmath0 absorption : the line center , @xmath76  , the optical depth at the absorption center , @xmath77 , and the line width , @xmath78 km s@xmath5 .",
    "this analysis suggests that the total ly@xmath0 emission - line flux amounts to @xmath79 ergs s@xmath5 @xmath54 . this is larger by a factor of 1.16 than the observed flux , giving a total ly@xmath0 luminosity of @xmath64(ly@xmath0 ) @xmath80 ergs s@xmath5 .",
    "we then estimate the star formation rate of lae j1044@xmath160130 . using the relation @xmath81 ( kennicutt 1998 ; brocklehurst 1971 ) and the total ly@xmath0 luminosity",
    ", we obtain @xmath82 yr@xmath5 .",
    "note that @xmath83 may be overestimated because part of the ly@xmath0 emission may arise from shock - heated gas if the superwind interpretation is applicable to this object .",
    "although the signal - to - noise ratio of our esi spectrum is not high enough to analyze the profile shape in great detail , the presence of the excess red - wing emission seems secure ( fig .",
    "the fwhm of the ly@xmath0 emission is measured to be 340@xmath59110 km s@xmath5 and the full width at zero intensity ( fwzi ) is estimated to be 890@xmath59110 km s@xmath5 .",
    "these properties are similar to those of the ly@xmath0 emitter at @xmath8 , j123649.2 + 621539 , found by dawson et al .",
