    "the standard model of electroweak interactions ( sm ) is not able to give a satisfactory explanation to family repetition and to the complex pattern of the fermion masses .",
    "one expects a substantial improvement in the understanding of these problems when considering an underlying fermionic substructure where the usual fermions share some constituents ( preons ) @xcite . in this sense , the sm would be just the low - energy limit of a more fundamental theory , being valid only at energies below the compositeness mass scale @xmath1 .",
    "one of the most unambiguous predictions of the composite models is the existence of an excited lepton state for each known lepton .",
    "unfortunately , we do not yet have a satisfactory model that could reproduce the whole family spectrum . in view of the lack of a unique predictive theory",
    ", a model - independent phenomenological analysis of the effects of fermion compositeness seems the most appealing approach . on this ground",
    ", we can employ the effective lagrangian techniques to describe the physics of these excited states below the compositeness scale .",
    "this approach has been employed in several phenomenological studies that analysed the expected signatures of these excited fermions in @xmath2 @xcite , @xmath3 @xcite , and @xmath4 @xcite collisions at high energies . on the experimental side ,",

    "the experiments at the desy @xmath4 collider hera also searched for resonances in the @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 systems @xcite ; however the lep bounds on excited leptons couplings are about one order of magnitude more stringent in the mass region below the @xmath0 mass .    in spite of the failure of all the direct searches for compositeness",
    ", we could expect that the next generation of accelerators , working at higher centre - of - mass energies , would be able to obtain a direct evidence of the existence of these composite states . on the other hand , an important source of indirect information about new particles and interactions is the precise measurement of the electroweak parameters done at lep .",
    "virtual effects of these new states can alter the sm predictions for some of these parameters and the comparison with the experimental data can impose bounds on their masses and couplings .    in this work",
    "we investigate the one - loop effects of excited leptons in the observables measured on the @xmath0 peak at lep . using an effective lagrangian in terms of dimension five operators to describe the couplings of the excited leptons , we compute their contribution to both oblique and vertex corrections to the electroweak parameters .",

    "the most recent lep results @xcite , assuming lepton universality , are @xmath165 mev and for the invisible width @xmath166 mev .",
    "therefore , at @xmath167 c.l . , we should have @xmath168 mev , and @xmath169 mev .",
    "we plot in figures [ fig:4 ] and [ fig:5 ] the values of @xmath170 and @xmath171 attainable in this phenomenological model for some values of the compositeness scale and excited lepton masses , assuming different configurations of the weight factors @xmath172 , and @xmath173 .",
    "our numerical results show that the most restrictive bound on the excited fermion mass and compositeness scale comes from the comparison of @xmath174 with the lep data for this observable .",
    "let us compare our bounds coming from @xmath174 with the ones emerging from the direct search for the excited leptons .",
    "first of all , we should point out that the direct search at lep was just able to reach excited fermion masses up to 130 gev @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the hera collaborations @xcite , looking for states that decay into a gauge boson and a usual fermion in the reaction @xmath175 , can access masses up to 250 gev .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] , we present the excluded region , at @xmath167 c.l . , in the @xmath1 versus @xmath76 plane imposed by @xmath176 , for @xmath177 .",
    "we have further assumed that @xmath178 , leading to the excluded region represented by the shadowed triangle . for comparison , we also present the region excluded by the zeus data @xcite ( below and left of the dashed curve ) , for @xmath179 . since we have assumed that @xmath180 , this curve represents an upper limit for the zeus bound . as we can see",
    ", we were able to exclude just a small region beyond the available limit .",
    "we also show our results when we relax the condition of @xmath178 . in the latter case",
    ", our analysis excludes all excited lepton masses with scales @xmath181 gev .    in principle",
    ", compositeness may not only generate these operators involving excited leptons which contribute to vector boson self energies and vertices at one - loop level , but it may also generate effective operators which could give tree - level contributions which we did not consider .",
    "cancellations could then be possible between tree - level and one - loop contributions and the bounds derived here would not be applied .",
    "we assumed that it is unnatural that large cancellations occur between the tree - level and the one - loop contributions in the observables measured at @xmath182 scale @xcite .    in conclusion",
    ", we have evaluated the contribution of excited lepton states , up to the one - loop level , to the oblique variables and also to the @xmath0 width to leptons .",
    "we have compared our results with the precise data on the electroweak observables obtained by the lep collaborations in order to extract bounds on some of the free parameters ( compositeness scale and excited lepton mass ) of the phenomenological model under consideration .",
    "we also compared our results with the recent bounds obtained through the direct search for these particles .",
    "our results show that the present precision in the electroweak parameters attained by lep is very marginally able to constrain the parameters @xmath1 and @xmath76 beyond the present limits from direct searches .",
