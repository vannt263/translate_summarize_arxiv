    "over the past decade there has been enormous interest in reaction - diffusion systems ( see [ 112 ] and references therein ) , with particular emphasis on the effects of fluctuations in low spatial dimensions .",
    "most attention has been paid to reactions of the form @xmath0 and @xmath2 with a variety of different initial / boundary conditions . at or below an upper critical dimension @xmath5 , these systems exhibit fluctuation induced anomalous kinetics , and the straightforward application of traditional approaches , such as mean field rate equations , breaks down .",
    "attempts to understand the role played by fluctuations for @xmath6 have involved several techniques , including smoluchowski type approximations @xcite and field theoretic methods @xcite . in this paper",
    "we set out to study these fluctuation effects in a system with three competing reactions : @xmath7 the reactions are irreversible , and we choose homogeneous , though not necessarily equal , initial densities for the two species at @xmath8 .",
    "our goal is to calculate density decay exponents and amplitudes , taking into account fluctuation effects . in pursuit of this aim ,",
    "we analyse the system using both the smoluchowski approximation and the field theory approach , and we show that the two methods are closely related . however , whereas it is unclear how the smoluchowski approach may be improved , the field theory provides a systematic way to obtain successively more accurate values for the asymptotic density decay exponents and amplitudes .",
    "we shall concentrate on situations where one of the two species is greatly in the majority ( as is almost always the case asymptotically ) - so , for example , if the a species is predominant , then we can safely neglect the reaction @xmath1 .",
    "this kind of assumption will lead to a considerable simplification in our analysis .",
    "previous work on this problem includes use of the smoluchowski approximation @xcite , as well as exact @xmath9 results obtained by derrida _",
    "@xcite for the special case of _ immobile _ minority particles",
    ". derrida _",
    "were , in fact , studying a different problem , namely the probability that a given spin has never flipped in the zero temperature glauber dynamics of the q - state potts model in one dimension . by solving that model exactly @xcite",
    "they showed that this probability decreased as a power law : @xmath10 for the ising ( @xmath11 ) case .",
    "however , in one dimension , the ising spin flip problem and the decay rate for the immobile impurity in our reaction - diffusion system are exactly equivalent problems , and hence this exact decay rate also holds in our case .",
    "we also mention one other previous result for the immobile impurity problem , due to cardy @xcite . using renormalisation group methods similar to those employed in this paper",
    ", it was shown that the density of the minority species decays away as a universal power law : @xmath12 for @xmath4 , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the case where the _ majority _ species is immobile has also been solved ( see @xcite ) . in this case",
    "the decay rate for the minority species is dominated by minority impurity particles existing in regions where there happen to be very few of the majority particles .",
    "since these majority particles are strictly stationary , this situation is not describable using a rate equation approach , and it turns out that the minority species decays away as @xmath15 , a result which is not accessible by perturbative methods .    in this paper , using a field theory formalism and techniques from the renormalisation group , we will obtain decay rates and amplitudes for the general case of arbitrary diffusivities - a regime previously only accessible using the smoluchowski approximation .",
    "our basic plan is to map the microscopic dynamics , as described by a master equation , onto a quantum field theory . this theory is then renormalised ( for @xmath3 ) , and the couplings ( reaction rates ) are shown to have @xmath16 fixed points , whose values depend only on the ratio of the species diffusion constants .",
    "note that this system ( with irreversible reactions ) is particularly simple in that only the couplings ( and not the diffusivities ) are renormalised .",
    "the next step is to group together feynman diagrams which are of the same order in the renormalised couplings - i.e. diagrams with the same number of loops .",
    "these diagrams are then evaluated and a callan - symanzik equation used to obtain improved asymptotic @xmath17 expansions for the densities . in this fashion ,",
    "quantities of interest may be systematically calculated by successively including higher order sets of diagrams ( with more loops ) in the perturbative sum .",
    "one consequence of the theory is that the asymptotic decay rates and amplitudes for @xmath18 will be independent of the reaction rates - a result which is in accordance with the smoluchowski approach .",
    "in fact , all physical quantities below the upper critical dimension asymptotically depend only on the diffusivities and the initial densities , and in this sense they display universality .",
    "we now present a summary of our results for the density decay rates . in what follows",
    "we define @xmath19 , @xmath20 to be the initial density of a , b particles , and @xmath21 to be the ratio of the diffusion constants .",
    "for @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 ( where @xmath25 is a crossover time derived in section 4 ) , we have ( as in @xcite ) : @xmath26 for the minority species , we find , from the rg improved tree level approximation in the field theory : @xmath27 where @xmath28 these decay exponents are identical with the smoluchowski results . performing a strict @xmath17 expansion on this rg improved tree level result gives an exponent @xmath29 for the immobile impurity case ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "this is in agreement with previous rg calculations by cardy @xcite .",
    "if we now go beyond the tree level calculation by including one loop diagrams , then we obtain an improved value for the exponent @xmath31 using an @xmath17 expansion : @xmath32 \\right.\\right.\\ ] ] @xmath33\\right)\\right]\\right ) + o(\\epsilon^2),\\ ] ] where @xmath34 is the dilogarithmic function @xcite .",
    "this exponent is found to be in good agreement with simulations @xcite and exact results @xcite in @xmath35 .",
    "however , for @xmath36 , the system crosses over to a second regime where @xmath37 .",
    "this situation is similar to the case where we begin with @xmath38 . in that regime , at times @xmath39 , and for @xmath38 , @xmath40 and @xmath4 , we have : @xmath41 for the majority species . using the rg improved tree level result for the minority species , we obtain : @xmath42 with @xmath43 the exponent is again in agreement with the smoluchowski result .",
    "if we attempt to improve this calculation to one loop accuracy , then we obtain : @xmath44 \\right.\\right.\\ ] ] @xmath45\\right)\\right]\\right ) + o(\\epsilon^2).\\ ] ] this exponent is only valid for @xmath46 quite close to unity , and even in this region it may be less accurate than the ( non @xmath17-expanded ) rg improved tree level result given above .",
    "this point will be discussed further in section 4.2 .",
    "we next give results valid for @xmath47 , where we find extra logarithmic factors multiplying the power law decay rates .",
    "treating first the case @xmath48 and @xmath49 , we have , from the rg improved tree level , an initial regime with : @xmath50 @xmath51 however , for @xmath36 , the system again crosses over to a second regime where @xmath52 . in this second regime",
    "the density decay exponents ( though not the amplitudes ) are the same as for the case where we begin with @xmath38 .",
    "in that case we have , for @xmath40 : @xmath53 @xmath54 crossover times for these cases are given in section 4.3 .",
    "we now give a brief description of the layout of this paper . in the next section we analyse the system using the mean field / smoluchowski approach .",
    "we then set up the necessary formalism for our field theory in section 3 , and use it to perturbatively calculate values for the density exponents and amplitudes in section 4 .",
    "finally , we give some conclusions and prospects for future work in section 5 .",
    "the simplest description of a reaction - diffusion process is provided by the mean field rate equations . for the system we are considering with densities @xmath55 and @xmath56 , they take the form : @xmath57 where @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 are the reaction rates , and where we impose initial conditions of the form @xmath61 and @xmath62 . in this approach",
    "we have completely neglected the effects of fluctuations - in other words we have made assumptions of the form @xmath63 etc . , where the angular brackets denote averages over the noise . below the critical dimension , where fluctuations become relevant ,",
    "this sort of approximation will break down .    nevertheless , even at the mean field level , the complete solution set for these rate equations is quite complicated . in what follows",
    "we shall restrict our analysis to the case where @xmath64 .",
    "the solution for this particular parameter set will be required for our later field theoretic analysis .",
    "following @xcite , it is easy to show ( by forming a rate equation for the concentration ratio ) that @xmath65 as @xmath66",
    ". thus if we begin with initial conditions where @xmath23 , we can identify two distinct regimes - an early time regime where @xmath67 and , after a crossover , a late time ( true asymptotic ) regime where @xmath68 . treating the early time regime first",
    ", we find ( after some algebra ) : @xmath69 note that the a particles are decaying away more quickly than the b s , so eventually we crossover to a second regime : @xmath70 alternatively , if we begin with @xmath38 , then we have a single asymptotic regime : @xmath71    however , if we now wish to extend our results at or below the upper critical dimension , we must attempt to include some of the fluctuation effects . the simplest way in which this can be done is to employ the smoluchowski approximation @xcite . the essential idea of this approach is to relate the effective reaction rates @xmath72 to the diffusion constants @xmath73 .",
    "suppose we want to calculate the reaction rate @xmath74 .",
    "we begin by choosing a ( fixed ) a species target `` trap '' , which is surrounded by b particles .",
    "when a b particle approaches within a distance @xmath75 of the target , a reaction is deemed to have occurred .",
    "consequently , the reaction rate may be obtained by solving a diffusion equation with boundary conditions of fixed density as @xmath76 , and absorption at @xmath77 .",
    "the flux of b particles across the @xmath78 dimensional sphere of radius @xmath75 is then proportional to an effective microscopic reaction rate .",
    "if we now generalise to the case where both the a and b species are mobile , then we find ( in dimension @xmath4 and in the large time limit ) : @xmath79 for @xmath47 we obtain logarithmic corrections : @xmath80 the smoluchowski reaction rates for @xmath81 and @xmath82 are obtained in a similar fashion .",
    "note that above @xmath47 the reaction rate approaches a limiting ( constant ) value , and we see that the smoluchowski approach predicts a critical dimension of @xmath83 for this system .",
    "this is simply related to the reentrancy property of random walks in @xmath3 .",
    "it is the inclusion of this effect which accounts for the improvement introduced by the smoluchowski approach .",
    "if we now substitute these modified reaction rates into the rate equations , we can obtain the smoluchowski improved density exponents .",
    "for the case where @xmath84 , we find an initial regime with @xmath85 once again , since the a particles are decaying away faster than the b s , we cross over to a second regime , where ( for @xmath86 ) @xmath87 this second set of exponents is the same as for the case where we begin with @xmath38 and @xmath40 . in this situation",
    "no crossover occurs and the exponents are valid for all asymptotic times .",
    "these exponents can be compared favourably with both simulations @xcite , and exact results @xcite .",
    "for example , the decay rate for an immobile minority impurity is given by smoluchowski to be @xmath88 .",
    "this compares well with the exact decay rate of @xmath89 .",
    "turning to the case @xmath90 and @xmath23 , we obtain , for the initial regime : @xmath91 we again eventually crossover to a second regime , where ( for @xmath86 ) : @xmath92 this second set of exponents is again valid ( for all asymptotic times ) in the case where we begin with @xmath38 and @xmath40 .",
    "note that the smoluchowski approach can also be employed for @xmath93 , where again we will find ( time independent ) reaction rates which depend on the diffusion constants .",
    "however , in the general case , our later field theoretic analysis shows that there is no real justification for this procedure .",
    "one exception to this occurs in the case where we have heterogeneous single species annihilation , as considered in @xcite .",
    "in this situation we have only one fundamental reaction process , but different reaction rates may still arise , for example , by having two or more different particle masses ( and hence two or more different diffusion constants ) . in this case",
    "it is physically reasonable to suppose that the exponents ( which are ratios of reaction rates ) may depend only on the diffusivity ratios , with any other parameters canceling out .",
    "however , in the general case , where the reaction processes are genuinely distinct this will not be the case .",
    "overall , we have seen that the smoluchowski approach is a simple way to incorporate some fluctuation effects into the rate equation approach .",
    "unfortunately , it is not at all clear how these methods may be systematically improved .",
    "it is for this reason that we turn to the main purpose of this paper - the development of an alternative field theoretic framework .",
    "fluctuation effects in reaction - diffusion systems have previously been successfully tackled using techniques borrowed from quantum field theory and also from the renormalisation group .",
    "examples include studies of the diffusion limited reactions @xmath0 @xcite and @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the first step in this analysis is to write down a master equation , which exactly describes the microscopic time evolution of the system . using methods developed by doi @xcite and peliti @xcite ,",
    "this can be mapped onto a schroedinger - like equation , with the introduction of a second quantised hamiltonian , and then onto a field theory , with an action @xmath94 .",
    "these steps have been described in detail elsewhere @xcite , and consequently we shall simply give the resulting action appropriate for our theory : @xmath95 -\\bar an_a -\\bar bn_b\\right ) .",
    "\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here we have defined @xmath21 and also introduced the response fields @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "in addition time @xmath98 , together with the reaction rates @xmath99 have been rescaled to absorb the diffusion constant @xmath100 . averaged",
    "quantities are then calculated according to @xmath101 where @xmath102 notice that in the path integral @xmath103 integration over the fields @xmath96 , @xmath55 and @xmath97 , @xmath56 whilst neglecting the quartic terms , leads to a recovery of the mean field rate equations .",
    "performing power counting on the action @xmath94 , we can now give the natural canonical dimensions for the various parameters appearing in the action : @xmath104\\sim k^{-2}\\qquad [ a],[b],[n_a],[n_b]\\sim k^d \\qquad [ \\bar a],[\\bar b]\\sim k^0 \\qquad [ \\lambda_{\\{ij\\}}]\\sim k^{2-d}.\\ ] ] notice that the reaction rates become dimensionless in @xmath47 , which we therefore postulate as the upper critical dimension for the system , in agreement with the smoluchowski prediction .    from the action @xmath94",
    ", we can see that the propagators for the theory are given by @xmath105 diagrammatically , we represent @xmath106 by a thin solid line and @xmath107 by a thin dotted line .",
    "the vertices for the theory are given in figure 1 .",
    "one of the most important features of this theory , as mentioned in the introduction , is the relative simplicity of its renormalisation .",
    "examination of the vertices given in figure 1 reveals that it is not possible to draw diagrams which dress the propagators .",
    "hence the bare propagators are the full propagators for the theory .",
    "consequently , the only renormalisation needed involves the reaction rates @xmath99 , and in particular the diffusion constants ( or @xmath46 ) are _ not _ renormalised .",
    "the temporally extended vertex functions for the reaction rates are given by the diagrammatic sums given in figure 2 . as is the case in similar theories @xcite ,",
    "these sums may be evaluated exactly , using laplace transforms : @xmath108 where @xmath109 and @xmath110 is the laplace transformed time variable .",
    "we can now use these vertex functions to define the three dimensionless renormalised and bare couplings , with @xmath111 , @xmath112 as the normalisation point : @xmath113 consequently , we can define three @xmath31 functions : @xmath114 and three fixed points @xmath115 : @xmath116 finally , we see from ( [ tevf1 ] ) , ( [ tevf2 ] ) , and ( [ tevf3 ] ) that the expansion of @xmath117 in powers of @xmath118 is given by : @xmath119      we now exploit the fact that physical quantities calculated using the field theory must be independent of the choice of normalisation point .",

    "contributions from tree diagrams are of order @xmath133 , for integer @xmath134 , and densities @xmath135 .",
    "however , diagrams with @xmath136 loops will be of order @xmath137 .",
    "the addition of loops makes the power @xmath117 higher relative to the power of the densities - so we conclude that the number of loops gives the order of the diagram .",
    "the lowest order diagrams contributing to @xmath138 and @xmath132 are the tree diagrams shown in figure 3 .",
    "we represent the classical ( tree level ) density @xmath139 by a wavy solid line , and @xmath140 by a wavy dotted line .",
    "these sets of diagrams are equivalent to the mean field rate equations , as may be seen by acting on each by their respective inverse green functions .",
    "the second tree level quantities appearing in the theory are the response functions : @xmath141 which we represent diagrammatically by the thick lines shown in figure 4 .",
    "these functions can be evaluated analytically , but only in the limit @xmath48 , or @xmath142 .",
    "the details of this calculation are presented in appendix a , where the following results are derived ( for @xmath48 ) : @xmath143 an extra check on validity of these response functions is provided by the relations : @xmath144 which follow from the definition of the response functions , and from the initial condition terms in the action @xmath94 .",
    "it is easy to check that the above response functions do indeed satisfy these relations .    for the opposite situation",
    "where @xmath38 ( and hence @xmath145 ) , we could use a formalism similar to the above for the density calculations .",
    "however , it is much simpler to map this case onto the @xmath146 regime by swapping the labels on the a and b particles , and then relabeling : @xmath147 we can then obtain the exponents and amplitudes for this second regime with no extra work .",
    "this concludes our discussion of the field theory formalism .",
    "the framework we have built up allows ( in principle ) the systematic calculation of fluctuation effects in all circumstances .",
    "however , it is only in the case where one of the species is greatly in the majority where the equations ( for the tree level densities and response functions ) are sufficiently simple for analytic progress to be made .",
    "we now turn to use of the field theory in calculating the fluctuation modified densities .",
    "the first step in using our field theory to include fluctuation effects is to insert the mean field ( tree level ) solution into the callan - symanzik solution ( [ css ] ) , using the results for the running densities / couplings ( [ rd ] ) , ( [ rc ] ) .",
    "since the fixed points for the couplings obey @xmath148 ( when @xmath36 ) it is appropriate to use the mean field solutions derived in section 2 . for the case where @xmath23 , this gives : @xmath149 and @xmath150 with @xmath151 valid for @xmath24 , where @xmath152 these modified crossover times are obtained by using the expressions for the running couplings / densities in the mean field crossovers .",
    "notice that the density decay exponents derived here are the same as those obtained from the smoluchowski approach .",
    "however , as we are performing an @xmath17 expansion , we are only strictly justified in retaining leading order @xmath17 terms .",
    "consequently we find , for the minority species density decay exponent and amplitude : @xmath153 eventually , however , as the a particles are decaying away more quickly than the b particles ( due to their greater diffusivity when @xmath36 ) , we crossover to a second regime where @xmath52 . for @xmath86",

    "the minority species finally decays away in the exponential fashion predicted in @xcite . for the intermediate case where @xmath46 is small , but nonzero ,",
    "the decay exponent for the minority species becomes large in the final regime .",
    "the explanation for this result lies in the relatively large diffusivity of the minority a species ( if @xmath100 is large ) and/or the increased density amplitude for the majority b particles ( if @xmath162 is small ) .",
    "both these effects will lead to an increased rate of decay for the a species .    finally , if the initial conditions are changed such that now @xmath163 , with @xmath40",
    ", then we obtain the same results as for the second of the above regimes for @xmath164 , with @xmath165 .",

    "for the majority a species the appropriate diagram is shown in figure 5 , where there are no @xmath140 insertions .",

    "@xmath38 ( and hence @xmath201 ) , we could follow the same route as described above , by evaluating the one loop diagrams shown in figures 7 and 8 . however , as we mentioned in the last section we can much more easily obtain these corrections by swapping the labels on the a and b particles , and then relabeling : @xmath202 following this procedure , the majority species amplitude / exponent can be found by taking @xmath203 in equation ( [ maxexp ] ) : @xmath204 we can obtain the one loop minority species exponent by substituting @xmath205 in equation ( [ bsecond ] ) : @xmath206 where @xmath44 \\right.\\right.\\ ] ] @xmath45\\right)\\right]\\right ) + o(\\epsilon^2 ) .",
    "\\label{olalph}\\ ] ] notice , however , that in forming the one loop corrections for the minority species exponent , we have had to expand the rg improved tree level result : @xmath207 the error arising from this expansion will become large as @xmath46 becomes small .",
    "eventually this inaccuracy will cause the exponent to reach a maximum and then _ decrease _ as @xmath46 is further reduced - behaviour which is clearly unphysical .",
    "in order to reduce the error , and to ensure that the expansion in equation ( [ treexp1 ] ) is qualitatively correct , we need to retain the @xmath208 terms .",
    "hence the one loop exponent in equation ( [ olalph ] ) should be treated with some caution - terms of order @xmath208 will probably be required for precise results . consequently the ( non @xmath17 expanded ) rg improved tree level result given in the last section may be more accurate in this regime . in figure 10",
    "we have plotted the one loop exponent @xmath209 as a function of @xmath46 , for @xmath35 ( @xmath197 ) , in the region @xmath210 , where the exponent is still _ increasing _ for decreasing @xmath46 .    in principle , calculations can also be made for the case with @xmath23 , but where we have crossed over to the regime @xmath52 ( for @xmath86 and times @xmath157 ) . however , a rigorous evaluation of the one loop diagrams is now much more difficult , as the functional forms for the densities and response functions will change over time .",
    "nevertheless , since the above corrections to the exponents come from asymptotic logarithmic terms , it is plausible to suppose that the new exponent corrections will be dominated by contributions from the final asymptotic regime .",
    "if this is indeed the case , then the one loop exponents ( though _ not _ the amplitudes ) will be unchanged from the previous results ( equations ( [ ola ] ) to ( [ olalph ] ) ) .",
    "this calculation will , however , suffer from the same problem as described above .",
    "for the case @xmath90 we expect logarithmic corrections to the decay exponents , as the reaction rates @xmath99 are marginal parameters at the critical dimension .",
    "we can find the running couplings from the characteristic equation ( [ gchar ] ) by taking the limit @xmath212 in equations ( [ b1 ] ) , ( [ b2 ] ) , and ( [ b3 ] ) : @xmath213 @xmath214 @xmath215 where we have taken the asymptotic limits .",
    "corrections to the asymptotic running couplings will be an order @xmath216 smaller , and consequently these asymptotic expressions will only be correct at very large times . hence our expressions for the densities will only be valid when both this condition , and the crossover time constraints given below , are satisfied . in what follows",
    "we shall assume the validity of the first of these two conditions .",
    "notice that the asymptotic running couplings are still ordered @xmath217 for @xmath36 , so we can use the mean field solutions derived in section 2 as the basis for the rg improved tree level exponents and amplitudes . making use of the callan - symanzik solution ( [ css ] ) and the above running couplings , we find for @xmath218 : @xmath219 where @xmath220 is a non - universal amplitude correction .",
    "note that the next order terms for the minority species are suppressed by a factor of only @xmath221 .",
    "using our expressions for the running couplings / densities in the mean field crossovers , we find that these expressions are valid for times @xmath222 , where @xmath223 for the case @xmath36 the system will eventually enter a second regime , where now the b species will be in the majority . we have ( for @xmath40 ) : @xmath224 with @xmath225 this is valid for times when @xmath226 , where @xmath227 alternatively , if we begin with @xmath38 , then for @xmath40 and @xmath228 , we have the same results as for the second of the above cases , with @xmath229 .",
    "interestingly , the logarithmic corrections we have derived in this section using the rg approach differ slightly from the smoluchowski results given in section 2 .",
    "in this paper we have made a comparison of two methods for treating fluctuation effects in a reaction - diffusion system .",
    "we have found that the smoluchowski and field theory approaches are rather similar - the smoluchowski approximation , for @xmath4 , giving the same exponents as the renormalisation group improved tree level in the field theory .",
    "in addition , we have gone on to calculate the field theoretic one loop corrections , which have yielded improved values for the exponents .",
    "the advantage of the field theory is that it provides a systematic way to calculate these corrections - a procedure which is lacking in the smoluchowski approach .",
    "furthermore the use of renormalisation group techniques has demonstrated universality in the asymptotic amplitudes and exponents , in that , for @xmath4 , they only depend on the diffusivities and the initial densities , and not on the reaction rates .    the theory we have developed in this paper can easily be extended to slightly different situations .",
    "consider first an annihilation / coagulation reaction - diffusion system , where the following reactions occur : @xmath230 the smoluchowski approach differs from before only in the absence of factors of @xmath231 in the rate equation terms describing the same species reactions .",
    "consequently , if we begin with @xmath23 then the minority species will decay as @xmath232 on the other hand , the field theory description lacks only the factors of @xmath231 in the action ( [ action ] ) .",
    "if this difference is followed through then the decay exponent in the rg improved tree level is seen to be the same as in the smoluchowski approach .",
    "however , this difference of a factor of @xmath231 has a major effect on the response functions ( where this factor appears as a power ) , and as a result the new one loop corrections will be different from those calculated in section 4.2 .",
    "these results should be compared with the exact solution @xcite for the minority species decay rate @xmath233 , where : @xmath234 note that in this case , although the smoluchowski answer is qualitatively correct , it deviates considerably from the exact answer .",
    "hence we can see that application of the smoluchowski approach does not always lead to accurate exponents .",
    "another possible extension is to consider reaction - diffusion systems with more than two species of particle .",
    "for example , examining a three species system , we could have the reactions : @xmath235 @xmath236 analysis of this situation is very similar to before , and we merely remark that in the appropriate asymptotic regimes the smoluchowski and rg improved tree level exponents ( consisting of ratios of diffusion constants ) are once again identical .",
    "hence the convergence between the smoluchowski exponents and those obtained from the rg improved tree level is fairly robust , and is not simply confined to the two species systems we have previously been considering .",
    "a further possibility is to analyse the case where we have a continuous distribution of diffusivities , but with only a _ single _",
    "reaction channel .",
    "this has been studied from the smoluchowski point of view by krapivsky _",
    "@xcite , and it would be interesting to extend our rg methods to include this situation .    our theory could also be employed to consider clustered immobile reactants - a generalisation of the @xmath30 case included in our calculations .",
    "this situation has been analysed by ben - naim @xcite , using the smoluchowski approach , where the dimension of the cluster @xmath237 was found to substantially affect the kinetics .",
    "specifically , for codimensionality @xmath238 ( in a space of dimension @xmath78 ) a finite fraction of the impurities was found to survive , whereas for @xmath239 the clusters decayed away indefinitely .",
    "the formalism we have presented in this paper could be adapted to study this clustered impurity problem , where calculations could be made without reliance on the smoluchowski approach .",
    "* acknowledgments . *",
    "the author thanks john cardy for suggesting this problem and for many useful discussions . financial support from the epsrc",
    "is also acknowledged .",
    "obtaining an exact analytic expression for the response functions is , in general , very hard .",
    "suppose we define the `` trunk '' to be the line of propagators onto which the density lines are attached , as shown at the bottom of figure 4 .",
    "difficulties arise from diagrams where the `` trunk '' changes from one propagator into the other , and then back again , as shown in last of the diagrams for the @xmath240 response function in figure 4 .",
    "if diagrams of this type are initially excluded then progress can be made .",
    "consider first the two subseries shown in figure 11 , for the functions @xmath241 and @xmath242 , where diagrams of the above kind have been excluded .",
    "these series can be summed exactly ( using the same technique as described in @xcite ) , giving : @xmath243 @xmath244 the full response functions are now given by the diagrammatic equations shown in figure 12 , where all possible diagrams are included .",
    "written out explicitly these give : @xmath245 in general this set of coupled integral equations is intractable - however we can make progress in the limit where @xmath246 , or @xmath247 . considering the case where @xmath246 , the dominant contributions to the response functions come from diagrams with the minimum possible number of @xmath140 density line insertions .",
    "accordingly , we can now truncate the full diagrammatic equations , as shown in figure 13 .",
    "notice that to this order @xmath240 , @xmath248 , and @xmath249 contain no @xmath140 density insertions , whereas @xmath250 must contain one such insertion . in this approximation",
    "we can now perform the integrals inside the @xmath251 and @xmath252 functions , using the appropriate mean field density : @xmath253 @xmath254 and therefore @xmath255 @xmath256 using these expressions , it is now straightforward to derive the response functions given in equations ( [ r1l ] ) , ( [ r1n ] ) , ( [ r1p ] ) , and ( [ r1 m ] ) .",
    "for the case where @xmath166 the hardest of the three diagrams of figure 6 to evaluate is ( ii ) - see equation ( [ la2 ] ) .",
    "we shall evaluate it first in @xmath47 , and then deduce its form in @xmath257 .",
    "notice that the extra integration resulting from the @xmath140 insertion in the loop ensures that this diagram is not divergent . taking the asymptotic part of the @xmath175 and @xmath258 pieces , we find : @xmath259 @xmath260 the @xmath174 and @xmath258 integrals are elementary , giving @xmath261 @xmath262+{1-\\delta\\over ( t_2(1+\\delta)-2t_1)^2}\\ln\\left({2t_1\\over ( 1+\\delta)t_2}\\right)\\right).\\ ] ] although the first part of the @xmath175 integral is straightforward , the second piece involving the logarithm is more difficult",
    "if we make the transformation @xmath263 we find : @xmath264 where all time dependency has been removed from the integral limits .",
    "the final @xmath176 integral is then easy to perform , and we end up with : @xmath265 @xmath266\\right ) \\ln(2\\lambda_{aa}n_at).\\ ] ] however , we now need to extend this analysis to determine the behaviour of the integral in @xmath257 . if we take the asymptotic part of all the pieces inside the integral , and perform power counting , we find that it should scale as @xmath267 .",
    "however , this procedure is not strictly valid , as in moving to the asymptotic version a false @xmath268 divergence is created .",
    "nevertheless , the integral is dominated by contributions from late times where arguments based on power counting should be valid . hence in @xmath257",
    "we find : @xmath265 @xmath269+o(\\epsilon)\\right)t^{\\epsilon/2}\\ln(2\\lambda_{aa}n_at).\\ ] ] further subleading corrections ( in time ) , which we have not calculated , will lack the logarithm factor , and so will contribute to the _ amplitude _ for the minority species density .",
