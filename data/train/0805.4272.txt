    "quantum criticality in heavy - fermion metals is an active topic in current condensed - matter research .",
    "much work has focused on the nature of the quantum phase transition ( qpt ) between a paramagnetic heavy fermi liquid ( fl ) and an antiferromagnetic ( af ) metal.@xcite various experimental data appear to be inconsistent with the theoretical predictions for a spin - density wave ( sdw ) transition in a metal.@xcite this has prompted proposals about a different transition scenario , where the kondo effect breaks down at the antiferromagnetic quantum critical point ( qcp ) .",
    "then the heavy quasiparticles of fl , formed from conduction ( @xmath0 ) and local - moment ( @xmath1 ) electrons , disintegrate at the qcp .",
    "such a kondo - breakdown transition involves degrees of freedom other than the antiferromagnetic fluctuations at the ordering wavevector @xmath2 , and different theoretical descriptions have been proposed.@xcite si _",
    "et al._@xcite have employed an extension of dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) to argue that magnetic fluctuations in two space dimensions render the kondo effect critical _ at _ the af qcp .",
    "in contrast , the scenario of senthil _ et al._@xcite is centered around a kondo - breakdown transition between two _ paramagnetic _ states : a heavy fermi liquid with kondo screening and a so - called fractionalized fermi liquid ( fl@xmath3 ) without kondo screening . in fl@xmath3 , frustration and/or strong quantum fluctuations",
    "preclude magnetic long - range order of the @xmath1 moments , which instead form an exotic spin liquid,@xcite decoupled from the conduction electrons .",
    "a sharp distinction between fl and fl@xmath3 is in the fermi volume ( assuming one @xmath1 electron per unit cell in the paramagnet ) : fl has a `` large '' fermi volume including the @xmath1 electrons , whereas the fermi volume of fl@xmath3 is `` small '' , i.e. , only determined by the @xmath0 electrons . loosely speaking",
    ", the @xmath1 electrons may be called `` itinerant '' in fl and `` localized '' in fl@xmath3 . in this scenario",
    ", antiferromagnetism may occur as a secondary instability of fl@xmath3 , such that a conventional af phase is reached via the kondo - breakdown transition.@xcite    the possibility of having distinct quantum critical points between fl and af raises the question whether distinct af",
    "( i.e. with `` itinerant '' or `` localized '' @xmath1 electrons ) may be discriminated .",
    "consider commensurate order with an even number @xmath4 of sites in the unit cell ( other cases will be discussed briefly towards the end of the paper ) .",
    "then , the size of the brillouin zone in the af phase is reduced by a factor @xmath4 compared to the paramagnetic phase , and as a result `` large '' and `` small '' fermi volume are no longer distinct .",
    "however , it has been proposed that the situations differ w.r.t .",
    "their fermi - surface topology.@xcite two phases , af@xmath5  and af@xmath6 , corresponding to itinerant and local - moment antiferromagnetism , respectively , have been introduced,@xcite with the notion that they are separated by one or more quantum phase transitions . in this context",
    ", it has been suggested that in af@xmath6  kondo screening is absent .    in this paper , we argue that such a sharp distinction between af@xmath5  and af@xmath6  does not exist . to this end , we invoke continuity arguments between kondo and weakly interacting electron models , and demonstrate the possibility of a continuous fermi surface ( fs ) evolution between the situations of itinerant and local - moment antiferromagnetism .",
    "kondo screening hence disappears smoothly in the af phase : technically , a line of renormalization - group fixed points emerges , describing af polarized fermi liquids .",
    "this finding does not contradict microscopic calculations@xcite which find a topological lifshitz transition inside the antiferromagnetic phase , but shows that such a transition is not connected to a breakdown of the kondo effect .",
    "we also discuss conditions for the occurrence of fs - topology - changing transitions .",
    "we note that many experimental criteria for kondo screening , e.g. the existence of a maximum in the resistivity @xmath7 at the coherence temperature , do not provide a sharp distinction between itinerant and local - moment af .",
    "this means e.g. that the maximum in @xmath7 will be gradually washed out and disappear when tuning from itinerant to local - moment af .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : gen ] we start by characterizing ground states of kondo lattices , and we discuss the adiabatic continuity to phases of weakly interacting electrons . in sec .",
    "[ sec : mf ] we give an explicit example for a continuous fermi - surface evolution in a mean - field kondo lattice model , smoothly connecting the situations of `` itinerant '' and `` localized '' @xmath1 electrons in the presence of commensurate antiferromagnetism .",
    "we then re - formulate our findings in the languages of renormalization group ( sec .",
    "[ sec : rg ] ) and slave - particle theory coupled to gauge fields ( sec .",
    "[ sec : gauge ] ) , establishing connections to earlier work .",
    "we close with remarks on recent theoretical and experimental results .",
    "the detailed discussion of band structures , of criteria for topological transitions and of the interesting case of incommensurate magnetic order are relegated to the appendices .",
    "consider a kondo lattice model in @xmath8 spatial dimensions with a unit cell containing one @xmath0 and @xmath1 orbital each , @xmath9 where the chemical potential @xmath10 controls the filling @xmath11 of the conduction ( @xmath0 ) band with dispersion @xmath12 , and @xmath13 is the conduction electron spin density on site @xmath14 .",
    "sometimes it is useful to explicitly include a heisenberg - type exchange interaction between the @xmath1 electron local moments @xmath15 , @xmath16 , which may originate from superexchange ( or rkky ) interactions.@xcite      if kondo screening of the local moments @xmath15 dominates over inter - moment interactions , then a heavy fermi liquid ( fl ) results .",
    "the fermi volume is `` large '' , i.e. , includes the local - moment electrons , @xmath17 with @xmath18 , in agreement with luttinger s theorem.@xcite here , the factor of two accounts for the spin degeneracy of the bands , and @xmath19 is a phase space factor , with @xmath20 the unit cell volume .    kondo screening may break down due to competing exchange interactions among the local @xmath1 moments . if the local - moment magnetism is dominated by geometric frustration or strong quantum fluctuations,@xcite the @xmath1 moment subsystem may form a paramagnetic spin liquid without broken symmetries , only weakly interacting with the @xmath0 electrons.@xcite the resulting fl@xmath3 phase is necessarily exotic , as it features a `` small '' fermi volume @xmath21 violating luttinger s theorem . as discussed in ref .",
    ", the low - energy excitations of the fractionalized spin liquid account for the luttinger violation .",
    "thus , the fermi volume provides a sharp distinction between fl and fl@xmath3 .",
    "if the heavy fl phase undergoes a standard sdw transition , we obtain a conventional metallic af phase",
    " often denoted as `` itinerant '' antiferromagnet  with fermi - liquid properties .",
    "for the simplest case of collinear commensurate antiferromagnetism with an even number @xmath4 of sites in the af unit cell , the spin degeneracy of the bands is preserved ( see appendix [ app : band ] ) , and the onset of af order simply implies a `` backfolding '' of the bands into the af brillouin zone .",
    "this results in a fermi volume @xmath22 with @xmath23 .",
    "this value of @xmath24 equals @xmath25 , i.e. , the distinction between `` large '' and `` small '' fermi volume is lost .    on the other hand",
    ", one may consider a `` local - moment '' af phase . in the language of the kondo model ,",
    "this is obtained by forming a local - moment antiferromagnet from the @xmath1 spins , and then switching on a weak kondo coupling to the @xmath0 electrons .",
    "importantly , this phase has fermi - liquid properties as well .",
    "paranthetically , we note that a distinct magnetic phase is obtained by the onset of magnetic order in the fractionalized fl@xmath3 phase.@xcite this exotic af@xmath3 phase , characterized by topological order , is not of interest for the body of the paper , but will be briefly discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : gauge ] .",
    "the fl phase of a kondo lattice is adiabatically connected to the non - interacting limit of the corresponding anderson lattice model , @xmath26 in standard notation .",
    "while this anderson model can be mapped to the kondo model in the kondo limit , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 with @xmath30 finite , the properties of the heavy fl phase of both models can in principle be obtained perturbatively in @xmath31 starting from two hybridized non - interacting bands.@xcite in other words , no phase transition occurs between the free - fermion situation @xmath32 and the large-@xmath31 fermi liquid phase in the anderson model.@xcite    as the itinerant af phase is obtained from fl by the onset of sdw order , it is adiabatically connected to a non - interacting electron system of two hybridized bands in the presence of a staggered magnetic mean field.@xcite    now we turn to the local - moment af phase .",
    "consider first the system of @xmath1 moments alone : this is an af mott insulator . in the band picture ,",
    "the @xmath1 band is half - filled ; after backfolding this translates into integer band filling for an even number @xmath4 of sites in the af unit cell .",
    "( the same applies to odd @xmath4 , but here the spin degeneracy is lifted , see appendix  [ app : band ] . )",
    "as large band gaps are induced by the af order parameter , non - interacting @xmath1 electrons in the presence of an antiferromagnetic exchange ( mean ) field are insulating as well , i.e. , there is no distinction here between band and mott insulator .",
    "this fact is well known , e.g. , for a half - filled one - band hubbard model , where itinerant and local - moment antiferromagnet are continuously connected upon variation of @xmath31.@xcite consequently , for _ vanishing _ kondo coupling , the local - moment af phase of the kondo lattice is adiabatically connected to a non - interacting anderson model with vanishing hybridization and mean - field antiferromagnetism .",
    "further , in such a two - band model of non - interacting electrons with @xmath1 band gap , small @xmath0@xmath1 hybridization is a marginal perturbation as it shifts the bands , but leaves the topology of the fermi surface unchanged .",
    "recent theory works@xcite suggested that local - moment and itinerant antiferromagnetism in kondo lattices are distinct phases which are separated by ( at least ) one quantum phase transition .",
    "there are , in fact , two issues here , related to ( a ) possibly different fermi - surface topologies , and ( b ) a possible breakdown of kondo screening within the af phase , to be discussed in turn .",
    "\\(a ) the local - moment af phase ( dubbed af@xmath6 ) displays a fermi surface with a topology inherited from the bare @xmath0 band , while the itinerant af phase ( dubbed af@xmath5 ) was argued to display a different fs topology.@xcite ( in the simplest models , af@xmath5  has a hole - like fs , whereas af@xmath6  has an electron - like fs . ) if this difference in topology indeed exists , it necessitates one or more topology - changing transitions inside the af phase .",
    "such a transition can be of lifshitz or van - hove type , where a local band extremum or a saddle point crosses the fermi level , respectively  both cases cause ( weak ) thermodynamic singularities and lead to abrupt changes in the electron orbits as measured e.g. in the de - haas - van - alphen effect .",
    "the variational kondo - lattice - model calculations of ref",
    ".   indeed showed two af phases with different fs topology ; however , in a large parameter regime , a direct first - order transition from fl to af@xmath6  was found .",
    "\\(b ) in ref .",
    ", the af@xmath6  phase was argued to be stable against a small kondo coupling .",
    "the authors concluded that this situation is qualitatively different from af@xmath5 , and consequently af@xmath5  and af@xmath6  have to be separated by a quantum phase transition associated with the breakdown of kondo screening ( which may coincide with the transition in fs topology ) .    in the following ,",
    "we argue that ( a ) a continuous fs evolution between itinerant and local - moment af phases is possible ( using an explicit example , sec .  [ sec : mf ] ) , and ( b ) kondo screening disappears smoothly in the af phase ( sec .",
    "[ sec : rg ] ) .",
    "consequently , a sharp distinction between two _ phases _",
    "af@xmath6  and af@xmath5is not meaningful .",
    "we now give an explicit example for a continuous evolution from itinerant to local - moment af in a model of effectively non - interacting electrons .",
    "this approach can be justified by invoking either the equivalence of the relevant fermi - liquid phases to phases of non - interacting electrons ( sec .",
    "[ sec : adiabatic ] ) , or the well - known mean - field treatments of the kondo or anderson lattice models .",
    "for instance , for the kondo lattice the kondo interaction is decoupled using a slave - boson field @xmath33 . at the saddle - point level ,",
    "one obtains a two - band model of non - interacting electrons , with a hybridization @xmath33 , hence the condensation of @xmath33 signals kondo screening ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : gauge ] for details ) .",
    "antiferromagnetism is obtained from a mean - field decoupling@xcite of the inter - moment exchange interaction @xmath34 , which results in a staggered mean - field for the @xmath1 electrons .",
    "we consider the following effective hamiltonian : @xmath35 . \\label{hmf}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it consists of two bands , hybridized by @xmath36 , with dispersions @xmath12 and @xmath37 , respectively .",
    "note that , within a mean - field theory for the kondo lattice , @xmath37 and @xmath38 are renormalized _ effective _ parameters of the @xmath1 band , the latter playing the role of a lagrange multiplier fixing @xmath39 .",
    "collinear antiferromagnetism is accounted for via the mean fields @xmath40 and @xmath41 ( for @xmath0 and @xmath1 electrons ) , encoding the magnetic order parameter with wavevector @xmath2 ( see appendix  [ app : band ] for the general case ) .",
    "typically , order will primarily arise in the @xmath1 electron sector , hence we expect @xmath42 .",
    "@xmath2 corresponds to an @xmath4-site unit cell in the af ordered state , for even @xmath4 the af bands will be spin - degenerate ( appendix  [ app : band ] ) .",
    "= 3.2 in    as example we focus on a quasi - one - dimensional situation of a 2d array of coupled chains , where the af phase has a @xmath43 unit cell , i.e. a collinear period-4 af order in each chain . in fig .",

    "the bare @xmath0 fermi surface is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fs]a .",
    "backfolding into the af zone results in two partially filled bands  this is the fs structure of the local - moment antiferromagnet , where the @xmath1 subsystem is gapped ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fs]c2 ) . on the other hand , the paramagnetic large - fs state for sizeable @xmath36 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fs]b . entering the af phase via an sdw transition leaves us with two full and two partially filled bands , fig .",
    "[ fig : fs]c1 .",
    "importantly , this topology is identical to the one in fig .",
    "[ fig : fs]c2 . together with the continuity arguments in sec .",
    "[ sec : adiabatic ] , this constitutes a proof that a continuous evolution from itinerant ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fs]c1 ) to local - moment ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fs]c2 ) antiferromagnetism is possible .",
    "a few remarks are in order : ( i ) due to the 1d geometry , there are no closed orbits , and the large fermi surface of fl does not intersect the af zone boundary ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fs]b ) . as a result",
    ", there is no landau damping of the af order parameter at the sdw transition .",
    "however , both features can be easily changed by including a second @xmath0 band with a closed fs intersecting the af zone boundary .",
    "( heavy - fermion metals often feature a complicated band structure with numerous bands . )",
    "if this band is only weakly hybridized with the @xmath1 band , then its fermi surface will not differ in topology between the itinerant and local - moment limits .",
    "we shall give an additional example in appendix  [ app : ex2 ] which displays both closed orbits and landau damping .",
    "( ii ) for an af unit cell with @xmath4 a half - integer multiple of 4 ( @xmath48 ) , topological reasons require that the fermi surface crosses at least one van - hove singularity between the itinerant and local - moment limits ( see appendix  [ app : crit ] ) .",
    "in this section , we discuss the fate of kondo screening in the framework of the renormalization - group ( rg ) treatment of the kondo coupling between local moments and conduction electrons . in this language , kondo screening ( in the paramagnetic phase ) is signaled by a runaway flow to strong coupling of the kondo interaction .",
    "what happens in the antiferromagnetic phase ?",
    "ref .   presented an rg calculation starting from a local - moment antiferromagnet , with the result that the kondo coupling is an exactly marginal perturbation to the fixed point of decoupled @xmath0 and @xmath1 electrons ( dubbed af@xmath6 ) .",
    "this qualitative difference to the paramagnetic case was used to conclude that af@xmath6  and the kondo - screened af@xmath5  situation represent distinct _ phases _ , and a phase transition has to separate the two .    for comparison , let us review the well - studied problem of a single kondo impurity in a magnetic field.@xcite here , no zero - temperature phase transition occurs as function of the field , i.e. , all observables evolve smoothly from @xmath49 to @xmath50 . for @xmath51 ,",
    "the low - energy theory takes the form of a spin - dependent potential scatterer , with phase shifts varying continuously as a function of the field . in the rg language",
    ", this situation corresponds to a _ line _ of fixed points , parameterized by the phase shifts .",
    "this line connects the fixed points of the screened zero - field impurity and the fully polarized impurity .",
    "the topology of the rg flow implies the existence of an exactly marginal operator  for a finite fixed field , this is the kondo coupling @xmath52 itself .",
    "importantly , the distinct rg flow of @xmath52 for zero field and finite field does _ not _ imply the existence of a quantum phase transition .    adapting this knowledge to the kondo lattice ,",
    "we believe that the rg calculation of ref .   is correct , but does not imply the necessity for a phase transition inside the antiferromagnetic phase ( if the latter is reached via a sdw transition ) .",
    "we can offer two lines of arguments : ( a ) within dmft , the antiferromagnetic phase of the kondo lattice is mapped onto a single kondo impurity in a field , hence the knowledge sketched above can be carried over.@xcite ( b ) beyond dmft , we know that both af@xmath5  and af@xmath6  are fermi - liquid phases , which generically display a set of marginal operators ( corresponding e.g. to band - structure parameters ) . as the rg expansion in ref .",
    "is performed around a fermi liquid , finding marginal operators is no surprise .",
    "( this is different from an expansion starting from decoupled moments in the paramagnetic kondo lattice ",
    "this is a non - fermi liquid due to the degenerate local - moment states . ) in fact , it is straightforward to check that all fermi - liquid renormalizations are generated in the expansion of ref .  .",
    "hence , no qualitative differences exist between the local - moment and itinerant af regimes .    in summary , the rg result of ref .",
    "is not in contradiction with itinerant and local - moment af regimes being continuously connected . instead",
    ", the af phase should be interpreted as family of rg fixed points of fermi - liquid type .",

    "these arguments do not exclude the existence of ( continuous or first - order ) lifshitz or van - hove transitions within the antiferromagnetic phase .",

    "the simplest situation is collinear af with even @xmath4 : here , the up and down sectors decouple and are degenerate as the eigenvalues of depend only on @xmath88 . for non - collinear order with even @xmath4",
    "the spin sectors mix , but the double degeneracy is preserved , because there exists a translation operation which reverses all spins ( i.e. the combined action of time reversal plus translation is a symmetry of the state ) .    for odd @xmath4 ,",
    "the spin degeneracy is in general lifted .",
    "the only exception is the case of a purely imaginary @xmath85 : here , one site within the unit cell ( more generally , an odd number of sites ) has exactly zero magnetization .",
    "( this situation requires an exotic spin liquid , further symmetry breaking , or coupling to other degrees of freedom like kondo screening of these moments . )",
    "we conclude that , for both the cases of ( i ) even @xmath4 and ( ii ) odd @xmath4 with spin degeneracy lifted , the itinerant antiferromagnet with one electron per site , has _",
    "band filling ( after taking into account backfolding and spin ) .",
    "then , in the presence of sufficiently large exchange fields ( i.e. band splitting ) the magnet will be insulating .",
    "this af band insulator is adiabatically connected to an af mott insulator .",
    "as transitions with changes in the fs topology may always occur within fermi - liquid phases , we discuss under which circumstances topological transitions in the af phase of kondo lattices are _ not _ required to occur : an example without transitions was given in sec .",
    "[ sec : mf ] .",
    "the discussion will concentrate on the momentum - space volume and topology of the occupied fermionic states of the @xmath0 plus @xmath1 electron system , where we allow for @xmath89 different @xmath0 electron bands .",
    "the strategy is to find conditions for the backfolded band structures of the fl phase and the @xmath0 band(s ) alone to be identical in topology  then a smooth evolution from itinerant to local - moment af is possible .",
    "we denote the total occupied volumes of the partially filled bands in the fl phase and the @xmath0 band(s ) alone with @xmath90 and @xmath91 , respectively .",
    "hence , @xmath92 and @xmath93 , in other words , @xmath94 and @xmath95 differ by an odd integer .",
    "after backfolding , both total occupied volumes ( again of the partially filled bands ) need to be identical to avoid topological transitions in the af phase .",
    "the volumes can change by @xmath96 if bands after backfolding ( i.e. in the reduced brillouin zone ) are fully occupied ( as in fig .",
    "[ fig : fs]b ) . hence , the number @xmath97 of completely filled _ reduced _ bz must differ by an odd multiple of @xmath98 between the fl phase and the @xmath0 bands alone , @xmath99 .",
    "this condition can obviously not be met for odd @xmath4 ; here `` large '' and `` small '' fermi volume are only equivalent in the af phase after taking into account the broken spin degeneracy of the bands .",
    "thus , for odd @xmath4 , at least one topological transition occurs inside the af phase .    for even @xmath4",
    ", we now focus on the number @xmath100 of partially filled bands in the af phase ( after backfolding ) where those @xmath101 dimensional surface areas of the reduced bz boundary , which were not part of the original bz boundary , are fully occupied . for the discussion",
    "we furthermore assume inversion symmetry .",
    "@xmath100 receives _ even _ contributions from all bands of the paramagnetic phase , except for situations where a reduced bz is fully occupied : each of these cases give an _",
    "odd _ contribution to @xmath100 , hence @xmath102 . to avoid topological transitions , @xmath100 must be equal for the itinerant af ( derived from fl ) and the localized af ( derived from the @xmath0 bands alone ) , @xmath103 . hence , @xmath104 .",
    "the above condition @xmath105 translates into the necessary condition of @xmath4 to be a multiple of 4 for not having a topological transition ( in the presence of inversion symmetry ) .",
    "an example with @xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath108 is in fig .",
    "[ fig : fs ] .",
    "further considerations now have to include the @xmath109 dimensional `` edges '' of the bz . here",

    "the af phase has @xmath106 with a @xmath111 unit cell , originating from 4-sublattice co - planar af order characterized by two ordering wavevectors @xmath112 and @xmath113 , where @xmath114 ( @xmath115 ) correspond to a spin - density wave with spin polarization in @xmath116 ( @xmath117 ) direction with equal amplitude .",

    "the fermi surface evolution is shown in fig .  [",

    "backfolding of the fl bands ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fs2]b ) results in two completely filled plus four partially filled bands in the itinerant antiferromagnet ( fig .  [",
    "fig : fs2]c1 ) .",
    "again , these fermi surfaces are topologically identical to those of the local - moment antiferromagnet ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fs2]c2 ) , obtained from backfolding the bare @xmath0 band structure of fig .",
    "[ fig : fs2]a . note that this example displays both closed electron orbits and landau damping of the order parameter .",
    "so far , the discussion applied to antiferromagnetism with a spatial period being commensurate with the crystal lattice .",
    "incommensurate order is qualitatively different , at least at @xmath61 in an ideal crystal . here",
    ", the volume of the reduced brillouin zone ( after backfolding ) is zero , and the resulting band structure has quasi - crystalline properties , with a hierarchy on infinitely many gaps.@xcite hence , the fermi volume is no longer a well - defined concept .",
    "another way to think about incommensurate ordering is to approach the incommensurate @xmath2 via a sequence of commensurate @xmath2 , with increasing size of the unit cell and decreasing size of the brillouin zone .",
    "a small brillouin zone implies that changes of the band structure cause frequent topological transitions .",
    "then , the passage from itinerant to local - moment antiferromagnetism in the incommensurate case will be accompanied by a dense sequence of topological transitions  which may be interpreted as adiabatic continuity .    in the presence of finite temperature or disorder ,",
    "the small band gaps will be smeared , and the structure effectively behaves as commensurate ( for fixed @xmath62 ) .",
    "then , our above consideration in the body of the paper apply .                                a large - scale numerical study [ l. c. martin and f. f. assaad ,",

    ", contains the physics of the indirect rkky interaction between local moments , it is convenient for the theoretical discussion to introduce an ( additional ) explicit inter - moment interaction .",
    "the main effects of collinear itinerant antiferromagnetism are the breaking of su(2 ) symmetry , band backfolding , and the opening of band gaps at the boundary of the antiferromagnetic brillouin zone .",
    "these are correctly described in the standard saddle - point treatment , where order is implemented via a staggered mean field .",
