    "studies for the specific parameters appropriate for given compounds will be the subject of separate papers .",
    "the purpose of the present one is to give a detailed description of the theoretical approach , which is an extension of the tpsc approach .    briefly speaking ,",
    "the tpsc method was derived from a functional approach by approximating the vertex functions as local functions of the imaginary time and space ( in other words irreducible vertices independent of frequency and wave vector ) .",
    "this leads to irreducible spin and charge vertices that contain two unknown constants , namely the on - site pair correlation function and its functional derivative , which can be self - consistently determined from two sum - rules on the structure functions .",
    "unfortunately the number of unknowns becomes more than the number of available sum - rules in the ehm , so one has to use another approach . in our previous work ,",
    "@xcite we simply neglected the contribution of functional derivatives of the pair correlation functions .",
    "we obtained good agreement with qmc results for small values of @xmath1 when spin fluctuations are still dominant , but this approach did not work so well in the opposite limit when charge fluctuations becomes dominant .",
    "this is mainly due to ignoring the functional derivative of the pair correlation functions . in this paper",

    "the mean field ( mf ) approximation @xcite and the renormalization group ( rg ) approach @xcite , as well as exact diagonalization ohta:1994 , perturbation theory about ordered states @xcite and trial correlated wave functions @xcite have been applied to this problem .",
    "one of the results that we will find at half - filling is a crossover line at @xmath5 from dominant antiferromagnetic fluctuations to dominant checkerboard charge fluctuations .",
    "this is in agreement with several studies @xcite as we will discuss .",

    "the pauli principle prevents charge and spin fluctuations to increase at the same time in the paramagnetic regime at finite temperature .",

    "we present the formalism , which first focuses on finding a set of closed equations for the irreducible vertices .",
    "we explain how the functional derivative of the pair correlation functions enter in the evaluation of irreducible vertices . in the second part of the theory section ,",

    "the methodology developed in the present paper can be easily applied to different lattices and higher dimension .",
    "it can be extended also to longer - range interactions .",
