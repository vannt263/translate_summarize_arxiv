    "search for and discovering new physics ( np ) beyond the standard model ( sm ) has been one the of main physics motivations to build the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "one prominent path to find np is through model independent searches for possible new particles beyond the sm .",
    "many extensions of the sm predict new heavy resonances with masses at the tev scale .",
    "some of these heavy resonances , such as a new heavy gauge boson @xmath1 or kaluza - klein ( kk ) gluons from the bulk randall - sundrum model , can predominantly decay to a top - anti - top quark pair ( @xmath0 ) final state  @xcite .",
    "because of the energy scale of these processes , the top quarks from the heavy resonance decay receive a significant lorentz boost .",
    "their hadronically decaying products are usually so collimated that they can be only reconstructed as single jets in the experiments .    in recent years",
    ", many theoretical studies have been performed to investigate the signature of boosted hadronically decaying top quarks  @xcite , where a hadronically decaying top is defined as the top quark whose @xmath2 boson daughter decays hadronically .",
    "several experimental searches for heavy new resonances decaying to @xmath0 final states have also been carried out by the atlas and cms experiments at the lhc  @xcite .",
    "the measurements exclude a production of such a new heavy resonance with a mass up to 1 - 2 , depending on the np model used for the theoretical interoperation of the results . in all those studies and measurements , the complete final state of the top quark decay",
    "is reconstructed as a single jet , hereafter referred as @xmath3 jet .",
    "the invariant mass of the reconstructed jet ( @xmath4 ) is used to distinguish the @xmath3 jets from qcd jets , where the qcd jets are defined as those jets initiated by a non - top quark or gluon .",
    "since the jet mass alone may not provide sufficient discriminating power to effectively separate @xmath3 jets from the overwhelming qcd background in many analyses , techniques based on jet substructure information , such as jet shape observables  @xcite , filtering  @xcite , pruning  @xcite and trimming  @xcite , are typically implemented as additional experimental handles to identify boosted hadronically decaying @xmath3 quarks .    in our previous paper",
    "@xcite , we introduce a new approach to study jet substructure in the center - of - mass frame of the jet .",
    "we demonstrated that it can be used to discriminate the boosted heavy particles from the qcd jets and the method is complementary to other jet substructure algorithms .",
    "a similar idea has also been explored to search for hadronically decaying higgs boson  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we will extend the studies presented in ref .",
    "@xcite to focus on identifying the boosted hadronically decaying top quark in the center - of - mass frame of the jet .",
    "we demonstrate that the method can greatly reduce the qcd jet background while maintaining a high identification efficiency of the boosted top quark even in the environment of a very large number of multiple interactions per event ( pileup ) .",
    "using an example of applications , we show a good prospective on search for heavy mass particles in the @xmath0 decay channel at the lhc .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : sample ] , we describe the event sample used in the study . section  [ sec : jet_sub ] discusses the method to identify @xmath3 jets using jet substructure in the jet center - of - mass frame and its performance .",
    "an example of the application of our method is given in section  [ sec : app ] .",
    "we conclude in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "we use boosted @xmath3 jets , from the sm process of @xmath0 production , as a benchmark to study the identification of boosted hadronically decaying top quark with our proposed jet substructure method . for simplicity",
    "we only consider the background from the sm dijet production since its cross section is several orders of magnitudes larger than those of other sm background .",
    "in addition , we also generate events to simulate a heavy - particle @xmath5 that decays to a @xmath0 final state .",
    "all the events used in this analysis are produced using the pythia 6.421 event generator  @xcite for the @xmath6 collision at @xmath7 center - of - mass energy . in order to simulate the finite resolution of the calorimeter detector at the lhc",
    ", we divide the @xmath8 plane into @xmath9 cells .",
    "we sum over the energy of particles entering each cell in each event , except for the neutrinos and muons , and replace it with a massless pseudoparticle of the same energy , also referred to an energy cluster , pointing to the center of the cell .",
    "these pseudoparticles are fed into the fastjet 3.0.1  @xcite package for jet reconstruction .",
    "the jets are reconstructed using the anti-@xmath10 algorithm  @xcite with a distance parameter of @xmath11 .",
    "the anti-@xmath10 jet algorithm is the default one used at the atlas and cms experiments . in order to evaluate the performance of top jet identification with the currently expected experimental conditions at the lhc",
    ", we generate mc events with different average numbers of multiple interactions per event  @xcite and then repeat our studies for each scenarios .",
    "we compare the results to the one in the ideal experimental condition that has no pileup .",
    "in this section we describe the method to study jet substructure of the @xmath3 jets in the center - of - mass frame of the jet in order to distinguish them from the qcd jets .",
    "we select jets with @xmath12 and @xmath13 as @xmath3 jet candidates , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the transverse momentum and pseudorapidity of the jet .",
    "we further require that the @xmath3 jet candidates have @xmath16 . in case",
    "there are more than one candidate in an event , all of them are kept for further analysis .",
    "we define the center - of - mass frame ( rest frame ) of a jet as the frame where the four momentum of the jet is equal to @xmath17 .",
    "a jet consists of its constituent particles .",
    "the distribution of the constituent particles of a boosted @xmath3 jet in its center - of - mass frame has a three body decay topology as in the top quark rest frame . on the other hand",
    ", the constituent particle distribution of a qcd jet in its rest frame does not correspond to any physical state and is more likely to be isotropic .",
    "we recluster the energy clusters of a jet to reconstruct subjets in the jet rest frame .",
    "the reclustering is done by using the cambridge - aachen ( ca ) sequential jet reconstruction algorithm  @xcite with a modified distance parameter of @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is defined as the angle between two pseudoparticles in the jet rest frame .",
    "we reject jets that have less than 3 subjets with @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the energy of a subjet in the jet reset frame . in the ideal situation without any pileup effects , this requirement rejects roughly 60% of the qcd jets , while keeping almost all the signal @xmath3 jets .",
    "however , the rejection power drops significantly when the average numbers of multiple interactions per event increases .",
    "when the average pileup at the lhc reaches 50 ( 100 ) per event , more than 70% ( 90% ) of the qcd jets have at least 3 subjets with @xmath20 .",
    "the mass of a jet has a large dependence on the pileup condition , its distribution shifts to higher values when the pileup condition gets worse .",
    "however , this effect is greatly reduced if we calculate the mass of a jet using its subjets in the center of mass frame of the jet , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mjet ] . because of the smaller area covered by its cone size and the isotropic distribution of the constituent particles of qcd jets from pileup in the jet rest frame , a reconstructed subjet in the jet rest frame includes much less deposited energies from additional multiple interactions .",
    "one advantage of reclustering in the jet rest frame is that two nearby energy clusters that have different momenta in the lab frame can be easily separated geometrically after they are boosted back to the center - of - mass frame of the jet if they are originated by different partons from top decaying .",
    "we also point out that the rest frame subjet algorithm is infrared and collinear safe if an infrared and collinear safe jet algorithm is used for the rest frame subjet clustering .",

    "we demonstrate such an application by constructing a bdt variable using the following jet substructure quantities : @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath30 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath36 and @xmath39 .",

    "our results show that top tagger based on jet substructure in the jet rest frame is complementary to other top tagger tools .",
    "reconstructed decays of top quarks to jets can be used to search for np with specific final state signatures . here",
    "we demonstrate such an application by considering a heavy resonance that decays to a @xmath0 final state : @xmath44 , where @xmath5 is a new heavy resonance beyond the sm , such as a new heavy gauge boson @xmath1 or a kk gluon in the randall - sundrum model , etc .",
    "we consider a search for an @xmath5 signal by fully reconstructing the @xmath5 signal candidate in the decay mode where both top quarks decay hadronically .",
    "note that for such high mass ( @xmath45 ) resonance decays , more than 90% of the events have their decay particles from the top decay within a cone of @xmath46 .",
