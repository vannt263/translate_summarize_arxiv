    "the study of superfluidity of either bosons or fermions has been a central topic in the field of ultracold atomic gases , starting from seminal experimental studies on the bose - einstein condensation of bosons @xcite and continuing with investigations of the bcs - bec crossover @xcite .",
    "more recent experiments with two - component fermi gases have addressed the case of a finite population imbalanced , both in three spatial dimensions @xcite and in one dimension @xcite . among the goals of these experiments",
    "is the search for the transition from a fully paired superfluid phase to the normal state and , in particular , for competing pairing states that survive a finite polarization .",
    "these include the sarma state @xcite or the fulde - ferrell - larkin - ovchinnikov ( fflo ) state @xcite .    with the advances optical lattice engineering @xcite , it has also become possible to investigate fermionic pairing states within the framework of the so - called hubbard model . for repulsive onsite interactions",
    "the hope is to reach sufficiently low temperatures to search for pairing states away from half filling @xcite , whereas in the case of attractive interactions , there is a natural tendency to pair formation . besides experiments with homonuclear mixtures , where the pseudo - spin degree of freedom arises from preparing atoms in different hyper - fine states , there is also the possibility of working with heteronuclear mixtures such as , for instance , the @xmath0k-@xmath1li system @xcite . in that case , one deals both finite mass imbalance and population imbalance . on the other hand , bosonic gases in optical lattices",
    "have provided the first example of a quantum phase transition from a mott - insulator to a superfluid state in the context of ultra cold atoms  @xcite , which was subsequently observed in one dimensional setups @xcite as well . in analogy with the fermionic case , both homonuclear and heteronuclear bosonic mixtures",
    "have been realized @xcite ; from a theoretical viewpoint , the two - species bose - hubbard model encompasses a remarkably rich physics , ranging from super - counterflow and antiferromagnetic phases in case of interspecies repulsion @xcite to pair superfluidity and density - wave instabilities in the attractive regime @xcite .    from a theoretical point of view , it is of advantage to consider the one - dimensional case , for which both powerful analytical and numerical methods are available that can provide us with practically exact answers in many regimes . in ultra - cold atomic gases ,",
    "it is also perfectly possible to realize one - dimensional systems experimentally , both for bosons @xcite and fermions @xcite , adding strong motivation to study this case .",
    "moreover one - dimensional systems have been demonstrated to harbor unconventional superfluid phases which are the central topic of this work . in our work , we are interested in three types of superfluid states of two - component systems and their existence in the attractive , asymmetric hubbard model : ( i ) the more conventional fully paired phase , which can be considered as a fluid of cooper pairs , ( ii ) superfluids of larger composite objects such as trimers , and ( iii ) the fflo state in which a superfluid of pairs with finite center - of - mass momentum appears . the first two cases , i.e. , the equal density ( or dimer fluid ) and the trimer fluid , can be realized in both fermi - fermi mixtures @xcite and bose - bose mixtures in one - dimension @xcite while the fflo state exists only in the case of two - component fermi mixtures ( see @xcite and references therein )",
    ". in our study we use numerically exact methods  density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg)@xcite and stochastic series expansion quantum monte carlo @xcite to probe the stability of the above cited phases at a finite population and mass imbalance in the presence of a harmonic trapping potential .",
    "our study complements previous works that mostly focussed on the homogeneous case @xcite .",
    "moreover , we incorporate aspects that are typical of many experiments , namely the possibility of tuning the ratio of the effective masses through the depth of the optical lattice ; the fact that in a mass imbalanced system the two components usually experience a different trapping potential ; the difficulty in controlling the population of the two components to an arbitrary degree of precision , resulting typically in a non - zero global polarization .",
    "finally , we also study the effect of a small but finite temperature on the shell structure and coherence properties of trapped mass - imbalanced two - component gases .    here",
    "we summarize our main results . in the case of fermions and for the bulk system",
    "it is well - known that the fully paired phase is the ground state of a two - component fermi gas away from half filling  @xcite . in the presence of a harmonic trap and at a finite population imbalance , the fully paired phase can only survive in the wings of the particle cloud at small polarizations @xcite , as recently observed in ref .  .",
    "here we show that adding mass imbalance to the system stabilizes the fully paired phase in the trap : if the light particles are the majority species , the fully paired phase occupies the center of the trapped system , in agreement with the grand - canonical phase diagram of the asymmetric hubbard model at a finite spin polarization @xcite .",
    "we further show that a small temperature does not destroy the equal density phase .",
    "the main conclusion is therefore that it is not necessary to enforce the condition of a perfectly balanced gas to observe and study properties of a dimer fluid .",
    "this result applies to both fermions and hard - core bosons .",
    "a particular feature of mass - imbalanced systems in one dimension is that they allow for the formation of bound states of more than two components , which in the two - species hubbard model with equal masses is forbidden .",
    "this can happen for both fermions @xcite and bosons @xcite .",
    "the existence of these states requires commensurate ratios of the densities of heavy particles ( @xmath2 ) versus light ones ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "for instance , a trimer fluid can only be stable if @xmath4 @xcite , where @xmath5 is the density of the pseudo - spin @xmath6 component in a system of length @xmath7 with @xmath8 particles of species @xmath9 .",
    "for the homogeneous system , this sets the global polarization to @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) and it is in fact possible to stabilize this phase in a harmonic trap by enforcing this condition globally as was shown in ref .   at sufficiently low densities .",
    "here we investigate the fate of the trimer fluid upon deviating from the global polarization of @xmath12 , both for the case of fermions and bosons , finding that the trimer fluid rapidly gets pushed into the wings of the gas and subsequently disappears even for very small deviations from eq .",
    "[ eq : comm ] .",
    "therefore , one needs to fine - tune the global polarization to precisely @xmath12 to ensure that a large fraction of particles participates in this state . a difference in the trapping potential for the two components , however , has little effect on the trimer phase . for the case of bosons ,",
    "we demonstrate that the formation of the trimer fluid leaves clear fingerprints in the momentum distribution function , a quantity that is easily accessible in experiments .",
    "finally , concerning the fflo state , we show that it survives the addition of the harmonic trap and the mass imbalance .",
    "similar to the case of a system with mass imbalance only @xcite , this phase occupies the center of the trap in a large parameter regime , corresponding in particular to the case in which heavy particles are the majority ones .",
    "these numerically exact observations are consistent with the known phase diagrams for homogeneous system via a local - density approximation @xcite .",

    "the computation of correlations using the bethe ansatz is generally very difficult , and therefore , the exponents of correlations were first calculated by numerically solving the corresponding the bethe ansatz equations @xcite .",
    "very recently , first analytical results for the fflo correlations from bethe ansatz have been presented in @xcite . in more general models that incorporate the coupling of fermions to a molecular channel @xcite ,",
    "the partially polarized phase is of the fflo type on the bcs side only @xcite .",
    "the fate of the fflo state in coupled one - dimensional systems has been recently addressed @xcite .    for spin - imbalanced systems in one dimension ,",
    "it is by now well - established that there is a two - shell structure in a harmonic trap @xcite .",
    "the central shell is always occupied by the partially polarized phase , while in the wings there is a fully paired phase at low polarizations and a fully polarized phase at large polarizations .",
    "thus , there is a critical polarization @xmath105 at which the shell structure changes ( exactly at @xmath105 , the whole system is in a partially polarized phase ) .",
    "this was first predicted by applying the local density approximation to the exactly known phase diagram @xcite and then confirmed in exact numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "the fflo - type correlations in the partially polarized phase are stable against the presence of a harmonic trap @xcite .",

    "another main difference is the broken particle - hole symmetry of the the mass- and spin - imbalanced mixture with respect to the spin - imbalanced case only .",
    "this has immediate consequences for the shell structure in a harmonic trap . to illustrate this ,",
    "let us resort to the local density approximation ( lda ) , valid if the trapping potential is sufficiently smooth , as it is the case with parabolic potentials whose harmonic oscillator length is much larger than the lattice spacing or the interparticle distance . in the case of a single species and within lda",

    "the resulting paired phase has an exponentially decaying obdm , and a power - law decaying pair - correlation function , @xmath281 a number of numerical and analytical calculations support such a picture , which fully recovers the fermionic case in the tonks - girardeau ( or hardcore ) limit @xmath282 . in the presence of a finite mass imbalance",
    ", the ed paired phase may evolve into a charge - density - wave phase and then into a crystalline phase for specific filling fractions , as explicitly shown in the hardcore case in ref .",

    "the key point here is to qualitatively and quantitatively understand the competition between possible trimer instabilities and the emergence of either phase separation or single species superfluidity as a function of the hopping imbalance , which is expected to play a prominent role as in the fermionic case .",
    "we begin our discussion with the case of hardcore bosons , moving then to the case of softcore bosons in the next sections . ref .   has shown that , in the grand - canonical ensemble , a mixture of hardcore bosons or fermions with mass imbalance @xmath294 shows a direct transition from a trimer liquid phase with fixed polarization @xmath12 to a vacuum phase as the chemical potential is lowered .",
    "hence , within the lda approximation , a trapped mixture can not realize a trimer liquid phase in the trap center unless its polarization is exactly at @xmath12 : indeed , if the polarization differs from @xmath295 , the extra particles of either species can not be accommodated in the trap wings , given that a trimer liquid in the trap center can only be flanked by an empty region .",
    "this condition seems to put a very serious limitation to the possibility of observing a trimer liquid phase in a realistic trapped system , given that , as mentioned above , a fine tuning in the population of the two species is experimentally very hard .",
    "nonetheless , strong signatures of the formation of a trimer liquid phase at @xmath12 can be seen in a broader range of polarizations , and specifically in the momentum distribution .",
    "[ fig : trimerformation - nk0 ] shows a polarization scan at very low temperature in a mixture containing @xmath296 particles and a variable number @xmath120 of @xmath290-particles with @xmath297 .",
    "we chose a very weak trapping potential ( @xmath298 ) , leading to low densities in the system , for which trimer formation is a most robust phenomenon @xcite .",
    "we observe that , as expected from lda , the polarization @xmath295 is achieved in the trap center ( @xmath299 ) only when the global polarization @xmath22 is exactly at the same value .",
    "when the trimer condition on the polarization is satisfied , a trimer liquid appears to form , as shown by an anomaly in the one - body coherence properties , namely a weak suppression in the height of the condensate peak @xmath215 as well as a slight enhancement of its width .",
    "but the most notable feature is that the formation of trimers at polarization @xmath12 influences the whole evolution of the one - body coherence properties for nearby values of @xmath22 .",
    "indeed a sharp kink appears in the height of the condensate peak @xmath287 at @xmath12 , marking a net change of slope in the dependence of this quantity on @xmath22 .",
    "in fact a similar kink is observed for @xmath188 , at which the ed paired phase spreads throughout the trap . that kink is associated with the fact that @xmath290-particles added to the system to give @xmath106",
    "will not form dimers with @xmath247-particles , giving rise to a strong enhancement of @xmath290-particle coherence . on the other hand ,",
    "the further enhancement of coherence for @xmath300 shows that for @xmath301 the @xmath290-particles added to the system have the tendency to form trimer bound states with the @xmath247-particles , and it is only when the trimer formation has been saturated at @xmath12 that the one - body coherence grows faster with increasing @xmath120 , whence the kink at @xmath12 . in principle",
    "the extra @xmath290-particles added to give @xmath302 might form quartets ( 3 @xmath290 s and 1 @xmath247 ) , which would lead to an another kink in the condensate peak with p becomes lower than @xmath303 ( saturation of quartets ) , and the same for bound states formed from even more particles . on the other hand the binding energy of these complexes , if finite , will be increasingly low as the size of the complex increases , so that the kinks in the @xmath287 curve will be increasingly weak .      in the present section we focus on softcore bosons , and we address the experimentally relevant case of @xmath81rb mixtures confined in species - dependent optical lattices . as discussed in sec .",

    "<S> we present a systematic investigation of attractive binary mixtures in presence of both spin- and mass - imbalance in one dimensional setups described by the hubbard model . after discussing typical cold atomic experimental realizations and the relation between microscopic and effective parameters , we study several many - body features of trapped fermi - fermi and bose - bose mixtures such as density profiles , momentum distributions and correlation functions by means of numerical density - matrix - renormalization - group and quantum monte carlo simulations . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we focus on the stability of fulde - ferrell - larkin - ovchinnikov , dimer and trimer fluids in inhomogeneous situations , as typically realized in cold gas experiments due to the harmonic confinement . </S>",
    "<S> we finally consider possible experimental signatures of these phases both in the presence of a finite polarization and of a finite temperature . </S>"
