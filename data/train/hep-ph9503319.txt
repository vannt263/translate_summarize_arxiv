    "the standard model(sm ) has achieved great success recent years .",
    "however , there is still a vast interest beyond standard model . it is well known that the process @xmath0 is extremely sensitive to new physics beyond the standard model@xcite .",
    "it has been argued that this experiment provides more information about restrictions on the standard model , 2-higgs doublet model , supersymmetry , technicolor and etc .",
    "since the top quark is much heavier than other fermions , and its interactions may be quite sensitive to new physics , the interactions of the top quark are of special importance . in ref.@xcite , a right - handed coupling of the top - bottom charged current",
    "is added to the standard model(sm ) .",
    "based on this , the authors give out the constraints to right - handed top quark current by @xmath13 decay .",
    "in fact , the right handed current is also a low energy phenomena of @xmath14 left - right symmetric model@xcite . in this model ,",
    "the right handed charged current is induced by the @xmath15 mixing in addition to the usual left - handed current in the standard model .",
    "interference of the right- and left - handed currents in the penguin diagram enables a chirality - flip by the top quark mass @xmath5 inside the loop , and therefore leads to an amplitude proportional to @xmath5@xcite .",
    "( in standard model , the amplitude is proportional to the mass of the bottom or strange quark , because the pure ( v - a ) structure of the charged currents requires the chirality - flip to proceed only through the mass of the initial or the final state quark . ) therefore , large contributions from top - bottom quark right - handed current to @xmath9 amplitude occur . to first order approximation ,",
    "this just like to add a right - handed current to top - bottom quark coupling in sm .",
    "recently the cleo collaboration has measured the inclusive branching ratio of @xmath9 to be@xcite @xmath16 corresponding to 95% confidence level , the range is @xmath17 .",
    "this is a more stringent constraints compared with previous cleo experiments@xcite cited by the above papers@xcite .",
    "furthermore , with more precise experiments , a more accurate theoretical calculation of this decay rate is also needed .",
    "the inclusive @xmath18 decay rate is often assumed to be well described by the spectator model , where the b quark goes a radiative decay .",
    "the qcd corrections to this decay have been calculated to leading logarithmic accuracy by many authors@xcite , and are known to enhance the decay rate within sm by a factor of 3 - 4 .",
    "this enhancement , however , is subject to large uncertainties due to many reasons@xcite",
    ". one of these reasons is the qcd running from top quark scale to w boson scale , which has been discussed in sm by ref.@xcite , in 2-higgs doublet model by ref.@xcite , and in supersymmetry case by ref.@xcite .",
    "this contribution which is usually considered as a next - leading order effect was found to give an additional enhancement up to 20% in the case of a much heavy top quark mass .    in our present paper , by introducing a right - handed charged current to top - bottom couplings , we recalculate the @xmath9 decay including qcd running from @xmath1 to @xmath2 , in addition to corrections from @xmath2 to @xmath4 , in order to give a more complete leading log result in this model .",
    "since the branching ratio is proportional to @xmath19 , it is more complicated than that in sm or other models .",
    "finally more recent cleo experiment is used to give more precise restrictions to this anomalous top quark coupling .    in the next section ,",
    "we first integrate out the top quark , generating an effective five - quark theory . by using the renormalization group equation",
    ", we run the effective field theory down to the w - scale where the weak bosons are removed .",
    "then we continue running the effective field theory down to b - quark scale to include qcd corrections from @xmath2 to @xmath4 . in section 3",
    ", the rate of radiative @xmath20 decay is obtained .",
    "section 4 is a short summary .",
    "in standard model and many other models , there is no flavor changing neutral current at tree level .",
    "it is only occurred through electroweak loop . in standard model lagrangian ,",
    "the relevant charged current in @xmath21 gauge reads @xmath22\\phi_+",
    "\\nonumber\\\\      &   + & h.c .. \\label{2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where v represents the @xmath23 unitary kobayashi - maskawa matrix , @xmath24 and @xmath25 denote the diagonalized quark mass matrices , the subscript @xmath26 and @xmath27 denote left - handed and right - handed quarks , respectively .",
    "this charged current , which is the main cause of flavor changing neutral current , is pure left - handed .    like ref.@xcite , a phenomenological coupling of the right - handed top and bottom quarks to the w boson",
    "is introduced : @xmath28 with @xmath29 denoting the strength of this additional coupling . using this interaction ( [ 3 ] ) together with ( [ 2 ] )",
    ", we performed the qcd corrections to @xmath18 decay .    at first , we integrate out the top quark , generating an effective five quark theory , introducing dimension-5 and dimension-6 effective operators as to include effects of the absent top quark .",
    "higher dimension operators are suppressed by factor of @xmath30 , here @xmath31 characterizes the interesting external momentum of b quark @xmath32 . for leading order of @xmath33 ,",
    "dimension-6 operators are good enough to make a complete basis of operators@xcite is a new operator compared with sm case . ] : @xmath34 where @xmath35 stands for @xmath36 and the covariant derivative is defined as @xmath37 with @xmath38 denoting the qcd coupling constant .",
    "the tensor @xmath39 appearing in @xmath40 assumes the following lorentz structure , the index @xmath41 ranging from 1 to 4 : @xmath42    in our following calculations , we try to work in a background field @xmath21 gauge ( with @xmath43)@xcite , in order to maintain explicit gauge invariance in calculations of anomalous dimensions .",
    "furthermore the usually trilinear interaction between photon , w boson , and would - be goldstone boson vanish in this gauge .",
    "so that , we did not include operators which involve both w boson and would - be goldstone boson in one operator , like @xmath44 . with the above operators ,",
    "we can write down our effective hamiltonian as @xmath45 the coefficients @xmath46 of operators can be calculated from full theory by matching conditions , keeping only leading orders of @xmath30@xcite .",
    "terms proportional to @xmath47 are from right handed current . since @xmath48 is a very large value , it is very convenient for us to keep only leading orders of @xmath48 .",
    "this is also the reason why only top - bottom right - handed charge current is introduced , while other up - down , charm - strange right - handed currents are ignored .",
    "@xmath49 the other coefficients of operators are all from the integrations of electroweak loops .",
    "terms like @xmath50 in coefficients of operators @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 vanish here , because of the matching scale @xmath54 .",
    "they will be regenerated at lower scales by renormalization group running of electroweak later .",
    "the other logarithms are all from the finite part integration of loops , for there are two different mass scale particles in one loop . @xmath55 where @xmath56 .",
    "when @xmath57 , the above results ( [ coe1 ] ) , ( [ coe ] ) reduce to that of sm case@xcite .    the renormalization group equation satisfied by the coefficient functions @xmath58 is @xmath59 the solution to this renormalization group equation ( [ ren ] ) appears in obvious matrix notation as @xmath60 c(\\mu_1),\\label{solu}\\ ] ] where the anomalous dimension matrix @xmath61 is calculated in practice by requiring renormalization group equations for green functions with insertions of composite operators to be satisfied order by order in perturbation theory@xcite .",
    "@xmath62 these mixings are all between operators ( q , r , w ) induced by tree - diagram and operators ( o , p ) induced by loop - diagram . in order to see how the renormalization group method is accomplished , we neglect the proper qcd corrections for the moment , so that we can take into account only the above entries of anomalous dimensions .",
    "insert this matrix to eqn.([solu ] ) , we find the following relations : @xmath63    here the renormalization group equation reproduces the @xmath50 terms in the coefficients of operators at equation ( [ coe ] ) which vanished at @xmath54 .",
    "this proves the consistence of the whole calculation .",
    "the qcd anomalous dimensions for each of the operators in our basis are@xcite : @xmath64    @xmath65    notice here only the anomalous dimensions relevant to @xmath66 are new to the sm case . to proceed with such complicated anomalous dimensions with so many operators ,",
    "the algebra computation code reduce is used . combining the above three matrices ( [ weak ] , [ anom1],[anom2 ] ) into one large 18@xmath6718 matrix , we diagonalize it analytically to give 18 eigenvalues and 18 eigenvectors . using equation ( [ solu ] )",
    ", one can have the coefficients of operators at @xmath68 .",
    "all analytic expressions of coefficients at this scale , which are functions of coefficients at @xmath54 , are included in the appendix .    in order",
    "to continue running the basis operator coefficients down to lower scales , one must integrate out the weak gauge bosons and would - be goldstone bosons at @xmath68 scale . from matching conditions",
    ", one finds the following relations between coefficient functions just below(- ) and above(+ ) @xmath68@xcite : @xmath69 the operators involving goldstone @xmath70 and w bosons are absent after this matching .",
    "in addition to these , there are new four - quark operators from the matching@xcite : @xmath71 with coefficients @xmath72 although only coefficient of @xmath73 is not zero , the other operators should also be included , for their mixing through renormalization group running .    to simplify the calculation and compare with the previous results , equations of motion(eom)@xcite",
    "is used to reduce all the remaining two - quark operators to the gluon and photon magnetic moment operators @xmath74 and @xmath51 . neglecting the strange quark mass in comparison with the bottom quark mass ,",
    "we obtain the on - shell equivalence relations : @xmath75    to be comparable with previous results without qcd corrections from @xmath1 to @xmath2 , operators @xmath51 , @xmath74 are rewritten as @xmath76 , @xmath77 like ref.@xcite , @xmath78 then the operator basis now consists of 8 operators . using eqn.([14 ] ) ( [ rela ] ) together with ( [ 23 ] ) in the appendix , the effective hamiltonian appearing just below the w - scale is easily drawn out : @xmath79 with @xmath80 @xmath81\\right.}&\\nonumber\\\\ & \\displaystyle { + \\left[-\\frac{9}{2 } c_{o_{lr}^1}(m_t )",

    "if qcd correction from @xmath5 to @xmath2 is neglected[by setting @xmath83 in the above equations ( [ c2]),([c3 ] ) ] , the results are reduced exactly to those the previous authors gave@xcite .",
    "the qcd corrections from @xmath68 to @xmath84 have been a subject of many papers@xcite .",
    "it has attracted great interest recent years , since most qcd corrections come from this stage . for a long time , there are some discrepancies in this calculation , for it is rather lengthy calculation involving 2-loop diagrams . until recently",
    ", it is completely resolved , and a complete leading log result is given@xcite . here , we are free to utilize these results , so the coefficients of operators at @xmath84 scale are @xmath85 with @xmath86 , @xmath87 @xmath88 here @xmath89gev is used .",
    "following previous authors@xcite , one obtains the @xmath90 decay rate normalized to the quite well established semileptonic decay rate @xmath91 .",
    "@xmath92 then @xmath93 where @xmath94 and @xmath95 correspond to the phase space factor and the one - loop qcd correction to the semileptonic decay , respectively@xcite .",
    "the electromagnetic fine structure constant evaluated at the @xmath20 quark scale takes value as @xmath96 .",
    "if we take experimental result @xmath97@xcite , the branching ratios of @xmath98 is found .",
    "compared with the previous results without qcd running from @xmath5 to @xmath2@xcite , the branching ratio is more sensitive to the value of @xmath29 .",
    "it is no longer a pure enhancement like sm case .",
    "it is rather suppressed when @xmath6 takes large value , for example , when @xmath99 , the branching ratio is only about @xmath8 of that with qcd correction from @xmath5 to @xmath2 neglected .",
    "while when @xmath6 takes small value , the branching ratio is rather enhanced , especially when @xmath100 , it is enhanced 11% corresponding to sm case .",
    "since the right - handed current contribution is proportional to @xmath101 , the whole qcd correction to @xmath13 decay is always a large enhancement .    in fig 1",
    ", the branching ratio of @xmath18 is displayed as functions of @xmath29 with @xmath102gev@xcite .",
    "the three lines correspond to @xmath103 .",
    "they are all parabolic lines , because @xmath104 is proportional to @xmath105 , and @xmath106 is proportional to @xmath29 .",
    "that the three lines are very close to each other implies that the branching ratios are not sensitive to the values of @xmath82 .",
    "fig.2 is branching ratios displayed as functions of @xmath29 , with different top quark masses 158gev , 174gev and 190gev .",
    "the qcd coupling constant is @xmath107 . since contributions from right - handed current are proportional to @xmath108 , the three lines in fig.2 diverge in the region far from @xmath109 , but nearly converge to a same line when @xmath110 .    with the recent cleo experiments of @xmath18 decay , a new constraint to right - handed current can be found . from fig.1 and fig.2 ,",
    "the parameter @xmath29 is constrained in two small windows @xmath111 and @xmath112 . compared with results without qcd corrections from @xmath5 to @xmath2@xcite , the whole line transfers to left side(towards minus ) .",
    "so the windows also transfer to minus side .",
    "most allowed values of @xmath29 are negative .",
    "in the above , we have introduced an anomalous right - handed current to top , bottom quarks and w boson coupling in the sm , and given the full leading log qcd corrections(including qcd running from @xmath1 to @xmath2 ) to @xmath13 decay in this model .",
    "the qcd corrections from @xmath1 to @xmath2 to @xmath13 decay enhance the decay rate in small values of @xmath29 like in sm case ; but suppress the decay rate when @xmath29 takes larger value .",
    "the whole qcd correction still makes a large enhancement .",
    "the restrictions from @xmath18 decay to anomalous top quark coupling are strict , only two narrow windows are allowed .",
    "it is shown that the decay @xmath18 has been the most restrictive process so far in constraining the parameters of the right - handed current of top quark .",
    "if a complete qcd next - leading log result of @xmath18 decay is performed , one can expect to obtain more precise results from @xmath113 decay by freely using our above results .",
    "the authors thank prof .",
    "z.m . qiu , x.c song , and dr . q.h .",
    "zhang for helpful discussions .",
    "we quote here the results of the coefficients of operators at @xmath114 scale . the w bosons and would - be goldstone bosons are not integrated out yet .",
    "@xmath115 here @xmath116 .",
    "the factor of @xmath117 in some of these expressions arises from mixing between operators induced by tree diagrams and those by loop diagrams",
