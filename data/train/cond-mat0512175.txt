    "since gibbs @xcite established the ensemble theory of statistical mechanics , there has arisen the problem as to whether it has the ability to describe phase transitions @xcite .",
    "let us investigate the problem through the famous example , i.e. , the conventional low-@xmath6 superconductivity , which can be described by the so - called bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) hamiltonian @xcite , @xmath7where @xmath8 denotes the energy relative to fermi level , @xmath9 the coupling strength , @xmath10 and @xmath11 ( @xmath12 and @xmath13 ) the destruction ( creation ) operators for the electrons with up and down spins , respectively . here",
    ", the notation @xmath14 expresses that the hamiltonian is a function of @xmath10 , @xmath15 , @xmath12 , and @xmath16 .    for bcs superconductivity",
    ", what is the most important physically is that the hamiltonian @xmath14 will remain invariant under the transformation,@xmath17where @xmath18this invariance is known as gauge symmetry . as a direct consequence of this symmetry ,",
    "one has@xmath19where @xmath20 denotes the gibbs ensemble average with respect to the hamiltonian @xmath14 , and @xmath21is the statistical density operator where @xmath22 with @xmath23 and @xmath24 being the boltzmann constant and temperature , respectively . to prove eq .",
    "( [ zero ] ) , it is sufficient to heed that @xmath25    eq .",
    "( [ zero ] ) indicates that the electron - pair amplitude @xmath26 can never become nonzero according to gibbs ensemble theory , in other words , there can not happen superconductivity for the bcs hamiltonian of eq .",
    "( [ bcs ] ) within gibbs ensemble theory no matter how low the temperature is .",
    "this proves definitely that gibbs ensemble theory has no ability to describe phase transitions .",
    "even so , it is still hoped to do , as least as possible , some modification to gibbs theory so that it could describe phase transitions . up to now , there are two kinds of modification , they both arise from the theoretical studies on the so - called ising model @xcite , and become the popular and predominant believes about phase transitions in the current world of statistical physics .",
    "the first is to introduce the thermodynamic limit in the end of calculation @xcite , that is,@xmath27where the @xmath28 means to take the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 constant ) after performing the trace .",
    "because@xmath32irrespective of the magnitudes of @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 ( @xmath14 is invariant under gauge transformation , and that is true independently of @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath36 , namely , the gauge symmetry has nothing to do with @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 . ) , one has@xmath37therefore , this kind of modification can not make gibbs ensemble theory have the ability to describe phase transitions .",
    "indeed , the thermodynamic limit is important for calculating the statistical average of observable , but itself alone is insufficient to act as the physical criterion for phase transitions .",
    "the second is to introduce both the thermodynamic limit and an auxiliary external field @xcite ,    @xmath38    where , as pointed out by huang @xcite , the limit @xmath39 must be taken after the thermodynamic limit @xmath29 . the purpose of introducing an auxiliary external field @xmath40 is to break the gauge symmetry of the system , as can be easily seen from the term,@xmath41since the gauge symmetry has been broken with regard to the entire hamiltonian , @xmath42 in so far as the auxiliary external field @xmath40 is infinitesimal but nonzero , the trace and the limit @xmath29 of eq.([pair ] ) become nonzero .",
    "further , if the limit @xmath39 does not tend to zero , the electron - pair amplitude @xmath43 will get nonzero .",
    "one thus concludes that there appear cooper pairs in the system , and that the system has gone into the superconducting phase .",
    "however , this conclusion can not hold in physics , for the modification suffers the serious problem : the limit procedure employed by eq.([pair ] ) is physically equivalent to the scenario that an infinitesimal auxiliary external field is first added to the system so as to induce the symmetry of the system to break down , and taken off from the system finally .",
    "but , in the actual situation , the inducement of such an external field is unnecessary , the symmetry itself breaks down spontaneously and does not need any help of external force .",
    "anyhow , this kind of modification contains unphysical operations , and thus can not be accepted in principle .",
    "here , it is also significant and worth while to give a brief discussion to the two - dimensional ising model because it can be solved exactly within the two modifications,@xmath44 where @xmath45 denotes the spin variable on site @xmath46 , the symbol @xmath47 means that the sites @xmath46 and @xmath48  are the nearest neighbors , and @xmath49 is the exchange coupling between a nearest - neighbor pair of spins .",
    "as is well known , onsager @xcite proved rigorously that the specific heat of the ising hamiltonian @xmath50 is singular at @xmath51 within the first modification of gibbs ensemble theory .",
    "it hints that the system might undergo a paramagnetic - ferromagnetic phase transition at @xmath6 in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "however , just as eqs .",
    "( [ zero1][zero2 ] ) , the magnetization @xmath52 , @xmath53is always equal to zero due to the fact that the parity symmetry of @xmath54 with respect to @xmath55 and @xmath56 has nothing to do with the magnitude of @xmath34 where @xmath34 represents the total number of sites .",
    "( [ mising ] ) proves definitely that there is no paramagnetic - ferromagnetic phase transition at any temperature within the first modification of gibbs ensemble theory even if the specific heat is singular .",
    "the above proof also shows that it can not be solved within the framework of the first modification whether or not the onset of the singularity at @xmath57 manifests a phase transition . in order to justify that the phenomenon occurring at @xmath58 is a phase transition , yang @xcite went beyond the first modification and turned to the second one , which was , in fact ,",
    "suggested originally by ising himself @xcite in studying the one - dimensional ising model .",
    "wonderfully , yang succeeded in proving rigorously that@xmath59where @xmath60 stands for an external magnetic field .",
    "mathematically , it seems reasonable to say from eq .",
    "( [ mnzero ] ) that a paramagnetic - ferromagnetic phase transition will occur at @xmath58 . nevertheless , as pointed out above , eq .",
    "( [ mnzero ] ) imports unphysical operations from the introduction of the external field @xmath60 , and this leads to the result that the phase transition will not occur automatically but has to be driven and decided from outside the system , which directly contradicts the basic experimental fact that any phase transition occurs itself spontaneously .",
    "therefore , the second modification , or rather ising s criterion , can not be used as a physical criterion to justify whether there exists a paramagnetic - ferromagnetic phase transition at @xmath58 .",
    "it should be stressed again that it is the two rigorous works of refs .",
    "onsager and @xcite that establish the two kinds of modification to the gibbs ensemble theory .    on all accounts , the two kinds of modification must both be discarded , and it is necessary to modify or extend gibbs ensemble theory anew .",
    "that is just the main purpose of this paper .",
    "recently , gibbs ensemble theory has been extended by c. tsallis and his followers with the conception of nonextensive entropy tsallis1,tsallis2,tsallis3 , which is being under controversy . in this paper , as a personal review , we would like to suppose another possible extension of the gibbs ensemble theory so that it can provide a reasonable description to phase transitions and spontaneous symmetry breaking ( ssb ) .      also , there is a macroscopic theory for phase transitions , i.e. , landau phenomenological theory @xcite .",
    "phenomenological as it is , landau theory succeeds in providing a unified picture for all the second - kind phase transitions , e.g. , superconductivity , superfluidity , magnetism , and structural phase transitions .",
    "physically , landau picture consists of two basic notions : order parameter and variational principle .",
    "order parameter describes the degree of order of the system , it is zero in the disordered phase , and nonzero in the ordered one .",
    "variational principle yields the equation of motion of order parameter and controls the evolution of order parameter with temperature , a system must arrive at the minimum of helmholtz or gibbs free energy in its stable state .",
    "according to this picture , a system will evolve with the evolution of its order parameters , and produce phase transitions spontaneously , i.e. , without any help or drive from outside the system . in short , order parameter and variational principle are two characteristics of landau theory .",
    "on the other hand , landau pointed out that a phase transition of the second kind reflects physically the change in symmetry of the system : the disordered phase has a higher symmetry than the ordered one .",
    "he found that this change in symmetry can be described through the representations of the symmetry group , a phase transition corresponds to a representation transformation , different phases will realize different representations , respectively .",
    "accordingly , landau established the relation between the order parameter and the representation . using this relation ,",
    "it can be easily determined from the variational principle which representation will be realized at a certain temperature . representation transformation and spontaneous symmetry breaking are the other two characteristics of landau theory .    to sum up ,",
    "a system will select and realize automatically different representations at different temperatures according to the variational principle of order parameter .",
    "that is the mechanism for phase transitions discovered by landau theory , it crystallizes landau s ideas about phase transitions : order parameter , variational principle , representation transformation , and spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "theoretically , this mechanism gives a reasonable answer to the problem why a phase transition or ssb can happen at a certain temperature .",
    "in applications , it also agrees quite well with various phase transitions , its effectiveness and universality are well known to condensed matter physicists . in a word ,",
    "landau s ideas on phase transitions are successful and of great value in physics !    regrettably , it is impossible to deduce landau theory from gibbs ensemble theory because there is no variational principle of order parameter within the latter .",
    "this demonstrates again the deficiency of gibbs ensemble theory .",
    "in fact , this deficiency was pointed out by born and fucks @xcite early in 1938 . in 1937",
    ", mayer @xcite published his famous paper on gas - liquid transition , which is based directly on gibbs ensemble theory .",
    "this work was seriously doubted and questioned by born and fucks  @xcite : how can the gas molecules ` know ' when they have to coagulate to form a liquid and solid ?  obviously , owing to lack of landau mechanism , it is hard for gibbs ensemble theory to answer the question posed by born and fucks .",
    "gibbs ensemble theory should be extended to incorporate the landau s ideas so as to describe phase transitions and answer the question posed by born and fucks .",
    "that is another intention of this paper .",
    "in order to describe phase transitions and spontaneous symmetry breaking , we shall , as a personal review , extend gibbs ensemble theory with three hypotheses , which can be stated , taking the bcs superconductivity as an instance , as follows .",
    "the system hamiltonian is represented by @xmath61 , @xmath62 where @xmath63 here @xmath64 is an internal field of the system , it is also the order parameter for bcs superconductivity .",
    "evidently , @xmath61 is not invariant under the gauge transformation of @xmath65 as long as @xmath66 , namely , the gauge symmetry will be broken for @xmath67 if @xmath68 .",
    "from now on , we shall call @xmath69 the phase - transition operator , for sake of convenience .",
    "the statistical average of an observable @xmath70 is defined as @xmath71 we remark that the average is now a function of both temperature and order parameter , which is expressed explicitly by the two arguments of @xmath72 .    ( 3 ) .",
    "the order parameter @xmath40 is determined by the minimum of the entropy of the system , @xmath73where @xmath74 denotes the entropy , @xmath75as a function of the order parameter , the entropy controls the evolution of state of the system with temperature .",
    "the first hypothesis means that the system hamiltonian can take different representations at different temperatures , e.g. , it can take the symmetric representation ( @xmath76 ) at a high temperature , and the asymmetric representation ( @xmath68 ) at a low temperature . which representation it will take is determined by the third hypothesis .",
    "after the representation is so determined , the statistical average can be calculated with respect to this representation , as stated in the second hypothesis .",
    "obviously , the extended theory will reduce to the original one if @xmath77 , that is to say , the original theory holds only for the normal phase of the system .",
    "the broken - symmetry phase will be described by the extended theory .    within the framework of the extended ensemble theory",
    ", a system will realize different representations of the same system hamiltonian at different temperatures according to the principle of least entropy with respect to order parameter , this mechanism for phase transitions is , in spirit , the same as that given by landau phenomenological theory ; hence , it can be said that landau mechanism has been incorporated into the extended ensemble theory . also , because the order parameter is an internal field of the system itself , symmetry breaking will occur in a completely spontaneous way rather than forced by an external field , there is no unphysical operation within the extended theory . in a word ,",
    "the extended ensemble theory is conceptionally in accordance with landau s ideas on phase transitions : order parameter , variational principle , representation transformation , and spontaneous symmetry breaking .    in sec .",
    "[ popt ] , we shall show further that phase transitions originate physically from the wave nature of matter .",
    "now , let us establish the relationship between the extended ensemble theory and thermodynamics , it can be implemented as follows .",
    "first , the internal energy @xmath78 can be obtained from eq .",
    "( [ average ] ) , replacing @xmath70 by the hamiltonian @xmath14 .",
    "it is a function of temperature @xmath79 and volume @xmath33 , that is , @xmath80 from the internal energy @xmath81 , the specific heat at constant volume , @xmath82 , can be calculated through@xmath83    then , we can obtain the thermodynamical entropy @xmath84,@xmath85 it is worth paying attention to the significant difference between the thermodynamical entropy @xmath84 and the statistical entropy @xmath74 defining in eq .",
    "( [ entropy ] ) : @xmath74 measures the degree of order of the system , whereas @xmath84 measures the amount of heat absorbed or rejected by the system , i.e. , @xmath86 ; besides , @xmath74 contains the basic information of the system , it controls the evolution of state of the system , as a consequence , @xmath87 derives itself from @xmath74 .    at last , we arrive at@xmath88where @xmath89 is the helmholtz free energy of the system , with @xmath24 and @xmath33 as its natural variables . as a thermodynamic potential of the system",
    ", @xmath89 can generate other thermodynamic quantities .",
    "by such a way , the extended ensemble theory connects with thermodynamics .    in the end of this section ,",
    "let us explain why we choose the bcs model rather than the ising model as the starting instance to develop the theory for phase transitions and spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "as is well known , ising model @xmath50 is a classical discrete hamiltonian .",
    "simple as it is mathematically , it is , however , ill defined from the point of view of physics .",
    "on one hand , a classical hamiltonian , @xmath90 where @xmath91 and @xmath92 denote the generalized coordinates and momenta of the system , must be continuous  in phase space , that is to say , @xmath93 is a continuous function of @xmath91 and @xmath92 ; there does not exist any classical system which corresponds to a discrete hamiltonian ; therefore , @xmath94 does not correspond to a classical system . on the other hand ,",
    "the discrete quantity @xmath95 is not a quantum operator but a pure integer variable , therefore , @xmath50 does not correspond to a quantum system , either . in a word",
    ", ising model can not correspond to any physical system ; its solution , whether rigorous or not , has no real physical relevance @xcite , which was , in fact , realized and pointed out as the `` ising disease '' by people early in 1940 s and 1950 s @xcite .    to understand that point further ,",
    "let us first suppose that ising model could represent a real physical system , and then analyze the statistical properties of this system in detail .",
    "first , if the system is not placed in an external magnetic field , then , according to the onsager s solution ising , huang , its specific heat will diverge logarithmically at @xmath51 ; however , as indicated by eq .",
    "( [ mising ] ) , there appears no spontaneous magnetization bellow @xmath6 , namely , the state of the system will remain nonmagnetic at any temperature , whether @xmath96 or @xmath97 .",
    "there is no paramagnetic - ferromagnetic phase transition in the ising system if it is not placed in an external magnetic field , though its specific heat is singular .",
    "that is the first characteristic behavior of the ising system .",
    "secondly , if the system is placed in an external magnetic field , then , according to the yang s solution @xcite , there will appear an induced magnetization bellow @xmath6 .",
    "that is to say , the ising system will transform from a paramagnetic state at @xmath96 into a ferromagnetic state at @xmath97 when it is placed in an external magnetic field , here , the transformation is an induced transformation other than a spontaneous phase transition .",
    "that is the second characteristic behavior of the ising system . in sum ,",
    "an ising system will exhibit two distinct behaviors , respectively , depending on whether the system is placed in an external magnetic field or not .",
    "it will exhibit the first characteristic behavior in the case without the application of any external magnetic field and the second one in the case with the application of an external magnetic field .",
    "the two behaviors should be checked experimentally with respect to the same physical system .",
    "however , such a physical system that can simultaneously show both the two characteristic behaviors of the ising model has never been observed and reported experimentally . in other words , there does not exist the supposed ising system in nature at all !",
    "that is not surprising , it just reflects the ill definition of the ising model . here , it should be pointed out that the solutions of onsager and yang are not identical but essentially different from each other , whether in the sense of mathematics or in the sense of physics : in the limit @xmath98 , the yang s solution can not reduce to the onsager s solution , as can be easily seen by comparing eq .",
    "( mising ) and eq .",
    "( [ mnzero ] ) ; they represent the statistical properties of the ising system with and without the interaction of an external magnetic field , respectively .    needless to say ,",
    "an ising system is completely distinguishable from a real physical system of phase transition . for the latter",
    ", the transition happens itself spontaneously , needing no inducement of a corresponding external field .",
    "evidently , this nature of phase transitions is neither the same as the first characteristic behavior of the ising system , i.e. , a singular specific heat but no phase transition , nor the same as the second characteristic behavior of the ising system , i.e. , a transformation induced but not spontaneous .",
    "there are clear and definite discrepancies between the statistical behavior of a real physical system of phase transition and those of the ising system .",
    "any phase transition can not be described by ising model .",
    "of course , if one disregards physically the ill definition of ising model , the distinction between the solutions of onsager and yang , and the discrepancies between the statistical behavior of a real physical system of phase transition and those of the ising system , he can simulate some phase transitions and critical phenomena quite well with ising model kadanoff1,kadanoff2,kadanoff3,wilson1,wilson2,wilson3,wilson4,wilson5,fisher .    theoretically , ising model is ill defined ; experimentally , ising system does not exist in nature at all .",
    "that is the reason why we do not choose it as the starting instance to develop the theory of phase transitions and ssb . as for the bcs model @xcite ,",
    "quite the contrary , it is of high value in theory because it contributes a new quantum concept , i.e. , cooper pairs , which is profound and rather hard to understand theoretically but yet verified exactly by the quantized flux experiments .",
    "actually , it is the bcs theory that began our microscopic understanding of phase transitions .",
    "although ising s criterion for phase transitions is problematic in physics , it is much suggestive in mathematics , indeed .",
    "to some degree , it can be said that the present modification is just equivalent to substituting the external field proposed by ising with an internal field determined by the system itself , as can be seen from expanding the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( hprime ) to the linear term of @xmath40 and then comparing it with eq .",
    "( exfield ) .",
    "let us first apply the extended ensemble theory to the ideal fermi gas .",
    "it is the simplest case , and we shall see that this case is exactly solvable .    for the ideal fermi gas , there is no interaction ( @xmath99 ) , eq .",
    "( [ bcs ] ) reduces to @xmath100where @xmath101 with @xmath52 and @xmath102 being the mass of the fermions and the chemical potential of the system , respectively .    to facilitate the calculation of the entropy , we reformulated eq .",

    "( [ sphi1 ] ) and ( [ variation ] ) , it follows that @xmath109 which is the equation of order parameter .",

    "( [ increment ] ) , thereby , this solution corresponds to a stable phase .",
    "observe that the order parameter @xmath77 when all @xmath115 , one recognizes immediately that this phase is just the normal phase of the system , which can also be seen from the following equation , @xmath118we are familiar with the properties of this normal phase from the standard books on quantum statistical mechanics .",
    "what it is worth stressing here is that the normal phase is proved to be stable at any temperature within the framework of the extended ensemble theory . of course",
    ", that is reasonable , and just what we expect .    as to the other solutions",
    ", they also have physical senses though they correspond to instable phases because the entropies for them are not minimal .",
    "let us first discuss the phase with all @xmath119 or @xmath120 .",
    "we find @xmath121    where @xmath122 with @xmath123 .",
    "that is to say , the temperature of the system goes negative .",
    "this shows that negative temperatures root from the same microscopic mechanism as that for phase transitions , so we call this instable phase the negative - temperature phase . in comparison ,",
    "the normal phase is said to be the positive - temperature phase ( @xmath124 ) .",
    "this negative - temperature phase can not be realized physically because its internal energy is unbounded above .",
    "apart from the negative - temperature phase , all the other instable phases are partially negative - temperature phases , which means that the particles of the system are distributed partially among the negative - temperature ( single - particle ) states , and partially among the positive - temperature ( single - particle ) states , @xmath125that is to say , some of the states take @xmath126 or @xmath116 , the others take @xmath127 or @xmath120 . each @xmath128 with @xmath115 or @xmath116 represents a positive - temperature state , and each @xmath128 with @xmath129 or @xmath120 represents a negative - temperature state . because the partially negative - temperature phase is an instable phase , it can emit photons when particles transfer from a negative - temperature state into a positive - temperature one .",
    "therefore , a partially negative - temperature system can constitute a laser .    to make that point more specified ,",
    "let us consider a semiconductor that is described by the following hamiltonian , @xmath130where @xmath131 denotes the energy - band index , @xmath132 the energy of the electrons in the @xmath131th band relative to the fermi level of the system , and @xmath133 the annihilation operator of the electrons with momentum @xmath128 and spin @xmath134 in the @xmath131th band . replacing the @xmath135 of eq .",
    "( [ dfactor ] ) with @xmath136and following the same procedure as for the ideal fermi gas , one can easily get @xmath137where @xmath138 .",
    "suppose that there are , for example , two electrons per site .",
    "if the system is at zero temperature and stays in the normal phase where all @xmath139 or @xmath116 , the valence band , i.e. , the @xmath126th band , is fully filled , the conduction band , i.e. the @xmath140st band , and all the other higher bands are empty .",
    "this is the well - known picture for semiconductors ( or insulators ) , which is depicted in fig . 1 .",
    "now , let us consider such a partially negative - temperature phase , @xmath141if this phase is at zero temperature , the conduction band is fully filled , all the other bands are empty .",
    "it implies that the population is inverted between the valence and conduction bands , which is depicted in fig .",
    "as mentioned above , such a population - inversion phase is instable , it will finally turn into the stable phase , i.e. , the normal phase , with the electrons in the conduction band hopping into the valence band and simultaneously releasing energies to the surroundings .",
    "it will make a laser if the energies are released by means of emitting photons .",
    "that is somewhat an ideal semiconductor laser , it is a two - level  system , a more realistic laser can be achieved in the so - called three - level  system,@xmath142where the @xmath126th and @xmath143nd bands are partially filled , the @xmath140st band is empty , which is depicted in fig .",
    ", the population is not inverted between the @xmath126th and @xmath143nd bands , i.e. , the population of the @xmath143nd band is less than that of the @xmath126th band , but it is inverted between the @xmath140st and @xmath144nd bands .",
    "this kind of three - levelsemiconductor laser has been realized in experiments @xcite .",
    "for this reason , we call the partially negative - temperature phase the laser phase . obviously , a laser phase can not be described by the original gibbs ensemble theory @xcite .    traditionally , negative temperatures are something obscure , and hard to understand why they are higher or hotter than positive temperatures purcell , ramsey , pathria . from the viewpoint of the extended ensemble theory ,",
    "the reason is that both the negative - temperature and laser phases are instable , they will trend , by giving up parts of their internal energy to the surroundings , towards the stable phase , viz . , the positive - temperature phase . that is the microscopic interpretation about negative temperatures .",
    "finally , we note that the ideal fermi gas can not produce superconductivity because there does not exist any cooper pair in any case of the solutions of eq .",
    "( [ theta ] ) , @xmath145this result is just as expected , and right in accordance with the bcs theory @xcite .    in summary , it is proved , within the framework of the extended ensemble theory , that the ideal fermi gas can not produce superconductivity , its normal phase is stable at any temperature . besides , the extended ensemble theory gives a microscopic interpretation to the negative - temperature and laser phases : they originate from the same microscopic mechanism as that for phase transitions , and most importantly they are instable .",
    "to study bcs superconductivity with the extended ensemble theory , one needs first to solve eq .",
    "( [ variation ] ) to obtain the order parameter , and then to prove that it can satisfy the requirement of eq .",
    "( [ increment ] ) .",
    "unfortunately , that is rather difficult because it is impossible to calculate @xmath146 rigorously when @xmath14 contains an interaction . as a result , we have to seek approximations . before doing so , it is worthwhile to give a brief survey to the self - consistent mean - field theory due to bcs @xcite , which can be summarized as follows ,    @xmath147    where@xmath148    eq .

    "as has been seen , there arises the bose distribution function , @xmath328which is unbounded above on the set @xmath329 .",
    "because the integrand of a riemann integral must be bounded everywhere , such a function is not riemann integrable and can not be handled with riemann integration . fortunately , that makes no trouble .",
    "as pointed above , it is , in fact , unnecessary for us to handle the bose distribution function with riemann integration ; what really confronts us in statistical physics is lebesgue other than riemann integration . for lebesgue integration",

    "the bose distribution function is integrable , which can be shown as follows ,    @xmath330    where the set @xmath331 includes one point only .",
    "@xmath332 is a null set , i.e. , its measure is zero , thus , the integral on it vanishes .",
    "the rest part , i.e. , the integral on @xmath333 , reduces finally into an improper riemann integral .",

    "this aspect makes the present treatment quite distinct from that of einstein , where the integration is handled in riemann way , with a special treatment given to the ground state of @xmath280 .",
    "intuitively , einstein thought that the bosons would gather in the ground state if @xmath97 , and thus the contribution from this state is nonzero @xcite , that is , @xmath336where @xmath337 is the particle density gathering in the ground state . comparing eqs .",

    "there is a historical reason : until 1925 when einstein @xcite studied the bec , lebesgue integration had not yet been introduced to probability theory by kolmogorov , who did it in 1933 @xcite .    also , it is significant to compare the two lebesgue integrals represented in eq .",

    "( [ lesb3 ] ) : both integrands are unbounded on @xmath339 ; however , the former is infinite on a set with a nonzero measure ( @xmath340 ) , the latter is finite almost everywhere , or infinite just on a null set ( @xmath341 ) .",
    "this difference leads to the result that the nontrivial solution must be discarded in the finite volume case whereas it has physical sense in the thermodynamic limit . in a word",

    "that is a rigorous conclusion deduced from the extended ensemble theory .    as another instance",

    "<S> the stable state of a system is determined by the evolution of order parameter with temperature according to such a principle that the entropy of the system will reach its minimum in this state . </S>",
    "<S> the evolution of order parameter can cause change in representation of the system hamiltonian ; different phases will realize different representations , respectively ; a phase transition amounts to a representation transformation . </S>",
    "<S> physically , it turns out that phase transitions originate from the automatic interference among matter waves as temperature is cooled down . </S>",
    "<S> typical quantum many - body systems are studied with this extended ensemble theory . </S>",
    "<S> we regain the bardeen - cooper - schrieffer solution for the weak - coupling superconductivity , and prove that it is stable . </S>",
    "<S> we find that negative - temperature and laser phases arise from the same mechanism as phase transitions , and that they are instable . </S>",
    "<S> for the ideal bose gas , we demonstrate that it will produce bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) in the thermodynamic limit , which confirms exactly einstein s deep physical insight . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , there is no bec either within the phonon gas in a black body or within the ideal photon gas in a solid body . </S>",
    "<S> we prove that it is not admissible to quantize dirac field by using bose - einstein statistics . </S>",

    "<S> we demonstrate that it will yield spontaneous symmetry breaking and produce goldstone bosons ; and if it is coupled with a gauge field , the gauge field will obtain a mass ( higgs mechanism ) . </S>",
    "<S> also , we show that an interacting bose gas is stable only if the interaction is repulsive . for the weak interaction case , we find that the bec is a @xmath1-transition and its transition temperature can be lowered by the repulsive interaction . in connection with liquid @xmath2 </S>",
    "<S> , it is found that the specific heat at constant pressure @xmath3 will show a @xmath4 law at low temperatures , which is in agreement with the experiment . </S>",
    "<S> if the system is further cooled down , the theory predicts that @xmath3 will vanish linearly as @xmath5 , which is anticipating experimental verifications . </S>"
