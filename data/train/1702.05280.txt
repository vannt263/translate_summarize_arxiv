    "fourteen years after its discovery , the double pulsar psr j0737 - 3039 is still studied extensively .",
    "this system is composed of two neutron stars : an old , fast , mildly recycled 22.7 ms pulsar ( hereafter referred to as pulsar a ; @xcite ) and a younger and much slower pulsar with a period of 2.77 s ( hereafter pulsar b ; @xcite ) .",
    "the compact objects orbit each other in a very tight orbit in only 2.4 hr , with mean orbital velocities of about 1 million km / h ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) .",
    "psr j0737 - 3039 represents the most compact relativistic system and the only binary system in which both neutron stars have been detected as radio pulsars .",
    "the keplerian and post - keplerian parameters offer a unique test for theories of strong field gravity @xcite , and constrain the masses of both neutron stars with high accuracy .",
    "the physical riches of the double pulsar have been highlighted from the radio observations @xcite : whereas the pulse profile of pulsar a has been stable , the pulsed emission of pulsar b showed strong orbital flux and profile variations , before disappearing entirely in 2008 @xcite .",
    "moreover , as a direct consequence of the inclination of a system observed nearly edge - on ( i@xmath4 ) , radio eclipses were detected when pulsar a passed behind pulsar b @xcite .",
    "the study of the light curves testified to a new type of interaction between pulsar a s relativistic particle wind and pulsar b s magnetosphere in the previously unexplored close environment between the two neutron stars .",
    "this aroused the interest to carry out high - energy observations in the x - ray band to investigate further the intra - binary environment .",
    "early observations performed by the chandra and xmm - newton satellites @xcite pointed out the difficulty to constrain the origin of the multifold nature of the double pulsar s x - ray emission . the non - thermal pulsed emission from pulsar",
    "a , although very soft ( power - law slope @xmath5 ) , is clearly predominant in the x - ray flux @xcite .    in the frame of a first xmm - newton `` large program '' of 235 ks exposure in 2006 , pulsed x - ray emission from pulsar b was also detected in part of the orbit . due to its own low rotational energy loss ,",
    "x - ray emission from pulsar b can be only powered externally through the spin - down energy of pulsar a @xcite .",
    "this emission , consistent with thermal radiation of temperature kt@xmath6 ev and bolometric luminosity of @xmath7 erg s@xmath8 , was ascribed to the heating of pulsar b s surface by pulsar a s wind .",
    "a hotter ( @xmath9 ev ) and fainter ( @xmath10 erg s@xmath8 ) thermal component , possibly originating from backfalling material heating the polar caps of either pulsar a or pulsar b , was also suggested from the spectral analysis by @xcite .    in 2011 , a second deep xmm - newton observation of 370 ks was carried out .",
    "comprehensive timing analysis over such a large time span has confirmed x - ray pulsed emission from pulsar b even after its radio disappearance @xcite .",
    "the unusual phenomenology of pulsar b s x - ray emission includes orbital pulsed flux and profile variations as well as a loss of pulsar phase coherence on time scales of years , suggesting orbital - dependent penetration of pulsar a s wind plasma onto pulsar b s closed field lines .",
    "furthermore , timing analysis of the full xmm - newton dataset provided first evidence of orbital flux variability ( @xmath11 ) , possibly involving a bow - shock between pulsar structures @xcite . an additional , possibly hard , spectral component associated with this intra - binary environment",
    "is then expected .    in this paper",
    ", we present a comprehensive spectral analysis of the full xmm - newton dataset from both large programs , which allows us for the first time to constrain high - energy components above 4 kev . because of the weakness of the source and the consequent need to scrutinize the low - count statistics , an in - depth revision of the background subtraction procedure is provided .",
    "the standard spectral analysis was coupled with an independent source detection method based on likelihood spatial analysis .",
    "the complementarity of both approaches allows us to speculate for the first time on the possible presence of an iron line in the double pulsar .",

    "for these purposes , the epic - pn @xcite was used in `` small window '' mode whose time resolution of 5.67 ms compares with pulsar a s period of 22.7 ms .",
    "the epic - mos cameras @xcite were also operated in `` small window '' mode with a time resolution of 0.3 s only suitable for pulsar b timing analysis .",
    "medium and thin optical filters were applied to the epic instruments in 2006 and 2011 , respectively .",
    "the thin filter nearly doubles the instrument effective area in the soft band ( @xmath12 kev ) at the expense of higher background contamination : early x - ray observations of the double pulsar showed a very soft source spectrum motivating the use of the thin filter for subsequent observations in order to improve the overall counting statistics .",
    "the xmm - newton data were processed using the science analysis software ( sas ) version 12 .",
    "the calibrated and concatenated epic event lists were obtained by running the meta - tasks epproc and emproc , standard pipeline tasks for epic - mos and epic - pn observations respectively .",
    "we performed a barycentric correction on the event files thanks to the task barycen using the jpl de405 ephemeris to convert the time of arrival of photons from the satellite position to the solar - system barycenter .    because of the faintness of the double pulsar in x - rays , careful attention was provided in the assessment and mitigation of background contamination and in the selection of source photons .",
    "strong flares most likely associated with cosmic soft proton events , significantly affected different observations . in order to discard these episodes",

    "two different photon pattern selections were considered for the distribution of incident photons over the pixels of the epic - pn ( carrying out the analysis for both options ) : single and double events ( pattern @xmath13 ) or single events only ( pattern = 0 ) , slightly reducing the effective area . as for the epic - mos , single , double , triple and quadruple events were selected ( pattern @xmath14 ) .",

    "in order to exclude that the reported hard x - ray features are associated with background emission , the standard spectral analysis was coupled to an _ independent _ source detection method based on likelihood spatial analysis .",
    "the most sensitive procedure to estimate the strength of sources in x - ray data in common with other photon - counting data entails constructing composite models of the spatial distribution of events combining source and background components @xcite .",
    "the background near the double pulsar is made up of cosmic and instrumental contributions and is assumed to be flat .",
    "a point spread function spatial model was applied to epic images between 4 and 8 kev , where the discrepancy between the low - energy spectral models and the hard x - ray component is the most relevant .",
    "the table  [ spatial - table ] reports the results separately and combined for each of the 5 long observations comprising the two large programs in 2006 and 2011 .",
    "the exposure time reported , t(s ) , includes the dead - time correction of the small window mode .",
    "the likelihood detection statistic , lnl , shows that the double pulsar is a weak source at high energies that is difficult to detect in a whole spacecraft revolution of nearly two days , but which is consistent in strength with the count rate accumulated in half a million seconds of elapsed time .",
    "the combined log - likelihood detection statistic of 15.1 is a secure @xmath46 detection that amounts to @xmath47 photons above 4 kev from the x - ray source . unlike spectral analysis",
    ", unpredictable background contamination can not significantly affect likelihood analysis results , since background counts are not distributed in the image accordingly to the source point spread function .",
    "moreover , the spatial analysis testifies that there is no detection of source photons above 8 kev .",

    "the x - ray emission from pulsars is typically attributed to a magnetospheric and/or a thermal origin .",
    "because of the small separation between the two neutron stars , a strong interaction is expected between the wind of pulsar a and the magnetosphere of pulsar b , inducing possibly more complex mechanisms of the x - ray emission . in the following , we discuss the origin of the soft x - ray emission ( up to 4 kev ) and hard x - ray emission , including the detection of the spectral feature at @xmath54 kev .",
    "the spectral analysis of the observations performed in 2011 , as well as combining 2006 + 2011 data , provides results comparable with those related to 2006 data alone .",
    "different two - component ( black body plus power law or double black body ) or three - component spectral models ( double black - body plus power law ) can fit the whole dataset .",
    "however , scenarios involving only thermal emission components are disfavoured , since the flux is most likely dominated by non - thermal pulsar a s magnetosphere emission .",
    "a double black - body model implies that the x - ray flux of pulsar b would be about half of pulsar a s flux ( looking at black - body normalizations ) and this is inconsistent with x - ray fluxes derived from timing analysis by @xcite for which x - ray emission from pulsar a is over three times higher with respect to pulsar b. furthermore , pulsar phase - resolved analysis demonstrated that a non - thermal component clearly correlate with pulsar a s light curve peaks @xcite .",
    "no significant spectral variability in soft x - rays is evident over 5 years . in particular , despite a significant relativistic spin precession occurred in the considered time span ( @xmath0 ) , no significant long - term variation of the soft pulsar a s spectral component is observed .",
    "this further supports the hypothesis of a small misalignment between the spin axis and the orbital momentum axis as suggested by timing analysis of the same data @xcite .",
    "the non - thermal x - ray emission of psr j0737 - 3039 is likely attributed to relativistic charged particles accelerated in the magnetosphere of pulsar a , via synchrotron emission in the outer gap model @xcite and/or via inverse compton scattering of the thermal x - ray photons in the polar cap model ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "no signature of a bow shock component ( power law with @xmath55 as suggested by canonical shock models ; see @xcite and references therein ) between the wind from pulsar a and pulsar b s magnetosphere is present in our soft spectral data , nor evidence of spectral variability as a function of the orbital phase . a weak orbital flux variability ( @xmath567% ) was detected in the timing analysis @xcite and it was possibly attributed to bow - shock emission . in the spectral analysis , the corresponding bow - shock flux could be concealed by the strong pulsar a s luminosity .    as for the thermal emission",
    ", it is expected to originate from hot spots around the magnetic poles ( polar caps ) of pulsar a and/or pulsar b , heated up to x - ray temperatures by relativistic particles streaming down onto the surface from the magnetosphere of the pulsar(s ) .",
    "indeed , considering the characteristic ages of pulsar a ( @xmath57 myr ) and pulsar b ( @xmath58 myr ) , and the cooling evolution of such objects ( tsuruta 1998 ) , these pulsars are too old to have an intrinsic thermal radiation from their entire surface or from the atmosphere @xcite .    the radio pulsar models @xcite predict polar cap radii @xmath59s@xmath60 km for a neutron star of radius @xmath61 km .",
    "hence , theoretically , the polar cap radii associated with pulsar a and pulsar b are @xmath62 km and @xmath63 m , respectively .",
    "these values are in agreement with black - body emission radii derived from our spectral results .",
    "either assuming the presence of one or two black - body components in our spectral scenario , the expected luminosity of each component is @xmath6410@xmath65 erg / s , a value higher than pulsar b s spin - down luminosity .",
    "this means that the black - body component luminosity would be @xmath66 @xmath67 .",
    "thus , we can confirm that pulsar b s emission can only be powered by an external source ( i.e. pulsar a s spin - down energy ) .      for any applicable spectral scenario in the @xmath68 kev range ,",
    "the data above 4 kev are not correctly described by the two or three - component models ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "the complementarity of the independent spatial and spectral approaches allows us to claim for the first time hard x - ray emission from the double pulsar .",
    "this hard emission is well fitted by a gaussian line at @xmath69 kev in the 2006 data .",
    "no other simple model , such as a power law or a black body , is able to fit the high - energy excess .",
    "emission at these energies indicates the likely presence of iron line emission .",
    "the firm detection of hard x - ray emission in the @xmath48 kev range coupled with no source detection @xmath70 kev through spatial analysis , strengthen the reliability of our spectral feature detection .",
    "the presence of such a feature has major importance since it represents the first evidence of an x - ray spectral line around a supposedly `` non - accreting system '' .    as for the second long - observation performed in 2011",
    ", we can not claim evidence of a high - energy spectral line , because of a poorer signal - to - noise ratio in hard x - rays mostly due to the use of the thin epic - pn filter . in any case",
    ", the detection of high - energy photons from the double pulsar is also confirmed in these data through spatial analysis , though spectral parameters can not be precisely constrained in the 2011 data alone . as described in section 3 ,",
    "line variability is compatible with our data , though not required .",
    "associated with emission at @xmath3 kev , the fe k@xmath2 line is widely considered as a particular property of accretion - powered sources in which accreting matter forms a disk .",
    "it has been detected in the x - ray spectra of many supermassive black holes and stellar - mass - black - hole and neutron - star x - ray binaries @xcite , and in magnetic cataclysmic variables @xcite .",
    "the emission line is thought to originate in the innermost parts of the accretion disk , where strong relativistic effects broaden and distort its shape .",
    "the production of such a line is fairly simple requiring a source of thermal or non - thermal hard x - rays to illuminate the disk . in this context",
    "our detection of the fe k@xmath2 line in the double pulsar may indicate that at least one of the system components is surrounded by a gaseous disk .",
    "however , what could be the origin of such a disk ?    the double pulsar , as the other few confirmed double neutron star binaries , is the descendant of a high - mass binary system that has survived two supernova explosions @xcite .",
    "the two stars under - filled their roche lobes and lose matter at a relatively low rate through winds of relativistic particles .",
    "the conventional scenario of accretion disk formation based on intensive mass - exchange between the system components in this case is not applicable .",
    "however , a relic disk of matter captured from ejecta of the second supernova explosion could be present .",
    "the disk could be formed in two ways .",
    "the first is a so - called fall - back accretion scenario in which the inner parts of the ejecta return towards the newly - formed neutron star forming a disk around its magnetosphere @xcite .",
    "the mass of the remnant disk in this case is about @xmath71 m@xmath72 .",
    "the second scenario suggests the disk to form around the magnetosphere of the old neutron star born during the first supernova explosion as it moves through the supernova ejecta of its exploded companion . as recently pointed out @xcite , the mass of the remnant disk within this scenario can reach @xmath73 m@xmath72 .",
    "thus , current views of the process of supernova explosions do not exclude that one or even both neutron stars could be surrounded by relic disks .",
    "observations give no direct evidence that the neutron stars in the double pulsar are accreting material from a disk ( no radio pulsar timing noise reported by @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "it is plausible that the relic disk is currently in a dead state @xcite in which mass - transfer towards the star is suppressed by the centrifugal barrier at the boundary of the stellar magnetosphere .",
    "the interaction between the disk and the magnetic field of the radio pulsar in this case results in generation of electrical currents , which connect the inner parts of the disk with polar cap regions at the surface of the neutron star @xcite .",
    "as the currents dissipate in small areas of the polar caps the temperature increases dramatically , enhancing the hot spots visible in x - rays . in contrast , the temperature of the disk increases little since current dissipation occurs over a much larger area .",
    "the disk in this case could contribute to the pulsar emission at lower frequencies by a significant fraction of the pulsar spin - down power .",
    "our spectral analysis of the xmm - newton data demonstrates that the thermal x - ray emission is indeed incompatible with a disk origin , since the disk radius would be too small ( even assuming a disk black - body model _ diskbb _ ) . the surface area associated with the black bodies at 0.1 and 0.3",
    "kev is of the order of 600 and 100 m@xmath74 , respectively , indicating most likely thermal emission from the polar cap(s ) .",
    "the putative disk is most likely colder and thus invisible in x - rays .",
    "it manifests itself only through the iron line that requires external heating",
    ". this could be by illumination by a hard continuum x - rays from pulsar a , although this might be too weak or anisotropic to be observed .",
    "alternatively , unlike accretion - powered pulsars , the disk could be illuminated by high - energy particles from pulsar a s wind . in this case , about @xmath75 of spin - down energy of pulsar a could power the k@xmath2 line .",
    "interestingly enough , this is the same amount of energy powering pulsar b s x - ray emission",
    ".    iron line emission could also be in principle associated with an accumulation of matter trapped in the shock layer foreseen between pulsar a s wind and the magnetosphere of pulsar b. a hypothetical spectral line from the surface or atmosphere of the neutron star is not favored , since the gravitational redshift would induce a line at @xmath76 kev accordingly to the lower limit on the neutron stars mass - radius ratio @xcite .",
    "an idea about a relic disk to surrounding a radio pulsar has been invoked by a discovery of two planet - mass companions around the millisecond pulsar psr 1257 + 12 @xcite .",
    "further studies eventually confirmed that the components are likely to originate from a durable remnant disk , which in a previous epoch could be in an accretion or dead state .",
    "the presence of remnant disks around isolated neutron stars has later been suspected in studies of anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) and soft gamma - ray repeaters ( sgrs ) @xcite .",
    "iron line emission at 6.4 kev was detected during a gamma - ray burst in sgr 1900 + 14 @xcite .",
    "the presence of a relic disk was also been invoked to explain the ir / optical radiation discovered from two axps @xcite . only upper limits to the optical flux",
    "were derived for the double pulsar @xcite , which was instead detected in the fuv @xcite . although the thermal or non - thermal nature of this emission is still unclear , it is not related to magnetospheric or surface x - ray pulsar emission since it does not match with extrapolated x - ray spectra .",
    "it is in principle compatible with a relic disk of luminosity l@xmath77 erg / s .",
    "the possible weakening or even disappearance of the spectral feature at @xmath54 kev in the data obtained in 2011 could be related to actual variability of the fe line because of changes in the geometry or precession of the disk , which is not illuminated in the same way over time .",
    "the parameters of interaction between the wind of pulsar a and the magnetosphere of pulsar b are expected to be different between 2006 and 2011 , as manifested by radio disappearance of pulsar b in 2008 .",
    "as the orbit is seen edge - on , changes on the disk could in principle also affect radio pulsar timing ( e.g. observed dispersion measure , pulse shapes and eclipses ) when it crosses the line - of - sight to the pulsars .",
    "a multi - messenger approach is then required to probe the putative relic disk and its time - dependent geometry .",
    "two large programs of observations of the relativistic double pulsar were performed by xmm - newton in 2006 and 2011 .",
    "the total observing time of about 600 ks offers the opportunity to investigate the low luminosity source with a high number of @xmath78 source photon events .",
    "no significant spectral variations in soft x - rays can be claimed in the 5 years between 2006 and 2011 , substantially confirming the previously reported results based on the analysis of the 2006 data alone . two - component ( black body plus power law ) or three - component spectral models ( double black - body plus power law ) can in principle fit the whole dataset , although the latter models seem better suited according to phase - resolved spectral analysis @xcite .",
    "however , for any applicable spectral scenario in the @xmath68 kev range , the data above 4 kev are not correctly described by the models .",
    "we investigated for the first time the high - energy part of the spectrum of the double pulsar .",
    "an intriguing emission feature , possibly variable , is detected at about @xmath54 kev .",
    "spatial analysis confirms the emission of hard energy photons between 4 and 8 kev ascribed to the source .",
    "this feature is most likely attributed to iron line emission , testifying the presence of a relic disk that survived the supernova explosions that terminated the lives of the double pulsar s stellar progenitors .",

    "<S> we present a long - term spectral monitoring of the unique double pulsar binary psr j0737 - 3039 corresponding to two `` large programs '' performed by xmm - newton in 2006 and 2011 . </S>",
    "<S> spectral variability of pulsar emission in soft x - rays is not evident over 5 years , despite the significant relativistic spin precession in the considered time span ( @xmath0 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we provide , for the first time , evidence of hard x - ray emission from the system in the @xmath1 kev energy band . </S>",
    "<S> the standard spectral analysis was coupled to the energy dependent spatial analysis to confirm this excess , most likely ascribed to iron line emission . </S>",
    "<S> the fe k@xmath2 emission line at @xmath3 kev was previously unheard - of in non - accreting binary systems and could testify to the presence of a relic disk that survived the supernova explosions that terminated the lives of the double pulsar s stellar progenitors . </S>",
    "<S> the existence of a relic disk in this system reinforces speculation about the presence of similar structures around other peculiar classes of isolated neutron stars . </S>"
