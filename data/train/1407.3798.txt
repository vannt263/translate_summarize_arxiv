    "white dwarf ( wd ) stars are galactic fossils that provide a glimpse into the final stages of the evolution of all stars with initial masses below about @xmath2 @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "this is the case not only for isolated stars , but also for the large number found in binary systems .",
    "wds thus provide observational boundary conditions on both stellar and binary evolution .",
    "the fate of all binary systems is to eventually be brought together due to the loss of orbital angular momentum carried away by gravitational radiation .",
    "this process is usually impractically slow , but the most compact detached binaries ( @xmath3 hr , @xmath4 @xmath5 ) will merge within a hubble time",
    ". a wd can be uniquely packed into very close orbital configurations with another compact companion and still remain detached : a double - degenerate binary .",
    "such systems will merge to form a variety of exotic objects we see in nature , including am cvn systems , hydrogen - deficient stars including r coronae borealis stars , single subdwarfs , and supernovae ia @xcite .",
    "a growing number of double - degenerate binary systems have been found that contain extremely low - mass ( elm , @xmath6@xmath1 ) wds , which are by necessity products of binary evolution , since an isolated wd could not have evolved to such a low mass within the age of the universe .",
    "these rare elm wds underwent severe mass loss from a close companion , which truncated their evolution and left behind a he - core wd @xcite .",
    "elm wds were first found as companions to millisecond pulsars , but are increasingly found from all - sky surveys like the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "he - core wds provide unique insight into the later stages of close binary evolution and inspiral , and also provide excellent constraints on neutron star masses and equation of state when found as companions to pulsars ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "such work relies on the fundamental parameters for elm wds  especially the mass - radius relationship  in order to derive cooling ages and to assign masses to these wds from their spectroscopically determined surface gravities . however , no direct radius measurements for low - mass wds existed until very recently , and there are still few eclipsing systems known @xcite .",

    "nine of the 20 systems in our sample display a significant modulation at the orbital period commensurate with doppler beaming . since we already know the radial - velocity amplitude of these systems from spectroscopy , detecting this signal yields little new information about our binaries",

    "however , this is not an entirely robust approach , since there is occasionally long - timescale transparency variations or other atmospheric variability contaminating some of the expected signals , which sometimes overlap with the orbital period and thus the doppler beaming signal .",
    "for example , one anomalous system ( j0923 + 3028 ) has an observed @xmath62 term more than twice the expected value , but the photometry may be influenced by long - period atmospheric variability ; there is a comparable signal at 1.4 hr which is longer than the 1.08-hr orbital period .      in the cases for which we see tidal distortions ,",

    "they showed that the ellipsoidal variation amplitude is dominated by @xmath133 where all terms can be written in terms of the inclination ( @xmath134 ) given that we can determine the mass ratio ( @xmath135 ) and semimajor axis of the system ( @xmath46 ) from the spectroscopy and that we can assume reasonable values for the linear limb - darkening ( @xmath136 ) and gravity - darkening ( @xmath137 ) coefficients for the primary .",

    "we mark these low - mass wds as green squares in figure  [ fig : massradius ] to differentiate between the other eclipsing wds because the a - star companions could contribute to inflating the radius of the wd @xcite .",
    "we also include in figure  [ fig : massradius ] the theoretical mass - radius relations of he - core wds from @xcite .",

    ", such low - mass wds ( @xmath154 @xmath1 ) are expected to quiescently burn hydrogen and are not theoretically predicted to undergo cno flashes ; for example , the large jump in radius for the low - mass end of the @xmath155  k isotherm in figure  [ fig : binary1 ] demonstrates the expectedly larger radius for a 0.1762 @xmath1  model , which does not undergo cno flashes and thus has a more massive residual hydrogen layer .",
    "our tidally distorted elm wds are among the lowest - mass wds with radius constraints , so our observational results fill an important and untested region of the mass - radius relation .",
    "six of our eight radius measurements are generally consistent with the models of @xcite . in some cases ( notably j0106@xmath81000 and j0651 + 2844 ) , the observed radii are slightly larger than expected given their spectroscopic mass and temperature .",
    "however , two outliers have radii significantly larger than expected from the he - core wd models : j0751@xmath80141 and j0745 + 1949 .",
    "it is possible that these two wds are not on their final cooling track , but are instead in another part of their evolution , perhaps recently undergoing a cno flash . assuming the surface of j0745 + 1949 is radiative and adopting a larger gravity - darkening coefficient for this 8380 k wd can not explain this discrepancy ; adopting @xmath156 still yields @xmath157 @xmath5 .",
    "it is notable that j0745 + 1949 is one of the most metal - rich wds known @xcite , which could possibly be the result of mixing induced by a recent cno flash .",
    "if so , the mass determined from the @xmath138  and @xmath153  may not accurately represent the wd mass , which was adopted assuming the wd was on its terminal cooling track .",
    "higher - mass models indeed cross the same position in @xmath138  and @xmath153  space while undergoing cno flashes before their terminal cooling track .",
    "there is mounting evidence that many low - mass wds do not appear to be on a terminal cooling track , especially those that are companions to millisecond pulsars ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "there are likely still unexplained complexities to the evolution of low - mass wds .",
    "if we do not restrict our monte carlo simulation analysis of j0745 + 1949 by the primary mass of 0.164 @xmath1 , we instead find @xmath158 @xmath1 , @xmath159 @xmath5 , and @xmath160 @xmath1 .",
