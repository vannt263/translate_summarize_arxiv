    "the problem of computing the nonlinear current response to a bias dropped across a nanoscale structure can be treated within the framework of the nonequilibrium green s function ( negf ) formalism@xcite .",

    "the mathematical equivalence of the green s function approaches to the nonequilibrium and equilibrium problems has been well understood since the work of martin , schwinger , matsubara , keldysh , kadanoff and baym @xcite .",
    "perhaps the most elegant depiction of this equivalence comes with the introduction of the konstantinov - perel contour , on which the initial preparation of the system together with its subsequent time evolution can be conveniently represented@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we are concerned with the problem of electron transport through a nanojunction , consisting of a small central region @xmath2 , contacted with a set of conducting leads labelled by @xmath3 , themselves in contact with an external circuit and battery .",
    "this may for example describe a molecule or quantum dot contacted with a pair of capacitor plates , as found for example in a single electron transistor@xcite ; a schematic of the generic set - up is shown in fig . [",

    "formalism has enjoyed great success as a tool for the description of transport processes in the steady - state regime , when a long time has passed after the switch on of a constant bias @xcite .",
    "this success may be attributed to its formal and conceptual simplicity , and a set of equations for the steady - state current that can be combined with dft calculations to access the electronic properties of a system@xcite .",
    "it is useful for the description of transport processes in the ballistic regime , where the time separating electron - electron interaction events exceeds the time taken for an electron to cross the molecular region .",
    "the lb formalism is convenient for the description of several features of transport processes accessible to experimentalists : temperature - dependence@xcite , quantization of the conductance@xcite , exponential decay of conductance as a function of junction length@xcite , and the shot and thermal noise associated with the current@xcite .    in recent years",
    ", experimental work has increasingly focused on dynamical properties of nanojunctions , in particular the ac current response to a periodic voltage operating in the ghz or thz frequency range@xcite .",
    "it is therefore desirable to develop a formalism that will allow calculation of the full time - dependent response of a molecular device to an arbitrary time - dependent perturbation .",
    "_ _ _ _ and the lb formula is derived as the long - time limit of the resulting electron current .",
    "this means that the appropriate electronic couplings are not present in the equilibrium hamiltonian prior to the switch - on , and that embedding self - energies can not be defined for the system in equilibrium .",
    "however , this is not important for deriving the steady state expression for the current as it is assumed that at long times all preparation - dependent effects have been washed out . working within a partitioned approach , jauho et .",
    "al . obtained a closed @xmath4-space integral expression for the td current response to an arbitrary time varying bias@xcite .",
    "they assumed that the decoupled leads were prepared at @xmath5 with an appropriate time dependent bias and then , immediately after , the coupling between the leads and the central system was enabled .",
    "naturally , this approach has a problem as the bias and the coupling are being established at the same time in the distant past .",
    "therefore , the correctness of this approach rests on an assumption that the system arrives at the correct non - equilibrium state at times @xmath6 after a semi - infinite development from @xmath7 , which can not be guaranteed as the perturbation due to the coupling _ and _ the bias were added together . also , in terms of applications , the partitioned approach is limited to a periodic bias only ; for instance , the switch on effect can only be modelled by considering periodic bias pulses well separated in time",
    ". however , a finite time between pulses prevents the system from equilibrating properly .",
    "however , in a real experiment , one switches on the bias , not the coupling between regions .",
    "the coupling will be fully present at equilibrium , so that a single inverse temperature @xmath8 and single chemical potential @xmath9 are defined for all regions of the junction . _ partition - free _",
    "approaches@xcite recognise this fact , and therefore they effectively diverge from partitioned approaches in their choice of initial density matrix @xmath10 for the many - body dynamics .",
    "after @xmath11 , the same hamiltonian is used to propagate the system in either of the two approaches , so if all information on the preparation of the system is lost in the long - time limit , one would expect the same steady state to be reached regardless of the choice of the initial density matrix .",
    "however , whereas the equilibrium initial distribution in the partition - free approach is well - defined and leads to a physical transient current , any transients in the partitioned approach can not be interpreted physically , as they result from the junction s memory of its fictitious initial state .",
    "important progress was made in the direction of a fully time - dependent partition - free approach by stefanucci and almbladh , who proved theorems of asymptotic equivalence between the two approaches and obtained an integral formula for the linear current response to a td bias within the wide - band - limit approximation ( wbla)@xcite .",
    "recently , tuovinen _ _ obtained a closed frequency integral for the exact time - dependent current response to a static bias , within a partition - free approach , making it increasingly possible to theoretically investigate short - time effects in nanoscale systems@xcite .",
    "their formula clearly exhibits decaying modes in addition to a steady - state part , and has been applied to the study of transport through ring - shaped molecular junctions@xcite , and more recently , graphene nanoribbons@xcite .",
    "here we develop an analytic approach whereby a td - lb formula for a current response to an _ arbitrary _ time - dependent bias in a multi - lead system , including the switch - on effect , is derived , for any tight - binding hamiltonian .",
    "the final formula involves only slightly more computational cost than the corresponding lb formula for the steady - state current . in our formulation",
    "we extend the partition - free approach of @xcite , in that no assumptions are made concerning the particular time dependence of the bias applied to each of the leads .",
    "the analytical result is obtained within the wbla by integrating exactly the kadanoff - baym equations for the green s function of the central region .",
    "this work incorporates the formulae of jauho et .",
    "al . and tuovinen et .",
    "as special cases .",
    "specifically , the former emerges as the long time limit of a more general expression that contains the transients .",
    "the latter is the constant bias limit of our more general expression containing time integrals of the bias . in this way",
    "we show that an analytical expression for the fully non - linear current response to an arbitrary td bias at all times subsequent to @xmath11 is possible within the wbla .",
    "note in passing that a numerical approach to the solution of the embedded kadanoff - baym equations for systems that include an explicit electron - electron interaction term in their hamiltonian within the second born ( 2b ) and gw approximations has also been recently developed@xcite .",
    "extensions of the tight - binding approach to a dft - green s function formalism in the time domain have also been performed . in these approaches ,",
    "the system is prepared in an equilibrium state whose electronic structure is obtained from _ ab initio _ calculations , before the time - dependent perturbation is applied@xcite .",
    "we do not take these approaches here as they can only be facilitated numerically .",
    "we believe that a    the paper is organised as follows : section 2 contains a description of the model hamiltonian , the derivation of self - energies and all components of the green s functions required for the current .",
    "in particular , a novel formula for the exact lesser green s function of two times is presented here . from this , an @xmath4 integral is derived for the current through one of the leads , and we proceed to show how it reduces to known results in the long - time and static bias limits .",
    "note that some steps of our calculation are similar to those done in @xcite .",
    "in these cases we do not give much detail ; instead we briefly outline a few essential steps and state the final results . in section [ sec : results ] we present the results of current calculations on a quantum dot central region in response to a periodic external bias .",

    "the kadanoff - baym or nonequilibrium green s function ( negf ) approach to electron transport is a tool for the description of the time evolution ensemble averages of quantum systems ; in particular , it can conveniently be used for calculating time dependent ensemble averages of particle number densities in subsystems open to an environment .",
    "the most essential feature of this formalism is that of time evolution on a contour defined in the complex time plane . here , @xmath14 refers to the konstantinov - perel contour , which is just the union of the three sets of points : ( i ) @xmath15 , the upper contour , containing points between @xmath16 and @xmath17 ; ( ii ) the lower contour @xmath18 containing points along the line between @xmath19 and @xmath20 , and ( iii ) @xmath21 which is any contour in the complex plane between two points @xmath22 , @xmath23 , such that @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the inverse temperature .",

    "it is instructive to investigate the long time behaviour of the expression ( [ eq : final - current ] ) , which can be done by taking the limit @xmath208 , i.e. we shift the switch - on time to the distant past .",
    "we first note that , as @xmath208 , the asymptotic value of the preparation term , @xmath209 which contains the matrix function @xmath210 , is vanishing ( @xmath211 ) , so that it has no effect on the steady state current .",

    "[ fig : the - effect - of - dot - level](a)-(d ) .",
    "it is clear from these plots that the frequency of the ` ringing ' oscillations of the td current is determined by the position of the dot relative to the two fermi levels . in particular",

    "the dependence of this effect on the left gap alone can be checked by moving @xmath231 and @xmath249 by the same amount ; indeed our calculations demonstrate that this leaves the number of ` ringing ' peaks unchanged . when the gap @xmath234 is equal to zero , fig .",
    "[ fig : the - effect - of - dot - level](d ) , the ` ringing ' ceases to be significant , although an asymmetric peak after the minimum of the bias is still present , as discussed above .",
    "this is not surprising , because when @xmath252 the time - dependent shift in the fermi level of the left lead is symmetric about @xmath249 .",
    "physically , we interpret the ` ringing ' current signal as an outcome of competing intrinsic timescales : the timescale of tunnelling from the left lead onto the dot is smaller than the typical lifetime of an electron in the dot state , given by @xmath253 .",
    "it is apparent from the figs .",
    "[ fig : the - effect - of - dot - level](a)-(d ) that the possibility for a negative current is also determined by the position of the dot energy relative to the left fermi level , and that the minima of the current become increasingly negative as @xmath249 is brought closer to @xmath231 .",
    "next , we consider the effects on the current response of varying the driving frequency .",
    "one would intuitively expect that , as the driving frequency of the bias is lowered , the agreement between our td formula and the lb formula for the ss current becomes better as the bias varies more slowly , suggesting that the lb formula derived for the case of a static bias would become appropriate . in fig .",
    "[ fig : the - effect - of freq ] , all parameters , except for the bias frequency , are the same as in fig .",
    "[ fig : the - basic - system](b ) . in ( a ) the driving frequency of the bias",

    "one can see that in this adiabatic limit there is excellent agreement with the steady - state formula , with the exception of a quickly oscillating transient following @xmath11 , and a very quickly suppressed single ` ringing ' peak . in fig .",
    "[ fig : the - effect - of freq](b ) , the driving frequency is scaled up to @xmath255 , with the effect that the current response deviates significantly from that given by the lb formula .",
    "interestingly , in this high frequency case it takes around 4 to 5 bias cycles for the current to stabilise into steady oscillations .",
    "in addition , a phase - shift of the current response with respect to the steady - state value is clearly visible . during the transient regime , the amplitude of the exact current disagrees with the steady state current at all times .",
    "the amplitude of the exact current at the bias peaks is much greater than the amplitude of the steady state current in the long - time regime .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : the - level - width - effect ] we consider the effect of varying the level width @xmath256 , where all other parameters are fixed at the same values as in fig .",

    "we display the effects of setting @xmath257 in panel ( a ) .",
    "we see that this has the effect of prolonging the transient and of accentuating the ` ringing ' peaks in the td current , without adding any new peaks to this part of the signal . in fig .",
    "[ fig : the - level - width - effect](b ) the level width @xmath2585.0 ; we see that for @xmath259 , the td formula is periodic , but it is also interesting to note that the ` ringing ' oscillations are greatly suppressed , in a manner which is qualitatively similar to the suppression observed above for an adiabatic driving frequency , fig . [ fig : the - effect - of freq](a ) .",
    "interpreting @xmath256 as the frequency with which electrons tunnel off the dot , we see that in this case it is greater than any other typical energy gap in the problem , so that the time scale with which electrons tunnel onto the dot is greater than that with which they escape .",
    "we also investigate the effect of decreasing the amplitude @xmath260 of the bias oscillations about the fixed point @xmath231 , and the result for @xmath261 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : efect - on - the - amplitude ] .",
    "the main effects observed in fig . [ fig : the - basic - system](b ) are present , but as the left fermi level never comes all the way down to ` touch ' @xmath249 , there is relatively little ` ringing ' in the td current in addition to the ss behaviour .",
    "in the temperature regime we are considering , eq .",
    "( [ eq : zerotemp ] ) is in close agreement with the ss formula at all values of the time - dependent bias inserted into @xmath231 .",

    "we thus need only to calculate the following expression contained in the first term in ( [ eq:2nd - int - interm1 ] ) :    @xmath319 once again , we perform the summation over the matsubara frequencies using formula ( [ eq : matisumabara - sum - formula ] ) and then perform the @xmath131 integration in the complex plane , leading to the following result for the final contribution to the line integral :    @xmath320    summing up all four terms , and taking into account that @xmath321 we obtain the result ( [ eq : final - current ] ) given in the text .",
    "when one substitutes ( [ eq : dotkl ] ) and ( [ eq : dotkr ] ) into the formula ( [ eq : final - current ] ) , one can separate the resulting formula into three terms , two of which decay due to factors of @xmath322 and @xmath323 .",
    "these expressions are stated here for completeness :"
