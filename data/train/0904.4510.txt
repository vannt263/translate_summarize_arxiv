    "the rapid growth of the area of quantum information has led to consider the idea of multi users quantum networks with the final goal of realizing a number of nano - scale devices and communication protocols @xcite .",
    "the study of networks of interacting qubits ( spins ) constitutes a good testing ground for this purpose . in the last few years , this kind of networks",
    "have been specifically considered to be good candidates for engineering perfect quantum channels and allowing information transfer between distant locations @xcite ( see also @xcite , for a review ) .",
    "such networks appear to be useful for the implementation of data buses in quantum mechanical devices , in particular because they undergo a free dynamics after an initial set - up .    in this perspective , the possibility of having _ perfect state transfer _",
    "( for short , _ pst _ ) comes from suitable quantum interference effects in the network dynamics .",
    "however , one of the problems arising in such a scenario is given by natural dispersion effects and destructive interference , which determine a loss of information between communicating sites .",
    "in the worst cases , information can even remain totally localized , due to anderson localization effects @xcite . while this situation may still be useful ,",

    ", pst has been related to the combinatorial properties of networks ( see , _ e.g. _ , @xcite , and the references contained therein ) .",
    "in particular , in the @xmath0 model ( respectively , the @xmath1 model ) , when considering a single excitation , it has been shown that pst essentially depends on the eigensystem of the adjacency matrix of the graph ( respectively , the laplacian matrix ) , because certain invariant eigenspaces of the total hilbert space evolve independently .    here",
    "we discuss the problem of how to improve the fidelity of excitation transfer for a fixed interaction ( @xmath0 model ) and network .",
    "in particular , we show that , by a suitable energy shift corresponding to some vertices in the network , it is possible to achieve perfect transfer in cases where this does not usually happen .",
    "we conjecture that this is possible in many networks , whenever we add a suitable amount of energy .",
    "moreover , we evaluate the effect of random fluctuations on the transmission fidelity .",
    "we separately consider noise affecting qubits frequencies and qubits couplings and we show signatures of anderson localization @xcite as well as of stochastic resonance @xcite .",

    ", we discuss how to enhance the transfer fidelity for a linear spin chain .",
    "it is known that a spin chain with constant couplings allows pst between its end - vertices only when it has length two or three .",
    "evidence given by numerics show that pst can be achieved in chains of any length by an appropriate energy shift independent of the number of nodes .",
    "the drawback is a rapid increase of the transfer time .",
    "furthermore , the number of geodesics between the input and output vertex seems to play a role in determining the transfer time .",
    "finally , in section v , we show how noise affects the transfer . in particular , we show that disordered couplings are more deleterious than disordered frequencies when optimal energy shift is used . in the absence of such a shift",
