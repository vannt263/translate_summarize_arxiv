    "the study of the nonlinear electromagnetic effects in graphene has so far mainly focused on monolayer graphene",

    "theoretical and experimental investigations have shown that a perpendicular electric field ( created by gates ) applied to a graphene bilayer modifies its band structure near the k point and may open an energy gap  @xcite in the electronic spectrum .",
    "magnetotransport  @xcite and spectroscopic  @xcite measurements showed that the induced gap between the conduction and valence bands could be tuned between zero and midinfrared energies .",
