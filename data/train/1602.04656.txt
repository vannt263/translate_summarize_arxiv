    "the classical risk measure for insurance companies is the probability of ruin .",
    "this quantity is intensively studied , since in 1903 @xcite introduced his model for the surplus of an insurance company . however , in many models a trajectory can only either lead to ruin or tend to infinity .",
    "hence , @xcite introduced expected discounted future dividend payments as a valuation principle for a homogeneous insurance portfolio , which builds an alternative risk measure .",
    "this concept originally comes from corporate finance , where the firm value is often determined by the accumulated future dividend payments .",
    "our aim is to solve the valuation problem of an insurance company in these terms . since its introduction",
    ", the dividend maximization problem has been solved in various setups , for example by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite in diffusion models .",
    "@xcite study a similar problem with random intervention times .",
    "overviews can be found in @xcite , or @xcite .",
    "for an introduction to optimization problems in insurance in general we refer to @xcite and @xcite .",
    "+ however , all of these contributions assume a constant economic environment . the dividend maximization problem is considered over a potentially long time horizon , which makes the assumption that the economy does not change a strong one . since a changing economic environment structurally influences the insurance market , we would like to incorporate such changes into our model . in setups which allow for a change in the economic environment",
    "the dividend maximization problem has been studied for example by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite consider a diffusion model for the surplus , the parameters of which are driven by an underlying markov chain .",
    "such a setup is called _ regime switching model_. in a cramr - lundberg type model @xcite allow the economy to become worse once before ruin , and @xcite allow for a finite number of shifts of the economy . in all these models ,",
    "the driving markov chain is assumed to be _ observable_. this means that they assume full information and therefore their models differ from the model studied herein .",
    "+ we use the dividend maximization approach to solve the valuation problem of an insurance company in a _ hidden _ markov model .",
    "more precisely , we model the surplus process of the insurance company as a brownian motion with drift .",
    "the drift is assumed to be driven by an underlying markov chain , the current state of which is _ unobservable _ under the available information .",
    "in contrast to @xcite and @xcite , where the setup was bayesian , i.e. , the underlying markov chain was not allowed to change its state , we allow for regime shifts .",
    "this gives the model a different interpretation .",
    "here , the different states of the markov chain represent different phases of the economy .",
    "it is of certain interest on the one hand to allow for changes in the economic environment and on the other hand it is realistic that the current state of the economy is not exactly known instantaneously , but only over time , and also over time the drift of a diffusion can not be estimated satisfactorily , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 4.2 )  even more if shifts are allowed .",
    "thus allowing for uncertainty extends @xcite to a more practically relevant direction .",
    "+ in the literature of mathematical finance hidden markov models have already been used intensively for studying investment problems , e.g. , in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , or @xcite .",
    "also dividend problems were solved in the mathematical finance literature , see @xcite and @xcite , who seek to maximize the expected accumulated utility of dividends , and the expected utility of accumulated dividends , respectively . however , in the insurance context related results concerning hidden markov models are scarce .",
    "we refer to @xcite as an example , who models the value of a single insurance policy as a brownian motion with unobservable drift describing uncertainty about the quality of a risk .",
    "another , more recent example is the paper by @xcite , who study optimal reinsurance and investment under unobservable claim size and intensity . in @xcite",

    "we define our model and show how to overcome uncertainty by applying a result from stochastic filtering theory , and thus transform the setup into one under full information .",
    "the stochastic optimization problem under study is presented in section [ sec : opti ] .",
    "for solving the stochastic optimization problem we derive the hamilton - jacobi - bellman ( hjb ) equation and characterize the optimal value function as a viscosity solution to this hjb equation .",
    "we also prove uniqueness of the viscosity solution even though there is a lack of boundary conditions . in section [ sec : num ]",
    "we treat the problem numerically .",
    "first of all we examine the filter dynamics .",
    "then , we solve the hjb equation numerically .",
    "for this we need to introduce a correction term to ensure positivity of the scheme , but we can show that the approximate solution converges .",
    "we present a multitude of numerical examples .",
    "furthermore , we are able prove admissibility of the candidate optimal strategies , which means showing that the underlying system of stochastic differential equations with discontinuous drift and degenerate diffusion has a solution .",
    "section [ sec : concl ] concludes the paper . +",
    "the main contribution of this paper is the analytical characterization of the solution to the dividend maximization problem in a hidden markov switching model , including a non - standard uniqueness proof of the generalized solution to the associated hamilton - jacobi - bellman ( hjb ) equation , and an extensive numerical study of the outcomes of this model .",

    "however , for low values of @xmath239 the volatility comes more into effect and hence if @xmath256 is small anyway , then it becomes better to pay dividends even for low values of @xmath66 , because volatility might lead into early ruin . then , as @xmath239 grows it becomes more effective than the volatility and hence soon ruin is not expected anymore and the strategy is designed for a longer living company for higher values of @xmath239 .",
    "it is interesting that for all of the four parameter sets in the state with the lower drift dividends are paid out more cautiously in the markov switching case than in the bayesian case , and in the state with the higher drift it is the other way round .",
    "an explanation for this is that since in the markov switching case there is a chance that the economy gets better , it is the better strategy to wait , if @xmath239 is small and pay out dividends at higher values of @xmath239 .",
    "hence the state with the lower drift is the state of saving , whereas the other state is the state of spending . in the bayesian case",
    "the drift does not change and therefore the situation is more balanced . +                figure [ fig : valueplot ] shows the value function corresponding to @xmath257 ( but they all look rather similar ) .    .",
    "]    figure [ fig : valueplot ] suggests that the optimal value function is smooth , however proving smoothness is  due to the degeneracy of the hjb equation , which is highly non - standard  out of the scope of this paper .",
    "+ figure [ fig : valuecomp ] compares the resulting value function to the one from the bayesian case .",
    "we observe that for a smaller estimate of the drift the value is higher in the case with switching , and for a high estimate of the drift the value is higher in the bayesian case .",
    "this is due to the fact that if a high drift is expected in the bayesian case , it is more probable that the drift is in fact high , whereas in the case studied in this paper the drift might change to the worse . for a small estimate of the drift",
    "it is exactly the other way round .",

    "figure [ fig : kgrows ] suggests that for growing parameter @xmath256 the dividend policy converges to what we expect to be the optimal barrier level in the case of unbounded dividend payments . in future research , it would be of interest to study the singular control problem with unbounded dividend rates .    .",

    "remember however that in their setup the current state is observable , and therefore it can always be decided which threshold level has to be chosen .",
    "+ in our case , as the current state is estimated in a continuous way , we have only one threshold level .",
    "we see that the numerical approximation of the optimal dividend policy is of threshold type with a threshold level @xmath259 depending on the estimate of the drift , and hence is of the form @xmath260    therefore , it is of considerable importance to study the admissibility of this type of strategies .",

    "we have presented a diffusion model for the surplus process of an insurance company , where the drift coefficient changes in response to a change of the economic environment .",
    "+ the change of the economic environment has been modeled by a markov chain , and uncertainty has been introduced by not allowing to observe the current state of the markov chain .",
    "we have shown how to overcome uncertainty in this situation by applying a result from stochastic filtering theory .",
    "then we have stated the dividend maximization problem and we have derived the associated hjb equation .",
    "+ we have been able to characterize the solution to the stochastic optimization problem as the unique viscosity solution to this hjb equation .",
    "+ finally , we have presented an extensive numerical study for the solution to the optimization problem , which suggests that the optimal dividend policy is of threshold type .",
    "we have shown that such strategies are indeed admissible using a non - standard result on stochastic differential equations .",
    "+ the main contribution of the current paper is the improvement of the regime switching models that have been studied in the literature by not assuming full information any more .",
