    "the purpose of this paper is to present a new sufficient condition ( which is almost necessary ) on a pointwise precompact sequence @xmath12 of functions @xmath13 mapping a subset @xmath4 of the real line @xmath14 into a metric space  @xmath15 , under which the sequence admits a pointwise convergent subsequence . the historically first result in this direction is the classical _ helly selection principle _ , in which the assumptions are as follows : @xmath16 $ ] is a closed interval , @xmath17 , and @xmath5 is uniformly bounded and consists of monotone functions ( @xcite , ( * ? ? ? *",
    "ii.8.910 ) , ( * ? ? ?",

    "since a real function on @xmath4 of bounded ( jordan ) variation is the difference of two nondecreasing bounded functions , helly s theorem extends to uniformly bounded sequences of functions , whose jordan s variations are uniformly bounded .",
    "further generalizations of the latter pointwise selection principle are concerned with replacement of jordan s variation by more general notions of variation ( @xcite , @xcite@xcite , @xcite ) . in all these papers ,",
    "the pointwise limit of the extracted subsequence of @xmath5 is a function of bounded generalized variation ( in the corresponding sense ) , and so , it is a regulated function ( with finite one - sided limits at all points of the domain ) . note that pointwise selection principles ( or the sequential compactness in the topology of pointwise convergence ) and regulated functions are of importance in real analysis ( @xcite ) , stochastic analysis and generalized integration ( @xcite ) , optimization ( @xcite ) , set - valued analysis ( @xcite ) , and other fields .",
    "a unified approach to the diverse selection principles mentioned above was proposed in @xcite .",
    "it is based on the notion of _ modulus of variation _ of a function introduced in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) and does not refer to the uniform boundedness of variations of any kind , and so , can be applied to sequences of non - regulated functions .",
    "however , the pointwise limit of the extracted subsequence of @xmath5 is _ again _ a regulated function . in order to clarify this situation and expand the amount of sequences having pointwise convergent subsequences , we define the notion of the _ joint modulus of variation _ for metric space valued functions : this is a certain sequence of pseudometrics @xmath2 on the product set @xmath3 ( of all functions from @xmath4 into @xmath1 ) . making use of @xmath2",
    ", we obtain a powerful pointwise selection principle ( see theorem  [ t : first ] in section  [ s : main ] ) .",
    "putting @xmath18 for all @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is a constant function , we get the selection principle from @xcite , which already contains all selection principles alluded to above as particular cases . in contrast to results from @xcite , the pointwise limit @xmath21 from theorem  [ t : first ] may not be regulated in general  this depends on the limit function @xmath22 , namely , since @xmath23 , the function @xmath21 is only conditionally regulated with respect to  @xmath22 ( in short , _ @xmath22-regulated _ ) . in particular , if @xmath24 ,    finally , we point out that following the ideas from @xcite , theorem  [ t : first ] may be extended to sequences of functions with values in a _ uniform space _  @xmath1 .    the paper is organized as follows . in section  [",
