    "nuclear collisions at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) have been interpreted within a hydrodynamic ( hydro ) context in terms of formation of a thermalized , flowing partonic medium with small viscosity  @xcite .",

    "the jet interpretation of the ss 2d peak has been challenged in the literature .",
    "one strategy was based on introduction of `` triangular flow '' to angular correlations . according to a conjecture in ref .",
    "@xcite triangular flow should correspond to `` triangularity '' of the event - wise initial - state overlap geometry .",
    "triangular flow would explain both the ss peak and as double peak in more - central collisions  @xcite previously attributed to mach cones  @xcite . in a more - recent strategy `` higher harmonic flows '' were invoked to explain all aspects of the @xmath2-elongated ss peak or `` soft ridge ''  @xcite .",
    "the various harmonic flows were attributed to fluctuations in the initial - state geometry coupled to radial expansion of the bulk medium  @xcite . in an alternative scheme the elongated ss 2d peak",
    "was explained in terms of glasma flux tubes coupled to radial flow  @xcite .",
    "the problem of cylindrical multipoles ( fourier series coefficients ) derived from 1d projection of all 2d angular correlations onto 1d azimuth was considered in ref .",
    "that study concluded that in almost all cases claimed higher harmonic flows ( fourier series index @xmath4 ) are actually 1d fourier components of the ss 2d peak .",
    "the ss peak can be represented accurately by a factorized 2d model function  @xcite but _ not _ by a 1d fourier series due to substantial @xmath2 variation of the peak structure , and some peak properties remain consistent with jet formation .    in the present study",
    "we confront a more subtle issue : if a sextupole fourier element is added to the `` standard '' 2d fit model described in ref .",
    "@xcite and a nonzero sextupole amplitude results , what does that imply physically ? does a nonzero sextupole amplitude _ necessarily _ imply that `` triangular flow '' plays a role in nuclear collisions ?",

    "substantial variations in several parameter values do arise when the number of model parameters exceeds that required by the correlation structure in the data .",

    "for instance , the dipole term of a single 1d fourier series representing all projected 2d angular correlations @xmath116 is the _ difference between two large numbers _ , the dipole component of the ss 2d peak ( positive ) and the as dipole ( negative ) representing jet structure in at least some collisions  @xcite .",
    "the small difference has been attributed to `` rapidity - even directed flow '' and `` global momentum conservation ''  @xcite .",
    "jet structure is thereby obscured .",
    "the net quadrupole term represented by @xmath117 includes the substantial quadrupole component of the ss 2d peak as well as the nonjet component .",
    "the sextupole term is derived from the ss 2d peak as @xmath118 .",
    "in contrast , the standard fit model described in sec .  [ stdfit ] accommodates all correlation structure on and @xmath60 .",
    "each model element represents a single observed correlation component , facilitating unique interpretations .",
    "the main problem addressed by this study is the systematic significance of sextupole and higher multipole amplitudes that may be inferred by adding @xmath119 terms with @xmath4 to the standard 2d angular correlation model .",
    "if one or more higher multipole elements are added to the standard 2d model are resulting nonzero amplitudes physically meaningful ? in this study",
    "we have isolated two major issues : ( a ) additional model elements may exceed what is _ required _ by correlation structure measured within some detector @xmath2 acceptance leading to large systematic uncertainties in certain model parameters , and ( b ) some _ fractions _ of several model multipoles may combine to form a peaked structure on azimuth that plays an unanticipated role in the 2d data model .    in sec .",
    "[ 2dsex ] we demonstrated that the ss 2d peak for data obtained from more - central collisions within a limited @xmath2 acceptance may only constrain two model parameters on @xmath40 .",
    "addition of a sextupole amplitude to the standard fit model is equivalent to addition of a third parameter ( an offset ) to the ss peak model .",
    "the extraneous model parameter effectively _ amplifies _ relatively small and systematically insignificant variations in the data to appear as relatively large _ but still systematically insignificant _ variations in the extraneous parameter , but also in other parameters now coupled to it .",
    "although individual model parameters may then seem unstable the _ overall model _ is not changed significantly .",
    "the problem is resolved by removing the extraneous parameter(s ) per the principle of parsimony or ockham s razor .    in sec .",
    "[ nononjet ] we demonstrated that whereas the nonjet quadrupole is a necessary and unique element of the standard fit model independent of the ss 2d peak a nonjet sextupole is not a necessary element . a nj sextupole component can not be isolated ( with systematic significance ) from the ss 2d peak structure .",
    "what is uniquely defined is the ss 2d peak relative to fitted as dipole and nj quadrupole within the standard fit model . the structure of the ss peak is factorizable , and each factor can be represented by a functional form .",
    "that unique structure can then be compared to theoretical predictions in whole or in parts according to explicit hypothesis .",
    "for almost all 2d angular correlations from rhic collisions the data histograms within some limited @xmath2 acceptance can be described by the `` standard fit model '' consisting of an away - side 1d dipole , a nonjet quadrupole and a same - side 2d peak .",
    "we have shown that any `` higher harmonics '' must then originate with the ss 2d peak .",
    "but for a small fraction of the data , associated with what may be called `` extreme conditions , '' angular correlation structure may deviate substantially from the standard fit model .",
    "such conditions include high-@xmath6 `` trigger - associated '' cuts , cuts favoring large collision multiplicities , acceptance cuts emphasizing large @xmath2 values and `` ultra - central '' collisions ( 0 - 1% central ) .    for and more - peripheral collisions the entire ss 2d peak is resolved within the star tpc angular acceptance and the correlation model is fully constrained .",
    "the ss 2d peak model is unambiguous : a 2d gaussian .",
    "the ss peak continues to be well resolved until well above the sharp transition in peak properties at @xmath120  @xcite .",
    "however , in more - central collisions the elongated ss 2d peak extends sufficiently far outside the tpc @xmath2 acceptance that its modeling on @xmath40 becomes ambiguous .",
    "when only a fraction of the ss peak is observed some peak properties ( e.g. , amplitude and curvature at the mode ) are more reliably determined than others ( e.g. , higher moments , tail structure ) .",
    "if a greater fraction of the ss 2d peak becomes accessible within a larger detector acceptance more peak properties can be determined , including possible non - gaussian tails at larger @xmath40 .",
    "substantial deviations of same - side and away - side peak structure from the standard fit model are observed at the rhic and lhc for certain combinations of the extreme conditions listed above .",
    "the ss 2d peak acquires long tails on @xmath40 , and the as 1d peak develops a substantial deformation .",
    "all such deviations can be described in terms of changes in the ss 2d or as 1d peak model functions . in the former case",
    "the change appears restricted to the 1d @xmath59 factor , and modified gaussian or non - gaussian peaked functions are available ( e.g. , sec .",
    "iv - c of ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "but a trend has emerged to decompose the ss 2d peak into `` jet - like '' ( small @xmath40 ) and `` ridge - like '' ( large @xmath40 ) components and to model the latter with a 1d fourier series _ in common with all other correlation structure _",
    "( i.e. , nonjet quadrupole and as 1d peak ) .",
    "single fourier terms may actually represent multiple physical mechanisms , including jet formation .",
    "however , the convention is adopted to interpret each term as a harmonic flow , including the @xmath55 dipole . in that system the connection with established jet structure in peripheral collisions is broken , and there can be no consistent description of centrality evolution .",
    "consistency could be restored by acknowledging that whatever the imposed conditions , modeling the ss 2d and as 1d peaks separately is essential .",
    "a single 1d fourier series representing two peaked structures plus other nonjet components is not interpretable .",
    "the information contained in 2d angular correlation data from nuclear collisions , both @xmath6-integral and @xmath6-differential , is extensive and could be used to eliminate invalid theoretical models and suggest valid physical interpretations .",
    "however , some analysis methods minimize and distort that information by ( a ) projection onto subspaces and ( b ) many - to - one and one - to - many mappings between correlation components and model elements .",
    "recently , a major initiative has emerged to infer `` higher harmonic flows '' ( azimuth multipoles ) from correlation data .",
    "fourier analysis of angular correlations projected onto 1d azimuth from limited pseudorapidity intervals is used to infer such multipoles .",
    "however , 1d fourier analysis conflicts with 2d model fits to unprojected angular correlations in which apparent jet - like structure appears to dominate correlations . to help resolve the impasse we have conducted a detailed study of 2d angular correlation analysis methods and interpretations relating to the question of `` higher harmonic flows . ''",
    "a 1d fourier analysis of 2d angular correlations projected onto azimuth must describe the periodic data accurately by definition .",
    "but there is nothing to compel interpretation of the series terms as flows .",
    "the unprojected 2d structure can be decomposed precisely into several components that retain their identity from collisions to central collisions .",
    "one of those components , the same - side 2d peak , is strongly structured on pseudorapidity .",
    "a single 1d fourier series can not model that component and therefore _ fails as a data model_. more - detailed examination establishes that multiple correlation components contribute to some individual fourier terms ( many - to - one ) and some correlation components contribute to multiple fourier terms ( one - to - many ) leading to severe interpretation difficulties .",
    "further analysis establishes that `` higher harmonics '' inferred from 1d fourier analysis are at least dominated by the ss 2d ( jet - related ) peak .",
    "a potential remedy for such ambiguities might be achieved by adding higher multipole terms to the `` standard fit model '' of angular correlations that successfully describes and more - peripheral correlations .",
    "however , we demonstrate in this study that additional multipole elements can conspire to contribute to the jet - related ss 2d peak model rather than representing sought - after _ nonjet _ multipoles that might be interpreted as flows . for more - central data adding @xmath4 terms to the standard data model leads to _ systematically insignificant _ changes in the ss 2d peak model .",
    "although some model parameters may change substantially the overall data model ( sum of the elements ) is quite stable and provides a unique 2d data description .",
    "the last part of the study was determination of the _ necessity _ for nonjet higher multipoles in the data description .",
    "a known sextupole contribution was added to a data histogram and fitted with the standard 2d data model .",
    "the result was a change in the inferred ss 2d peak structure but no appearance of the sextupole component in the fit residuals .",
    "in contrast , omission of the nonjet quadrupole element from the fit model produced an equivalent component in the fit residuals .",
    "the nonjet quadrupole is thus a necessary and distinct model element .",
    "but we conclude that it is impossible to isolate higher nonjet multipoles from the ss 2d peak structure .",
    "it has been argued that at least in more - central collisions some part or all of the ss 2d peak is a flow phenomenon .",
    "its fourier components might then be interpreted legitimately as flow manifestations . however",
    ", a general model - independent analysis program should confront the _",
    "intact _ structure of the ss 2d peak to determine the correct @xmath59 functional form vs systematic conditions .",
    "theory tests must accommodate the ss 2d peak in its entirety , with all its related phenomenology , or fail .",
