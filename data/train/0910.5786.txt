    "the quantum hall effect ( qhe ) is one of the most peculiar phenomena in two - dimensional electron system .",
    "the quantized hall conductance @xmath0 has been widely accepted as a topological quantity @xcite . when the chemical potential is located within an energy gap , the @xmath0",
    "is given as @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a chern number , which is an topological integer defined for occupied states .",
    "the @xmath2 has been computed for simple tight - binding models and exotic nature of electron states under uniform magnetic field has been revealed .",
    "recently , the discovery of anomalous qhe in graphene @xcite shed a new light to the quantization of hall conductance .",
    "the @xmath0 of graphene shows quantized plateaux at @xmath3 per spin , where @xmath4 is an integer .",
    "this means that only plateaux with odd number appear and the plateau corresponding to @xmath5 does not occur .",
    "this anomalous qhe originates from the massless dirac particles realized at the @xmath6 and @xmath7 points in the brillouin zone of graphene .    in our previous study @xcite , we calculated chern numbers for realistic multi - band tight - binding models , which describe electrons on graphene .",
    "we found that anomalous quantization of hall conductance persists up to van - hove singularities , as shown in the previous calculations using simplified model @xcite .",
    "in addition , the envelope of quantized hall conductance can be well explained with semi - classical expressions .",
    "we further found that the onsager s quantization rule @xcite , @xmath8 can predict the positions of plateaux when the band dispersion is well described by single band . here , @xmath9 is magnetic flux penetrating in a unit cell and @xmath10 is the area of irreducible brillouin zone . for dirac particle regions , above equation also reproduces the positions of landau levels if we choose maslov index @xmath11 . as this expression",
    "does not rely on the linear dispersion of dirac particles , it can be applicable in wide energy region .",
    "therefore , this expression may be utilized for analysis of qhe and other phenomena of landau quantization , _",
    "e. g. _ , de haas - van alphen effects .    in this paper ,",
    "we extend our study to modified version of tight - binding models related to graphene layers . we study how the sequence of chern numbers may be altered and whether semi - classical rules can be applicable to the extended models .",
    "we describe electrons on honeycomb lattice by tight - binding models .",
    "the spin degeneracy is ignored for simplicity .",
    "the uniform magnetic field is introduced as phase factors @xmath12 of hoppings so that they satisfy @xmath13 . as the original translational symmetry is broken under uniform magnetic field",
    ", we must consider magnetic translational symmetry , which is characterized by the magnetic flux @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the area of a unit cell and @xmath16 is the quantized magnetic flux .",
    "when @xmath9 is a rational number @xmath17 , we recover enlarged magnetic unit cell whose area is @xmath18 times larger than that of the original cell",
    ". then , eigenstates are labeled by a wave - number @xmath19 .",
    "thus , an energy band splits into @xmath18 sub - bands by the uniform field .",
    "although the chern number @xmath2 is given by a sum of the chern numbers of all filled bands @xcite , evaluation of them separately causes numerical difficulty since one needs to treat many chern numbers for the weak field limit , where most of them cancel with each other .",
    "physical chern number of the filled many body state is stable if the energy gap above the fermi energy is stable .",
    "it is independent of a possible level crossing at far below the fermi energy .",
    "then the non abelian formulation of the chern number by collecting all of the filled bands into a single multiplet @xmath20 is quite useful @xcite .",
    "then the chern number @xmath2 of the multiplet @xmath20 is calculated by discretizing the brillouin zone into mesh @xmath21 as @xcite @xmath22 ^ * \\\\ u_\\mu({\\bm{k } } )   & = & \\det [ \\psi({\\bm{k } } ) ] ^\\dagger \\psi({\\bm{k}}+\\delta{\\bm{k}}_\\mu ) \\\\",
    "\\psi({\\bm{k } } )   & = & ( |\\psi_1({\\bm{k } } ) \\rangle , \\cdots , |\\psi_m({\\bm{k}})\\rangle ) \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is a discretized momentum along @xmath24 direction , @xmath25 is a bloch state of the band index @xmath26 and @xmath27 is the highest occupied energy band below the chemical potential @xmath28 .",
    "this expression can be understood as a two - dimensional analogue of the ksv formula @xcite .",
    "this formulation was successfully applied to quantum hall effect on a disorder system@xcite , graphene@xcite . when the field @xmath29 is sufficiently small , @xmath30 sub - bands are grouped together in general .",
    "these grouped bands correspond to a landau band of nearly free electrons .",
    "hereafter , we treat the field @xmath31 , which enables us to consider the weak - field limit easily .",
    "we treat a honeycomb lattice with two inequivalent sites a and b as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : graphene1](a ) .",
    "single @xmath32-orbital is put on each site . the hoppings between nearest and next - nearest neighbor sites",
    "are included with parameters @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "the on - site energies are set to @xmath35 for a and b sites .",
    "hereafter , we set @xmath36 , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath33 is chosen as an energy scale .",
    "when @xmath37 , this model describes simplified @xmath32-bands on graphene and the band dispersions which resemble zero - mass dirac cones exist at two symmetrically equivalent points , @xmath6 ( 1/3 1/3 ) and @xmath7 ( 2/3 2/3 ) , in the irreducible brillouin zone .",
    "the qhe of this model has been extensively studied theoretically @xcite . here",
    ", we briefly explain the correspondence between quantum mechanical treatment by chern numbers and semi - classical quantization rule ( [ eq : onsager ] ) .",
    "the calculated chern numbers for @xmath38 are plotted as a function of chemical potential in lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : graphene - qhe ] .",
    "the upper panel shows the total density of states ( dos ) when magnetic field is absent . from these figures",
    ", we can easily recognize that large discontinuous jumps of chern numbers correspond to van - hove singularities at @xmath39 . within semi - classical theory ,",
    "this discontinuity can be explained as a topological transitions of fermi surface from electron ( hole ) pockets to hole ( electron ) pockets@xcite .",
    "[ fig : graphene - qhe2 ] presents enlarged views of chern numbers near the van - hove singularity at @xmath40 .",
    "anomalous qhe survives up to van - hove singularities and the sequence of chern numbers is odd number only , while above singularities chern numbers change with steps of 1 , recovering ordinary qhe @xcite . for both regions , semi - classical quantization rule ( [ eq : onsager ] ) can explain the positions of landau levels if we choose @xmath41 at ordinary qhe region and @xmath11 at anomalous qhe region .",
    "this result is non - trivial near the van - hove singularity as the band dispersion around @xmath40 is significantly deformed from the continuum expressions of massless dirac @xmath42 or normal effective mass theory @xmath43 .",
    "we extend our calculations by incorporating next nearest neighbor @xmath34 and staggered on - site energy @xmath44 . when @xmath45 , the hoppings @xmath34 alone do not destroy the massless dirac cones . in this case",
    ", the calculated chern number sequence remains with @xmath46 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hex2](a ) . the positions of landau levels",
    "are still explained with the semi - classical quantization with @xmath11 .    with finite @xmath47 , the dirac cones at @xmath6 and @xmath7 acquire band gaps of order @xmath48 , which means that dirac particles have finite `` mass '' . when the chemical potential is located above the gap , fermi surface is still constructed by two electron pockets around @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "in addition , the electronic states around @xmath6 and @xmath7 are related by lattice symmetry .",
    "if we interpret this band structure naively , we may expect that two ordinary electron pockets generate landau levels at same energies and that chern numbers between adjacent energy gaps differ by 2 .",
    "however , we found that such interpretation does not hold for current model .",

    ", the positions of landau levels do not agree with semi - classical rule([eq : onsager ] ) with @xmath49 nor @xmath50 .",
    "these results mean that electron pockets near @xmath6 and @xmath7 generate landau levels at different energy positions even though they are equivalent when magnetic field is absent .",

    "the qhe of bilayer graphene was observed experimentally @xcite and its electronic structure has been studied extensively@xcite . within the present model , the electron - hole symmetry is maintained and band dispersions are symmetric around @xmath63 .",
