    "the transverse position and momentum of single photons are utilized as conjugate quantum variables in many interesting fundamental investigations of quantum mechanics such as complementarity relations @xcite , continuous variable ( cv ) entanglement @xcite and the spatial demonstration of einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) correlations @xcite . in the cv regime ,",
    "the observation of spatial entanglement of photon pairs from spontaneous parametric down - conversion ( spdc ) typically requires the measurement of the detection probabilities associated with the joint distribution for the position and momenta of the photons , from which non - separability @xcite and epr @xcite criteria can be tested .",
    "albeit fundamentally continuous , these distributions in a real - world experiment are subjected to the coarse - graining imposed by the detector resolution @xcite . even though typical cv entanglement and epr criteria have been adapted for coarse - grained measurements @xcite ,",
    "the experimental assessment of the position and momentum correlations necessary for entanglement detection require a large number of measurements , as the spatial entanglement generated in the spdc process can be very high - dimensional .",
    "recently , howland _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have shown that the use of compressive sensing techniques allows for the reconstruction of the spdc joint detection probabilities with an efficiency improvement over a raster scanning procedure with equivalent resolution .",
    "this efficiency improvement is twofold : firstly , due to the sparsity of the joint detection probabilities ( the detection modes are highly correlated ) , a lower number of measurements is needed in the compressive reconstruction algorithm ; secondly , the random binary patterns used in the compressed measurement scheme permits the use of a higher , approximately uniform joint detection rate .",
    "although this scheme allows for a more efficient characterization of the spatial correlations , the identification of entanglement is still bound to the application of the typical cv entanglement criteria @xcite , based on the evaluation of the moments @xcite or entropy @xcite of the reconstructed distributions .    in the present contribution",
    ", we show that a finite set of periodic amplitude masks ( playing the role of mode analyzers ) can be successfully used to investigate spatial correlations of photons in the transverse linear position and momentum domain . to this end , we choose a complete set of orthogonal mode analyzers comprising @xmath0 _ spatial masks _ with the shape of a periodic array of slits , characterized by a slit periodicity @xmath3 and a slit width @xmath4 . in this scenario ,",
    "the spatial variables of photons are subject to a @xmath0-outcome measurement that is equivalent to a periodic binning across one of the transverse spatial directions . differently from analysing a @xmath0-dimensional subset of all available modes @xcite ,",
    "the spatial masks act as mode analyzers over the entire field of view of the photons .",
    "our @xmath0-outcome measurement can be regarded as a discrimination of @xmath0-dimensional , orthogonal single - photon images of the spatial masks @xcite .",
    "based on these @xmath0-outcome measurements performed in position and momentum domains , we derive and implement _ entanglement criteria _ for bipartite cv systems .",
    "we generate spatially - entangled photon pairs with a spdc source and measure their transverse spatial variables according to this discretization procedure . in our experiment , these measurements are realized by positioning the spatial masks in the image plane and far - field of the spdc source .",
    "our entanglement criteria are based on a correlation quantifier  often used as a correlation measure for discrete quantum systems  called the _ mutual predictability _ @xcite or the coincidence rate @xcite , which are directly computable from the @xmath1 joint detection rates over the spatial masks .",
    "thus , they do not rely on the reconstruction of the position and momentum joint probability distributions .",
    "interestingly , the periodicity of the spatial masks used in position ( @xmath5 ) and momentum ( @xmath6 ) measurements work as free parameters that can be independently tuned to optimize the entanglement detection .",
    "moreover , we show that useful cv entanglement criteria are obtained even for @xmath7 , which represents the most extreme coarse - grained measurement possible with this scheme .",
    "it is worth noting that our results are applicable to any quantum continuous variable , and can be used even if a complete cv measurement has been made , as it is possible to post - process the measured distributions into the necessary periodic binning structure .",
    "we tested for spatial entanglement of the photon pairs from spdc using measurement dimensionality ranging from @xmath7 up to @xmath8 .",
    "the data together with the adjusted theoretical procedure allow us to reliably confirm cv entanglement with as few as @xmath2 joint projective measurements ( for @xmath7 ) and @xmath9 joint projective measurements ( for @xmath10 ) . in total",
    ", we tested @xmath11 different combinations of mask periods and dimensions , being able to show spatial entanglement in @xmath12 of them , @xmath13 of all the studied cases .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in section [ sec : theory ] , we provide the theoretical background necessary for the development of our entanglement criteria ; our experimental scheme and measurements with the periodic spatial masks are described in section [ sec : experiment ] ; section [ sec : entcriteria ] is devoted to the derivation of our cv entanglement criteria ; the analysis of our experimental data with the derived entanglement criteria is presented in section [ sec : results ] ; we finally conclude in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "the mutual predictability @xcite , a building block of our entanglement detection procedure , is a correlation function associated with a measurement of two @xmath0-outcome observables @xmath14 and @xmath15 performed on the two parties of a bipartite quantum system @xmath16 . given the joint probability distribution @xmath17 encoding the probability that subsystem @xmath18 is found in the eigenstate @xmath19 of observable @xmath14 and subsystem @xmath20 is found in the eigenstate @xmath21 of observable @xmath15 , the mutual predictability reads @xmath22 the function @xmath23 is a permutation of indices maximizing the right hand side of ( [ eq : mutualpredictability ] ) , so that @xmath24 measures the probability of obtaining paired ( related by @xmath25 @xcite ) measurement  outcomes @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "the mutual predictability attains its maximal value equal to @xmath28 for maximally correlated measurement outcomes , whereas its minimal value @xmath29 is achieved for completely uncorrelated outcomes .",

    "for this , two sets @xmath30 and @xmath31 of maximally incompatible observables ( with mutually unbiased eigenbases @xcite ) need to be considered .",

    "furthermore , coarse - grained versions of cv entanglement and epr steering criteria have been recently developed @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we consider conjugate spatial variables of single photons , namely the transverse position and the wave - vector , which satisfy the above commutation relation with @xmath46 . for the sake of brevity",
    ", we will refer to the transverse wave - vector as the transverse momentum or simply the momentum .",
    "our results , nevertheless , are applicable to any quantum continuous variables .",
    "in the experimental part of our investigations , we use an spdc source to generate photon pairs entangled in their transverse spatial variables .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , we analyze their transverse position and momentum using a finite set of orthogonal spatial masks ( @xmath47 ) @xmath48 each of the mask functions defined in eq . is a periodic square wave with spatial period @xmath3 and slit width @xmath4 .",
    "the variable @xmath49 over which the mask function is defined represents the cv being measured . in our case",

    "[ fig : es](a ) .",
    "we adjust the spdc source to emit frequency - degenerate down - converted photons at @xmath54 nm in a collinear configuration .",
    "the down - converted photons are split by a beam splitter and directed to spatial light modulators ( slm ) , which are programmed to display the spatial masks described by eq . in the horizontal direction @xmath55 , as illustrated in fig .",

    "the optical magnifications both for image plane ( ip ) and far - field ( ff ) configurations were chosen in order to maximize the spatial resolution of our measurements while keeping the down - converted beams enclosed within the slm panel , which have an active area of @xmath58 mm @xmath59 mm .",
    "the photons reflected from the slms are lens - coupled to multi - mode optical fibres connected to single - photon avalanche diodes ( spad ) .",
    "further details about our spdc source and experimental apparatus are provided in sec .",

    "the spatial masks displayed on the slms work as aperture functions , reflecting the photons incident upon the white stripes ( where @xmath60 ) and discarding the photons incident upon the black region ( where @xmath61 ) . in fig .",

    "on the other hand , for @xmath77 mm , we observe an approximately triangular oscillation of the coincidence counts , resembling the convolution of two slits , each of width @xmath78 or @xmath79 .    on the right - hand side of fig .",

    "the joint detection probabilities at the slms , @xmath85 and @xmath86 , associated with ip and ff measurements , correspond to the rescaled versions of the distributions in eqs . and , respectively .",
    "as the photons at the spdc source are position  correlated , maximum coincidence counts in the image plane occurs for a combination of masks obeying @xmath87 . in the momentum domain , however , the photons are anti - correlated , so that maximum coincidence counts in the far - field are found for a combination of masks satisfying @xmath88 . for increasing values of the period , the @xmath35 matrices representing @xmath89 and @xmath90 acquire a diagonal and anti - diagonal structure , respectively , reflecting the epr - type spatial correlations displayed by the spdc photons @xcite .    in the next step ,",

    "it is also evident from fig .",
    "[ fig : oscillations ] that the correlations in the momentum domain are stronger than those in position .",
    "this happens due to the optical magnifications used to obtain the image and far - field pattern ( see supplementary material , sec .",
    "our goal is to use the mutual predictabilities given in eqs . and to test for entanglement of the spatial variables of the two - photon state from spdc . to this end",

    "the bound in inequality given by @xmath96 is a function of the dimension parameter only .",
    "although the position and momentum bases constitute a pair of mubs in the cv scenario @xcite , our d - outcome position and momentum measurements do not strictly satisfy the condition of maximal incompatibility @xcite for a d - dimensional hilbert space .",
    "then , in order to construct an useful and reliable entanglement criterion from the mutual predictabilities and , we need a tight upper bound for their sum , valid for separable cv states . similar bounds , present in other known cv entanglement criteria , are usually obtained from uncertainty relations associated with the conjugate variables of the cv system .",
    "for example , in the case of continuous measurements of position and momentum variables , the relevant uncertainty relation comes from the fourier transform relationship between position and momentum eigenstates ( canonical commutation relations ) .",
    "modifications of the heisenberg uncertainty relation applicable to coarse - grained measurements were provided in ref .",

    "the operators associated with the measurements involving spatial masks can be written as :    @xmath97    the detection plane bases are related to the position / momentum bases as @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "these two sets of projection operators , @xmath100 and @xmath101 , form complete sets in the meaning that they are sufficient to detect any non - zero position or momentum component of the physical state , _",

    "our aim is thus to find a non - trivial bound @xmath105 , sharp enough to be useful in experimental applications .",

    "interestingly , the relation @xmath121 ( @xmath122 ) lead to the trivial value @xmath123 , meaning that no entanglement detection is possible using this specific combination of mask periods .",
    "the appreciation of this fact comes from the commutativity of the measurement operators in eqs . and , a joint eigenstate of which , given by a normalized version of a dirac comb , is possible when the periodicity of the spatial masks match those of the comb in both domains @xcite .",
