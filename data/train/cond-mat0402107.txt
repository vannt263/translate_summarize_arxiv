    "this paper concerns the formation of micelles , which are the simplest form of amphiphilic assemblies .",
    "our treatment of this phenomenon is based upon the length scale dependence of hydrophobic effects  @xcite .",
    "namely , the free energy to solvate small hydrophobic molecules scales linearly with solute volume , while that to solvate large hydrophobic species scales linearly with surface area .",
    "the crossover from one regime to the other occurs when the oily species presents a surface in water extending over about @xmath0 . due to these contrasting scalings ,",
    "the free energy to solvate a collection of small oily species that are well separated in water can exceed that of solvating a large cluster of these same species .",
    "the resulting free energy difference is the hydrophobic driving force for assembly . while this force that derives from this scaling difference is surely the mechanism that drives oil - water phase separation",
    ", one may wonder if it is also applicable in the case of amphiphilic assembly where interfaces between solute clusters and water contain polar or charged head - groups as well as oil . in this paper , we argue that it is indeed applicable .",
    "the primary difference between oil - water phase separation and amphiphilic assembly is due to stoichiometry .",
    "each amphiphilic molecule contains an oily species that is constrained to remain within a molecular length of a hydrophilic species . for large clusters of amphiphiles",
    ", this constraint leads to an entropic cost for clustering oily components that grows faster than cluster volume .",
    "thus , unlike simple oil - water phase separation which forms macroscopic domains , growth of amphiphilic assemblies is limited to mesoscopic domains .",
    "our treatment of this effect uses an estimate of entropy  @xcite obtained from an electrostatic analogy for stoichiometric constraints  @xcite . in the next section ,",
    "we describe this estimate along with the other factors that contribute to micelle formation . the resulting expression for the critical micelle concentration , @xmath1 ,",
    "is then compared with experiments in section iii . in particular",
    ", we show that our expression yields good predictions of this concentration , changing with temperature and with amphiphile chain length in accord with experimental observations .",
    "an appendix is used to augment the discussion in section ii .",
    "we consider an aqueous solution of neutral amphiphilic molecules ( i.e. , non - ionic surfactants ) , each of which has a single alkyl chain as its hydrophobic tail . in general",
    ", amphiphiles can form aggregates of various sizes and shapes .",
    "we will assume each micelle is spherical and neglect the effects of fluctuations in micelle size and shape .",
    "thus , we imagine that each surfactant molecule exists either as a monomer or as part of a spherical @xmath2-mer .",
    "we denote the number densities of the monomers and @xmath2-mers by @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively , so that the total surfactant concentration is given by @xmath5 .",
    "the concentrations of monomers and micelles are related by the law of mass action @xcite , @xmath6 where @xmath7 denotes inverse temperature ( i.e. , @xmath8 , @xmath9 is a microscopic length that specifies the standard state convention , and @xmath10 is the driving force for assembly , namely , the free energy of the @xmath2-mer , @xmath11 , relative to that of @xmath2 monomers , @xmath12 . we take @xmath9 to be approximately the girth of a surfactant molecule , see fig . [",
    "fig : micelles ] .    for large @xmath2 , eq  [ eq : massaction ] implies the existence of a threshold concentration of surfactant molecules @xmath1 , at which the density of aggregates becomes significant . because this crossover is precipitous , its location is almost independent of the specific definition of the threshold as long as it is physically sensible .",
    "specifically , to within corrections of order @xmath13 , @xmath14 the driving force per surfactant , @xmath15 , is a function of @xmath2 , and it is to be evaluated at the most probable aggregation number , @xmath16 .",
    "this number is the value of @xmath2 that minimizes @xmath15 .",
    "equation [ eq : cmcgeneral ] is discussed further in the appendix .",
    "the contributions to @xmath17 can be found in three steps , employing the thermodynamic cycle illustrated in fig .",

    "\\1 ) _ creation of a cavity . _",
    "a micelle will fill a region vacated by water . assuming the extent of the surface is at least 1 nm@xmath18 the free energy to create this cavity is @xmath19 where @xmath20 denotes the surface area of the cavity , and @xmath21 is the water ",
    "vapor surface tension . in general",
    ", there is also pressure  volume work for forming a cavity in a liquid . for water at standard conditions , pressure is sufficiently small that this contribution is negligible for cavities with diameters less than 5 nm .",
    "we will limit our consideration to sizes within this range .",
    "\\2 ) _ filling the hydrophobic core_. imagine disconnecting each hydrophobic tail in a surfactant from its respective hydrophilic head group and moving the hydrophobic tail from water into the micelle core ( we will reconnect the heads and tails in step 3 ) .",
    "a total of @xmath2 tails must be moved to fill the cavity formed in step  1 . as such",
    ", one part of the free energy to fill the cavity is @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the free energy change in transferring the hydrophobic tail ( e.g. , an alkane chain ) from water into the oily hydrophobic core .",
    "an additional part of the free energy for filling the cavity is an interfacial contribution due to the presence of van der waals attractions between oil and water .",
    "these interactions cause the oil - water surface tension , @xmath24 , to be lower than the water - vapor surface tension , @xmath21 ( see , for instance , ref .  ) .",
    "thus , the free energy for filling the cavity is @xmath25 where @xmath26 .",
    "the interior of a micelle is densely packed and much like a hydrocarbon liquid  @xcite .",
    "thus , @xmath27 is close to the transfer free energy for moving the associated alkane chain from oil into water .",
    "however , it is slightly smaller than this value because the environment of an alkane chain in a micelle interior is more confining than that in bulk oil  @xcite",
    ". the numerical consequence of this small difference will be discussed in sec .",
    "to the extent that the micelle is spherical , @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the micelle radius .",
    "since the interior is densely packed , @xmath29 is given by @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the mean length over which a polar head group is separated from an alkyl group within a surfactant molecule , see fig .",
    "1 . from these considerations ,",
    "@xmath32 where @xmath33 .",
    "the right - hand side of eq [ eq : delta - g_1+delta - g_2 ] is essentially the free energy for nucleating oil clusters in water  @xcite .",
    "it is the hydrophobic driving force identified in the lum - chandler - weeks theory  @xcite .",
    "the first term is proportional to the volume of hydrophobic units .",
    "the second term is proportional to the area of the interface .",
    "the first term is extensive in @xmath2 and dominates at large @xmath2 .",
    "thus , if only @xmath34 and @xmath35 were significant , the strength of the driving force would grow without bound leading to macroscopic clusters",
    ". however , these contributions are counter balanced by a third term that we consider now .",
    "\\3 ) _ placing hydrophilic head groups on micelle surface_. in the final step , the hydrophilic head groups are reconnected to the hydrophobic tails , placing them at the water  oil interface so as to maintain a favorable solvation energy .",
    "this positioning is to be done while simultaneously enforcing the connectivity between heads and tails and while also maintaining the densely packed interior .",
    "these conditions result in an entropic cost that increases super - extensively with aggregate size .",
    "the form of this third contribution to the driving force is conveniently estimated from the electrostatic analogy of stoichiometric constraints  @xcite .",
    "the result is  @xcite @xmath36 where @xmath37 . in employing this analogy",
    ", it is important to note that the micelle volume is essentially that of the densely packed alkyl chains .",
    "combining the three contributions discussed above gives the driving force in units of @xmath38 : @xmath39 minimization of @xmath15 therefore gives @xmath40 with this aggregation number , eqs [ eq : cmcgeneral ] and [ eq : deltag ] yield @xmath41 where @xmath42 .",
    "equation [ eq : result ] is the principal result of this paper .",
    "it expresses the critical micelle concentration in terms of measured quantities and one adjustable parameter , the molecular length scale @xmath9 . as such ,",
    "its validity is easily checked . here",
    "we do so by considering @xmath43-alkyl hexaoxyethylene glycol monoethers , c@xmath44e@xmath45 , i.e. , ( @xmath46 . the critical micelle concentrations for this class of nonionic surfactants have been determined experimentally .",
    "the surface tension is required to compare eq [ eq : result ] with experimental results . at room temperature , the oil ",
    "water surface tension is @xmath47  @xcite .",
    "were we to neglect @xmath48 we would instead take the room temperature value of the water  vapor surface tension , @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "the difference @xmath26 is mainly enthalpic  @xcite .",
    "as such , a good approximation for the temperature dependence of the required surface tension is @xmath50   @xcite .    the transfer free energy , @xmath27 , is also needed . to the extent that the micelle interior is like a bulk hydrocarbon liquid , it can be obtained from solubility measurements @xcite .",
    "this free energy change for transferring alkane chains with fewer than 12 carbons from oil to water depends linearly on the number of carbons , @xmath43 .",
    "the linear fit to experimental data is @xmath51 at room temperature .",
    "we have used the subscript `` 0 '' to indicate that this free energy for transferring between bulk phases must differ to some extent from that for transferring from a micelle interior to water .",
    "indeed , experimental evidence for alkane chains with @xmath52 @xcite indicates that @xmath53 .",

    "when plotted on a logarithmic scale , it should have the slope @xmath62 .",
    "figure [ fig : mdependence ] compares this prediction with experimental data .",
    "the measured data is indeed linear over a range of concentrations spanning several orders of magnitude .",
    "the slope of the experimental data is approximately -0.7 kcal / mol , which is close to the value of -0.9 kcal / mol inferred by neglecting @xmath63 , and even closer to the value of -0.77 kcal / mol inferred by accounting for this correction to transfer free energies between entirely bulk phases .",
    "figure [ fig : tdependence ] concerns the temperature dependence of the critical micelle concentration . the experimental data for @xmath64 show a minimum in the critical micelle concentration near 50 celsius .",
    "a similar minimum is found from eq [ eq : result ] .",
    "the excellent fit to experimental data is obtained by choosing @xmath9 so as to match the experimental data at @xmath65 .",
    "this method of choice gives @xmath66 , which is not an unreasonable value for the microscopic length .",
    "neglecting the corrections @xmath67 and @xmath68 lead to similar lengths , and similar though inferior fits to the data over the observed temperature range .    since @xmath69 is of order 1 , and @xmath70 is of order 10 , we see that this expression predicts aggregation numbers of order 100 .",
    "this cluster size is consistent with our assumption of large @xmath2 .",

    "it is remarkable how well @xmath1 is described over a wide range of conditions with only these three terms . for ionic surfactants ,",
