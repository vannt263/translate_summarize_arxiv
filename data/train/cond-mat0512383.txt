    "<S> the acoustic sound dispersion of nitrogen in its liquid and supercritical phases has been studied by inelastic x - ray scattering . </S>",

    "<S> evidence for a crossover between adiabatic and isothermal sound propagation regimes is inferred by an analysis of the dynamic structure factor based on generalized hydrodynamics .    </S>",
    "<S> the development of inelastic x - ray scattering ( @xmath0 ) @xcite has opened up new opportunities in the study of the high - frequency dynamics of liquids at nanometer distances and picosecond timescales . </S>",
    "<S> various @xmath1 investigations unveiled that , in the proper thermodynamical conditions , @xmath2 relaxation processes occur in the thz frequency range . </S>",
    "<S> these processes manifest themselves by an upward bending of the sound dispersion relation , which deviate from the low - frequency linear behavior dictated by the adiabatic sound velocity . </S>",
    "<S> accordingly , the sound velocity increases from the adiabatic value , @xmath3 , to the `` infinite '' frequency value , @xmath4 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath5 is the frequency of the probed acoustic excitation with wave vector @xmath6 , and @xmath7 is the characteristic relaxation time of the structural relaxation process , the system exhibits a liquid - like ( @xmath8 ) behavior if the condition @xmath9 is fulfilled : in this limit the dispersion relation is @xmath10 . in the opposite limit , the @xmath11 one , where @xmath12 , structural rearrangements are too slow to efficiently dissipate the energy of the acoustic waves : in this limit @xmath13 . a schematic picture of this @xmath14 variation of the sound velocity form @xmath15 is shown in fig . </S>",

    "<S> ; middle panel : isothermal transition taking place at @xmath18 ; bottom panel : realistic non linear dispersions under favorable experimental conditions for @xmath19 and @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> vertical arrows indicate the crossover regions as discussed in the text . </S>",
    "<S> the isothermal ( dotted line ) , adiabatic ( solid line ) , infinite frequency ( dashed line ) and apparent ( thick solid line ) sound dispersions are reported together with the relaxation frequency @xmath21 ( dashed - dotted line ) and thermal frequency @xmath22 ( dashed - double dotted line)._,width=264 ]    the structural relaxation process , in principle , is not the only relaxation process that could affect the high frequency dynamics of a liquid . on general grounds , also other physical processes , as for example thermal diffusion , can modify the behavior of sound waves . in this case , </S>",
    "<S> given a thermal diffusion coefficient @xmath23 and a thermal relaxation time @xmath24 , a modification of the sound velocity takes place around a cross - over frequency given by @xmath25 . in this case , for @xmath26 the thermal diffusion is much slower than the period of acoustic waves , which therefore propagate adiabatically , i.e. without any thermal exchange with the local environment . in the opposite limit , @xmath27 , the thermalization of the acoustic wave is instantaneous , and the effective propagation mechanism becomes isothermal with sound velocity @xmath28 ( @xmath29 is the specific heat ratio ) . </S>",
    "<S> one therefore expects to observe a transition between the adiabatic and the isothermal regimes when @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> this case is schematically presented in figure 1b , where linear lines represent the adiabatic ( full line ) and isothermal ( dotted line ) sound dispersion , and the dash - dot - dot line indicates the @xmath6 dependence of @xmath31 .    </S>",
    "<S> contrary to the visco - elastic transition , which has been experimentally documented in many liquids @xcite , no firm evidence of the adiabatic to isothermal transition is available . </S>",
    "<S> this is mainly due to the following reasons : i ) the amplitude of the dispersive effect between @xmath32 and @xmath33 is proportional to @xmath34 which , in most liquids , is close to zero . </S>",
    "<S> ii ) the effect is often completely masked by the competing visco - elastic transition . </S>",
    "<S> iii ) the crossover occurs typically at large @xmath6 , often above the position of the first sharp diffraction peak ( fsdp ) of the static structure factor , @xmath35 . here </S>",
    "<S> , however , the finite-@xmath6 generalization of the isothermal sound speed @xmath36 - which is proportional to @xmath37 - @xcite , becomes too small to be reliably extracted from the measured @xmath38 spectra .    </S>",
    "<S> these obstacles to the observation of the adiabatic to isothermal sound propagation transition can be reduced close to supercritical conditions for the following reasons : i ) the competing positive dispersion induced by the viscoelastic transition is expected to be much weaker . </S>",
    "<S> ii ) the crossover condition for the viscoelastic transition is expected to move at higher @xmath6 , i.e. higher frequency , since the structural rearrangements occur on shorter time scales . </S>",
    "<S> iii ) moreover , the intensity of the fsdp is much weaker , and consequently @xmath39 does not display any longer a pronounced minimum in the vicinity of the fsdp . </S>",
    "<S> iv ) finally , the sound speed decreases on approaching the critical point , and therefore the transition will move towards smaller @xmath6 values . </S>",
    "<S> this scenario is schematically pictured in figure 1c , where the combined effects of the structural and thermal relaxation processes are model within the framework of the molecular hydrodynamics @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the values of @xmath7 and @xmath40 are chosen such that the transition is actually determined by the thermal relaxation process , as indicated by the arrow .    </S>",
    "<S> this letter , guided by the above considerations , reports an ixs study of liquid and supercritical nitrogen . </S>",
    "<S> nitrogen has been chosen because the two thermodynamic regimes ( liquid and supercritical ) can be easily obtained within an experimentally accessible pressure and temperature range , and because of its favorable inelastic scattering cross section . </S>",

    "<S> the sample was embedded in a large volume , high pressure cell kept in thermal contact with the cold finger of a cryostat . </S>",

    "<S> the comparisons between the apparent dispersion relation , @xmath72 @xmath76 @xmath6 ( open circles ) , and both isothermal ( dotted line ) and adiabatic ( full line ) ones , are shown in fig . 4 at the four different temperatures 87 , 128 , 171 , and 191 k. in the same figure we also report the infinite frequency dispersion relation ( full dots ) and the inverse of the structural relaxation time @xmath77 ( dashed - dot line ) as derived from the best fit result . </S>",
    "<S> the inverse of the thermal relaxation time , @xmath22 , is also reported as derived from the nitrogen eos ( dash - dot - dot line ) . </S>",
    "<S> the results of fig.4a , corresponding to the lowest investigated temperature ( 87 k ) , show that the apparent dispersion is systematically higher than the adiabatic one . </S>",
    "<S> although the @xmath4-limit is not completely reached , in this thermodynamic point the high frequency dynamics of the liquid is mostly influenced by the structural relaxation process . </S>",
    "<S> this influence is considerably weaker at @xmath78 k ( panel b ) due to the higher value of @xmath77 which prevents even - more to reach the viscoelastic crossover conditions . on further increase of the temperature </S>",
    "<S> ( panel c and d ) , @xmath77 moves definitely out of the probed frequency range and any hint of positive dispersion on the sound velocity disappears . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , with increasing temperature the apparent dispersion relation initially approaches the adiabatic sound dispersion , but at the highest temperature is observed to go below the adiabatic dispersion and to approach the isothermal one : this is the onset of the expected transition between adiabatic and isothermal regimes . </S>",
    "<S> this effect is most clearly seen for the three highest @xmath6 points between @xmath79 and @xmath80 @xmath75 .     </S>",
    "<S> measurements , as discussed in the text ; the open circles indicate the maxima of longitudinal current spectra . </S>",
    "<S> the dash - dotted and dash - double dotted lines represent @xmath81 and @xmath82 , respectively ; the former has been evaluated interpolating the results of the performed lineshape analysis , which allowed also to extract the values of infinite - frequency sound dispersion , reported as full circles._,width=283 ]    the arrows in figure 4 ( panels c and d ) indicate the @xmath6 points where one would expect the adiabatic - isothermal transition ( @xmath83 , left arrows ) and where the transition actually occurs ( right arrows ) : a @xmath6 value definitively higher than the one estimated by the left arrow . </S>",
    "<S> this difference between expected and observed transition @xmath6 points is an indication of the @xmath6-dependence of the parameter @xmath23 , which we neglected so far . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior is in agreement with the expectations suggested by numerical simulations of various molecular liquids @xcite pointing to a monotonic decrease of @xmath84 with increasing @xmath6 . as a consequence </S>",
    "<S> , the position of the crossover is shifted towards higher momentum transfers . </S>",
    "<S> even though the transition to the isothermal regime is not fully completed , its occurrence is inferred from this systematic trend . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , it is worthwhile recalling that the present results have been obtained without imposing any constraint on the line shape fitting parameters . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the values of the isothermal sound dispersions have been determined independently through the measured @xmath35 .    in conclusion our observations </S>",
    "<S> can be summarized as follows : i ) the apparent sound branch of nitrogen show clear signatures of a positive sound dispersion in the liquid phase , thus witnessing the presence of a structural relaxation process . </S>",
    "<S> ii ) the positive sound dispersion gradually disappears while reaching supercritical conditions , most likely due to the shift of @xmath77 above the @xmath72 values . </S>",
    "<S> iii ) at the highest investigated temperatures , the transition from the adiabatic to the isothermal sound propagation is observed .    </S>",
    "<S> these findings indicate that , in the liquid phase , the high frequency dynamic of a simple , non - associated fluid , such as nitrogen , is mainly ruled by the structural relaxation , as manifested by the positive sound dispersion . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , in the supercritical phase , the role of the structural relaxation becomes negligible and the most evident dispersive effect is the bending down of the apparent dispersion , from its adiabatic value to the isothermal one . in this regime </S>",
    "<S> , the thermal relaxation process rules the high frequency dynamics . </S>"
