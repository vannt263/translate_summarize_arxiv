    "one of the most important problems in quantum field theory is the study of the bound state spectra of non - abelian gauge theories .",
    "there are several approaches to this problem .",
    "for qcd like theories lattice gauge theory is probably the most popular approach since the approximation does not break the most important symmetry , gauge symmetry .",
    "similarly for supersymmetric theories , supersymmetric dlcq ( sdlcq)is probably the most powerful approach since the approximation does not break the most important symmetry , supersymmetry . in this paper will consider supersymmetric theories and follow this latter approach .",
    "long ago t hooft @xcite showed that two dimensional models can be a powerful laboratory for studying the bound state problem .",
    "these models remain popular to this day since they are easy to solve and share many properties with their four dimensional cousins , most notably stable bound states .",
    "supersymmetric two dimensional models are particularly attractive since they are also super - renormalizable .",
    "given that the dynamics of gauge field is responsible for strong interaction and the formation of bound states , it comes as no surprise that a great deal of effort has gone into investing bound states of pure glue in supersymmetric models @xcite . while such theories capture the essential properties of the mass spectrum and some of them are relevant for the string theory @xcite , the wavefunctions are quite different from the ones for mesons and baryons .",
    "extensive study of the meson spectrum of non  supersymmetric theories has been done ( see @xcite for a review ) , but the problem has not been addressed in a context of supersymmetric models . in this paper",
    "we will introduce seven new two dimensional supersymmetric models that have not been previously studied that are particularly useful for studying mesons within a two dimensional supersymmetric laboratory . throughout this paper",
    "we use a word `` meson '' to indicate the group structure of the state .",
    "namely we define a meson as a bound state whose wavefunction can be written as a linear combination of parton chains , each chain starts and ending with a creation operator in fundamental representation . in supersymmetric theories the states , defined this way ,",
    "can have either bosonic or fermionic statistics .    to simplify the calculation",
    "we will consider only the large @xmath1 limit @xcite , which has proven to be a powerful approximation for bound state calculations . while baryons can be constructed in this limit @xcite , they have an infinite number of partons and thus practical calculations for such states",
    "are complicated . in this paper",
    "we concentrate our attention on the mesonic spectrum .",
    "note that throughout this paper we completely ignore the zero mode problem @xcite , however it is clear that considerable progress on this issue could be made following our earlier work on the zero modes of the two dimensional supersymmetric model with only adjoint fields @xcite .",
    "the paper has the following organization . in section [ sectdefin ]",
    "we consider the three dimensional sqcd and dimensionally reduce it to @xmath0 .",
    "we perform the light - cone quantization of the resulting theory by applying canonical commutation relations at fixed @xmath2 and choosing the light - cone gauge ( @xmath3 ) for the vector field . after solving the constraint equations we end up with a model containing @xmath4 dynamical fields .",
    "we construct the supercharge for the dimensionally reduced theory and observe that it can also be used to define models with less supersymmetry .",
    "in particular , in section [ secstat ] we study the mesonic spectrum of systems without dynamical quarks .",
    "we find that one of these systems ( we call it @xmath5 ) has many light states in sdlcq , which probably give rise to a continuous spectrum in the continuum limit .",
    "the other system , containing only dynamical gluinos , seems not to have a well - defined bound state problem : all masses are pushed to infinity in the continuum limit . in section [ secnogauge ]",
    "we study the systems which do not include the adjoint scalar .",
    "they all share the same properties : a well - defined continuum spectrum and the existing of a critical value of the coupling constant at which the lowest mass bound state becomes massless .",
    "finally , in section [ secgauge ] we study the remaining theories which include the adjoint boson and at least one of the fundamental fields .",
    "we find that all this models have a continuous spectrum , which seems to be a general property of two dimensional supersymmetric systems with adjoint scalars @xcite .",
    "we consider the family of supersymmetric models in two dimensions which can be obtained as the result of dimensional reduction of sqcd@xmath6 and possible truncation of some fields in the resulting two dimensional theory .",
    "our starting point is the three dimensional action : [ action ] s&=&d^3x(-f_f^+ ^d_+d_^d^+ i| d_^- . + &",
    "this action describes the system of a gauge field @xmath7 and its superpartner @xmath8 , both taking values in the adjoint representation of @xmath9 , and two complex fields , a scalar @xmath10 and a dirac fermion @xmath11 , transforming according to the fundamental representation of the same group .",
    "thus in matrix notation the covariant derivatives are given by : d_=_+ig[a_,],d_=_+iga_,d_=_+iga_. the action ( [ action ] ) is invariant under supersymmetry transformations which are parameterized by a two  component majorana fermion @xmath12 : a_=_,=f_^ , + = , = -^d_. we introduced the commutator of the dirac matrices : @xmath13.\\ ] ] using standard techniques one can evaluate the noether current corresponding to these transformations : [ sucurrent ] |q^&=&^ ^(f_)+ d^^+^^ d _ + & -&d^+d_^. we will consider the reduction of this system to two dimensions , which means that the field configurations are assumed to be independent of the space  like dimension @xmath14 . in the resulting two dimensional system we will implement light ",
    "cone quantization , which means that initial conditions as well as canonical commutation relations will be imposed on a light ",
    "like surface @xmath15 .",
    "in particular we construct the supercharge by integrating the current ( [ sucurrent ] ) over the light ",
    "like surface : [ sucharge ] |q&=&dx^-dx^2 ( ^ ^+(f_)+ d_-^+^^+ d_. + & -&.d^++d_^+ ) .",
    "since all fields are assumed to be independent of @xmath14 , the integration over this coordinate gives just a constant factor , which we absorb by a field redefinition .",
    "if we consider a specific representation for the dirac matrices in three dimensions : ^0=_2,^1=i_1,^2=i_3 , then the majorana fermion @xmath8 can be chosen to be real , it is also convenient to write the fermions in the component form : = ( , ) ^t,=(,)^t , q=(q^+,q^-)^t in terms of this decomposition the superalgebra has explicit @xmath16 form : [ sualg ] \\{q^+,q^+}=2p^+,\\{q^-,q^-}=2p^-,\\{q^+,q^-}=0 .",
    "the traditional way of solving the bound state problem @xcite is based on a simultaneous diagonalization of the momentum @xmath17 and the hamiltonian @xmath18 , but as one can see from the structure of ( [ sualg ] ) , the same problem can be solved by diagonalizing @xmath17 and @xmath19 instead @xcite .    in order to solve the bound state problem we impose the light cone gauge ( @xmath3 ) , then the supercharges are given by : [ qplus ] q^+&=&2dx^-(_-a^2 + _",
    "-^-^_-- ^_-+_-^ ) + q^-&=&-2dx^-(-_-a^-+ i^d_2-id_2^+ _ -(^-^ ) ) .",
    "+ note that apart from a total derivative these expressions involve only left  moving components of fermions ( @xmath20 and @xmath21 ) .",
    "in fact in the light  cone formulation only these components are dynamical . to see this we consider the equations of motion that follow from the action ( [ action ] ) , in the light cone gauge .",
    "three of them serve as constraints rather than as dynamical statements : [ constraint ] ^2_-a^-=gj , j = i[a^2,_-a^2]+ \\{,}-ih_-^+ ih_-^+h^ , & & _ -=- ( [ a^2,]+ih^-ih^ ) , + & & _ -=-a^2 + .",
    "we introduced the relative coupling for the fundamental matter : @xmath22 .",
    "apart from the zero mode problem @xcite , one can invert the first constraint to write the auxiliary field @xmath23 in terms of physical degrees of freedom . substituting the result into the expression for the supercharge and omitting the boundary term",
    ", we get : [ qminus ] q^-=-2dx^-(gj+ g^a^2+g^a^2 ) .",
    "this supercharge gives rise to a whole family of supersymmetric theories .",
    "namely one can see that the expression ( [ qminus ] ) is meaningful even if we exclude some of the fields from the theory .",
    "as soon as we have at least one fermion and at least one field in the adjoint representation , ( [ qminus ] ) defines an interacting theory with supersymmetry .",
    "some of these theories were studied before ( namely the pure adjoint systems with @xcite or without @xcite bosons ) , but many of them are new . in this paper",
    "we will study the mesonic spectrum of all these models , their field content is summarized in the table [ contenttable ] .",
    ".interacting supersymmetric models with fundamental matter.the numbers refer to the section in the paper where appropriate model is studied , and symbol  appears when the models which do not exist . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in this work we studied the mesonic mass spectrum of various supersymmetric models .",
    "the calculations were performed in the framework of supersymmetric dlcq , namely we compactified the light ",
    "like coordinate @xmath24 on a finite circle and performed a numerical diagonalization of supercharge @xmath19 .",
    "we found that the systems with adjoint scalars tend to give a continuous spectrum in the decompactification limit .",
    "for one of these systems ( @xmath25 model ) we found a limiting form of the distribution function for the mass .",
    "by contrast , the models without adjoint bosons have well defined spectra of bound states in the continuum limit .",
    "the only exception from this rule is the system containing only the gaugino field , which seems not to have any finite mass mesons in the decompactification limit . for the well defined systems we found the masses of the lightest mesons and demonstrated the fast convergence of sdlcq approximation .",
    "we also looked at the mass spectrum at different values of coupling constant .",
    "the nontrivial phase diagram is an essential property which distinguish the models we considered here from the two dimensional systems studied previously @xcite .",
    "the coupling constant of a pure gauge theory in two dimensions has a dimension of mass , thus all the bound state masses scale like @xmath26 , leaving no space for nontrivial coupling constant dependence .",
    "one can avoid this problem by introducing the masses for a gauge field or its superpartner , but such terms usually lead to breaking of either a gauge invariance or supersymmetry is supersymmetric only at nonzero value of a particle mass @xmath27 , but this still does not leave a space for an adjustable mass parameter . ] .",
    "another way of introducing a free parameter in the theory is to add a new supermultiplet with a different charge @xmath28 . of course",
    ", this parameter is not completely free : the quantization of charge requires the value @xmath29 to be a rational number , but formally we can study the bound states as functions of @xmath22 .",
    "we found an interesting property of the lowest nonzero mass : it vanishes at a particular negative value of @xmath30 .",
    "the nature of this property is still unclear .",
    "one can also introduce the true free parameter by considering the massive matter supermultiplet ( now there is no obstacle coming from gauge invariance ) and we leave this possibility for a future investigation .",
