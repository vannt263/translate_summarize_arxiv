    "[ fig : vrescale ] is that also the scaling properties of the image potential depend significantly on @xmath53 . as we will discuss in the next section ,",
    "the scaling is crucial for the capability of nanorings to support detached tis . to analyze this property we compare the nanoring potential to a power - law with exponent @xmath57 which is typical for many image potentials , e.g. at flat surfaces ( @xmath58 ) or at grounded metallic spheres ( @xmath59 ) .    for simplicity",

    "correspond hence to a regime where the image potential experienced by the electron is nearly circularly symmetric .",
    "this situation is comparable to the case of two parallel ( infinitely extended ) nanotubes sharing an electronic image state which has been analyzed in @xcite . for sufficiently large tube separations",
    "all image states are gerade or ungerade superpositions of single - tube states and can be labeled by a good angular momentum quantum number",
    ". the situation changes , however , for smaller tube separations where an increasing asymmetric distortion leads to a collapse of the electronic states onto the tubes .",

    "the effective radial potential @xmath112 @xmath113 includes an additional centrifugal barrier associated to the angular momentum @xmath2 .",
    "it can be viewed as an approximation for the potential energy associated to the degree of freedom describing radial motion with respect to the tube center .",

    "[ fig : veff ] the radial potential from ( [ eqn : veff_rad ] ) is depicted for the exemplary nanoring ( @xmath43 , @xmath115 ) for an angular momentum @xmath95 and effective angular momenta @xmath2 ranging from 5 to 12 .    in the figure",
    "all curves with @xmath116 possess potential wells that are separated by centrifugal barriers from the nanoring surface . as expected from the ring geometry these wells",
    "are non - symmetric with respect to reflections at the axis @xmath117 .",
    "further asymmetry stems from the centrifugal potential associated to @xmath76 which leads to the divergent behavior for @xmath93 .",

    "similar agreement can be found for the other states in fig .",

    "furthermore , the radial potential predicts that tis with @xmath122 and @xmath123 are either not bound to the ring or are not detached from its surface which agrees with our numerical results .    in a regime where the circular and the radial motion are approximately separable",
    ", the effective potential @xmath113 is consequently a useful tool to identify angular momenta @xmath102 leading to detached tis and to specify their properties . in the following",
    "we will employ @xmath113 to estimate general criteria for the existence of detached tis at nanorings in a regime where the impact of @xmath76 is small . a general framework to study the conditions for which infinite metal cylinders support",
    "detached tis has been provided in @xcite . in particular",
    "it has been shown that an infinite cylinder of radius @xmath7 possesses only detached effective potential wells if the dimensionless parameter @xmath124 lies close to @xmath125 , where @xmath126 denotes the bohr radius .",
    "this is a useful criterion to estimate properties for cylinders having different geometries .    by performing a similar scaling analysis for the potential ( [ eqn : v_eff ] ) one can derive analogous criteria for the nanoring .",
    "for the exemplary nanoring one finds e.g. that potential wells exists for @xmath127 and one can conclude that this is also true for all other nanorings having the same ratio @xmath128 .",
    "we computed critical @xmath129 also for nanorings with other ratios @xmath130 and found @xmath129 lying always between 0.7 and 1.1 .    for larger",
    "@xmath53 , however , the potential wells become so broad , that their identification becomes increasingly difficult .",
    "this behavior can be understood by means of the local power - law scaling of the nanoring image potential that depends on the ratio @xmath53 , see sec .",
    "[ sec : image_pot_analysis ] .",
    "a basic calculation shows that an effective potential of the form @xmath131 , where @xmath132 , @xmath133 and @xmath57 are constants , possesses minimal extremal values only for @xmath134 .",
    "this is for example the reason why there exist no high angular momentum image states around spherical graphite particles @xcite .",
    "this criterion can also be applied locally and we conclude from fig . [",
    "fig : exponent ] for the nanoring that potential wells supporting detached tis exist only if @xmath135 , i.e. for sufficiently thin tori .",
    "in the present work we constructed an analytical expression for the electrostatic image potential between a point charge and a neutral metallic ring .",
    "we analyzed this potential and demonstrated that it supports image states `` circulating '' the torus which can be viewed as a curvilinear generalization of tubular image states around nanocylinders @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the latter the angular momentum @xmath2 shielding the states from the torus surface is not conserved and the states are not circularly symmetric . the second angular momentum @xmath76 ( associated to the motion along the nanoring ) is conserved and can be used to tune the energy and also to some extent the shape of the image states .",
    "too high @xmath76 will , however , couple the different @xmath2 states too strongly and destabilize the system . the main features of tis can be explained by means of an effective radial potential including a centrifugal barrier associated to @xmath2 . by analyzing the scaling properties of this potential we argued that centrifugally detached high angular momentum image states exist only around sufficiently thin nanorings having aspect ratios smaller than @xmath136 .",
    "however , it has to be expected that nanorings ( like nanotubes ) also support low angular momentum tis states probing the surface , whose investigation might be an interesting subject for future studies .    in the last decades",
    "there has been a tremendous progress in the development of nanofabrication techniques @xcite and the production of almost perfectly ring - shaped silver nanowires with dimensions @xmath137 and @xmath138 is already possible @xcite .",
    "compared to experimentally realized tis around straight cylindrical structures the additional curvature of nanorings could offer interesting new applications .",
    "for example the repulsive mutual coulomb interaction of two or more simultaneously excited electrons at a nanoring could lead to special equilibrium configurations where each electron resides at a particular angle along the ring .",
    "the here presented results are a first exploration of tis at curved nanowires and should be of relevance for all future studies and applications of image states at even more complex - shaped nanostructures .",
