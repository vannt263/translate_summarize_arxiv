    "spin - based - electronics ( spintronics ) is now an emerging field .",
    "an essential notion behind this emergence is the fact that the ` spin magnetic current ' without relying on electric current would magnificently reduce the energy loss and switching time during the information read / write processes . at the heart of spintronics",
    "is to drive motion of magnetic textures in a controllable manner .",
    "there are two ways to drive the motion , i.e. , incoherent and coherent methods.@xcite the incoherent method is typically realized by injecting a spin - polarized current into a sample.zutic04 on the other hand , the coherent method is realized in a magnetically ordered state by twisting the phase angle of the magnetic order parameter which directly couples to a magnetic field . in the coherent method ,",
    "the phase rigidity ( stiffness ) of the whole spin system makes it possible to transmit the spin rotation at one end of a sample to the other end via spin torque transfer .",
    "although the coherent method has potential advantage , it has not been extensively studied in the context of the present - day spintronics , because it is not so easy to prepare rigid phase object which transports experimentally measured quantity in a controllable manner . to seek for the possibility of",
    "the coherent method is interesting .    in this paper",
    "we propose that chiral helimagnets are promising candidates to realize the coherent method .",
    "the chiral helimagnetic ( chm ) state is characterized by the vector spin chirality as an order parameter .",
    "the structure is stabilized by the antisymmetric dzyaloshinskii - moriya ( dm ) interaction and realized in crystals without rotoinversion symmetry .",
    "a guiding principle for materializing this effect is symmetry - adapted material synthesis , i.e. , the interplay of crystallographic and magnetic chirality plays a key role there .",
    "the chm state is , however , nothing more than non - colinear linear ( harmonic ) spin structure . to carry physically measurable quantity ,",
    "we need nonlinear structure . fortunately ,",
    "under the magnetic field applied perpendicular to the helical axis , the chm is transformed to a non - linear magnetic structure called a chiral soliton lattice ( csl ) [ see fig .  [ csl ] ] which is equivalent to a magnetic kink crystal ( mkc).@xcite in the csl state , the ground state possesses a periodic array of the commensurate ( c ) and incommensurate ( ic ) domains partitioned by discommensurations .",
    "recently , using lorenz microscopy and small - angle electron diffraction , the csl was experimentally verified in a hexagonal chiral magnet cr@xmath0nbs@xmath1.@xcite present authors have discussed physical outcome of the csl state from various viewpoints . bko2008,ko2009,kop2010,kop2011     and time - dependent longitudinal field @xmath2.,width=283 ]    as pointed out in refs.@xcite , the csl exhibits coherent collective sliding motion in non - equilibrium state .",
    "once the sliding is triggered , the csl maintains its persistent motion assisted by the dynamical generation of the inertial mass .",
    "the mass generation is understood by dring - becker - kittel mechanism of the moving domain wall.doring48,becker50,kittel50 in this mechanism , the longitudinal ( out - of - plane ) component of the slanted magnetic moment inside the domain wall emerges as a consequence of translational motion .",
    "an additional magnetic energy associated with the resultant demagnetization field is interpreted as the kinetic energy of the wall .    the incoherent current injection method to drive the sliding",
    "was already proposed by the present authors.@xcite in this paper , we demonstrate that crossed magnetic fields are eligible to cause the coherent motion of the whole csl . here , we mean by the crossed fields that in addition to a static field perpendicular to the helical axis , which stabilizes the cslformation , a magnetic field parallel to the helical axis is imposed .    once the coherent motion occurs , the natural question arises as to whether the motion has observable consequences for the spin motive force ( smf).barnes2007 quite naturally to expect that the time dependence of the longitudinal magnetic field manifests itself in a temporal regime of the smf .",
    "time dependences of the spinmotive forces are classified into three types , i.e. , ( i ) transient , ( ii ) continous ac , ( iii ) and continous dc ones .",
    "for example , the domain wall motion@xcite and electron transport through ferromagnetic nanoparticles@xcite lead to the type ( i ) smf .",
    "a vortex core dynamics of a magnetic disk caused by an oscillating magnetic field directed in the disk plane induces a continous ac spinmotive force of type ( ii).@xcite a resonant microwave excitation of a comb - shaped ferromagnetic thin film produces a continous dc spinmotive force of type ( iii).@xcite we will demonstrate that the time - dependent longitudinal field , as shown in fig .",
    "[ csl ] , possibly causes the smf of type ( i ) and ( ii ) in the chiral helimagnet . as a remarkable feature",
    ", we note that our csl is a macroscopically ordered object , which contains macroscopic amounts of magnetic solitons . due to this huge number of solitons ,",
    "the smf is expected to be strongly amplified as compared with the smf caused by a single magnetic domain wall in a ferromagnet .    in sec .",

    "@xmath2381 mm , the upper bound of @xmath226  along the helical axis amounts to @xmath239 .",
    "therefore , we expect that @xmath240 amounts to @xmath241[mv ] for @xmath242oe as an example . to experimentally sustain the smf , it may be desirable to apply a sequence of the pulse fields .    here",
    "we comment on the physical reason why the smf is proportional to the gilbert damping factor @xmath206 in eq .",
    "( [ smfamp ] ) .",
    "an essential point is that emergence of the smf  is a direct consequence of time - varying berry cap,@xcite which needs finite @xmath243 .",
    "now , as is clearly seen from basic eoms , ( [ ceom1 ] ) and ( [ ceom2 ] ) , if the gilbert damping were absent , @xmath243 and @xmath84 are dynamically decoupled and consequently @xmath244 for all the time , i.e. , the sliding motion can never be sustained .",
    "this situation is totally different from the case of 180-degree bloch wall .",
    "the csl  is regarded as an array of 360-degree walls and we need some mechanism which enables the magnetic moments to rotate around the chiral axis .",
    "only one possible mechanism to realize this rotation is the gilbert damping process .",
    "this is the reason why the smf is proportional to @xmath245 .",
    "more intuitively speaking , at the first stage the longitudinal field @xmath127 directly couples to @xmath243 and causes the out - of - plane canting of the magnetic moments [ see the lagrangian ( [ collective lagrangian ] ) ] . at the second stage , because of the gilbert damping , the magnetic moments start damped precession to relax back into their original directions .",
    "this motion triggers the moments to rotate around the chiral axis and eventually leads to the collective sliding .",
    "in this paper , we demonstrated that the chiral soliton lattice ( csl ) exhibits coherent sliding motion simply applying a _ time - dependent _ magnetic longitudinal field , in addition to a _",
    "static _ transverse field .",
    "the driving force of the sliding is given by the zeeman coupling of the collective coordinate @xmath243 with the longitudinal field .",
    "this mechanism is intuitively understood by dbk mechanism of the moving domain wall ( dw).@xcite in the dbk mechanism , once the domain wall begins to move , so - called demagnetization field is dynamically generated inside the wall .",
    "the demagnetization field supplies spin torque to keep the inertial motion .",
    "actually , the dbk mechanism of a single dw was analyzed by exactly the same procedure presented in this paper.@xcite in the csl dynamics , the longitudinal magnetic field kicks off the demagnetization and drives coherent sliding motion . to demonstrate the coherent sliding motion , we first used the collective coordinate method , and then confirmed the result by computational analysis .",
    "the time duration of the sliding motion is characterized by the intrinsic relaxation time determined by eq .",
    "( [ taugap ] ) . providing",
    "the gap energy @xmath246 varies between @xmath247k and the gilbert damping constant varies between @xmath248 , we expect the time duration varies between @xmath249 sec . to realize longer - lasting sliding motion",
    ", a smaller value of @xmath46 and a smaller gap frequency @xmath250 may be desirable .",
    "this estimation may give a guiding principle for materials synthesis .",
    "sequential pluses of the longitudinal magnetic fields may remedy a quick decay of the sliding .",
    "the sliding motion may be signaled by the spin - density accumulation inside each soliton ( kink ) and emergence of periodic arrays of the induced magnetic dipoles carrying the transport spin current.@xcite from theoretical viewpoints , the coherent sliding is always possible to occur as a direct consequence of the phase rigidity and galilean symmetry in any type of density waves , including spin / charge density waves and even inhomogeneous superconducting states .",
    "however , in many types of such systems , the sliding motion does not transport experimentally measured quantity.@xcite in this respect , it is remarkable that the coherent sliding of the csl accompanies the dynamically generated magnetization .    another observable consequence of the sliding is appearance of the smf along the helical axis .",
    "we showed that the time - dependent sliding velocity @xmath251 causes time - varying berry cap which causes the smf .",
    "we stressed that the dissipative dynamics plays an essential role to drive smf . a salient feature of the csl is appearance of the strongly amplified smf which is directly proportional to the macroscopic number of soliton .",
    "consequently , the smf is expected to reach the order of mv . as reported in ref.togawa2012 , chm and csl",
    "are quite robust against structural dislocation and crystal defects .",
    "its high stability and robustness are direct manifestation of the macroscopic order of spin magnetic moments in chm and csl state .",
