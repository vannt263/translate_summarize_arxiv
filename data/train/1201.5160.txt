    "the large area telescope ( lat , * ? ? ? * ) of the _ fermi gamma - ray space telescope _ is a pulsar detector _",
    "par excellence_. supported by a radio campaign @xcite providing ephemerides for coherent folding of lat photons , the lat has identified @xmath1-ray pulsations from many normal ( unrecycled ) pulsars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and millisecond pulsars ( msps , * ? ? ?",
    "additionally , tens of new pulsars have been discovered in `` blind '' searches for periodicity in the lat data ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a third , indirect method of detection has been extremely successful in discovering new pulsars , especially msps .",
    "gamma - ray pulsars  both young and recycled  are stable emitters and nearly all have a characteristic spectrum @xmath3 with @xmath4 and @xmath5 @xcite , making unidentified , nonvariable lat sources with such spectra good pulsar candidates .",
    "the fine angular resolution and large effective area of the lat allow a typical source localization of @xmath610 , about the @xmath7 beam size of @xmath8 class radio telescopes .",
    "this happy coincidence enables deep pulsation searches with a single pointing .",
    "discovery of a pulsar and a subsequent timing campaign can `` close the loop '' by providing an ephemeris with which to fold lat photons and resolve @xmath1-ray pulsations . indeed , since most msps reside in binaries , initial detection and characterization of the orbit at longer wavelengths is the _ only _",
    "way @xmath1-ray pulsations can be detected from these pulsars . due to sensitivity limitations , lat - guided surveys naturally target the nearly - isotropic population of nearby msps .",
    "the deep radio exposures afforded by the efficient target selection offer the tantalizing possibility of completely cataloguing the local field msps whose radio and @xmath1-ray beams cross the earth .",
    "this relatively complete sample will be valuable in constraining the emission mechanisms of msps and in characterizing the evolution of their binary progenitors .    towards this end",
    ", we performed a small , targeted survey at the csiro parkes telescope , complementary to a parkes search described in @xcite that had different source selection criteria .",
    "we began with the set of southern ( decl .",
    "@xmath9 ; northern sources are visible to the more sensitive green bank telescope ) , nonvariable sources in a preliminary version of the 1fgl catalog of @xmath1-ray sources @xcite .",
    "we further restricted consideration to sources whose lat position estimates had a 95% confidence error radius @xmath107 , the hwhm of the 1.4ghz beam of the parkes telescope , and which had no plausible blazar counterpart .",
    "we classified the remaining sources by visual inspection of the @xmath1-ray spectrum .",
    "sources with spectral shapes resembling known pulsars ( see above ) were selected for observation , while those sources best described by power laws or with significant spectral breaks but @xmath11 were deemed likely to be blazars and were not selected . due to the difficulty of spectral modeling and localization of lat sources in the galactic plane , we discarded sources with @xmath12 .",
    "our final list comprised 14 good candidates .",
    "the source positions ( see table  1 ) were computed from the same analysis used to estimate the spectral shape , but in all cases the difference in position with 1fgl is well within both the 1fgl 95% error contour and the parkes beam .",
    "we observed the 14 selected sources (  [ sec : targets ] ) at the parkes 64-m radio telescope between 2009 november 25 and december 8 .",
    "each source was observed for between 1 and 2 hours ( see table  1 ) using the center beam of the multibeam receiver .",
    "we recorded 1-bit - digitized total - power samples every 125@xmath13s from each of 512 frequency channels spanning 256mhz of band centered on 1390mhz , writing the data to disk for off - line analysis ( see @xcite for more details on the receiver and data - acquisition system . )    the data were analyzed on the koala computer cluster at columbia university using standard pulsar search techniques implemented in the presto package @xcite .",
    "we dedispersed each data set ideally up to a dispersion measure of @xmath14 , and when searching for periodic signals we allowed for accelerated signals caused by pulsar motion in a binary system .",
    "this was parameterized within presto by the parameter @xmath15 , which is related to the maximum number of bins a signal can drift within the fourier spectrum and still be properly detected by the search method .",
    "all of the data were analyzed in this manner within about a week of collection , and on 2009 december 4 we found our first msp . within a few more days we confirmed it and four other new msps .",
    "a 6th msp was detected unbiasedly in our sample , but it had been previously discovered by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see table  1 ) .    in a few cases , the pulsars",
    "were not confirmed on the first attempt and required subsequent observations , owing to their faintness and scintillation in the interstellar medium .",
    "we reanalyzed the data by increasing the acceleration search space to @xmath16 and by analyzing only the first 30 minutes of each data file .",
    "the latter approach improves our sensitivity to highly accelerated pulsars ( e.g. , for an msp in a 1-day binary , a 2-hour observation can not be corrected ideally under the assumption of a constant acceleration , no matter how large the zmax used ) , but no new pulsars were detected .",
    "the nominal sensitivity of our searches , for a 2hr observation and assuming a pulsar duty cycle of 20% , is 0.11mjy for @xmath172ms and @xmath18pc@xmath19 , degrading gradually for shorter periods and larger dms . while in detail",
    "this depends on the sky background temperature , the contribution from the galaxy at our observing frequency only differs by a maximum of 3k for different locations , out of a total system equivalent temperature of nearly 30k , so that we provide an average flux density limit .",
    "two of the non - detections have limits of 0.12mjy and 0.14mjy owing to shorter integration times ( see table  [ tab : survey ] ) .",
    "because of scintillation , a pulsar with a larger average flux than our nominal limits might not be detectable in a particular observation , and vice versa . in any case",
    ", the nominal flux density represents the most sensitive searches for msps done at parkes , especially considering that these lat - selected targets are largely expected to be relatively nearby .",
    "characterization of four of the msps requires a longer radio timing campaign and/or lat dataset than available for this work .",
    "we defer discussion of these msps ( and of scintillation effects on sensitivity , which likewise requires repeated observations ) to camilo et al .",
    "( in preparation ) .",
    "the remaining pulsar presents a peculiar light curve and we describe it further below .",

    "these data show that the subsidiary pulse component is composed of two outer peaks joined by a low bridge of radio emission .      to characterize the @xmath1-ray profile , we selected photons collected between 2008 aug 4 and 2011 aug 1 with reconstructed energies 0.33gev lying within 1.1   of the timing position . this selection balances completeness ( including as many pulsed photons as possible ) and pulsed signal - to - noise ratio as measured by the h - test @xcite .",
    "we apply the same data processing as described in  [ sec : spect ] , omitting the horizon cut to increase the livetime by about 20% , at the expense of a slightly increased background .",
    "the light curve corresponding to this extraction appears in figure [ fig : prof ] .",
    "if @xmath1 rays are produced above the null charge surface ( the locus of points where the magnetic field is orthogonal to the pulsar spin axis ) , they appear to an observer in the _ opposite _ hemisphere , whereas radio emission from low altitudes is beamed into the same hemisphere . in this scenario , the line - of - sight to would intercept a cone of radio emission in one hemisphere to produce the weaker radio peak at @xmath56 and a cone of radio and @xmath1 emission in the other to produce the two @xmath1 peaks and bright radio peak at @xmath57 . in keeping with this picture and the convention established in the literature , we identify the @xmath1 peak at @xmath58 as `` p1 '' and that at @xmath59 as `` p2 '' .",

    "however , as we discuss below , s light curve is challenging to explain with simple geometric models that tie the radio and @xmath1 emission to particular regions of the magnetosphere .",
    "remarkably , a simple picture of @xmath1-ray emission arising in the outer magnetosphere appears to describe the majority of both young ( though see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) _ and _ recycled pulsars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . on the other hand",
    ", while radio emission in young pulsars and some msps appears to come from lower altitudes , several msps have phase - aligned @xmath1 and radio peaks ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , implying a joint emission site at high altitude .",
    "these observations raise the prospect of msps whose radio emission combines `` traditional '' polar cap emission with a higher - altitude component .",
    "to determine which scenario best describes the emission pattern of , we performed joint fits to the radio and @xmath1-ray data following the method of @xcite .",
    "we modelled the radio as a simple `` cone '' component @xcite and the @xmath1 rays using both the `` two - pole caustic '' ( tpc ) model of and the `` outer gap '' ( og ) model .",
    "the angle between the pulsar spin axis and the line - of - sight , @xmath123 , is unknown _ a priori _ , but if the radio emission arises from low altitudes , then the presence of two peaks separated by roughly half of a rotation indicates the inclination of the magnetic axis from the spin axis ( @xmath124 ) can not be small .",
    "the best - fit light curves for the two @xmath1-ray models appear in figure  [ fig : lcmodel ] .",
    "the low @xmath125 preferred for the tpc model can not produce the radio interpulse and produces too much off - pulse @xmath1-ray emission .",
    "the og model , with a best fit at @xmath126 ( orthogonal rotator ) , produces two radio peaks but fails to produce two clear @xmath1 peaks and the radio interpulse morphology .",
    "since neither model faithfully reproduces the observed light curves , we propose that one or both of the radio peaks may originate at higher altitude .",
    "emission over a range of altitudes would also explain the low observed linear polarization of ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) and admit smaller @xmath124 values .",
    "alternatively , the failure of geometric models may indicate that the physical details of the msp magnetosphere  e.g .",
    ", currents , multipolar fields , and plasma loading of the field lines  and the radio and @xmath1 emission mechanisms play an important role .      with 6/14 pointings resulting in unbiased msp detections ,",
    "this survey was fruitful , though this high efficiency may be luck .",
    "indeed , in our timing campaign , we only detected on 28 of 35 attempts , and several observations required prior knowledge of the ephemeris for detection . thus , because of scintillation , we estimate that is only detectable in 2/3 observations , depending somewhat on integration time .",
    "many field msps are in eclipsing binaries , further diminishing the probability of detection in a single observation .",
    "we believe the strongest factor in our search s success was the source selection criteria .",
    "e.g. , @xcite selected nonvariable lat sources ( but including no spectral shape information ) and found msps in 3/25 pointings .",
    "but when considering only targets with @xmath127 , their efficiency jumps to 3/8 .",
    "@xcite employed some spectral information and detected msps unbiasedly in 1/11 pointings ( 1/4 for @xmath127 ) .",
    "a short list of 7 spectrally - exceptional candidates drawn up for a nanay radio telescope survey included 5 msps , three of which were discovered from nanay observations @xcite . and",
    ", @xcite used nearly identical selection criteria as this work in a green bank telescope survey at 350 mhz and found msps in 13/49 pointings , all but one at @xmath127.the targeting pulsar - like sources is clearly efficient .",
    "however , new lat sources will lie at the sensitivity threshold and the limited statistics will not admit classification of spectral shape and variability . nonetheless , we argue that future radio searches should omit detailed ranking schemes and target _ any _ lat source off the galactic plane that has not been associated with a known blazar .",
    "we believe this substantially increased target list ( and telescope time ) is justified . in the 2fgl source catalog @xcite , there are @xmath6350 unassociated sources more than 5  off the galactic plane .",
    "msps account for roughly 5% of associated lat sources , so 1520 msps may remain to be found in these unassociated 2fgl sources . with only 350 positions to monitor , multiple deep observations",
    "can ameliorate the confounding effects of scintillation and eclipses while requiring a fraction of the time of a comparably complete all - sky survey . by comparison ,",
    "the otherwise prodigious parkes multibeam survey found `` only '' 17 msps in over 40,000 pointings ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "in addition to the intrinsic interest in discovering new msps , by thoroughly searching all such lat sources , we will gain confidence that the msps we have found can truly provide a volume - limited sample of the energetic , @xmath1-loud msps , an invaluable step in the study of the msp population of the milky way .",
