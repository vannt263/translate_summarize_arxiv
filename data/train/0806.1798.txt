    "fusing the opinion of several human experts , also known as the experts fusion problem , is an important question in the image classification field and very few studied .",
    "indeed , the ground truth is rarely known before the scene has been imaged ; consequently , some experts have to provide their perception of the images in order to train the classifiers ( for supervised classifiers ) , and also to evaluate the image classification . in most of the real applications",
    ", the experts can not provide the different classes on the images with certitude .",
    "moreover , the difference of experts perceptions can be very large , and so many parts of the images have conflicting information .",
    "thereby , only one expert _",
    "is not reliable enough , and experts fusion is required .    image classification is generally done on a local part of the image ( pixel , or most of the time on small tiles of _",
    "e.g. _ 16@xmath016 or 32@xmath032 pixels ) .",
    "classification methods can usually be described into three steps .",
    "first , significant features are extracted from these tiles . generally , a second step in necessary in order to reduce these features , because they are too numerous . in the third step ,",
    "these features are given to classification algorithms .",
    "the particularity in considering small tiles in image classification is that sometimes , more than one class can co - exist on a tile .",
    "an example of such an image classification process is seabed characterization .",
    "this serves many useful purposes , _ e.g _ help the navigation of autonomous underwater vehicles or provide data to sedimentologists .",
    "in such sonar applications , which serve as examples throughout the paper , seabed images are obtained with many imperfections @xcite .",
    "indeed , in order to build images , a huge number of physical data ( geometry of the device , coordinates of the ship , movements of the sonar , etc . )",
    "are taken into account , but these data are polluted with a large amount of noises caused by instrumentations .",
    "in addition , there are some interferences due to the signal traveling on multiple paths ( reflection on the bottom or surface ) , due to speckle , and due to fauna and flora .",
    "therefore , sonar images have a lot of imperfections such as imprecision and uncertainty ; thus sediment classification on sonar images is a difficult problem . in this kind of applications , the reality is unknown and different experts can propose different classifications of the image .",
    "figure [ expert ] exhibits the differences between the interpretation and the certainty of two sonar experts trying to differentiate the type of sediment ( rock , cobbles , sand , ripple , silt ) or shadow when the information is invisible .",
    "each color corresponds to a kind of sediment and the associated certainty of the expert for this sediment expressed in term of sure , moderately sure and not sure .",
    "thus , in order to learn an automatic classification algorithm , we must take into account this difference and the uncertainty of each expert .",
    "for example , how a tile of rock labeled as _ not sure _ must be taken into account in the learning step of the classifier and how to take into account this tile if another expert says that it is sand ?",
    "another problem is : how to take into account the tiles with more than one sediment ?",
    "many fusion theories can be used for the experts fusion in image classification such as voting rules @xcite , possibility theory @xcite , belief function theory @xcite . in our case",
    ", experts can express their certitude on their perception . as a result ,",
    "probabilities theories such as the bayesian theory or the belief function theory are more adapted .",
    "indeed , the possibility theory is more adapted to imitate the imprecise data whereas probability - based theories is more adapted to imitate the uncertain data .",
    "of course both possibility and probability - based theories can imitate imprecise and uncertain data at the same time , but not so easily . that is why , our choice is conducted on the belief function theory , also called the dempster - shafer theory ( dst ) @xcite .",
    "we can divide the fusion approach into four steps : the belief function model , the parameters estimation depending on the model ( not always necessary ) , the combination , and the decision .",
    "the most difficult step is presumably the first one : the belief function model from which the other steps follow .",
    "moreover , in real applications of image classification , experts conflict can be very large , and we have to take into account the heterogeneity of the tiles ( more than one class can be present on the tile ) .",
    "consequently , the dezert - smarandache theory ( dsmt ) @xcite , an extension of the belief function theory , can fit better to our problem of image classification if there is conflict .",
    "indeed , considering the space of discernment @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the hypothesis `` the considered unit belongs to the class @xmath3 '' . in the classical belief function theory , the belief functions , also called the basic belief assignments , are defined by a mapping of the power set @xmath4 onto @xmath5 $ ] .",
    "the power set @xmath4 is closed under the @xmath6 operator , and @xmath7 . in the extension",
    "proposed in the dsmt , generalized basic belief assignments are defined by a mapping of the hyper - power set @xmath8 onto @xmath5 $ ] , where the hyper - power set @xmath8 is closed under both @xmath6 and @xmath9 operators .",
    "consequently , we can manage finely the conflict of the experts and also take into account the tiles with more than one class .",
    "in the first section , we discuss and present different belief function models based on the power set and the hyper power set .",
    "these models try to answer our problem .",
    "we study these models also in the steps of combination and decision of the information fusion .",
    "these models allow , in a second section , to a general discussion on the difference between the dsmt and dst in terms of capacity to represent our problem and in terms of decision . finally , we present an illustration of our proposed experts fusion on real sonar images , which represent a particularly uncertain environment .",
    "in this section , we present five models taking into account the possible specificities of the application .",
    "first , we recall the principles of the dst and dsmt we apply here",
    ". then we present a numerical example which illustrates the five proposed models presented afterward .",
    "the first three models are presented in the context of the dst , the fourth model in the context of the dsmt , and the fifth model in both contexts .",
    "the belief functions or basic belief assignments @xmath10 are defined by the mapping of the power set @xmath4 onto @xmath5 $ ] , in the dst , and by the mapping of the hyper - power set @xmath8 onto @xmath5 $ ] , in the dsmt , with :    @xmath11    and @xmath12 in the dst , and @xmath13 in the dsmt , where @xmath14 is a given tile of the image .",
    "the equation ( [ close ] ) allows that we assume a closed world @xcite .",
    "we can define the belief function with only : @xmath15 and the world is open @xcite . in a closed world , we can add one element in order to propose an open world .",
    "these simple conditions in equation ( [ close ] ) and ( [ normdst ] ) or ( [ close ] ) and ( [ normdsmt ] ) , give a large panel of definitions of the belief functions , which is one of the difficulties of the theory .",
    "the belief functions must therefore be chosen according to the intended application .    in our case ,",
    "the space of discernment @xmath16 represents the different kind of sediments on sonar images , such as rock , sand , silt , cobble , ripple or shadow ( that means no sediment information ) .",
    "the experts give their perception and belief according to their certainty .",
    "for instance , the expert can be moderately sure of his choice when he labels one part of the image as belonging to a certain class , and be totally doubtful on another part of the image .",
    "moreover , on a considered tile , more than one sediment can be present .",
    "consequently we have to take into account all these aspects of the applications . in order to simplify",
    ", we consider only two classes in the following : the rock referred as @xmath17 , and the sand , referred as @xmath18 .",
    "the proposed models can be easily extended , but their study is easier to understand with only two classes .",
    "hence , on certain tiles , @xmath17 and @xmath18 can be present for one or more experts .",
    "the belief functions have to take into account the certainty given by the experts ( referred respectively as @xmath19 and @xmath20 , two numbers in @xmath5 $ ] ) as well as the proportion of the kind of sediment in the tile @xmath14 ( referred as @xmath21 and @xmath22 , also two numbers in @xmath5 $ ] ) .",
    "we have two interpretations of `` the expert believes @xmath17 '' : it can mean that the expert thinks that there is @xmath17 on @xmath14 and not @xmath18 , or it can mean that the expert thinks that there is @xmath17 on @xmath14 and it can also have @xmath18 but he does not say anything about it . the first interpretation yields that hypotheses @xmath17 and @xmath18 are exclusive and with the second they are not exclusive .",
    "we only study the first case : @xmath17 and @xmath18 are exclusive .",
    "but on the tile @xmath14 , the expert can also provide @xmath17 and @xmath18 , in this case the two propositions `` the expert believes @xmath17 '' and `` the expert believes @xmath17 and @xmath18 '' are not exclusive .",
    "many combination rules have been proposed these last years in the context of the belief function theory ( @xcite , _ etc . _ ) . in the context of the dst ,",
    "the combination rule most used today seems to be the conjunctive consensus rule given by @xcite for all @xmath23 by : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the response of the expert @xmath26 , and @xmath27 the associated belief function .    in the context of the dsmt",
    ", the conjunctive consensus rule can be used for all @xmath28 and @xmath29 . if we want to take the decision only on the elements in @xmath16 , some rules propose to redistribute the conflict on these elements . the most accomplished rule to provide that is the pcr5 given in @xcite for two experts and for @xmath30 , @xmath31 by : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the conjunctive consensus rule given by the equation ( [ consensus ] ) , @xmath34 is the conjunctive normal form of @xmath35 and the denominators are not null .",
    "we can easily generalize this rule for @xmath36 experts , for @xmath30 , @xmath31 : @xmath37 where @xmath38 counts from 1 to @xmath36 avoiding @xmath3 : @xmath39 @xmath40 , and @xmath10 is the conjunctive consensus rule given by the equation ( [ consensus ] ) .",
    "the comparison of all the combination rules is not the purpose of this paper .",
    "consequently , we use here the equation ( [ consensus ] ) in the context of the dst and the equation ( [ genedsmtcombination ] ) in the context of the dsmt .",
    "the decision is a difficult task .",
    "no measures are able to provide the best decision in all the cases .",
    "generally , we consider the maximum of one of the three functions : credibility , plausibility , and pignistic probability .    in the context of the dst , the credibility function",
    "is given for all @xmath23 by : @xmath41 the plausibility function is given for all @xmath23 by : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the complementary of @xmath14 .",
    "the pignistic probability , introduced by @xcite , is here given for all @xmath23 , with @xmath44 by : @xmath45 generally the maximum of these functions is taken on the elements in @xmath16 , but we will give the values on all the focal elements .    in the context of the dsmt the corresponding generalized functions have been proposed @xcite .",
    "the generalized credibility @xmath46 is defined by : @xmath47 the generalized plausibility @xmath48 is defined by : @xmath49 the generalized pignistic probability is given for all @xmath28 , with @xmath44 is defined by : @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the dsm cardinality corresponding to the number of parts of @xmath14 in the venn diagram of the problem @xcite .",
    "if the credibility function provides a pessimist decision , the plausibility function is often too optimist .",
    "the pignistic probability is often taken as a compromise .",
    "we present the three functions for our models .",
    "consider two experts providing their opinion on the tile @xmath14 .",
    "the first expert says that on tile @xmath14 there is some rock @xmath17 with a certainty equal to 0.6 .",
    "hence for this first expert we have : @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 .",
    "the second expert thinks that there are 50% of rock and 50% of sand on the considered tile @xmath14 with a respective certainty of 0.6 and 0.4 .",
    "hence for the second expert we have : @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath54 and @xmath57 .",
    "we illustrate all our proposed models with this numerical exemple .",
    "if we consider the space of discernment given by @xmath59 , we can define a belief function by : @xmath60 in this case , it is natural to distribute @xmath61 and @xmath62 on @xmath63 which represent the ignorance .",
    "this model takes into account the certainty given by the expert but the space of discernment does not consider the possible heterogeneity of the given tile @xmath14 .",
    "consequently , we have to add another focal element meaning that there are two classes @xmath17 and @xmath18 on @xmath14 . in the context of the dempster - shafer theory",
    ", we can call this focal element @xmath64 and the space of discernment is given by @xmath65 , and the power set is given by @xmath66 .",
    "hence we can define our first model @xmath58 for our application by : @xmath67    on our numerical example , we obtain : @xmath68 hence for the consensus combination for the model @xmath58 , the belief function @xmath69 , the credibility , the plausibility and the pignistic probability are given by : @xmath70 where : @xmath71 this belief function provides an ambiguity because the same mass is put on @xmath17 , the rock , and @xmath72 , the conflict . with the maximum of credibility , plausibility or pignistic probability",
    "this ambiguity is suppressed because these functions do not consider the empty set .      in the first model @xmath58 , the possible heterogeneity of the tile is taken into account .",
    "however , the ignorance is characterized by @xmath74 and not by @xmath75 anymore , and class @xmath64 represents the situation when the two classes @xmath17 and @xmath18 are on @xmath14 .",
    "consequently @xmath74 could be equal to @xmath75 , and we can propose another model @xmath73 given by : @xmath76    on our numerical example , we have :    @xmath77    in this model @xmath73 the ignorance is partial and the conjunctive consensus rule , the credibility , the plausibility and the pignistic probability are given by : @xmath78 where @xmath79    the previous ambiguity in @xmath58 between @xmath17 ( the rock ) and @xmath72 ( the conflict ) is still present with a belief on @xmath72 higher than @xmath17 .",
    "moreover , in this model the mass on @xmath64 is null !    these models @xmath58 and @xmath73 are different because in the dst",
    "the classes @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath64 are supposed to be exclusive .",
    "indeed , the fact that the power set @xmath4 is not closed under @xmath9 operator leads to the exclusivity of the classes .      in our application , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath64",
    "can not be considered exclusive on @xmath14 . in order to propose a model following the dst , we have to study exclusive classes only . hence , in our application , we can consider a space of discernment of three exclusive classes @xmath81 , following the notations given on the figure [ aetb ] .     and",
    "@xmath18.,height=188 ]    hence , we can propose a new model @xmath80 given by : @xmath82 note that @xmath83 .",
    "on our numerical example we obtain : @xmath84    hence , the conjunctive consensus rule , the credibility , the plausibility and the pignistic probability are given by : @xmath85 where @xmath86    on this example , with this model @xmath80 the decision will be @xmath17 with the maximum of pignistic probability .",
    "but the decision could _ a priori _ be taken also on @xmath87 because @xmath88 is the highest .",
    "we show however in the discussion section that it is not possible .      in the context of the dsmt",
    ", we can write @xmath90 and easily propose a fourth model @xmath89 , without any consideration on the exclusivity of the classes , given by :    @xmath91    this last model @xmath89 allows to represent our problem without adding an artificial class @xmath64 .",
    "thus , the model @xmath89 based on the dsmt gives :    @xmath92    the obtained mass @xmath69 with the conjunctive consensus yields :    @xmath93    these results are exactly the same for the model @xmath80 .",
    "these two models do not present ambiguity and show that the mass on @xmath94 ( rock and sand ) is the highest .",
    "the generalized credibility , the generalized plausibility and the generalized pignistic probability are given by : @xmath95    like the model @xmath80 , on this example , the decision will be @xmath17 with the maximum of pignistic probability criteria . but",
    "here also the maximum of @xmath69 is reached for @xmath96 .",
    "if we want to consider only the kind of possible sediments @xmath17 and @xmath18 and not also the conjunctions , we can use a proportional conflict redistribution rules such as the pcr5 proposed in @xcite .",
    "consequently we have @xmath97 and @xmath98 , and the pcr5 rule provides : @xmath99    the credibility , the plausibility and the pignistic probability are given by : @xmath100 on this numerical example , the decision will be the same than the consensus rule , here the maximum of pignistic probability is reached for @xmath17 ( rock ) . in the next section",
    "we see that is not always the case .",
    "another model @xmath101 which can be used in both the dst and the dsmt is given considering only one belief function according to the proportion by : @xmath102 if for one expert , the tile contains only @xmath17 , @xmath52 , and @xmath103 .",
    "if for another expert , the tile contains @xmath17 and @xmath18 , we take into account the certainty and proportion of the two sediments but not only on one focal element .",
    "consequently , we have simply : @xmath104    in the dst context , the consensus rule , the credibility , the plausibility and the pignistic probability are given by : @xmath105 in this case we do not have the plausibility to decide on @xmath94 , because the conflict is on @xmath72 .    in the dsmt context , the consensus rule , the generalized credibility , the generalized plausibility and the generalized pignistic probability are given by : @xmath106 the decision with the maximum of pignistic probability criteria is still @xmath17 .",
    "the pcr5 rule provides : @xmath107 where @xmath108 with this model and example the pcr5 rule , the decision will be also @xmath17 , and we do not have difference between the consensus rules in the dst and dsmt .",
    "we have build , in the previous section , the models @xmath58 , @xmath73 , @xmath80 , @xmath89 , and @xmath101 in the dsmt case in order to take into account the decision considering also @xmath94 ( `` there is rock and sand on the tile '' ) .",
    "in fact only the @xmath58 and @xmath73 models can do it .",
    "model @xmath73 can do it only if both experts say @xmath94 .",
    "these two models assume that @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath94 are exclusive .",
    "of course this assumption is false . for the models @xmath80 , @xmath89 and @xmath101 , we have to take the decision on the credibilities , plausibilities or pignistic probabilities , but these three functions for @xmath94 can not be higher than @xmath17 or @xmath18 ( or for @xmath109 than @xmath110 and @xmath111 with the notations of the model @xmath80 ) .",
    "indeed for all @xmath112 , @xmath113 and @xmath114 , so for all @xmath115 : @xmath116    hence , our first problem is not solved : we can never choose @xmath94 with the maximum of credibility , plausibility or pignistic probability .",
    "if the two experts think that the considered tile contains rock and sand ( @xmath117 ) , then the pignistic probabilities are equal .",
    "however the belief on @xmath94 can be the highest ( see the example on the models @xmath80 and @xmath89 ) .",
    "the limits of the decision rules are reached in this case .",
    "we have seen that we can describe our problem both in the dst and the dsmt context .",
    "the dsmt is more adapted to modelize the belief on @xmath94 for example with the model @xmath89 , but model @xmath80 with the dst can provide exactly the same belief on @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath94 . consequently , the only difference we can expect on the decision comes from the combination rules .",
    "in the presented numerical example , the decisions are the same : we choose @xmath17 .",
    "take another example with this last model @xmath101 : the first expert provides : @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath54 and @xmath57 , and the second expert provides : @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath118 and @xmath119 .",
    "we want take a decision only on @xmath17 or @xmath18 .",
    "hence we have : @xmath120    for @xmath101 on the dst context : @xmath121    @xmath101 with pcr5 gives ( with the partial conflicts : @xmath122 , @xmath123 , @xmath124 and @xmath125 ) : @xmath126 this last example shows that we have a difference between the dst and the dsmt , but what is the best solution ? with the dst we choose @xmath17 and with the dsmt we choose @xmath18 .",
    "we can show that the decision will be the same in the most of the case ( about 99.4% ) .",
    "the space where experts can define their opinions on which @xmath127 classes are present in a given tile is a part of @xmath5^n$ ] : @xmath128^n\\cap ( \\displaystyle \\sum_{x\\in\\theta } m(x)\\leq 1)$ ] . in order to study the different combination rules , and the situations",
    "where they differ , we use a monte carlo method , considering the weights @xmath21 , @xmath19 , @xmath22 , @xmath20 ,  , as uniform variables , filtering them by the condition @xmath129 for one expert .",
    "thus , we measure the proportion of situations where decision differs between the consensus combination rule , and the pcr5 , where conflict is proportionally distributed .",
    "we can not choose @xmath94 , as the measure of @xmath94 is always lower ( or equal with probability 0 ) than the measure of @xmath17 or @xmath18 .",
    "in the case of two classes , @xmath63 is the ignorance , and is usually excluded ( as it always maximises @xmath130 , @xmath131 , @xmath132 , @xmath133 , @xmath134 and @xmath135 ) .",
    "we restrict the possible choices to singletons , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , etc .",
    "therefore , it is equivalent to tag the tile by the most credible class ( maximal for @xmath130 ) , the most plausible ( maximal for @xmath131 ) , the most probable ( maximal for @xmath132 ) or the heaviest ( maximal for @xmath10 ) , as the only focal elements are singletons , @xmath16 and @xmath72 .",
    "the only situation where the total order induced by the masses @xmath10 on singletons can be modified is when the conflict is distributed on the singletons , as is the case in the pcr5 method .",
    "+ thus , for two classes , the subspace where the decision is `` rock '' by consensus rule is very similar to the subspace where the decision is `` rock '' by the pcr5 rule : only 0.6% of the volume differ . for a higher number of classes ,",
    "the decision obtained by fusing the two experts opinions is much less stable :    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      +    we have applied the consensus rule and the pcr5 rule with this model .",
    "the decision is given by the maximum of pignistic probability .",
    "in most of the cases the decisions taken by the two rules are the same .",
    "we note a difference only on 0.4657% of the tiles .",
    "indeed , we are in the seven classes case with only 0.1209 of conflict , the simulation given on the figure 3 show that we have few chance that the decisions differ .",
    "in this paper we have proposed five different models in order to take into account two classical problems in uncertain image classification ( for training or evaluation ) : the heterogeneity of the considered tiles and the certainty of the experts .",
    "these five models have been developed in the dst and dsmt contexts .",
    "the heterogeneity of the tile and the certainty of the expert can be easily taken into account in the models . however",
    ", if we want to have the plausibility of taking a decision on such a tile ( with a conjunction @xmath94 ) the usual decision functions ( credibility , plausibility and pignistic probability ) are not sufficient : they can not allow a such decision .",
    "we can take the decision on @xmath94 only if we consider the belief function and if the model provides a belief on @xmath94 .",
    "we have also studied the decision according to the conflict and to the combination rules : conjunctive consensus rule and pcr5 rule .",
    "the decision ( taken with the maximum of the credibility , the plausibility or the pignistic probability ) is the same in most of the cases . for two experts , more classes",
    "leads to more conflict and to more cases giving a different decision with the different rules .",
    "we have also illustrated one of the proposed models on real sonar images classified manually by two different experts . in this application",
    "the total conflict between the two experts is 0.1209 and we note a difference of decision only on 0.4657% of the tiles",
    ".    we can easily generalize our models for three or more experts and use the generalized combination of the pcr5 given by the equation ( [ genedsmtcombination ] ) .",
    "of course the conflict will be higher and the difference in the decision must be studied .",
