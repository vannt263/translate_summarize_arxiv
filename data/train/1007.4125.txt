    "the hoyle state ( the @xmath26 state at @xmath27 mev in @xmath13c ) is a typical cluster state with the @xmath14 cluster structure  @xcite , which appears by only @xmath28 mev above the @xmath14 threshold and is characterized by the large monopole transition rate sharing about 16  % of the energy - weighted sum rule  @xcite .",
    "recently the hoyle state has been reinvestigated from the viewpoint of the @xmath9 condensation  @xcite .",
    "the definitions and occurrences of the nuclear @xmath9-particle condensation are discussed in detail in ref .",
    "many theoretical works have showed that the hoyle state has a @xmath14-condensate - like structure  @xcite , in which the @xmath14 particles occupy an identical @xmath29-orbit with @xmath30 probability  @xcite , forming a dilute @xmath9-gas - like configuration with @xmath15 , i.e.  the product state of three @xmath9 s .    the structure study of @xmath31o has recently made a great advance .",
    "the six lowest @xmath32 states of @xmath31o have very nicely been reproduced up to about @xmath33  mev excitation energy , including the ground state , with the @xmath34 orthogonality condition model ( ocm )  @xcite .",
    "the ocm is a semi - microscopic cluster model , which is an approximation of rgm ( resonating group method ) and is extensively described in ref .",
    "many successful applications of ocm are reported in ref .",
    "the @xmath34 ocm calculation showed that the @xmath35 state around the @xmath34 threshold is a strong candidate of the @xmath34-particle condensate state , having a large @xmath9 condensate fraction of @xmath36  % for the @xmath9-gas - like configuration @xmath37 as well as a large component of @xmath38c@xmath39 configuration .",
    "the @xmath40 state could be called the hoyle - analogue state .",
    "the hoyle - analogue states heavier than @xmath31o are predicted to exist around their @xmath9-cluster disintegrated thresholds in self - conjugate @xmath41 nuclei  @xcite .",
    "besides the @xmath42 nuclei , one can also expect cluster - gas states composed of alpha and triton clusters ( including valence neutrons etc . ) around their cluster disintegrated thresholds in @xmath43 nuclei , in which all clusters are in their respective @xmath29 orbits , similar to the hoyle state with @xmath15 .",
    "the states , thus , can be called _ hoyle - analogue _ in the non - self - conjugated nuclei .",
    "it is an intriguing subject to investigate whether or not the hoyle - analogue states exist in @xmath43 nuclei , for example , @xmath2b , composed of @xmath44 and @xmath23 clusters .    the cluster structure in @xmath2b",
    "was studied about 30 years ago with the @xmath3 ocm using the harmonic oscillator basis by nishioka et al .",
    "@xcite . they found that 1 )  the @xmath45 state ( @xmath46  mev ) just below the @xmath47 threshold has a well - developed molecular - like structure of @xmath21li(g.s)+@xmath9 , where @xmath21li(g.s ) denotes the ground state of @xmath8li with the @xmath9+@xmath23 cluster structure , and 2 )  the @xmath48  ( g.s ) and @xmath49 ( @xmath50  mev ) states have shell - model - like compact structures .",
    "the model space adopted in ref .",
    "@xcite , however , was not sufficient to account simultaneously for the @xmath8li+@xmath9 cluster configuration as well as the @xmath3 gas - like configuration .",
    "in addition , limited experimental data in those days caused difficulties in giving the definite conclusion that the @xmath45 state has an @xmath3 cluster structure .",
    "recently kawabata and his collaborators have investigated the excited states of @xmath2b by using the @xmath51 reaction  @xcite .",
    "they eventually concluded that the @xmath4 state at @xmath6 = 8.56 mev has an @xmath9-cluster structure . among many reasons for this conclusion ,",
    "one is a large isoscalar monopole transition rate for the @xmath4 state , @xmath52  @xmath53 , which is of the similar value to that for the hoyle state in @xmath13c , @xmath54  @xmath53 .",
    "a close relation between large isoscalar monopole strengths and underlying cluster structures in excited states were discussed by the present authors et al .",
    "( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . according to the literature",
    ", the largeness of the isoscalar monopole transition rate for @xmath4 originates from the fact that the state has a cluster structure .",
    "another reason why the @xmath4 state has the cluster structure is that the amd ( antisymmetrized molecular dynamics ) calculation  @xcite has reproduced the large monopole transition rate for the @xmath4 state and has succeeded in assigning an @xmath3 cluster structure to this state . comparing the density distribution of the @xmath4 state ( calculated by amd ) with that of the hoyle state ( together with the analysis of the expectation values of the harmonic oscillator quanta in their wave functions ) ,",
    "the amd calculation  @xcite claimed that the @xmath4 state has a clustering feature similar to that of the hoyle state .",
    "however , they did not study single - cluster properties such as single - cluster orbits and their occupation probabilities in the @xmath4 state .",
    "their quantities are independent on the information of the density distribution and the expectation values of the harmonic oscillator quanta in the wave function .",
    "thus , it is very important to study the single - cluster properties in order to judge whether the @xmath4 state possesses the similarity to the hoyle state with the @xmath15-like structure . as discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , the single - cluster motions such as @xmath9 ( @xmath23 ) cluster orbits and their occupation probabilities in a nuclear state can be investigated by solving the eigenvalue equation of the single - cluster density matrix @xmath55 derived from the microscopic and/or semi - microscopic wave functions .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to study the structure of @xmath56 and @xmath57 states in @xmath2b up to around the @xmath3 threshold .",
    "here we take the @xmath3 ocm with the gaussian expansion method ( gem ) , the model space of which is large enough to cover the @xmath3 gas , the @xmath8li+@xmath9 cluster , as well as the shell - model configurations .",
    "combining ocm and gem provides a powerful method to study the structure of light nuclei  @xcite as well as light hypernuclei  @xcite , because the pauli - blocking effect among the clusters is properly taken into account by ocm and gem covers an approximately complete model space  @xcite .",
    "this framework can treat precisely a strong parity dependence of the @xmath58 potential :  the negative - parity potential is attractive enough to make bound states ( @xmath48 and @xmath59 ) and resonant states ( @xmath60 and @xmath61 ) of @xmath8li , where s the positive - parity potential is not .",
    "this parity dependence should play an important role in producing the cluster states of @xmath2b , as will be discussed later .",
    "the single - cluster properties such as single-@xmath9-particle ( single-@xmath23-particle ) orbits and occupation probabilities are investigated to judge whether or not the @xmath18 state has a hoyle - analogue structure by solving the eigenvalue equation of the single cluster density matrix @xmath55 derived from the total wave function of @xmath2b .",
    "the resonance structure of @xmath1 states is also studied with the complex scaling method ( csm ) , since they appear around the @xmath3 threshold with @xmath62 mev .",
    "it is also interesting to explore the hoyle - analogue state with the @xmath3 structure in @xmath1 states , because one can conjecture an appearance of the product state , @xmath63 , in @xmath64 of @xmath2b ( @xmath65 comes from the spin of triton ) from the similarity of @xmath15 in the hoyle state .",
    "the structure of the positive - parity states ( isospin @xmath66 ) in @xmath2b so far has not been discussed well in amd  @xcite and non - core shell model  @xcite . recently several positive - parity states of @xmath2b with @xmath66 are observed with the @xmath21li(@xmath67be,@xmath68)@xmath69he reaction  @xcite , the @xmath21li(@xmath8li,@xmath2b@xmath22)@xmath23 reaction  @xcite , and the decay - particle measurements of @xmath9+@xmath21li and @xmath23+@xmath70be from excited @xmath2b@xmath22 states  @xcite .",
    "an interesting result in their experiments is as follows :  the @xmath71 state at @xmath72 mev which was identified so far as isospin @xmath73 state  @xcite , is observed through the @xmath9+@xmath21li decay channel  @xcite .",
    "they concluded that the @xmath19-mev state has isospin @xmath66 or alternatively it is observed at a similar energy to that with @xmath73 .",

    "the @xmath7 state is characterized by the monopole transition strength as large as the @xmath26 at @xmath343 mev in @xmath13c . the present study succeeded in reproducing its excitation energy and monopole transition strength .",
    "we found that this state has an @xmath3 cluster structure with the nuclear radius of @xmath344 fm .",
    "the study of the single - cluster properties such as single - cluster orbits and occupation probabilities for @xmath45 showed that there is no concentration of the single-@xmath9 occupation probability on a single orbit and the radial part of the single-@xmath9 orbits has nodal behaviors in the inner region , illustrating rather strong pauli - blocking effect .",
    "these results are in contrast with those of the hoyle state with the dilute @xmath14-condensate - like character @xmath345 , in which the @xmath9 particle occupies a single @xmath29-orbit ( zero node ) with about @xmath16% probability .",
    "consequently the @xmath7 state could not be identified as the analogue of the hoyle state , possessing a dominant gas - like configuration of @xmath24 .",
    "the reason why the @xmath7 state is not of the hoyle - analogue can be understood from the following facts :  the @xmath4 state is bound by @xmath283 mev with respect to the @xmath3 threshold , while the hoyle state is located by @xmath28  mev above the @xmath14 threshold and has a dilute @xmath14 structure .",
    "the extra binding energy of the @xmath7 state with respect to the @xmath3 threshold is likely to suppress strongly the growth of the gas - like @xmath3 structure in this state .    as for the @xmath57 states , the @xmath122 state appears as a bound state at @xmath346 mev around @xmath21li+@xmath9 threshold .",
    "this low excitation energy indicates that @xmath9-type correlation should play an important role in the state .",
    "in fact , we found that the @xmath122 state with @xmath347  fm has the @xmath21li(g.s)+@xmath9 structure with @xmath266-wave relative motion , although the @xmath21li(@xmath120 ) part is rather distorted in comparison with the ground state of @xmath21li .",
    "since the @xmath4 state has the largest @xmath275 factor for the @xmath8li(g.s)+@xmath9 channel with @xmath107-wave relative motion compared with those of other @xmath8li+@xmath9 and @xmath110be+@xmath23 channels , the @xmath285 and @xmath4 states of @xmath2b can be interpreted as the parity - doublet partners each other .",
    "they are similar to the typical example of the parity doublet , @xmath348 and @xmath349 states in @xmath309ne , with the @xmath31o+@xmath9 cluster structure  @xcite .",
    "in addition to @xmath285 , we found that the @xmath314 state appears as a resonant state at @xmath350 mev ( @xmath317  kev ) around the @xmath3 threshold with csm .",
    "the large radius ( @xmath351  fm ) indicates that the state has a dilute cluster structure .",
    "the analysis of the single - cluster properties showed that this state has a main configuration of @xmath352 with about @xmath25% probability .",
    "thus , we could call the @xmath314 state the hoyle - analogue with @xmath352 , which is similar to the hoyle state possessing the main configuration @xmath15 with about @xmath16% probability .",
    "it should be reminded that @xmath314 is located by @xmath335 mev above the @xmath3 threshold , while @xmath17 is bound by @xmath353 mev with respect to the three cluster threshold .",
    "the latter binding energy leads to the suppression of the development of the gas - like @xmath3 structure in @xmath17 , whereas the gas - like structure with a large nuclear radius grows up in @xmath314 because the state appears above the three - body threshold .",
    "recently , the @xmath354 state at @xmath72 mev with @xmath341 kev ( located at @xmath342 mev above the @xmath3 threshold ) was observed through the @xmath9+@xmath21li decay channel  @xcite .",
    "the experimental energy and width of the @xmath19-mev state are in good correspondence to the present calculated results of the @xmath314 state .",
    "the hoyle - analogue state in @xmath2b , thus , could be assigned as the @xmath19-mev state .",
