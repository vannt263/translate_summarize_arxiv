    "the 8/24 @xmath1 m  ratio clearly separates star forming galaxies according to both metallicity and the relative strengths of stellar and dust emission : metal - rich galaxies preferentially show high 8/24 @xmath1 m  ratios and low ratios of stellar to dust emission at 8 @xmath1 m , while metal - poor galaxies show opposite trends .",
    "these color separations are interpreted to be caused , to first order , by the decreased emission strengths of pah molecules in the low - metallicity ism .",

    "if aperture corrections at 24 @xmath1 m  are significant , the r@xmath46 ratio will decrease for regions d1 and d2 ( but not for the global measurements ) , and the @xcite diagnostic color ratios correctly separate the regions d1 and d2 into pah - emitting and pah - deficient , respectively .      in normal star - forming galaxies ,",
    "there is a remarkably tight correlation between the total ir luminosity and the strength of radio continuum emission ( see , e.g. , de  jong etal .",

    "the tightness of the relation ( scatter of less than 0.3 dex over multiple orders of magnitude ) is especially remarkable , given that the physical processes that drive ir ( re - radiation of absorbed photons by dust grains ) and radio emission ( typically nonthermal synchrotron emission , though a thermal free - free component can also contribute ) are only indirectly associated with one another .",
    "indeed , @xcite shows that the relation holds for ir- and radio - deficient galaxies , but that these systems require a complex interplay of star formation , dust content and magnetic fields to produce the apparently linear relation in this regime .",
    "we explore the relation between the global radio and ir luminosities of ngc1705 .",
    "the total ir ( tir ) flux ( derived by applying equation 4 from dale & helou 2002 ) and the radio continuum luminosity appear to be related via a constant value in star - forming galaxies [ commonly denoted by the `` q '' parameter , where q @xmath49 log(s@xmath50/s@xmath51 ) ; see , e.g. , helou etal.1985 , bell 2003 ] .",

    "* ) yields similar estimates of the expected radio continuum flux density .",
    "regardless of the extrapolation , it is clear that the radio continuum of ngc1705 is extremely weak compared to the observed far - ir flux densities .",
    "the detection , using these _ spitzer _  data , of strong far - ir emission shows that there is significant dispersion amongst individual galaxies in the far - ir vs. radio correlation .",
    "indeed , @xcite suggests that this correlation is dependent on numerous factors and upon galaxy type , and that both the ir and radio luminosities of dwarf galaxies are suggested to significantly underestimate the true star formation rate .",
    "it is important to note , by comparison with the internal scatter in individual galaxies seen in the larger sample of @xcite , that the tightness of the global radio - ir correlation may depend on averaging over a significantly large number of emission regions . in dwarf galaxies , and",
    "starbursting dwarf galaxies in particular , the ir and radio emission are typically dominated by one ( or at most a few ) luminous star formation regions , allowing significant deviations from the relations seen in more massive galaxies . in larger starburst galaxies ,",
    "a deficiency of radio continuum emission compared to the far - ir luminosity has been attributed to a very young ( @xmath6 few myr ) , `` nascent '' starburst that has occured after an extended period ( @xmath12 100 myr ) of quiescence ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "similarly , the `` post - starburst '' nature of the system @xcite and spatially resolved stellar photometry @xcite have shown that most of the o stars associated with the strong burst of star formation have exploded as sne , implying a strong synchrotron emission component .",

    "we have presented observations of the nearby dwarf starburst galaxy ngc1705 made with all three instruments on board the _ spitzer space telescope_. this is one of the few local dwarf galaxies known to host a ssc , and the only such system in the _ sings _  sample .",
    "the galaxy underwent a strong starburst some 15 myr ago that produced the ssc and massive star formation in the field ; this starburst is driving a multiphase outflow from the ssc region and this has dramatic consequences for the multiwavelength properties of the galaxy .",

    "stellar and warm dust emission from the ssc is still prominent at 8 @xmath1 m , but the sed appears to flatten out toward longer wavelengths , suggesting that most of the warm dust emission arises from the off - nuclear regions .",
    "there is high surface brightness h@xmath5  emission associated with these dust emission peaks .",
    "the energy source for this off - nuclear nebular and dust emission , some @xmath0 250 pc from the ssc , is likely young massive stars in these regions ; some of these stars may be embedded , thus not contributing to the observed h@xmath5  luminosity .",
    "the lack of extinction toward the ssc @xcite and the modest warm dust emission of the ssc in the mips bands suggests that dust near the ssc may have been removed by the multi - phase outflow or evacuated by the high uv flux from the ssc .",

    "this value represents the mean of the dust mass estimates from using the sed models of @xcite and @xcite and the models of @xcite .",
    "a single - temperature blackbody function is unable to simultaneously fit the observed 24 , 70 and 160 @xmath1 m  flux densities .",
    "both sets of sed models predict a higher dust mass than a single - temperature blackbody fit to the 70 and 160 @xmath1 m  data points . comparing to the h  i  mass implies a global dust - to - gas ratio @xmath0 24@xmath2 lower than the galactic average .",
    "the strong diffuse emission in the irac 8 @xmath1 m  band is dominated by warm dust emission ; irs spectroscopy of the ssc and both off - nuclear sources shows 11.3 @xmath1 m  pah emission in the more luminous of the two dust emission peaks only ( no pah emission is associated with the ssc ) .",
    "this serves as a prudent reminder that irac diffuse 8 @xmath1 m  emission traces both dust continuum and pah emission , and that spectroscopy is essential for a robust separation of the two components .",
    "the fact that variable pah emission strengths are seen in a galaxy with nebular metallicity equal to the empirical pah threshold found by @xcite highlights the complexity in interpreting the nature of diffuse 8 @xmath1 m  emission .    finally , we note that ngc1705 appears to deviate significantly from the canonical far - ir vs. radio correlation , in the sense that strong far - ir emission is present , but radio continuum emission remains undetected at meaningful sensitivity levels",
    ". the galactic outflow may play an important role in affecting the radio continuum emission ; if significant numbers of energetic particles are escaping into the halo , the radio continuum emission will be significantly suppressed compared to the total ir luminosity .",
    "dwarf starburst galaxies , typically dominated by one massive star formation region , appear to be susceptible to strong variations in this ratio ; the tightness of the radio - ir correlation may rely on a larger statistical sampling of star formation regions throughout an individual galaxy .",
