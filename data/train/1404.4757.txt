    "it may happen that @xmath318 lies in @xmath319\\times[0,\\alpha]$ ] .",
    "however , in that case , we can replace @xmath318 with @xmath316 , and therefore we found a @xmath19@xmath20 path of length @xmath272 with all internal vertices in @xmath320\\times[0,\\alpha]$ ] .",
    "indeed , we will show now that we can always fit such a rectangle @xmath321\\times[0,\\alpha]$ ] , suitably rotated and translated , into the square .",
    "we need first a few definitions .",
    "consider two points @xmath322 and @xmath323 in @xmath324 . by symmetry",
    "we may assume that @xmath325 and @xmath326 .",
    "let @xmath327 be the angle of the vector @xmath328 with respect to the horizontal axis .",
    "again by symmetry , we may consider @xmath329 $ ] .",
    "we consider now two rectangles of dimensions @xmath330 placed on each side of the segment @xmath331 .",
    "let @xmath332 be the rectangle to the left of @xmath328 , and let @xmath333 be the rectangle to the right of @xmath328 .",
    "we will show that at least one of these rectangles contains a copy of @xmath334 fully contained in @xmath11 .",
    "notice that the intersection of @xmath332 and @xmath333 with each of the halfplanes @xmath335 , @xmath336 , @xmath337 and @xmath338 gives @xmath339 triangles .",
    "we call them @xmath340 , @xmath341 , @xmath342 and @xmath343 respectively .",
    "all these triangles are right - angled , and denote by @xmath344 , @xmath345 , @xmath346 and @xmath347 the side of the corresponding triangle that it is parallel to the segment @xmath331 .",
    "notice that @xmath348 and @xmath349 .",
    "call a triangle @xmath350 , with @xmath351 and @xmath352 , _ safe _ if @xmath353 .",
    "note that if @xmath340 and @xmath343 are safe or fully contained in the square , then @xmath332 contains the desired rectangle @xmath121 , and analogously for @xmath333 .    since we assumed that @xmath354",
    ", we have @xmath355 .",
    "thus , @xmath340 and @xmath341 are safe .",
    "if @xmath356 , that is @xmath357 , it is clear that either @xmath332 or @xmath333 contain the desired copy of @xmath334 .",
    "thus , we may assume that @xmath358 .",
    "we can also assume that both @xmath19 and @xmath20 are on the boundary of @xmath11 , as otherwise we extend the line segment @xmath331 to the boundary of the square , and the original rectangles are contained in the new ones .",
    "recall that @xmath340 and @xmath341 are safe . if @xmath359 , then @xmath343 is completely contained in the square , and hence @xmath332 satisfies the conditions .",
    "similarly , if @xmath360 , @xmath333 satisfies the conditions .",
    "otherwise , @xmath361 , and the angle @xmath327 is at least @xmath362 , which contradicts our assumption on @xmath327 .    again , by de - poissonizing @xmath88 , we can use proposition  [ ap : prop : new_upperbound ] to show that for given @xmath19 and @xmath20 in @xmath6 , statement ( ii ) in theorem  [ ap : thm : main ] holds with probability at least @xmath211 . by taking a union bound over all at most @xmath212 possible pairs of vertices , statement ( ii ) in theorem  [ ap : thm : main ] follows",
    "theorem  [ ap : thm : main ] establishes a relation between the graph distance and the euclidean distance of two vertices @xmath19 and @xmath20 in @xmath23 that holds a.a.s .",
    "simultaneously for all pairs of vertices .    it would be interesting to find better concentration bounds on the values that @xmath2 can take with high probability .",
    "also , we would like to characterize the probability distributions of @xmath363 and @xmath364 ( i.e.  the expectation and variance of @xmath2 given @xmath1 ) .",
    "what can we say about these distributions ?    in the proof of statement  ( ii ) in theorem",
    "[ ap : thm : main ] , we define a new random variable that stochastically dominates @xmath2 and we give an upper bound for the probability that this random variable is too large .",
    "this argument can be easily adapted in the case @xmath54 , and provide the upper bound @xmath365 .",
    "similarly , the proof of statement  ( i ) in theorem  [ ap : thm : main ] can be adapted to give a lower bound on @xmath366 , but we need the further conditioning upon the event that @xmath1 is large enough .",
