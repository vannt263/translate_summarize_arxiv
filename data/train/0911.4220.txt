    "studies of quasar spectra have fallen out of fashion over the past ten years . this impression is supported by the small number of citations involving optical / uv spectroscopic work found from a random ned search of citations for even the brightest ( e.g. , pg ) sources .",
    "one can identify at least two reasons for this paucity of studies : 1 ) a widespread belief that all broad - line spectra are essentially the same and/or 2 ) the impression that a deeper understanding of broad - line phenomenology and physics is unobtainable .",
    "the one exception , reflecting reason 1 ) involves computation of mean / median composite spectra from large samples ( e.g. 2df , sdss ) .",
    "of course if reason 1 ) is not correct then these results will reenforce reason 2 ) . just as the indiscriminate averaging of obafgkm stellar spectra would yield bizarre conclusions .",
    "the purpose of this review is to convince the reader that reason 1 ) is incorrect and that understanding quasar spectral diversity can stimulate new ideas that will remove the sense of hopelessness reflected in reason ( 2 ) .",
    "the question is how best to represent quasar phenomenological diversity and unite it into a coherent picture .",
    "the history of stellar studies immediately comes to mind although quasars are almost certainly more complicated sources . at the very least source orientation to our line - of sight likely",
    "adds a serious complication .",
    "we have been working on a spectroscopic unification for quasars that , in fact , embraces all broad line emitting agn .",
    "gradually the hope emerged of finding a diagnostic space capable of serving as a surrogate h - r diagram for quasars .",
    "a 2d h - r diagram works quite well because , among other things , stellar orientation plays no major role in spectroscopic studies .",
    "the full power of the stellar h - r diagram requires exploitation of more parameter dimensions .",
    "certainly an equivalent spectroscopic diagnostic space for quasars will require more than two dimensions if only to remove the orientation - physics degeneracy . in 2000",
    "we proposed a 4d eigenvector 1 parameters space ( hereafter 4de1 ; @xcite ) .",
    "4de1 remains the most promising way to emphasize the spectroscopic diversity while also contextualizing the diverse types of broad - line emitting sources .",
    "4de1 space emphasizes observables with the largest intrinsic dispersions including the most statistically significant line profile differences .",
    "4de1 has roots in the principal component analysis ( pca ) of the bright ( pg ) quasar sample ( @xcite ; bg92 ) as well as in correlations that emerged from rosat @xcite .",
    "4de1 in its simplest form involves two bg92 measures : 1 ) full width half maximum of broad h@xmath0 ( fwhm h@xmath0 ) and 2 ) equivalent width ratio of optical feii and broad h@xmath0 : r@xmath2 = w(feii @xmath34750 blend)/w(h@xmath0 ) .",
    "we added measures of 3 ) the soft x - ray photon index ( @xmath4@xmath5 ) and 4 ) civ@xmath31549 broad - line profile displacement at half maximum ( c(1/2 ) ) .",
    "other points of departure from bg92 involve comparison of radio - quiet ( rq ) sources with a large radio - loud ( rl ) sample .",
    "we also subordinate [ oiii]@xmath64959,5007 measures ( although see : @xcite ) .",
    "4de1 tells us that all quasars are not similar whether we observe them at optical , uv or x - ray wavelengths .",
    "thus defined 4de1 includes key measures of both representative high ( hil : civ@xmath31549 , 65ev ) and low ( lil : h@xmath0 , 13.6ev ) ionization lines .",
    "this is important because lil and hil behave very differently . while forming the core of 4de1 the four adopted key parameters only begin to exploit the fundamental trends and source differences that exist .",
    "this review emphasizes results involving 4de1 parameters describing broad emission line profiles .",
    "figure 1 shows the latest representation of the optical plane of 4de1 involving fwhm h@xmath0 and r@xmath2 measures for the 321 brightest ( g@xmath717.0 ) low redshift ( z@xmath70.7 ) quasars ( grey dots ) in the sloan digitized sky survey ( sdss ; dr5 ) @xcite .",
    "results are very little different if one adopts an i - band magnitude cutoff .",
    "an i - band selection adds many nearby lower luminosity sources with strong host galaxy contamination .",
    "sdss does not recognize sources with fwhm h@xmath0 @xmath7 1000 km s@xmath1 as quasars motivating us to add to our sample n=41 narrow - line seyfert 1 ( nlsy1 ) sources brighter than g=17.5 ( z@xmath70.7 ) identified by @xcite ( black squares ) .",
    "source occupation is very similar to what was find with our own low redshift atlas sample of 215 sources @xcite .",
    "figure 2 shows an optical - uv plane of 4de1 involving fwhm h@xmath0 and civ@xmath31549 profile displacement ( c(1/2 ) ) . in this case",
    "the civ measures exhaust the hst archive of available data with n=130 low z sources ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "= 4000 km s@xmath1 .",
    "bins of @xmath8(fwhm h@xmath0 ) = 4000 km s@xmath1 and @xmath8(r@xmath2 ) = 0.5 enclose sources that have statistically similar h@xmath0 width and feii relative strength .",
    "bins labels follow the convention of @xcite .",
    "grey symbols indicate rq sources , circled grey symbols indicate rl quasars and the black symbols indicate the subset of narrow broad line sources extracted from @xcite.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]     versus the centroid shift of broad component of civ@xmath31549 ( at 1/2 fractional intensity ) .",
    "the symbols are similar to those in figure 1 .",
    "the population a / b 4000 km s@xmath1 boundary is also shown.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    figures 1 and 2 clearly show trends but what do they mean ? does figure 1 show a continuous or `` main '' sequence ? or is there evidence for an actual source dichotomy ? even if a dichotomy is not obvious it might be useful to propose one as a means to highlight source difference .",
    "a more striking difference is seen when rl ( grey circle - dots ) and rq ( grey dots ) source occupation in 4de1 is compared in figure 1 .",
    "this occupation difference motivates the idea of a dichotomy because almost all rl sources show fwhm h@xmath0 @xmath9 4000 km s@xmath1 while 50 - 60% of rq sources shows smaller values .",
    "the alternative interpretation would see rl quasars as a fundamentally different class of quasar that partially overlaps with rq domain occupation in 4de1 .",
    "it really does nt matter which interpretation is correct , the rl - rq difference is an important clue about broad line region ( blr ) physics .",
    "other measures ( e.g. , c(1/2 ) and @xmath4@xmath5 ) point to a change in source occupation near 4000 km s@xmath1 .",
    "figure 2 shows that only sources with fwhm h@xmath0 @xmath7 4000 km s@xmath1 show a blueshift / asymmetry of the hil .",
    "these empirical results further motivate the idea of contrasting sources above and below fwhm h@xmath0 = 4000 km s@xmath1 .",
    "the list of source differences , and inferred physical differences , continues to grow ( see table 5 in @xcite ) .",
    "figures 3 and 4 show median composite spectra for the h@xmath0 region in the two most highly populated bins indicated in figure 1 ( a2 and b1 respectively ) .",
    "the composites are generated from 128 and 130 sources respectively and illustrate a striking h@xmath0 line profile difference between pop .",
    "a and b sources .",
    "this is an example of averaging quasar spectra in an organized and predefined context .",
    "it is the best way to bin the sources without imposing any assumptions about the structure of the blr .",
    "the size of the bins was driven by the current accuracy of fwhm h@xmath0 and r@xmath2 measures .",
    "all sources within a bin therefore have statistically similar fwhm and r@xmath2 values .",
    "we think that these median composite spectra , or better said , the differences between them , are the key to a deeper understanding of the quasar blr and structural differences between sources along the principal sequence in the 4de1 optical plane .",
    "figure 3 and 4 show that all quasar spectra are not the same .",
    "our 4000 km s@xmath1 boundary appears to be much more significant than the fwhm h@xmath0 = 2000 km s@xmath1 boundary often used to distinguish narrow ( nlsy1 ) and broad ( blsy1 ) line seyfert galaxies / quasars .",
    "comparison of sources in 1000 km s@xmath1 intervals above and below 2000 km s@xmath1 reveals little difference ; they are all what we call pop . a sources",
    "and they are all ( similarly ) different from pop .",
    ". we will consider and contrast figures 3 and 4 in the next two sections .    .",

    "the [ oiii]@xmath6 4959,5007 and heii@xmath34686 lines are fitted with two gaussians each.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    it is important to emphasize that the n@xmath10 130 sources going into each median composite show a wide diversity of profile shapes although less for pop . a than for pop .",
    "b. naturally we are assuming that 4de1 measures are first - order discriminators .",
    "we also assume that they do not change dramatically with time .",
    "higher - order measures of line shift and shape are known to vary with time .",
    "one can study these changes in an individual source via monitoring , which costs a lot of observing time .",
    "our alternative approach is to generate median spectra from large enough samples that we will likely catch source profiles in all or most significant states of change .",
    "median composite profiles therefore offer the possibility to isolate the underlying most stable or common profile shape .",
    "the shapes that we see in figures 3 and 4 have appeared in earlier composite spectra that we have generated with smaller and less uniform samples .",

    "figure 3 shows our pop . a median composite for bin a2 .",
    "composites for higher a bins would show even more extreme differences especially stronger r@xmath2 but would have lower s / n because they include fewer sources as is clear from figure 1 .",
    "once we have generated the composites we face the challenge of modeling them in the simplest way . over the past 10 + years , and especially for nlsy1 , it has been suggested that sources with narrower h@xmath0 profiles can be well fit with a lorentz function .",
    "they can then be described as lorentz - like profiles .",
    "figure 3 confirms this single - component fit for pop .",
    "a - bin a2 sources .",
    "whatever might be the source - to - source differences there appears to be an underlying stable lorentz line .",

    "a sources are blue shifted .",
    "blueshifts as large as 4 - 5000 km s@xmath1 are observed although most pop .",
    "a sources show smaller displacements of less than 500 km s@xmath1 . while not individually significant the overall sample displacement certainly is significant especially when compared with the distribution of civ line shifts in pop .",

    "a. @xcite .",
    "the large differences between h@xmath0 and civ profiles tell us that the lil and hil in pop . a sources arise in regions with different geometry and kinematics .    the high s / n and resolution of this sdss - based sample enable us to quantify line asymmetry and shift properties of broad h@xmath0 ( see @xcite for definitions of these measures ) .",
    "the distribution of profile asymmetries shows mean / median values consistent with zero asymmetry with a sample standard deviation of @xmath120.11 ( estimated 2@xmath13 measurement uncertainties are @xmath120.16 ) .",
    "mean line shift measures at fw1/4 `` base '' and fw3/4 `` peak '' are -42 and -41 km s@xmath1 respectively . a small fraction ( @xmath115% ) of pop .",
    "a sources show a weak blue wing that involves sources in bins a3 and a4 .",
    "these tend to involve sources with the largest civ blueshifts @xcite suggesting that we may be detecting weak h@xmath0 emission from the same wind or outflow responsible for the hil blueshifts .",
    "the bulk of pop.a h@xmath0 emission involves profiles that are symmetric , unshifted and lorentz - like .",
    "the soft x - ray excess from these sources has been argued to be a thermal disk signatures in what are thought to be the highest accreting sources .",
    "similarly the civ blueshift / asymmetry has been ascribed to a disk wind or outflow .",

    "the apparent super eddington radiators can all be corrected to values below 0.9 by assuming that some pop .",
    "a radiators are observed with the line emitting accretion disk oriented near face - on .",
    "reasonable orientation corrections @xcite increase the smallest m@xmath16 estimates to values above 7.0 thus reducing extreme l@xmath18/l@xmath19 values to the sub - eddington range .",
    "a description of population b sources will be different from the above pop . a description in virtually every measurable parameter .",
    "this includes emission line profiles and a comparison of figures 3 and 4 makes it clear .",
    "b includes the bulk of the rl quasars and about 25% of the rq sources . the probability of radio - loudness in pop .",
    "b is about 4 - 5 times higher than for pop . a @xcite .",
    "the meaning of this rq - rl overlap region in 4de1 is unclear but there are two obvious possibilities : 1 ) rl sources represent a distinct quasar class that partially overlaps the rq domain or 2 ) about 25% of rq quasars show geometry and kinematics identical to rl quasars .",
    "they might be rl pre- and/or post - cursors or their central geometry may be the same as rl galaxies , but either host galaxy morphology or black hole spin prevents their becoming rl .",
    "figure 4 shows our median composite for bin b1 marked in figure 1 .",
    "it represents a median composite of about 130 quasars .",
    "the s / n of the figure 3 and 4 spectra are similar , about 130 .",
    "the median source luminosity in the two bins log(l@xmath18[erg s@xmath1])= 45.7 are also the same ( median redshifts 0.30 and 0.28 for bins a2 and b1 respectively ) .",
    "it is immediately obvious that the bin b1 h@xmath0 profile can not be fit with a lorentz function .",
    "previous studies with our atlas sample @xcite required a minimum of two gaussian components to model the h@xmath0 profile after feii subtraction , unshifted blr + redshifted very broad component vblr @xcite .",
    "figure 4 shows that the double gaussian fit again matches well the h@xmath0 profile in our sdss composite spectrum . if we separate pop .",
    "b sources into luminosity bins we find that fwhm h@xmath0 increases with source luminosity from 5200 km s@xmath1 ( log(l@xmath18[erg s@xmath1])=43 - 44 ) to 9300 km s@xmath1 ( log(l@xmath18[erg s@xmath1])= 48 - 49 ) @xcite . if we correct for the vblr component fwhm h@xmath0@xmath1010@xmath21 km s@xmath1 redshifted @xmath1010@xmath22",

    "b sources .",
    "the values do not come down as much as might be expected because the sources with the largest vblr correction are also the most luminous .",
    "however this tells us that the pop .",

    "figure 4 represents the strongest evidence to date for the blr+vblr interpretation of the pop .",
    "b h@xmath0 line profile . there is a widespread idea that a double peaked accretion disk component is hidden in the profile and indeed ngc5548 the most reverberated source shows it .",
    "if present in all or most sources this disk component does not show up in our high s / n median composite .",
    "it is apparently hidden by an unshifted ( or slightly blueshifted ) blr component and the redshifted vblr .",
    "we consider it virtually impossible that an anomaly in the feii emission ( or error in the feii modeling ) could produce this feature .",
    "it represents a major challenge to our ideas about structure and kinematics of the central region in quasars .    paralleling our discussion of pop .",
    "a sources we note that pop .",
    "b quasars show no soft x - ray excess or civ blueshift ( figure 2 ) . if their presence is a signature of a stable blr under high accretion in pop . a sources",
    "then the blr is much less prominent in pop .",
    "b sources that host an additional vblr emitting component . isolating the blr component of h@xmath0 as a virial estimator in pop .",
    "b suggests that bh masses are on average larger ( log(m@xmath16[m@xmath17)@xmath107 - 10 ) and , especially , that eddington ratio is lower ( log l@xmath18/l@xmath19 @xmath10 -0.7 to -1.4 ) than in pop .",
    "these questions are asked together because we think they are related .",
    "after all the appearance of the vblr component near fwhm h@xmath0=4000 km s@xmath1 is one of the strongest arguments for a pop .",
    "a - b dichotomy @xcite .",
    "we therefore conclude that the dichotomy is real and likely related to a critical eddington ratio below which blr structure undergoes a significant change in geometry and kinematics ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "if a critical l@xmath18/l@xmath19 is the driver then how does the vblr relate to this change ?",
    "so far we can infer four vblr characteristics : 1 ) it is very broad , 2 ) it is highly redshifted , 3 ) it is reasonably well fit by a symmetric gaussian , and 4 ) it becomes more prominent at higher luminosity ( due to a weakening of the central blr component ) .",
    "the equivalent width of the vblr component is roughly constant over six decades of luminosity , which implies production in optically - thick , photoionized gas .",
    "we can identify three classes of models that might explain the vblr : a ) gravitation ( clues 1 and 2 ) , b ) infall ( clue 2 ) , c ) photon downshifting through scattering processes ( clues 1 , 2 and 4 ) .",
    "inferred bh mass values are not large enough to make it likely that the vblr arises close enough to the bh and clue 3 argues against this interpretation as well .",
    "we think that b ) or c ) likely provides the solution and we encourage to pursue them just as we are doing .",
