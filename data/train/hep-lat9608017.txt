    "one of the earliest experimental indications that the nucleon consists not only of three quarks , but also has a gluonic contribution came from the measurement of the fraction of the nucleon momentum carried by the quarks . that this did not sum up to @xmath0 as is required from the energy ",
    "momentum sum rule gave evidence for the existence of the gluon . denoting @xmath1 as the fraction of the nucleon momentum carried by parton @xmath2 we have @xmath3 experimentally @xmath4",
    "so the missing component is large , at least @xmath5 of the total nucleon momentum .",
    "we have previously estimated the quark contribution from a lattice calculation ( at least for the valence part in the quenched approximation ) @xcite . in this contribution",
    "we shall consider @xmath6 .",
    "analogously to @xmath7 we have , with @xmath8 denoting minkowski space and averaging over the polarisations , @xmath9 , \\label{intro.b}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath10 .",
    "( higher moments can also be considered , by inserting covariant derivatives between the @xmath11 s , @xcite . )",
    "we now turn to the lattice .",
    "the gluon operators are euclideanised and @xmath12 . ] and discretised in the usual way . for the field strength",
    "we choose the usual clover leaf form traceless in the colour fields .",
    "this is an @xmath13 operator and so does not contribute to the continuum identification of the clover term with @xmath11 . ] , @xcite , which belongs to an irreducible representation of the @xmath14-dimensional hypergroup @xmath15 . defining @xmath16 this",
    "then gives with the two obvious operator choices @xmath17",
    "( @xmath18 and @xmath19 ) .",
    "both choices have their problems : operator ( a ) needs a non - zero momentum @xmath20 , while operator ( b ) requires a delicate subtraction between two terms similar in magnitude .",
    "the relation to @xmath6 is given by @xmath21 with @xmath22 denoting the renormalised operator .",
    "we shall not dwell here on details of the numerical calculations , @xcite , but just mention that the method we use to extract matrix elements from the lattice is standard , namely evaluating the ratio of @xmath23-point to @xmath24-point nucleon correlation functions .",
    "the @xmath23-point function is easy to calculate : we simply multiply the @xmath24-point function with the appropriate gluon operator for every configuration .",
    "this sits at time @xmath25 between the baryon  anti - baryon ( placed at @xmath26 and @xmath27 respectively ) . @xmath25 and @xmath28 are ( hopefully ) large enough , @xmath29 say , so that all the excited nucleon states have died out .",
    "we found it expedient to sum over all allowed values of @xmath25 .",
    "thus we consider @xmath30 we work with quenched wilson fermions at @xmath31 and @xmath32 on a @xmath33 lattice with antiperiodic time boundary conditions for the fermion .",
    "we have generated o(5000 ) sources ( on @xmath34@xmath35 configurations with jacobi smeared source / sink ) .",
    "we shall first consider @xmath36 . in fig .  [ re2 ]    = 8.15 cm    [ re2 ]",
    "we show @xmath37 for this operator .",
    "we fixed @xmath38 and hope to see a signal after @xmath39 ( before this there is not enough time to insert the operator ) and about @xmath40 ( after this the nucleon mixes with its parity partner ) .",
    "indeed a signal is seen .",
    "a similar picture holds for @xmath41 as shown in fig .",
    "[ rb2 ] .",
    "= 8.15 cm    [ rb2 ]    considering @xmath42 directly is given in fig .",
    "[ rx1bg ] .",
    "= 8.15 cm    [ rx1bg ]    as expected there is a large cancellation between the chromo - electric and -magnetic pieces . while the error bars are uncomfortably large , there does seem to be a signal",
    "this is worse using @xmath43 ; indeed the best we can say is that it is not inconsistent with @xmath42 .",
    "as gluon operators are singlets , they can mix with the quark singlet .",
    "but there exists a combination of singlet operators with vanishing anomalous dimension .",
    "( this is due to the conservation of the energy - momentum tensor . )",
    "we may estimate the renormalisation factor @xmath44 :    * using first order perturbation theory .",
    "we find @xcite @xmath45 .",
    "we shall use this in fig .",
    "[ x1bg ] . * non - perturbatively . in @xcite",
    "a proposal was made to determine @xmath46 from mc simulations .",
    "we have looked at @xmath47 for about @xmath48 gauge fixed configurations .",
    "huge noise is present but @xmath44 is consistent with @xmath0 .",
    "extracting @xmath49 from @xmath50 , we may now attempt a chiral extrapolation .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ x1bg ] .",
    "= 8.15 cm    [ x1bg ]    while the quality of the fit is not so good , the result is at least encouraging @xmath51 .",
    "this is at least not inconsistent with the expectations previously discussed .",
    "of course our ultimate aim is to attempt a mass splitting of the nucleon , in the same spirit as @xcite .",
    "this seems a difficult goal with our present method : probably a two order of magnitude improvement in statistics is required .",
    "the numerical calculations were performed on the ape ( quadrics qh2 ) at desy - zeuthen with some of the earlier computations on the bielefeld university ape .",
