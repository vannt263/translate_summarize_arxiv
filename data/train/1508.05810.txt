    "this paper presents a relativistic theory of gravitation that is developed by considering the concrete physical mechanisms responsible for time dilation and spatial contraction .",
    "the theory is developed for the central gravitational field of a non spinning mass .",
    "the mathematical framework is formulated from thought experiments in which the inverse square acceleration of newtonian gravitation and the principles of relativity are combined .",
    "the euler lagrange equations based on the resulting lagrangian for extremal proper time are shown to be equivalent to the geodesic equations of general relativity with the schwarzschild metric . however , unlike general relativity this theory is nonsingular at the schwarzschild radius and therefore uniquely provides a description of particle dynamics there .",
    "the schwarzschild metric of general relativity is shown to be an first order approximation to the lagrangian developed here .",
    "relativistic principles , terms , and concepts used herein are given below with comments and references where appropriate .",
    "since numerous references exist in both classical and modern publications for these only a sampling is provided where indicated .",
    "they are identified here as essential logical building blocks of the sections that follow .",
    "* the principle of equivalence - the original version of this principle given by einstein @xcite equated gravitational and inertial masses . since that time a number of logically related statements of equivalence have appeared @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite . for purposes of this paper we will take the meaning of this principle to include the equivalence of gravitational and inertial masses , independent of their nature and we also utilize the `` strong '' version of equivalence @xcite stating that a laboratory that is freely falling in a gravitational field is equivalent to one in an inertial , or lorentz frame . a mental tool used to conduct thought experiments will be an elevator , an einstein elevator acted on only by gravitational forces and in free fall .",
    "this principle therefore states that results of experiments conducted entirely within the elevator be identical to those conducted in an unaccelerated frame of reference - ignoring tidal effects caused by spatial gradients of the gravitational field .",
    "the lorentz transformations @xcite will be applicable within this elevator . * the mass - energy equivalence of special relativity - will be used to associate a mass of an object to its total energy .",
    "objects may be photons . *",
    "the weak field approximation - a parameter that appears in the following theory as well as in general relativity is chosen to quantitatively establish the gravitational field ",
    "strength. at this point it is easiest to extract this parameter from the schwarzschild metric , which in polar coordinates is given by @xcite @xcite : + @xmath1 + here , @xmath2 is the space - time interval , @xmath3 is the radial coordinate of a test mass in a spherical coordinate system centered on a mass @xmath4 , @xmath5 its differential , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the angular coordinate differentials , @xmath8 is the schwarzschild radius calculated for a mass m as @xmath9 , @xmath10 is the gravitational constant , and @xmath11 is the speed of light . within general relativity",
    "the variation of the integral of @xmath12 over a path length is minimized , or in other words particles follow geodesic paths in a warped space - time .",
    "the effects of space - time warping , and therefore observable differences in predictions in general relativity and newtonian gravitational theories are quantified by the ratio @xmath13 in the scwarzschild metric above .",
    "the weak field limit is defined here as the regime where @xmath14 . for use later in this paper , the gravitational radius will be defined as one half the scwarzschild radius , and the weak field definition applies as well to this radius .",
    "original and subsequent experimental tests of general relativity using the sun as the central gravitational body ( light deflection , orbital perturbations , red shifting ) are necessarily in the weak field regime as defined above .",
    "consider gravitational deflection of light passing the sun s limb ; since the physical radius of the sun is on the order of 700,000 km , and the calculated schwarzschild radius approximately 3 km , the ratio of @xmath13 is on the order of @xmath15 , or about 4 parts per million .",
    "this ratio s value is even smaller for planetary distances and confirmations based on those ( e.g. , perihelion advance of mercury ) . *",
    "newtonian gravitation - this law describes gravitational effects as a radial force ( no azimuthal component ) that varies inversely with the square of the distance from a mass @xmath4 to a test mass @xmath16 which is assumed small relative to @xmath4 .",
    "while the radial - only nature of this law is retained here , it will be viewed as an inverse - square _ acceleration law _",
    ", applying to any mass regardless of its type .",
    "* paths of extremal proper time - in this paper , this principle refers to requiring particles in a gravitational field to follow paths resulting in variationally stationary , or extremal proper time .",
    "this principle is analogous to seeking geodesic paths in space time @xcite .",
    "however we wish to utilize this principle a - priori and independently of any other theory . + non relativistic physics provides examples of such a principle including fermat s least time description of photon propagation as well as the least action formulation by maupertuis @xcite .",
    "+ that paths are those of extremal time may also be seen from maupertuis s least action principle in another , semi - classical way .",
    "seeking paths that minimize the action given by : + @xmath17 + where @xmath18 refers to the form of variation of the integral where the endpoints may also vary , @xmath19 the particle s momentum , and @xmath20 a generalized coordinate .",
    "if we associate a quantum mechanical wavelength @xmath21 with this particle according to @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is plank s constant , substitution into the equation above results in ( ignoring the multiplicative constant @xmath23 since it does not affect the final result of the variation ) : + @xmath24 + the reciprocal of @xmath21 may be viewed as the number of oscillations , or cycles of time the particle experiences , it s proper time , per unit of @xmath20 .",
    "the equation above then yields paths of stationary proper time . + all of these results may be made relativistic by the principle of equivalence . by this principle",
    "an observer in an accelerating frame will identify the same particle path as a ( proper ) elapsed time extremal as would an observer in a non - accelerating frame .",
    "the development of the theory presented here emphasizes visualization of physical processes through the use of thought experiments .",
    "transformations are derived relating time and spatial coordinates in a non accelerating reference frame @xmath25 to those in a freely falling frame of reference @xmath26 . a third frame",
    "is then introduced , @xmath27 which is in uniform motion with respect to @xmath26 .",
    "the lorentz transformation is utilized to transform time and spatial coordinates from @xmath26 to @xmath27 , and then ultimately to @xmath25 .",
    "these result are then used to produce an expression for an increment of time in the accelerating and moving frame @xmath28 which becomes the lagrangian for arriving at paths of stationary proper time generated by :    @xmath29    it is then shown that this lagrangian reduces to eq.([schwarzschild_metric ] ) , the schwarzschild metric in the weak field limit and therefore provides an equivalent description of gravitation as general relativity in this regime .",
    "it is further shown that this lagrangian provides non - singular solutions at the scnwarzschild radius as well as over all radii ( except at the coordinate origin ) .",
    "in special relativity one may generate time and spatial transformations between a reference and uniformly moving frame by considering a michaelson interferometer with one arm oriented parallel to the velocity vector and the other arm oriented 90 degrees from that .",
    "in such an approach the paths light follows along these two arms are calculated from the perspective of the stationary frame of reference , and then by utilizing the principles of relativity and the postulate of the constancy of the speed of light one obtains both the temporal and spatial transformations .    at first",
    "it would appear this approach would be suitable for developing transformations between a non accelerating and an accelerating frame of reference .",
    "however an accurate description of the path light in a gravitational field , particularly a path involving both radial and transverse motion is indeed a major goal of this paper .",
    "a different approach will therefore be taken based on photons in free fall as presented below .",
    "we will make use of an einstein elevator which is in free fall in a gravitational field , i.e. the only force acting on this elevator and its contents is gravitation .",
    "an observer inside this elevator uses an atomic clock to measure time in his frame of reference which we will designate as @xmath26 . while an atomic clock is clearly only one possible way to measure time , it is based on fundamental processes and so will be considered a manifestation of time itself .    as observed from @xmath25 ,",
    "@xmath26 is accelerating in the radial direction only toward the center of mass of @xmath4 as are photons within @xmath26 .",
    "a test mass @xmath16 will undergo a change in energy @xmath30 due to an incremental change in radius @xmath5 according to :    @xmath31    where @xmath10 is the gravitational constant , @xmath3 is the radial coordinate of the test mass in a spherical coordinate system centered on the center of mass of @xmath4 .",
    "it is assumed that @xmath16@xmath32@xmath4 .",
    "we may associate a mass with a photon emitted by the atomic clock according to einstein s mass - energy equivalence @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the photon energy , and @xmath11 is the speed of light . writing the photon energy as the sum of its energy at @xmath35 and its potential energy at a finite @xmath3 , we have for its mass :    @xmath36    where @xmath37 is the photon frequency at @xmath35 , and @xmath23 is plank s constant .",
    "substitution of this result into eq .",
    "( [ potential ] ) gives : @xmath38 @xmath39    defining the gravitational radius @xmath40 and using the condition that @xmath41 at @xmath35 , we have for @xmath42 :    @xmath43 since the energy of the photon is the sum of it s energy at @xmath35 and @xmath42 , and since it is also given by @xmath44 , we have :    @xmath45    therefore :    @xmath46    this expression indicates the emission frequency @xmath47 at a radial coordinate of @xmath3 is lower than when at @xmath35 , and has a value of zero at @xmath48 .",
    "this lowering of frequency is otherwise known as gravitational red shifting .",
    "an observer in @xmath25 may determine the frequency of these photons as the number of wave crests @xmath49 passing a fixed location per unit of time .",
    "( [ red_shift ] ) above above he notices that an observer in @xmath26 will observe a reduced number of crests in that same unit of his time owing to its reduced frequency .",
    "however the principle of equivalence requires observers in @xmath26 measure the same frequency as in @xmath25 .",
    "therefore the rate of time in @xmath26 must have changed according to :    @xmath50    @xmath51    this is the transformation for a time differential between @xmath26 and @xmath25 .",
    "one of the teachings of special relativity is that there is a time dilation effect due to uniform motion on synchronization of spatially separated clocks .",
    "this effect is sometimes known as the relativity of simultaneity .",
    "we now evaluate whether this mechanism results in a significant time dilation effect in a free - falling frame .",
    "assume that spatially separated clocks in @xmath26 are synchronized by the transmission of light pulses from a single clock designated as the master clock .",
    "upon reception of these timing pulses each of the other clocks within @xmath26 adjusts their clocks to the previously agreed to time of transmission of these pulses after accounting for their respective propagation delays . as seen from @xmath25 ,",
    "however the reception time of a reference pulse is not only determined by the propagation time , but also by an additional effect due to acceleration .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ spatialtime ] .",
    "the ( a ) portion of this figure illustrates how a timing pulse is transmitted at time @xmath52 by the master clock located at a radial coordinate @xmath3 , to a remote clock located at a radial coordinate of @xmath53 .",
    "the ( b ) portion of this figure shows that at the time the pulse is received , @xmath54 the remote clock s radial position has decreased by @xmath55 due to acceleration , @xmath56 .",
    "this causes the timing pulse to be received earlier than by considering the propagation time alone . since in time",
    "@xmath57 light has propagated a distance of @xmath58 , we have :    @xmath59    @xmath60    the solution for @xmath54 is given by :    @xmath61             \\label{time received}\\ ] ]    we may define the factor describing the reduction in arrival time compared with the propagation time alone as @xmath62    expanding the radical term in the eq.([time received ] ) we have : @xmath63\\ ] ] for a positive @xmath64 as shown in the figure above we may choose the @xmath65 sign in the expanded radical , and retaining to second order : @xmath66    substituting @xmath67 , and @xmath40 we have :    @xmath68    the ( c ) portion of the above figure shows a similar effect for the clock located at @xmath69 . the same analysis",
    "as the above shows this clock is synchronized to a time that is greater than that in the absence of acceleration by the factor @xmath70 that is given by :    @xmath71    and so we see that the spatial ( radial ) dependence in time due to synchronization effects is second order in @xmath64 , and so can be ignored compared with the first order time dilation effect represented by eq .",
    "( [ ttransform ] ) .",
    "spatial dependence of synchronization in the angular ( orthogonal ) coordinates are zero since acceleration is zero there .",
    "as before we will utilize a spherical coordinate system centered on the center of mass of @xmath4 .",
    "we once again consider a closed elevator located at a radial coordinate @xmath3 whose acceleration ( and that of its contents ) toward the the origin is given by @xmath67 .",
    "the effect of this acceleration on a measurement of distance is presented below .",
    "consider a thought experiment in which an observer located within an elevator measures the speed of light with a light source and reflecting mirror oriented in the radial direction as shown in figure [ transforms ] .",
    "he measures the distance between the source and mirror @xmath72 using a metering rod provided by an observer in @xmath25 who measured its length prior to acceleration as @xmath73 .",
    "the measurement is performed by directing a light pulse from a source toward a mirror as shown in figure [ transforms]a .",
    "as observed from @xmath25 the mirror translates a distance s1 during the travel time of the light pulse that is given approximately by @xmath74 .",
    "the pulse is reflected and returns to the source s location by which time it has translated a total distance of s2 ( figure [ transforms ] b and c ) .",
    "we have for the total upward and downward distances traveled by the light pulse given respectively by : @xmath75    @xmath76 @xmath77+\\frac{a}{2 } \\left(\\frac{2l}{c}\\right)^2\\ ] ] @xmath78    if the time required for light to travel @xmath79 is @xmath80 we have in frames @xmath25 and @xmath26 : @xmath81}{\\delta t}=\\frac{2l^\\prime}{{\\delta t}^\\prime}\\ ] ]    substituting the relationship between time increments from eq ( [ ttransform ] ) , @xmath67 , and @xmath40 and then solving the above equation for @xmath82 , the length of a metering rod in @xmath26 is :    @xmath83    we see again that the effect of acceleration on the measurement of a standard rigid rod of length @xmath72 is second order .",
    "therefore this second order factor can be ignored .",
    "this is especially true since a standard of length should be `` small '' so as to afford precision in the measurement of lengths .",
    "the expression above therefore reduces to :    @xmath84    since radial distance , as well as an incremement of radial distance is the number of standard metering rods given by @xmath72 , we have that : @xmath85    this expression therefore is the desired transformation for radial differentials between frames @xmath25 and@xmath26 .",
    "the same methodology applied to dimensions orthogonal to @xmath3 , i.e. @xmath86 and @xmath87 , where acceleration is assumed to be zero , and the principle of relativity yields :    @xmath88      the previous sections have addressed time and spatial transformations due to gravitational acceleration only .",
    "the effects of uniform motion will now be added .",
    "we do so by introducing the frame of reference @xmath27 which is also in free fall and in uniform motion with respect to @xmath26 with velocity @xmath89 .",
    "since frame @xmath26 is stationary with respect to @xmath25 , @xmath89 = @xmath90 .    while the effects of uniform motion ( special relativity ) could be introduced from first principles , it is more efficient to utilize the lorentz transformations which must be valid in @xmath26 according to the equivalence principle .",

    "from the preceding sections , paths resulting in stationary proper time are given by :    @xmath103    differential equations of motion may therefore be obtained by using eq.([dt_double_prime ] ) as a lagrangian with substitution into the euler lagrange equation , or :    @xmath104 } ^\\frac{1}{2}\\ ] ]    with :    @xmath105 where @xmath20 is a generalized coordinate , and dot refers to time differentiation .",
    "once again it is important to recall the unit analysis results presented in the radial transformation section regarding the true units of the denominator in this expression .",
    "examples of the resulting differential equations are not provided here due to space limitations and mathematical complexity , however limiting cases are compared with general relativity in the following section .",
    "as shown previously the lagrangian of eq .",
    "( [ lagrangian ] ) provides equations of motion resulting from this theory .",
    "we will show that the square of this lagrangian provides the same equations of motion .",
    "we will then show that this squared form of the lagrangian reduces to the schwarzschild radius in the weak field limit .",
    "recall that the frames of reference @xmath26 and @xmath27 are both in free fall with respect to @xmath25 , and that @xmath27 is in uniform motion with respect to @xmath26 with velocity @xmath89 .",
