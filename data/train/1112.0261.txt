    "discovery of superconductivity in iron pnictide materials@xcite spurred intense experimental and theoretical effort to unravel the underlying physics of these compounds .",
    "the presence of fe@xmath2  tetrahedra is universal in pnictide compounds , where iron atoms are arranged in a square planar lattice and tetrahedrally coordinated by pnictogen atoms .",
    "a common dynamic feature in pnictide families is a structural phase transition concomitant or in close vicinity with a transition to long range antiferromagnetic ( afm ) order upon cooling@xcite .",
    "this transition is suppressed with hole@xcite , electron@xcite , or isoelectronic doping@xcite , eventually giving way to superconductivity .    at room temperature ,",
    "the pnictide parent compound bafe@xmath0as@xmath0  is a tetragonal ( @xmath3 ) paramagnet . at t @xmath4 140 k@xcite ,",
    "bafe@xmath0as@xmath0  undergoes a structural transition to orthorhombic ( @xmath5 ) symmetry , and magnetically orders with spins afm along the @xmath6-axis in the iron plane , ferromagnetic along the @xmath7-axis , and afm between the iron layers with an ordered moment of 0.87(3 ) @xmath8  per fe site@xcite .",
    "the measured moment is lower than that predicted by dft calculations@xcite . while the structural distortion in the pnictides is small , the magnetic exchange anisotropy is very large when the exchange constants are calculated from an anisotropic heisenberg model calculation which includes damping with very small interlayer magnetic coupling@xcite .    for afm",
    "ordering to occur , the high temperature tetragonal symmetry of bafe@xmath0as@xmath0  must be broken to allow for the spin anisotropy , making the lattice distortion from tetragonal to orthorhombic symmetry a requirement for afm ordering .",
    "the precise mechanism of the lattice distortion is a matter of considerable debate @xcite .",
    "early theoretical work shows that the lattice distortion@xcite in the oxyarsenide lafeaso  is the manifestation of relieved magnetic frustrations as the afm ordering results in different occupancy for the @xmath9 , @xmath10  orbitals which breaks the tetragonal symmetry@xcite .",
    "however , the exchange constants determined from the spin wave dispersion are not consistent with this idea@xcite .",
    "another explanation for the coupling of the transitional behaviors is that of ferro - orbital ordering .",
    "a minimal approach applying the hartree - fock approximation to a two orbital model shows that afm ordering arises as a consequence of ferro - orbital ordering , which then results in a lattice distortion@xcite .",
    "three- and five - orbital models suggest that orbital degrees of freedom are strongly coupled to magnetic ordering , with @xmath9  and @xmath10  susceptible to orbital ordering , but that the orbital magnetization is much greater for the @xmath10  orbital , resulting in a reduction of the orbital hybridization between the @xmath9  and @xmath10  orbitals@xcite .",
    "other reports suggest that orbital ordering is able to spontaneously break the @xmath11 symmetry locally without fermi surface nesting or magnetic frustrations@xcite .",
    "softening of the shear elastic constant in ba(fe@xmath12co@xmath13)@xmath0as@xmath0  has been noted in several works including resonant ultrasound spectroscopy on bafe@xmath0as@xmath0  and ba(fe@xmath14co@xmath15)@xmath0as@xmath0,@xcite and ultrasonic pulse echo measurements on undoped , underdoped@xcite , and optimally doped ba(fe@xmath12co@xmath13)@xmath0as@xmath0@xcite .",
    "the measurements showed a softening of the @xmath16 mode near the structural or superconducting transition in all compounds where measurement was nt precluded by sample instability against the mounting apparatus .",
    "the @xmath16 mode is responsible for structural phase transitions of type which serve to lower crystalline symmetry from tetragonal to orthorhombic@xcite , so this observation is expected , although in the presented works several additional mechanisms for the phase transition are proffered .",
    "resonant ultrasound spectroscopy measurements performed on bafe@xmath0as@xmath0  show a strong softening of the shear elastic constant , which is used to conclude that there is general lattice softening through the structural transition driven by renormalization of the shear elastic constant by nematic fluctuations@xcite . in this context , the softening of the lattice is a secondary effect , with electronic degrees of freedom taking precedence over elastic , and the structural transition then a mere consequence of the magnetic ordering . in the work conducted in ultrasonic pulse echo spectroscopy , the softening minima tracks with the superconducting temperature under application of a magnetic field@xcite , and other elastic constants show almost imperceptible deviations from monotonic behavior in close proximity to the superconducting transition temperature@xcite .",
    "one hypothesis derived from these experiments is the phase transition is driven by ferro - orbital ordering , suggestive of strong lattice coupling and orbital fluctuations@xcite , while another concludes that the softening is induced by the coupling of the degenerate electronic orbitals to the elastic strain@xcite .",
    "there is some disagreement between the reports on the elastic constant behavior at low temperature . upon cooling below the structural or superconducting temperature ,",
    "some reports show the value of @xmath16 recovering some 10% of the room temperature value at low temperature for the undoped and superconducting samples@xcite , while other reports on the underdoped show no further observed softening below the structural transition temperature@xcite .",
    "experimental studies on the transverse acoustic ( ta ) modes of the related compound cafe@xmath0as@xmath0  shows a softening of the transverse acoustic mode at the zone boundary for a ta [ 110 ] mode , and a mid - zone point at ta [ 100 ] at the magneto - structural transition when measuring accompanied by phonon broadening@xcite .",
    "further , calculation shows that phonons are very sensitive to the structural details of the fe@xmath2  layers , with phonon modes that distort the tetrahedra having substantial impact on the electronic density of states close to @xmath17@xcite .",
    "anomalous phonon behavior is observed in raman spectroscopy , with the @xmath18 in - plane phonon mode split in bafe@xmath0as@xmath0@xcite , which is linked to strong spin - phonon coupling .",
    "this @xmath18 mode is a doubly - degenerate mode impacting fe and as , and the contention is that the split is too large to be accounted for by the orthorhombic distortion and instead is indicative of spin - phonon coupling .",
    "measurements of phonon behavior conducted with inelastic x - ray spectroscopy are replicated well by theory when magnetism is explicitly taken into account@xcite , indicating the presence of spin - phonon coupling .",
    "the degree of hybridization between the as-@xmath19 and fe-@xmath20 states is shown to have strong impacts on the fe@xmath21 spin state@xcite , and to influence the fe - as phonon modes@xcite .",
    "further , the dependence of the superconducting critical temperature@xcite and magnetic moment@xcite of pnictide materials as a function of fe - as layer separation is well established .",
    "the preceding discussion sets forth a clear need to understand the specifics of the structural transition as they relate to the elastic degrees , magnetic , and orbital degrees of freedom .",
    "here we report the results of inelastic x - ray spectroscopy ( ixs ) measurements on single crystals of bafe@xmath0as@xmath0  as a function of temperature .",
    "since the acoustic phonon frequency goes as the square root of the elastic constant , we expect a softening of the low - energy acoustic phonon modes of bafe@xmath0as@xmath0  when passing through the structural transition temperature .",
    "phonon calculations predict a linear dispersion in the low - energy , long wavelength regime@xcite .",
    "the acoustic phonon modes in bafe@xmath0as@xmath0  can be characterized with energy transfers of less than 10 mev , and the small and constant momentum resolution offered by ixs allows precise measurements of the phonon dispersion as a function of temperature .",
    "the previous measurements on the shear elastic constant@xcite provide information only at the zone center ( @xmath22 point , @xmath23 = 0 ) , so the ixs measurements described in this work provide additional information on the low - energy lattice dynamics in the bafe@xmath0as@xmath0  system .",
    "we investigated the behavior of the transverse acoustic phonon mode in bafe@xmath0as@xmath0  near the ( 2,2,0)@xmath24 position , which is the [ 110 ] mode in the reduced scheme .",
    "the orthorhombic notation and the @xmath5 symmetry are used throughout this report .",
    "the measurements were made using the herix instrument on beamline 3-id of the advanced photon source at argonne national laboratory@xcite .",
    "the herix instrument is on an insertion device beamline with a six - bounce monochromator setup providing an incident energy of 21.657 kev , and a resolution of 2.3 mev at the elastic line .",
    "our sample was a single crystal of bafe@xmath0as@xmath0  measuring 1 mm x 2 mm x 60 @xmath25 m , grown using a self - flux method@xcite .",
    "calculated optimal thickness for a transmission mode geometry for an incident energy of 21.657 kev was 55 @xmath25 m .",
    "the crystal was oriented in transmission mode with ( 2 , 2 , 0 ) and ( 1 , 1 , 3 ) in the scattering plane .",
    "this alignment allows measurement of the phonons in the basal plane of the form @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the reciprocal lattice vector of the bragg peak in the @xmath28 plane , and @xmath23 the inelastic momentum transfer . for temperature dependent studies ,",
    "the crystal samples were mounted on copper holders with a small amount of varnish , and the copper holders were attached to the cold finger of a closed cycle cryostat sealed by a beryllium dome .",
    "the beam size on sample was 50 @xmath25 m by 350 @xmath25 m .",
    "only one analyzer - detector pair was used for these measurements , and an analyzer mask was used to limit bragg contamination for low @xmath23 measurements .",
    "the mask size was 4 cm by 4 cm at @xmath29 , and 1 cm by 1 cm for all @xmath30 .",
    "the stokes and anti - stokes profiles were measured in most cases , but at points where an anti - stokes contribution to the phonon spectra was dynamically limited , a contribution from elastic scattering was ensured by transversely scanning the crystal space at zero energy transfer .",
    "all data were normalized to the incident monitor count , a low efficiency ion chamber .    for all temperatures ,",

    "the only mode investigated in this work was the low energy transverse acoustic mode , and there was only a local softening of the mode - the traditional linear dispersion is recovered by @xmath43 in all temperature cases ( four temperature cases shown in fig . [ fig : loq_vs_300 ] ) .",
    "this result is not captured in published dft - gga calculations reviewed in preparation of this manuscript .",
    "the softening of the low energy transverse acoustic mode observed by ixs is expected in the context of soft mode transitions , as the decrease in energy of the long wavelength phonons is always seen in structural phase transitions of the type observed here@xcite .",
    "but it has a few possible interpretations for microscopic mechanism .",
    "the first interpretation invokes fermi surface nesting , which results in a regime of enhanced electron - phonon coupling .",
    "the fermi surface structure of pnictides is well established to consist of hole pockets centered at the zone center , and electron pockets at the zone boundary@xcite , with electron or hole doping serving to change the levels of the two pockets relative to one another@xcite .",
    "the softening of the ta phonon has a natural explanation in two - dimensional fermi surface nesting giving rise to a kohn anomaly , where strong quasiparticle excitations below @xmath44k@xmath45  result in enhanced electron - phonon coupling @xcite .",
    "indeed we observe softening from the zone center to a maximal phonon softening below @xmath23 = 0.1 , which is consistent with the value of 2k@xmath45  = 0.1 for the inner hole pocket in bafe@xmath0as@xmath0@xcite .    in a work on cafe@xmath0as@xmath0 ,",
    "a series of line broadenings is observed@xcite , though this is not used to draw the conclusion of kohn anomalies , but may be related to the work here .",
    "however , possible broadening of the phonons for the bafe@xmath0as@xmath0  compound studied here is too small to be fully resolved by the current technique .",
    "line broadenings of this type have been observed in studies of elemental superconductors , where the phonon anomalies were fully resolved only when using high resolution spin - echo neutron spectroscopy@xcite . in order to confirm the presence of phonon broadening and/or a kohn anomaly in bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 , a careful analysis of the phonon lineshape using a higher energy resolution",
    "is required .",
    "note also that there is some softening tendency at temperatures much below @xmath46 .",
    "the @xmath23 range of this low temperature softening is distinct from the softening at @xmath46 ; below @xmath47 at low temperatures , whereas softening is observed below @xmath48 near @xmath46 .",
    "it appears that this softening has a different origin , and either one could be related to a kohn anomaly .",
    "a second interpretation is to consider the phonon softening in the context of coupling between the low energy acoustic mode and the orbital fluctuations . in this scenario ,",
    "softening of the shear mode causes in - plane shifting of the iron atoms , impacting the interatomic distances along the fe@xmath2  layer .",
    "as these atoms shift their positions , the tetragonal orbital degeneracy between the @xmath9  and @xmath10  orbitals is broken , allowing the manifestation of magnetic order . while the orthorhombic structural distortion is small ( of order 0.3% , with the change in the iron square lattice 2.8   on a side to a rectangle 2.79/2.81  ) , and several works show that there is a strong dependence of the electronic structure on small details of the lattice , in particular the height of the pnictogen atom above the iron plane@xcite .",
    "additionally , it has been shown that there is an enhancement of electron - boson coupling arising from orbital anisotropy@xcite , behavior which is in contrast to lower mean field values for the estimate of such couplings@xcite .",
    "further , the pnictide systems are very close to the stoner criticality , where even a small lattice distortion can have a large consequence to the magnetism in the system@xcite .",
    "the proposed mechanism indicates that other phonon modes may be involved in the structural transition via a similar softening behavior@xcite .",
    "modes that directly influence the dynamics of the feas@xmath49 tetrahedra are being examined .",
    "further , a coupling of acoustic and optical modes as is seen in other structural phase transitions@xcite is not ruled out , and requires further examination .",
    "we have investigated the behavior of the transverse acoustic phonon in bafe@xmath0as@xmath0  using ixs , and found that this phonon mode softens as a function of temperature , with a maximal softening near @xmath23 = 0.1 .",
    "the energy of the phonon mode drops well below that observed at room temperature , reaching a minimum near the structural phase transition temperature before recovering almost fully .",
    "this observation is explained in terms of electron - phonon coupling resulting in a lifting of the orbital degeneracy in the paramagnetic tetragonal state , allowing full manifestation of the afm order .",
