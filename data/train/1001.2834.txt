    "the xenon10 detector , a two - phase time projection chamber ( tpc ) containing 25 kg of pure liquid xenon ( lxe ) , was built and operated as the first practical prototype of the xenon dark matter search program  @xcite .",
    "the r&d phase which culminated with the xenon10 tpc , involved several smaller size detectors , dedicated to study many of the properties and performance characteristics of a two - phase tpc in the energy regime relevant to the direct detection of dark matter particles scattering off xe nuclei .",
    "the most important results obtained with these prototypes are published  @xcite .    in addition , several technical developments carried out during this phase played an important role in establishing the feasibility of the xenon approach for dark matter detection . among these , two are particularly important : a ) the development by hamamatsu photonics of compact metal channel photomultipliers ( pmts ) for the detection of the lxe scintillation light , with continuous improvement in quantum efficiency and radio - purity  @xcite ; b ) the development of a pulse tube refrigerator ( ptr ) optimized for lxe temperature  @xcite to achieve the required long - term stability of a cryogenics detector filled with a large lxe volume .",
    "the goal of the xenon10 experiment was to demonstrate the achievable energy threshold , background rejection power and operation stability of a two - phase tpc at the 10 kg fiducial mass scale , prior to the realization of a 100  kg scale detector , originally proposed as unit module for a ton scale xenon dark matter search .",
    "the fast - paced r&d effort did not emphasize materials radio - purity and xenon10 was built with largely off - the - shelf components , not screened or selected to minimize backgrounds .",
    "the tpc and its associated cryogenics , purification and data acquisition ( daq ) systems were developed and tested at the nevis laboratories of columbia university prior to installation at the italian gran sasso underground laboratory ( lngs )  @xcite .",
    "the commissioning of the xenon10 detector at lngs started in april 2006 . following the completion of the shield system , source calibration and background data were acquired for several months , in stable conditions .",
    "a blind analysis of 58.4 live days of data , acquired between october 6 , 2006 and february 14 , 2007 , and using a fiducial mass of 5.4 kg , excluded previously unexplored parameter space , setting improved upper limits on both spin - independent  @xcite and spin - dependent  @xcite cross - section for dark matter scattering off nucleons .",
    "the xenon10 results , and the unusually fast time scale in which they were achieved , validated the scientific reach of a position sensitive , homogeneous and self - triggered lxetpc for dark matter direct detection .",
    "new and improved lxe dark matter detectors , with a target mass at the 100 kg scale , are currently in operation  @xcite or under construction  @xcite .",
    "they promise to advance the field with significant improvement in sensitivity over the next few years . in this paper",
    "we wish to summarize the development and performance of the xenon10 detector and associated systems .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following . in section 2",
    "we describe the design of the detector , cryogenics , purification and slow - control systems , followed by a description of the shield and data acquisition systems . in section 3",
    "we discuss the data processing , the algorithms and cuts used to infer the parameters relevant for a dark matter search . in section 4",
    ", we present results from gamma and neutron calibration of the xenon10 tpc . finally in section 5 , details on the analysis of xenon10 data used for the published dark matter search results",
    "are discussed .",
    "the appendix to the paper deals with a summary of the sources of backgrounds in the xenon10 experiment , in comparison with monte carlo predictions .",
    "the principle of operation of the xenon10 two - phase ( liquid - gas ) time projection chamber ( tpc ) is shown schematically in fig .  [",
    "fig : tpccartoon ] . the energy deposited by a particle interaction within the active lxe volume",
    "is detected by the simultaneous measurement of ionization electrons and of primary scintillation photons ( @xmath1 ) , with a wavelength of 178 nm  @xcite , produced by the de - excitation to the ground state of excited diatomic xe molecules ( xe@xmath2 )  @xcite .",
    "both direct excitation of atoms and electron - ion recombination lead to the formation of xe@xmath2 .    under the application of an electric field , @xmath3 , on the order of 1 kv / cm , the electrons which escape recombination with the parent positive ions , drift towards the liquid - gas interface with a velocity of about 2  mm/@xmath4s .",
    "once they reach the liquid surface , they are extracted into the gas , where a much stronger electric field , @xmath5 , accelerate them leading to secondary scintillation photons emission ( @xmath6 ) . in the xenon10 tpc , photomultiplier tubes ( pmts ) ,",
    "coupled directly to the sensitive liquid and gas regions , are used to detect both @xmath1 and @xmath6 signals .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the extraction yield is 100% for a field greater than 10 kv / cm .",
    "the number of secondary scintillation photons emitted in the gas is proportional to the number of electrons , and thus to the energy deposited in the liquid by the incoming particle .",
    "we refer to this signal as proportional scintillation signal .",
    "the following equation expresses the dependence of this signal on the operation conditions : @xmath7 here @xmath8 is the gas pressure and @xmath9 is the distance traveled by the electrons in the gas which largely determines the width of the @xmath6 pulse .",
    "the units for @xmath8 , @xmath5 and @xmath9 are bar , kv / cm and cm , respectively .",
    "@xmath10 is the number of electrons extracted from the liquid to the gas phase , @xmath11 is the number of proportional scintillation photons produced .",
    "@xmath12 ( the amplification factor ) and @xmath13 ( the threshold of the reduced field for proportional light production ) are experimentally determined values . for the case of xe ,",
    "the reported values for @xmath12 vary from 70 to 140 and @xmath13 values are between 0.8 and 1.0 kv / cm / bar  @xcite . the number of secondary photons generated by one drifting electron is sufficiently large to be detected by pmts , thus a two - phase detector is single - electron sensitive . in xenon10",
    "operating conditions , the values of @xmath8 , @xmath5 and @xmath9 were 2.1  bar , 12 kv / cm and 0.25  cm , respectively , yielding @xmath14100 photons per extracted electron .",
    "the different amplitude of the @xmath1 and @xmath6 signals associated with nuclear recoils , such as produced by wimp or neutron interactions , and with electron recoils , such as produced by background beta and gamma - rays , provides the basis for background discrimination in a two phase tpc such as xenon10 .",
    "since electron diffusion in lxe is small  @xcite , the proportional scintillation pulse is produced in a small volume with the same @xmath15 coordinates as the interaction site , allowing 2d localization .",
    "the @xmath16 coordinate is inferred from the drift time measurement , and the known electron drift velocity at the operating field . the tpc approach and the strong self - shielding property of lxe ( @xmath17  g / cc , z = 54 ) , make the xenon concept very powerful for background identification and rejection based on event topology : multiple scatter events from the overwhelming majority of gamma rays and from neutrons can be identified and rejected . the sensitive target can be  fiducialized \" to keep only the inner core free of background .",
    "the capability to accurately identify the 3d position on an event - by - event basis , also allows to correct the position dependence of both the direct and proportional scintillation signals , which in turn results in improved energy resolution . for a recent review of the properties of lxe and its response to radiation we refer to  @xcite .    ) and ionization electrons .",
    "the electrons drift under an electric field @xmath3 ( about 1 kv / cm ) until they are extracted from the liquid into the gas where they are accelerated by an electric field @xmath5 ( about 10 kv / cm ) producing proportional scintillation light ( @xmath6 ) . two arrays of photomultipliers , one in the liquid and one in the gas , detect simultaneously the @xmath1 and @xmath6 light signals.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    one of the challenges of a two - phase detector is to efficiently detect the small number of primary scintillation photons associated with the low energy events of interest in a dark matter search . because of the large refractive index of lxe @xcite and consequent total internal reflection at the liquid / gas interface , the presence of pmts at the bottom of the active drift volume is essential for efficient @xmath1 light collection .",
    "when the xenon concept was proposed , the development of pmts capable to operate directly in lxe had just began .",
    "the typical quantum efficiency of these early pmts at 178 nm was in the 10% range .",
    "to achieve high light collection of the @xmath1 signal and thus a low energy threshold required for a dark matter search , the baseline xenon detector design used a csi photocathode in place of a common cathode , and photomultipliers or other type of photodetectors in the gas region  @xcite . during the xenon r&d phase ,",
    "different photodetectors were tested@xcite and also charge - sensitive readouts based on the gas electron multiplier concept @xcite .",
    "the operation of csi photocathodes to detect the direct light in two phase prototypes confirmed @xcite the high qe first measured by the columbia group  @xcite . however , the complexity of operating a tpc under the very strong electric field required by the csi photocathode , while suppressing positive photon feedback , and the fast improvement of the performance of hamamatsu pmts for lxe operation , led us to abandon the csi photocathode approach . prior to adopting the hamamatsu one - inch square r8520 pmt for xenon10",

    "after measuring the gain for each channel , the amplification factor was equalized for all pmts , by adjusting the single pmt operating voltage .",
    "after the equalization , the gains were measured again and the resulting amplification factors were then fed to the xenon10 data analysis programs ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : data_processing ] ) and used as a conversion factor between the measured charge and the actual p.e . number . during normal operation",

    "the variation in pmt gain was @xmath31 .",
    "a reliable and stable cryogenics system was an essential requirement for the xenon10 experiment since both pmts gain and the proportional light yield vary with temperature .",
    "the xenon10 tpc vessel containing the 25 kg of lxe , made of stainless steel ( ss ) , was wrapped with aluminized mylar and surrounded by a vacuum cryostat , also made of ss , with typical vacuum in the mtorr range .",
    "the cryogenics system was based on a pulse tube refrigerator ( ptr ) with 100 w of cooling power at @xmath32 , with a 3.5 kw compressor .",
    "this type of cryocooler was developed specifically for xe liquefaction and re - condensation in the lxe scintillating calorimeter of the meg experiment  @xcite . to meet the ultra - high purity requirement for the xenon10 tpc ,",

    "the cooling power was sufficient to cool - down the detector , liquefy the gas and re - condense it .",
    "the desired temperature of the lxe was adjusted by a proportional - integral - derivative ( pid ) controlled heating element on the cold head of the ptr . due to the narrow temperature margin of less than 4 degrees between the liquid and solid phase of xe , temperature control during liquefaction",
    "is especially important .",
    "the typical operating temperature for xenon10 was -94@xmath24c with a stability better than 0.05@xmath24c .",
    "at this temperature the xe vapor pressure is @xmath142.1 atm . with this cryogenic system",
    "we have been able to achieve the level of long term stability required for a dark matter experiment .",
    "[ fig : press_stab ] shows the stability of the lxe temperature and corresponding xe vapor pressure during several months of continuous operation of xenon10 .",
    "the xenon10 cryogenics system included an independent ln@xmath33 system for emergency cooling .",
    "a pressure rise in the detector , above a set value , would automatically trigger a flow of ln@xmath33 through a cooling coil next to the ptr .",
    "the tpc pressure sensor and the solenoid valve control were powered by a dedicated uninterruptible power supply .",
    "the emergency cooling system would keep detector in a safe sate even in the extreme case of power failure and no access to the laboratory for more than 24 hours .",
    "we note that the large xe mass and high thermal capacity stabilizes the temperature and the pressure against abrupt changes .",
    "a rupture disk would finally burst if the absolute pressure in the detector would rise above 3.5 atm , to avoid damage to the pmts .",
    "the 15 cm electron drift gap in the xenon10 detector imposes ultra - high purity requirements on the lxe , in order to minimize charge loss by electron attachment to impurities molecules .",
    "the overall concentration of electronegative impurities ( oxygen equivalent ) must be well below 1 part per billion ( ppb ) .",
    "moreover , stable operation of the detector demands that this high purity be maintained over long periods of time . for detector and gas system ultra high vacuum materials and procedures were used , and for cleaning the xe gas a single purifier , a high temperature saes getter ( ps4-mt3-r ) @xcite was used .    however , the pmts limited the bake - out temperature of the detector to 70@xmath24c .",
    "in addition , lxe is a good solvent due to van der waals interactions with impurity molecules .",
    "thus , once pure xe is liquefied in the detector , the purity level can easily deteriorate .",
    "we therefore implemented a closed circulation system to continuously clean the gas through the getter , after initial liquefaction .",
    "such a system was successfully developed and tested at columbia on several smaller scale prototypes , prior to adapting it to xenon10 . for gas circulation a double - diaphragm pump ( knf - n143.12e ) @xcite was used . with a gas flow rate of 2.6 slpm , limited largely by the ptr cooling power , it would take about one month to reach the purity level required for negligible electron attenuation .",

    "@xmath54kr , which has a concentration about 10@xmath61 in kr , is a beta emitter that produces background in the lxe volume .",
    "xenon10 experiment requires the kr / xe contamination to be less than 10  ppb , which gives about 0.2  dru electron recoil background . to have this low kr / xe contamination level , the xe gas used for xenon10 was purified by the spectra gases company  @xcite in several passages through a large cryogenic distillation column . figure [ fig:85kr ]",
    "shows the energy spectra of the gamma and beta particles selected by the cuts .",
    "a total of 59 delayed - coincidence events were found in the entire wimp - search data .",
    "taking into account the detection efficiency of these events , we determine an @xmath54kr activity of ( 1.0@xmath290.06)mbq / kg , which translates into ( 5.0@xmath290.3)ppb of natural kr / xe contamination for typical atmospheric @xmath54kr abundances .",
    "this value is compatible with the value quoted by the xe gas supplier  @xcite and is sufficiently low for xenon10 .",
