    "we show that the quiescent x - ray spectrum is consistent with thermal emission from a pure h atmosphere on the ns @xcite , as is observed from this and other transient neutron stars in quiescence ( rutledge ) .",
    "as pointed out by bbr98 , for accretion rates 2 @xmath7yr , gravity stratifies metals in the ns atmosphere faster than they can be provided by accretion ( bildsten , salpeter , & wasserman ) , making a pure h atmosphere the appropriate description of the ns photosphere .",
    "callanan , filippenko & garcia @xcite recently showed that the optical counterpart to aql x-1 is a faint star near the previously mis - identified counterpart .",
    "this led to the counterpart s identification as a late type star ( spectral type k7 to m0 ) with a quiescent magnitude @xmath8 at a reddening of @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the orbital period has been well measured at @xmath10 via photometric observations both in outburst @xcite and quiescence @xcite .",
    "chevalier et al .",
    "@xcite estimated the distance to the binary as 2.5 kpc by assuming that the counterpart was a main sequence star of spectral type k7 , or roughly @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "however , the steady mass transfer and ellipsoidal variations @xcite require that the companion be roche - lobe filling , which gives @xmath13 , larger than chevalier et al.s estimate . if we use the de - reddened quiescent @xmath14 magnitude , we find that the distance to the binary is @xmath15 ( for spectral type k7 ) for @xmath16 . for a spectral type of m0 , we find @xmath17 for @xmath16 .",
    "thus , the clear minimum distance is 4 kpc , and the current uncertainties allow for a distance as large as 6.5 kpc .",
    "the type i bursts observed by czerny , czerny and grindlay @xcite had peak fluxes of @xmath18 , which gives the solar abundance eddington luminosity of @xmath19 at @xmath20 .",
    "we use 5 kpc as our fiducial distance .",
    "in   [ sec : anal ] , we describe the _ chandra _  observation and the constraints on variability during the observation . section [ sec : spectral ] shows our results on the spectral analysis and compares the _ chandra _  observations to previous quiescent observations .",

    "chandra _  @xcite using the acis - s3 detector in imaging mode , beginning nov 28 2000 , 10:51:35 ut , 7 days after the last 1-day detection ( 3@xmath1 , @xmath2120 mcrab ) with rxte / asm @xcite during the outburst .",
    "the x - ray source position was offset 4  from the optical - axis to mitigate pileup .",
    "the observation had a total exposure time of 6627.6 s over a period of 7307.6 sec ( 90% livetime ) , with time resolution of 0.44104 sec , and a 0.4 sec exposure .",
    "one x - ray source is detected in the field , at a position ( based on spacecraft pointing ) @xmath22 19h11m16.00s , @xmath2300d35m06.4s ( j2000 ) , with systematic errors dominating the uncertainty of position ( 1 ) , consistent with the known optical position of @xcite .",
    "the data were analyzed using the ciao v2.0 and xspec v11 @xcite .",
    "x - ray source counts were extracted within an area 10 pixels in radius about the source position , with a total of 1243 counts . at 0.075 counts",
    "/ frame , the pileup fraction is @xmath243% and can be neglected .",
    "background was taken from an annulus centered on the source position , with radii of 13 and 50 pixels .",
    "the expected number of background counts in the source region is 8 counts , which are neglected in our analyses .",
    "we binned the 0.2 - 8 kev counts into three light curves with three different time resolutions : @xmath25=0.44104 s , 10 s , and 100 s. in each case , the distribution of the number of counts per bin was consistent with a poissonian distribution , for an average number of counts per bin of ( 1237 counts)/(7308 s/@xmath25 ) .",
    "we also produced a power density spectrum ( pds ) , beginning with a lightcurve of all the counts in the source region with time resolution of 0.44104 sec , producing a 0.00014 - 1.13 hz pds .",
    "the pds is statistically consistent with a constant power at the poisson level , and shows no evidence of any excess variability .",
    "fitting the pds with a power - law component with a fixed slope ( @xmath26 ) above a ( fixed ) poisson level gives a 3@xmath1 upper - limit to the root - mean - square variability of @xmath2415% ( 0.0001 - 1 hz ; 0.2 - 8 kev ) .",
    "we thus find no evidence of intensity variability during the _ chandra _  observation .",
    "we binned the data into 13 energy bins ( 0.5 - 8.0 kev ) , and fit several single component spectral models ( powerlaw , h atmosphere , raymond - smith , multicolor disk or blackbody ) .",
    "we also include h atmosphere with a power - law , with two fixed values for the power - law slope ( @xmath27 , @xmath28 ) .",
    "galactic absorption ( = cm ) is initially left as a free parameter .",
    "the best - fit models were all statistically acceptable , and most gave column densities consistent with @xmath29 , and = 0.179 @xmath30 @xcite ; the parameters are given in table  [ tab : fits ] .",
    "the raymond - smith spectrum has a metallicity substantially below the solar value ( @xmath315 @xmath32 ) .",
    "in addition , bildsten and rutledge ( 2000 ) showed that the quiescent x - ray - to - optical flux ratio of ( @xmath3 ) is much greater than the maximum observed from quiescent stellar coronae ( @xmath33 ) , so we exclude the stellar coronae as a possible solution .",
    "the single power - law spectrum requires a higher column density than the optically implied value ( = 0.72 vs. 0.30 ) and is much steeper ( photon slope @xmath34=4.1 ) than is typically observed from non - thermal x - ray sources .",
    "we reject the model on this basis .",
    "standard shakura - sunyaev @xcite disks have largely been excluded as the dominant emission of transients in quiescence @xcite , although recent interest in alternative disk models @xcite suggest it is useful to constrain parameters for a multicolor disk model . and",
    ", although black - body emission does not physically describe the emergent spectrum from a transient neutron star atmosphere in quiescence ( bbr98 ) , we include these spectral parameters as well for the interested reader .",
    "neither @xmath35 of the multicolor disk model nor  of the blackbody model appear to correspond to any physically interesting values ; both are smaller than canonical ns radii .",
    "the simplest interpretation of the spectrum is thermal emission from a pure hydrogen atmosphere on the ns , and so we include the best - fit parameters in table  [ tab : fits ] .",
    "however , previous observations have found a power - law component which dominates the quiescent spectrum at high energies in  @xcite , and in the transient 4  @xcite , with values between @xmath27 and 2 . we included a power - law component , with slope fixed alternately at @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "an f - test @xcite shows that the additional spectral component does not significantly improve the model fit ( prob=0.07 and 0.13 , respectively ) .",
    "the resulting values of  are systematically higher , while @xmath36  is systematically lower , indicating that the presence of a weak power - law may be biasing the pure h atmosphere spectral model parameters .",
    "we therefore prefer the values from the h atmosphere plus @xmath27 spectral model ( over the h atmosphere spectral model alone ) , of = 13.4 km and @xmath36=135 ev .",
    "these are not significantly different from those of the @xmath28 spectral model .",
    "when we hold  fixed at its best - fit value , we obtain ( for the @xmath27 spectrum ) = 13.42.0 km and @xmath36=135 ev , indicating that the uncertainty in has a modest effect on the uncertainty in the h atmosphere spectral parameters .",
    "here @xmath36  and  are the effective temperature and ns radius as measured by a distant observer .",
    "they obey the relation @xmath37@xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the luminosity measured by a distant observer .",
    "the `` proper '' values of  and  are related to those at infinity through the gravitational redshift parameter @xmath40^{1/2}$ ] ( the redshift is @xmath41 ) ; for a neutron star of mass @xmath42 and radius @xmath43 , @xmath44 .",
    "the gravitational field redshifts photon energies and bends their trajectories , so that = @xmath36@xmath45 and =  @xmath46 .",
    "the observed and proper bolometric luminosities are then related by @xmath47 ; one power of @xmath48 accounts for the energy redshift and the other accounts for the time dilation .",
    "the observed bolometric thermal flux is then @xmath49=2.5 .",
    "we simultaneously fit the _ chandra _  spectrum with three energy spectra taken in quiescence : _ rosat_/pspc in october 1992 , _ rosat_/pspc in march 1993 , and _ asca _  in october 1996 ( cf .",
    "table  [ tab : obs ] ; see for details on these spectra ) .",
    "we included a 4% systematic uncertainty , to allow for differing calibrations between instruments .",
    "the results of these spectral fits are in table  [ tab : results ] ) .",
    "fitting an absorbed , pure h atmosphere spectrum with all identical parameters produces a statistically unacceptable fit ( /dof=2.63/67 dof ; here and elsewhere in this paper , the first number is the reduced @xmath50 value , the second number is the number of degrees of freedom , and the two are separated by the backslash character )",
    ". however , acceptable fits are found if we permit either ( marginally ) , @xmath36  or  to vary between the four observations .",
    "the observed 0.5 - 10 kev fluxes span a range of a factor 1.870.21 ( 90% confidence ) . therefore , while the spectra are statistically different , we are unable to observationally discern which spectral parameter ( or combination of parameters ) is changing .",
    "we then added the power - law component .",
    "the best fit spectrum in which all five spectral parameters are the same for the four different observations was statistically unacceptable ( = 2.80/65 dof ; prob=2 ) , indicating spectral variability .",
    "acceptable fits are found if we let any of the four parameters ( , @xmath36 , , @xmath51 ) vary independently between the four observations .",
    "the constraints on the power - law slope are very weak .",
    "also , in the fit in which @xmath51 was permitted to vary , the value @xmath52 is steeper than is typical of these sources , combined with a high value of .",
    "we examined the temperature decrease as a function of time since the outburst end .",
    "table  [ tab : obs ] gives the time - delay between the quiescent observation and the end of the previous outburst ;",
    "table  [ tab : results ] contains the temperatures measured during the quiescent observation .",
    "for the 1993 _ rosat _  observation , we assumed that the outburst ended 60 days after its start .",
    "a linear fit to the data finds a temperature which decreases ( @xmath5390 ) ev / yr ( consistent with no decrease ) , with a 3@xmath1 upper - limit of @xmath24270 ev / yr .",
    "this is an uncertain measurement for a number of reasons : the number of days since outburst start is uncertain by @xmath37 days , the duration of outbursts varies from outburst to outburst , and the initial temperature of the ns atmosphere may be related to the total fluence of the most recent outburst , which is unknown for 2 of the 4 outbursts . moreover , the temperatures taken alone are not significantly different .",
    "this level of decrease is consistent with the limit on the decrease in the thermal temperature of 4 , which is ( @xmath22.21.8 ) ev / yr @xcite .",
    "c98 reported a power - law component that dominates the x - ray spectrum at energies above @xmath212 kev in quiescence , similar to a power - law component seen in 4@xcite .",
    "as we find above , the _ chandra _  spectrum does not require an additional power - law component at high energies , although inclusion of a power - law component makes a systematic difference to the parameters of the thermal component .",
    "we stress , therefore , that the power - law flux values we discuss in this section are merely the best - fit values , and are not evidence that the power - law component is present .",
    "the best - fit power - law / thermal luminosity ratio is 188% ( 2613% ) for a fixed @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ; see table  [ tab : fits ] ) .",
    "the best - fit power - law flux is ( 2.21 ) [ ( 3.1 ) ] for @xmath27 [ @xmath28 ] in the 0.5 - 10 kev pass band .",
    "these are consistent with power - law flux reported in quiescence from the observations of c98 ( 5 ) .",
    "we investigated if a variable power - law intensity could be responsible for the variations between the four observations .",
    "we held the value of @xmath34=1 fixed ( the value found by c98 in observations 3 - 6 ) , kept the , @xmath36 , and  constant between the four observations , and permit the power - law flux to vary between observations .",
    "the best fit was unacceptable ( /dof=1.64/65 dof ; prob=8 ) .",
    "we conclude that the observed spectral variability can not be explained by a variable power - law component with the slope observed by c98 .",
    "the variability is caused either by a power - law which changes in slope and flux , or variability in the thermal component or column density .",
    "is one of the brightest known quiescent nss , and , combined with its frequent accretion outbursts , provides the best opportunity to test the relationship between the time - averaged outburst flux and the quiescent flux predicted by bbr98 .",
    "we use the rxte / asm data to measure the time - averaged outburst flux @xmath55 ( which is proportional to @xmath56 ) .",
    "we integrate all counts with @xmath57 significance during the five year period jan 1996-jan 2001 ( 3.9 counts ; we adopt a 10% uncertainty ) , which includes @xmath215 outbursts .",
    "if the flux of aql  x-1 , when not in outburst , was always just below the rxte / asm 1-day detection limit ( 0.1 c / s ) , this would increase the time - average outburst flux by only 4% .",
    "using w3pimms , the asm counts / flux conversion for power - law spectra @xmath34=0.8 , 1.0 , 2.0 are 3.4 , 3.6 , and 5.0 ergs  cmcount ( 0.5 - 10.0 kev ) , respectively . for blackbody spectra kt=0.81.4 kev ,",
    "the conversion factors are approximately the same : 3.3 ergs  cmcount .",
    "we adopt 3.6 ergscmcount ( 0.5 - 10.0 kev ) with the realization that the spectral and bolometric uncertainties can be as large as @xmath325% .",
    "this then gives @xmath58 , or roughly @xmath59 .",
    "we assume that the ns liberates @xmath60 per accreted baryon during the outburst .",
    "then , from equation ( [ eq : brown ] ) , we expect a quiescent bolometric thermal flux @xmath61 , or @xmath62 , compared with @xmath49=2.5 observed during the _ chandra _  observation .",
    "the quiescent bolometric thermal flux is uncertain by dex ( about a factor of 2 in both directions , 1@xmath1 ) , and so is consistent with this prediction ( bbr98 ; eq . [ eq : brown ] ) .    note , on the other hand , that if one were to assume that 100% of the emergent luminosity were from accretion , this would set @xmath63 @xmath7yr , which is above the @xmath64 where gravity stratifies metals in the ns atmosphere  that is , where metal lines would become unobservable .",
    "we do not exclude the presence of metal lines in the observed spectrum , and it is possible that , at such an implied accretion rate , metal lines may be observed .",
    "we have detected  in quiescence , at a luminosity comparable to that observed in three previous epochs .",
    "this makes  the second transiently accreting , type - i x - ray bursting ns ( after 4 ; ) which maintains a quiescent luminosity to within a factor of a few .",
    "the stability of cen x-4 s quiescent luminosity over years , and the ability of aql  x-1 to return to the same quiescent luminosity between outbursts ( where @xmath64 increases by more than a factor of 1000 ) are both strong support for their basal quiescent luminosity being set by deep crustal heating ( bbr98 ) .",
    "in addition , spectral evidence points to most of the quiescent emission being thermal emission from the ns surface .",
    "while the h atmosphere spectral model implies a ns radius which is at the low end of the eos range for the adopted distance ( see , for example , ) , inclusion of an additional power - law component  although not statistically required  produces a systematically larger value of  and smaller value of @xmath36 , which is the expected direction of bias if the previously observed power - law component is present .",
    "we therefore quote the best - fit value of = 13.4 ( d/5 kpc ) km and @xmath36=135 ev which includes an @xmath27 power - law component , noting that these are not significantly different when we assume a value @xmath28 .",
    "greater scrutiny of the distances to this and similar objects is called for .",
    "moreover , we examined the spectrum only in a limited range ( 0.5 - 8.0 kev ) , as _ chandra_/acis - s is not yet calibrated down to 0.2 kev .",
    "however , puzzles remain .",
    "the quiescent x - ray luminosity of aql x-1 has varied by a factor of 1.870.21 over timescales of years , while remaining constant ( @xmath2415% rms ) on timescales 1 - 10,000 sec .",
    "this is similar to the intensity variability observed from another quiescent transient neutron star , 4 , which has shown variability of a factor of @xmath213 on timescales of days - yrs @xcite , and @xmath2418% rms variability on 1 - 10,000 sec timescales @xcite . in addition , the power - law spectral components in some of these sources can not be explained as thermal emission ; their origin is unclear .",
    "a variation in @xmath36  can be attributed to either a variation in quiescent accretion onto the compact object or a changing thermal emission . since the ns core can not change its temperature on these timescales , any variation in the thermal emission",
    "would need to be from either internal heat sources previously neglected @xcite or changes in the overlying envelope .",
    "if quiescent accretion powers the variability in cen x-4 and aql x-1 , then we are left with the surprising coincidence that @xmath65 provides a luminosity comparable to the deep crustal heating luminosity ( eq .  1 ) , in at least two different systems . even in its simplest form ( a diminished accretion rate from a cool disk , )",
    "it seems surprising that quiescent accretion would maintain near equality with the deep crustal heating luminosity .",
    "it seems even less likely if one invokes a magnetic propeller to regulate the accretion rate onto the ns in quiescence @xcite .",
    "therefore , if the variability is due to accretion , it remains to be explained why the accretion rate provides a luminosity so nearly equal to that from deep crustal heating .",
