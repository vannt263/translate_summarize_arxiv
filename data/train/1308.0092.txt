    "zero - bias anomalies in transport properties are one of the most intriguing features of the low - temperature physics in nanostructures .",

    "surprisingly , we find that this dot majorana mode is pinned to the fermi level @xmath0 of the leads even when the gate controlled dot level @xmath7 is far off resonance @xmath8 .    based on the results above , we suggest three experimental ways of probing the majorana end mode in the wire via the leaked / pinned majorana mode in the dot : ( i ) with the dot kept off resonance [ @xmath9 one can measure @xmath2 vs @xmath10 , the wire - dot coupling @xmath10 can be controlled by an external gate , to see the emergence of the @xmath5 peak in @xmath2 as the majorana end mode `` leaks '' into the dot , fig .",
