    "the standard model describes all the visible matter in the universe in terms of a limited number of fermionic constituents of matter : six quarks , three charged leptons and three light neutrinos .",
    "it also comprises three fundamental gauge interactions between these constituents , namely the electromagnetic , strong and weak forces , to which should be added gravitation .",
    "the standard model is in good agreement with all confirmed experimental results from particle accelerators .",
    "however , there was , until july 4th 2012 , one crucial missing ingredient : the origin of particle masses . without a mass for the electron",
    "there would be no atoms , as electrons would escape from nuclei at the speed of light , and the weak interactions would not live up to their name : they would be stronger than electromagnetism .",
    "so discovering the origin of particle masses has been a big deal .",
    "in addition to elucidating the origin of particle masses and establishing whether a / the higgs boson exists , there are many important open questions beyond the standard model .",
    "why are there so many different types of matter particles ? why do weak interactions mix them the way they do ?",
    "how / why do they discriminate between matter and antimatter , and might this difference explain the dominance of matter over antimatter in the universe today ? what is the nature of the invisible dark matter that , according to astrophysicists and cosmologists , dominates over the visible matter described by the standard model ? are the fundamental forces unified , and what is the full quantum theory of gravity ?",
    "the key to answering many of these other questions may be provided by finding the origin of particle masses .",
    "for example , decays of the higgs boson may discriminate between matter and antimatter , and might lie at the origin of the cosmological matter - antimatter asymmetry . in many theoretical extensions of the standard model ,",
    "the higgs boson is accompanied by other new particles , the lightest of which might provide the astrophysical dark matter . a possible unified theory of all the elementary particle interactions",
    "might employ a symmetry - breaking mechanism analogous to that in the standard model , and the existence of any light ` elementary ' scalar boson would pose a challenge for many quantum theories of gravity .",
    "the equations describing the gauge interactions of the standard model do not discriminate between matter particles with the same quantum numbers , which differ only in their masses .",
    "the mass - generation mechanism must discriminate between these otherwise - identical particles of matter and between the different force - carrying vector bosons : it must break the symmetries between them .",
    "one way to achieve this might be to break the symmetry explicitly in the equations , but then the calculability of the theory would be lost .",
    "the alternative is to retain symmetric equations but break the symmetry in their solutions .",
    "the issue then is whether to break the symmetry throughout space , or via boundary conditions .",
    "the latter is not possible in conventional three - dimensional space , since it has no boundaries .",
    "however , it would be possible in theories with additional dimensions of space : one could postulate different behaviours in the extra dimension(s ) for different particle species .",
    "the discovery of a / the higgs boson at the lhc  @xcite has somewhat deflated interest in extra - dimensional models , unless their spectrum features a low - mass excitation that resembles closely the higgs boson of the standard model .",
    "this discovery seems to mark the latest success of a long - running theoretical strategy in particle physics : when in trouble , postulate one of more new particles .",
    "a partial list includes reconciling quantum mechanics and special relativity ( antimatter ) , nuclear spectra ( the neutron ) , the continuous spectrum in @xmath0 decay ( the neutrino ) , nucleon - nucleon interactions ( the pion ) , the suppression of @xmath1 ( the second neutrino ) , flavour su(3 ) ( @xmath2 and quarks ) , the suppression of flavour - changing neutral currents ( charm ) , cp violation ( the third generation ) , strong dynamics ( the gluons ) , the discovery of the @xmath3 lepton ( the @xmath4 and @xmath5 quarks ) , weak interactions ( the @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) , and their renormalizability ( a / the higgs boson )  .    the discovery of a / the higgs boson marks the completion of the holy trinity of particle types seen in table  [ tabsmpartcont ] .",
    "it has been known for decades that the only type of field theory capable of making non - trivial over many magnitudes of energy is a renormalizable one .",
    "also , it has been a theorem for some 40 years that such a theory could only contain ( i ) gauge vector bosons , ( ii ) spin-1/2 fermions , and ( iii ) scalar bosons .",
    "specification of a renormalizable theory is completed by choosing ( a ) the gauge group , ( b ) the fermion representations , and ( c ) the scalar fields used to realize the desired symmetry - breaking pattern .",
    "we have long known that the answer ( so far ) to ( a ) is su(3)@xmath8su(2)@xmath8u(1 ) and that the fermion representations are triplets of su(3 ) and singlets and doublets of su(2 ) .",
    "finally we have an example of category ( iii ) , a scalar boson , and there is strong evidence that it is responsible for ( c ) electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "the first of these lectures describes the long road towards the discovery of a / the higgs boson , the second lecture describes the state of our knowledge after run 1 of the lhc , and the third lecture outlines some of the prospects for future studies , including supersymmetric higgs bosons and concepts for higgs factories .",
    "table  [ tabsmpartcont ] summarizes the particle content of the standard model  @xcite .",
    "the electromagnetic and weak interactions are described by an su(2)@xmath9u(1)@xmath10 group  @xcite , where the subscript @xmath11 reminds us that the weak su(2 ) group acts only the left - handed fermions , and @xmath12 is the hypercharge .",

    "however , consistency with the precision electroweak measurements made at lep and other accelerators agreed with the standard model if only if there was a relatively light higgs boson weighing @xmath21  gev or so  @xcite .",
    "however , until july 2012 there was no direct experimental evidence for the last two lines  @xcite .",
    "one of the main objectives of the lhc was to discover whether they are right , need modification , or are simply wrong .",
    "the most important result of the first run of the lhc has been to find some evidence that these lines do indeed contain a grain of truth .",
    "the first line in ( [ eqsmlag ] ) is the kinetic term for the gauge sector of the electroweak theory , with @xmath22 running over the total number of gauge fields : three associated with su(2)@xmath23 , which we call @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and one associated with u(1)@xmath10 , which we call @xmath27 .",

    "( [ eqsmlag ] ) describes the interactions between the matter fields @xmath31 , described by dirac equations , and the gauge fields via covariant derivatives .",
    "the third line is the yukawa sector and incorporates the interactions between the matter fields and the scalar field @xmath18 that is responsible for giving fermions their masses when electroweak symmetry breaking occurs .",

    "for the scalar field , and hence spontaneous electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "this mechanism is often called the higgs mechanism , but the history is quite complicated , with many antecedents to the higgs papers , with antecedents in condensed - matter physics , e.g. , in the theories of superfluidity and superconductivity  @xcite  .",
    "spontaneous global symmetry breaking was introduced into four - dimensional , relativistic particle physics by nambu  @xcite , providing insight into the lightness of the pion and spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "subsequently , a simple field - theoretical model was formulated by goldstone  @xcite , and the appearance and number of massless scalar bosons appearing in such theories was specified by a theorem proved in  @xcite . in parallel ,",
    "nambu  @xcite and anderson  @xcite had shown how to interpret superconductivity in terms of a spontaneously - broken local u(1 ) symmetry . moreover",
    ", anderson had conjectured that this could occur also in the four - dimensional case , but gilbert  @xcite argued in early 1964 that this would be impossible in a relativistic theory .",
    "however , later in 1964 several papers successfully introduced spontaneously - broken local symmetry into particle physics .",
    "the initial paper by englert and brout  @xcite was followed a few weeks later by two papers written by higgs , who did not know about their work at the time .",
    "the first higgs paper  @xcite pointed out that gilbert s objection to a four - dimensional extension of anderson s approach could be circumvented , and the second proposed a specific four - dimensional model with a massive scalar boson  @xcite .",
    "the subsequent paper by guralnik , hagen and kibble  @xcite developed the ideas proposed in these earlier papers .",
    "also of note is a relatively - unknown 1965 paper by migdal and polyakov  @xcite , which discusses the partial breaking of a local non - abelian symmetry , ahead of the influential paper of kibble  @xcite .",
    "of all these authors , higgs was the only one who mentioned explicitly the existence of a massive scalar boson ( see equation ( 2b ) of his second paper  @xcite ) , and he went on to write a third paper in 1966  @xcite that discusses the properties of this ` higgs boson ' in surprising detail including , e.g. , its decays into massive vector bosons .      as an illustration of spontaneous symmetry breaking  @xcite , consider first a single complex scalar field @xmath36 with the following effective potential : @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are real constants .",

    "its appearance is a general feature of models with spontaneously - broken global symmetries , as proven in  @xcite .",
    "the total number of such massless particles corresponds in general to the number of field directions in which the potential is flat .",
    "nambu introduced this idea into particle physics in order to describe the ( relatively light ) pion of qcd  @xcite , which he identified as a ( pseudo-)goldstone boson of chiral symmetry that would have no mass if the up and down quarks were exactly massless .",

    "[ fig : uncertainties ] that shows the current theoretical uncertainties in these branching ratios quoted by the lhc higgs cross - section working group  @xcite dwarf the tlep experimental uncertainties .",
    "more precise theoretical calculations will be sorely needed .    _ , height=377",
    "]      it would be premature to decide on the top priority for a possible future large collider before we see at least some first results from the lhc at 13/14  tev",
    ". the physics landscape will be completely different if supersymmetric particles or some other new physics is discovered at the tev scale . in my opinion ,",
    "in that case it would be a mistake to invest the world s particle physics resources in a collider incapable of studying the new tev - scale physics .    beyond any reasonable doubt",
    ", the atlas and cms experiments at the lhc have discovered a higgs boson , but it remains an open question whether there may be others . however , the existence of an ( apparently ) elementary scalar boson poses a big challenge for theoretical physics .",
    "most of the responses to this challenge postulate some new physics at the tev scale .",
    "there is some puzzlement that no such new physics turned up in the first lhc run at 7 and 8  tev , but it is too soon for disappointment , still less despair .",
    "the lhc has broad possibilities for discovering new physics beyond the standard model when it restarts at 13/14  tev .",
    "if it does discover new physics at the tev scale , the top priority will be to study it , and beyond the lhc , a very - high - energy @xmath469 collider may offer the best prospects for long - term studies of this new physics .",
    "if the lhc does not discover more new physics , it would be natural to focus on studies of the higgs boson that has already been discovered , in which case tlep offers the best prospects , also for other high - precision physics .",
    "the tlep project is part of a vision for the future of particle physics that combines indirect exploration of possible new physics at the 10-tev scale in @xmath460 collisions with direct exploration of this energy scale in very - high - energy @xmath469 collisions at @xmath470  tev in the same tunnel with a circumference of 80 to 100  km  @xcite .",
    "the communities interested in these complementary exploratory projects should work together to realize this vision , whose physics case will require a major effort to develop and convince those who control the global resources for scientific research .",
    "i thank tevong you for his collaboration on topics discussed in these lectures .",
