    "there has been considerable recent interest in surprising thermodynamic `` equivalences '' between certain ideal bose and spinless fermi gas systems , including nonrelativistic free particles in two dimensions,@xcite and between one - dimensional particles with a linear , sound - like dispersion relation.@xcite both results are valid in the grand - canonical ensemble , and assert that the helmholtz free energies @xmath6 and @xmath7 of the fermi and bose systems , respectively , are simply related by @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a constant that may depend on the system volume @xmath10 , but is independent of temperature @xmath5 and the mean particle number @xmath1 .",
    "the bose and fermi systems are assumed to have identical single - particle hamiltonians , and have the same @xmath5 , @xmath10 , and @xmath1 .",
    "there are several immediate consequences of eq .",
    "( [ equivalence ] ) , including :    1 .",
    "the entropies of the fermi and bose systems are identical , @xmath11 2 .",
    "their internal energies differ by a temperature - independent constant , namely @xmath12 3 .",
    "the constant - volume heat capacities are identical ; 4 .",
    "the chemical potentials are simply shifted by a temperature - independent constant , @xmath13 5 .",
    "the thermodynamic potentials are connected by a relation opposite to ( [ equivalence ] ) , @xmath14 6 .",
    "the pressures of the fermi and bose gases satisfy @xmath15 and again differ only by a temperature - independent constant .",
    "these results explain and considerably extend isolated thermodynamic relations that were discovered some time ago by may.@xcite    in this paper we demonstrate that the equivalence defined in eq .",
    "( [ equivalence ] ) holds whenever the single - particle density of states ( dos ) is independent of energy , for which the systems considered in refs .",
    "are special cases .",
    "we then extend recent results of schmidt and schnack@xcite and of crescimanno and landsberg@xcite on harmonically confined bose and fermi gases in one dimension to further enlarge the class of equivalences to include any ideal quantum gas with a discrete ladder - type spectrum , in the limit @xmath16 here @xmath1 is the mean particle number , @xmath2 is the standard deviation in particle number about @xmath1 , @xmath3 is the energy - level spacing , @xmath4 is boltzmann s constant , and @xmath5 is the temperature .",
    "the condition ( [ limit condition ] ) requires that either ( i ) the particle number is conserved , ( ii ) the number of particles is very large , ( iii ) the temperature is very high , ( iv ) the spectrum is continuous , or any combination of these possibilities .",
    "we begin by writing the grand - canonical partition function of an arbitrary noninteracting bose or fermi system as @xmath17 here @xmath18 labels the quantum states of a single bose or spinless fermi particle with spectrum @xmath19 , and @xmath20 .",
    "the occupation numbers @xmath21 take the values @xmath22 for bosons and @xmath23 for fermions .",
    "the thermodynamic potential @xmath24 is given by @xmath25    because the average number of particles is required to be the same for the bose and fermi cases , their chemical potentials @xmath26 in eq .",
    "( [ partition function definition ] ) are different .",
    "the relations between @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath1 , are determined by @xmath29 where @xmath30 are the bose and fermi distribution functions .",
    "next we define a single - particle dos according to @xmath31 which gives the number of energy levels per unit energy , as a function of @xmath32 . in a translationally invariant system",
    ", @xmath33 scales linearly with system volume @xmath10 . in terms of the dos",
    ", we have @xmath34 and @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the bose and fermi fugacities .",
    "furthermore , condition ( [ particle number condition ] ) can be written as @xmath38 the expressions ( [ general bose partition function ] ) , ( [ general fermi partition function ] ) , and ( [ new particle number condition ] ) , are valid for any noninteracting quantum gas .",
    "we assume that spectrum is bounded from below , and that the dos is a constant , @xmath9 , independent of energy , above that minimum . without loss of generality",
    "we can take the minimum to be at @xmath39 .",
    "then @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the unit step function .",
    "the most common example of a dos of the form ( [ constant dos ] ) occurs for free nonrelativistic particles of mass @xmath42 in two dimensions , in which case @xmath43 however , there are other situations where ( [ constant dos ] ) holds as well , including noninteracting particles moving in one dimension with a linear dispersion @xmath44 , and also for particles moving in three dimensions with qubic dispersion @xmath45 .",
    "these cases were noted earlier by pathria.@xcite furthermore , we note that the equivalence ( [ equivalence ] ) would _ not _ apply to two - dimensional systems moving in the potential of a corrugated surface or to ideal lattice gas models .    assuming ( [ constant dos ] )",
    ", we can immediately obtain @xmath46 and @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 . here",
    "@xmath50 is euler s dilogarithm function .",

    "the thermodynamic equivalence evidently applies to any noninteracting quantum gas with a constant dos .",
    "it is also instructive to directly demonstrate the equivalence of the entropies : for a system with a constant dos of the form ( [ constant dos ] ) , the bose and fermi entropies are@xcite @xmath54 \\nonumber \\\\      & - &   \\big[1+n_{\\rm b}(\\epsilon \\ ! - \\ !",

    "because the average particle numbers are the same , these lower limits coincide and thus the fermi and bose entropies are identical .",
    "helmholtz free energy per particle for a 1d ideal bose gas in a harmonic confining potential with level spacing @xmath3.,width=302 ]    it is interesting to consider whether a constant dos is _ necessary _ for the equivalence defined in eq .",

    "[ constant dos section ] in the limit @xmath61 ? in this section",
    "we demonstrate that the equivalence does still hold , in the grand - canonical ensemble , for noninteracting gases with the spectrum ( [ oscillator spectrum ] ) , in the limit @xmath62 , and also in the canonical ensemble for any @xmath1 .    in figs .",
    "[ bose figure ] and [ fermi figure ] we show the helmholtz free energy per particle , numerically calculated in the grand - canonical ensemble , for 1d quantum gases in a harmonic potential with level spacing @xmath3 .",

    "the solid curves are for @xmath63 and the dashed curves are for @xmath64 . in fig .",
    "[ difference figure ] , the difference between the fermi and bose free energies are given as a function of temperature , with @xmath6 shifted by the fermi ground - state energy @xmath65 [ defined below in eq .",
    "( [ ground state energy ] ) ] for convenience .    for small @xmath1 ( dashed curve in fig .",
    "[ difference figure ] ) , the free energies clearly do not differ by a temperature - independent constant .",
    "however , as @xmath1 becomes larger ( solid curve ) , the equivalence does apply .",
    "these numerical results suggest that when particle - number fluctuations become negligible , the equivalence holds . to establish this result , we use the fact that in the large-@xmath1 limit , the grand - canonical free energy approaches the canonical free energy ( shown in figs .  [ bose figure ] and [ fermi figure ] as dotted curves ) , and that the equivalence holds exactly in the canonical ensemble .    writing the grand - canonical partition function @xmath66 in terms of the canonical partition functions",
    "@xmath67 according to @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the fugacity , leads to @xmath70 for bose @xmath71 and fermi @xmath72 particles with spectrum ( [ oscillator spectrum ] ) , the grand - canonical partition function is @xmath73 \\ \\ \\ \\ { \\rm with } \\ \\ \\ \\ b",

    "( [ canonical z ] ) , the canonical free energy for @xmath1 particles is simply @xmath76 the bose and fermi cases simply differing by the constant @xmath65 .",
    "the second term in ( [ canonical f ] ) does not depend on the quantum statistics parameter @xmath77 .",
    "schmidt and schnack@xcite also recognized the partial equivalence between 1d ideal bose and fermi gases in harmonic confining potentials .",
    "later , crescimanno and landsberg@xcite showed that the physical origin of that equivalence in the canonical ensemble is the exact mapping between the many - particle excitation spectra of both systems .    finally , we note that the thermodynamic equivalence with the spectrum ( [ oscillator spectrum ] ) also trivially holds in the @xmath78 limit , because in this limit the systems become classical .",
    "therefore we conjecture that the equivalence defined in eq .",
    "( [ equivalence ] ) will hold in the grand - canonical ensemble for any noninteracting quantum gas with a discrete ladder - type spectrum , whenever the quantity @xmath79 is small , where @xmath1 is the average particle number and @xmath2 is its standard deviation about @xmath1 .",
    "this ratio roughly characterizes the magnitude of energy fluctuations caused by the exchange of particles with the environment  if allowed  relative to the thermal energy .",
    "we conclude that the ( partial ) thermodynamic equivalence discovered by lee@xcite holds for ideal quantum gases with the spectrum ( [ oscillator spectrum ] ) whenever ( i ) the number of particles is strictly conserved , ( ii ) the number of particles becomes very large so that @xmath80 , ( iii ) @xmath81 , ( iv ) @xmath82 , or when any combination of these criteria are fulfilled .",
