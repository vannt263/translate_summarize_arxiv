    "in this paper we describe a new method for analyzing the laplacian on asymptotically hyperbolic , or conformally compact , spaces , which was introduced in @xcite .",
    "this new method in particular constructs the analytic continuation of the resolvent for even metrics ( in the sense of guillarmou @xcite ) , and gives high energy estimates in strips .",
    "the key idea is an extension across the boundary for a problem obtained from the laplacian shifted by the spectral parameter .",
    "the extended problem is non - elliptic  indeed , on the other side it is related to the klein - gordon equation on an asymptotically de sitter space  but nonetheless it can be analyzed by methods of fredholm theory . in @xcite these methods , with some additional ingredients , were used to analyze the wave equation on kerr - de sitter space - times ; the present setting is described there as the simplest application of the tools introduced .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to give a self - contained treatment of conformally compact spaces , without burdening the reader with the additional machinery required for the kerr - de sitter analysis .",
    "we start by recalling the definition of manifolds with _ even _ conformally compact metrics .",
    "these are riemannian metrics @xmath0 on the interior of an @xmath1-dimensional compact manifold with boundary @xmath2 such that near the boundary @xmath3 , with a product decomposition nearby and a defining function @xmath4 , they are of the form @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a family of metrics on @xmath7 depending on @xmath4 in an even manner , i.e.  only even powers of @xmath4 show up in the taylor series .",
    "( there is a much more natural way to phrase the evenness condition , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* definition  1.2 ) . )",
    "we also write @xmath8 for the manifold @xmath2 when the smooth structure has been changed so that @xmath9 is a boundary defining function ; thus , a smooth function on @xmath2 is even if and only if it is smooth when regarded as a function on @xmath8 . the analytic continuation of the resolvent in this category ( but without the evenness condition ) was obtained by mazzeo and melrose @xcite ( agmon @xcite and perry @xcite had similar results in the restricted setting of hyperbolic quotients ) , with the possibility of some essential singularities at pure imaginary half - integers noticed by borthwick and perry @xcite .",
    "guillarmou @xcite showed that for even metrics the latter do not exist , but generically they do exist for non - even metrics , by a more careful analysis utilizing the work of graham and zworski @xcite .",
    "further , if the manifold is actually asymptotic to hyperbolic space ( note that hyperbolic space is of this form in view of the poincar model ) , melrose ,",
    "s barreto and vasy @xcite proved high energy resolvent estimates in strips around the real axis via a parametrix construction ; these are exactly the estimates that allow expansions for solutions of the wave equation in terms of resonances .",
    "estimates just on the real axis were obtained by cardoso and vodev for more general conformal infinities @xcite .",
    "one implication of our methods is a generalization of these results : we allow general conformal infinities , and obtain estimates in arbitrary strips .    below @xmath10",
    "denotes ` schwartz functions ' on @xmath2 , i.e.  @xmath11 functions vanishing with all derivatives at @xmath12 , and @xmath13 is the dual space of ` tempered distributions ' ( these spaces are naturally identified for @xmath2 and @xmath8 ) , while @xmath14 is the standard sobolev space on @xmath8 ( corresponding to extension across the boundary , see e.g.  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* appendix  b ) , where these are denoted by @xmath15 ) . for instance , @xmath16 , with the norms taken with respect to any _ smooth _ riemannian metric on @xmath8 ( all choices yield equivalent norms by compactness ) . here",
    "we point out that while @xmath17 is a smooth non - degenerate section of the pull - back of @xmath18 to @xmath8 ( which essentially means that it is a smooth , in @xmath8 , non - degenerate linear combination of @xmath19 and @xmath20 in local coordinates ) , as @xmath21 means @xmath22 , it is actually not a smooth section of @xmath23 .",
    "however , @xmath24 is a smooth non - degenerate density , so @xmath25 ( up to norm equivalence ) is the @xmath26 space given by the density @xmath24 , i.e.  is @xmath27 , i.e. @xmath28 further , in local coordinates @xmath29 , using @xmath30 , the @xmath31 norm of @xmath32 is equivalent to @xmath33    we also let @xmath34 be the standard semiclassical sobolev space , i.e.  for @xmath6 bounded away from @xmath35 this is equipped with a norm equivalent to the standard fixed ( @xmath6-independent ) norm on @xmath14 , but the uniform behavior as @xmath36 is different ; e.g.  locally the @xmath37 norm is given by @xmath38 , see @xcite .",
    "thus , in , for @xmath39 ( which is possible when @xmath40 , i.e.  if one only considers the continuation into a small strip beyond the continuous spectrum ) , @xmath41 with the norms taken with respect to any smooth riemannian metric on @xmath8 .",
    "( see theorem  [ thm : conf - compact - high ] for the full statement . )",
    "suppose that @xmath2 is an @xmath42-dimensional manifold with boundary @xmath3 with an even riemannian conformally compact metric @xmath0 .",
    "then the inverse of @xmath43 written as @xmath44 , has a meromorphic continuation from @xmath45 to @xmath46 , @xmath47 with poles with finite rank residues .",
    "if in addition @xmath48 is non - trapping , then non - trapping estimates hold in every strip @xmath49 , @xmath50 : for @xmath51 , @xmath52 if @xmath53 has compact support in @xmath54 , the @xmath55 norm on @xmath53 can be replaced by the @xmath56 norm . for suitable @xmath57 ,",
    "the estimates are valid in regions @xmath58 if the multipliers @xmath59 are slightly adjusted .",
    "further , as stated in theorem  [ thm : conf - compact - high ] , the resolvent is _ semiclassically outgoing _ with a loss of @xmath60 , in the sense of recent results of datchev and vasy @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this means that for mild trapping ( where , in a strip near the spectrum , one has polynomially bounded resolvent for a compactly localized version of the trapped model ) one obtains resolvent bounds of the same kind as for the above - mentioned trapped models , and lossless estimates microlocally away from the trapping .",
    "in particular , one obtains logarithmic losses compared to non - trapping on the spectrum for hyperbolic trapping in the sense of ( * ? ? ? * section  1.2 ) , and polynomial losses in strips , since for the compactly localized model",
    "this was recently shown by wunsch and zworski @xcite .",
    "our method is to change the smooth structure , replacing @xmath4 by @xmath21 , conjugate the operator by an appropriate weight as well as remove a vanishing factor of @xmath61 , and show that the new operator continues smoothly and non - degenerately ( in an appropriate sense ) across @xmath62 , i.e.  @xmath3 , to a ( non - elliptic ) problem which we can analyze utilizing by now almost standard tools of microlocal analysis .",
    "these steps are reflected in the form of the estimate ; @xmath61 shows up in the use of evenness , conjugation due to the presence of @xmath63 , and the two halves of the vanishing factor of @xmath61 being removed in @xmath64 on the left and right hand sides .    while it might seem somewhat ad hoc , this construction in fact has origins in wave propagation in one higher dimensional ( i.e.@xmath65-dimensional ) lorentzian spaces  either minkowski space , or de sitter space blown up at a point at future infinity .",
    "namely in both cases the wave equation ( and the klein - gordon equation on de sitter space ) is a totally characteristic , or b- , pde , and after a mellin transform this gives a pde on the sphere at infinity in the minkowski case , and on the front face of the blow - up in the de sitter setting .",
    "these are exactly the pde arising by the process described in the previous paragraph , with the original manifold @xmath2 lying in the interior of the light cone in minkowski space ( so there are two copies , at future and past infinity ) and in the interior of the backward light cone from the blow - up point in the de sitter case ; see @xcite for more detail . this relationship , restricted to the @xmath2-region , was exploited in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section  7 ) , where the work of mazzeo and melrose was used to construct the poisson operator on asymptotically de sitter spaces .",
    "conceptually the main novelty here is that we work directly with the extended problem , which turns out to simplify the analysis of mazzeo and melrose in many ways and give a new explanation for guillarmou s results as well as yield high energy estimates .",
    "we briefly describe this extended operator , @xmath66 .",
    "it has radial points at the conormal bundle @xmath67 of @xmath3 in the sense of microlocal analysis , i.e.  the hamilton vector field is radial at these points , i.e.  is a multiple of the generator of dilations of the fibers of the cotangent bundle there .",
    "however , tools exist to deal with these , going back to melrose s geometric treatment of scattering theory on asymptotically euclidean spaces @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath67 consists of two components , @xmath68 , resp .",
    "@xmath69 , and in @xmath70 the images , @xmath71 , resp .",
    "@xmath72 , of these are sources , resp .",
    "sinks , for the hamilton flow . at @xmath73",
    "one has choices regarding the direction one wants to propagate estimates ( into or out of the radial points ) , which directly correspond to working with strong or weak sobolev spaces .",
    "for the present problem , the relevant choice is propagating estimates _ away from _ the radial points , thus working with the ` good ' sobolev spaces ( which can be taken to have as positive order as one wishes ; there is a minimum amount of regularity imposed by our choice of propagation direction , cf .",
    "the requirement @xmath51 above ) .",
    "all other points are either elliptic , or microhyperbolic .",
    "it remains to either deal with the non - compactness of the ` far end ' of the @xmath42-dimensional de sitter space  or instead , as is indeed more convenient when one wants to deal with more singular geometries , adding complex absorbing potentials , in the spirit of works of nonnenmacher and zworski @xcite and wunsch and zworski @xcite .",
    "in fact , the complex absorption could be replaced by adding a space - like boundary , see @xcite , but for many microlocal purposes complex absorption is more desirable , hence we follow the latter method .",
    "however , crucially , these complex absorbing techniques ( or the addition of a space - like boundary ) already enter in the non - semiclassical problem in our case , as we are in a non - elliptic setting .",
    "one can reverse the direction of the argument and analyze the wave equation on an @xmath42-dimensional even asymptotically de sitter space @xmath74 by extending it across the boundary , much like the the riemannian conformally compact space @xmath2 is extended in this approach .",
    "then , performing microlocal propagation in the opposite direction , which amounts to working with the adjoint operators that we already need in order to prove existence of solutions for the riemannian spaces , we obtain existence , uniqueness and structure results for asymptotically de sitter spaces , recovering a large part of the results of @xcite . here",
    "we only briefly indicate this method of analysis in remark  [ rem : asymp - ds ] .    in other words ,",
    "we establish a riemannian - lorentzian duality , that will have counterparts both in the pseudo - riemannian setting of higher signature and in higher rank symmetric spaces , though in the latter the analysis might become more complicated .",
    "note that asymptotically hyperbolic and de sitter spaces are not connected by a ` complex rotation ' ( in the sense of an actual deformation ) ; they are smooth continuations of each other in the sense we just discussed .    to emphasize the simplicity of our method , we list all of the microlocal techniques ( which are relevant both in the classical and in the semiclassical setting ) that we use on a _ compact manifold without boundary _ ; in all cases _ only microlocal sobolev estimates _ matter ( not parametrices , etc .",
    ") :    1 .   microlocal elliptic regularity .",
    "microhyperbolic propagation of singularities .",
    "rough _ analysis at a lagrangian invariant under the hamilton flow which roughly behaves like a collection of radial points , though the internal structure does not matter , in the spirit of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section  9 ) .",
    "4 .   complex absorbing ` potentials ' in the spirit of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these are almost ` off the shelf ' in terms of modern microlocal analysis , and thus our approach , from a microlocal perspective , is quite simple .",
    "we use these to show that on the continuation across the boundary of the conformally compact space we have a fredholm problem , on a perhaps slightly exotic function space , which however is ( perhaps apart from the complex absorption ) the simplest possible coisotropic function space based on a sobolev space , with order dictated by the radial points .",
    "also , we propagate the estimates along bicharacteristics in different directions depending on the component @xmath75 of the characteristic set under consideration ; correspondingly the sign of the complex absorbing ` potential ' will vary with @xmath75 , which is perhaps slightly unusual .",
    "however , this is completely parallel to solving the standard cauchy , or forward , problem for the wave equation , where one propagates estimates in _ opposite _ directions relative to the hamilton vector field in the two components of the characteristic set .",
    "the complex absorption we use modifies the operator @xmath66 outside @xmath8 .",
    "however , while @xmath76 depends on @xmath77 , its behavior on @xmath8 , and even near @xmath8 , is independent of this choice ; see the proof of section  [ sec : conf - comp - results ] for a detailed explanation .",
    "in particular , although @xmath76 may have resonances other than those of @xmath78 , the resonant states of these additional resonances are supported outside @xmath8 , hence do not affect the singular behavior of the resolvent in @xmath8 .",
    "while the results are stated for the scalar equation , analogous results hold for operators on natural vector bundles , such as the laplacian on differential forms .",
    "this is so because the results work if the principal symbol of the extended problem is scalar with the demanded properties , and the principal symbol of @xmath79 is either scalar at the ` radial sets ' , or instead satisfies appropriate estimates ( as an endomorphism of the pull - back of the vector bundle to the cotangent bundle ) at this location ; see remark  [ rem : bundles ] . the only change in terms of results on",
    "asymptotically hyperbolic spaces is that the threshold @xmath80 is shifted ; in terms of the explicit conjugation of section  [ sec : conf - comp - results ] this is so because of the change in the first order term in .    in section  [ sec : spaces ] we describe in detail the setup of conformally compact spaces and the extension across the boundary .",
    "then in section  [ sec : microlocal ] we describe the in detail the necessary microlocal analysis for the extended operator .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : conf - comp - results ] we translate these results back to asymptotically hyperbolic spaces .",

    "( we could instead require uniform estimates on compact subsets ; this makes no difference here . )",
    "the class of classical ( or one - step polyhomogeneous ) symbols is the subset @xmath89 of @xmath81 consisting of symbols possessing an asymptotic expansion @xmath90 where @xmath91 . then on @xmath92 , pseudodifferential operators @xmath93 are of the form @xmath94 understood as an oscillatory integral .",

    "the principal symbol is multiplicative , i.e.@xmath106 .",

    "note that both the elliptic set @xmath128 of @xmath111 ( i.e.  the set of points where @xmath111 is elliptic ) and @xmath129 are conic .",
    "differential operators on @xmath130 form the subset of @xmath131 in which @xmath96 is polynomial in the second factor , @xmath132 , so locally @xmath133    if @xmath134 is a manifold , one can transfer these definitions to @xmath134 by localization and requiring that the schwartz kernels are @xmath11 densities away from the diagonal in @xmath135 ; then @xmath97 is in @xmath136 , resp .",

    "we next consider the semiclassical operator algebra .",

    "@xmath155 is replaced by @xmath156 .",
    "correspondingly , @xmath157 and @xmath158 are subsets of @xmath156 .",
    "we can again add an extra parameter @xmath143 , so @xmath159 ; then in the invariant setting the principal symbol is @xmath160 .",
    "differential operators now take the form @xmath161 such a family has two principal symbols , the standard one ( but taking into account the semiclassical degeneration , i.e.  based on @xmath162 rather than @xmath163 ) , which depends on @xmath6 and is homogeneous , and the semiclassical one , which is at @xmath164 , and is not homogeneous : @xmath165 however , the restriction of @xmath166 to @xmath164 is the principal symbol of @xmath167 . in the special case",
    "in which @xmath166 is independent of @xmath6 ( which is true in the setting considered below ) , one can simply regard the usual principal symbol as the principal part of the semiclassical symbol .",
    "this is a convenient place to recall from @xcite that it is often useful to consider the radial compactification of the fibers of the cotangent bundle to balls ( or hemispheres , in the exposition of @xcite ) .",
    "thus , one adds a sphere at infinity to the fiber @xmath168 of @xmath156 over each @xmath169 .",
    "this sphere is naturally identified with @xmath170 , and we obtain compact fibers @xmath171 with boundary @xmath172 , with the smooth structure near @xmath170 arising from reciprocal polar coordinates @xmath173 for @xmath174 , but extending to @xmath175 , and with @xmath170 given by @xmath175 .",
    "thus , with @xmath176 the classical expansion becomes @xmath177 where @xmath91 , so in particular for @xmath178 , this is simply the taylor series expansion at @xmath179 of a function smooth up to @xmath180 . in the semiclassical context",
    "then one considers @xmath181 , and notes that ` classical ' semiclassical operators of order @xmath35 are given locally by @xmath182 with @xmath96 extending to be smooth up to the boundaries of this space , with semiclassical symbol given by restriction to @xmath183 , and standard symbol given by restriction to @xmath184 .",
    "thus , the claim regarding the limit of the semiclassical symbol at infinity is simply a matching statement of the two symbols at the corner @xmath185 in this compactified picture .",
    "finally , we recall that if @xmath186 is an order @xmath103 differential operator , then the behavior of @xmath187 as @xmath188 can be converted to a semiclassical problem by considering @xmath189 where @xmath190 .",

    "we show now that if we change the smooth structure on @xmath2 by declaring that only even functions of @xmath4 are smooth , i.e.introducing @xmath21 as the boundary defining function , then after a suitable conjugation and division by a vanishing factor the resulting operator smoothly and non - degenerately continues across the boundary , i.e.  continues to @xmath210 , where @xmath8 is the manifold @xmath2 with the new smooth structure .",
    "first , changing to coordinates @xmath29 , @xmath21 , we obtain @xmath211 now we conjugate by @xmath212 to obtain @xmath213 next we multiply by @xmath214 from both sides to obtain @xmath215    this operator is in @xmath216 , and now it continues smoothly across the boundary , by extending @xmath6 and @xmath208 in an arbitrary smooth manner .",
    "this form suffices for analyzing the problem for @xmath217 in a compact set , or indeed for @xmath217 going to infinity in a strip near the reals .",
    "however , it is convenient to modify it as we would like the resulting operator to be semiclassically elliptic when @xmath217 is away from the reals . we achieve this via conjugation by a smooth function , with exponent depending on @xmath217 .",
    "the latter would make no difference even semiclassically in the real regime as it is conjugation by an elliptic semiclassical fio .",
    "however , in the non - real regime ( where we would like ellipticity ) it does matter ; the present operator is not semiclassically elliptic at the zero section .",
    "so finally we conjugate by @xmath218 to obtain @xmath219 with @xmath220 smooth , real , vanishing at @xmath62 , @xmath221 and @xmath222 smooth .",
    "in fact , we have @xmath223 , but it is sometimes convenient to have more flexibility in the form of the operator since this means that we do not need to start from the relatively rigid form .    writing covectors as @xmath224 the principal symbol of @xmath225 , including in the high energy sense ( @xmath226 ) , is @xmath227 and is real for @xmath217 real .",
    "the hamilton vector field is @xmath228 where @xmath229 indicates that this is the hamilton vector field in @xmath230 , i.e.  with @xmath61 considered a parameter .",
    "correspondingly , the standard , ` classical ' , principal symbol is @xmath231 which is real , independent of @xmath217 , while the hamilton vector field is @xmath232    it is useful to keep in mind that as @xmath233 is formally self - adjoint relative to the metric density @xmath234 for @xmath217 real , so the same holds for @xmath235 ( as @xmath61 is real ) , and indeed for its conjugate by @xmath236 for @xmath217 real since this is merely unitary conjugation . as for @xmath53 real , @xmath111 formally self - adjoint relative to @xmath234 , @xmath237 is formally self - adjoint relative to @xmath238 , we then deduce that for @xmath239 real , @xmath66 is formally self - adjoint relative to @xmath240 as @xmath241 .",
    "note that @xmath242 thus extends to a @xmath11 density to @xmath243 , and we deduce that with respect to the extended density , @xmath244 vanishes when @xmath245 . since in general @xmath246 differs from @xmath247 by a zeroth order operator ,",
    "we conclude that @xmath248    we still need to check that @xmath61 can be appropriately chosen in the interior away from the region of validity of the product decomposition ( where we had no requirements so far on @xmath61 ) .",
    "this only matters for semiclassical purposes , and ( being smooth and non - zero in the interior ) the factor @xmath214 multiplying from both sides does not affect any of the relevant properties ( semiclassical ellipticity and possible non - trapping properties ) , so can be ignored  the same is true for @xmath217-independent powers of @xmath61 .    thus , near @xmath62 , but @xmath61 bounded away from @xmath35 , the only semiclassically non - trivial action we have done was to conjugate the operator by @xmath249 where @xmath250 ; we need to extend @xmath251 into the interior .",

    "next we analyze the hamilton flow at @xmath268 .",
    "first , @xmath276 and @xmath277 in terms of linearizing the flow at @xmath273 , @xmath278 and @xmath61 are equivalent as @xmath272 there , so one can simply use @xmath279 ( which is homogeneous of degree @xmath35 , like @xmath61 ) , in place of @xmath61 .",

    "it is convenient to rehomogenize in terms of @xmath282 .",
    "this can be phrased more invariantly by working with @xmath283 , briefly discussed in section  [ sec : notation ] .",
    "let @xmath73 be the image of @xmath268 in @xmath275 .",
    "homogeneous degree zero functions on @xmath284 , such as @xmath285 , can be regarded as functions on @xmath275 . for semiclassical purposes ,",
    "it is best to consider @xmath275 as the boundary at fiber infinity of the fiber - radial compactification @xmath286 of @xmath287 , also discussed in section  [ sec : notation ] .",
    "then at fiber infinity near @xmath273 , we can take @xmath288 as ( projective , rather than polar ) coordinates on the fibers of the cotangent bundle , with @xmath289 defining @xmath275 in @xmath286 .",
    "then @xmath290 is a @xmath11 vector field in this region and @xmath291 where @xmath292 vanishes cubically at @xmath273 . in similar notation",
    "we have @xmath293 and @xmath294 smooth ( indeed , homogeneous degree zero without the compactification ) vanishing at @xmath273 , and @xmath295 is also smooth , vanishing quadratically at @xmath273 .",
    "as the vanishing of @xmath296 and @xmath61 defines @xmath297 , we conclude that @xmath298 is a sink , while @xmath299 is a source , in the sense that all nearby bicharacteristics ( in fact , including semiclassical ( null)bicharacteristics , since @xmath300 contains the additional information needed ; see ) converge to @xmath73 as the parameter along the bicharacteristic goes to @xmath301 .",
    "in particular , the quadratic defining function of @xmath73 given by @xmath302 satisfies @xmath303    we also need information on the principal symbol of @xmath79 at the radial points . at @xmath73",
    "this is given by @xmath304 here @xmath305 is pulled out due to , namely its size relative to @xmath300 matters .",

    "so one should lose two orders a priori , i.e.  get an element of @xmath308 ; the characteristic nature of @xmath268 reduces the loss to @xmath309 , and the particular choice of exponent eliminates the loss .",

    "moreover , as @xmath315 and @xmath316 on @xmath317 , and @xmath61 only vanishes at @xmath318 there , for @xmath319 sufficiently small the @xmath11 function @xmath61 provides a negative global escape function on @xmath320 which is decreasing on @xmath321 , increasing on @xmath322 .",
    "correspondingly , bicharacteristics in @xmath322 travel from @xmath323 to @xmath72 , while in @xmath321 they travel from @xmath71 to @xmath323 .",

    "then the semiclassical principal symbol @xmath328 of @xmath329 is a function on @xmath287 , whose asymptotics at fiber infinity of @xmath287 is given by the classical principal symbol @xmath278 .",
    "we are interested in @xmath330 , which in semiclassical notation corresponds to @xmath331 .",
    "it is sometimes convenient to think of @xmath328 , and its rescaled hamilton vector field , as objects on @xmath286 .",
    "thus , @xmath332 so @xmath333 in particular , for @xmath254 non - real , @xmath334 implies @xmath335 , so @xmath336 near @xmath62 , i.e.  @xmath328 is semiclassically elliptic on @xmath287 , but _ not _ at fiber infinity , i.e.  at @xmath275 ( standard ellipticity is lost only in @xmath263 , of course ) . in @xmath259",
    "we have semiclassical ellipticity ( and automatically classical ellipticity ) by our choice of @xmath251 following .",
    "explicitly , if we introduce for instance @xmath337 as valid projective coordinates in a ( large ! ) neighborhood of @xmath73 in @xmath338 , then @xmath339 so @xmath340 which automatically vanishes at @xmath341 , i.e.  at @xmath275 .",
    "thus , for @xmath217 large and pure imaginary , the semiclassical problem adds no complexity to the ` classical ' quantum problem , but of course it does not simplify it .",
    "in fact , we need somewhat more information at the characteristic set , which is thus at @xmath341 when @xmath342 is bounded away from @xmath35 : @xmath343 which , as we recall in section  [ sec : microlocal ] , means that for @xmath329 with @xmath344 one can propagate estimates forwards along the bicharacteristics where @xmath345 ( in particular , away from @xmath71 , as the latter is a source ) and backwards where @xmath346 ( in particular , away from @xmath72 , as the latter is a sink ) , while for @xmath347 the directions are reversed since its semiclassical symbol is @xmath348 .",
    "the directions are also reversed if @xmath342 switches sign .",
    "this is important because it gives invertibility for @xmath349 ( corresponding to @xmath350 large positive , i.e.  the physical halfplane ) , but does not give invertibility for @xmath351 negative .",
    "we now return to the claim that even semiclassically , for @xmath254 almost real ( i.e.  when @xmath254 is not bounded away from the reals ; we are not fixing @xmath254 as we let @xmath6 vary ! ) , when the operator is not semiclassically elliptic on @xmath287 as mentioned above , the characteristic set can be divided into two components @xmath352 , with @xmath73 in different components .",
    "the vanishing of the factor following @xmath342 in gives a hypersurface that separates @xmath353 into two parts .",
    "indeed , this is the hypersurface given by @xmath354 on which , by , @xmath355 can not vanish , so @xmath356 farther in @xmath259 , the hypersurface is given , due to , by @xmath357 and on it , by , the real part is @xmath358 ; correspondingly @xmath359 in fact , more generally , the real part is @xmath360 so for @xmath361 , @xmath362 implies that @xmath328 does not vanish .",
    "correspondingly , only one of the two components of @xmath352 enter @xmath259 , namely for @xmath363 , only @xmath364 enters , while for @xmath365 , only @xmath366 enters .",
    "we finally need more information about the global semiclassical dynamics .",
    "there exists @xmath319 such that the following holds .",
    "all semiclassical null - bicharacteristics in @xmath367 go to either @xmath71 or to @xmath368 in the backward direction and to @xmath368 or @xmath323 in the forward direction , while all semiclassical null - bicharacteristics in @xmath369 go to @xmath72 or @xmath368 in the forward direction and to @xmath368 or @xmath323 in the backward direction .",
    "for @xmath363 , only @xmath364 enters @xmath259 , so the @xmath368 possibility only applies to @xmath364 then , while for @xmath365 , the analogous remark applies to @xmath366 .",
    "we assume that @xmath363 for the sake of definiteness .",
    "observe that the semiclassical hamilton vector field is @xmath370 here we are concerned about @xmath254 real .",
    "near @xmath371 , using the coordinates ( which are valid near the characteristic set ) @xmath372 with @xmath373 smooth .",
    "thus , @xmath374 is a smooth vector field on the compactified cotangent bundle , @xmath286 which is tangent to its boundary , @xmath275 , and @xmath375 ( with @xmath376 considered as a homogeneous degree zero vector field ) with @xmath377 smooth and tangent to @xmath275 .",
    "in particular , by and , using that @xmath378 is a quadratic defining function of @xmath73 , @xmath379 shows that there is @xmath380 such that in @xmath381 , @xmath345 , @xmath378 is strictly increasing along the hamilton flow except at @xmath71 , while in @xmath381 , @xmath346 , @xmath378 is strictly decreasing along the hamilton flow except at @xmath72 .",
    "indeed , all null - bicharacteristics in this neighborhood of @xmath73 except the constant ones at @xmath73 tend to @xmath73 in one direction and to @xmath382 in the other direction .",
    "choosing @xmath383 sufficiently small , the characteristic set in @xmath384 is disjoint from @xmath385 , and indeed only contains points in @xmath364 as @xmath363 . since @xmath386 , it is negative on @xmath387 . in particular",
    ", there is a neighborhood @xmath388 of @xmath62 in @xmath389 on which the same sign is preserved ; since the characteristic set in @xmath390 is compact , and is indeed a subset of @xmath391 , we deduce that @xmath392 is bounded below on @xmath393 , say @xmath394 there , so with @xmath395 , @xmath396 on @xmath397 . as @xmath396 at @xmath62 , bicharacteristics can only cross @xmath62 in the outward direction .",
    "thus , if @xmath208 is a bicharacteristic in @xmath364 , there are two possibilities .",
    "if @xmath208 is disjoint from @xmath398 , it has to go to @xmath368 in the backward direction and to @xmath323 in the forward direction .",
    "if @xmath208 has a point in @xmath398 , then it has to go to @xmath71 in the backward direction and to @xmath382 in the forward direction ; if @xmath399 by the time @xmath382 is reached , the result is proved , and otherwise @xmath396 in @xmath400 , @xmath401 , shows that the bicharacteristic goes to @xmath323 in the forward direction .",
    "if @xmath208 is a bicharacteristic in @xmath366 , only the second possibility exists , and the bicharacteristic can not leave @xmath398 in @xmath401 , so it reaches @xmath323 in the backward direction ( as the characteristic set is in @xmath263 ) .",
    "if we assume that @xmath0 is a non - trapping metric , i.e.bicharacteristics of @xmath0 in @xmath402 tend to @xmath12 in both the forward and the backward directions , then @xmath368 can be excluded from the statement of the lemma , and the above argument gives the following stronger conclusion : for sufficiently small @xmath319 , and for @xmath363 , any bicharacteristic in @xmath364 in @xmath403 has to go to @xmath71 in the backward direction , and to @xmath323 in the forward direction ( with the exception of the constant bicharacteristics at @xmath71 ) , while in @xmath366 , all bicharacteristics in @xmath404 lie in @xmath405 , and go to @xmath72 in the forward direction and to @xmath323 in the backward direction ( with the exception of the constant bicharacteristics at @xmath72 ) .",
    "in fact , for applications , it is also useful to remark that for sufficiently small @xmath319 , and for @xmath406 , @xmath407 indeed , as @xmath408 , the hypotheses imply @xmath409 and @xmath410 so @xmath411 , with @xmath281 vanishing at @xmath62 .",
    "thus , at points where @xmath412 vanishes , writing @xmath413 , @xmath414 now @xmath415 since @xmath416 is @xmath417 due to @xmath418 , @xmath419 is @xmath420 for the same reason , and @xmath421 and @xmath422 are @xmath417 due to @xmath423 , we deduce that @xmath424 for sufficiently small @xmath392 , so implies .",
    "thus , @xmath61 can be used for gluing constructions as in @xcite .",
    "the final step of fitting @xmath66 into our general microlocal framework is moving the problem to a compact manifold , and adding a complex absorbing second order operator .",
    "we thus consider a compact manifold without boundary @xmath134 for which @xmath425 , @xmath426 , with @xmath319 as above , is identified as an open subset with smooth boundary ; it is convenient to take @xmath134 to be the double of @xmath427 , so there are two copies of @xmath8 in @xmath134 .    in the case of hyperbolic space ,",
    "this doubling process can be realized from the perspective of @xmath428-dimensional minkowski space .",
    "then , as mentioned in the introduction , the poincar model shows up in two copies , namely in the interior of the future and past light cone inside the sphere at infinity , while de sitter space as the ` equatorial belt ' , i.e.  the exterior of the light cone at the sphere at infinity .",
    "one can take the minkowski equatorial plane , @xmath429 , as @xmath430 , and place the complex absorption there , thereby decoupling the future and past hemispheres .",
    "see @xcite for more detail .",
    "it is convenient to separate the ` classical ' ( i.e.  quantum ! ) and ` semiclassical ' problems , for in the former setting trapping for @xmath0 does not matter , while in the latter it does .",
    "we then introduce a ` complex absorption ' operator @xmath431 with real principal symbol @xmath432 supported in , say , @xmath433 , with the schwartz kernel also supported in the corresponding region ( i.e.in both factors on the product space this condition holds on the support ) such that @xmath434 is elliptic near @xmath435 , i.e.  near @xmath430 , and which satisfies that @xmath436 near @xmath437 .",
    "this can easily be done since @xmath75 are disjoint , and away from these @xmath278 is elliptic , hence so is @xmath438 regardless of the choice of @xmath432 ; we simply need to make @xmath432 to have support sufficiently close to @xmath75 , elliptic on @xmath75 at @xmath323 , with the appropriate sign near @xmath75 .",
    "having done this , we extend @xmath278 and @xmath432 to @xmath134 in such a way that @xmath434 are elliptic near @xmath435 ; the region we added is thus irrelevant at the level of bicharacteristic dynamics ( of @xmath278 ) in so far as it is decoupled from the dynamics in @xmath2 , and indeed also for analysis as we see shortly ( in so far as we have two essentially decoupled copies of the same problem ) .",
    "this is accomplished , for instance , by using the doubling construction to define @xmath278 on @xmath439 ( in a smooth fashion at @xmath435 , as can be easily arranged ; the holomorphic dependence of @xmath66 on @xmath217 is still easily preserved ) , and then , noting that the characteristic set of @xmath278 still has two connected components , making @xmath432 elliptic on the characteristic set of @xmath278 near @xmath435 , with the same sign in each component as near @xmath435 .",
    "( an alternative would be to make @xmath432 elliptic on the characteristic set of @xmath278 near @xmath439 ; it is just slightly more complicated to write down such a @xmath432 when the high energy behavior is taken into account . with the present choice , due to the doubling",
    ", there are essentially two copies of the problem on @xmath2 : the original , and the one from the doubling . )",
    "finally we take @xmath77 be any operator with principal symbol @xmath432 with schwartz kernel satisfying the desired support conditions and which depends on @xmath217 holomorphically .",
    "we may choose @xmath77 to be independent of @xmath217 so @xmath77 is indeed holomorphic ; in this case we may further replace it by @xmath440 if self - adjointness is desired .",
    "in view of subsection  [ subsec : global - char ] we have arranged the following .",
    "for @xmath441 , let @xmath442 , resp .",
    "@xmath443 denote the image of the forward , resp .",
    "backward , half - bicharacteristic of @xmath278 from @xmath115 .",
    "we write @xmath444 ( and say @xmath445 tends to @xmath73 ) if given any neighborhood @xmath446 of @xmath73 , @xmath447 ; by the source / sink property this implies that the points on the curve are in @xmath446 for sufficiently large ( in absolute value ) parameter values . then , with @xmath448 denoting the elliptic set of @xmath77 , @xmath449 that is , all forward and backward half-(null)bicharacteristics of @xmath66 either enter the elliptic set of @xmath77 , or go to @xmath268 , i.e.  @xmath73 in @xmath179 .",
    "the point of the arrangements regarding @xmath77 and the flow is that we are able to propagate estimates forward near where @xmath450 , backward near where @xmath451 , so by our hypotheses we can always propagate estimates for @xmath452 from @xmath268 towards the elliptic set of @xmath77 . on the other hand , for @xmath453 , we can propagate estimates from the elliptic set of @xmath77 towards @xmath268 .",
    "this behavior of @xmath452 vs.  @xmath453 is important for duality reasons .",
    "an alternative to the complex absorption would be simply adding a boundary at @xmath430 ; this is easy to do since this is a space - like hypersurface , but this is slightly unpleasant from the point of view of microlocal analysis as one has to work on a manifold with boundary ( though as mentioned this is easily done , see @xcite ) .    for the semiclassical problem ,",
    "when @xmath254 is almost real ( namely when @xmath342 is bounded away from @xmath35 we only need to make sure we do not mess up the semiclassical ellipticity in @xmath287 ) we need to increase the requirements on @xmath77 , and what we need to do depends on whether @xmath0 is non - trapping .",
    "if @xmath0 is non - trapping , we choose @xmath77 such that @xmath454 with semiclassical principal symbol @xmath455 , and in addition to the above requirement for the classical symbol , we need semiclassical ellipticity near @xmath430 , i.e.  that @xmath456 and its complex conjugate are elliptic near @xmath435 , i.e.  near @xmath430 , and which satisfies that for @xmath254 real @xmath457 on @xmath352 .",
    "again , we extend @xmath66 and @xmath77 to @xmath134 in such a way that @xmath458 and @xmath456 ( and thus their complex conjugates ) are elliptic near @xmath435 ; the region we added is thus irrelevant .",
    "this is straightforward to arrange if one ignores that one wants @xmath77 to be holomorphic : one easily constructs a function @xmath455 on @xmath156 ( taking into account the disjointness of @xmath352 ) , and defines @xmath459 to be @xmath460 times the semiclassical quantization of @xmath455 ( or any other operator with the same semiclassical and standard principal symbols ) . indeed ,",
    "for our purposes this would suffice since we want high energy estimates for the analytic continuation resolvent on the original space @xmath2 ( which we will know exists by the non - semiclassical argument ) , and as we shall see , the resolvent is given by the same formula in terms of @xmath461 independently whether @xmath77 is holomorphic in @xmath217 ( as long as it satisfies the other properties ) , so there is no need to ensure the holomorphy of @xmath77 .",
    "however , it is instructive to have an example of a holomorphic family @xmath77 in a strip at least : in view of we can take ( with @xmath117 ) @xmath462 where @xmath463 is supported near @xmath464 ; the corresponding full symbol is @xmath465 and @xmath77 is taken as a quantization of this full symbol . here",
    "the square root is defined on @xmath466 , with real part of the result being positive , and correspondingly @xmath467 is defined away from @xmath468 .",
    "note that @xmath469 is an elliptic symbol in @xmath470 as long as @xmath471 , so the corresponding statement also holds for its square root .",
    "while @xmath467 is only holomorphic away from @xmath472 , the full ( and indeed the semiclassical and standard principal ) symbols are actually holomorphic in cones near infinity , and indeed e.g.  via convolutions by the fourier transform of a compactly supported function can be extended to be holomorphic in @xmath46 , but this is of no importance here .",
    "if @xmath0 is trapping , we need to add complex absorption inside @xmath2 as well , at @xmath368 , so we relax the requirement that @xmath77 is supported in @xmath473 to support in @xmath474 , but we require in addition to the other classical requirements that @xmath456 and its complex conjugate are elliptic near @xmath475 , and which satisfies that @xmath457 on @xmath352 .",
    "this can be achieved as above for @xmath61 near @xmath464 .",
    "again , we extend @xmath66 and @xmath77 to @xmath134 in such a way that @xmath458 and @xmath456 ( and thus their complex conjugates ) are elliptic near @xmath435 .    in either of these semiclassical cases we have arranged that for sufficiently small @xmath57 , @xmath456 and its complex conjugate are _ semiclassically non - trapping _ for @xmath476 , namely the bicharacteristics from any point in @xmath477 flow to @xmath478 ( i.e.  either enter @xmath479 at some finite time , or tend to @xmath72 ) in the forward direction , and to @xmath480 in the backward direction . here",
    "@xmath57 arises from the particularly simple choice of @xmath455 for which semiclassical ellipticity is easy to check for @xmath344 ( bounded away from @xmath35 ) and small ; a more careful analysis would give a specific value of @xmath481 , and a more careful choice of @xmath455 would give a better result .",
    "first , recall the basic elliptic and microhyperbolic regularity results .",
    "let @xmath482 denote the @xmath483 wave front set of a distribution @xmath484 , i.e.  @xmath485 if there exists @xmath486 elliptic at @xmath115 such that @xmath487 .",

    "analogous conclusions apply to @xmath453 ; since both @xmath278 and @xmath432 are real , @xmath458 is elliptic if and only if @xmath490 is .",
    "we also have real principal type propagation , in the usual form valid outside @xmath491 : @xmath492 is a union of maximally extended bicharacteristics of @xmath269 in the characteristic set @xmath274 of @xmath66 .",

    "the only part that is not immediate by what has been discussed is the last claim .",
    "this follows immediately , however , by microlocal solvability in arbitrary ordered sobolev spaces away from the radial points ( i.e.  solvability modulo @xmath11 , with semiclassical estimates ) , combined with our preceding results to deal with this smooth remainder plus the contribution near @xmath822 , which are assumed to be in @xmath823 .",
    "this result is needed for gluing constructions as in @xcite , namely polynomially bounded trapping with appropriate microlocal geometry can be glued to our resolvent .",
    "furthermore , it gives non - trapping estimates microlocally away from the trapped set provided the overall ( trapped ) resolvent is polynomially bounded as shown by datchev and vasy @xcite .",
    "we now state our results in the original conformally compact setting . without the non - trapping estimate , these are a special case of a result of mazzeo and melrose @xcite , with improvements by guillarmou @xcite , with ` special ' meaning that evenness is assumed . if the space is asymptotic to actual hyperbolic space , the non - trapping estimate is a slightly stronger version of the estimate of @xcite , where it is shown by a parametrix construction ; here conformal infinity can have arbitrary geometry .",
    "the point is thus that first , we do not need the machinery of the zero calculus here , second , we do have non - trapping high energy estimates in general ( and without a parametrix construction ) , and third , we add the semiclassically outgoing property which is useful for resolvent gluing , including for proving non - trapping bounds microlocally away from trapping , provided the latter is mild , as shown by datchev and vasy @xcite .",
    "[ thm : conf - compact - high ] suppose that @xmath48 is an @xmath42-dimensional manifold with boundary with an even conformally compact metric and boundary defining function @xmath4 .",
    "let @xmath8 denote the even version of @xmath2 , i.e.  with the boundary defining function replaced by its square with respect to a decomposition in which @xmath0 is even .",
    "then the inverse of @xmath43 written as @xmath44 , has a meromorphic continuation from @xmath45 to @xmath46 , @xmath47 with poles with finite rank residues . if in addition @xmath48 is non - trapping , then , with @xmath251 as in subsection  [ subsec : laplacian - extension ] , and for suitable @xmath57 , non - trapping estimates hold in every region @xmath58 , @xmath50 : for @xmath51 , @xmath824 if @xmath53 is supported in @xmath54 , the @xmath55 norm on @xmath53 can be replaced by the @xmath56 norm .",
    "furthermore , for @xmath363 , @xmath825 , the resolvent @xmath826 is _ semiclassically outgoing with a loss of @xmath60 _ in the sense that if @xmath53 has compact support in @xmath54 , @xmath827 is in the semiclassical characteristic set and if @xmath828 is disjoint from the backward bicharacteristic from @xmath115 , then @xmath829 .",
    "we remark that although in order to go through without changes , our methods require the evenness property , it is not hard to deduce more restricted results without this . essentially one would have operators with coefficients that have a conormal singularity at the event horizon ; as long as this is sufficiently mild relative to what is required for the analysis , it does not affect the results .",
    "the problems arise for the analytic continuation , when one needs strong function spaces ( @xmath483 with @xmath537 large ) ; these are not preserved when one multiplies by the singular coefficients .      by self - adjointness and positivity of @xmath830 and as @xmath10 is in its domain , @xmath831 has a unique solution @xmath832 when when @xmath45 .",
    "on the other hand , let @xmath251 be as in subsection  [ subsec : laplacian - extension ] , so @xmath833 near @xmath62 ( so @xmath834 there ) , @xmath835 in @xmath836 , and @xmath837 still vanishes to infinite order at @xmath62 .",
    "let @xmath838 be an arbitrary smooth extension of @xmath837 to the compact manifold @xmath134 on which @xmath839 is defined .",
    "let @xmath840 , with @xmath841 given by our results in section  [ sec : microlocal ] ; this satisfies @xmath842 and @xmath843 .",
    "thus , @xmath844 satisfies @xmath845 , and @xmath846 by and ( as @xmath77 is supported in @xmath796 ) . since @xmath847 for @xmath848 , by the aforementioned uniqueness , @xmath849 .    to make the extension from @xmath8 to @xmath134 more systematic ,",
    "let @xmath850 be a continuous extension operator , @xmath851 the restriction map . then",
    ", as we have just seen , for @xmath852 , @xmath853 while , for the sake of simplicity , @xmath854 is constructed in subsection  [ subsec : complex - absorb - ds ] in such a manner that it is not holomorphic in all of @xmath810 due to a cut in the upper half plane , this cut can be moved outside any fixed compact subset , so taking into account that @xmath78 is independent of the choice of @xmath854 , the theorem follows immediately from the results of section  [ sec : microlocal ] .",
    "our argument proves that every pole of @xmath78 is a pole of @xmath76 ( for otherwise would show @xmath78 does not have a pole either ) , but it is possible for @xmath76 to have poles which are not poles of @xmath78 .",
    "however , in the latter case , the laurent coefficients of @xmath76 would be annihilated by multiplication by @xmath855 from the left ,",
    "i.e.  the resonant states ( which are smooth ) would be supported in @xmath263 , in particular vanish to infinite order at @xmath62 .",
    "in fact , a stronger statement can be made : by a calculation completely analogous to what we just performed , we can easily see that in @xmath796 , @xmath66 is a conjugate ( times a power of @xmath61 ) of a klein - gordon - type operator on @xmath42-dimensional de sitter space with @xmath62 being the boundary ( i.e.  where time goes to infinity ) .",
    "thus , if @xmath217 is not a pole of @xmath78 and @xmath856 then one would have a solution @xmath32 of this klein - gordon - type equation near @xmath62 , i.e.  infinity , that rapidly vanishes at infinity .",
    "it is shown in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition  5.3 ) by a carleman - type estimate that this can not happen ; although there @xmath857 is assumed , the argument given there goes through almost verbatim in general .",
    "thus , if @xmath77 is supported in @xmath858 , @xmath859 , then @xmath860 is also supported in @xmath858 .",
    "this argument can be iterated for laurent coefficients of higher order poles ; their range ( which is finite dimensional ) contains only functions supported in @xmath858 .",
    "[ rem : ah - decay ] we now return to our previous remarks regarding the fact that our solution disallows the conormal singularities @xmath861 from the perspective of conformally compact spaces of dimension @xmath42 . recalling that @xmath21 , the two indicial roots on these spaces correspond to the asymptotics @xmath862 in @xmath259 .",
    "thus for the operator @xmath863 or indeed @xmath66 , they correspond to @xmath864 here the indicial root @xmath865 corresponds to the smooth solutions we construct for @xmath66 , while @xmath866 corresponds to the conormal behavior we rule out .",
    "back to the original laplacian , thus , @xmath867 is the allowed asymptotics and @xmath868 is the disallowed one . notice that @xmath869 , so the disallowed solution is growing at @xmath62 relative to the allowed one , as expected in the physical half plane , and the behavior reverses when @xmath870 .",
    "thus , in the original asymptotically hyperbolic picture one has to distinguish two different rates of growths , whose relative size changes .",
    "on the other hand , in our approach , we rule out the singular solution and allow the non - singular ( smooth one ) , so there is no change in behavior at all for the analytic continuation .",
    "[ rem : asymp - ds ] for _ even _ asymptotically de sitter metrics on an @xmath42-dimensional manifold @xmath871 with boundary , the methods for asymptotically hyperbolic spaces work , except @xmath452 and @xmath453 switch roles , which does not affect fredholm properties , see remark  [ rem : dual - fredholm ] . again",
    ", evenness means that we may choose a product decomposition near the boundary such that @xmath872 there , where @xmath6 is an even family of riemannian metrics ; as above , we take @xmath4 to be a globally defined boundary defining function . then with @xmath873 , so @xmath874 is the lorentzian region , @xmath875 in place of @xmath217 ( recalling that our aim is to get to @xmath453 ) the above calculations for @xmath876 in place of @xmath877 leading to all go through with @xmath61 replaced by @xmath878 , @xmath217 replaced by @xmath875 and @xmath209 replaced by @xmath879 . letting @xmath880 , and conjugating by @xmath881 as above , yields @xmath882 modulo terms that can be absorbed into the error terms in operators in the class , i.e.  this is indeed of the form @xmath453 in the framework of subsection  [ subsec : complex - absorb - ds ] , at least near @xmath883 .",
    "if now @xmath871 is extended to a manifold without boundary in such a way that in @xmath884 , i.e.  @xmath259 , one has a classically elliptic , semiclassically non - trapping problem , then all the results of section  [ sec : microlocal ] are applicable ."
