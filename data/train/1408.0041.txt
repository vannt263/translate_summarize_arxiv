    "ultrashort pulses are used frequently in modern applications ranging from femtochemistry and medical imaging to micro - machining and optical communications .",
    "consequently the study and modeling of such pulses is an important area of research .",
    "kerr - lens mode locking ( klm ) is a common technique used to generate these pulses .",
    "in fact , following the discovery of klm mode - locked ( ml ) lasers have revolutionized the field of ultrafast science and their performance has led to their widespread use .",
    "mode - locked lasers operate under the requirement that sufficient amounts of gain and loss are present , otherwise , they are subject to radiation - mode instability . in addition",
    ", passive mode - locking generally utilizes fast saturable absorbers which are effectively simulated by klm .",
    "saturable absorbers are commonly modeled by a transfer function and as such loss is placed periodically during the evolution and not as part of a distributed model , i.e. , an evolution equation . however , the qualitative features are the same in both cases @xcite thus indicating that distributive models are very good descriptions of modes in mode - locked lasers",
    ".    modeling these lasers must take into account their physical properties .",
    "for this , the distributive power - energy saturation ( pes ) model was recently introduced @xcite .",
    "this system is a variant of the well known nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equation with additional terms to account for gain and spectral filtering , saturated with energy , and loss , saturated with power .",
    "it is a generalization of the commonly used master - equation @xcite which is obtained as a limiting case .",
    "mode - locking is much more robust in the pes model than in the master - equation . indeed , while in the master - equation mode - locking is achieved only for a narrow range of parameters @xcite , the pes equation has only one key requirement for mode - locking : sufficient gain .",
    "another important feature of the pes equation is that it leads to physically relevant results for both the anomalous and normal dispersive regimes .",
    "solitons in ml lasers are fundamentally different in the two dispersive regimes . pulse formation , in the anomalous regime , is typically dominated by the interplay between dispersion and nonlinearity .",
    "suitable gain media and an effective saturable absorber are required for initiation of pulsed operation .",
    "in contrast , pulses found in the normal regime are positively chirped throughout the cavity @xcite .",
    "they are comprised of an approximately parabolic temporal amplitude profile near the peak of the pulse with a transition to steep decay @xcite .",
    "pulses in the normal regime have a much larger temporal width than those in the anomalous regime .    here",
    "we study the response of a ml laser under higher order effects using the pes equation .",
    "these effects include third - order dispersion ( tod ) , self - steepening and raman gain .",
    "previous studies , in the anomalous dispersion regime , include variants of the master - equation @xcite and generalized ginzburg - landau type equations @xcite . in the normal regime recent experiments @xcite",
    "indicate that similariton ( self - similar ) evolution in these fiber lasers results in localized modes , i.e. solitons , which are broad in the time domain ; they are robust against perturbations .",
    "the effect of tod on self - similar evolution and parabolic pulses was studied in refs .",
    "@xcite .    here",
    "we focus on the equation @xmath0 where @xmath1 represents gain saturated with the energy @xmath2 , @xmath3 represents tod , @xmath4 self - steepening and @xmath5 the raman gain . the parameters @xmath6 and @xmath7 correspond to a measure of the saturation energy and power of the system , respectively .",
    "unless otherwise stated all parameters , except @xmath8 , are positive .",
    "when @xmath9 this equation is the pes model .",
    "finally , other linear and higher order nonlinear dissipative terms , such as terms proportional to @xmath10 and @xmath11 are included in eq . as limiting cases in the expansion for the saturable terms and will not be considered here .",
    "here we consider eq . with @xmath12 and we start our analysis by analyzing the effect of tod . to do so , we fix the parameters such that @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 while @xmath16 and vary the gain parameter @xmath1 .",
    "a unit gaussian is evolved under eq . with the resulting evolution shown in fig .",
    "[ tod ] .     and ( b ) @xmath17 .",
    "the bottom figures show the pulse at a distance @xmath18 ( a sufficient distance of propagation after mode - locking has occurred ) .",
    "the dashed lines correspond to the relative classical nls solitons.,title=\"fig:\",width=240 ] +   and ( b ) @xmath17 .",
    "the bottom figures show the pulse at a distance @xmath18 ( a sufficient distance of propagation after mode - locking has occurred ) .",
    "the dashed lines correspond to the relative classical nls solitons.,title=\"fig:\",width=240 ]    as seen here , the initial gaussian undergoes a locking procedure and subsequently locks to a pulse of constant height / shape . after that happens the effect of tod shifts the soliton with constant velocity ( seen as a straight line for the soliton center in the top of fig .",
    "[ tod ] ) . interestingly the resulting mode is a solution of the unperturbed nls equation .",
    "furthermore , when the gain is increased the angle of the displacement becomes more acute .",
    "this is reminiscent of the response of a single soliton of the classical nls equation to tod . indeed , recall that under tod the nls soliton is slowed down and as a result the soliton peak is shifted by an amount that increases linearly with distance @xcite .",
    "similarly , we repeat the analysis for @xmath19 and @xmath20 so as to study the response to self - steepening .",
    "the resulting evolution is depicted in fig .",
    "[ steepening ] .     and ( b ) @xmath17 .",
    "profiles of mode - locked pulses resemble those of fig .",
    "[ tod ] ( bottom).,width=240 ]    the similarities between figs .",
    "[ tod ] and [ steepening ] are remarkable .",
    "indeed , after mode - locking occurs the pulse is shifted linearly in a way that is similar to the way a classical nls soliton propagates under this effect .    finally , we repeat the analysis for @xmath21 and @xmath22 so as to study the response to the raman gain .",
    "the resulting evolution is depicted in fig .",
    "[ raman ] .     and ( b ) @xmath17 .",
    "profiles of mode - locked pulses resemble those of fig .",
    "[ tod ] ( bottom).,width=240 ]    the phenomenon is repeated only now the displacement is sharper .",
    "again , recall that raman gain on solitons of the classical nls equation gives rise to the so - called self - frequency shift @xcite . note the size of the pulse amplitude is largely unaffected .",
    "it is also important to stress that this locking behavior strongly depends on the saturation terms . if these terms / effects are absent more complicated dynamics can occur @xcite",
    "now we shall explain the above features using soliton perturbation theory valid for small @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 .",
    "this approach leads to very good qualitative results since when @xmath9 general initial conditions , such as unit gaussians , will evolve to solitons of the unperturbed classical nls equation @xcite . to do this",
    ", we consider a solution ansatz for eq . of the form @xmath23e^{i\\phi(z)-i\\sigma(z)t}\\ ] ] under the effect of the perturbed pes the soliton parameters evolve according to @xcite    @xmath24    [ pert ]    when the pulse has mode - locked , the zeroes of the right hand side of eq .",
    "- give the stationary solutions for @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "we denote the mode locked value of @xmath25 and @xmath26 as @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively . as such when",
    "the equilibrium has been reached @xmath29 this results in the following equation for @xmath25 @xmath30}{75 ( \\tau + 2\\epsilon\\tau \\eta   ) } \\\\ & - \\frac{{2l{{\\tanh } ^ { - 1}}\\left (    { \\frac{{\\sqrt \\delta   \\eta } } { { \\sqrt { 1 + \\delta { \\eta ^2 } } } } } \\right)}}{{\\sqrt { \\delta    +    { \\delta ^2}{\\eta ^2 } } } } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "clearly , @xmath25 has at least one equilibrium at @xmath31 . to understand its stability",
    "consider the first derivative of @xmath32 with respect to @xmath25 evaluated at @xmath31 , @xmath33 when @xmath34 is an unstable equilibrium while for @xmath35 is stable .",
    "the phase portrait for various values of @xmath36 indicates that @xmath32 is a monotonic decreasing function in @xmath25 and so @xmath37 as @xmath38 for any initial condition @xmath39 .",
    "physically this corresponds to loss overtaking gain and the pulse decays . for @xmath40 , @xmath32 is initially positive and as @xmath25 increases the filtering term becomes dominant and @xmath32 takes on negative values .",
    "thus , there must exist another equilibrium .",
    "plotting the phase portrait for various values of @xmath1 for @xmath40 shows there is a single stable equilibrium for @xmath39 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ etaphase ] .     illustrating the single stable equilibrium . here",
    "@xmath41.,width=288 ]    as @xmath25 approaches its stable equilibrium , @xmath42 , and @xmath26 approaches its stable equilibrium , @xmath28 , the system of equations tend to @xmath43 which means the solition tends to a particular nls soliton of speed zero and height / width determined by @xmath27 , thus suggesting the mode - locking capabilities of eq .",
    "( [ pes ] ) .",
    "in fact , @xmath27 is an attractor that any arbitrary initial condition will eventually converge to , even when it is far way from its soliton solution @xcite .",
    "after @xmath44 and mode - locking has been completed , we consider eq . - , which , interestingly , are independent of @xmath45 . this now explains the above dynamics .",
    "indeed , when @xmath46 ( and the mode - locking mechanism has been completed ) we get by direct integration of eq .",
    "@xmath47\\eta_{ml } ^3}{25 \\tau ^2}\\right\\}z \\label{t0}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the equations for the equilibria give now more insight as to the way each term affects the propagation .",
    "for instance , in the absence of spectral filtering there still exists a stable ( nonzero ) equilibrium for @xmath25 but not for @xmath26 .",
    "while the amplitude is affected only in its magnitude the other quantities change in a more prominent way .",
    "indeed , by direct integration of eqs . and",
    "we obtain at @xmath46 @xmath48 z^2\\nonumber\\\\ & + [ ( \\beta+\\gamma)\\eta_{ml}^2 + 3\\beta\\sigma^2(0)-3\\sigma(0)]z+t_0(0)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which suggests that the trajectory the soliton follows is no longer linear .",
    "similarly when the raman gain is not considered the only equilibrium is found for @xmath49 .",
    "clearly when @xmath50 the soliton moves with constant velocity equal to @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) . also , note that as supported by the numerical computations the final amplitude of the pulse is not affected by the parameters @xmath53 .",
    "the increase of @xmath25 with @xmath1 also explains the pronounced difference in the speed of the pulse when @xmath1 is increased . in fig .",
    "[ eta_g ] we depict the dependance of the amplitude to the gain parameter , which attests to that .        in fact , eq",
    ". clearly suggests that the trajectories are highly dependent on powers of @xmath27 .",
    "hence , any increase on this amplitude is enhanced ( when @xmath54 or @xmath55 ) making the response to the perturbations more pronounced .",
    "this analysis also suggests that nonlinear phase shifts can not compensate for tod ( or self - steepening ) in this regime , unlike in the normal regime @xcite .",
    "thus , the mode - locking mechanism can now be summarized as follows : ( i ) solve eqs .",
    "- , to determine @xmath27 and @xmath28 ; ( ii ) assume the mode - locking mechanism has been completed ; ( iii ) treat the pulses as classical nls solitons ; and ( iv ) use eq . and to determine the adiabatic change of the rest of the soliton parameters .",
    "we turn our attention to the normal regime ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "the main difference these pulses exhibit from their anomalous regime counterparts is that they are highly chirped , very wide ( almost parabolic ) pulses in the time domain ; the modes depend critically on the values of @xmath57 .",
    "recent experiments indicate that localized modes solitons in the normal regime are robust .",
    "they are not affected by perturbations @xcite such as tod and self steepening ; this is also in agreement with the observation that nonlinear phase shifts ( in terms of raman gain here ) can compensate for tod or self - steepening @xcite . to demonstrate this phenomena , we evolve a unit gaussian under eq . , with all parameters as before ( @xmath13 , @xmath58 ) only now with @xmath59 .",
    "the reason for this increase in gain is the nature / size of these pulses ( cf .",
    "[ similariton ] ) .     and",
    "( b ) under the pes with the higher order effects included .",
    "the bottom figure depicts the final pulse .",
    "the dashed line is the soliton of the unperturbed pes equation.,title=\"fig:\",width=240 ] +   and ( b ) under the pes with the higher order effects included .",
    "the bottom figure depicts the final pulse .",
    "the dashed line is the soliton of the unperturbed pes equation.,title=\"fig:\",width=240 ]    since these pulses are much wider one expects that more energy ( gain ) is required for pulses to lock to noticeable amplitudes .",
    "furthermore , in fig . [ similariton ] ( bottom )",
    "we depict the resulting pulse and its corresponding phase .",
    "the dashed line indicates the soliton of the unperturbed ( i.e. @xmath9 ) pes equation .",
    "indeed the experimental observations @xcite on the shape and phase of the pulses are met .",
    "we also confirm subsequent observations that unlike the solitons of the anomalous regime these wide localized pulses are resistant to perturbations even when allowed to propagate for greater distances .",
    "following the theory developed in ref .",
    "@xcite we write the solution of eq .",
    "( [ pes ] ) in the form @xmath60 , where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the pulse amplitude and phase respectively .",
    "since these pulses are slowly varying in @xmath63 , with large phase , we can introduce a slow time scale in the equation and using perturbation theory , the soliton system can be reduced to simpler ordinary differential equations for the amplitude and the phase of the pulse . substituting into the equation and equating real and imaginary parts",
    "we get    @xmath64    [ real.imag ]    where we have replaced @xmath65 since we are in the normal dispersion regime .",
    "we then take the characteristic time length of the pulse to be such that we can define a scaling in the independent variable of the form @xmath66 or @xmath67 so that @xmath68 , @xmath69 ( i.e. @xmath70 is large ) and @xmath71 where @xmath72",
    ". furthermore in the above simulations @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are all @xmath73",
    ". then eq .",
    "( [ real ] ) becomes @xmath74 while the leading order equation is @xmath75 using the same argument and this newly derived eq .",
    "( [ real2 ] ) we then find that eq .",
    "( [ imag ] ) to leading order reads @xmath76 this is now a nonlocal first order differential equation for @xmath61 , since @xmath77 .",
    "we also note that imposing @xmath78 .    to remove the nonlocality another condition is needed and it is based on the singular points of eq .",
    "( [ imag2 ] ) .",
    "recall , @xmath79 is a decaying function in @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "thus there exists a point in @xmath63 such that the denominator in the equation becomes zero . to remove the singularity we require that the numerator of the equation is also zero at the same point which leads to @xmath82 thus eq .",
    "( [ imag2 ] ) is now a first order equation which can be solved by standard numerical methods and analyzed by phase plane methods .",
    "the resulting solutions from the pes equation and the reduced equations are compared in fig .",
    "[ compare ] .",
    "remarkably , in the normal regime the pes also exhibits higher - order solutions in term of bi - solitons @xcite .",
    "these are pairs of regular solitons whose peak amplitudes have a @xmath83 difference in phase and an appropriate separation .",
    "they , also , differ significantly from the higher - order solutions of the classical nls and the dispersion managed solitons since they do not exhibit any oscillatory or breathing behavior as they propagate in the cavity .",
