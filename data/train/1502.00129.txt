    "this implies that in fact @xmath28 must be contained in @xmath27 , which means that the fixed trees are not in fact disjoint .",

    "since @xmath38 and @xmath39 commute with @xmath29 , they must preserve the axis of @xmath29 setwise .",
    "hence we can find integers @xmath40 with @xmath41 so that each of @xmath42 and @xmath43 fix the axis of @xmath29 pointwise , in particular the subgroup @xmath44 stabilizes an edge of @xmath21 .",
    "thus @xmath44 is abelian , which can only happen if @xmath38 and @xmath39 commute .",
    "this shows that @xmath32 is a clique . by the same proof , if @xmath45 is hyperbolic",
    ", then @xmath46 is a clique and hence @xmath47 .",
    "thus , if @xmath48 , then @xmath49 is disconnected .",
    "( theorem [ mainthm ] ) suppose that @xmath0 is connected and not a complete graph , and suppose that @xmath1 acts on a tree @xmath21 with no global fixed points and abelian edge stabilizers .",
    "we use the action of @xmath1 on @xmath21 to find a separating clique in @xmath0 .",
    "first , suppose that some @xmath34 acts hyperbolically on @xmath21 .",
    "then by lemma [ l : hyp vert ] , @xmath32 is a clique and hence not all of @xmath0 .",
    "then @xmath30 is a clique which separates @xmath29 from @xmath50 , so @xmath0 contains a separating clique .",
    "thus , we may suppose that each vertex of @xmath0 acts elliptically on @xmath21 .",
    "since the action has no global fixed point , it follows from helly s theorem that for some @xmath51 , @xmath52 .",
    "let @xmath53 be the shortest path between @xmath54 and @xmath55 , and let @xmath28 be a point in the interior of an edge on @xmath53 which is not in @xmath54 or @xmath55 .",
    "we define a map @xmath56 as follows : first choose @xmath57 and @xmath58 and define @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "now for vertices @xmath38 such that @xmath61 , define @xmath62 . for any other vertex @xmath63 of @xmath0 , choose some @xmath64 and define @xmath65 .",
    "for an edge @xmath66 of @xmath0 between vertices @xmath38 and @xmath29 , let @xmath67 continuously map @xmath66 onto the ( possibly degenerate ) geodesic between @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "this defines a continuous map @xmath56 .",
    "lemma [ l : fix intersect ] implies ( for vertices @xmath38 and @xmath29 which are adjacent in @xmath0 ) that @xmath70 , hence @xmath71 .",
    "consequently we have @xmath72 .    since @xmath0 is connected and @xmath67 is continuous , the image @xmath73 is connected .",
    "this implies that @xmath74 .",
    "hence @xmath75 is a non - empty subgraph of @xmath0 , and since @xmath28 separates @xmath73 ( since @xmath21 is a tree ) , @xmath75 separates @xmath0 .",
    "the subgroup generated by the vertices of @xmath75 all fix the edge containing @xmath28 , hence this subgroup is abelian and therefore @xmath75 is a separating clique .",
    "suppose that @xmath0 is a finite connected graph . in this section",
    ", we build a jsj decomposition for @xmath1 , a decomposition which in some sense encodes all possible abelian splittings of @xmath1 . however , we first restrict our attention to those splittings in which each vertex of @xmath0 acts elliptically .",
    "the reason for this restriction is that actions with hyperbolic vertices all arise through simplicial actions of @xmath76 on a line , and such an action can be easily modified to make @xmath76 act elliptically . indeed , suppose @xmath1 acts on a tree @xmath21 with abelian edge stabilizers such that some @xmath34 acts hyperbolically . by lemma [ l : hyp vert ] , @xmath32 is a clique and hence @xmath77 for some @xmath78 .",

    "let @xmath82 .",
    "by lemma [ l : hyp vert ] , @xmath1 has the splitting @xmath83 furthermore this splitting is compatible with the splitting of @xmath84 induced by its action on @xmath21 since @xmath85 acts elliptically on @xmath21 .",
    "hence we get a new splitting of @xmath1 such that @xmath29 is elliptic and the induced splitting of @xmath84 is the same as the splitting induced by its action on @xmath21 . repeating this procedure , any abelian splitting of @xmath1 can be replaced by a splitting in which all vertices act elliptically .",
    "we call such a splitting a _",
    "vertex - elliptic abelian _ splitting .",
    "let @xmath86 be the corresponding graph of groups decomposition of @xmath1 , and let @xmath20 be the underlying graph of @xmath86 .",
    "then there is a natural surjective map @xmath87 which maps the elliptic elements of @xmath1 to the identity .",
    "but @xmath1 is generated by elliptic elements , so @xmath88 which means that @xmath20 is a tree .",
    "we will use the language of guirardel - levitt @xcite in order to describe the vertex - elliptic abelian jsj decomposition of @xmath1 . given @xmath1 ,",
    "let @xmath89 be the set of abelian subgroups of @xmath1 and @xmath90 .",
    "if @xmath1 acts on a tree @xmath21 such that each edge stabilizer is abelian and each vetex of @xmath0 is elliptic , then @xmath21 is called an @xmath91-tree .",
    "an @xmath91-tree @xmath21 is called _ universally elliptic _ if the edge stabilizers of @xmath21 are elliptic in every other @xmath91-tree . also ,",
    "given trees @xmath21 and @xmath92 , we say @xmath21 _ dominates _",
    "@xmath92 if every vertex stabilizer of @xmath21 is elliptic with respect to @xmath92 .    a graph of groups decomposition @xmath86 of @xmath1",
    "is called a _",
    "vertex - elliptic abelian jsj - decomposition of @xmath1 _ if the corresponding bass - serre tree @xmath21 is an @xmath91-tree which is universally elliptic and which dominates every other universally elliptic @xmath91-tree .",
    "we will now build a vertex - elliptic abelian jsj decomposition for the group @xmath1 .",
    "if @xmath0 has no separating cliques then this jsj decomposition is trivial .",
    "otherwise , suppose that the minimal size of a separating clique in @xmath0 is @xmath93 .",
    "let @xmath94 be the collection of all separating cliques of size @xmath93 .",
    "each @xmath95 defines a vertex - elliptic abelian splitting of @xmath1 as follows .",
    "the underlying graph of the splitting is a tree with a valence - one vertex for each component @xmath96 of @xmath97 , all adjacent to single central vertex .",
    "the vertex corresponding to @xmath96 has associated vertex group @xmath98 , while the central vertex has vertex group @xmath99 .",
    "all of the edge groups correspond to @xmath99 in the natural way . in case",
    "there are only two components of @xmath97 , this is a reducible two - edge splitting , which can be transformed into a one - edge splitting in the obvious way .    by lemma [ l : clique elliptic ]",
    "each @xmath100 is elliptic in the splitting defined by @xmath95 .",
    "therefore , the splittings with edge groups @xmath99 can be refined into a single ( vertex - elliptic abelian ) splitting @xmath101 of @xmath1 .",
    "the vertex groups of @xmath101 naturally correspond to connected subgraphs of @xmath0 . for each such subgraph @xmath102",
    "we can repeat this procedure with any separating cliques of minimal size that it has ( they are necessarily of size larger than @xmath93 ) . since we are only considering vertex - elliptic splittings , lemma [ l : clique elliptic ] implies that any such splitting of @xmath103 can be extended to a vertex - elliptic abelian splitting of @xmath1 in an obvious way .",
    "eventually , we find a vertex - elliptic abelian splitting @xmath86 of @xmath1 so that the subgraphs associated to the vertex groups are connected and contain no separating cliques .",
    "see figure [ fig1 ] for an example where one edge adjacent to each reducible valence two vertex has been contracted .",
    "let @xmath21 be the bass - serre tree corresponding to @xmath86 .",
    "note that , up to conjugation , each edge stabilizer in @xmath21 is of the form @xmath17 , where @xmath10 is a clique inside of @xmath0 .",
    "suppose @xmath1 acts on another @xmath91-tree @xmath92 .",
    "then by lemma [ l : clique elliptic ] , for every clique @xmath10 of @xmath0 , @xmath17 acts elliptically on @xmath92 , hence @xmath21 is universally elliptic .    next we show that for any @xmath104-tree @xmath92 , @xmath21 dominates @xmath92 . up to conjugation ,",
    "each vertex stabilizer of @xmath21 is of the form @xmath84 , where @xmath105 is a connected subgraph of @xmath0 which has no separating cliques . if @xmath105 is a clique , then @xmath84 acts elliptically on @xmath92 by the previous paragraph .",
    "if @xmath105 is not a clique , then @xmath84 must act elliptically on @xmath92 otherwise this action would violate theorem [ mainthm ] ."

    "<S> additionally , raags have become important in geometry and topology through the work of haglund and wise @xcite on ( virtually ) special cube complexes , which in turn played a key role in agol s solution @xcite of the virtual haken conjecture for 3-manifolds ( and even more so in agol s resolution of the virtual fibering conjecture , using the rfrs condition ) .    </S>",
    "<S> one particularly nice property of raags is that many of the algebraic properties of @xmath1 can be easily computed from the graph @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> for example , @xmath1 splits as a non - trivial free product if and only if @xmath0 is not connected and @xmath0 splits as a non - trivial direct product if and only if @xmath0 is a join . in a similar vein ( though this is harder ) , clay @xcite recently showed that for a connected @xmath0 which is not a single edge , @xmath1 splits over a cyclic subgroup if and only @xmath0 has a cut - vertex . </S>",
    "<S> the goal of this paper is to generalize clay s result to give a characterization of which raags split nontrivially over an abelian subgroup in terms of the defining graph .    </S>",
    "<S> one reason to be interested in splittings of raags over abelian subgroups is to study the ( outer ) automorphism group of a raag . </S>",
    "<S> there has been a lot of recent interest in automorphisms of raags ( for example , see @xcite , and also vogtmann s lectures at msj - si @xcite ) , partly in analogy with the study of @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> one approach to studying @xmath3 that proved quite fruitful is sela s @xcite , where limiting actions on @xmath4-trees and splittings of @xmath5 were studied . </S>",
    "<S> the splittings in this case were over infinite cyclic subgroups . </S>",
    "<S> for raags , the ` extension graph ' built by kim and koberda @xcite ( see also kim s talk at msj - si @xcite ) might be used to provide limiting @xmath4-trees equipped with an action of a raag in an analogous way to sela s approach . </S>",
    "<S> thus , it is of considerable interest to understand the ways in which a raag can split over an abelian subgroup . </S>",
    "<S> we intend to investigate limiting actions of raags on @xmath6-trees arising in this way in a future paper .    as with free and cyclic splittings , there are a few cases where an abelian splitting can be directly seen in the graph @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath0 is disconnected then it splits as a free product and if @xmath0 is a complete graph on @xmath7 vertices then @xmath8 , which splits nontrivially over @xmath9 . </S>",

    "<S> the defining presentation for @xmath1 exhibits it as @xmath16 . note that @xmath17 is free abelian , and properly contained in @xmath18 , so this is a nontrivial abelian splitting of @xmath1 .    </S>",
    "<S> our main theorem is that the only raags which split over an abelian subgroup are those which have one of the obvious splittings mentioned above .    </S>",

    "<S> the proof of theorem [ mainthm ] below gives a simpler proof of ( * ? ? ? </S>",
    "<S> * theorem a ) . in particular , </S>",
    "<S> if one reads this proof with the extra assumption that @xmath1 splits nontrivially over @xmath19 then this proof will yield a cut vertex in @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> clay indicated to us that he has a proof of theorem [ mainthm ] similar to the one we give below .    in section </S>",
