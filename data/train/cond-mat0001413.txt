    "electron correlation effects in narrow d- or f - bands@xcite are manifested in a variety of remarkable macroscopic phenomena , such as metal - insulator transition in transition - metal compounds,@xcite magnetism and high - temperature superconductivity in cuprates,@xcite colossal magnetoresistance in manganates , and non fermi - liquid behavior in transition - metal oxides,@xcite high - t@xmath4 superconductors,@xcite and heavy - fermion metals.@xcite incorporating electronic correlation in essence , the prototypical hubbard model , theoretically studied first in some detail by hubbard,@xcite has been therefore intensively studied in recent years in these contexts .",
    "while much attention has also been devoted to the doped region away from half - filling,@xcite motivated by the discovery of high - t@xmath4 superconductivity in the doped cuprates,@xcite the discussion in the following is mainly limited to the half - filled case , focusing only on the magnetic and metal - insulator aspects of the phase diagram .    even at half - filling the hubbard model in three dimensions",
    "has a fairly rich phase diagram in the interaction - temperature ( @xmath5 ) space , consisting of antiferromagnetic insulating ( afi ) , paramagnetic insulating ( pi ) , and paramagnetic metallic ( pm ) phases.@xcite in addition , in the absence of fermi - surface nesting ( for instance due to next - nearest - neighbor ( nnn ) hopping on a bipartite lattice ) a gapless antiferromagnetic metallic ( afm ) phase also appears possible.@xcite the widely different nature of the constituent phases ( metallic and insulating , magnetic and nonmagnetic ) has made it exceedingly difficult for the entire phase diagram to be studied within a single theoretical framework , and over the years various approaches have been developed to study different parts .",
    "the brief account given below of some of the recent developments will also serve to highlight the different physical processes of importance in different sections of the phase diagram .",
    "the study of magnetism in correlated electron systems goes back quite some time , to the theory of spin - waves in the band model of ferromagnetic metals.@xcite the correlation effect is implicit in the spin - wave excitation , which can be regarded as a bound state of an electron of one spin with a hole of opposite spin .",
    "propelled by the discovery of nearly two - dimensional antiferromagnetism in @xmath6,@xcite the intense activity in recent years in low - dimensional magnetism and spin - fluctuation effects , and more recently in three - dimensional magnetism , has led to significant progress .    starting with the afi phase ,",
    "a major element in this progress has been the unified understanding of this phase in the whole @xmath7 range within a many - body - theoretical framework , thus providing a bridge between the weak - coupling slater spin - density - wave limit and the strong - coupling heisenberg limit of localized spins . for a generalized hubbard model with multiple degenerate orbitals per site , it has been shown diagrammatically that within a systematic inverse - degeneracy expansion , which preserves the spin - rotational symmetry and hence the goldstone mode order by order , identical results are obtained in the strong coupling limit ( @xmath8 ) for all quantum corrections , order by order , as from the linear spin - wave analysis of the equivalent quantum heisenberg antiferromagnet ( qhaf).@xcite various quantities characterizing the afi phase have been evaluated in the whole @xmath7 range , both in two and three dimensions , and shown to interpolate properly between the weak and strong coupling limits .",
    "these include the spin - wave ( magnon ) velocity,@xcite magnon energy and density of states,@xcite sublattice magnetization @xmath9,@xcite and the local transverse spin fluctuation magnitude @xmath10.@xcite the rapid suppression ( with increasing @xmath1 ) in the contribution of particle - hole excitations across the charge gap , and the rapid rise in that of the low - energy collective ( magnon ) excitations indicates that an effective spin picture is approximately valid down to surprisingly low @xmath1 values.@xcite    for the three - dimensional antiferromagnet , the @xmath1-dependence of the nel temperature @xmath11 , which determines the magnetic phase boundary between the ordered afi phase and the spin disordered pi phase , has also been quantitatively studied in the whole @xmath7 range .",
    "a variety of techniques have been employed including functional integral formalism , mainly within the static approximation,@xcite quantum monte carlo methods,@xcite dynamical mean - field theory,@xcite which becomes exact in the limit of infinite dimensions,@xcite onsager reaction field theory,@xcite self - consistent spin - fluctuation theory,@xcite etc . except for the last two , all",
    "share the common feature of yielding a @xmath11 which approaches , in the strong coupling limit , the mean - field - theory ( mft ) result for the equivalent spin-1/2 qhaf .",
    "this is due to the neglect of the long - wavelength , low - energy magnon excitations , which reduce @xmath11 to nearly 70 % of the mft value within the spin - fluctuation theory,@xcite in excellent agreement with recent qmc results for the qhaf.@xcite    the @xmath1-dependence of @xmath11 has been shown to be very closely related to that of the maximum magnon energy @xmath12 which sets the magnon energy scale.@xcite starting from the strong coupling limit and going down in interaction strength , @xmath12 initially increases as @xmath13 , the exchange coupling .",
    "however , as the weak coupling limit is approached the falling charge gap ( @xmath14 ) compresses the magnon spectrum , and when @xmath15 the energy scale @xmath12 turns over and starts falling , eventually approaching @xmath14 in the weak coupling limit .",
    "we first consider traversing up in temperature , starting in the ordered afi phase in the intermediate coupling regime",
    ". with increasing temperature thermal excitation of the low - energy magnons enhances the transverse spin fluctuation @xmath16 , thereby reducing the af order parameter , until at @xmath17 , the sublattice magnetization @xmath18 vanishes and the staggered susceptibility diverges , marking the onset of the pi phase . with further increase in temperature beyond @xmath19 , since no further reduction in the sublattice magnetization is possible , a low - momentum cutoff must be introduced in the sum over magnon modes.@xcite the corresponding length scale sets an upper limit to the magnon wavelength , and therefore determines the spin correlation length @xmath20 such that af order exists only upto length scale @xmath20 .",
    "the pi phase is thus characterized by an energy gap , a spin correlation length , and local magnetization @xmath21 whose direction slowly fluctuates in space and time .",
    "the twisting between neighboring spins relative to the af alignment increases as @xmath22 with temperature , and this twist activates the hopping term at first order , resulting in a broadening of the two bands , as in the spiral phase studied earlier in the context of the doped hubbard model.@xcite the electronic bandwidth in the low - temperature ordered phase , which is of the order of the exchange energy @xmath13 due to the second - order virtual hopping process , is enhanced due to this twist by order @xmath23 , thus providing a mechanism for coupling between the magnetic ( dis)ordering and the electronic spectrum . for @xmath24 , the correlation length @xmath25 , and the bands",
    "are broadened to their maximum extent of order @xmath26 , the free electron half - bandwidth . finally when @xmath27 , there is a crossover into a semiconducting phase .",
    "we now consider another sequence traversing down in interaction strength , keeping the temperature fixed . in this case charge fluctuations , which are strongly suppressed in the strong coupling limit , progressively become more important , and when @xmath28 the probability of a site being doubly occupied or vacant becomes appreciable , and the local moment defined by @xmath29 becomes insignificant .",
    "double occupancy and vacany also activate the hopping term at first order , broadening the two bands .",
    "as the band gap shrinks with decreasing @xmath1 and the bands broaden due to this charge - fluctuation induced hopping , the two bands eventually meet , resulting in the metal - insulator transtion .",
    "thus the disappearance of the local moment and the transition into the metallic phase go hand - in - hand , both driven by enhanced charge fluctuations .",
    "an explicit demonstration of the existence of an insulating state with two separated bands , _ independent of any magnetic ordering _ , which can undergo a transition with decreasing interaction strength into a metallic phase was first provided by hubbard.@xcite however , the decoupling scheme employed within the equation of motion approach resulted in several drawbacks ( discussed in more detail in section iii ) , such as inappropriate bandwidth , violation of the fermi - liquid theory , and a vanishing critical @xmath30 for the metal - insulator phase transition for arbitrary hopping . of course , magnetic ordering and correlations , and the associated low - energy magnetic excitations were totally neglected .",
    "another program , which included the possibility of magnetic ordering , was based on a static random one - body approximation to the hubbard model.@xcite the interaction term was replaced by an effective , self - consistent random potential with statistical correlation to simulate many - body correlation effects . only ising - like magnetic excitations",
    "were included and the low - energy magnon excitations were neglected .",
    "a continuous magnetic phase transition was obtained between the afi and the pi phases , whereas two crossover temperatures were obtained around which , respectively , the dos at @xmath31 becomes appreciable and the local moments essentially disappear .    in recent years",
    "the dynamical mean field theory , which is exact in the limit of infinite dimensions , has emerged as a controlled approximation for studying the phase diagram in the whole parameter space . in the limit of infinite dimensions",
    "the interaction self energy becomes local , and the quantum many - body problem reduces to the self - consistent solution of a single - site quantum problem of an impurity embedded in an effective medium . by extending this approach to two sites to account for the sublattice structure in the af state ,",
    "a continuous magnetic phase transition was obtained , as already mentioned above .",
    "in addition , when @xmath11 was sufficiently suppressed ( made possible by including a frustration - inducing nnn hopping term ) , a first - order metal - insulator transition line , ending in a second - order critical point was also obtained.@xcite several associated features of the metal - insulator transition in @xmath32 have recently been discussed within the dmft approach , such as volume discontinuities and resistivity changes,@xcite and optical conductivity on both sides of the transition.@xcite the nature of the transition itself continues to be of interest , and a recent study of the changes in the density of states near the transition indicates that the fermi liquid breaks down before the gap opens.@xcite    while the afi phase is well understood , and spin fluctuation effects can be studied about the broken - symmetry hf state even in the strong coupling limit , for the magnetically - disordered pi and pm phases a good analytical starting point at the same level is still not available .",
    "the decoupling approach presented here provides this for studying the interplay of electronic spectral properties and af correlations in these states .",
    "furthermore , the approach is equally applicable to the broken - symmetry state , allowing for a unified description independent of magnetic ordering .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . after introducing the equation of motion approach for the single - particle green s function in section",
    "ii , and briefly reviewing the hubbard i approximation in section iii , improved decoupling schemes are presented in section iv which take into account af correlations . especially appropriate for the spin - disordered pi phase , the final decoupling procedure in subsection c offers several improvements over the hubbard i approximation .",
    "fluctuations are included in section v within a static random approximation and a self - consistent evaluationt of the disorder - averaged self energy within the cpa is carried out .",
    "fluctuation effects on the charge gap and the density of states are examined in section vi by studying the coupled , non - linear equations for the self - consistently determined complex self energy .",
    "contact with known results for the broken - symmetry state is made in section vii , showing the applicability of the decoupling scheme irrespective of magnetic ordering .",
    "deviation from perfect af ordering and effects of short - ranged af spin correlations on the electronic spectrum are studied in section viii .",
    "the effects of hole doping on the qualitative nature of the quasiparticle band dispersion , and the transfer of spectral weight between the hubbard bands are briefly studied in section ix .",
    "some conclusions are presented in section x.",
    "we consider the hamiltonian @xmath33 where the kinetic energy term @xmath34 involves the hopping matrix elements @xmath35 between sites @xmath36 and @xmath37 , and @xmath38 is the local interaction term . in momentum space",
    "@xmath39 , where @xmath40 denotes the lattice free - particle energy .",
    "we consider the equation of motion approach , in which the time derivative of an operator @xmath41 in the heisenberg representation is obtained from the commutator with the hamiltonian , @xmath42= e^{iht}[\\hat{o},h]e^{-iht}$ ] , and apply it to the time - ordered one - particle green s function @xmath43 \\ ; .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] taking the time derivative and using @xmath44 , the anticommutation property @xmath45 , and the commutator @xmath46 = - \\sum_\\delta   t_\\delta \\ ; a_{i+\\delta\\uparrow }   + u a_{i\\uparrow}n_{i\\downarrow}\\ ] ] to determine @xmath47 , one obtains @xmath48 which is an equation for @xmath49 in terms of a higher - order correlation function .    decoupling the equation of motion at this stage by replacing the operator @xmath50 in the last term by its expectation value results in the hartree - fock approximation @xmath51 where the densities @xmath52 are determined self consistently .",
    "this approximation is a reasonable _ starting point _ in the broken - symmetry state , when the long - time average of the local density @xmath50 does not differ substantially from the short - time average . for the af state ,",
    "basic features such as the correlation effect and the associated electron localization in the strong interaction limit are actually already contained at this level , as evidenced by the charge gap of order @xmath1 and the narrow af bandwidth of order @xmath0 . within a spin - fluctuation approach , wherein transverse fluctuations about the hf state are systematically incorporated , the af state of the half - filled hubbard model has been extensively studied in recent years , including the effects of disorder , impurities , and vacancies.@xcite even the strong coupling limit ( @xmath53 ) is accessible within this formally weak - coupling expansion .",
    "this has been explicitly demonstrated by systematically evaluating quantum corrections to various quantities such as the magnon energy , af order parameter , perpendicular spin susceptibility , ground - state energy , spin correlation length.@xcite    however , in the spin disordered state this approximation breaks down for strong interaction , when the expectation value of the local density @xmath54 ( the mean density ) differs substantially from the short - time average ( either nearly zero or nearly one ) . in this case",
    "the local magnetization strongly fluctuates between 1 and -1 , so that the average local magnetization @xmath55 vanishes , but the local moment @xmath56 defined by @xmath57 remains appreciable .",
    "this strong local moment arises from the correlation effect of an electron locally excluding the opposite - spin electron due to the strong electronic repulsion .",
    "this provides a clue that the decoupling procedure can be improved by ensuring that the operators which are replaced by their averages involve minimal fluctuations . in the following",
    "we describe several such decoupling procedures , all of which are quite distinct from that employed by hubbard.@xcite this approximation , commonly referred to as the hubbard i , is first briefly reviewed here for comparison .",
    "in hubbard i the next step was to continue with the equation of motion approach and examine the time derivative of the last term in eq .",

    ", the bandwidth decreases only from @xmath80 to @xmath26 , whereas one expects a correlation - narrowed bandwidth of order @xmath0 for the nn hopping model .",
    "this is a serious drawback of the hubbard i approximation in the strong correlation limit , and can be traced to the replacement of @xmath50 , a strongly fluctuating quantity , by its average value .",
    "another drawback pertains to the absence of a critical interaction strength for the energy gap . for a general free - particle energy @xmath81 ,",

    "if @xmath146 represents these operators , then @xmath147 and @xmath148 are in general non - vanishing due to fluctuations and correlations present in the ground state . in the following we approximately account for these fluctuations by replacing the operator @xmath146 by static , independently random terms @xmath149 distributed across the lattice with @xmath150 and @xmath151 determined self - consistently from @xmath148 .    when the above replacements are made , we see from eq .",
    "( 20 ) that the charge / potential fluctuation terms @xmath152 and @xmath153 couple with the hopping term , leading to charge fluctuation induced hopping . on the other hand ,",
    "the hopping induced fluctuation term @xmath154 is purely imaginary and couples with the local interaction term yielding a hopping induced relaxation .      in eq .",
    "( 20 ) the operators @xmath143 and @xmath144 were replaced ( in the decoupling procedure ) by their expectation values , which vanish in the paramagnetic state at half filling ( @xmath94 ) , and also when af correlations are present .",
    "as shown below this approximation essentially amounts to a neglect of local charge fluctuations and is valid in the low - temperature , strong - coupling limit , when double occupancy and vacancy are strongly suppressed . in the strong coupling limit",
    "we have a spin picture of the ground state , and for arbitrary orientation of the local spin direction , the ground state expectation values @xmath155 and @xmath156 remain invariant due to the af correlations between neighbouring spins . if the spin at site @xmath36 is inclined at angle @xmath157 from the @xmath158 direction , then @xmath159 , and @xmath160 .",
    "hence the operators @xmath161 and @xmath162 essentially behave like c - numbers , and the above replacements are valid .",
    "even the strong quantum spin fluctuations , which significantly reduce the af order parameter in two dimensions , do not substantially alter this picture as the major spin - fluctuation contribution arises from long - wavelength magnon modes .",
    "however , for weak correlation and/or high temperature , when double occupancy is not strongly penalized , the local densities @xmath163 and @xmath164 _ independently _ fluctuate between zero and one at short time scales , and therefore @xmath165 and @xmath166 strongly fluctuate between minus one and plus one . in the following we account for these fluctuations within a static random approximation , together with disorder averaging at the cpa level . a more complete theory which includes the spatial and temporal correlations in the fluctuations",
    "will be developed later by considering the appropriate two - body green s functions in eq .",
    "( 20 ) within systematic approximations like the rpa .    even in the absence of charge fluctuations ,",
    "@xmath165 can fluctuate if ferromagnetic correlations are present in the ( paramagnetic ) ground state .",
    "similarly these fluctuations are also present if the af correlations are only short - ranged , so that the neighbouring spins are twisted from perfect af alignment .",
    "this is further discussed in section viii .",
    "we note that the energy scale @xmath167 of these fluctuation terms is intermediate between the local @xmath168 scale and the second - order hopping scale @xmath169 in eq .",
    "the effect of these order-@xmath167 fluctuation terms is therefore to renormalize the bandwidth by order @xmath170 in the strong coupling limit , as opposed to the order @xmath0 renormalization by the second - order virtual hopping process .",
    "thus the charge - fluctuation and spin - twisting processes activate the hopping term at first order .    for simplicity , we consider the nn hopping case , so that the sites @xmath36 and @xmath37 are in opposite sublattices .",
    "we assume that @xmath1 times the density fluctuation term @xmath171 , which we denote by @xmath172 , is a random potential distributed independently across the lattice .",
    "the average of this random potential term vanishes , but its second moment @xmath173 reflects a measure of fluctuations in the system . at half filling ( @xmath94 ) , the long - time average yields the fluctuation magnitude @xmath174 , which has the following limits . in the strong coupling limit",
    "when double occupancy is strongly suppressed and af correlations are present , we have @xmath175 . at the other extreme , in the non - interacting limit , when a site may be independently occupied or vacant with equal probability of one - half , we have @xmath176 .",
    "therefore , the fluctuation magnitude lies in the range @xmath177 .    the random potential term @xmath178 is treated at the cpa level , and the disorder - averaged green s function is obtained in the following .",

    "this essentially amounts to a neglect of spatial correlations in the fluctuations . in this case",
    "there are two terms in the disorder self energy @xmath191 the second term @xmath192 , however , vanishes because @xmath193 is identically zero .",
    "this follows because @xmath194 , given by the fourier transform of eq .",
    "( 25 ) , is even under the transformation @xmath195 , while the other term @xmath196 is odd , and therefore the @xmath197 summation over the whole brillouin zone yields the vanishing result .",
    "the disorder self energy is therefore diagonal in the site basis , and hence momentum independent .",
    "furthermore , the sum @xmath198 in the equation for @xmath199 yields @xmath200 , the number of nearest neighbours , so that the self energy involves the combination @xmath201 .",
    "these features of the local self energy are as in the dmft where the hopping term is taken to be @xmath202 , so that @xmath203 is finite in the limit of infinite dimensions.@xcite    finally , after fourier transformation of eq .",
    "( 25 ) and of @xmath204 $ ] , we obtain the following result for the full green s function @xmath205 where the disorder - averaged self energy is obtained self consistently from @xmath206 the above provides a self - consistent scheme for determining the green s function when fluctuations are included . in the following we",
    "quantitatively examine the fluctuation effects on the spectral properties , in particular the charge gap and the density of states .",
    "thermal contribution to charge and spin fluctuations brings in temperature into the problem , and makes the charge gap sensitive to temperature , leading to the possibility of a temperature - driven metal - insulator transition .",
    "temporal and spatial correlations in fluctuations are neglected in this treatment .",
    "the present study is nonetheless useful because when these correlations are included by considering the appropriate two - body green s functions ( having the form @xmath207 ) , the structure of the resulting equation for @xmath49 will be similar to eq .",
    "( 28 ) .",
    "the purely imaginary hopping induced fluctuation term @xmath208 couples diagonally to the green s function .",
    "therefore , eq . ( 23 ) will contain , in addition , a diagonal term @xmath209 , where @xmath210 . again assuming that @xmath211 are independently random , and are uncorrelated with the @xmath178 , within the cpa we obtain another diagonal self energy with a negative coefficient which will simply renormalize the @xmath212 defined earlier .",
    "a qualitative criterion for the metal - insulator transition is obtained by considering the competition between the kinetic energy term ( bandwidth @xmath80 ) which delocalizes the electrons making the system metallic , and the correlation term ( coulomb barrier @xmath1 ) which localizes the electrons making the system insulating .",
    "we will first make a simple analysis of the effective charge gap when fluctuations are included to their full extent .",
    "we shall see that the qualitative criterion @xmath213 for the vanishing of the gap , and therefore for the metal - insulator transition , arises in a very natural way .",
    "we have seen earlier that when fluctuations are allowed to their full extent , @xmath214 , and therefore the disorder strength @xmath215 .",
    "considering the disorder self energy from eq .",
    "( 29 ) to the lowest order , we have for @xmath216 @xmath217 where the result at the right is obtained by neglecting the free - electron energy @xmath218 in comparison to @xmath219 , for the purpose of obtaining an estimate . now from eq .

    "used , for @xmath222 the energy gap never closes , and the system remains insulating .",
    "we now obtain the self - consistent solution for the self energy @xmath223 from eq .",

    "it is convenient to introduce a complex function @xmath224 by equating @xmath225 in eq . ( 29 ) the self - consistency equation for @xmath223 may be recast in terms of @xmath226 ; if @xmath227 denotes the prefactor , eq .",

    "we first consider the solution with @xmath233 , which corresponds to a vanishing imaginary part of the self energy and the density of states , and therefore to the energy gap region .",
    "since @xmath234 decreases monotonically with positive @xmath230 , for a given @xmath63    there exists a physically significant solution @xmath235 of the equation @xmath236 . for @xmath237",

    "it is interesting to note that these two values @xmath241 and @xmath249 are actually _ identical _ because their parent equations @xmath250 and @xmath251 are so in view of the relation @xmath252 .",
    "the significance of this coincidence is that the imaginary part of the self energy grows continuously , so that there is no discontinuity in the density of states , and therefore when the band gap vanishes the resulting metal - insulator transition is also continuous .",

    "due to the fluctuation - induced states in the gap , the band gap decreases with @xmath261 , and at a critical value @xmath289 , the band gap vanishes and the system undergoes a continuous metal - insulator transition .",
    "so far we have been concerned with the spin - symmetric state .",
    "however , the present approach provides for a description of the broken - symmetry state as well , and in this section we briefly make contact with the known results for the af state with respect to the af band energies and amplitudes .",
    "we consider the nn hopping case , and proceed with the decoupling approach a. in the af state the density @xmath163 has values @xmath290 and @xmath291 on the two sublattice sites , where @xmath9 is the sublattice magnetization .",

    ", we make the following approximation consistent with the hf scheme @xmath294 in this case @xmath295 , so that @xmath296 , which now involves the sublattice magnetization . with this approximation ,",
    "( 38 ) simplifies to @xmath297   \\ ; , \\ ] ] with @xmath298 .",
    "this is precisely of the same form as obtained in the hf description of the af state.@xcite consequently , the expressions for the af - state electron amplitudes are identical , resulting in the same self - consistency condition @xmath299 , which determines the sublattice magnetization @xmath9 .",
    "af correlations have already been considered while introducing the decoupling schemes a , b , and c in section iv . here",
    "we examine the influence of short - range af ordering on such aspects of the electronic spectrum as the charge gap , the density of states etc . in the strong correlation limit and for half - filling ( @xmath94 ) ,",
    "when charge fluctuations are absent , the expectation value @xmath300 vanishes only for perfect af ordering when @xmath301 .",
    "however , for @xmath302 , when the spin ordering is not perfect , the finite spin correlation length @xmath20 results in a twisting of neighbouring spins by @xmath303 on the average .",
    "if at site @xmath37 the spin is pointing up , but at site @xmath36 the spin instead of pointing down is twisted by a small angle @xmath157 , then @xmath304 , so that @xmath305 is slightly reduced from 1 . whereas if the spin at site @xmath36 is pointing down , but at the neighboring site @xmath37 the spin instead of pointing up is twisted by the small angle @xmath157 , then @xmath305 is slightly increased from 1 .",
    "this results in a twist - induced fluctuation term arising from the expectation value @xmath300 which fluctuates between @xmath306 and @xmath307 , so that @xmath308    this twist - induced fluctuation term couples with the hopping term at first order in eq . ( 14 ) , so that the quasiparticle band energies are modified by an order-@xmath170 term .",
    "this feature is similar to that in the spiral state of the doped hubbard model , where the twisting of neighbouring spins activates the hopping term at first order and broadens the bands symmetrically.@xcite the pulled - down states are filled whereas the pushed - up states are empty due to doping , resulting in stabilization of the spiral state .",
    "this twist - induced fluctuation term will also contribute to the overall fluctuation strength discussed in section v , with the disorder strength @xmath63 now including a term related to the inverse spin - correlation length .",
    "therefore with increasing temperature the enhanced magnon excitation and the spin - fluctuation induced spin disordering will also contribute to states in the gap and the band - gap reduction .",
    "thus in general , both charge and spin fluctuations contribute towards an effective disorder strength @xmath63 which will determine the overall electronic spectral properties .",
    "in the strong coupling limit , doping with holes or electrons results in transfer of spectral weight between the two hubbard bands . consider the atomic limit ( @xmath309 ) where this feature is most pronounced and easily understood . a site with a single electron of spin @xmath310 contributes two states at energies @xmath311 ( occupied ) and @xmath312 ( unoccupied ) .",
    "when a spin-@xmath310 hole is introduced by removing the spin-@xmath310 electron , the spectrum changes to both states at energy @xmath313 , because electrons of either spin can now go into the empty site with zero energy . extending to a collection of sites ,",
    "if @xmath314 is the hole concentration , then the density of states ( both spins ) at energies @xmath315 and @xmath1 are @xmath316 and @xmath317 respectively , so that the density of unoccupied states in the lower energy level is @xmath318 .",
    "finite hopping introduces a spread in the hole energy of order @xmath170 , so that this picture of the transfer of spectral weight remains valid as long as the band separation @xmath319 is much bigger than the bandwidth @xmath320 .",
    "in order to examine the effect of hole doping on the spectral weights , we consider eq .",
    "( 14 ) appropriate for the nn hopping case , and focus on the correlation function term @xmath321 , which reduces to the single - particle green s function in the half - filled case @xmath94 . for a total particle density @xmath322 , corresponding to a hole concentration @xmath314 , the term @xmath323 reduces to @xmath324 , which now contains an operator term for finite doping .",
    "however , the doping - induced term @xmath325 can be written in terms of @xmath326 from eq .",
    "( 4 ) as @xmath327 \\ ; , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] so that the correlation function term under consideration can be exactly obtained in terms of the single - particle green s function @xmath49 .",

    "the quasiparticle band energies are therefore given by @xmath332 , which in the strong coupling limit reduce to @xmath333 $ ] , when only terms upto first order in @xmath334 are retained .",
    "this indicates that doping leads to a qualitative change in the nature of the band itself , with the dispersion changing from @xmath335 of order @xmath0 to @xmath336 , resulting in an effective doping - induced hopping strength and bandwidth of order @xmath3 .",
    "this is again very different from the hubbard i `` rigid - band '' result wherein there is only a slight doping - induced modification of the bandwidth , but no qualitative change in the nature of the band .",
    "we examine the loss of integrated spectral weight in the upper band due to doping . integrating the spectral function @xmath337 over the upper band , and summing over both spins , we obtain @xmath338 evaluating the momentum sum in the strong coupling limit by retaining terms only upto order @xmath339",
    ", we obtain , @xmath340 upto order @xmath170 the integrated spectral weight in the upper band is therefore simply reduced to @xmath317 by doping , as in the atomic limit .",
    "similarly the weight in the lower band is enhanced to @xmath316 .",
    "in conclusion , the new decoupling scheme is appropriate for both the spin - symmetric ( paramagnetic metallic and insulating ) phases as well as the broken - symmetry af phase .",
    "although restricted to bipartite lattices , the decoupling approximations involve only weakly fluctuating operators , resulting in several improvements over the hubbard i scheme .",
    "independent of magnetic ordering , the scheme yields , at the lowest order , the correct strong - coupling bandwidth of order @xmath0 , a non - zero critical interaction strength ( above which the band gap opens ) only if same - sublattice hopping ( e.g. , nnn hopping ) is also present , and the correct quasiparticle spectral weights ( of 1/2 per spin ) in each band for the half - filled model .",
    "charge and spin fluctuations , which are manifested in double occupancy and vacancy of sites and spin twisting due to short - range af ordering , were studied within a static , random approximation .",
    "the self - consistent , cpa - level evaluation of the disorder - averaged self energy showed a fluctuation - induced band - broadening and consequent decrease in the band gap .",
    "the critical interaction strength , above which the band gap remains finite even when the fluctuations are included to their full extent , was obtained as @xmath267 and @xmath268 in two and three dimensions respectively .",
    "the solution of the non - linear self - consistent equation for the disorder self energy shows that with increasing fluctuation strength the band gap shrinks to zero continuously and the density of states @xmath2 between the bands also grows continuously .",
    "the monotonic dependence of fluctuation strength on temperature translates into a continuous metal - insulator transition .",
    "the fluctuation magnitude as well as its dynamics can be determined from the appropriate correlation function , and this is presently under investigation .",
    "the dynamics is relevant in view of the switching of the spectral function between the two hubbard bands , and the possibility of a motionally narrowed central peak in the density of states when the hubbard switching rate becomes comparable with the energy separation between the bands .",
    "quantum monte carlo simulations do show a central peak in the vicinity of the metal - insulator transition.@xcite    with doping a quantitatively correct transfer of spectral weight between the two hubbard bands in the strong - coupling limit was obtained at the lowest - order level in the decoupling scheme .",
    "furthermore , in contrast to the hubbard i approximation , a qualitative change in the nature of the band itself was obtained , with an effective doping - induced hopping strength and bandwidth of order @xmath3 .",
    "extension of the equation of motion approach to the transverse spin propagator to obtain the low - energy spin - fluctuation spectrum will provide a magnetic description of the spin - symmetric state , and enable one to approach the magnetic phase boundary from the paramagnetic side .",
