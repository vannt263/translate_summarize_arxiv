    "in the strong - field regime of atomic ionization characterized by small keldysh parameters @xmath2 @xcite ( where @xmath3 is the atomic ionization potential , @xmath4 the ponderomotive energy , @xmath5 the field amplitude , and @xmath6 the laser frequency ) , the laser field is expected to dominate over the coulomb field of the ionized atom .",
    "accordingly , in the strong - field approximation ( sfa ) the coulomb field is neglected in the final continuum state of the outgoing electron . with the recent availability of intense long wavelength ( @xmath7 m ) laser pulses ,",
    "this picture has fundamentally changed : the experimental energy spectrum of ionized electrons is found to have unexpected features at a few ev @xcite , with a particular example being the low - energy structure ( les ) @xcite .",
    "these results strongly deviate from sfa predictions even though they were observed well within the tunneling regime ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "they can be explained in terms of multiple rescattering of the ionized electron at the coulomb field of the residual ion @xcite after one or more excursions out to large distances with quiver amplitude @xmath9 .",
    "recently , additional contributions at even lower energies , termed very - low - energy structures ( vless ) , were discovered @xcite but up to now these vless have not been quantitatively analyzed and characterized .",
    "our previous measurement of the three - dimensional momentum distributions of various atomic and molecular targets @xcite confirmed signatures in momentum space that correspond to the vles and additionally revealed a zero - energy structure ( zes ) .",
    "up to now , the origin of the zes has remained speculative , with depletion of rydberg states @xcite being a suggested mechanism . on a more fundamental level",
    ", the correspondence between quantum and classical dynamics very close to the ionization threshold is of concern as most models describing the distant rescattering scenario are based on classical dynamics . in particular , the explanations of the les in terms of one - dimensional ( transverse direction only ) @xcite or two - dimensional ( longitudinal and transverse directions ) focusing of the emitted electron near the inner turning point @xcite rely on subtle properties of the classical phase space .",
    "its applicability to the vles and even zes is not obvious as the debroglie wavelength diverges for electronic energies @xmath10 approaching the threshold , @xmath11 .    in the present joint experimental and theoretical study",
    "we analyze the behavior of the les , vles , and zes as a function of pulse duration of the mid - infrared ( mid - ir ) pulse varying between 41 fs ( 4 optical cycles ) to 140 fs ( @xmath12 optical cycles ) . as the number of distant recollisions with the ionic core is controlled by the number of optical cycles and the peak - to - peak amplitude after tunneling ionization , variation of the pulse duration",
    "provides a knob to manipulate the focusing properties of the recollision process .",
    "the vectorial momentum distribution parallel ( @xmath13 ) and perpendicular ( @xmath14 ) to the laser polarization axis is recorded by a reaction microscope ( remi ) @xcite that is optimized for low electron energies .",
    "the detection of the distribution in all three spatial dimensions allows the influence of laser pulse duration on the low - energy features to be investigated . in parallel , classical trajectory monte carlo ( ctmc ) as well as time - dependent schrdinger equation ( tdse ) calculations",
    "permit the identification of the vles in terms of high - order les contributions , i.e. , two - dimensional focusing after multiple returns into phase - space regions of very high angular momenta .",
    "in addition , the zes is unambiguously identified in terms of electrons recaptured into high rydberg states , often referred to as frustrated field ionization @xcite , which are subsequently ionized by the static electric field of the remi after the end of the pulse .",
    "we find excellent quantitative agreement between experiment and theory .",
    "moreover , classical simulations reproduce many features of the quantum calculation remarkably well .",
    "atomic units ( a.u . , @xmath15 ) are used unless indicated otherwise .",
    "the experiments were performed using a home - built optical parametric chirped pulse amplification ( opcpa ) source @xcite which delivers linearly polarized few - cycle pulses in the mid - ir ( @xmath16 nm center wavelength ) and 160 khz pulse repetition rate .",
    "after compression , pulse energies of up to 18 @xmath17j are achieved with a power stability of better than 1%  rms over 4.5 hours @xcite .",
    "the opcpa is optically carrier - to - envelope phase ( cep ) self - stabilized and routinely achieves 250 mrad stability over 11 minutes .",
    "the measurements were performed at a fixed laser intensity of @xmath18 w/@xmath19 corresponding to a keldysh parameter of @xmath20 and a ponderomotive energy of @xmath21 ev . the experiment was conducted for pulse durations of 4 cycles [ @xmath22 fs , full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the intensity ] , 6.5 cycles ( @xmath23 fs ) and 13 cycles ( @xmath24 fs ) .    a remi @xcite is used to detect the fragments of the photoionization process . in a remi detection system",
    ", static electric and magnetic fields are combined to guide all charged fragments of the ionization process onto two opposing micro channel plate detectors . combining the time - of - flight ( tof ) and spatial informations",
    ", we can retrieve the 3d momentum vectors ( with @xmath25 as the direction of the static fields and the laser polarization , @xmath26 as the laser propagation direction , and @xmath27 as the direction of the gas jet ) and the kinetic energy of the ions and electrons with very high resolution . in this work ,",
    "the static fields of the remi were set to @xmath28 v / cm and @xmath29 gs which results in an electron momentum accuracy of @xmath30 a.u .",

    "additionally , it is possible to detect the particles in coincidence , which allows the assignment of every detected photo - electron to its parent ion . the argon gas is supersonically expanded into ultra - high vacuum . in the experiment we purposely averaged over the carrier - envelope phase @xmath32 .",
    "we perform both quantum and classical simulations in order to probe the degree of quantum  classical correspondence at very low electron energies which is , _ a priori _ , not obvious .",
    "this point is highlighted by the fact that the debroglie wavelength of a typical low - energy electron is quite large , @xmath33 a.u .",
    "@xmath34 nm .",
    "quantum simulations of the interaction of strong laser pulses with atoms in all dimensions remains a challenge in the mid - ir region .",
    "this is because the quiver amplitude , and therefore the excursion from the ionic core , is on the order of @xmath35 a.u . , which requires a large domain in configuration space to be accurately calculated .",
    "technical details of our three - dimensional ( 3d ) quantum - mechanical simulation have been described previously @xcite . in brief , we discretize the radial coordinate space in a pseudo - spectral grid and propagate the wave function which is expanded into a set of pseudostates with quantum numbers @xmath36 employing the velocity gauge for the coupling to the laser field . to prevent unphysical reflections from the `` boundaries '' of the computing box we separate the real space into inner ( @xmath37 ) and outer ( @xmath38 ) regions .",
    "the parts of the wavefunction reaching the outer region are projected onto coulomb - volkov states in momentum space and are propagated analytically henceforth . for the calculations",
    "presented here we chose an outer box radius of @xmath39 a.u .  and an inner radius of @xmath40 a.u .",
    "@xmath41 needs to be significantly ( at least a factor of two ) larger than the quiver radius .",
    "moreover , the value of @xmath41 determines the range of pseudostates which closely resemble atomic states with principal quantum number @xmath42 , @xmath43 . in the present case ,",
    "rydberg states up to @xmath44 are faithfully accounted for .",
    "higher lying bound states are included in terms of pseudostates with @xmath45 where the hydrogenic @xmath46 degeneracy is lifted .",
    "this allows for a coarse - grained representation of the spectral excitation density @xmath47 close to the continuum threshold at @xmath48 .",
    "@xmath47 plays an important role in representing the process of recapture into rydberg states , which is the key to the zes .",
    "we describe the ionization of the ar3@xmath49 electron in terms of a model potential that reproduces @xmath3 and the oscillator strengths of the coupling to the first excited states ( 4@xmath50 , 5@xmath50 ) @xcite .",
    "in our ctmc simulation we employ an effective potential derived from the hartree - fock ( hf ) approximation @xcite .",
    "the binding energy @xmath51 determining the energy shell of the microcanonical ensemble was set to the hf result of @xmath52 ev ( experimental value @xmath53 ev @xcite ) .",
    "this leads to a keldysh parameter @xmath54 @xcite suggesting a strong dominance of tunneling over multiphoton ionization for the laser parameters used in the experiment .",
    "since the electron emission originates from the ar3@xmath49 subshell with quantum numbers @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 , we use the @xmath58-dependent adk rates @xcite @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the effective principal quantum number derived from @xmath61 . up to constant factors",
    ", the total emission rate is therefore proportional to @xmath62 and the probability for emission during a time interval @xmath63 proportional to @xmath64 integration of @xmath65 over the pulse duration gives the total emission probability for an atom in a laser pulse with maximum field strength @xmath66 .",
    "the @xmath67 coordinate of the tunnel exit , @xmath68 , was calculated from the field strength at ionization time .",
    "the perpendicular position was taken from projections of the corresponding hf wavefunctions with @xmath69 and @xmath70 onto the plane perpendicular to the polarization axis at @xmath68 .",
    "widths of the gaussian momentum distributions along the polarization direction at the tunnel exit @xmath71 and the perpendicular direction @xmath72 were derived in ref .",

    "the propagation was performed using a standard fourth order runge - kutta algorithm and proceeds to electron - core distances of at least @xmath74 a.u .",
    "after the end of the laser pulse . since the experimental conditions of the remi were set to use an extraction field of @xmath75 v / cm @xmath76 a.u .",

    "it is further used in the data evaluation of the ctmc simulation as it is crucial for the analysis of the zes . for each carrier - envelope phase ( @xmath77 ) , @xmath78 trajectories were calculated and combined for the determination of the final vectorial momentum and energy vs.  angular momentum distributions .",
    "momentum , energy , and angular momenta were also recorded for electrons with energies @xmath79 after the end of the pulse , signifying electrons recaptured into high - lying rydberg states .    to accurately simulate the experiment we perform an average over the focal intensity distribution . to this end",
    "we have assumed a cylindrically symmetric beam with gaussian intensity profile and maximum intensity @xmath80 .",
    "the volume with an intensity larger than @xmath81 is given by @xcite @xmath82 with @xmath83 and @xmath84 the focal diameter .",
    "this expression was evaluated for small steps of the maximum electric field ( @xmath85 ) resulting in thin shells of volume @xmath86 with maximum local field strength @xmath66 between @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "previously presented experimental data for the full 3d momentum spectra of electrons emitted from argon , oxygen @xcite and nitrogen @xcite interacting with ultrashort , mid - ir laser pulses allowed to identify the vles @xcite in the momentum plane @xmath89 , @xmath90 , where it appears as a v - shaped distribution . in addition , a peak at zero energy ( within the energy resolution ) dubbed zes was found .",
    "the origin of these structures and the precise connection to the previously observed les remained unclear . in the present measurement",
    "we extend the 3d momentum spectrum for the case of argon to larger @xmath13 to simultaneously resolve several orders of low - energy structures as predicted to exist @xcite .",
    "moreover , by varying the pulse duration at constant @xmath1 we can control the v - shape , i.e. the opening angle , which aids in the identification of the underlying recollision and coulomb focusing processes .    in fig .",

    "additionally , lobes of the distribution towards lower transverse momenta are visible for @xmath93 a.u .  and @xmath94 a.u .",
    "these lobes can be identified as less of first and second order by comparison with the ctmc simulation . in @xcite",
    "less of increasing order were attributed to turning points of the electron trajectory close to the ionic core after an increasing number of quiver oscillations in the driving laser field .",

    "<S> atomic ionization by intense mid - infrared ( mid - ir ) pulses produces low electron energy features that the strong - field approximation , which is expected to be valid in the tunneling ionization regime characterized by small keldysh parameters ( @xmath0 ) , can not describe . </S>",
    "<S> these features include the low - energy structure ( les ) , the very - low - energy structure ( vles ) , and the more recently found zero - energy structure ( zes ) . </S>",
    "<S> they result from the interplay between the laser electric field and the atomic coulomb field which controls the low - energy spectrum also for small @xmath1 . in the present joint experimental and theoretical study </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the vectorial momentum spectrum at very low energies . using a reaction microscope optimized for the detection of very low energy electrons , </S>",
    "<S> we have performed a thorough study of the three - dimensional momentum spectrum well below 1 ev . </S>",
    "<S> our measurements are complemented by quantum and classical simulations , which allow for an interpretation of the les , vles and of the newly identified zes in terms of two - dimensional coulomb focusing and recapture into rydberg states , respectively . </S>"
