    "algol - type eclipsing binary systems consist of semi - detached components in which the secondary has evolved to overflow its roche lobe . the current mass ratio results from the transfer of sufficient material onto the less - evolved primary until it was transformed into the more massive of the two stars ( crawford 1955 ; kopal 1955 ) .",
    "the relative separation of the components , the radius of the primary , and the mass ratio determine the types of accretion structures that eventually form . in short - period algols ( @xmath8 days ) , the gas stream arising from the l1 point can impact the gainer directly ; in long - period systems ( @xmath9 days ) , the curving gas stream may instead feed into a stable disk ; and in intermediate - period systems mixed behavior has been observed ( e.g. , peters 1989 , richards & albright 1999 , and references therein ) .",
    "secondary structures such as hotspots , outflows ( potentially including jets ) , or accretion annuli can also develop .",
    "au  mon ( gcrv  4526 , hd  50846 , hip  33237 ) , with an orbital period of 11.113 d , has one of the longer periods among the well - studied algol - type binaries ( richards & albright 1999 ; desmet et al .",
    "2010 ) , and is consequently ideally suited for investigation of the properties of an enduring accretion disk ( even though it is sometimes variable ) , along with those of the gas stream and other accretion structures .",
    "the components of algol - type binary systems are typically too close to resolve as individual stars .",
    "a notable exception is the bright and nearby system of algol ( @xmath1 per ) for which optical interferometry was used recently to resolve all three stars in that system ( zavala et al .",
    "2010 ) , with orbital parameters confirmed and refined by radio interferometry ( peterson et al .",
    "these direct imaging techniques are still not able to resolve any of the non - stellar components including the accretion disk and gas stream . instead , the non - stellar components can be revealed more readily with spectroscopy by disentangling the contributions of the stars from the composite spectrum . the receding / approaching sides of an accretion disk manifest as red / blue - shifted emission superposed on the stellar absorption line profile , as first noted by joy ( 1942 ) .",
    "the persistent presence of double - peaked h@xmath0 emission in the composite spectrum serves as one of the more prominent observational indicators of an enduring accretion disk .",
    "additional accretion features , such as the gas stream , also influence the spectral profile to a lesser extent ( e.g. , as excess redshifted absorption when the viewpoint is through the stream , and as emission when viewed across the stream ) .",
    "a two - dimensional velocity mapping of the gas in the stream and disk may be constructed through doppler tomography of the line profiles obtained at orbital phases around the binary ( e.g. , marsh & horne  1988 ; review by richards 2004 , and references therein ) .",
    "this technique has been extended to provide three - dimensional velocity maps ( e.g. , agafonov et al .",
    "2009 ; richards et al .  2010 ; richards et al .  2012 ) .",
    "hydrodynamic simulations provide another method of investigating the distribution of accreting gas , and can reproduce many of the features seen in the tomograms ( richards & ratliff 1998 ; bisikalo & kononov 2010 ; raymer 2012 ) .",
    "a complementary approach involves computing the spectral contribution from geometric representations of the accretion structures , so that the physical characteristics of the disk , stream , or other features ( size scales , density , temperature ) may be determined through matching the modeled synthetic spectra to the observations . in this work ,",
    "we make use of the _ shellspec _ program developed by budaj & richards ( 2004 ) .",
    "briefly , this program calculates the line - of - sight radiative transfer within the moving circumstellar environment , and the stars can have roche model geometries . for a given set of phases , a composite spectrum of the interacting binary is calculated with associated accretion structures : optionally including an accretion disk , a gas stream , a spot , a jet , and a shell .",
    "consideration of multiple transitions helps to break potential parameter space degeneracies in modeling .",
    "since algol - type binaries frequently display variable line profiles , plausibly due to changes in the rate of mass transfer ( e.g. , plavec & polidan 1976 ; richards & albright 1999 ; richards 2004 ) , the parameters determined from the comparison of models with the data at a particular epoch describe the then - dominant accretion mode , and multi - epoch observations are required to explore the full range of conditions occurring within the system .",
    "_ shellspec _ provides a flexible framework for modification and extension to related astrophysical topics ; for example , tkachenko et al .",
    "( 2009 , 2010 ) created an inverted version of the code to determine properties of the component stars ; budaj ( 2011a ) described an improved consideration of the reflection effect in _ shellspec _ which he applied to modeling the temperature distribution over the surface of transiting exoplanets ; budaj ( 2011b ) used _ shellspec _ to model dust disks in @xmath10  aur ; and chadima et al .",
    "( 2011 ) used _ shellspec _ along with zeus - mp hydrodynamic models to illustrate the phase - varying h@xmath0 v / r asymmetry resulting from injection of a blob of gaseous material ( such as could occur from discontinuous mass transfer prior to viscosity - driven smoothing ) .",
    "the current version of _ shellspec _ applies a straight cylindrical representation of the gas stream and a circularly symmetric accretion disk , and the user may upload a general 3d accretion structure with optional velocity , temperature , and density fields ( see www.astro.sk/@xmath5budaj/shellspec.html ) .",
    "accretion disks in algol - type binaries have often been suggested to lack circular symmetry or to possess regions of enhanced emission beyond that expected from a symmetric disk ( e.g. , the asymmetric disk model applied to ry per by barai et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , although their method did not include radiative transfer ) .",
    "_ shellspec _ modeling of the accretion structures in tt hya by budaj et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and miller et al .",
    "( 2007 ) demonstrated that the observed spectra could not be reproduced solely by the gas stream and a symmetric disk . in these cases ,",
    "_ shellspec _ can reproduce the observed characteristics through inclusion of the `` spot '' feature .    in this work",
    ", we investigate the partially - eclipsing long - period algol - type binary au mon . comprehensive studies of the components of au mon based on corot photometry were recently performed by desmet et al .",
    "( 2010 ) and djuraevi et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , with the former work including high - resolution spectroscopy to help constrain the stellar properties and the latter work additionally modeling the accretion disk ; we use their results for system elements .",
    "prior determinations of system parameters were made by sahade et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and vivekananda rao & sarma  ( 1998 ) , and values for the ephemeris and period of au mon were derived by lorenzi ( 1980 ) and kreiner ( 2004 ) . as in many algol - type binary systems ,",
    "the primary is carbon - poor , presumably due to deposition of cno - processed material ( ibanoglu et al .",
    "double - peaked h@xmath0 emission has been seen in all observations ( e.g. , plavec & polidan 1976 ; peters 1989 ; sahade et al .",
    "1996 , 1997 ; richards & albright 1999 ; desmet et al .  2010",
    "; barra & mennickent  2011 ) with a profile that may vary between epochs ( e.g. , plavec & polidan 1976 ; sahade et al .",
    "peters & polidan ( 1998 ) inferred a particle density in the disk of @xmath11  @xmath4 based on an examination of fuv features .",
    "peters & polidan ( 1984 , 1998 ) found evidence from uv spectra of a high - temperature accretion region ( htar ) in several algol - type binaries , including au mon .",
    "they determined that the htar was located near the trailing hemisphere of the primary ( i.e. , in the vicinity of the impact region where the gas stream collides with the stellar surface ) , with an electron temperature and density of around @xmath12  k and @xmath13  @xmath4 , and was carbon - depleted ( which suggested prior cno processing of this material ) .",
    "most recently , djuraevi et al .  (",
    "2010 ) re - analyzed corot and @xmath14-band photometry using a roche model with a non - transparent accretion disk .",
    "they found that a `` hot spot '' and two `` bright spots '' ( associated with spiral arms or deviations from a circular shape ) account for the observed asymmetry in the light curve of au mon .",
    "we discuss their model in more detail in @xmath153.1 .",
    "mimica & pavlovski  ( 2012 ) , also used corot photometry to independently characterize the disk of au  mon as possessing a `` clumpy '' structure .",
    "au mon was discovered by lorenzi ( 1980 ) to display a long - period variation in brightness of @xmath50.2 magnitudes , with a period of @xmath5417 days ( or 37.5 times the orbital period ) .",
    "this characteristic has now been associated with the double periodic variables ( dpv ; mennickent et al .",
    "2003 ) that show two photometric periods , one associated with orbital motion and the other a cyclic long - term light modulation that is about 35 times the orbital period .",
    "these systems tend to be more luminous than classical algols and are categorized by mass loss and circumbinary disks in addition to mass transfer between stars ; hence they can be used to provide constraints on non - conservative models of binary star evolution ( mennickent et al . 2008 ) .",
    "au mon was one of the first dpv systems discovered in our galaxy within the class of algol - type binaries ; its properties will be compared with v393 sco , a recently discovered dpv system ( mennickent et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "desmet et al .  (",
    "2010 ) found that the shape of the light curves of au mon during long - period maxima and minima are identical but offset , and suggested that the intensity variations are instead linked to changes in the attenuation from circumbinary material ; this interpretation is in agreement with djuraevi et al .",
    "mennickent et al .",
    "( 2008 ) hypothesized that variable mass outflow alters the amount of circumbinary material in dpvs , and mennickent et al .",
    "( 2010 ) associated the long - period variability in v393 sco with equatorial mass loss .",
    "however , peters ( 1994 ) found that the uv absorption associated with the gas stream was stronger when the stars were faint , and ascribed the long - period variation to changes in the mass transfer rate due to cyclic expansion and contraction of the secondary .",
    "consistent with this , barra & mennickent  ( 2011 ) showed that the h@xmath0 and h@xmath1 central absorption in au mon is likewise deeper near and following minimum light , and concluded that the profile variability may result from a changing circumprimary envelope influenced by mass loss through the l1 point .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : @xmath152 describes the data and observations , including previously unpublished high - resolution optical spectra of au mon ; @xmath153 contains the _ shellspec _ modeling process and the calculated characteristics of the accretion features ; @xmath154 considers spectral variability in au mon on both multi - year and multi - week timescales ; @xmath155 presents the doppler tomography results based on both observed and difference spectra , including comparisons between the observed spectra and the _ shellspec _ model of the stars , disk , gas stream , and a high density localized region ; @xmath156 provides a summary of our results .",
    "the ninety - five ( 95 ) high - resolution optical spectra of au mon which form the primary focus of this work were collected at four observatories over a period of 20 years from 1991 to 2011 : kitt peak national observatory ( kpno ) , hobby eberly telescope ( het ) , mdm observatory at kitt peak , and las campanas observatory ( lco ) .",
    "( the mdm observatory is operated by a consortium of five universities : the university of michigan , dartmouth college , the ohio state university , columbia university , and ohio university . )",
    "these observations are presented here for the first time , with the exception of 13 kpno spectra .",
    "the observations are listed in table 1 .",
    "seventy - two ( 72 ) h@xmath0 spectra of au mon were obtained at kpno during several observing runs from 1991 to 2001 .",
    "most of these spectra were obtained with the 0.9 m coud feed telescope using grating a , providing a resolution of @xmath1620,000 across a spectral field of @xmath5345 .",
    "thirteen ( 13 ) of these spectra were obtained in 1994 by richards and were previously described in richards & albright ( 1999 ) . in addition , twenty - four ( 24 ) het spectra were obtained with the het high - resolution spectrograph ( hrs ) over 42 nights in 2002 december and 2003 january , with the 316g5936 cross disperser at a resolution of @xmath1730,000 and cover 42008000   .",
    "the het spectra include both the h@xmath0 and the h@xmath1 regions . finally ,",
    "six ( 6 ) current - epoch spectra were obtained at mdm observatory ( 5 h@xmath0 spectra , 2011 february ) and at las campanas ( 1 optical spectrum , 2011 november ) .",
    "the mdm h@xmath0 spectra were obtained with the 2.4 m hiltner telescope using the boller and chivens ccd spectrograph ( ccds ) with the 1800 grating , providing a resolution of r@xmath187,500 across a spectral field of @xmath5330 , and the lco optical spectra were obtained with the 6.5 m clay magellan telescope using the magellan inamori kyocera chelle ( mike ) double - chelle spectrograph , providing a resolution of r@xmath1830,000 near h@xmath0 .",

    "this scatter makes it difficult to ascertain whether additional effects seen in tt hya are also present in au mon ; for example , it appears that the tendency for greater blue emission at @xmath25 and greater red emission at @xmath26 ( thought to arise from absorption of the light from the secondary by one side of the disk as well as by the primary ; above references ) is suggested but not required by these data .",
    "the scatter in the central absorption is reduced when the spectra obtained over different regions of the long - period phase are considered separately , and those taken within @xmath27 show deeper central absorption than those taken within @xmath28 or @xmath29 .",

    "the long - term variation in si ii is primarily due to changes in disk absorption that maximizes around a @xmath23 of @xmath32 . the si iv variations are predominately on the trailing hemisphere and reflect an enhancement of the htar ( peters & polidan 1984 ) and some si iv absorption from the gas stream .",
    "the correlation with @xmath23 of h@xmath0 central absorption , and other htar lines _ versus _ equivalent widths and the uv flux distribution do not support ascribing the long - term brightness variation to attenuation by circumbinary material ( desmet et al .",

    "2010 ) . instead",
    ", these periodic tendencies are consistent with the hypothesis of variable mass transfer over the long - period phase ( e.g. , due to oscillations in the size of the secondary ) , peaking near @xmath33 , with the consequent build up of a thick disk over @xmath34 ( peters 1994 ; the long - period phases in that paper should be adjusted by about @xmath35 to match the ephemeris of desmet et al .",
    "the circumprimary envelope conjectured by barra & mennickent  ( 2011 ) is a similar concept .",
    "a thick disk , enduring over 1020 orbital periods , can produce both the enhanced absorption and the deeper h@xmath0 central absorption seen during @xmath27 , and typically decrease the light from the primary through continuous and line opacities .",
    "the collapse of the thick disk could then heat the photosphere of the b star and perhaps generate the 1000014000  k plasma suggested by peters ( 1994 ) as the well - tuned system recovers to equilibrium before the next episode of enhanced mass transfer . in this scenario , the self - similar orbital light curve shape at long - period maxima and minima ( desmet et al .",
    "2010 ; djuraevi et al .",
    "2010 ) may indicate that as the thick disk collapses the outer regions puff up or flare to extend beyond the orbital plane , which is potentially related to the l3 mass loss near maximum long - period brightness proposed by peters ( 1994 ) .",
    "some of the uv line profiles also vary with the binary photometric phase @xmath21 .",
    "for example , the doublet shows increased redshifted absorption near the binary photometric phase of @xmath36 , ascribed by peters ( 1994 ) to absorption within the infalling gas stream . in @xmath153.2",
    ", we demonstrate through _ shellspec _ modeling that this effect can indeed be produced by the gas stream .",

    "the shape of the secondary star is calculated by _ shellspec _ assuming that it fills its roche lobe , hence the quoted radius is the average roche lobe radius .",
    "the parameters specifying the accretion disk were set interactively for each trial ; table  3 lists those from our final preferred model . a gas stream ( with parameters held constant ) was also included for most of the modeling , as described below .",
    "finally , the output synthetic composite spectra were compared to the observed spectra at a range of phases . as part of this process",
    ", difference profiles were computed by subtracting the synthetic from the observed spectra .",
    "we identified through trial and error an initial set of accretion disk parameters that provided a reasonable match to the observed optical and uv spectra , then considered the effect of the mass - transfer stream before further refining the disk model .",
    "the influence of the gas stream is subtle relative to that of the disk , and the precise properties of the stream are only loosely constrained here .",
    "after examining a range of parameters , we adopted a set that successfully reproduces the redshifted absorption observed in ( and to a lesser degree in h@xmath0 ) at @xmath51 .",
    "this stream component was then included unchanged in all subsequent modeling , while the disk parameters were varied over a grid to improve the disk model ; consistent inclusion of the relatively minor contribution of the gas stream throughout reduces the possibility of biasing the disk properties by attempting to match an incomplete model to the observations .",

    "a total of 625 potential models were generated by varying these four parameters through five different values each , straddling the parameters of the initial model used to characterize the stream .",
    "specifically , the considered values spanned 2.87.6 @xmath2 in steps of 1.2 @xmath2 for thickness ; 1725 @xmath2 in steps of 2 @xmath2 for outer radius ; 2500033000  k in steps of 2000  k for characteristic temperature ; and 70130@xmath52  g  @xmath4 in steps of 15@xmath52  g  @xmath4 for density .",
    "the degree to which each model matched the data was assessed through calculation of a goodness - of - fit statistic ( sum of squared residuals within the relevant spectral region ) , determined for each model at each of the 24 het phases for h@xmath0 and h@xmath1 and at each of the 47 _ iue _ phases for and .",
    "the other h@xmath0 data were not considered in this process , since it is desirable to model the h@xmath0 emission over a sufficiently short time interval to exclude long - term dynamical changes that might occur in the accretion disk .",
    "the results of the modeling are shown in figure  5 for a representative set of nine het / h@xmath0 phases covering the full orbit .",
    "the agreement with the fit is illustrated using a color scale ( red indicates good agreement , blue a poor match ) for parameter pairs ; the goodness - of - fit indicator is projected across the other two parameters using mean values .",
    "each cell is therefore constructed from nine phases and projected down from 25 models . while there is some unavoidable degeneracy in the h@xmath0 modeling ( e.g. , increased disk emission",
    "may be obtained either from increasing the density or the thickness ) , there are clearly favored regions of parameter space .",
    "specific consideration of the eclipse phases is helpful for clarifying the structure , and the goodness - of - fit for and across identical grids provides useful additional constraints upon temperature .",
    "it appears that models at the extreme ends of the grid are excluded ; for example , there is only poor agreement with observations for models with simultaneously large values of thickness and outer radius , or thickness and density , or outer radius and density , and similarly poor agreement for simultaneously small values of those parameters .",
    "the disk is most readily apparent in the double - peaked h@xmath0 emission , and hence the het / h@xmath0 data drive the modeling .",
    "however , the disk is also visible in the difference profiles for other optical ( e.g. , h@xmath1 ) and uv lines , and the additional spectral constraints help lift degeneracies in the disk parameters that are present if analysis is restricted to the h@xmath0 line .    from the _ shellspec _ modeling , we derived preferred parameters for the accretion disk ( marked on figure  5 by bold - bordered squares ; see also table  3 ) : a thickness of 5.2 @xmath2 , an outer radius of 23 @xmath2 , a characteristic temperature of 29000  k ( corresponding to a maximum temperature of @xmath1814000  k ) , and a density of @xmath53  g  @xmath4 , with a turbulence velocity of 30  km  s@xmath7",
    ". some of the other disk models considered can not be ruled out ; for example , with higher densities ( @xmath54  g  @xmath4 ) a smaller thickness ( 4.0 @xmath2 ) is possible , or alternatively with lower densities ( @xmath55  g  @xmath4 ) a larger thickness ( 6.4 @xmath2 ) is possible .",
    "a larger outer disk radius is tenable , and in general models bordering the preferred parameters acceptably match the data .    by examining the h@xmath0 profiles ( e.g. , figure  6 )",
    ", we found that the preferred disk plus stream model gives a slightly improved match to observations with the additional inclusion of a relatively minor `` spot '' component .",
    "this spot is located at the outer disk edge at coordinates of ( @xmath4418 , @xmath4418 ) @xmath2 ( in a primary - centered system ) with a radius of 2.6 @xmath2 , a temperature of 8000  k , a density of 80@xmath5610@xmath40  g  @xmath4 , a velocity vector of ( @xmath44120 , 120 )  km  s@xmath7 , and a turbulence of 100  km  s@xmath7 .",
    "these parameters have large uncertainties of @xmath53040% , since this spot has only an incremental impact on the model profile .",
    "this `` spot '' may be physically associated with disk asymmetries , such as caused by an elliptical rather than circular shape , a clumpy structure , or brighter regions .",
    "one example is the high density localized region along the line of centers between the stars where the gas that has circled the primary slows down because of contact with the incoming gas stream ( richards 1992 ) .",
    "the preferred model ( including stars , disk , stream , and spot ) is plotted in figure  6 along with the same representative set of nine het / h@xmath0 spectra used to generate figure  5 . in the lower left subplots , the effect of varying one parameter in isolation by one step along the grid is shown .",
    "our estimated uncertainties on the modeled accretion disk parameters are one grid step ; for example , the outer radius is 23@xmath572 @xmath2 . in the upper right subplots ,",
    "the models for the disk alone and for the disk plus stream are also shown . in the model , it is clear that a substantial fraction of the h@xmath0 emission originates from the disk . during the partial primary eclipse , only a small fraction of the central disk region is eclipsed , which may slightly reduce the h@xmath0 emission . however , since the contribution to the spectral continuum due to the primary star ( the dominant source of light in the system ) is significantly diminished at these phases , the h@xmath0 emission is strongly enhanced relative to that continuum .",
    "this result occurs because the spectra are not displayed in absolute units but are normalized relative to the continuum .",
    "this effect is naturally taken into account in _",
    "our modeling suggests that the accretion disk extends to larger radii and is thicker than found by djuraevi et al .",
    "( 2010 ) from their analysis of corot and @xmath14-band light curve data . however , our _ shellspec _ calculations are primarily based on h@xmath0 spectroscopy for which the disk is visible in emission even when the line is optically thin ; in contrast , the disk as modeled by djuraevi et al .",
    "( 2010 ) is non - transparent ( optically thick in the continuum ) , which results in smaller dimensions .",
    "in addition , their disk includes a hot spot and two bright spots , which produce embedded compact regions of enhanced emission , while our disk is circularly symmetric .",
    "consequently , the differences in disk dimensions are not necessarily in conflict .",
    "indeed , our disk may be regarded as having a wavelength - dependent effective size , which is a function of the opacities in the lines and in the continuum .",
    "it is additionally possible that the parameters of the disk when modeled by djuraevi et al .",
    "( 2010 ) physically differed from those present when we collected our het observations , which serve as the primary basis for our modeling .",
    "the large disk in au  mon may explain the particularly prominent h@xmath0 emission that is visible near primary eclipse ; this is different from v393 sco , for which the disk is likely to be more optically thick and less extended ( mennickent et al .",
    "2012 ) .",
    "the free parameters of interest for the gas stream are the initial and final velocities , the initial density , the temperature , the radius , and the turbulence . in the _ shellspec _ code , the density within the stream decreases as the material falls toward the primary star , such that @xmath58 remains constant along the length of the stream .",
    "the coordinates of the origin and termination of the stream are specified within the code , and form the endpoints of the straight cylinder that represents the stream . in this case , the stream extends from ( 35 , 0)@xmath2 to ( 5 , 5)@xmath2 .",
    "similar results are expected from a finer geometric model of the stream that takes into account its curvature due to orbital motion , the full velocity field , and likely changing radius .",
    "the preferred parameters for the stream are initial / final velocities of 100/500  km  s@xmath7 , an initial density of @xmath59  g  @xmath4 , a temperature of 8000  k , a radius of 4 @xmath2 , and a turbulence velocity of 100  km  s@xmath7 ; with relatively large uncertainties of @xmath515 - 25% .",
    "the influence of the gas stream is apparent as absorption at @xmath51 , as discussed in @xmath152 .",
    "for example , inclusion of the stream has no appreciable impact on the modeled line profile at low orbital phases , but figure  8 illustrates that at @xmath60 the infalling stream , viewed here against the primary , generates significant redshifted absorption that improves the agreement between model and observations .",
    "we noticed that the blue side of the lines was variable near orbital phase 0.5 ; this is similar to the si ii variability observed by peters ( 1994 ) which was interpreted as due to episodic mass loss .",
    "the final model provides a reasonable match to this variable line profile .",
    "the absorption at high orbital phases is less noticeable at h@xmath0 since a mass - transfer stream will tend to absorb relatively more light at shorter wavelengths ( e.g. , olson & bell 1998 ) .",
    "however , at a temperature of 8000  k the stream also acts to provide additional h@xmath0 emission at other phases ; for example , at @xmath61 the stream generates slightly blueshifted emission that improves the agreement between model and observations ( figure  6 ) .",
    "inclusion of the stream has only a negligible effect for the h@xmath1 ( figure  7 ) and regions .",
    "the velocity and density adopted for the gas stream correspond to a mass - transfer rate of @xmath5@xmath6 yr@xmath7 ; this should be regarded as a lower limit since the loosely constrained temperature of the stream is set near the peak emissivity of h@xmath0 .",
    "measurements of any changes in the period over the last several decades would provide an independent estimate of the mass - transfer rate in au  mon .",
    "the rate we derive here from _ shellspec _",
    "modeling is broadly similar to mass - transfer estimates for other long - period algol - type binary systems , such as tt  hya ( @xmath62=6.95  d , @xmath63=0.27 ) , for which miller et al .  ( 2007 ) calculated a rate of @xmath64  yr@xmath7 , or the non - eclipsing cx  dra ( @xmath62=6.70  d , @xmath63=0.23 ) , for which simon  ( 1998 ) calculated a rate of @xmath65  yr@xmath7 .",
    "the h@xmath0 spectra described in this work reveal changes in the emission line profile on both short ( multi - week ) and long ( multi - year ) timescales over the 20-year period from 1991 to 2011 and covering 697 orbital cycles ( see figure  9 ) ; this is consistent with previous observations ( e.g. , plavec & polidan 1976 ; sahade et al .",
    "1997 ; desmet et al .",
    "the het data were taken over @xmath542 days ( @xmath53.8 orbital periods ) , with a 10-day gap in the coverage .",
    "the 10 spectra obtained prior to this gap typically show deeper central absorption than the 14 spectra obtained after the gap .",
    "this is likely simply due to random short - term variability , although it is alternatively possible that the decrease in central absorption depth is partially related to the modest increase in the long - period phase , which transitions from @xmath66 to @xmath67 over the gap in coverage .",
    "figure  9 illustrates the rapidity with which the profile can change over only two orbital cycles ( e.g. , epoch 883 to 885 ) .",
    "we ran the grid of models on five subsets of h@xmath0 spectra , separated by long - period phase , to investigate potential changes in the structure of the disk .",
    "the subsets were grouped as @xmath68 ( peters kpno ) , @xmath69 ( first richards kpno ) , @xmath70 ( second richards kpno ) , @xmath71 ( first het ) , and @xmath72 ( second het ) .",
    "although the preferred model is better matched to the first set of het spectra than to the second , the change in central absorption does not systematically alter the relative goodness - of - fit across the model grid ( i.e. , generally the same subset of models remains favored ) .",
    "the peters kpno spectra are also reasonably well - fit by the preferred model and its similar cousins . in contrast , both sets of richards kpno spectra have increased emission and are better fit by a stronger disk , for example with a thickness of 6.4 @xmath2 and an outer radius of 25 @xmath2 ; it is additionally necessary to increase the stream contribution through changing the density to 120@xmath52  g  @xmath4 , but this is still not sufficient to provide a very good match to the shallower central absorption .",
    "the excess low - velocity emission suggests the presence of additional material beyond that contained in the circularly symmetric disk and the stream ( see tomography results in  5 ) ; while the disk remains dominant , the residual emission seems more centralized .",
    "this behavior is reminiscent of cx dra , for which richards et al .",
    "( 2000 ) concluded that the emission originates primarily between the stars as a result of the impact of the stream onto the outer edge of an extended disk .",
    "it is also consistent with vertical outflows similar to the bipolar wind hypothesized in the double periodic variable v393 sco ( mennickent et al .",
    "2012 ) . in any event ,",
    "since the long - period phase is similar for the richards kpno and the het data , these results demonstrate that the long - period phase is not the sole driver of h@xmath0 variability .      the model presented in @xmath153 including the stars , disk , stream , and a standard spot provides a good match to the majority of the _ iue _ observations . however , an additional secondary absorption feature is present in several spectra .",
    "this transient spectral feature has the following characteristics : ( i ) the profile shape appears to require some blueshifted absorption , rather than arising exclusively from a spike of low - velocity emission ; ( ii ) the feature is only found in spectra obtained at @xmath73 , although most spectra at these phases do not show the feature ; ( iii ) there is no obvious correlation in the presence of this feature with the long - period phase @xmath23 ; and ( iv ) the feature is present in 5/13 cases in and in 2/13 cases also in and .",
    "( there is one exceptional case in which the line profile is distorted at but not , at an intermediate phase , but here the profile may be more consistent with excess low - velocity emission . )",
    "this feature is unlikely to be related to any potential calibration issues , since it has a consistent profile when it is present in both and .",
    "it is also unlikely to be of geocoronal or interstellar origin , since it is variable and its presence is confined to a specific system phase .",
    "the transient uv feature could in principle result from some combination of blueshifted absorption and increased central emission . for example , bisikalo & kononov ( 2010 ) discuss a flare in the cv ss  cyg that generated strong h@xmath74 emission while also broadening the absorption .",
    "another possibility is that the feature results from a p - cygni profile overlaying the stellar absorption , although this would require material at larger radii ( limiting the temperature and hence the impact on ) . in au",
    "mon , the feature primarily modifies the blue side of the profile , and the absorption then extends to shorter wavelengths than the disk plus stream model predicts .",
    "we conjecture that the transient spectral feature is associated with an occasional outflow arising in the vicinity of the disk - stream interaction site , which is hot and of variable temperature .",
    "it is possible that such an outflow could be related to the htar described by peters & polidan ( 1984 , 1988 ) and that both are consequences of the stream impacting the disk and primary . in this context , the van rensbergen et al .",
    "( 2011 ) result may be relevant : that algols with hotter primaries ( such as au  mon ) may experience more mass loss than those with cooler primaries ( such as tt  hya )",
    ".    we used _",
    "shellspec _ to verify that it is possible to produce such an outflow feature ( figure  10 ) by using a second `` spot '' component in addition to the spot applied in the full model to represent the localized region between the stars ; the extra spot is only used here to illustrate the transient uv feature .",
    "an `` outflow spot '' located at coordinates of ( 8 , 6 ) @xmath2 with a velocity vector of ( 120 , 120 )  km  s@xmath7 and with a spot radius / density / temperature of @xmath75  g  @xmath76  k , significantly improves the agreement between the modeled and observed uv spectra for those cases in which this additional absorption feature is present .",
    "the degree of improvement varies , as might be expected given the variable nature of the feature itself .",
    "although the outflow spot parameters are based on the uv spectra , the addition of this component would also improve the agreement between the modeled and observed optical spectra in several cases .",
    "for example , both the h@xmath0 and h@xmath1 spectra at @xmath77 show features in the red wing that are better matched when the transient outflow is included ; this effect may be partially due to the outflow spot component replacing disk emission within the overlapping region .",
    "doppler tomography provides an independent method of investigating the accretion structure of au  mon , and of evaluating the accuracy of the _ shellspec _ modeling ( described in @xmath153 ) .",
    "the basic assumptions and constraints of doppler tomography include ( marsh & horne 1988 ; richards 2004 ) : ( 1 ) the spectra are assumed to be broadened primarily by doppler motions , ( 2 ) spectra with high wavelength resolution and good resolution in orbital phase ( or projections ) are needed to create a well - resolved image , ( 3 ) spectra dominated by emission lines are primarily used in the analysis , ( 4 ) the gas is assumed to be optically thin , and ( 5 ) the object ( velocity field+state quantities ) does not change with time .",
    "several accretion structures have been identified in the 2d and 3d doppler tomograms based on optical and ultraviolet spectra of algol - type binaries ( e.g. , richards 2004 ; richards et al .",
    "these include classical and transient accretion disks , the gas stream , emission from the chromosphere and other magnetic structures on the donor star ( e.g. , prominences and coronal mass ejections ) , shock regions , an accretion annulus , and an absorption zone ( corresponding to a region of hotter gas ) .",
    "moreover , tomography was used to demonstrate the quality of _ shellspec _ models for the gas stream and disk in tt hya , and to discover that the disk in tt hya is asymmetric ( miller et al .",
    "this procedure was extended for the study of au mon .",
    "the observed spectra of au mon obtained over a range of phases were combined to construct a two - dimensional velocity - space map of the emission from the stars and accretion structures .",
    "figure  11 shows the good match between the observed spectra and the model based on the stars , disk , stream , and a spot / localized region .",
    "the left frames show the doppler tomogram , contour map , and interpolated trailed spectrogram based on the observed spectra , while the right frames show the results based on the combined model for the stars , disk , stream , and spot .",
    "the observed tomogram shows that the strong h@xmath0 emission arises primarily from the region in the tomogram that corresponds to the locus of a circular keplerian accretion disk .",
    "since a non - keplerian disk would have a range of lower velocities , the tomogram suggests that the disk is keplerian .",
    "the gap in the h@xmath0 disk emission seen near @xmath78 is due to limited coverage at those phases ( see figure  1 ) .",
    "the contour maps show that the model is fairly close to the observations .",
    "figure  12 shows the 2d doppler tomograms obtained when the model spectra for the various structures ( stars , disk , stream , and spot ) are sequentially removed from the observed spectra .",
    "this figure shows the cartesian representation of the binary ( top left ) , the observed and combined model tomograms ( top right ) , the difference tomograms in sequence ( middle frames ) for ( 1 ) observed - stars , ( 2 ) obs-(stars+disk ) , ( 3 ) obs-(stars+disk+stream ) , and ( 4 ) obs-(stars+disk+stream+spot ) .",
    "the images for the latter three are enhanced in the bottom frames .",
    "it is apparent that the h@xmath0 emission in au mon is dominated by the accretion disk , then by the stream , and spot ( localized region , lr ) .",
    "the relatively weak contribution from the gas stream is apparent in the tomogram of the synthetic spectrum constructed from the stars+disk+stream model , and in the tomogram of the difference profile when the stars+disk model is subtracted .",
    "the bulk of the stream emission occurs at velocities less than @xmath5400  km  s@xmath7 , corresponding to the relatively higher density regions closer to the stream launch point at l1 .",
    "this may reflect the inner stream being subsumed within the disk as it approaches the primary , which is modeled in _ shellspec _ through prioritizing the disk in overlapping regions .",
    "[ f12 ]    the images show that we have successfully modeled the dominant part of the disk , the gas stream , and the brightest part of the lr spot feature .",
    "however , the final image shows that there are still two parts of the image that remain : a low velocity region near the lr and also an asymmetric portion of the disk .",
    "the location of this residual emission in velocity space is broadly similar to that observed in tt  hya , which miller et al .",
    "( 2007 ) ascribed to an asymmetric disk , as supported by hydrodynamic simulations by richards & ratliff  ( 1998 ) ; it seems plausible that the disk in au  mon is also asymmetric .",
    "moreover , compared to tt  hya , the residual emission in au  mon is more pronounced and has clearly sub - keplerian velocities .",
    "a possible explanation for these lower velocities is that the stream in au mon makes a nearly tangential collision with the primary ( see figure  1 ) , reducing the circular speed of the continuing flow , which could then contribute additional low - velocity emission , particularly along the line of centers where the density rises due to conservation of particle flux as it collides with the incoming gas stream . in the case of tt",
    "hya , the system geometry precludes the stream from a direct collision with the primary . given the early spectral type of the primary in au mon , it is also possible that the residual emission seen in the tomogram could be explained by a vertical wind or jet as found in @xmath1 lyr ( ak et al .",
    "2007 ) and v393 sco ( mennickent et al . 2012 ) .",
    "the 2d tomograms displayed in figures  11 and 12 ( top frames ) suggest that the disk in au mon extends almost to the roche surface of the primary ( since the inner disk velocity is similar to that of the roche surface ) , so any subsequent gas flow from the l1 point would be intercepted by this extended disk structure and perhaps create a jet - like feature .",
    "a similar extended disk structure was also found in cx dra ( richards et al . 2000 ) .",
    "these features might be confirmed later through the application of 3d tomography . in the meantime , it is encouraging that a modified _ shellspec _ model with an added outflow spot component beyond the full synthetic spectrum based on the stars+disk+stream+spot / lr can provide a better match to the observations than when the outflow region is excluded ; as illustrated in the case of the line ( see figure  10 ) .",
    "the tomograms do not show any obvious evidence of mass loss or depletion in the emission associated with the l2 and l3 points ( see large lavendar dots along the line of centers , beyond the stars in figure  12 ) .",
    "however , if mass loss has occurred or is in progress , then the tomograms confirm that there is a greater likelihood that the source should be located near the l1 point , as suggested by barra & mennickent  ( 2011 ) .",
    "although the h@xmath0 central absorption changes in depth throughout the long - period cycle ( figure  3 ) , the residual emission revealed in the final frame of figure  12 is present for both @xmath27 and @xmath79 , confirming that this effect is tied to the relative geometry of the stars , disk , and stream , rather than arising from long - period variability such as due to cyclic changes in the mass transfer rate .",
    "the main results from our observations and modeling of accretion structures in au  mon are the following :    \\1 .",
    "we confirm that the h@xmath0 and uv spectral features display significant variability , some of which is linked to the long - period phase . for example , spectra taken within @xmath27 show deeper central absorption than those taken within @xmath80 or @xmath81 .",
    "we find that these trends are broadly consistent with the scenario of variable mass transfer proposed by peters  ( 1994 ) .",
    "we use _ shellspec _ to self - consistently model the accretion disk and gas stream .",
    "preferred parameters for the disk and stream are determined through comparison to observed spectra ; for the accretion disk , they include a thickness of 5.2 @xmath2 , an outer radius of 23 @xmath2 , a maximum temperature of @xmath1814000  k , and a density of @xmath82  g  @xmath4 , and for the stream they include initial / final velocities of 100/500  km  s@xmath7 , an initial density of @xmath59  g  @xmath4 , a temperature of 8000  k , and a radius of 4 @xmath2 .",
    "a lower limit for the mass transfer rate was found to be @xmath5@xmath6 yr@xmath7 .",
    "we generate doppler tomograms from the observed and difference spectra to investigate the two - dimensional accretion structure in velocity space",
    ". sequential removal of the stellar / disk / stream / spot components confirms the accuracy of the _ shellspec _ modeling , and additionally identifies unmodeled aspects of the system .",
    "these include an asymmetric component of an elliptical accretion disk , and material moving at sub - keplerian velocities that provides excess h@xmath0 emission , plausibly associated with the continuation of the mass transfer stream beyond the splash site or perhaps an source of outflow or mass loss from the system .",
