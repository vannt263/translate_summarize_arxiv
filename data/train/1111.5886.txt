    "recent observations have warned us that the @xmath0cdm ( @xmath0+cold dark matter ) cosmology might not be the ultimate truth of the universe even though it works well on the large scale .",
    "the increasing amount of the observational evidences on the ( sub-)galactic scale against the @xmath0cdm model that have been accumulated for the past decade should be no longer dismissed nor overlooked under the shield of unknown complicated baryonic physics .",
    "the mismatches of the theoretical predictions based on the @xmath0cdm model with the observations on the ( sub-)galactic scales have so far been routinely attributed to our lack of knowledge about all complicated baryonic processes involved in the formation of galaxies .",
    "but the recent rapid progresses in observational and numerical studies have indicated that it may not fully rescue the @xmath0cdm cosmology to take into account highly nonlinear baryon effects .",
    "for example , the observed flat density cores of the dark - matter - dominated low surface brightness galaxies ( lsbgs ) ( see * ? ? ? * for a comprehensive review ) have been regarded as one of the most serious observational challenges on the sub - galactic scale to the @xmath0cdm cosmology which predicts the cuspy density cores @xcite .",
    "recent work of @xcite have revealed that the baryonic processes are unlikely to flatten the density cores of the lsbgs , by comparing thoroughly the simulated disk galaxies in hydrodynamical simulations with the observed lsbgs .",
    "nevertheless , there is a good reason that the @xmath0cdm model is still regarded as the standard one .",
    "although many authors have so far made strenuous endeavors to devise a better ( and hopefully more fundamental ) cosmological theory expecting it to work as well as the @xmath0cdm model on the large scale while simultaneously resolving all of the ( sub-)galactic scale tensions of the @xmath0cdm cosmology with observations , no alternative theory has so far been capable of defeating the @xmath0cdm model .",
    "the difficulty in coming up with a viable alternative lies in the fact that the small - scale agreements of a model tends to be achieved only at the cost of its large - scale agreements and vice - versa . to make matters worse ,",
    "when a model was found to be consistent with the observations on the large scales , then it has turned out to be not distinguishable from the @xmath0cdm cosmology .",
    "unprecedentedly ample amount of high - quality data recently available from observations and hydrodynamical simulations , however , gives us a hope that it might be possible to eventually distinguish between the candidate cosmological models and to finally rule some of them out .",
    "the key question is what statistical property of the universe on the ( sub-)galactic scale would be the most useful tool to achieve this goal . here , we suggest the spin alignments in isolated galaxy pairs as a unique tool to test coupled dark energy ( cde ) models , one of the currently popular alternatives to the @xmath0cdm cosmology , in which the acceleration of the universe is driven by a dynamical scalar field dark energy ( de ) , @xmath2 , coupled to the non - baryonic cdm under the influence of scalar self - interaction potential @xmath3 @xcite .    in the cde picture",
    "the long - range fifth force generated by the de - cdm coupling plays a role of enhancing the density and velocity perturbations in the linear regime relative to the @xmath0cdm case @xcite , which eventually leads to the earlier formation and faster merging of dark halos .",
    "since the galaxy angular momentum depends strongly on both of the density and velocity perturbations in the linear regime , the relative spin orientations in galaxy pairs would differ among the candidate cde models which are characterized by different shapes of the coupling function @xmath4 and self - interaction potential @xmath3 .",
    "the following two recent literatures have motivated us to do this work .",
    "the first one is @xcite who showed that there is no significant spin alignments in pairs of late - type galaxies from the seventh data release of the sloan digital sky survey ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter , sdss dr7 ) .",
    "the second one is @xcite who performed high - resolution hydrodynamic simulations ( h - codecs ) for various cde models and released the data to the public very recently . analyzing the h - codecs halo catalogs at @xmath5",
    ", we find it possible in principle to test the cde models by comparing their predictions on the spin alignments in galaxy pairs with the observational result .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in  2 ,",
    "a brief description of the halo and subhalo catalogs from h - codecs is provided . in  3 ,",
    "we explain how the spin alignments in isolated pairs of galactic halos identified using h - codecs data are determined , how the probability density distribution of the alignment angles is derived at @xmath5 for each cde model , and how the spin alignment signals depend on the total mass and separation distance in galaxy pairs . in  4 , the spin alignments in pairs of late - type galaxies from the sdss dr7 are calculated and its probability density distribution is compared with the numerical results from the h - codecs . in  5 ,",
    "the possibility of testing bouncing cde model with the spin alignments in galaxy pairs is discussed and a final conclusion is stated .",
    "@xcite conducted a series of h - codecs ( hydrodynamical coupled dark energy simulations ) with the modified gadget-2 code @xcite on a periodic box of volume @xmath6 , which contain approximately @xmath7 gas particles on the top of the same number of cdm particles .",
    "the individual gas and cdm particle mass is @xmath8 and @xmath9 at @xmath5 , respectively . using the sph ( smoooth particle hydrodynamics ) technique incorporated in the gadget-2 code @xcite ,",
    "the adiabatic hydrodynamical forces were computed in each h - codecs runs to track down the dynamical evolution of the gas particles .    released to the public were all the numerical data from the h - codecs for five different cde models , namely , exp001 , exp002 , exp003 , exp008e3 and sugra003 as well as the standard @xmath0cdm model .",
    "the simulation runs for all six models started from the same initial conditions consistent with the wmap7 parameters and the linear power spectra of all models are also normalized to have the same amplitudes at the epoch of decoupling .",
    "the first three cde models have the exponential form of the scalar self - interaction potential @xcite , @xmath10 , and constant coupling functions : @xmath11 and @xmath12 for the exp001 , exp002 and exp003 , respectively , which are all within the current limits on the cde coupling strength from observations @xcite .",
    "the exp008e3 model has the same exponential potential , @xmath10 , but with time - dependent coupling function of @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the sugra003 is a bouncing cde model characterized by supergravity potential @xcite , @xmath14 , and by negative value of constant coupling of @xmath15 .",
    "see @xcite who provides much more comprehensive introduction of general cde cosmologies as well as more detailed explanations on the above six specific cde models .",
    "the bound halos and their subhalos are identified by applying the standard friends - of - friends ( fof ) with linkage parameter of @xmath16 ) and the subfind algorithm to the h - codecs , respectively , for each cosmological model @xcite .",
    "the h - codecs halo catalog provides information on the number of subhalos ( @xmath17 ) , fof mass , position , and velocity of each halo , while information on the numbers of particles ( @xmath18 ) , masses ( @xmath19 ) , positions , specific angular momenta ( @xmath20 ) of all the subhalos belonging to each halo is available in the h - codecs substructure catalog . here",
    ", the halo mass corresponds to the collapsed mass measured at @xmath5 as the sum of all the gas and cdm particles belonging to the same fof groups .",
    "thus the halo mass has the same meaning in the six cosmological models since the mass of each individual particle has the same value at @xmath5 in all of the six models ( e.g. , see * ? ? ?",
    ". for more detailed explanations on the h - codecs project and its halo / substructure catalogs , see @xcite and visit the codecs webpage .",
    "analyzing the halo and subhalo catalogs at @xmath5 from h - codecs for each cosmological model , we identify those halos which have only two subhalos ( @xmath21 ) without belonging to any larger halos and regard the two subhalos in each identified halo as an isolated galaxy pair . to avoid those poorly resolved subhalos whose specific angular momentum vectors are likely to suffer from inaccurate measurements , we select only those halos among the identified ones in which each of the two subhalos has @xmath22 or more particles .",
    "we focus here only on the _ isolated _ pairs of galactic halos located in low - density regions to control the environmental effect on the spin orientations to the minimum level , which help single out the cde effect .",
    "table [ tab : pair ] lists the number ( @xmath23 ) of the selected galaxy pairs , the median mass of the halo ( @xmath24 ) , the median masses of the two subhalos ( @xmath25 and @xmath26 in a decreasing order ) in pairs for the six cosmological models .",
    "as can be seen , the six samples have almost the same median masses . the maximum difference in @xmath24 and in @xmath27 among the six models",
    "is less than @xmath28 .",
    "figure [ fig : m_dis ] plots the probability density distributions of the total mass of the selected galaxy pairs , @xmath29 , for the six cosmological models . as can be seen ,",
    "the distributions @xmath29 are very similar to one another with almost the same width , height , and location of the maximum value of @xmath29 at ( @xmath30 ) among the six models .",
    "this result confirms that our six samples of the isolated galaxy pairs are comparable to one another in mass .",
    "in fact , this result should be naturally expected since the same algorithm was employed to find the isolated galaxy pairs for each model case .",
    "figure [ fig : r_dis ] plots the probability density distributions of the separation distance in galaxy pair , @xmath31 . as can be seen , the distributions are quite similar to one another , too , having the characteristic small-@xmath32 tail , reaching their maximum values at @xmath33kpc .    for each selected galaxy pair ,",
    "we calculate the cosine of the angle , @xmath34 , between the two specific angular momentum vectors as @xmath35 where @xmath36 . here",
    "we restrict the range of the angle , @xmath37 , to @xmath38 $ ] since what matters is not the signs of the two angular momentum vectors but their relative orientations . binning the values of @xmath34 in range of @xmath39 $ ] and counting the number of the selected galaxy - pairs belonging to each @xmath34-bin",
    ", we determine the probability density distribution , @xmath40 , for each cosmological model . if the two specific angular momentum vectors in galaxy pairs have strong tendency to be aligned with each other , then the probability distribution @xmath40 is expected to increase as @xmath34 increases .",
    "if there is no alignment tendency , then it must be uniform , @xmath41 , over the range of @xmath42 .",
    "the stronger alignment tendency will be manifest as the higher degree of the deviation of @xmath40 from the uniform distribution .",
    "figure [ fig : cost_dis ] plots the probability density distributions of @xmath34 for the six models . as can be seen , for the @xmath0cdm case , the probability density @xmath40 is almost uniform . for the case of the constant coupling ,",
    "the larger the coupling constant @xmath43 is , the more severely the probability density @xmath40 seems to deviate from the uniform distribution . nevertheless , even for the extreme case of exp003 ( with @xmath44 ) the degree of the deviation of @xmath40 from the uniform distribution is not so high as in the sugra003 model which exhibits the highest degree of the deviation .    to estimate the statistical significance of the alignment signals detected for the cde model cases , we perform the bootstrap error analysis . figure [ fig : boot_err ] plots the same as figure [ fig : cost_dis ] but in the separate panels , showing the bootstrap errors , @xmath45 , calculated as one standard deviation of @xmath34 among the @xmath46 bootstrap resamples . in each panel",
    "the horizontal dotted line corresponds to the uniform probability density for the case of no alignment . as can be seen , for the @xmath0cdm case , @xmath40 is almost perfectly consistent with the uniform distribution . for the sugra003 case ,",
    "the alignment signal is as significant as @xmath47 in the first and the fifth bin . for the other cde model cases ,",
    "the alignment signal is not so significant as the sugra003 case .    to test the null hypothesis of @xmath41",
    ", we also calculate @xmath48 with @xmath49 degree of freedom as : @xmath50^{2}}{\\sigma^{2}_{\\rm boot } } , \\label{eqn : chi2}\\ ] ] where @xmath51 is the number of the @xmath34-bin and @xmath52 represents the value of the probability density distribution at the @xmath53-th @xmath34 bin .",
    "figure [ fig : chi2 ] plots the values of @xmath48 versus the models .",
    "the horizontal dotted line corresponds to the value of @xmath48 with which the null hypothesis is rejected at the @xmath54 confidence level @xcite .",
    "it is found that for the sugra003 model the null hypothesis of no spin alignment in the galaxy pairs is rejected at the @xmath1 confidence level .",
    "now , we would like to investigate if there is any dependence of the spin alignment signal on the mass @xmath55 .",
    "this issue may be important to address since it has been recently reported that the degree of the shape alignments of the galaxy groups with the large - scale structures depends on the mass scale @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : sca_m ] plots @xmath34 versus @xmath56 for the six models in the separate panels .",
    "as can be seen , there exists no obvious correlation between @xmath34 and @xmath56 . to address more this issue quantitatively",
    ", we calculate the correlation coefficient , @xmath57 , of @xmath34 and @xmath56 as @xcite @xmath58^{1/2 } } , \\label{eqn : xi}\\ ] ] where the average is taken over all the selected galaxy pairs and the value of @xmath57 ranges between @xmath59 and @xmath60 . if there is a strong correlation ( anti - correlation ) between @xmath34 and @xmath56 , then @xmath57 will be close to @xmath60 ( @xmath59 ) . whereas , if there is no correlation between the two quantities , @xmath57 will be zero .",
    "the weaker the correlation between @xmath34 and @xmath56 is , the closer to zero the value of @xmath57 becomes .",
    "figure [ fig : xi ] plots @xmath57 versus the models . as can be seen , for each model",
    "the value of @xmath57 is less then @xmath61 , which clearly demonstrates that the spin alignment signal in a isolated galaxy pair hardly depends on its total mass .",
    "similarly , we examine if there is any correlation between @xmath34 and the separation distance between the pair galaxies , @xmath32 .",
    "the values of the correlation coefficient , @xmath62 , are calculated through substituting @xmath32 for @xmath55 in equation ( [ eqn : xi ] ) for the six models , the results of which are plotted in figure [ fig : xi_r ] . as can be seen ,",
    "the value of @xmath57 is very close to zero , confirming that there is basically no correlation between @xmath34 and @xmath32 .",
    "as mentioned in  2 , it was @xcite who have for the first time shown that no significant degree of alignment exists between the spin axes in galaxy pairs , analyzing the @xmath63 pairs of late - type galaxies in redshift range of @xmath64 $ ] identified using a spectroscopic sample from the sdss dr7 . intriguing",
    "as their result may be , their analysis definitely has some room for improvement .",
    "for example , they assumed naively that the angle between the spin axes in a galaxy pair equals the difference between the position angles , which is not necessarily true .",
    "besides , considering a relative wide redshift interval to find galaxy pairs , they measured the relative spin orientations without accounting for the fact that the spin axes of those spiral galaxies located at @xmath65 are difficult to measure accurately due to the systematics caused by the presence of bulges @xcite .    in this section , we present a more robust and thorough analysis for the measurements of the spin alignments in pairs of the sdss late - type galaxies .",
    "first of all , we utilize the spectroscopic catalog of the sdss dr7 galaxies compiled by @xcite , in which a total of @xmath66 galaxies at @xmath67 are all classified by means of the bayesian statistics into five hubble types , \\ { e , ell , s0 , sab scd } and each of them is assigned corresponding five probabilities p(e ) , p(ell ) , p(s0 ) , p(sab ) , p(scd ) . out of this catalog ,",
    "we construct a sample for our analysis , selecting only those nearby large late - type galaxies which satisfy the conditions of @xmath68 , @xmath69 @xmath70 and p(scd)=max\\{p(e),p(ell),p(s0),p(sab),p(scd ) } where @xmath71 denotes the diameter of a given late - type galaxy @xcite .",
    "that is , we focus only on the nearby large late - type galaxies since their spin axes are relatively accurately measurable owing to their small bulges and large extended disks @xcite .",
    "taking each galaxy from the sample as a target , we find its nearest neighbor galaxy in the same sample .",
    "let @xmath72 and @xmath73 be the separation distance and redshift difference between a target and its nearest neighbor , respectively . if the nearest neighbor galaxy has no galaxy within the distance of @xmath72 other than the target galaxy and if @xmath74mpc and @xmath75 , then the target galaxy and its nearest neighbor are regarded as an isolated pair system composed of the sdss late - type galaxies .",
    "a total of @xmath76 pairs of the late - type galaxies are identified from our sample and the directions of the two spin axes in each galaxy pair is determined up to two - fold ambiguity ( accounting for both the clock - wise and counter - clock wise spinning ) with the help of the circular thin disk approximation as @xcite @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the inclination angle , @xmath79 is the position angle and @xmath80 are the right ascension and declination of each late - type disk galaxy in pair .",
    "the inclination angle of each late - type galaxy is determined as @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the axial ratio and @xmath83 is the intrinsic flatness parameter introduced by @xcite . following the bayesian approach ,",
    "the value of @xmath83 for the selected late - type galaxies are calculated as @xmath84 with @xmath85 . for a detailed description of the measurements of the minor axes of the spiral galaxies with intrinsic parameter ,",
    "see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "using the same procedure described in  3 , we derive the probability density distribution of the cosines of the angles between the two spin axes in the selected galaxy pairs .",
    "note that the two - fold ambiguity in the measurement of @xmath20 produces the four - fold ambiguity in the determination of @xmath34 .",
    "in other words , for each galaxy pair , we end up having four different values of @xmath34 .",
    "regarding the four values as different realizations of the alignment angles for each galaxy pair , we calculate the probability density distributions of @xmath40 using the @xmath86 realizations of the spin alignment .",
    "the result is plotted as square dots in figure [ fig : sdss ] .",
    "the errors are again calculated as one standard deviation scatter among @xmath46 bootstrap resamples . as can be seen , the observed probability density distribution , @xmath40 , is almost perfectly uniform , indicating no spin alignments in pairs of the late - type galaxies from sdss dr7 , which is consistent with the result of @xcite .",
    "when this observational result is taken at its face value , it is inconsistent with the sugra003 model case which yields significant signal of the spin alignments in isolated galaxy pairs .",
    "an acute reader , however , would think that the observational sample of the sdss galaxy pairs is biased toward higher masses than the numerical sample from h - codecs since the former includes only those large spiral galaxy pairs , while the numerical samples include all isolated pairs of the galaxies .",
    "yet , we have already shown in  3 that there is very little , if any , correlation between the spin alignment signal and the total halo mass in galaxy pair system .",
    "we think that although our observational sample is biased , this systematics is unlikely to contaminate severely the spin alignment signal .",
    "in other words , the result of no spin alignment from the sdss galaxy pair sample is unlikely to be due to the systematics caused by including selectively only those large spiral galaxies ( which must be biased toward large halo mass ) in the sample .",
    "there is another difference in the observational data analysis from dealing with the numerical data .",
    "the measurement of the alignment angle between the spin directions in each sdss galaxy pair unavoidably suffers from the four - fold ambiguity , which effectively adds to @xmath40 , lowering the significance of spin alignment signal . here",
    ", we would like to examine whether or not the spin alignment signal seen in the sugra003 model remains significant when the same assumption is applied to the model . reversing the signs of the radial components of the unit spin vectors of the two galaxies , we construct two new unit spin vectors per each galaxy pair .",
    "using the two unit spin vectors ( the original one and the newly constructed one through reversing the sign of the radial component of the original spin vector ) of each galaxy in pair , we calculate four times the cosines of the spin alignment angles per each galaxy pair .",
    "then , we redetermine @xmath40 , regarding the four values of @xmath34 per each galaxy pair as four different realizations .",
    "figure [ fig:4fold ] plots the newly determined probability density distribution of the cosines of the spin alignment angles ( solid line ) for the sugra003 case with the bootstrap errors and compare it with the original distribution ( dashed line ) . as can be seen , the spin alignment signal becomes weaker , as expected , while the size of the bootstrap errors shrinks .",
    "note that although the alignment signal is weaker than the original one , it is still statistically significant .",
    "we find @xmath87 even when the four - fold ambiguity is assumed , which still rejects the null hypothesis of @xmath41 at the @xmath88 confidence level .",
    "in other words , for the sugra003 case , the signal of the spin alignment in isolated galaxy pairs is so strong and robutst that its statistical significance survives the application of the four - fold ambiguity .",
    "in the linear tidal torque theory , the angular momentum of a galactic halo originates from the tidal interaction with the surrounding matter at its proto - galactic stage @xcite .",
    "the gas clouds in proto- galaxies are believed to share the same specific angular momentum with the cdm particles provided that they were well mixed with each other at the initial stage @xcite .",
    "if the galaxies kept the initial memory of the tidal influence , then the spin axes in galaxy pairs would align well with each other since both of the two spin axes are correlated with the principal axis of the same local tidal field @xcite . in reality , however , the galaxies gradually lose their initial tendency of the spin alignments during the nonlinear evolutionary processes after decoupling from the hubble flows ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "henceforth , the degree of the spin alignments in galaxy pairs would be determined by the competition between the constructive tidal influence and the destructive nonlinear effect .    in cde models the integrated effect of de - dm interaction enhance the linear perturbations in the matter ( gas+cdm ) density and velocity fields relative to the @xmath0cdm case @xcite .",
    "our original idea was that the enhanced linear density and velocity perturbations in cde models might result in augmenting the constructive effect of the initial tidal interaction , helping the galaxies keep better the initially induced spin alignments . here",
    ", we have confirmed this idea through quantitatively investigating the effect of cde on the spin alignments in isolated pairs of galactic halos identified using the publicly available data from the h - codecs for the five specific cde models : exp001 , exp002 , exp003 , exp008e3 , sugra003 as well as for the @xmath0cdm model .    for the case of the @xmath0cdm model ,",
    "no signal of the spin alignment in galaxy pairs has been found , which is consistent with the observational result obtained using the pairs of the sdss late - type galaxies ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "the highest degree of the spin alignments in isolated pairs of galactic halos has been found in the sugra003 model where the linear velocity perturbations are enhanced before @xmath89 but lowered after @xmath90 , relative to the @xmath0cdm case . here",
    "the redshift @xmath90 corresponds to the epoch when the cde bounces on the @xmath0-barrier of @xmath91 , inverting its direction of motion ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for a detailed explanation ) .",
    "given the peculiar dynamics of the sugra003 cde , the strongest spin alignments exhibited by this model can be understood as follows .",
    "the enhanced velocity perturbations before @xmath90 augment the constructive tidal effect of aligning the spin orientations in pairs , while the lowered velocity perturbations after @xmath92 diminish the destructive nonlinear effect of erasing the tidally induced alignments .",
    "in fact , bouncing cde models have recently attracted sharp attentions since several observational tensions of the @xmath0cdm model have been found to be alleviated in bouncing cde models .",
    "for instance , @xcite have shown that the bouncing cde accelerates the formation of massive clusters and increases their abundance at high redshifts without affecting their abundance at low redshifts .",
    "@xcite also showed that the pairwise speeds of the colliding clusters are significantly enhanced due to the effect of bouncing cde and thus finding a bullet - like cluster is no longer an exceptionally rare event in the sugra003 model .",
    "it is intriguing to see that our result presented in this paper might be used to rule out the sugra003 as a viable cde model .",
    "the strong signal of spin alignments in pairs of galactic halos predicted by the sugra003 model is in direct conflict with no observational signal of spin alignment in the pairs of the spiral galaxies from the sdss dr7 .",
    "what our result truly implies , however , is contingent upon how well the observed minor axes of the disks in the spiral galaxies are aligned with the directions of the angular momentum vectors of their host halos , given that what can be readily measured in observations is not the specific angular momentum of a galactic halo but only the minor axes of its luminous disk .    according to the recent hydrodynamical simulations ,",
    "the minor axes of the luminous disks are almost perfectly aligned with the angular momentum vectors of the inner halos ( where the disks are embedded ) but only weakly aligned with the angular momentum vectors of the entire halos ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in spite of these numerical counter - evidences ,",
    "this alignment issue is still inconclusive and related to the long - standing angular momentum problem that the disks of the simulated galaxies in a @xmath0cdm universe are much smaller in size than the observed disks of the spiral galaxies . in other words ,",
    "the current hydrodynamical simulations have failed in producing the extended fast rotating disks in spiral galaxies ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . without having a solution to this cosmological angular momentum problem ,",
    "it is still premature to claim that the spin axes of the luminous disks are not so strongly aligned with those of the entire halos .    as a final conclusion , since the degree of the spin alignments in isolated pairs of galactic halos",
    "is found to depend sensitively on the strength of coupling and shapes of the self - interaction potential , it can be in principle used as a unique and powerful test of cde cosmologies , provided that it is understood how well the angular momentum vectors of the galactic halos are aligned with the observable minor axes of the luminous disks .",

    "<S> we investigate the effect of coupled dark energy ( cde ) on the spin alignments in isolated pairs of galactic halos , using the publicly available data from the hydrodynamical cde simulations ( h - codecs ) which were run for various cde models such as exp001 , exp002 , exp003 ( with exponential potential and constant coupling ) , exp008e3 ( with exponential potential and exponential coupling ) and sugra003 ( with supergravity potential and negative constant coupling ) as well as for a standard @xmath0cdm cosmology ( with the wmap7 parameters ) . </S>",
    "<S> measuring the cosines of the angles between the spin axes in isolated pairs of galactic halos for each model and determining its probability density distribution , we show that for the sugra003 model with bouncing cde the null hypothesis of no spin alignment in pairs of galactic halos is rejected at @xmath1 confidence level . in contrast , the @xmath0cdm cosmology yields no significant signal of spin alignment and the other four cde models also exhibit only weak signals of spin - alignments . the strength of the spin alignment signal is found to be almost independent of the total halo mass and separation distance in galaxy pairs . </S>",
    "<S> showing also that no signal is detected from the sloan digital sky survey dr 7 , we conclude that the spin alignments in galaxy pairs is in principle a unique test of bouncing cde models . </S>"
