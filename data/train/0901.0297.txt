    "understanding active galactic nucleus ( agn)galaxy interaction and feedback is of great consequence for the study of both galaxy and agn evolution ( e.g. , silk & rees 1998 ; kauffmann et al .",
    "2003 ; hopkins et al . 2006 ) .",
    "the intense ionizing radiation , relativistic jets , and winds from the agns interact with the interstellar medium ( ism ) of their host galaxies , and may either stimulate or suppress star formation ( e.g. , sazonov , ostriker & sunyaev 2004 ) .",
    "visible signatures of direct agn - host interaction include kpc - scale regions with [ oiii ] and h@xmath4 line emission , known as the extended narrow line region ( enlr ) , which have been found in many nearby seyfert galaxies ( schmitt et al .",

    "2000 , 2003 ; bianchi et al . 2006 ; evans et al . 2006 ; kraemer , schmitt & crenshaw 2008 ) . another important link between agns and starbursts is that molecular gas accreted to the nuclear region may induce a starburst ( elmegreen 1994 ) , feed a central agn , or both .",
    "agn - related shocks may further stimulate star formation ( e.g. , scoville 1992 ; gonzlez delgado et al .",
    "1998 ; veilleux et al .  1995 ; veilleux 2001 ) .",
    "star formation in the disks and galactic winds in hot halos of spiral galaxies can be traced by the diffuse x - ray emission as well ( e.g. , tyler et al . 2004 , strickland et al .",
    "2004 ; swartz et al . 2006 ; warwick et al .",
    "ngc 1365 , the object studied in this paper , is ideal for these investigations , since it hosts an agn and also has ir emission coincident with active , intensive nuclear star formation .",

    "comparing to observations of ngc 1365 from previous generation x - ray satellites and the _ xmm_-newton observatory , the _ chandra _ images offer an unprecedented view of the innermost regions of ngc 1365 , which is critical to disentangle the different emission components .",
    "ngc 1365 was first imaged in 2002 with the back - illuminated chip of the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer spectroscopy array ( acis - s ; garmire et al .",

    "using optical point sources in the field detected in x - rays , the absolute astrometry for observation i d ( obsid ) 3554 is measured to be accurate to within @xmath18 . by comparing the positions of the bright point like x - ray sources in common between observations",

    "the light curves for 2006 observations showed no strong flares .",
    "however , a period of enhanced background was present in the last quarter of obsid 3554 , and 1.6 ks exposure of affected data was screened out . finally all seven observations were merged into a single event file after correcting the relative astrometric offsets . detailed study of the point source population is deferred to a future paper ( j. wang et al . in preparation ) , which will also use the _ xmm_-newton observations of ngc 1365 .",

    "smoothed images of the ngc 1365 region were first created without removing the point sources .",
    "this enabled us to examine the spatial distribution of the point sources with respect to the galaxy .",
    "we extracted images from the merged data in the commonly used soft band ( 0.30.65 kev ) , the medium band ( 0.651.5 kev ) , and the hard - band ( 1.57 kev ) .",
    "note that the medium band encompasses the emission from the fe - l blend .",
    "the 0.3 kev low - energy boundary is the lowest energy where acis remains well calibrated , and the high energy 7 kev cut - off is chosen to limit the contribution from the background .    to derive exposure - corrected images , exposure maps were created for individual observations and bands , then reprojected to create the combined exposure maps matching the merged data .",
    "the band - limited images were then divided by the appropriate exposure maps and adaptively smoothed .",
    "this process enhances faint extended features while preserving the high resolution of brighter features . in order to prevent large variations in the adaptive smoothing scales between the bands with different counts",

    "this ring is emphasized with an alternative set of energy bands shifted to higher energies images in figure  [ 3c_ring ] , in which the soft band ( red ) is 0.31.5 kev , the medium band ( green ) is 1.53.0 kev , and the hard band ( blue ) is 3.07.0 kev ; the same smoothing was applied as for figure  [ 3c_diff ] .",
    "the hard emission ( presumably from young supernovae remnants and x - ray binaries ) is less affected by the obscuration from the dust lane , tracing the extent of the star forming ring .",
    "note that with this energy band selection the ( broader ) soft band now has the best @xmath31 of the three bands and so the smoothing scales from this band were used to smooth the images in the other two bands .",
    "this alternate band selection is only used here in this paper .",
    "comparison with _ spitzer _",
    "data clearly relates the hard x - ray ring to the circumnuclear star - forming ring prominent in the infrared .",
    "figure  [ spitzer ] shows the _ chandra _ x - ray image of the diffuse emission ( from figure  [ truecolor ] ) in ngc 1365 ( green / blue ) , together with the mid - ir ( 8  @xmath21 m ) view of the galaxy ( red ) .",
    "figure  [ spitzer2 ] zooms in to the central 1 arcmin , which shows a composite mid - ir image of the circumnuclear ring and a composite mid - ir / uv image of the same region with an overlay of the medium - band x - ray emission .",
    "the circumnuclear ring is compact and maintains regularity close to the center .",
    "such circumnuclear star formation rings are commonly observed in strongly barred spirals and assumed to be dynamically associated with the inner lindblad resonance ( ilr)inflowing gas accumulates to form a massive star forming ring between the two inner resonances ( see lindblad 1999 ) .",
    "the inner ilr and outer ilr in ngc 1365 is @xmath32 and @xmath33 from the nucleus , respectively ( lindblad et al . 1996 ) , hence the ring is located @xmath34 outside of the inner ilr .",
    "we note a hot - spot located @xmath35 ( @xmath36 kpc ) ne of the nucleus , which shows co - spatial x - ray , uv , and mid - ir emission .",
    "ir filaments bridge the ring and this object , suggesting that it is related to the galaxy , instead of being a background object , and may be associated with the bar .",
    "the spatial correlation between the x - ray and uv emission is apparent .",
    "because of the obscuring dust lane , which is traced by its bright ir emission , a bright ridge of x - ray / uv emission with hot - spots appears coincide with the edge of the ir ring @xmath37 ( 1 kpc )",
    "n and nw of the nucleus , probably related to the discrete regions of active star formation associated with the ring .    to study the large scale diffuse emission , we followed the procedure of baldi et al .",
    "( 2006a ) to create mapped - color images with point sources removed . given the short individual exposure times , we performed point source detection in the combined exposures in the full band ( 0.37.0 kev ) .",
    "the point - like acis detections including the nucleus were then removed from the data , and the resulting holes were filled by interpolating the surrounding background emission .",
    "the same procedure to define source regions and background regions employed by baldi et al.(2006a ) was followed .",
    "the results were visually compared with the band - limited images and the smoothed images to ensure that no apparent individual point sources were missed . in the circumnuclear ring region , a few `` point '' sources detected by _ wavdetect _ appear extended .",
    "these could be either association of unresolved point sources or bright patches and knots of diffuse emission . to check whether they affect the spectral analysis of the circumnuclear ring , we created separate event files without removing these sources with uncertain classification .",
    "these event files were used in spectral extraction and fitting described later in this paper .",
    "the images with point sources removed and holes filled in the three bands ( 0.30.65 kev ; 0.651.5 kev ; and 1.57 kev ) were adaptively smoothed , then combined to create a `` mapped - color '' image of the diffuse emission shown in figure  [ truecolor ] .",
    "the mapped color image shows complex morphology and striking substructures that have not been seen in lower resolution x - ray images previously .",
    "the overall morphology of the x - ray emission is rather consistent with the optical picture described in ",
    "[ intro ] :    1 .",
    "extended soft x - ray emission appears to resemble a bicone ( nw and se ) structure with the apex at the nucleus .",
    "the se structure is more extended ( @xmath38 measured from the nucleus ) and visually closer to a cone - shape .",
    "its inner region is brighter and appears to contain substructure .",
    "the nw cone is only bright at the base close to the nuclear region ( @xmath39 ) , with fainter emission extends towards far nw .",
    "both cones are incomplete , possibly due to obscuring material in the galaxy plane and bulge .",
    "the measured projected half opening angle of the cone in the x - ray image is approximately @xmath40 .",
    "the x - ray cones appear to be edge - brightened , which is consistent with the hollow cones seen in the optical ( lindblad 1999 ) .",
    "harder x - ray emission is associated with the circumnuclear star - forming ring , which appears pink and clumpy in the image .",
    "3 .   the hardest x - ray emission , which appears as a @xmath41-wide blue band intersecting the top portion of the circumnuclear ring , is coincident with the dust extinction lane of the galaxy .",
    "a quick examination of the spectra extracted from the diffuse emission show the presence of the oxygen+iron+neon ( o+fe+ne ) emission blend ( 0.61.16  kev ) , the magnesium ( mg)-xi ( 1.271.38  kev ) and the silicon ( si)-xiii ( 1.751.95  kev ) lines ( figure  [ spectra ] ) .",
    "to identify regions of strong apparent line emission and to select possible anomalous abundance regions for spectral analysis , we generated an emission line map , following fabbiano et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and baldi et al .",
    "( 2006a ) , to highlight regions of prominent emission lines in the hot ism .",
    "three band - limited images were created to encompass the lines noted above .",
    "a `` continuum template '' was extracted using the 1.41.65  kev and 2.053.05  kev bands which are not visibly contaminated by emission lines , and was used to determine the underlying continuum in the emission line bands .",
    "all point - like sources were removed and the holes were filled with background as described in   [ truecol ] .",
    "the o+fe+ne 0.61.16  kev band image contains the largest number of counts and so was used to set the smoothing scales for the other line and continuum images .    to determine the continuum contribution in each line image",
    ", we extracted the spectrum of the entire diffuse emission of ngc 1365 and fitted the continuum with a simple two - component thermal bremsstrahlung model , excluding the three energy ranges with strong line emission .",
    "the best fit model provides the appropriate scaling factors between the continuum level in our continuum template and the continuum in a given line band .",
    "the scaling factors are 2.5 , 0.2 , and 0.19 for the 0.61.16  kev , 1.271.38  kev , and 1.751.95  kev band , respectively .",
    "each line image was continuum subtracted after weighting the continuum image by these scaling factors , and the resulting images were combined to create a mapped - color line - strength image ( figure  [ line ] ) .",
    "figure  [ line ] shows that the emission - line structure of the hot ism in ngc 1365 is also quite complex .",
    "silicon emission ( blue ) appears most pervasive in the dust lane ; this could be due to obscuration of the softer energy photons in this region , and this possibility is explored further below .",
    "magnesium lines ( green ) and o+fe+ne emission ( red ) are prevalent in most regions .",
    "part of the nw diffuse region shows enhanced o+fe+ne emission .",
    "noticeably there is an area ( orange in color ) south of the star - forming ring that is lacking in silicon line emission .",
    "the mapped - color x - ray image ( figure  [ truecolor ] ) and the line - strength map ( figure  [ line ] ) demonstrate that the diffuse emission of the hot ism in ngc 1365 is rich in spatial and spectral features .",
    "these figures suggest structure in the hot ism , possibly the effect of varying absorption columns , plasma temperatures , and metal enrichment .    as outlined in figures  [ c_diff_reg ] and [ line ] , we identified five separate regions based on morphology and three regions based on apparent abundance pattern , to perform spectral analysis of the x - ray emission from the hot ism .",
    "the region `` ring '' refers to the circumnuclear ring , excluding the nucleus ( see   [ truecol ] and figure  [ 3c_ring ] ) .",
    "the region `` diffuse '' refers to all the diffuse emission , excluding the area inside the outer limit of the ring .",
    "it is further divided into `` inner diffuse '' ( the bright portion of the cones ) and `` outer diffuse '' ( the faint diffuse emission ) .",
    "in addition , for the ring area we also extracted photons from the `` ring '' region including the _ wavdetect _ selected point sources that appear extended ( see   [ truecol ] ) .",
    "we dubbed the region and the corresponding extraction `` ring+ '' .",
    "we did not further divide the diffuse emission into sub - regions ( e.g. , the ring is separated by the dust lane into north - ring and south - ring ) to have good statistics for the spectral fitting .",
    "regions related to the emission line features noted in figures  [ line ] were also created , with descriptive names ( `` high - si '' , `` low - si '' , and `` high - fe '' ) .",
    "we emphasize here that , even though the extended emission is referred to as `` diffuse '' , the x - ray emission is not @xmath42 diffuse plasma",
    ". there is evidence for extensive clumpiness and x - ray hot - spots .",
    "the `` diffuse '' x - rays include a mixture of hot ism and unresolved point sources ( xrb / snr ) associated with regions of very active star formation .",
    "the hard power law component seen in the spectral fit ( see   [ fitting ] ) is likely related to the xrb / snr components .",
    "we extracted spectra separately from the individual obsids , for each diffuse emission regions described above .",
    "we excluded all the point source areas above @xmath43 described in   [ truecol ] .",
    "we also extracted background counts representative of the field from three circular source - free regions ( each with a @xmath44 radius , resulting in a total area of 1.5 arcmin@xmath45 ) well outside the galaxy , but within the acis - s3 chip in all seven observations ( figure  [ om ] ) .",
    "a new ciao script @xmath46 was used to extract the region spectra for multiple observations .",
    "this script extracts the spectrum and creates area - weighted response matrix files ( rmf ) and ancillary response files ( arf ) for each region . for each region of interest ,",
    "all source spectra and background spectra were co - added and the response files were combined with their appropriate weights using the ftools software .",
    "the resulting spectra were then grouped so as to have signal to noise ratio @xmath47 in each energy bin .",
    "the extracted spectra were analyzed with xspec v12.0 ( arnaud 1996 ) , using combinations of absorbed optically - thin thermal emission and power law components to fit the data .",
    "we used the astrophysical plasma emission code ( apec ) thermal - emission model ( smith et al .",
    "2001 ) that utilizes improved atomic data from the astrophysical plasma emission database .",
    "the absorption column was modeled with @xmath48 ( wilms et al .",
    "2000 ) , which includes updated photoionization cross section and abundances of the ism , as well as a treatment of interstellar grains and the h@xmath49 molecule .",
    "we first considered absorbed single - temperature apec models as well as two - temperature apec models .",
    "a single line - of - sight absorption column was used in all cases , equivalent to galactic line - of - sight column ( @xmath50 @xmath51 ; kalberla et al .",
    "2005 ) combined with the intrinsic absorption within ngc 1365 , which was free to vary .",
    "when the fit required unmeasurably small absorption ( @xmath52 @xmath51 ) , we froze @xmath53 at the galactic column .",
    "as the spectrum of the integrated diffuse emission clearly shows prominent mgxi ( @xmath01.3 kev ) , ovii - neix / x - fe - l complex ( 0.6 - 1.2 kev ) , and sixiii ( @xmath01.8 kev ) line features , the abundances of these elements were left to vary freely . when fitting with the two component models ,",
    "the oxygen abundance was fixed at the solar value as it is poorly constrained in our data and consistent with solar abundance .",

    "the large scale diffuse emission ( `` diffuse '' ) is well fitted with a single temperature thermal model , with a well determined @xmath63 kev .",
    "the absorption may be a little in excess of the galactic column towards ngc 1365 ( @xmath64 @xmath51 ) .",
    "to adequately fit the emission lines in the acis spectrum , the data require sub - solar abundances ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "the sub - regions of the diffuse emission show similar characteristics to the combined emission .",

    "the x - ray luminosity of the central nucleus is estimated to be @xmath171 ergs s@xmath77 ( 0.58.0 kev ) , and x - ray photoionization is considered unimportant .",
    "the extended soft x - ray emission , similar to what we see in ngc 1365 , is interpreted as gas outflow from the star - forming ring out of the galactic plane .",
    "a multiwavelength study of the circumnuclear extended emission in seyfert 2 galaxy ngc 2110 ( evans et al .",
    "2006 ) suggested that shock - heated multiphase gas can account for the observations , although photoionized gas by the nucleus can not be ruled out .",
    "in contrast , in another nearby agn - starburst galaxy ngc 6764 , croston et al .",
    "( 2008 ) detected extended , @xmath172 kev x - ray emission coincident with the radio bubbles , likely inflated by the agn ( hota & saikia 2006 ) .",
    "they rule out a galactic wind as the origin of the x - ray emission and instead favor hot gas heated by jet / ism interaction in the agn outflow , similar to the radio lobes in radio galaxies ( e.g. , centaurus a , kraft et al . 2003 ) .",
    "this is quite a different situation from ngc 1365 , which shows a weak radio nucleus and jet , and no radio bubble ( sandqvist et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "comparison of ngc 1365 to these starburst and seyfert 2 galaxies suggests that , in galaxies where the agn is not the dominant energetic factor in the circumnuclear environment ( i.e. , where a starburst plays major role ) , the extended soft x - ray emission shows a thermal origin as sne and massive stars drive outflow into the disk and halo ( galactic winds , see heckman et al .",
    "1990 , strickland et al .",
    "if instead the energetics of nuclear radiation suffice , circumnuclear x - ray emission may be solely attributed to agn photoionization ( e.g. , ogle et al .",
    "2003 , bianchi et al .",
    "when a powerful agn jet / outflow is seen as evidenced by large scale radio bubbles , the interaction with the ism may heat the entrained gas and account for the x - ray emission ( e.g. , kraft et al .",
    "2003 , croston et al .",
    "these galaxy feedback processes are critical in our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution , which can be best studied when high resolution radio , x - ray , and optical nlr data are combined ( e.g. , evans et al .",
    "2006 ; bianchi et al .",
    "we have presented a detailed _ chandra_/acis imaging study of the nearby seyfert galaxy ngc 1365 . based on the high resolution 100 ks images , we confirm results from previous x - ray studies and present new findings in the complex circumnuclear region .",
    "we have created an x - ray broad band color image as well as narrow band line - emission image , showing a biconical soft x - ray emission region extending from the nucleus , coincident with the high excitation outflow cones seen in [ oiii]/h@xmath4 emission line images .",
    "a prominent kpc - scale circumnuclear star - forming ring is seen emitting harder x - rays .",
    "the spectral fitting on the spatially separated components indicates thermal plasma origin for the x - ray emission in the ionization cones , which is also supported by the spatial anti - correlation between x - ray emission and the [ oiii ] emission .",
    "the abundance ratios for regions of ngc 1365 are fully consistent with the theoretical values for enrichment from type ii sne .",
    "x - ray morphology of ngc 1365 is compared with _ spitzer _",
    "mid - ir images and [ oiii ] emission line observations .",
    "we argue that pure photoionization by agn can not account for the extended soft x - ray emission based on the spectral fit , energetic estimate , and morphology evidences .",
    "we attribute the observed soft x - rays to thermal emission from shock heated hot gas , although we can not rule out a photoionized contribution in the line emission .",
    "x - ray emission from a previously reported nuclear radio jet is detected .",
    "further progress will require deeper _ chandra _ images of ngc 1365 , which we plan to obtain in the future to enable studies of the morphology and spectral properties in greater details ( similar to baldi et al .",
    "2006a , b ) , with better statistics and constraints .",
    "isolation of discrete sources in the deep images will allow removal of contribution from the xrb population to the diffuse emission .",
    "this enables investigations to distinguish the nature of x - ray hot - spots from the truly diffuse emission they embedded in , and studies of the x - ray luminosity function of xrbs in ngc 1365 .",
    "spatial complexity of the x - ray emission can be overcome by dividing the circumnuclear ring and diffuse cones to smaller regions .",
    "this will also localize any abundance anomalies . with more counts in the diffuse emission , we will be able to perform spectral modeling on the radial gradient with different models and search for variation in the x - ray structure and spectra .",
    "expecting that a photoionized wind will have constant ionization parameter , and that a thermal wind will cool radially , we plan to use this diagnostic to unambiguously test the photoionized wind model and thermal wind model for the origin of x - ray emission associated with the enlr in ngc 1365 .",
    "radially constant ionization parameters have been found in a sample of type 2 seyferts ( bianchi et al .",
    "2006 ) , suggesting that at least in some cases , soft x - ray and optical nlr come from a single photoionized medium .",
    "deeper x - ray imaging will also clarify the nature of the jet - like feature .",
    "we thank an anonymous referee for helpful comments that improved the clarity of the manuscript .",
    "we are grateful to s. veilleux for providing us the [ oiii ] images in veilleux et al .",
