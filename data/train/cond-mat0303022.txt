    "starting with the discovery of superconductivity at 39k in mgb@xmath3 @xcite , there has been hectic activity both theoretical and experimental to unravel the origin of superconductivity in this system .",
    "the reduced isotope effect@xcite and the negative pressure coefficient@xcite of t@xmath0 seems to indicate that mgb@xmath3 falls in the category of conventional electron - phonon coupled superconductors with a large electron phonon coupling constant@xcite .",
    "detailed band structure calculations performed on the system suggest that the fermi surface consists of two cylinders arising from hole - like @xmath5 bonding bands and one electron like and another hole like 3-dimensional tubular network arising from the bonding and the antibonding @xmath6 bands.@xcite the phonon density of states has also been calculated for the system from which it is now clear that the e@xmath7 phonon couples non- linearly with holes in the @xmath5 band and that it is also anharmonic.@xcite the presence of both @xmath5 and @xmath6 bands at the fermi surface and their different couplings with the phonons result in a k - dependent superconducting gap@xcite hitherto not observed in earlier superconductors .",
    "an effective two gap superconductivity seems sufficient to describe the anomalous specific heat and tunneling data in mgb@xmath3.@xcite evidence for multigap superconductivity is now accruing from scanning tunneling microscopy , raman scattering and point contact spectroscopy.@xcite    various chemical substitutions have been carried out primarily to increase t@xmath0 and to verify several of the early theoretical predictions .",
    "the substituents at mg site that have been examined are al,@xcite si,@xcite alkali metals,@xcite 3d transition metals@xcite and 4d transition metals.@xcite these substitutions have almost always resulted in a decrease in t@xmath0 , irrespective of whether the substituent is an electron dopant or a hole dopant , with the exception of zn substitution in which an increase in t@xmath8 of @xmath90.2k was observed .",
    "this increase was found to correlate with an expansion of the lattice.@xcite a similar correlation of the volume expansion with a t@xmath0 increase was also observed in our previous study on 4d- transition metal substitution in mgb@xmath3 where a small ( @xmath90.5k ) increase in t@xmath0 was observed for 5% nb substitution in mgb@xmath3.@xcite one of the systems studied in detail has been mg@xmath10al@xmath11b@xmath3@xcite in which t@xmath0 shows a monotonic decrease with substitution in the x=0.0 to x=0.3 composition range , there is an abrupt decrease in t@xmath0 at x=0.33 , beyond which again a monotonic decrease in t@xmath0 is observed@xcite .",
    "there is also an associated compression along the c - axis and along the a - axis resulting in a net decrease in the cell volume .",
    "thermopower studies in this series showed that the charge carriers are holes and the decrease in t@xmath0 correlates with the decrease in the hole density of states at the fermi level@xcite as a result of electron doping in the system .",
    "band structure calculations carried out in al substituted mgb@xmath3 indicates a decrease in the area of the cylindrical part of the fermi surface with substitution , which also correlates rather well with the decrease in t@xmath0 with al substitution.@xcite be substitution in mgb@xmath12be@xmath11 , results in a decrease in a- lattice parameter and in an increase in c- lattice parameter resulting in a net increase in volume , and phase stability in this system was observed upto x=0.6 .",
    "thermopower measurements showed an increase in hole concentration with be substitution .",
    "thus in the be substituted samples despite an increase in cell volume and an increase in the hole concentration , t@xmath0 decreases .",
    "it is reasoned that the decrease in t@xmath0 is correlated with the decrease in a lattice parameter which leads to a depletion of charge at the b site , causing an increase in phonon frequency and decrease in electron phonon coupling.@xcite carbon substitution at b site,@xcite reported by different groups showed a decrease in t@xmath0 and cell volume with increase in c content .",
    "the decrease in t@xmath0 is attributed to a decrease in hole density of states at the fermi level due to electron doping .",
    "the small differences in the extent of decrease in t@xmath0 among the various reports arise on account of the differences of c solubility into the mgb@xmath3 lattice .",
    "this variation in solubility has been attributed to the form of c employed in the synthesis and the method of sample preparation .",
    "we have reported@xcite a c solubility upto x=0.30 in mgb@xmath12c@xmath11 and a decrease in t@xmath0 of upto @xmath926k in these samples , made using a home built 50 bar pressure lock - in set - up .",
    "the decrease in t@xmath0 with c concentration matches with that observed for al substitution , possibly indicating that the additional electrons due to c / al substitution fill the mgb@xmath3 bands in a rigid band manner . from the substitution studies ,",
    "discussed above , it is clear that electron doping results in a decrease in t@xmath0 , and an increase in t@xmath0 due to hole doping has not been observed .",
    "calculations@xcite predicted an increase in t@xmath0 by complete substitution of mg by cu and partial c substitution of b in the mgb@xmath3 lattice .",
    "the rationale behind the prediction was that c substitution for b would result in an increase in stiffness of b - c bond and hence the electron - phonon coupling strength .",
    "since c substitution results in electron doping , known to deplete t@xmath0 , it was thought that substitution of cu for mg would provide the compensating holes in the system .",
    "search along similar lines led to the prediction of hole doped libc to be a high temperature superconductor,@xcite in which the presence of the b - c network results in a large electron - phonon interaction .",
    "early band structure calculations@xcite also point out that the hole dos in mgb@xmath3 is 2-dimensional in character and that an increase in the hole concentration may not result in an increase in t@xmath0 .",
    "it was shown that hole dos is flat below e@xmath13 , i.e : , will remain constant with hole doping but falls off slowly with a small increase in electron doping and rather precipitously beyond 0.2 electron addition per formula unit . in our earlier study on c",
    "doped mgb@xmath3 , we indeed did see a large decrease in t@xmath0 with large electron dopings , which could be attributed to a precipitous decrease in the hole dos . in an attempt to check the hole dos picture",
    "further , we started out on the synthesis of samples with differing hole concentration levels by suitable li and cu substitution and have examined the variation in t@xmath0 in them with electron addition by c substitution .",
    "the two initial hole dopings we started out with were 20% li substituted and 5% cu substituted mgb@xmath3 .",
    "these compositions were arrived at based on the determination of individual solubilities of cu and li in mgb@xmath3 by systematic chemical substitution studies of cu and li respectively .",
    "the different series of samples that are examined in this work are , li and cu substitution at mg site to study the effect of holes viz . , mg@xmath10li@xmath11b@xmath3 and mg@xmath10cu@xmath11b@xmath3 and electron doping by c substitution at b site along with hole doping of 20%li and 5%cu at the mg site , viz . ,",
    "mg@xmath14li@xmath15b@xmath12c@xmath11 and mg@xmath16cu@xmath17b@xmath12c@xmath11 .",
    "the experimental techniques employed in this study are ac susceptibility measurement for determining t@xmath0 and resistivity measurement from 300k to 4.2k , to determine t@xmath0 and normal state transport .",
    "the superconducting transition temperatures are extracted from the onset of the diamagnetic signal and from the zero resistance .",
    "the temperature dependent normal state resistivity is fitted to the bloch- gruneisen formula to extract the debye temperature @xmath4 and residual resistivity @xmath1 . using this @xmath4 and the measured t@xmath0 in the mcmillan equation ,",
    "the electron - phonon coupling @xmath18 is extracted .",
    "the slope of the linear part of the resistivity curve in the 200k-300k temperature range has also been determined in each of the samples , in order to quantify the magnitude of the temperature dependence of resistivity .",
    "the various measured parameters on these samples have been compared with that in mgb@xmath12c@xmath11.@xcite the paper is organized as follows . in section.2",
    "the experimental details are mentioned . in section.3",
    "we present the various results along with the corresponding discussions in different subsections .",

    "weight loss was consistently recorded to be less than 1% indicating that the nominal composition is preserved even after the heat treatment in all the samples .",
    "samples so obtained were of @xmath930% theoretical density and suitable for resistivity measurements by appropriate slicing .",
    "however some samples that were not compacted properly , resulted in porous powders , in which resistivity contacts could not be achieved .",
    "the samples were characterized by powder x - ray diffraction in a stoe diffractometer using cu - k@xmath20 radiation in the bragg - brentano geometry .",
    "susceptibility measurements were done by tracing the diamagnetic signal using an ac mutual inductance technique at a measuring frequency of 941 hz for which 25 mg of finely powdered samples were used .",
    "the resistance measurements were done on @xmath91 mm thick sliced pieces in the standard four probe geometry using , 42 swg cu leads with silver paint as contact glue .",
    "the resistivity in each sample was measured in the van der pauw geometry at room temperature , using which resistivity values at all the temperatures could be determined . for both susceptibility and resistivity measurements , the temperature variation from 300k to 4.2k",
    "was obtained by using a dipstick setup in the which the temperature was measured using a si - diode thermometer with an excitation current of 10@xmath21a and the data was collected through a pc , interfaced by ieee 488 card .",
    "from the phase purity analysis of the xrd data it is clear that the li solubility in mgb@xmath3 is at least 20% ( x=0.2 ) , while that of cu is only 5% ( x=0.05 ) .",

    "it can be seen from the figure that c parameter remains more or less unchanged with substitution in all the series studied . for cationic substitutions ,",
    "the a parameter also remains constant , resulting in no change in volume for samples that are substituted only at the mg site .",
    "the lack of change in the lattice parameters with li substitution in fig .",
    "1 is at variance with earlier studies@xcite where a substantial decrease in a parameter was observed with li substitution . from fig .",

    "the lattice constant remaining unchanged in the li substituted samples can be rationalized based on the fact that the ionic radii of li@xmath22 of mg@xmath23 are not very different .",
    "the lack of change due to cu substitution can be reconciled with , from the fact that cu is soluble only to 5% and a difference in the ionic radii may not reflect as a measurable change in lattice constant .",
    "the decrease in the a - parameter with c content can result due to the smaller covalent radius of c in comparison with that of b. the smaller decrease in the a - parameter with c substitution in the li and cu substituted samples is surprising .",

    "( 5 ) that if the @xmath5 band i.e ; if the first term in eq . ( 5 ) dominates , the temperature dependence of conductivity will be large , since this band is known to couple strongly with phonons in mgb@xmath3 .",
    "on the other hand if the @xmath6 band dominates conduction , the temperature dependence of conductivity will be small as the @xmath6 band couples less effectively with phonons in this system .",
    "the reduced d@xmath2/dt in the cation substituted samples(cf .",

    "the domination of the @xmath5 band in the carbon substituted samples ( mgb@xmath12c@xmath11 and mg@xmath14li@xmath15b@xmath12c@xmath11 ) would be possible if either the plasma frequency for that band is large or if the @xmath41 is large in eq.5 .",
    "since it has been inferred from band structure calculations that the @xmath42@xcite is small in mgb@xmath3 , it appears that @xmath41 is large in the c substituted samples .",
    "this increase in the @xmath43 scattering , could arise due to the presence of disorder along the c - axis as a result of the proximity of the p@xmath31 electrons of carbon to this region .",

    "however the larger contribution to conductivity from the @xmath6 band ( term2 eq.5 ) , observed in the cation substituted samples ( cf .",

    "<S> dc resistivity and ac susceptibility measurements were employed to extract the above parameters . </S>",
    "<S> t@xmath0 versus the electron count ( estimated from simple chemical valence count arguments ) shows a universal behaviour , with t@xmath0 being constant at the mgb@xmath3 value for electron counts lower than in mgb@xmath3 but rapidly decreasing for larger electron counts . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature dependence of resistivity in the normal state fits to the bloch- gruneisen formula , from which the debye temperature , @xmath4 , and the @xmath1 are extracted . @xmath4 </S>",
    "<S> variation with t@xmath0 is not systematic , whereas @xmath1 versus t@xmath0 shows a systematic variation that depends on the type of the chemical substituent . </S>",
    "<S> this dependence has a signature of the nature of the intraband / interband scattering affected by the chemical substitutions . </S>",
    "<S> d@xmath2/dt increases with c substitution , but decreases with li and cu substitution , implying that c substitution leads to the domination of conductivity by the @xmath5 band , while in the li / cu substituted samples the @xmath6 band dominates conduction . </S>"
