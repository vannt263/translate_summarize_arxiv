    "the ages of bulges ( also commonly referred to as spheroids ) remain an important unsolved problem in stellar populations and galaxy formation ( wyse , gilmore , & franx 1997 ) .",
    "the three current and contending paradigms are early , rapid single - collapse formation of bulges and ellipticals at redshifts @xmath5 ; formation at later epochs via merging of disk galaxies ; and the formation of bulges through secular evolution processes in disks ( see review by kormendy & kennicutt 2004 ) . in general , distant cluster galaxies show consistent results from different studies , namely a tight color - magnitude relation for e - s0 and very red colors that persist to redshifts @xmath3 ( see , e.g. , van dokkum 2000 , blakeslee 2003 , menanteau 2004 ) . both support the early bulge formation scenario . in contrast ,",
    "field e - s0 and bulges show inconsistent and inconclusive results .",
    "for example , using the luminosity function as a test between the two scenarios , lilly ( 1996 ) find little luminosity or density evolution for red galaxies ; i m ( 2002 [ gss10 ] ) see significant luminosity evolution and little volume density evolution of morphologically selected e - s0 to @xmath6 ; and bell ( 2004 ) find luminosity and density evolution of red galaxies ( presumed to be dominated by e - s0 galaxies ) that maintain a constant luminosity density with lookback time to @xmath7 ( see recent review by mccarthy 2004 ) .",
    "perhaps the picture is mixed for galaxies with different masses , as suggested by fundamental plane studies at these redshifts showing less massive galaxies appearing to be younger ( e.g. , treu 2005 ) . using colors as a surrogate for estimated ages , some studies support the merger picture by finding or claiming a large fraction ( 30% to 50% ) of field bulges and/or early - type galaxies at intermediate redshifts to be blue or to show evidence of recent star formation ( e.g. , kodama , bower , & bell 1999 ; abraham 1999 ; schade 1999 ; tamura 2000 ; menanteau 2001 & 2004 ; ellis , abraham , & dickinson 2001 ) , while a few other surveys find uniformly red e - s0 ( gss10 ) or bulges ( koo 2005 [ gss8 ] ) at the same epochs .    as shown by menanteau ( 2001 , 2004 ) ,",
    "the properties of field bulges versus cluster bulges provide powerful diagnostics of formation mechanisms .",
    "they found , contrary to expectations of hierarchical formation models , that the bulges of field spirals appeared bluer on average than field ellipticals ( c.f .",
    ", gss8 where both are found to be the same ) . using cluster ellipticals as a benchmark for old stellar populations , menanteau ( 2001 ) estimated that `` at @xmath3 about half the field spheroidals must be undergoing recent episodes of star formation . ''",
    "moreover , as emphasized by the work of benson ( 2002 ) , the resolved colors of spheroids are particularly effective probes of their formation history .    based on decomposing galaxies into bulge - like and disk - like components , figure 5 in gss8",
    "shows that the luminous field pbulges are _ redder _ and have a _ shallower _ color - magnitude relation ( cmr ) slope than that derived from _",
    "integrated colors _ of early - type _ galaxies _ in the ms1054 cluster . without removing the contamination by potentially bluer disks",
    ", we do not yet know whether cluster _",
    "bulges _ are indeed bluer than field or have a steeper cmr slope",
    ". moreover , the bulge colors of the cluster spirals , i.e. , non - early - type , have yet to be measured .",
    "photometry that separates bulges from disks of cluster galaxies is clearly needed .",
    "this letter presents the results of such a study .",
    "we adopt a hubble constant h@xmath8 = 70  mpc@xmath9 and a flat cosmology with @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "our photometry is in the vega system with @xmath12 referring to @xmath13 and @xmath14 to @xmath15 for the wfpc2 data from @xmath0 . at redshift @xmath16",
    ", @xmath17 is very close to restframe @xmath18 and @xmath14 is close to restframe @xmath19 , thus making any k - corrections to these measures very small .",
    "observed colors of @xmath20 are close to restframe @xmath21 and , for such very red stellar populations , @xmath22 is equivalent to blue absolute magnitudes of @xmath23 .",
    "cluster ms1054 - 03 at redshift @xmath24 was chosen for analysis since it is among the best observed distant clusters .",
    "the cluster has relatively deep ( 6600s in each of @xmath12 and @xmath14 ) and extensive ( 6 pointings of wfpc2 covering about 30 @xmath25 of the region ) @xmath0 imaging from hst program go 7372 ( see hoekstra et al .",
    "2000 , van dokkum et al .",
    "it also possesses over 100 spectroscopic redshifts ( tran 2005 , in preparation ) .",
    "flat fielding and cosmic - ray removal of the @xmath0 images are described in detail by van dokkum ( 2001 ) who also measured colors and magnitudes via aperture photometry for 81 galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts ( van dokkum 2000 ) .    since",
    "our goal is to isolate the bulge component , the reduced @xmath26 and @xmath14 images were analyzed with our own photometry package ( gim2d : see simard 2002[gss2 ] and gss8 for details ) to separate the luminosities and colors of the bulges and disks .",
    "gim2d fits each object in an image with a psf - convolved 2d two - component ( bulge+disk ) model .",
    "the two components are 1 ) the bulge , which is assumed to follow an @xmath27 profile ( de vaucouleurs profile ) that characterizes many luminous ellipticals and bulges ( andredakis , peletier , & balcells 1995 ) , but this is a simplification ( see de jong 2004 for a more in - depth study of local cluster bulge profile shapes using gim2d ) , and 2 ) the disk , which is fit with an exponential profile . since we can not be sure that the components extracted from the decomposition are genuine bulges and disks , we referred to these measured components as photometrically - derived bulges and disks or photobulge and photodisk in gss8 . in this letter , we dub these as pbulge and pdisk .",
    "previous work with gim2d ( gss2 , gss8 ) have shown that reliable two - band colors for compact bulges are derived by simultaneous fits of the profile parameters and the adoption of the simplifying assumption that color gradients for either of the subcomponents are small .",
    "one image in each filter is used in gim2d .",
    "the pbulge and pdisk centers , sizes , orientation , and shapes are constrained to be the same for the two filters , while the pbulge - to - total ratio and total luminosity are left to float .",
    "undersampled wfpc2 images with sub - pixel shifts can not be re - sampled and stacked without loss of information , due to aliasing , unless a large number of images are available for stacking .",
    "given that this is not case for our data , we make use , instead , of gim2d s option of simultaneously fitting a series of non - rotated images in a single filter , each with its own set of psf s",
    ". however , we can not yet undertake simultaneous fits with multiple images in multiple filters .",
    "the cluster has 3 pairs of offset images in each of @xmath12 and @xmath14 . as a workaround to the limitations of gim2d",
    ", we first fit each object with the 3 pairs of @xmath14 images .",
    "the @xmath14 was chosen since the bulges were generally very red and thus had higher s / n in @xmath14 than in @xmath12 .",
    "except for the luminosity and pbulge - to - total ratio , all the other measured parameters from @xmath14 were locked when the @xmath12 image was fit .",
    "the conversion of the measured @xmath14 and @xmath17 to restframe @xmath28 and @xmath18 were made using the method described by weiner ( 2005 : gss3 ) and willmer ( 2005 ) , but yield values very close to that adopted by van dokkum ( 2000 ) .",
    "color conversion errors can be seen to range from 0.05 to 0.08 mag in fig .",
    "12 of gebhardt ( 2003 : gss9 ) .",
    "the field bulges were chosen from a sample of galaxies within the @xmath12 and @xmath14 @xmath0 images of the `` groth strip survey '' ( gss ) , a `` chevron strip '' of 28 wfpc2 pointings oriented ne to sw at roughly 14:17 + 52 at galactic latitude @xmath29 ( programs gto 5090 , 5109 ) covering an area of 127 arcmin@xmath30 ( vogt et al .",
    "the galaxies were constrained to have about the same redshifts as ms1054 - 03 , namely @xmath31 between 0.79 and 0.87 , where the spectroscopic redshifts were measured by _",
    "deep_. from a total sample of over 600 redshifts ( weiner 2005 ) , 76 fell within our redshift range _ and _ had hst imaging .",
    "except for one ultra - deep pointing ( 14:17.5 + 52.5 , westphal deep survey field 2 ) with 24,400s in @xmath12 and 25,200s in @xmath14 , the other hst images in gss were comprised of a combined image in @xmath14 of 4400s and in @xmath12 of 2800s . as detailed in gss2 , gim2d processing of the 2800s @xmath12 and 4400s @xmath14 were made separately and simultaneously . to match the procedure for the cluster photometry using gim2d , we adopted and locked the parameters from the 4400s @xmath14 ( except for luminosity and pb / t ratio ) and used these to process the multiple images in @xmath12 .",
    "the conversion of the input @xmath14 and resultant @xmath17 to restframe @xmath28 and @xmath18 were as mentioned above .",
    "our prior experience with gim2d ( gss8 ) suggests four additional criteria to define the final sample , with brackets enclosing the number of galaxies excluded by each criterion for the field and cluster , respectively : 1 ) [ 45,33 ] the pbulge had to be brighter than @xmath32 ( m@xmath33 -19.5 ) to yield reliable photometry ; 2 ) [ 1,2 ] the pbulge half - light sizes were larger than one third of a pixel , i.e. 0.03 arcsec , again to assure reliable photometry ; 3 ) [ 5,4 ] the pbulges had to have half - light sizes smaller than the half - light sizes of the pdisk subcomponent _ or _ the pbulges were dominant with more than 2/3 of the total luminosity , i.e. , pb / t @xmath34 0.67 ; and 4 ) [ 1,4 ] the morphology was not so distorted as to be poorly represented by our assumed two components . the third criterion was needed to reject cases where gim2d fits a central probable bulge with a small exponential component and the outer probable disk with an @xmath27 component .",
    "such structures appear to exist in nature but we chose to reject such anomalous bulges from this survey .",
    "examples of rejected galaxies based on morphology include , e.g. , a cluster galaxy that appears to be a spiral with two holes ( i d 1403 : see image in van dokkum 2000 ) and a field galaxy that appears to be a highly distorted close merger ( gss i d 073_1809 : see image in gss8 ) .",
    "another that was retained looks like a tulip with a stem ( gss i d 174_4356 : see gss8 ) and should perhaps be rejected ; it is the lone very blue outlier in fig .",
    "1 . seven other blue pbulges seen in fig . 5 of gss8 ( most are not genuine bulges or have poor fits ) lie outside the redshift range adopted here .",
    "moreover , three of the field pbulges from gss8 did not converge with our revised gim2d procedures ( gss ids : 143_2770 , 152_5050 , and 292_6262 ) .",
    "after the restrictions , the full sample of 114 ms1054 cluster members was reduced to a final sample of 71 and the full gss field sample of 76 was reduced to 21 pbulges .",
    "the color magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) of the pbulges are displayed in fig . 1 .",
    "to equalize the samples , the cluster pbulges have been segregated by their distance from the cluster center at j2000 10:56:59.93 -03:37:36.6 of galaxy 1484 in van dokkum ( 2000 ) . the virial radius or @xmath35 measured as 241@xmath36 by tran ( 1999 ) or",
    "1.83 mpc has been revised using a larger sample of 130 galaxies and is 216@xmath36 or 1.64 mpc .",
    "all the cluster galaxies in our sample lie well within r@xmath37 .",
    "the main result is clear from fig.1 : the slope , color , and dispersion of the cmds are similar among the four samples .",
    "relative to the solid line showing the median color of @xmath38 from the 71 cluster pbulges , the field pbulges appear slightly redder .",
    "we also see from fig .",
    "1 that the pbulge colors are red , independent of the distance from the cluster center ( i.e. , average density ) , pbulge to total ( pb / t ) ratio , and the color of the pdisk .",
    "we also find no support for claims or findings ( see references in introduction ) of 30% to 50% fractions of bulges or spheroidals being very blue ( @xmath4 ) in the field at this redshift or within a broader range of redshifts of 0.7 to 1.0 ( gss8 ) .",
    "finally , we find that almost all pbulges are as red or redder than pdisks in both field and cluster .    before continuing ,",
    "a few caveats and possible weaknesses of the survey are noted .",
    "the results here apply only to 1 ) bulges that are luminous ( @xmath39 ) and thus opens the possibility that lower luminosity bulges may have experienced a different formation history ; 2 ) galaxies that are dominatd by one or two components , with the bulge having an @xmath27 profile while the disk has an exponential ; 3 ) galaxies that do not have large enough color gradients in either subcomponent to change the results ; and 4 ) bulges that do not belong to obviously merging systems . our field sample with only 21 galaxies is small , so that different properties might apply to 20% minorities .    to quantify the cmd , table 1 gives the results of fits to the data shown in fig .",
    "1 , using the biweight method of @xcite .",
    "since we found no luminosity dependence of the colors , we locked the slope to 0 and measured only the colors and dispersions .",
    "we confirm what is seen by eye , namely , that the cluster and field pbulges show very similar colors , with a hint that the inner cluster pbulges may be redder than the middle or outer cluster pbulges and that field pbulges may be slightly redder than cluster pbulges on average , but none of these differences are statistically significant ( 95% confidence limit or better , i.e. , twice the rms from table 1 ) .",
    "the color dispersions are also similar .",
    "since the measured dispersions from the fits are smaller than that expected from the gim2d color measurement errors , no reliable intrinsic dispersions can be estimated , though the implication is that they must be small .",
    "we estimate intrinsic color dispersions of less than 0.05 mag based on the variation of the measured values and gss8 results .",
    "the main result is that the restframe colors , slope , and color dispersion of _ luminous _ ( @xmath40 ) cluster and field pbulges at redshift @xmath2 are nearly the same . making the simplifying assumption that colors are a surrogate for ages , we thus find that field and cluster pbulges are universally old ( @xmath41 gyr ) with no evidence that the ages of luminous pbulges are dependent on radial distance from the cluster center or whether they reside in the cluster or in the field , i.e. environment .",
    "moreover , while we do find slightly higher proportions of galaxies with large pbulge fractions ( @xmath42 ) and with red pdisks ( @xmath43 ) in cluster ms1054 than in the field , we find that the very red pbulge colors in both the field and cluster are independent of pbulge luminosity , pb / t , as well as pdisk colors .    the universally red pbulge colors with small dispersion found here can be contrasted with prior studies ( see references in introduction ) claiming that large fractions ( 30%-50% ) of distant early - type galaxies have blue colors or large internal color dispersions that suggest active or recent star formation .",
    "these other studies differ from that undertaken here , either by including the underlying disk light in the photometry of the bulge or by including lower luminosity bulges",
    ". our results also disagree with models that predict cluster bulges are older than field bulges ( e.g. , kauffmann 1996 ) or that bulge ages depend on bulge fraction ( e.g. , kauffmann 1996 ) or on cluster - centric distance ( e.g. , diaferio 2001 ) .    our findings for distant galaxies are , however , fully consistent with the conclusions of @xcite for a local sample of bulges in early - type galaxies .",
    "they derived from @xmath0 wfpc2 and nicmos images the half - light colors of bulges in groups and the field .",
    "the colors were similar to that of elliptical galaxies in the coma cluster and implied an age of 10 gyr , corresponding to redshifts @xmath44 .",
    "the color spread within an effective radius where dust extinction was negligible was also found to be equally small ( @xmath45 0.10 mag in @xmath46 , equivalent to 0.05 mag in @xmath18 ) , implying an age spread of at most 2 gyr . finally ,",
    "because the bulge ages were so similar and old , they concluded that secular evolution of disks would have difficulty in forming bulges in early - type galaxies . exponential bulges of many late - type spirals , however , appear to have colors and thus presumably ages that are correlated with their disk colors , and lending support to secular evolution scenarios for this class of bulges ( carollo 2001 ; kormendy & kennicutt 2004 ) . this work places no constraint on such bulges if they are of luminosity fainter than our limit of @xmath47 .",
    "the second key result is that the pbulge colors are very red with @xmath21 .",
    "this color lies between the @xmath48 at @xmath49 of a fit to the cmd of 409 e - s0 s from the rc3 ( schweizer & seitzer 1992 ) and the @xmath50 of 379 s0 s ( table 2 of fukugita et al 1995 ) or @xmath51 of 30 bulges in early - type spirals ( peletier & balcells 1996 ) .",
    "the rough constancy of colors over the last 7 gyr is a surprise for which we have no simple , compelling explanation _ if only single - burst stellar populations with standard imf s are considered_. since bulges should be bluer by 0.2 mag or more in @xmath18 at lookback times corresponding to redshifts @xmath24 , we expect to observe typical colors nearer @xmath52 0.20 - 0.32 , depending on the formation epoch of bulges .",
    "if , however , an old , metal - rich stellar population were to be combined with small amounts of additional star - formation ( or equally old but bluer stars of lower metallicity ) , significant changes in luminosity from passive evolution of the stellar population can be accompanied by nearly constant restframe @xmath18 colors ( gss8 , gss9 ; schiavon in preparation ; harker in preparation ) .",
    "such `` drizzling '' or `` frosting '' pictures find support ranging from detailed studies of local old stellar populations ( trager 2000 , yi 2005 ) as well as observations that distant early - type galaxies sometimes exhibit [ oii ] emission lines that may indicate small ( @xmath53yr@xmath9 or less ) , but significant amounts of star formation ( schade 1999 ; willis 2002 ; van dokkum & ellis 2003 ; gss8 ; treu 2005 ) .",
    "since cluster early - type galaxies appear `` red and dead '' , with little evidence for any residual star formation , the above explanation would not apply .",
    "if verified , the small change in cluster bulge colors favors , instead , stellar population solutions , such as a truncated imf ( broadhurst & bouwens 2000 ) .    in summary ,",
    "our key result is that distant luminous pbulges at redshift @xmath24 have unusually red colors and that such red colors appear to be independent of environment ( cluster , field , local density ) , pbulge or galaxy luminosity , pdisk color , or pbulge fraction ( pb / t ) .",
    "our experiment uses only 21 field and 71 cluster galaxies at one redshift and uses one color .",
    "this initial foray and its conclusions need to be checked by expanding the sample sizes , broadening the range of colors , and deepening the samples .",
    "the new surveys should aim to cover lower and higher redshifts for both field and cluster galaxies ; reach lower luminosity bulges especially within later - type spirals ; and achieve sufficient photometric precision to positively detect the intrinsic color dispersions .",
    "these experiments are all now possible with the new , rich , and plentiful @xmath0 acs data in the goods fields ( giavalisco et al .",
    "2004 ) , hubble ultra deep field ( udf : beckwith , in preparation ) , and many distant rich clusters ( e.g. , by the acs gto team ) . with the advent of laser guide star adaptive optics on 8 - 10 m class telescopes , stellar population studies of small bulges may now also be extended into the near - infrared ( thus gaining better discrimination among age , metallicity , and extinction ) with the same spatial resolution of 0.05 arcsec as with @xmath0 in the optical ( e.g. , melbourne 2005 ) .",
