    "in the past four years , the main theoretical difficulty in understanding iron - based high temperature superconductors@xcite stems from the fact that the materials are intrinsic multi - orbital systems due to the presence of all five 3d - orbitals of iron atoms .",
    "several initial attempts to construct simplified models with fewer orbitals was made in an early stage of the research@xcite . while these models could successfully explain some properties , they all had serious drawbacks , which resulted in a belief that any microscopic model composed of less than all five @xmath2-orbitals is insufficient@xcite .",
    "recently , very surprisingly , with a proper consideration of the s@xmath3 symmetry , the symmetry of the building block  the feas or fese trilayer , we demonstrate that an effective two - orbital model is sufficient to capture the kinematics responsible for low energy physics @xcite .",
    "the two orbital model includes two nearly degenerate and weakly coupled single - orbital parts that can be mapped to each other under the @xmath0 transformation . not only has the model greatly simplified kinematics which essentially can be described by only three important tight - binding hopping parameters , but the model also has manifested a clear physical picture to explore many intriguing fundamental properties of the materials and has drawn a deep connection to the other high temperature superconductors , cuprates . in this paper",
    ", we give a quick review of the model by emphasizing its unique aspects and summarizing recent numerical and analytic results@xcite .",
    "before proceeding to the s@xmath3 model , we discuss several main initial motivations which lead to the construction of the model .",
    "the motivations stem from a few intriguing questions related to iron - based superconductors .    *",
    "_ what is the relation between iron - based superconductors and cuprates ? _ this question has undoubtedly been asked by many researchers since iron - pnictides were discovered . in the past several years",
    ", it has been shown that the two classes of materials share many similar properties , including similar layered lattice structures , phase diagrams , strong antiferromagnetism in parental compounds , short superconducting coherent lengths and so on . however , it is still highly controversial that whether iron - based superconductors allow us to finally apply the induction method for high temperature superconductors . * _ how can the two different families of iron - based superconductors , iron - pnictides and iron chalcogenides , be unified ?",
    "_ iron - based superconductors include two families , iron - pnictides@xcite and iron - chalcogenides@xcite .",
    "they share many intriguing common properties .",
    "they both have the highest @xmath1s around 50k@xcite .",
    "the superconducting gaps are close to isotropic around fermi surfaces@xcite and the ratio between the gap and @xmath1 , @xmath4 , are much larger than the bcs ratio , 3.52 , in both families",
    ". however , the electronic structures in the two families , in particular , the fermi surface topologies , are quite different in the materials reaching the highest @xmath1 .",
    "the hole pockets are absent in iron - chalcogenides but present in iron - pnictides@xcite .",
    "the presence of the hole pockets has been a necessity for superconductivity in the majority of studies and models which deeply depend on the properties of fermi surfaces@xcite .",
    "therefore , the absence of the hole pockets in iron - chalcogenides causes a strong debate over whether both families belong to the same category that shares a common superconducting mechanism . * _ why and how can a s - wave pairing state be stabilized if the superconductivity is originated from a repulsive interaction ? _ with a d - wave pairing symmetry , such as in cuprates , the positive and negative signs of the superconducting order parameter are equally distributed in both real and reciprocal space .",
    "therefore , one can argue that the onsite repulsive interaction is naturally avoided in a d - wave pairing state . for a s - wave pairing symmetry , even in a sign changed @xmath5 state@xcite , the argument can not be held in general . while many of us use repulsive interactions to obtain a s - wave pairing or @xmath5 , in iron - pnictides , this fundamental problem is largely unaddressed theoretically . *",
    "_ why is the superconductivity so robust and how can a single energy scale dominate in pairing gap functions in iron - based superconductors ? _",
    "observed by angle - resolved photoemission microscopy ( arpes ) , a very intriguing property in the sc states of iron - pnictides is that the sc gaps around optimal doping on different fermi surfaces are nearly proportional to a simple form factor @xmath6 in reciprocal space .",
    "this form factor has been observed in both @xmath7@xcite and @xmath8@xcite families of iron - pnictides . just like the @xmath2-wave form factor @xmath9 in cuprates",
    ", such a form factor indicates that the pairing between two next nearest neighbour ( nnn ) iron sites in real space dominates . in a multi - orbital model",
    ", many theoretical calculations based on weak coupling approaches have shown that the gap functions are very sensitive to detailed band structures and vary significantly when the doping changes@xcite .",
    "the robustness of the form factor has been argued to favor strong coupling approaches which emphasize electron - electron correlation or the effective next nearest neighbour ( nnn ) antiferromagnetic ( af ) exchange coupling @xmath10@xcite as a primary source of the pairing force .",
    "however , realistically , it is very difficult to imagine there is a single energy scale in local exchange interactions if a multi @xmath2-orbital model is considered .    in order to answer the above questions",
    ", it is clear that we have to identify microscopic parameters that control the essential physics of iron - based superconductors at low energy .",
    "the idea to address the robustness of possible s - wave pairing in iron - based superconductors stems from a paper by berg , scalapino and kivelson@xcite , where they showed that the s - wave pairing in a two leg - ladder model for iron - pnictides is equivalent to a d - wave pairing in a similar model of cuprates . the s - wave and",
    "the d - wave can be mapped by a simple gauge transformation .",
    "although their idea was carried out in an one - dimensional model , they raised an indispensable general point for any dimensional model , that is ,",
    "_ the pairing symmetry and kinematics must be considered together_. in particular , in a system where the short range pairing dominates , the phases or the signs of superconducting order parameters can be exchanged with those of the local hopping parameters .",
    "a gauge mapping can be generally described as follows .",
    "given a general hamiltonian including a kinetic energy @xmath11 and an interaction energy @xmath12 , we can perform a gauge mapping that changes the sign of local fermionic operators , namely , @xmath13 where @xmath14 or @xmath15 .",
    "it is clear that such a general gauge mapping can be described by an unitary operator @xmath16 . under the mapping",
    ", the hopping terms in @xmath11 can change the sign so that the kinetic energy hamiltonian is changed .",
    "however , the eigenvalues of @xmath11 are not changed since it is an unitary transformation .",
    "it is also easy to see that the interaction hamiltonian @xmath12 , if it includes standard interaction terms , such as local density interaction , spin exchange interaction and so on , in general , is not changed under the gauge transformation .",
    "therefore , under the mapping , @xmath17 if the original hamiltonian @xmath18 has a superconducting ground state with an superconducting order parameter @xmath19 , the ground state of the new hamiltonian @xmath20 must have @xmath21 .",
    "therefore , if the pairing is rather local short range , it is possible to change order parameter symmetry by choosing a proper gauge mapping .",
    "let s use cuprates as an example to illustrate the point . for cuprates ,",
    "the kinetic energy @xmath11 is dominated by the nearest neighbour(nn ) hopping in a square lattice , namely , @xmath22 where @xmath23 represents the links between two nn sites , and the order parameter of the d - wave pairing symmetry in real space is also dominated by coupling two nn sites which is corresponding to the d - wave gap form @xmath9 in reciprocal space , namely , @xmath24 where @xmath25 are lattice unit vectors along x and y directions respectively . as shown in fig.[cuprates ] , if we set a gauge mapping as @xmath26 where @xmath27 labels the coordinate along the x direction of the ith site .",
    "after the mapping , we have @xmath28 and @xmath29 therefore , the gauge mapping allows us to exchange the symmetries between the hopping parameters and the superconducting pairing order parameters . before the gauge mapping",
    ", the hopping has a s - wave symmetry and the pairing has a d - wave symmetry .",
    "after the gauge mapping , the hopping has a d - wave symmetry and the pairing has a s - wave symmetry .",
    "it is also important to notice that the fermi surface topology is changed after the gauge mapping as shown in fig.[cuprates ] . in a weak coupling approach",
    ", the fermi surface topology has been the key ingredient to determine many properties , such as pairing symmetry . if the pairing is driven by repulsive interaction or antiferromagnetic fluctuations , the fermi surface topology before the gauge mapping favors a d - wave symmetry while one can argue that the fermi surface topology after the gauge mapping favors a s - wave symmetry .",
    "therefore , the result obtained from a simple fermi surface topology analysis is actually consistent with the gauge mapping result .",
    "we will revisit this point for iron - based superconductors in the following subsection .",
    "the above analysis has been generalized to iron - based superconductors@xcite .",
    "a similar gauge mapping which maps a s - wave to a d - wave pairing symmetry can be designed as shown in fig.[iron - mappinga]@xmath30 .",
    "we group four neighbour iron sites to form a super site and change the sign of fermionic operators at the red iron sites in fig.[iron - mappinga]@xmath31 .",
    "this transformation maps the @xmath32 @xmath33-wave @xmath34 pairing symmetry in the original fe lattice to a familiar @xmath2-wave @xmath35 pairing symmetry defined in the two sublattices of the orginal lattice , where @xmath36 and @xmath37 label momentum in brillouin zones of the origin lattice and sublattice respectively .",
    "this is actually a straightforward generalization of the transformation used in the study of the one dimensional iron ladder model@xcite .",
    "following the same procedure , we can ask how the kinetic energy changes . in ref.@xcite",
    ", we have shown that all the different tight binding models constructed for iron - based superconductors , after the gauge mapping , display very striking simplicity : ( 1 ) all fermi surfaces after the gauge mapping are relocated around @xmath38 , the anti - nodal points in a standard @xmath2-wave superconducting state in the sublattice brillouin zone ; ( 2 ) the bands previously located at the different places are magically linked in the new gauge setting . in particular , the two bands that contribute to electron pockets are nearly degenerate and the bands that contribute to hole pockets are remarkably connected to the former ones .    ) sketch hopping parameters and pairing symmetries before and after the gauge mapping respectively ; ( a - h ) band structures and fermi surfaces for two models@xcite before and after the gauge mapping : ( a , e ) the fermi surfaces , ( b , f ) the band dispersion along the high symmetry lines , ( c , g ) the fermi surfaces after the gauge transformation , ( d , h ) the band dispersions along the high symmetry lines after the gauge transformation .",
    "the hopping parameters can be found in the above two references . ]",
    "the first feature seriously challenges the consistency of previous weak coupling analysis depending on the difference of fermi surface topologies for iron - pnictides and iron - chalcogenides . after the gauge mapping , based on the new fermi surface topology ,",
    "a standard weak coupling analysis would naturally favor a robust @xmath2-wave superconducting state with respect to the sublattice in the presence of repulsive interaction or nn af coupling@xcite .",
    "therefore , as shown in fig.[reverse ] , if we reversely map to the original gauge setting , the original hamiltonian must have a robust @xmath33-wave pairing symmetry .",
    "namely , based on the new fermi surface topology , both iron - pnictides and iron - chalcogenides should have @xmath33-wave pairing symmetry before the gauge mapping as long as the fermi pockets are small .",
    "the second feature is the key feature that leads us to believe that the low energy physics is controlled by a two orbital model which is characterized by two nearly degenerate bands .",
    "the emergence of the universal kinematics in different models suggest that the underlining electronic dynamics should be controlled by a much simplified set of parameters .",
    "with above observations and the following important facts in the tri - layer feas or fese structure ,    * the @xmath2-orbitals that form the bands near the fermi surfaces are strongly hybridized with the p - orbitals of as(se ) .",
    "since the @xmath39 and @xmath40 have the largest overlap with the @xmath41 and @xmath42 orbitals , it is natural for us to use @xmath39 and @xmath40 to construct the model ; * the local lattice symmetry at an iron site is @xmath43 in which @xmath0 symmetry is the key symmetry operation ; * the two as(se ) planes are separated in space along c - axis in the tri - layer structure . since there is little coupling between the @xmath44 orbitals of the two planes and the hopping integrals through the p - orbitals",
    "are expected to dominate over the direct exchange couplings between the @xmath2-orbitals themselves , the two orbital model essentially could be decoupled into two nearly degenerate one orbital models ; * the decoupling must be controlled by the @xmath0 symmetry since @xmath0 symmetry links two as(se ) planes ;    we draw a natural conclusion that the two - orbital model should be classified according to the @xmath0 symmetry and each of the two nearly degenerate one - orbital models should have a unit cell with two iron sites .     kinematics with @xmath39 and @xmath45 orbitals .",
    "the green balls represent as(se ) in the top layer and the grey balls represent those in the bottom layer .",
    "the blue and red orbitals represent the @xmath39 and @xmath40 orbitals . ]    a picture of the effective two - orbital model with the @xmath0 symmetry is illustrated in fig.[s4 ] .",
    "the two orbital model is divided into two weakly and coupled one - orbital models",
    ". the orbital degree of freedom in the two one - orbital models can be called as two components of an @xmath0 iso - spin .",
    "the first one includes the @xmath39 in the a sublattice and the @xmath40 in the b sublattice if we use @xmath46 and @xmath47 to label two sublattices , and the second one includes the @xmath39 in the b sublattice and the @xmath40 in the a sublattice .",
    "the first strongly couples to the top as(se ) layer and the second couples to the bottom as(se ) layer .",
    "we denote @xmath48 to @xmath49 to label fermionic operators of the two models that are connected by the @xmath0 transformation .",

    "the hole pockets can be suppressed by adjusting @xmath70 or @xmath71 .",

    "gaps at any two points on the fermi surface that are connected by the ordered sdw wave vector should be opened , the band structure in the c - afm state appears to be reconstructed by the development of the magnetic order .",
    "arpes experiments @xcite observe that small pockets or hot spots develop around fermi surfaces .",
    "it is fair to say that the scenario of the gap opening due to a magnetic order in a multi - orbital system , such as iron - pnictides , is complex .",

    "the magnetic order splits two folded bands while in the other direction the gap can be opened between the pair of electron and hole pocket bands .",

    "in the view of the @xmath2-wave picture after the gauge mapping , the superconducting phase for each @xmath0 iso - spin alternates between neighboring squares , which is corresponding to the sign change between the top and bottom as / se planes in the view of the @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "such an intrinsic sign change between the top and bottom as planes along c - axis explains why a s - wave before gauge mapping can be stabilized even if the repulsive interaction is responsible for superconductivity .",

    "<S> we briefly review the recently constructed two orbital microscopic model for iron - based superconductors based on @xmath0 symmetry@xcite . with this faithful representation of the kinematics of the tri - layer feas or fese structure </S>",
    "<S> , the model provides answers and physical pictures to fundamental questions related to the robustness of superconductivity and pairing symmetry , unifies different families of iron - based superconductors , casts new insight into the connections to the other high @xmath1 superconductors , cuprates , and reveals why an s - wave pairing can be stabilized by repulsive interactions . </S>",
    "<S> further progresses include that the model provides a clean understanding of band reconstruction observed in magnetically ordered states , which is a strong support to the kinematics of the @xmath0 model , and captures the essential low energy physics of iron - based superconductors based on numerical results from unbiased quantum monte carlo simulation . </S>"
