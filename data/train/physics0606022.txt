    "the current baseline configuration of the international linear collider  @xcite consists of two interaction regions ( irs ) and two detectors , with one ir having a large beam crossing angle and one having a small beam crossing angle .",
    "the large crossing angle layout has an angle of 20mrad between the beams , and is derived from the large crossing angle design of the next linear collider  @xcite .",
    "its optical properties are well understood , and the extraction line successfully transports the disrupted beam to the dump , for a wide range of proposed beam parameter sets  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the design includes downstream diagnostics for energy and polarisation measurement .",
    "the 2mrad interaction region layout presents more technical challenges , mainly resulting from transporting the outgoing disrupted beam off - axis in the final doublet .",
    "this design is more recent and the first complete optics was presented at snowmass 2005  @xcite .",
    "this layout was developed for 1 tev using nbti superconducting final doublet magnets and included downstream energy and polarimetry measurement chicanes .",
    "the current ilc parameter space is documented in  @xcite and the key parameters are listed in table  [ tabparasets ] .",
    "these consist of sets of representative beam parameters , designed to assure flexibility in case of unexpected practical limitations in achieving some of the machine goals .",
    "the most challenging of these sets is known as the high luminosity set , which aims to maximise the instantaneous luminosity by more strongly focusing the beams at the ip , thereby significantly enhancing disruption effects . a necessary criterion for the performance of",
    "the extraction line design is its ability to accommodate the broadest possible range of beam parameters .",
    "the 20mrad scheme is successful for the majority of parameter sets , but the current ( baseline ) 2mrad design shows unacceptable beam power loss , both in the final doublet and in the extraction line , for some of the beam parameters considered .    in this work ,",
    "we exploit the limits of current magnet technology as well as technology still under development to optimise the 2mrad final doublet layout .",
    "we present three new final doublet designs , one optimised for the baseline energy of 500 gev and two for the upgrade energy of 1 tev .",
    "we optimise the magnet parameters with respect to power deposition from charged beam and radiative bhabha particle losses , with the goal of accommodating all ilc beam parameter sets .",
    "we find that this is possible by using nbti technology for the 500 gev machine , and by using new nb@xmath0sn technology for the 1 tev upgrade .",
    "however , an increase in pole tip field , somewhat beyond the currently planned limits for nb@xmath0sn technology , would be required to achieve power losses small enough to avoid quenching of the final doublet magnets for the case of the low power and high luminosity beam parameters at 1 tev .",
    "we include a full set of magnet and optical parameters for evaluation by magnet designers .    in section  [ secmags ]",
    "we discuss the available magnet technologies and the constraints we place on magnet parameters .",
    "we describe our final doublet optimisation procedure in section  [ secopt ] and present the resulting magnet parameters for each case .",
    "the beam transport and resulting losses with our new doublets are presented in section  [ secpl ] , and we draw our conclusions in section  [ secconc ] .",
    "we find that the proposed new final doublet layouts have considerably better beam transport properties than the current ones .",
    ".key parameters of the beam parameter sets used in this work .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tabplnb3sn1000 ]    finally , table  [ tabplnb3sn1000 ] shows the power losses in the nb@xmath0sn final doublet , optimised for 1 tev .",
    "the higher gradients expected from using nb@xmath0sn superconductive material enable to significantly reduce the power deposition as compared to both the baseline and optimised nbti final doublet designs .",
    "however , the losses are still in excess of the quenching limits of the magnets . to understand what improvement in superconducting technology would be required",
    ", we computed how much larger the pole tip field in qd0 would need to be to bring the sum of the charged beam and radiative bhabha losses to less than 1w , for the low power beam parameter set .",
    "the result was that a pole tip field of 11 t in a magnet with an aperture of 35 mm would be needed for the low power beam parameter set to be accommodated in the final doublet at 1 tev . the feasibility of such large pole tip fields on the time - scale of the 1 tev energy upgrade of the ilc needs to be discussed with relevant superconductive magnet experts .",
    "alternatively , beam parameters at 1 tev may be optimised with somewhat lower beamstrahlung energy loss , including for total beam powers as low as in the present low power parameter set .",
    "such sets would result in significantly easier final doublet designs .",
    "in this note , we have described a detailed study of the power deposition in the final doublet of the ilc 2mrad crossing - angle layout , from both the disrupted charged beam and from the radiative bhabha events .",
    "we exploited superconductive magnet technologies both currently available and expected to be developed through on - going r&d : nbti and nb@xmath0sn with maximum pole tip fields of respectively 6.28 t and 8.8 t.    we find that using nbti technology to optimise the 500 gev baseline final doublet is adequate to obtain small enough beam power depositions in the final doublet , provided a tungsten liner is included in the design of the vacuum chamber to spread out the showers and reduce the maximum power density at the location where most losses are concentrated .",
    "this doublet now needs to be integrated into the final focus system and extraction line .",
    "when this will be done , we will propose that it become the baseline for the 2mrad at 500gev , with the assumption that it would have to be replaced at the time of the 1 tev energy upgrade . in all cases ,",
    "the sextupole lengths , strengths and apertures are not fully optimised .",
    "some more work is still needed here , in view of reducing their sizes and ease their integration with the detector .",
    "it is also necessary to include the extraction line magnets in a further optimisation .",
    "a final doublet based on nbti technology does not , on the other hand , provide small enough beam power depositions at 1 tev , for several of the beam parameter sets considered .",
    "exploiting nb@xmath0sn superconductive technology can however improve the situation considerably , as the higher expected gradients would allow significantly lower power depositions .",
    "the optimised layout shows far superior power loss behavior than the current 1 tev machine baseline final doublet , but is still in excess of the quenching limit for the beam parameter sets with the largest beamstrahlung energy loss .",
    "a 35 mm qd0 with a pole tip field of around 11 t would be needed to a avoid quenching of this magnet , in the case of the low power beam parameters .",
    "we expect further r&d in superconductive magnet technology to enable increases in maximum available pole tip field in the future , which will ease the design of the 2mrad beam crossing - angle layout .",
    "an alternative path is to constrain the optimisation of the beam parameters at 1 tev with an upper bound on the beamstrahlung energy loss .",
    "this would also be motivated since a very large beamstrahlung energy loss is undesirable for several other reasons .",
    "we would like to thank andrei seryi and deepa angal - kalinin for helpful advice and assistance , grahame blair for useful discussions and john carter for his assistance computing the effect of a tungsten liner in the vacuum chamber .",
