    "the inverse obstacle scattering problem is to image the scattering object , i.e. find its shape and location , from the knowledge of the far - field pattern of the scattered wave .",
    "the medium is illuminated by light at given direction and polarization .",
    "then , maxwell s equations are used to model the propagation of the light through the medium , see @xcite for an overview . due to the complexity of the combined system of equations for the electric and the magnetic fields , it is common to impose additional assumptions on the incident illumination and the nature of the scatterer .",
    "we consider time - harmonic incident electromagnetic plane wave that due to the linearity of the problem will result to a time - independent system of equations .",
    "in addition , the penetrable object is considered as an infinitely long homogeneous cylinder .",
    "then , it is characterized by constant permittivity and permeability .",
    "the problem is further simplified if we impose oblique incidence for the incident wave .",
    "the three - dimensional scattering problem modeled by maxwell s equations is then equivalent to a pair of two - dimensional helmholtz equations for two scalar fields ( the third components of the electric and the magnetic fields ) .",
    "this approach reduces the difficulty of the problem but results to more complicated boundary conditions .",
    "the transmission conditions now contain also the tangential derivatives of the electric and magnetic fields . in @xcite",
    "we showed that the corresponding direct problem is well - posed and we constructed a unique solution using the direct integral equation method .",
    "a similar problem has been considered for an impedance cylinder embedded in a homogeneous @xcite , and in an inhomogeneous medium @xcite .",
    "a numerical solution of the direct problem has been also proposed using the finite element method @xcite , the galerkin method @xcite , and the method of auxiliary sources @xcite .    on the other hand , the inverse problem is non - linear and ill - posed .",
    "the non - linearity is due to the dependence of the solution of the scattering problem on the unknown boundary curve .",
    "the smoothness of the mapping from the boundary to the far - field pattern reflects the ill - posedness of the inverse problem .",
    "the unique solvability of the inverse problem is still an open problem .",
    "the first and only , to our knowledge , uniqueness result was presented recently in @xcite for the case of an impedance cylinder using the lax - phillips method .    in this work , we solve the inverse problem by formulating an equivalent system of non - linear integral equations that is solved using a regularized iterative scheme .",
    "this method was introduced by kress and rundell @xcite and then considered in many different problems , in acoustic scattering problems @xcite , in elasticity @xcite and in electrical impedance problem @xcite .",
    "we propose an iterative scheme that is based on the idea of johansson and sleeman @xcite applied to the inverse problem of recovering a perfect conducting cylinder .",
    "see @xcite for some recent applications .",
    "we assume integral representations for the solutions that results to a system consisting of four integral equations on the unknown boundary ( considering the transmission conditions ) and one on the unit circle ( taking into account the asymptotic expansion of the solutions ) .",
    "we solve this system in two steps .",
    "first , given an initial guess for the boundary curve we solve the well - posed subsystem ( equations on the boundary ) to obtain the corresponding densities and then we solve the linearized ( with respect to the boundary ) ill - posed far - field equation to update the initial approximation of the radial function .",
    "we consider tikhonov regularization and the normal equations are solved by the conjugate gradient method .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ direct ] we present the direct scattering problem , the elastic potentials and the equivalent system of integral equations that provide us with the far - field data . the inverse problem is stated in section  [ inverse ] where we construct an equivalent system of integral equation using the indirect integral equation method . in section  [ numerics ]",
    "the two - step method for the parametrized form of the system and the necessary frchet derivative of the integral operators are presented .",
    "the numerical examples give satisfactory results and justify the applicability of the proposed iterative scheme .",
    "we consider the scattering of an electromagnetic wave by a penetrable cylinder in @xmath0 .",
    "let @xmath1 we denote by @xmath2 the cylinder , where @xmath3 is a bounded domain in @xmath4 with smooth boundary @xmath5 the cylinder @xmath6 is oriented parallel to the @xmath7-axis and @xmath3 is its horizontal cross section .",

    "we illuminate the cylinder with an incident electromagnetic plane wave at oblique incidence , meaning transverse magnetic ( tm ) polarized wave .",
    "we define by @xmath23 the incident angle with respect to the negative @xmath7 axis and by @xmath24 the polar angle of the incident direction @xmath25 ( in spherical coordinates ) , see figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "then , @xmath26 and the polarization vector is given by @xmath27 satisfying @xmath28 and assuming that @xmath29        in the following , due to the linearity of the problem we suppress the time - dependence of the fields and because of the cylindrical symmetry of the medium we express the incident fields as separable functions of @xmath30 and @xmath31    let @xmath32 be the frequency and @xmath33 the wave number in @xmath22 .",
    "we define @xmath34 and @xmath35 and it follows that the incident fields can be decomposed to @xcite @xmath36 where @xmath37    after some calculations , we can reformulate maxwell s euqations as a system of equations only for the @xmath7-component of the electric and magnetic fields @xcite . the interior fields @xmath38 and @xmath39 and the exterior fields @xmath40 and @xmath41 @xmath42 satisfy the helmholtz equations @xmath43 where @xmath44 here , we assume @xmath45 in order to have @xmath46    the transmission conditions can also be written only for the @xmath7-component of the fields .",

    "we define also the integral operators @xmath76    the following theorem was proven in @xcite .",
    "let the assumptions of theorem  [ theo32 ] still hold .",
    "then , the potentials @xmath77 solve the direct transmission problem  provided that the densities @xmath78 and @xmath79 satisfy the system of integral equations @xmath80 where @xmath81 and @xmath82 the rest of the densities satisfy @xmath83 and @xmath84    the solutions @xmath60 and @xmath85 of  have the asymptotic behavior @xmath86 where @xmath87 the pair @xmath88 is called the far - field pattern corresponding to the scattering problem  .",

    "the inverse scattering problem , we address here , reads : find the shape and the position of the inclusion @xmath95 meaning reconstruct its boundary @xmath96 , given the far - field patterns @xmath97 for all @xmath98 for one or few incident fields .      to solve the inverse problem",
    "we apply the method of nonlinear boundary integral equations , which in our case results to a system of four integral equations on the unknown boundary and one on the unit circle where the far - field data are defined .",
    "this method was first introduced in @xcite and further considered in various inverse problems , see for instance @xcite . since the direct problem was solved with the direct method ( green s formulas ) , in order to obtain our numerical data , here we adopt a different approach based on the indirect integral equation method , using simple representations for the fields .",
