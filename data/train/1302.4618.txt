    "signals are often passed through linear systems , and in some applications , only the pointwise absolute value of the output is available for analysis . for example , in high - power coherent diffractive imaging , this loss of phase information is eminent , as one only has access to the power spectrum of the desired signal  @xcite . _",
    "phase retrieval _ is the problem of recovering a signal from absolute values ( squared ) of linear measurements , called _",
    "intensity measurements_. note that phase retrieval is often impossible  intensity measurements with the identity basis effectively discard the phase information of the signal s entries , and so this measurement process is not at all injective ; the power spectrum similarly discards the phases of fourier coefficients .",
    "this fact has led many researchers to invoke a priori knowledge of the desired signal , since intensity measurements might be injective when restricted to a smaller signal class .",
    "unfortunately , this route has yet to produce practical phase retrieval guarantees , and practitioners currently resort to various ad hoc methods that often fail to work .",
    "thankfully , there is an alternative approach to phase retrieval , as introduced in 2006 by balan , casazza and edidin  @xcite : seek injectivity , not by finding a smaller signal class , but rather by designing a larger ensemble of intensity measurements . in  @xcite , balan et al .",
    "characterized injectivity in the real case and further leveraged algebraic geometry to show that @xmath3 intensity measurements suffice for injectivity over @xmath1-dimensional complex signals .",
    "this realization that so few measurements can yield injectivity has since prompted a flurry of research in search of practical phase retrieval guarantees  @xcite .",
    "notably , cands , strohmer and voroninski  @xcite viewed intensity measurements as hilbert - schmidt inner products between rank-1 operators , and they applied certain intuition from compressed sensing to stably reconstruct the desired @xmath1-dimensional signal with semidefinite programming using only @xmath4 random measurements ; similar alternatives and refinements have since been identified  @xcite .",
    "another alternative exploits the polarization identity to discern relative phases between certain intensity measurements ; this method uses @xmath4 random measurements in concert with an expander graph , and comes with a similar stability guarantee  @xcite .",
    "despite these recent strides in phase retrieval algorithms , there remains a fundamental lack of understanding about what it takes for intensity measurements to be injective , let alone whether measurements yield stability ( a more numerical notion of injectivity ) .",
    "for example , until very recently , it was believed that @xmath5 intensity measurements sufficed for injectivity ( see for example  @xcite ) ; this was disproved by heinosaari , mazzarella and wolf  @xcite , who used embedding theorems from differential geometry to establish the necessity of @xmath6 measurements .",
    "as far as stability is concerned , the most noteworthy achievement to date is due to eldar and mendelson  @xcite , who proved that @xmath7 gaussian random measurements separate distant @xmath1-dimensional real signals with high probability .",
    "still , the following problem remains wide open :    what are the necessary and sufficient conditions for measurement vectors to yield injective and stable intensity measurements ?",
    "the present paper addresses this problem in a number of ways .",
    "section  2 focuses on injectivity , and it starts by providing the first known characterization of injectivity in the complex case ( theorem  [ thm.complex injective ] ) .",
    "next , we make a rather surprising identification : that intensity measurements are injective in the complex case precisely when the corresponding phase - only measurements are injective in some sense ( theorem  [ thm.complex phase only ] ) .",
    "we then use this identification to prove the necessity of the complement property for injectivity ( theorem  [ thm.complex complement property ] ) .",
    "later , we conjecture that @xmath0 intensity measurements are necessary and sufficient for injectivity in the complex case , and we prove this conjecture in the cases where @xmath2 ( theorems  [ thm.4m4 true 2 ] and  [ thm.4m4 true 3 ] ) .",
    "our proof for the @xmath8 case leverages a new test for injectivity , which we then use to verify the injectivity of a certain quantum - mechanics - inspired measurement ensemble , thereby suggesting a new refinement of wright s conjecture from  @xcite ( see conjecture  [ conjecture.new wrights ] ) .",
    "we devote section  3 to stability . here",
    ", we start by focusing on the real case , for which we give upper and lower lipschitz bounds of the intensity measurement mapping in terms of singular values of submatrices of the measurement ensemble ( lemma  [ lemma.beta expression ] and theorem  [ thm.bounding alpha ] ) ; this suggests a new matrix condition called the _",
    "strong complement property _ , which strengthens the complement property of balan et al .",
    "@xcite and bears some resemblance to the restricted isometry property of compressed sensing  @xcite .",
    "as we will discuss , our result corroborates the intuition that localized frames fail to yield stability .",
    "we then show that gaussian random measurements satisfy the strong complement property with high probability ( theorem  [ theorem.random scp bound ] ) , which nicely complements the results of eldar and mendelson  @xcite .",
    "in particular , we find an explicit , intuitive relation between the lipschitz bounds and the number of intensity measurements per dimension ( see figure  [ figure.curves ] .",
    "finally , we present results in both the real and complex cases using a stochastic noise model , much like balan did for the real case in  @xcite ; here , we leverage cramer - rao lower bounds to identify stability with stronger versions of the injectivity characterizations ( see theorems  [ thm.real random stability ] and  [ thm.complex random stability ] ) .      given a collection of measurement vectors @xmath9 in @xmath10 or @xmath11 , consider the intensity measurement process defined by @xmath12 note that @xmath13 whenever @xmath14 for some scalar @xmath15 of unit modulus .",

    "therefore , it suffices to show that @xmath35 is cp if @xmath145 is injective . to complete the proof ,",
    "we will obtain the contrapositive ( note the similarity to the proof of theorem  [ thm.complement property characterization ] ) .",

    "moreover , @xmath46 and @xmath47 are nonzero by assumption , and so @xmath48 .",
    "note that the complement property is necessary but not sufficient for injectivity . to see this ,",

    "these certainly satisfy the complement property , but @xmath156 , despite the fact that @xmath157 ; in general , real measurement vectors fail to yield injective intensity measurements in the complex setting since they do not distinguish complex conjugates .",
    "indeed , we have yet to find a `` good '' sufficient condition for injectivity in the complex case . as an analogy for what we really want ,",
    "consider the notion of _ full spark _ : an ensemble @xmath158 is said to be full spark if every subcollection of @xmath1 vectors spans @xmath27 .",
    "it is easy to see that full spark ensembles with @xmath159 necessarily satisfy the complement property ( thereby implying injectivity in the real case ) , and furthermore , the notion of full spark is simple enough to admit deterministic constructions  @xcite .",
    "deterministic measurement ensembles are particularly desirable for the complex case , and so finding a good sufficient condition for injectivity is an important problem that remains open .",
    "if you think of a matrix @xmath35 as being built one column at a time , then the rank - nullity theorem states that each column contributes to either the column space or the null space . if the columns are then used as linear measurement vectors ( say we take measurements @xmath160 of a vector @xmath161 )",
    ", then the column space of @xmath35 gives the subspace that is actually sampled , and the null space captures the algebraic nature of the measurements redundancy .",
    "therefore , an efficient sampling of an entire vector space would apply a matrix @xmath35 with a small null space and large column space ( e.g. , an invertible square matrix ) .",
    "how do we find such a sampling with intensity measurements ? the following makes this question more precise :    [ prob.n star ] for any dimension @xmath1 , what is the smallest number @xmath162 of injective intensity measurements , and how do we design such measurement vectors ?    to be clear , this problem was completely solved in the real case by balan , casazza and edidin  @xcite . indeed ,",
    "theorem  [ thm.complement property characterization ] immediately implies that @xmath163 intensity measurements are necessarily not injective , and furthermore that @xmath164 measurements are injective if and only if the measurement vectors are full spark . as such",
    ", we will focus our attention to the complex case .",
    "in the complex case , problem  [ prob.n star ] has some history in the quantum mechanics literature .",
    "for example , @xcite presents _",
    "wright s conjecture _ that three observables suffice to uniquely determine any pure state . in phase retrieval parlance ,",
    "the conjecture states that there exist unitary matrices @xmath165 , @xmath166 and @xmath167 such that @xmath168 $ ] yields injective intensity measurements ( here , the measurement vectors are the columns of @xmath35 ) . note that wright s conjecture actually implies that @xmath169 ; indeed , @xmath165 determines the norm ( squared ) of the signal , rendering the last column of both @xmath166 and @xmath167 unnecessary .",
    "finkelstein  @xcite later proved that @xmath170 ; combined with wright s conjecture , this led many to believe that @xmath171 ( for example , see  @xcite ) .",
    "however , both this and wright s conjecture were recently disproved in  @xcite , in which heinosaari , mazzarella and wolf invoked embedding theorems from differential geometry to prove that @xmath172 where @xmath173 is the number of @xmath174 s in the binary representation of @xmath175 . by comparison , balan , casazza and edidin  @xcite proved that @xmath176 , and so we at least have the asymptotic expression @xmath177 .    at this point , we should clarify some intuition for @xmath162 by explaining the nature of these best known lower and upper bounds .",
    "first , the lower bound   follows from an older result that complex projective space @xmath178 does not smoothly embed into @xmath179 ( and other slight refinements which depend on @xmath42 ) ; this is due to mayer  @xcite , but we highly recommend james s survey on the topic  @xcite . to prove   from this ,",
    "suppose @xmath59 were injective",
    ". then @xmath180 defined by @xmath181 embeds @xmath182 into @xmath183 , and as heinosaari et al .",
    "show , the embedding is necessarily smooth ; considering @xmath184 is made up of rather simple polynomials , the fact that @xmath180 is smooth should not come as a surprise .",
    "as such , the nonembedding result produces the best known lower bound . to evaluate this bound , first note that milgram  @xcite constructs an embedding of @xmath178 into @xmath185 , establishing the importance of the @xmath186 term , but",
    "the constructed embedding does not correspond to an intensity measurement process . in order to relate these embedding results to our problem ,",
    "consider the real case : it is known that for odd @xmath187 , real projective space @xmath188 smoothly embeds into @xmath189  @xcite , which means the analogous lower bound for the real case would necessarily be smaller than @xmath190 .",
    "this indicates that the @xmath191 term in   might be an artifact of the proof technique , rather than of @xmath162 .",
    "there is also some intuition to be gained from the upper bound @xmath176 , which balan et al .  proved by applying certain techniques from algebraic geometry ( some of which we will apply later in this section ) .",
    "in fact , their result actually gives that @xmath3 or more measurement vectors , if chosen _ generically _ , will yield injective intensity measurements ; here , generic is a technical term involving the zariski topology , but it can be thought of as some undisclosed property which is satisfied with probability 1 by measurement vectors drawn from continuous distributions .",
    "this leads us to think that @xmath162 generic measurement vectors might also yield injectivity .",

    "we will focus on another alternative .",
    "note that @xmath332 defines a metric on @xmath23 , and consider the following :    [ definition.worst-case stability ] we say @xmath333 is _",
    "@xmath326-stable _ if for every @xmath334 , there exists an estimator @xmath335 such that for every nonzero signal @xmath336 and adversarial noise term @xmath268 with @xmath337 , the relative error in reconstruction satisfies @xmath338    according to this definition , @xmath339 is more stable when @xmath326 is smaller .",

    "overall , this notion of stability offers the invariance to scaling we originally desired . with this , if we find a measurement process @xmath339 which is @xmath326-stable with minimal @xmath326 , at that point , we can take advantage of noise with bounded magnitude by amplifying @xmath339 ( and thereby effectively increasing @xmath340 ) until the relative error in reconstruction is tolerable .",
    "now that we have a notion of stability , we provide a sufficient condition :    [ thm.bilipschitz ] suppose @xmath339 is bilipschitz , that is , there exist constants @xmath349 such that @xmath350 if @xmath351 , then @xmath339 is @xmath352-stable .",

    "then @xmath369 , and so @xmath370 has a subsequence which converges to @xmath161 . since @xmath370 is also cauchy , we therefore have @xmath371 .",

    "note that the `` project - and - invert '' estimator we used to demonstrate stability is far from new .",
    "for example , if the noise were modeled as gaussian random , then project - and - invert is precisely the maximum likelihood estimator .",

    "all is not lost , however .",
    "as we will see , with this notion of stability , it happens to be more convenient to consider @xmath398 , defined entrywise by @xmath399 .",

    "note that all of this analysis specifically treats the real case ; indeed , the metric we use would not be appropriate in the complex case .",
    "however , just like the complement property is necessary for injectivity in the complex case ( theorem  [ thm.complex complement property ] ) , we suspect that the strong complement property is necessary for stability in the complex case , but we have no proof of this .",
    "as an example of how to apply theorem  [ thm.bounding alpha ] , pick @xmath1 and @xmath259 to both be even and let @xmath435 be the @xmath436 matrix you get by collecting the first @xmath437 rows of the @xmath438 discrete fourier transform matrix with entries of unit modulus .",
