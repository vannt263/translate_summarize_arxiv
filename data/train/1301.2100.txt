    "the spinning electric solar wind sail ( e - sail ) @xcite and the spinning heliogyro photon sail @xcite have been proposed for propellantless interplanetary travel .",
    "likewise , various leo deorbiting devices based on coulomb drag @xcite and atmospheric drag @xcite have been proposed for mitigating the space debris problem by deorbiting satellites after their mission is complete and by deorbiting already existing junk objects by attaching braking devices to them .        in this paper",
    "we consider a freely guided photonic blade ( fgpb ) which is part of a spinning system so that it is kept stretched by the centrifugal force . in ground - based conditions we can mimic the centrifugal force by gravity ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hang]a ) . if a ballast mass is moved sideways ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hang]b , c ) , a difference between the centre of mass and centre of photon pressure is created and consequently the photon pressure starts to turn the blade about the vertical axis .",
    "this gives a simple way to control the blade s orientation with respect to sunlight and thus to control the direction of the photonic thrust vector .    throughout the paper",
    "we treat the heliogyro photonic blades as rigid objects .",
    "although the blade is in reality free to bend and is not made of rigid material , the rigid body approximation is valid if the shape of the blade does not differ markedly from a planar surface .",
    "this is the case if the membrane is lightweight in comparison to the mass of the remote unit which controls it or if the spin of the sail is fast so that the centrifugal force acting on the blade is much larger than the actuated part of the photon pressure force .",
    "if the blade is made very long and if it is actuated from either end , it tends to twist in response to actuation instead of tilting uniformly .",
    "problems due to twisting and bending increase in severity if the blade s aspect angle @xmath0 ( length versus width ) is made larger . in the formulas of this paper",
    "the aspect ratio @xmath0 appears as a free parameter .",
    "this allows us to e.g.  compare the packing efficiency of different sail concepts in a regime where both are configured with the same aspect ratio .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows .",
    "we first treat the traditional photonic heliogyro and its issues , then consider the improved fgpb heliogyro variant and then consider a scalable and modular e - sail by adding tethers to the heliogyro . after that we outline analogous leo deorbiting applications for both e - sail and heliogyro , discuss briefly fgpb implementation and demonstration options and close the paper with a summary and outlook .",
    "the traditional heliogyro @xcite ( fig .",
    "[ fig : tradheliog ] ) is a type of solar photon sail which has several benefits compared to three - axis stabilised square sails .",
    "recently the heliogyro concept has received renewed interest with more detailed dynamical models of blade dynamics @xcite and news strategies for managing blade twisting @xcite .",
    "the heliogyro spacecraft deploys its sheetlike photonic blades from storage reels located on its perimeter .",
    "the blade tilting angle ( analogous to the angle of attack of helicopter blades ) can then be controlled mechanically from the main spacecraft to enable photonic thrust vectoring with or without spinplane turning as well as to have a capability to modify the spin rate @xcite .",
    "the heliogyro is simple to manufacture and to qualify because the sail membrane is not a large continuous two - dimensional piece but instead consists of rolled sheets similar to those normally used in industry to store and transport thin film materials .",
    "also , because the sail material is nowhere folded and the system uses the centrifugal force for deployment and stretching , the deployment sequence can be demonstrated on ground simply by simulating the centrifugal acceleration by earth s gravity field .",
    "the coriolis acceleration of the spinning configuration in space can not be simulated by gravity on earth , but it can be made small by selecting a slow speed of deployment .",
    "an issue with the heliogyro is , however , that with the limited physical dimensions usually available for the main spacecraft inside the payload fairing of the launch vehicle , the total area of the photonic sail is limited .",
    "consider the case where the radius @xmath1 of the stowed configuration has some set value and let us compute the maximal sail area as a function of the number @xmath2 of the blades , under the assumption that the maximum aspect ratio of the blade ( length versus width ) is @xmath0 . to simplify the analysis",
    "let us ignore the thickness of the reels .",
    "the sail is then spanned by a regular polygon enclosed within a circle with radius @xmath1 .",
    "the side length of the polygon is @xmath3 , the blade length @xmath4 by our assumption , and the total area of the blades is given by @xmath5 table [ table : heliogyro ] gives the sail area @xmath6 for various @xmath2 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : a ] ) . also the area of the largest inscribed disk inside the polygon @xmath7",
    "is given which is representative of the space available for the payload .",
    "we see from table [ table : heliogyro ] that the optimum choice in terms of sail area is @xmath8 , but @xmath9 is almost as good and it provides a two times larger payload space .",
    "we therefore adopt the four blade design ( fig .",
    "[ fig : tradheliog ] ) as representative of the traditional heliogyro in this paper .",
    "we emphasise that the four blade optimum applies only to the traditional heliogyro , not the new fgpb heliogyro which is introduced in the next section .",
