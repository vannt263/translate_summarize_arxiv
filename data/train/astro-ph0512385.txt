    "one of the most remarkable results of recent observational studies of @xmath0 cen is that it shows a double main sequence ( dms ) in the color magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) of its stellar populations ( e.g. , anderson 1997 ; bedin et al .",
    "bedin et al .",
    "( 2004 ) proposed four possible scenarios for the origin of the dms : ( 1 ) theoretical isochrone models or data calibration are in error , ( 2 ) stars on the bluer main sequence ( bms ) of the dms are a super metal - poor ( [ fe / h]@xmath2 ) population , ( 3 ) the bms represents a very helium - rich ( @xmath3 ) population , and ( 4 ) the bms represents a background stellar population about @xmath4 kpc behind @xmath0 cen .",
    "a number of recent investigations have suggested that the above scenario ( 3 ) ( hereafter referred to as the `` helium pollution scenario '' and abbreviated to `` heps '' for convenience ) is the most promising among the four ( e.g. , lee et al . 2005 ; norris 2004 ; piotto et al .",
    "2005 ) .    in the heps",
    ", there were two epochs of major star formation in the history of @xmath0 cen .",
    "the first generation of stars was formed from proto - globular cluster ( gc ) cloud(s ) to become stars on the red main sequence ( rms ) whereas the second generation of stars was formed from gas ejected from the rms .",
    "one of the key questions related to the heps is whether and how the observationally suggested large helium enrichment ( @xmath5 ) for the bms can be obtained from the rms with normal @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) in the star formation history of @xmath0 cen ( e.g. , norris 2004 ) .",
    "there are three candidates for the helium overabundance ( norris 2004 ; dantona et al .",
    "2005 ; piotto et al . 2005 ) : ( 1 ) agb stars with the masses larger than @xmath8 , ( 2 ) stellar winds associated with massive stars during their early evolutionary phases , and ( 3 ) type ii supernovae ( sne ii ) .",
    "it is however unclear which of the above three is the most reasonable and realistic in the heps given a lack of extensive theoretical studies on the three candidates .",
    "the purpose of this letter is to investigate the three possibilities in a quantitative manner and thereby discuss which is the most promising as the cause of the bms ( and the dms ) in the context of the heps . in this investigation , ( 1 )",
    "the possible @xmath6 value observationally suggested for @xmath0 cen ( norris 2004 ; piotto et al .",
    "2005 ) and ( 2 ) the observed number fraction of the bms ( bedin et al . 2004 ) are used to constrain the best possible initial mass function ( imf ) of forming stars in the heps .",
    "we do not intend to discuss extensively the observed abundance pattern of the bms and the rms in this paper , because chemical yield tables for agb stars with helium - rich ejecta ( @xmath9 ) are not currently available .",
    "we will discuss this point in our forthcoming papers ( bekki & norris 2005 ; bn ) .",
    "previous theoretical studies demonstrated that if gcs lose more than 50% of their initial masses , they will disintegrate ( e.g. , geyer & burkert 2001 ) .",
    "we also use this result as a constraint for globular cluster imf in the heps .",
    "we demonstrate that none of the above three candidates can explain the above constraint ( 2 ) without the modeled @xmath0 cen disintegrating .",
    "firstly we summarize the possible three `` polluters '' which can significantly enrich @xmath0 cen with helium if the second generation of stars ( i.e. , the bms ) was formed from their ejecta . in order for the observationally",
    "suggested large value of @xmath6 ( @xmath10 ) to be explained , we need to select stellar objects whose ejecta have @xmath6 significantly higher than 0.24 .",
    "figure 1 shows the helium mass fraction ( @xmath6 ) in the ejecta of three candidates ; ( 1 ) agb stars ( van den hoek & groenewegen 1997 , hereafter referred to as vg97 ) ; ventura & dantona 2005 , as va05 ) , ( 2 ) massive stars ( schaller et al .",
    "1992 , s92 ) , and ( 3 ) sne ii ( woosley & weaver 1995 , ww95 ) . based on the values listed in these papers ,",
    "@xmath6 is derived for each stellar mass .",
    "the theoretical predictions of @xmath6 for agb stars is at most 0.28 for vg97 and 0.32 for va05 .",
    "dantona et al .",
    "( 2005 ) however suggested that more massive agb stars with the masses of @xmath11 can have @xmath12 ( see also lattanzio et al .",
    "we therefore consider that massive agb stars can be the polluters in @xmath0 cen but that lower mass agb objects ( @xmath13 ) with smaller @xmath6 can not .",
    "the observed difference in metallicity ( [ fe / h ] ) between the rms and the bms ( piotto et al . 2005 ) suggests that the above scenario ( 1 ) alone can not simply explain the metallicity difference , because metallicity of agb ejecta do not differ from those of their host stars .",
    "therefore , full chemical evolution models including the contribution of the three polluters ( and mixing between the ejecta of the polluters and fresh gas ) need to be considered if we try to explain fully self - consistently both the helium and metallicity one between the rms and the bms .",
    "we however discuss advantages and disadvantages of each of the three polluters in the helium enrichment process separately .",
    "this will better permit us to disentangle the contribution of the different polluters in producing he - enhanced stars and thereby to analyze advantages and disadvantages of each scenario in explaining the helium abundance of the bms .",
    "the entire chemical evolution history for different elements ( e.g. , @xmath14c ) in @xmath0 cen will be discussed in our future papers ( bn ) .",
    "the first question is whether the number fraction of the second generation of stars ( i.e. , the bms fraction ) can be as large as @xmath15 ( bedin et al .",
    "2004 ) for a reasonable imf without @xmath0 cen being disintegrated following mass loss from massive stars and sne ii . in order to estimate the mass fraction ( @xmath16 ) of agb progenitor stars with masses ranging from @xmath8 to @xmath17 in a gc with the total mass of @xmath18 , we assume an imf in number defined as @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the initial mass of each individual star and the slope @xmath21 corresponds to the salpeter imf . the normalization factor",
    "@xmath22 is a function of @xmath18 , @xmath23 ( lower mass cut - off ) , and @xmath24 ( upper one ) .",
    "a is expressed as @xmath25 , where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are set to be @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively .",
    "although the number fraction of low - mass stars on the bms can depend on the forms of imfs , we adopt the above imf and show the results .",
    "this is mainly because we can show more clearly the roles of imf slopes in controlling the mass fraction of agb stars for the adopted imf in this preliminary study . the models with the imf proposed by kroupa et al .",
    "( 1993 ) show a rather small fraction ( @xmath28 % ) of agb stars in comparsion with the models with the above imf .    in this agb pollution scenario",
    ", we assume that ( 1 ) the gas ejected from agb stars in the first generation ( i.e. , the rms ) is all used ( i.e. , a star formation efficiency of 100 % ) for the formation of the second generation ( i.e. , the bms ) and ( 2 ) the total amount of gas ejected from a agb star is the same as the stellar mass .",
    "this second assumption is reasonable because more than 80 % of the stellar mass is ejected as agb winds for agb stars with @xmath29 ( e.g. , vg97 ) .",
    "we also assume two different slopes of imf ( @xmath30 ) for the first ( @xmath31 ) and the second ( @xmath32 ) generations of stars in order to investigate the maximum value of @xmath33 , where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the number of stars ( per unit mass ) with masses smaller than @xmath36 ( corresponding to stars older than @xmath37 gyr ) for the first generation and for the second one , respectively .",
    "figure 2 shows that the smaller the imf slope @xmath31 is ( i.e. , the imf becomes more `` top - heavy '' ) , the larger the number fraction of the second generation ( @xmath33 ) becomes for a fixed @xmath32 of @xmath38 .",
    "the ratio of the final cluster mass to its initial mass ( @xmath39 ) however also becomes smaller for smaller @xmath31 . as a result of this ,",
    "@xmath39 of the models with @xmath40 become smaller than the threshold value ( 0.5 ) below which star clusters can be disintegrated as the result of mass loss ( e.g. , geyer & burkert 2001 ) : no models can be located within the regions with @xmath41 and with @xmath42 where @xmath0 cen can survive possible disintegration and have the bms fraction consistent with observations .",
    "the number fraction of the second generation can not be larger than 0.16 , even for @xmath32 = @xmath43 ( i.e. , extremely bottom - heavy ) and @xmath31 = @xmath44 for which @xmath0 cen can manage to survive disintegration due to mass loss .",
    "thus the results in figure 2 suggest that the observed fraction of the bms can not be explained simply by the agb pollution scenario for reasonable imfs .",
    "if @xmath24 is as low as @xmath45 , @xmath0 cen can not disintegrate owing to mass loss from sne ii for any values of @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "it is found that @xmath33 is about 0.29 for the model with @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 .",
    "this result suggests that if @xmath0 cen was formed with a very unusual imf ( i.e. , with no or little sne ii ) , the observed bms fraction can be reproduced without disintegration of @xmath0 cen . the above model with no or little stellar remnants ( black holes and neutron stars ) of massive stars , however , would not be consistent with the presence of neutron stars in @xmath0 cen ( e.g. , haggard et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "the helium mass fraction in the stellar winds of massive stars with @xmath49 can become as high as 0.4 with a maximum of 0.49 for @xmath50 ( schaller et al .",
    "although there is no problem with @xmath6 in this scenario , the mass fraction of massive stars with @xmath49 can not be as large as @xmath51 for reasonable imfs ( @xmath52 ) for which @xmath0 cen does not disintegrate .",
    "figure 3 shows that the mass fraction of the ejecta of the massive stars is at most @xmath53 for a plausible range of imf slopes .",
    "given the fact that the observed star formation efficiency in the galaxy can be at most @xmath54 ( wilking & lada 1983 for the @xmath55 oph cloud ) , this result suggests that the observed fraction of the bms ( @xmath51 ) is unlikely to be explained by this scenario .",
    "a more serious problem for this stellar wind scenario is that there would be no or little difference in the mean metallicity between the first generation of stars and the ejecta of these objects ( schaller et al . 1992 ) : piotto et al .",
    "( 2005 ) demonstrated that there is a metallicity difference by @xmath56[m / h]@xmath57 between the rms and the ( more metal - rich ) bms in @xmath0 cen .",
    "another possible problem of this stellar wind scenario is that the ejecta should be very quickly converted into stars ( within less than @xmath58 yr ) between the stellar wind phases of very massive stars and the onset of sne ii that can blow away the ejecta from @xmath0 cen .",
    "the helium mass fraction ( @xmath6 ) in the ejecta of sne ii stars with @xmath59 for metal - poor stars with @xmath60 ranges from 0.37 to 0.45 .",
    "although this scenario has no problems with @xmath6 , the abundance by mass for heavier elements in the ejecta is too high to be consistent with observations .",
    "@xmath14c and @xmath61ca in ww95 are as high as @xmath62 and @xmath63 , respectively , which are higher than the solar values ( @xmath64 and @xmath65 , respectively ; ww95 ) and thus much higher than those of @xmath0 cen .",
    "this inconsistency with the observed metallicities suggests that the bms can not be formed directly from the ejecta of sne ii of the rms .",
    "if the ejecta of sne ii can be mixed with the primordial gas used for the formation of the rms , the abundance of @xmath14c and @xmath61ca of the bms formed from the mixed gas can be significantly reduced . however , the helium abundance would also be significantly reduced in the process of mixing .",
    "therefore it can be concluded that this scenario is highly unlikely to explain the observed abundance of the bms .",
    "furthermore this scenario has difficulty in explaining the observed fraction of the bms without assuming top - heavy imfs , just as the other two scenarios do .",
    "the present study shows that the proposed three scenarios all fail to explain self - consistently the observed properties of the bms in @xmath0 cen .",
    "the agb scenario appears to be the most promising among the three , though it remains unclear whether this scenario can explain the observed abundances other than helium in @xmath0 cen .",
    "the most serious problem of the agb scenario is that the total mass of the ejecta of more massive agb stars from the rms is too small to be consistent with the observed fraction of the bms of @xmath0 cen . if however we relax the adopted assumption that _ all stars of the bms originate from agb ejecta of the rms initially within @xmath0 cen _ , the problem of the agb scenario can be significantly alleviated .",
    "the problem of the bms fraction can be solved if the original total mass of the rms was larger ( by a factor of @xmath66 ) than the present mass ( i.e. , if @xmath0 cen was a super - giant gc ) and if most of the stars of the rms were removed from @xmath0 cen after their ejecta were used for the formation of the bms .",
    "we here discuss a scenario in which _",
    "@xmath0 cen was the nucleus of a nucleated dwarf galaxy ( de , n ) where the agb ejecta of the central field stellar populations surrounding the ( proto- ) @xmath0 cen were consumed for star formation of the bms . _ in this scenario ,",
    "the ancient host de , n of @xmath0 cen has been completely destroyed by the galactic tidal field so that only its nucleus ( i.e. , @xmath0 cen ) is now observed ( e.g. , bekki & freeman 2003 ) .",
    "not only the ejecta of the rms but also those from stellar populations surrounding the nucleus can be used for the formation of the bms : the above bms fraction problem should not be so serious in this scenario",
    ". the bms can be more metal - rich than the rms if the mean abundance of the field stellar populations and gas in the dwarf is slightly higher than that of the rms .",
    "the key question in this scenario is how much gas ejected from the central field stars can be converted into the bms without being removed by energetic outflow of agb stars in the central regions of @xmath0 cen s host de , n .",
    "recent numerical simulations on transformation from a de , n into @xmath0 cen have suggested that @xmath0 cen s host de , n has @xmath67 mag , corresponding to the total stellar mass of 1.25@xmath68 @xmath69 m@xmath70 ( e.g. , bekki & freeman 1993 ) . if the total mass of the bms is about 30% of present - day @xmath0 cen s mass (= 5.0 @xmath68 @xmath71 m@xmath70 ; meylan et al .",
    "1995 ) , it is necessary for only 1.2% of the stellar mass of the de , n to have been converted into the bms . since the mass fraction of more massive agb stars in the de ,",
    "n ( @xmath72 ) for a reasonable imf can be significantly larger than the above value ( @xmath62 ) , the observed bms fraction is not a problem in this new scenario .",
    "the central escape velocity ( @xmath73 ) of this host embedded in a massive dark matter halo with the total mass of @xmath74 is @xmath75 km s@xmath76 depending on the inner profile of dark matter halo ( bekki 2005 ) .",
    "the derived @xmath73 is significantly larger than the observed maximum wind velocity of @xmath77 km s@xmath76 for agb stars ( e.g. , loup et al . 1993 ) .",
    "therefore , the agb ejecta of the de , n is highly likely to be trapped within the central region of the de , n and consequently converted into new stars ( i.e. , the bms ) .",
    "although extensive numerical simulations on the central gas dynamics of a de , n are necessary to confirm that gas ejected from field stars of the de , n can be transferred into the nuclear region and converted into new stars there , we propose that the bms can originate from gas ejected from stars within the ancient de , n whose nucleus was @xmath0 cen .      the local helium abundance of the remaining gas of forming @xmath0 cen might have been significantly higher ( leading to a bms with higher helium abundance ) , if helium sedimentation due to gravitational diffusion ( which was originally proposed by fabian & pringle ( 1977 ) for a mechanism responsible for gaseous abundance gradients in clusters of galaxies ) occurred in @xmath0 cen .",
    "chuzhoy & loeb ( 2004 ) showed that gravitational diffusion in the interstellar medium of giant elliptical galaxies can result in the increase of helium abundance by a factor of @xmath78 , where @xmath79 and @xmath80 are the gas temperature and the suppression factor ( likely to be @xmath81 ) of the gravitational diffusion by the magnetic field .",
    "these results suggest that a significant increase of helium abundance is highly unlikely within gcs , which have the central velocity dispersions of order of 10 km s@xmath76 , corresponding to @xmath82 k.",
    "we have shown that the observed bms fraction of @xmath0 cen can not be simply explained by any heps in which the bms was formed from ejecta of the rms . we accordingly have suggested an `` external pollution '' scenario in which the bms was formed from gas that was initially within the central region of @xmath0 cen s host galaxy .",
    "the question yet to be answered in this scenario is how star formation could proceed within the rms when gas was transferred to the central region .",
    "it would be possible that the bms was formed outside yet close to the rms as a star cluster and then merged with the rms in the central region of @xmath0 cen s host galaxy .",
