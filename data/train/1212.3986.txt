    "the evaporation of a liquid drop from a flat solid substrate has been studied extensively , for example in the context of evaporation - driven particle deposition @xcite and evaporative cooling @xcite .",
    "however , apparently little is known about the evaporation of liquid drops from a liquid subphase . on a liquid subphase",
    "the contact line of the drop is not pinned , the subphase is deformable , and the evaporation can generate a flow in both liquid phases .",
    "examples of such a system are gasoline or oil drops on water , or water drops on mercury .",
    "similar interface deformations occur for drops evaporating from soft , deformable solid substrates @xcite , for which the flow geometry is reminiscent of drops floating on another liquid subphase .",
    "evaporation of sufficiently small sessile drops under atmospheric conditions is usually governed by the diffusive transport of vapour in the surrounding air @xcite .",
    "the evaporative flux from the drop surface drives a radially outward flow inside the drop , which is responsible for the so - called coffee - stain effect @xcite . in drops where the contact line is free to move",
    ", there is an additional contribution to the flow field that comes from the receding motion of the contact line @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the non - uniform evaporation of sessile drops leads to temperature gradients on the liquid - air interface .",
    "the subsequent marangoni flows can give rise to additional circulation @xcite .",
    "it has remained a challenge to characterize the flow near the contact line , due to the small length scales involved and the evaporative singularity .",
    "recently , we have studied the nature of the flow near the pinned contact line of a liquid drop evaporating from a flat solid surface by approximating the drop profile by a wedge geometry @xcite .",
    "we have shown that the stokes flow in this wedge - shaped region can be described by similarity solutions and consists of three contributions : flow driven by the evaporative flux from the drop surface , flow induced by the downward motion of the liquid - air interface , and an eigenmode flow that satisfies the homogeneous boundary conditions and can give rise to moffatt corner eddies @xcite .    here , we investigate the evaporation of a liquid drop from a liquid subphase , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) .",
    "we consider drops with a size smaller than the capillary length . in that case , the interface of the liquid subphase remains horizontal and the drop attains the shape of a lens .",
    "the angles @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 between the liquids are dictated by the three surface tensions in the system via the neumann construction , such that both the horizontal and vertical components of the capillary forces add to zero @xcite .",
    ", @xmath2 , and @xmath3 between the two liquids can be found from the neumann construction at the three - phase contact line .",
    "the dashed square marks the area close to the contact line , where the drop shape can be approximated by a wedge .",
    "( b ) an overview of the wedge geometry containing both liquid 1 and liquid 2 .",
    "the contact line is located at the origin of the polar coordinate system ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) . the evaporative flux @xmath6 ( indicated by the arrows ) from the surface of liquid 1 drives the flow inside liquid 1 , which is coupled to the flow in liquid 2 via the continuity of velocity and shear stress conditions.,width=15 ]    we focus again on the nature of the flow near the contact line of the drop , where the drop shape can be approximated by a wedge geometry , see fig . [ fig1](b ) .",
    "the evaporation of liquid 1 will cause a flow in both liquids 1 and 2 .",
    "we describe these flows by deriving self - similar solutions to the stokes equations in a wedge geometry , in which the flows in both phases are coupled dynamically .",
    "again , the flow in the wedge consists of three contributions : the evaporative - flux driven flow , the flow due to the receding motion of the contact line , and the eigenmode flow for the coupled phases . the eigenmode flow in a similar double - wedge region was already investigated by anderson & davis @xcite .",
    "they found conditions under which moffatt eddies can be present in viscous flow of two fluids near a corner of two rigid planes . the present work is a variation of this problem , where there are two free surfaces and one of the liquids evaporates .",
    "a parametric study is performed to investigate how much flow is generated in the liquid subsphase by the evaporation of the liquid drop as a function of the angles @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 , and the viscosity ratio of the two liquids .",
    "we first treat the three flow contributions separately , and then identify the regime in which each contribution is asymptotically dominant .",
    "the geometry of the drop close to the contact line can be approximated by a two - dimensional wedge , see fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) .",
    "the three contact angles between the liquids in the wedge add to @xmath7 . to ensure both horizontal and vertical balances between the surface tensions at the three - phase contact line ,",
    "these angles are restricted to @xmath8 .",
    "we adopt a polar coordinate system ( @xmath9 ) with the origin located at the contact line and define the velocities in terms of streamfunctions @xmath10 and @xmath11 as @xmath12 the flow is governed by the stokes equations , or equivalently , in terms of the streamfunctions , by the biharmonic equations @xmath13 the general self - similar solutions to the biharmonic equations in the two liquids are @xcite    [ sol ] _ 1(,)&=&^m , + _ 2(,)&=&^n ,    where @xmath14 ; in that case , the form ( [ sol ] ) is degenerate and additional terms arise .",
    "the exponents @xmath15 and @xmath16 will be selected by the boundary conditions .",
    "the solution to the flow field described by ( [ stokes ] ) consists of three contributions @xcite .",
    "one contribution comes from the evaporative mass flux from the free surface of liquid 1 , which drives a flow inside the drop . a second contribution arises from the volume change of the drop due to the evaporative mass loss . in case",
    "the contact line of the drop is pinned , there will be a corresponding contribution to the flow field due to the downward motion of the liquid - air interface @xcite . on a liquid subphase however , the contact line of the drop is not pinned . instead",
    ", there is a receding motion of the contact line , which results in a decrease in the drop radius and gives a contribution to the flow field .",
    "the third contribution to the flow field is the classical `` eigenmode '' solution to the homogeneous problem for which all boundary conditions are zero , as described by dean & montagnon @xcite , moffatt @xcite , and anderson & davis @xcite .",
    "from now on , we will refer to these contributions as the _ flux solution _ , the _ moving contact - line solution _ , and the _ eigenmode solution_. since ( [ stokes ] ) is a linear system , we can consider each of these three contributions separately",

    "the conditions above are the homogeneous boundary conditions for the coupled system of @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "the inhomogeneous condition comes from the evaporative flux that drives the flow .",
    "we impose that liquid 1 evaporates , while liquid 2 is assumed non - volatile    [ outflux ] & u__1(,)&=j ( ) , + & u__2(,+)&=0 ,    with @xmath6 the evaporative flux and @xmath26 the liquid density . the evaporative flux from the drop surface is known from the solution to the diffusion equation describing the vapor concentration field in a corner geometry @xcite",

    "a fourth contribution to the flow could come from the marangoni effect : the non - uniform evaporation of the drop leads to temperature gradients on the drop surface , which induces marangoni stresses @xcite .",

    "a direct consequence of our analysis of the moving contact - line solution is the exact expression ( including the prefactor ) for the time evolution of the drop radius in time ( [ rtime ] ) , which could easily be verified . to our knowledge",
    ", the evaporation time of a drop on a liquid subphase has not been investigated experimentally so far .",
    "we have applied the solutions to the flow in a wedge geometry that contains two liquid phases to the situation of a volatile drop evaporating from a non - volatile liquid subphase .",
    "the same solutions also hold for the inverse problem of a non - volatile drop on a volatile subphase , such as oil drops on water . in that case , however , the outer problem for the evaporation is different , since we have a volatile liquid bath instead of a volatile drop .",
    "evaporation will lead to a decrease in the bath level , leaving the drop geometry unchanged .",
    "hence , the prefactor in the expression for the evaporative flux ( [ evapflux ] ) will be different . since there is no contact - line motion in this case ,",
