    "a hierarchical triple system consists of a binary system and a third body on a wider orbit .",
    "the motion of such a system can be pictured as the motion of two binaries : the binary itself ( inner binary ) and the binary which consists of the third body and the centre of mass of the binary ( outer binary ) .",
    "hierarchical triple systems are widely present in the galactic field and in star clusters and studying the dynamical evolution of such systems is a key to understanding a number of issues in astronomy and astrophysics . sometimes , for example , the inner pairs in triple stellar systems are _ close _ binary systems , i.e. the separation between the components is comparable to the radii of the bodies . in these circumstances ,",
    "the behaviour of the inner binary can depend very sensitively on the separation of its components and this in turn is affected by the third body .",
    "thus , a slight change in the separation of the binary stars can cause drastic changes in processes such as tidal friction and dissipation , mass transfer and mass loss due to a stellar wind , which may result in changes in stellar structure and evolution ( e.g. kiseleva , eggleton @xmath0 mikkola 1998 ) . eventually , these physical changes can affect the dynamics of the whole triple system .",
    "but even in systems with well - separated inner binary components , the perturbation of the third body can have a devastating effect on the triple system as a whole ( e.g. disruption of the system ) .    for most hierarchical triple stars ,",
    "the period ratio @xmath1 is of the order of 100 and these systems are probably very stable dynamically .",
    "however , there are systems with much smaller period ratios , like the system hd 109648 with @xmath2 ( jha et al . 2000 ) , the @xmath3 tau system , with @xmath4 ( fekel @xmath0 tomkin 1982 ) and the ch cyg system with @xmath5 ( hinkle et al .",
    "1993 ) .    in a previous paper ( georgakarakos 2002 ) we derived a formula for the inner eccentricity in hierarchical triple systems with coplanar and initially circular orbits",
    "now , the calculation is extended to systems with eccentric outer binaries ( the inner orbit is still considered to be initially circular ) .",
    "we derive expressions for the short period and secular evolution of the inner eccentricity .",
    "both short period and secular terms will be obtained as previously ( georgakarakos 2002 ) , i.e. by using the definition of the runge - lenz vector for the former and by means of canonical perturbation theory for the latter .",
    "again , at any moment of the evolution of the system , the eccentricity is considered to consist of a short period and a long period ( secular ) component , i.e. @xmath6 ( one can picture this by recalling the expansion of the disturbing function in solar system dynamics , where the perturbing potential is given as a sum of an infinite number of cosines of various frequencies ) .",
    "thus , the eccentricity being initially zero implies that @xmath7 ( initially ) .    finally , in this paper , we will be concentrating on systems with well separated components and comparable masses .",
    "therefore , while developing the theoretical model in the next sections , we will consider @xmath1 to be large ( or any equivalent form of that assumption ) .",
    "first , we calculate the short - period terms .",
    "the motion of the system can be studied using the jacobi decomposition of the three - body problem ( fig .",
    "[ jacform ] ) . in that context , the equation of motion of the inner binary is : @xmath8 where @xmath9 , the perturbation to the inner binary motion , is @xmath10 with @xmath11     is the centre of mass of the inner binary.,width=264,height=188 ]    now , since the third star is at considerable distance from the inner binary , implying that @xmath12 is small , the inverse distances in equation ( [ potenc1 ] ) can be expressed as : @xmath13 and @xmath14 where @xmath15 are the legendre polynomials and @xmath16 is the angle between the vectors @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "expanding to third order , the perturbation becomes    @xmath19    the first two terms in the above equation come from the quadrupole term ( @xmath20 ) , while the other two come from the octupole term ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "using now the definition of the eccentric vector , i.e. the vector which has the same direction as the radius vector to the pericentre and whose magnitude is equal to the eccentricity of the orbit , we can obtain an expression for the inner eccentricity .",
    "the inner eccentric vector @xmath22 is given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 differentiating equation ( [ ecve ] ) and substituting for @xmath9 ( we neglect the term @xmath26 because , for the applications discussed in this paper , is expected to be small and of @xmath27 ) , we obtain : @xmath28.\\label{roo5}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] now , the jacobi vectors can be represented approximately in polar form as @xmath29 and @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the semi - major axis of the inner orbit , @xmath32 is the mean motion of the inner orbit , @xmath33 , @xmath34 the outer semi - major axis , @xmath35 the outer eccentricity , and @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the true anomaly and longitude of pericentre of the outer orbit . after integrating , the components @xmath38 and @xmath39 of the eccentric vector become ( expanding in powers of @xmath40 and retaining the four leading terms ) :    @xmath41    where @xmath42\\\\ p_{{\\rm x22}}(t ) & = & \\frac{(1+e\\cos{f})^{4}}{(1-e^{2})^{\\frac{3}{2 } } } \\left[\\frac{9}{2}\\cos{(n_{1}t-2f-2\\varpi)}+\\frac{1}{6}\\cos{(3n_{1}t-2f-2\\varpi)}+e[-\\frac{3}{4}\\cos{(n_{1}t - f)}+\\frac{3}{4}\\cos{(n_{1}t+f)}+\\right.\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\left.+\\frac{45}{8}\\cos{(n_{1}t-3f-2\\varpi)}+\\frac{5}{24}\\cos{(3n_{1}t-3f-2\\varpi)}-\\frac{9}{8}\\cos{(n_{1}t - f-2\\varpi)}-\\frac{1}{24}\\cos{(3n_{1}t - f-2\\varpi)}]\\right]\\\\ p_{{\\rm x31}}(t ) & = & ( 1-e^{2})^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\left[\\frac{15}{16}\\cos{(f+\\varpi)}+\\frac{15}{32}e\\cos{(2f+\\varpi)}+e^{2}[\\frac{45}{32}\\cos{(f+\\varpi)}-\\frac{75}{64}\\cos{(f-\\varpi)}+\\frac{5}{64}\\cos{(3f+\\varpi)}]+\\right.\\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\left.e^{3}[\\frac{45}{128}\\cos{(2f-\\varpi)}-\\frac{45}{128}\\cos{(2f+\\varpi)}]+e^{4}[\\frac{5}{32}\\cos{(3f+\\varpi)}-\\frac{5}{32}\\cos{(3f-\\varpi)}]\\right]\\\\ p_{{\\rm x32}}(t ) & = & \\frac{(1+e\\cos{f})^{4}}{(1-e^{2 } ) } [ \\frac{3}{32}\\cos{(2n_{1}t - f-\\varpi)}-\\frac{45}{32}\\cos{(2n_{1}t-3f-3\\varpi)}-\\frac{15}{64}\\cos{(4n_{1}t-3f-3\\varpi)}]\\\\ p_{{\\rm y21}}(t ) & = & ( 1+e\\cos{f})^{3}[-\\frac{1}{2}\\sin{n_{1}t}+\\frac{1}{4}\\sin{(3n_{1}t-2f-2\\varpi)}-\\frac{9}{4}\\sin{(n_{1}t-2f-2\\varpi)}]\\\\ p_{{\\rm y22}}(t ) & = & \\frac{(1+e\\cos{f})^{4}}{(1-e^{2})^{\\frac{3}{2 } } } \\left[-\\frac{9}{2}\\sin{(n_{1}t-2f-2\\varpi)}+\\frac{1}{6}\\sin{(3n_{1}t-2f-2\\varpi)}+e[-\\frac{3}{4}\\sin{(n_{1}t - f)}+\\frac{3}{4}\\sin{(n_{1}t+f)}-\\right.\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\left.-\\frac{45}{8}\\sin{(n_{1}t-3f-2\\varpi)}+\\frac{5}{24}\\sin{(3n_{1}t-3f-2\\varpi)}+\\frac{9}{8}\\sin{(n_{1}t - f-2\\varpi)}-\\frac{1}{24}\\sin{(3n_{1}t - f-2\\varpi)}]\\right]\\\\ p_{{\\rm y31}}(t ) & = & ( 1-e^{2})^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\left[\\frac{15}{16}\\sin{(f+\\varpi)}+\\frac{15}{32}e\\sin{(2f+\\varpi)}+e^{2}[\\frac{45}{32}\\sin{(f+\\varpi)}+\\frac{75}{64}\\sin{(f-\\varpi)}+\\frac{5}{64}\\sin{(3f+\\varpi)}]+\\right.\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\left.+e^{3}[-\\frac{45}{128}\\sin{(2f-\\varpi)}-\\frac{45}{128}\\sin{(2f+\\varpi)}]+e^{4}[\\frac{5}{32}\\sin{(3f+\\varpi)}+\\frac{5}{32}\\sin{(3f-\\varpi)}]\\right]\\\\ p_{{\\rm y32}}(t ) & = & \\frac{(1+e\\cos{f})^{4}}{(1-e^{2})}[\\frac{3}{32}\\sin{(2n_{1}t - f-\\varpi)}+\\frac{45}{32}\\sin{(2n_{1}t-3f-3\\varpi)}-\\frac{15}{64}\\sin{(4n_{1}t-3f-3\\varpi)}]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath43 @xmath44 is the total mass of the system and @xmath45 and @xmath46 are constants of integration . the semi - major axes , mean motions , outer eccentricity and longitude of pericentre were treated as constants in the above calculation .",

    "we also used units such that @xmath88 and @xmath89 and we always started the integrations with @xmath90 . in that system of units , the initial conditions for the numerical integrations were as follows : @xmath91 @xmath92 @xmath93 @xmath94      first we tested the validity of equations ( [ xtot ] ) and ( [ ytot ] ) in the short term . the results are presented in tables 1 and 2 , which give the percentage error between the averaged , over time , numerical and theoretical @xmath95 ( the theoretical eccentricity was obtained by evaluating equations ( [ xtot ] ) and ( [ ytot ] ) everytime we had an output from the symplectic integrator ; both averaged numerical and theoretical eccentricities were calculated by using the trapezium rule ) .",

    "a dash denotes that the analogy among the masses was outside the range @xmath85 .",
    "the integrations were performed over one outer orbital period time span and were done for @xmath104 and @xmath105 . however",

    "the masses of the inner binary also play an important role in that specific issue , as the @xmath21 term is proportional to ( @xmath107 ) and therefore the closer we are in a situation where the inner binary has equal masses the smaller the problem of neglecting terms of @xmath108 in equation ( [ expa ] ) will be .",

    "we have derived a formula which gives an estimate for the inner eccentricity in hierarchical triple systems with eccentric outer binaries and coplanar orbits . the theoretical model appears to work satisfactory for the parameter ranges discussed . in cases with large outer eccentricities and significantly different inner binary masses , due to the approximation of @xmath76 with a series expansion in terms of @xmath35 , the model could be inaccurate , especially for describing short term evolution .",
    "however , for hierarchical triple systems with highly eccentric outer binaries , it appears that the inner eccentricity is dominated by secular evolution , which is not affected by that approximation ( the only effect of that approximation will be on determining the constants of integration @xmath70 and @xmath71 in section [ s2.3 ] ) .",
    "a shorter formula can also be derived by only retaining the @xmath109 and @xmath75 terms in equations ( [ xtot ] ) and ( [ ytot ] ) . as the numerical integrations demonstrated in the previous section",
    ", the omission of those terms did not affect the situation very much . however , the contribution of the @xmath117 and @xmath118 terms is important in cases with significant short period evolution , i.e. small outer eccentricity and strong perturbation to the inner binary .",
    "the theoretical results obtained in the previous sections could be applied in various astronomical and astrophysical topics . as it was stated in the introduction ,",
    "the separation of the components in _ close _ binary systems can play a vital role in their evolution . for instance , the flow of material in a semidetached system can be seriously affected by a small change in the separation of the two stars and therefore it would be useful to have some information about the eccentricity injected into the binary by the third star .",
    "the theory could also be used in observational astronomy , to put constrains on differrent parameters of the observed systems , since there is always some uncertainty in their determination .",
    "for example , the theory could be used to rule whether the orbits of the triple system are coplanar or not , an interesting question which is related to the formation of the system .",
