    "it is well known that inflation elegantly solves the horizon and flatness problems . moreover , inflation accounts for the origin of the large scale structure of the universe .",
    "the point in an inflationary scenario is that the exponential expansion of the universe erases any classical memory , which is often referred to as the cosmic no - hair conjecture .",
    "because of this feature , quantum fluctuations are responsible for the origin of the large scale structure of the universe .",
    "remarkably , the nature of the primordial fluctuations is understood by symmetry in inflation .    * * homogeneity * + first of all , we have to assume the initial homogeneity .",
    "indeed , inflation does not commence with strong inhomogeneous initial conditions ( there is a possibility that this symmetry breaks down  @xcite . ) . *",

    "it is easy to find isometry @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a constant . * * spatial de sitter symmetry * + once inflation occurs , the cosmic no - hair conjecture tells us that the universe will be isotropized in a few hubble expansion .    here , we assumed single field inflation with a standard kinetic term .",
    "the above symmetry determines the nature of primordial fluctuations . in general , we need @xmath6-point correlation functions to characterize the statistical nature of primordial fluctuations .",
    "however , the _ shift symmetry _ in field space implies suppression of nonlinearity and hence the gaussian statistics of fluctuations .",
    "thus , we need only 2-point functions . as an example , we take curvature perturbations @xmath7 . in a fourier space , we have the power spectrum @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the wavenumber vector .",
    "moreover , the _ homogeneity _ constrains the power spectrum to be @xmath10 here , the delta function stems from the  momentum \" conservation .",
    "the _ spatial de sitter symmetry _ further constrains the power spectrum as @xmath11 namely , the direction dependence is forbidden by the rotational symmetry .",
    "finaly , the _ temporal de sitter symmetry _ yields a scale invariant power spectrum @xmath12 because of the scale invariance of spatial coordinates .",
    "these predictions are robust and universal in inflationary scenarios .",
    "in fact , the above predictions have been confirmed by cmb observations  @xcite .    however , precision cosmology forces us to look at fine structure of the primordial fluctuations .",
    "in fact , since the universe is not exactly de sitter , there exists violation of the temporal de sitter symmetry , which leads to a slight tilt of the power spectrum . as the deviation from de sitter expansion",
    "can be characterized by the slow roll parameter , the tilt should be of the order of the slow roll parameter .",
    "similarly , we have violation of the shift symmetry , which leads to non - gaussianity characterized by the slow roll parameter  @xcite . along this line of thought , it is natural to expect violation of the spatial de sitter symmetry , which would lead to the statistical anisotropy .    from the observational point of view , a lot of anomalies indicating the statistical anisotropy are reported although its statistical significance is uncertain ( see @xcite and references therein ) . motivated by those observations , there are many theoretical proposals to realize the statistical anisotropy  @xcite . in these works , however , a consistent theoretical framework including the backreaction of vector fields seems to be obscure . as another line of research ,",
    "there exist challenges to the cosmic no - hair conjecture  @xcite .",
    "if we can evade the cosmic no - hair conjecture , we would have the statistical anisotropy .",

    "recently , however , stable anisotropic inflation models are found in the context of supergravity , which gives rise to a counter example to the cosmic no - hair conjecture  @xcite .    in this review , we explain how anisotropic inflation can be realized in supergravity and show it implies violation of spatial de sitter symmetry and hence leads to the statistical anisotropy in primordial fluctuations .",

    "remarkably , there exists a difference between the anisotropy in curvature and tensor perturbations .",
    "there is also the cross - correlation between the curvature perturbations @xmath7 and gravitational waves @xmath37 given by @xmath38 we find the consistency relations between these observables @xmath39 this allows us to give a model independent test of anisotropic inflation . of course",
