    "with numerous scalar meson states being discovered experimentally , most of efforts have been devoted to a study about their inner structure and how they are classified .",
    "however , much controversy persists regarding the underlying components of them .",
    "currently one of our main concerns is that these scalar particles can whether or not be described consistently in a quark picture .",
    "recently , from a survey of the accumulated experimental data the two possible scenarios are suggested @xcite , where the scalar mesons below and above @xmath4 are assumed to enter their respective nonets in two different ways . in scenario 1 , there are the two scalar nonets formed by the two quark bound states .",
    "one contains , as the lowest lying scalar states , the isoscalars @xmath5 and @xmath6 , isodoublets @xmath7 and @xmath8 and isovector @xmath9 .",
    "the other is made up of the corresponding first excited states : the isoscalars @xmath10 and @xmath11 , isodoublets @xmath12 and @xmath13 and isovector @xmath14 . in scenario 2 , those scalar states below @xmath4 are taken to be the members of a four - quark nonet , while @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are treated as the lowest lying two - quark resonances and arranged into another nonet , with the corresponding first excited states between @xmath17 .",
    "although now we are not able to discriminate among all the existing schemes for the scalar mesons , the above two are intriguing in that they can provide us with a ground to make a systematic study on the scalar mesons .",
    "in such assignment scenarios , an investigation has been made into the related decay constants and light - cone distribution amplitudes ( das)@xcite .",
    "more importantly , to gain insight into the scalar mesons some of the b decays involving them have been explored in the same context . in ref.@xcite ,",
    "the hadronic decays with a scalar final state are discussed in detail in the framework of qcd factorization , important implications being drawn for the properties of the scalar particles .",
    "more attentions are paid to the semileptonic decays with a potential interest @xmath18 .",
    "especially , one shows a great interest in the knowledge of their differential rates , since it is critical , as confronted with the coming experimental observations , for acquiring valuable information on ingredients of the scalar particles .",
    "unfortunately , among the existing approaches no one can afford the task to understand the underlying form factors in the whole regions of @xmath3 , with @xmath19 being the momentum transfers . an effective range of @xmath3 , in which the calculations are believable , has even not been specified in literature , the computations being carried out in just a small or intermediate kinematical region arbitrarily selected .",
    "so the results are less persuasive .",
    "superior to the three - point qcd sum rules in evaluating heavy to light meson transitions , the lcsr approach , which starts with a two - point correlation function , adopts the operator product expansion ( ope ) near the light cone @xmath20 in terms of nonlocal operators , whose matrix elements are parameterized as the hadronic da s of increasing twist .",
    "such that the resulting lcsr for form factors , in addition to having an estimable effective region of @xmath3 , can embody as many long - distance effects as possible involved in the decaying processes .",
    "however , a better understanding of these da s is critical to have the calculation more reliable .",
    "together with the leading twist-2 da , in general , the twist-3 ones enter and play an important role in a lcsr calculation on the form factors . in the case of the scalar mesons , the probe into the twist-2 and",
    "-3 da s has been conducted in the framework of qcd sum rules and a da model , in an expansion form in the gegenbauer polynomials , has been formulated , but with a sizable error in some of the model parameters . to try our best to reduce uncertainty in lcsr calculation from the long distance parameters ,",
    "a practical improvement scenario has been worked out with its validity examined and confirmed , in which a chiral correlator is so chosen that the twist-3 da s make no contribution @xcite . in the present work ,",
    "we intend to apply the same trick to revaluate the semileptonic transitions @xmath21 , in the two quark picture for the scalar mesons .",
    "we will work in the effective regions required by the ope validity and with the two different scenarios aforementioned , and calculation is to be performed at leading order in @xmath2 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the following section , we present the correlation functions with a chiral current and use them to derive the lcsr for the form factors for the @xmath22 transitions . the discussion and comment are made on the important inputs - the da s and decay constants of the scalar mesons , in sec.iii .",
    "sec.vi is devoted to a detailed numerical discussion about the form factors and differential widths for @xmath18 , including a numerical comparison with the estimates of some other approaches .",
    "the final section is reserved for a summary .",
    ".the values of wilson coefficients @xmath24 in the leading logarithmic approximation in standard model , with @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27@xcite . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in the first place , let us make investigation in the context of scenario 1 .",
    "the numerical discussions of the form factors @xmath28 can proceed in terms of the standard procedure for sum rule calculations .",
    "the threshold parameters @xmath29 , which correspond to the masses @xmath30 of the lowest scalar @xmath0 mesons @xcite , need to be estimated in a certain nonperturbative approach . using the qcd sum rule result @xcite for the binding energy difference between the scalar and pseudoscalar b mesons in the heavy quark effective theory",
    ", we could give reasonably @xmath31 , which is smaller than the threshold values in the corresponding conventional sum rule calculations , with the experimental values of the pseudoscalar b mesons .",
    "also , it is possible to determine the threshold parameters in other approaches , among which the scenario suggested in @xcite is more effective . the range of the borel parameter @xmath32 , which is shared by all the sum rules in question , is determined as @xmath33 . in this interval ,",
    "the higher states and continuum contribute less than @xmath34 and the sum rule results vary by @xmath35 around the central values , depending on the decay modes .    to elucidate our findings for the form factors",
    ", we can consider typically the case of the @xmath36 and @xmath37 transitions .",
    "the lcsr for form factors , @xmath38 and @xmath39 , are of a good stability against @xmath32-varying , as shown in fig.[fq0s1 ] . for simplicity , throughout the numerical investigation we give only the central values of the sum rule results , corresponding to @xmath40 and @xmath41",
    ". then we have the observations @xmath42 and @xmath43 . furthermore , use of the relations ( [ eq : f-+ ] ) and ( [ eq : ft+ ] ) leads to @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 . within the lcsr allowed kinematical regions , @xmath47 and @xmath48 as a function of @xmath3 are depicted in fig.[fqs1 ] , along with those corresponding to the other modes .",
    "the behaviors of @xmath49 and @xmath50 are understandable likewise with the relations ( [ eq : f-+ ] ) and ( [ eq : ft+ ] ) .",
    "additionally , for a complete understanding of dynamical behaviors of the @xmath51 transitions at the largest recoils , one can be referred to tab.[tab : fq01 ] and tab.[tab : fq02 ] , where we collect the present lcsr results for the form factors @xmath52 in all the cases and the predictions of other approaches for comparison .",

    "it is manifest that there is a sizable numerical difference in the form factors between the transitions to the ground states and to the excited ones . to make it clear , we go back to the lcsr expressions for the form factors .",
    "we observe that the da s @xmath57 make contribution only in a smaller region of the momentum fraction @xmath58 ranging approximately from @xmath59 at @xmath60 . the light quark from the heavy quark",
    "decays prefers transferring to the region close to its kinematical end - point to build a bound state with the spectator quark of the decaying heavy meson , which is the so - called feynman mechanism , that is , soft - exchanges predominate over hard - ones in the decay process . referring to fig.[da ] , one finds that in that subregion the da s behave quite differently between the scalar objects below and above @xmath61 . for the scalar mesons below @xmath61 , in the whole subregion their da s turn out to be negative and",
    "hence make a constructive contribution to the sum rules .",
    "a different situation manifests itself as scalar mesons involved are heavier ones : the da s contribute constructively in one part of the subrange but do destructively in the other .",
    "that the two effects cancel out to a large degree leads to a form factor in magnitude much smaller than those for the ground states .",
    "physically , this indicates that for a given @xmath3 , as with the former situation the decaying b mesons have a larger energy release in the latter one .    in the same picture the @xmath51 transitions have been explored in the several approaches , such as the pqcd @xcite , qcd sum rules @xcite and lcsr @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to confront our results with some of the previous studies . in what follows , wherever a result of any other approach is referred , it should be understood that we have , if necessary and possible , converted it into that in the present convention .",
    "application of the lcsr is enforced to b decays to a scalar final state by taking the @xmath62 semileptonic processes as a study case in ref.@xcite .",
    "the sum rules for the form factors , with the asymptotic forms used for twist-3 da s , give @xmath63 and @xmath64 subject to an uncertainty estimate omitted here . counting qcd next - to - leading corrections , which is estimated roughly based on the observation of the lcsr calculation for the @xmath65 transitions , the above results are modified to @xmath66 and @xmath67 , about @xmath68 less than our calculations .",
    "the reason for the sizable differences is mainly use of the different inputs for the decay constant @xmath69 .",
    "the different scales are taken for the leading and the subleading twist da s as important inputs , which would have , of course , an impact on accuracy of result . using the same inputs ,",
    "the two evaluations are found to be consistent with each other and that of qcd sum rules .",
    "the pqcd approach predicts , for the decay modes to the scalar ground states , that the form factors are a bit smaller in magnitude but within error comparable with the present calculations , and have the approximately same value as in the case of the first excited states , a result quite other than our predictions .",
    "it is not difficult to understand for heavy - to - light transitions , because the pqcd approach accords with the hard - exchanges mechanism , and the resulting form factors rely on the behaviors of the da of light meson in the whole momentum region accessible for the constitute quarks .",
    "all the approaches mentioned above are no doubt applicable in the kinematical region near the largest recoil for calculation of the from factors .",
    "nevertheless , no decisive region of @xmath3 , in which these approaches work well , has been provided in the existing applications to the @xmath51 transitions . in the lcsr calculation @xcite ,",
    "the form factors are artificially limited to the range @xmath70 , which seem somewhat large against our estimate , and then the results are fitted to a dipole model for having an understanding of the behaviors of the form factors in the whole kinematically accessible region . the same way is adopted in the pqcd calculation @xcite to extrapolate the results for the form factors from small @xmath3 range to large one .",
    "although such a extrapolation manner is phenomenologically extensively assumed , caution should be taken when one applies it to the present case .",
    "first of all , we have no theoretical justification for doing so .",
    "the pole models are believed to be suitable merely for description of those form factors corresponding to @xmath3 near the squared pole masses @xmath71 , however , for the present @xmath51 transitions the @xmath71 are far away from their kinematical regions . on the other hand ,",
    "if the work region for an approach can not be assigned effectively , choosing different fitting regions would lead to different results .",
    "hence , it is questionable to use a pole description to get an all - around understanding of @xmath3 dependence of the form factors for @xmath51 transitions . taking this into account ,",
    "we prefer calculating in the effective regions rather than in the whole kinematical range .",
    "now , we are in a position to look into the differential decay rates for the @xmath51 semileptonic decays , which are expressed as @xmath72,\\label{eq : widthsemi }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath73 , \\label{eq : widthrare}\\]]where @xmath74 denotes the mass of a final state lepton , and @xmath75 \\left| { f_{+}\\left ( q^{2}\\right ) } \\right| ^{2 } + \\left ( 1-r_{s}\\right ) 2{\\rm{re } } [ f_{+ } ( q^{2 } ) f^{\\ast}_{-}(q^2 ) ] + s\\left| f_{-}(q^2)\\right| ^{2}\\big\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in the respective effective regions @xmath76 and @xmath77 , we assess the distributions of the differential rates for the @xmath78 and @xmath79 , with the results displayed in fig.[widthblns1 ] and fig.[widthblls1 ] , where we have set @xmath80 . in the case of @xmath79",
    "there appears a discontinuity at @xmath81 stemming from the function @xmath82 .",
    "the differential decay rates for the @xmath83 are incalculable in the present approach , for the dilepton threshold @xmath84 is beyond our work regions .",
    "it is shown that our calculations and the predictions of pqcd @xcite are comparable with each other , although they are based on two different dynamical schemes .",
    "as the scenario 2 is adopted , an analogous lcsr analysis can be made in principle , however a complete discussion is not practicable at present , due to little knowledge of the 4-quark scalar states below @xmath61 . along the same line as above",
    ", we can assess the semileptonic decays of @xmath0 to a scalar above @xmath61 , which is viewed as a two quark ground state .",
    "the sum rules show the same borel interval as in the case of scenario 1 .",
    "the variations of the form factors @xmath28 with @xmath3 are exhibited in fig.[fqs2 ] , and at the largest recoil , a summary of the numerical results for the form factors involved , including some of the previous estimates , is given in tab.[tab : fq01 ] and tab.[tab : fq02 ] . comparing the sum rule calculations between the scenarios 1 and 2 , we see that in the the latter case the form factors @xmath28 have a central value between @xmath85 in the effective regions , depending on the decay modes , and hence are less sensitive to @xmath3 than in the former case in which there is a large numerical range from @xmath86 .",
    "the present evaluations of @xmath87 , which show a better agreement with the conventional lcsr calculation @xcite , are a bit smaller than the numerical observation in pqcd@xcite , and meanwhile are large numerically in comparison with the calculation of qcd sum rules in both the @xmath88 and @xmath89 situations , especially our result turning out to be about twice as large as that of qcd sum rules in the latter case .    the resulting differential decay rates , as exhibited in fig.[widthblns2 ] and fig.[widthblls2 ] , have a behavior other significantly from what is observed in scenario 1 , with the remarkably different qcd dynamics embedded in the form factors between the two scenarios .",
    "once these scalar mesons above @xmath61 are clearly identified to be , purely or mainly , the two quark bound state , this result might help to distinguish between both the pictures for them , as the future experiments become accessible .",
    "in addition , the distribution shapes , which are demonstrated by the differential rates for @xmath90 in fig.[widthblns2 ] , are compatible with the lcsr calculation .",
    "the decays to the scalar meson below @xmath61 , despite theoretically little accessible for the moment , could be discussed qualitatively . in the four quark final states",
    "there is a quark - antiquark component from the annihilations of emitted gluons in the decaying processes , which gets the transitions highly suppressed .",
    "consequently we may deduce that in scenario 2 the related form factors are of a small numerical value with respect to the results in the two quark picture .",
    "finally , we should point out that all the above discussions can not be generalized to @xmath91 decays to a scalar meson , because of the fact that the decaying mesons have a recoil energy not large enough to make lcsr applicable , in their decaying processes .",
    "we have presented a lcsr computation on @xmath92 at leading order in @xmath2 , in the two quark picture for the scalar mesons with the two different scenarios . a correlation function with chiral current operator is chosen such that the resulting lcsr the form factors can avoid the pollution with the twist-3 da s of the scalar mesons .",
    "applicable regions of the lcsr approach are discussed and are assigned reasonably as @xmath93 and @xmath94 , for the scalar final states below and above @xmath61 , respectively . also , we investigate the properties of the da s of the scalar mesons , obtaining an observable difference from the case of the pseudoscalar mesons . in the effective regions , the form factors and differential",
    "decay rates are estimated , with the main findings summarized as the following : ( 1 ) there exist the relations among the the form factors for the @xmath51 transitions , which are in accordance with the prediction of scet .",
    "( 2 ) for the decays to a scalar ground state , in the case of scenario 1 the form factors at @xmath60 show the numerical result much larger those for the first excited sates , and as confronted with the corresponding observations in scenario 2 , the former seem large in magnitude , but the latter are predicted to be small .",
    "( 3 ) for the semileptonic processes with the scalar final state above @xmath95 , the resulting differential decay rates have a significantly different behavior for the different scenarios .",
    "some of them might be beneficial to experimentally identify physical natures of the scalar mesons .",
    "the present results might be improved as the qcd radiative corrections are taken into account , and however they are not expected to change too much from the lcsr calculation on the @xmath65 transition@xcite .",
