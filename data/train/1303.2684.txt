    "theories containing fermion and boson such as the yukawa model , quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) , and especially quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) suggest that the plasmas described by these theories including qed plasma and the quark - gluon plasma  @xcite at so high temperature ( @xmath2 ) that the particle masses are negligible are multi - scale systems .",
    "for example , the average inter - particle distance is of order @xmath5 , the debye screening length , @xmath6 ( @xmath1 : coupling constant )  @xcite , and the mean free path of the quark and the gluon , @xmath7  @xcite , respectively .",
    "these momentum scales , @xmath2 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 , are called hard , soft , ultrasoft , respectively . due to the existence of these multiple scales , analyzing the spectral properties of collective excitations at finite temperature in these fermion - boson systems is a quite nontrivial task even at weak coupling ( @xmath10 ) regime in general . in the soft scale ,",
    "the well - established perturbation theory known as the hard thermal loop ( htl ) approximation  @xcite is applicable , and the analysis using that approximation suggests the existence of the plasmon  @xcite , which is a bosonic excitation and well - known in nonrelativistic plasma .",
    "in addition to the bosonic excitation , a fermionic excitation called plasmino  @xcite is also suggested to exist , owing to the fact that the particle masses are negligible compared with @xmath2 . by contrast , the htl approximation can not be used in the ultrasoft scale due to an infrared singularity known as pinch singularity , and thus a novel resummed perturbation theory , which regularizes the singularity , needs to be developed to obtain the correct leading - order result  @xcite . due to the same reason ,",
    "the resummed perturbation theory is also necessary in the calculation of the bosonic propagator  @xcite and the transport coefficient  @xcite .",
    "the analysis using the resummed perturbation revealed the existence of a novel quark excitation ( ultrasoft fermion mode ) whose momentum is ultrasoft  @xcite in addition to the plasmino  @xcite , and the expression of the pole position and the strength of that excitation was obtained by solving the self - consistent equation derived in the resummed perturbation , in the yukawa model and qed  @xcite .",
    "we note that results which suggest the existence of the ultrasoft fermion mode were also obtained by other analyses , in which the schwinger - dyson equation  @xcite , the nambu - jona - lasino model  @xcite , and effective models in which the boson has finite bare mass  @xcite are used . on the other hand , in qcd , the self - consistent equation has not been solved , and thus the expressions of the pole position and the strength of the ultrasoft fermion mode have not been obtained . in this paper",
    ", we extend the analysis in the yukawa model and qed  @xcite to qcd , and obtain the expression of the pole position and the strength of that excitation .",
    "now we introduce another point of view : each perturbation scheme is equivalent to different kinetic equation near equilibrium . in fact , the htl analysis of the soft boson ( fermion ) propagator is equivalent to the usual ( generalized ) collisionless kinetic equation called ( generalized ) vlasov equation  @xcite . here",
    "the generalized vlasov equation means the collisionless kinetic equation in which there is a fermionic background field in place of bosonic one , in contrast to the usual vlasov equation case . on the other hand",
    ", it was shown that the resummation scheme used in the analysis of the gluon propagator whose momentum is ultrasoft , is equivalent to the boltzmann equation  @xcite .",
    "it reflects the fact that the interaction among the particles can not be neglected when the space - time scale is comparable with or much larger than the mean free path , which is of order @xmath7 in the case of the hard quark and gluon  @xcite .",
    "we note that this discussion explains the reason why the resummed perturbation , which takes into account the interaction effect among the hard particles , is necessary in the analysis of the ultrasoft momentum region . the resummaton scheme used in the analysis of the ultrasoft fermion propagator  @xcite",
    "is also interpreted as a generalized version of the boltzmann equation ( gbe ) near equilibrium in the case of the yukawa model and qed  @xcite . in this paper , we derive the gbe that is equivalent to the self - consistent equation derived in the resummed perturbation  @xcite in qcd .    the aim of this paper is twofold : one is to obtain the expression of the dispersion relation , the damping rate , and the strength of the ultrasoft fermion mode in qcd . the other is , to derive the gbe that is equivalent to the self - consistent equation obtained in the resummed perturbation  @xcite from the kadanoff - baym equation  @xcite in qcd .",
    "the derivation helps us to establish the foundation of the resummed perturbation scheme  @xcite , and to obtain the kinetic interpretation of the procedure of that scheme . as a by - product",
    ", the derivation using the kadanoff - baym equation enables us to evaluate also the nonlinear response that is caused by the average gluon field , not only the linear response caused by the quark average field  @xcite . due to this merit",
    ", we can analyze the @xmath3-point function whose external lines are @xmath4 ultrasoft gluons and a pair of ultrasoft quark , not only the ultrasoft quark propagator . this paper is an generalization of ref .",
    "@xcite , from the yukawa model and qed to qcd , and also an extension of ref .",
    "@xcite , from the gluon propagator to the quark propagator . since there is self - coupling of the gluon and the color structure of the off - diagonal propagator , which is an important quantity in our analysis and will be introduced later , is complicated in general in qcd , the extension to qcd is nontrivial and thus it deserves a paper .",
