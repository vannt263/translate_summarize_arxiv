    "we are building a deep multi - wavelength picture of the sky in the swire spitzer deep field , 1046 + 59 , which was chosen to be ideal for deep radio imaging . in paper",
    "i we discussed the 20 cm continuum survey .",
    "the present 90 cm survey allows us to study the radio spectra of the general source population . for jansky and mjy sources ,",
    "very steep radio spectra often are associated with very high redshifts , although the physical origin of this effect remains unclear ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . a large population of very steep spectrum",
    ", @xmath6jy sources might suggest a corresponding high redshift @xmath6jy population . on the other hand , flatter radio spectra",
    "are often thought to be connected with synchrotron self - absorption or free - free absorption , although other mechanisms could potentially produce such spectra . combined with other information",
    "the low frequency spectral energy distribution has the potential to give us unique insight on the physics of black - hole - driven agn and star - forming galaxies . in this paper",
    "we report our 90 cm observations with the vla and some analysis of these radio data combined with our 20 cm survey of the same field from paper i. in future papers in this series , we will combine these data with redshift measurements and observations at other wavelengths .",
    "observations were made of a single pointing center position , 10@xmath146@xmath200@xmath3 , 590100  ( j2000 ) , with the vla in a and c configurations for a total of almost 85 hours on - source between february 2006 and january 2007 .",
    "however , due to the ongoing evla upgrade , only 22 working antennas were typically available in a and 18 in c. thus the total integration time was equivalent to @xmath1263 hours in a and @xmath125 in c , with correspondingly less @xmath13 coverage . in table  [ or ] , we summarize the parameters of the observing runs . since the total time is dominated by the a configuration , the final image for analysis had a resolution @xmath14and fwhm fov of 2.3 .",
    "the data were all taken in spectral - line mode 4 using on - line hanning smoothing , resulting in fifteen 390.625 khz channels in each of 2 ifs ( centered at 321.5 and 327.5 mhz ) and each of two polarizations .",
    "five second integration times were used in the a configuration and 10 seconds in c. the integration times and channel bandwidths were chosen to minimize tangential and radial smearing of the images away from the field center .",
    "this combination of parameters produces the best compromise for imaging sensitivity and quality possible with the current vla correlator , which dates from the 1970 s .",
    "the finite bandwidth of the spectral channels still produces some radial smearing of the image away from the field center which we take into account in the analysis of the image .      for calibration , editing , and imaging a procedure similar to the one described in paper",
    "i was used .",
    "the baars flux density scale @xcite was adopted using 3c286 as the flux calibrator .",
    "two of the 15 channels in each if were deleted due to interference which is generated by the vla itself and which should disappear when the evla is completed .",
    "unless otherwise stated , the aips package @xcite was used to reduce these data .",
    "a faceted , low resolution image ( 90  clean beam ) with a radius of 15 degrees was made to find interfering sources far from the area of interest .",
    "facets centered on all very bright nvss sources ( @xmath15 jy ) out to 100 degrees from the field center were also included in this exploratory image . from this search 288 facets , each with @xmath16 pixels , were chosen to cover a central region 93  in radius and all the other bright sources found in the low resolution search .",
    "the facets were defined using the task setfc which creates a set of overlapping circular regions within the square facets to cover the entire desired field . then imagr was used to deconvolve all the facets together , using the standard cotton - schwab - clark clean algorithm @xcite .",
    "the cell size for the final image is 2  and the clean beam size is @xmath17@xmath18  pa@xmath19 .",
    "clean images from the first day of the observations were then used as fiducial models for each of the other days .",
    "phase and amplitude calibrations were made of each of the other days using the clean components from the first day images .",
    "the a configuration data for each if and polarization were then combined into a smaller , averaged dataset using stuffr and images for the full datasets were made .",
    "the c configuration data were also calibrated using the full a configuration images .",
    "the a and c datasets were then combined using dbcon and images were made separately for each if and polarization .    after making these images",
    "there remained some significant residual structures in the central two degrees of the image due to bright sources located outside the central region .",
    "these residuals are likely due to 1 ) differences in the primary beam patterns from antenna to antenna due to the very simple dipole feeds used on the vla and 2 ) the rotation with parallactic angle of the sensitivity pattern on the sky during the synthesis . for bright sources in the outskirts of the field",
    ", these variations in sensitivity produce local gain variations which are not taken into account in the imaging and self - calibration process . in order to deal with this type of error , an aips procedure , peelr ,",
    "was developed and made generally available in the aips package . in peelr",
    "the best clean model is subtracted from the self - calibrated _ uv _ data , except for the facet containing the bright source responsible for the residuals .",
    "these mostly residual data are then self - calibrated as a function of time using only the model for the bright source .",
    "this process allows the variations in gain due to the actual primary beam of each antenna to be tracked in time .",
    "this local complex calibration is then applied to the mostly residual data and the model for the bright source subtracted from the locally calibrated result .",
    "this operation removes , as accurately as possible , the contribution of the offending source .",
    "the inverse of the local calibration is applied to the resulting fully residual data and the full clean model added back to the _ uv _ database .",
    "if there are several offending sources , this process can be repeated for each source as it was in the present case . when the `` peeled '' dataset is then imaged , the effects of the offending outlying sources are significantly reduced .",
    "techniques like this one have been used by others , but only by combining several different steps and perhaps not quite in the same way as described here .",
    "the resulting images still showed radial smearing for bright sources in excess of what is expected from the finite bandwidths . to explore these errors we subtracted the clean component model from each visibility dataset and made spectral line image cubes from the residual visibilities . for facets containing bright sources far from the field center , these images showed frequency - dependent artifacts which are likely due to the different slopes of the bandpass across each spectral channel .",
    "this instrumental problem causes the effective observing frequency for each channel to be slightly different than is assumed and thus the @xmath20 coordinate for each channel used in the imaging to be slightly in error . as a consequence ,",
    "the source image in each channel is slightly mis - registered , producing a radial smearing for very bright sources far from the field center . to remove the error pattern due to this effect we cleaned the spectral residual image cubes in facets containing bright , outlying sources and subtracted the resulting clean components from the corresponding visibility data .",
    "this reduced the error pattern significantly .",
    "the resulting four sets of 288 facets were then made into single images using flatn .",
    "finally a weighted average of the four images was made , weighting by the 1/rms@xmath21 , as determined from the imean fit to the pixel histogram .",
    "this final image still showed a weak , large - scale error pattern due to the imperfections of the corrections described above .",
    "for the final image used for most of the analysis , the aips program mwflt was used to calculate the `` mode '' of the image over an @xmath22 support window and the result was subtracted from the image . for sources approaching this scale size the image before mwflt was used for analysis but for the vast majority of the sources the mwflt image was used .",
    "the rms noise near the center of the final image is @xmath23jy beam@xmath24 making it one of the most sensitive surveys to date made at such a long wavelength .",
    "the corresponding value for the 20 cm image discussed in paper i is much lower , @xmath25jy beam@xmath24 . for a spectral index ,",
    "@xmath26 the ratio of flux densities between 90 cm and 20 cm is @xmath27 .",
    "thus the effective sensitivity difference in the field center is about one order of magnitude .",
    "however the resolution for the full sensitivity image is about @xmath28 worse at 90 cm than at 20 cm .",
    "also the primary beam at 90 cm is about @xmath28 wider . since",
    ", many of the sources are resolved at 20 cm and because most are more than a few arcminutes from the field center , the sensitivity difference is not as large as at the field center and can be better at 90 cm than at 20 cm very far from the field center . thus in comparing the two surveys we need to keep in mind the local properties of each source in the image of interest at each wavelength .",
    "although the primary beam has a diameter of 2.3  and the region we imaged extends out far beyond this limit , we chose to catalog the region within 1  of the field center .",
    "this two - degree diameter field - of - view covers more than the entire field we are studying at other wavelengths .",
    "moreover , the primary beam shape becomes less well known beyond one degree and the smearing due to the finite channel width begins to become important beyond this radius .",
    "as with the 20 cm survey we include the radial smearing due to the finite bandwidth in our gaussian fits . in the present case",
    "the angular fwhm of the radial smearing function is approximately @xmath29 ( the distance from the field center ) . in the worst case , for a point source at the",
    "maximum cataloged radius from the field center , this bandwidth smearing amounts to a decrease in the peak brightness at full resolution of @xmath30% . as for the 20 cm survey",
    ", we convolved our @xmath14images to resolutions of 12  and 24  to increase the detection sensitivity for large sources .",
    "this exercise was much less important than it was for the 20 cm survey , but it did yield higher s / n detections for a subset of the survey .",
    "as for the 20 cm survey , the aips program sad was used for forming the initial source lists .",
    "a catalog for each resolution was formed down to a peak signal / noise ( s / n ) of 4.5 . the residual images from sad were then searched to find any remaining sources missed by the program with a s / n greater than 5.0 . for sources with a s",
    "/ n close to 5.0 , the fitting process was repeated by hand with jmfit , using the local rms estimate over a region 100 pixels in diameter . in this way a reliable list of sources with s / n of 5.0 or greater at each resolution was compiled . for both sad and jmfit ,",
    "the smearing due to the finite bandwidth was included in the fitting process .",
    "as described for the 20 cm survey in paper i , the best description of each of the sources with a peak s / n@xmath31 at one of the resolutions analyzed was included in the final 90 cm catalog . in order to allow for a variety of potential calibration errors ,",
    "a 3% error term proportional to the total measured flux density of each source was folded into the errors in quadrature , as was done for the 20 cm survey .",
    "in table  [ s90 ] , we give the first ten lines of the radio catalog ; the full table is provided electronically .",
    "column ( 1 ) contains the source number .",
    "if the source has a number less than 3000 , then it was found with a s / n @xmath32 from running sad on the full resolution image .",
    "sources with numbers @xmath33 were found in lower resolution images or in checks of the residual images .",
    "numbers beginning with 12 were measured on a 12  resolution image .",
    "if the number begins with 24 then we used a 24  resolution image .",
    "the lower resolution fits were used in the table when they indicated a significantly larger total flux density for the source in question .",
    "each of these cases was also investigated by eye to confirm the result .",
    "columns ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) contain the radio ra and dec along with the estimated error .",
    "column ( 4 ) contains the corrected peak flux density from the map in @xmath6jy per beam . in column",
    "( 5 ) we list the corrected total flux density . in column ( 6 ) we give the estimated error in the total flux density . column ( 7 ) contains the peak s / n . the error for column ( 4 )",
    "can be recovered by dividing column ( 4 ) by column ( 7 ) .",
    "we give the s /",
    "n as opposed to the error since the s / n was used to define the catalog cutoff and later is used in the calculation of log n- log s. in column ( 8) , we give the best fit deconvolved size in arcseconds . if a resolved two dimensional gaussian was the best fit , we give the major and minor axis size ( fwhm ) and the position angle .",
    "upper limits are given for sources which were unresolved based on the results of jmfit or sad .",
    "when the minor axis is unresolved , we give `` 0 '' as the minor axis size in the table and assume a one - dimensional gaussian size when estimating the total flux density .",
    "sources with very large sizes , for which only a largest angular size is given in column ( 8) , sizes and total flux densities were estimated directly from the images using the aips routines , imval and tvstat .",
    "the 90 cm catalog covers a larger area than the 20 cm survey but at a significantly lower sensitivity .",
    "this means that the 90 cm survey samples sources in a higher range in 20 cm flux density with different properties in angular size and absolute radio luminosity than our 20 cm survey . in figure  [ af90 ]",
    "we show the median angular size  90 cm flux density distribution . above 3 mjy",
    "we resolve most of the sources but below 3mjy most of the sources are relatively small . our 20 cm results for the same sources reported in paper i show that the typical median size is @xmath34  .",
    "this trend in the measured median sizes at 90 cm is shown in table  [ sss ] and figure  [ mf90 ] .",
    "although similar resolution data have not been reported at 90 cm these results are also consistent with previous results at higher frequencies , extrapolated to 90 cm @xcite .",
    "some of the 90 cm sources have larger sizes than the corresponding 20 cm counterparts .",
    "for these sources we checked the flux densities and sizes at 20 cm by smoothing to the resolution of the 90 cm detection images . for most of these sources the lower resolution 20 cm sizes and flux densities agree well with the fits at the original resolution . the total flux density changed by more than 10% for only three individually cataloged 20 cm sources ( 00061 , 01186 and 01193 ) . in making the 20 cm catalog , the larger flux densities at lower resolution",
    "were rejected because the s / n was significantly higher on higher resolution images which fitted smaller sizes .",
    "the 90 cm survey is also more sensitive to smaller spatial frequencies and any steeper spectrum , more extended emission .",
    "while these results do not change any of the conclusions in paper i , we are likely a little incomplete for the largest sources at 20 cm , especially near the bottom of the catalog . for the spectral index analysis below we have used the 20 cm fits from imaging at 90 cm resolution .        for our spectral index analysis",
    "we restrict ourselves to sources within 20  of the field center . at that radius",
    "we are complete at 20 cm and beyond that distance from the field center the uncertainty due to the primary beam correction at 20 cm becomes significant .",
    "since the 20 cm image is so deep , almost all the 90 cm sources within 20  of the field center have counterparts which we can use to determine spectral indices .",
    "two 90 cm sources ( 01492 and 01501 ) were detected on the 20 cm 6  resolution image only with @xmath35 .",
    "three more sources ( 00766 @xmath36 , 01346 @xmath37 and 01491 @xmath38 ) have no 20 cm counterpart with a @xmath39 . however , these three sources all have low 90 cm s /",
    "n detections , @xmath40 , and have no counterparts on our deep optical / nir images @xcite or our deep 50 cm gmrt image @xcite .",
    "these sources either have very steep spectra and are very distant or they are spurious .",
    "we choose to leave them out of the following discussion but note that there may be a small , very steep spectrum tail to the distribution .    in most other cases , the positions and sizes of individual sources in 20 cm and 90 cm catalogs agree",
    "well with one another and the spectral index is calculated from the values listed in the respective tables . in cases",
    "where the cataloged 20 cm and 90 cm parameters do not agree well in size and/or position the sources were investigated on the respective 20 cm and 90 cm images by eye .",
    "when more than one 20 cm source corresponds to a 90 cm source the flux densities of the 20 cm sources were summed . if only the 90 cm source is apparently resolved but the 20 cm source size implies that the 90 cm source should be unresolved , then the peak flux on the highest resolution 90 cm image and the total 20 cm flux density were used to calculate the spectral index ( e.g. 90 cm source 00727 ) . if both the 20 cm and 90 cm source are resolved then the peak flux density at both 20 cm and 90 cm is used from images at the resolution of the cataloged 90 cm source ( e.g. 90 cm source 12407 ) . in table",
    "[ si90 ] we give the first ten lines of the electronic table summarizing the 90cm - selected spectral indices , including 90 cm source 00727 and 12407 discussed above . if we needed",
    "to sum more than one 20 cm flux density , then we give the total in column 5 .",
    "otherwise we give the cataloged total flux densities but indicate with a note the few cases where discrepant size estimates drive us to use peak flux densities for the corresponding spectral index estimate .    figure  [ sp90 ]",
    "contains the observed histogram of 90 to 20 cm spectral indices ( @xmath41 ) for sources detected above 5 sigma at 90 cm . in table  [ sis90 ] we summarize the statistics for these sources as a function of 90 cm flux density and size .",
    "the mean and median spectral indices are @xmath42 for all of our subsets .",
    "this value is flatter than the mean 408 - 1407 mhz spectral index of 0.92 from 5c12 for sources detected at 408 mhz above 40 mjy @xcite .",
    "we have only a few sources with 90 cm flux densities @xmath43 mjy in our 90 cm survey , so our results are consistent with a flattening in the mean spectral index below the 5c12 characteristic flux density .",
    "the deeper lbds 327 mhz survey has a 90cm - selected , 327 - 1462 mhz median spectral index shifting from @xmath44 above 100 mjy , to @xmath45 between 10 and 100 mjy , and then down to @xmath46 between 3.6 and 10 mjy @xcite .",
    "we agree with their estimate in the @xmath47 mjy range but do not find the flatter median spectral index below 10 mjy near the bottom of the lbds survey .",
    "most recent work on deep fields involves surveys at 20 cm , so it is also interesting to study the spectral index distribution when selecting the sources at 20 cm .",
    "since most of the 20 cm sources are not detected directly at 90 cm , we must use a combination of a high 20 cm flux density cutoff to study the stronger 20 cm sources individually and stacking subsets at 90 cm in order to study the fainter 20 cm population .",
    "most of the weaker sources are much smaller than the size of the synthesized beam of our 90 cm survey ( see paper i ) .",
    "those sources that are expected to be unresolved at 90 cm are suitable for stacking analysis .",
    "for the high flux density subset , we select only 20 cm sources with total flux densities @xmath48jy from paper i within 20  of the field center . in table",
    "[ si20 ] we show the first 10 lines of the electronic table of the 90cm20 cm spectral indices for these sources . in figure  [ sp20 ]",
    "we plot the histogram of the spectral indices of these sources against their 20 cm flux densities .",
    "since , in this subset of sources , many of the sources are not detected above 3 sigma at 90 cm , we plot the blue area for sources detected above 3 sigma while the red area represents the 3 sigma upper limit corrected for the observed 20 cm source size .",
    "the median spectral index is 0.52(0.04 ) including the upper limits , significantly flatter than the 90 cm selected sample and samples with brighter limiting flux densities selected at 20 cm . in figure  [ sp20f ] we show spectral index plotted against the 20 cm flux density for sources with @xmath49jy .",
    "this plot shows the sources with 90 cm upper limits as red circles clearly delineating the section of the plot which is not allowed due to the 90 cm sensitivity .",
    "even with this high limit on the 20 cm catalog , 37% of the sources with @xmath50jy@xmath51jy have upper limits at 90 cm ; thus we can not determine the details of the dependence of the spectral index distribution on 20 cm flux density for @xmath52 mjy from the properties of individual sources .    in order to study the spectral index distribution down to the bottom of the 20 cm catalog , we need to use stacking on the 90 cm image . since we need to restrict the stacks to angular sizes which are effectively unresolved , we omit a modest , but significant number of sources that are resolved by the 90 cm synthesized beam . in the following discussion , we divide the sources into subsets by ranges of 20 cm flux density and also split the subsets into sources which are @xmath53  and @xmath54 . in paper",
    "i we found that sources with @xmath55 mjy have a median size of @xmath56 , unlike the stronger sources individually detected at 90 cm .",
    "if we omit from the stacking analysis the @xmath57% of sources with @xmath55 mjy that have sizes @xmath58  , we expect that the spectral properties of the @xmath59subsets should be close to those of the full population . in stacking each subsample with flux densities at 20 cm @xmath60mjy ,",
    "we extract the observed 90 cm brightness in @xmath6jy / beam at the position of the 20 cm source . for small sources this should be a good estimate of the total flux density in @xmath6jy . within the subset , we then calculate the mean and median flux densities at both frequencies . the spectral index computed from the two mean flux densities and that computed from the two median flux densities",
    "are listed for each subset in the bottom six lines of table  [ sis20 ] .",
    "the errors in table  [ sis20 ] are calculated assuming counting statistics from the total number in each subset , combined in quadrature with an assumed standard deviation for the population of spectral indices of 0.30 which seems appropriate based on the higher flux density , 90cm - selected , spectral indices but is only an educated guess .    for sources stronger than 1 mjy at 20 cm , all except one",
    "have a detection at 90 cm . excluding this source",
    "we can calculate the median and mean spectral index for subsets selected by source flux density and size and these are listed in table  [ sis20 ] . in figure  [ siall ]",
    "we summarize the results graphically . above 1 mjy , where we can study both size subsets ,",
    "the more resolved sources have steeper spectra than the @xmath54  subset .",
    "the mean and median spectral indices continue to flatten for the full population . for the small sources , the median and mean spectral indices flatten to @xmath61 .",
    "below 1 mjy the small source medians and means continue to be in the range @xmath61 , but with a clear trend to steeper spectra at the lowest flux densities in the 20 cm sample .",
    "the results for the spectral indices are quite different depending on whether we select the samples at 90 cm or 20 cm . at 90 cm",
    "we find very constant mean and median spectral index of @xmath42 down to the survey limit of @xmath62jy .",
    "no obvious dependence is found on angular size .",
    "approximately the same result is found in the 90 cm selected sample down to 1 mjy at 20 cm which would correspond to @xmath63 mjy at 90 cm with a spectral index @xmath42 .",
    "however , sources @xmath58  in size tend to have steeper spectra than those @xmath54",
    ". below 1 mjy at 20 cm , many more sources do not have detections than would be expected if the @xmath42 spectral index continued .",
    "for these and weaker sources , we are forced to consider only small sources since the surface brightness sensitivity at 90 cm is not high enough to detect sources of all angular sizes . for this population of small sources ,",
    "we find much flatter median and mean spectral indices , @xmath61 .",
    "this result suggests that there is a smaller size , 20 cm source population which is attenuated enough at 90 cm , relative to an @xmath64 , to affect the median source properties relative to a 90cm - selected population .",
    "the calculation of the 90 cm log n - log s is much easier than for 20 cm in paper i because 1 ) we only consider a radius of one degree which does nt reach the half power point of the primary beam and 2 ) the synthesized beam is bigger , @xmath65  so fewer sources are resolved , and 3 ) the fractional channel bandwidth is smaller .",
    "the these parameters dramatically reduce the problems we faced in paper i and allow us to perform a simpler analysis . only below 1",
    "mjy is the incompleteness due to source size an issue . for weak sources we use the same formalism as in paper i to account for missing sources due to resolution and bandwidth smearing and the same assumed source size distribution . even for the weaker sources ,",
    "since the resolution is lower , the impact of these corrections is very small . in table",
    "[ counts ] , we summarize our results for the 5 sigma catalog only , unlike paper i where we performed a more complicated calculation with a variable @xmath66 cutoff .    in figure  [ logns ]",
    ", we plot our results along with the 327 mhz results for lbds @xcite for their 5 sigma catalog and the 5c12 results from 408 mhz scaled by their quoted mean spectral index of 0.9 to 324.5 mhz @xcite .",
    "the results are in general agreement and our additions show that we have reached the flat region of the counts seen at other frequencies near 3 mjy .",
    "this change in slope also corresponds roughly to the minimum in the spectral index distribution seen in figure  [ siall ] .",
    "these data fill out the picture of the meter - wavelength radio sky a bit more clearly , building on the earlier work cited above , but also raise new questions . instead of finding a large steep spectrum population , we find flatter spectra for the subset of sources with angular sizes @xmath67and @xmath9mjy .",
    "we also find that the differential log n - log s at 90 cm flattens in roughly the same flux density range ( @xmath68 mjy ) .",
    "thus the nature of the meter wavelength population seems to be changing in the few mjy range .",
    "often a trend toward flattening radio spectra at higher frequencies and the corresponding change in slope of log n - log s is attributed to star - forming galaxies becoming dominant ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "only for 20 cm luminosities @xmath69 w hz@xmath24 are star - forming galaxies more common than agn ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "for sources with @xmath70mjy ( equivalent to @xmath71mjy with @xmath72 ) to have a 20 cm luminosity @xmath73 w hz@xmath24 , their redshift would have to be @xmath74 .",
    "this redshift is much too low for most such mjy sources to be dominated by star - formation , since we find a median @xmath11 for our sample @xcite .",
    "thus it seems likely that the changes we are observing are in the agn population .",
    "furthermore , spectral studies at wavelengths @xmath75 cm , show that the typical @xmath6jy source has a quite steep spectrum , @xmath76 @xcite . therefore our 20cm - selected @xmath6jy sources with flatter spectra can not be due to free - free emission , since the flat spectrum free - free emission should be less important at longer wavelengths",
    ".    one might think that flatter spectra in agn might be due to synchrotron self - absorption as is seen in many beamed radio galaxies and quasars .",
    "however , our work in paper i and other studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) show that the typical sizes for these sources are @xmath121 .",
    "this argues against synchrotron self - absorption being dominant since that mechanism requires sizes @xmath77 milliarcsecond to be important .",
    "one possibility is that the flatter spectra could result from the combination of a relatively flat - spectrum agn jet with a spectral index @xmath78 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and a synchrotron self - absorbed core .    since the sources are relatively small , free - free absorption is a possibility .",
    "free - free absorption for such sources depends in general on the details of the clumpiness of the absorbing thermal gas and its geometric relation to the synchrotron emitting medium . in star - forming systems which have been well studied ,",
    "the radio emission is extended more uniformly throughout the galaxy than the dust or the hii regions @xcite .",
    "free - free absorption is also seen on small scales in some radio agn ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "for a uniform density foreground medium with a temperature @xmath79k , the characteristic free - free absorption turnover frequency is @xmath80(mhz)@xmath81(@xmath82)@xmath83(pc ) , where @xmath84 is the projected pathlength .",
    "for example , for a typical source in our sample with a size of 1at @xmath11 , a typical radius is @xmath85 kpc and , for a rest frame turnover frequency of @xmath86 mhz , one needs a density of 10 @xmath82 , which would correspond to a mass of @xmath87 @xmath88 if uniformly distributed in a sphere .",
    "a more realistic model with a smaller filling factor and a different geometry reduces the mass estimates but if free - free absorption is important then a reasonably large mass of ionized gas must be involved .",
    "the flattening could also be due to ionization losses as has been suggested for some star - forming galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in any case",
    ", the flatter spectra and the flatter counts observed below 3 mjy suggest a change in the nature of the population below this flux density level which is not well understood .",
    "we will discuss this point further in future papers where we add redshifts and data from other wavelengths to the analysis .",
    "we have presented a very sensitive 90 cm image of the swire deep field .",
    "this image combined with our uniquely sensitive 20 cm image of this field allows us to study the meter wavelength spectral indices as a function of flux density for the @xmath6jy radio population . for 90cm - selected sources the properties of the sources are consistent with previous work with a mean spectral index near 0.7 and few very steep spectrum sources .",
    "thus no large population of very steep spectrum @xmath6jy sources seems to exist down to our limiting flux density .    for the subset of sources selected at 20 cm with sizes @xmath8   ( which contains about @xmath89% of all 20cm - selected sources @xmath90 mjy ) , the mean and median spectral indices flatten from @xmath91 to @xmath92 below 10 mjy with a trend toward steeper spectra at the lowest flux densities .",
    "the 90 cm log n - log s counts flatten below 5 mjy as they do at corresponding low flux densities at higher frequencies .",
    "the change in the source properties at a few mjy is not well understood but probably involves the agn population , not primarily star - formation - dominated galaxies .",
