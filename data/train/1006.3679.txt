    "the task of partitioning a natural image into regions with homogeneous texture , commonly referred to as _ image segmentation _",
    ", is widely accepted as a crucial function for high - level image understanding , significantly reducing the complexity of content analysis of images .",
    "image segmentation and its higher - level applications are largely designed to emulate functionalities of human visual perception ( e.g. , in object recognition and scene understanding ) .",
    "dominant criteria for measuring segmentation performance are based on qualitative and quantitative comparisons with human segmentation results . in the literature",
    ", investigators have explored several important models and principles that can lead to good image segmentation :    1 .",
    "different texture regions of a natural image admit a mixture model .",
    "for example , multiscale normalized cuts ( mnc ) by @xcite and f&h by @xcite formulate the segmentation as a graph - cut problem , while mean shift ( ms ) by @xcite seeks a partition of a color image based on different modes within the estimated empirical distribution .",
    "region contours / edges convey important information about the saliency of the objects in the image and their shapes ( see @xcite ) .",
    "several recent methods have been proposed to combine the cues of homogeneous color and texture with the cue of contours in the segmentation process , including @xcite .",
    "3 .   the properties of local features ( including texture and edges ) usually do not share the same level of homogeneity at the same spatial scale .",
    "thus , salient image regions can only be extracted from a hierarchy of image features under multiple scales ( see @xcite ) .",
    "despite much work in this area , good image segmentation remains elusive to obtain for practitioners , mainly for the following two reasons : first , there is little consensus on what criteria should be used to evaluate the quality of image segmentations .",
    "it is difficult to strike a good balance between objective measures that depend solely on the intrinsic statistics of imagery data and subjective measures that try to empirically mimic human perception .",
    "second , in the search for objective measures , there has been a lack of consensus on good models for a unified representation of image segments including both their textures and contours .",
    "recently , an _ objective _ metric based on the notion of lossy _ minimum description length _ ( mdl ) has been proposed for evaluating clustering of general mixed data ( @xcite ) .",
    "the basic idea is that , given a potentially mixed data set , the `` optimal segmentation '' is the one that , over all possible segmentations , minimizes the coding length of the data , subject to a given quantization error . for data drawn from a mixture of gaussians ,",
    "the optimal segmentation can often be found efficiently using an agglomerative clustering approach . the mdl principle and the new clustering method",
    "have later been applied to the segmentation of natural images , known as _ compression - based texture merging _",
    "( ctm ) ( @xcite ) .",
    "this approach has proven to be highly effective for imitating human segmentation of natural images .",
    "preliminary success of this approach leads to the following important question : _ to what extent is segmentation obtained by image compression consistent with human perception ? _    the ctm algorithm also has its drawbacks .",
    "in particular , although the ctm method utilizes the idea of data compression , it does not exactly seek to compress the image _ per se_.",
    "first , it `` compresses ''",
    "feature vectors or windows extracted around all pixels by grouping them into clusters as a mixture of gaussian models . as a result ,",
    "the final coding length is highly _ redundant _ due to overlapping between windows of adjacent pixels , and has no direct relation to the true entropy of the image .",
    "second , the segmentation result encodes the membership of pixels using a huffman code , which does not take into account the smoothness of boundaries nor the spatial relationship of adjacent pixels that are more likely belong to one texture region .",
    "thus , ctm does not give a good estimate of the true entropy of the image , and it can not be used to justify a strong connection between image segmentation and image compression .      in this paper , we contend that , much better segmentation results can be obtained if we more closely adhere to the principle of image compression , by correctly counting only the necessary bits needed to encode a natural image for both the texture and boundaries .",
    "the proposed algorithm precisely estimates the coding length needed to encode the texture of each region based on the rate distortion of its probabilistic distribution and the number of _ non - overlapping _ interior windows . in order to adapt to different scales and shapes of texture regions in an image ,",
    "a hierarchy of multiple window sizes is incorporated in the segmentation process .",
    "the algorithm further encodes the boundary information of each homogeneous texture region by carefully counting the number of bits needed to encode the boundary with an adaptive chain code .",
    "based on the mdl principle , the optimal segmentation of an image is defined as the one that minimizes its total coding length , in this case a close approximation to the true entropy of the image . with any fixed quantization ,",
    "the final coding length gives a purely objective measure for how good the segmentation is in terms of the level of image compression .",
    "finally , we propose a simple yet effective regression method to adaptively select a proper quantization level for each individual image to achieve the optimal segmentation result .",
    "we conduct extensive experiments to compare the results with human segmentation using the berkeley segmentation dataset ( bsd ) ( @xcite ) .",
    "although our method is conceptually simple and the measure used is purely objective , the segmentation results match extremely well with those by humans , exceeding or competing with the best segmentation algorithms .",
    "we first discuss how to construct texture vectors that represent homogeneous textures in image segments . in order to capture the variation of a local _ texton _ , one can directly apply a @xmath0 cut - off window around a pixel across the three color channels , and stack the color values inside the window in a vector form as in @xcite .",
    "windows around all pixels of a color image @xmath1 into a data matrix @xmath2 and then projected to a low - dimensional space via principal component analysis ( pca ) . ,",
    "width=240 ]    figure [ fig : windows ] illustrates the process of constructing texture features .",
    "let the @xmath3-neighborhood @xmath4 be the set of all pixels in a @xmath5 window across three color channels ( e.g. , @xmath6 or @xmath7 ) centered at pixel @xmath8 . define the set of features @xmath2 by taking the @xmath3-neighborhood around each pixel in @xmath1 , and then stacking the window as a column vector : @xmath9 for ease of computation , we further reduce the dimensionality of these features by projecting the set of all features @xmath2 onto their first @xmath10 principal components .",
    "we denote the set of features with reduced dimensionality as @xmath11 .",
    "we have observed that for many natural images , the first eight principal components of @xmath2 contain over @xmath12 of the energy . in this paper , we choose to assign @xmath13 .    over the years , there have been many proposed methods to model the representation of image textures in natural images .",
    "one model that has been shown to be successful in encoding textures both empirically and theoretically is the gaussian _ mesh markov model _ ( mmm ) @xcite . particularly in texture synthesis , the gaussian mmm can provide consistent estimates of the joint distribution of the pixels in a window , which then can be used to fill in missing texture patches via a simple nonparametric scheme @xcite .",
    "however , to determine the optimal compression rate for samples from a distribution , one must know the rate - distortion function of that distribution @xcite . unfortunately , to our knowledge , the rate - distortion function for mmms is not known in closed form and difficult to estimate empirically . over all distributions with the same variance , it is known that the gaussian distribution has the highest rate - distortion , and is in this sense the worst case distribution for compression .",
    "thus by using the rate - distortion for a gaussian distribution , we obtain an _ upper bound _ for the true coding length of the mmm .      to describe encoding texture vectors , we first consider a single region @xmath14 with @xmath15 pixels .",
    "based on @xcite , for a fixed quantization error @xmath16 , the expected number of bits needed to code the set of @xmath15 feature windows @xmath11 up to distortion @xmath17 is given by : @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the mean and covariance of the vectors in @xmath11 .",
    "equation is the sum of three coding - lengths for the @xmath10 gaussian principal vectors as the codebook , the @xmath15 vectors w.r.t .",
    "that codebook , and the mean of the gaussian distribution .",
    "the coding length function is uniquely determined by the mean and covariance @xmath21 . to estimate them empirically ,",
    "we need to exclude the windows that cross the boundary of @xmath14 ( as shown in figure [ fig : interior](a ) ) .",
    "such windows contain textures from the adjacent regions , which can not be well modeled by a single gaussian as the interior windows .",
    "hence , the empirical mean @xmath22 and covariance @xmath23 of @xmath14 are only estimated from the _ interior _ of @xmath14 : @xmath24    furthermore , in , encoding all texture vectors in @xmath11 to represent region @xmath14 is highly redundant because the @xmath15 windows _ overlap _ with each other .",
    "thus , to obtain an efficient code of @xmath14 that closely approximates its true entropy , we only need to code the _ nonoverlapping _ windows that can tile @xmath14 as a grid , as in figure [ fig : interior ] ( b )",
    ".    ideally , if @xmath14 is a rectangular region of size @xmath25 , where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are positive integers , then clearly we can tile @xmath14 with exactly @xmath28 windows .",
    "so for coding the region @xmath14 , becomes :    @xmath29    real regions in natural images normally do not have such nice rectangular shapes .",
    "however , remains a good approximation to the actual coding length of a region @xmath14 with relatively smooth boundaries .      to code windows from multiple regions in an image , one must know to which region each window belongs , so that each window can be decoded w.r.t . the correct codebook .",
    "for generic samples from multiple classes , one can estimate the distribution of each class label and then code the membership of the samples using a scheme that is asymptotically optimal for that class distribution ( such as the huffman code used in @xcite ) .",
    "such coding schemes are highly inefficient for natural image segmentation , as they do not leverage the spatial correlation of pixels in the same region . in fact , for our application , pixels from the same region form a connected component .",
    "thus , the most efficient way of coding group membership for regions in images is to code the _ boundary _ of the region containing the pixels .",
    "a well - known scheme for representing boundaries of image regions is the _ freeman chain code_. in this coding scheme , the orientation of an edge is quantized along 8 discrete directions , shown in figure [ fig : chain - codes ] .",
    "let @xmath30 denote the orientations of the @xmath31 boundary edges of @xmath14 .",
    "since each chain code can be encoded using three bits , the coding length of the boundary of @xmath14 is    @xmath32    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : bsd - quant ]    among all the algorithms in table [ tab : bsd - quant ] , tbes achieves the best evaluations w.r.t .",
    "pri and voi .",
    "the second best algorithm reported is the ucm algorithm .",
    "it is also worth noting that there seems to be a large gap in terms of voi between all the algorithm indices and the human index ( e.g. , 1.705 for tbes versus 1.163 for human ) .",
    "with respect to gfm , ucm achieves the best performance , which is mainly due to the fact that ucm was designed to construct texture regions from the hierarchies of ( strong ) image contours and edges . in this category",
    ", our algorithm still achieves the second best performance , largely exceeding the indices posted by the rest of the algorithms in the literature .",
    "finally , we briefly discuss a few images on which our method fails to achieve a reasonable segmentation .",
    "the examples are shown in figure [ fig : bsd - failure ] .",
    "the main causes for visually inferior segmentation are camouflage , shadows , non - gaussian textures , and thin regions :    1 .",
    "it is easy to see that the texture of animal camouflages is deliberately chosen to be similar to the background texture .",
    "the algorithm falls behind humans in this situation , arguably , because human vision can _ recognize _ the holistic shape and texture of the animals based on experiences .",
    "2 .   as shades of the same texture",
    "may appear very different in images , tbes may break up the regions into more or less the same level of shade .",
    "3 .   some patterns in natural images",
    "do not follow the gaussian texture assumption .",
    "examples include geometric patterns such as lines or curves .",
    "4 .   thin regions , such as spider s legs , are problematic for tbes for two reasons . first , it has trouble to properly form low - level superpixels used as the initialization of our method .",
    "second , large enough windows which can better capture the statistics of the texture can barely fit into such thin regions .",
    "consequently , texture estimation at these regions is ill - conditioned and unstable .    to realize whether these problems are unique to our method or are more universal ,",
    "we have investigated similar problematic cases with the other methods reported here ( @xcite ) .",
    "none of the methods were able to handle camouflage very well .",
    "shadows are challenging for these methods as well .",
    "however , we observe that ucm performs relatively better in this case . for geometric patterns , ctm seems to be slightly better than others , but still is an over - segmentation . in the category of thin regions , all algorithms performed very poorly , but mean - shift is better by , for example , roughly picking up some of the spider s legs .",
    "it is further worth pointing out an interesting observation about pri versus voi that the former prefers over - segmentation and the latter prefers under - segmentation ( as shown in figure [ fig : bsd - failure ] ) .",
    "we have proposed a novel method for natural image segmentation .",
    "the algorithm uses a principled information - theoretic approach to combine cues of image texture and boundaries . in particular",
    ", the texture and boundary information of each texture region is encoded using a gaussian distribution and adaptive chain code , respectively .",
    "the partitioning of an image is achieved by an agglomerative clustering process applied to a hierarchy of decreasing window sizes .",
    "based on the mdl principle , the optimal segmentation of the image is defined as the one that minimizes its total coding length . as the lossy coding length function also depends on a distortion parameter that determines the coarseness of the segmentation , we have further proposed an efficient linear regression method to learn the optimal distortion parameter from a set of training images when provided by the user .",
    "our experiments have validated that the new algorithm outperforms other existing methods in terms of region - based segmentation indices , and is among the top solutions in terms of contour - based segmentation indices . to aid peer evaluation ,",
