    "recent experimental advances allow individual molecules to be placed between electrodes , and their electron transport properties to be measured in single - molecule junctions or transistors .",
    "one interesting family of molecules among them are anisotropic magnetic molecules referred to as single - molecule magnets ( smms ) .",
    "a smm comprises a few transition metal ions surrounded by several tens to hundreds of atoms , and has a large spin and a large magnetic anisotropy barrier @xcite .",
    "crystals of smms have drawn attention due to unique quantum properties such as quantum tunneling of magnetization @xcite and quantum interference or berry - phase oscillations induced by the magnetic anisotropy @xcite .",
    "there have been studies of the interplay between the quantum properties and the electron transport of individual smms at the single - molecule level @xcite .",

    ", electrons may tunnel via the vibrational excitations unique to the molecules , and the coupling can be tailored by external means .",
    "electron tunneling through vibrational excitations have been observed in single - molecule devices based on carbon nanotubes @xcite and small molecules @xcite including smms such as fe@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "interestingly , in some cases , a pronounced suppression of a low - bias current was found , attributed to a strong coupling between electronic charge and vibrations of nanosystems @xcite .",
    "it was also shown that the coupling strength could be modified at the nanometer scale in carbon nanotube mechanical resonators @xcite . for a smm tbpc@xmath4 grafted onto a carbon nanotube",
    ", a coupling between the molecular spin and vibrations of the nanotube was observed in conductance maps of the nanotube @xcite .",
    "so far , theories of the electron - phonon or electron - vibron coupling effects have been developed only for isotropic molecules @xcite in single - molecule junctions or transistors .",
    "for example , for molecules weakly coupled to electrodes , a model hamiltonian approach is commonly used to investigate the coupling effects , while for molecules strongly coupled to electrodes , a first - principles based method such as density - functional theory ( dft ) combined with non - equilibrium green s function method , is applied @xcite .",
    "recently , the coupling effects have been studied for isotropic molecules weakly coupled to electrodes , by using both dft and the model hamiltonian approach @xcite . for anisotropic magnetic molecules",
    "weakly coupled to electrodes , a combination of dft and a model hamiltonian would be proper to examine the coupling effects .",
    "the interplay between magnetic anisotropy and vibron - assisted tunneling can provide interesting features concerning vibrational conductance peaks .",
    "the smm fe@xmath0 has been shown to form stable single - molecule transistors without linker groups @xcite .",
    "the fe@xmath0 consists of four fe@xmath5 ions ( each ion with spin @xmath6 ) , among which the center fe@xmath5 ion is weakly antiferromagnetically coupled to the outer fe@xmath5 ions via o anions , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : geo](a ) .",
    "the neutral fe@xmath0 has the total ground - state spin @xmath1 with a magnetic anisotropy barrier of 16.2  k [ fig .",
    "[ fig : geo](b ) ] @xcite , while its doubly degenerate excited spin multiplets @xmath7 are located at 4.8  mev above the ground - state spin multiplet @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the negatively singly charged fe@xmath0 has the total spin @xmath2 well separated from the excited spin multiplet @xmath8 .",
    "the previous dft calculations suggest that the fe@xmath0 has only three vibrational modes with the electron - vibron coupling greater than unity @xcite .    here",

    "[ fig : geo](c ) ] , by using the model hamiltonian with the dft - calculated magnetic anisotropy parameters , vibrational energies , and electron - vibron coupling strengths .",
    "firstly , the height of vibrational conductance peaks shows a strong , unusual dependence on the _ direction _ and magnitude of applied @xmath3 field .",
    "this @xmath3-field dependence is attributed to the magnetic anisotropy barrier that is of the same order of magnitude as the energies of the vibrational modes with significant electron - vibron coupling . without the magnetic anisotropy",
    ", the conductance peaks would be insensitive to the @xmath3-field direction .",
    "secondly , satellite conductance peaks of magnetic origin exhibit a unique @xmath3-field evolution depending on the direction of @xmath3 field . at low @xmath3 fields ,",
    "the low - bias satellite peak arises from the magnetic levels in the vibrational ground state only , while at high @xmath3 fields , the levels in the vibrational excited states contribute to the satellite peak as much as that those in the vibrational ground state , because the separation between the levels becomes comparable to the vibrational excitations .",
    "thirdly , when multiple modes with significant electron - vibron coupling ( @xmath9 ) have energies close to one another , the low - bias conductance peak and the @xmath3-field dependence of the conductance peaks reveal qualitatively different features from the case of a single mode with the similar electron - vibron coupling .",
    "the similar trend to our findings may be observed for any anisotropic magnetic molecules as long as magnetic anisotropy is comparable to vibrational energies .",
    "this work can be viewed as a starting point for an understanding of magnetic anisotropy effects on electron tunneling via vibrational excitations , by using the combined method .",
    "the outline of this work is as follows .",

    "figure 1(a ) shows the simplified fe@xmath0 molecule with @xmath10 symmetry . without such simplification ,",
    "vibrational modes would not be obtained within a reasonable compute time . it is confirmed that this simplification does not affect much the electronic and magnetic properties of the fe@xmath0 molecule ( sec.iii.a ) .",

    "the homo level is doubly degenerate , while the doubly degenerate lumo+1 level is separated from the lumo level by 0.05  ev .",
    "the lumo arises from the outer fe ions with the minority spin ( spin down ) at the vertices of the triangle [ fig .",

    "the calculated electronic structure suggests that when an extra electron is added to the fe@xmath0 molecule , the electron is likely to go to the minority - spin outer fe sites .",

    "the electronic structure study of the charged fe@xmath0 molecule , however , provides a homo - lumo gap of 0.06 ev , which agrees with the previous dft result @xcite .",
