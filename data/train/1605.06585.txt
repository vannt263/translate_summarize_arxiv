    "in survival and medical studies it is quite common that more than one cause of failure may be directed to a system at the same time .",
    "it is often interesting that an investigator needs to estimate a specific risk in presence of other risk factors . in statistical literature analysis of such risk",
    "is known as competing risk model .",
    "parametric inference of competing risk models are studied by many authors assuming that competing risks follow different lifetime distributions such as gamma , exponential and weibull distribution ; see for example @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "however determination of the cause of the failure is more difficult many times to observe than to follow up the time to failure . under the assumption that risks follow exponential distribution , inference of the model studied by @xcite .",
    "@xcite considered the same model , studied by miyakawa under the assumption that every member of a certain target population either dies of a particular cause , say cancer or by other causes .",
    "model can be more flexible by considering the fact that some individual may be alive at the end of experiment i.e. data are censored .",
    "such models are available in literature even under bayesian set up ; see for example @xcite , @xcite .    here",
    "we consider competing risk under progressive type - ii censoring .",
    "the censoring scheme is defined as follows .",
    "consider n individuals in a study and assume that there are k causes of failure which are known . at time of each failure , one of more surviving units may be removed from the study at random .",
    "the data from a progressively type - ii censored sample is as follows : @xmath0 @xmath1 .",
    "note that the complete and type - ii right censored samples are special cases of the above scheme when @xmath2 and @xmath3 and @xmath4 respectively .",
    "for an exhaustive list of references and further details on progressive censoring , the reader may refer to the book by @xcite .",
    "the main focus of this paper is the analysis of parametric competing risk model when the data is progressively censored .",
    "no work has been done taking modified weibull as parametric distribution of cause of the failures .",
    "modified weibull has different forms .",
    "we consider a specific form mentioned in section 2 which is not well - studied . in bayesian analysis",
    "we choose reference prior .",
    "use of reference prior is rare as it makes the computational problem harder , though the best motivation for prior selection can be obtained through reference prior .",
    "also many times expression of the prior may not be tractable .",
    "however using gibbs combined with slice can provide a solution to this problem .",
    "bayes estimators and credible intervals are also obtained .",
    "the organization of the chapter is as follows . in section 2",
    "we describe the model and present the definitions and notation used throughout the paper .",
    "the bayesian estimation of the different parameters are considered in section 3 .",
    "numerical results are provided in section 4 .",
    "we illustrate the performance of those techniques in section 5 using real data set .",
    "finally some conclusions are drawn in section 6 .",
    "we assume @xmath5 are n independent , identically distributed ( i.i.d . )",
    "modified weibull random variable .",
    "further @xmath6 and @xmath7 are independent for all @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "we observe the sample @xmath10 assuming all the causes of failure are known .",
    "we assume that the @xmath11 s are modified weibull distribution with parameters @xmath12 for @xmath8 and for @xmath13 .",
    "the distribution function @xmath14 of @xmath11 has the following form : @xmath15 , @xmath16 and 2 .",
    "therefore for each cause @xmath17 , the pdf of failure time can be given by , @xmath18    the likelihood function of the observed data is @xmath19\\\\ & \\times & \\prod_{i = m_{1}}^{m } [ f_{2}(t_{i } ; \\alpha , \\beta , \\lambda_{1})s_{1}(t_{i } ; \\alpha , \\beta , \\lambda_{2})]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath20    evaluating the above likelihood we get @xmath21 e^{(\\lambda_{1 } + \\lambda_{2})\\alpha\\sum_{i = 1}^{m}(r_{i } + 1)(1 - e^{(\\frac{t_{i}}{\\alpha})^{\\beta } } ) } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      the key idea is to derive reference prior described by @xcite ( 1992 ) is to get prior @xmath22 that maximizes the expected posterior information about the parameters .",
    "let @xmath23 is expected information about @xmath24 given the data @xmath25 .",
    "then @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the kullback - leibler distance between posterior @xmath28 and prior @xmath29 can be given by @xmath30    if the set up is as follows , @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is @xmath33 and @xmath34 is @xmath35 .",
    "we define @xmath36 where @xmath32 is the parameter of interest and @xmath34 is a nuisance parameter .",
    "let @xmath37    we can show @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the constant that makes this distribution a proper density .",
    "we will be using this fact to get the expression for the prior in conditional distribution at each gibbs sampler step .",
    "* reference prior for gibbs sampling set - up *    in the gibbs sampling set - up we try to reduce the posterior as the conditional distribution of one parameter given the other parameters and the data . for example , we are interested in finding the @xmath40 complication of finding reference prior can be much simplied by using gibbs sampler method .    @xmath41    @xmath42    @xmath43    @xmath44",
    "however generation of random number from these conditional densities is not tractable through inverse transform method due to its highly complicated form .",
    "therefore we use slice sampler to generate sample from those conditional distribution .",
    "steps of the algorithms and calculation of hpd region can be provided as follows :      1 .",
    "choose a starting value of @xmath45 .",
    "2 .   use slice sampling to generate @xmath46 using above @xmath47 .",
    "3 .   use this new @xmath46 and earlier @xmath47 to generate new @xmath48 .",
    "4 .   use new @xmath49 and earlier @xmath50 to generate new @xmath51 .",
    "use new @xmath52 to generate new @xmath53 .",
    "repeat step 2 - 5 m times to generate new ( @xmath54 ) @xmath55 .",
    "mean bayesian estimate of @xmath45 is given by:-",
    "@xmath56 @xmath57 8 .   to obtain hpd(highest posterior density ) region of @xmath46 ,",
    "we order @xmath58 , as @xmath59 .",
    "then 100(1 - @xmath60)@xmath61 hpd region of @xmath46 become @xmath62 + therefore 100(1 - @xmath60)@xmath61 hpd region of @xmath46 becomes @xmath63 where @xmath64 is such that @xmath65 for all @xmath66 .",
    "similarly , we can obtain the hpd credible interval for @xmath48 , @xmath51 and @xmath53 .",
    "in this section we conduct a simulation study to investigate the performance of the proposed bayes estimators . we generate sample points from the actual distribution assuming the parameters provided along with different censoring schemes and then apply it to our model to predict the parameters and compare the results . to generate data sets",
    "currently we assign the cause of failure as 1 or 2 with probability 0.5 .",
    "we have generated 200 data points .",
    "then we have divided it in 2 cases . in case 1",
    "we consider all 200 data points ( which is * type 2 censoring * ) and in case 2 we will apply censoring on those data ( which is * progressive censoring * ) and then predict the parameters .",
    "below are the different schemes of data sets used for validation .",
    "1 .   @xmath67 , type 2 censoring 2 .",
    "@xmath67 , progressive type 2 censoring 3 .",
    "@xmath68 , type 2 censoring 4 .",
    "@xmath68 , progressive type 2 censoring    * scheme 1 *        .results comparison for scheme 1 [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ fig : case2 ]    the results obtained for hpd region of @xmath51 apparently seem to look awkward as its width is very high .",
    "however taking posterior median as true value of the parameters of modified weibull , we can easily cross - check it provides a good fit for histograms of the distribution of cause - specific data .",
    "this verifies the distributional assumption of this parametric approach .",
    "we consider the bayesian analysis of the competing risks data when they are type - ii progressively censored .",
    "numerical simulation shows the posterior median calculated via slice sampling combined with gibbs sampler works quite well . in this article",
    "we consider with two causes of failure only , the work can be extended to more than two causes of failure .",
    "we select parameters to follow reference prior which is very flexible .",
    "the similar work can be done for type - i progressively censored data .",
    "the work is on progress .",
    "slice sampling uses step out methods where selection of width plays an important role .",
    "an automated choice of such selection based on the data and distribution can enhance the quality of the algorithm .",
