    "it relies on the single - particle description of the transport properties and a purely elastic electron scattering .",
    "although the wf law is usually not obeyed at @xmath16 0 because of the importance of inelastic scattering , it must be obeyed in the fermi liquid at @xmath17 0 where the electrons are elastically scattered by static disorders .",
    "the examination of the wf law at @xmath8 by using sub - kelvin charge and heat transport measurements can therefore provide a direct judgement on the nature of the normal state of high-@xmath18 cuprates , which is a prime example of the strongly - correlated electron systems challenging the description of fermi liquids .",
    "it has been found in the overdoped tl@xmath19ba@xmath19cuo@xmath20 ( tl2201 ) that the wf law is perfectly obeyed , which indicated a fermi - liquid ground state of the overdoped cuprates.@xcite    it was recently predicted that the wf law is violated in disordered interacting electron systems,@xcite in which the coulomb interactions are likely to bring some additional scattering and impede the charge transport more efficiently . a recent study of the low-@xmath7 transport of bi@xmath21sr@xmath22cuo@xmath20 ( bi2201),@xcite in which a positive departure from the wf law ( @xmath23 ) appeared at optimum doping and became more pronounced in the underdoped regime , was argued to support the theoretical prediction because the disorder in bi2201 increases with decreasing doping level due to its peculiar chemistry .",
    "however , in previous studies , both on the overdoped tl2201 and on the underdoped bi2201 , the normal state was achieved by applying very strong magnetic field , which could induce some kind of sdw / cdw",
    "order.@xcite such a competing order may cause some uncertainty regarding whether the properties of the true ground state is indeed detected.@xcite it would therefore be useful if one could study the validity of the wf law in cuprates whose normal states is obtained in a way other than by applying a strong magnetic field .",
    "introducing impurities or defects into cuo@xmath19 planes is a viable way of suppressing the superconductivity and obtaining the normal state . because of the non-@xmath24-wave symmetry of cuprates ,",
    "nonmagnetic impurities like zn or mg are found to destroy the superconductivity quite strongly , particularly for the underdoped cuprates.@xcite furthermore , the impurity substitution was found to show different impacts on the physical properties in the underdoped and the overdoped cuprates , signifying a remarkable difference in the corresponding ground states.@xcite    it was found that in underdoped la@xmath22sr@xmath25cuo@xmath5 ( lsco ) and bi@xmath19sr@xmath22la@xmath25cuo@xmath20 ( bslco ) , a low-@xmath7 resistivity divergence shows up immediately after the superconductivity is completely suppressed by a slight zn substitution ( @xmath26 2%).@xcite the resistivity divergence is even stronger than the log(1/@xmath7 ) function , which is a well - known low-@xmath7 behavior of high - magnetic - field - induced insulating state,@xcite and therefore indicates an insulating ground state.@xcite the magnetoresistance data suggested that the zn - induced insulating state is likely due to kondo effect associated with impurity - induced magnetism.@xcite in any event , the normal state of these disordered and underdoped cuprates is apparently insulating and it is actually not meaningful to test the validity of the wf law for these samples .    in optimally - doped or overdoped regimes , on the other hand , a slight zn substitution ( @xmath26 4% )",
    "was found to induce a simply metallic state when the superconductivity is suppressed,@xcite which is believed to demonstrate the fermi liquid ground state of the overdoped cuprates .",
    "however , it was also found that the heavy electron irradiation ( to introduce point defects and to destroy the superconductivity similarly to zn substitution ) in the overdoped tl2201 can lead to a low-@xmath7 resistivity upturn,@xcite so the occurrence of electron localization in the overdoped regime appears to depend on the level of disorder .",
    "the temperature dependence of the conductivity suppression @xmath27 ( compared to the extrapolated residual conductivity from the high-@xmath7 data ) in the heavily - electron - irradiated tl2201 had a ln@xmath7 variation and was in rough quantitative agreement with the two - dimensional ( 2d ) weak localization theory .",
    "once the anderson transition into the insulating state takes place and the resistivity shows an exponentially divergent behavior due to strong disorder , even in the overdoped regime the wf law is meaningless .",
    "however , in the moderately disordered regime in which the superconductivity is suppressed by disorder but the resistivity is not really divergent , it becomes possible to examine the peculiar electron transport properties through the wf law without introducing the possible complications from the magnetic - field - induced effects .    in this work , by substituting zn or mg for cu in la@xmath0sr@xmath1cu@xmath2@xmath3@xmath4o@xmath5 ( @xmath3 = zn or mg ) ( lscmo ) , we are able to obtain a series of non - superconducting overdoped lsco .",
    "when the superconductivity is just suppressed at zn concentration of @xmath6 = 0.049 and 0.082 , the ground state is clearly metallic and the wf law is found to hold reasonably well , pointing to the fermi - liquid state of the overdoped cuprates . with higher concentration of zn ( @xmath6 = 0.13 ) or mg ( @xmath6 = 0.15 ) , a low-@xmath7 resistivity upturn shows up .",
    "it is found that the @xmath7-dependence of the conductivity obeys a @xmath28 law and therefore indicates a metallic ground state at @xmath8 .",
    "this result , accompanied with the negative magnetoresistance , suggests a three - dimensional ( 3d ) weak localization behavior .",
    "however , the low-@xmath7 heat transport data indicate a surprisingly _ negative _ deviation from the wf law ( @xmath29 ) that is opposite to the theoretical prediction for the disordered interacting electron systems .",

    "the pristine lsco sample shows a good @xmath7-linear behavior of @xmath32 below 300 k and a sharp superconducting transition at 34.5 k. with increasing zn concentration to @xmath6 = 0.049 and 0.082 , the linearity of the resistivity becomes a bit worse but obviously a metallic behavior ( with positive temperature coefficient ) persists down to very low temperature without displaying any superconducting transition .",
    "when zn concentration increases to 0.13 , the resistivity starts to show a weak upturn below @xmath26 12 k. in mg - substituted samples ( @xmath6 = 0.15 ) , the low - temperature upturn of the resistivity is pronounced .",

    "first of all , the resistivity of these samples keeps increasing upon lowering temperature down to the lowest temperature ( @xmath26 80 mk ) .",
    "however , the increase in resistivity is apparently weaker than the log(1/@xmath7 ) function , which is a common insulating behavior in both the high - magnetic - field - induced normal state of underdoped high-@xmath18 cuprates and the lightly - doped non - superconducting yba@xmath19cu@xmath38o@xmath39 ( ybco).@xcite this observation suggests that the resistivity may not diverge in the zero - temperature limit in these samples .",
    "it is actually easy to find , as shown in figs .",
    "2(c ) and 2(d ) , that the low-@xmath7 electrical conductivity of these samples follows a power law @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are temperature - independent coefficients .",
    "it follows from this temperature dependence that the resistivity @xmath43 remains finite at @xmath44 0 , which is a clear indication of a metallic ground state of these samples .",
    "note that this @xmath7-dependence of resistivity is somehow different from the ln@xmath7 variation of @xmath27 observed in the overdoped tl2201 after significant electron irradiation.@xcite since the measurements of tl2201 were not done at very low temperatures , a direct comparison between lscmo and tl2201 is not available now .",
    "nevertheless , the 2d weak localization picture proposed for tl2201 , which is based on the ln@xmath7 behavior of conductivity , may not be appropriate for lscmo .",
    "remember , the particular @xmath28 dependence of conductivity is known for the 3d weak localization.@xcite it is possible that the overdoped lsco with strong disorder is effectively a 3d electron system , though the temperature dependence of the resistivity anisotropy suggests that clean lsco is two dimensional for the whole superconducting compositions ( @xmath45 0.30).@xcite    another important feature one may note in fig .",
    "2 is that the low-@xmath7 resistivity decreases in magnetic fields , that is , they show rather strong negative magnetoresistance .",
    "this immediately rules out the possible contamination of the superconducting fluctuations to the resistivity data and suggests that the weak negative temperature coefficient of resistivity is due to the intrinsic electron transport of the normal state .",
    "furthermore , the negative magnetoresistance at low temperature also indicates that the weak localization is likely responsible for the resistivity upturn.@xcite    as a summary of the electrical transport results , the resistivity upturn in the heavily zn- and mg - substituted and carrier - overdoped lsco does not signify a metal - to - insulator crossover ( mic ) but is attributed to an inelastic electron scattering by impurities / disorders in a metallic regime .",
    "furthermore , the temperature dependence of the low-@xmath7 resistivity does not suggest a kondo - like scattering mechanism , which is often playing a role in the charge transport in underdoped cuprates.@xcite       vs @xmath46 and ( b ) @xmath47 vs @xmath7 .",

    "note that the low-@xmath7 thermal conductivity of all these samples can be well fitted either to @xmath49 or to @xmath50 as shown in figs .",
    "3(a ) and 3(b ) , respectively , but the temperature range for obtaining a good fit is much wider with using eq .",
    "( [ t ] ) . looking at fig .",
    "3 , one may notice that the data quality of these charge - carrier - overdoped lsco samples are unprecedentedly high . in a previous study,@xcite some clear downturn of the low-@xmath7 thermal conductivity data",
    "was observed in the overdoped lsco and was already discussed to be due to the electron - phonon decoupling,@xcite whose adverse effects on probing the intrinsic electron thermal conductivity can be avoided if the contacts are good enough .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ t^2 ] ) is commonly used for describing the low-@xmath7 thermal conductivity of superconducting cuprates , where the residual term @xmath48 is the contribution of @xmath51-wave nodal quasiparticles and @xmath52 is the phonon contribution in the boundary scattering limit.@xcite in this regard , the present data of the pristine lsco are in good harmony with the previous studies . for samples with zn concentrations of 0.049 and 0.082 ,",
    "whose ground state is metallic as indicated by the in - plane resistivity , @xmath48 is apparently coming from the electron heat transport as in ordinary metals .",
    "if the ground state is a fermi liquid , one can expect that the values of the residual resistivity and @xmath48 satisfy the wf law . from fig .",
    "3(a ) , it is clear that there is about 20% difference between the @xmath48 obtained from eq .",
    "( [ t^2 ] ) and the values calculated from the residual resistivity ( see fig .",
    "1 ) using the wf law .",
    "note that this 20% difference is not mainly due to the experimental error , since the resistivity and thermal conductivity measurements are performed using the same samples and the same contacts .",
    "it was recently reported that eq .",
    "( [ t ] ) is a good description for the low-@xmath7 thermal conductivity of tl2201 and bi@xmath19sr@xmath19cacu@xmath19o@xmath53.@xcite as shown in fig .",

    "( [ t ] ) gives qualitatively the same behavior upon zn substitution as that in fig .",
    "3(a ) , but the @xmath48 from this fitting agree better ( in fact , almost perfectly ) with those from the wf law .",
    "this gives a circumstantial support to the validity of eq .",
    "( 4 ) in the overdoped regime .",
    "compared to the underdoped lsco , in which a modified formula with the phonon boundary scattering @xmath54 ( @xmath55 = 2.53 ) was proposed to fit the data well,@xcite the second term @xmath56 in eq .",
    "( [ t ] ) is apparently not originating from the boundary scattering limit .",
    "one possible explanation for this unusual power is the effect of strong electron - phonon scattering on phonons .",
    "it has been known that a @xmath46 behavior of the phonon thermal conductivity can show up in both usual metals and @xmath51-wave superconductors.@xcite in the case of a @xmath51-wave superconductor , the fermi surface is anisotropicaly gapped except for the gap nodes , nearby where the quasiparticles are excited even at low temperature.@xcite those so - called nodal quasiparticles dominate the transport properties.@xcite for such a system , it was theoretically proposed that the @xmath46 behavior of the phonon thermal conductivity originates from the fact that the transverse phonons propagating along certain high - symmetry directions do not interact with the nodal quasiparticles.@xcite however , the non - superconducting overdoped samples have a complete fermi surface , and therefore a very different momentum distribution of electrons from that in @xmath51-wave superconductors is formed . apparently ,",
    "the electron - phonon scattering should differ significantly for the zn - free and zn - substituted samples , considering the distinct difference in the electronic structures between the superconducting and non - superconducting samples .",
    "therefore , the @xmath46 coefficient is expected to be quite different in these two cases . nevertheless , as shown in fig .",
    "3 , the coefficient @xmath57 of the pristine ( superconducting ) and zn - substituted ( non - superconducting ) lsco are found to be nearly the same , which seems to rule out the possibility that the @xmath46-law comes from the electron - phonon scattering .",
    "in addition , one may notice that , when the electron - phonon scattering is strong , the electronic thermal conductivity @xmath58 can not be temperature independent and therefore eq . (",
    "[ t ] ) is physically imprecise.@xcite    another possible origin of the @xmath56 term is the phonon thermal conductivity with the dominant scattering of dislocations.@xcite this scenario is consistent with the observation that eq .",
    "( [ t^2 ] ) becomes a good description of the data at very low temperatures , because the dislocation scattering is likely to be smeared out at low enough temperatures .",
    "there is a possibility that some dislocation defects are produced in lsco crystals when they are quenched to nitrogen temperature after high - temperature annealing .    in any case",
    ", it appears that the wf law holds reasonably well ( the deviation is no more than 20% ) in the overdoped lsco when the normal state is obtained by a moderate impurity substitution .",
    "if one could take the validity of the wf law as a robust signature of a fermi - liquid state , the present result apparently indicates a fermi - liquid nature of the overdoped lsco .",
    "this conclusion is essentially the same as that for the overdoped tl2201 , where the normal state was achieved by strong magnetic fields.@xcite however , one should note that the resistivity of our moderately zn - substituted samples actually shows a good @xmath7-linear behavior at low temperature , which has been taken as a characteristic non - fermi - liquid feature.@xcite therefore , there is still some inconsistency between the interpretations of the wf law and the resistivity behavior in overdoped lsco , which needs further clarification .",

    "4 . from figs . 4(a ) and 4(b ) , it can be seen that the usual formula of eq .",
    "( [ t^2 ] ) is not able to fit the low-@xmath7 thermal conductivity data , that is , the experimental data plotted in @xmath47 vs @xmath46 never show a linear behavior down to @xmath26 60 mk ; in fact , the curves always have a negative curvature .",
    "this phenomenon is very similar to what we observed in the lightly - doped non - superconducting ybco,@xcite in which case the heading of @xmath47 to zero upon lowering temperatures and the log(1/@xmath7)-divergent resistivity demonstrated the insulating ground state .    in the present case , we would like to point out at the beginning that the curvature of @xmath47 vs @xmath46 plots is _ not _ likely due to the decoupling of electrons and phonons.@xcite it is known that the necessity of making good contacts to obtain the intrinsic electronic thermal conductivity data becomes more severe when the electron term becomes larger .",
    "comparing the data shown in figs . 4 and 3 , one can easily see that the pristine and lower zn - substituted lsco samples , which must have larger electron thermal conductivity than @xmath6 = 0.13 ( @xmath3 = zn ) and 0.15 ( @xmath3 = mg ) samples , actually do not show obvious sign of downturn curvature in their @xmath47 vs @xmath46 plots .    upon further analyzing the data",
    ", one can find that eq .",
    "( [ t ] ) is still able to fit the thermal conductivity data of @xmath6 = 0.13 ( @xmath3 = zn ) samples very well from 60 to 400 mk , as shown in fig .",
    "because of the even stronger curvature in the @xmath47 data of @xmath6 = 0.15 ( @xmath3 = mg ) sample , neither eq .",
    "( [ t^2 ] ) nor eq .",
    "( [ t ] ) can fit the data ; instead , the low-@xmath7 data of mg - substituted lsco can be described by a formula @xmath60 with the fitting parameter @xmath48 = 0 .    as we have seen in sec .",
    "a. , the charge transport data indicate that in the heavily zn- or mg - substituted lsco some inelastic scattering is taking place at low temperatures , causing a weak localization behavior .",
    "one direct consequence of this fact is that @xmath58 is no longer independent of temperature in these samples , and the resistivity upturn naturally corresponds to a gradual decrease of @xmath58 with lowering temperatures .",
    "obviously , this invalidates eq .",
    "( [ t ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , one can apparently fit the data for @xmath6 = 0.13 ( @xmath3 = zn ) samples to eq .",
    "( [ t ] ) , which is probably due to the fact that the low-@xmath7 resistivity upturn ( @xmath61 10% increase in @xmath32 from 900 to 80 mk ) or the inelastic scattering are weak enough to make the deviations of @xmath58 from a constant effectively negligible .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath6 = 0.15 ( @xmath3 = mg ) samples show even stronger resistivity upturn and more significant inelastic scattering .",
    "it is likely that a considerable temperature dependence of the electronic term @xmath58 is the cause of eq .",
    "( [ t^0.8 ] ) , which is an approximate description of the low-@xmath7 thermal conductivity of mg - substituted sample .    based on the linear fittings ( shown in fig .",
    "4 ) to obtain the residual term @xmath48 , one can easily find an important result , that is , the wf law in these metallic samples are strongly violated . as shown in figs .",
    "4(c ) and 4(d ) , the @xmath48 values obtained from the extrapolation of the thermal conductivity data to @xmath7 = 0 k are much smaller than those predicted by the wf law using the residual conductivity shown in figs .",
    "2(c ) and 2(d ) .",
    "especially , the mg - substituted lsco crystal gives a @xmath48 value that is essentially zero , indicating a  thermal insulator \" ground state , while the resistivity data suggest a finite residual term and a metallic ground state .",
    "it is surprising that the departure from the wf law is _ negative _ , which has never been observed in cuprates ; for example , upon approaching mic in the underdoped region of cuprates , the departure from the wf law was found to be positive .",
    "@xcite intriguingly , there is another metallic system which exhibits a negative deviation from the wf law : it is the heavy - fermion system cecoin@xmath62 when tuned to its quantum critical point ( qcp).@xcite in that materials , the violation of the wf law is accompanied by a @xmath7-linear resistivity and has been discussed to be due to an anisotropic destruction of the fermi surface .",
    "such a qcp - related origin of the wf - law violation is unlikely for lsco , given that the violation is _ not _ observed in less disordered ( @xmath6 = 0.049 and 0.082 ) samples . in passing , it is useful to note that the negative departure from the wf law is contrary to the theoretical predictions for the disordered interacting electron systems.@xcite although one could speculate that this unusual breakdown of the wf law in lsco may be related to the strong electron correlations or the antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations in cuprates , the validity of the wf law in samples with lower zn - concentrations does not support this speculation . hence , the charge and heat transport properties in the moderately disordered , weakly localized regime call for deeper theoretical investigations on systems in the vicinity of electron localization",
    "both the charge and heat transports properties are studied in overdoped lsco where the superconductivity is completely suppressed by zn- or mg - substitution . when the superconductivity is just destroyed with the zn substitution of @xmath6 = 0.049 and 0.082 , the ground state is clearly metallic and the wf law is found to hold reasonably well , pointing to the fermi - liquid nature of the overdoped cuprates . with higher doping of zn ( @xmath6 = 0.13 ) or mg ( @xmath6 = 0.15 ) , a low-@xmath7 resistivity upturn shows up but the @xmath7-dependence of the electrical conductivity follows a @xmath28 law and therefore indicates a metallic ground state . in this metallic state , which is in the regime of 3d weak localization ,",
