    "this contribution to eds07 is based upon work done in collaboration with regina f. avila and pierre gauron  @xcite .",
    "the odderon is defined as a singularity in the complex j - plane , located at @xmath2 when @xmath3 and which contributes to the odd - under - crossing amplitude @xmath4 .",
    "the concept of odderon first emerged in 1973 in the context of asymptotic theorems  @xcite .",
    "7 years later , it was possibly connected with 3-gluon exchanges in perturbative qcd  @xcite , but it took 27 years to firmly rediscover it in the context of pqcd  @xcite .",
    "the odderon was also rediscovered recently in the color glass condensate ( cgc ) approach  @xcite and in the dipole picture  @xcite .",
    "one can therefore assert that the odderon is a crucial test of qcd .    on experimental level",
    ", there is a strong evidence for the non - perturbative odderon : the discovery , in 1985 , of a difference between @xmath5 and @xmath6 in the dip - shoulder region @xmath7 gev@xmath8 at @xmath9 52.8 gev  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , these data were obtained in one week , just before isr was closed and therefore the evidence , even if it is strong ( 99,9 % confidence level ) , is not totally convincing .",
    "the maximal odderon  @xcite , is a special case ( tripole ) corresponding to the maximal asymptotic @xmath10 behavior allowed by the general principles of strong interactions : @xmath11 and @xmath12 interestingly enough , an important stream of theoretical papers concern precisely the maximal behavior  @xcite , which was first discovered by heisenberg in 1952  @xcite and later proved , in a more rigorous way by froissart and martin  @xcite .",
    "half a century after the discovery of heisenberg , this maximal behavior  ( [ eq:1 ] ) was also proved in the context of the ads / cft dual string - gravity theory  @xcite and of the color glass condensate approach  @xcite .",
    "it was also shown to provide the best description of the present experimental data on total cross - sections  @xcite .",
    "the maximal behavior of @xmath13 is naturally associated with the maximal behavior @xmath14 . in other words",
    ", strong interactions should be as strong as possible .",
    "in the present paper we will consider a very general form of the hadron amplitudes compatible with both the maximal behavior of strong interaction at asymptotic energies and with the well established regge behavior at moderate energies , i.e. at pre - isr and isr energies  @xcite .",
    "our strategy is the following :    * we will consider two cases : one in which the odderon is absent and one in which the odderon is present .",
    "* we will use the two respective forms in order to describe the 832 experimental points for @xmath15 and @xmath16 scattering , from pdg tables , for @xmath17 and @xmath18 , in the s - range @xmath19 and in the t - range @xmath20 the best form will be chosen . * in order to make predictions at rhic and lhc energies , we will insist on the best possible _ quantitative _ description of the data . * from the study of the interference between @xmath21 and @xmath22 amplitudes we will conclude which are the best experiments to be done in order to detect in a clear way the odderon .",
    "@xmath23 are defined to be @xmath24 and are normalized so that @xmath25 @xmath26 the @xmath21 amplitude is written as a sum of the regge poles and cuts in standard form  @xcite and the heisenberg component @xmath27 representing the contribution of a 3/2 - cut collapsing , at @xmath3 , to a triple pole located at @xmath2 and which satisfies the auberson - kinoshita - martin asymptotic theorem  @xcite : @xmath28\\exp(b_3^+t)\\ , \\end{array}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 are bessel functions , @xmath30 and @xmath31 are constants , @xmath32 and @xmath33    in its turn , the @xmath22 amplitude is written as a sum of the regge poles and cuts in standard form  @xcite and @xmath34 representing the maximal odderon contribution , resulting from two complex conjugate poles collapsing , at @xmath3 , to a dipole located at @xmath2 and which satisfies the auberson - kinoshita - martin asymptotic theorem : @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are constants .",
    "let us first consider the case _ without the odderon_. in this case , one has 23 free parameters .    in spite of the quite impressive number of free parameters ,",
    "the @xmath38-value is inacceptably bad : @xmath39 a closer examination of the results reveals however an interesting fact : the no - odderon case describes nicely the data in the t - region @xmath40 but totally fails to describe the data for higher t - values .",
    "this failure does not mean the failure of the regge model , which is a basic ingredient of the approach presented in this paper .",
    "it simply means the need for the odderon .    in the case with the odderon ,",
    "we have 12 supplementary free parameters .    the total of 35 free parameters of our approach could be considered , at a superficial glance , as too big .",
    "however , one has to realize that the 23 free parameters associated with the dominant @xmath21 amplitude and with the component of @xmath22 responsible for describing the data for @xmath41 ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq:2 ] ) ) and @xmath42 , where @xmath43 are , almost all of them , well constrained .",
    "moreover , the discrepancy between he no - odderon model and the experimental data in the moderate - t region ( especially at @xmath44 gev and @xmath45 gev ) is so big that , in their turn , the supplementary 12 free parameters ( at least , most of them ) are also well constrained .",
    "let us also note that the above - mentioned discrepancy in the region of @xmath1 defined by @xmath46 can not come , as one could thing , from the contributions induced by perturbative qcd .",
    "the region ( [ eq:45 ] ) is fully in the domain of validity of the non - perturbative regge pole model and the respective values of @xmath1 are too small in order to make pqcd calculations .",
    "the resulting value of @xmath38 is @xmath47 an excellent value if we consider the fact that we did not take into account the systematic errors of the experimental data .    the partial value of @xmath38 , corresponding only to @xmath3 ( @xmath48 and @xmath49 ) data is @xmath50 an acceptable value ( 276 experimental forward points took into account ) .",
    "of course , better @xmath38 values can be obtained in fitting _ only _ the @xmath3 data , as it is in often made in phenomenological papers . however , it is obvious that , in a global fit including non - forward data , the corresponding @xmath3 parameters will be modified and therefore a higher @xmath38 value will be obtained .",
    "the @xmath3 and @xmath51 data are certainly independent but the parameter values are obviously correlated in a global fit .",
    "we plot in fig . 1 our fit and predictions for @xmath52 data at @xmath44 gev , at the rhic energy values @xmath53 gev , at the commissioning run energy value @xmath54 gev and at the lhc energy value @xmath55 tev .",
    "the description of the data at @xmath44 gev as offered by our approach is the best one existing in literature .",
    "it has to ne noted that the structure ( dip ) region moves slowly , with increasing energy , from @xmath56 gev@xmath8 at @xmath44 gev towards @xmath57 gev@xmath8 at @xmath55 tev .",
    "there is an interesting phenomenon of oscillations present in @xmath58 ( see fig .",
    "2 ) , where @xmath59    due of the oscillations present in the heisenberg - type amplitude @xmath27 and in the maximal odderon amplitude @xmath34 . unfortunately , we can not directly test the existence of these oscillations at rhic and lhc energies , simply because we will not have both @xmath15 and @xmath16 accelerators at these energies .",
    "however a chance to detect these oscillations at the rhic energy @xmath53 gev still exists , simply because the ua4/2 collaboration already performed a high - precision @xmath16 experiment at a very close energy - 541 gev  @xcite . by performing a very precise experiment at the rhic energy @xmath53 gev and by combining the corresponding @xmath15 data with the ua4/2 @xmath16 high - precision data",
    "one has a non - negligible chance to detect an oscillation centered around @xmath60 gev@xmath8 and therefore to detect the odderon .",
    "it is precisely the oscillation centered around @xmath60 gev@xmath8 which is the reminder of the already seen oscillation centered around @xmath61 gev@xmath8 at the isr energy @xmath44 gev .",
    "the participants at the workshop `` odderon searches at rhic '' , hold at bnl in september 2005 , concluded that the best available setup for the experimental search for the odderon is the proposed combination of star experiment and roman pots at @xmath62 experiment , described in the proposal `` physics with tagged forward protons with the star detector at rhic '' .",
    "they also concluded that the most unambiguous signature of the odderon is to detect a non - zero difference between @xmath15 and @xmath16 differential cross - sections at @xmath53 gev , as described above .",
    "rhic is an ideal place for discovering the odderon and therefore testing qcd and cgc  @xcite .",
    "lhc is also a good place to discover the odderon .",
    "we predict @xmath63 and @xmath64 a @xmath65-measurement at lhc would be certainly a very important test of the maximal odderon , given the fact that our prediction is sufficiently lower than what dispersion relations without odderon contributions could predict ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "there are several other proposals for detecting the odderon , summarized in the nice review written by ewerz  @xcite .",
    "there are very rare cases in the history of physics that a scientific and testable idea is neither proved nor disproved 33 years after its invention .",
    "the odderon remains an elusive object in spite of intensive research for its experimental evidence .",
    "the main reason for this apparent puzzle is that most of the efforts were concentrated in the study of @xmath15 and @xmath16 scattering , where the @xmath22 amplitude is hidden by the overwhelming @xmath21 amplitude .",
    "the most spectacular signature of the odderon is the predicted difference between @xmath15 and @xmath16 scattering at high @xmath0 and relatively small @xmath1 .",
    "however , it happens that , after the closure of isr , which offered the first strong hint for the existence of the odderon , there is no place in the world where @xmath15 and @xmath16 scattering are or will be measured at the same time .",
    "this is the main reason of the non - observation till now of the odderon .",
    "we show that we can escape from this unpleasant situation by performing a high - precision measurement of @xmath52 at rhic , at @xmath67 gev , and by combining these future data with the already present high - precision ua4/2 data at @xmath68 gev .",
    "there is no doubt about the theoretical evidence for the odderon both in qcd and cgc .",
    "the odderon is a fundamental object of these two approaches and it has to be found at rhic and lhc if qcd and cgc are right .",
    "i am grateful to professors claude bourrely and evgenij martynov who kindly repeated our calculations .",
    "this crosscheck proved to be very useful .",
