    "the analytical structure of the results for @xmath0-point feynman diagrams can be better understood if one employs a geometrical interpretation of kinematic invariants and other quantities .",
    "for example , the singularities of the general three - point function can be described pictorially through a tetrahedron constructed out of the external momenta and internal masses ( see fig .",
    "this method can be used to derive landau equations defining the positions of possible singularities @xcite ( see also in @xcite ) .    in ref .",
    "@xcite it was demonstrated how such geometrical ideas could be used for an analytical calculation of one - loop @xmath0-point diagrams . for example , in the three - point case in @xmath2 dimensions , the result can be expressed in terms of an integral over a spherical ( or hyperbolic ) triangle , as shown in fig .  1b , with a weight function @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the angular distance between the integration point and the point 0 , corresponding to the height of the basic tetrahedron ( see in @xcite ) .",
    "this weight function equals 1 for @xmath5 ( see also in @xcite ) . for @xmath6",
    ", one can get another representation @xcite , in terms of an integral over the volume of an asymptotic hyperbolic tetrahedron . here",

    "we will use notations defined in @xcite , namely : @xmath9 @xmath10 @xmath11 \\nonumber \\\\   & = & -{\\textstyle{1\\over4 } } \\lambda\\left(k_{12}^2,k_{13}^2,k_{23}^2\\right ) , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath12 assuming that all @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 , we get spherical triangles . in other cases , we need to use the hyperbolic space .",
    "the transition corresponds to the analytic continuation ( see below ) .    using the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite , we split the spherical triangle into three smaller ones ( see fig .",
