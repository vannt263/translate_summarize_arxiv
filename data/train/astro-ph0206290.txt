    "roughly half of this radiation is emitted outward and is observed directly ; the other half is emitted inward , where it is either reflected or absorbed by the white dwarf surface .",
    "in addition to radiative heating , the white dwarf surface can be heated by blobs of material which penetrate to large optical depths before thermalizing their kinetic energy . for a mass - accretion rate @xmath14 and a relative spot size @xmath15 , the white dwarf surface is heated to a temperature @xmath16  ev , hence produces a radiation spectrum which peaks in the euv .",

    "the state of our understanding of the _ euve _ spectra of polars as of mid-1998 is described by @xcite , who fit blackbody , pure - h stellar atmosphere , and solar abundance stellar atmosphere models to the phase - average _ euve _ spectra of nine polars with useful data in the archive . among the models tested , the blackbody parameterization gave the best fits to the data , with blackbody temperatures @xmath1725  ev and hydrogen column densities @xmath1820 . wishing to increase the number of polars with good signal - to - noise ratio euv spectra , in 1998 we obtained approval for a 130 ks _",

    "below we present the analysis of the euv light curves and spectra from both the original 1993 and the new 1999 _ euve _ observations of v834 cen .",
    "v834 cen ( nee e1405@xmath19451 ) is a well - studied polar with an orbital period @xmath20 minutes @xcite and the high ( @xmath21 ) and low luminosity states ( @xmath22 ) typical of this class of binaries .",
    "the magnetic nature of the white dwarf is demonstrated directly by the linear and circular polarization present in its high states @xcite and the zeeman absorption features and cyclotron emission features present in its low states @xcite , from which a magnetic field strength of 23  mg is inferred .",
    "the distance @xmath23 , white dwarf mass @xmath24 , binary inclination @xmath25 , and the colatitude @xmath26 and azimuth @xmath27 of the accretion spot are all uncertain at some level , but @xcite find @xmath28 pc based on a detection of the secondary in a near - ir spectrum ; @xcite find @xmath29@xmath30 based on fits of a _ ginga _ x - ray spectrum , @xcite finds @xmath31@xmath32 based on fits of an _ rxte _ x - ray spectrum , and @xcite use phase - resolved optical spectra to determine @xmath33 for @xmath34 ; @xcite advocates @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 based on values compiled from the literature .",

    "_ short wavelength ( sw ) spectrometer count rate and hardness ratio light curves , in  5 we present the mean and phase - resolved sw spectra , in  6 we provide a discussion and interpretation of these data , and in  7 we close with a summary of our results .",
    "for a description of the _ euve _ satellite and instrumentation , refer to @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "it is sufficient to note here that the bandpasses of the _ euve _ ds photometer and sw spectrometer are defined by a lexan / boron filter and extend from @xmath38 to @xmath39   , although , as we will see below , interstellar absorption extinguishes the euv flux of v834 cen longward of @xmath40   .",
    "the first _ euve _",
    "observation of v834 cen began on 1993 may 28.14 ut , ran for 1.40 days , and resulted in a total of 42 ks of exposure , while the second observation began on 1999 february 9.03 ut , ran for 5.46 days , and resulted in a total of 161 ks of exposure .",
    "the _ asca _",
    "observation began on 1999 february 9.96 ut , ran for 1.75 days , and resulted in a total of 58 ks of exposure .",
    "subsequent to the first observation , a procedure was established to increase the signal - to - noise ratio of _ euve _ spectra by dithering ( delightfully , to `` dither '' is to `` shiver '' or `` tremble '' ) the pointing position of the spacecraft , thereby moving the position of the spectrum on the face of the detectors and so average over quantum efficiency variations .",
    "the first part of the second observation was erroneously performed undithered , but after 0.84 days and 25 ks of exposure the spacecraft was reconfigured to spiral dither . unfortunately , there is no known record of the optical brightness of v834 cen at the time of the 1993 observation , but during the 1999 observation the source was in a high optical state with @xmath41 ( f.  m.  bateson 1999 , personal communication )    as is the case for all observations of short - period cvs by low - earth - orbit satellites , _",
    "observations of v834 cen are complicated by the similarity of the satellite s orbital period ( @xmath42 minutes ) to the binary s orbital period ( @xmath20 minutes ) .",
    "this situation is exasperated by the fact that _ euve _ takes data only for the @xmath43 minutes it is in earth s shadow .",
    "the result is that the binary phase advances by @xmath43% during each observing interval , but recedes by @xmath44% for each satellite orbit ( i.e. , @xmath451.0 , 0.630.93 , 0.560.86 , etc . ) .",
    "the net result is that all binary phases are sampled only after 11 satellite orbits or 0.72 days , while a full cycle is completed only after @xmath46 days .",
    "the 1993 _ euve _ observation spans less than two such intervals , while the 1999 observation spans nearly six .    to phase these data",
    ", we assumed the spectroscopic ephemeris of @xcite : @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the cycle number , @xmath49 is the blue - to - red zero crossing of the narrow component of the @xmath50 and h@xmath26 emission lines in optical spectra of v834 cen , and the numbers in parenthesis indicate the uncertainties in the last digits ; these errors result in a phase uncertainty of 0.02 ( 0.03 ) cycles at the midpoint of the 1993 ( 1999 ) _ euve _ observation .",
    "for ease of comparison , we note that sambruna et al .",
    "( 1991 , 1994 ) used the photometric ephemeris of @xcite to phase the _ exosat _ data , and at the midpoints of the 1984 , 1985 , and 1986 _ exosat _",
    "le + 3000 lexan observations and the 1993 and 1999 _ euve _ observations these ephemerides differ by @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 cycles , respectively .",
    "the ability of the schwope et al.ephemeris to phase the _ exosat _ and _ euve _ light curves confirms that that ephemeris is to be preferred .",
    "assuming the above ephemeris , the 1993 and 1999 background - subtracted ds count rate light curves are as shown in the upper two panels of figure  1 .",
    "there are clear differences between the 1993 and 1999 ds light curves of v834 cen , and although the _ euve _ light curves are similar to the 1986 and 1985 _ exosat _ le + 3000 lex light curves , respectively ( cf .  fig .  2 of @xcite ) , they also differ in significant ways . both the 1993 and 1999 _ euve _ light curves have a broad maximum peaking at binary phase @xmath56 , a narrow maximum peaking just before @xmath57 , a secondary minimum situated between the two maxima , and a strong asymmetric eclipse centered at @xmath58 .",
    "compared to the 1999 light curve , the 1993 light curve has a stronger narrow maximum and a narrower , more symmetric eclipse .",
    "conversely , the 1999 light curve has a more pronounced secondary minimum and a broader , more asymmetric eclipse .    for completeness , we show in the lower panel of figure  1 the _ asca _ x - ray light curve obtained simultaneously with the 1999 _ euve _ observation .",
    "this light curve , kindly provided to us by m.  ishida , is the summed count rate in the 1.510 kev bandpass of the two _ asca _ sis and gis detectors .",
    "the _ asca _",
    "light curve is seen to differ significantly from the _ euve _ light curves : it appears to consist of a double hump superposed on a constant background .",
    "the energy - resolved _ asca _ light curves of @xcite and @xcite show that the double hump is actually a broader feature cut at low energies by an asymmetric absorption feature , which , like the _ euve _ light curves , reaches minimum at @xmath58 .",
    "because v834 cen was a factor of approximately three times brighter in the euv during the 1999 observation , and because its brightness was observed to dim systematically throughout the observation , we subdivided the 1999 _ euve _ observation into six equal - length intervals spanning the length of the observation , and constructed the six independent ds light curves shown in figure  2 .",
    "modulo the overall decrease in the brightness of the source , the light curves from the various intervals generally follow the mean light curve .",
    "it is apparent from figure  2 that during the 1999 observation the eclipse was composed of a stable , narrow ( full width @xmath59 ) , full eclipse centered at @xmath58 , and a variable , broad , partial eclipse centered at @xmath60 .",
    "the largest differences between the various intervals occur at ( 1 ) @xmath61 , at the interface between the partial and full eclipses , ( 2 ) @xmath62 , on the decline from the narrow maximum ( compare the first and fifth panels of fig .",
    "2 ) , and ( 3 ) @xmath63 , in the detailed shape of the secondary minimum : it appears at some intervals that there is a separate narrow ( full width @xmath64 ) partial eclipse situated in the valley between the two maxima .",
    "the sw spectrometer supplies an independent measurement of the euv light curve of v834 cen , albeit with lower signal - to - noise ratio because of the instrument s smaller effective area and effectively higher background .",
    "mean background - subtracted sw count rate light curves were constructed in the same manner as those of the ds with the exception that flux was collected only over the band 75140   ; shortward of @xmath65    the background increases strongly and longward of @xmath66  there is very little source flux .",
    "the resulting 1993 ( 1999 ) mean sw count rate light curve is consistent [ @xmath67 ( @xmath68 ) ] with the corresponding mean ds count rate light curve after scaling the latter by a factor of 0.083 ( 0.079 ) .",
    "the upper panel of figure  3 shows the mean sw and ds count rate light curves from the 1999 observation .    to search for spectral variations associated with the variations in the count rate light curves , we constructed hardness ratio light curves by calculating the ratio of the background - subtracted sw counts from 7595    to that from 95140   .",
    "the break - point between the two bandpasses is arbitrary , but 95    was chosen because it gives roughly equal number of counts in the two bandpasses . as a compromise between phase resolution and signal - to - noise ratio , 40 phase bins were used to bin the 1999 observation , while the dimmer 1993 observation could stand no more than 10 .",
    "the 1993 hardness ratio light curve can be fit by a constant @xmath69 with @xmath70 , while the 1999 hardness ratio light curve , shown in the lower panel of figure  3 , is fit reasonably well by a sinusoidal function @xmath71 with @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , and @xmath75 .",
    "the fit is significantly improved ( @xmath76 ) even without changing the fit parameters if the isolated aberrant datum at @xmath77 is removed from the fit .",
    "the other significant deviations from the fit coincide with the partial eclipse at @xmath60 and the secondary minimum at @xmath63 .",
    "surprisingly , these deviations are _ downward _ , in the direction of softer spectra , contrary to the behavior expected from photoelectric absorption .",
    "ignoring for the moment the hardness ratio variation observed during the 1999 observation , we constructed mean sw spectra of v834 cen from the data obtained during the two epochs of observations .",
    "the analysis procedure was similar to that described in @xcite , but the spectra were constructed from the event data and , as above , care was taken to avoid intervals when ( 1 ) the background was high , ( 2 ) the source was occulted by earth , and ( 3 ) the sw detector was off .",
    "the spectra were binned up by a factor of 8 ( from @xmath78    to 0.539   ) to increase the signal - to - noise ratio , to match the spectral resolution of the sw instrument ( @xmath79   ) , and to remove the nonstatistical correlation between neighboring wavelength bins . to realize the full spectroscopic potential of the 1999 observation , data from only the dithered portion of that observation ( 136 ks of exposure starting on 1999 february 9.88 ut ) was used .",
    "the resulting mean background - subtracted sw spectra are shown in the upper panels of figure  4 , where the significantly higher quality of the 1999 spectrum is due to the three times longer exposure and three times higher mean count rate .",
    "the gross shape of these count spectra are similar , but apparent differences are masked by the effective area of the sw spectrometer , which peaks at 100    and falls off at both ends of the bandpass .    to determine if the differences between these spectra are significant , we fit the data with a simple model consisting of a blackbody extinguished at long wavelengths by photoelectric absorption .",
    "for the latter , we used the euv absorption cross sections of @xcite for , , and with abundance ratios of 1:0.1:0.01 , as is typical of the diffuse interstellar medium .",
    "table  1 lists the best - fit values and 90% confidence intervals of the parameters of these fits , the absorbed 70140    flux , and the fractional emitting area @xmath80 and luminosity @xmath81 assuming a fiducial white dwarf mass @xmath82 ( hence @xmath83 cm ) and a fiducial distance @xmath84 pc ( hence @xmath85 ^ 2=6.4\\times 10^{-24}$ ] ) .",
    "the fractional emitting area is defined as the area of a circular spot on the white dwarf with open angle @xmath86 , divided by the full area of the white dwarf : @xmath87 ; hence , the luminosity @xmath88 and the solid angle @xmath89 .",
    "the spectra of the best - fit models are shown superposed on the data in the upper panels of figure  4 , the residuals of the fits are shown in the lower panels of figure  4 , and the 68% , 90% , and 99% confidence contours of the fits are shown in the left panel of figure  5 . within the context of the absorbed blackbody model ,",
    "the mean spectra from these two epochs differ at the 90% confidence level , but figure  5 shows that this is due to only a minor variation in @xmath10 and/or @xmath11 .    to test the sensitivity of the fitted and inferred parameters to the assumed spectral model , we also fit the 1993 and 1999 mean sw spectra of v834 cen with that of an absorbed , pure - h , line - blanketed , nlte , @xmath90 stellar atmosphere . a grid of 25 such models was calculated with tlusty v195 ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) with temperatures distributed evenly in the log between 20 and 260 kk ( 1.722.4 ev ) ; for the @xmath91 calculations , off - grid spectra were determined by interpolation . with this model",
    ", we obtained the best - fit parameters and 90% confidence intervals listed in table  1 , and the 68% , 90% , and 99% confidence contours shown in the right panel figure  5 .",
    "as measured by @xmath92 , these fits are just as good as the blackbody model fits , and while the range of absorbing column densities is very similar , the temperatures are much lower and the fractional emitting areas and consequently the luminosities are significantly higher .",
    "this result is a consequence of the fact that the euv bump in the stellar atmosphere models contains a relatively small fraction of the total luminosity , so very large spot sizes and hence very large net luminosities are required to reproduce the observed euv fluxes .",
    "indeed , the spot sizes are so large that they violate the geometric limit @xmath93 over the region of parameter space shaded dark grey in figure  5 ; for the pure - h stellar atmosphere model to apply , the square of the angular radius must be significantly larger than the fiducial value of @xmath94 ( i.e. , v834 cen must be significantly closer than 100 pc ) .",
    "we next investigated the cause of the hardness ratio variation observed during the 1999 observation .",
    "as a compromise between phase resolution and signal - to - noise ratio , we accumulated spectra in two phase intervals centered on the minimum and maximum of the hardness ratio light curve : @xmath951.08 and @xmath960.58 , which we imaginatively call `` soft '' and `` hard , '' respectively .",
    "the resulting background - subtracted sw spectra are shown in the upper panels of figure  6 .",
    "we fit these data with the absorbed blackbody and stellar atmosphere models discussed above and obtained the best blackbody model fits and residuals shown in figure  6 , the best - fit parameters and 90% confidence intervals listed in table  1 , and the 68% , 90% , and 99% confidence contours shown in figure  7 . as with the mean 1993 and 1999 spectra",
    ", there is significant overlap in the fit parameters of the 1999 hard and soft spectra , but the strong correlation between the model parameters results in fits which are different at significantly greater than the 99% confidence level .",
    "the largest difference between the hard and soft spectra is in the absorbing column density ; indeed , for both models , the best - fit temperature of the hard spectrum is _ lower _ than that of the soft spectrum : within the context of these models , the hard spectrum is hard because it is more strongly absorbed .",
    "the differences between the blackbody and stellar atmosphere model fits to these data are similar to those of the 1993 and 1999 mean spectra : compared to the blackbody models , the stellar atmosphere models are far cooler , larger , and more luminous .",
    "again , the geometric constraint @xmath93 excludes the region of parameter space shaded dark grey in figure  7 .",
    "another constraint imposed on the models is the predicted value of the uv flux density .",
    "while simultaneous uv observations do not exist for either of our _ euve _ observations , v834 cen has been observed numerous times by the _ international ultraviolet explorer _",
    "( _ iue _ ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we extracted all of these spectra from the _ iue _ newly extracted spectra ( ines ) data archive ( http://ines.laeff.esa.es/ ) and determined that the maximum mean flux density in the nominally line - free bandpass at @xmath97   is @xmath98 .",
    "the intrinsic uv flux density will be larger than this value due to reddening , but unfortunately the amount of reddening is uncertain . given the upper limit of @xmath99 for the absorbing column density from the various fits to the _ euve _ spectra , a reasonable upper limit to the reddening should be @xmath100 , but from the _ iue _ spectra themselves @xcite inferred @xmath101 ; @xcite inferred @xmath102 at the 90% confidence level ; @xcite inferred @xmath103 ; whereas @xcite inferred @xmath104 .",
    "given this uncertainty , we consider the constraints imposed by the model uv flux densities for @xmath105 , 0.3 , and 0.1 assuming the extinction curve of @xcite with @xmath106 , as is typical of the diffuse interstellar medium .",
    "the regions of parameter space excluded by these constraints are shaded medium , light , and lighter grey , respectively , in figures  5 and 7 .",
    "note that the uv constrains severely constrain the range of parameter space allowed to the pure - h models .",
    "in the previous sections we have described the phenomenology of the euv light curves and spectra of v834 cen measured by _ euve _ in 1993 may and 1999 february . to help understand these data , we note the following , based on our general understanding of polars and the results from optical studies of v834 cen by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . ( 1 ) the binary inclination @xmath107 and the accretion spot colatitude and azimuth are respectively @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "( 2 ) in v834 cen only one accretion spot is visible for all orbital phases because the sum of the spot colatitude and binary inclination is less than @xmath110 . ( 3 ) because the binary inclination is greater than the spot colatitude , the accretion stream passes through the line of sight to the accretion region once per binary revolution . ( 4 ) the narrow and broad components of the optical emission lines of polars are understood to be due to , respectively , the heated face of the secondary and the base of the accretion stream . ( 5 )",
    "blue - to - red zero crossing of the narrow components of optical emission lines occurs at binary phase @xmath111 , placing the secondary ( white dwarf ) on the near ( far ) side of the binary at that phase .",
    "( 6 ) maximum blueshift of the broad components of optical emission lines occurs at @xmath112 , so at that phase the accretion stream points most directly toward us . ( 7 ) the linear polarization spike also occurs at @xmath113 , so at that phase the accretion column is on the plane of the sky .",
    "( 8) we expect that the accretion column will point most directly toward us approximately @xmath114 later , at @xmath115 .",
    "the circular polarization , euv , and x - ray light curves are all eclipsed near this phase because of the passage through the line of sight of the ( pre - shock ) accretion stream and ( post - shock ) accretion column .",
    "to illustrate these results , we constructed the graphic shown in the left panel of figure  8 , which includes the nominal position on the white dwarf of the accretion spot ( _ filled trapezoid _ ) ; the 1993 and 1999 ds light curves ( _ grey and black polar histograms , respectively _ ) ; and the phases of the maximum blueshift of the broad component of optical emission lines , the spike in linear polarization light curves , and the dip in circular polarization light curves .",
    "it is seen that the primary eclipse of the euv light curves occurs when the accretion spot points toward the observer , while the dip in circular polarization light curves appears to occur _ between _ the primary and secondary eclipses of the euv light curves .    to help envision the accretion geometry of v834 cen",
    ", we constructed a simple model , shown in the right panels of figure  8 , of the path of material from the secondary s inner lagrange point to the white dwarf surface in the vicinity of the upper magnetic pole .",
    "the model consists of the ballistic stream for a nonmagnetic semidetached binary and the field lines of a tilted magnetic dipole centered on the white dwarf for an orbital period @xmath116 minutes , mass ratio @xmath117 ( determining the trajectory of the ballistic stream ) , white dwarf mass @xmath118 ( determining the white dwarf radius @xmath119 cm ) , magnetic colatitude @xmath120 , and magnetic azimuth @xmath121 .",
    "field lines are drawn for azimuthal angles @xmath122 .",
    "if material in the ballistic stream makes it beyond @xmath123 , it will accrete preferentially onto the lower magnetic pole , hence disappears from consideration . in this simple model , the material lost by the secondary travels along the ballistic stream until it is threaded by the white dwarf magnetic field ; it then leaves the orbital plane and follows the magnetic field lines down to the white dwarf surface in the vicinity of the magnetic poles . in reality",
    ", the trajectory of the accreting material will be affected by the magnetic field and the magnetic field will be distorted by the accreting material ; our simple model is a first - order approximation of the path of the accreting material which ignores these complications .    in the right panels of figure 8",
    "we see that if material accretes onto the white dwarf from the full range of possible azimuthal angles , it will produce a long , thin , arc - shaped accretion region on the white dwarf surface at the footpoints of the magnetic field lines .",
    "details of the accretion region are more apparent in figure  9 , which shows the white dwarf and magnetic field lines for a binary inclination @xmath124 and binary phases @xmath125 ( @xmath1261.0 ) . for the assumed parameters",
    ", the accretion region extends about @xmath110 in azimuth and has a variable offset of about @xmath127 from the magnetic pole , determined by the varying distance ( a maximum of @xmath128 for @xmath129 and a minimum of @xmath130 for @xmath131 ) to the ballistic stream from the white dwarf .",
    "accretion along the @xmath132 field line ( the thick black curves in figs .  8 and 9 ) will produce an accretion spot at @xmath0 = [ 26^\\circ , 40^\\circ ] $ ] , consistent with the values advocated by @xcite ; the other model parameters are consistent with the radial velocity solution of @xcite .      whether a spot or an arc , the flux at earth from the accretion region will vary with binary phase because of the varying projected surface area of the accretion region and the phase - dependent obscuration by infalling material . ignore for the moment obscuration and consider the simplest possible model of the euv light curves of v834 cen , that of a small spot `` painted '' on the white dwarf surface : its projected surface area hence light curve varies as @xmath133 .",
    "such a simple model fails to reproduce even the upper envelope of the euv light curves of v834 cen , and although linear a superposition of such functions ( i.e. , multiple spots ) can reproduce some aspects of the data , the fits are not unique .",
    "consider next an empirical model , using the euv light curve of am  her @xcite as a template to explain the 1999 euv light curve of v834 cen .",
    "aligning the two light curves on the respective linear polarization ephemerides , the am  her light curve reproduces well the v834 cen light curve between binary phases @xmath1340.17 . by shifting the am  her light curve by @xmath135 , it reproduces well the v834 cen light curve between binary phases @xmath630.6 . from this exercise ,",
    "one is led to imagine that the euv emission region of v834 cen is composed of two spots separated in azimuth by about @xmath114 : the first spot produces the falling portion of the v834 cen light curve between @xmath1360.17 , while the second spot produces the rising portion of the light curve between @xmath630.6 ; the remaining portion of the light curve is affected by the primary and secondary eclipses .",
    "independent support for two accretion spots is provided by @xcite , who advocates two magnetic poles separated in azimuth by about @xmath137 to explain the occasional presence of two waves in the positional angle of the linearly polarized optical flux of v834 cen .",
    "such a two - spot model allows us to understand two features of the euv light curves of v834 cen .",
    "first , the secondary minimum at @xmath63 discussed in  3 can be understood as being the interface between the falling portion of the light curve of the leading spot and the rising portion of the trailing spot .",
    "second , the change between 1993 and 1999 in the relative strengths of the euv light curves between phases @xmath1380.17 and @xmath630.6 ( cf .",
    "the top panel of fig .",
    "1 ) can be understood if the leading ( trailing ) accretion spot was brighter in 1993 ( 1999 ) .",
    "unfortunately , this model predicts that the accretion spots lie at @xmath139 and @xmath56 , which appears not to be the case .",
    "these considerations teach us the folly of attempting to understand in detail the euv light curves of v834 cen ( or polars in general , see @xcite ) .",
    "returning to the discussion of the previous section , we expect that if the ballistic stream is threaded by the white dwarf magnetic field over a _ narrow _ range of azimuths , the infalling material will form a narrow stream leading down to a small spot on the white dwarf surface , whereas if the ballistic stream is threaded by the magnetic field over a _ broad _ range of azimuths , the infalling material will form an `` accretion curtain '' ( as it called in intermediate polars ) leading down to an extended arc on the white dwarf surface .",
    "narrow streams are implied by the optical eclipse studies of hu  aqr and uz  for by @xcite and @xcite , respectively , but an extended accretion region is invoked by @xcite in v834 cen to explain changes in the shape of the optical light curve and the changing morphology of the linear polarization and position angle curves .",
    "we propose that the euv light curves of v834 cen are explained by accretion over a narrow range of azimuths in 1993 and a broad range of azimuths in 1999 .",
    "specifically , we propose that in 1993 accretion was primarily along the @xmath140 field line , resulting in a narrow eclipse of a small accretion spot , while in 1999 accretion was more spread out in azimuth : the primary accretion channel remained the @xmath141 field line , but field lines @xmath142 further along the ballistic stream became active , resulting in the secondary eclipse observed at @xmath60 . happily , the proposed shift of the accretion rate further along the ballistic stream qualitatively explains the reduction in the relative strength of the euv light curve between @xmath1360.17 .",
    "what caused the changes in the accretion geometry between 1993 and 1999 ?",
    "one option is a higher accretion rate , since in 1999 the euv flux was approximately three times higher than in 1993 . another option is enhanced clumping of the flow , since greater clumping will result in magnetic threading over a broader range of azimuths _ and _ more efficient heating of the accretion spot as blobs of material crash into the stellar surface .",
    "although we have appealed to obscuration by the pre- and post - shock accretion flow to explain the primary and secondary eclipses in the euv light curves of v834 cen , figure  3 makes clear that this obscuration can not be due to photoelectric absorption .",
    "first , the amplitude of the sw hardness ratio variation is too small . assuming that the mean euv spectrum of v834 cen is an absorbed blackbody with @xmath143 ev and @xmath144 ( cf .",
    "table  1 and fig .",
    "7 ) , the sw hardness ratio equals 1.1 , as observed . doubling @xmath11 decreases the sw count rate by a factor of @xmath145 , but the sw hardness ratio increases by a factor of @xmath146 . in contrast , during the 1999 observation , the sw count rate varied by a factor of @xmath147 while the hardness ratio varied by only @xmath148% .",
    "similar results apply even if h and he are singly ionized , and only the bound - free opacity is left to absorb the euv flux from the accretion spot .",
    "it is actually quite easy to remove the photoelectric opacity of all these ions : in a collisionally ionized plasma , h is fully ionized for @xmath149 kk and he is fully ionized for @xmath150 kk . above that temperature ,",
    "only thomson opacity is available to reduce the euv flux , and an electron column density @xmath151 is required to reduce the euv flux by a factor of ten .",
    "second , the sw hardness ratio variation does not track the sw count rate variation . instead , at least during the 1999 observation ( see fig .  3 ) , the hardness ratio variation was sinusoidal , with a minimum ( maximum ) when the accretion spot was on the near ( far ) side of the white dwarf",
    ". evidently , as the accretion spot rotates to the far side of the white dwarf , its spectrum systematically hardens .",
    "figure  7 shows that the detailed spectral fits indicate that this change is best explained by decreasing @xmath10 _ and _ increasing @xmath11 , but within the 68% contours this can be accomplished simply by increasing @xmath11 , and within the 90% contours this can be accomplished simply by increasing @xmath10 .",
    "the last option implies that the accretion region is harder when observed at shallow viewing angles .",
    "this is the trend expected for an accretion spot subjected to irradiation by the million - degree plasma in the accretion column @xcite , although the affect is predicted to be small in the 75140    bandpass and the large ratio of hard to soft x - ray luminosities ( see below ) argues that irradiation does not dominate the energy deposition into the accretion spot .",
    "the mean 1993 and 1999 and the phase - resolved 1999 _ euve _ spectra of v834  cen can be fit by a blackbody or a pure - h stellar atmosphere model absorbed by a neutral hydrogen column density with the parameters listed in table  1 .",
    "compared to the blackbody models , the stellar atmosphere models are cooler , larger , and more luminous .",
    "in fact , as shown by figures  5 and 7 , the stellar atmosphere models are _ too _ big and _ too _ luminous ( too bright in the uv ) to explain the observations of v834 cen .",
    "first , the stellar atmosphere model fails to account for the euv spectrum acquired during the hard phase of the 1999 observation because the required angular size is larger than that of the white dwarf .",
    "second , the stellar atmosphere model fails to account for the mean 1999 euv spectrum because it produces too much flux in the uv unless the reddening @xmath152 .",
    "similar problems are met applying this model to other polars @xcite , so we conclude that the pure - h stellar atmosphere model can not in general explain the euv of these magnetic cvs .    finally , having _ simultaneously _ measured the euv and x - ray spectra of v834 cen in 1999 , we are in a position to determine the ratio of the luminosities of the accretion column and accretion spot .",
    "table  1 shows that the absorbed blackbody fit to the mean 1999 euv spectrum yields best - fit parameters @xmath4 ev , @xmath153 , fractional emitting area @xmath6 , 70140    @xmath7 , and luminosity @xmath8 . the averaged 210 kev flux measured by _",
    "asca _ was @xmath154 @xcite , implying @xmath155 , hence @xmath156 ( to within a factor of @xmath157 ) .",
    "this imbalance between the soft accretion spot and hard accretion column luminosities is the famous `` soft x - ray problem , '' and signals that some mechanism other than irradiation ( e.g. , blob heating ) dominates energy deposition into the accretion spot .",
    "we have described _ euve _ observations of v834 cen obtained in 1993 may and 1999 february .",
    "the 1999 data are superior to those obtained in 1993 because the source was approximately three times brighter , the observation was four times longer and dithered , and _ asca _ observed the source simultaneously .",
    "although we do not understand the euv light curves in detail , they are explained qualitatively by a simple model of accretion from a ballistic stream along the field lines of a tilted ( @xmath0\\approx [ 10^\\circ , 40^\\circ ] $ ] ) magnetic dipole centered on the white dwarf . in 1993 when the euv flux was lower , accretion was primarily along the @xmath1 field line , whereas in 1999 when the euv flux was higher , accretion took place over a broad range of azimuths extending from @xmath158 to @xmath3 .",
    "these changes in the accretion geometry could be caused by an increase in the mass - accretion rate and/or the clumpiness of the flow .",
    "the 75140   spectra are well described by either a blackbody or a pure - h stellar atmosphere absorbed by a neutral hydrogen column density , but constraints on the size of the euv emission region and its uv brightness favor the blackbody interpretation .",
    "the mean 1999 euv spectrum is best fit by an absorbed blackbody with temperature @xmath4 ev , hydrogen column density @xmath159 , fractional emitting area @xmath6 , 70140    @xmath160 , and luminosity @xmath161 .",
    "the ratio of the euv to x - ray luminosities is @xmath162 , signaling that some mechanism other than irradiation ( e.g. , blob heating ) dominates energy input into the accretion spot .",
    "the 1999 sw hardness ratio variation can be explained by minor variations in @xmath10 and/or @xmath11 , but instead of tracking the sw count rate variation , the hardness ratio variation was sinusoidal , with a minimum ( maximum ) when the accretion spot was on the near ( far ) side of the white dwarf , consistent with the trend expected for an atmosphere with an inverted temperature distribution .",
