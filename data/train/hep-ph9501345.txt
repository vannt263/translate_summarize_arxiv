    "the study of fluctuations and correlations in hadron production at high energies has found considerable interest in recent years .",
    "the @xmath3-particle inclusive densities @xmath4 or rather the factorial moments @xmath5 estimated in different phase space regions @xmath6 were studied in a variety of reactions ranging from @xmath7 to nucleus - nucleus scattering .",
    "the concept of intermittency has been introduced in order to describe enhanced fluctuations observed for individual events in the density distributions of hadrons ( for a recent review see @xcite ) .",
    "originally the definition of intermittency was the strict power laws of the normalized factorial moments taken as a function of bin size @xcite at small bin sizes ( self - similarity of the moments ) . later on it",
    "has become customary by calling intermittency any increase of the factorial moments with decreasing phase space intervals without regard to scaling behaviour .",
    "the extended version indicates just positive correlations in momentum space which increase at smaller bins .",
    "such an increase of factorial moments demonstrates that the multiplicity distributions become wider in small phase bins i.e. fluctuations are stronger .",
    "being important by itself , it shadows a crucial feature of the original proposal , namely , the search for self - similarity in the processes which could be related @xcite to the fractal structure of the pattern of particle locations in the three - dimensional phase space . therefore using the term `` intermittency '' in a wide sense here , we still keep in mind that the scaling regime is of primary interest .",
    "it gave name to the whole effect when was first proposed in study of turbulence @xcite .",
    "we shall discuss some possible sources of correlations .",
    "our main concern is to show that they contribute differently when the various projections of multiparticle phase space are considered .",
    "the proper choice of the variable can emphasize the particular correlation and , vice versa , conceal the contribution of others .",
    "therefore , by choosing _ different _",
    "variables we study the correlations of _ different _ origin weighted with _ different _ weights .    various explanations with different physical origin of correlations have been proposed .",
    "we shall discuss them in more detail in section 3 , but here let us just mention some of them .",
    "the analogy to turbulence has led in the original proposal to the term `` intermittency '' and to the phenomenological multiplicative cascade model of the phenomenon . on more strict grounds",
    ", it could be related to the _ parton _ shower in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) as described in section 3.5 .",
    "the observed phenomenon of _ hadron _ jets by itself indicates strong positive correlations .",
    "thus , the scaling regime could appear also at the stage of transition from partons ( quarks , gluons ) to the observable particles ( mostly hadrons )",
    ". therefore the ideas of phase transition have been elaborated too .",
    "even a more trivial dynamical reason could be connected with abundant production of resonances which , surely , imply the correlation of relative energies of final particles .",
    "some unknown sources of completely new dynamics have been looked for ( e.g. stochastic dynamics , instabilities etc . ) .    beside those `` dynamical '' effects",
    "there exists the well - known symmetry property of the interaction which necessarily contributes to the enhancement of correlations in small phase - space volumes .",
    "we mean bose - einstein correlations due to the symmetrization of the wave functions of identical particles .    in this review , we shall deal mostly with the problem of what and how the bose - einstein effect contributes to the observed increase of moments of multiplicity distributions in ever smaller phase space regions when various variables are chosen to tag the phase space bin .",
    "other topics , mentioned above , will be considered to the extent they are necessary for clarification of some issues related to our main purpose .",
    "bose - einstein ( be ) statistics leads to specific positive correlations of identical bosons ( in multiple production processes those are mainly like - charged pions ) .",
    "be correlations are stronger for particles having smaller difference of three - dimensional momenta .",
    "so be correlations lead to intermittency effect ( in the broad sense of the word ) .",
    "indeed it was first considered in @xcite , and was asserted a few years ago @xcite that be correlations may be responsible for the intermittency effect .",
    "however ineffective methods of the data analysis did not give a possibility to reach convincing conclusions that time .",
    "early investigation of the intermittency was concentrated on the study of one - dimensional rapidity dependence of the traditional factorial moments in decreasing rapidity intervals .",
    "then it was realized that intermittency effect in multiparticle production , if any , would naturally occur also in two and three dimensions when two or all three components of momenta of outgoing particles are registered .",
    "furthermore high - order inclusive density @xmath8 contains contributions from lower order correlations .",
    "being interested in genuine multiparticle correlations one is led to investigate ( connected ) correlation functions @xmath9 with lower order correlations subtracted ( the correlation function @xmath10 vanishes when a subgroup of @xmath11 particles is statistically independent from the other @xmath12 particles ) .",
    "the normalized factorial moment estimated in the phase space region @xmath6 is defined as @xmath13 where @xmath14 are called unnormalized moments .",
    "the normalization is chosen so that at integer ranks @xmath3 one gets @xmath15 for poisson distribution . in eq .",
    "( [ 1.1 ] ) @xmath16 is the differential momentum space volume @xmath17 or any other differential interval of interest . here",
    "@xmath6 will be used as a general notation for a selected phase space volume which differs for different selection procedures . in one - dimensional analysis",
    "this is usually the interval of rapidity @xmath18 or pseudorapidity @xmath19 where rapidity is defined as @xmath20 and pseudorapidity as @xmath21 with @xmath22 being the energy , the momentum , the longitudinal momentum and the angle of particle emission .    in practice ,",
    "an averaging over cells of the original phase space is performed , so that traditional normalized factorial moments in @xmath23 dimensions are determined as @xmath24 where the sum runs over @xmath25-dimensional boxes having the same size .",
    "self - similarity of the moments @xmath26 taken as a function of momentum cell size suggests a power law behaviour @xmath27 where @xmath28 are known as intermittency indices .",
    "general interrelation of the inclusive densities @xmath29 and the correlation functions @xmath10 is provided through the inclusive generating functional @xmath30=\\sum_{q=0}^{\\infty } \\frac { 1}{q!}\\prod_{j=1}^{q } \\int dp_{j}\\rho _ { q } ( p_1 , \\ldots , p_q ) z(p_1)\\ldots z(p_q ) ,   \\label{1.5}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 are auxiliary functions .",
    "the inclusive densities are then given by differentiation @xmath32 the correlation functions @xmath10 are defined through the generating functional @xmath33 in the following way ( cluster expansion ) : @xmath30=\\exp ( \\int dp_{1}\\rho _",
    "{ 1}(p)z(p)+\\sum _ { q=2}^{\\infty } \\frac { 1}{q ! } \\prod _ { j=1}^{q}\\int dp_{j}c_{q}(p_1,\\ldots , p_q)z(p_1 ) \\ldots z(p_q ) ) \\label{1.7}\\ ] ] being `` the exponents '' of the inclusive densities , @xmath34    a comparison of ( [ 1.5 ] ) and ( [ 1.7 ] ) leads to relationships @xmath35 etc , or the inverse ones : @xmath36 etc .",
    "let us note that the correlation functions have the above mentioned physical interpretation if the number of produced particles exceeds ( not clear a priori to what extent ) the order of the correlation function .",
    "integrated ( and normalized ) correlation functions are known as cumulant moments @xmath37 cumulants of poisson distribution are identically equal to zero .",
    "the generating function of the moments arises if one puts the functions @xmath31 in generating functional ( [ 1.5 ] ) to be a constant @xmath38 , @xmath39 the moments and particle number distribution @xmath40 can be found by differentiation of the generating function : @xmath41 relationships between factorial moments and cumulant moments follow from ( [ 1.12 ] ) or from ( [ 1.9 ] ) and ( [ 1.10 ] ) : @xmath42 for a fixed cell in momentum space .",
    "an averaging over cells , such as that in ( [ 1.3 ] ) , @xmath43 requires the corresponding averaging of eqs .",
    "( [ 1.16 ] ) .",
    "let us return to the intermittency study .",
    "the cumulant moments ( [ 1.17 ] ) , representing genuine multiparticle correlations , suffer from arbitrary binning and low statistics .",
    "the accuracy in the measurement of the factorial moments is also unsatisfactory for small bin sizes . that has led to investigation of more general density and correlation integrals which give the possibility to use the available statistics in an optimal way and to perform the correlation analysis in any convenient variable .",
    "the general density integral is defined as @xmath44 and the correlation integral as @xmath45 where the `` window function '' @xmath46 is determined to be nonzero in some prescribed interval of the @xmath3-particle phase space .",
    "the normalization to uncorrelated background is suggested in ( [ 1.18 ] ) , ( [ 1.19 ] ) : @xmath47 the general definitions ( [ 1.18 ] ) , ( [ 1.19 ] ) give a possibility not to split the @xmath3-particle phase space in an artificial way ( as it was the case in eqs .",
    "( [ 1.3 ] ) , ( [ 1.17 ] ) ) ensuring better statistics .",
    "this in turn gives a possibility to measure @xmath48 and @xmath49 for like - charged and unlike - charged particles separately providing direct evidence for the be correlations .",
    "the extensive review of experimental data is given in @xcite . here , we mention some typical findings which help us exemplify our treatment , especially , those which reveal be - contributions .",
    "consider first the one - dimensional analysis in rapidity variable .",
    "factorial moments ( [ 1.3 ] ) for like - charged particles were measured in @xmath50 and @xmath51 interactions at 250 gev / c by na22 collaboration @xcite .",
    "they are characterized by intermittency indices @xmath52 according to the fit @xmath53 though the bin size dependence turns out to be far from power - like in the whole interval measured , but it could be fitted by power laws separately at large ( @xmath54 ) and small ( @xmath55 ) bins .",
    "we remind that the latter region was suspected for such a law in original proposal ( see table 1 and fig .",
