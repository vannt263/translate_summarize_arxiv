    "a distribution of entanglement at distance is one of the essential challenges for the practical schemes of quantum communication such as quantum key distribution  @xcite and quantum secret sharing  @xcite .",

    "successful joint measurements are used to guarantee faithful entanglement sharing between distant parties  @xcite .",
    "we start with the assumption that two communication parties are far separate from each other .",
    "each of them prepares a bipartite entangled state independently , and sends one of the two qubits ( a traveling qubit ) to the middle location . after obtaining successful outcomes of a bell - state measurement ( bsm ) in the middle",
    ", an entangled state is successfully shared by the two separate parties . in practice , quality of the shared entanglement degrades because of the imperfection of channels and detections .",
    "a noise - resilient entanglement swapping scheme is thus important for practical quantum communication in a realistic lossy channel .",
    "the optical implementation has provided the best platform for practical entanglement swapping and many experiments have been demonstrated in discrete - variables ( dvs ) , e.g. , photon polarization entangled states  @xcite and vacuum - single - photon ( vsp ) entangled states  @xcite as well as in continuous - variables ( cvs ) , e.g. , squeezed states  @xcite and coherent states  @xcite . in this work ,",
    "our aim is to have the vsp entangled state , @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is a vacuum state and @xmath2 is a single photon state , shared by two distant parties .",
    "in fact , the vsp entangled state can be useful for quantum teleportation  @xcite , single - rail logic quantum computation  @xcite , and single - photon nonlocality tests  @xcite .",
    "a simple method of entanglement swapping for @xmath3 is performed with two vsp entangled states and an all - optical bsm .",
    "the traveling photons arrive at the middle location and are projected onto the vsp entangled states to build a bsm .",
    "this creates a maximally entangled state between two distant parties , for which we shall present details in section [ sec2-b ] .",
    "however , the success probability of a bsm is bounded by @xmath4 when using only linear optical elements  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , a bsm based on cv qubits and entangled coherent states can achieve a larger success probability over this limit @xcite .",
    "we shall thus attempt to use hybrid entanglement for entanglement swapping to obtain vsp entangled states shared by two distant parties .    in this paper",
    ", we are interested in utilizing hybrid entanglement in the form of @xmath5 where @xmath6 are coherent states with amplitudes @xmath7 .",

    "the ideal description of the photon number detection is a photon - number resolving ( pnr ) detector  @xcite given by the @xmath22-photon projectors @xmath23 . however , its implementation is in general very difficult and the pnr measurement consists in practice of many bss and several photon on - off detectors given by @xmath24 for spatial mode @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "a single - photon detector is described by @xmath26    alternatively , a reliable setup of homodyne detection is commonly used for cv photonic qubits and consists of a @xmath17 , a strong coherent field @xmath27 and two photodetectors @xcite .",

    "the success cases of the dv bsm are described by the two projection operators @xmath49 which can be performed by two single - photon detectors .",
    "each projection operator @xmath50 brings the final state of dv entanglement swapping as @xmath51 respectively .",
    "therefore , the outcome is also a maximally entangled state if the dv bsm has been successful performed .",
    "on the other hand , a photonic cv entanglement swapping is quite different from the dv case because the cv bsm with coherent - state qubits can be performed in a nearly perfect manner if photon number parity measurements are possible @xcite .",
    "namely , all four cv bell states @xmath52 where @xmath53 , can be discriminated using a 50:50 beam splitter and two pnr detectors because only one of the two detectors registers photon(s ) with a definite parity ( even or odd ) while the other registers no photon @xcite . even though there is a failure probability @xmath54  @xcite for which both the detectors are silent , this probability rapidly approaches zero as @xmath8 increases .",
    "thus , without photon losses during the channel transmissions , the cv entanglement swapping generally provides higher success probabilities than the dv entanglement swapping does although both the cases can give maximum entanglement . if pnr detectors for the cv bsm are unavailable",
    ", an efficient strategy particularly with small amplitudes is to use single photon detectors that discriminate between ` zero ' , ` one ' and ` two or more ' photon(s ) as those were used for the tele - amplification protocol  @xcite . in order to reflect more realistic conditions",
    ", we shall employ this method with single photon detectors for the cv bsm for our entanglement swapping scheme as depicted in fig .",
    "when channel losses are present , the parity measurement for cv qubits and the single - photon measurement for dv qubits suffer the defects of distinguishability and the resultant states become mixed states with less entanglement . to compare the degrees of entanglement of mixed states produced by different entanglement swapping schemes",
