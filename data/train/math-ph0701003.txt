    "we deal in this paper with the following question .",
    "question : :    given a unitary random matrix ensemble    @xmath8 defined on positive definite hermitian    matrices @xmath1 of size @xmath9 , where the    real analytic potential @xmath3 is such that the equilibrium    measure associated with @xmath3 has a density on    @xmath10 that vanishes like a square root at    @xmath4 .",
    "what are the scaling limits around @xmath4 of    the eigenvalue correlation kernel as @xmath5 ,    @xmath11 ?",
    "one expects a universality type result for this situation where the limiting kernels do not depend on the exact form of @xmath3 .",
    "this is in line with known universality results in the usual unitary random matrix ensembles of the form @xmath12 defined on all hermitian matrices @xmath1 of size @xmath9 , @xcite . in ( [ ensemble1 ] ) and ( [ ensemble2 ] ) and throughout the paper we assume that the confining potentials @xmath3 and @xmath13 are real analytic and satisfy @xmath14 the random matrix ensemble ( [ ensemble1 ] ) is restricted to positive definite matrices , thereby creating a hard edge at @xmath4 .",
    "this has an influence on the local eigenvalue behavior near @xmath4 since eigenvalues are always positive .",
    "it is well - known , see e.g.  @xcite , that the eigenvalue correlation kernel for the ensemble ( [ ensemble1 ] ) has the form @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the @xmath17-th degree orthonormal polynomial with respect to the weight @xmath18 on @xmath10 .",
    "the limiting mean eigenvalue density @xmath19 is the minimizer of the weighted energy @xmath20 taken over probability density functions @xmath21 supported on @xmath10 , see @xcite .",
    "it does not depend on @xmath22 . as @xmath3 is real analytic ,",
    "the support of @xmath23 consists of a finite union of intervals @xcite .     for @xmath24 with @xmath25 equal to @xmath26 ( left figure ) , @xmath27 ( middle figure ) and @xmath28 ( right figure ) .",
    "[ figure1],title=\"fig : \" ]   for @xmath24 with @xmath25 equal to @xmath26 ( left figure ) , @xmath27 ( middle figure ) and @xmath28 ( right figure ) .",
    "[ figure1],title=\"fig : \" ]   for @xmath24 with @xmath25 equal to @xmath26 ( left figure ) , @xmath27 ( middle figure ) and @xmath28 ( right figure ) .",
    "[ figure1],title=\"fig : \" ]    we can then distinguish two situations .",
    "the first is that @xmath4 does not belong to the support @xmath29 of @xmath23 .",
    "then the hard edge at @xmath4 does not lead to a new phenomenon .",
    "generically one finds that the eigenvalue correlation kernel ( [ kernel1 ] ) has the sine kernel @xmath30 as scaling limit in the bulk and the airy kernel @xmath31 as scaling limit at the ( soft ) edge points of @xmath29 .",
    "these are also the generic scaling limits for the correlation kernel associated with the matrix ensemble ( [ ensemble2 ] ) , see @xcite .",
    "the second situation is that @xmath4 belongs to @xmath29 . in that case ,",
    "one typically finds that @xmath23 is unbounded at @xmath4 with a square root type singularity at @xmath4 .",
    "then instead of the airy kernel we are led to a bessel kernel @xmath32 that describes the local eigenvalue correlations near @xmath4 , see @xcite .",
    "changing parameters in @xmath3 we may create a transition from the airy kernel to the bessel kernel .",
    "this happens for example if @xmath33 when considered on @xmath34 this is a shifted and scaled gue ensemble .",
    "for @xmath35 we have @xmath36.\\ ] ] these are all semi - circle laws which tend as @xmath37 to the semi - circle law on @xmath38 $ ]",
    ". then the left soft edge meets with the hard edge at @xmath4 . for @xmath39",
    "we have @xmath40,\\ ] ] with @xmath41 which has a square - root singularity at @xmath4 .",
    "see figure [ figure1 ] for the density @xmath42 for the values @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "thus our question asks about the transitional case .",
    "what happens when the soft edge meets the hard edge ?",
    "note that this transition from soft to hard edge is different from the one considered in @xcite where the authors start from a hard edge situation and let the parameter @xmath22 increase to infinity .",
    "other types of singular edge behaviors in unitary random matrix ensembles have been studied in @xcite , where a soft edge coincides with a spectral singularity , and in @xcite , where the limiting mean eigenvalue density vanishes faster than in the regular case .",
    "our question is related to the calculation of the so - called janossy densities for unitary random matrix ensembles @xmath46 in an asymptotic limit .",
    "indeed , it was shown in @xcite that the janossy densities for an interval @xmath47 are expressed in terms of the orthogonal polynomials for the weight @xmath48 restricted to the complement of @xmath49 . if @xmath23 vanishes like a square root at a left edge point @xmath50 , and if @xmath51 $ ] , then after linear scaling we can reduce this to the case @xmath52 , and then the janossy densities are expressed in terms of the orthogonal polynomial kernel ( [ kernel1 ] ) with @xmath53 .",
    "our first result is that there is indeed a one - parameter family of limiting kernels that depends on @xmath22 .",
    "[ theorem11 ] for every @xmath2 , there is a one - parameter family of kernels @xmath54 depending on @xmath55 , such that the following holds .",
    "let @xmath3 be real analytic on @xmath10 such that @xmath23 vanishes like a square root at @xmath4 and such that there are no other singular points in the external field @xmath3 .",
    "then there are positive constants @xmath56 and @xmath57 such that @xmath58 whenever @xmath5 such that @xmath59 and @xmath60 . the limit ( [ limitkernel ] ) holds uniformly for @xmath61 and @xmath62 in compact subsets of @xmath63 .",
    "see equation ( [ defc1vc2v ] ) below for explicit formulas for the constants @xmath64 and @xmath57 .",
    "we also refer to @xcite and section 3 below for the notion and the classification of singular points in an external field .",
    "in contrast to other works on universality , see e.g.  @xcite , we do not have to go through an explicit riemann - hilbert steepest descent analysis in order to prove theorem [ theorem11 ] .",
    "instead we prove theorem [ theorem11 ] by relating the random matrix ensemble ( [ ensemble1 ] ) to the random matrix ensemble ( [ ensemble2 ] ) defined on all @xmath9 hermitian matrices where @xmath65 and with @xmath22 replaced by @xmath66 .",
    "the equilibrium measure @xmath67 for ( [ ensemble2 ] ) vanishes quadratically at @xmath4 .",
    "the universal limiting kernels for this situation were found in @xcite .",
    "they are constructed out of @xmath21-functions associated with the hastings - mcleod solution of the painlev ii equation . using this connection we find the following representation for the limiting kernels @xmath54 .",
    "[ theorem12 ] let @xmath2 .",

    "the solutions of ( [ diffsystem ] ) are characterized by the asymptotic behavior @xmath76 as @xmath77 .",
    "[ remark1 ] the hastings - mcleod solution of ( [ painleve2 ] ) with @xmath78 was introduced in @xcite .",

    "is characterized by the asymptotic behavior @xmath83 as @xmath80 and @xmath84 as @xmath85 , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 11.7 ) .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the hastings - mcleod solution has no poles on the real line and so the system ( [ diffsystem ] ) is well - defined for every @xmath55 .",
    "note that @xmath86 satisfies @xmath87 and @xmath88 satisfies @xmath89 which are versions of the painlev xxxiv equation , see @xcite .    the functions @xmath69 and @xmath70",

    ". we will not use ( [ diffsystem2 ] ) in what follows . in @xcite ,",
    "a limiting kernel is obtained which is built out of solutions to the lax pair for painlev xxxiv as well . however , the relevant solution to painlev xxxiv in this paper is different from ours , and not related to the hastings - mcleod solution to painlev ii .",
    "[ remark2 ] the system ( [ diffsystem ] ) can also be considered for complex values of @xmath61 .",
    "the functions @xmath92 and @xmath93 have asymptotics in the complex @xmath61-plane given by @xmath94 uniformly as @xmath95 in the sector @xmath96 for any @xmath97 .",
    "the positive real line @xmath98 is an anti - stokes line for the system ( [ diffsystem ] ) , where the asymptotic behaviors ( [ falphaasymptotics ] ) and ( [ galphaasymptotics ] ) are not valid .",
    "as usual one has a two - term asymptotic approximation along the anti - stokes line which leads to ( [ realfalphaasymptotics ] ) and ( [ realgalphaasymptotics ] ) .    besides the eigenvalue correlation kernel , one might be interested in the limiting distribution of the ( re - scaled ) smallest eigenvalue of the ensemble ( [ ensemble1 ] ) .",
    "these distributions are given by fredholm determinants of the limiting kernels ( [ integrablekernel ] ) .",
    "for general @xmath22 we do not know if these kernels allow painlev expressions but for @xmath53 we can relate them to the well - known tracy - widom distribution @xcite @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the hastings - mcleod solution of painlev ii .",
    "indeed , since @xmath3 is real analytic on @xmath10 we can also consider @xmath3 on @xmath101 for some @xmath102 .",
    "for small enough @xmath103 the equilibrium measure associated with @xmath3 on @xmath101 will not depend on @xmath103 and it will vanish like a square root at @xmath4 .",
    "then for the ensemble ( [ ensemble1 ] ) with @xmath53 and defined on hermitian matrices with eigenvalues @xmath104 we have that the distribution of the smallest eigenvalue tends to the tracy - widom distribution ( [ twdist ] ) as @xmath105 .",
    "here we assume for convenience that @xmath106 ; otherwise under the assumption ( [ eq - limits ] ) we find a shifted version of ( [ twdist ] ) .",
    "moreover , denoting the smallest eigenvalue by @xmath107 we have for @xmath108 , @xmath109 here @xmath110 denotes the probability in the ensemble ( [ ensemble1 ] ) on positive - definite matrices , while @xmath111 is the probability in the ensemble ( [ ensemble1 ] ) on hermitian matrices with eigenvalues @xmath104 .",
    "hence for an appropriate constant @xmath112 we have if @xmath53 and @xmath106 , @xmath113 for @xmath114 , the right - hand side of ( [ cutofftw ] ) will be different , but the scaling with @xmath115 in the left - hand side will be the same .",
