    "left - handed metamaterials ( lhms ) , i.e. artificial composite structures with overlapping negative permittivity and permeability frequency bands giving rise to negative index of refraction @xcite , have attracted recently an exponentially increasing attention .",
    "the main reason behind this attention is mainly the novel physical phenomena associated with those materials ( negative refraction , opposite phase and energy velocity , reversed doppler effect etc ) , which result to new capabilities in the manipulation of electromagnetic waves .",
    "such an important capability is the superlensing capability of lhms @xcite , i.e. the ability to offer subwavelength resolution imaging , which can have important implications in many scientific , technological and every - day life areas , like imaging , microscopy , lithography , ultra - compact data storage , etc .",
    "since the demonstration of the first left - handed material@xcite , in 2000 , operating in the microwave regime , many left - handed ( lh ) structures have been created@xcite , and important efforts for the better understanding and the optimization of those structures have taken place . among the various efforts within the lhm research ,",
    "a large part has been devoted to the extension of the frequency of operation of lhms from the microwaves to the optical regime , where the superlensing - based applications can find an important ground for manifestation .",
    "these efforts led to metamaterials with negative permeability operating in the few thz regime already in 2004@xcite , which soon were followed by the first structures of negative permeability and/or negative index of refraction in the telecommunications regime and more recently in the lower visible regime .",
    "( for reviews of the existing research efforts on infrared ( ir ) and optical metamaterials see refs .",
    "@xcite . )    while the first and most of the existing microwave lhms are systems made of split - ring resonators@xcite ( srrs , i.e. interrupted metallic rings , giving rise to resonant loop - like currents , and thus to resonant permeability involving negative permeability values ) and continuous wires ( leading to the negative permittivity response@xcite ) , in most of todays high frequency lhms the srrs have been replaced by pairs of slabs ( or stripes , or wires)@xcite - see fig .",
    "like the srr , the slab - pair also behaves as a resonant magnetic moment element , where the magnetic moment is created by resonant currents , antiparallel in the two slabs of the pair , forming a loop - like current . in most of the experimentally realized optical slab - pair&wire structures",
    "the slabs are as wide as the corresponding unit cell side and are physically connected with the wires , leading to a design known as fishnet@xcite ( see fig .",
    "fishnet design was able to give the highest in frequency lhms up to now@xcite .",
    "the main reason behind the replacement of srr by the slab - pair for the high frequency metamaterials , apart of slab - pair simplicity in fabrication ( which is also a crucial parameter ) , is its ability to exhibit negative permeability response for incidence normal to the plain of the pair ; this makes possible the demonstration of the negative permeability response with just a monolayer of slab - pairs . indeed ,",
    "up to now most of the demonstrated `` magnetic '' metamaterials ( i.e. materials of resonant and negative permeability ) and lhms are single layers , while only few multilayer samples have been fabricated@xcite .",
    "( note that in the optical regime what is difficult to be achieved is the negative permeability component of a lhm , since the negative permittivity response can be easily obtained using metals ; that is why most of the existing efforts to go to the optical lhms start from attempts to achieve structures of only negative permeability . )    since many of the existing attempts to create high frequency magnetic metamaterials and lhms are based on the scaling down of known microwave designs , there are already efforts trying to determine the possibilities and the limitations of this scaling approach@xcite .",
    "( note that the properties of the metals , which are involved in most of todays metamaterials , are drastically different in the optical regime compared to microwaves - there , metals behave almost as perfect conductors . )",
    "most of those attempts concern srr systems and they have led to two important conclusions@xcite :    \\(a ) by scaling down a srr , the frequency of its resonant magnetic response does not continuously increase , but after some length scale it saturates to a constant value . this value was found to be dependent on the srr geometry employed , and with proper modifications of this geometry ( e.g. , adding gaps in the srr ) it could go up to a small fraction ( e.g. 20@xmath0 ) of the plasma frequency , i.e. to the middle visible range .",
    "the saturation response of the magnetic resonance frequency was explained taking into account the contribution of the kinetic energy of the electrons associated with the current inside the srr ring to the magnetic energy created by the loop current ( or , equivalently , taking into account the dispersive response of the metal in the conductivity ) .",
    "\\(b ) the magnetic permeability resonance becomes weaker and weaker by going to smaller length - scale srr systems , and below some length scale it ceases to reach negative values .",
    "this weakening of the permeability was attributed to the kinetic energy of the electrons ( giving rise to saturation ) in combination with the increased resistive losses in the metal as one goes to higher frequencies ; these losses are strengthened by the resonant response , implying long - time interaction of the wave with the metallic structures .",
    "although the existing studies are very revealing concerning the high frequency response of magnetic metamaterials , they examine the influence of the kinetic energy ( or the dispersive response of the metals ) only to the magnetic resonance frequency and not to other features of the resonant magnetic response ( like resonance shape and damping factor ) , neither clarified the role of the losses in the saturation of the magnetic resonance frequency .",
    "moreover , the role of the various geometrical parameters in the high frequency response of metamaterials still remains to be determined , as to identify the dominant parameters determining this response and to define optimization rules for those materials .",

    "4 , the operational band - width , which in larger scales is almost independent of the length scale , in smaller scales it is strongly reduced , ultimately going to zero for all designs .",

    "this bandwidth behavior will be discussed in the next section .",
    "since a main issue for the achievement of high frequency metamaterials of satisfactory performance is the losses , due to the increased resistive losses in the metallic components going to the optical regime , we performed a detailed analysis of the losses in high frequency metamaterials , trying to estimate which aspects of the high frequency metamaterial response are mainly affected by the resistive losses , and , consequently , to seek ways to minimize the influence of those losses , using proper design modifications .",

    "the fishnet design leads to the higher saturation frequency .",
    "moreover , while in the slabs&wires design the magnetic resonance frequency is almost unaffected by the presence of the wires , it is not the same in the fishnet design , where the saturation value is quite higher than the saturation value for the the slabs only case .",
    "\\(b ) the magnetic permeability resonance in sub-@xmath17 m scale structures becomes more and more weak by reducing the structure length - scale , and ultimately ceases to reach negative values .",
    "the length scale at which @xmath33 stops to exist depends on the structure geometry ( design ) and on the resistive losses in the component materials , especially in the metallic parts . among the structures that we have examined",

    "negative permeability at higher frequencies is achieved in the fishnet design .",

    "this width depends on the structure geometry and seems only slightly dependent on the resistive metallic losses .",
    "to understand and explain the results presented in the previous section , we use the common approach of describing the artificial magnetic structures ( at the resonant magnetic response regime ) as equivalent effective rlc circuits .",

    "( b ) with the consideration of the kinetic inductance the factor @xmath107 from scale independent ( if @xmath38 is negligible ) becomes scale dependent and tends to zero as the size of the structure becomes smaller and smaller ( @xmath117 ) .",
    "this means that even in the absence of ohmic losses , it would be impossible to get negative permeability values of band - width substantially larger than @xmath118 in arbitrarily small length scales .",
    "the scaling behavior of @xmath107 also implies that the relative bandwidth of the negative permeability regime , while it is maintained almost constant before the staring of the saturation ( see fig .",
    "4 ) , it becomes smaller and smaller deeper in the saturation regime , indicating that working before the saturation regime favors the widest bandwidth of each specific structure .",
    "the geometrical dependence of the factor @xmath107 for the slab - pair design can be easily obtained by substituting eqs .",
    "( [ eq8 ] ) to eq .",
    "( [ eq12 ] ) : @xmath119}.\\ ] ]    concerning the loss factor @xmath64 , from eq .",
    "( [ eq13 ] ) one can see that @xmath64 increases as the length - scale decreases , justifying the higher losses in the smaller length scales .",
    "this increase though does not continue up to the smallest scales , but beyond a length - scale it approaches a saturation value .",
    "the geometrical dependence of @xmath64 for the slab - pair design is obtained analogously with that of @xmath107 , as :    @xmath120    eq .",
    "( [ eq15 ] ) shows that the saturation value of @xmath64 is the collision frequency of the bulk metal as considered in the free - electron ( drude ) description of the metal@xcite .",
    "the saturation regime for @xmath64 is approached simultaneously with the magnetic resonance frequency saturation , showing that deep in the saturation regime the weakening of the resonance is not mainly the result of the ohmic losses but it is rather the result of the kinetic inductance ( affecting through the factor @xmath107 ) .    finally , it is important to point out that both @xmath64 and @xmath107 depend not only on the `` quality '' ( i.e. plasma frequency and damping factor ) of the metal used for the fabrication of metamaterials but also on the geometrical parameters of the structures ( see eqs .",
    "( [ eq14 ] ) and ( [ eq15 ] ) ) .",
    "this reveals the possibility to modify these factors , and thus to enhance the performance of the high frequency metamaterials , by modifying the geometry .",
    "from the analytical formulas and the discussion of the previous section it becomes clear that for achievement of optimized high frequency ( e.g. optical ) magnetic metamaterials one should require : ( a ) highest possible saturation value for the magnetic resonance frequency ; ( b ) larger possible parameter @xmath107 , determining the strength of the magnetic resonance and the width of the negative permeability regime ; ( c ) smallest possible loss factor @xmath64 .",
    "the general requirements for meeting the above conditions can be easily concluded based on eqs .",
    "( [ eq9 ] ) , ( [ eq12 ] ) and ( [ eq13 ] ) .",
    "they demand : structures of small capacitance , @xmath49 ; structures of small kinetic inductance @xmath38 , compared to magnetic inductance , @xmath36 ; structures of low resistance , @xmath20 . on the other hand ,",
    "the role of the magnetic field inductance is more puzzling : while low inductance facilitates the achievement of high magnetic resonance frequency , it results to `` lower - quality '' resonance , i.e. weaker resonance and higher losses ( compared to a higher inductance structure of the same length scale ) .",
    "thus , the inductance optimization should be based on the specific requirements for the designed metamaterial .    to translate the above optimization conditions to specific geometrical and material conditions for the slab - pair - based systems we can use eqs .",
    "( [ eq10 ] ) , ( [ eq14 ] ) and ( [ eq15 ] ) . from these equations can be concluded that optimized slab - pair - based systems are favored from structures of thick metal ( high @xmath121 ) and thick separation layer between the slabs of the pair ( i.e. high @xmath44 - not as high though as to cancel the interaction between the slabs ) ; also structures of wide slabs ( i.e. large width @xmath76 - to maximize the structure volume fraction @xmath122 appearing in eq . ( [ eq14 ] ) ) .",
    "moreover , high quality optical metamaterials demand metals of the highest possible plasma frequency and the lowest possible collision frequency .    the role of the slab - length is not one - way : while shorter slabs ( compared to the corresponding unit cell side ) facilitate high attainable magnetic resonance frequencies they lead to narrower negative permeability regime ( due to reduced @xmath122 in eq .",
    "( [ eq14 ] ) ) , and vice versa .",
    "finally , we should emphasize here that for enhanced metamaterial performance one should target operation below the saturation regime , as to ensure large negative permeability width and lower losses .      as was mentioned in the previous sections and can be easily concluded from eq .",
    "( [ eq9 ] ) , structures with reduced inductance lead to higher magnetic resonance frequencies .",
    "a structure based on slab - pairs which offers a considerable reduction in the inductance is the fishnet design - see fig .",
    "studies of this design in microwaves@xcite have revealed that at the magnetic resonance loop currents exist not only at the slab pair but also in the necks part of the metallic element .",
    "this neck contribution can be taken into account in an effective lc circuit description of the structure by considering an additional inductance , due to the necks , which is in parallel with the inductance of the slabs , resulting to a reduced total inductance , @xmath123 , with @xmath124 ( @xmath125 and @xmath126 represent the inductance of the slabs and the necks part respectively ; note that the @xmath125 here it is not exactly the same as that for the slab - pair - only system , due to the difference in the charge and current distribution between only - slab - pair systems and fishnet . )",
    "this reduced inductance leads to a magnetic resonance frequency @xmath127 i.e. higher than that of only the slabs .    by reducing the size of the structure down to submicron and nanometer scale",
    ", the inductance of both the slabs and the necks part gets a contribution from the kinetic ( electrons ) inductance .",
    "this contribution though does not modify the general relation ( [ eq - final ] ) , indicating the higher magnetic resonance frequency of the fishnet design than that of the component wide - slab - pair system even in the saturation regime .",
    "this higher attainable magnetic resonance frequency makes the fishnet design the preferential one for the achievement of optical metamaterials , something that has been already revealed from many existing experimental and theoretical works concerning optical metamaterials@xcite .    the relation ( [ eq - final ] ) , combined with eqs .",
    "( [ eq8 ] ) , can easily lead to a relation for the geometrical dependence of the magnetic resonance frequency for the fishnet , i.e. @xmath128 and thus for the saturation value of this magnetic resonance frequency . in eq .",
    "( [ eq - final2 ] ) @xmath129 and @xmath76 is the width of the neck and slab parts respectively ( along * h*-direction ) and @xmath130 is the lattice constant along the @xmath8 direction ( see fig .",
    "( [ eq - final2 ] ) suggests that for the achievement of high magnetic resonance frequency saturation values for fishnet , apart from the conditions for the optimization of the slab - pair components one should pursue also wide neck parts ; moreover , the wider the neck parts the higher the saturation value of the fishnet magnetic resonance frequency is .",
    "concerning the magnetic permeability expression for the fishnet , here the situation is more complicated compared to only - slabs systems , due to the more complicated current picture at the magnetic resonance@xcite . following the observations and conclusions of ref .",
    "@xcite , according to which the fishnet unit cell can be approximated with an rlc circuit with inductance of slabs and inductance of necks connected in parallel , the magnetic permeability for the fishnet can be calculated following the same steps as the ones presented in the previous section for the slab case , with modifications in the incident flux , the magnetic moment and the total inductance per unit cell :    here the incident flux , @xmath131 , can be written as @xmath132 , and the modified magnetic moment as    @xmath133,\\ ] ]    where @xmath134 and @xmath135 .",
    "the inductances @xmath125 and @xmath126 include both the magnetic field inductance and the electrons inductance for slabs and necks .    from eq .",
    "( [ eq - m - fishnet ] ) one can see already that the presence of the necks weakens the magnetic response of the structure , since the neck contribution in the magnetic moment opposes that of the slabs .    with the above considerations , the magnetic permeability for the fishnet design can be expressed as    @xmath136.\\ ] ]    comparing the above equation with eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) , one can observe that the factor multiplying the @xmath137 in the numerator , which is the main factor determining the spectral width of the negative permeability regime , becomes smaller than that of the slab only case ( @xmath107 ) .",
    "this can explain the reduced ( compared to only slabs ) spectral width of the fishnet negative @xmath17 regime observed in fig .",
    "in the previous sections we presented a simple rlc circuit model for obtaining qualitative results and optimizing the slab - pair - based metamaterial structures . it is important to note though that the relations ( 3)-(4 ) do not only have a qualitative power , but they can be used also to obtain quantitative results , if plugged with more accurate expressions for the capacitances and inductances involved .    here",
    "we will demonstrate this quantitative power of our relations in the case of the wide - slab - pair system . for wide - slab - pair systems ( @xmath138 ) and examining the fields and currents at the magnetic resonance frequency , one can use for the total capacitance of the system the capacitance of two identical parallel plate capacitors connected in - series , each of capacitance @xmath139 , and for the electrons inductance the same relation as in eq .",
    "( 9 ) , multiplied by 2 ( to take into account both slabs of the pair ) . the calculated magnetic resonance frequency obtained by using these relations",
    "is shown with the dotted - dashed line in fig .",
    "6 , and as can be seen there it is in excellent agreement with the magnetic resonance frequency obtained through realistic calculations .    using the same equations for the case of narrow slabs , one can see that they fail to describe accurately the scaling of the magnetic resonance frequency .",
    "in fact these equations predict no dependence of @xmath140 on the width of the slabs , unlike the observed in fig . 2 result , which shows lower magnetic resonance frequency for the narrower slabs .    to explain this discrepancy , we should point out that as the slabs become narrower eqs .",
    "( 9 ) for the capacitance and the magnetic field inductance become less and less accurate , and in the limit of @xmath141 they should be replaced by the corresponding expressions for parallel wire systems , i.e. @xmath142 , and @xmath143 . the last relations for @xmath36 and @xmath49 lead to lower magnetic resonance frequency saturation values",
    "compared to the ones predicted by the corresponding eqs .",
    "( 9 ) , in agreement with the numerical results presented in fig .",
    "in this paper we examine the magnetic response of resonant magnetic structures based on the slab - pair design , as the structures are scaled down from mm to nm scale .",
    "this response is examined using detailed numerical simulations for obtaining the frequency dependence of the magnetic permeability ( including its resonant behavior ) through reflection and tranmission data of realistic structures .",
    "it is observed , as expected , that the magnetic resonance frequency of the structures , while it scales inversely proportional to the structure length scale in the mm scale , it saturates to a constant value in the nano regime .",
    "this behavior depends on the design and it is independent of any ohmic losses in the structure . among our designs , higher saturation value is observed for the fishnet design .    the permeability resonance becomes weaker and weaker as we go deeper into sub-@xmath17 m scale , and ultimately it does not reach negative values .",
    "the relative spectral width of the negative permeability regime which in larger scales is almost scale independent , in sub-@xmath17 m scales it becomes smaller and smaller , approaching zero , and it has very slight dependence on the ohmic losses , while it shows strong dependence on the design , being quite narrow for the fishnet design .",
    "all the above results are explained through a simple rlc circuit model ; in the inductance , @xmath36 , the current - connected kinetic energy of the electrons is taken into account besides the magnetic field energy .",
    "this model is capable to determine optimization conditions for our structures , as to attain high magnetic resonance frequencies maintaining strong resonant response with a negative permeability region as wide as possible .",
    "the model explains also the superior performance of the fishnet design regarding high magnetic resonance frequency and its reduced performance regarding the width of the negative permeability region .",
    "finally , we show that our simple rlc circuit model is capable not only to predict qualitatively the behavior of our structures , but also to give quantitative results if it is accompanied by accurate formulas for the capacitance and inductance of the systems .",
