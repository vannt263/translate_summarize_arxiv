    "luminous infrared galaxies ( lirgs ) radiate the bulk of their large luminosities ( l@xmath7l@xmath8 ) as infrared dust emission @xcite .",
    "their large infrared luminosities indicate that powerful energy sources are present , hidden behind dust , which absorbs most of the primary energetic radiation , and the heated dust grains reemit this energy as infrared thermal radiation . since lirgs are the dominant population at @xmath9 1 , in terms of the cosmic infrared radiation density @xcite , determining whether starbursts ( i.e. , nuclear fusion inside stars ) are dominant , or whether active galactic nuclei ( agns ; active mass accretion onto a central compact supermassive black hole [ smbh ] with @xmath1010@xmath11m@xmath8 ) are also energetically important as obscured energy sources of lirgs , is closely related to unveiling the history of star formation and smbh growth in the dust - obscured galaxy population of the early universe .    unlike optically identifiable agns , in which the central mass - accreting smbhs are surrounded by a toroidally distributed ( torus - shaped ) dusty medium , lirgs , particularly those with l@xmath12",
    "@xmath10 10@xmath13l@xmath8 are major mergers of gas - rich galaxies @xcite and have a large amount of concentrated molecular gas and dust in their nuclei @xcite .",
    "the putative compact agns in lirg nuclei can be easily obscured by gas and dust in virtually all directions .",
    "thus , optical detection of agn signatures in lirgs becomes very difficult .",
    "however , evaluating the energetic importance of such optically elusive _ buried _ agns is crucial to understanding the true nature of the lirg population @xcite .    to investigate buried agns in dusty lirg nuclei",
    ", we must observe at wavelengths in which dust extinction effects are small .",
    "the ( sub)millimeter band is one such set of wavelengths , and the flux ratios of ( sub)millimeter molecular lines for agns have been suggested to be different from the ratios in starburst galaxies @xcite .",
    "for example , an enhancement of the hcn rotational ( j ) transition line flux , relative to other molecular lines , is argued in agns @xcite . if this is confirmed to be a general trend in agns , then ( sub)millimeter hcn emission lines can be used to identify deeply buried agns in dusty lirg nuclei . even if strong hcn emission is a feature of agns ,",
    "the interpretation is still not well established .",
    "hcn abundance enhancement @xcite could be a possible reason for strong hcn emission in agns .",
    "infrared radiative pumping of hcn has also been proposed as another possible mechanism for the increasing hcn emission flux @xcite .",
    "namely , an agn , powered by a mass - accreting smbh , has much higher radiative energy generation efficiency than the nuclear fusion reaction inside stars , can heat the surrounding dust to high temperatures of several hundred kelvin , and can emit a much stronger mid - infrared 320 @xmath14 m continuum ( relative to the bolometric luminosity ) than a starburst . by absorbing the infrared 14 @xmath14 m photons , hcn molecules can be vibrationally excited to the v@xmath2=1 level . through subsequent decay to the vibrational ground level ( v=0 ) , the hcn rotational ( j ) transition lines at v=0",
    "will be strong compared to collisional excitation alone @xcite . to determine whether this infrared radiative pumping scenario is generally and efficiently at work in agns , the detection of vibrationally excited hcn j - transition lines in agn - hosting galaxies is of particular importance , because the lines are expected to be strong in infrared radiative pumping , but not in collisional excitation .    to investigate whether hcn emission is indeed enhanced ( relative to other molecular lines ) in agns compared to starbursts , and to test whether vibrationally excited hcn emission lines are generally present in agns , we observed the hcn , hco@xmath0 , and hnc j=43 lines of nearby ( z@xmath150.35 ) luminous infrared galaxies , with and without luminous agn signatures , in alma cycle 0 . among six observed sources , the vibrationally excited hcn v@xmath2=1 j=43 ( l=1f ) emission line",
    "is tentatively detected in the luminous infrared galaxy iras 20551@xmath14250 at z=0.043 , which is diagnosed to contain a luminous buried agn ( table 1 ) .",
    "this is the second detection of this important line in extragalactic sources .",
    "we report this result in this paper . throughout this paper",
    ", we adopt h@xmath16 @xmath17 71 km s@xmath18 mpc@xmath18 , @xmath19 = 0.27 , and @xmath20 = 0.73 @xcite ,",
    "our alma cycle 0 observations were performed within the program 2011.0.00020.s ( pi = m. imanishi ) .",
    "table 2 provides the details of our observations .",
    "the widest 1.875 ghz band mode and 3840 total channel number were adopted .    at the redshift of iras 20551@xmath14250 ( z=0.043 ) , hcn j=43 ( rest - frame frequency is @xmath21 = 354.505 ghz ) and hco@xmath0 j=43 ( @xmath21 = 356.734 ghz ) lines can be simultaneously observed in alma band 7 .",
    "we employed four spectral windows , of which two were used to cover hcn j=43 ( central frequency was set as @xmath22= 339.890 ghz ) and hco@xmath0 j=43 lines ( @xmath22 = 341.835 ghz ) , and the remaining two were used to measure the continuum flux level ( @xmath22 = 351.883 ghz and 353.589 ghz ) .    to observe the hnc j=43 line ( @xmath21 = 362.630 ghz ) , we needed additional independent observations .",
    "we covered the hnc j=43 line in one spectral window ( @xmath23 = 347.680 ghz ) and used one more spectral window ( @xmath22 = 335.570 ghz ) to probe the continuum flux level .",
    "we started data analysis from calibrated data provided by the joint alma observatory .",
    "we first checked the visibility plots to locate the targeted emission lines .",
    "the presence of hcn , hco@xmath0 , and hnc j=43 lines was clearly recognizable in the visibility plots of individual spectral windows .",
    "in other spectral windows in which we intended to measure the continuum emission , signatures of emission lines were seen .",
    "we selected channels that were free of these emission lines to estimate the continuum flux level .",
    "we then subtracted this continuum level and performed the task `` clean '' for molecular line data .",
    "the `` clean '' procedure was also applied to the continuum data .",
    "we employed 40 channel spectral binning ( @xmath517 km s@xmath18 ) and 0.1@xmath24 pixel@xmath18 spatial binning in this clean procedure .",
    "figure 1 displays the continuum - a ( taken with the hcn and hco@xmath0 j=43 observations ) and continuum - b ( taken with hnc j=43 ) maps .",
    "the continuum emission properties are presented in table 3 . the contribution from thermal free - free emission in star - forming hii - regions to the observed continuum flux ( @xmath510 mjy ) at @xmath5345 ghz",
    "is estimated to be only @xmath53 mjy , from the far - infrared ( 40500 @xmath14 m ) luminosity ( table 1 ) , by using the equation ( 1 ) of @xcite and even assuming that the far - infrared luminosity is dominated by starburst activity , with no agn contribution .",
    "thus , we interpret that the detected continuum emission ( @xmath510 mjy ) at @xmath5345 ghz largely comes from dust emission heated by dust - obscured energy sources ( agn and/or starburst ) , with a small contribution from thermal free - free emission .    a full spectrum taken with our alma observations at the continuum peak position within the beam size",
    "is shown in figure 2 .",
    "although we targeted hcn , hco@xmath0 , and hnc j=43 emission lines , we clearly detected other emission lines that show peaks at the observed frequencies of @xmath25 = 353.88353.90 ghz and 334.96335.00 ghz based on gaussian fits . adopting a redshift of z=0.043 , their observed frequencies correspond to rest - frame frequencies of @xmath21 = 369.09369.12 ghz and 349.36349.41 ghz , which we attribute to h@xmath2s 3(2,1)3(1,2 ) ( @xmath21 = 369.101 ghz ) and ch@xmath3cn v=0 19(3)18(3 ) ( @xmath21 = 349.393 ghz ) with a possible contribution from cch v=0 n=43 j=7/25/2 ( @xmath21 = 349.400 ghz ) , respectively ( http://www.splatalogue.net ) , as seen in galactic molecular clouds @xcite . to our knowledge , ours is the first detection of these lines in extragalactic sources .",
    "h@xmath2s , ch@xmath3cn and cch emission lines , albeit at different rotational ( j ) transitions , were detected in the very nearby ( @xmath1520 mpc ) , bright starburst galaxies and agns @xcite .",
    "the serendipitous detection of these emission lines in iras 20551@xmath14250 at z=0.043 ( @xmath5190 mpc ) demonstrates the high sensitivity of alma .",
    "integrated intensity ( moment 0 ) maps of individual molecular lines are created , by combining channels with clearly discernible signals .",
    "these maps are displayed in figure 3 ( left ) , and their properties are summarized in table 4 .",
    "the molecular line peak positions agree with the continuum emission peak within 1 pixel ( 0.1  ) .",
    "spectra around individual detected molecular lines at the continuum peak position within the beam size are shown in figure 3 ( right ) . since continuum emission is well subtracted in the spectra , the moment 0 maps in figure 3 ( left ) should reflect the properties of individual molecular gas emission lines .",
    "the results of the gaussian fits for individual molecular lines are summarized in table 4 .",
    "figure 4 shows the intensity - weighted mean velocity ( moment 1 ) and intensity - weighted velocity dispersion ( moment 2 ) maps for hcn and hco@xmath0 j=43 lines .",
    "a rotating gas motion is seen such that gas in the northeastern ( southwestern ) region is redshifted ( blueshifted ) , relative to the nucleus , suggesting that the molecular gas emission is slightly spatially extended compared to the synthesized beam .",
    "in the spectrum of hco@xmath0 j=43 in figure 3 , a weak emission feature is seen at the higher velocity ( lower frequency ) side of hco@xmath0 . a magnified view of the spectrum around hco@xmath0 j=43 is shown in the right panel of figure 2 .",
    "the observed frequency of this weak emission peak is 341.51341.58 ghz ( based on gaussian fit ) , which corresponds to @xmath21 = 356.20356.27 ghz at z=0.043 .",
    "we attribute this weak line to the vibrationally excited hcn v@xmath2=1 j=43 ( l=1f ) emission line ( @xmath21 = 356.256 ghz ) .",
    "since the flux excess , with a peak of @xmath54.8 mjy , is seen in several consecutive spectral elements ( not one element ) , it is very unlikely that the excess feature is caused by a spike noise .",
    "we have carefully investigated the spectrum in figure 2 , and found that no spectral elements , other than the identified molecular lines , show fluxes exceeding 4 mjy ( 1@xmath6 noise level is @xmath51.2 mjy ) .",
    "since the observed peak frequency of this emission feature coincides with the expected frequency of hcn v@xmath2=1 j=43 ( l=1f ) and the observed peak position agrees with the continuum and other detected stronger molecular line peak positions , we judge that the hcn v@xmath2=1 j=43 ( l=1f ) emission feature is real .    this vibrationally excited hcn v@xmath2=1 j=43 ( l=1f ) emission line was recently detected in the external galaxy ngc 4418 @xcite .",
    "ngc 4418 is a very nearby luminous infrared galaxy ( l@xmath12 @xmath5 10@xmath26l@xmath8 ) at z=0.007 , and a luminous buried agn - type energy source with high emission surface brightness was found @xcite .",
    "however , based on only one example , determining whether the vibrational excitation of hcn in ngc 4418 was an exceptional case or not was impossible . from our discovery of this second extragalactic source , we can now show that hcn vibrational excitation is not exceptionally rare .",
    "since the hcn v@xmath2=1 j=43 ( l=1f ) line is only @xmath5400 km s@xmath18 away from the much brighter hco@xmath0 j=43 emission line at v=0 ( figure 3 , right ) , small hco@xmath0 j=43 line width is very effective to recognize the presence of hcn v@xmath2=1 j=43 ( l = 1f ) emission line , by clearly de - blending these emission lines .",
    "in fact , iras 20551@xmath14250 has the smallest molecular line widths among six lirgs observed in our alma cycle 0 program .",
    "we infer that the vibrational excitation of hcn may be common in agn - hosting galaxies , even though the detection of the hcn v@xmath2=1 j=43 ( l=1f ) line in galaxies with larger molecular line widths may be hampered by veiling from the overwhelmingly brighter hco@xmath0 j=43 emission line at v=0 .",
    "we estimate the flux of the hcn v@xmath2=1 j=43 ( l=1f ) emission line to be 0.39@xmath270.07 [ jy km s@xmath18 ] based on a gaussian fit ( table 4 ) .",
    "the hcn j=43 v@xmath2=1 ( l=1f ) to v=0 flux ratio is @xmath50.04 , which is a factor of @xmath55 smaller than the ratio observed in ngc 4418 @xcite .    in ngc 4418 ,",
    "the infrared 14 @xmath14 m hcn absorption feature was detected @xcite .",
    "@xcite estimated that the energy of the hcn v@xmath2=1 j=43 ( l=1f ) emission line was smaller than that of the 14 @xmath14 m absorption line and concluded that the observational results could be explained by the infrared radiative pumping mechanism .",
    "unfortunately , no meaningful constraint on the hcn 14 @xmath14 m absorption feature is placed for iras 20551@xmath14250 @xcite , so that further discussion is not possible . however , as discussed by @xcite , the energy level of hcn v@xmath2=1 ( l=1f ) level is e / k @xmath51000 k , which is very difficult to excite with collisions .",
    "infrared radiative pumping by absorbing infrared 14 @xmath14 m photons is the plausible scenario for the vibrational excitation of hcn .",
    "this mechanism should work effectively in an agn because infrared 14 @xmath14 m continuum is radiated strongly due to agn - heated hot dust emission .",
    "thus , detection of the vibrationally excited hcn j=43 emission line is expected more often in an agn than in a starburst galaxy . in fact",
    ", iras 20551@xmath14250 shows signatures of a luminous obscured agn , including the strong power - law 210 kev x - ray emission @xcite , the agn - type infrared 2.58 @xmath14 m spectral shape @xcite , and a higher emission surface brightness ( @xmath1010@xmath29 l@xmath8 kpc@xmath30 ) than would be sustained by star - formation activity @xcite .    to proceed with further quantitative discussion , it is desirable to observe the vibrationally excited v@xmath2=1 ( l=1f ) line at the j=32 and j=21 hcn transitions . also , hco@xmath0 and hnc have vibrationally excited v@xmath2=1 j=43 ( l=1f ) lines at @xmath21 = 358.242 ghz and 365.147 ghz , respectively , but these lines are outside the frequency range covered with our alma cycle 0 observations",
    ". measurements of the v@xmath2=1 j=43 ( l=1f ) lines of hco@xmath0 and hnc as well as at j=32 and j=21 are useful to comprehensively understand how infrared radiative pumping excites molecules to the vibrationally excited level and alters the strengths of the rotational ( j ) transition lines at v=0 in individual molecules .",
    "figure 5 is the plot of the hcn - to - hco@xmath0 j=43 and hcn - to - hnc j=43 flux ratios in iras 20551@xmath14250 .",
    "the ratios at four different positions in the starburst galaxy ngc 1614 , taken with our alma cycle 0 observations @xcite , are overplotted for comparison .",
    "iras 20551@xmath14250 shows a higher hcn - to - hco@xmath0 j=43 flux ratio than the starburst galaxy ngc 1614 .",
    "based on observations , hcn - to - hco@xmath0 flux ratios have been suggested to be small ( @xmath151 ) in starburst - dominated galaxies , but high ( @xmath101 ) in agns at j=10 @xcite . at j=43 , the hcn - to - hco@xmath0 flux ratio in iras 20551@xmath14250 is higher than the starburst galaxy ngc 1614 , but",
    "the absolute value is less than unity .",
    "since the critical density of hcn j=43 ( n@xmath31 @xmath5 2 @xmath32 10@xmath33 @xmath34 ) is higher than that of hco@xmath0 j=43 ( n@xmath31 @xmath5 4 @xmath32 10@xmath11 @xmath34 ) @xcite , hco@xmath0 j=43 is more easily excited than hcn j=43 , which could reduce the hcn - to - hco@xmath0 flux ratio at j=43 compared to lower j transitions .",
    "hcn - to - hco@xmath0 flux ratios higher than unity at j=43 or even higher transition are found in a high - redshift agn - dominated source , apm 08279@xmath355255 @xcite , and two nearby lirgs observed with our alma cycle 0 program ( imanishi et al .",

    ", it may be that ( 1 ) hco@xmath0 is more collisionally - excited to j=43 than hcn , and ( 2 ) the effects of infrared radiative pumping in hcn are relatively modest , as indicated from the lower hcn v@xmath2=1 ( l=1f ) to v=0 flux ratio than ngc 4418 . to determine the physical origin of the observed flux ratio and excitation condition",
