    "the earliest galaxies which ushered in the era of the cosmic dawn changed the state of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) out of which they formed in numerous ways : they polluted it with heavy elements , heated and ( re)ionized it , thereby affecting the evolution of all subsequent generations of galaxies .",
    "we are now in the golden era for the search for such galaxies , made possible by the use of ingenious selection techniques .",
    "the first of these , the standard dropout technique ( e.g. steidel et al .",
    "1996 ; giavalisco et al . 2004 ) relies on broad band filters to detect the lyman break at 912  in the galaxy rest frame .",
    "although galaxy candidates have been detected upto @xmath7 ( bouwens et al .",
    "2009 ) using this method , it has the drawback that the exact source redshift can not be determined with complete confidence . in this respect ,",
    "searches for the lyman alpha ( ly@xmath8 ) line at 1216  ( in the galaxy rest frame ) using narrow band filters have been far more successful in confirming the detection of high - redshift galaxies ; specific spectral signatures including the strength , width and continuum break bluewards of the ly@xmath8 line make the detection of laes ( galaxies showing a strong ly@xmath8 line ) rather unambiguous .",
    "narrow band searches have enabled the confirmation of hundreds of laes in a wide high - redshift range , at @xmath9 ( malhotra et al .",
    "2005 ; shimasaku et al . 2006 ) , @xmath10 ( e.g. kashikawa set al .",
    "2006 ) and @xmath11 ( e.g. vanzella et al .",
    "2010 ) . using the same technique , recently ,",
    "a lae , designated udfy-38135539 , has been confirmed at @xmath0 ( lehnert et al .",
    "2010 ) , making it the farthest astrophysical object known so far ; it has overtaken the redshift record of @xmath12 set by the gamma ray burst grb090423 ( salvaterra et al 2009 ; tanvir et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "this object has already been observed by a number of groups : lehnert et al .",
    "( 2010 ) have observed both the ly@xmath8 and ultraviolet ( uv ) luminosity for udfy-38135539 , and finkelstein et al .",
    "( 2010 ) have obtained broad band uv and spitzer data points for this galaxy , designated i d 125 in their work .",
    "however , the physical nature of the galaxy and the cosmological implications of its discovery have yet to be assessed . in this work ,",
    "we use state - of - the - art cosmological simulations coupled to a previously developed lae model ( dayal , ferrara & gallerani 2008 ; dayal et al .",
    "2009 ; dayal , ferrara & saro 2010 ) , tuned to reproduce a number of observables of laes , to bracket the physical properties of udfy-38135539 .",
    "we use the observed ly@xmath8 luminosity to get a hint on the ionization state of the igm at @xmath13 , calculate how much this galaxy could have contributed to reionization and make predictions for the number of lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) that could be detected in its vicinity .",
    "we start from the analysis of a @xmath0 snapshot of a set of cosmological simulations carried out using the treepm - sph code ( springel 2005 ) with the implementation of chemodynamics as described in tornatore et al .",
    "the periodic simulation box has a comoving size of @xmath14 and initially contains @xmath15 particles each of dark matter ( dm ) and gas .",
    "the masses of the dm and gas particles are @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively . for each `` bona - fide '' galaxy ( which has at least 20 bound particles ;",
    "see saro et al .",
    "2006 for details ) in the simulated volume at @xmath18 , we compute the dm halo / stellar / gas mass , star formation rate ( sfr ) , mass - weighted age , gas / stellar metallicity , and gas temperature . the adopted cosmological model for this work corresponds to the @xmath19cdm universe with @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 km s@xmath2 mpc@xmath2 and @xmath23 , thus consistent with the 5-year analysis of the wmap data ( komatsu et al .",
    "complete details of these simulation runs can be found in dayal et al .",
    "( 2009 ) .",
    "star forming galaxies produce their intrinsic ly@xmath8 line and uv continuum luminosities ( @xmath24 and @xmath25 , at restframe wavelengths @xmath26   and @xmath27  , respectively ) both via stellar ( and nebular ) emission , and cooling radiation from collisionally excited neutral hydrogen ( ) in their interstellar medium ( ism ) . while the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) are obtained using the population synthesis code starburst99 ( leitherer et al .",
    "1999 ) to calculate the stellar and nebular emission , the latter depends on the temperature distribution in the ism gas .",
    "the interested reader is referred to previous work ( dayal , ferrara & saro 2010 ) for a comprehensive discussion .",
    "as ly@xmath8 and continuum photons are efficiently absorbed by dust grains , we calculate the dust content of each galaxy by considering snii to be the main dust producers ; this is justified by the fact that the typical evolutionary time - scale of evolved stars ( @xmath28 gyr ) becomes longer than the age of the universe above @xmath29 ( todini & ferrara 2001 ) .",
    "we further pose that : ( i ) @xmath30 of dust is produced per snii ( todini & ferrara 2001 ; nozawa et al .",
    "2007 ) , ( ii ) snii destroy dust in forward shocks with an efficiency of about 40% ( mckee 1998 ; seab & shull 1983 ) , and ( iii ) a homogeneous mixture of gas and dust is assimilated into further star formation . to calculate the dust optical depth , @xmath31 , to uv continuum photons , based on the results obtained at @xmath32 , we assume that dust is made up of carbonaceous grains and spatially distributed as the stars ( dayal , ferrara & saro 2010 ) .",
    "the fraction of continuum photons escaping the galaxy undamped by dust is then @xmath33 . the analogous quantity for ly@xmath8 photons",
    "is taken to be @xmath34 so as to obtain the _ maximum possible _",
    "ly@xmath8 luminosity emerging from the galaxy itself .      after escaping out of the galactic environment , ly@xmath8 photons",
    "are further attenuated as they travel through the igm . depending on the intergalactic hydrogen ionization state , only a fraction @xmath35 of the ly@xmath8 photons emerging out of a galaxy undamped by dust reaches the observer ( continuum photons are instead unaffected by the igm ) ; @xmath36 hence depends upon the igm ionization state .",
    "since this value is largely unconstrained , we explore 6 different values of the average igm fraction at @xmath0 : @xmath37 . for each value of @xmath38",
    ", we compute the nominal radius , @xmath39 , of the spherical , ionized hii region around each simulated galaxy . in reality , though , due to source clustering ( i.e. when the separation between any two galaxies becomes smaller than either of their ionized region radii ) , multiple galaxies can contribute ionizing photons to the same ionized region , which will then be characterized by an _",
    "effective _ radius , @xmath40 , calculated as follows .",
    "suppose galaxies ` a ' and ` b ' , and ` b ' and ` c ' have overlapping ionized regions .",
    "then , the effective ionized volume ` a ' is embedded in is the sum of the ionized volumes of ` a ' , ` b ' and ` c ' ; the same holds true for both ` b ' and ` c ' . within this ionized volume , the total photoionization rate at distance @xmath41 from ` a ' ,",
    "is @xmath42 where the terms on the right hand side represent the photoionization rate from ( i ) the direct radiation from ` a ' , ( ii ) the galaxies clustered around ` a ' and ( iii ) the ultraviolet background ( uvb ) from distant galaxies , respectively .",
    "the uvb photoionization rate is related to @xmath38 by @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the mean igm hydrogen number density and @xmath45 is the case - b hydrogen recombination coefficient .",
    "further , @xmath46 , is the specific ionizing luminosity emerging from ` a ' and @xmath47 is the escape fraction of ionizing photons ( gnedin et al .",
    "2008 ) , @xmath48 is the ionizing luminosity emerging from the @xmath49 galaxy of the total ` n ' galaxies with which ` a ' shares an ionized region , @xmath50 is the frequency corresponding to the lyman limit wavelength ( 912  ) , @xmath51 is the hydrogen photoionization cross - section and @xmath52 is the distance between galaxies @xmath53 and ` a ' .",
    "this procedure is carried out for each galaxy in the simulated volume .",
    "we then assume photoionization equilibrium to compute @xmath38 within the effective ionized region of each galaxy . at the edge of this region , we force @xmath38 to attain the assigned global value .",
    "we use the complete voigt profile to calculate the optical depth of ly@xmath8 photons along the line of sight to compute @xmath36 . the observed ly@xmath8 and uv continuum luminosity are then simply @xmath54 ( the latter equality descends from our maximal assumption @xmath34 ) , and @xmath55 , respectively .    as a final step , we select galaxies that would be observable as laes according to the canonical criterion , @xmath56 _ and _ observed equivalent width @xmath57  . among these , we further isolate those that fall within the @xmath58 and continuum magnitude @xmath59 range observed by lehnert et al .",
    "( 2010 ) and finkelstein et al .",
    "( 2010 ) : using sinfoni , the former find @xmath60 , @xmath61 to @xmath62 , while finkelstein et al .",
    "( 2010 ) find a tighter bound of @xmath63 to @xmath64 .",
    "to summarize , all simulated galaxies that have @xmath60 and @xmath63 to @xmath64 and designated as lae@xmath65 in this work .",
    "we now discuss the main results obtained from the above mentioned computations .",
    "we find that , without requiring any tuning of the model parameters , _ no _ lae@xmath65 are found in the simulated volume for @xmath66 . for @xmath67 , we find a total of 215 laes in the simulated volume , 7 of which are identified as lae@xmath65 as shown in fig .",
    "1 . from now on , lae@xmath65 refer to the laes in the combined observed ly@xmath8 and uv luminosity range of lehnert et al .",
    "( 2010 ) and finkelstein et al .",
    "( 2010 ) for @xmath68 .",
    "we digress here to discuss the two main ingredients whose combined effects can change the slope of the @xmath69 relation shown in fig .",
    "the first of these concerns the dust attenuation : for any given lae , an increase ( decrease ) in @xmath70 leads to the galaxy becoming brighter ( fainter ) in the uv , shifting the position of the galaxy vertically upward ( downward ) on the plot ; a decrease in the value of @xmath71 ( recall that we have used @xmath34 in our model ) due to dust attenuation of ly@xmath8 photons leads to a corresponding decrease in @xmath58 , moving the points horizontally leftward on the plot .",
    "the second effect is the change in @xmath36 due to peculiar velocities : inflows ( outflows ) of neutral gas into ( from ) the galaxy impart an extra blueshift ( redshift ) to the ly@xmath8 photons , leading to a decrease ( increase ) in @xmath71 ( santos 2004 ; verhamme et al .",
    "2006 ; dijkstra & wyithe 2010 ; dayal , maselli & ferrara 2011 ) moving the relation horizontally towards the left ( right ) .",
    "further constraints on the lae@xmath65 come from the seds which we have obtained from including dust attenuation ( @xmath70 ranges between 0.24 - 0.3 for the lae@xmath65 ) using the supernova extinction curve ( bianchi & schneider 2007 ) . as shown in fig .",
    "2 , the model seds are in excellent agreement with the observed data points , including the two from spitzer at @xmath72 and @xmath73 m obtained by finkelstein et al .",
    "the sed is a crucial constraint on the physical properties of galaxies that could be identified as lae@xmath65 : although for values of @xmath74 ( for the given dust model ) a larger number of galaxies would fulfill the lae@xmath65 selection criterion , their physical properties can not vary too much without the seds becoming inconsistent with the observed one .    as the 7 lae@xmath65 galaxies closely resemble the observed properties of udfy-38135539 , it is reasonable to conclude that their physical properties should also match those of that object , which are now discussed .",
    "lae@xmath65 show sfrs in the range @xmath75 , as seen from panel ( a ) of fig .",
    "these values are quite comparable to the ones inferred by lehnert et al .",
    "( 2010 ) from the ly@xmath8 luminosity of udfy-38135539 ( @xmath76 ) .",
    "lae@xmath65 have stellar masses @xmath77 , ( fig .",
    "3 , panel ( b ) ) ; this is highly consistent with the stellar mass of @xmath78 found by finkelstein et al . ( 2010 ) from best - fitting the observed sed . in terms of the halo mass , lae@xmath65 correspond to rare , massive @xmath79 mass fluctuations at @xmath0 and have halo masses @xmath80 .",
    "the lae@xmath65 have dust masses between @xmath81 as seen from panel ( c ) of fig .",
    "3 . these lead to values of @xmath82 for these galaxies , which translate into @xmath83 magnitude , which is in excellent agreement with the best fit value of @xmath84 magnitude derived by finkelstein et al . ( 2010 ) for udfy-38135539 .",
    "lae@xmath65 have ages between 50 - 80 myr ( see panel d ) , in good agreement with the value of 10 to a few 100 myr inferred observationally by lehnert et al .",
    "these ages imply that the progenitors of these galaxies started forming as early as @xmath85 .",
    "the stellar metallicity of lae@xmath65 is 0.03 - 0.12 @xmath86 ( see panel e ) , even at @xmath0 ; since heavy elements are the main constituents of grains , this is an additional argument in support of the dusty nature of these galaxies .",
    "indeed dust seems to be required by the measured colors .",
    "for the 7 lae@xmath65,@xmath87 ranges between @xmath88 physical mpc ( pmpc ) , as shown in panel ( f ) , leading to an igm transmission of @xmath89% .",
    "if the effects of clustered sources is neglected , the nominal individual ionized bubble radius is @xmath90 pmpc , which makes @xmath91 12% , rendering these galaxies undetectable in the ly@xmath8 ; the effect of source clustering is _ crucial _ for making these galaxies visible as laes .",
    "although the galaxies clustered around the 7 lae@xmath65 are too faint to be seen in the ly@xmath8 , nonetheless their uv continuum can be bright enough to be detectable via standard dropout techniques . in fig .",
    "4 we show the probability ( at limiting magnitude @xmath92 ) of such clustered galaxies . averaged over the 7 lae@xmath65 , there is a 70% and 15% probability of jwst and hst / wfc3 ( with limits of @xmath93 and @xmath94 respectively ) finding such a clustered galaxy in a radius @xmath6 pmpc ( or 86 arcsec ) at @xmath0 .    as for the contribution of lae@xmath65 to reionization",
    ", the photon rate density required to balance recombinations , @xmath95 , can be expressed as ( madau , haardt & rees 1999 ) @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the igm clumping factor . for the 2% hi ionizing photon",
    "escape fraction used in this work and assuming @xmath98 , the lae@xmath65 have an hi ionizing photon output @xmath99 ; at most , such objects could have contributed @xmath100 of the photons needed to balance recombinations at @xmath0 .",
    "finally , we estimate the probability of finding a lae like udfy-38135539 in the experimentally sampled volume ( @xmath101 ) .",
    "our simulated volume ( @xmath102 ) is about 100 times larger ; therefore we sample the simulated volume by randomly placing the observed volume within it .",
    "we find that only 7 of these sub - volumes contain 1 lae similar to udfy-38135539 for @xmath67 .",
    "this translates into a detection probability of only about 7% , classifying the discovery as a relatively serendipitous one .",
    "we have constrained the igm ionization state at @xmath0 .",
    "we find that without requiring any fine - tuning of the model parameters from @xmath103 and for the maximum possible ly@xmath8 luminosity emerging from the galaxy itself , _ no _ lae are found in the observed luminosity range of udfy-38135539 for @xmath104 .",
    "for @xmath68 , we find 7 laes ( designated lae@xmath65 ) whose observed ly@xmath8 and uv luminosity fall in the ranges of udfy-38135539 ( lehnert et al .",
    "2010 ) and i d 125 ( finkelstein et al . 2010 ) .",
    "lae@xmath65 are observable in the ly@xmath8 _ only _ because an overlapping of their regions with those of their nearby galaxies make the effective radius @xmath105 pmpc ; averaged over the 7 lae@xmath65 , there is a 70% ( 15% ) probability of such a clustered source being found by jwst ( hst / wfc3 ) observations .",
    "we have also bracketed the physical properties of udfy-38135539 : the sfr range between @xmath106 , it has @xmath107 of stars with a mass weighted age of 50 - 80 myr and a mass weighted stellar metallicity between @xmath108 .",
    "it is dust enriched with dust masses @xmath109 which translates into @xmath83 mag and a color excess of @xmath110 using the supernova dust extinction curve .",
    "we add three caveats .",
    "the first concerns uncertainties related to dust attenuation of ly@xmath8 photons . as has been shown by many works ( neufeld 1991 ; hansen & oh 2006 ; finkelstein et al .",
    "2008 ; dayal et al . 2009 ; dayal , ferrara & saro 2010 ; dayal , maselli & ferrara 2011 ) , the relative escape fraction of ly@xmath8 and continuum photons depends on the distribution ( smooth / clumpy ) of dust in the ism of high-@xmath111 galaxies .",
    "lacking data at @xmath112 to support either of the two possibilities , here we have used the maximum value of @xmath34 .",
    "secondly , an increase ( decrease ) in the escape fraction of ionizing photons ( @xmath113 ) would decrease ( increase ) the intrinsic ly@xmath8 luminosity , while increasing ( decreasing ) the sizes of the regions built by each galaxy , thereby affecting the observed ly@xmath8 luminosity .",
    "thirdly , outflows might allow ly@xmath8 photon transmission also from a substantially more neutral igm ( dijkstra et al .",
    "2011 ) than the upper limit of @xmath104 found here .",
    "although interesting , such result has been obtained under the highly idealized conditions of a smooth , spherically symmetric expanding shell of hi gas , whose radius and column density have been tuned to suitable values . as it is very likely that shell fragmentation occurs as a result of raleigh - taylor and kelvin - helmholtz instabilities arising from the complex gas velocity field around the galaxy ( e.g. see fig . 2 of fangano et al .",
    "2007 ) , such suggestion needs to await more detailed investigations .",
