    "qcd calculations at next - to - leading order can be done in a style in which all of the integrations over loop three - momenta are done numerically . in this method ,",
    "in particular , the integrations for virtual loop diagrams are performed numerically instead of analytically .",
    "the method works well in feynman gauge @xcite when applied to three - jet - like observables in electron - positron annihilation ( _ eg . _",
    "the three jet cross section ) .",
    "feynman gauge is the simplest gauge from a calculational point of view .",
    "however , it is unphysical in that unphysical gluon polarizations propagate into the final state .",
    "the contributions from unphysical polarizations cancel when one sums over graphs . however , we have in mind applications in which one wants to go beyond a pure next - to - leading order calculation by incorporating , in an approximate way , some effects at all orders in @xmath1 .",
    "( we have in mind , for instance , renormalon and parton showering effects . ) for such applications , one must approximate , and the presence of unphysical degrees of freedom propagating over long distances makes it difficult to see what approximations to apply . the remedy is simple : do the calculation in a physical gauge , such as coulomb gauge .    in this paper",
    ", we develop the apparatus needed for applying the numerical integration method in coulomb gauge . for the most part , this is straightforward : one should simply replace the feynman gauge feynman rules by the coulomb gauge feynman rules .",
    "however , two point functions and three point functions need a special treatment ( in any gauge ) . three point one loop virtual subgraphs need a special treatment because they are ultraviolet divergent .",
    "the modified minimal subtraction ( ) prescription to calculate in @xmath2 space dimensions and remove poles is not useful for numerical integrations .",
    "thus one must convert the  subtraction to an equivalent subtraction defined in exactly 3 dimensions .",
    "( four point subgraphs with all gluon legs need renormalization too , but such subgraphs do not occur in the applications that we have in mind , so we omit consideration of them . )",
    "the two point one loop virtual subgraphs need a special treatment because they need renormalization .",
    "they also need a special treatment for another reason .",
    "let @xmath3 be the one loop quark self - energy function .",
    "then when the self - energy attaches to a quark line that enters the final state , we need @xmath4 evaluated at @xmath5 .",
    "we need to express @xmath3 as a numerical integral , but we need to do it in such a way that the _ integrand _ for @xmath6 is finite at @xmath5 .",
    "the integral will then have a logarithmic infrared divergence , but this infrared divergence will be cancelled by a corresponding divergence in the graph with a cut self - energy diagram .",
    "the same consideration applies to the gluon propagator .",
    "this paper will also serve to document the methods needed to treat two - point subgraphs and three - point virtual subgraphs even in feynman gauge .",
    "these methods were discussed briefly in @xcite but the details were left to unpublished notes @xcite that accompany the associated computer code @xcite .",
    "we have implemented the methods described in this paper in a computer program @xcite .",
    "the code is based on the feynman gauge code described in @xcite . in its default mode , the program acts as a next - to - leading order monte carlo event generator , generating three and four parton final states with corresponding weights .",
    "suppose , for example , one wishes to calculate the expectation value of @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the thrust of each event and @xmath9 is fixed . to do this ,",
    "a separate subroutine calculates @xmath7 for each event , multiplies by the corresponding weight , and averages over events . as in other programs of this type",
    ", the weights can be positive or negative .",
    "the user can specify either feynman or coulomb gauge for the calculation .",
    "although the graph - by - graph contributions are very much gauge dependent , the net results are the same for the two gauges .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows .",
    "we begin in sec .",
    "[ sec : style ] with a brief review of the main structure of a next - to - leading order calculation by numerical integration . then in sec .",

    "sec : cutquarkstructure ] , [ sec : realquarks ] , and [ sec : virtualquarks ] we turn to the one loop quark self - energy . in sec .",
    "[ sec:3pointrenormalization ] , we examine the renormalization of three point functions in coulomb gauge . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] , we present some results from the computer program that implements the formulas from this paper .",
    "appendix [ sec : appendix ] contains formulas for feynman gauge that correspond to the coulomb gauge formulas of the main body of the text .",
    "the idea of this paper is to make the numerical method for next - to - leading order qcd calculations work in coulomb gauge . before beginning this task ,",
    "we need to outline the numerical method itself , which works in any gauge .",
    "we present a sketch only since the details can be found in refs .  @xcite .",
    "besides the matter of the gauge choice , there is one difference between the computer algorithms presented here and those of refs .",
    "@xcite : here we wish to calculate the complete observable at next - to - leading order , that is the sum of the contributions proportional to @xmath10 and @xmath11 , rather than just the coefficient of @xmath11 .",
    "this is a rather trivial change , but it affects the way the problem is set up below .",
    "we wish to calculate an observable @xmath12 with the following structure @xmath13 we work in the @xmath14 c.m .",
    "frame and @xmath15 is the c.m .   energy .",
    "axis of our coordinate system .",
    "thus we can calculate typical event shape variables like the cross section to make three jets , but not correlations between a jet direction and the beam axis .",
    "however , nothing in the general methods used here prevents one from removing this simplification . ]",
    "the observable @xmath12 has been normalized by dividing by the born level cross section @xmath16 for @xmath17 .",
    "the quantity @xmath18}$ ] is the cross section to make @xmath9 massless partons . in defining this cross section",
    ", we treat all @xmath9 partons as identical and thus divide by @xmath19 .",
    "the functions @xmath20 are the measurement functions that define the observable @xcite .",
    "they are symmetric under interchange of any of their variables and have the property of infrared safety : @xmath21 for @xmath22 .",
    "typically the functions @xmath20 are dimensionless , but we do not assume that here .",
    "we are concerned with three - jet - like quantities , which means that @xmath23 , so that the smallest value of @xmath9 that contributes is @xmath24 .",
    "we work in next - to - leading order perturbation theory , so that there are at most four partons in the final state .",
    "thus the sum over @xmath9 runs over @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the parton level cross sections contain delta functions , which we make explicit by writing @xmath27 the function @xmath28 depends on the momenta and on @xmath1 , which we evaluate at a scale @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is a dimensionless parameter of order 1 .",
    "the order @xmath0 contributions contain logarithms of @xmath31 and thus of @xmath15 , so we have indicated a separate dependence on @xmath15 .",
    "the dependence of @xmath32 on the dimensionless parameter @xmath30 is left implicit .",
    "thus we write @xmath12 as @xmath33 the energy conserving delta function would create problems in a numerical integration , so we get rid of it by the following strategy .",
    "we introduce a factor 1 written as @xmath34 where @xmath8 has the dimensions of time and @xmath35 is any convenient smooth function whose integral is 1 .",
    "we change integration variables in the momentum integrals to dimensionless variables @xmath36 dimensional analysis gives @xmath37 thus @xmath38 now we can use the integration over @xmath8 to eliminate the energy - conserving delta function . denoting @xmath39 we have @xmath40    eq .",
    "( [ integrationstruct ] ) is implemented as an event generator .",
    "events with @xmath9 partons with scaled momenta @xmath41 are generated along with a weight equal to @xmath42 in eq .",
    "( [ integrationstruct ] ) divided by the density of points in @xmath43 space .",
    "a separate routine then multiplies the weights by the measurement function @xmath44^{1/2},\\dots , \\vec p_n[{s / s}]^{1/2}\\right)$ ] and takes the average of these results over a large number of generated points .",
    "two features are especially worth noting in the main part of eq .",
    "( [ integrationstruct ] ) , that is in every part other than the measurement functions .",
    "first , the true momentum variables have been replaced by dimensionless variables @xmath41 .",
    "second , the energy conserving delta function has been replaced by @xmath45 , so that the dimensionless energy @xmath46 is not fixed . the true c.m .",
    "energy @xmath15 appears in only one place , in the argument of @xmath1 . in this calculation",
    ", we are using the massless theory .",
    "however , if one wanted to add quark masses @xmath47 , then the functions @xmath28 in eq .",
    "( [ integrationstruct ] ) would depend on additional dimensionless parameters @xmath48^{1/2}\\,m_i$ ] .",
    "then the c.m .",
    "energy @xmath15 would appear in the argument of @xmath1 and in these dimensionless mass parameters .",
    "the contribution @xmath49 to @xmath50 proportional to @xmath0 can be expressed in terms of cut feynman diagrams , as in fig .",
    "[ fig : cutdiagrams ] .",
    "( in this section , we consider diagrams that do not have self - energy subdiagrams , since self - energy diagrams require a special treatment . )",
    "the dots where the parton lines cross the cut represent the function @xmath20 .",
    "each diagram is a three loop diagram , so we have integrations over loop momenta @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "( [ integrationstruct ] ) lacks an energy conserving delta function , so we have integrations over four energies , which we might take to be loop energies @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 chosen in the same way as the loop momenta and the energy @xmath57 entering the graph on the vector boson line .",
    "we first perform the energy integrations .",
    "for the graphs in which four parton lines cross the cut , there are four mass - shell delta functions @xmath58 .",
    "these delta functions eliminate the three energy integrals over @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 as well as the integral over @xmath57 . for the graphs in which three parton lines cross the cut",
    ", we can eliminate the integration over @xmath57 and two of the @xmath59 integrals .",
    "one integral over the energy @xmath60 in the virtual loop remains . to perform this integration , we close the integration contour in the lower half @xmath60 plane .",
    "this gives a sum of terms obtained from the original integrand by some simple algebraic substitutions in which @xmath60 is replaced by a location @xmath61 of one of the poles in the lower half @xmath60 plane .",
    "then we do the same thing except that we close the integration contour in the upper half @xmath60 plane . finally , we take the average of these results .",
    "( for well behaved integrands , these two contributions are the same , but in coulomb gauge some of the integrands are not so well behaved , as we shall see . )    having performed the energy integrations , we are left with an integral of the form @xmath62 here there is a sum over graphs @xmath63 ( of which one is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : cutdiagrams ] ) and there is a sum over the possible cuts @xmath30 of a given graph . the problem of calculating @xmath49 is now set up in a convenient form for calculation .",
    "if we were using the ellis - ross - terrano method for doing next - to - leading order calculations @xcite , we would put the sum over cuts outside of the integrals in eq .",
    "( [ master ] ) . for those cuts",
    "@xmath30 that have three partons in the final state , there is a virtual loop .",
    "we can arrange that one of the loop momenta , say @xmath51 , goes around this virtual loop .",
    "the essence of the ellis - ross - terrano method is to perform the integration over the virtual loop momentum analytically , while the remaining integrations are performed numerically .",
    "the integration over the virtual loop momentum is often ultraviolet divergent , but the ultraviolet divergence is easily removed by a renormalization subtraction .",
    "the integration is also typically infrared divergent .",
    "this divergence is regulated by working in @xmath64 space dimensions and then taking @xmath65 while dropping the @xmath66 contributions ( after proving that they cancel against other contributions ) .",
    "after the @xmath51 integration has been performed analytically , the integrations over @xmath52 and @xmath53 can be performed numerically . for the cuts @xmath30 that have four partons in the final state , there are also @xmath66 infrared divergences .",
    "one uses either a `` phase space slicing '' or a `` subtraction '' procedure to isolate these divergences , which cancel the @xmath66 pieces from the virtual graphs . in the end , we are left with an integral @xmath67 in exactly three space dimensions that can be performed numerically .    in the numerical method",
    ", we keep the sum over cuts @xmath30 inside the integrations .",
    "we take care of the ultraviolet divergences by simple renormalization subtractions on the integrand .",
    "we make certain deformations on the integration contours so as to keep away from poles of the form @xmath68 $ ] , where @xmath69 is the energy of the final state and @xmath70 is the energy of an intermediate state .",
    "then the integrals are all convergent and we calculate them by monte carlo numerical integration .",
    "let us now look at the contour deformation in a little more detail .",
    "we denote the momenta @xmath71 collectively by @xmath72 whenever we do not need a more detailed description .",
    "thus @xmath73 for cuts @xmath30 that leave a virtual loop integration , there are singularities in the integrand of the form @xmath74 ( or @xmath75 if the loop is in the complex conjugate amplitude to the right of the cut ) . here",
    "@xmath69 is the energy of the final state defined by the cut @xmath30 and @xmath70 is the energy of a possible intermediate state . for the purpose of this review ,",
    "all we need to know is that @xmath76 on a surface in the space of @xmath51 for fixed @xmath52 and @xmath53 if we pick @xmath51 to be the momentum that flows around the virtual loop .",
    "these singularities do not create divergences .",
    "the feynman rules provide us with the @xmath77 prescriptions that tell us what to do about the singularities : we should deform the integration contour into the complex @xmath51 space so as to keep away from them .",
    "thus we write our integral in the form @xmath78 here @xmath79 is a purely imaginary nine - dimensional vector that we add to the real nine - dimensional vector @xmath72 to make a complex nine - dimensional vector .",
    "the imaginary part @xmath80 depends on the real part @xmath72 , so that when we integrate over @xmath72 , the complex vector @xmath81 lies on a surface , the integration contour , that is moved away from the real subspace .",
    "when we thus deform the contour , we supply a jacobian @xmath82 .",
    "( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details . )",
    "the amount of deformation @xmath80 depends on the graph @xmath63 and , more significantly , the cut @xmath30 . for cuts @xmath30 that leave no virtual loop , each of the momenta @xmath83 , @xmath84 , and @xmath85 flows through the final state . for practical reasons ,",
    "we want the final state momenta to be real .",
    "thus we set @xmath86 for cuts @xmath30 that leave no virtual loop . on the other hand ,",
    "when the cut @xmath30 does leave a virtual loop , we choose a non - zero @xmath80 .",
    "we must , however , be careful . when @xmath86 there are singularities in @xmath87 on certain surfaces that correspond to collinear parton momenta .",
    "these singularities cancel between @xmath87 for one cut @xmath30 and @xmath87 for another .",
    "this cancellation would be destroyed if , for @xmath72 approaching the collinear singularity , @xmath86 for one of these cuts but not for the other . for this reason , we insist that for all cuts @xmath30 , @xmath88 as @xmath72 approaches one of the collinear singularities",

    "all that is important here is that @xmath89 quadratically with the distance to a collinear singularity .",
    "much has been left out in this brief overview , but we should now have enough background to see what to do in coulomb gauge .",
    "it might seem that all we have to do is use the feynman rules in coulomb gauge , but there are some questions associated with the two and three point subdiagrams that need a special analysis .",
    "we now turn to that analysis , beginning with a description of a momentum space coordinate system that is useful for the two point subdiagrams .",
    "most of our effort will be devoted to the gluon and quark one loop self - energy diagrams . in these diagrams ,",
    "we begin by performing the integration over the loop energy by contour integration .",
    "this leaves an integration over the loop three - momentum .",
    "we will be greatly helped by expressing the components of the loop momentum in terms of three appropriately chosen variables @xmath90 .",
    "these variables are defined by considering , instead of the virtual self - energy graph , the corresponding cut self - energy graph .",

    "for such applications , one must approximate , and the presence of unphysical degrees of freedom propagating over long distances makes approximation difficult . a straightforward remedy is to do the calculation in a physical gauge , such as coulomb gauge . in this paper",
    "we have seen how this goal can be accomplished .",
    "it is useful to have at hand the formulas for feynman gauge that are analogous to what we have found in coulomb gauge .",
