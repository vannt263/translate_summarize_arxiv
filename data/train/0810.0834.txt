    "the investigation of electron - electron interactions in half - metallic ferromagnetic heusler compounds is an important issue in order to understand the strong temperature dependence of spin polarization of these materials .",
    "one of the key parameters in this context is the magnetic exchange constant ( in the following simply referred to as exchange constant ) which describes the strength of the exchange interaction between two spins inside a ferromagnetic system .",
    "brillouin light scattering ( bls ) spectroscopy from standing spin - waves in thin magnetic films is a well - established technique for the study of exchange interaction in various material systems @xcite .",
    "however , the application of this experimental technique for the determination of exchange constants in thin films of heusler compounds presents some difficulties , which , as will be discussed in this article , are mostly related to an ambiguity in the assignment of the measured mode frequencies to the correct standing spin - wave mode orders .",
    "the goal of this article is to show in detail how the values of exchange constants are determined from the bls spectra measured on thin films of heusler compounds as well as to discuss the difficulties in the extraction of the exchange constants from the experimental data .",
    "for this purpose , we present bls studies of co@xmath0mnsi films in this article .    in the following , we briefly describe the investigated co@xmath0mnsi films and the determination of the exchange constant by means of bls .",
    "thereafter , the experimental results of bls studies performed on co@xmath0mnsi thin films are presented , and a procedure leading to the correct mode assignment is discussed .",
    "the investigated co@xmath0mnsi films with thicknesses @xmath5 , 30 , 40 , 60 and were epitaxially grown on a mgo(100 ) substrate covered by a thick cr(100 ) buffer layer . for the deposition of the co@xmath0mnsi layers , inductively coupled plasma - assisted magnetron",
    "sputtering was employed . a post - growth annealing at provided co@xmath0mnsi films with a predominant l2@xmath6 order , which was confirmed by x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) measurements .",
    "the films were covered by a thick al protective layer to prevent sample oxidation .",
    "the bls measurements presented in this article were performed at room temperature in the magneto - static surface mode geometry where the magnetic field @xmath7 is applied in the plane of the sample and perpendicular to the plane of light incidence i.e.  perpendicular to the transferred wave vector @xmath8 of the detected magnons .",
    "a diode pumped , frequency doubled nd : yvo@xmath9 laser with a wavelength of @xmath10  nm was used as a light source .",
    "a detailed description of the bls setup used in this work can be found for example in refs .",
    "the bls spectra of co@xmath0mnsi films with varying thickness @xmath11 were recorded both at different values of the external magnetic field @xmath7 and at different angles of incidence of the probing light beam @xmath12 , i.e. , the angle between the direction of the incident laser beam and the film normal .",
    "the former is necessary to confirm the magnonic origin of peaks , whereas the latter allows for the detection of spin waves with different transferred wave vectors @xmath8 ( @xmath13 ) . as will be shown later on in this article ,",
    "@xmath8 dependent measurements of bls spectra are required for an unambiguous separation of the dipole dominated magnetostatic surface wave , also called damon - eshbach mode ( de ) , from the exchange dominated perpendicular standing spin waves ( pssw ) .",
    "the analytical expression of frequencies of de and pssw modes is presented e.g.  in refs .",
    ". de mode is characterized by an exponential decay of the amplitude of the dynamic magnetization and its actual instantaneous value @xmath14 : @xmath15 . ] over the film thickness @xmath11 and their nonreciprocal behavior ( i.e. , reversal of the spinwave propagation direction causes that maximal amplitude of the dynamic magnetization reverses to the opposite interface of the fm film ) .",
    "the amplitude of the dynamic magnetization of a pssw mode over the film thickness @xmath16 is proportional to @xmath17 , where the positive integer @xmath18 denotes the quantization number of the standing spin wave .    to determine the values of the exchange constant of co@xmath0mnsi , all three dependencies of the experimental spin - wave frequencies ( @xmath7 , @xmath11 , @xmath8 )",
    "are compared with simulations which were performed using a theoretical model described in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite . the exchange constant @xmath19 , the land @xmath20-factor , the saturation magnetization @xmath21 and the magnetic anisotropies are the free parameters in these simulations .",
    "because our previous bls investigations of co@xmath0mnsi films have shown very small anisotropy in l2@xmath6 ordered co@xmath0mnsi films @xcite , the anisotropy values were set to zero .",
    "as follow from the analytical expressions  @xcite , for small spinwave wavevector used in our investigations , the frequency of the de mode depends only marginally on the value of @xmath19 , i.e. , de mode frequency is particularly determined by the values of @xmath21 and @xmath20 .",
    "on the other hand , the frequencies of the pssw modes are particularly determined by the @xmath22 ratio and @xmath20 .",
    "furthermore , the land @xmath20-factor is easy to determine independently , as it scales with the slope of the bls frequency on applied magnetic field , d@xmath23/d@xmath24 .",
    "therefore , the fitting procedure is not underdetermined and the parameters @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath20 are found rather independently each other , providing a high reliability ( low correlation ) of the fitted values .",
    "examples of bls spectra collected from 20 , 40 , 60 and thick co@xmath0mnsi films are shown in fig .",
    "[ figure1](a ) .",
    "the spectra were recorded at an external magnetic field of @xmath25  koe and a transferred wave vector of @xmath26  @xmath27 ( i.e.  @xmath28 ) .",

    "figure  [ figure1](c ) shows the bls spectra recorded for the thick co@xmath0mnsi film for different spin - wave wavevectors @xmath8 .",
    "compared to the pssw modes , the de mode exhibits a much stronger dependence on the wavevector .",
    "therefore , the peaks originating from the de mode excitation can be easily identified , whereas the spectral positions of the pssw modes remain nearly unchanged ( fig .",
    "[ figure1](c ) ) .",

    "in particular , we have examined under which conditions the bls intensity becomes zero for odd pssw modes only .",
    "the used analytical approach ( presented in appendix  [ app : a ] ) combines an expression for the bls intensity , as proposed by buchmeier _ et .",
    "@xcite , and the analytical expression of the depth selectivity of the moke effect by hamrle _ et .",
    "the calculations indicate that when conditions ( [ eq : nullodda ] ) and ( [ eq : nulloddb ] ) derived in the appendix  [ app : a ] are fulfilled , the bls intensity will be zero for all odd modes . using the complex refractive index of co@xmath0mnsi @xmath44 @xcite ,",

    "@xcite asymmetrical pinning conditions were assumed ( i.e. , the dynamic magnetization is pinned at one interface , whereas it is unpinned at the second one ) . in our samples",

    "[ figa ] , the frequencies of the de mode exhibit equal values in both the stokes and the anti - stokes part of the spectrum .",
