    "although not all of these dark components are necessarily connected , it should not be very surprising that some could have new interactions .",
    "if dark matter has significant interactions beyond gravitation , there could be dramatically different predictions that can be tested by observations .",
    "for instance , when a light particle mediates the interaction between dark matter , we can get enhanced annihilation cross section , a possible scenario for positron fraction excess in cosmic ray data  . if dark matter has large self - interaction , its density distribution around galactic center tends to have a flat profile  @xcite .",

    "scalars can have cubic and quartic self - interactions , which can affect their cosmological evolution .",
    "if these interactions are small enough , scalar radiation is streaming freely after decoupling and behaves just as neutrinos .",
    "if these interactions are not negligible , scalar may be treated as perfect fluid and affects cmb differently .",
    "the interaction between dark matter and scalar radiation also induces novel temperature dependences in scattering cross section , which are crucial in cosmological context and lead to imprints on linear power spectrum .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] we set the theoretical framework by introducing the explicit model . then in sec .",

    "it is surprising that the above lagrangian has not been discussed in the cosmological context . as we shall show in this paper ,",
    "such a simple model has some novel features and interesting implications .",
    "if dark matter is a scalar field @xmath9 , we can study the phenomenology of @xmath9 and @xmath2 similarly by introducing interaction terms like @xmath10    scalars @xmath2 can be massive or massless , and the resulting cosmology could be quite different . throughout our discussion , we shall not specify the fundamental origins of these scalars . in particle physics , scalars are ubiquous , such as higgs field , axion , inflation field , bound states , dark energy , and so on . without loss of generality",
    ", we may first discuss the @xmath11 part in the potential @xmath12 , @xmath13 where the individual @xmath14 and @xmath15 can be zero or non - zero .",
    "introduction of interaction terms with @xmath16 has at least one immediate effects that @xmath3 and @xmath2 can be thermalized in the early universe . to have the correct electroweak vacuum , the potential need satisfy some conditions , see appendix for detailed discussion .",
    "it is also possible to introduce other non - renormalizable terms like @xmath17 to do the thermalization .",
    "the relic density of dm @xmath3 is basically determined by the couplings to @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath3 can be produced either through usual thermal freeze - out or freeze - in process , it can also produced by heavy @xmath11 s decay .",

    "[ eq : lag ] .",
    "however , if there is a light state in @xmath2 , although the relic density calculation is probably only modified by including sommerfeld effects  @xcite , there are other very important consequences on cosmological observables , such as cmb and large scale structure ( lss ) , which are the main topics in this paper . as we shall show that the details not only depend on the interaction between dm @xmath3 and @xmath2 , but also on self - interaction terms @xmath19 and @xmath15 .",

    "and we have used entropy conservation in the last equality .",
    "although the exact value depends on the kinetic decoupling temperature @xmath28 and ratios of degrees of freedom before and after decoupling , the typical value for @xmath29 would be around @xmath30 which is definitely allowed by present data  @xcite .",
