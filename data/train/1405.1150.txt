    "one of the simplest possible dynamical systems consists of a single billiard ball bouncing around inside a polygon .",
    "interest in these systems is twofold .",
    "first , they are considered model dynamical systems , and so methods developed to analyze them are often more widely applicable and offer insight into a variety of systems .",
    "second , billiards in polygons often arise in physical systems .",
    "for example , the system of two unequal masses colliding elastically on the unit interval is isomorphic to a billiard in a right triangle . additionally , the system of three masses in a circle with fixed center of mass is isomorphic to a billiard in an acute triangle .",
    "details of these examples can be found in  1.2 of a survey by masur and tabachnikov @xcite .",
    "the study of polygonal billiards dates back at least to j. f. de tuschis a fagnano , who in 1775 proved that all acute triangles admit periodic trajectories .",
    "we make all the standard mathematical assumptions ",
    "the ball has zero radius , there is no friction , and collisions with the edges are perfectly elastic .",
    "even so , many questions about the dynamics of these systems remain open .",
    "for example , it is unknown whether every polygon , or even every triangle , admits a periodic trajectory . in the general case ,",
    "the strongest known result is that every triangle with angles less than @xmath3 degrees admits a periodic trajectory , due to schwartz @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the so - called _ rational case _ where the polygon has angles that are rational multiples of @xmath4 is fairly well - understood . a survey of the techniques applied to rational polygons and the results obtained for them thus far can be found in @xcite .",
    "one of the strongest such results is that periodic trajectories are dense in the phase space of trajectories @xcite . when the polygon additionally has the _ lattice property _ , we can even use the work of veech in @xcite to derive precise asymptotics on the number of periodic trajectories of a given length .",
    "a natural generalization is to ask how the dynamics vary as we perturb the polygon , i.e. how billiards behave locally near a given polygon in the phase space of polygons .",
    "one question is which trajectories on the polygon are stable under these perturbations .",
    "surprisingly , some polygons admit no stable trajectories , even if they admit many trajectories ; such polygons include right triangles , due to hooper @xcite , and the veech triangles @xmath1 for @xmath2 due to hooper and schwartz @xcite",
    ".    however , characterizing stable trajectories on a polygon @xmath5 alone does not fully determine the local theory of billiards near @xmath5 .",
    "we also want to know about trajectories which exist on polygons arbitrarily close to @xmath5 , but which degenerate to saddle connections on @xmath5 itself . to the author",
    "s knowledge , the only work on this subject is that of schwartz , who proved in @xcite that no neighborhood of the 30 - 60 - 90 triangle can be covered by finitely many orbit tiles .",
    "the aim of this paper is to extend results for stable trajectories on @xmath5 to results for stable trajectories in neighborhoods of @xmath5 .",
    "lemma  [ lem : from stable ] characterizes the saddle connections which arise from stable trajectories . in  4 and  5",
    ", we apply this to triangles for which enumerations of all saddle connections are known in order to understand the local theory of billiards near them .    with the exception of  5 ,",
    "only a background of basic group theory , algebraic topology and real analysis is assumed , although the reader may benefit from previous exposure to polygonal billiards . for  5 , it is assumed that the reader is familiar with the work of hooper and schwartz in @xcite , and greater familiarity with group theory and homology is necessary .",
    "each section builds on the previous sections , with the exception of  4 and  5 which are logically independent of each other .",
    "we begin by reviewing the basic concepts in polygonal billiards , and giving the precise definitions we will make use of later .",
    "a more thorough introduction to billiards in polygons can be found in  1 of @xcite ( with a focus on the rational case ) , or in  2 of @xcite ( with a focus on the general case ) .",
    "a _ trajectory _ on a polygon @xmath5 is a function @xmath6 with constant derivative except when @xmath7 lies on ( or _ strikes _ ) an edge , at which point the derivative is reflected across the line normal to the edge .",
    "we also require that @xmath7 is never a vertex . if @xmath8 and @xmath9 for some @xmath10 , we say @xmath11 is _ periodic _ and normalize so that @xmath12 .",
    "we will assume the edges of @xmath5 are labeled from @xmath13 to @xmath0 .",
    "the standard technique for analyzing a trajectory @xmath6 is to consider the unfolding of @xmath5 along @xmath11 .",
    "each time @xmath11 strikes an edge , instead of reflecting the trajectory , we reflect @xmath5 across the edge and have the trajectory continue in a straight line .",

    "note that we can form the unfolding along an arbitrary path , so long as it does not include any vertices ; we will make heavy use of this later . folding these polygons back together gives a covering of @xmath5 by the unfolding , and a trajectory on @xmath5 lifts to a straight line on the unfolding .",
    "it is easy to see that a trajectory is periodic iff its lift to the unfolding strikes two copies of @xmath5 which differ by a translation in the same place .    from here on , we will always work in the unfolding along some trajectory or a more general covering space . for notational convenience",
    ", we call the lift of a trajectory to these spaces a trajectory , and do not distinguish between a trajectory and its lifts , relying on context to make the underlying space clear .",
    "unfolding turns out to be so useful that we will generalize the process in  2 , and view questions of stability as fundamentally questions about properties of certain coverings .",
    "one fact made obvious by the unfolding is that periodic trajectories occur in parallel families  translating a periodic trajectory up or down by @xmath14 results in another periodic trajectory for small @xmath14 .",
    "however , for critical values of @xmath14 , the result will strike a vertex , producing a saddle connection .",
    "a straight line in an unfolding which traverses successive polygons and is periodic but includes one or more vertices is a _",
    "saddle connection_.    this definition is nonstandard .",
    "typically , a saddle connection is defined as a line segment joining a pair of vertices .",
    "our saddle connections are clearly disjoint unions of such segments , so we call these segments _ components _ of saddle connections .",
    "saddle connections are crucial to understanding the local theory of billiards on polygons , because they arise as the limiting case of trajectories when we apply construction  [ con : new trajectory ] .",
    "we can also use unfoldings to formalize the notion of having the `` same '' periodic trajectory ( or closed path ) on different polygons , up to translation .",
    "[ con : new trajectory ] let @xmath11 be a closed path on an @xmath0-gon @xmath5 , @xmath15 the unfolding of @xmath5 along @xmath11 embedded in @xmath16 such that @xmath17 , and @xmath18 another @xmath0-gon .",

    "if the copies of @xmath18 containing @xmath30 and @xmath31 differ by translation and @xmath18 is sufficiently close to @xmath5 , then some translate @xmath32 of @xmath27 is contained in @xmath19 and @xmath19 is the unfolding of @xmath18 along @xmath32 .",
    "this construction is more complicated than typical , but extends to arbitrary closed paths rather than just trajectories , which is crucial for our project .",
    "intuitively , we replace the copies of @xmath5 in the unfolding along @xmath11 with copies of @xmath18 , and then rotate the path so that it remains closed .",
    "note that if @xmath11 is a trajectory , @xmath32 is as well .",
    "when discussing trajectories on different polygons , we will often apply construction  [ con : new trajectory ] implicitly .",
    "a periodic trajectory @xmath11 on an @xmath0-gon @xmath5 is _ stable _ if , for any @xmath0-gon @xmath18 sufficiently near @xmath5 , applying construction  [ con : new trajectory ] to @xmath11 gives a periodic trajectory on @xmath18 .",
    "the set of @xmath0-gons @xmath33 admitting a given periodic trajectory @xmath11 is the _ orbit tile _ of @xmath11 .    if @xmath34 , we consider @xmath33 a subset of the set of triangles up to similarity , which is parametrized by two angles less than @xmath4 .",
    "clearly a periodic trajectory is stable iff its orbit tile is open .",
    "the typical strategy for proving the existence of periodic trajectories on general polygons ( or at least triangles ) is to enumerate collections of orbit tiles and show that the tiles cover the set in consideration @xcite .",
    "one important property of orbit tiles requires mention , a proof of which can be found in  2.5 of @xcite .",
    "if @xmath33 is an open orbit tile , its boundary is piecewise analytic .",
    "much of the theory of stable periodic trajectories is based on the following lemma , which gives a geometric characterization of stability .",
    "let @xmath35 be the surface obtained by identifying two copies of @xmath5 along the edges , with punctures at the vertices .",
    "a periodic trajectory on @xmath5 is stable iff its lift to @xmath35 is null - homologous .",
    "this can be proved by combinatorial arguments , as schwartz did in @xcite , or by using holonomy as hooper did in @xcite .",
    "we present a proof using covering space theory , which makes the geometric connection clear and will give us a natural way to extend the result to saddle connections .",
    "first we consider several groups which act on the set of polygons in the plane .",
    "consider a generic @xmath0-gon @xmath36 with vertices at @xmath37 .",
    "define @xmath38 as the group of affine maps @xmath39 which are obtained by reflecting @xmath36 across its @xmath40th edge , then reflecting @xmath41 across its @xmath42th edge , and so on .",
    "let @xmath43 denote the derivative map on @xmath38 and define @xmath44 .",
    "let @xmath45 denote the evaluation map on @xmath38 which sends @xmath37 to the @xmath46th vertex of an @xmath0-gon @xmath5 and @xmath47 the evaluation map on @xmath48 .",
    "define @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "this allow us to define the unfolding formally .",
    "puncture @xmath5 at its vertices .",
    "let @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the equivalence relation obtained by identifying the @xmath46th edge of @xmath53 with the @xmath46th edge of @xmath54 .",
    "the _ unfolding _ of @xmath5 is @xmath55 while the _ generic unfolding _ of @xmath5 is @xmath56 , with @xmath57 and @xmath58 acting on @xmath59 in the obvious way .",
    "the unfolding @xmath60 contains the unfolding of @xmath5 along any trajectory .",
    "since copies of @xmath5 are identified in @xmath60 iff they differ by a translation , a trajectory on @xmath5 is periodic iff its lift to @xmath60 is closed . if @xmath11 lifts further to a closed path in @xmath61 , then construction  [ con : new trajectory ] gives us a closed path in @xmath62 for any @xmath18 sufficiently close to @xmath5 .",
    "since we have a covering @xmath63 , this gives us a closed path in @xmath64 for all @xmath18 sufficiently near @xmath5 , i.e. a periodic trajectory .",
    "thus if the lift of @xmath11 to @xmath61 is closed , @xmath11 is stable .",

    "then @xmath74 can not be a reflection , so it must be a rotation , hence we can write @xmath74 as a product of rotations of the form @xmath75 , which are rotations by @xmath76 . since @xmath77 we have a linear combination of these rotations which is trivial ,",
    "hence by independence @xmath74 is the trivial rotation , a contradiction .",
    "a trajectory on @xmath5 is stable iff its lift to @xmath61 is closed .",
    "a closer analysis also gives us the following well - known result .",
    "[ cor : not open ] if @xmath33 is not open , the set of angles of polygons in @xmath33 satisfies some integer relation .",
    "let @xmath78 and let @xmath11 be the trajectory which defines @xmath33",
    ". then @xmath11 must lift to a closed path on @xmath79 , so the sequence of reflections across edges along a period of @xmath11 lies in @xmath80 , but not in @xmath57 as @xmath11 is not stable .",
    "this sequence must have even length , so we can write it as a product of rotations by @xmath76 , which must satisfy some integer relation . for @xmath11 to be closed on @xmath60 , this sequence of reflections must also lie in @xmath58 , so this relation must also be satisfied by @xmath5 .    to relate this to the stability lemma , we consider the covering @xmath81 obtained by letting @xmath82 be the ( index-@xmath83 ) subgroup of orientation - preserving affine maps and identifying @xmath84 with @xmath85 .",
    "recall that @xmath86 is the abelianization of @xmath87 , so a closed curve is null - homologous iff its homotopy class is in the commutator subgroup of @xmath87 .",
    "thus in order to prove the lemma it suffices to show that the image of the induced map @xmath88 is @xmath89 $ ] .",
