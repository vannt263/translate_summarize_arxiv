    "starting from bohr s compound nucleus suggestion , the idea of considering the dynamics in the interaction region almost separately from the scattering process has been proven very successful in different fields .",
    "wigner s r - matrix method @xcite gives the formal background to the separation of internal dynamics and `` free '' motion in the channel space .",
    "based on this idea we study whether chaoticity or integrability of the internal dynamics can be detected in the scattering data . for this purpose",
    "we apply fourier transform techniques , which have proved successful in spectral analysis @xcite , to total and partial cross sections .    to build the scattering ensembles",
    ", we shall assume that there are no correlations between channel space and the internal structure .",
    "this assumption is usually well fulfilled for systems with topological chaos , while it is often not fulfilled for integrable systems @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we use this assumption in order to compare the chaotic and regular case in a direct and minimally biased way .",
    "any differences we then find are basis independent and minimal in the sense that correlations would usually increase the dissimilarity to the chaotic case . therefore , we use orthogonally invariant random matrix models to describe the internal structure . for the chaotic case",
    "the choice is obviously the gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) if time reversal symmetry is conserved .",
    "following berry and tabor @xcite we associate integrability with a random poissonian spectrum , thus excluding harmonic oscillators explicitly .",
    "for this case the poisson orthogonal ensemble ( poe ) was proposed some years ago @xcite .",
    "the case of time reversal symmetry breaking can be treated analogously using the unitary ensembles , but this will not be discussed in the present paper .",
    "we consider three different absorption regimes .",
    "for _ weak coupling _ the resonances are isolated , and conventional spectral analysis is satisfactory ; if we wish we may add an analysis of the widths . then follows what is usually called _ strong absorption _ , where we find overlapping resonances , but where the individual transmissions from all channels are considerably smaller than one .",
    "next we have the case where the transmissions are close to one . to differentiate the latter two regimes",
    ", we shall speak of _ strong transmission _ in this case .",
    "it corresponds to the semiclassical limit , where tunneling effects become negligible",
    ".    for level spectra as well as for intensity spectra , fourier transform methods and the so called `` correlation hole '' have been very successful tools to identify the effects of integrability and chaos @xcite .",
    "yet it is not clear to what extent such an analysis remains useful , when the resonances are no longer isolated .",
    "an exact theory is only available for two - point functions of s - matrix elements in the goe case .",
    "this so called verbaarschot - weidenm \" uller - zirnbauer ( vwz ) integral @xcite allows to calculate correlation functions of total cross sections by means of the optical theorem .",
    "in contrast to that , we have no such theory in the poe case or for correlation functions of partial cross sections . in these cases ,",
    "one had to fall back on the so called `` breit - wigner '' approximation @xcite , which becomes valid in the weak coupling limit . to extend the validity of this approximation we take advantage of the well known fact that the satchler transmission matrix @xcite or , in absence of direct reactions as in our case , the transmission coefficients are the only way in which the coupling strength influences the physically relevant quantities . by using the transmission coefficients rather than the coupling constants as input , which amounts to a rescaling , we are able to extend the validity of this approximation to the regime of _ strong absorption _ , where the resonances are overlapping , but the absorption in each channel is still moderate .    we perform numerical simulations with two purposes : to check the range of validity of the rescaled breit - wigner formalism , and to find situations , which show significant differences between goe and poe .",
    "we will concentrate on fourier transforms of auto and cross correlation functions , and we shall see that in particular for the latter the differences are in some cases very promising . in particular we find that cross correlations between cross sections from different channels show strong signatures .",
    "+ in sec .",
    "[ m ] we present the model we use . in sec .",
    "[ c ] we introduce the correlation functions of s - matrix elements and cross sections , our basic tool for the statistical analysis of the scattering systems .",
    "next we discuss the `` rescaled breit - wigner '' approximation in sec .",
    "it allows to get results in closed form for the correlation functions between total or partial cross sections . in sec .",
    "[ v ] we derive a twofold integral expression for the fourier transform of the vwz integral @xcite .",
    "this simplifies the numerical treatment considerably , and it is used in sec .",
    "[ t ] , to test the validity of the rescaled breit - wigner approximation .",
    "after these theoretical considerations , we turn to the numerical study of the two scattering ensembles , the poe and the goe .",
    "this is done in sec .",
    "[ n ] , which is divided into two subsections . the first deals with correlation functions between total cross sections , and the second with correlation functions between partial cross sections .",
    "section  [ s ] contains a short summary .",
    "we wish to construct scattering ensembles for the two contrary cases , where the dynamics in the interaction region is predominantly integrable , or completely chaotic .",
    "we do this under the assumption that the scattering system may be separated into an internal part restricted to a finite interaction region and an external part described by some superintegrable hamiltonian . though some complexity may show up in the coupling of the two parts also , _",
    "i.e. _ in the mismatch of channel functions and internal functions , the dominant part of the complexity should be contained in the internal part .",
    "then the subsystem that describes the complex internal dynamics has a discrete spectrum , such that its statistical properties can be modeled with an appropriate random matrix ensemble . in order to construct the scattering ensembles",
    ", we fix the external part and use standard techniques , originally introduced to describe nuclear compound reactions @xcite , to assign to each element from the random matrix ensemble a scattering matrix .",
    "thus we obtain a set of scattering matrices provided with the measure inherited from the original random matrix ensemble . for simplicity we will denote the scattering ensembles obtained from the goe and the poe by the same names whenever",
    "there is no danger for confusion .    to be more precise ,",
    "we consider complex scattering systems with many , possibly overlapping , resonances , where the s - matrix can be cast into the following form : @xmath0 here @xmath1 is a real , symmetric @xmath2 matrix which describes the internal dynamics , and @xmath3 is a real @xmath4 matrix , describing the coupling to the @xmath5 channels .",
    "the matrix @xmath6 is the so called effective hamiltonian @xcite . in order to arrive at eq .",
    "( [ m_smat ] ) it is assumed that the coupling matrix elements between channel states and internal eigenstates are energy independent @xcite . furthermore one should either neglect the direct reactions or perform an engelbrecht - weidenmller transformation @xcite if it is necessary to take them into account .",
    "the effective hamiltonian @xmath6 can be diagonalized , such that its eigenvalues @xmath7 give the positions and widths of the resonances if they are isolated . in the eigenbasis of @xmath6 ,",
    "the s - matrix elements can be written as @xmath8 this equation shows that the complex poles of the s - matrix are precisely the @xmath9 eigenvalues of @xmath6 .",
    "if the coupling matrix elements are small enough , their real parts are well approximated by the discrete levels of @xmath1 , whereas their imaginary parts are given by the diagonal elements of @xmath10 .",
    "this amounts to the breit - wigner approximation , which results from applying first order perturbation theory to the effective hamiltonian @xmath6 .",
    "+ in this paper we consider two scattering ensembles : the goe and the poe . both are invariant with respect to orthogonal transformations .",
    "hence in the eigenbasis of @xmath1 the @xmath5 channel vectors are random orthogonal vectors . in practice ,",
    "we use independent random vectors with gaussian distributed components for @xmath3 , which are orthogonal only up to order @xmath11 .",
    "however , as we used relatively large matrices @xmath12 , the violation of the orthogonal invariance had certainly no noticeable effect on our numerical results .",
    "hence , for both ensembles the nonzero eigenvalues of @xmath10 ( given by the norm squared of the column vectors ) , and the level density of @xmath1 are the only independent parameters .    in the goe case , the elements of the diagonal matrix @xmath1 are distributed according to the joint probability distribution of the goe spectrum @xcite , so that for large @xmath9 , the level density approaches the semicircle distribution . in the poe case ,",
    "the elements are independently distributed , and in principle the level density can be of any form .",
    "our main objective is the distinction between both ensembles , based on the observation of correlations .",
    "hence we find it convenient to use the semicircle distribution in the poe case also .",
    "+ the main theoretical tool for the calculation of correlation functions will be the rescaled breit - wigner approximation , introduced in sec .",
    "in fact , it can be applied in much more general situations .",
    "this is of particular importance for partially integrable scattering systems , where the assumption of orthogonal invariance does often not hold .",
    "then the distribution of the matrix elements of @xmath3 are typically very different from simple uncorrelated gaussian distributions . + in cases",
    "as they are studied here , the openness of the scattering system is commonly described , borrowing the terminology from the so called `` optical model '' ( _ cf .",
    "_ @xcite and references therein ) , which was originally developed to describe nuclear compound reactions with two well separated time scales .",
    "consider the partial cross section in appropriate units , which is given by : @xmath13 .",
    "then one defines the optical partial cross section as @xmath14 , where the different time scales are used to obtain a well defined average s - matrix @xmath15 by averaging over an appropriately chosen energy window . here",
    "@xmath15 is simply defined by the ensemble average , avoiding in this way any arbitrariness .",
    "the openness of the scattering system is then characterized by so called `` transmission coefficients , '' defined for each entrance channel @xmath16 : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the total cross section , and @xmath19 is the total optical cross section , with respect to the entrance channel @xmath16 .",
    "the unitarity of the s - matrix leads to : @xmath20 which is sometimes called the `` optical theorem . ''",
    "the scattering ensembles defined above , _",
    "i.e. _ the goe and the poe , are completely characterized by the average level distance @xmath21 in the center of the spectrum of @xmath1 , and the variance of the coupling matrix elements @xmath22 , which are independent of @xmath23 due to orthogonal invariance . from those we define",
    "the following dimensionless coupling parameters : @xmath24 here and in what follows , the brackets @xmath25 stand for the ensemble average . as discussed in the appendix ,",
    "the average s - matrix is diagonal .",
    "its diagonal elements , the transmission coefficients , and the coupling parameters are related to each other : @xmath26 which is , however , true in the center of the spectrum only ( a more detailed discussion is given in the appendix ) .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , we distinguish three different regimes .",
    "now , these can be defined more quantitatively in terms of the transmission coefficients : the first is the _ weak absorption _",
    "regime , where the resonances are still well separated , so that @xmath27 . next comes the regime of _ strong absorption _",
    ", where the resonances overlap , but the transmission from each channel is still small : @xmath28 .",
    "note , that this implies in particular , that the number of channels @xmath5 is large .",
    "finally we have the regime of _ strong transmission _ : @xmath29 where the transmissions in all channels are close to one .",
    "correlation functions are our principal tool for the statistical analysis of total and partial cross sections .",
    "we distinguish between autocorrelation functions , where one cross section is correlated with itself , and cross correlation functions , where two different cross sections are correlated with each other .",
    "first we define the correlation functions in general , in order to introduce our notation",
    ". then we use the optical theorem , to relate the correlation function of two total cross sections to one of corresponding s - matrix elements . for the latter , the vwz integral @xcite provides the exact result in the goe case . in the poe case",
    "an exact result exists only in the one channel case @xcite , and we use the rescaled breit - wigner approximation there . for partial cross sections ,",
    "no exact theory exists at all . in this case",
    ", we first use the so called `` diagonal approximation '' to express the partial cross sections in such a form , that the rescaled breit - wigner approximation can be applied .    dealing with matrix ensembles ,",
    "it is convenient to define the correlation functions as ensemble averages , rather then energy averages . therefore , we eventually have to face the ergodicity question @xcite , which is unclear in the poe case .",
    "note , however , that in quantum dot experiments ensemble averages may actually be the relevant ones @xcite .",
    "we calculate the correlation functions always in the center of the spectrum ( see appendix ) , where we set @xmath30 . given then two complex functions @xmath31 and",
    "@xmath32 of the energy , we define the correlation function as follows :",
