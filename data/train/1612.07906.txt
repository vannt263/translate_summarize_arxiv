    "since the brightness of the nova does not decline smoothly and there is large drop in magnitude due to dust formation , it is difficult to measure the characteristic time t@xmath23 , the time to decline by two magnitude from visual maximum , of the nova , directly from the light curve . instead , we can use the relation shown by williams et al .",

    "the dust dip in the @xmath29 band light curves is very similar to the nova v5668 sgr which , like v2676  oph , also showed the co band in emission ( banerjee et al .",

    "2008 ) , v5579 sgr ( raj et al . 2011 ) where dust formation was reported without any co emission .",
    "the reason is not clearly understood ; possibly these molecules were present but the strengths were below detection levels or due to observational constraints they might have formed and destroyed before the detection .",
    "an increase in flux in the h and k bands coincides with the onset of the dust dip at shorter wavelengths .",
    "this is likely thermal emission from the dust .",
    "the larger excess in k is consistent with expectations that the thermal emission will peak in or beyond the k band .",
    "similar behavior was seen in v5579 sgr ( raj et al . 2011 ) and v496 sct ( raj et al . 2012 ) , which also showed the dust formation . the @xmath3 color excess reached a maximum of @xmath88  mag at 190 days from outburst .",

    "thereafter the @xmath3 color decreased , presumably because the dust thinned due to geometrical dilution .",
    "the presence of strong c i lines and the early dust formation ( just after 90 days ) in the case of v2676 oph indicate the presence of carbon grains in the dust shell ( clayton & wickramasinghe 1976 ) .",

    "<S> we present optical spectrophotometric and near - infrared ( nir ) photometric observations of the nova v2676 oph covering the period from 2012 march 29 through 2015 may 8 . </S>",
    "<S> the optical spectra and photometry of the nova have been taken from smarts and asiago ; the near - infrared photometry was obtained from smarts and mt . abu . </S>",
    "<S> the spectra are dominated by strong h i lines from the balmer series , feii , ni and [ oi ] lines in the initial days , typical of an fe ii type nova . </S>",
    "<S> the measured fwhm for the h@xmath0 and h@xmath1 lines was 800 - 1200 km s@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> there was pronounced dust formation starting 90 days after the outburst . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath3 color was the largest among recent dust forming novae . </S>"
