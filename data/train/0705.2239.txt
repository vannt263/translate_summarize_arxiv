    "an interesting issue is the influence of the magnetic field applied along the layer direction on the high - frequency response and , in particular , on the jpr .",
    "such field forms the lattice of josephson vortices ( jvl ) .",
    "the anisotropy factor , @xmath3 , and the interlayer periodicity , @xmath4 , set the important field scale , @xmath5 . at @xmath6 the josephson vortices are well separated and form a dilute lattice .",

    "rapidly loses its intensity with increasing the field , while the resonance frequency either does not move or slowly increases with the field .",
    "in addition , another wide peak emerges at a smaller frequency and its intensity increases with increasing field .",
    "several theoretical approaches have been used to describe the response of the jvl state to the oscillating electric field .",
    "a phenomenological vortex - oscillation theory has been proposed by tachiki _",
    "this theory describes the response of the jvl at small frequencies and fields , in terms of phenomenological vortex parameters , mass , viscosity coefficient , and pinning spring constant .",

    "<S> we studied the response of the josephson vortex lattice in layered superconductors to the high - frequency c - axis electric field . </S>",
    "<S> we found a simple relation connecting the dynamic dielectric constant with the perturbation of the superconducting phase , induced by oscillating electric field . numerically solving equations for the oscillating phases </S>",
    "<S> , we computed the frequency dependences of the loss function at different magnetic fields , including regions of both dilute and dense josephson vortex lattices . </S>",
    "<S> the overall behavior is mainly determined by the c - axis and in - plane dissipation parameters , which are inversely proportional to the anisotropy . </S>",
    "<S> the cases of weak and strong dissipations are realized in @xmath0 and underdoped @xmath1 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the main feature of the response is the josephson - plasma - resonance peak . in the weak - dissipation case </S>",
    "<S> additional satellites appear in the dilute regime in the higher - frequency region due to the excitation of the plasma modes with the wave vectors set by the lattice structure . in the dense - lattice limit </S>",
    "<S> the plasma peak moves to a higher frequency and its intensity rapidly decreases , in agreement with experiment and analytical theory . </S>",
    "<S> the behavior of the loss function at low frequencies is well described by the phenomenological theory of vortex oscillations . in the case of very strong in - plane dissipation an additional peak in the loss function </S>",
    "<S> appears below the plasma frequency . </S>",
    "<S> such peak has been observed experimentally in underdoped @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> it is caused by the frequency dependence of the in - plane contribution to losses rather than a definite mode of phase oscillations . </S>"
