    "confining a binary mixture one can profoundly alter its miscibility behavior.@xcite if a mixture is confined into a quasi one  dimensional ( e.g. , cylindrical ) pore no true phase transition occurs , unlike the prediction of the mean field theory .",
    "fluctuations destroy long  range order and only a pronounced maximum of the susceptibility remains in the vicinity of the unmixing transition in the bulk . in a two  dimensional system ( e.g. , a slit  like pore or a film ) with identical surfaces a true phase transition occurs ( capillary condensation ) and the shift of the critical point away from its bulk value has been much investigated.@xcite the confinement changes the universality class of the transition from 3d ising critical behavior in the bulk to 2d ising critical behavior in the film .",
    "the latter manifests itself in much flatter binodals in a film close to the unmixing transition than in the bulk .",
    "no such change of the critical exponents is observed in mean field theory .",
    "the phase behavior of symmetric mixtures in a thin film with antisymmetric surface interactions has attracted abiding interest recently.@xcite the right surface attracts one species with exactly the same strength as the opposite surface attracts the other species .",
    "in contrast to capillary condensation , the phase transition does not occur close to the unmixing transition in the bulk , but rather in the vicinity of the wetting transition .",
    "close to the unmixing transition in the bulk , enrichment layers at the surfaces are gradually built up and an interface is stabilized in the middle of the film . in this `` soft  mode ''",
    "phase the system is laterally homogenous  no spontaneous breaking of the symmetry occurs .",
    "if the wetting transition of the semi  infinite system is of second order one encounters a second order localisation ",
    "delocalisation transition slightly below the wetting transition temperature .",
    "the system phase separates laterally into regions where the interface is located close to one surface ( localized state ) .",
    "the order parameter , i.e. , the distance between the interface and the center of the film , grows continously .",
    "this prediction of phenomenological theories has been corroborated by detailed simulation studies@xcite and it is also in accord with experimental findings.@xcite    if the wetting transition is of first order and the thickness of the film not too small , mean field calculations@xcite predict the occurance of two critical points which correspond to the prewetting critical point of the semi  infinite system . unlike the wetting transition,@xcite the prewetting transition can produce a critical ( singular ) behavior in a thin film , because only the lateral correlation length diverges at the prewetting critical point ; the thickness of the enrichment layers at the surfaces remains finite .",
    "the mean field treatment invokes approximations and it can not be expected to capture the subtle interplay between 2d ising fluctuations at the critical points , `` bulk''like composition fluctuations , and interface fluctuations typical for the wetting transition.@xcite consequently , a detailed test of the mean field predictions via monte carlo simulations is certainly warranted and elucidates the role of fluctuations .",

    "_ studied the interface localisation ",
    "delocalisation transition also for the case that the wetting transition of the semi  infinite system is of first order.@xcite the simulation study was centered on the dependence on the film thickness , which is a convenient parameter to be varied in experiments .",
    "however , the study was restricted to the coexistence between strictly symmetric phases and many questions remained open .",
    "the general features of the phase behavior are shared by all binary mixtures . here , we present large scale monte carlo simulations aiming at investigating the phase behavior of a symmetric binary polymer blend confined between antisymmetric walls .",
    "computationally , simulations of a polymer blend@xcite are much more demanding than studying simple fluids ( e.g. , the ising model ) , but recent mean field calculations made detailed predictions for the phase behavior of confined polymer mixtures@xcite and serve as guidance for choosing the model parameters in the simulations .",
    "simulating polymer blends , we can , at least in principle , control the importance of fluctuations by varying the degree of interdigitation , i.e. , the chain length.@xcite the mean field theory is expected to become accurate in the limit of infinite interdigitation . in a binary polymer blend",
    "the wetting transition occurs at much lower temperatures than the critical temperature of the unmixing transition in bulk.@xcite hence , `` bulk''like composition fluctuations are not important in the vicinity of the wetting transition temperature and we can isolate the effect of interface fluctuation . moreover , these systems are also suitable candidates to examine the phase behavior experimentally .",
    "indeed , one of the first studies of the `` soft  mode '' phase has employed a binary polymer blend.@xcite    our paper is broadly arranged as follows : first , we present a phenomenological description of the phase behavior in a film with antisymmetric short range surface interactions . using a standard model for the effective interface potential",
    "we calculate the phase behavior in mean field approximation , discuss the regime of validity of the mean field approach , and consider the crossover between the different critical behaviors .",
    "second , we briefly describe our coarse grained lattice model for a binary polymer mixture .",
    "then , we present our monte carlo results : we obtain the phase diagram for film thicknesses ranging from @xmath5 to @xmath6 , where @xmath7 denotes the radius of gyration of the polymer chains , investigate the critical behavior and present evidence that interface fluctuations renormalize the effective interface potential . we close with a comparison of the phase diagram to the behavior of the bulk and of films with symmetric boundary conditions .",
    "rather than describing the configuration of the system by the detailed composition profile across the film , much qualitative insight into the thermodynamics can be deduced from the effective interface potential . below the bulk  critical temperature enrichment layers of the prefered components form at the surfaces and stabilize an @xmath8 interface which runs parallel to the walls . the effective interface potential",
    "@xmath9 describes the free energy per unit area as a function of the distance @xmath10 between this @xmath8 interface and a wall . in the case of short range forces between the monomers and the walls ,",
    "the interface profile becomes distorted in the vicinity of the walls and this gives rise to an interaction which decays exponentially as a function of the distance l between the @xmath8 interface and a single wall : @xmath11 this expression retains only the lowest powers of @xmath12 , which are necessary to bring about a first order wetting transition of the semi  infinite system .",

    "panel ( * a * ) of fig.[fig : tri ] suggests that the tricritical transition occurs close to the film thickness @xmath199 .",
    "this is further corroborated in fig.[fig : tri](*b * ) , where we show the distribution function at @xmath200 for various system sizes . within the statistical accuracy of our data the distribution functions for the larger systems sizes collapse well onto the universal scaling curve . for smaller systems the outer peaks are slightly sharper and centered at smaller values of the order parameter .",
    "of course , no perfect data collapse can be expected because we can tune the film thickness only in units of the lattice spacing . in view of the statistical accuracy and possible systematic corrections to scaling ,",
    "however , we did not attempt to vary the monomer ",

    "the system is very close to the tricritical transition .",
    "though the system is strictly symmetric the critical points for larger film thickness ( @xmath194 ) do not occur at @xmath3 but rather there are two critical points at critical compositions @xmath204 and @xmath205 .",
    "these critical points are the finite film thickness analogs of the prewetting critical points , which occur in the limit @xmath206.@xcite below the critical temperature the phase diagram comprises two miscibility gaps .",
    "the coexisting phases correspond to surfaces with a thin and a thick enrichment layer of the preferred component . due to",
    "the missing symmetry between the coexisting phases the coexistence value of the chemical potential @xmath110 differs from zero .",

    "this is shown in fig.[fig : tcd48](*a * ) for the film thickness @xmath142 .",
    "for the system sizes accessible in the simulations the intersection points between cumulants of neighboring systems sizes systematically shift to lower temperatures and the value of the cumulant at the intersection point gradually approaches the value of the 2d ising universality class from above .",
    "the latter is indicated in the figure by the horizontal line . from these data we estimate the critical parameters to be @xmath208 , and @xmath209 and @xmath210 respectively .",

    "a similar procedure has been employed to locate the critical temperature in the film of thickness @xmath212 .",
    "the temperature and system size dependence of the cumulants are displayed in fig.[fig : tcd48](*c * ) . from this",
    "we extract the estimate @xmath213 for the critical temperature and @xmath214 and @xmath215 for the critical compositions .",
    "this value corresponds to a distance between then wall and the interface of @xmath216 . since increasing the film thickness from @xmath217 to @xmath218",
    "does not change @xmath219 or @xmath220 substantially , we are in the regime @xmath221 and the critical behavior is characteristic of the prewetting critical point in the semi  infinite system .    the behavior of the cumulants and the very gradual approach of the probability distribution towards the ising curve indicate pronounced corrections to scaling . for the simulation of the bulk phase diagram@xcite",
    "a nice cumulant intersection has been obtained with system sizes in the range @xmath222 to @xmath223 . in the present study",
    "we employ systems with about an order of magnitude more polymers and obtain no clear intersection of the cumulants !",
    "there are three reasons for strong corrections to the leading 2d ising scaling behavior : ( i ) the aspect ratio @xmath224 of our simulation cell is always finite .",
    "truly two  dimensional behavior can only be observed for vanishing aspect ratio , and our data might fall into the broad crossover region between three  dimensional critical behavior and the two  dimensional critical behavior .",
    "such a crossover has been studied in our polymer model for neutral walls@xcite and walls , which attract both the same species ( i.e. , capillary condensation).@xcite however , we note that unlike these situations there is no three  dimensional critical point in the vicinity for antisymmetric boundary conditions .",
    "the temperature of the unmixing transition in the bulk is a factor 4 higher than the critical point in a thin film . since the critical point in a thin film",
    "is related to the prewetting transition of the semi  infinite system , i.e. , a transition with no three dimensional analogy , we expect the corrections to be qualitatively different from the case of neutral or symmetric boundaries .",
    "( ii ) unlike the situation for small film thickness @xmath185 the probability distribution of the order parameter is asymmetric , because the critical point does not lay on the symmetry axis of the phase diagram .",
    "this missing symmetry between the two phases gives rise to field  mixing effects,@xcite which manifest themselves in corrections of relative order @xmath225 .",
    "these corrections are antisymmetric to leading order and , hence , are not expected to influence even moments ( like the cumulants ) of the order parameter distribution profoundly .",
    "the effects are , however , detectable in the order parameter distribution which we present in fig.[fig : tcd48](*b * ) and ( * d * ) .",
    "the distribution functions at our estimate of the critical temperature clearly lack symmetry and approach very gradually the symmetric scaling curve of the 2d ising universality class .",
    "( iii ) additionally , there are corrections to scaling by non  singular background terms .",
    "one source of ( non  critical ) composition fluctuations are `` bulk  like '' fluctuations in the @xmath1rich and @xmath2rich domains . in a bulk system ,",
    "i.e. , with periodic boundary conditions in all directions , the susceptibility is rather small . at @xmath226",
    "it takes the value @xmath227 with @xmath228 . in a system of size @xmath229",
    "this susceptibility corresponds to composition fluctuations of the order @xmath230 .",
    "therefore , we believe that `` bulk  like '' composition fluctuations are not the major source of background terms . however , we can not rule out that the presence of an @xmath8 interface gives rise to enhanced composition fluctuations .",
    "another source of corrections to scaling stems from the fluctuations in the average interface position itself .",
    "since the effective interaction between the interface and the wall is rather weak , they give rise to a finite but large susceptibility away from the critical point .",
    "we have estimated the susceptibility from the curvature of @xmath231 close to the triple point ( i.e. , @xmath232 ) , and we have obtained values of the order @xmath233 ( and a smaller value is obtained if the interface is close to a wall . ) for the same system size as above , this yields composition fluctuations of the order @xmath234 ( a value which should be compared to @xmath235 ) .",
    "this observation partially rationalizes why the peak in the probability distribution of the composition close to @xmath3 is always broader than the peak which corresponds to the phase in which the interface is close to the wall .",
    "as we approach the critical temperature composition fluctuations grow . at the critical point",
    "the typical composition fluctuations are of the order @xmath236 , where we have used the critical exponents for the susceptibility @xmath237 and the correlation length @xmath238 appropriate for the 2d ising universality class .",
    "hence , for small system sizes typical fluctuations yield compositions which differ substantially from the critical composition ; only for very large sizes the composition fluctuates in the vicinity of the critical value .",
    "moreover , the critical density is much displaced from the symmetry axis @xmath3 and typical fluctuations in a finite system are cut - off by the constraint @xmath239 or @xmath240 . therefore , the susceptibility of a small system is reduced compared to the value expected from the leading scaling behavior .",
    "this observation is in accord with our monte carlo data , and a similar reasoning has been used by bruce and wilding@xcite in discussing background terms to the specific heat and the concomitant corrections to scaling in the energy distribution .      for the largest two film thicknesses @xmath142 and",
    "@xmath212 the interface localisation ",
    "delocalisation transition is first order and the concomitant two miscibility gaps join in a triple point . at this temperature",
    "an @xmath1-rich phase , a @xmath2rich phase and a phase where the interface is located in the middle of the film ( @xmath3 ) coexist .",
    "the coexisting phases correspond to three peaks in the distribution of the composition . upon increasing the lateral system size",
    "the peak positions do not shift ( as opposed to the behavior at the tricritical point ) , the peaks become more pronounced and configurations with intermediate compositions are more and more suppressed , because of the presence of interfaces between the coexisting phases .",
    "the composition of the system and the average interface position are related via @xmath241 ( integral criterium ) , where we assume that the coexisting bulk phases are almost pure , i.e. , @xmath242 or @xmath197 . from the probability distribution",
    "we then calculate the effective interface potential @xmath243 : @xmath244 in principle , not only fluctuations of the interface position @xmath245 but also `` bulk''like fluctuations contribute to composition fluctuations @xmath246 . since the wetting transition in a binary polymer blend occurs far below the critical point of the bulk , the bulk susceptibility is very small , and the latter contribution can be neglected .",
    "the dependence of the free energy per unit area on the position of the interface is a key ingredient into the theory of wetting.@xcite the interface interacts with the boundaries and the ( bare ) interface potential exhibits three minima .",
    "these correspond to the three coexisting phases .",
    "in the two phases with @xmath166 close to @xmath196 and @xmath197 , the interface is localized close to the wall , the interaction between the wall and the interface is rather strong , and the effective interface potential possesses a deep minimum . in the `` soft  mode ''",

    "if the two lines intersected there would also be a triple point in the symmetric case.@xcite since , the shift of the chemical potential @xmath158 is roughly proportional to the inverse film thickness ( kelvin equation ) we expect a triple point to occur only for much larger film thicknesses .",

    "this has been elucidated by phenomenological considerations and is qualitatively consistent with our simulation results .    since the critical point of the thin binary polymer film occurs at much lower temperature than the unmixing transition in the bulk , `` bulk  like '' composition fluctuations are only of minor importance .",
    "the dominant fluctuations of the composition of the film arise from capillary waves at the interface between the @xmath1rich and @xmath2rich regions in the film .",
    "the interaction between the walls and the interface is rather small , because it is mediated via the distortion of the interface profiles at the walls and the strength of the interaction decreases exponentially with the distance .",

    "the gross features of the phase diagram as well as our simulation and analysis techniques are not restricted to binary polymer fluids but generally apply to binary liquid mixtures in confined geometries . moreover , mean field calculations@xcite indicate that for small deviation from perfectly antisymmetric boundary conditions a qualitatively similar phase behavior emerges .",
    "the stronger the first order wetting transitions at the boundaries , the larger deviations from antisymmetry are permissible without alternating the topology of the phase diagram .",
    "hence , a thin binary film on a substrate against air / vacuum , where the substrate energetically favors one component of the mixture while the other component has an affinity to the air surface , is an experimental realization of the boundary conditions discussed here .",
