    "in the emerging field of nanoscale science and technology , understanding both the statics and the non - equilibrium dynamics of systems with many degrees of freedom in interaction with some external potential , as is commonly the case in solid state physics , is becoming a crucial issue .",
    "friction belongs to this category too , because the microscopic asperities of the mating surfaces may interlock and give rise to intriguing length scale competition mechanisms .    frequently , despite the basic level of details , simple phenomenological models of friction @xcite have revealed the ability of describing the main features of the complex microscopic dynamics , providing good qualitative agreement with experimental results on nanoscale tribology , or with more complex simulation data of sliding phenomena .",
    "with respect to this , the application of driven frenkel - kontorova - like ( fk ) systems @xcite , modeling the dissipative dynamics of a chain of interacting particles that slide over a rigid substrate potential due to the application of an external driving force , has found increasing interest as a possible interpretative key of the atomistic processes occurring at the interface of two materials in relative motion .    in particular , the remarkable idea of frictionless sliding connected with interface incommensurability , a pervasive concept of modern tribology named superlubricity @xcite , can be mathematically drawn in the framework of the fk model @xcite .",
    "when two contacting crystalline workpieces are incommensurate , due to lattice mismatch or to angular misalignment , the minimal force required to achieve sliding , i.e. the static friction , should vanish , provided the two substrates are stiff enough . in such a geometrical configuration , the surface mismatch can prevent asperity interlocking and collective stick - slip motion of the interface atoms , with a consequent negligibly small frictional force .",
    "systems achieving low values of dry sliding friction are of great physical and potentially technological interest , e.g. , to significantly reduce dissipation and wear in mechanical devices functioning at various scales .",
    "superlubricity , with usually consequent ultra - low dynamic friction , is experimentally rare , and has been demonstrated or implied in a relatively small number of cases , such as sliding graphite flakes on a graphitic substrate @xcite , cluster nanomanipulation @xcite , sliding colloidal layers @xcite , and inertially driven rare gas adsorbates @xcite .    until very recently , superlubricity has been practically observed only on the nanoscale .",
    "a short time ago , a breakthrough has been achieved , demonstrating the existence of superlubric regime of motion for micrometer size graphite samples @xcite and centimeter - long double walled carbon nanotubes ( dwcnts ) @xcite . with the current capability of synthesizing and manipulating quasi 1d atomically perfect objects of extended length , such as telescopic nanotubes @xcite , graphene nanoribbons @xcite , aromatic polymers @xcite , or soft biological filaments @xcite , nanotechnologies open now the possibility to transpose the peculiar nanoscale tribological properties to larger scales and exploit them to control sliding - induced energy dissipation in state - of - the - art technological devices .",
    "though , the robustness of the superlubricity phenomenon remains a challenge , and the conditions of its persistence or the mechanisms of its failure are cast as key questions to be addressed . even in clean wearless friction experiments with perfect atomic structures , superlubricity at large scales may surrender due to elasticity of contacting samples @xcite .",
    "a recent letter @xcite , via a fk modeling approach , has shown that the effective rigidity of an incommensurate slider , necessary condition for the occurrence of a superlubric regime , is strongly affected by the driving protocol used to induce motion . in an edge - driven configuration , where the external pulling or pushing force is applied to the edge of the slider , and which is typical for many tribological and nanomanipulation experiments performed with atomic force microscope , a slider critical length ( depending on intrinsic material properties and experimental parameters ) emerges above which superlubricity breaks down . here , we highlight new features of the transition from superlubric to high - friction state which occurs above the critical length .",
    "in particular , we consider different driving and commensurability configurations , discovering the occurrence of previously undetected multiple jumps in the friction force as a function of the slider length .",
    "we analyze in details the mechanisms leading to the striking boost in dissipated energy materializing abruptly , above the critical size , due to a localized deformation of the slider becoming commensurate to the underneath substrate lattice and thus giving rise to dynamical high - friction stick - slip regimes .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    ", we present the main features of the edge - driven fk - type model , briefly summarizing the simulation procedure .",
    "sections iii and iv are devoted to the numerical results elucidating the novel mechanisms of energy dissipation leading to the breakdown of superlubricity for long extended systems , together with a consistent analytical framework for the determination of the length critical size .",
    "sections v discusses relevant characteristics of the driving - induced commensurate dislocations in the slider , specifically in relation to their spatial localization and width depending on the system parameters .",
    "the novel occurrence of multiple commensurate walls is also presented .",
    "conclusions are given in the last section .",
    ", @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2.,width=321 ]    the mechanical and tribological properties of the quasi 1d nanostructures previously introduced can be analyzed in the framework of the frenkel - kotorova model @xcite .",
    "specifically , they are treated as finite chains of @xmath3 particles of mass @xmath4 , connected by springs of stiffness @xmath5 , having rest length @xmath6 , and driven on a sinusoidal potential with periodicity @xmath7 and amplitude @xmath8 representing the interaction with the substrate . as sketched in fig.[figure1 ] ( a ) the rightmost particle of the chain , with coordinate @xmath9 , is pulled or pushed at constant velocity @xmath10 through a spring of constant @xmath11 representing the lateral stiffness of the afm cantilever . as in real afm experiments the friction force @xmath12 is estimated by the lateral deflection of the cantilever , i.e. by the spring elongation @xmath13 $ ] .",
    "a useful dimensionless unit system is obtained setting @xmath6 as the unit length , @xmath14 as the unit time and @xmath15 as the unit energy , with this choice the equations of motion are : @xmath16 with the substrate force given by @xmath17 and elastic forces by @xmath18 in the dimensionless unit system @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "the work done by the external force excites the internal degrees of freedom of the driven nanostructure first , e.g. molecular modes , and is subsequently dissipated through the substrate degrees of freedom , i.e. phonons . to dispose off the extra energy injected by the external driving a viscous damping term",
    "has been included in the equations , @xmath23 is the dimensionless viscous coefficient if @xmath24 is the dimensional one , @xmath25 represents the characteristic time necessary for the energy dissipation .",
    "the equations of motion ( [ newton ] ) have been integrated numerically using a velocity - verlet algorithm .",
    "finite temperature simulations have been also performed by means of a langevin thermostat , however we found that up to @xmath26 the thermal effects do not lead to qualitative changes , thus we focus here on the case of t=0 only .",
    "all the quasi 1d systems previously discussed present some common feature : ( i ) their periodic atomic structure is incommensurate with respect to the substrate one ; ( ii ) their interatomic stiffness @xmath5 is sufficiently larger than the interfacial stiffness @xmath27 . in the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath28 ) , a continuum set of ground states that can be reached adiabatically through nonrigid displacement of chain atoms at no energy cost ( goldstone mode ) , with a consequent vanishing static friction @xcite .",
    "before discussing in detail the novel mechanism of dissipation leading to the breakdown of superlubricity for long chains , we start analyzing the frictional response as a function of the chain length first considering an overdense chain ( @xmath29 ) under pulling driving .",
    "the blue curve of fig.[figure1 ] ( b ) represents the typical friction force trend with an initial transient , due to the stretching of the chain , and the onset of a plateau where friction oscillates around constant average value . for very short chains edge effects",
    "might be predominant giving rise to a large average friction , only when @xmath30 these effects become negligible and a super - low friction state onsets , with our choice of parameters @xmath31 . at a critical particle number @xmath32 a sudden increase of the average friction force breaks the super - low friction regime .",
    "the time evolution of the friction force for a chain with @xmath33 is reported in fig.[figure1 ] ( b ) showing an abrupt jump during the initial transient almost doubling the average friction value in the steady sliding state plateau .",
    "a quantity intimately connected to friction is the energy dissipation , to better understand which changes affect the sliding motion for @xmath34 one can analyze how the power dissipated by the viscous damping is distributed along the chain .",
    "more precisely , in our dimensionless unit system , one can plot a normalized time - averaged power dissipated by the @xmath35-th atom : @xmath36 where , in the time interval @xmath37 over which the average is taken , the chains already reached the steady sliding state .",
    "for @xmath38 such a quantity is almost zero everywhere except at the edges , due to a slightly higher particle mobility but , as shown in fig.[figure2 ] ( a ) , for @xmath34 a narrow region appears , in a specific point of the chain , where dissipation increases by two orders of magnitude",
    ". a different chain arrangement must evidently give rise locally to a completely different and extremely dissipative sliding mechanism .        to further elucidate the local rearrangement of the particles it is convenient to plot the local commensuration index : @xmath39 i.e. a quantity close to one when two neighboring particles are locally in registry with the substrate and larger or smaller than one if the two particles are closer or far apart than @xmath7",
    ". a color map representing the time evolution of the commensuration index , from the initiation of driving to the onset of the steady sliding state , is plotted in fig.[figure2 ] ( e ) .",
    "a narrow yellow region where nearby particles are commensurate ( @xmath40 ) nucleates at the driving edge and propagates backward in the chain upon reaching a certain constant position @xmath41 .",
    "it works as a domain wall separating two incommensurate chain portions with @xmath42 on the left and @xmath43 on the right .",
    "fig.[figure2 ] ( i ) shows a cross section of the 2d color map taken at a large simulation time where the steady state is already reached , it clearly shows that the chain undergoes a linear stretching with a discrete jump in correspondence of the domain wall .",
    "it is easily understandable , and readily verified looking directly at the particle trajectories , that stick - slip motion insets within the wall region with a consequent enhancement of dissipation and loss of superlubricity .",
    "changing the driving mode from pulling to pushing , a jump in the friction force is also observed . as shown in fig.[figure2 ] ( f ) this corresponds to the nucleation , at the trailing edge , of a narrow domain wall region in which @xmath44 , i.e. a region of local commensuration where the compressed particles assume a periodicity half of the substrate lattice spacing @xmath7 . as in the pulling case this domain wall region",
    ", separating two incommensurate domains having @xmath45 on the left and @xmath46 , propagates forward in the chain up to a certain location @xmath41 .",
    "fig.[figure2 ] ( b ) shows the occurrence of a dissipation peak in analogy to the pulling case .",
    "the overall friction force experienced by the chain is smaller than in the pulling counterpart , while a @xmath47 commensuration requires in fact the wall particles to sit in the very bottom of the surface potential , with a consequent large effort to make them sliding forward , in a @xmath48 commensuration the two particles sharing the same potential valley will lie far from the minimum , less force is needed to push the wall forward .",
    "up to now we only considered overdense chains but , given the asymmetry between pushing and pulling driving , it is definitely interesting to investigate also the behavior of underdense chains , i.e. the case @xmath49 .",
    "also in this cases pushing and pulling give rise to very different behaviors as shown by fig.[figure2 ] ( g ) and ( h ) .",
    "again we have the nucleation and propagation of domain walls where the particles get commensurate with respect to the substrate potential , however , given the lower density of particles in the chain , upon pulling we reach a @xmath50 commensuration while upon pushing the particles are squeezed back to a @xmath47 configuration , see fig.[figure2 ] ( k ) and ( l ) . in both cases",
    "the commensurate particles live in the very bottom of the surface potential and , as in the overdense pulling case , the total friction force jumps by more than a factor two for @xmath34 .",
    "looking at the average dissipated power , shown in fig.[figure2 ] ( c ) and ( d ) , one might notice again a large peak in correspondence of the domain wall region , but also a pronounced dissipation elsewhere , contrary to the overdense analogs .",
    "in the underdense case this can be explained by a much larger variety of partially commensurate slider - substrate configurations , leading to a broader multiplicity of dissipation peaks .",
    "calculated numerically and given by eq.([fit ] ) for the pulling driving in the overdense and underdense case respectively .",
    "the fitting parameter is @xmath51 for the overdense case and @xmath52 for the underdense one .",

    "the explicit calculation will be carried out for the pulling of overdense chains only , the same arguments can be straightforwardly applied to the other three cases above presented .",

    "choosing @xmath51 we obtain a remarkable agreement between the analytic expression ( [ fit ] ) and the numerical results with @xmath74 as shown in figure [ figure5 ] ( a ) . only for large @xmath8 , namely @xmath75 , we start to see a significant discrepancy between the model and the simulations , for such a large @xmath76 value the adopted linear expansion is clearly insufficient and higher order therms should be included in eq.([fit ] ) .",
    "+ once again we stress that eq.([fit ] ) describes a viscous - like friction , proportional to @xmath10 and @xmath24 and only weakly dependent on @xmath8 and @xmath5 and is suitable for @xmath38 . for @xmath34 the domain wall region nucleating inside the driven chain",
    "is characterized by a stick - slip type of friction , increasing with @xmath8 and @xmath5 and practically independent of @xmath10 and @xmath24 , such an highly non - linear kind of motion can not be approximated with a power expansion .",

    "the external force @xmath88 necessary to commensurate the @xmath3 and @xmath89 particles with the underneath substrate potential can be easily calculated @xmath90 simply being the sum of the force necessary to stretch the first spring from its rest length @xmath6 to the substrate periodicity @xmath7 and the force payed by moving the @xmath3-th particle on the substrate potential .",
    "this expression depends of course on the absolute position of the chain edge but its smallest value , i.e. the smallest value @xmath77 necessary for the nucleation of the wall is : @xmath91 obtained when the @xmath3-th particle sits on a maximum . clearly for the other three cases presented in fig.[figure2 ]",
    "the nucleation condition , to be imposed in order to calculate @xmath77 , is different as the domain wall region is constituted by a different arrangement of the particles , as schematized by the cartoon insets of panels ( a)-(d ) .",
    "expression ( [ crit ] ) is exact and can be directly verified through the simulations . as shown in fig.[figure3 ] the @xmath77 value calculated from eq.([crit ] ) for different @xmath5 and @xmath8 , dashed lines , always match the value at which @xmath12 jumps vertically in the corresponding simulations , i.e. the force value at which the commensurate region nucleates . moreover , according to eq.([crit ] ) , the critical force does not depend on the length of the chain and on the dynamical parameters , i.e. the viscous damping and the driving velocity .",

    ", we only considered the incommensurability of the chain and substrate structures corresponding to the golden ratio , for which the difference between two periods is relatively large . in real systems with such a large period mismatch anharmonic effects are expected to play a role , but we believe they do not alter the overall picture obtained within the linear elasticity approximation adopted in our numerical and analytic models .",
    "moreover , the results here discussed are valid also for smaller misfits between the contacting lattices .",

    "finally it should be noted that our calculations of @xmath53 are based on the assumption that all particles of the chain experience the same microscopic friction proportional to the viscous damping coefficient . however , in realistic systems there could be additional contributions to friction coming from chemical interactions between the edge particles and the surface and/or defects in the chain structure .",
    "these effects will lead to an increase of the average friction force thus reducing the critical number of particles , which could benefit the experimental investigations of the mechanisms discussed here .",
    "+ repeating the same fitting procedure for the underdense condition of @xmath49 , we find @xmath52 the same value as before within the estimated error .",

    "as discussed in section [ main ] and immediately visible in fig.[figure2 ] , upon reaching the steady sliding state , the narrow domain wall region takes a well defined and constant position @xmath41 along the chain .",
    "this position is determined by the chain and substrate stiffness and by the dynamic parameters @xmath4 , @xmath24,@xmath110 . on the contrary @xmath41",
    "is not affected by an increase of the chain length , upon increasing @xmath3 the distance between the free edge and the domain wall is unchanged while the distance between the domain wall and the driven edge increase linearly .",
    "the only other quantity displaying such a behavior is the chain stretching , i.e. the slope of the curves in fig.[figure2 ] ( i)-(l ) , influenced by substrate and chain stiffness and by the driving conditions but independent of @xmath3 both above and below @xmath53 .",
    "it is thus clear that , once the driving dependent stretched state is reached , @xmath41 is solely determined by the interplay between the periodic substrate potential and the linearly increasing periodicity of the chain .",

    "before concluding we give a practical example of how eq.([eccola ] ) can be used to estimate the critical length for different systems whose tribological properties are experimentally accessible . among other , particularly interesting is the case of dwcnts where super - low friction has been observed up to the centimeter length - scale @xcite . for these systems",
    "the intrashell and intershell stiffness can be estimated as @xmath145 and @xmath146 @xcite , respectively , where the young s modulus @xmath147 tpa @xcite and intershell shear modulus @xmath148 gpa @xcite have been measured experimentally .",
    "experimental @xcite and numerical @xcite estimations of the damping coefficient give @xmath149 ps@xmath150 .",
    "the mass @xmath4 , can be calculated from the bulk density of carbon nanotubes as @xmath151 where @xmath152 kg / m@xmath153 is the bulk density , @xmath154 nm is the wall thickness@xcite and @xmath155 is the diameter .",
    "as an example of incommensurate dwcnts consider for instance an armchair tube inserted into a zigzag one , in such a case @xmath156 is roughly @xmath157 , where @xmath158 nm is the carbon - carbon bond length . for dwcnts with the diameter of the outer shell @xmath159 nm pulled with speed @xmath160 m/s through a force probe attached to one",
    "its ends @xcite , @xmath41 is estimated to be @xmath161 m. our theoretical model is thus partially validated by the experiment where the longest dwcnt manipulated was @xmath162 mm and is found to display a superlubric behavior .",
    "moreover eq.([eccola ] ) suggests that carbon based nanostructures , with a large internal stiffness @xmath5 due to the @xmath163 bond strength and a small @xmath142 due to the weak interplane interaction , are best candidates for further scaling up of superlubricity .",
    "summing up , in the framework of a frenkel - kontorova - like model , we have addressed the robustness of the superlubricity phenomenon in an edge - driven system at large scales , highlighting the mechanisms leading to its failure due to the slider elasticity .",

    "we have explored the distinctive nature of the transition from superlubric to high - friction sliding states which occurs above the critical size , discovering the occurrence of previously undetected multiple dissipative jumps in the friction force as a function of the slider length .",
    "these driving - induced commensurate dislocations in the slider are then characterized in relation to their spatial localization and width depending on the system parameters .",
