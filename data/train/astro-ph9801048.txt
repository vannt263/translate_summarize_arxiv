    "there is abundant evidence that strong anisotropies play a major role in the observed characteristics of radio loud active galactic nuclei ( agn ) and this has led to suggest a unification of all high - power radio sources ( barthel 1989 ; see antonucci 1993 and urry & padovani 1995 for a review ) .",
    "according to this scheme :    \\1 ) the lobe - dominated , steep - spectrum radio quasars ( ssrq ) and the core - dominated , flat - spectrum radio quasars ( fsrq ) are believed to be increasingly aligned versions of fanaroff - riley type ii ( fr  ii ; fanaroff & riley 1974 ) radio galaxies .",
    "\\2 ) the broad - line ( fwhm @xmath7 2000  ) radio galaxies ( blrg ) have a still uncertain place .",
    "they could represent either objects intermediate between quasars and radio galaxies , ( i.e. with the nucleus only partly obscured and the broad emission lines just becoming visible at the edge of the obscuring torus ) or low - redshift , low - power equivalent of quasars .    as expected from this scheme , a nuclear ,",
    "likely beamed x - ray component in quasars is quite well established in particular for fsrq and blazars ( wilkes & elvis 1987 ; shastri et al .",
    "1993 ; sambruna et al .",
    "1994 )    _ what about the lobe - dominated quasars and broad - line radio galaxies ? _",
    "we have observed with _ bepposax _ five lobe - dominated broad - line agn from the 2 jy sample of radio sources ( wall & peacock 1985 ) . these have been selected by taking the 10 sources ( out of the 16 present in a complete sub sample ) with estimated flux in the 0.1  10 kev band larger than @xmath8 erg @xmath9 s@xmath10 . unlike many previous studies of the x - ray spectra of radio sources , our sample is well - defined and unbiased ( apart from the obvious limitations of all flux - limited samples ) .",
    "the list of objects and their characteristics are given in table 1 km s@xmath10 mpc@xmath10 and @xmath11 have been adopted and spectral indices are written @xmath12 . ] .",
    "note that for these objects optical spectra ( tadhunter et al .",
    "1993 , 1997 ) , radio images and fluxes ( morganti et al . 1993 , 1997 ) and",
    "rosat all - sky survey and/or rosat pspc pointed observations ( siebert et al .",
    "1996 ) are available .",
    "in the last three columns of table 1 we summarize some information about the observations    data analysis was based on the linearized , cleaned event files obtained from the _ bepposax _ sdc on - line archive and on the ximage package .",
    "spectra were accumulated for each observations using the saxselect tool and the recommended extraction radii .",
    "spectral analysis was performed with the xspec 9.00 package , using the response matrices released by sdc in early 1997 .",
    "the spectra were rebinned such that each new bin contains at least 20 counts .",
    "spectral fits for the three objects for which lecs data were available show that the fitted n@xmath13 values are consistent with the galactic ones .",
    "we then assumed galactic n@xmath13 in the combined lecs and mecs fits .",
    "for the two objects without lecs data this assumption is also justified by the fact that the fit to the mecs data is not strongly dependent on n@xmath13 .    from the combined lecs and mecs",
    "fits all sources have very flat x - ray energy indices , with a mean value @xmath14 .",
    "one object ( phl 1657 ) shows evidence of a spectral break @xmath3 at @xmath15 kev .",
    "all our objects have rosat pspc data ( 4 targets and one from the rass ) .",
    "we then put the _ bepposax _ and rosat pspc data together to better constrain the shape of the x - ray spectra , especially at low energies .",
    "two of our sources , in fact , have no lecs data , while for the remaining three only less than 10 lecs bins are available below 1 kev .    at first",
    ", we fitted the _",
    "bepposax _ and rosat data separately with a single power - law model modified at low energies by absorption due to neutral gas in the galaxy . from this preliminary analysis",
    "it was clear that two different slopes for the power law are necessary at low and high energies .    ",

    "the results are summarized in table 2 .",
    "the combined spectra for the blrg 2152 - 69 and the ssrq phl 1657 are shown in figs.1 and 2 respectively .",

    "the spectra are obviously concave , with @xmath40 and energy breaks around 1.5 kev ( pictor a has a break at about 4 kev but with a large error due to the relatively small difference between the soft and the hard spectral indices ) .",
    "one source , pictor a , was also detected in the pds up to @xmath41 kev .",
    "the pds appears to lie on the extrapolation of the lecs and mecs fit , although given the relatively short pds exposure time ( 6.8 ks ) it is hard to be more quantitative .",
    "the rosat pspc images of our two lowest redshift objects , pictor a and pks 2152@xmath4269 , show evidence for an extended component , probably related to the diffuse emission from hot gas associated with early - type galaxies .",
    "addition of a thermal component to the power - law model results in a significant improvement of the fit , with best - fit gas temperatures @xmath3 kev .",
    "the thermal component , however , contributes only @xmath43 to the total x - ray flux , which is dominated by non - thermal ( power - law ) emission .",
    "our main results are :    \\1 ) lobe - dominated , broad - line agn have a hard x - ray spectrum with @xmath44 at @xmath45 kev similar to what found in core - dominated radio quasars .",
    "3 shows the @xmath2 kev energy indices for core dominated fsrq and for the objects in our sample .",
    "the fsrq sample is heterogeneous while our sample , although relatively small , is well defined and has very well determined spectral indices .",
    "nevertheless , the fsrq are characterized by @xmath46 , consistent with our results .",
    "\\2 ) various previous studies had found that ssrq displayed a steep soft x - ray spectrum .",
    "in fact , despite the hard component at higher energies , we nevertheless observe a steeper spectrum at lower energies .",
    "our best fits to the whole @xmath0 kev range indeed _ require _ a spectral break @xmath47 between the soft and hard energy slopes at about @xmath4 kev .",
    "the dispersion in the energy indices is larger for the soft component .",
    "we find @xmath48 while @xmath49 , which might suggest a more homogeneous mechanism at higher energies .",
