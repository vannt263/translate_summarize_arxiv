    "magnetic reconnection is the basic plasma process in which magnetic energy is converted to kinetic and thermal energies ( @xcite ) .",
    "it plays an important role in the dynamics of explosive coronal events , geomagnetic substorms , solar wind coupling to the magnetosphere , and magnetically confined fusion devices .",
    "early models ( @xcite ) and the predominance of numerical work on magnetic reconnection ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) have treated reconnection as two - dimensional . however , naturally occurring magnetic reconnection often begins in a localized region and spreads in the direction perpendicular to the plane of reconnection .",
    "for example , satellite observations of substorms in the magnetotail identified a dawn - dusk asymmetry caused by localized reconnection spreading in the westward direction ( @xcite ) .",
    "a similar asymmetry was observed in the formation of arcades in the solar corona ( @xcite ) .",
    "capturing effects such as these requires a fully three - dimensional treatment .",
    "a number of numerical studies have addressed x - line spreading in the direction of the current during quasi - two - dimensional reconnection . using a magnetic perturbation localized in the out - of - plane direction in hall - magnetohydrodynamics ( hall - mhd )",
    ", it was found that the localized reconnection signal propagates as a wave structure carried by the electron current ( @xcite ) . by seeding reconnection with large random magnetic perturbations in hall - mhd simulations ,",
    "it was observed that reconnection develops into spatially isolated structures that lengthen in the direction of the electron current and that these small structures merge into larger scale structures ( @xcite ) .",
    "it was also suggested in this study that spreading occurs in the direction of whichever species carries the current , which need not be exclusively electrons . spreading by the ions when they carry the current was observed in hybrid simulations with localized resistivity ( @xcite ) .",
    "the result of these works is that the reconnection x - line spreads in the out - of - plane direction by the current carriers in the direction of the current carriers ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite presented the first systematic study to vary the fraction of current carried by each of the species ; the results confirmed that x - line spreading occurs due to the current carriers .",
    "the results are not dependent on the harris sheet geometry ; @xcite observed x - line spreading in simulations of island coalescence .",
    "note , each of these studies primarily favored magnetotail applications , so they either treated anti - parallel reconnection or reconnection with a weak out - of - plane ( guide ) magnetic field compared to the background field .",
    "x - line spreading in a system without a guide field was recently observed in laboratory experiments at the magnetic reconnection experiment ( mrx ) , and a physical mechanism for spreading by current carriers was proposed ( @xcite ) .",
    "interestingly , experimental and satellite observations of systems with a strong guide field reveal strikingly different behavior of x - line spreading .",
    "for example , experiments performed at the versatile toroidal facility ( vtf ) ( @xcite ) exhibit reconnection beginning in a localized region and spreading bi - directionally in the out - of - plane ( toroidal ) direction at a speed consistent with the alfvn speed based on the guide field .",
    "another example is bi - directional spreading ( or elongating ) of ribbons observed during two - ribbon solar flares ( @xcite ) , including the bastille day flare ( @xcite ) .",
    "this presumably is related to spreading of the looptop reconnection site where a sizable guide field is likely to be present .",
    "this spreading was also inferred to take place at the local alfvn speed .",
    "prominence eruptions in the corona have also been observed to spread bi - directionally ; this behavior was attributed to magnetic reconnection propagating along the magnetic polarity inversion line ( pil ) ( @xcite ) . in magnetospheric contexts , observations of extended x - lines several earth radii long at the magnetopause ( @xcite ) and hundreds of earth radii in the solar wind ( @xcite )",
    "suggest that x - line spreading occurs in these areas as well , although direct evidence of spreading is prohibitively difficult with single- or even multi - point satellite observations .",
    "x - line spreading was also seen in three - dimensional two - fluid simulations with a guide field ( @xcite ) .",
    "the existing observational data provide a clear indication that the mechanism controlling x - line spreading strongly depends on the strength of the guide field . in the weak guide field limit",
    ", the signal is transmitted by the current carriers ; in the strong guide field limit , the reconnection signal is transmitted by the magnetic field as an alfvn wave .",
    "we hypothesize that , in general , the x - line spreads in both directions at the speed of whichever mechanism is faster for that direction . in this paper",
    ", we present an estimate of the critical guide field where the spreading mechanism changes and confirm the theory with three - dimensional two - fluid numerical simulations .    the layout of this paper is as follows .",

    "the important topics of how the sheets become thin and how the magnetic energy is stored is outside the scope of this paper .",
    "here , we develop a prediction of the speed at which the x - line spreads in each out - of - plane direction as a function of guide field and derive the critical guide field at which the mechanism causing the spreading changes from current carriers to alfvn waves .",
    "to do so , we make the following simplifying assumptions . we treat a quasi - two - dimensional system , meaning that the equilibrium parameters do not depend strongly on the direction normal to the reconnection plane for all time .",
    "we assume the current layer is flat , so that the current sheet is either not curved or that the curvature does not strongly contribute to the dynamics .",
    "we assume the plasma parameters are symmetric on either side of the current layer ; asymmetries ( @xcite ) are not considered here .",
    "finally , we assume that a single mode dominates the dynamics ; in previous simulations , it was shown that when multiple modes of reconnection occur , they can impede the spreading of x - lines ( @xcite ) .",

    "we perform a similar analysis for the spreading speed in the direction of the ions @xmath22 .",

    "qualitatively , the data reveal that the nature of x - line spreading is sensitive to the strength of the guide field . to interpret this more quantitatively , we first discuss the estimated uncertainties in our speed measurements . if we use a higher value of the current threshold @xmath128 , the spreading speed changes on the order of 15 - 20% , which we take as the uncertainty .",
    "we note that for the large guide field runs @xmath116 , the speeds in either direction are within the uncertainties of each other .",
    "however , for @xmath143 , the speeds in either direction are separated by more than their uncertainty .",
    "these two results suggest that the spreading mechanism is the same in both directions for @xmath116 and is different in either direction for @xmath143 , which quantitatively agrees with eq .",

    "( [ vxi]).,width=326 ]    in conclusion , the mechanism of x - line spreading in the out - of - plane direction is qualitatively different depending on the strength of the guide magnetic field .",
    "for @xmath145 , x - line spreading occurs bi - directionally along the guide field at the alfvn speed . for @xmath146 ,",
    "x - line spreading occurs bi - directionally along the guide field , but the spreading speed in the direction of the current carriers is the speed of the current carriers and in the direction opposite of the primary current carriers the spreading speed is the alfvn speed .",
    "measurements of x - line spreading for the hyper - resistive reconnection that precedes hall reconnection agree with the results obtained from measuring the hall reconnection spreading ( not shown ) .",
    "therefore , the main result of this study applies both to hall and hyper - resistive reconnection in a two - fluid model .",
    "in summary , the mechanism of x - line spreading in the out - of - plane direction is qualitatively different for strong guide magnetic fields than it is for weak guide fields . for weak guide fields ,",
    "the reconnection signal is propagated by the current carriers , as has previously been established ; for strong guide fields , the reconnection signal is propagated by alfvn waves along the guide field . in general , the spreading speed in either out - of - plane direction is given by the maximum of the speed of the current carriers in that direction and the alfvn speed based on the guide field , as given by eq .",
    "( [ spreadpred ] ) .    because the changeover from one spreading mechanism to the other is abrupt",
    ", there is a critical guide field strength ( for each direction ) at which the nature of the spreading switches .",
    "this critical field depends only on the strength of the reconnecting magnetic field , the ion inertial scale , the thickness of the electron dissipation region , and the fraction of the current carried by each species , as given by eq .",
    "( [ genbcrit ] ) . when the guide field @xmath12 exceeds the critical field , the spreading is due to alfvn waves ; when it is smaller , the spreading is due to the current carriers .",
    "the weak guide field result is consistent with previous numerical work of x - line spreading  ( @xcite ) , but the new result generalizes the predictions to include a guide field .",
    "the present results may be relevant for interpreting observations of reconnection in many settings .",
    "for example , in laboratory experiments , x - line spreading has been observed to be bi - directional and at the alfvn speed in the strong guide field limit ( @xcite ) and uni - directional in the small guide field limit ( @xcite ) .",
    "these results are consistent with the results of the present study .",
    "another potential application is for solar flares .",
    "two - ribbon flare evolution is marked by the ribbons moving apart from each other as time evolves , which is interpreted as newly reconnected field lines piling on top of previously reconnected field lines .",
    "in addition to this behavior , bi - directional spreading or elongation of the ribbon in the direction parallel to the ribbons along the polarity inversion line has been observed ( @xcite ) .",
    "it was shown that the spreading speed was consistent with the alfvn speed ( @xcite ) . since the reconnection driving the flare is most likely to have a sizable guide field , the present results suggest that this type of bi - directional spreading at the alfvn speed would be expected .",
    "the bastille day flare exhibits this spreading , as well ( @xcite ) . from geometrical considerations of the magnetic fields of the flare loops",
    ", it was argued that the guide field was of comparable size as the reconnecting field , with @xmath147 times the reconnecting field ( @xcite ) .",
    "we can check this using the present results and the observed properties of the spreading . from the observations , the spreading speed ranged between @xmath148 ( @xcite ) .",
    "let us assume the spreading is governed by alfvn waves .",
    "assuming an average density of @xmath149 ( @xcite ) , the guide field ranges from @xmath150 g using eq .",
    "( [ cag ] ) .",
    "the motion of the ribbons normal to the ribbons was @xmath151 ( @xcite ) , which is expected to be correlated to the inflow speed at the reconnection site .",
    "since the inflow speed is often taken to be 0.1 of the alfvn speed based on the reconnecting field , the reconnecting field strength @xmath152 g. these results suggest the guide field is about 0.1 - 0.7 of the reconnecting field . despite the large uncertainties , the two techniques give similar results .",
    "this analysis is obviously oversimplified and merely presented as an example of how the results can be used , but it is hoped that future work will allow for a meaningful assessment of the relative strengths of the guide and reconnecting fields .",
    "the reason this may be useful , as emphasized by @xcite , is that the strength of the guide field is known to influence the production of secondary islands ( @xcite ) , and it has been suggested that the presence of secondary islands ( plasmoids ) is important for particle acceleration ( @xcite ) .    another interesting application is for reconnection in the solar wind , where reconnection x - lines extending hundreds of earth radii have been reported ( @xcite ) .",
    "one can ask whether the spreading of reconnection in the out - of - plane direction could allow the x - line to be that long . to estimate the size of x - lines ,",
    "assume that reconnection begins close to the sun with an initially small finite length in the out - of - plane direction .",
    "suppose the reconnection site convects out with the solar wind at a speed @xmath153 .",
    "( for simplicity , this calculation ignores variations in solar wind speed , magnetic field strength , and plasma density as a function of distance from the sun . )",
    "then , the time it takes to get to a position @xmath154 away from the sun is @xmath155 .",
    "if the speed of the spreading of the x - line is @xmath156 , then the extent @xmath157 of the x - line at @xmath154 is @xmath158 , which gives the upper limit on the length of the x - line that could arise in the solar wind .",
    "one can test the implications of this from the observations of the reconnection event in the @xcite study , where a solar wind speed is inferred to be @xmath159 .",
    "the satellite observations occurred near the earth , so @xmath160 . the alfvn speed based on a guide field of strength @xmath161 nt and density",
    "@xmath162 ( @xcite ) is @xmath163 .",
    "if we take this as the spreading speed @xmath156 , then the maximum length of the x - line is @xmath164 .",
    "this exceeds the length of the x - line reported by @xcite , which was 390 @xmath165 . in this event ,",
    "the strength of the guide field was 0.35 of the reconnecting field , so the alfvn speed is the slower of the two velocities and the extent of the x - line if spreading is due to current carriers is even longer .",
    "thus , while this calculation assumes that the reconnection proceeds at short distance from the sun , it gives an indication that it is not impossible to achieve reconnection x - lines of the lengths reported by @xcite .",
    "further work is necessary to make more careful comparisons of the theory to data .",
    "we conclude by collecting some assumptions of this work . we treat our system as quasi - two - dimensional , meaning any variation in the system in the direction of",
    "the current is negligible .",
    "the current sheet in all simulations performed are initially thin , meaning that free magnetic energy has already been stored .",
    "the plasma parameters across the current sheet are assumed symmetric .",
    "the simulations employ a two - fluid model , which does not fully capture electron scale physics .",
    "this may make quantitative changes to our results ( such as the estimate of @xmath8 and the size of @xmath7 ) , but we do not expect qualitative changes to the theoretical results . also , the simulations are isothermal and contain no thermal conduction .",
    "another main assumption is that only a single mode is dominating the dynamics .",
    "however , the role of multiple oblique modes can play an important part of the dynamics of the spreading process . as seen in our simulations , the x - line structure is identifiable at early times but as the complicated nature of the oblique modes develop , the x - line structure break up due to the interaction between the current sheet .",
    "the interaction of oblique modes can impede x - line spreading  ( @xcite ) .",
