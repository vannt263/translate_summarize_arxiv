    ", this ` classical ' procedure can also predict an average galaxy age - metallicity relation .",
    "nevertheless , no underlying approximate physical model is assumed in these works for the galaxy formation and evolution .    in this paper ,",

    "the sculptor dwarf galaxy was discovered by @xcite .",
    "although it might appear simple at first glance , from the study of the kinematical , chemical and spatial distribution of its stellar populations , @xcite were able to disentangle in this galaxy an inner , kinematically ` cold ' , metal - rich stellar population from an outer ` hot ' metal - poor one , later on confirmed by @xcite and @xcite .",

    "[ fig : cmd_observed ] ) , which were able to resolve stars down to the oldest main sequence turn - off ( msto ) of the sculptor dsph , by taking advantage of the deep wide - field photometry of ctio / mosaic . in order to avoid a non - negligible contamination of foreground mw disc field stars",
    ", we consider only stars along the line - of - sight to the sculptor dsph with elliptical radius @xmath2 and corresponding to clean isolated detections ; the percentage of stars with these characteristics in the @xcite catalog is about @xmath7 per cent of the entire sample .",

    "is played by the galactic outflows , which are predicted to occur very soon in these galaxies because of their shallow potential well ; the intensity of the outflow rate is assumed to be directly proportional to the sfr . on the one hand , if the efficiency for the gas removal is high ( typically @xmath34 ) , then the galaxy gas mass suddenly decreases and hence the sfr rapidly drops to zero ; on the other hand , if the galactic wind has a relatively lower efficiency ( typically @xmath35 ) , then the decrease in the sfr is smoother and it drops to zero on longer typical time - scales .     per cent of the stars",
    "observable at the present time are formed within the first @xmath36 of the galaxy evolution ; this time corresponds to the vertical dashed blue line in the figures .",
    "furthermore , the number of stars with initial metallicity @xmath37 is roughly @xmath38 per cent of the total number of stars alive at the present time .",
    ", width=351 ]      we have explored the parameter space , by running a large number of chemical evolution models .",
    "the best parameters for sculptor are found by minimizing the @xmath39 figure of merit , with the best model being the one reproducing the shape of the observed stellar mdf , which represents the most reliable observational constraint to any slight variation of the free parameters .",
    "we vary the sfe in the range @xmath40-@xmath41 , the wind efficiency in the range @xmath42-@xmath43 , and the infall time - scale in the range @xmath44-@xmath45 . in order to allow our photo - chemical model to be more flexible when comparing its predictions with data",
    ", we make the further approximation of assuming the galactic wind to be always active over the whole galaxy lifetime ; since all the galaxy physical properties in our chemical evolution model are normalized with respect to the infall mass , this assumption causes the predicted stellar mdf not to be influenced by the variation of the infall mass . in this simplified formulation of the galactic wind , all the galaxy physical properties ( such as the sfr , stellar mass , gas mass , and so on ) simply scale with the infall mass and our results can be easily readjusted for a different assumption of the cutoff in the elliptical radius of sculptor stars ( here we consider only stars with @xmath46 ) .",
    "we find that the best chemical evolution model is characterized by the following parameters :    1 .",
    "star formation efficiency @xmath47 ; 2 .",
    "wind efficiency @xmath10 ; 3 .",
    "infall time - scale @xmath12 .",
    "we assume at the beginning a reference infall mass @xmath48 , as in @xcite , for which we predict a present - day total stellar mass @xmath49 .",
    "the infall mass of the best model is then obtained by rescaling our results for the reference model so as to have the same number of stars in the synthetic and observed cmd .",
    "we find for our best model an infall mass @xmath50 , giving rise to a present - day total stellar @xmath51 , larger than the value @xmath52 estimated by @xcite , but of the same order of magnitude .",
    "according to the fitting formula of @xcite , which is assumed in many recent works to mimic a cosmologically motivated infall in galaxy formation and evolution models , dwarf galaxies with @xmath53 must have accreted almost @xmath54 per cent of their cumulative infall mass ( which turns out to be @xmath55 ) in the first @xmath56 of their evolution , namely from redshift @xmath57 to redshift @xmath58 , a larger timescale than the one found by our best model ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "nevertheless , we remark on the fact that the @xcite fitting formula is strictly valid only in the redshift range @xmath60 , namely only after the reionization epoch ; therefore , a comparison with the gas mass assembly history of our model is not straightforward .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : mdf ] the predicted stellar mdf of the best model ( convolved with a gaussian function with @xmath61 ) is compared with the observed one @xcite .",
    "the assumed very low sfe causes the mdf to be peaked at low @xmath62 $ ] abundances .",
    "the width of the mdf is mostly determined by the wind efficiency ; in particular , the lower the @xmath63 parameter , the wider is the bulk of the galaxy star formation activity and hence also the mdf .    in figure",
    "[ fig : sfh]a ) we show the predicted sfh of our best model , while in figure [ fig : sfh]b ) we show the corresponding age - metallicity relation . in summary , the length of the bulk of the galaxy star formation activity can be regulated in our model by suitably varying the main parameters determining the star formation and outflow intensity and the galaxy gas accretion rate ; these parameters are the sfe , which determines the intensity of the sfr and the rate of thermal energy injection by supernovae , the wind efficiency , which determines the slope with which the sfr drops to zero , and the infall time - scale , which crucially determines the evolution with time of the galaxy potential well .",
    "the stepwise structure of the photo - chemical model is the following .    1 .",
    "we sample the galaxy sfh , as predicted by our best chemical evolution model for sculptor , to randomly extract an age for the formation of a given star .",
    "2 .   we sample the assumed initial mass function ( imf ) to randomly assign a mass to the star . in this work",
    "we assume the @xcite imf for simplicity .",
    "we use the age - metallicity relation of our best sculptor chemical evolution model to find the initial metallicity of the star .",
    "4 .   given the age , mass and metallicity of the star",
    ", we check whether the star is alive or not at the present time , by assuming the metallicity dependent stellar lifetimes we have derived from the parsec stellar evolutionary tracks ( see section [ sec : lifetimes ] ) .",
    "if the star can be observed at the present time , we store the photometric properties of the synthetic star , to later draw it in the synthetic cmd .    on the one hand ,",
    "the strength of our method resides in the very fine grid of the assumed isochrone database ; moreover , in our approach , we start from the predictions of chemical evolution models , assuming _ ab initio _ an underlying galaxy formation and evolution scenario , which is physically - motivated . on the other hand ,",
    "the main shortcoming of our model is due to the fact that the lowest available metallicity in the parsec database is @xmath16 .",
    "we assume that all the stars with @xmath64 have the same photometric properties as the stars with @xmath65 .",
    "this fact can introduce a systematic error . by looking at figs .",

    "in particular , we first divide the observed cmd in an uniform grid and , for each grid element @xmath67 , we compute the average v- and i - band observed photometric errors , @xmath68 , which we adopt as the standard deviations of the photometric noise in the @xmath67-th grid element . hence , for any given @xmath69-th synthetic star residing in the @xmath67-th grid element , we add the following noise to its predicted v- and i - band magnitudes : @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is a random number , drawn according to the standard normal distribution . in this way",
    ", the model ` spreads out ' according to the errors in the data and we can fairly compare the synthetic with the observed cmd .",
    "the synthetic cmd corrected for the photometric noise is then convolved with the results of the artificial star test performed by @xcite . in particular , by following a standard procedure , @xcite inserted in the observed images a large catalog of artificial stars ; after reducing and analyzing the altered images , they could compute the fraction of artificial stars recovered in the data as a function of their input magnitude and color .",
    "we use the results of their test to compute the recovered fraction in each grid element , so as to throw out from the synthetic cmd the remaining lost fraction . by means of this type of analysis",
    ", one can apply to the synthetic cmd the same completeness profile as is present in the data .",
    "after correcting the synthetic cmd for the incompleteness , the number of synthetic stars strongly reduces , becoming @xmath72 .",
    "in this section , we present the results of our photo - chemical model for the cmd of the sculptor dsph .",
    "the main result of our work in shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cmd_result ] , where the synthetic cmd of sculptor ( left diagram ) is compared with the observed one ( right diagram ) . in order to better understand where the discrepancies between the observed and the synthetic cmd reside , in fig .",
    "[ fig : residuals ] we plot the residuals , which correspond to the color - coding in the figure .",
    "in particular , to better visualize the differences , we define the residual in the @xmath67-th grid element as : @xmath73 with @xmath74 and @xmath75 being the number of stars in the observed and synthetic cmd , respectively .",
    "the regions of the observed sculptor cmd without any synthetic star are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : residuals ] as a greyscale density plot .    on the one hand , by a visual inspection of figs .",
    "[ fig : cmd_result ] and [ fig : residuals ] , we can obtain a quite good agreement for the red giant branch ( rgb ) , the horizontal branch ( hb ) and the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) of the observed cmd . on the other hand , at fainter magnitudes , particularly in the sub - giant branch ( sgb ) and at the msto , the observed cmd extends towards slightly bluer colors than the synthetic one . moreover , our model can not reproduce the observed population of blue straggler stars which extend the main sequence towards blue colors and could be  in principle  reproduced by including the effect of merging binary stellar systems . we do not include blue straggler stars in our photo - chemical model .",
    "we remark on the fact that it is not obvious that a model reproducing the chemical evolution of sculptor can also capture the main features of the observed galaxy cmd .",
    "in fact , the final configuration of the synthetic cmd turns out to be highly affected by the variation of the free parameters of chemical evolution models . in particular , by increasing the sfe , the stellar metallicities accordingly increase at any fixed galactic time , causing the entire synthetic cmd to shift towards redder colors .",
    "the imf acts in a similar way as the sfe , with the additional effect of filling up the various stellar evolutionary phases in the cmd with different relative fractions .",

    "msto stars are predicted to reside in the synthetic cmd at @xmath79 , whereas sgb stars at @xmath80 .",
    "the peak in the @xmath77-band stellar luminosity function at @xmath81 is caused by hb stars .",
    ", width=351 ]    at a first glance , our photo - chemical model is able to predict and qualitatively reproduce the main features of the observed @xmath76-color distribution ; in particular , the first peak in fig .",
    "[ fig : vi_histo]a ) ( the one at bluer colors ) is determined by the msto and sgb stars , whereas the second peak ( the one at redder colors ) is the signature left by the ascending rgb and hb stars .    concerning the blue portion of the color distribution , from a visual inspection of fig . [",
    "fig : vi_histo]a ) , we can not reproduce the observed population of blue straggler stars , which  as aforementioned  are not included in our photo - chemical model .",
    "furthermore , a remarkable discrepancy resides in the decaying trend of the blue wing of the predicted color distribution , which contains a lower number of stars than the data , and in the predicted ` saddle ' , which turns out to be higher than the observed one .",
    "this can be also appreciated by looking at the residual plot in fig [ fig : residuals ] , where the observed cmd clearly contains a larger number of msto and sgb stars with blue colors than the synthetic cmd .",
    "this discrepancy seems likely the signature of metal - poor stellar populations in the sculptor dsph , which our one - zone chemical evolution model has not been able to capture . nevertheless , in principle",
    ", it could also indicate a predicted age - metallicity relation which is steeper than what seems to be required by observations ; in fact , one would obtain a similar discrepancy if also the synthetic metal - rich stars are older than the observed ones .",
    "interestingly , by looking at fig .",
    "[ fig : mdf ] , the observed stellar mdf suggests the presence of two distinct peaks , corresponding to two separated main stellar populations in the galaxy .",
    "the latter feature can not be resolved by our best chemical evolution model , which indeed predicts the stellar mdf to have a single peak , lying between the two of the observed distribution .",
    "we remark on the fact that this feature is peculiar to the @xcite mdf , which combines the dart sample  determining the low metallicity portion of the observed mdf  with the one by @xcite , concentrated towards slightly higher metallicity .",
    "the regions where the observed cmd contains a larger number of blue ( metal - poor ) stars than the synthetic one likely correspond to the low - metallicity peak in the observed mdf , which is also the most pronounced one .",
    "accordingly , the higher ` saddle ' in the predicted color distribution ( see the top panel in fig . [",
    "fig : vi_histo ] ) confirms that the model predicts galaxy stellar populations which are intermediate between the observed metal - poor and metal - rich ones .",
    "the observed stellar mdf , as derived by @xcite , includes stars with @xmath82 , namely beyond the radial cutoff we assume for the observed cmd .",
    "as one moves towards the outer zones of the galaxy , the sculptor stellar populations are observed to become increasingly old and metal - poor , determining the observed stellar mdf at low metallicity .",
    "nevertheless , the relative number of stars also increasingly diminishes when moving outwards , with almost @xmath83 per cent of the @xcite sample being contributed by stars with @xmath84 .",
    "furthermore , the shape of the observed stellar mdf in the inner radial bins does not significantly vary at low metallicity with respect to the mdf in the outer bins ( see figure 14 of @xcite ) . therefore ,",
    "if we had applied a radial cutoff at @xmath85 also to the observed mdf , our analysis would not have been significantly altered .    a viable solution to reduce the discrepancy between the observed and the synthetic cmd would be , for example , to disentangle the two different stellar populations in the observed mdf , by assuming two underlying separated distributions , peaked at slightly lower and higher @xmath62 $ ] abundances than the predicted mdf of the best model . in this way",
    ", the metal - poor stellar population could be reproduced by assuming a lower sfe than the metal - rich one .",
    "after superimposing the two stellar populations in the synthetic cmd with appropriate weights , one would extend the synthetic cmd towards slightly bluer color , hence obtaining a better agreement with the observed cmd .",
    "finally , we can not exclude that the lack of binary stars in our photo - chemical model might also contribute to the discrepancy between the observed and the synthetic cmd , since their inclusion would cause a broadening of the ms and therefore a redistribution of the colors of the synthetic stars in fig .",
    "[ fig : vi_histo]a ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : vi_histo]b ) , the observed stellar @xmath77-band luminosity function is compared with the predicted one . for the rgb and agb stars",
    ", there is a good agreement between the model and data .",
    "furthermore , the model predicts a peak at @xmath86 , which represents the effect of hb stars ; the presence of this peak is not visible in the observed @xmath77-band stellar luminosity function because of the large foreground contamination in the redder part of the observed cmd , both at fainter and at brighter @xmath77-band magnitudes than the ones of the observed hb . if we had considered only sculptor stars in the innermost regions of the galaxy ( e.g. with @xmath87 ) , we would have obtained a well agreement between model and data also for the hb stars . at fainter magnitudes , the model in fig .",
    "[ fig : vi_histo]b ) contains a larger number of msto and a lower number of sgb stars than the data ; this discrepancy might be partly due to the inherent uncertainty in the assumed completeness profile , which is particularly important for these evolutionary stages , as well as it could also indicate the need for an imf with a lower number of low - mass stars than the @xcite imf assumed in this work .",
    "in this work , we have presented a new approach to draw the synthetic cmd of galaxies .",
    "in particular , we have developed _ ab - initio _ a new photo - chemical model , which we have applied to reproduce the observed cmd of sculptor dsph .",
    "our numerical code starts from the predictions of chemical evolution models about the galaxy sfh and age - metallicity relation .",
    "then , by assuming the parsec stellar evolutionary tracks , we can ` light up ' the stars with different age , mass and metallicity of chemical evolution models , in order to draw a synthetic cmd .",
    "we have defined the best chemical evolution model for sculptor as the one reproducing the observed galaxy stellar mdf .",
    "several improvements could be done in our photo - chemical model , by considering for example an underlying cosmological framework , whose primary effect would be to influence the evolution of the galaxy gas mass assembly with time .",
    "interestingly , a very first attempt to draw the cmd of a dsph galaxy within a full cosmological framework by making use of a semi - analytical model for the galaxy formation and evolution is represented by the work of @xcite , which adopted the freely available iac - star code @xcite , however , they did not provide a detailed discussion of their findings about the predicted galaxy cmd .",
    "a further improvement in our photo - chemical model would be to include the effects of unresolved binary stars and foreground contamination in the synthetic cmd .",
    "the strength of our approach resides in the statistical sampling of the galaxy predicted sfh and assumed imf , as well as in the assumption of a very fine grid of stellar isochrones , both in metallicity and in age .",
    "the main shortcoming is related to the parsec stellar isochrones , which are computed only for @xmath88 .",
    "the sfh can be regulated in our models for dsphs by suitably varying the main parameters triggering the onset of the galactic wind and determining its intensity .",
    "in fact , once the galactic wind has started , the sfr rapidly drops to zero , since most of the infall mass has been accumulated fast within short typical time - scales .",
    "our best model for sculptor predicts that @xmath89 per cent of the stars observable at the present time are formed within the first @xmath36 of the galaxy evolution .",
    "we predict at the present time a total stellar mass @xmath51 , which is of the same order of magnitude as other estimates like @xmath52 by @xcite .",
    "also the predicted evolution of the sfr as a function of time is in agreement with the findings of @xcite .",
    "stellar systems or interstellar regions with low gas density , such as low - mass dwarf galaxies or the outer parts of spiral galaxies , likely follow a star formation law which deviates from the usually assumed schmidt - kennicut law , @xmath31 ; for this reason , we have done some numerical experiments by assuming the same expression for the star formation rate as in the original work of @xcite ( see also @xcite for a detailed study in the context of hydrodynamical simulations ) . by assuming the @xcite law , we predict the sfh to be more concentrated in the earliest epoch of the galaxy evolution and the metallicity z to initially evolve more rapidly than our best - fitting model ; then , at later times , z remains quite constant when the @xcite law is assumed , while it increases in our best - fitting model .",
    "finally , we find that the final total gas and stellar mass are almost the same when the two different expressions for the star formation rate are assumed .",
    "we have shown that our photo - chemical model is able to capture the main features of the observed cmd of the sculptor dsph , with the best agreement being obtained for the rgb , hb and agb stars .",
    "the discrepancy has been found at fainter luminosity in the msto and sgb , where the observed cmd extends towards bluer colors than the synthetic one . that may be caused by underlying metal - poor stellar populations which our photo - chemical model has not been able to capture as well as to the lack of binary stars in our model , which would also broaden the synthetic cmd at faint magnitudes .",
    "in fact , the predicted stellar mdf is characterized by a single peak , whereas the observed one suggests the presence of two peaks , residing at slightly lower and higher @xmath62 $ ] abundances than the model peak . in particular , the more pronounced peak in the observed",
    "mdf corresponds to the one at lower @xmath62 $ ] abundances .",
    "therefore , our photo - chemical model contains stellar populations which are intermediate between the metal - poor and the metal - rich ones in the observed stellar mdf .    in order to reduce the discrepancy",
    ", one could superimpose the results of multiple one - zone chemical evolution models and find the linear combination which provides the best agreement with the observed stellar mdf",
    ". this will be the subject of a future work , in which we will also show the effect of varying the free parameters of chemical evolution models on the synthetic cmd .",
    "although the uncertainties in the assumed completeness profile can be important at the msto and sgb , the discrepancy between model and data in the @xmath77-band stellar luminosity function for @xmath90 might be alleviated by assuming an imf which contains a lower number of low - mass stars than the @xcite imf assumed in this work and by including the effect of binary stars .",

    "<S> the main discrepancies are found at fainter magnitudes in the main sequence turn - off and sub - giant branch , where the observed cmd extends towards bluer colors than the synthetic one ; we suggest that this is a signature of metal - poor stellar populations in the data , which can not be captured by our assumed one - zone chemical evolution model .    </S>",
