    "the so - called galactic molecular ring ( gmr ) is a ridge of intense emission which dominates the appearance of extended co gas in the longitude - velocity ( @xmath3-@xmath4 ) diagram of our galaxy ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this prominent feature marks a region of enhanced molecular density roughly halfway between the sun and the galactic center , at galactocentric radii ( r ) between 4 and 6  kpc , which has been shown to likely trace gas emission from the inner spiral arms ( e.g. , @xcite ) . toward the galactic center ,",

    "these structures include the connecting arm ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the near and far 3  kpc arms ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and the norma arm as it is traced toward the galactic center ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",

    "these dust lanes , often observed offset toward the leading edges of the bar structure in barred spirals , have been identified as tracers of shocks ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) . in the following discussion , we will assume a general picture of the inner galaxy as depicted in @xcite , which accounts for the presence of two bar - like components : the boxy - bulge ( i.e. , the galactic bar ) and the long bar .    in this paper",

    "evidence for a substantially flat rotation curve which drops inwards at small galactocentric radii are commonly observed for barred galaxies with rotation velocities comparable to the milky way ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "moving from the star - forming region closest to the galactic center ( g010.47@xmath3000.02 ) to the one farthest from the center ( g023.44@xmath3100.18 ) , we start to fix the positions of the major arm - like features of the inner milky way on a coherent face - on view ( figure  [ positions ] ) . in the following ,",

    "the connecting arm , as fixed by the position of g010.47@xmath3000.02 at r@xmath65  kpc , apparently runs along the far edge of the long bar , probably closer to the galactic center than the far 3  kpc arm , constrained at a similar longitude by the position of g012.02@xmath3100.03 at r@xmath66  kpc .",

    "however , our measurements still allow us to start discussing two specific topics .",
    "firstly , if the star - forming region g010.47@xmath3000.02 is located in the connecting arm at a longitude of @xmath42 , then it is close to the far edge of both the galactic and `` long '' bars in the first galactic quadrant ( figure  [ positions ] ) .",
    "according to ( * ? ? ?",
    "* their section  4 ) , streamlines of gas crossing the major axis of a bar strongly decelerate near their maximum radial excursion , where gas approaches a potential minimum ( e.g. , figure  5 and  6 of @xcite ) . a major effect of slowing down abruptly would be that gas piles up until a shock occurs ( i.e. , the locus of the connecting arm ) .",
    "we find for g010.47@xmath3000.02 that the v@xmath18 velocity component of @xmath75  kms@xmath10  ( in the direction of galactic rotation ) is slower by almost a factor of 2 than the circular rotation speed beyond 4 kpc in the galaxy .",
    "while the rotation curve is expected to drop toward the center owing to less mass enclosed , a nearby hmsfr belonging to the far 3  kpc arm ( g012.02@xmath3100.03 ) shows a rotation speed of @xmath76  kms@xmath10 .",
    "this evidence suggests that the v@xmath18 value of g010.47@xmath3000.02 is likely related to the local gas dynamics , and represents an argument in favor of the shock phenomenon as the origin of its peculiar motion .",
    "the position of the connecting arm with respect to the axis of the bar(s ) , and the direction of the gas flow along the connecting arm itself ( u@xmath18 component in table  [ tabinner ] ) , should be intimately related to the presence of an inner lindblad resonance ( ilr ) close to the galactic center ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "if an ilr is present , or equivalently if the @xmath60 family of stable periodic orbits exist ( i.e. , orbits oriented perpendicular to the bar major axis ) , the shock locus should be offset toward the leading edge of the bar ; the larger the @xmath60 orbit along the bar minor axis , the bigger will be the offset of the connecting arm with respect to the major axis of the bar ( e.g. , figure  5 of @xcite ) .",
    "the position of g010.47@xmath3000.02 is offset by about 1.3  kpc ( i.e. , @xmath77 ) from the direction of the major axis of the long bar . while we can not rule out an overestimate of our distance measurement by @xmath78 , the current measurement supports the connecting arm being shifted forward ( clockwise in phase ) toward the far side of the bar in the first galactic quadrant , or alternatively it supports the presence of an ilr .",
    "* their figure  6 ) also predict that a shock - focusing phenomenon should develop where an ilr is present .",
    "given that , forced by the ilr , the connecting arm would be inclined with respect to the orientation of the bar s major axis , then streamlines of gas at different galactocentric radii would enter the shock front at different angles . as a result , gas along the connecting arm in the outer bar regions would have a net inward motion toward the galactic center with velocities of some tens of kms@xmath10 ; at some galactocentric radii inwards , the gas motion along the shocked layer would invert direction , showing an instantaneous velocity component outward from the galactic center with velocities of the order of 100  kms@xmath10 . the overall effect of the shock - focusing phenomenon would be to channel gas at some galactocentric radii and enhanced star formation activity would be expected in the region of converging flows . according to @xcite , a detection of an outward motion along the connecting arm would be an independent confirmation for the presence of an ilr in the bar region .",
    "our data show a combination of offset shock and inward motion that would confine the shock - focusing phenomenon ( if present ) to galactocentric radii within about 1.6  kpc from the galactic center .",
    "a second topic concerns the nature of the near and far 3  kpc arms ( e.g. , see the review in section  3.2 of @xcite ) .",
    "we follow the interpretation of the 3  kpc arms as a continuous physical structure as opposed to , for instance , a combination of two , separate , lateral arms .",
    "this assumption is based on a better match of the former interpretation to the @xmath3-@xmath4 locus of the 3  kpc arm features ( cf .",
    "figure  7 , 10 , and  11 in @xcite ) . in this context",
    ", two main ideas have been forwarded : 1 ) that of a circular ring with an expanding motion away from the galactic center ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and 2 ) that of an elliptical streamline of gas around the bar region ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "an important difference between the two models is related to the position of the 3  kpc arm with respect to the radius of the corotation resonance ( @xmath79 , associated with the rotation pattern of the bars ) : elliptical orbits are expected inside @xmath79 , whereas nearly circular orbits should occur outside ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the galactocentric radius of the near 3  kpc arm at the position of g010.62@xmath3100.38 ( r@xmath67  kpc ) is almost two times greater than the galactocentric radius of the far 3  kpc arm , as inferred from the position of g012.02@xmath3100.03 ( r@xmath66  kpc ) .",
    "this does not match the expected constant radius for a circular ring and seems to favor a highly eccentric orbit .",
