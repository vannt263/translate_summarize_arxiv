    "however , a test of this prediction by computer simulations turned out to be rather difficult : for the model ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) the use of an external force creates additional nonlinear excitations ; e.g. , an in - plane magnetic field creates a double domain wall which connects the vortex with a boundary @xcite .",
    "therefore 2-vortex simulations were performed where each vortex is driven by the force between them @xcite .",
    "large square systems with free boundaries were used and the trajectories were chosen such that the vortices stayed far away from each other and from the boundaries .",
    "a 2-vortex theory was developed @xcite which explains one very important qualitative feature of the simulations : there are four main scenarios in vortex dynamics , however cycloidal oscillations around a mean trajectory @xmath44 can be observed only for two of them , namely where either a vortex and an antivortex ( i.e.  @xmath45 ) rotate around each other , or where two vortices with equal vorticity perform a parallel translation with constant average speed .",
    "there are no oscillations for the other 2 scenarios of ` vortex - vortex rotation ' and ` vortex - antivortex translation ' .    however , the frequency @xmath46 of the observed cycloidal oscillations yielded a mass @xmath47 which was much larger than predicted by eq .",
    "( [ eq : goueva ] ) , see table ib of ref .",
    "later a second severe discrepancy was discovered after having improved the simulations for the 2-vortex rotation @xcite : better initial conditions were used and instead of a square a circular system was used , with symmetric initial positions . here for each vortex the mean trajectory @xmath48 is a circle ; the spectrum of the oscillations can be measured much more accurately and shows very clearly two frequencies @xmath49 with about the same strength , instead of the one frequency @xmath41 predicted by eq .",
    "( [ eq : wysin ] ) .    because of the above two discrepancies between theory and simulations we now derive a new theory which amounts to a hierarchy of equations of motion for a nonlinear coherent excitation in a system with an arbitrary hamiltonian ( section [ sec : eqm ] ) .",
    "the derivation is completely general , but for simplicity we consider a hamiltonian which is a functional of only one field and its canonical momentum ; this is the case of our model ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) in the continuum limit .",
    "the level @xmath50 in this hierarchy is defined as the order @xmath50 of the highest time derivative which appears in the equation of motion .",
    "a classification of the excitations determines on which levels the hierarchy can be truncated consistently : the dynamics of gyrotropic excitations is described by odd - order equations , the simplest example is the non - planar vortex of model ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) .",
    "non - gyrotropic excitations ( e.g. kinks in 1-d models , planar vortices in model ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) ) are governed by even - order equations of motion .    in order to obtain the above classification one must know at least the order of magnitude of the parameters in the equations of motion .",
    "for the calculation of the parameters it is necessary to solve the hamilton equations for a system with one excitation , choosing appropriate boundary conditions .",
    "we do this for our model ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) in section [ sec : eqm2 ] using a finite system with free boundaries .",
    "after the calculation of the parameters the equation of motion can be solved . for the non - planar vortices we solve a @xmath3-order equation , which in fact yields the observed frequencies @xmath51 ( the trivial solution @xmath52 yields the mean trajectory @xmath48 ) , section [ sec : mass ] .",
    "we compare with new simulations where a _",
    "vortex on a circle is driven by its image vortex ( section [ sec : comp ] ) .",
    "we only note that the 2-vortex simulations yield a similar spectrum but can not be compared quantitatively with this 1-vortex theory .",
    "we also show that the @xmath4-order equation , which appears on the next consistent level of the hierarchy , predicts two additional frequencies which can also be observed , but they are very weak .",
    "therefore all levels higher than three can safely be neglected in this case .    in section [",
    "sec : disc ] we discuss our results and in the appendix we describe the numerical part of this work in more detail .",
    "we consider an arbitrary classical hamiltonian which is a functional of a field @xmath53 and its canonical momentum @xmath54 .",
    "we introduce a collective variable @xmath5 for the position of a nonlinear coherent excitation .",

    "the equation of motion ( [ eq212 ] ) has a steady - state solution : a constant rotation on a circle @xmath210 with the following relation between @xmath211 and @xmath212 : @xmath213 this circle is identified with the mean trajectory around which we observe oscillations in the simulations ( details are given in the appendix ) . in fig .",

    "we observe that the vortex center moves on small - amplitude cycloidal trajectories , which are either completely inside a lattice cell or which go over severall cells .",
    "however , the spectrum is always practically the same which means that the pinning forces do not substantially influence the frequencies . in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] we clearly see not only a second doublet but also a third one , which we want to relate to the @xmath4 and @xmath253 levels of the hierarchy , resp . in order to show this relation we must check that the parameters @xmath183 and @xmath182 do not change dramatically when we go from the @xmath3 to the @xmath4 level , for instance . on this level",
    "we get a @xmath194-order eigenvalue equation for @xmath236 , after splitting off the trivial solution . we need not solve this equation because we want to calculate @xmath183 , @xmath182 , @xmath254 as functions of the @xmath236 s .",
    "this is achieved by using vieta s rules which express the coefficients of an @xmath255-order polynominal equation by its roots .",
    "table [ table3 ] contains the observed @xmath236 s and the resulting values for @xmath183 and @xmath182 , which in fact do not differ much on the different levels of the hierarchy .",
    "we remark that this test is very sensitive : small changes in @xmath236 result in large changes in the values of @xmath183 and @xmath182 .",
    "finally we would like to stress that the additional @xmath236 s can usually not be observed in the spectra because their amplitudes are too weak , thus our @xmath3-order equation of motion is normally sufficient to describe the simulations .",
    "inserting the usual travelling - wave ansatz into the hamilton equations shows that the shape of a nonlinear coherent excitation generally depends also on its velocity @xmath256 . iterating this process we have shown that there is an additional dependence on @xmath128 , @xmath257 , and so on .",
    "this yields a hierarchy of equations of motion for @xmath258 . for the case of the non - planar vortices of the 2-d anisotropic heisenberg model",
    "the odd levels of this hierarchy represent an increasingly better description of the dynamics as observed in computer simulations of the full spin system .",
    "naturally the question arises why spin waves do not appear here , neither in theory nor in simulations . as to the latter point , we make two remarks : 1 . ) for a short time after the start of a simulation spin waves are radiated because the initial condition usually does not perfectly represent a moving vortex .",
    "in fact , if we use approximate formulas for the vortex structure , the generated spin waves are clearly observed . in our older simulations",
    "@xcite we eliminated them by adding a gilbert damping term to the landau - lifshitz eq .  for the above short time period .",
    "however , in the present paper we use an iterative method ( see appendix ) which produces a stationary vortex solution which is so good that practically no spin waves are generated .",
    "2 . ) one might think that a vortex would continously radiate spin waves because it is subject to accelerations on its complicated cycloidal trajectory .",
    "even if the amplitudes of these spin waves were too small to observe them directly , the effect should be detected indirectly by an energy loss of the vortex .",
    "interestingly , in our simulations , even after a long time ( several periods @xmath259 , see ( [ eq552 ] ) ) there was no detectable energy loss ; this suggests the possibility of additional conservation laws .    as to the theory , there is an alternative formalism @xcite which includes spin waves . instead of eqs .",
    "( [ eq28 ] ) , ( [ eq29 ] ) the following ansatz is used    [ eq : phi_m ] @xmath260    where the functions @xmath61 and @xmath60 on the r.h.s .",
    "represent the static structure of a vortex , while @xmath261 and @xmath262 represent spin waves . as the number of degrees of freedom on the r.h.s .  of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : phi_m ] ) is larger than on the l.h.s .",
    ", constraints must be introduced which have the form of orthogonality relations @xcite .",
    "one of the constraints leads to an implicite definition of the vortex position @xmath263 .",
    "this definition is global in the sense that all spins in the system are involved , in contrast to the local definition of the vortex center @xmath141 that has been used in the present paper ( see appendix ) .",
    "consequently different trajectories @xmath264 and @xmath258 are obtained by analyzing the same simulation data .",
    "@xmath265 turns out to be equivalent to the mean trajectory @xmath266 belonging to the cycloidal trajectories @xmath258 obtained in the present paper .    in the alternative formalism",
    "the cycloidal trajectories are obtained by a coupling of @xmath264 to certain quasi - local spin wave modes . far away from the vortex center these modes are extended while they are localized in the core region @xcite .",
    "quasi - local eigenmodes are in contrast to the truly localized , intrinsic modes of e.g.  the kinks in the @xmath267-model @xcite .",
    "an exact numerical diagonalization for a small system ( @xmath268 ) with one vortex shows that essentially only two modes are involved .",
    "their frequencies are identical to those of the doublet which we observe in the spectrum of the cycloidal trajectories ( e.g. , table [ table1 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) . if higher - order doublets can be seen in the spectrum ( like in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) , they can also be identified with spin waves . hence , going e.g.  from the @xmath3 to the @xmath4 level of the hierarchy in the present paper corresponds to taking into account two additional spin wave modes in the alternative formalism .",
    "this strong model selection may also be responsible for inhibiting spin wave emission by the vortex motion as noted above .",

    "travel between los alamos and bayreuth was partially supported by nato collaborative research grant no.0013/89 .",
    "in this appendix we describe the numerical details of our work .",
    "the time evolution of classical spin systems is governed by the landau - lifshitz equation @xmath269 the index @xmath270 denotes the site - coordinates of a 2-d square lattice .",
    "the local field @xmath271 is for our model ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) given by @xmath272\\ ] ] where here the sum runs over all the nearest neighbors of @xmath270 not including @xmath270 itself .",
    "equation ( [ lle ] ) with ( [ h_eff ] ) was numerically integrated using a forth - order runge - kutta scheme with a time step of 0.04 ( in time units @xmath273 ) .",
    "either free boundary conditions on a circular system , i.e.  @xmath274 for all @xmath275 with @xmath276 , or anti - periodic boundary conditions on a square system were used . with @xmath277 the latter",
    "are defined in the following way : @xmath278 @xmath36 denotes the number of lattice sites in @xmath279- and @xmath280-direction , respectively ( i.e.  the linear dimension of the system ) .",
    "@xmath281 is the total amount of vorticity in the system ( @xmath282 or @xmath283 for one vortex in the system ) and @xmath100 is an arbitrary constant .",
    "the exact structure of an one - vortex solution is , even in the static case , analytically not known .",
    "therefore we calculated the initial conditions for our simulations numerically using the following iteration scheme : @xmath284 normally this method is used to calculate static solutions of the landau - lifshitz equation .",
    "however , iterating only a few times ( a typical value is 30 ) a pronounced vortex structure develops which is suitable to serve as the initial spin field for the simulations .",
