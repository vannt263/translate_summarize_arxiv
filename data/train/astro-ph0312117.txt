    "identifying and studying dusty star - forming galaxies is of vital importance to understand galaxy evolution . besides looking directly for the emission from dust",
    ", these objects can also be identified by their extreme optical to near - infrared ( nir ) colours , forming a significant fraction of the so - called extremely red objects ( eros ) @xcite .",
    "radio wavelengths , unaffected by dust obscuration and being a measure of star formation rates in star - forming galaxies , can give an important insight to the characteristics of these dusty objects @xcite .",
    "performing an ero search in an ultra - deep radio field can thus provide an important step in understanding some of the more obscured galaxies .",
    "the phoenix deep survey is a multiwavelength survey based on deep radio ( 1.4ghz ) observations performed with the atca . with an area of over 4.5 square degree , and reaching flux densities of 60 @xmath1jy ,",
    "the pds is one of the deepest wide angle radio surveys already made @xcite .",
    "follow - up optical ( @xmath2 ) data has recently been obtained , using the wide - field imagers at the aat , ctio and eso , reaching @xmath3mag in each band . near - infrared ( @xmath4 band ) observations were made on the central 200 square arcmin of the pds , using sofi at the ntt ( eso ) to a limiting magnitude of @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "based on 3@xmath6 aperture photometry , a sample of 432 eros ( @xmath7 ) , were selected .",
    "eighteen were directly identified in the radio catalogue , with radio fluxes between 65 and 991@xmath1jy .",
    "the ero population was separated into ellipticals and star - forming galaxies using the @xmath8 magnitudes , following the recent work by bergstrom et al .",
    ". this method seems to perform well for eros with redshifts @xmath9 @xcite , which seems appropriate for this survey ( a spectroscopic analysis of an ero sample with similar @xmath4 magnitude limits revealed a median redshift of @xmath10 , with a very small number of eros having @xmath11 @xcite ) .",
    "a total of 214 objects fall in the star - forming region of the @xmath8 colour - colour plot ( figure  [ plots ] ) . after removing all ( @xmath12 ) radio detections ,",
    "the radio images at the locations of the star - forming eros were stacked .",
    "a significant ( @xmath13 ) detection of 8.7@xmath1jy was revealed ( figure  [ plots ] ) .",
    "assuming a median redshift for the sample of @xmath10 , and assuming the radio emission is solely due to star - formation , this implies an average star - formation rate of @xmath0 .",
    "improvement on the photometric analysis , by using the full photometric dataset to estimate photometric redshifts and classifications , is currently underway , and will result in a precise determination of the contribution of star - forming eros to the star - formation rate in the universe .",
