    "<S> crystallographic defects play a key role in determining the properties of crystalline materials . </S>",
    "<S> the new class of two - dimensional materials , foremost graphene , have enabled atomically resolved studies of defects , such as vacancies  @xcite , grain boundaries  @xcite , dislocations  @xcite , and foreign atom substitutions  @xcite . however , atomic resolution imaging of implanted self - interstitials has so far not been reported in any three- but also not in any two - dimensional material . here </S>",
    "<S> , we deposit extra carbon into single - layer graphene at soft landing energies of @xmath01  ev using a standard carbon coater . </S>",
    "<S> we identify all the self - interstitial dimer structures theoretically predicted earlier  @xcite , employing 80  kv aberration - corrected high - resolution transmission electron microscopy . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate accumulation of the interstitials into larger aggregates and dislocation dipoles , which we predict to have strong local curvature by atomistic modeling , and to be energetically favourable configurations as compared to isolated interstitial dimers . </S>",
    "<S> our results contribute to the basic knowledge on crystallographic defects , and lay out a pathway into engineering the properties of graphene by pushing the crystal into a state of metastable supersaturation .    </S>",
    "<S> there is no such thing in nature as a perfect crystal , although many materials that are useful in engineering are crystalline to a good approximation , with the exception of few volume defects and surfaces interrupting the perfect periodicity . the defects , however , play a key role in determining the properties of materials . </S>",
    "<S> therefore an important branch in materials science is dedicated to studying , understanding and controlling defects in the crystal volume in order to understand and tailor the properties of materials . </S>",
    "<S> for example , control over the electronic structure of semiconductors is achieved through introduction of zero - dimensional defects ( impurity atoms ) into the crystals , the mechanical properties of metals and alloys are to a large extent controlled by their one - dimensional ( dislocations ) and two - dimensional ( grain boundaries ) defects , and the properties of the two - dimensional surfaces of materials are altered by surface reconstructions and can be manipulated by bonding of foreign atom species on the surface .    the introduction of graphene and other two - dimensional ( 2d ) crystals into the zoo of known materials has opened up a completely new perspective into studies of crystallographic defects . </S>",
    "<S> this is , most of all , due to the simple fact that in 2d materials the three - dimensional bulk of a crystal does not obscure the view of the defects , as surface is essentially all that the materials have . with modern microscopy methods , such as aberration - corrected high - resolution transmission electron microscopy ( ac - hrtem ) , aberration - corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy and scanning tunneling microscopy </S>",
    "<S> , the exact atomic structure of the 2d materials can be resolved  @xcite , and crystallographic defects , and their dynamics can be studied at the level of the basic building blocks of matter  @xcite .    a large body of work has been dedicated to studying point defects and extended defects in graphene . </S>",
    "<S> vacancies , introduced for example by ion  @xcite or electron irradiation  @xcite have been observed , along with their transformations  @xcite , migration , and coalescence  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> foreign atoms at substitutional sites or adsorbed to the graphene lattice have been detected and identified  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the structure and movement of grain boundaries have been observed  @xcite , and studies of dislocations in graphene have allowed resolving their exact atomic structure  @xcite and provided the first real - time atomic - scale observations of the full life - cycle of a dislocation  a long standing topic in materials science  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the bonding sites of single carbon adatoms  @xcite , and stable configurations of fully sp@xmath1-coordinated interstitial dimers incorporated in the graphene lattice  @xcite ( see  [ fig1 ] for the atomic structures ) have been theoretically predicted . experimental evidence of single carbon adatoms in the so - called bridge position ( with the extra atom sitting on top of a c - c bond of graphene ) has been presented  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> structures analogous to the interstitial dimers in graphene have been observed in incompletely crystallized hexagonal 2d silicon oxide monolayers using both scanning tunneling microscopy  @xcite and ac - hrtem  @xcite . according to calculations , </S>",
    "<S> the extra atom structures are expected to modify the electronic and magnetic properties of graphene  @xcite , and increase the chemical reactivity locally  @xcite , which becomes important when functionalizing graphene . </S>",
    "<S> the interstitial dimer structures have been observed in earlier studies  @xcite after exposing single - layer graphene to extreme electron doses in a tem , but importantly , these structures did not result from introduction of extra atoms in the crystal , but rather from removal of a large number of atoms around the defects and significant reordering of the whole graphene lattice . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , with the electron irradiation approach , the interstitial defects are randomly appearing among a wide variety of other types of defects , and one has essentially no control over which defects are introduced into the graphene lattice . </S>",
    "<S> importantly , observation of isolated self - interstitial dimers in non - treated graphene samples has not been reported , despite extensive atomic scale studies of both mechanically exfoliated and chemical vapour deposition ( cvd ) grown graphene .        in terms of deviations from the equilibrium density of the graphene crystal , deficit type defects , such as single vacancies and vacancy agglomerates , can be introduced by removing atoms from the lattice . in a tem </S>",
    "<S> this can be accomplished by simply exposing graphene to the electron beam of the microscope , as a single knock - on collision event between an electron and a carbon atom in graphene is adequate for removing the atom at voltages of 80  kv and above , leaving a vacancy behind  @xcite . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> an external source of new carbon atoms needs to be available in order to produce density surplus type of defects . as the tem is an ubiquitous tool for characterizing defects in graphene and other 2d - materials , it is understandable that observations of deficit type defects are abundant , where as reports on density surpluses are scarce . </S>",
    "<S> what further complicates studies of surplus atoms by tem , is the fact that the extra atoms themselves can be knocked out by the electron beam . as the displacement threshold energy of atoms at defect sites tends to be lower than in pristine graphene  @xcite , special care needs to be taken in order to minimize the electron dose on the samples .    in general </S>",
    "<S> , it is energetically expensive to introduce a positive density deviation into any crystal due to the large required strain . </S>",
    "<S> however , graphene behaves in a special way in the presence of extra atoms , as the graphene plane can deform in the third out - of - plane direction , and due to the small bending modulus of graphene  @xcite , the energy cost of adding extra atoms in graphene is relatively low . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , especially in the cases of the reconstructed interstitial dimers ( see [ fig1 ] b and c for the atomic structures ) , the two extra atoms are incorporated in the lattice in such a way that it is impossible to pinpoint which exact atoms are the surplus ones . </S>",
    "<S> an intriguing alternative interpretation of the reconstructed interstitial dimer structures is to view them as miniscule grain boundary loops with an associated density surplus  @xcite , since a chain of pentagons and heptagons are enclosing one or two carbon hexagons in the defects . </S>",
    "<S> the line between adatoms and interstitials becomes fuzzy in the case of 2d materials such as graphene , and it is debatable into which category each extra atom structure belongs to . </S>",
    "<S> here , we elect to term single atoms residing on top of the graphene lattice as adatoms , and atoms incorporated into the lattice through perfect sp@xmath1-bonding as self - interstitials .    in this letter , we report on implantation of extra carbon into single - layer graphene at soft landing energies in the range of 1  ev . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting structures and their electron irradiation induced dynamics are characterized by ac - hrtem operated at 80  kv . </S>",
    "<S> all the three theoretically predicted self - interstitial dimer structures  @xcite are observed in the samples . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , larger aggregates of sp@xmath1-bonded extra atoms , as well as dislocation dipoles with the associated local density surplus are observed . with the help of atomistic simulations </S>",
    "<S> we show that such defect sites have high local curvature , leading to blister - like structures . after extended electron irradiation , </S>",
    "<S> the extra atoms are removed from the crystal , leaving behind a pristine graphene lattice . </S>",
    "<S> altogether , our results present the first atom - by - atom resolved study of a crystal forced into a state of supersaturation , that is , containing self - interstitials . further on , our results lay out a pathway into engineering the properties of graphene by implantation of self - interstitials into the lattice .    the method for implanting carbon into graphene was straightforward : first , mechanically exfoliated and commerically obtained cvd graphene was transferred onto quantifoil tem grids . </S>",
    "<S> the samples were then treated in a carbon coating apparatus normally used for depositing a conductive amorphous carbon film on top of non - conducting specimens for electron microscopy . in this apparatus , </S>",
    "<S> the sample and a graphitic filament are placed in a vacuum chamber , and a current is run through the filament in order to bring it to its sublimation temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the system was run with parametrization close to minimum achievable deposition thickness ( one to four 100 - 300  ms pulses ) . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to indivudual c atoms , also molecules such as c@xmath2 and c@xmath3 are produced when sublimating graphite  @xcite , and all these land on the sample surface ( and other surfaces in the chamber ) at thermal kinetic energies , typically less than 1  ev / atom .    </S>",
    "<S> we conducted analytical potential molecular dynamics simulations for predicting the sticking probability of landing c atoms and c@xmath2 dimers at different kinetic energies , and based on these results we expect a large fraction of the incoming atoms / molecules to form bonds with graphene , when the kinetic energy is less than 30  ev / atom ( see supplementary figure 1 for sticking probabilities as a function of kinetick energy ) . </S>",
    "<S> earlier theoretical predictions on b and n implantation  @xcite also suggest the possibility of implanting atoms into graphene , and in a recent experiment b and n atoms were , in fact , implanted in free - standing graphene  @xcite at a landing energy of 20  ev . </S>",
    "<S> individual carbon adatoms are predicted to be mobile at room temperature  @xcite , and are thus not expected to be found after deposition , although , upon encountering another carbon adatom , a highly stable self - interstitial dimer can be formed  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the mobility of the larger molecules can be expected to be lower , but no theoretical predicions on such mobilities could be found , and conducting such simulations is beyond the scope of this study . spatial control over the landing site distribution can not be achieved using our approach , and more sophisticated methods are required if precise engineering of graphene by introduction of interstitials is desired .    </S>",
    "<S> the samples were characterized using ac - hrtem after the carbon deposition treatment . </S>",
    "<S> varying coverage of the free - standing graphene layer was observed depending on the deposition parametrization , proving that at least a fraction of the landing atoms / molecules are sticking to the sample surface . </S>",
    "<S> when the carbon coater was run at low deposition rates ( _ e.g. _ , one 200 ms pulse ) isolated dark spots were frequently observed . </S>",
    "<S> based on contrast analysis , the dark spots could be interpreted as individual carbon adatoms ( see supplementary figure 2 for details ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , their remarkable stability is inconsistent with theoretical predictions on the migration barriers  @xcite suggesting high mobilities at room temperature . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we conclude that the spots are likely other types of defects , such as adsorbed molecules like ch@xmath3  @xcite or even silicon in a substitutional position  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> when it comes to self - interstitial dimers , the situation is completely different in terms of identifiability of the defects . </S>",
    "<S> the interstitial dimers are predicted to be incorporated into the sp@xmath1-coordinated graphene lattice with no dangling bonds , resulting in high stability of the defects  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> distinct polygon patterns formed out of pentagons , hexagons , and heptagons can be used to unambiguously identify these point defects ( see [ fig1 ] as well as supplementary figure 3 for discussion on the effects of residual a2 astigmatism ) . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the so - called inverse stone - thrower - wales defect ( [ fig1 ] a )  @xcite , and both its other two polymorphs ( resulting from rotation of one and two c - c bonds )  @xcite were observed in the samples ( [ fig1 ] b and c ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the theoretical predictions of the structure of these defects in isolated form are experimentally verified , and the first atomic resolution images of implanted self - interstitials in any material at atomic resolution are presented .    </S>",
    "<S> the formation process of the self - interstitial dimers can not be captured in the microscope , as all the observed defects are in place when the first hrtem images are obtained . </S>",
    "<S> the electron beam of the microscope may , indeed , play a role in the formation of the final stable defects from possibly less ordered structures after implantation . </S>",
    "<S> the electrons provide energy to the system , and thus can allow the atoms to overcome activation barriers , similar to what has been observed , for example , in the case of electron beam stimulated bond - rotations  @xcite and grain - boundary migration  @xcite in graphene . </S>",
    "<S> inverse stone - thrower - wales defects have been predicted to form most readily next to divacancy defects in graphene  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , vacancies next to any of the self - interstitial structures were never observed in our experiment . as demonstrated below , in addition to possibly helping in formation of the observed defects </S>",
    "<S> , the impacts of the energetic electrons can also knock out the extra atoms into the vacuum of the microscope  @xcite , thus eliminating the defects .    </S>",
    "<S> the atomic models of the interstitial defects shown in [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] were relaxed using the conjugate gradient algorithm , with interatomic forces described by a valence force field model ( vff )  @xcite . in each case </S>",
    "<S> strong out - of - plane buckling was observed ( [ fig1 ] ) , extending over long distances , and in order to accommodate this strain field in the simulation cell , a system consisting of 20002 atoms was used in the simulations . </S>",
    "<S> the relaxed structures extend 1.9 - 2.1   out of the plane . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated formation energies of the defects in panels a , b , and c are 5.8  ev , 6.2  ev , and 7.1  ev , respectively . the third defect relaxed in two different modes , extending symmetrically or antisymmetrically out of the plane , with the antisymmetric mode resulting in only a slightly higher formation energy of 7.2  ev than the symmetric mode ( 7.1  ev ) . </S>",
    "<S> the formation energies of these defects have been calculated earlier using density functional theory ( dft )  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the values disagree by tenths of evs , which can be explained by the higher level of approximation in our method , as well as the unavoidable limited system sizes in the dft calculations . in this work </S>",
    "<S> we opt to use the vff model as it allows us to model the long ranging corrugations connected to the defects .    </S>",
    "<S> the interstitial dimers were observed to undergo transformations under the electron beam . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] b and c show the same interstitial dimer before and after a bond - rotation event . </S>",
    "<S> such transformations back and forth between these two configurations were frequently observed , but curiously transformation to and from the inverse stone - thrower - wales configuration ( [ fig1 ] a ) was never observed , even though the predicted formation energy of this configuration is lower than the others. further on , the lowest energy configuration was observed most seldom of the three . </S>",
    "<S> this , however , might be the result of a selection bias , as it is less visible in the micrographs as compared to the others . </S>",
    "<S> all of the interstitial dimers eventually disappeared due to knocking out of the extra atoms by the electron beam after doses in the order of 10@xmath4 electrons / nm@xmath1 .        </S>",
    "<S> larger aggregates of interstitials in the lattice were observed as well ( see [ fig2 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the two cases presented in panels a and b of [ fig2 ] show structures with four and ten extra atoms , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the relaxed atomic models of the defects display again strong out of plane buckling . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated formation energies of the four extra atom and ten extra atom structures are 11.4  ev and 14.8  ev , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> normalizing to energy per interstitial dimer ( 5.7  ev and 3.0  ev ) , one can make a comparison to the formation energies of the isolated interstitial dimers , and conclude that it is energetically favourable for the interstitials to agglomerate . </S>",
    "<S> it should be pointed out , that these are not necessarily the optimal configurations for each number of interstitials , but rather cases which were experimentally observed .    in many cases contamination </S>",
    "<S> was seen to stick to the interstitial defects . </S>",
    "<S> the contamination was removed by the electron beam after prolonged exposure , revealing the sp@xmath1-coordinated defect structures . </S>",
    "<S> the sticking of contamination indicates a higher affinity of molecules adsorbed on top of graphene to the interstitials , which in turn is promising in terms of functionalization of graphene , _ </S>",

    "<S> the scale bar is 1  nm . ]    similar to the earlier reported case of vacancy aggregates  @xcite , there is a possibility for the graphene lattice to reorganize into a dislocation dipole in the presence of extra atoms . </S>",
    "<S> in such a situation , the extra atoms occupy an extra row in between the dislocation cores . </S>",
    "<S> such rearrangements were observed in our experiment as presented in [ fig3 ] . </S>",
    "<S> first , a rather disordered aggregate of extra atoms was observed ( panel a ) . here , the structural model should be considered as an approximate interpretation of the defect , as the structure was constantly changing during imaging . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , the dark high - contrast spots in the frame ( and some of the subsequent frames ) suggest the presence of , _ e.g. _ , sp@xmath6-coordinated c atoms , which make the exact interpretation based on the projected tem - image difficult . nevertheless , even if such atoms are neglected in the model , a density surplus is identified .    under continuous electron irradiation , </S>",
    "<S> the atoms rearrange into a dislocation dipole , as can be seen in [ fig3 ] d. the distance of the dislocation cores is five lattice rows , corresponding to ten extra carbon atoms in the lattice . </S>",
    "<S> the lower dislocation core deviates from the simple pentagon hexagon structure due to a single rotated bond . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated formation energy of this structure is 10.82  ev , or 2.16  ev per interstitial dimer . in the subsequent frames g , h , </S>",
    "<S> and i the defect is observed to further transform , with gradual removal of surplus atoms , and shrink into an interstitial dimer in the second to last configuration ( panel h ) </S>",
    "<S> . eventually the defect disappears , leaving pristine graphene behind .        </S>",
    "<S> a limit in the density of interstitials in the graphene layer that can be introduced is reached if the deposition thickness is increased to approximately one monolayer . instead of atoms incorporated in the graphene lattice , </S>",
    "<S> the extra carbon is segregated into a new layer . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , high - magnification images of the second layer showed the formation of a nanocrystalline graphene layer on top of graphene ( [ fig4 ] a ) . when the image contribution of the first graphene layer is removed by fourier filtering  @xcite the few nanometer sized graphene grains become visible , separated by continuous chains of pentagonal and hexagonal carbon rings ( [ fig4 ] b ) . </S>",
    "<S> the new layer was rather non - uniform , but the uniformity was observed to improve during imaging , facilitated by the impacts of the electrons allowing the system to overcome configuration barriers , analogous to high temperature annealing  @xcite .    to conclude , we have introduced a surplus density of carbon into suspended graphene by means of low - energy implantation of carbon atoms resulting ultimately in self - interstitial dimers incorporated in the graphene crystal . </S>",
    "<S> the implantation was conducted using an evaporating carbon coating apparatus , which works by bringing a graphitic filament to its sublimating temperature , and thus emitting individual c atoms , c@xmath2 , c@xmath3 and larger molecules which then land on the sample surface at thermal kinetic energies . by careful tuning of the deposition parameters , a low enough density of extra carbon </S>",
    "<S> was reached in order to produce isolated point defects . however , </S>",
    "<S> when the deposition thickness was increased to approximately one carbon monolayer , instead of a high density of interstitials in the original graphene layer , a second nanocrystalline graphene layer was formed . </S>",
    "<S> the structure and electron irradiation induced dynamics of the produced defects was imaged at the atomic scale , employing 80  kv aberration - corrected high - resolution transmission electron microscopy . </S>",
    "<S> all the earlier theoretically predicted , completely sp@xmath1-coordinated structural configurations of isolated self - interstitial dimers in graphene were experimentally verified . additionally , </S>",
    "<S> larger aggregates of interstitials and edge dislocation dipoles incorporated in the graphene lattice were observed , and based on atomistic modeling , such structures were determined to be energetically favourable arrangements for the extra atoms . </S>",
    "<S> all of the interstitial structures were predicted to strongly buckle out - of - plane . </S>",
    "<S> such blister - like structures can be expected to have higher reactivity than pristine graphene , which can be advantageous for functionalization of graphene . </S>",
    "<S> further on , defect structures containing surplus carbon atoms have been predicted to have exciting electronic and magnetic properties  @xcite , and our experiments demonstrate that such structures can , in fact , be fabricated . </S>"
