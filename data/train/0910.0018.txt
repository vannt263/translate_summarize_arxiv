    "it has long been known that neutron stars have much greater space velocities than their likely progenitors @xcite and it is now widely accepted that that this is because they acquire large velocity kicks in the supernova explosions in which they form @xcite . the reasons for these kicks is still a matter for debate with the leading candidates being asymmetric neutrino emission and/or asymmetric mass release during the supernova explosion and core collapse @xcite .",
    "we address here the question of the extent to which similar kicks may be present when black holes form . because the material forming the black holes passes through the event horizon it is quite possible that few neutrinos can escape @xcite so that the black hole could form with little or no natal kick . on the other hand , asymmetric collapse to form a black hole",
    "might lead to copious emission of gravitational waves @xcite .",
    "in addition , @xcite note that in a binary system a black hole can form by accretion of matter on to a neutron star . in that case",
    "the kick given to the original neutron star would appear as a kick given to the current black hole .",
    "evidence that black holes are indeed kicked comes from the work of @xcite .",
    "they looked at the out - of - plane distributions of low mass x - ray binaries and neutron stars .",
    "they found no significant difference between the two , leading to the conclusion that black holes are subject to similar kicks at their formation .    in this paper",
    "we accept the evidence that stellar black holes do indeed acquire a velocity kick when they form , but we inquire further into the nature of the kick .",
    "in particular we ask whether the mechanism which gives rise to the kick might also give rise to a misalignment of the black hole spin axis with the original spin axis of the star from which it formed . the black hole progenitor star most likely had its spin aligned with the binary orbit before the supernova .",
    "a simple spherical collapse would preserve the spin axis , but a more complicated collapse might not .",
    "we consider here the simple null hypothesis that the spin axis remains unaltered by the kick process and test the extent to which this might be contradicted by the evidence .",
    "we focus on the microquasar gro j1655 - 40 .",
    "as we discuss in section  [ gro ] , there is considerable information for this system , about the size of the natal velocity kick and also on the misalignment between the current black hole spin and the binary orbital axis . in section  [ model ]",
    "we outline the dynamics of natal kicks and their implications for spin / orbital misalignment and in section  [ apply ] apply these results to gro j1655 - 40 .",
    "we discuss our results in section  [ conclude ] .",
    "microquasars are black - hole x - ray binaries with relativistic radio jets @xcite . gro 1655 - 40 is a binary system consisting of a black hole of mass @xmath1 and a lobefilling companion star with mass @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the binary system has a large systemic radial velocity with respect to the sun of @xmath3 @xcite and this together with the observed proper motion led @xcite to deduce that the system has a current space velocity of @xmath4 .",
    "this space velocity can be the result of a combination of two physical causes , instantaneous mass loss during the supernova explosion and an additional kick owing to asymmetry in the explosion itself .",
    "the first depends on the mass lost during the explosion as well as on the pre - supernova orbital velocity .",
    "that is , it depends on the nature of the binary just prior to the explosion .",
    "further , if the amount of mass lost is too large , then an additional , carefully directed kick may be required to keep the system bound .",
    "given the current position and space velocity of the orbit , computation of the likely post - explosion orbit coupled with analysis of the likely nature of the pre - explosion system have led @xcite to conclude that immediately after the formation of the black hole the system had a space velocity in the range @xmath5 .",
    "we make use of this constraint in section  [ apply ] .",
    "they conclude that although a symmetric supernova event ( no intrinsic black hole kick ) can not be ruled out , the constraints can be satisfied more comfortably if the black hole did indeed have an intrinsic natal kick of a few tens of @xmath0 .",
    "they set an upper limit to the intrinsic kick of @xmath6 .    in this paper we consider the additional constraint that the axis of the spin of the black hole , ( measured by the direction of the relativistic jets ) , is misaligned with the orbital angular velocity , along with the null hypothesis that any intrinsic kick imparted to the black hole does not change its direction of spin .",
    "this hypothesis implies that the kick imparts linear but not angular momentum to the black hole .",
    "the angle the jets make to the line of sight was measured by @xcite to be @xmath7 .",
    "the inclination of the binary rotation axis to the line of sight is @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "so we take the angle @xmath9 between the black hole spin axis and the binary orbital axis to lie in the range @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "@xcite also show that if the black hole is spinning , interaction between the hole and the accretion disc tends to reduce @xmath9 .",
    "the only rigorous constraint that we can put on the misalignment angle @xmath9 immediately post - supernova is that @xmath11 though it could be much greater than this .",
    "the result of the mass loss coupled with any intrinsic kick would have left the the binary system in an eccentric orbit @xcite but of course the orbit of gro j1655 - 40 is now circular . to achieve this",
    "it is necessary that the post - explosion orbit be such that it could be circularised by tides . using the formulae given by @xcite we can estimate the circularisation timescale of the system in its current state to be about @xmath12yr",
    "this is sufficiently shorter than the evolution time , of at least @xmath13yr since mass transfer began @xcite and so the circular orbit now is not an unreasonable expectation .",
    "in the absence of any other information on the kick it still makes sense to see what a kick distribution like that used for neutron stars might imply about inclinations in microquasars .",
    "we assume that prior to the supernova the binary is in a circular orbit with two stars of masses @xmath14 and @xmath15 with _ relative _ orbital velocity @xmath16 .",
    "we then suppose that star 2 then has an asymmetric supernova explosion in which it loses mass @xmath17 and which gives it an intrinsic kick with velocity magnitude @xmath18 .",
    "the direction of the kick is parameterised by the angle out of the binary plane , @xmath19 , and the angle between the direction to the instantaneous velocity of the star and the projection of the velocity kick on to the binary orbital plane of @xmath20 ( see fig .  1 of @xcite for a diagram showing these angles ) .",
    "we denote the angle between the angular momentum axes of the old and new orbits as @xmath9 and , according to our null hypothesis , assume that this is the misalignment angle between the spin of the newly formed black hole and the new binary orbital axis .",
    "that is we assume that no angular momentum kick is imparted to the remnant .",
    "this means that on average material ejected in the explosion simply carries away its specific angular momentum @xcite .",
    "@xcite find the angles to be related by @xmath21 for a given misalignment angle , @xmath9 , we must have @xmath22 real and so the velocity kick must lie between the locus of @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) , which corresponds to a velocity @xmath25 and the locus of @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) , which corresponds to a velocity @xmath28 we consider this further in section  [ apply ] once we have examined the other constraints on the kick .      the system must remain bound after the supernova .",
    "this implies that the velocity kick must be less than @xmath29 @xcite . here",
    "the fraction of mass lost in the supernova from the system @xmath30 is given by is @xmath31 where the total system mass is @xmath32 before the supernova and @xmath33 after it .",
    "we now calculate the system velocity that results from mass loss coupled with the intrinsic supernova kick .",
    "we work in the frame of the centre of mass of the system before the supernova and follow the analysis of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we use cartesian coordinates in the centre of mass frame before the supernova , such that the orbital plane is perpendicular to the @xmath34-axis and at the time of the explosion the stars lie on the @xmath35-axis .",
    "the velocities of the stars are then @xmath36 and @xmath37 here @xmath16 is the relative orbital velocity .",
    "we denote velocities of the stars after the explosion by @xmath38 and @xmath39 respectively . after the supernova the velocity of the companion ( star 1 ) is unchanged so that @xmath40 .",
    "the velocity of the star which experiences the supernova becomes @xmath41 the velocity of the centre of mass of the system is zero before the supernova explosion .",
    "afterwards it becomes @xmath42 the magnitude of this velocity is @xmath43 for a given set of masses @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath44 , the system velocity is a function only of @xmath45 because @xmath46 by equation  ( [ re2 ] ) .",
    "we are interested in the misalignment angle of the system , @xmath9 , after the supernova kick .",
    "this represents the angle between the old and new angular momenta of the orbit as shown in fig .  2 of @xcite .",
    "if @xmath47 then the system is closer to alignment than counter - alignment and if @xmath48 then the system is closer to counter - alignment .",
    "we assume that the intrinsic kick is independent of the geometry of the pre - supernova system .",
    "thus the kick direction is taken to be uniformly distributed over a sphere .",
    "we also assume that the velocity distribution of the kick is a maxwellian",
    ". then , @xcite find the misalignment angle probability distribution for a maxwellian kick distribution with velocity dispersion @xmath49 to be @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 is defined by equation  ( [ re2 ] ) .",
    "the region @xmath53 in their figure is the region in the @xmath54 plane for which a given misalignment angle @xmath9 can be produced .",
    "we integrate this using mathematica and monte - carlo methods .",
    "we consider this further below ( section  [ apply ] ) where we apply these particular ideas to the system gro j165540 .",
    "in order to calculate misalignment probabilities we need to know the properties of the system just before the supernova . in particular the masses before and",
    "after the supernova are not known but varying them does not significantly affect our conclusions .",
    "so in order to have something specific to work with we start with the state of gro  j165540 after the supernova as discussed by @xcite .",
    "we found two very similar models and we use the second which has @xmath55 and @xmath56 and the circular period just after the supernova is @xmath57 as an example .",
    "we then assume that the progenitor was a naked helium star of mass @xmath58 .",
    "this fits with the work of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we expect the system to be circular before the supernova and we need to know the relative orbital velocity just before the explosion , @xmath16 .",
    "the maximum pre - supernova circular velocity that can be achieved corresponds to the closest binary separation that can accommodate the main - sequence star without it filling its roche lobe",
    ". the companion naked helium star would be sufficiently compact to fit well inside its own lobe . for a lobe - filling main - sequence star of mass @xmath59 and companion of mass @xmath60 this maximum speed",
    "is @xmath61 . in practice , the probability of forming the current system becomes very low at high values of @xmath62 .",
    "we shall consider a range @xmath63 .      in figs .",
    "[ sysvel ] and  [ sysvel2 ] we show , for a given pre - explosion orbital velocity , the possible kick parameters in terms of @xmath64 and @xmath65 that can produce a particular misalignment angle @xmath9 . in fig .",
    "[ sysvel ] we consider systems with pre - supernova orbital velocity @xmath66 and post - supernova values of @xmath67 and @xmath68 . in fig .",
    "[ sysvel2 ] we consider a lower value of @xmath69 and values of @xmath67 and @xmath70 . in the @xmath54 plane",
    "we require that the values of @xmath65 and @xmath64 lie in the region between the @xmath71 ( equation  [ v1 ] , solid lines ) and @xmath72 ( equation  [ v2 ] , dashed lines ) contours . in this region",
    "we have real values of @xmath22 .",
    "this allowed region is further limited by two more factors .",
    "first the system must remain bound after the supernova . the maximum velocity kick for a system to remain bound ( equation  [ bd ] )",
    "is shown by the dotted line . above this line",
    "the system is unbound but below remains bound .",
    "secondly the velocity of the system after the supernova further limits the allowed region in the @xmath54 plane that can produce a given inclination @xmath9 .",
    "we plot the lines where @xmath73 and @xmath74 @xcite and require that the system must lie between these lines ( equation  [ vsys ] ) .    for the high value of the pre - supernova orbital velocity @xmath75 the allowed regions are very small .",
    "from the upper panels of fig .  [ sysvel ] we can see that the range of allowable values of @xmath64 and @xmath65 is highly restricted .",
    "in fact there are no possible combinations of @xmath65 and @xmath64 that can lead to a bound system with a misalignment of @xmath76 with the required system velocity .",
    "for @xmath77 the space is further reduced and we can not produce a system with @xmath78 ( see also section  [ range ] ) .",
    "a high value of @xmath62 implies that the pre - supernova system was tightly bound . without a kick , mass loss in",
    "the explosion results in a very unbound system with each star having its pre - supernova velocity vector unchanged .",
    "to keep such a system bound the kick must reduce the post - supernova relative velocity .",
    "such a kick must lie close to the orbital plane and so can not give rise to a large post - explosion misalignment angle @xmath9 .    for the lower value relative orbital velocity , that is for a wider pre - supernova system , @xmath79",
    ", we see from fig .",
    "[ sysvel2 ] that the permitted regions of parameter space are noticeably larger although still somewhat restricted . because the kick no longer has to be aimed quite so accurately to cancel out the post - explosion relative velocity it is possible to acquire larger post - explosion misalignment angles @xmath9 .",
    "= 8.4 cm = 8.4 cm = 8.4 cm = 8.4 cm    = 8.4 cm = 8.4 cm      we have shown in section  [ poss ] that the range of values of @xmath64 and @xmath65 needed to give rise to the required systems is rather restricted .",
    "and of course each individual supernova explosion has no means of aiming for any particular restricted set .",
    "thus , if we assume that the kick velocities acquired by the black hole have a certain distribution , and also that the directions of the kicks are randomly oriented in space , we can compute a probability distribution for the resulting misalignment angles @xmath9 .    as a distribution of intrinsic kick velocities we use the standard @xcite maxwellian distribution of supernova kicks .",
    "we consider two cases , kicks with a high velocity peak ( @xmath80 ) and a low velocity peak ( @xmath81 ) .",
    "for neutron stars there is some evidence that a combination of two such velocity distributions is required to fit the observational data @xcite .",
    "we integrate equation  ( [ int ] ) over the yellow regions illustrated in figs .",
    "[ sysvel ] and  [ sysvel2 ] for bound systems with a system velocity in the required range .",
    "we integrate the probability over this area using the monte - carlo integrator within mathematica . in fig .",
    "[ fig : gro ] we plot the probability distribution for two different values of the pre - supernova orbital velocity @xmath16 for these two values of @xmath49 .",
    "the high - velocity distribution of kicks ( left panel ) has a much lower probability of producing the observed system than the low - velocity distribution ( right panel ) .",
    "also , as we discussed above , lower values of @xmath16 are more able to give rise to larger values of @xmath9 .",
    "= 8.4 cm = 8.4 cm    in table  [ xray ] we list in column 2 the probability @xmath82 of getting a bound system with the post - supernova system velocity in the right range for different combinations of @xmath49 and @xmath62 . in the remaining columns we show the probabilities that , given the conditions for @xmath82 are satisfied , the misalignment angle is greater than a particular value . as is evident from fig .",
    "[ fig : gro ] , we see that the probability of getting a bound system is much smaller with the higher @xmath49 . however , if we produce a bound system , then we are more likely to get higher inclinations with the higher @xmath49 .",
    "we discuss this further in the section  [ conclude ] .    [ cols=\">,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we have considered what can be learned about the natal kick acquired by a black hole in a supernova by considering the system gro  165540 . in line with the analysis of @xcite we make use of kinematic data , but we add the additional constraint that the current black hole spin is not aligned with the orbital rotation .",
    "of course , if the supernova explosion and collapse process in which the black hole is formed gives not just a linear impulse , but also angular momentum , to the hole , then the current misalignment is just a measure of the added angular momentum .",
    "the task we set ourselves is to ask if it is possible , given the various constraints , to rule out the possibility that the natal kick ( if any ) added just linear , and not angular , momentum . to simplify the analysis we have fixed the masses of the stars before and after the supernova . to be fully consistent",
    "we could allow these masses to vary too and assign probabilities based on the likelihood of a given set of parameters .",
    "however one set of masses proved to be sufficient to not rule out the null hypothesis .",
    "our main results are summarised in table  [ xray ] .",
    "we have considered randomly oriented natal kicks with maxwellian velocity distributions of @xmath83 and @xmath84 for various separations of the pre - supernova binary , parametrised in terms of its relative orbital velocity @xmath16 .",
    "column  2 gives the probability @xmath82 that a bound system with the appropriate properties can be formed , ignoring any information about misalignment .",
    "it is immediately evident , that for low - velocity kicks the probability of forming the system is high , being typically around a few tens of percent ( compare * ? ? ?",
    "the probabilities are lower for higher - velocity kicks , being typically around a percent .",
    "that is only around one in a hundred such pre - supernova systems would end up looking like gro  165540 .",
    "this is still probably not unreasonable .",
    "the remaining columns in table  [ xray ] show the probabilities , given @xmath82 that the additional constraint of the misalignment angle @xmath9 can be satisfied , given our null hypothesis .",
    "it is evident that we are not able to rule out this null hypothesis , and so it is quite possible that the black hole formation process does not affect the angular as well as the linear momentum of the resulting black hole .",
    "it is worth noting , however , that even without the alignment information , it is easier to form the observed system with a low - velocity kick .",
    "moreover , if the formation process did just impart linear momentum , then , with account for the fact that the likely alignment timescale is comparable to the age of the system since the formation of the hole @xcite so that the initial misalignment angle @xmath9 would have been in the range @xmath85 , then it is evident that there is a strong preference for the pre - supernova system to have be fairly wide . note that @xmath86 corresponds to a binary separation of around @xmath87 before the supernova .",
    "it is interesting that such a wide system could have avoided the traditional common envelope required to shrink the orbit @xcite    we also note , that if the current misalignment angle were large ( say , @xmath88 ) then it would become increasingly difficult to satisfy the constraints for gro  165540 . in this respect we note that v4641 sgr is a microquasar similar in many respects to gro  165540 and it has a current misalignment angle of @xmath89 @xcite .",
    "if further observations were able to provide a constraint on its post - supernova systemic velocity , @xmath90 then it might be able to comment more securely on the null hypotheses .",
    "for example if it could be shown to have a large space @xmath90 then satisfying the null hypothesis might be problematic .",
