    "the rapid burster ( mxb1730335 ; hereafter rb ) is a well known and extensively studied low mass x ",
    "ray binary ( lmxrb ; see the recent review by lewin et al .",
    "1995 ) located in the globular cluster liller 1 at a distance of @xmath28  kpc ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is a recurrent transient with outbursts which last for few weeks followed by quiescent intervals which generally last for @xmath26 months .",
    "recently , a likely radio counterpart to the rb was observed by moore et al .",
    "( 2000 ) during several x  ray outbursts .",
    "the rb is unique among lmxrbs in that it displays two different kinds of x  ray bursts : type i bursts , which are typical of many lmxrbs with low - magnetic field neutron stars ( ns ) and type ii bursts .",
    "the former events are interpreted as due to nuclear burning of accreted material onto the surface of the ns ; type ii bursts , instead , probably result from spasmodic accretion onto the ns surface ( e.g. lewin et al . 1995 ) . until 1996 ,",
    "the rb was the only x  ray source from which type ii events were detected .",
    "now another transient x  ray source , gro j174428 , is known to show hard x  ray bursts , that likely have the same origin of the rb type ii bursts ( @xcite ) .",
    "the ns nature of gro j174428 has been clearly established from the observation in its x  ray emission of coherent 0.467  s pulsations ( @xcite ) .",
    "the rb shows a variety of emission modes . at some times it appears as a typical low magnetic field lmxrb with persistent emission ( pe ) and type i bursting emission (",
    "be ) ; but there are times when both type i and type ii be are observed , and times with only type ii be . in the presence of type ii bursts only , the pe is well visible after long ( @xmath330  s ) events , but is weak or absent during short type ii events .",
    "the time behaviour of the pe between type ii bursts , when it is observable , is complex with dips ( before and after type ii burts ) , humps , glitches , bumps ( @xcite ) and periodicities known as ` ringing tail ' observed shortly after long type ii bursts ( @xcite ) .",
    "type ii bursts have been observed with durations between @xmath23  s and 640  s : the shortest events ( less than @xmath220  s ) show a sharp rise and a decay with multiple peaks ( ` ringing ' ) , instead the longer events are flat topped .",
    "their time behaviour is like that of a relaxation oscillator : their fluence @xmath4 is roughly proportional to the time interval , @xmath5 , to the following burst ( @xcite ) .",
    "quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) with centroid frequencies in the range from @xmath22 to @xmath27  hz were observed in type ii bursts ; the centroid frequency was found to be anti - correlated with the burst peak flux ( see review by lewin et al .",
    "also in the pe qpos were observed with centroid frequencies from @xmath20.04 to @xmath24.5  hz with no frequency  intensity correlation , a repetitive pattern from @xmath24  hz to to @xmath22  hz , and a positive correlation with spectral hardness ( @xcite ) .",
    "the spectral properties of the type ii be and of the pe have been extensively investigated in the x  ray energy band up to about 20  kev .",
    "some authors ( @xcite ; @xcite ) found that type ii burst spectra were well fit by a blackbody ( bb ) spectrum with @xmath6 1.52  kev , while stella et al .",
    "( 1988 ) , analyzing long type ii bursts , found that the best fit was obtained with an unsaturated comptonization model ( @xmath7 , with @xmath8 and @xmath9  kev for 1.5 - 2 min events ) .",
    "instead , a two - component blackbody ( 2bb ) plus a power law ( pl ) provided the best fit to the spectra between 2 and 20  kev ( @xcite ) .",
    "the unsaturated comptonization model was found to describe well the pe spectra ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , with @xmath10 and @xmath11  kev in the time periods after 1.5 - 2 min type ii events ( @xcite ) .",
    "instead guerriero et al .",
    "( 1999 ) found that the pe is well described by the same model used for the type ii bursts ( i.e. 2bb+pl ) .",
    "an observation of the source in quiescence with the asca satellite provided a positive detection with a 210 kev luminosity of ( 1.9@xmath12  erg s@xmath0 , for a distance of 8  kpc and an hydrogen column density of 1@xmath13  @xmath14 ( asai et al . 1996 ) .    up to now , a detailed study of the evolution of the spectral properties and the decay profile to quiescence of the rb has never been performed .",
    "in addition , the high - energy emission from the source is still poorly known ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in order to address these issues , a series of observations",
    "was performed during the 1998 february - march outburst ( fox et al .",
    "1998 ) with the  satellite ( @xcite ) . in sect .  2 we describe the observations , in sect .  3",
    "we present the spectral results , while in sect .",
    "4 we discuss them and the source transition to quiescence together with their implications .",
    "the rb was observed with the  narrow field instruments ( nfis ) four times as a target of opportunity ( too ) .",
    "the nfis include the low - energy concentrator spectrometer ( lecs : 0.110  kev ; @xcite ) , two medium - energy concentrator spectrometers ( mecs : 1.510  kev ; @xcite ) , and the phoswich detection system ( pds : 15300  kev ; @xcite ) .",
    "the two mecs consist of grazing incidence telescopes with imaging gas scintillation proportional counters in their focal planes .",
    "the lecs uses an identical concentrator system as the mecs , but utilizes an ultra - thin entrance window and a driftless configuration to extend the low - energy response down to 0.1  kev .",
    "the lecs and the mecs have a circular field of view with diameter 37@xmath15 and 56@xmath15 , respectively .",
    "the pds ( field of view of @xmath21@xmath16.3@xmath17@xmath21@xmath16.3 fwhm ) consists of four independent detection units arranged in pairs , each one having a separate rocking collimator .",
    "table  1 reports the log of the too observations presented in this paper .",
    "they spanned just over one month ( from february 18 to march 18 ) and caught the object during different emission modes and flux levels as it was decaying from an x  ray intensity of about 20% that of the outburst peak down to quiescence .",

    "was adopted in order to minimize the contamination from this source : the pds rocking collimators were offset by 40@xmath18 along a direction opposite from that of 4u172834 .",
    "unfortunately , due to an incorrect instrumental setting , these collimators did not move during too2 and too3 .",
    "thus only the lecs and mecs data are usable for these two observations .    during the last observation the rb , very faint at that time ,",
    "was not detected with the nfis .",

    "ray bursts during 9.5  ks of good observation time , corresponding to an average rate of 43 bursts hr@xmath0 .",
    "their type ii character is apparent from the ` ringing ' visible in their profiles and by the time between them .",
    "the rb appeared to be in the phase ii , mode ii of the classification by marshall et al .",
    "( 1979 ) : all the events occurred almost regularly ( at a time distance of about 100  s ) and had short time durations ( about 15  s ) . also in the 0.12  kev lecs data these type ii bursts were visible . the total time - averaged 210  kev unabsorbed flux level during too1 was 8.2@xmath92  .      for the spectral analysis in the 110  kev energy range ,",
    "the mecs too1 data , binned at 1 s , were divided into two subsets : pe ( below 5 counts s@xmath0 ) and be ( above 5 counts s@xmath0 ) .",
    "then , lecs and mecs be and pe spectra were accumulated using these two time windows .",
    "given the small extraction radii used ( 4@xmath18 for the mecs , 8@xmath18 for the lecs ) , the high rb intensity level and the low flux level of 4u172834 at that time , the contamination from the latter source was negligible .",
    "the be 110  kev spectrum can be well fit ( @xmath93 = 463/395 , where @xmath24 indicates the number of degrees of freedom in the fit ) with a 2bb model , photoelectrically absorbed ( the hydrogen column density was modeled using the wisconsin cross sections as implemented in xspec ; see @xcite ) .",
    "the same fitting model applies to the pe spectrum ( @xmath94/@xmath95 ) . in table  2",
    "we show the fit results .",
    "the 2bb model was also used by guerriero et al .",
    "( 1999 ) to fit the _",
    "r - xte_/pca be and pe spectra of the rb in the 220  kev band .",
    "these authors however noted that the pe between 10 and 20 kev was better fit by adding a pl component . in our 210  kev band spectra",
    "this was not necessary ; but , when the data beyond 10 kev were considered ( see sect .",
    "3.1.2 ) , an additional component had to be added .",
    "as it can be seen from table  2 , the bb temperatures did not significantly change for the pe and the be , while the 2bb luminosities were much higher during be than during pe .",
    "the column densities appeared also to be different for pe and be spectra : @xmath9610@xmath26 @xmath14 and @xmath9710@xmath26 @xmath14 , respectively .",
    "the increase of the @xmath25 column density during the be is apparent .",
    "the value obtained for the pe is consistent with the color excess @xmath98 measured along the rb direction ( @xcite ) .    from the mecs",
    "210  kev too1 observation we also computed the ratio , @xmath99 , between the ( unabsorbed ) pe and be fluences integrated over the too1 observation time .",
    "we found that @xmath99 = 0.154 @xmath490.002 , that is about two orders of magnitude lower than the mimimum value observed ( @xmath210 ) in the case of type i x  ray bursts ( @xcite ) .",
    "this result confirms the type ii character of the detected bursts .      during too1",
    "the rb was also visible in hard x ",
    "rays ( 15100 kev ) .",
    "however , due to the lower statistical quality of the data , the pds light curve was much noisier and it was difficult to single out the bursts . in order to separate the be from the pe , two pds spectra ( ` persistent ' and ` bursting ' ) were accumulated using the time intervals of the bursts given by the mecs data . given the residual contamination from 4u172834 , we only derived the high energy spectrum of the be using as background level the count rate spectrum measured during the pe time intervals .",
    "the combined lecs+mecs+pds pe - subtracted be spectrum in the 1100  kev energy band is shown in fig .",
    "5 . as it can be seen , the source was clearly detected at high energies . to our knowledge , this is the first time the rb is detected above 20  kev .",
    "a simple 2bb model did not clearly fit the data ( @xmath100 ) , especially at high energies ( @xmath1910 kev ) .",
    "a satisfactory fit ( @xmath101 ) was obtained by adding to the 2bb model a pl .",
    "the best fit parameters are given in table  2 .",
    "we also tried to use , alternatively to the pl , a comptonization model of soft photons in a hot thermal plasma ( titarchuk 1994 ; comptt model in xspec ) , by assuming seed photons with temperature given by one of the two temperatures of the 2bb model . a fit quality ( @xmath102 ) similar to that achieved with the pl model was obtained , but electron temperature and optical depth of the comptonizing cloud were not constrained by the data ( @xmath103  kev and @xmath104 , with large uncertianties ) .",
    "when the comptonization model was used , the fit quality did not depend on the chosen seed photon temperature : both the cooler and the hotter bb photons provided fits of comparable quality .",
    "also , disk and spherical geometries for the comptonization resulted in equivalent fits .",
    "the addition of a fe k emission line to the 2bb+pl improved the fit ( @xmath105 ) ; the probability of a chance improvement , computed by means of an f - test , was quite low ( @xmath21@xmath1710@xmath106 ) .",
    "the flux and energy centroid derived for the fe k line ( see table  2 ) are consistent with the findings by stella et al .",
    "( 1988 ) , while the width is lower by a factor @xmath23 .",
    "however barr et al .",
    "( 1987 ) gave an upper limit to the width of this line which is consistent with our measurement .",
    "no evidence of the same line was found in the 110 kev pe spectrum ; however the flux was too low to allow a similar detection .      during this observation",
    "the rb drastically reduced its bursting activity ( see fig .",
    "3 ) : only 5 bursts were detected at the beginning of the observation , with time duration of @xmath230  40 s and time distance among them spanning from @xmath220 to @xmath290 minutes . the general shape of these 5 bursts ( fig .",
    "4 ) is similar each other and differs from those of too1 for the pre - maximum during their rise .",
    "this appears to be a sort of ` hybrid ' shape between short ( @xmath10715 s ) and long ( 1 min or more ) , flat - topped bursts ( see , e.g. , lubin et al .",
    "1992 , 1993 , and guerriero et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "the 210  kev flux level of the pe decreased by a factor 1.4 , while the total time - averaged 210  kev unabsorbed flux ( @xmath108  ) decreased by a factor of about 8 with respect to too1 .",
    "the 210  kev @xmath99 ratio between the ( unabsorbed ) pe and be fluences integrated over the too2 observation time was 4.17 @xmath49 0.15 , thus significantly higher than that found during too1 , but lower than the minimum value measured in the case of type i x  ray bursts . given that some bursts might have been lost during the source occultation by the earth , we have also computed @xmath99 for the first three orbits of too2 , i.e. where the 5 bursts were seen . in this case , we found that @xmath99 = 1.40 @xmath49 0.05 .",
    "this value is still higher than that found in too1 , but lower than the minimum value measured in the case of type i bursts .",
    "the 1.810  kev spectrum of the be in too2 was still consistent with the 2bb model with @xmath109  kev and @xmath110  kev , even though , due to the poor statistics particularly in the lecs and below 2 kev , we could not derive accurate parameter values .",
    "therefore , to better constrain the main parameters of the model , we fixed the @xmath25 value to that obtained from the spectral fit of the too1 110 kev be .",
    "the results of the too2 be fit are reported in table 2 .",
    "the pe also ( see fig .",
    "6 ) was best fit ( @xmath111 ) with a photoelectrically absorbed 2bb model ( see table  2 ) with @xmath112  kev and @xmath113  kev , although a photoelectrically absorbed bremsstrahlung model also gave an acceptable fit ( @xmath114 ) .",
    "the 2bb temperatures of be and pe did not appear to change significantly from the corresponding values measured during too1 .",
    "no substantial improvement in the fit was seen if a pl or a comptonization component was included .",
    "no indication for a fe k emission line was present in the too2 data .      during too3 ,",
    "33 days from the outburst onset , the source further reduced its x  ray emission and no bursts were seen throughout the observation .",
    "the unabsorbed and time - averaged 210  kev flux , @xmath115  , had decreased by a factor 7 with respect to too2 .",
    "the 0.510 kev spectrum of the pe is shown in fig .",
    "again it was well fit ( @xmath116 ) with a photoelectrically absorbed 2bb model ( see table  2 ) , with @xmath117  kev and @xmath118  kev .",
    "the temperature of the hotter component seemed to be marginally higher than the corresponding value observed in too2 , while @xmath33 was fully consistent with the value obtained during too2 .",
    "a photoelectrically absorbed bremsstrahlung gave a poorer fit ( @xmath119 ) .",
    "as in the case of too2 , no fe k emission line was detected .      during this observation the rb was no longer visible in the lecs and mecs images .",
    "instead , strong contamination due to stray light from 4u172834 was apparent and extended up to the center of the mecs image , where the rb emission was especially located .",
    "4u172834 was particularly active during too4 and prevented us from getting a deep observation of the rb .",
    "the pds data were excluded from the analysis of too4 data since it proved impossible to disentangle the rb emission from the contamination induced by 4u172834 .    using the background level present in the extraction circle of the rb image",
    ", we evaluated the upper limit to the 210 kev count rate from the rb .",
    "the result of this analysis indicates that , assuming the best fit model spectrum of too3 , an emission of 1.5@xmath1710@xmath120 erg @xmath14 s@xmath0 from the rb would have been clearly detected at 3@xmath121 at the relevant position in the mecs field of view .",
    "thus , we can conservatively consider this value as a 3@xmath121 upper limit to the rb x  ray emission in the 210 kev energy band .",
    "the corresponding 3@xmath121 upper limit to the 210  kev luminosity is @xmath122  erg s@xmath0 .",
    "the  observations of the rb have permitted us to detect for the first time high energy x - rays ( @xmath1920  kev ) from type ii bursts and to study the source in the late phase of the flux decay , from 21 to 48  days after the outburst onset .",
    "type ii bursts were detected in too1 and too2 , corresponding to 21 and 30 days since the outburst start , while the pe was observed in all toos but the last observation , when the rb was not visible anymore .      the broad band ( 1100  kev ) pe - subtracted spectrum of the be , measured during too1 , is well described by a 2bb+pl model , with bb temperatures of @xmath20.3 and @xmath21.7  kev , while the photon index of the high energy pl component is @xmath23 .",
    "the presence of a high energy component is not apparent in the 110  kev spectrum , well described by a simple 2bb model .",
    "a thermal comptonization model ( @xcite ) also fits the high energy component of the be pe - subtracted spectrum , but the thermal plasma parameters are not well constrained .",
    "the presence of a high energy component is common in persistent low - luminosity lmxrbs ( mainly x - ray bursters , see e.g. the review paper by tavani & barret 1997 ) , and it is also seen during the outburst in some soft x - ray transients ( sxts ) containing nss ( e.g. , aql x-1 and cen x-4 , see @xcite ) .",
    "instead this component is generally not observed in high - luminosity lmxrbs ( z - sources ; see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "only recently , thanks to , evidence of high energy components in z sources has been reported from some objects ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this component has been interpreted in these sources as due to the presence , along with an accretion disk , of a cloud of hot electrons which comptonize soft photons coming from the disk , similarly to what occurs in stellar mass black - hole candidates ( @xcite ) .",
    "the be spectrum ( not pe - subtracted ) below 10  kev during too1 and too2 is well fit with a 2bb model , in spite of a different shape of the burst time profiles as seen in these two  pointings .",
    "the 2bb temperatures of the be do not appear to change from too1 to too2 , as well as the cooler bb luminosity , while the hotter bb component changes its luminosity by a factor 2 .",
    "this means that the bb radius of the hotter component is sensibly lower during too2 be .",
    "the pe , with decreasing intensity , has been detected up to 10 kev in all but the last too observations ( see table  2 ) .",
    "its spectrum is well fit by a 2bb model over the luminosity range over which the source could be studied with the lecs and the mecs ( from too1 to too3 ) .",
    "the temperatures of the two bb components do not change with time , except for a marginal evidence of an increase in the hotter component during too3 .",
    "the bb luminosities instead do change . as a consequence , both bb radii ( see table  2 ) decrease with time : @xmath47 from 6.5 to 1.7  km , and @xmath66 from 0.8 to 0.2  km .    within the errors , pe and be have hotter bb components with the same temperatures , while the temperature of the cooler bb component is slightly higher during pe than during be ( 0.63@xmath490.03  kev against 0.43@xmath123  kev ) . during too1",
    ", the bb luminosities are however much different in the two source states : the be / pe luminosity ratio of the hotter bb is 64@xmath495 during too1 and 32@xmath492 in too2 , while that of the colder bb is 18@xmath497 in too1 and 44@xmath4912 during too2 .",
    "also , in too1 , during the be the hotter bb component is brighter ( by nearly a factor 3 ) than the cooler bb , while during the pe they have similar luminosities . in too2 , instead , the latter ratio becomes @xmath22 due to the lower pe luminosity of the cooler bb .    on the basis of these features , a possible picture of the 2bb model ( already discussed by @xcite )",
    "is that the colder component originates from an accretion disk , while the hotter from the ns surface .",
    "a comptonizing plasma cloud is the likely origin of the be high energy component .",
    "the increase in luminosity of the colder bb component during the be can be interpreted as an increase of the disk emitting surface ( by a factor @xmath124 in too1 and @xmath125 in too2 ) as a consequence of the reduction of the inner radius of the accretion disk , while that of the hotter component could be due to an expansion in size ( by a factor @xmath126 in too1 and @xmath127 in too2 ) of the ns surface that emits x  rays .",
    "another relevant result of our observations is the determination , for the first time , of the source flux decay toward quiescence . in fig .",
    "8 we show the decay curve of the 1998 feb - mar outburst of the rb based on the _ r - xte_/asm and  data . as it can be seen , starting from day 28 after the outburst onset , the flux decay becomes much faster than before : the @xmath128-folding decay time @xmath129 changes from @xmath130  days to @xmath131  days .",
    "this behaviour is reminiscent of the final evolution of dwarf novae outbursts ( @xcite ) and of the transition to quiescence of the sxts that harbour a low magnetic field ns ( e.g. , aql x-1 , @xcite ; sax j1808.4 - 3658 , @xcite ) or a black hole ( see the review by tanaka & shibazaki 1996 ) . in the case of aql x-1 ( @xcite )",
    "this time behaviour was interpreted as a consequence of the propeller effect ( @xcite ) . in the present case , the same effect can explain our observational results also .",
    "indeed a magnetosphere may be present in the rb as consequence of the relaxation oscillator character of the type ii bursts recurrence behaviour ( @xcite ; baan 1977 , 1979 ) and low frequency qpos detected in the be and pe ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . in the model by baan ( 1977 , 1979 ) , a reservoir of matter floats on the top of the ns magnetosphere , partly supported by centrifugal forces . in the intervals between bursts , the magnetosphere becomes larger than the corotation radius .",
    "as matter accumulates on the magnetospheric boundary , this shrinks .",
    "when the magnetospheric radius becomes lower than a critical value at which gravity overcomes the centrifugal and magnetospheric forces , type ii bursts occur .",
    "this model is qualitatively in agreement with our observations .",
    "as long as we observed ( in too1 ) type ii bursts , the flux decay was on the extrapolation of the earlier light curve . during too2 ,",
    "when we mainly observed pe ( only 5 bursts at the beginning of the  pointing were detected ) , we found the first deviation .",
    "the sharper decrease of the pe intensity continued down to our quiescent luminosity upper limit .",
    "in this scenario , the absence of type ii bursts in this decay phase is due to no accumulation of matter on the magnetospheric boundary , as consequence of a low mass accretion from the companion star .",
    "this fact leads to an increased magnetospheric radius . when the magnetospheric radius @xmath132 @xmath133  cm ( @xmath134 is the magnetic dipole moment in units of @xmath135  gauss @xmath136 and @xmath137 is the ns mass in units of 1.4 @xmath138 ) becomes equal to the corotation radius @xmath139 @xmath140  cm ( @xmath141 is the spin period ) , accretion is inhibited ( @xcite ) .",
    "the corresponding minimum luminosity is given by @xmath142erg s@xmath0 , where @xmath143  gauss is the surface magnetic field of the ns , and @xmath144  ms is the ns spin period ( ns mass @xmath145 and radius @xmath146 are assumed to be 1.4@xmath138 and 10@xmath147  cm , respectively ) .",
    "once accretion onto the ns surface is inhibited , as also discussed by stella et al .",
    "( 1994 ) and campana et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , a lower accretion luminosity @xmath148 , corresponding to a gravitational potential energy of @xmath149 , is released .",
    "it can be easily shown that @xmath150erg s@xmath0 , with the same assumptions made for @xmath151 ( @xcite ) . from fig .",
    "8 , we can estimate @xmath152  erg s@xmath0 .",
    "on the other hand , fox & lewin ( 1999 ) , from a timing analysis of _ r - xte _ data from the rb , found two peaks in the power spectral density spectrum of the type i be , one at 154.9@xmath490.1  hz and the other at 306.6@xmath490.1  hz . assuming the lower frequency as due to the spin period , from the estimated value of @xmath151 we would obtain @xmath153  erg s@xmath0 .",
    "this is significantly lower than the luminosity measured during too2 , which can be considered as a lower limit for @xmath148 .",
    "a higher value of @xmath148 ( 9@xmath154  erg s@xmath0 ) is expected in the case we assume as spin period that corresponding to the higher frequency reported by fox & lewin ( 1999 ) .",
    "this spin period ( 3.3 ms ) is more consistent with our results and implies a magnetic field @xmath155 gauss , which then appears , on the basis of our luminosity data , the most likely value of @xmath156 to be associated to the ns harboured in the system .",
    "the contamination from 4u172834 prevented us to draw conclusions on the quiescent luminosity from the rb .",
    "our 3@xmath121 upper limit to this luminosity ( 1@xmath1710@xmath157 erg s@xmath0 ) is consistent with the luminosity level ( 1.9@xmath158 erg s@xmath0 ) reported by asai et al .",
    "( 1996 ) during quiescence .",
    "the latter value is consistent with the minimum accretion luminosity ( 1.6@xmath1710@xmath159 erg s@xmath0 ) that can be emitted in the propeller regime ( @xmath160erg s@xmath0 , @xcite ) , even though the detected luminosity , as discussed by asai et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , could be partially due to low - luminosity x ",
    "ray sources within the globular cluster liller 1 .",
    "an unbiased estimate of the rb quiescent luminosity is highly desirable to test the role of the propeller effect in quiescence .",
    "we are grateful to p. giommi for his help in the use of saxsim for the analysis of the too4 mecs data .",
