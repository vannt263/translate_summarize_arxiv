    "studying the optical morphology of high redshift ( @xmath2 ) radio galaxies ( hzrgs ) can contribute substantially to our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution in the early universe ( for a recent review see mccarthy 1993 ) . although the recent development of new techniques ( e.g. u and b band dropouts , steidel et al .",
    "1996 ) has led to the discovery of a large population of high redshift galaxies , radio galaxies remain still of exceptional interest , because they pinpoint the most massive systems at high redshift and are potential signposts for finding high - redshift clusters of galaxies .",
    "+ it has been shown that high luminosity radio sources associated with quasars and radio galaxies at redshift @xmath3 are located in rich clusters ( e.g. hill & lilly 1991 ) . at @xmath4",

    "the existence of clusters around hzrgs has not been established .",
    "however , there is an increasing number of important observational indications that hzrgs might be in clusters , including ( i ) the detection of possibly extended x - ray emission from the radio galaxy pks 1138 - 262 at z=2.156 , most probably coming from a hot cluster atmosphere ( carilli et al .",
    "1998 ) ; ( ii ) strong faraday polarization and rotation of the radio emission of some hzrgs which might be due to dense gaseous halos ( carilli et al .",
    "1997 ) ; ( iii ) possible excess of companion galaxies detected along the axes of the radio sources ( rttgering et al .",
    "1996 ) ; ( iv ) possible excess of lyman break selected galaxies in the fields of several powerful radio sources ( e.g. lacy & rawlings , 1996 ) and ( v ) excess of candidate companion galaxies ( with two objects spectroscopically confirmed ) in the vicinity of mrc 0316 - 257 , at z=3.14 ( le fevre et al .",

    "1997 ) , might indicate that the hosts of powerful radio sources are the most massive galaxies know at high  redshifts .",
    "moreover , since hzrgs are probably located in forming clusters of galaxies , they could be the ancestors of brightest cluster galaxies .",
    "+ we have previously presented and discussed hst images of the radio galaxy pks 1138 - 262 at z=2.156 , which shows the clumpiest optical morphology of all the hzrgs imaged with the hst ( pentericci et al .",

    "details of observations and reduction for both sources can be found in appendix a and b.      the coordinate frame for the wfpc2 images determined from the image header information has uncertainties of the order of @xmath48 ( @xcite ) .",
    "since the optical galaxies are generally clumpy on a scale smaller than @xmath48 , it is important to get the better possible registration between the radio and the optical images , to allow a detailed inter - comparison between the emissions .",
    "+    in overlaying the hst images with the radio vla images we made the following assumptions : for those sources showing a clear detection of the radio nucleus and for which good k - band ( or k@xmath49-band ) images existed ( mccarthy , private communication ) , we assumed that the peak position of the infra - red image would be a better indicator of the true location of the center of the host galaxy , rather than the peak of the hst image , since the uv continuum might be effected by dust extinction ( e.g de koff et al .",
    "we therefore identified the position of the radio core in the vla image with the peak position of the k - band image .",
    "finally we registered the hst frame and the infrared frame using the weighted positions of several stars which were present on both fields ; this can be achieved with an accuracy of 0.1@xmath30 which is then the total final uncertainty in the relative astrometry .",

    "+ for those objects which had a clearly detected radio core but no k - band images , we associated the peak position of the hst image to the peak position of the radio emission .",
    "we followed this procedure for the radio galaxies 4c 1345 + 245 , 4c 1410 - 001 and tx 0828 + 128 ( for this last object see remarks made in the individual source description ) : these objects have a relatively simple morphology , hence it is reasonable to assume that the peak of the uv continuum represents the true nucleus of the galaxy ; the final uncertainty of the relative astrometry is then within a pixel i.e. @xmath50 . + for those objects which have no detected radio core ( mrc 0943@xmath36242 , tx 1707 + 105 and mg 2141 + 192 ) we used the hst absolute astrometry , and we then checked the peak position of several stars which were present on the wfpc2 frames , with the position given in the apm catalog ; with this method we achieved an accuracy of @xmath51 .",
    "finally for b2 0902 + 343 which has a radio core but no clear optical nucleus , we kept the natural hst astrometry : in this way the radio core falls in between the two optical peaks .",

    "grey scale hst wfpc2 images ( smoothed with a gaussian function of fwhm equal to 2 pixels ) with vla radio contours superimposed are shown in figs . 1 - 10 .",

    "we do not show such maps for b2 0902 + 343 and mg 2141 + 192 because they have very low surface brightness , and a contour map would add no information . for the very large radio galaxies ( namely tx 0211 - 122 , tx 1707 + 105 and 4c 1410 - 001 ) we also present a third image showing the complete field of the radio source .",

    ", none of the proposed models can be ruled out by the present data .",
    "therefore it seems likely that all three mechanism contribute to the aligned light , but their relative importance varies greatly from object to object .",
    "+      a striking feature of the hst images of the radio galaxies is the widespread clumpiness of the optical continuum emission .",
    "most galaxies are comprised of several components , regardless of the fact whether they are aligned or not with the radio axis ; the clumps are resolved and their typical sizes are in the range 2 - 10 kpc .    to give a consistent definition of `` clumpiness ''",
    "we proceeded in the following way : since the size of our sample is small , and for the faintest galaxies it is difficult to delineate the structures , we first normalized the total observed flux of each galaxy ( within a fixed aperture ) taking the faintest and most distant galaxy mg 2141 + 192 as reference .",
    "we then defined the parameter n as the number of components which have at least one contour at a flux level of @xmath70 erg @xmath16 sec@xmath9@xmath9 .",
    "this value was chosen so that the radio galaxy mg 2141 + 192 had 3 clumps .",
    "note that , despite the difference in restframe frequencies sampled by the observations ( see table 1 ) , this is a good approximation because the spectral energy distribution of hzrgs in the uv wavelength range ( 1300 - 2000  ) is generally flat .",
    "13 we present a plot showing how n , our measure of clumpiness , varies with radio size , for all the radio galaxies in the sample .",
    "clearly there is a tendency for the larger radio sources to have a clumpier optical continuum : the sources with radio sizes greater than @xmath65kpc have on average more than twice as many clumps as the smaller radio galaxies .",
    "a spearman rank correlation test gives a significance level of 95@xmath71 for this correlation .",
    "+ a possible explanation for this trend is that the medium around the hosts of powerful agn is dense and clumpy on a scale of more than 100 kpc ; as the radio sources expand through the gas , they light up more and more material either by triggering star formation in the gas clouds , or by enhancing the scattering properties of the material in the vicinity of the jets . this result is contrary to that found by best et al .",
    "( 1996 ) for a complete sample of @xmath72 3cr radio sources , which have been imaged with the hst : they found that smaller radio sources tend to be comprised of a string of several knots , while larger radio galaxies are made generally of only 2 optical components .",
    "however note that the range of radio sizes of the @xmath72 3cr sample is 3 times as large as that of our sample .",
    "our sample covers a redshift range from z@xmath52 to z@xmath53.8 , which correspond to look - back times from 80% to 90% of the total age of the universe ( for @xmath73 ) .",

    "their sample is similar to ours , being comprised or a similar number of sources , with the same radio power , but has a higher average redshift ( @xmath75 versus @xmath76 ) and more galaxies having @xmath77 .",
    "there are 6 radio galaxies common to both samples .",
    "14 we present the results for our sample of hzrgs : the left plot shows how the radio /optical size ratio vary with redshift ; the radio sizes are measured as the distances between the most distant hot - spots , on either side of the nucleus , while the optical lengths are defined to be the maximum extension of the optical emission in the direction of the radio source . in cases of multiple systems , such as pks 1138 - 262 and",

    "if we divide the sample in two redshift ranges , then the average radio / optical size ratio is 3.2 for the highest redshift bin ( @xmath78 ) and 3.4 for the lowest redshift radio galaxies , so the difference is negligible .",
    "this is different from the result of an breugel et al . for the infrared emission : they present marginal evidence that the host of @xmath77 radio galaxies are comparable in size with the radio sources , while the @xmath79 radio sources appear systematically larger that the hosts galaxies .",

    "14 we show how the strength of the radio - optical alignment , represented by the difference in position angle between the optical and the radio emission @xmath68 ( see sect . above for definition ) varies with z. again there is no significant difference between the lowest redshift radio galaxies , which have an average pa difference of 20@xmath80 ) , is extremely different from the pa of whole system ( 3 galaxies , pa@xmath81 ) ] and the highest redshift sources which have an average of 18@xmath82 . on the contrary van breugel et al .",

    "the best interpretation is that , while for the lower redshift sources in their sample the near ir emission is dominated by the most evolved stellar population , ( which is less effected by the presence of the radio jets ) , for the very high redshift galaxies the observed near ir emission starts to be dominated by young stars , probably formed following the passage of the radio jets .",
    "+ on the other hand , our hst observations sample the uv restframe emission which is though to be dominated by the younger stellar populations in all cases , regardless of redshift .",
    "these young hot stars are formed in subsequent small bursts , induced either by the interaction of the jets with the medium or by mergers of smaller subunits .",
    "such events may involve only little amounts of mass , but can still produce remarkable uv morphologies ( e.g 1138 - 262 pentericci et al .",
    "1998 ) , and their frequency is not expected to change from redshift 4 to 2 .",
    "therefore we do nt expect any strong evolution in the uv restframe properties of the radio galaxies in this redshift interval .",
    "+   +      it is interesting to compare the morphologies of our high redshift radio galaxies with those of the high redshift galaxies , which have been recently discovered with uv dropout techniques and extensively studied by various groups , also with the hst ( see for example steidel et al .",

    "6.1 , a fraction of the uv continuum emission of hzrgs is directly connected , through various possible mechanisms , to the presence of the agn . also some of the features that we see in the galaxies can be easily explained by a direct correlation with the radio jets , for example the narrow elongated structures seen in 4c 1243 + 036 and mrc 2104@xmath36242 and the jet - like feature observed in 4c 1345 + 245 . however in other cases there is a striking similarity between the _ individual components _ of the radio galaxies and the population of uv dropout galaxies , which clearly favors a stellar origin for the emission coming from those clumps .",
    "+ particularly in some of the clumpiest and most extended radio galaxies , such as tx 1707 + 105 and mrc 2104@xmath36242 , there are components that have a compact and regular morphology , with sizes of the order of few kpc resembling that of the high redshift radio - quiet galaxies . in a previous paper we made a detailed inter - comparison between the clumps that are observed around the radio galaxy 1138@xmath36262 to the uv dropout galaxies :",
    "the conclusion was that those components had characteristics similar to the uv dropout galaxies such as absolute magnitudes , surface brightness profiles , half - light radii ( @xmath84 kpc ) and inferred star formation rates ( 5 - 10 @xmath85yr@xmath9 per clump ; pentericci et al .",
    "also 4c41.17 has a similar very clumpy morphology with compelling evidence that the clumps are star forming regions .",
    "however we must note that it is not yet possible to determine the masses of neither of the 2 classes of objects ( uv dropouts and radio galaxies clumps ) ; so it could as well be that they are intrinsically different objects , with a similar amount of star - bursting activity that make them look similar in the uv continuum emission .",
    "+ it seems that at least some of the high redshift radio galaxies consist of a central large galaxy , that hosts the agn and a number of small star forming subunits , resembling the uv dropout galaxies , which are located in a region as large as @xmath86 kpc around the radio source .",
    "powerful radio sources would then pin - point to regions in which the density of star forming units is higher than average .",
    "the central host galaxies of radio sources may well have formed trough merging of these small sub - galactic stellar systems .",
    "note that the mergers of these gas - rich subunits with the host galaxies could have triggered ( or re - triggered ) the radio emission by providing fuel for the central engine of the agns , as it seen in many cases at low z ( e.g osterbrock 1993 ) .",
    "+ our observations provide some qualitative support for hierarchical galaxy evolution models , which predict that the morphological appearance of galaxies during their formation period should be highly irregular and clumpy ( e.g baron & white 1989 ) .",
    "in particular semi - analytical models predict that one of the forms in which massive elliptical galaxies accrete their mass is from multiple merging of smaller subunits ( aragon - salamanca et al .",
    "1998 , and references therein .",
    "a possible problem arises from the fact that in standard hierarchical cold dark matter models such massive systems are thought to form relatively late ( @xcite ) , i.e. at much lower redshift , and in the majority of galaxies the main population of stars is formed more recently ( after @xmath87 ) @xcite .",
    "however , white & frenk ( 1991 ) argue that a mechanism that could explain the formation of massive elliptical galaxies at an earlier epoch is over - merging of star - burst galaxies and indeed , as we have reviewed in the introduction , there is now increasing evidence that high redshift radio galaxies are probably located in the over - dense regions of the early universe .",
    "+ therefore we conclude that high redshift radio galaxies may be formed from a aggregates of sub - galactic units , similar to the uv dropout galaxies , and will probably evolve into present day brightest cluster galaxies .",
    "in this paper we have presented new hst / wfpc2 images of 11 high redshift radio galaxies , all complemented with vla radio maps of comparable resolution .",
    "the images reveal a wide variety in the morphology of the host galaxies of these high redshift radio sources : in particular most objects have a clumpy , irregular appearance , consisting of a bright nucleus and a number of smaller components .",
    "the number of clumps seems to increase with increasing radio size .",
    "the uv continuum emission is generally elongated and aligned with the axis of the radio sources , however the characteristics of the `` alignment effect '' differ greatly from case to case .",
    "the new data confirm that none of the proposed models can satisfactorily explain the phenomenon and that most probably the aligned continuum emission is a mixture of star light , scattered light , and nebular continuum emission .",
    "our data show no significant evolution in the morphological properties over the redshift interval . finally , we compare the properties of our radio galaxies with those of the uv dropout galaxies and conclude that high redshift radio galaxies might be forming from aggregates of sub - clumps similar to the uv dropout galaxies and that they will probably evolve into present day brightest cluster galaxies . + in a future paper we will present complementary hst / nicmos data of an enlarged sample of high redshift radio galaxies .",
    "the new infrared observations will provide constrains to the age of the older stellar population of the host galaxies . with the high resolution we will be able to determine if also the older stellar population shows significant clumpy sub - structures and to what extent are the forming brightest cluster ellipticals already assembled and relaxed .",
