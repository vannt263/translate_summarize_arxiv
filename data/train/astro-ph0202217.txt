    "recent measurements from some type ia supernovae ( sne ) at intermediate and high redshifts ( perlmutter et al . 1999 , riess et al . 1998 ) indicate that the bulk of energy in the universe is repulsive and appears like a  quintessence \" component , that is , an unknown form of dark energy ( in addition to the ordinary cdm matter ) probably of primordial origin ( see turner 2000 for a review ) .",
    "together with the observations of cmb anisotropies ( de bernardis 2000 ) , such results seem to provide an important piece of information connecting an early inflationary stage with the astronomical observations .",
    "this state of affairs has stimulated the interest for more general models containing an extra component describing this dark energy , and simultaneously accounting for the present accelerated stage of the universe .",
    "however , the absence of a convincing evidence on the nature of the dark component gave origin to an intense debate and mainly to theoretical speculations .",

    "here we are interested in the first class of models .",
    "the basic reason is the widespread belief that the early universe evolved through a cascade of phase transitions , thereby yielding a vacuum energy density which at present is at least @xmath4 orders of magnitude smaller than in the planck time ( weinberg 1989 ) .",
    "such a discrepancy between theoretical expectation ( from the modern microscopic theory of particles and gravity ) and empirical observations constitutes a fundamental problem in the interface uniting astrophysics , particle physics and cosmology , which is often called `` the cosmological constant problem '' ( weinberg 1989 ; jack ng 1992 ; dolgov 1997 ) .",
    "this puzzle inspired some authors ( lima and maia 1994 , lima and trodden 1996 ) to propose a class of phenomenological deflationary cosmologies driven by a decaying vacuum energy density where the present value , @xmath5 , is a remnant of the primordial inflationary stage ( from now on the subscript ",
    "o \" denotes the present day quantities ) .",
    "the basic scenario has an interesting cosmological history that evolves in three stages .",
    "initially , an unstable de sitter configuration , with no matter and radiation is supported by the largest values of the vacuum energy density .",
    "this nonsingular de sitter state evolves to a quasi - frw vacuum - radiation - dominated phase , and , subsequently , the universe changes continuously from vacuum - radiation to the present vacuum - dust dominated phase",
    ". the first stage harmonizes the scenario with the cosmological constant problem , while the transition to the second stage solves the horizon and other well - know problems in the same manner as in inflation .",
    "finally , the universe enters in the present vacuum - dust phase with a negative deceleration parameter as required by the sne type ia observations .    in this article , we focus our attention on this class of deflationary decaying vacuum models .",
    "the effective time dependent cosmological term is regarded as a second fluid component with energy density , @xmath6 , which transfers energy continuously to the material component .",
    "the main goal is to investigate the basic kinematic tests in the present vacuum - dust dominated phase , or equivalently , how the classical cosmological tests may constrain the physical parameters of such models .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we set up the basic equations for deflationary cosmologies driven by a decaying @xmath7-term . in section 3 , the expressions for classical cosmological tests are derived and compared with the conventional expressions without the @xmath0-term .",
    "section 4 gives the conclusion of the main results , and , in the appendix a , the exact expression yielding the dimensionless radial coordinate as a function of the redshift is deduced .",
    "we shall consider a class of spacetimes described by the general frw line element ( @xmath8 ) @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the scale factor , @xmath11 , @xmath12 is the curvature parameter of the spatial sections , and @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are dimensionless comoving coordinates . in that background ,",
    "the einstein field equations ( efe ) with a nonvacuum component plus a cosmological @xmath7-term are : @xmath16 @xmath17 where an overdot means time derivative , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the energy density and pressure , respectively . as usual , we consider that the nonvacuum component obeys the  @xmath20-law \" equation of state @xmath21 where @xmath22 $ ] specifies if the fluid component is radiation ( @xmath23 ) or dust ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "phenomenologically , we also assume that the effective @xmath7-term is a variable dynamic degree of freedom so that in an expanding universe it relaxes to its present value according with the following ansatz ( lima and trodden 1996 ) @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the vacuum density , @xmath27 is the total energy density , @xmath28 is the hubble parameter , @xmath29 is the arbitrary time scale characterizing the deflationary period , and @xmath30 $ ] is a dimensioneless parameter of order unity .",
    "it is worth noticing that for @xmath31 , the above definition reduces to @xmath32 so that we have inflation with no matter - radiation component ( @xmath33 ) . in particular ,",
    "if @xmath29 is the order of the planck time , that is , @xmath34s , one may show that such models are in accordance with the cosmological constant problem in the sense that @xmath35 .    at late times ( @xmath36 )",
    ", we see from ( 5 ) that @xmath37 , as required by the recent supernovae observations . to be more precise , if the deflationary process begins at planck time , the ratio @xmath38 while the remaining terms are of order unity .",
    "indeed , even if deflation begins much later , say at @xmath39s , or even at @xmath40s ( the respective scales of grand and electroweak unification in the standard model ) , one obtains @xmath41 and @xmath42 , respectively .",
    "this means that to a high degree of accuracy , the scale @xmath43 is unimportant during the vacuum - dust dominated phase . therefore , since in this work we mainly interested in the classical cosmological tests , henceforth we consider only this limiting behavior with the material component described by a pressureless fluid ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "let us now consider the evolution of the scale factor . combining equations ( [ rho])-([ansatz ] ) and taking the limit @xmath44 , it is readily seen that the scale factor during the vacuum - dust phase obeys the slightly modified frw equation    @xmath45    the first integral of which is @xmath46 where the constant @xmath47 in order that @xmath18 be positive definite in this phase ( see eq.(2 ) ) . by expressing the constant @xmath48 in terms of the present day parameters ,",
    "it is straightforward to show that the above equation can be rewritten as @xmath49\\quad .\\ ] ] where @xmath50 is the present value of the matter density parameter . for @xmath51",
    "the above equation reproduces the standard cold dark matter frw result ( kolb and turner 1990 ) . whereas for @xmath52 , it describes the influence of the decaying vacuum in the present phase .    following standard lines",
    "we also define the deceleration parameter @xmath53 . using equations ( [ ddr ] ) and ( [ dr ] )",
    "one may show that @xmath54 then , for any value of @xmath55 , we see that the deceleration parameter @xmath56 with decaying vacuum energy is always smaller than the corresponding one of the frw model .",
    "the critical case ( @xmath57 ) , describes a  coasting cosmology \" . however , instead of being supported by ",
    "k - matter \" ( kolb 1989 ) , this kind of model is obtained in the present context for a vacuum - dust filled universe , and the corresponding solutions hold regardless of the value of @xmath58 .",
    "it is also interesting that even negative values of @xmath56 are allowed since the constraint @xmath59 can always be satisfied provided @xmath60 .",
    "these results are in line with recent measurements of the deceleration parameter @xmath56 using type ia supernovae ( perlmutter et al .",
    "1999 ; riess et al .",
    "1998 ) . such observations indicate that the universe may be accelerating today , which corresponds dynamically to a negative pressure term in the efe .",
    "for a fixed @xmath58 , this means that the universe with decaying vacuum is older than the corresponding frw model with the usual deceleration parameter @xmath61 .",
    "this behavior also reconcile other recent results ( freedman 1998 ) , pointing to a hubble parameter @xmath62 larger than @xmath63 km s@xmath64 mpc@xmath64 .",
    "now , combining equations ( [ rho ] ) , ( [ ansatz ] ) and ( [ dr ] ) for ( @xmath65 ) one finds that vacuum and the matter energy density can be expressed as @xmath66 @xmath67 where @xmath68 . in virtue of the decaying vacuum energy , we also see that the explicit dependence of the energy density on the scale factor @xmath10 is slightly modified in comparison with the standard case . as should be expected from eqs .",
    "( [ ddr ] ) and ( [ dr ] ) , some dynamic expressions may be obtained from the standard frw ones simply by replacing the  index \" @xmath69 by an effective parameter @xmath70 ( see the above scale laws ) .",
    "the kinematical relation distances must be confronted with the observations in order to put limits on the free parameters of the deflationary class of models presented in the last section . as remarked before ,",
    "@xmath43 can not be constrained by the classical tests since it is unimportant in the present phase .",
    "it is adjusted in order to put the models in accordance to the cosmological constant problem ( lima and trodden 1996 ) .",
    "it thus follows that we have only the pair of free parameters ( @xmath71 ) satisfying @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the present value of the total density parameter .    0.1 in    \\a ) _ lookback time - redshift diagram _    the lookback time , @xmath74 , is the difference between the age of the universe at the present time ( @xmath75 ) and the age of the universe when a particular light ray at redshift @xmath76 was emitted . by integrating ( [ dr1 ] ) such a quantity",
    "is easily derived @xmath77 which generalizes the standard frw result ( kolb and turner 1990 ) .",
    "the age of the universe is obtained by taking the limit @xmath78 in the above equation .",
    "we find    @xmath79    for @xmath51 the above expressions reduce to the ones of the standard frw models ( kolb and turner 1990 ) .",
    "generically , we see that decaying vacuum increases the dimensionless parameter @xmath80 while preserving the overall expanding frw behavior .",

    "the luminosity distance of a light source is defined as the ratio of the detected energy flux @xmath84 , and the apparent luminosity , i.e. , @xmath85 . in the homogeneous and isotropic frw metric ( 1 ) it takes the form below ( sandage 1988 ) @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the radial coordinate distance of the object at light emission . inserting @xmath87",

    "however , replacing @xmath58 from ( 9 ) we recover the usual frw expansion for small redshifts , which depends only on the effective deceleration parameter @xmath56 ( weinberg 1972 ) .",
    "this is not a surprising result since expanding @xmath95 in terms of @xmath58 , the `` 00 '' component of einstein s equations has implicitly been considered , while the expansion in terms of @xmath56 comes only from the form of the frw line element .",
    "the luminosity distance as a function of the redshift for closed and open models with decaying vacuum energy is shown in figures 3 and 4 , respectively .",
    "as expected for all kinematic tests , different cosmological models have similar behavior at @xmath96 , and the greatest discrimination among them comes from observations at large redshifts . a more quantitive analysis based on the sne observations will be presented elsewhere .    0.1 in    \\c )",
    "_ angular size - redshift _    another important kinematic test is the angular size - redshift relation @xmath97 . as widely known , the data concerning the angular - size are until nowadays somewhat controversial ( see buchalter et al .",
    "1998 and references therein ) . here",
    "we are interested in angular diameters of light sources described as rigid rods and not as isophotal diameters .",
    "these quantities are naturally different , because in an expanding world the surface brightness varies with the distance ( sandage 1988 ) .",
    "the angular size of a light source of proper size @xmath98 ( assumed free of evolutionary effects ) located at @xmath99 and observed at @xmath100 is @xmath101 inserting the expression of @xmath87 given in the appendix a it follows that    0.1 in    for small @xmath76 one finds @xmath102\\quad .\\ ] ]    hence , decaying vacuum cosmologies as modeled here also requires an angular size decreasing as the inverse of the redshift for small @xmath76 .",

    "is displayed in figures 5 and 6 , respectively .    0.1 in    \\d ) _ number counts - redshift _",
    "the final kinematic test considered here is the galaxy number count per redshift interval .",
    "the number of galaxies in a comoving volume is equal to the number density of galaxies ( per comoving volume ) @xmath104 , times the comoving volume element @xmath105 @xmath106    0.1 in    by using @xmath87 as derived in appendix , it follows that the general expression for number - counts can be written as @xmath107 } \\over ( 1 + z)z^{2}f(\\omega_o , \\beta , z)}\\quad , \\ ] ] where @xmath108^{1/2}$ ] . for small redshifts",
    "@xmath109z + ... \\quad .\\ ] ] in figures 7 and 8 we have displayed the number counts - redshift relations for flat , closed and open universes for some selected values of @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "it is worth mentioning the tendency of decaying vacuum models to have larger volumes per redshift interval than the standard frw models with the same @xmath81 .",
    "this feature is similar to the one found in `` quintessence '' and @xmath0cdm cosmologies and could be advantageous if the observational data indicate an excess count of high - redshift objects .",
    "the limits on the @xmath82 parameter obtained from all kinematic tests are shown in table 1 .",
    "0.1 in    at this point , it is also interesting to compare our results with previous studies of kinematic tests for @xmath7 cosmologies .",
    "observable expressions for a large class of flat decaying vacuum models were discussed by waga ( 1993 ) . in his paper , the time varying cosmological term was defined by @xmath110 , where @xmath111 , @xmath82 and @xmath20 are arbitrary constants .",
    "although rather different from the deflationary ansatz assumed here , we see that in the limit @xmath112 , our expression ( 5 ) reduces to @xmath113 , or equivalently , @xmath114 .",
    "therefore , by considering only the flat case ( @xmath11 ) and taking @xmath115 , the late stages of the deflationary cosmologies has exactly the same behavior of the models examined by waga .",
    "note also that our @xmath82 parameter must be identified with @xmath116 of that one appearing in his paper .",
    "more recently , some aspects involving the angular size , luminosity distance , and sne type ia observations in @xmath7 models were also investigated by vishwakarma ( 2000 , 2001 ) . by generalizing earlier papers ( chen and wu 1990 , carvalho et al .",
    "1992 ) , he considered the interesting ansatz @xmath117 , where @xmath118 is a dimensionless constant and @xmath119 is the density parameter of the fluid component .",
    "although proposed as a new cosmology , if we rewrite this @xmath7 in terms of the total energy density , this decaying law corresponds precisely to the late stages of the deflationary universes for @xmath120 .",
    "a more quantitative analysis accounting for angular sizes , the existence of old high redshifts galaxies , and ages constraints from globular clusters in this framework will be discussed in a forthcoming communication .",
    "we also remark that models driven by a gravitational adiabatic matter creation process ( calvo et al .",
    "1992 , lima and alcaniz 1999 , alcaniz and lima 1999 ) present some kinematic expressions , like the dimensionless radial coordinate , which are similar to the ones discussed here for @xmath7 cosmologies ( see appendix ) . in these models ,",
    "the present day matter creation rate , @xmath121 nucleons @xmath122 , is also nearly the same rate transferred from the decaying vacuum to the fluid component .",

    "the recent observational evidences for an accelerated state of the present universe , obtained from distant sne ia ( perlmutter et al .",
    "1999 , riess et al . 1998 ) gave a strong support to the search of alternative cosmologies .",
    "as demonstrated here , a variable @xmath0-term or a decaying vacuum energy density is also an ingredient accounting for this unexpected observational result . in the present paper",
    "we have analyzed all kinematic expressions for flat , closed , and open cosmologies when the decaying vacuum is a fraction of the total energy density . at the later stages of the evolution ,",
    "the rather slight changes introduced by @xmath7 , which is quantified by the @xmath82 parameter , provides a reasonable fit of several cosmological data .",
    "kinematic tests like luminosity distance , angular diameter and number - counts versus redshift relations constrain perceptively the decaying vacuum ( see table 1 ) . for models characterized by the pair ( @xmath129 ) , the age of the universe is always greater than the corresponding frw model ( @xmath51 ) , and even values bigger than @xmath130",
    "are allowed for all values of the curvature parameter .",
