    "disc accretion is an essential process for such phenomena as energetic x - ray sources , active galactic nuclei and protostars . since the early works by @xcite and @xcite , a great number of papers have been devoted to studies of the disc accretion onto gravitating objects . when the accretion rate is not too high , the accretion disc luminosity is directly in proportion to the accretion rate and can be successfully described by the standard thin disc model ( s - s model ) .",
    "sgr a * in our galactic centre has been extensively studied in the category of accretion processes because it is a supermassive black hole candidate in our galaxy and has unique observational features incompatible with the s - s model .",
    "one of the features of sgr a * is that the observed luminosity is five orders of magnitude lower than that predicted by the s - s model .",
    "moreover , the spectrum of sgr a * differs from the multi - temperature black body spectrum obtained from the s - s model .",
    "since the observational features of sgr a * can not be explained by the s - s model , two types of theoretical models , such as the spherical bondi accretion model without any net angular momentum @xcite and the advection - dominated accretion flow model ( adaf ) with high angular momentum @xcite , have been proposed ( narayan & mcclintock 2008 , yuan 2011 for review ) .",
    "both the bondi model and the adaf model result in highly advected flows and the radiative efficiency is so low as to be compatible with the observations .",
    "the spherically symmetric bondi model gave the first detailed model of sgr a * @xcite .",
    "this model applies when the circularization radius is smaller than the innermost stable circular orbit .",
    "the bondi model is frequently used to estimate the expected accretion rate near the bondi radius far from the gravitating object . however",
    ", the simple bondi model can not be extended close to the black hole to satisfy the details of the activity of sgr a*. in contrast with the bondi model , the adaf model applies when the angular momentum at the outer boundary is roughly keplerian , and a large fraction of the viscously generated heat is advected with the accreting gas and only a small fraction of the energy is radiated . unlike the cold standard disc",
    ", this model results in a high temperature , rapid accretion , sub - keplerian disc and inefficient radiation in the inner region of the disc .",
    "the adaf models were shown to be generally successful and more advanced models @xcite , taking into account the parametric description of the outflow and jet , explain well the observations .",
    "the important key to these models for sgr a * is the amount of angular momentum in the accretion flow .",
    "however , at present , we have no clear evidence for the angular momentum from observations .",
    "the low angular momentum model belongs to an intermediate case between the bondi model and the adaf model and was applied to sgr a * @xcite .",
    "assuming that the wolf - rayet star @xmath5 13 @xmath6 is the dominant source of the matter accreting onto sgr a * and assuming the wind temperature @xmath7 = 1.0 or 0.5 kev , they estimated the net angular momentum @xmath8 of 1.682.16 and the bernoulli constant @xmath9 of @xmath10@xmath11 , where the mass @xmath12 , the speed of light @xmath13 and the schwarzschild radius @xmath14 are used as the units of mass , velocity and distance . with these flow parameters for @xmath8 and @xmath9 , they showed analytically that there is no continuous flow solution which attains to the event horizon , and the resulting flow would be non - stationary , but that , for the case of the angular momentum @xmath8= 1.55 lower than the best estimates for sgr a * , there exists a standard stationary shock solution .",
    "subsequently , they speculated that , for the non - stationary flow , the inflowing matter accumulates and forms a ring or torus and that the ring in the inner region is unstable and may explain the variability of sgr a*. motivated by their suggestion and results , we examine the low angular momentum flow model for sgr a * using 2d hydrodynamical calculations and discuss the results on the activity of sgr a*.",
    "we consider a supermassive black hole with mass @xmath15 for sgr a*. for the accretion flow around sgr a * , we use the flow parameters @xmath8 and @xmath9 estimated by @xcite and the mass accretion rate @xmath16 yr@xmath3 in all models .",
    "1d flow solution of a thin , rotating , inviscid and adiabatic accretion flow near the equatorial plane generally depends on the flow model especially on its thickness , for example , the vertical equilibrium model or the constant height model . assuming the vertical equilibrium model here , we solve the bernoulli equation with the constant angular momentum @xmath8 , find the outer and inner sonic points and get the mach number versus radius relation , the sound speed @xmath17 , the thickness @xmath18 of the accretion flow , the radial velocity @xmath19 and the temperature @xmath20 at a given radius @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "it should be noticed that the configuration of the mach number versus radius does not coincide completely with that in @xcite because of the different flow model used .",
    "the mach number versus radius relations for @xmath22 and 2.16 are similar to theirs , that is , the flow which passes through the outer sonic point never continue to the event horizon .",
    "the flow for @xmath23 also shows a flow topology similar to that for @xmath24 , unlike the case of @xcite . the first purpose in this study is to examine how the flow with these specific angular momenta actually behaves .",
    "however , in addition to the above parameters , we examined another case of @xmath25 , for which the standing shock is predicted to exist in the inner region .",
    "figs  1 and 2 show the mach number versus radius in 1d adiabatic flow obtained for the cases of @xmath8 = 1.68 and @xmath9 = @xmath26 ( model a ) and @xmath8 = 1.35 and @xmath9 = @xmath27 ( model d ) , respectively . in fig .  1",
    ", the particle which passes through the outer sonic point a falls down supersonically inward but never attains the event horizon since it makes a closed loop of the mach number curve .",
    "on the other hand , in fig .  2 , the particle falls supersonically along the solid line ab , jumps at the shock position of @xmath28 from the point b to c in a subsonic state and tends supersonically toward the event horizon along the dashed line cd , where the mach number curve ( dashed line ) which passes through the inner sonic point intersects at the point c with the other mach number curve ac ( dotted line ) which passes through the outer sonic point and satisfies the rankine - hugoniot relation between the solid and the dashed lines . in fig .",
    "2 , there exist two shock positions ( @xmath29 17 and 19 ) .",
    "it is known that usually the inner shock of the two shocks is unstable but the outer one is stable @xcite .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     although in model b with the highest @xmath8 the shock is formed firstly around @xmath30 and moves gradually upstream , it finally disappears and a steady flow is attained . in model c with @xmath8",
    "smaller than model a , the flow features are similar to model a. but the shock oscillates between 4080 @xmath31 and the mass - outflow rate varies by a factor of 4 .",
    "model d differs from the other models because the initial flow of model d is based on the 1d adiabatic flow with stationary standing shocks .",
    "4 shows the time variations of @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 for model d. first , the shock is formed steadily at @xmath36 and it begins to move between 15 @xmath37 .",
    "the luminosity is modulated by several per cent but the mass - outflow rate varies by a factor of 7 although it is two orders of magnitude smaller than the input accretion rate .",
    "the mach number of the shock maintains itself at about @xmath38 and is stronger than those in models a and c , because the shock is formed closer to the black hole .",
    "we may wonder that the flow of model d shows non - stationary behaviours , because the initial flow of model d has been given from the adiabatic solution with the stationary standing shocks .",
    "so we examined this model under an adiabatic 2d condition and reconfirmed that the stationary shock is formed constantly at @xmath39 which is slightly smaller than the theoretical values of @xmath35 = 17 and 19 obtained from the 1d adiabatic solution . in model d , unlike the adiabatic case , we notice that the cooling and heating of the gas considerably influence the formation and position of the shock .     by the synchrotron and free - free emissions , mass - outflow rate @xmath33 , mass - inflow rate @xmath34 and shock position @xmath35 on the equatorial plane in model f.,width=325,height=249 ]    fig .",

    "since the flow is convectively unstable in the inner region of @xmath57 , @xmath58 is not correctly defined at @xmath57 according to the above definition .",
    "the non - stationary shock is found at a radius of @xmath59 .",

    "the density is also enhanced by a factor of three across the shock . in fig . 6 ,",
    "a single shock structure is found but we find two shock features at some phases .",
    "the accreting matter falls inward with a constant accretion rate until it attains the shock position and then it decreases ( see the scale on the right side of the figure ) after the gas passes through the shock .",

    ", we also find that the accreting mass flux @xmath55 becomes a little small in the post - shock region although it is almost constant until the gas reaches the shock .",
    "this is due to the effect of the mass - outflow in the post - shock region .",

    "the profiles in the pre - shock region are almost same as the initial one and the ratio @xmath71 is not so different from its initial ratio @xmath72 even in the post - shock region .",
    "this means that the steady values of the electron and ion temperatures and accordingly the intrinsic total emission of models e and f may not be still reached by the time integration over @xmath73 s. to obtain exact steady distribution of @xmath67 and @xmath66 , the time - independent differential equations for a stationary state should be solved instead of the method of the time - dependent calculation . in spite of this fact , from the result of the two - temperature model with the input accretion rate of @xmath74 yr@xmath3 , we can expect the total emission of @xmath4 erg s@xmath3 compatible with the observed one of sgr a * if the electron temperatures of @xmath75 ",

    "the velocity vectors in fig .",
    "10 are amplified by five times , compared with fig .",
    "the initial accreting matter at the outer boundary supersonically falls down towards the gravitating centre and is decelerated at the shock front , enhancing the density and the temperature and becomes subsonic .",
    "the post - shock region with high densities and high temperatures results in a strong outward pressure - gradient force also along the @xmath79-axis and a part of the accreting matter deviates from the disc flow and escapes as the wind flow .",
    "the wind velocity becomes @xmath80@xmath81 at the outer boundary except for a narrow funnel region along the @xmath79-axis , where the funnel wall is characterized by the vanishing of the effective potential and the flow velocity within the funnel region is relativistic at @xmath82 .",

    "while in models e and f it varies by a factor of 25 .",
    "the outflow consists of a persistent outflow and a large episodic one with irregular intervals of an hour to ten days and the episodic outflow rate is higher by a factor of 27 than the averaged mass - outflow rate .",
    "sgr a * possesses a quiescent state and a flare state .",
    "the flares of sgr a * have been detected in multiple wavebands from radio , sub - millimetre , ir to x - ray @xcite .",
    "the amplitudes of the variability at radio , ir and x - ray are by factors of below 1/2 , 15 and 45 or even higher , respectively , a few times per day .",
    "the rapid variability in the radio band on time - scales of a few seconds to hours has been observed @xcite .",
    "although a quasi - periodicity of @xmath83 20 minutes in the ir flares @xcite and radio qpos of 16 , 22 , 31 and 56 minutes @xcite have been reported , they are the subject of a controversy @xcite .",
    "these flare phenomena are interesting in relation to the time variations of the luminosity and the mass - outflow rate in the present models .",
    "we consider that the intermittently large modulations of the outflow due to the oscillatory shock may be related to the flares of sgr a*. unfortunately , the time resolution in our calculations is at most as small as a few minutes because of the limited time step in the calculations .",
    "therefore , the short time variability at a scale of @xmath84 10 minutes observed in sgr a * can not be compared with the result of our models .",
    "figs 11 and 12 show the power spectrum density of the total luminosity @xmath32 and mass - outflow rate @xmath33 and of the disc luminosity @xmath85 and shock radius @xmath35 on the equatorial plane , respectively , for model a , where the disc luminosity is defined at the surface of the inward flow with only negative radial velocities near the equatorial plane .",
    "here , we can not find a conspicuous frequency peak in these power spectra partly due to insufficient statistical power but they are suggestive of semi - regular variabilities on time - scales of hours to days .    the origin of the oscillating shock appearing in the present models is entirely attributed to the range of parameters of the specific energy and the specific angular momentum used here .",
    "generally , the shock formation and its position are very sensitive to the upstream flow parameters . the initial flow variables of the models , except for models d and f with @xmath86 , are based on the 1d adiabatic flow in which parameters @xmath8 never produce a stationary standing shock but are located just nearby in the range of parameters responsible for the stationary shock .",
    "furthermore , we know that the shock becomes unstable when we take account of the energy loss and gain of the gas @xcite .",
    "the present low angular momentum flow models are compared with the adaf model @xcite which is referred to as a radiatively inefficient accretion flow model of sgr a. the region considered here is limited to an inner region of @xmath87 .",
    "the adaf has generally the following properties : ( 1 ) the accretion flow becomes geometrically thick , ( 2 ) the pressure support in the radial direction is considerable , so the angular velocity is sub - keplerian , ( 3 ) the radial velocity of the gas is much larger than that of the standard disc model and is barely less than keplerian velocity in the innermost region , and ( 4 ) the large radial velocity and the large scale height cause the gas density to be very low , and so the cooling time is very long compared with the dynamical time and the matter is optically thin",
    ". these properties are also realized in the present low angular momentum flows .",
    "the adaf solution is gas - pressure dominated and the sound velocity is comparable to the keplerian velocity , so the gas temperature becomes nearly virial .",
    "gas at such a high temperature radiates copiously at small radii where the temperature can approach @xmath88 .",
    "thus , in the adaf model , a two - temperature plasma of the ion temperature @xmath66 and the electron temperature @xmath67 is assumed to exist at the small radii .",
    "typical adaf models have the two temperatures scaling as @xcite @xmath89 in our models a  d , the two - temperature model is not considered but a high temperature of @xmath90 k comparable to the above ion temperature is obtained in the innermost region . the temperature profile is roughly @xmath91 in all models , in agreement with the adaf . in the adaf with the constant accretion rate , a self - similar flow with the density profile of @xmath92",
    "gives @xmath93 , while our models show @xmath94@xmath95 .",
    "the radiative efficiency of the accretion flow in our model f is as small as @xmath0 in the usual adafs .",
    "thus , as far as the inner region of the accretion flow is concerned , the low angular momentum flow model has many properties in common with those of the adafs .",
    "the distinction between the adafs and the present low angular momentum flow is that the former describes a hot , nearly spherical , accretion flow with viscosity , while the latter shows the same accretion flow with lower angular momentum but without viscosity .",
    "the remarkable difference between our models and the adafs is the existence of the oscillating shock phenomena in the low angular momentum model , except for model b with a relatively larger angular momentum .",
    "the shock position @xmath35 is irregularly oscillatory in the inner region of @xmath96 .",
    "another distinctive point of our models is that the mass - outflow is considerable , depending on the specific angular momentum of the model , as mentioned in section 5.1 .",
    "@xmath97 @xmath98 of model f with @xmath99 erg s@xmath3 at @xmath100 s ( dashed line ) and with @xmath101 erg s@xmath3 @xmath102 s ( solid line),width=325,height=249 ]    .",

    "the sub - milimetre and x - ray bumps in these spectra are originated from the synchrotron cooling by thermal electrons and the bremsstrahlung cooling , respectively , whose formulas are prescribed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the intensities in the sub - milimetre bumps of models e and f are a little higher and the peak positions lie in a longer wavelength compared with the observational spectra at the quiescent state of sgr a*. to the contrary , the intensities in the x - ray band ( 28 kev ) are one orders of magnitude lower than the observed one .",
    "the radiatively inefficient accretion flow models @xcite , such as the adafs , take into account the complicated physics including synchrotron and inverse compton emission by thermal and non - thermal electrons under the two - temperature assumption and describe the energy spectra very fitted to the observed ones of sgr a * over a wide range of energy bands from the radio to x - ray . in this respect ,",
    "the present our model is too simple and insufficient to reproduce the spectra of sgr a * but it is useful to examine the basic scenario of the low angular momentum flow model .",

    "the models with the specific angular momenta @xmath8 of 1.35 , 1.55 , 1.68 , and 2.16 ( in the usual nondimensional units ) and input accretion rates of @xmath104 was considered .",
    "we summarize the results as follows .",
    "\\(2 ) the flow is highly advected and , if the syncrotron cooling and a two - temperature model are taken into account , the radiative efficiency of the accreting matter into radiation is very low , @xmath0@xmath1 , and the input accretion rate @xmath105 yr@xmath3 results in the total luminosity @xmath4 @xmath97 @xmath98 which is comparable to the observed luminosity of sgr a*.    \\(3 ) an irregularly oscillating shock is formed in the inner region of a few tens to a hundred and sixty schwarzschild radii , except for the model with the highest @xmath106 . due to the oscillating shock ,",

    "\\(5 ) the oscillaing shock is necessarily triggered if the specific angular momentum @xmath8 and the specific energy @xmath9 belong to or are located just nearby in the range of parameters responsible for a stationary shock in the rotating inviscid and adiabatic accretion flow .      since the specific angular momenta used in the models",
    "are reasonably estimated , the time variability of sgr a * may be attributed naturally to the oscillating shock in the low angular momentum model considered here .",
    "further evidence of the low angular momentum of the accretion flow around sgr a * would confirm the validity of the models . if the specific angular mommentum of the accretion flow around sgr a * is actually as small as @xmath86 , the time variability itself of the total emission like model f may explain the quiescent and the flare states of sgr a*. on the other hand , in the case of higher angular momentum i.e. @xmath24 , the time modulation of the total emission @xmath32 is small to explain the flare phenomena of sgr a*. however , under this circumstance , we expect that the large episodic wind caused by the non - stationary shock may induce the flare phenomena of sgr a*. the flare phenomena of sgr a * have been seen to be polarized in the radio , sub - millimetre and ir bands @xcite .",
    "this is a strong evidence for a magnetic field around sgr a*. the episodic wind in our model may be accelerated as a relativistic jet by some mechanism such as magnetic reconnection process in a current seet under the magnetic field away from the accretion flow @xcite .",
    "the jet will collide with the ambient matter and excite the matter as a hot emitter , especially at times of the episodic wind .",
    "the emission from the hot matter may be observed as the flares in x - ray .",
    "furthermore , the jet expands and cools in the far distant interstellar matter and results in the synchrotron emission due to the electrons in the magnetic field .",
    "this may be observed as the radio flares with a time lag from the x - ray flares .",
    "the existence of the magnetic field plays an important role in the accretion flow .",
    "however , the magnetic field was not taken into account simultaneously with the hydrodynamics in our models .",
    "thus , the current low angular momentum flow model is simple and can not reproduce the observed spectra of sgr a * , as is successfully fitted over a wide range of the wavelength by adafs . for a spectral fitting , we have to treat the physics of the synchrotron and inverse compton emission by the thermal and non - thermal electrons under the two - temperature model . a further magneto - hydrodynamical examination of the flow with a low angular momentum model including the above physics should be pursued in the future .",
