    "in condensed matter physics , the landau s theories of fermi liquid and spontaneous symmetry breaking have been the basic principles that account for vast phenomena . for instance",
    ", the ground state of the two - dimensional spin @xmath6 heisenberg model on a square lattice possesses long range nel order and the goldstone modes due to spontaneous spin - rotation symmetry breaking .",
    "people have been trying to look for more exotic states in spin systems for a long time .",
    "the seminal concept of resonating valence bond  ( rvb ) spin liquid state was first proposed by p. w. anderson @xcite .",
    "then , mostly due to its implication of the mechanism of the high temperature superconductivity @xcite , this field has been flourishing for more than two decades . as a new type of quantum matter ,",
    "the spin liquid state itself is intriguing since its properties have never been clarified before @xcite .",
    "various approaches have shown that quantum spin liquids may exist in two - dimensional ( @xmath7d ) @xmath8 @xmath9@xmath10 model and the heisenberg model on the kagom lattice . in these models ,",
    "the quantum spin liquids are accessed ( in principle ) by appropriate frustrating interactions @xcite . however , the nature of the quantum disordered ground state is still under debate .",
    "rvb spin liquid state obviously goes beyond the landau s theories , in which the quasiparticles of fermi liquid carry both spin and charge quantum numbers .",
    "another exciting field in searching for quantum exotic states beyond the landau s theory of spontaneous symmetry breaking is the quantum hall ( qh ) and fractional quantum hall ( fqh ) states . in these states",
    ", topological order plays an essential role @xcite . in the qh state , a quantized hall conductance was measured due to the formation of the landau levels of a @xmath7d electron gas at low temperatures and in strong magnetic field .",
    "one of the key features of qh effect is the existence of chiral edge states around the system boundaries .",
    "recently , involving both quantized spin hall effect kane , zhang and quantized anomalous hall effect @xcite , the topological insulator with gapless edge states has been one of the hot issues .",
    "the fundamental links between the above two fields have attracted much attention @xcite . in this work",
    ", we aim to contribute to these interesting topics .",
    "we study the spin @xmath0 bilinear - biquadratic model on square lattice , of which the hamiltonian is written as @xmath11 , \\label{hbb}\\]]where @xmath12 is a spin @xmath0 operator .",
    "its semiclassical version ( @xmath13 ) on a bipartitie lattice exhibits four ordered phases that are exactly divided by four su(@xmath14 ) symmetric points at the model parameters , @xmath15 chenhh , papanicolaou .",
    "they are phases with ferromagnetic ( fm ) , antiferromagnetic ( afm ) , ferroquadrupolar ( fq ) , and antiferroquadrupolar ( afq ) orders respectively . whether these classically well - understood phases are stable in the quantum case or how the quantum model behaves constitues the interesting topics of current researches . in one dimension ( @xmath0d ) , many aspects have been revealed by extensive exploration haldane , affleck , fath , fath2000,xiang1993,lauchli , schollwock , rommelse , kennedy , white1993,polizzi , murashima , gu .",
    "while in two dimensions ( @xmath7d ) , a complete understanding of the system is still being anticipated . on triangular lattice , many methods have revealed that the region @xmath16 exhibits an afq order tsunetsugu , lauchli2,li2007 . on the honeycomb lattice ,",
    "a tensor renormalization group method showed the afq order in the region @xmath17 is destroyed by pure quantum fluctuations and there is a transition from the plaquette order to the afm order @xcite .",
    "a recent work proposed that a three - sublattice order exists in the su(@xmath14 ) point @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "the quantum monte carlo simulation @xcite found the afm phase is stable in the region @xmath19 on a square lattice . while in the region of @xmath20",
    ", there lacks evidence on whether the afm order can survive or not .    in this paper",
    ", we show that a novel type of topological spin liquid might exist on a square lattice in the region @xmath2 , in which a topological edge state circulates around the boundary of the system .",
    "time - reversal symmetry is broken spontaneously for this non - trivial gapped spin liquid . in a fermion representation we found that the @xmath7d spin liquid can be described very well by the ( projected ) spinless @xmath3-wave pairing bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs)-type hamiltonian .",
    "we obtained the gapless dispersion of the edge modes . for a nonzero longitudinal momentum @xmath21 ,",
    "one edge mode splits into two half modes that can exist individually , which could be termed @xmath22(left ) and @xmath23(right ) chiral modes , respectively .",
    "while for @xmath5 , zero edge modes emerge , which turn out to be majorana fermion states kitaev , zhoubin2011 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section ii a brief introduction of the fermion representation is presented . in section iii the mean - field theory is introduced and the solutions of a gapped chiral spin liquid are obtained .",
    "then the corresponding edge state of a ribbon system is explored in section iv . and a summary is made in section v.",
    "firstly we introduce a fermion representation for quantum spin @xmath0 .",
    "each spin has three eigenstates @xmath24 of @xmath25 with the eigenvalues @xmath26 .",
    "we introduce three fermionic operators to generate three independent states ( @xmath27 ) , @xmath28 in terms of @xmath29 operators , the spin operators can be expressed as @xmath30to restore the hilbert space of spin 1 , the hard - core constraint at each site must be imposed,@xmath31 in this way the hamiltonian eq .",

    "it is remarkable that all dispersions for quasi - particles are three - fold degenerate at the mean field level .",
