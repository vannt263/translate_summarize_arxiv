    "protoplanetary nebulae ( ppne ) are transient objects between the asymptotic - giant - branch ( agb ) and planetary - nebula phases of stellar evolution .",
    "they are key objects for understanding the formation of planetary nebulae .",
    "though oh and h@xmath15o masers have been extensively searched for in late - agb stars and ppne ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) , relatively little work has been made in sio masers .",
    "observations of oh / ir stars and objects with cold envelopes were made in sio masers by @xcite , nyman et al .",
    "( 1986 , 1993 ) , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "it was found in these works that the detection rate of sio and h@xmath15o masers drops with an increase of the iras [ 2512 ] color , which is a temperature / evolutionary - stage indicator of the dust envelopes of late - type stars .",
    "though h@xmath15o and oh masers are often found in ppne , sio masers are rarely detected in these objects .",
    "the sio masers are emitted in circumstellar shells very close to the central star ( @xmath16 cm ) , and the oh masers are further away ( @xmath17 cm ) .",
    "therefore , when the mass loss terminates , the sio masers disappear first , whereas the oh masers remain active during the protoplanetary and early planetary - nebula stages ( @xcite ) .",
    "thus , only a few ppne with sio masers have been found in the past ; for example , oh 231.8 + 1.4 ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite newly found sio masers in such cold objects . in particular , iras 19312 + 1950 has a prominent bipolar nebulosity with a large angular size of more than 40@xmath18 on the 2mass near - infrared images .",
    "the object , iras 19312 + 1950 , is unusual in several respects .",
    "firstly , it appears to be oxygen - rich ( o - rich ) according to the detections of sio , h@xmath15o , and oh masers ( @xcite ) and the thermal line of so ( @xcite ) .",
    "but , in addition , the thermal line of h@xmath2cn was also detected toward this object ( @xcite ) .",
    "this molecule is normally considered to be an indicator of carbon - rich ( c - rich ) circumstellar chemistry under the equilibrium condition , though several exceptions have been found at the non - equilibrium ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "secondly , a doubly peaked profile was observed in the spectrum of the sio maser in the @xmath1910 , @xmath202 transition , and sio maser emission exhibits a strong time variation ( @xcite ) .",
    "the spectral features of oh masers are also quite unusual , exhibiting multiple spiky peaks around the systemic velocity ( b. m. lewis 2000 , private communication ) .",
    "this object has a cool dusty envelope ; the iras color , @xmath21 , indicates the presence of cool dust with a temperature of about 200 k around the central star .",
    "this iras color is at the boundary between agb and post - agb phases in the two - color diagram ( @xcite ) . though we postulated that this is a protoplanetary nebula , it is reasonable to think if this is a young stellar object with sio masers in a molecular cloud , like irc 2 in orion .",
    "in fact , @xcite discussed a double - peak sio maser profile of this object , which is relatively rare in agb stars , but is well known in ori irc 2 .",
    "however , based on the various observational facts that have been collected since the discovery , we believe that this is an evolved object .",
    "a discussion on this point will be given in section 3 of this paper and in a forthcoming paper .    because iras 19312 + 1950 has both prominent and unparalleled characteristics as a protoplanetary nebula",
    ", we decided to observe this object more carefully .",
    "this object may provides an important clue to solve a puzzle of mass ejection mechanism in a class of cool objects . in this paper",
    ", we report on the result of mapping observations in molecular lines of @xmath9co , @xmath2co , c@xmath3o , hcn , and cs , and in the 150 ghz continuum band using the nobeyama 45-m telescope .",
    "the spatial and kinematic structures of the dust / molecular envelope around the central star have been revealed .",
    "in addition , we made photometric and imaging observations in the near - infrared @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 bands .",
    "we also made molecular - line observations by the other lines , which clarify the special circumstellar chemistry of this object .",
    "a part of the circumstellar chemistry of this object will , however , be presented in another paper .",
    "mapping observations in the co @xmath0@xmath1 , @xmath2co @xmath0@xmath1 , c@xmath3o @xmath0@xmath1 , cs @xmath4@xmath5 , and hcn @xmath0@xmath1 lines were made with the 45-m telescope at nobeyama during 2001 february 49 .",
    "a cooled sis - mixer receiver with a bandwidth of about 0.5 ghz was used , and the system temperature ( including atmospheric noise ) was 300  500 k ( ssb ) , depending on the frequency and weather .",
    "the aperture efficiencies at 86 , 100 , and 110 ghz were 0.41 , 0.36 , and 0.31 , respectively . the main beam efficiencies at 86 , 100 , and 110 ghz were 0.49 , 0.45 , and 0.42 , respectively .",
    "the half - power full widths of the main beam were 19@xmath18.8 , 17@xmath18.1 , and 15@xmath18.6 at 86 , 100 , and 110 ghz , respectively .",
    "the antenna temperature ( @xmath22 ) given in the present paper was corrected for the atmospheric and telescope ohmic loss , but not for the beam or aperture efficiency .",
    "acousto  optical spectrometers with wide frequency coverage ( aos - w ) were used .",
    "the aos - w spectrometers have 250 mhz bandwidth and 2048 effective channels , the velocity coverage of about 800 km s@xmath10 and a spectral resolution of about 0.85 km s@xmath10 at 86 ghz .",
    "the rest frequencies of observing molecular lines were taken from @xcite . for an intensity calibration and a check of tuning frequencies , we observed molecular lines toward w51 ( e.g. , @xcite ) prior to the observations of iras 19312 + 1950 , and confirmed that the strong lines were surely detected toward this cloud .",
    "the telescope pointing was checked using a strong sio maser source , v1111 oph , and it was confirmed to be better than 3@xmath23 under windless conditions . mapping patterns for each line are summarized in table 1 .",
    "the bipolar axis of this nebula seen on the 2mass images is oriented approximately by 45@xmath24 from the north ( to the east ) .",

    ", we took images of standard stars near iras 19312 + 1950 .",
    "the data were reduced using the iraf data - reduction package by a standard way : dark frames were subtracted from raw data ; flat fielding was done with dome - flat frames and the magnitudes were measured by an aperture photometry technique using the digiphoto package in the iraf .",

    "we detected strong co emissions toward iras 19312 + 1950 .",
    "however , the 60@xmath18-grid 9-point cross mapping revealed that the emissions peaked at @xmath422733 and 43 km s@xmath10 are spatially extended more than a few arc minutes , indicating that these are from back / foreground molecular clouds . with the 15@xmath18 grid mapping",
    ", we found that the component at @xmath43 km s@xmath10 is sharply peaked in intensity at the iras position .",
    "the raw spectra indicate that the spectral features of back / foreground clouds are relatively homogeneous over the mapping regions .",
    "therefore , in order to obtain the spectra of the object , we averaged the spectra at the 22@xmath18 to 60@xmath18 offset positions surrounding the object , and made an average background spectrum .",
    "we then subtracted it from the original on - source spectra and obtained the ( supposedly ) background - free spectra .",
    "the same procedures were applied to all of the lines , though contamination by background emission was not so severe except in the cases of the co @xmath0@xmath1 and @xmath2co @xmath0@xmath1 .",
    "the fore / background components of the co @xmath0@xmath1 line were considerably flat and the intensity varies by only less than 10% in the 1@xmath28 away spectra . in the case of @xmath2co @xmath0@xmath1 , the background emission was not perfectly flat , so that the subtracted spectrum still exhibits emissions at @xmath4428 and 45 km s@xmath10 .",
    "figure 1 shows the raw spectra at the mapping center ( thin line ) , the average background spectra ( broken line ) , and the background - subtracted spectra at the mapping center ( bold line ) . in further analyses , we used the background - subtracted spectra to avoid the background contamination .",
    "all of the spectra exhibit a clear narrow feature with a width of about 23 km s@xmath10 ( hereafter narrow component ) around @xmath45 km s@xmath10 .",
    "the widths of the narrow components seem to vary among the molecular lines .",
    "for instance , the lines of @xmath9co , @xmath2co , and c@xmath3o have full widths at half maximum of about 3.0 , 2.3 , and 2.0 km s@xmath10 , respectively .    on the other hand ,",
    "the background - subtracted spectrum of @xmath9co ( solid line in top left panel of figure 1 ) exhibits a weak broad feature with a line width of about 40 km s@xmath10 .",
    "this was quite weak and difficult to distinguish from noise or background emission .",
    "however , in the top - left and right panels of figure 1 , we can clearly see emission at @xmath42 2025 and 4855 km s@xmath10 , which are significantly above the background emission ( broken curve ) .",
    "the presence of this component can be seen more clearly in the hco@xmath46 spectrum , which is free from background contamination ( @xcite ) .",
    "the broad component was also seen in the spectra of thermal lines of so and sio ( @xcite ) . in the case of hcn , we can also see a possible broad component , though it is not so clear because of the hyperfine splitting of the hcn @xmath0@xmath1 transition : @xmath471 , 21 , and 11 .",
    "the hyper fine lines should appear at @xmath48 and @xmath49 km s@xmath10 relative to the main @xmath33@xmath5 line ( 89.08792 ghz ) with an lte ( optically thin ) line intensity ratios of 1:5:3 ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in the bottom left panel of figure 1",

    "is taken along the bipolar axis of the nebula ; it is inclined by 45@xmath24 from the north .",
    "the background emission was subtracted in these maps . for making these maps ,",
    "the data taken on different days ( with different mapping patterns ) were combined , because the wind often prevented us to continue mappings ( of course , the data taken under the wind speed more than 10 m s@xmath10 were discarded ) . in the cases of the @xmath9co and hcn lines , we made two separate maps : one for the broad and another for the narrow components .",
    "we took the emission in the radial velocity ranges from 0 to 30 km s@xmath10 and from 50 to 60 km s@xmath10 for the broad component of the @xmath9co spectrum , and from 0 to 25 km s@xmath10 , and from 45 to 60 km s@xmath10 for the broad component of the hcn .",
    "the velocity ranges of the broad component in the hcn spectrum were chosen by eye inspection .",
    "the other lines ( except for @xmath9co and hcn ) do not exhibit the broad feature ; maps were made only for the narrow components .",
    "a remarkable point in figure 2 is that all of the intensity peaks of the narrow and broad components of molecules coincide with the iras position of iras 19312 + 1950 .",
    "we do not find any differences in the peak position between the narrow and broad components , or between different molecular lines .",
    "the object seems to be slightly resolved by the 15@xmath18 beam .",
    "the directions of the elongation seem to be different between molecular lines ; the narrow components of the @xmath9co and hcn spectra are somewhat elongated along the @xmath51-direction ; the @xmath2co and c@xmath3o spectra are elongate along the @xmath50-direction ; the broad component of the @xmath9co spectrum .    in order to evaluate the size of the source more carefully , we computed the model intensity variations and compared these with the observations .",
    "figures 3a and 3b show position vs. integrated - intensity plots along the x and y directions for each line .",
    "the intensities expected from simple homogeneous circular - disk models with radii of 0@xmath18 ( point source ) , 10@xmath18 , 20@xmath18 , and 30@xmath18 are drawn in solid and broken curves alternatively .",
    "the horizontal and vertical tick marks indicate the uncertainty in telescope pointing and the rms of integrated intensities , respectively . in figure 3a",
    ", we can see that the extension of the narrow component of @xmath9co is clearly larger than that of the broad component . however , this phenomenon is not so clear in the case of hcn .",
    "it seems that the narrow components of all of the lines , except for that of hcn , extend to more than 15@xmath18 according to the simple homogeneous disk model .",
    "figures 4a and 4b show position  velocity ( pv ) diagrams for each molecular line ( background subtracted ) .",
    "no particular spatial velocity gradient was seen in the @xmath9co and cs .",
    "the narrow components ( @xmath36 3536 km s@xmath10 ) of @xmath2co , c@xmath3o , and hcn exhibit a small velocity gradient along the @xmath51-axis ( @xmath52 km s@xmath10 arcsec@xmath10 ) that is perpendicular to the bipolar axis . even though the background emission was not completely homogeneous , the intensities of the background clouds at around 30 and 45 km s@xmath10 remained to be small compared with the narrow components , especially in the @xmath9co , @xmath2co , and c@xmath3o lines .",
    "figure 5 shows the 150 ghz continuum map toward iras 19312 + 1950 .",

    "the image size is @xmath54 .",
    "the 150 ghz continuum emission seems to extend to the north ",
    "east along the bipolar axis .",
    "the peak flux density of the 150 ghz continuum radiation was @xmath55 jy per beam .",
    "the total integrated flux density of the source integrated over the inner 25@xmath18 was 0.07 jy ( @xmath56 jy ) .",
    "the near - infrared image shows that the number density of bright stars is less at the northeast part of the object than at the southwest part , suggesting that the dust hides background stars more in the northeast part of the object .",
    "the magnitudes of the central star ( excluding the ring - like elongated component ) are 10.7 , 7.8 and 6.3 mag ( uncertainty : @xmath57 mag ) in the @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8-bands , respectively .",
    "figure 6 shows the spectral energy distribution ( hereafter sed ) of iras 19312 + 1950 .",
    "black body curves are also drawn .",
    "the flux densities of 12 , 25 60 , and 100 @xmath12 m were taken from the iras point source catalog .",
    "this sed shows a flat ( or moderate double peak ) shape .",
    "an excess can be seen between 60 and 100 @xmath12 m .",
    "these two data points were fit by the blackbody curve of the temperature of 70 k. in the galactic plane , interstellar dust in background molecular clouds occasionally emits far - infrared radiation .",
    "therefore , this excess may possibly be caused by interstellar contamination .",
    "however , the iras mid- and far - infrared maps with about 1@xmath58 resolution show a clear intensity peak at the iras position of iras 19312 + 1950 .",
    "this fact suggests that most of the energy of radiation in the 60 and 100 @xmath12 m bands originates from the central source of iras 19312 + 1950 .",
    "because molecular species observed toward this source are somewhat similar to the molecules detected in dark clouds ( for example , in l 134n ; @xcite ) , it is reasonable to doubt if this star is a young stellar object with sio masers as irc 2 in orion .",
    "however , we think that this is not the case for iras 19312 + 1950 .",
    "note that many molecular lines have also been detected in the protoplanetary nebula , oh 231.8 + 4.2 ( @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , agb maser stars have occasionally been found in / toward molecular clouds ( @xcite )    firstly , this object exhibits deep 2.3 @xmath12 m co first - overtone absorption bands corresponding to late m iii ( p. r. wood 2002 , private communication ) .",
    "most of low - mass young stellar objects exhibit emission or weak absorption of the 2.3 @xmath12 m co overtone bands ; this fact is very often used to separate ysos and agb stars ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",

    "moreover , we can not find any star forming activities on the infrared images down to @xmath59 mag ( note that interstellar extinction at @xmath8 band in this region is about 2 mag at most , which is estimated in subsection 3.2 ) . the closest iras source ( iras 19309 + 1947 ) is located 5@xmath28 south - west .",

    "these objects are located too far ( @xmath61 3  7 pc at the distance of 2.5 kpc ) to be considered as a cluster of star - forming activities associated with iras 19312 + 1950 .",
    "they are probably fore / background objects .    because both of above two reasonings are still not completely crucial as evidence of an evolved star",
    ", we do not preclude the possibility of a young stellar object here .",
    "however , because of the absorption feature of co overtone bands , the central star of iras 19312 + 1950 can not be a low - luminosity young stellar object .",
    "if we consider a high - luminosity ( @xmath62 ) young stellar object , the distance and physical conditions must be somewhat similar to those of agb / post - agb stars .",

    "we can estimate the distance to the source from the sed of this object , applying an interstellar extinction law at each wavelength ( for example , see @xcite ) .",
    "however , the distance depends strongly on the amount of total extinction toward this particular object .",
    "the extinction of the co fore / background cloud at @xmath63  33 km s@xmath10 is estimated to be @xmath64 from the co integrated intensity ( 24.7 km s@xmath10 ; for conversion factor , see @xcite ) .",
    "if this value is used for the extinction assuming that this is a foreground cloud , we obtain the distance of 2.5 kpc from the absolute luminosity of the object , 8000 @xmath65 , which is typical for agb stars . the bolometric correction to the iras 12 @xmath12 m flux density ( @xcite )",

    "if we consider that the @xmath63  33 km s@xmath10 component cloud is behind the object ( though this is unlikely ) and apply the standard interstellar extinction ( for example , see @xcite ) , we obtain the distance of 3.9 kpc .",
    "the distance varies from 5.1 to 3.3 kpc , when all of the 60 and 100 @xmath12 m flux densities come from the source , or nothing comes , respectively .",
    "the luminosity of the central star of ppne is known to be larger than the assumed value , 8000 l@xmath67 .",
    "in such a case , the distance varies in proportion to the square root of the luminosity . on the other hand",
    ", the distance would be slightly smaller than the above value if we take into account the self - absorption due to dust in the narrow - component cloud .",
    "therefore , we estimated that the distance ranges from 2.0 kpc to 5.1 kpc for this object .",
    "if we compare this with oh 231.8 + 4.2 ( at the distance of 1.3 kpc ; @xcite ) , iras 19312 + 1950 is still a bit a distant object , though the iras flux densities at middle infrared wavelengths are similar for both objects .    for simplicity , we assume in this paper that the distance to the object is 2.5 kpc , and estimate various quantities .      in the background - subtracted spectrum of @xmath9co ( top two panels of figure 1 ) ,",
    "a broad component is seen in the velocity range @xmath68 10  60 km s@xmath10 .",

    ", it is difficult to measure the accurate full line width of this weak component .",
    "the full width at zero maximum is estimated to be about 50 km s@xmath10 , suggesting a typical expanding velocity of the envelope of 25 km s@xmath10 .",
    "in addition , the velocity range of sio maser emission , which is found in @xmath422055 km s@xmath10 ( @xcite ) , is overlapped with the radial velocity of the co broad component .",
    "moreover , the intensity map of the broad component ( see top left panel of figure 2 ) shows a clear intensity peak at the center position of this object .",
    "these facts strongly suggest that the broad component is physically associated with the central star . from the co line intensity ( and the intensities of other molecular lines ) , the mass loss rate can be calculated with the lvg model ( for example , see @xcite ) .",
    "the best - fit value of the mass loss rate was calculated to be @xmath69 yr@xmath10 .",

    "the width of the narrow component is about 3 km s@xmath10 ; this is nearly the same for all of the lines of @xmath9co , @xmath2co , hcn , and cs . on the other hand",
    "the widths of the narrow components of less abundant species ( such as hco@xmath46 , etc . ) are dependent on molecular species ( @xcite ) .",
    "this fact suggests that these molecular lines are formed in a turbulent molecular cloud ( e.g. , @xcite ) ; the line width depends on the optical depth of the line in such a cloud .",
    "the narrow component emission may come from some cool component toward this object , for example , a dark cloud at fore / background of this source .",
    "we can estimate a column density of h@xmath15 from the co line intensity when we assume that the narrow component of co comes from a dark cloud . adopting the co ",
    "h@xmath15 conversion ratio of @xmath70 /(k",
    "km s@xmath10 ) ( @xcite ) , we obtained a h@xmath15 column density of @xmath71 @xmath72 from the present observation [ @xmath73(@xmath9co)=3.9 k , hpfw=2.9 km s@xmath10 , and the telescope beam efficiency of 0.48 ] .",
    "the total mass of h@xmath15 within the 16@xmath18 telescope beam ( assuming the distance of 2.5 kpc ) is calculated to be 2.8 @xmath14 .",
    "alternatively , from the column - density estimate using optically thin c@xmath3o line ( for example , see @xcite ) , we obtain the mass of about 9.7 @xmath14 for the cloud within the 16@xmath18 telescope beam .",
    "the mass estimates using co lines are considered to be uncertain by a factor of few , depending on the isotopic abundance ratio .    in the p ",
    "v diagram ( figures 4a and 4b ) , the narrow components of @xmath2co and c@xmath3o exhibit a small velocity gradient along the direction perpendicular to the bipolar axis .",
    "we estimated the mass of the source based on this velocity gradient , assuming the keplerian rotation of the narrow component , 0.5 km s@xmath10 at an inner radius of @xmath74 cm ( 5@xmath18 ) .",
    "then , we obtained about 3.5 m@xmath67 as a mass of the object inside the radius of 7@xmath18 .",
    "in fact , an inclination of the ring structure [ which is seen with the subaru and uh88 telescopes ( m. tamura 2001 , private communication ) ] is estimated to be @xmath75 . in this case",
    "the mass would increase by a factor of 1.2 .",
    "we detected continuum emission at a level of 0.07 jy at 150 ghz .",
    "this emission is considered to be radiation emitted by dust grains toward this object .",
    "we first estimate the mass of the cloud from a simple homogeneous - cloud model ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "when we assume @xmath76 10 k and a distance of 2.5 kpc , we obtain the optical depth of the dust to be @xmath77 at 150 ghz within the telescope beam . adopting a mass - absorption coefficient ( @xmath78 ) of @xmath79 @xmath80 g@xmath10 ( including both gas and dust particles )",
    ", we obtain 140 @xmath14 for the total mass of the dust cloud within the telescope beam .",
    "this value is inconsistent with the mass estimated from the co narrow component , suggesting that the 150 ghz continuum emission does not come from the cold dark cloud .    because the dust emissivity increases with the temperature of the grain",
    ", it is possible that the dust temperature is much higher than 10 k. in fact , the far infrared spectrum in figure 6 can be fit by a blackbody with @xmath81=70 k or higher .",
    "the dust temperature of an expanding envelope of a mass - losing star is higher near to the central star and decreases with the radius .",
    "@xcite calculated the continuum flux densities of stars with various mass - loss rates , and found that the model flux densities fit well with the observed spectra . their model for oh 231.8 + 1.4 with a mass - loss rate @xmath82 yr@xmath10 gave @xmath83 jy at a distance of 1.3 kpc .",
    "if the same model is applied to iras 19312 + 1950 , the flux density at 150 ghz is to be 0.1 jy at the distance of 2.5 kpc .",
    "this value is roughly consistent with the continuum flux density that was obtained in the present paper . in this model , the total mass of the gas in the envelope within the radius of @xmath84 cm ( 25@xmath18 )",
    "is computed to be about 0.1 @xmath14 ( corresponding to the broad component ) .",
    "the dust is also responsible for the nebulosity seen on the near - infrared images , which is made by scattering the light from the central star .",
    "we can estimate the amount of dust grains by assuming that the dust optical depth at the @xmath8 band is about unity in the envelope of this star . in this case , a simple estimate of the mass of the the ring structure , which is present at the radius of 5@xmath18 , gives 0.9 @xmath14 . here",
    ", we assumed a 1@xmath18-thickness spherical dust shell and the standard gas - dust ratio .    from these estimates of the masses in this and previous sections , and from the fact that the observed velocity of the narrow component ( @xmath363537 km s@xmath10 ) coincides well with the center velocity of the broad components , we conclude that the cloud responsible for the narrow component is not physically independent from the central star .",
    "rather , we are compelled to consider that the narrow component cloud of a few solar mass is a part of the object .",
    "in general , ppne are expected to have the following observational characteristics ( e.g. , @xcite ) ; ( 1 ) strong infrared excess that is due to circumstellar matter ; ( 2 ) the effective temperature of the central star between f and g types , ( 3 ) the presence of a detached dust shell due to the termination of an agb - phase mass loss , which gives a doubly peaked spectral energy distribution ; ( 4 ) the nebulosity seen in scattered light and no line emission of highly ionized atoms .    iras",
    "19312 + 1950 shares the first and the forth properties . it exhibits a red iras color [ @xmath21 ] and shows a clear intensity peak at the iras position in the @xmath9co intensity map .",
    "the b@xmath41 narrow - band imaging with the anu 2.3-m telescope resulted no evidence of ionized gas . at mid - infrared wavelengths ,",
    "no line emission feature was recognized in the iras low - resolution spectrum ( except a probable noise at 17.8 @xmath12 m ; @xcite ) . on the other hand",
    ", we should be careful in characteristics ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) .",
    "effective temperatures of stars between agb and pn phases are 5000  7000 k , which correspond with the surface temperatures of f- or g - type stars . in many cases",
    ", the central stars can be observable at optical wavelengths .",
    "a quite faint counterpart is recognizable at the position of the central star in the phase ii dss image in r - band , but the star image is too faint to judge the spectral type .",
    "one explanation of this discrepancy in the characteristics is that iras 19312 + 1950 suffers a large interstellar extinction of @xmath8616 as estimated in subsection 3.2",
    ". the spectral energy distribution does not show clear single nor double peaks .",
    "however , if the interstellar extinction ( @xmath87 ) is corrected , the fluxes at 0.9  2.2 @xmath12 m are increased by a factor of 30  7 , respectively .",
    "therefore , the spectrum seems to be doubly peaked .",
    "the @xmath6- , @xmath7- , and @xmath8- band intensities are well fit by a blackbody with @xmath88 k when the extinction of @xmath87 is corrected .",
    "the flux densities at 12 and 25 @xmath12 m are well fit by a blackbody with @xmath89 k , which is a temperature reasonable for the dust shell at medium radii in the envelope ( @xcite ) .",
    "these properties also suggest that iras 19312 + 1950 is a very young protoplanetary nebula .",
    "progenitors of o - rich protoplanetary nebulae are inferred to be relatively massive stars ( @xmath90 4 @xmath14 ) . according to the evolutionary scenario at the agb phase ,",
    "the stars with masses below @xmath36 4 @xmath91 ends up as a c - rich star by the he - burning at the core and succeeding dredge - up .",
    "however , in stars above that , the created @xmath9c atoms are further fused by the hot bottom burning ( hbb : @xcite ; @xcite ) at the late - agb phase and the massive stars remain to be o - rich throughout the agb phase with experiencing no ( or a very short ) c - rich era ( @xcite ) . therefore , the mass of the progenitor of iras 19312 + 1950 ( o - rich ) is estimated to be relatively large .",
    "recently , @xcite suggested that stars with a relatively large initial masses ( @xmath36 3.8 @xmath14 ) first go through a short ( @xmath92 30000 yr ) j - type ( @xmath2c - enhanced ) carbon star era before the hot bottom burning converts them back into oxygen - rich stars , and ends back again as c - rich stars .",
    "the estimated mass of the central star of iras 19312 + 1950 is somewhat too large to experience this evolutionary scenario .",
    "the coincidence of the masses , about a few @xmath14 , which were calculated for the dust shell and the co narrow component in the previous sections , even suggests us another idea that iras 19312 + 1950 is the agb object embedded in a small globule - like cloud .",
    "the near - infrared radiation emitted by the central star can illuminate the dusty cloud having a mass of about a few @xmath14 . in this case",
    ", the cloud can not be a cradle of the agb progenitor because the mass of the progenitor is comparable with this cloud .",
    "only one possible case would be the agb star colliding with the cloud ( for example , a cometary cloud ; see @xcite ] .",
    "even in such situation , the relative velocity between the cloud ( the narrow component ) and the agb star ( the broad component ) is so small ( @xmath93 km s@xmath10 ) that it is unlikely for such event to occur often .",
    "the line profiles of co with broad and narrow features have been found in many stars ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "these features are interpretated by multiple winds or keplerian disk ( @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , it is possible to consider that the narrow - component cloud in iras 19312 + 1950 is material trapped in an orbiting molecular reservoir ( @xcite ) .",
    "it has been suggested that the origin of bipolar nebulae is a binary system [ @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ] .",
    "however , in this case , it also seems difficult to keep the ejected material of a few solar masses moving around the central star ; precise modeling of this object is necessary .",
    "because the trapped material ( supposedly the ring structure ) is located considerably far ( 5@xmath18 ) from the central star , the secondary star must be located also at the similar distance . however , we find no evidence for the other late - type star at such distances .",
    "rather , it is possible that the counter part is evolved quickly to a white dwarf , and remnant of the ejected material still circles around the binary system , as suggested for the silicate carbon stars , etc .",
    "( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the existence of a hot secondary companion , however , enables us to make models explaining the complex chemistry of iras 19312 + 1950 .    with these arguments ,",
    "we think at present that iras 19312 + 1950 is likely to be at an early stage of protoplanetary nebula . however , the origin of the narrow component is still a puzzle .",
    "the chemistry of this component is quite similar to that of dark clouds ( @xcite ) , rather than that of protoplanetary nebula ( @xcite ) , though the dust temperature seems too high ( @xmath6170 k ) .",
    "they may be a remnant of material , that is ejected in the agb phase from the central star and is trapped by a distant binary counterpart .",
    "alternatively , a more drastic hypothesis may be a remnant of star forming material left after an encounter with a molecular cloud .",
    "more discussions on these points will be given in the future .",
    "we made the mapping observations of iras 19312 + 1950 in molecular lines of co @xmath0@xmath1 , @xmath2co @xmath0@xmath1 , c@xmath3o @xmath0@xmath1 , cs @xmath4@xmath5 , and hcn @xmath0@xmath1 lines and in the 150 ghz continuum .",
    "we also made photometric observations in the @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 bands to obtain the spectral energy distribution of iras 19312 + 1950 .",
    "the main results are as follows :    * the line profile of @xmath9co ( and possibly hcn ) exhibits weak broad ( @xmath94 km s@xmath10 ) and strong narrow ( @xmath95 km s@xmath10 ) components , whereas the profiles of the other lines ( @xmath2co @xmath0@xmath1 , c@xmath3o @xmath0@xmath1 , cs @xmath4@xmath5 ) exhibit only narrow components .",
    "both of the components show a clear intensity peak at the iras position of iras 19312 + 1950 . *",
    "the narrow component spatially extends at least more than 15@xmath23 . *",
    "the spectral energy distribution of iras 19312 + 1950 exhibits a moderate double - peak profile ( if extinction is corrected ) at the near- and mid - infrared wavelengths with excess at 60 and 100 @xmath12 m .",
    "based on the present observational results , we suggested that iras 19312 + 1950 is a transient object between the agb and planetary nebula phases , possibly a protoplanetary nebula . though the present observations do not completely exclude the possibility that this object is a young stellar object , evidence of an evolved object is accumulating furthermore with mm - wave interferometric observations .",
    "the authors thank staff of nobeyama radio observatory for the help of observations .",
    "they also acknowledge peter wood for the help in the near infrared observations at the siding spring observatory and providing them the near - infrared spectrum of this object .",
