    "all @xmath0-ray agns are identified as flat - spectrum radio sources .",
    "the third catalog of high - energy @xmath0-ray sources detected by the energetic gamma ray experiment telescope ( egret ) on the compton gamma ray observatory ( cgro ) includes 66 high - confidence identifications of blazars and 27 lower confidence potential blazar identifications @xcite .",
    "this offers a good sample for the explorations on the radiative mechanisms of @xmath0-rays from agns .",
    "the violent variations in very short time - scales imply that the @xmath0-ray emission is closely related with the relativistic jets in blazars .",
    "there are two kinds of models , namely , leptonic models and hadronic models , proposed for @xmath0-ray emission in blazars ( see mukherjee 2001 for a review ) . according to the different origins of the soft photons , the leptonic models can be classified as two groups : synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) models and erc models ( see sikora @xmath7 madejski 2001 for a review ) .    in the frame of ssc models ,",
    "the synchrotron photons are both produced and compton up - scattered by the same population of relativistic electrons in the jets of @xmath0-ray blazars .",
    "the synchrotron radiation is responsible for the low energy component in radio bands , and the synchrotron photons are compton up - scattered to @xmath0-ray photons by the same population of relativistic electrons in the jets @xcite .",
    "however , ssc models meet difficulties with the observed rapidly variable fluxes in mev - gev for some blazars .",
    "it has been realized that the processes other than ssc may occur at least in some @xmath0-ray blazars .",
    "one possibility is soft seed photons being from the external radiation fields outside the jets , namely , erc models .",
    "the origins of soft seed photons may include the cosmic microwave background radiation , the radiation of the accretion disk ( including photons from the disk scattered by surrounding gas and dust ) , infrared emission from the dust or / and a putative molecular torus , and broad - line regions , etc @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite proposed that the external radiation is from the blrs for gev @xmath0-ray blazars with flat @xmath0-ray spectra , while the near - ir radiation from the hot dust is responsible for mev @xmath0-ray blazars with steep @xmath0-ray spectra . in their model ,",
    "the electrons are assumed to be accelerated via a two - step process and their injection function takes the form of a double power law with a break at the energy that divides the regimes for two different electron acceleration mechanisms .",
    "the doppler boosting factor @xmath3 of the jets is a crucial quantity in studying the physical processes at work in the regions near the massive black holes in agns .",
    "several different approaches are proposed to estimate the doppler factors @xmath3 of the jets in agns .",
    "@xcite derived the synchrotron self - compton doppler factor @xmath8 of the jets in agns from the vlbi core sizes and fluxes , and x - ray fluxes , on the assumption of the x - ray emission being produced by the ssc processes in the jets .",
    "@xcite assumed energy equipartition between the particles and the magnetic fields in the jet components , and derived the equipartition doppler factor @xmath9 .",
    "more recently , the variability doppler factor @xmath10 is derived on the assumption that the associated variability brightness temperature of total radio flux density flares are caused by the relativistic jets @xcite .    in this paper , we use broad - line and @xmath0-ray emission data to derive the doppler boosting factors @xmath11 for a sample of @xmath0-ray blazars in the frame of the erc model .",
    "the cosmological parameters @xmath12=75 km s@xmath13mpc@xmath13 and @xmath14=0.5 have been adopted in this work .",
    "in this work , we calculate the power of @xmath0-ray emission from blazars by the external compton processes mainly following the calculations of @xcite . we then extend it to the case of the soft seed photons being from the blrs of the blazars .    assuming that blobs are moving with a constant velocity at an angle @xmath15=cos @xmath16 with respect to the line of sight , we have the inverse compton scattered @xmath0-ray flux density @xmath17 @xcite : @xmath18 where @xmath11 is the doppler factor , @xmath19 is the @xmath0-ray photon energy spectral index , @xmath20 is the cosmological redshift , @xmath21 is the energy density of the soft seed photons in the blob s frame in units of ergs @xmath22 , @xmath23 is the luminosity distance , @xmath24 is the dimensionless monochromatic mean soft photon energy in units of the electron rest mass energy , @xmath25 is the number density of electron in the blob , @xmath26 is the volume of the blob , and @xmath27 is the thomson cross section .",
    "an optically thin , homogenous spherical blob is assumed to be located very near the central black hole , so most of the soft seed photons from the blrs only experience one or a few inverse compton scatters in the blob . the total cross section @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the radius of the blob . for the homogenous spherical blob , we have @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the optical depth of the blob .",
    "as we do not know the value of the electron density @xmath25 in the blob , the parameter @xmath32 , which is required @xmath33 , is adopted to describe the optical depth of the blob in our calculations .    for @xmath0-ray blazars ,",
    "the jets are believed to move in the direction very close to the line of sight , so @xmath34 is taken and eq .",
    "( 1 ) becomes @xmath35 the soft seed photons are assumed to be from the different line emission .",
    "the observed @xmath0-ray flux density is the sum of inverse compton scattered flux densities contributed by different emission lines : @xmath36      the size of the blob can be estimated from the observed @xmath0-ray variability time - scale .",
    "@xcite derived the size of the blobs @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) from the time - scale for substantial @xmath0-ray variations of 3c279 , if a @xmath39 black hole is present in 3c279 .",
    "@xcite derived the upper limit on the blob - to - disc distance from the observed variability timescale @xmath40 of the @xmath0-ray fluxes .",
    "as the timescale @xmath41 , the radii of the blobs are around @xmath42 cm . as the typical variable timescale , @xmath43 day",
    ", we can infer the radii of the blobs are @xmath44 cm if the doppler factor @xmath45 is adopted . for typical radio - loud quasars having masses of black holes around @xmath46 ,",
    "so the radii @xmath29 of the blobs are around @xmath47 .",
    "@xcite employed the erc model to explain @xmath0-ray emission from the blazars .",
    "the comparisons of their model with the observed spectrum of 3c273 give the radius of the blob @xmath48 cm .",
    "the central black hole mass of 3c273 is around @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "thus , we get @xmath50 for the blob in 3c273 . in this paper , we take @xmath51 in our calculations .",
    "the observed flux of the broad emission line is @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the luminosity of a single broad emission line .",
    "the energy density of this emission line in the blob is given by @xmath54 where @xmath21 is monochromatic seed photon energy density of the broad line in the blobs and @xmath55 is the radius of the blr . the total soft seed photon energy density @xmath56 is the sum of all emission lines",
    "( 5 ) is only valid for the blob near the central black hole . at further distance away from the central black hole ,",
    "the energy density of blr photons in the blob is anisotropic and can be treated analogously to the approach for the dust torus @xcite . in this paper , however , we only consider the case of the blob being located near the central black hole .",
    "based on the long - time observations of 17 nearby seyfert 1 galaxies and 17 palomar - green quasars , @xcite found an empirical relation between the size of the blr @xmath1 of h@xmath57 and the monochromatic continuum luminosity at 5100 @xmath58 : @xmath59    @xcite suggested that mgii is a low - ionization line as h@xmath57 , so that mgii is expected to be produced in the same region as h@xmath57 .",
    "for a sample of 22 objects , they found a correlation between the fwhm of mgii and h@xmath57 : @xmath60 .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to expect that mgii and h@xmath57 are produced in the same region . using the same sample and the size of the blr derived by @xcite",
    ", they obtained a correlation between @xmath1 and the monochromatic continuum luminosity at 3000 @xmath61 : @xmath62 which has been corrected to the cosmological parameters used in this paper .",
    "@xcite suggested a relation between the black hole mass @xmath63 and the monochromatic continuum luminosity at 1350 @xmath61 .",
    "the black hole mass @xmath63 is the central black hole mass based on the calibration of the single - epoch uv spectral measurements .",
    "they derived @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the full width at half - maximum of the line civ .",
    "the relation between @xmath1 and the monochromatic continuum luminosity at 1350 @xmath61 is therefore available : @xmath66    now , we can derive the sizes of broad emission lines h@xmath57 , mgii , and civ from the optical or uv continuum luminosity by using the empirical relations ( 6 ) , ( 7 ) and ( 9 ) , respectively .",
    "we can estimate the central black hole masses of agns on the assumption that the motions of the gases in blrs are virilized from the width of the emission line , if the size of the blr is available .",

    ", we can obtain the lower limit of @xmath11 , if @xmath70 is adopted .",
    "we search the literature and collect all available data of broad emission lines of @xmath0-ray agns in egret catalog iii .",
    "the selection criterion is that the sources of which the fwhm of at least one of the following broad emission lines h@xmath57 , mgii and civ and the fluxes are available .",
    "this leads to 36 sources , of which 30 sources are the high - confidence identification blazars and 6 sources are the lower confidence potential blazar identifications listed in @xcite . for the source 0954@xmath71658 ,",
    "only the fwhm and the flux of the broad line h@xmath19 are available .",
    "we estimate the blr size of h@xmath19 using the empirical relation @xmath72 proposed by @xcite .    in principle , all broad emission line fluxes are needed to calculate the total soft seed photon energy in the blobs contributed by different broad emission lines . usually , the fluxes of only one or several broad emission lines are available for most sources in our sample due to the restriction of redshift . in our calculations , we consider fluxes for the following lines : h@xmath57 , mgii , civ , ciii , ly@xmath19 and h@xmath19 , which contribute about 60 per cent of the total broad line emission .",
    "we use the line ratios presented by @xcite , in which the relative strength of ly@xmath19 is taken as 100 , to calculate the total broad line emissions .",
    "@xcite added the contribution from the flux of h@xmath19 @xmath73 , with a value of 77 .",
    "this gives a total relative flux @xmath74 ( narrow lines are not included ) .",
    "for the lines h@xmath57 , mgii and civ , we use eq .",
    "( 6 ) , ( 7 ) and ( 9 ) to estimate their radii of the blrs .",
    "for other lines of which the fwhm is available , we compare their fwhm with that of any one of those three lines h@xmath57 , mgii and civ to estimate the radii of the blrs .",
    "we use eq .",
    "( 5 ) to calculate the soft photon energy density in the blob for the lines with available fwhm and flux data .",
    "we calculate the total soft seed photon energy density @xmath75 in the blob as @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the photon density in the blob contributed by the lines with available emission line data , @xmath78 is the sum of relative fluxes of these lines .",
    "using the method described in @xmath79 2 , we derive the parameters for all the sources in our sample .",
    "all the observational data and the results are listed in tables @xmath80 .",
    "the @xmath0-ray emission is violently variable . for each source , we derived two values of the doppler factor @xmath11 corresponding to the lowest and highest values of the observed @xmath0-ray fluxes .    in figs .",

    "the core dominance parameters @xmath6 are taken from @xcite , except those of the sources of 0454@xmath82234 , 0521@xmath82365 and 1741@xmath82038 taken from @xcite . a correlation between @xmath6 and @xmath83",
    "is found at a significant level of 97.5 per cent ( spearman correlation coefficient @xmath84 ) .",
    "the results are plotted in fig . [ 4 ] for the doppler factor @xmath85 derived from the highest @xmath0-ray flux .",
    "the significant level of the correlation becomes 95.2 per cent .",
    "the distribution of the central black hole mass @xmath86 in @xmath0-ray blazars is plotted in fig . [ 5 ] .",
    "the black hole masses @xmath86 are in the range of @xmath87 with an average of around @xmath88 .",
    "we plot the relation of the black hole mass @xmath86 with the lowest and highest @xmath0-ray luminosity @xmath89 in figs . [ 6 ] and [ 7 ] , respectively .",
    "the correlations between them are found at the significant levels of 97.8 and 96.6 per cent for the lowest and highest @xmath0-ray emissions , respectively .",
    "in this work , we estimate the size of the blr from the optical or uv continuum luminosity . the observed optical / uv continuum emission from @xmath0-ray blazars is a mixture of the emission from the disks and jets .",
    "the optical / uv continuum emission may be strongly beamed to us , since the viewing angles of the relativistic jets in these blazars are small .",
    "the emission from the jets may dominate over that from the disks at least in some blazars .",
    "so , the blr size derived from the observed optical / uv continuum luminosity may be over estimated , and the derived black hole mass is a upper limit @xcite .",
    "the size of the blob @xmath29 is assumed to be 120@xmath90 in our calculations ( see discussion in section @xmath79 2.2 ) . as the black hole mass @xmath86 is derived from the size of the blr and the line width , the size of the blob @xmath29 is proportional to the blr size @xmath1 . from eq .",
    "( 5 ) , we know that the energy density in the blob @xmath91 .",
    "the derived doppler factor @xmath11 in this work is therefore independent of the blr size @xmath1 ( see eq . ( 11 ) ) .",
    "it indicates that the overestimate of the blr size caused by the contamination of the optical / uv continuum emission has not affected the values of derived doppler factor @xmath11 .    in our calculations",
    ", we adopted a parameter @xmath32 to describe the optical depth of the blob , since we do not know the exact value of the actual number density @xmath25 of the electrons in the blob . from eq .",
    "( 11 ) , it is found that the doppler factor @xmath92 . for a typical value of @xmath93",
    ", we found that the derived @xmath11 becomes about twice of its initial value , if the parameter @xmath32 is changed from 1 to 0.01 .",
    "the uncertainty of @xmath32 in our calculations would not affect our results significantly .",
    "we only consider the photons from the blrs as the soft seed photons .",
    "other sources of soft seed photons ( e.g. , emission from the disks , synchrocyclotron emission in the blobs , etc . ) have not been included in the calculations .",
    "the doppler factor @xmath11 derived in this work are in the range of 3.04 and 17.00 , if @xmath94 is adopted .",
    "it is generally consistent with the results derived by other methods @xcite .",
    "it may imply that the soft seed photons are indeed mainly from the blrs in these sources .",
    "the variability doppler factors @xmath10 of 20 @xmath0-ray blazars in our sample have been derived from the radio variable time - scales are available @xcite .",
    "comparing with the doppler factors @xmath11 derived in this work , we find that the variability doppler factor @xmath10 are higher than @xmath11 derived in this work for most sources ( see figs . [ 1 ] and [ 2 ] ) .",
    "this may be due to the fact that we adopt @xmath94 and the derived doppler factor @xmath11 are then the lower limits .",
    "the value of @xmath32 may possibly be estimated roughly by letting @xmath95 .",
    "it can be found that the values of @xmath32 can be low as @xmath96 for some sources ( see eq . ( 11 ) , figs . [ 1 ] and [ 2 ] ) .    the core dominance parameter @xmath97 , where @xmath98 and @xmath99 are the core and extended flux densities at 5 ghz in the rest frame of the source .",
    "the core dominance parameter @xmath6 is believed to be a good indicator of the doppler factor of the jet .",
    "we find a significant correlation between the core dominance parameter @xmath6 and the derived doppler factor @xmath11 .",
    "this implies that the derived doppler factors @xmath11 are reliable for the @xmath0-ray blazars in this sample and the soft seed photons are mainly from the blrs .",
    "it was argued that the ssc radiative mechanism is dominant in bl lac objects @xcite .",
    "however , we can not find significant differences between bl lac objects and quasars in our investigations .",
    "the reason may be that the bl lac objects in our sample have relative stronger broad line emission compared with other bl lac objects listed in egret catalog iii , since we only select the @xmath0-ray blazars with broad - line emission data as our sample .",
    "so these bl lac objects in our sample are more like quasars as they have rather strong broad - line emission @xcite . for these bl lac objects with relative strong broad - line emission ,",
    "the erc radiative mechanism may probably be important as that in quasars .",
    "the black hole masses of @xmath0-ray blazars in this sample are in the range of @xmath100 .",
    "this is consistent with some previous results for radio - loud agns @xcite .",
    "we have found significant correlations between the black hole mass @xmath86 and the @xmath0-ray luminosity @xmath89 .",
    "the reason may be that the @xmath0-ray flux depends sensitively on the doppler factor @xmath11 and the values of the doppler factor of the @xmath0-ray agns in our sample spread over a large range ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "on the other hand , it is expected that the @xmath0-ray flux is independent of the black hole mass in erc mechanisms with the soft seed photons being from the blrs ( see eq .",
