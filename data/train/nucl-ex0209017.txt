    "gamma  ray emission from classical novae is dominated , during the first hours , by positron annihilation following the beta decay of radioactive nuclei .",
    "the main contribution comes from the decay of @xmath0f  ( half  life of 110  mn ) and hence is directly related to @xmath0f  nucleosynthesis during the outburst@xcite .",
    "the @xmath0f(p,@xmath1o  reaction is the main mode of @xmath0f  destruction and has been the object of many recent experiments@xcite but its rate remains poorly known at nova temperatures .",
    "the uncertainties are directly related to the unknown proton widths of the first three @xmath3ne  levels above proton emission threshold ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 = 6.419  mev , 3/2@xmath6 ; 6.437  mev , 1/2@xmath7 and 6.449  mev , 3/2@xmath6 ) .",
    "the tails of the corresponding resonances ( at respectively @xmath8 = 8  kev , 26  kev and 38  kev ) can dominate the astrophysical factor in the relevant energy range@xcite . as a consequence of these nuclear uncertainties , the @xmath0f  production in nova and the early gamma ",
    "ray emission is uncertain by a factor of @xmath9300@xcite .",
    "this supports the need of new experimental studies to improve the reliability of the predicted annihilation gamma ",
    "ray fluxes from novae .",
    "a direct measurement of the relevant resonance strengths is impossible due to the very low coulomb barrier penetrability .",
    "hence , we used an indirect method aiming at determining the one  nucleon spectroscopic factors in the analog levels of the mirror nucleus ( @xmath3f ) by the neutron transfer reaction d(@xmath0f , p)@xmath3f . assuming the equality of spectroscopic factors in analog levels",
    ", the proton width can be deduced from the calculated single particle widths@xcite .",
    "the experiment has been carried out at the _ centre de recherche du cyclotron _ of louvain - la - neuve ( belgium ) by bombarding deuteriated polypropylene ( cd@xmath10 ) targets ( @xmath9 100 @xmath11g/@xmath12 ) with a 14  mev @xmath0f  radioactive beam ( average intensity of @xmath13 @xmath0f  s@xmath14 on target and @xmath0o / @xmath0f  @xmath15 10@xmath16 purity ) .",
    "the experimental setup has been described elsewhere@xcite and consists of two silicon multistrip detectors lamp and leda@xcite .",
    "lamp covers backwards laboratory angles and was used to measure the angular distribution of the protons , whereas leda covers forward laboratory angles .",
    "the levels of astrophysical interest are situated high above the alpha emission threshold ( at 4.013  mev ) and mainly decay through @xmath3f@xmath17n+@xmath18 .",
    "hence , to reduce background , we required coincidences between a proton in lamp and a @xmath19n in leda .",
    "f  excitation energy spectrum for coincidence events ( 65% of the total statistics ) , showing the two 3/2@xmath6 levels of astrophysical interest around 6.5  mev .",
    "vertical lines show the known position of the @xmath3f  levels populated with low transferred angular momentum ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "the dashed line shows the broad 1/2@xmath7 level for @xmath21 ( see text).,width=529 ]    due to the kinematics only p and @xmath18 from the d(@xmath0f , p)@xmath3f and d(@xmath0f,@xmath22o reactions can reach lamp . when considering the coincidence events each reaction corresponds to a different zone in the ( @xmath23 ) spectrum and",
    "hence can be identified . a further tof selection in leda",
    "is done to discriminate the p@xmath19n from the p@xmath18 coincidences .",
    "the excitation energy of the decaying @xmath3f  levels can be kinematically reconstructed from the energies and angles of the detected protons .",
    "this has been done by taking into account the energy loss of the @xmath0f  and the protons in the cd@xmath10 target as well as the energy loss of the protons in the lamp dead layer .",
    "the corresponding spectrum is shown in figure  [ f : spect ] .",
    "the resolution is not sufficient to separate the various levels but the two 3/2@xmath6 levels of interest at 6.497 and 6.528  mev ( the analogs of the 3/2@xmath6 levels in @xmath3ne ) are well separated from the other groups of levels .",
    "the spectrum is limited at low excitation energy because of the p@xmath19n coincidence condition and at high excitation energy by the electronic threshold .",
    "however , if the coincidence condition is removed , the @xmath3f  spectrum extends to the ground state and can be used for the energy calibration using isolated peaks .",
    "however the uncertainty obtained on the excitation energy around the 6.5  mev peak ( two 3/2@xmath6 levels ) prevents a reliable extraction of the individual contribution of these two levels .",
    "making a selection on the 6.5  mev peak of the coincidence spectrum ( figure  [ f : spect ] ) , we obtain the preliminary angular distribution shown in figure  [ f : dsig ] .",
    "the coincidence efficiency for each strip ( angle ) is determined from a monte - carlo simulation taking an isotropic angular distribution for the @xmath18decay of @xmath3f  as a first approximation .",
    "we used the elastic scattering of the @xmath0f  beam ( detected in leda ) on the @xmath24c of the target for normalization .",
    "the solid lines in figure  [ f : dsig ] correspond to theoretical dwba calculations with nuclear potential from ref .",
    "@xcite for different transferred angular momentum ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "this nuclear potential has been determined by studying a similar neutron transfer reaction @xmath3f(d , p)@xmath26f at the same center - of - mass energy ( subcoulomb transfer ) where no compound nucleus component was seen@xcite .",
    "the comparison between the shapes of the theoretical and experimental angular distributions indicates a predominant @xmath27 transfer for the sum of the contributions of the two 3/2@xmath6 levels .",
    "the value obtained for the total spectroscopic factor is @xmath28 .",
    "although no peak is seen in figure  [ f : spect ] corresponding to the 1/2@xmath7 level ( @xmath4 = 6.429 mev , @xmath29 = 280 kev ) due to its large total width , it is possible to derive an upper limit for the spectroscopic factor of @xmath30 assuming an @xmath31 transfer .",
    "the important consequence of these preliminary values is that the contribution of these resonances to the destruction rate of @xmath0f be neglected but remains compatible with the nominal rate@xcite .",
    "the rate uncertainty is reduced by a factor of @xmath32 in the temperature range of novae , mainly due to the reduced contribution of the 1/2@xmath7 level .",
    "the impact on the rate for the two 3/2@xmath6 ( @xmath28 ) is more important at low temperature@xcite .",
