    "the atic ( advanced thin ionization calorimeter ) balloon spectrometer was designed to measure the energy spectra of primary cosmic - ray nuclei from protons to iron with elemental charge resolution in the energy range of @xmath050 gev to 100  tev per particle @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the spectrometer is also capable of measuring the total spectrum of cosmic - ray electrons and positrons @xcite .",
    "atic had three successful flights around the south pole : in 20002001 ( atic-1 ) , in 20022003 ( atic-2 ) , and in 20072008 ( atic-4 ) .",
    "atic-1 was a test flight ; nuclear spectra from protons to iron and the spectrum of electrons were measured in the atic-2 flight ; and the electron spectrum only was measured in atic-4 , due to malfunctioning of the pretrigger system .",
    "the present work is based on the results of the atic-2 flight .",
    "the atic spectrometer consists of a fully active bgo calorimeter , a carbon target with embedded scintillator hodoscopes , and a matrix of silicon detectors .",
    "the silicon matrix is used as a primary particle charge detector .",
    "the design of the instrument and the calibration procedures were described in detail elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the data obtained by the atic spectrometer include high - precision energy spectra of the most abundant cosmic - ray nuclei ( protons , he , c , o , ne , mg , si , and fe ) measured in terms of energy per particle @xcite . the total kinetic energy per particle is the most natural quantity for expressing the energy measured by the calorimetric spectrometer , and the results of the atic experiment were given in this way in @xcite . from the viewpoint of the physics of the propagation and acceleration of cosmic rays , however , it is more important to know the magnetic rigidity spectra of cosmic rays , and it is the information on the rigidity spectra _ in sources _ that is most important in studying the mechanisms of the acceleration of cosmic rays . converting from the observed energy per particle spectra to the rigidity spectra using the atic data poses no difficulties , since the charge of each particle is measured along with its energy .",
    "the rigidity spectra of abundant nuclei measured by the atic spectrometer are shown in figs .",
    "[ phe - rig][nemgsife ] .",
    "they are obtained directly from the energy per particle spectra published in @xcite .",
    "our objective in the present paper is to obtain and compare the spectra of abundant primary nuclei from protons to iron in the source , which have not hitherto been reported . from the point of view of the physics of propagation and acceleration of cosmic rays",
    "such a comparison is very important .",

    "in order to obtain the source spectra in terms of magnetic rigidity , the inverse problem of propagation of cosmic - ray particles must be solved using one model of propagation or another .",
    "we restrict ourselves in this paper to propagation models that consider the interstellar medium to be smooth within the magnetic galactic halo .",
    "some more complicated models that consider the interstellar medium to be essentially inhomogeneous have been studied elsewhere ( see , for example , the model of a closed galaxy with super bubbles embedded ; @xcite ) . however , at the present time the basis of such models looks insufficiently firm .",
    "for example , the model of local bubble within closed galaxy explains the upturn in the ratio of fluxes of nuclei of z=16 - 24 to iron near the energy 50  gev / n @xcite , but the same model is in contradiction with the latest data on b / c ratio of pamela @xcite and ams-02 @xcite showing no such upturn .",
    "therefore , we will consider only the simplest case of a smooth interstellar medium .",
    "it is generally quite difficult to solve the inverse problem for the general diffusion transport equation .",
    "however , the problem can be essentially simplified within a homogeneous model @xcite known as the leaky - box approximation to the diffusion transport equation .",
    "the leaky - box approximation was compared with more sophisticated diffusion models in @xcite .",
    "the leaky - box approximation works well for stable and not - too - heavy cosmic - ray nuclei . with a number of different assumptions about the character of diffusion , it was shown in @xcite that numerical solutions of the diffusion equation for fluxes of stable nuclei obtained with the galprop system could be approximated within a percentage accuracy using leaky - box models for nuclei from protons up to nickel .",
    "that is , the exact solution of the diffusion equation yields essentially the same results as a properly constructed leaky - box model , so one can use the leaky - box model instead of an explicit solution of the diffusion equation . in the leaky - box model",
    ", a solution of the inverse problem of propagation may be obtained easily .",
    "the diffusion of cosmic rays in the galaxy is described in the leaky - box model by a single parameter : the particle diffusion escape length from the galaxy @xmath1 , measured in g@xmath2 , which depends only on the magnetic rigidity @xmath3 of the particles .",
    "if primary abundant nuclei of a certain type are described by an effective source averaged over the galaxy volume with rigidity spectrum @xmath4 , their observed equilibrium spectrum takes the following form : @xmath5}q(r),\\ ] ] where @xmath6 ( g@xmath2 ) is the mean free path of a nucleus before nuclear interaction with fragmentation in the interstellar medium , @xmath7 is the velocity of the particle , and @xmath8 is the interstellar medium density averaged by the volume of the magnetic halo .",
    "equation ( [ eq : lb - direct ] ) is a solution of the direct problem of cosmic - ray propagation for the considered special case .",
    "the solution of the inverse problem of propagation ( i.e. , determining the source function from an observed particle spectrum ) is obtained through trivial inversion of eq .",
    "( [ eq : lb - direct ] ) : @xmath9 m(r).\\ ] ]    three different galprop models were studied in @xcite to support the conclusion that the leaky - box model approximates well the results of explicit solutions of the diffusion equation for the primary abundant cosmic - ray nuclei .",
    "plain _ galprop model had no reacceleration and was characterized by the following diffusion coefficient : @xmath10 we neglected by the factor @xmath11 here since @xmath12 in the range of our interest .",
    "the galprop model with _ distributed reacceleration _ in a medium with kolmogorov turbulence had the following parameters : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the alfven velocity , and @xmath15 is again a power - law function like in eq .",
    "( [ d0plain ] ) .",
    "finally , the model _ with damping _ was characterized by a mechanism of the back reaction of cosmic rays on the interstellar kraichnan - type turbulence together with distributed reacceleration .",
    "the following set of parameters was used in the damping model : @xmath16 the half - width of the galactic magnetic halo was @xmath17kpc in all of these models .",
    "we will briefly refer to these models as the plain equation  ( [ d0plain ] ) , the reacceleration equation  ( [ d0reaccel ] ) , and the damping equation  ( [ d0damping ] ) .",
    "some further details of the models may be found in @xcite .",
    "the prediction of the models of equations ( [ d0plain])([d0damping ] ) for the boron - to - carbon ratio obtained with the galprop system @xcite is shown in figure  [ ams - pamela - galprop ] together with the latest data of pamela @xcite and ams-02 @xcite .",
    "the data are shown for the rigidities @xmath18gv relevant to the present paper .",
    "it is seen from figure  [ ams - pamela - galprop ] that the original models of equations([d0plain])([d0damping ] ) do not fit the data of ams-02 well .",
    "the data of the pamela experiment have too few points above @xmath19gv with rather high statistical errors , so we will use the high - precision data of ams-02 only in our analysis .",
    "the ams-02 data supply a much more firm basis for quantitative analysis and were used in the paper .",
    "however , we would like to note that the pamela data together with the most recent ams-02 data show that there is no great systematic uncertainty in the contemporary experimental b / c ratio .     boron to carbon ratio by pamela @xcite and ams-02 @xcite and the original galprop models @xcite prediction.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the same models of equations([d0plain])([d0damping ] ) may be fitted to the ams-02 data optimally by a variation of the parameters @xmath20 and @xmath21 of the power - law function @xmath15 .",
    "the results of such an optimization are shown in figure  [ ams - optimal ] .",
    "the optimization hase been carried out for the rigidity region @xmath18gv .",
    "it is seen that the optimized curves for different models are a bit different , and the best @xmath22 values per unit of freedom are different for different models as well : 0.668 , 0.437 , and 0.596 for the plain , reacceleration , and damping models , respectively .",
    "the reacceleration model fits the data better than the two other models do . also , different models produced the following different sets of parameters : @xmath23 for the plain model ; @xmath24 for the reacceleration model ; @xmath25 for the damping model . here",
    "the errors are the statistical ones and mean one standard deviation ; @xmath26 means correlation of the statistical deviation for the parameters @xmath20 and @xmath21 ( there is a strong anticorrelation ) .",
    "boron to carbon ratio by ams-02 @xcite and the optimized plain , reacceleration and damping models.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the starting point to obtain the leaky - box parameters to solve the back - propagation problem in our approach is the diffusion coefficients of equations ( [ doptplain])([doptdamping ] ) . to obtain the leaky - box parameters to approximate the solution of diffusion equations with a given diffusion coefficient in a given model ,",
    "the following method was used in @xcite .",
    "the quantity named effective escape length @xmath27 has been introduced . for a nucleus with the nuclear fragmentation length @xmath6",
    ", @xmath28 can be written as ( see eq .  (",
    "18 ) in @xcite ) : @xmath29 ,   \\label{xeff}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 is the computed flux of the nucleus supposing no fragmentation , and @xmath31 is the computed flux for the actual value of @xmath6 . it is easy to see that @xmath32 is exactly @xmath1 within the leaky - box approximation . to obtain a leaky - box approximation for a diffusion model , the effective escape length of equation  ( [ xeff ] ) , computed with this model , should be approximated by a power - law function @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is some arbitrary reference value of rigidity ( @xmath35gv in @xcite ) .",
    "the escape length parameters found in @xcite ) this way were @xmath36 for the plain model ; @xmath37 for the reacceleration model ; @xmath38 for the damping model .    to obtain the escape length of the leaky - box model for the optimized diffusion coefficients of equations ( [ doptplain])([doptdamping ] ) we do not reproduce the calculations of @xcite for each of the diffusion coefficients of equations ( [ doptplain])([doptdamping ] ) , but use the results of @xcite directly in a more simple way . starting from the usual one - dimensional formula for the diffusion length @xmath39 , it is not difficult to show @xcite that within the leaky - box approximation and in the flat magnetic halo model there is the following relation between the escape length and the diffusion coefficient : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is some effective mean density of the interstellar gas within the galaxy disk",
    ", @xmath42 is the effective half - width of the galaxy disk , and @xmath43 is the half - width of the magnetic halo .",
    "it is seen from eq .",
    "( [ lamescvsd ] ) that if the exponent of a power - law diffusion coefficient is @xmath21 , then the escape length is a power - law function as well , and its exponent is @xmath44 . if the diffusion coefficient of some diffusion model and the approximation of this diffusion model by a leaky - box model is known , then the disk factor @xmath45 for this pair of models could be easily obtained from equation  ( [ lamescvsd ] ) : @xmath46 if the coefficient @xmath45 for some specific diffusion model is known , then eq .  ( [ lamescvsd ] ) can be used to calculate @xmath47 for any definite value of @xmath48 .",
    "it is expected generally that the coefficients @xmath45 calculated within different diffusion models should be close to each other since they refer to the same galaxy disk structure . actually , using the parameters of equations ( [ d0plain])([d0damping ] ) and ( [ ptusl0deltaplain])([ptusl0deltadamping ] ) for the original models of @xcite one obtains @xmath49 the values @xmath45 are the same within @xmath50 accuracy , and the difference is an expression of an approximate character of the leaky - box model .",
    "now the values of equations ( [ k_d - plain])([k_d - damping ] ) can be used to approximate the plain , reacceleration , and damping diffusion models with the optimized diffusion coefficients of equations([doptplain ] ) , ( [ doptreaccel ] ) , and ( [ doptdamping ] ) respectively by the leaky - box models .",
    "the results are @xmath51 @xmath52 @xmath53 for the plain , reacceleration , and damping models , respectively .",
    "all of the obtained points are shown in figure  [ delta - lambda ] in the axes @xmath54 .",
    "the results of approximation of three optimized galprop models ( [ doptplain])([doptdamping ] ) , see also figure  [ ams - optimal ] , by the leaky - box approximations ( [ optlam0deltaplain])([optlam0deltadamping]).,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    it is seen from equations ( [ doptplain])([doptdamping ] ) and ( [ optlam0deltaplain])([optlam0deltadamping ] ) that different diffusion models produce rather different diffusion coefficients or escape lengths in the leaky - box approximation to fit the same experimental data ( figure  [ ams - optimal ] ) . therefore , there is a great systematic uncertainty in obtaining the escape length related to uncertainty of the diffusion model of propagation of cosmic - ray particles .",
    "it is easy to obtain a source spectrum from the measured spectrum of a given primary abundant nucleus using equation  ( [ eq : lb - reverse ] ) with some known escape length , but it is a misleading goal to obtain the source spectra of the cosmic - ray nuclei themselves : the uncertainty of the slopes of the spectra will be too large due to a systematic uncertainty of the escape length . however ,",
    "as shown below , the _ differences _ of the slopes ( and , more generally , the shapes ) of the source spectra of different nuclei can be dealt with quite reasonably .",
    "to compare the shapes of the source spectra for different nuclei , one can use the ratios of the spectra : when the ratio is not constant , the shapes of the spectra are different .",
    "the question that we want to address is , what is the level of stability of such ratios against the uncertainties of the propagation model used ?    to answer this question , we construct a kind of a robust estimate of the relevant systematic errors .",
    "let @xmath55 and @xmath56 be the mean values of all @xmath57 and @xmath58 , respectively , determined by the equations ( [ optlam0deltaplain])([optlam0deltadamping ] ) .",
    "then we have _ the reference leaky - box model _ defined by @xmath59 let @xmath60 be an estimate of the systematic uncertainty for the value @xmath56 , and let @xmath61 be the maximal statistical error of @xmath21 among all the values defined by equations ( [ optlam0deltaplain])([optlam0deltadamping ] ) . then for a robust estimate of the possible systematic error for @xmath56 , we adopt the _",
    "double _ quadratic sum of @xmath62 and @xmath63 : @xmath64 in a similar way , we obtain a robust estimate of the possible systematic error for @xmath55 : @xmath65    to estimate the stability of the ratios of spectra in the source against systematic uncertainties , we calculate them for the reference propagation model @xmath66 and compare the result with four types of deviations in the parameters of the model : @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70",
    ".     reconstructed ratio of the p / fe source spectra , obtained with the reference propagation model ( [ ref ] ) and with the disturbed models .",
    "statistical errors are specified only for the reference model since for all other models the relative errors are the same for each rigidity value @xmath3.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the ratios of spectra p / fe in the source obtained with the reference model of equation  ( [ ref ] ) and with four disturbed models are shown in fig",
    ".  [ ratio - p - fe ] .",
    "it is seen that the model dependence of the _ shape _ of the ratio p / fe is small ( while the absolute value varies significantly ) .",
    "this means that one can safely study differences in the shapes of different spectra in the source against systematic uncertainties of the propagation model .",
    "the greater the difference between the masses of the considered nuclei , the stronger the model dependence , so the latter is the most apparent for p / fe from all possible combinations in the list of abundant nuclei ( p , he , c , o , ne , mg , si , fe ) . for all other ratios , the model dependence is weaker than for p / fe ( figure  [ ratio - p - fe ] ) .",
    "the conclusion is that the shape of the ratios of the reconstructed source spectra of all abundant primary nuclei are only weakly model dependent in the robust region of parameters @xmath71 , and @xmath72 .    to improve the statistics , the spectra of nuclei ne , mg , and si are combined for the following into the single rigidity spectrum ne+mg+si with an effective charge number @xmath73 .",

    "this phenomenon in the observed spectra was indicated in the atic experiment @xcite and was confirmed by pamela @xcite and ams-02 @xcite .",
    "the spectra of carbon and oxygen also become flatter at high energies .",
    "the flattening in the observed spectra was measured in the atic experiment @xcite for the nuclei heavier than helium and was confirmed by the data of the cream experiment @xcite .",
    "the complicated behavior of the spectra may be related to some nonlinear phenomena in cosmic - ray acceleration @xcite , or the heterogeneous structure of sources and the nearby interstellar medium @xcite , and may be explained quite naturally by the mixing of two or more sources with different spectra @xcite .",
    "however , the objective of the present paper is not to discuss the nature and the statistical significance of the complex behavior of the spectra , but to compare the spectra of different nuclei in the source and answer the simple questions : are the spectra in terms of magnetic rigidity in the source the same for different nuclei or not , and how great are the differences if the shapes of the spectra are not the same ?",
    "there are a total of six independent spectra ( p , he , c , o , ne+mg+si , fe ) , so @xmath74 ratios can be constructed and viewed as approximately model - independent characteristics of cosmic - ray sources .",
    "however , 15 ratios are of little use as material for analysis , so in this work we used a simplified approach to grasp important aspects of the behavior of the entire set of the spectra .",
    "we took the range of magnetic rigidity common to all of the obtained spectra ( approximately 501350  gv , indicated by vertical dashed lines in fig .  [ allnucl ] ) , and we found an average spectral index for each spectrum in this range by approximating it by a power - law function , _ ignoring certain deviations from pure power - law behavior _",
    "mentioned above . since the spectral indices were highly model dependent",
    ", we were interested not in the spectral indices themselves , but rather in how they varied from one nucleus to another . figure  [ deltagamma ]    differences between the source spectral indices of abundant nuclei and the spectral index of protons obtained using the reference propagation model ( [ ref ] ) and original propagation models ( [ ptusl0deltaplain][ptusl0deltadamping ] ) of @xcite.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    differences between the source spectral indices of abundant nuclei and the spectral index of protons obtained using the reference propagation model ( [ ref ] ) and original propagation models ( [ ptusl0deltaplain][ptusl0deltadamping ] ) of @xcite.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    shows the differences @xmath75 between the source spectral indices of abundant nuclei from the spectral index of protons as a function of the nuclear charge .",
    "the reconstructed differences between the source spectral indices for disturbed propagation models ( as in figure  [ ratio - p - fe ] ) also are shown in figure  [ deltagamma ] to study the model dependence of the result ( or , alternatively , to estimate the systematic errors ) .",
    "it is seen that the model dependence is relatively small , such that the systematic errors are substantially less than the statistical errors in spectral index differences , even for our robust estimate of the systematic errors .",
    "note that even the original propagation models of equations ( [ ptusl0deltaplain][ptusl0deltadamping ] ) of @xcite that were not optimized to the ams-02 b / c data @xcite do not produce strong systematic deviations in @xmath75 from our reference model , as can be seen in figure  [ deltagammaoriginals ] .",
    "discussing the data in fig .",
    "[ deltagamma ] , it is worth mentioning first that the spectral index of protons _ in the source _ statistically significantly differs from that of helium : @xmath76 .",
    "secondly , the steady rise in the spectrum steepness moving from helium to iron may be noted .",
    "this result is also statistically significant , as the slope of this part of the curve in fig .",
    "[ deltagamma ] is positive with a statistical significance greater than @xmath77 ( both statistics and systematics included ) .",
    "it is not clear , however , whether it makes physical sense to describe all nuclei from helium to iron using one curve , since the helium and heavy nuclei could originate from fundamentally different cosmic - ray sources .",
    "it is therefore logical to consider nuclei heavier than helium separately .",
    "there is also a positive trend in the slopes of their curves , but it is maintained with a statistical significance of just @xmath78 ( statistics and systematics ) .",

    "the tracer - ldb1 data @xcite show approximately the same result , but with lower statistical significance .",
    "the cream data show no trends in spectral indices , but the statistical errors are large ( about 0.4 for iron versus an expected difference of spectral indices of 0.2 , as may be deduced from the atic and tracer data ) ; therefore , no conclusions may be drawn .",
    "we also should note that the results for tracer and cream were obtained for magnetic rigidities less than 400  gv , versus 1350  gv in atic .",
    "the absolute spectra are not quite power law in all experiments ; therefore the results of this comparison should be accepted with caution .",

    "obviously , more exact experimental data are needed to draw more accurate conclusions .",
    "we would like to note that only a rather restricted subset of possible propagation models ( homogeneous galaxy halo ) was studied in this paper .",
    "our conclusion is that , within this subset of models , the results on ratios of source spectra of different nuclei are almost model independent , but clearly other more complicated propagation models should be studied .",
    "we represented our results as differences of averaged source spectral indices of different nuclei in the magnetic rigidity range 501350  gv .",
    "this approximate method is adequate for rather low statistics and a relatively narrow energy range , for comparison of spectra of different nuclei .",
    "new and more precise experiments are needed to obtain and study more detailed information .",
    "the difference of slopes of observed proton and helium spectra has been considered previously as an indication of different acceleration conditions for protons and helium in the sources many times , starting with the 2004 paper of atic @xcite , where this difference was observed with high statistical confidence ( about @xmath80 ) for the first time .",
    "this paper generalizes this important result to all abundant primary nuclei up to iron .",
    "the obtained differences of the slopes of the spectra in the source are a clear indication that the acceleration conditions may vary for all nuclei from protons to iron .",
    "this indication is important for understanding the astrophysical mechanisms of the acceleration of cosmic rays , but our opinion is that it is too early to discuss the details of the physics of these variations since the only experiment ( atic ) have reported this phenomenon explicitly .",
    "the results should be confirmed by new and more precise experiments ."
