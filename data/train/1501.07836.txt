    "in the last decade , observing quantum phenomena that are difficult or even impossible to detect in the laboratory has been possible through the concept of quantum simulation @xcite .",
    "originally an idea of richard feynman @xcite , it is based on implementing a complex quantum dynamics on a controllable quantum system . many proposals and experiments on quantum simulations in different controllable platforms such as trapped ions @xcite , superconducting circuits @xcite , ultracold gases @xcite , quantum photonics systems @xcite , and optical lattices @xcite , have been performed and have led to a deeper understanding of a wide variety of phenomena .    up to now , proposed models and experimental realizations of quantum simulations with trapped ions have been realized in spin models @xcite , quantum field theories @xcite , quantum phase transitions @xcite , many - body systems @xcite , fermionic and bosonic interactions @xcite , relativistic quantum physics , including dirac equation _ zitterbewegung _ , @xcite and its realization in the laboratory @xcite , klein paradox @xcite , and interacting dirac particles @xcite , among others .",
    "recently , an implementation of the majorana equation and unphysical quantum operations was proposed  @xcite , and experimentally realized  @xcite . in addition , u. alvarez - rodriguez _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have developed a mathematical formulation of an _ enlarged space _ or _ embedding space _ to perform linear transformations between space - time coordinates in a general quantum simulator .",
    "however , the implementation of these concepts in a trapped - ion simulator , including parity @xmath0 operations , has not yet been analyzed .    in this letter",
    ", we propose the realization of time and spatial parity operations , as well as galilean boosts , in a trapped - ion quantum simulator . we perform analytical and numerical calculations in paradigmatic examples to illustrate our protocol , which is based on state - of - the - art trapped - ion technologies .",
    "we show that this proposal , including state initialization , dynamics , and measurement , can be efficiently implemented in current experiments . while ref .",
    "@xcite focuses on the underlying mathematical properties behind the theoretical protocol for galilean transformations , here we propose a realistic implementation in trapped - ion systems .",
    "moreover , we develop a toolbox for trapped ions that can be used to implement reference frame transformations for any given dynamical equations .",
    "new interesting types of simulations can emerge by adding the reference frame transformation to the toolbox of possible operations .",
    "this work significantly advances the field of quantum simulations of unphysical operations and establishes a path for implementing time and spatial parities in quantum optics systems . as a further scope",
    ", these results may allow us to enhance our capabilities when studying many - body interacting systems and their symmetries .",
    "the formalism introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite allows us to implement the quantum simulation of reference frame transformations in the lab .",
    "this symmetry transformation is described by a linear relation between the initial @xmath1 and the final @xmath2 coordinates , @xmath3 , @xmath4 .",
    "the spinor in the enlarged space is defined as @xmath5 , where the even and odd part of any wave function can be expressed as @xmath6 $ ] .",
    "therefore , the dynamical information of @xmath7 and @xmath8 is encoded in the evolution of @xmath9 . moreover , through a judicious choice of measurement observables , one can perform a reference frame transformation via a local @xmath10 operator , or even observe spacetime correlation functions between different reference frames . throughout this paper",
    "we consider the evolution in the simulated hilbert space as given by the schrdinger equation @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is a simulated speed of light and we fix @xmath13 . the corresponding equation for @xmath9 in the embedding space , for arbitrary galilean transformations ,",
    "may be written as @xmath14 where @xmath15/(2\\alpha_{11})$ ] .",
    "we explain now how to use this representation for the implementation in a trapped - ion system . in the lamb - dicke regime , @xmath16 ,",
    "the hamiltonian describing the interaction between an ion and a laser driving is @xcite @xmath17e^{i(\\phi-\\delta t)}+{\\rm h.c.},\\nonumber\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the laser detuning , @xmath19 is the lamb - dicke parameter @xcite , @xmath20 is the wave number of the external field , @xmath21 is the mass of ion , @xmath22 is the frequency of a static potential harmonic oscillator , @xmath23 is the coupling strength , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the annihilation and creation operators of any suitable vibrational mode of the ion string , that we choose to be the center of mass motional mode , and @xmath26 is the field phase . in spin-1/2 language , @xmath27 , @xmath28 .    when @xmath29 , a carrier resonance can be obtained with hamiltonian @xmath30 . a red - sideband , also known as jaynes - cummings ( jc ) interaction , is realised in the case of @xmath31 .",
    "this hamiltonian is written as @xmath32 . respectively , when @xmath33 , a blue - sideband , anti - jaynes - cummings ( ajc ) interaction can be achieved , and its hamiltonian can be expressed as @xmath34 .",
    "we illustrate now how to apply these techniques to generate the time and spatial parity transformations in trapped ions .",
    "as a first example , we show how to use two trapped ions to simulate a time parity transformation , @xmath35 , @xmath36 . here",
    ", we choose the hamiltonian in the simulated space as a time - independent one , @xmath37 and the momentum @xmath38 , which describes a massless dirac hamiltonian without the internal degree of freedom .",
    "the corresponding one - dimensional schrdinger equation in the enlarged space can be expressed as @xmath39 the hamiltonian in the enlarged space , @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the pauli operator acting on ion 1 , which can be realized by implementing a blue- and red - sideband simultaneously @xcite , @xmath42 with proper phases for blue- and red - sideband @xmath43 , @xmath44 . here , @xmath45 and @xmath46 with @xmath47 .",
    "we depict in fig .",
    "[ setup ] , a scheme of the experimental setup with two ions interacting with lasers .",
    "the initial state in the enlarged space is given as , @xmath48 where @xmath49 can be described as a gaussian wave packet , @xmath50 . in a trapped - ion setup , this can be achieved by cooling the motional mode to the ground state , which is a gaussian , and displacing it by simultaneous red and blue sidebands with the hamiltonian @xmath51 , where @xmath52 , with different phases in the @xmath24 and @xmath53 operators as compared to the simulating hamiltonian @xmath54 .",
    "this will allow one to achieve an average @xmath55 momentum , using the auxiliary second ion initialized in an eigenstate of the @xmath56 operator .",
    "after applying the evolution propagator @xmath57 , we can evolve the state for any time .",
    "the solution reads @xmath58 furthermore , the quantum states in the simulated spaces are obtained reversing the initial mapping , @xmath59    we plot in fig .",

    "we calculate now the position average values in the simulated space for the different reference frames and their correlation , @xmath60    the spacetime correlations may be measured in different ways with current ion technology .",
    "the one we introduce here extends the physical principle employed in @xcite .",
    "the measurement is performed upon the @xmath61 observable of the first ion , associated with the enlarged space degree of freedom , via fluorescence detection . to achieve this ,",
    "a state - dependent displacement operator @xmath62 is applied to the internal state of this ion and the joint mode , with @xmath63  @xcite . in order to detect ,",
    "e.g. , the spacetime correlation @xmath64 in the simulated space , one should measure @xmath65 following eq .",
    "( [ wavepacketstime ] ) . here",
    ", the operator @xmath66 acts on the qubit degree of freedom of the enlarged space , and the measurement can be decomposed into two parts , one for each summand , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 .",
    "these two measurements can be obtained from the derivative of the @xmath69 observable with respect to @xmath20 in the limit @xmath70 , in which @xmath71 , with a local rotation in the first case to change @xmath72 into @xmath61 .",
    "moreover , computing @xmath73 for sizable @xmath20 , for the cases of initial @xmath61 and @xmath72 eigenstates in the internal state , allows one to obtain @xmath74 and @xmath75 . via fourier transform",
    ", we can obtain the position wavepacket probability distribution .",
    "the previous procedure enables us , among other things , to compute spacetime correlation functions without full tomography , which can reduce significantly the required resources .",
    "the second case we consider is the simulation of a spatial parity transformation , @xmath76 , @xmath77 .",
    "the initial state in the simulated space coincides with the one of time parity , @xmath78 .",
    "so does the hamiltonian in the simulated space , @xmath79 .",
    "it is obvious that @xmath80 .",
    "the hamiltonian in the enlarged space @xmath54 goes to @xmath81 , and the initial spinor in the enlarged space can be expressed as @xmath82    this can be achieved by initializing the internal state associated with the enlarged space in the @xmath83 state , cooling the motional mode to the ground state , which is a gaussian , and performing a conditional displacement of the motional state with the hamiltonian @xmath84 .",
    "we point out that for spatial parity one ion suffices for both state initialization and simulation .",
    "accordingly , the state in the enlarged space considering time - evolution results , @xmath85 as in the previous case , in order to recover the wavefunction in each of the simulated spaces we add or subtract the even and odd components of the spinor @xmath9 .",

    "@xmath88 where @xmath89 .",
    "these can be measured as in the previous example .",
    "we point out that the spatial parity case can be distinguished from the time parity case through the spacetime correlation , which is different in both cases .",
    "the computation of these correlations with our method makes full state tomography unnecessary .",
    "here , we propose the simulation of a reference frame change associated with a galilean boost , @xmath90 , @xmath91 , where @xmath92 is the relative velocity  @xcite . here , we consider the previous hamiltonian and initial state in the simulated space .",
    "the corresponding hamiltonian in the simulating enlarged space reads @xmath93 moreover , we can calculate the initial spinor state and compute the time evolution .",

    "[ wavepacketsfig](d ) the evolution of the wavepackets with and without galilean boost in eqs .",

    "moreover , the expectation values for position @xmath95 are @xmath96    for the trapped - ion simulation the initialization of the spinor can be done similarly to the time parity case .",
    "for the subsequent dynamics we divide the hamiltonian in eq .   into two parts to implement its evolution in the trapped - ion system . to realize @xmath97 in the laboratory , we propose to use a second auxiliary ion initialized in an eigenstate of @xmath98 , @xmath99 then , the hamiltonian can be implemented as @xmath100 with @xmath101 . moreover , the second term in eq .   can be realized as @xmath102 and with @xmath103 , through simultaneous red and blue sideband excitations upon the first ion .",
    "to analyze the robustness of the simulating system , we computed the dynamics with a master equation including different decoherence sources .",
    "we considered unintended carrier transitions due to off - resonant coupling , heating @xmath104 , phonon loss @xmath105 , dephasing @xmath106 , and spontaneous emission @xmath107 , @xmath108+\\gamma_{h } l(a^\\dag)\\rho+\\gamma_{c } l(a)\\rho\\\\&&+\\gamma_\\phi l(\\sigma^z)\\rho+\\gamma_{-}l(\\sigma^{-})\\rho,\\label{labmastereq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the lindblad superoperators are @xmath109 . here , @xmath110 is the trapped - ion hamiltonian corresponding to each of the three cases analyzed , namely , time parity , spatial parity , and galilean boost .",
    "we include carrier and counterrotating sideband terms in the dynamics , i.e. , without performing vibrational rotating - wave approximation",
