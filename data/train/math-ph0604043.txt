    "the coulomb gas approach to two - dimensional critical models which can be written as loop gases , such as the o@xmath0 model and @xmath3-state potts models , has been extraordinarily successful in deriving their universal bulk properties .",
    "first developed by den nijs @xcite and nienhuis @xcite in order to explain conjectured exact values for the principal bulk critical exponents , it was adapted by di francesco , saleur and zuber @xcite to compute the partition function on the torus , which encodes all the bulk scaling dimensions @xcite .",
    "however , this particular approach has not , so far , been successfully adapted to explain the conjectured exact values @xcite for the _ boundary _ scaling dimensions in these models , even though many of them have now been derived using other methods @xcite applied to related lattice models , and , more recently , rigorously using schramm - loewner evolution ( sle ) @xcite . from the point of view of conformal field theory ( cft ) , both the boundary and the bulk exponents are encoded in the partition function on the annulus @xcite , and therefore a direct computation of this object is of great interest . from the point of view of cft ,",
    "general values of @xmath1 and @xmath3 give irrational non - unitary examples .",
    "_ _    as we shall explain , the naive application of coulomb gas methods to domains with boundaries fails to account either for the reduction of the central charge @xmath4 from its free field value of unity , or for the elimination of the null states , which , as is known from cft , is necessary to maintain modular invariance . in this paper",
    "we propose a resolution of these issues which provides an explicit formula for the partition function on the annulus .",
    "consider an annulus @xmath5 , identifying @xmath6 .",
    "introduce the conjugate moduli @xmath7 note that if the annulus is conformally mapped to the region @xmath8 between two circles , @xmath9 .",
    "we impose free boundary conditions on the o@xmath0 spins on @xmath10 .",
    "as usual in the coulomb gas , we introduce the parametrisation @xmath11 , @xmath12 , where @xmath13 corresponds to the dilute critical point of the o@xmath0 model ( or the tricritical point of the @xmath3-state potts model ) , and @xmath14 to the critical dense phase of the o@xmath0 model ( or the ordinary critical point of the potts model . ) then our main result for the annulus partition function is @xmath15    in terms of the conjugate modulus @xmath16 this becomes @xmath17    this has the form expected from boundary conformal field theory @xcite : ( [ 2 ] ) is + @xmath18 , where @xmath19 runs over the allowed set of boundary scaling dimensions , @xmath20 is a highest weight virasoro character , and @xmath21 is a degeneracy factor , which is a polynomial in @xmath1 ( although only integer in those cases when the theory is unitary ) . in this form",
    "the explicit expression ( [ 2 ] ) is not new , and indeed is originally due to saleur and bauer @xcite , who deduced the allowed scaling dimensions from bethe ansatz and quantum group arguments . in this context",
    "the degeneracy factor @xmath22 is the quantum dimension .",
    "it has been used extensively in papers by saleur and pasquier @xcite , saleur @xcite , and more recently appeared in a paper by read and saleur @xcite . however",
    ", a direct derivation from the lattice o@xmath0 model solely using coulomb gas arguments has not appeared to our knowledge , and this is the point of the present paper .",
    "note that ( [ mod ] ) also has the form expected from boundary cft @xcite , namely + @xmath23 where now the sum is over allowed bulk scaling dimensions @xmath24 , and @xmath25 is a matrix element with a boundary state .",
    "in particular , for @xmath26 we have @xmath27 which gives the boundary entropy @xcite @xmath28 .",
    "we have explicitly written the dependence on @xmath29 in eqs .",
    "( [ 2],[mod ] ) because , if we wish to consider a modified partition function in which the loops which wrap non - trivially around the annulus are counted with a different weight @xmath30 , it is simply necessary to replace @xmath31 .",
    "this allows us to compute interesting quantities for percolation and self - avoiding loops .",
    "for example , in critical percolation ( @xmath32 ) the probability that a cluster connects the two boundaries of the annulus is @xmath33    the partition function for a single self - avoiding loop which wraps non - trivially around the annulus ( the number of such loops weighted by @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the non - universal connective constant ) is @xmath36 in the limit @xmath37 , we find @xmath38 .",
    "the form of this agrees with a rigorous result of werner @xcite .",
    "the layout of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] we give a brief survey of coulomb gas methods as applied in the plane and the cylinder , and then discuss the particular problems associated with domains with boundaries , in particular the annulus .",
    "this will lead to the proposal ( [ 2 ] ) for the partition function .",
    "as with most coulomb gas methods , this is not wholly deductive , but relies on some heuristic reasoning .",
    "however , in sec.[sec3 ] , we show that ( [ 2 ] ) agrees with previously known results for various special cases ( for example the ising model and the 3-state potts model . ) in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] we then derive a variety of new results , some of which have already been mentioned above .",
    "we first summarise the coulomb gas arguments as applied to the plane and cylinder , as formulated by de nijs @xcite and nienhuis @xcite , and elaborated by kondev @xcite .",
    "the o@xmath0 model is most easily realised on the honeycomb lattice . at each site @xmath39",
    "is an @xmath1-component spin @xmath40 ( initially @xmath1 is a positive integer . )",
    "the boltzmann weight for a given configuration is @xmath41 where the product is over all edges @xmath42 of the lattice .",
    "the partition function is the trace over these weights , a linear operation defined by @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "expanding ( [ on ] ) in powers of @xmath46 gives a sum over all subsets @xmath47 of the edges , with an associated factor @xmath48 .",
    "implementing the trace operation eliminates all subgraphs which are not unions of non - intersecting closed loops ( for the time being we ignore boundaries ) , and each of these gets counted with a weight @xmath1 .    at this point",
    "we can allow @xmath1 to be any positive real number .",
    "this gives a measure on the allowed subgraphs @xmath47 , called the loop gas .",
    "if @xmath46 is small , the mean loop length is finite , even in the thermodynamic limit , but there is a critical value @xmath49 at which it first diverges .",
    "this is called the dilute critical point . for @xmath50",
    "a single loop contains a finite fraction of the sites : this is the dense phase .    the critical @xmath3-state potts model on the square lattice",
    "can also be written , via the fortuin - kasteleyn @xcite correspondence , in terms of a loop gas , in which each closed loop carries a factor @xcite @xmath51 .",
    "both these loop gas models can be mapped to a model of heights @xmath52 on the sites @xmath53 of the dual lattice , by first orienting each loop , so that a configuration of @xmath54 non - oriented loops corresponds to @xmath55 configurations of oriented loops , and then , for each edge of the lattice , assigning height differences @xmath56 between the neighbouring sites of the dual lattice according to whether the edge is contained in the oriented subgraph @xmath47 , and its orientation . the weight @xmath1 ( or @xmath57 ) for each non - oriented loop",
    "is distributed into a factor @xmath58 for each clockwise ( anticlockwise ) oriented loop , where @xmath59 .",
    "although these weights are complex ( a feature which lies at the heart of the difficulties associated with a rigorous treatment of the coulomb gas approach ) , they have the advantage of being local , in the sense that they may be distributed so that each loop acquires a factor @xmath60 whenever it turns through an angle @xmath61 at a vertex .",
    "however , it should be noted that , at least for the fully packed model on the square lattice , there is a mapping to the 6-vertex model with positive boltzmann weights : at each vertex the two loops are either oriented parallel to each other , with weight @xmath62 , or anti - parallel in which case the weight is @xmath63    the coulomb gas method assumes that , in the continuum limit , the discrete heights become continuous and the boltzmann weights converge to @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the action of a free field theory @xmath66 the original discrete model may be recovered from this by adding a term @xmath67 in the limit @xmath68 .",
    "however , on a cylinder of length @xmath69 and circumference @xmath70 , with @xmath71 , this does not properly account for loops which wind around it : these can be taken into account by placing ` electric ' charges @xmath72 at either end .",
    "this modifies the partition function to @xmath73 , identifying the total central charge @xmath74 the scaling dimensions of electric charges @xmath75 are also modified if we put them at the ends of the cylinder as well : @xmath76 note that @xmath77 : this an example of the electric charge asymmetry introduced by this construction .",
    "@xmath78 is fixed in terms of @xmath29 by requiring @xcite that @xmath79 be marginal in the sense of the renormalisation group , i.e.  @xmath80 .",
    "this fixes @xmath81 with the sign depending on whether we choose @xmath82 or @xmath83 .",
    "in fact this ambiguity is to be expected : for each value of @xmath1 , @xmath29 is only defined up to a sign ( actually we can add multiples of @xmath84 as well , but these give less relevant operators ) and these correspond to the dilute ( @xmath85 ) and dense ( @xmath86 ) cases of the critical o@xmath0 model . in the following",
    "we take the lower sign by convention .",
    "note that these ideas are easy to extend to the partition function on the torus , correctly taking into account loops which wrap around some combination of the two cycles @xcite .",
    "now consider the case of the annulus . throughout this paper",
    "we assume free boundary conditions on the o@xmath0 spins , which means that there are only closed loops in the loop gas representation .",
    "( partial results using coulomb gas methods were found for the case of fixed boundary conditions in ref .",
    "@xcite for the special case @xmath87 in the dense phase . )",
    "first consider the case when @xmath71 , where we expect @xmath88 with @xmath4 given as above .",
    "in this limit there is no contribution of loops wrapping around the annulus , so we expect that that @xmath89 . naively then",
    ", we get a free field theory with ( equal ) dirichlet boundary conditions , which gives @xmath90 .    where does the correction to @xmath4 come from ? one ( incorrect ) possibility is as follows : looking back at the lattice construction ,",
    "we see that there are extra factors of @xmath91 whenever a loop is next to the boundary , which are not properly taken into account in the the bulk boltzmann weights of the height model .",
    "the sign is determined by whether the height at a site next to the boundary is @xmath92 . in the continuum limit",
    "these would lead to boundary terms in the action proportional to @xmath93 where @xmath94 is along the inward pointing normal to the boundary and @xmath95 is a line element . for",
    "the annulus these would give something proportional to @xmath96 however , an explicit calculation ( see appendix ) shows that such a combination does not contribute to @xmath4 .",
    "in fact , if we add to the action a general boundary term @xmath97 we find that the effective central charge is @xmath98 thus not only is there no contribution if @xmath99 , as in ( [ b1 ] ) , we must also have @xmath100 real , rather than pure imaginary .",
    "an equivalent , and easier , way of getting the same modification to @xmath4 is to assume that the correct boundary conditions , even when @xmath71 , are @xmath101 in that case we can write @xmath102 , where @xmath103 vanishes on both @xmath104 and @xmath105 . the functional integral over @xmath106 gives @xmath90 as before , and the modification to the partition function is @xmath107 .",
    "so if we take @xmath108 we get the correct @xmath4 .",
    "note that , for a long rectangular strip rather than an annulus , this is like adding magnetic charges , or vortices , at the ends .",
    "thus it would appear that there should be a spontaneous average magnetic flux around the annulus , if @xmath109 .",
    "this may be understood heuristically in terms of the preferred parallel , rather than antiparallel , alignment of neighbouring loops : this effect should be enhanced near a boundary , since loops are geometrically constrained to lie approximately parallel or anti - parallel to the boundary .",
    "the actual value of @xmath110 may be fixed by the following argument .",
    "consider first the geometry of a long rectangle with @xmath71 , where the loops are allowed to end on the boundaries at @xmath6 , but , as before , not on @xmath10 . in that case",
    "the total charge @xmath111 flowing along the rectangle is not fixed , and we can ask the question what is its mean value @xmath110 in the state of lowest free energy . a flux @xmath111 corresponds to vortices of strengths @xmath112 at the ends of the rectangle .",
    "however this can increase or decrease in units of 2 by shedding vortices from either end of the rectangle ( see fig .",
    "[ screening ] ) .",
    "the    the screening of magnetic flux in a long rectangle .",
    "if the background flux @xmath111 is too large , vortex pairs of strength @xmath113 can be shed from either end of the rectangle and will annihilate in order to reduce the free energy . if @xmath111 is too small , the opposite effect occurs.,width=377 ]    additional free energy for creating such a pair of vortices is @xmath114 scaling dimension of a vortex of strength @xmath113 , from which we read off the scaling dimension @xmath115 if @xmath111 is too large , @xmath116 , which means that the corresponding renormalisation group @xmath117 .",
    "( note that since we are in the boundary , rather than the bulk , situation , the eigenvalue is @xmath118 rather than @xmath119 . )",
    "this implies that such @xmath113 vortex pairs are closely bound .",
    "thus any such pairs shed from the boundaries at @xmath6 will annihilate to reduce their free energy . on the other hand , if @xmath111 is too small , @xmath120 , which means that any such vortex pairs will unbind .",
    "this will act to increase the effective value of @xmath111 .",
    "this screening effect implies that the mean value @xmath110 of the magnetic flux which minimises the free energy corresponds to @xmath121 , that is @xmath122 so that @xmath123 which is the same as found above in ( [ m0 ] ) .",
    "there is a similar minimum free energy solution with @xmath124 .",
    "note that the above argument is analogous to the earlier argument which fixed @xmath78 , where we demanded that electric @xmath113 charges should be marginal .",
    "if we now go the annulus , we expect a total average magnetic flux @xmath125 to spontaneously form , even when @xmath71 .",
    "now suppose that @xmath126 is not so large , so we can have extra loops wrapping around the @xmath127-cycle .",
    "we can orient these as before . if the total number of up arrows minus down arrows ( the additional magnetic flux flowing along the annulus ) is @xmath128 , then we get @xmath129 . as for the cylinder , in order to count them correctly we need to put in a factor @xmath130 .",
    "thus we get the following first guess for the partition function on the annulus : @xmath131 where @xmath132 is the partition function from @xmath106 .",
    "note that we should sum over both possible signs for @xmath110 .",
    "if we let @xmath133 in the first term this simplifies to @xmath134 note that if we want to count loops wrapping around the annulus with a different weight @xmath30 , we just change @xmath31 in the above ( keeping @xmath78 the same . )    eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) has some good features and some bad ones .",
    "in general we expect that @xmath135 can be written as a sum of terms @xmath136 where @xmath137 runs over all the allowed scaling dimensions of the allowed boundary operators .",
    "( for a unitary theory the coefficients should be non - negative integers , but this does nt have to hold for general @xmath1 . )",
    "we see in ( [ 1 ] ) for @xmath138 the scaling dimensions of the boundary @xmath54-leg operators , as first conjectured by saleur and duplantier @xcite .",
    "however , for the dilute case with @xmath85 , @xmath139 actually gives the next - to - leading term as @xmath140 .",
    "this does nt make sense : we expect this to come from @xmath141 .",
    "more seriously , ( [ 1 ] ) fails to account for the fact that the scaling dimensions of the boundary @xmath54-leg operators correspond to those of the degenerate cases @xmath142 of the kac table : in general these operators correspond to highest weight states whose virasoro representations are reducible : they have a null descendent state ( which corresponds to a term in the expansion of @xmath143 ) of dimension @xmath144 . for a unitary theory , or more generally a minimal model , we know that such states ( and all their descendents ) should be subtracted out of the partition function . for a non - unitary theory",
    "this is not necessary : however we shall show later that if they are retained , the behaviour as @xmath145 is incorrect .",
    "this leads to the conclusion that each term in ( [ 1 ] ) should be modified according to @xmath146 note that this has the feature of automatically eliminating the ` rogue ' state at @xmath139 .",
    "we now give a physical argument for this subtraction .",
    "once again it is useful to think about the rectangle geometry where magnetic flux can be created or destroyed at the boundaries at @xmath6 .",
    "it is also useful to think in terms of the energy eigenstates of the hamiltonian @xmath147 which generates translations in @xmath127 . in general ,",
    "each configuration with total magnetic flux @xmath128 will be accompanied by excitations of the @xmath106 field , which correspond to the virasoro descendents .",
    "if the energy of these is correct they can resonate with the original highest weight state plus a number of pairs of marginally bound @xmath148 magnetic charges , each of which has energy @xmath149 .",
    "if the excitation energy is @xmath150 , exactly @xmath151 vortex pairs can be shed from the boundaries at @xmath6 ( see fig .  [ null ] ) .",
    "mechanism for the appearance of null states . in this example",
    ", an excited state in the @xmath152 sector has just sufficient energy @xmath153 to allow two marginally bound pairs of @xmath113 vortices to form .",
    "these can then move to the ends of the rectangle , and one of them can then annihilate with the original flux line .",
    "the state is therefore equivalent to the ground state in the @xmath154 sector , which has already been counted in ( [ 1 ] ) and which therefore must be subtracted off.,width=377 ]    these states , however , are identical to those with total magnetic charge @xmath155 , and should therefore not be doubly counted .",
    "the effect of this subtraction is therefore to modify the sum in ( [ 2 ] ) to @xmath156 relabelling @xmath157 in the second term has the effect of modifying @xmath158 which finally leads to the conjecture ( [ 2 ] ) for the annulus partition function , after normalising so that the coefficient of the @xmath159 term ( the contribution of the identity operator ) is unity : @xmath160    note that all the coefficients in ( [ 2 ] ) are polynomials in @xmath59 as we expect . for @xmath152",
    "we get exactly @xmath1 ( the degeneracy factor for a single loop wrapping around the annulus ) , for @xmath161 we get @xmath162 , and so on .",
    "now we express ( [ 2 ] ) ( for general @xmath163 ) in terms of the conjugate modulus @xmath164 . setting @xmath165 we have @xmath166 using the poisson sum formula @xmath167 ,",
    "the integral is @xmath168p}dp\\\\ & & = ( 4\\pi/\\delta g)^{1/2}e^{-\\frac 1{\\delta g}[\\chi'+2\\pi m - i\\frac{(1-g)\\delta}2]^2}\\\\ & & = ( 4\\pi/\\delta g)^{1/2}e^{-\\frac1{\\delta g}(\\chi'+2\\pi m)^2 + i(\\chi'+2\\pi m)\\frac{(1-g)}g + \\frac{(1-g)^2\\delta}{2g}}\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the last term in the exponential cancels the @xmath169 . under a modular transformation",
    "@xmath170 so we end up with @xmath171 which finally simplifies to ( [ mod ] ) .",
    "note that if we had not subtracted off the null states , as in ( [ 1 ] ) , we would find @xmath172 rather than @xmath173 .",
    "this is an example of how the null state subtraction is necessary to maintain the correct modular properties @xcite .",
    "the leading term as @xmath37 , with @xmath174 , agrees with the exponent found in ref .",
    "@xcite for the case of loops wrapping around a long cylinder counted with weight @xmath30 .",
    "we now have also the prefactor : @xmath175    if we set @xmath176 , the other exponents in ( [ mod ] ) are those of _ even _ electric charge operators @xmath177 . for general @xmath78",
    "these are not in the kac table , consistent with the fact that there is no explicit substraction of null states in ( [ mod ] ) , so the characters are simply given by the infinite product . _",
    "_    we now check ( [ 2 ] ) against some known cases .",
    "in this case @xmath179 , @xmath180 , for which we expect @xmath181 , since loops wrapping round the annulus should all get a weight @xmath178 .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) gives @xmath182 the prefactor is @xmath183 if @xmath184 , @xmath185 if @xmath186 , and zero otherwise .",
    "after a little algebra we get @xmath187 this is identically equal to 1 by euler s pentagonal identity .",
    "this should correspond to the unitary cft which describes the scaling limit of the critical ising model .",
    "now @xmath188 , @xmath189 .",
    "the numerator in ( [ 2 ] ) is @xmath190 now @xmath191 using the rocha - caridi character formula @xcite @xmath192 for the case @xmath193 , we see that the first 2 terms give @xmath194 and the second pair give @xmath195 .",
    "this then agrees with the result @xcite for the ising model with free boundary conditions @xmath196 alternatively we can look at the dual spins , which are fixed on the boundary .",
    "if they are fixed into the same state on both boundaries we must have @xmath128 even , so that @xmath197 , and if they are fixed into opposite states @xmath128 must be odd , so @xmath198 . these also agree with ref .",

    "the numerator in ( [ 2 ] ) becomes @xmath203 this agrees with the interpretation as the xy model at the kosterlitz - thouless transition : the terms with @xmath204 correspond to a total vorticity @xmath205 along the annulus .",
    "now @xmath207 and @xmath208 . the numerator in ( [ 2 ] ) is @xmath209 if we take free boundary conditions on both boundaries we should restrict @xmath128 to be even . then @xmath210 these pair up as follows : @xmath211 to give @xmath212 which agrees with ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "note that if we choose free boundary conditions on one edge and fixed on the other , @xmath128 is restricted to be odd , and the leading term as @xmath140 comes from @xmath152 , and is @xmath213 the @xmath214 is to be expected , because in the fortuin - kasteleyn representation each closed loop carries a factor @xmath51 .",
    "in this case @xmath216 , @xmath217 .",
    "the numerator in ( [ 2 ] ) is @xmath218 we get a non - zero contribution in the following cases : @xmath219 using euler s identity again we see that @xmath220 , consistent with the dual interpretation as the ising model at zero temperature .",
    "( the factor 2 is due to the global spin reversal . ) on the other hand this model can be interpreted as the @xmath32 potts model ( percolation ) .",
    "choosing the sites on both boundaries to be in the same potts state enforces @xmath128 to be even , and then we get @xmath181 as expected .",
    "now @xmath222 , @xmath223 .",
    "the numerator in ( [ 2 ] ) is @xmath224 so @xmath128 is even .",
    "for @xmath225 so @xmath226 this is correct , since in this case there is just one macroscopic loop ( or spanning tree ) which is counted with weight @xmath178 .",
    "by setting @xmath227 in ( [ 2 ] ) with @xmath228 we suppress all other contributions with a non - zero number of loops wrapping around the annulus . in terms of percolation",

    "this crossing probability is therefore @xmath229 so that @xmath230 as @xmath140 . using the jacobi triple product formula",

    "note that this result is different from , and much larger than , the result found in ref .",
    "this is because in that paper crossing clusters which also wrap around the annulus were disallowed .",
    "it would be interesting to compare the above result with the implicit formula derived by dubdat @xcite using sle methods .",
    "note that , in principle , one can solve for @xmath235 as a function of @xmath236 and substitute in ( [ 2 ] ) , hence obtaining the complete generating function for the probabilities that a given number of clusters wrap around the annulus .",
    "if we take the @xmath237 term in ( [ 2 ] ) with @xmath238 we obtain the partition function @xmath239 for a single self - avoiding loop which wraps around the annulus . from ( [ 2 ] )",
    "we need @xmath240 so we get a non - zero result only when @xmath128 is odd , say @xmath241 , whence , after a little algebra , @xmath242 the leading behaviour as @xmath140 comes from @xmath243 and is @xmath244 as expected .    in the opposite limit",
    "we can use ( [ 3 ] ) . in this case",
    "the leading behaviour comes from differentiating the exponent : @xmath245 if the annulus is mapped into the region between two circles radii @xmath246 and @xmath247 , the last factor is just @xmath248 .      in this case @xmath249",
    "if we let @xmath250 we get the same expression except @xmath251 .",
    "so the sum is @xmath252 and finally ( since @xmath253 ) @xmath254 using the jacobi triple product formula this can be rewritten as @xmath255 the leading term as @xmath140 is @xmath256 this is reasonable since the loop is weighted by a factor @xmath34 so the contribution grows exponentially with @xmath69 .",
    "logarithmic cfts have been studied for some time , although the question of how they satisfy modular invariance has not been resolved in general @xcite .",
    "the limit @xmath2 of the o@xmath0 model affords an example in both the dilute and dense regimes ; other examples have been discussed in ref .  @xcite .",
    "if we differentiate the whole expression for @xmath135 wrt @xmath1 at @xmath178 , we get 3 kinds of contribution : the first comes from differentiating wrt @xmath163 : this gives the partition function for loops wrapping round the annulus as found above , and is a regular series in @xmath257 .",
    "the second comes from differentiating @xmath258 and gives @xmath259 times the usual partition function at @xmath178 .",
    "the third comes from differentiating the exponents : using @xmath260 the result , in the dilute case when @xmath238 , is proportional to @xmath261 as before , the only contributions come from @xmath128 even , and proceeding as before we get @xmath262 or @xmath263 note that we still get the null state structure in this logarithmic sector .    in the dense phase , the partition function vanishes .",
    "the non - logarithmic terms have already been evaluated .",

    "the leading term as @xmath140 gives the contribution of single dense loops ( or spanning trees ) which do not wrap around the annulus : note that this is much smaller than the @xmath266 contribution from those which do .",
    "in this paper we have presented an explicit result for scaling limit of the partition function of the critical o@xmath0 and @xmath3-state potts models on the annulus .",
    "our formalism makes it simple to count loops which wrap around the annulus with different weights , leading potentially to many new formula for crossing probabilities in percolation and for self - avoiding loops , some of which have been presented here .",
    "the electric - magnetic dual of our arguments for a long ( @xmath267 ) annulus can in fact be applied to a long ( @xmath268 ) cylinder , to give an alternative derivation of the usual relation between @xmath78 , @xmath29 and @xmath1 . for a long annulus we argued that @xmath113 magnetic charges ( vortices ) would rearrange themselves in such a way as to induce mean magnetic charges @xmath269 at the ends of a long rectangle , leading to a net magnetic flux around the annulus . for a long cylinder",
    ", one may similarly argue that the @xmath113 electric charges in the model also rearrange themselves to give net electric charges @xmath270 at either end .",
    "these can then be interpreted as counting loops going around the cylinder with the weight @xmath271 .",
    "like all coulomb gas methods , however , the arguments are somewhat heuristic , although they lead to completely explicit formulae , and , because of the complex weights , it seems hard to make them rigorous .",
    "in particular , although we have computed the partition function , it is by no means clear that the same ensemble can be used to compute correlation functions in the original model",
    ". it would be nice to see a direct connection with the other ` coulomb gas ' approach which has been employed in cft , namely that originally developed by dotsenko and fateev @xcite .",
    "this is essentially a way of constructing holomorphic conformal blocks using modified free field theory .",
    "however , it has many features in common with the coulomb gas construction used here : the background charge @xmath110 , and the marginal screening operators , which in our case are the @xmath113 vortices . in the bulk , it is still necessary , in the dotsenko - fateev approach , to sew together the holomorphic and anti - holomorphic blocks in a consistent way to obtain correlation functions , but in boundary cft the correlation functions are linear combinations of the conformal blocks ( specialised to real values of their arguments ) , and so the correpondence between the two approaches should be more direct . it would , of course , be important to establish any of these results rigorously , for example by using sle methods .",

    "i thank h.  saleur for pointing out several important references missing in an earlier version of this paper .",
    "consider the action @xmath272 we wish to compute the regularised free energy , or equivalently the ground state energy @xmath273 of the associated hamiltonian .",
    "let @xmath274 then @xmath275 from which we read off the ground state energy @xmath276 where @xmath277",
    ". we can regularise this sum either by modifying the dispersion relation ( eg using a lattice , in which case @xmath278 ) and using the euler - maclaurin formula , or using zeta - function , in which case we get the standard result @xmath279 corresponding to @xmath90 .",
    "if we use zeta function regularisation we have @xmath283 so @xmath284 if we use a lattice dispersion relation and also replace the boundary derivatives by finite differences , the sum becomes @xmath285 on which we use the formulae @xmath286 giving the same result .",
    "it can also be verified by writing , for a general position dependent @xmath287 @xmath288 where @xmath289 is the green s function for the free field with dirichlet boundary conditions .",
