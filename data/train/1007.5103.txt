    "the overall star formation efficiency is the ratio of the mass of stars formed over the cloud lifetime ( @xmath92 ) to the initial cloud mass , or approximately , to the current cloud mass plus the mass of all stars formed up to now .",
    "we find that only about 1% of the cloud mass is currently in ysos .",
    "we assume the mean timescale for a yso in the selected mass range to be detected by irac ( @xmath93 ) is @xmath94 yr , which is the statistical lifetime of high - mass protostars in the cygnus x molecular cloud complex @xcite .",
    "if the final star formation efficiency is more like 10% @xcite the star formation process must continue for about @xmath95 at the present rate to convert 10% of the cloud to stars .",
    "so the current fraction of ysos , together with an assumed yso timescale implies the overall time during which the cloud is actively forming stars .",
    "if the yso timescale for high mass stars is so short , @xmath96 yr , for a typical cloud lifetime of @xmath97 yr and star formation occurred at the presently observed rate , the w51 clouds would convert 10% of their mass to stars in only 1/10th of the cloud lifetime .",
    "we are probably observing these clouds at an exceptionally high star formation rate , relative to the average over the cloud lifetime , which typically does not exceed 5  10 myrs @xcite .",
    "that is consistent with the remarkably high content of massive ysos that we found in @xcite .",
    "this `` burst of star formation '' may be a consequence of the passage of the w51 gmc through the spiral arm .",
    "we observed the molecular clouds associated with the active star - forming complex w51 in the @xmath1co  and @xmath2co  @xmath0  lines with the hht .",
    "we summarize our results , combining the new co data of high sensitivity and resolution , together with _ spitzer _",
    "3.6 - 24  data :    \\1 .",
    "co emission in the 125 @xmath3 100 area divides into three velocity - components , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 km s@xmath4 .",
    "g49.4 - 0.3 and some clouds in the northwestern part of the map are associated with the lower velocity ( @xmath38 km s@xmath4 ) component .",
    "the main molecular clouds in the velocity range of 56 to 65 km s@xmath4  are distributed widely throughout the whole region . the higher velocity component ( @xmath98 km s@xmath4 ) shows an elongated filamentary structure from southeast to northwest .",
    "the average ratios of @xmath44 and @xmath45 of all regions are greater than the values outside the active star - forming regions , which implies that the molecular gas directly associated with the regions is dense and highly excited .",
    "we compare our co maps with _ spitzer _",
    "strong pah emission near regions seen in irac bands coincides with bright co emission , suggesting that those molecular clouds are associated with the regions .",
    "many ysos are detected in the dark parts near the regions on irac images .",
    "we argue that triggered star formation resulted from region expansion into clouds in the shell structure near w51a and in the region around g49.0 - 0.3 and g48.9 - 0.3 .",
    "we also present evidence of star formation triggered by cloud - cloud collisions in g49.5 - 0.4 and g49.17 - 0.21 .",
    "we estimate the total gas masses of the various interesting regions using an lvg analysis of @xmath1co  and @xmath2co  @xmath0  data . by comparing the total gas mass to total mass of ysos in w51a and w51b ,",
    "we find current yso formation efficiencies of 0.7% and 1.1% , respectively , within a timescale of @xmath99 yr during which massive stars ( @xmath100@xmath76 ) would be detected as ysos .",
    "the _ current _ rate of star formation in the w51 gmc should then be an order of magnitude higher than the rate averaged over an assumed cloud lifetime of @xmath101 yr , in order to convert 10% of the cloud mass to stars .",
    "we thank bon - chul koo for providing 21 cm radio continuum data .",
