    "the discovery of the narrow @xmath10 particles by babar @xcite and cleo @xcite and soon confirmed by belle @xcite immediately reminded people an effective theory approach proposed by nowak et al . and others @xcite .",
    "from this effective theory , they derived the goldberger - treiman relation for the mass gap between chiral partners @xmath11 and @xmath12 instead of the heavy meson mass itself and predicted the mass gap to be around @xmath13 mev , where @xmath14 is the coupling constant for @xmath15 and @xmath16 is the pion decay constant .",
    "since this mass gap between chiral partners in the case of @xmath1 agrees well with the experiments ( around 350 mev ) , people thought that underling physics may be explained by their @xmath17 effective lagrangian @xcite .",
    "however , when @xmath5 for @xmath0 meson were found by belle and focus , and later reanalyzed by cleo , their explanation needs to be modified .",
    "furthermore , what they originally predicted could not be identified as any of heavy meson multiplets for @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 . in other words ,",
    "the forumula can be applied equally for any of these heavy meson multiplets .",
    "thus , it is required to find the mass gap formula , if it exists , which agrees well with the experiments and explains the physical ground of its formula .    in this paper ,",
    "using our semirelativistic potential model , we first give our formula for the mass gap between chiral partners @xmath11 and @xmath12 for _ any _ heavy meson , @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 , among which the known mass gaps , i.e. , the ones for @xmath0 and @xmath1 , agree well with the experiments although there is some ambiguities for @xmath0 meson data .",
    "next we show how this mass gap depends on a light quark mass @xmath18 for @xmath19 , and @xmath20 , where we neglect the difference between @xmath21 and @xmath22 quarks .",
    "our formula naturally explain that the mass gap for @xmath0 is larger than that for @xmath1 and predict the mass gaps for @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "mass for the heavy meson @xmath23 with the spin and parity , @xmath24 , is expressed in our formulation as @xcite @xmath25 where the quantum number @xmath26 is related to the total angular momentum @xmath27 and the parity @xmath28 for a heavy meson as @xmath29 to begin with , we study the heavy meson mass without @xmath9 corrections so that we can see the essence of the mass gap",
    ". states with the same @xmath30 value are degenerate in a pure chiral limit and without confining scalar potential , which is defined as @xmath31 and @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "we consider the scenario that a chiral symmetry breaking and a confinement take place in two steps .",
    "first the degeneracy is broken due to gluon fields when @xmath33 is turned on and confines quarks into heavy mesons but keeping vanishing light quark mass intact .",
    "in fact , in this limit our model gives the mass gap between two spin multiplets @xmath34 mev as follows ; @xmath35 this gap is mainly due to gluon fields which confines quarks into heavy mesons .",
    "it is interesting that obtained values are close to @xmath36 .",
    "next , turning on a light quark mass which explicitly breaks a chiral symmetry , we have @xmath17 flavor breaking pattern of the mass levels , i.e. , mass of @xmath0 becomes different from that of @xmath1 with the same value of @xmath24 .",
    "since we assume @xmath37 , there still remains @xmath38 iso - spin symmetry .",
    "note that even after chiral symmetry is broken , there is still degeneracy between members of a spin multiplet due to the heavy quark symmetry , i.e. , @xmath39 symmetry , with @xmath40 rotational flavor symmetry and @xmath41 rotational spin symmetry . by using the optimal values of parameters in ref .",
    "@xcite , which is listed in table [ parameter ] , degenerate masses without @xmath9 corrections for @xmath42 and @xmath43 mesons are calculated and presented in table [ degmassgap ] . furthermore , by changing @xmath18 from 0 to 0.2 gev , we have calculated the @xmath18 dependence of @xmath44 and have obtained fig . [ fig - deltam ] , in which @xmath44 is linearly decreasing with @xmath18 . from fig .",
    "[ fig - deltam ] , we find that the mass gap between two spin multiplets for a heavy meson @xmath23 can be written as @xmath45 where the values of @xmath46 , and @xmath47 are estimated by fitting the optimal line with fig .",
    "[ fig - deltam ] . since both @xmath46 and @xmath47",
    "are very close to 1 , we conclude that the mass gap is essentially given by @xmath48 though the physical ground of this result is out of scope at present , eq .",
    "( [ massgap ] ) is serious , since it is very different from the one of an effective theory approach which gives the relation , @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the yukawa coupling constant between the heavy meson and a chiral multiplet and is taken to be @xmath51 in @xcite , and @xmath52 .",
    "this expression is obtained in the heavy quark symmetric limit and should be compared with our eq .",
    "( [ massgap ] ) . instead of minus sign for the term @xmath18 that we obtained ,",
    "the authors of @xcite obtained plus sign as shown in the above equation .",
    "the same result is obtained even if we use the nonlinear @xmath53 model @xcite . the result given by eq .",
    "( [ massgap ] ) is exact when @xmath54 terms are neglected . as we will see later , since @xmath9 corrections are nearly equal to each other for two spin doublets , the above equation ( [ massgap ] ) between two spin multiplets holds approximately even with @xmath9 corrections .     and the vertical axis is the mass gap . both the heavy quark limit @xmath44 ( left ) and the one with @xmath9 corrections @xmath55(right ) are given.,title=\"fig : \" ]   and the vertical axis is the mass gap",
