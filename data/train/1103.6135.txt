    "gaussianity and statistical homogeneity and isotropy of the cmb are essential for determining the most optimal values of the cosmological parameters in the framework of the @xmath0 concordance model .",
    "it is remarkable , that recently obtained data by wmap , boomerang , maxima , cbi etc . clearly demonstrate a consistency between theoretically predicted and observed properties of the cmb anisotropy power spectrum(@xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "however , detailed investigations of the statistical properties of the cmb signal reveal a significant deviation from gaussianity and statistical isotropy of the cmb ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , which can be related to the foreground residuals ( @xcite , @xcite ) , systematic effects ( @xcite ) , or it could even have primordial origin ( for instance the primordial magnetic field , texture or a non - trivial topology of the universe ) .",
    "the important task of investigating the departure from statistical isotropy and gaussianity of the cmb , requires designed tests , which can clarify the possible sources of `` contamination '' in the results , derived from the cmb signal .",
    "most of these tests are based on the cmb map , which require a good quality of data reduction , including a high quality of the calibrations , correction of the antenna beam and pixelization uncertainties and a reduction of the residuals of the point - like sources and diffusion foregrounds ( and even the incorporation of the uncounted ones , like spinning dust or even the refracting debris of the kuiper belt @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast , recently proposed in @xcite , @xcite , a parity test only requires the power spectrum , which is usually estimated with an accuracy significantly better than the cmb map .",
    "recently , ideas has been put forth , to explain the observed parity asymmetry , see for instance @xcite and @xcite .",
    "also @xcite has commented on the possibility of biased maps , which might also contribute to parity asymmetry .",
    "+ the idea of our test is based on the analysis of the ratio @xmath1 of the powers stored in even and odd multipoles . for a statistically homogeneous and isotropic random cmb , @xmath1 should be equally distributed around @xmath2 .",
    "this assumption is applicable only , if the theoretical power spectrum @xmath3 of the primordial fluctuations , has a monotonic shape without any oscillations of the corresponding scale @xmath4 .",
    "the monotonic shape of the power spectrum is typical for the simplest models of inflation , when the slow roll approximation is valid , until the epoch of reheating .",
    "however , in more complicated models ( for instance in @xcite ) , the slow roll regime of inflation could be broken in the vicinity of some points @xmath5 , leading to spatial modulations of the power spectrum for adiabatic perturbations of the metric without departure from gaussianity . in this case parity test",
    "can be used as indicator of non - trivial regimes of inflation . additionally , we present a directional parity test @xmath6 , similar to to the ratio @xmath1 .",
    "this also tests the power stored in even and odd multipoles , but it is based on the directional statistic @xmath7 originally introduced by @xcite .",
    "the directional parity test @xmath6 should also be equally distributed around @xmath8 .",
    "we would like to focus our attention on an extension of the parity test for a very broad range of multipole numbers @xmath9 for the whole - sky cmb map , taking under consideration the phases @xmath10 of the corresponding coefficients @xmath11 of the spherical harmonic decomposition .",
    "the phases @xmath10 carries much of the information about the angular distribution of the temperature anisotropy on the sky and possible correlations between different multipoles . moreover , if the parity asymmetry of the power spectrum reflects possible departure from statistical isotropy of the cmb , the phases @xmath10 should have the same type of asymmetry .",
    "previously , @xcite and @xcite has investigated the phases , and has further found evidence for hemispherical asymmetry @xcite , @xcite .    the outline of the paper is the following . in section 1",
    "we introduce the basic characteristics of the power and phases asymmetry . for the phases we will use the mean angle approach , proposed in @xcite for even and odd multipoles and",
    "show that there is strong departure from statistical isotropy . in section 2",
    ", we introduce the directional parity test .",
    "section 3 takes a look on the alignment of mean angles , for low @xmath9 .",
    "section 4 is devoted to the random walk of the phases , in both galactic and ecliptic coordinates .",
    "in section 5 we present the results of the directional parity test , for ecliptic and galactic coordinates .",
    "finally in section 6 we discuss the findings and draw our conclusions .",
    "the temperature fluctuations on the sphere @xmath12 can be decomposed into spherical harmonics in the following standard way : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a unit vector , pointing in the direction of the polar @xmath15 and azimuthal @xmath16 angles , @xmath17 is the coefficient of decomposition : @xmath18 , with @xmath10 as the phase .",
    "+ under the assumption of total gaussian randomness , as predicted by the simplest inflationary model , the amplitudes @xmath19 follow the rayleigh s pdf and phases of @xmath11 are supposed to be evenly distributed in the range @xmath20 $ ] @xcite .    for any signals @xmath21 on the sphere",
    ", one can define the symmetric ( @xmath22 ) and asymmetric ( @xmath23 ) components @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "+ by definition , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are orthogonal , which means that the average over the whole sphere corresponds to @xmath29 and that the power spectrum of @xmath21 is given by @xmath30 which is associated with power spectrum of even ( @xmath31 ) and odd ( @xmath32 ) multipoles respectively . for the concordance @xmath33cdm cosmological model with initial gaussian adiabatic perturbations",
    ", we do not expect any features distinct between even and odd multipoles .",
    "however , taking the wmap7 data as a platform for investigation of the parity of the cmb , there have been reported power contrast between even and odd multipoles of wmap @xmath34 power spectrum ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the corresponding estimator for `` even and odd '' asymmetry of the cmb power spectrum is given by@xcite @xmath35 the @xmath1-statistic is a cumulative statistic , but it is the most practical approach to testing for asymmetry between even and odd multipoles .",
    "the problem is , that we can not make a comparison for a single l , as either the odd or even component would be zero . an alternative could be to compare multipoles of a separation of @xmath8 for instance , i.e. compare an odd multipole with its even neighbor , however we would have to decide what neighbor to compare to ( @xmath9 and @xmath36 , or @xmath9 and @xmath37 ) , and the choice would be an arbitrary one . in @xcite",
    "they performed a test for neighboring @xmath38 s , comparing @xmath9 and @xmath37 .",
    "we tested that method also , and found that it did not work as well as eq .",
    "[ par_est ] for our specific purposes , and thus we kept the @xmath1-statistics as introduced by @xcite . +",
    "a at lowest multipoles ( @xmath39 ) , there is reported odd multipole preference ( i.e. power excess in odd multipoles and deficit in even multipoles ) ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "note that due to rotational invariance of @xmath1 , the corresponding parity asymmetry does not depend on the reference system of coordinates .",
    "however , additional information about the statistical properties of the temperature fluctuations is associated with the odd and even components of the phases @xmath10 , which are rotationally non - invariant .",
    "this is why the analysis of the cmb phases @xmath10 , for different systems of coordinates seems to be extremely important for determining the origin of the cmb parity asymmetry . + the phases carry information about the orientation of the spherical harmonic components , to make them fit the observed microwave radiation . in order to check the statistical anisotropy of the phases @xmath10 for @xmath40 and @xmath41",
    ", we will use the trigonometric moments : @xmath42 the mean angle of the given multipole , @xmath9 , is the arc+tangent to the ratio between the average @xmath43 and @xmath44 value for the multipole : @xmath45 the reason for the above procedures for finding the mean angle , is that we are dealing with circular data and thus a simple average over the phases is not enough .",
    "instead we must convert the angles to points on the unit circle via @xmath43/@xmath44 , and find the arithmetic mean of these points ( eq .",
    "[ si_org ] ) .",
    "this mean is then converted back to polar coordinates via arctan ( eq . [ mean_angle ] ) to give us the mean angle for the considered multipole .",
    "thus we have greatly compacted the information of the cmb phases , by creating a single mean angle , for each multipole .",
    "further details about the procedures above can be found in @xcite .",
    "+ we would expect , that the mean angles for the multipoles would distribute themselves evenly in the range from @xmath46 to @xmath47 , as required by a gaussian random field @xcite .",
    "moreover , for a statistical homogeneous and isotropic random gaussian field generated by primordial perturbations , the uniformity of the distribution of phases leads to a uniformity of the distribution of mean angles @xmath48 for even and odd @xmath9 .",
    "+ for testing the equivalence of the odd and even multipoles in the space of phases , we will use the following estimators : @xmath49 ^ 2+[r^{\\pm}_c(l)]^2\\right\\},\\hspace{0.5 cm } r^{\\pm}_s(l_{max})=\\sum_{l=2}^{l_{max}}\\sin\\theta^{\\pm}(l),\\hspace{0.5 cm } r^{\\pm}_c(l_{max})=\\sum_{l=2}^{l_{max}}\\cos\\theta^{\\pm}(l),\\hspace{0.5 cm } l\\ge 3.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath50 is the mean angle for even multipoles , @xmath51 is the mean angle for the odd , and the corresponding sum is defined for @xmath52 and @xmath53 for @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "after simple algebra , eq([m_a ] ) gives us the following expression for the function @xmath54 : @xmath55 from eq([r_a ] ) one can see , that for non - correlated mean angles @xmath56 the last term can be estimated as @xmath57 for @xmath58 , and thus asymptotically @xmath59 ( see for details @xcite ) .",
    "actually , @xmath54 is well known in the theory of statistical analysis of circular data ( see for instance , @xcite ) . the important generalization of this test , is that it will be applied for odd and even multipoles separately , describing a random walk of the mean angles in the space of phases .",
    "+ if the mean angles for given multipoles @xmath56 are close to each other ( @xmath60 ) , the second term in eq([r_a ] ) is comparable with the first one . for the wmap cmb map this effect",
    "is well known for the quadrupole and the octopole , as alignment . however , in the next section , we will show that the quadropole / octopole alignment is not unique .",
    "it is detected for @xmath61 mean angles ( even - odd multipole correlations ) in the galactic system of coordinates , and especially , for @xmath62 in ecliptic coordinates ( see fig [ figure_mean_angle ] ) .",
    "thus the parity test of the mean angles @xmath48 needs to be taken under consideration as a complimentary test to the parity asymmetry of the power spectrum , in order to clarify the origin of these anomalies in the cmb .",
    "historically , investigation of the low multipole anomalies of the cmb signal by rotationally non - invariant ( directional ) statistic was proposed in @xcite .",
    "the estimator of the preferable direction @xmath63 , which maximize the angular momentum(@xmath64 ) dispersion , can be defined as @xmath65 where the @xmath63 is selected , so that the term @xmath66 has the maximum value .",
    "+ actually , one can define the same estimator , as eq([teg ] ) , for the map of gradient in azimuthal direction @xmath67 for a given system of coordinates with @xmath68-axis along the vector @xmath63 .",
    "then , based on the eq([teg ] ) , we can find the direction of maximal parity asymmetry of the cmb , for the considered directions , specified by @xmath63 , just by replacing @xmath69 with this new @xmath70 in eq([par_est ] ) , to get the following : @xmath71 in other words , an estimator precisely as eq([par_est ] ) , just using @xmath70 instead of @xmath3 , for selected values of @xmath63 . in this work",
    ", we only test for two @xmath63 s , the one corresponding to galactic coordinates , and the one corresponding to ecliptic .    for implementation of the parity test we use the internal linear combination ( ilc7 ) map .",
