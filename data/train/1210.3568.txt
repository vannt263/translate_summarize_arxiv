    "@xcite noted that the maximum luminosity of the 2012a event is consistent with the luminosity of a faint sn iip @xcite , although with a faster evolving light curve . along with spectral similarities ,",
    "this led @xcite to suggest that the 2012a event was the true core - collapse sn event of the lbv star .",
    "we confirm that the bolometric luminosity of the 2012a event is similar to sn 2005cs , as one can note from figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "the subsequent faster rise to the second peak ( the 2012b event ) presents an even tighter similarity with that of the type iin / iil sn 1998s .",
    "the 2012b event was proposed by @xcite to be due to strong sn ejecta - csm interaction .",
    "we measure a 2 week long rise - time , reaching a peak apparent magnitude of b = 13.80 ( r = 13.65 ) on october 6 , 2012 and then it declines in luminosity , more rapidly in the ultra - violet and the blue optical bands .",
    "we will see in section [ discussion ] that the 2012a and 2012b sequence of events may have an alternative explanation .",
    "we also remark that none of the comparison objects in figure [ fig2 ] shows the regular , sn - like light curve that characterized sn 2009ip during the 2012b event .",
    "this late photometric evolution combined with the bright luminous peak ( m@xmath17 -18 ) may support the claim that _ at least _ during the 2012b event sn 2009ip has finally exploded as a real supernova .",
    "we note that the color of sn 2009ip at the light curve peak ( on october 6 , 2012 ) is u - v @xmath6 -1 mag , significantly bluer than that of the 2012a event at maximum ( u - v @xmath6 -0.5 mag ) . at the pre - burst minimum of september 23 , the u - v color was instead significantly redder , i.e. @xmath6 0 mag .",
    "optical and near - infrared spectra of sn 2009ip ( figures [ fig4 ] , [ fig5 ] , [ fig6 ] and [ fig7 ] ; the log of observations is in appendix ) were collected using the 8.2-m very large telescope ( vlt ) ut1 ( + fors ) and ut2 ( + xshooter ) at the cerro paranal observatory ( eso chile ) , the 3.58-m eso - ntt ( + efosc2 and sofi ) at the la silla observatory ( eso chile ) , the 8.2-m gemini south telescope ( with gmos ) in cerro pachn ( chile ) , the 3.58-m telescopio nazionale galileo ( tng , equipped with lrs ) , the 4.2-m william herschel telescope ( wht , with isis ) and the 2.56-m nordic optical telescope ( + alfosc ) located in la palma ( canary islands , spain ) .",
    "the spectra relative to the 2009 outburst reported in figure [ fig4 ] are all dominated by prominent balmer lines with a complex profile .",
    "the weak absorption features indicate that the bulk of the ejected material is moving with a velocity of 2900 @xmath9 700 km s@xmath2 , but the blue edge of the isolated h@xmath18 absorption suggests the presence of fast - moving material which is expanding at a velocity of about 5000 - 6000 km s@xmath2 .",
    "the h@xmath19 emission component in september 2009 has a lorentzian profile with a fwhm velocity of about 700 - 800 km s@xmath2 , which increases to about 1100 - 1200 km s@xmath2 during the period october - november , 2009 ( when the object was receding to a more quiescent stage ) .    after a further outburst ( september 2010 ) reported by @xcite , a spectrum obtained on october 6 , 2010 shows sn 2009ip at a similar stage as the november 24 , 2009 spectrum , i.e. with the star again quiescent .",
    "the fwhm velocity of the lorentzian h@xmath19 component in this phase is still around 1300 km s@xmath2 .",
    "the september 2 , 2011 vlt spectrum reported at the bottom of figure [ fig4 ] shows sn 2009ip to be back to a dormant stage , and the fwhm velocity of the lorentzian h@xmath19 component is about 940 km s@xmath2 .",
    "figure [ fig5 ] shows the spectra of the transient during the period august - october 2012 , compared with a vlt spectrum obtained on september 24 , 2011 ( green line ) , during another outburst episode . in the september 24 , 2011 spectrum , the fwhm velocity of h@xmath19 , which still has a lorentzian profile ,",
    "has slightly decreased to around 790 km s@xmath2 , and other balmer lines clearly show very broad absorption components , with a blue edge that indicates that there is material moving with a velocity as high as 12500 km s@xmath2 _ already _ at this epoch ( see also figure [ fig6 ] ) .",
    "this is the highest velocity outflow that has been detected in an lbv - like eruption of any sort and indicates that high velocities are observed without core - collapse or the catastrophic destruction of the star .",
    "this has important consequences for the interpretation of high velocity ejecta as evidence for the core - collapse mechanism in the 2012a event .",
    "we subsequently obtained an ntt spectrum on august 8 , 2012 ( jd = 2456148.91 , i.e. 10 days before the new outburst - the 2012a event - was announced by * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the broad absorption features were present also at this epoch , and indeed were stronger than in the september 24 , 2011 spectrum ( figure [ fig5 ] ) .",
    "the minimum of the broad absorption components of the balmer lines has a core at 8600 @xmath9 400 km s@xmath2 , with a blue wing extending up to 14000 km s@xmath2 , while the lorentzian emission survives at a fwhm velocity of about 1380 km s@xmath2 .",
    "the presence of these components was observed in september 15 and 16 , 2012 spectra by @xcite , and this was the critical measurement that led the authors to propose that the lbv had exploded as a core - collapse sn , i.e. that the 2012a event was due to stellar core - collapse and an explosion with fairly low kinetic energy like sn 2005cs .",
    "our spectra collected between august 18 and september 5 , 2012 show little evolution : the h features show prominent p - cygni profiles , with deep minima at 8000 - 9000 km s@xmath2 and edges possibly extending to 14000 - 15000 km s@xmath2 .",
    "the h@xmath19 narrow emission component still has a fwhm velocity of 800 @xmath9 100 km s@xmath2 , while the highest resolution spectra allow us to measure the fwhm velocity from the clearly detected narrow fe ii emissions ( multiplet 42 ) to be about 240 @xmath9 20 km s@xmath2 .",
    "as highlighted by @xcite , the spectra from september 10 to 23 ( 2012a event ) do closely resemble those of type ii sne ( the similarity with early spectra of the under - luminous type iip sn 2005cs shown in their figure 2 is remarkable ) .",
    "both h and fe ii lines now show broad p - cygni profiles with a prominent broad emission component .",
    "however we now present spectra of the 2012a event covering a period from august 8 , 2012 to september 23 , 2012 ( 47 days ) , and we do not observe the typical evolution of a type ii sn over this period . in particular , 15 - 20 days after explosion , type ii - p sne develop the strong , broad near - infrared ca ii triplet feature @xcite , but we do nt observe this for the 2012a event .",
    "the cores of the absorptions of the balmer features indicate expansion velocity of the ejected material of @xmath0 5000 - 6000 km s@xmath2 ( 4200 @xmath9 500 km s@xmath2 from the fe ii lines ) , but the blue edge of the wings still reach to much higher velocities ( about 13800 km s@xmath2 ) .",
    "figure [ fig6 ] ( top ) shows a comparison of sn 2009ip at 3 representative epochs ( september 24 , 2011 ; august 8 and september 28 , 2012 ) with a spectrum of ngc 3432-lbv1 in outburst ( april 24 2009 ) .",
    "the high velocity p - cygni absorption ( in the balmer lines ) is certainly stronger in the 2012a event than we observed in 2011 and in ngc3432-lbv1 in outburst , but we illustrate here that the detection of high velocity gas is not only restricted to core - collapse sne .",
    "similar high velocity edges are clearly detected in sn 2009ip in 2011 ( 13800 km s@xmath2 ) and in ngc3432-lbv1 ( @xmath09000 km s@xmath2 , * ? ? ?",
    "we will discuss the implications of this in section [ discussion ] .",
    "these broad absorptions disappear at the time of the 2012b event , in september 28 and october 4 spectra ( figures [ fig5 ] @xmath20 [ fig6 ] , top ) , when the luminosity of sn 2009ip reaches the unprecedented maximum . at these times , the spectra are very similar to those of many type iin sne ( e.g. sn 1999el , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with the h lines presenting a narrow emission component with a fwhm velocity of about 290 km s@xmath2 and very broad wings ( @xmath03600 km s@xmath2 ) .",
    "similar velocities are measured in the he i lines , which are now more prominent than in past spectra , whilst the fe ii lines are no longer visible .",
    "the spectrum of sn 2009ip obtained on 25 september 2009 with vlt - ut1 equipped with fors2 has a very high signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "this gives us the opportunity to identify the most important lines in the spectrum of sn 2009ip ( figure [ fig6 ] , bottom ) .",
    "the spectrum is dominated by strong balmer and paschen lines of h , showing weak and narrow ( 2850 @xmath9 490 km s@xmath2 ) p - cygni profiles .",
    "weak he i lines ( being the 5876   feature blended with na i d 5890 - 5896  ) and a number of fe ii multiplet lines are also detected .",
    "we note that in the september 28 , 2012 spectrum of sn 2009ip ( during the 2012b outburst , figure [ fig6 ] ) , the spectral properties are quite similar to those observed in the afore - mentioned vlt spectrum , although the detection of fe ii lines is not obvious .",
    "most of these lines are also visible in the spectrum of the impostor ngc3432-lbv1 shown as a comparison , with quite similar velocity of the narrow components ( @xmath21 650 km s@xmath2 ) .",
    "narrow o i and ca ii lines are relatively prominent in sn 2009ip , while they were not unambiguously detected in ngc 3432-lbv1 ( although this might be due to the lower signal - to - noise spectrum ) .    a sequence of near - infrared spectra of sn 2009ip is shown in figure [ fig7 ] .",
    "the continuum is always quite blue in these spectra .",
    "the strongest lines are detected as broad features with p - cygni profiles , and narrower emissions superimposed to the broad components .",
    "the broad p - cygni components become more evident with time and in the september 23 , 2012 spectrum ( at the time of the onset of the 2012b eruption ) they dominate over the narrow lines .",
    "we identify br @xmath22 at 2165 nm , pa @xmath19 ( that is barely visible in the middle of the telluric absorption around 1875 nm ) , pa @xmath18 at 1282 nm and pa @xmath22 at 1094 nm , blended with he i 1083 nm .",
    "the september 23 , 2012 spectrum , in particular , shows a broad pa @xmath18 with fwhm velocity of about 6200 km s@xmath2 and a prominent blue - shifted absorption of pa @xmath22 + he i 1083 nm with an expansion velocity of about 10000 km s@xmath2 , as obtained from the position of the broad absorption minimum .",
    "the narrow he i 1083 nm line , which was marginally detectable in previous spectra , is now clearly visible , and is well separated from pa @xmath22 .",
    "the narrow paschen lines have lorentzian profiles with a fwhm velocity of about 400 km s@xmath2 , whilst the narrow he i @xmath23 1083 nm appears to be slightly broader ( @xmath0800 - 1000 km s@xmath2 ) and with a roughly gaussian profile .",
    "sn 2009ip is a remarkable object for a number of reasons : * i ) * it experienced a series of energetic outbursts since 2009 , when the transient reached absolute peak magnitudes between -14 and -15 ; * ii ) * the spectral features reveal the presence of ejected material at very high velocities ( several @xmath14 10@xmath24 km s@xmath2 ) ; * iii ) * the progenitor star was observed to be extremely luminous in quiescence ( m@xmath25 = -10.0 @xmath9 0.3 ) and was proposed to be a massive lbv ( @xmath4 60 m@xmath8 , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; * iv ) * finally , in september 2012 the star displayed a further , exceptionally luminous outburst ( the 2012b event , with m@xmath25 @xmath6 -18 , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , suggesting that the lbv may have experienced a core - collapse sn explosion .",
    "the luminosity during that event , and its similarity to sne iin spectra are possibly the strongest indicators that a core - collapse sn has occurred , more so than the broad lines of the spectra during the 2012a pre - cursor event .",
    "the complex , erratic 2009 - 2012 light curve of sn 2009ip ( section [ photo ] ) indicates that the lbv entered a very active variability phase resembling those of the unusual ngc 3432-lbv1 or @xmath10 carinae during the giant eruption of the 19th century . in the case of ngc 3432-lbv1 , multiple eruptions on short time scales ( about 200 - 220 days ) have been proposed to be the result of violent pulses of a very massive star ( possibly via the pulsational pair - instability mechanism ) that is approaching the end of its life , presumably with the core - collapse .",
    "alternatively , the pulses may be regulated by the passage of a companion star to the periastron @xcite .",
    "the presence of very fast material ( @xmath26 km s@xmath2 ) in sn 2009ip _ already almost 1 year before the putative sn explosion ( i.e. in the 24th september 2011 spectrum ) _ , and also in ngc 3432-lbv1 ( @xmath27 km s@xmath2 ) suggests that these lbv related eruptions could quite feasibly be linked with the 2012a event . the highest velocity in the homunculus nebula surrounding @xmath10 carinae reaches @xmath28 km s@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "typical lbv eruptions are discussed in terms of extreme stellar winds driven by the super - eddington luminosity of the star . however , these winds are expected to have velocities of the order of a few @xmath14 10@xmath29 km s@xmath2 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the detection of this high - velocity gas in some lbv outbursts ( including the afore - mentioned events ) suggests that these episodes probably originate in explosions deeper in the star , perhaps in the core .",
    "these release an energy that may compete with those of weak sne ( e.g. faint sne iip , such as sn 1999br , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , producing a blast wave that allows the star to expel massive portions of the envelope @xcite .",
    "all of this is expected to produce transients that closely mimic the energy and the overall properties of a real sn exploding in a dense csm ( type iin ) .",
    "one of the most remarkable findings inferred from the analysis of the august and early september spectra of sn 2009ip ( during the 2012a event ) is that the bulk of the ejected material has extremely high expansion velocities ( 8000 - 9000 km s@xmath2 , with edges extending up to 14000 km s@xmath2 , see section [ spectra ] , and * ? ? ?",
    "this , and the striking similarity between the early september spectra of sn 2009ip and those of the weak type iip sn 2005cs @xcite led @xcite to conclude that sn 2009ip had likely exploded as a faint , @xmath30ni - poor core - collapse sn during the august re - brightening episode .",
    "the fact that we can observe features from the sn ejecta inside an extended and dense csm is explained with a non homogeneous , possibly clumpy distribution of the material lost by the lbv in pulsations preceding the explosion .",
    "while this is plausible , we would caution that the detection of high - velocity ejecta can not be regarded as a conclusive proof , because very high velocity material was also observed in ngc 3432-lbv1 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* where the broad wing of the h@xmath18 absorption extended to 9000 km s@xmath2 ) , during an eruption of a known sn impostor .",
    "the core - collapse sn scenario proposed by @xcite is unlikely , since there is a number of observables that require a rather ad - hoc combination of events : * i ) * the high - velocity absorption wings measured in the spectra obtained after the announcement of the 2012a outburst episode @xcite are actually similar to those we have seen in the september 24 , 2011 and august 8 , 2012 spectra , which raises the question whether and in case when the sn explosion occurred ; * ii ) * the peak absolute magnitude ( m@xmath31 -15 ) and the evolutionary timescales of the 2012a event are consistent with those of previous eruptive episodes ( in particular the 2009 event , see figure [ fig2 ] ) ; finally * iii ) * it is not trivial to explain how an extremely massive lbv ( m@xmath460 m@xmath8 , likely with m@xmath32 90 - 100 m@xmath8 ) can explode as a weak type ii sn : we may need to invoke sub - sequent eruptions to explain the events before july - august 2012 , and subsequently a fall - back core - collapse sn with formation of a black hole .    in the @xcite interpretation ,",
    "the 2012b event is fairly simply explained as core - collapse sn ejecta - csm interaction .",
    "however it is also plausible that the 2012a event was an eruptive phase , and the 2012b luminosity comes from the actual core - collapse , similar to what is assumed to occur in iin sne , or even from the collision of material ejected in the previous eruption with pre - existing csm .",
    "the detection of high velocity ejecta ( 12500 km s@xmath2 ) on september 24 , 2011 indicates that the star has managed to eject material at velocities that we would normally associate with a sn explosion .",
    "it is very unlikely that the core collapsed at this point ( see section [ noccsn ] ) , which implies that the high velocity material has been ejected in the 2012a event without invoking a core - collapse sn explosion .",
    "what triggers these ejections is still unclear , but the very high progenitor mass @xcite indicates that the events may be signatures of pulsational pair - instability @xcite .",
    "this is apparently above the mass proposed for the precursor of sn 2009ip .",
    "we note , however , that the absolute magnitude of the lbv progenitor of sn 2009ip ( see e.g. figure 3 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is also consistent with evolutionary tracks of stellar masses that are much higher than 60 m@xmath8 , that has to be regarded as a lower mass limit . ] .",
    "the @xcite model of a pulsational pair - instability sn suggests that colliding shells of material can dissipate most of the relative kinetic energy as radiation .",
    "one solar mass of material moving at 8000 km s@xmath2 has a kinetic energy of more than @xmath33erg , enough to power the measured bolometric light curve of the 2012b event shown in figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "as sn 2009ip has experienced multiple mass ejections , perhaps even more than those we have detected due to possible gaps in the observational coverage ( figure [ fig2 ] ) , it is plausible there are shells , or clumps of slower moving gas that will slow the fast ejecta of 2009ip during the 2012a episode .    as discussed in @xcite ,",
    "there are no known line - driven wind mechanism or continuum driven wind mechanism for driving material off the stellar surface at the high velocities observed .",
    "the energy to provide @xmath34erg per solar mass ejected must presumably come from a core - related event .",
    "there is also some consistency in the velocity of the material ejected during the 2012a event and the radius of the emitting region in the 2012b episode .",
    "the 2012a event lasts approximately 50 days , during which the bulk of material starts at 8000 - 9000 km s@xmath2 on 5 september 2012 , slowing to 5000 - 6000 km s@xmath2 after about 10 days .",
    "the fast ejecta likely travelled around @xmath35r@xmath8 , before impacting on a surrounding shell and causing the dramatic increase in luminosity in the rise to the 2012b light curve peak .",
    "if the kinetic energy of the shell is then converted into radiative energy , one would expect that an emitting sphere of radius @xmath35r@xmath8  at a black - body temperature of around 10000 k would emit at @xmath36 a few @xmath37ergs@xmath2 .",
    "this crude luminosity estimate is of the same order of magnitude to that we see in figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "the pulsational pair - instability sn model requires a star of initial mass to be in the range 95 - 130 m@xmath8 .",
    "the standard mass - loss prescriptions for such massive stars has to be relaxed so that in the final stages the star should retain enough mass to enhance the core temperature to cause the pair - instability .",
    "the progenitor has been estimated to have more than 60 m@xmath8 , implying that has retained most of its envelope .",
    "this is supported by the evidence that broad hydrogen features are detected in all the ejection episodes ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* see also section [ spectra ] )",
    ". an interesting measurement would be the metallicity at the distance of sn 2009ip from the host galaxy nucleus ( about 4kpc ) to determine if it is significantly metal poor . at the current stage ,",
    "only a statistical approach is possible to estimate the local oxygen abundance . adopting the host galaxy distance and reddening of @xcite ,",
    "the host galaxy has an absolute b - band magnitude of -17.9 .",
    "following @xcite , the characteristic ( at r = 0.4r@xmath38 ) oxygen abundance of ngc 7259 would be 12 + log(o / h ) = 8.34 , which gives 12 + log(o / h ) = 8.07 at the sn position , clearly sub - solar .    as a consequence",
    ", a pulsational pair - instability scenario may provide a plausible explanation for the 2012 events , without necessarily invoking the core - collapse of the star . according to this ,",
    "the 2012a event may have been a pulsational pair - instability eruption followed by collisions of these ejecta with pre - existing csm .",
    "the late september - early october spectra of sn 2009ip , again dominated by narrow lines with lorentzian profiles , indicate that the high - velocity material is covered by electron scattering in a high - density interaction shell @xcite .",
    "we note that , as mentioned in section [ intro ] , there is no robust x - ray or radio detection of sn 2009ip .",
    "although this would not support strong ejecta - csm interaction , it does not necessarily rule it out . according to the pulsational pair - instability scenario , the star s core is slowly contracting and is finally expected to become a real core - collapse supernova ( within a few years ) with a potentially very luminous display @xcite .",
    "the photometric comparison between sn 2009ip and sn 1961v shown in figure [ fig2 ] , including the major eruption when sn 1961v reached an absolute peak magnitude of above -17 , and the spectra @xcite dominated by relatively narrow h lines , suggest a close similarity between these two transients , hence supporting the statement that sn 1961v may have been another pulsational - pair instability sn .",
    "sn 1961v had a very troublesome genesis .",
    "for many years , from 1937 to 1954 , its quiescent progenitor was the most luminous star in the host galaxy , ngc 1058 .",
    "it had an apparent photographic magnitude of 18 ( * ? ? ? * corresponding to an absolute mag m@xmath39 -12 ) . with this luminosity ,",
    "the star -likely an lbv- had an estimated m@xmath7 80 m@xmath8 ( adopting metallicities from 1/3 to 1 z@xmath8 , * ? ? ?",
    ". then the object was observed at a constant magnitude of about 14.1 - 14.3 from july 1961 to november 1961 , and finally rose to a sharp maximum at mag @xmath6 13 on december 11 , 1961 @xcite .",
    "the peak was followed by a complex luminosity decline , which lasted for a few years with highly variable slopes ( see figure [ fig2 ] ) .    the nature of this transient has been widely debated , and independent studies gave contradictory results on its real nature ( genuine sn or sn impostor ; see discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "on the one hand , some authors state that a post - outburst surviving star ( known as  object 7  , see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) is visible in hst optical archival images .",
    "the december 1961 light curve peak and the fluctuations in the post - maximum luminosity decline of sn 1961v could have been be produced by strong interaction between fast - moving , high - density material produced in an eruptive episode before 1961 with a lower - density , pre - existent circumstellar shell , without the need of a proper sn explosion , as also suggested by @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , on the basis of the lack of sufficient infrared emission from the survived putative progenitor , @xcite proposed that sn 1961v had effectively exploded as a real sn , and its unusual observed properties could be explained via the ejecta interacting with a dense circumstellar medium .",
    "even after half a century from the outburst , we can only speculate about the nature of sn 1961v , without giving definitive answers .",
    "many years after that event , we tackle an analogous situation .",
    "2009ip shares many strong similarities with sn 1961v , and the available information collected for sn 2009ip so far favor the pulsational pair - instability scenario of an extremely massive lbv . whether the star has ended its life in the final core - collapse sn explosion , or the 2012b re - brightening event was due to shell - shell collisions is not known yet .",
    "only long term monitoring of this erupting lbv will perhaps unveil its fate .",
    "given this spectacular latest event , it would seem incumbent upon us to secure long - term monitoring campaigns ( spectroscopy and imaging from both targeted and archival work ) to track the variability history of the sn impostors .",
    "these long term campaigns are probably the most fruitful method to understanding the mechanisms that cause the unpredictable variability and determine the fate of lbvs , the most massive stars in the local universe .",
    "sn 2009ip should be one of best studied transient events in history . already , the data collected on the progenitor star outstrips all the information we have on all other sn progenitors to date .",
    "we are grateful to l. girardi for useful discussions .",

    "<S> we report the results of a 3 year - long dedicated monitoring campaign of a restless luminous blue variable ( lbv ) in ngc 7259 . </S>",
    "<S> the object , named sn 2009ip , was observed photometrically and spectroscopically in the optical and near - infrared domains . </S>",
    "<S> we monitored a number of erupting episodes in the past few years , and increased the density of our observations during eruptive episodes . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we present the full historical data set from 2009 - 2012 with multi - wavelength dense coverage of the two high luminosity events between august - september 2012 . </S>",
    "<S> we construct bolometric light curves and measure the total luminosities of these eruptive or explosive events . </S>",
    "<S> we label them the 2012a event ( lasting @xmath050 days ) with a peak of @xmath1ergs@xmath2 , and the 2012b event ( 14 day rise time , still ongoing ) with a peak of @xmath3 ergs@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the latter event has reached an absolute r - band magnitude of about -18 , comparable in brightness and luminosity to that of a core - collapse supernova ( sn ) . </S>",
    "<S> our historical monitoring has detected high - velocity spectral features ( @xmath013000 km s@xmath2 ) in september 2011 , one year before the current sn - like event . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that the detection of such high velocity outflows can not , conclusively , point to a core - collapse sn origin . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that the initial peak in the 2012a event was unlikely to be due to a faint core - collapse sn . </S>",
    "<S> we propose that the high intrinsic luminosity of the latest peak , the variability history of sn 2009ip , and the detection of broad spectral lines indicative of high - velocity ejecta are consistent with a pulsational pair - instability event , in which the star may have survived the last outburst . </S>",
    "<S> the question of the survival of the lbv progenitor star and its future fate remain open issues , only to be answered with future monitoring of this historically unique explosion . </S>"
