    "this paper presents an analysis of the projected capability of a detector design , heron @xcite , based on a target material of superfluid helium to make a precise measurement of both the  and 7 solar neutrino fluxes ( and , resp . ) in a single , real - time experiment .",
    "the detection reaction used would be the elastic scattering of neutrinos by electrons ( es ) .",
    "in addition to the novel use of helium , the detector also includes the novel application of a coded aperture @xcite technique for accurate measurement of the location and recoil energy of each elastic scattering event and to aid in background discrimination . according to models of the sun @xcite , the neutrinos from the -i and -ii branches of the fusion chain ( known as the  and 7 neutrinos , respectively )",
    "are , when taken together , @xmath2 of the neutrino flux and are associated with the reactions producing a similar fraction of the solar energy . at the present writing",
    "there have been no real - time experiments to measure the flux and spectra of but recently the borexino collaboration has made the first real - time spectral detection of ( @xmath3 ) @xcite . as we explain in sec .",
    "[ sec : goal ] there are several important physics issues which can be addressed if a detector can be constructed to measure both these fluxes and spectra with sufficient precision . for the  neutrinos ( @xmath4kev ) there does not yet exist any detector with demonstrated feasibility to measure either their flux or spectra ; however , there are a number of efforts @xcite which aim to do so .",
    "section  2 of this paper discusses the physics goals motivating the heron detector .",
    "briefly presents the requirements for and description of the heron detector design .",
    "sec .  4 and 5 provide the details of the heron capability analysis . in an appendix",
    "we discuss an application to measuring the solar orbit eccentricity .",
    "a principal goal of heron would be to make an accurate measurement of the luminosity of the sun using precise measurements of active neutrino fluxes . an experiment capable of measuring both and sufficiently well for an accurate luminosity measurement can also address several other interesting topics .",
    "these include testing for the relative rates of the 3(4 , 2p)4 and 3(4 , @xmath5)7 reactions which terminate the -i and -ii branches in the sun and also for testing the msw effect ( after mikheyev , smirnov , wolfenstein @xcite ) in the lma ( large mixing angle ) solution to the `` solar neutrino problem '' . additionally , if new measurements of and are successful at the few - percent level then , via new , luminosity - constrained global fits to all neutrino data , some modest improvement can be made in the knowledge of @xmath6 , @xmath7 and limits on sterile neutrinos .",
    "lastly , since a real - time low - energy solar neutrino experiment opens a new window in neutrino physics , the possibility of surprises in the physics should not be discounted .",
    "the radiant photon energy reaching the earth from the sun ( the irradiance , @xmath8 ) is believed to result from the nuclear fusion reactions of light elements .",
    "the energy released in each of the chains producing neutrinos is well known from laboratory experiments . consequently ,",
    "if the flux of the associated neutrinos can be determined then the photon irradiance and luminosity can be inferred from those fluxes .",
    "this is usually formulated @xcite as : @xmath9    where @xmath10 is the total solar luminosity in photons , is the average earth - sun distance , @xmath8 is the mean irradiance determined by earth - orbit satellites to be @xmath11 with a systematic uncertainty of about @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath13 s are the coefficients giving the energy provided by and associated with the @xmath14-th neutrino flux @xmath15 and @xmath16 is the total solar luminosity inferred from the neutrino fluxes .",
    "if the sun operates as we presently think it does @xcite then the ratio @xmath17 should be unity .",
    "significant departure from that expectation would signal the presence of different sources of energy within the sun @xcite .",
    "another important point is that , from the reaction positions in the solar interior , the energy carried by the photons and by the neutrinos reaches the earth with a huge separation in arrival times .",
    "the neutrinos arrive directly in 8 minutes while the thermal photon energy arrives from the solar plasma after approximately @xmath18 years @xcite .",
    "consequently , finding a disagreement between @xmath10 and @xmath16 would have significant implications for environmental consequences in the long term .    because the sum of  ( @xmath19 ) and 7 ( @xmath20 ) neutrinos are expected to be associated with @xmath21 of the total flux",
    ", it follows that a precision measurement of , either alone or together with , will provide the major direct test of @xmath17 .",
    "currently this comparison is only known to about @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "there are additional reasons to make a more precise determination of @xmath17 : the fact that the average photon irradiance is very well measured @xcite has previously led to its use as a constraint in global analyses of solar neutrino experimental data .",
    "used first as a demonstration of possible flavor oscillations of neutrinos @xcite and more recently , as additional and more precise solar and reactor neutrino experimental results have become available , as a powerful constraint to aid in establishing best present knowledge of solar neutrino mass - mixing parameters and individual fluxes @xcite .    at the same time , the standard solar models ( ssm ) @xcite have continued to make significant improvements so that quite precise predictions for the fluxes have been made .",
    "for example , is predicted to @xmath23 and to @xmath24 @xcite of the @xmath25 is contributed from the experimental uncertainty in @xmath26 nuclear cross - section factor ; however , new data from the luna collaboration @xcite suggests this contribution may be reduced to @xmath27 .",
    "private communication c. pea - garay . ] . when these predictions are compared against the fluxes found from global fits to all of the existing solar and reactor data @xcite the levels of agreement differ significantly depending on whether the photon luminosity is used as a constraint or not .",
    "for example , the ratios of global - fit fluxes to ssm predictions are ( at @xmath28 ) : for , @xmath29 and for 7 @xmath30 _ with the luminosity constraint _ but are @xmath31 and @xmath32 , respectively , _ without the constraint _ and leads to the poor knowledge of @xmath17 noted above @xcite .",
    "the question of how precisely direct measurements , of either or must be made in future experiments has been cogently addressed in an important paper by bahcall and pea - garay @xcite . related and",
    "more recent considerations also have been made by others @xcite .",
    "the level of precision required depends strongly upon the specific physics questions to be addressed . in all cases ,",
    "the demands on experimental techniques are severe .",
    "for example , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite carried out simulations of global analyses utilizing all present data plus inclusion of potential future and 7 experiments with assumed capability of precisions ranging from @xmath33 to @xmath34 ( at @xmath28 ) .",
    "they find that a 7 result of @xmath35 could improve knowledge of @xmath17 from @xmath36 to @xmath37 .",
    "increased precision on 7 alone would not yield further improvement ; while a @xmath23 on  could achieve a remarkable @xmath38 on the luminosity comparison by neutrinos .",
    "the authors note that a result of this accuracy would be _ `` a truly fundamental contribution to our knowledge of stellar energy generation and place a @xmath39 bound on all sources of energy other than low energy fusion of light elements ( i.e. ,  and cno chains ) '' . _",
    "the heron detector , as shown in the present paper , is intended to be capable of reaching precisions on both fluxes commensurate with these goals .",
    "the relative magnitude of versus is a particularly relevant parameter , on the one hand , bearing on the accuracy of the ssm and , on the other , as evidence for the msw effect in the lma .",
    "it is valuable to have an experiment which measures both and since several systematic errors tend to cancel in the ratio @xmath40 . in the ssm",
    "there is a very strong anti - correlation between the two fluxes with a coefficient of @xmath41 to @xmath42 @xcite . if the @xmath43 reaction of the -ii chain were the only terminating branch , only one  and one 7 neutrino would be produced in each cycle",
    "otherwise there would be two  and no 7 neutrinos if @xmath44 of the -i branch were the terminating reaction of the full fusion cycle .",
    "what the actual relative reaction rates are depends on several not yet accurately known details within the sun such as elemental abundances , temperatures and density .",
    "( present versions of the ssm predict a ratio of the two reaction rates as @xmath45 @xcite which implies , prior to oscillation , a value of @xmath46 for @xmath40 . )",
    "an independent and precise measurement of these relative rates would be an important contribution to the understanding of stellar processes and would permit a refinement of the use of the ssm in global analyses of neutrino data .",
    "the physics of the msw effect @xcite is embodied in the flavor - dependent interaction differences for neutrinos propagating in matter as opposed to vacuum . due to the differences in neutrino energies and solar density at their",
    "production points the , 7 and 8 neutrinos are expected to have quite different survival probabilities .",
    "the lma - msw solution specifies what this energy dependence must be .",
    "the oscillations of the much higher energy 8 neutrino should be strongly suppressed by matter dominance and the  neutrinos much less since they should be vacuum - dominated .",
    "the 7 and pep neutrinos , having energy intermediate to  and 8 , are in the crucial energy region where the transition between matter dominance and vacuum oscillations is to be expected .",
    "the 8 flux is now very well measured by the super kamiokande ( sk ) and sudbury ( sno ) experiments [ in ref .",
    "@xcite , see e.g. fukuda et  al . and ahmed et  al . ] ; however , direct experimental evidence for this msw transition is still lacking and could be provided by an experiment such as heron .      the and measured in es are , by necessity , the fluxes of active neutrinos .",
    "consequently , in the measurement of @xmath17 an alternative interpretation of a result consistent , within errors , to unity can be taken as the establishment of a limit on the presence of sterile neutrinos .",
    "due largely to the lack of precision experiments on these two major low - energy fluxes , there has been some leeway in the recent analyses of the solar and reactor data which allows for consideration of several well - motivated proposals for `` new physics '' in the neutrino sector . among these",
    "are possibilities for non - standard neutrino interactions with their environments ( nsi ) @xcite . within this class of models",
    "the additional effects to be expected are strongly constrained by existing data ; however , in some cases they should be most pronounced in the energy dependence of the fluxes of solar neutrinos @xmath47 . in these cases",
    "the effect is qualitatively similar , but differs quantitatively , from that to be expected from the lma - msw transition in the matter- to vacuum - dominated neutrino energy regions .",
    "two examples of this class , are models with flavor - non - conserving neutral currents @xcite or with mass - varying - neutrinos ( `` mavans '' ) @xcite ; the latter inspired by possible insights into understanding `` dark energy '' .",
    "confirmed evidence found for nsi would place our knowledge for the mass - mixing parameters in doubt ; alternatively , such precision measurements of the matter - vacuum transition region would also serve to establish new limits on the existence of nsi .",
    "new measurements of low energy solar fluxes can play only a rather limited role in improving on present knowledge of @xmath6 and @xmath7 limits . to be useful",
    ", the new data would need to be folded into a comprehensive analysis with all the other data ( solar , atmospheric and reactor ) which from present data have already established impressive errors on the parameters @xcite .",
    "the potential for improvement in these parameters by low energy es or cc experiments has been subjected to a detailed study by the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite who conclude that without new physics even @xmath48 on would make a negligible improvement on @xmath6 and a result @xmath49 is required to improve the error by more than @xmath50 .",
    "the authors conclusions on any improvements to be expected on @xmath7 are similar .",
    "there are stringent requirements placed on any detector designed to achieve these goals . in order to be sensitive to all active neutrino flavors ,",
    "the detection reaction is that of the elastic scattering from atomic electrons ( es ) in the target : @xmath51 .",
    "the es event signature is the occurrence of only a single , low energy recoiling electron in the detector medium .",
    "the recoil spectra are continuous from zero with the decreasing monotonically to a maximum energy of @xmath52 while the 7 spectrum is nearly flat up to @xmath53 maximum ( see points labeled input in fig .  [",
    "fig : spectra ] ) .",
    "these recoil spectra place a premium on achieving as low an energy threshold as possible .",
    "the most dangerous backgrounds are those which can be created by the appearance of electrons from compton recoils of gamma rays or radioactive decays within the medium of the target .",
    "these backgrounds need to be mitigated by a combination of event signatures , use of low activity materials , depth and shielding . in order to achieve the desired few - percent precision ,",
    "very large statistics event samples are required and systematic errors arising from effects due to analysis cuts ( e.g. , fiducial volume , thresholds ,  and 7 event separation , calibrations ) must be minimized .",
    "although these details emphasize the challenges to be faced in constructing an operating detector , there are two mitigating factors : the es cross - section is very precisely known due to experiment and electro - weak theory and the expected fluxes are high ( @xmath54 and @xmath55 @xcite ) .",
    "typically , this will result in an es event rate of @xmath56-@xmath57 which implies that only a modest - size fiducial volume ( e.g. , @xmath58 ) is needed for a high statistics experiment .",
    "the geometry of the heron detector design , all dimensions are in centimeters . ]",
    "the detector design is shown in ( fig .",
    "[ fig : design ] ) and its design is discussed in more detail in ref .",
    ". the general approach of heron to these issues is as follows .",
    "the target material chosen is @xmath59 in the superfluid state ( density 0.145 g / cc ) which has several beneficial properties .",
    "energy deposited in the helium by recoiling particles can be detected by one or all of three processes : scintillation , phonons / rotons or collecting the recoil electron trapped in a bubble .",
    "helium has no long - lived isotopes but more importantly it can be made absolutely free of all other atomic species . at superfluid temperatures it is self - cleaning of impurities due to their high mobility and favorable energy minimum at the container walls .",
    "even particulate matter quickly attaches to the container walls at our operating temperature of @xmath60@xmath61mk .",
    "since the bulk helium volume will be free of background sources , the concern is to counter radiation entering from the cryostat ( 27.3 tonne copper ) and its environment . in a separate study environmental sources",
    "were modeled with the detector cryostat actively shielded externally by @xmath62 of water at a rock overburden of @xmath63 meter - water - equiv .",
    "( m.w.e . ) .",
    "helium is virtually immune to creation of long - lived cosmogenic muon activity , capture or decay in it ; muons ( @xmath64 at 4500 m.w.e . )",
    "are vetoed externally and internally in any case and greater depth is possible .",
    "this was sufficient shielding against environmental neutrons , cosmic muons and gammas that , for purposes of the analysis simulation under consideration here , they would be negligible relative to sources from the cryostat and other detector parts .",
    "as a consequence the background issue reduces to controlling conversions of gammas entering the helium volume of 21.6 and 8 tonnes total and fiducial , respectively . however , helium does not have good self - shielding properties and this is partially compensated for by lining the cryostat with a moderator of solid nitrogen enclosed in acrylic cells ( @xmath65 acrylic and @xmath66 solid nitrogen , density @xmath67 ) .",
    "the function of the moderator is to absorb or degrade in energy by compton scattering the entering gamma rays which originate 97% and 3% from the cryostat and moderator , respectively .",
    "the flux of gammas entering the helium is dominated by low energy ( dominantly @xmath47 ) cosmogenic activity in the copper with the remainder from u , th and other activity in the copper , nitrogen , acrylic and other parts .",
    "the background gamma conversions in the helium can not be fully eliminated but are amenable to the development of a distinguishing signature which aids in their separation from signal ; the nature of this separation is detailed in sec .  4 and 5 .",
    "we have chosen to use as the basic elements of detection for both signal and background the collection of scintillation light and also the recoil electron trapped in its bubble .",
    "we have carried out studies of these processes using prototype calorimeter sensors / detectors developed for this project and suitable for both signal types ; the processes and results are discussed briefly below and in more detail in the references cited .",
    "excited or ionized he atoms along the electron path quickly form dimers in the liquid .",
    "the radiative decays to the ground states of these singlet and triplet dimers emit photons in the ultraviolet .",
    "the scintillation light is in a narrow band centered at 16 ev and results from the decay of the singlet dimer @xmath68 @xcite ; since this energy is lower than the first excited state of he at 20.6 ev , the liquid is self - transparent .",
    "@xmath69 of a recoil electron s energy is released ( @xmath70 photons / mev ) in this singlet dimer mechanism @xcite ; the energy from the long - lived ( @xmath71 ) triplet dimer escapes or is collision quenched .",
    "( an additional @xmath72 of the recoil energy is radiated in phonons and rotons which by quantum evaporation @xcite could in principle also be utilized with the calorimetric sensors for discrimination @xcite ; however , we find incorporating into event signatures the detection of the recoil electron from the drifted bubble a much stronger discriminant . )",
    "when a recoil electron in he has lost most of its energy it forms an electron bubble .",
    "the electron experiences a strong , short - range repulsive potential from the bound electrons on surrounding atoms due to pauli exclusion .",
    "this repulsion forms a vacant volume , or bubble , of @xmath73 radius in which the electron is confined .",
    "the bubble forms in about 10 pico - sec with an effective displacement mass of @xmath74 he - masses and has a hydrodynamic mass of half that @xcite ; consequently due to this difference in masses , under gravity and with no electric field , a bubble would experience a buoyant acceleration of @xmath75 . a uniform drift velocity of the bubble can be provided and controlled by a combination of applied electric field and a very low concentration of @xmath76 ; for example , at @xmath77mk , @xmath78ppm 3 and a field of @xmath79v / m provides a drift velocity of @xmath80 m/s . in a worst case example of @xmath81 m ( maximum depth ) , the @xmath82 collisions induced due to the large cross - section of 3 for scattering a bubble leads to an uncertainty in the transit time of @xmath83s and hence to a depth error of @xmath84 mm .",
    "in addition to providing a `` drag '' force the 3 also aids in extracting the electron efficiently through the free surface of the liquid by vortex attachment ( surko and reif @xcite ) .",
    "two grids on either side of the liquid surface ( not shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : design ] ) provide the drift and extraction fields @xcite .",
    "( at the normal operating temperature of @xmath85@xmath61mk the vapor pressure is sufficiently low that the space above the liquid is effectively a vacuum . )",
    "the final grid accelerates the electron to @xmath86kev thus providing a large and distinguishable pulse in the calorimeter .    for several reasons , photo - multiplier tubes ( pmt )",
    "are not suitable event detectors for heron , among them : the high radioactivity of pmt s , poor he self - shielding , lack of transparency of moderator and the desire to detect the drifted electrons .",
    "as mentioned , both scintillation and drifted electrons are detected on the same calorimetric devices .",
    "each device constitutes a pixel in a geometric array ( a coded aperture ) and consists of a thin wafer of silicon or sapphire to which is attached a high sensitivity metallic magnetic calorimeter ( mmc ) read out with a squid sensor @xcite . for astrophysical x - ray application , versions of mmc have been constructed with @xmath87 resolution @xcite .",
    "projecting from measurements on wafer prototypes of smaller heat capacity to ones of the heron size , @xmath88ev resolution is to be expected . in a full simulation of the response of this large wafer ( @xmath89 , in this example ) with 16 ev photons",
    "it is found that single photons should be detectable at wafer temperature of @xmath77mk producing a pulse of @xmath81ms rise- and @xmath90ms fall - time @xcite .",
    "this performance capability is assumed in the context of the analysis of sec .  4 and 5 .    for each neutrino event we must reconstruct its position within the he and also its recoil electron energy . in addition",
    ", we must develop event signatures which aid in separating signal from background events .",
    "the maximum track length expected for a neutrino event is @xmath91 cm so that on the scale of the total helium volume ( @xmath92m@xmath93 ; @xmath94 t ) neutrino signal events are effectively point sources of scintillation light . at the dominantly low energies of the gamma - ray background events the conversions in he",
    "are overwhelmingly ( @xmath95 ) compton scatters .",
    "@xmath96 of these conversions are multiple depositions distributed over an average length of more than @xmath61 cm in the he .",
    "consequently , the scintillation from background arises from a distributed , rather than a point , source ; additionally the event most often contains multiple , un - recombined electron recoil bubbles .",
    "these latter two features constitute the primary background signature .",
    "subsequently , differences among the spectral and spatial distributions of the signal and residual background events facilitate their final separation . in order to create these signatures and to enable the necessary cuts on data samples",
    "the 2400 wafer calorimeters are arranged into two planes in the vacuum space above the liquid ; the resulting array constitutes a coded aperture and provides the ability for both spatial and energy reconstruction .",
    "the concept of coded aperture arrays @xcite has been a well established one with arrays being widely used in x - ray astronomy .",
    "the role of the array is to accurately determine the _ direction _ of incoming photons from a remote x - ray point source . a coded aperture array consists of two parts , an imaging plane and , separated by a fixed distance , a mask plane . in the x - ray application",
    "the image plane consists of a set of active sensors ( or pixels ) while the mask plane is opaque with a pattern of cut - out apertures . for far - distant sources ,",
    "nearly parallel rays enter the array and some of them are blocked by the opaque portions of the mask ; thus the image imposed on the sensor plane will resemble the pattern of the apertures in the mask effectively leaving a `` shadow '' ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : ura ] ) . in principle , to determine the direction of the light source it is simply a matter of comparing the shadow pattern to that of the mask itself . in practice ,",
    "elegant techniques have been developed for design of mask patterns and image deconvolution taking into account side - lobe effects as well as intrinsic and statistical noise .",
    "various classes of mask patterns have been employed in the x - ray field ranging from random apertures to strictly repeating and regular patterns .",
    "the choice of one over another depends upon experimental considerations such as strength of photon flux , resolution needed and sidelobe tolerance .",
    "ura pattern , @xmath97 in dimensions and @xmath98 in periodicity .",
    "dark and light areas represent opaque and open regions , resp . in the heron mask ,",
    "the smallest squares represents single wafers . ]    in the heron application there are important differences : a ) a non - distant point source location is to be determined within a limited volume in _",
    "3-d _ , b ) the event energy must be measured , c ) for reasons ( a ) and ( b ) both planes will consist of active wafer pixels and d ) some discrimination is needed between point and non - point sources . the heron coded aperture array is arranged with the mask plane @xmath99 cm above the liquid surface and the image plane @xmath99 m above the mask . the pixels are arranged in @xmath100 square arrays ( @xmath101 cm each ) with @xmath102 wafer calorimeters in the image plane and @xmath103 in the mask .",
    "the pattern of apertures in the mask is that of a uniformly redundant array ( ura ) @xcite .",
    "this mask pattern was chosen because of its low intrinsic noise and high transparency ( @xmath104 ) .",
    "( in the notation of the ura it has a ( 17,19 ) grid spacing @xcite as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ura ] . )",
    "the nature of the ura and heron physical properties and goals constrain the choice of wafer pixel size .",
    "the he fiducial volume can be chosen and varied during physics analysis but the total mass of he is contained within a cylindrical volume of @xmath105 cm and @xmath106 cm height . in our application , the transverse dimensions of the array should be at least commensurate with those of the fiducial volume containing the sources and , although smaller pixel sizes imply finer spatial resolution , ultimately photon statistics dominate ( typically a few hundred photons for many neutrino events , due to energy and solid angle effects ) . for the heron geometry a choice of @xmath107 cm pixels in a ura gives resolution adequate to the physics goals without unnecessarily increasing the complexity or noise and consistent with the desired single photon performance for a wafer of this size .",
    "the deconvolution techniques used for typical x - ray applications are not applicable for our 3-d application ; additionally , they are not easily amenable to developing a background ( distributed source ) signature .",
    "instead we have adopted a likelihood approach along with a search algorithm for the most probable position in 3-d space .",
    "this approach treats each event in a sample containing both signal and background as if it were a single point source . with that assumption",
    ", it finds from the observed photon hit pattern the most probable values of its spatial location and total energy .",
    "although no attempt is made on an event - by - event basis to distinguish signal from background , distributions of the likelihood parameter s logarithm can be useful in separating signal and background as we show in sec .",
    "5 . similarly ,",
    "the effective point - like positions and effective energy distributions of the background events are used .",
    "operationally , the algorithm initiates with a test - point location in the volume and the probability of this test electron to produce the observed photon hit pattern is calculated .",
    "the test photon distribution is taken as isotropic with straight - line propagation ; the probability of hitting the @xmath14-th wafer is then proportional to the solid angle ( @xmath108 ) subtended by the wafer from the photon current starting point . after a systematic search of points throughout the available volume ,",
    "the location in space found to have the highest probability is taken as the final position .",
    "if @xmath109 is the solid angle subtended by all @xmath110 wafers in both planes and @xmath111 is the number of photon hits in the pattern then we can define a quantity @xmath112 which is the total number inferred for the test point .",
    "then the probability of an event located at @xmath113 producing the recorded photon pattern is evaluated as : @xmath114 where @xmath115 is the number hitting @xmath14-th wafer and @xmath116 and for computational convenience we use the logarithm ( loglikelihood ) : @xmath117 and select as the final position the one with the largest ( least negative ) @xmath118 .",
    "the final energy estimate is scaled from the solid angle subtended from the test point .",
    "the process converges rapidly guided by a set of empirically established criteria for avoiding subsidiary maxima and reaching a stable solution . ) .",
    "consequently , for simplicity of analysis and discussion we ignore these effects in this paper . ]",
    "a test of the reconstruction ability of the coded aperture approach has been done in a way which examines a full range of variable correlations .",
    "we have generated samples of , 7 ( @xmath119 , each ) and background events ( @xmath120 ) as they would appear in the configuration of heron described .",
    "for the neutrinos , the input recoil electron energy spectra are as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] and the events are distributed uniformly throughout the full he volume . the input background sample in the he is generated by propagating gamma rays initiating from sources within the detector s principal components using geant3 @xcite .",
    "the source activities and concentrations are listed in table  [ tab : bg sources ] . within the he account",
    "was taken for bremstrahlung , very low energy compton recoils and delta - rays . for all input samples , the original position and deposited energy for every recoil electron was retained for use in comparing to reconstructed values .",
    "the events were then reconstructed as described in sec .",
    ".[tab : bg sources]assumed levels of residual activity in major detector components . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     for comparison , we also show in table  [ tab : fitting results ] the resulting errors to be expected when all optical effects are included .",
    "the differences are not significant as we have discussed in footnote 2 .",
    "we have described that , on the basis of the new knowledge gained in recent years of neutrino properties and of higher energy solar neutrino fluxes , there are excellent reasons to perform precision real - time measurements of the very low - energy neutrino fluxes from the sun .",
    "the physics goals outlined in sec .",
    "2 include determining the luminosity of the sun in neutrinos , providing checks on some details of the ssm , testing the msw effect in the lma solution and improving constraints on the neutrinos mass - mixing parameters as well as providing discovery opportunities in the new low energy regime .    to achieve these goals detectors are required which can measure the flux with a precision better than @xmath121 and the  flux to better than @xmath122 .",
    "such detectors must be capable of collecting very large event samples and maintain good control of systematic errors .",
    "we have described the design of such a possible detector , heron , and have simulated its performance .",
    "although the heron detector is not presently scheduled or funded for construction , by experimentation in prototypes of several liters we have measured the details of energy loss processes ( scintillation , phonons / rotons , electron bubbles ) for low energy electrons in the superfluid @xcite .",
    "the development of wafer calorimeters capable of detecting all three channels has been carried out @xcite .",
    "we have not tested an array of wafers as a coded aperture ; however , given the well tested use of the method in other fields , performance as simulated can be reasonably expected .",
    "the superfluid helium target material is itself free of intrinsic internal background and provides two channels ( scintillation and drifted electrons ) to distinguish and separate externally entering background from point - like neutrino es signals via an active coded - aperture array .",
    "the simulation has been directed towards establishing the systematic and other errors to be expected for the heron detector in an exposure of 5 years . for that purpose",
    "large samples of both signal and background events were generated and then fully reconstructed according to the physical processes in helium , the detector geometry and the properties of the coded aperture design .",
    "the expected signals were based on current best understanding of the neutrino mass - mixing parameters and the well - known electroweak scattering cross - sections .",
    "the backgrounds ( gamma - ray conversions in the helium ) were simulated from radioactive sources distributed throughout the major materials surrounding the helium . the level and nature of the activities assumed was in line with current best practice in solar and double beta decay neutrino experimentation . to separate a combined sample of pp , be7 and backgrounds into their respective flux components ,",
    "an extended loglikelihood method was used employing probability distribution functions constructed from various samples of the above simulation prescription . by design",
    ", the method included all correlations among variables imposed by event reconstruction , various cuts on the data as well as those arising from the properties of the pdf s themselves .",
    "the results are quite promising as can be seen in tables 2 - 5 .",
    "it appears that should the detector be built and perform as modeled it would be capable of satisfying the criteria necessary for the precision pp and be7 flux measurements .",
    "for example , to take the particular choice of the so - called `` standard threshold and fiducial cut '' on a 5-year exposure and combining all errors except energy scale ( statistical , high - level cuts , likelihood method ) a precision on pp flux of @xmath123 ( or @xmath124 including energy scale uncertainty ) results .",
    "similarly for , we find errors of @xmath125 and @xmath126 without and with , respectively , the energy scale uncertainty included .",
    "the full neutrino flux obtained without attempting to employ the separation of and individually would present a combined error of @xmath127 .",
    "the validity of the background model used in these simulations is a key issue .",
    "the composition and relative magnitude of the background sources assumed were based on current experience in the field and should therefore be realizable in practice ; nonetheless , it is important to ask to what extent are the simulation results dependent upon the assumed model and to what extent can the model be checked in practice .",
    "the decay modes of the sources , branching ratios and energies of the decay products are well known and the method of their propagation through the simulation programs are well established .",
    "perhaps most important is the question of whether we may have mis - estimated the total background level and if so how strongly the result would be affected . a mistake in the magnitude would enter principally through the separation procedure using the pdf s",
    "; consequently we have tested this effect by varying the assumed size of the background over a wide range .",
    "the effect is not drastic ; for example , should the background be 5 times larger , the  error would double while a factor 50 larger background would raise the  error by six times ( however , this latter rate would introduce prohibitive wafer deadtime ) . in contrast , reducing the background by a factor of @xmath128 only improves the  error by @xmath50 .    in practice , there are some checks available on the model . due to the good position and energy resolution for the point - like signal events , fiducial volumes of various sizes can be made and the stability of the flux results checked .",
    "as we have seen in tables 2 , 3 and 5 , varying the high - level cuts by setting different fiducial volumes and thresholds does not have a strong effect upon the expected errors .",
    "similarly , the nature and dependence of the observed spatial and energy distributions as a function of these cuts can also be compared directly to the model .    in conclusion",
    "we believe that a detector of the heron design utilizing superfluid helium and a coded aperture array could provide the capability to carry out the multiple physics goals achievable through precision , real - time , simultaneous measurements of and .",

    "in order to examine the effectiveness of our flux fitting method under a more realistic context , we chose to test for the annual solar neutrino flux oscillation due to the earth orbit eccentricity .",
    "the orbit of the earth around the sun has an eccentricity of @xmath129 .",
    "since the diameter of the sun ( @xmath130 km ) is much smaller than the radius of the orbit ( @xmath131 km ) , the sun can be treated as a point source , thus the neutrino flux observed on earth will oscillate according to @xmath132 .",
    "we simulated the number of events observed daily over a span of five years .",
    "these event numbers consist of both  and 7 events including their statistical fluctuations . a random error according to the systematic uncertainty of the flux fitting method",
    "is then added to each day s flux , to simulate the errors introduced during the reconstruction and flux separation process",
    ". then the daily fitted event counts are grouped into consecutive @xmath133 day periods , with @xmath134 days worth of data each year discarded for simplicity .",
    "thus over 5 years , each of these periods contain @xmath135 days worth of events .",
    "a @xmath136 fit of these event numbers against the model of an elliptic earth orbit can then be performed , using the eccentricity as the fitting parameter .",
    "figure [ fig : ecc ] shows a typical set of data for such fitting .",
    "the error bars on the `` fitted '' data include both statistical and systematic errors , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : error in fluxes ] , where the absolute energy scale uncertainty is taken as @xmath138 .",
    "best fit of the particular data set in that figure gives an eccentricity of @xmath139 ; repeating this simulation for @xmath137 times reveals the distribution of the best fitted eccentricity values to be @xmath140 .",
    "this exercise demonstrates that our flux fitting method is capable of resolving the solar neutrino flux to the precision of a few percent given 5 years of detector running time .",
