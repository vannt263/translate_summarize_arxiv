    "over the last five years , a variety of experiments , involving neutrinos from the sun , atmospheric air showers , nuclear reactors and accelerators , have amassed compelling evidence that neutrinos have non - zero masses @xcite .",
    "a remarkable feature of this data is that the two measured leptonic mixing angles are large .",
    "this was a surprise : theories which unify quarks and leptons had led to the expectation that the mixing amongst leptons , like that between quarks , would be small .",
    "hence the data has sparked considerable activity directed toward understanding the origin of these large mixing angles .",
    "the more fundamental question of why the neutrino masses are so much smaller than the charged fermion masses has received less attention .",
    "there is a general belief that this problem was solved many years ago by the seesaw mechanism @xcite .",
    "indeed , one sometimes forgets that the data has not confirmed the seesaw mechanism , and it is worth stressing that there is no known experiment or observation which could test this plausible idea .",
    "given our current theoretical understanding of effective field theories , the seesaw mechanism does indeed appear to give a very natural explanation for the lightness of the neutrinos .",
    "but this , like the belief in small mixing angles , is a theoretical prejudice , and in neutrino physics we have learnt to expect surprises .    in this paper",
    "we pursue an alternative idea : the neutrinos are light because they are protected from acquiring a mass by a global symmetry which is not broken until energies at or beneath the weak scale .",
    "the philosophy is precisely opposite to that of the seesaw mechanism  the underlying physics is not all at extremely high energies where it is hard to test , rather some is at very low energies , and we have missed it because it couples only to neutrinos . instead of right - handed neutrinos acquiring very large masses at some high scale of lepton number breaking ,",
    "neutrino masses arise from symmetry breaking at much lower energies .",
    "we explore the cosmological consequences of neutrino mass generation at a phase transition at or below the weak scale .",
    "while we do not know of laboratory tests for this idea , signals in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) could not only answer whether the neutrinos are majorana or dirac , but also distinguish between the hierarchical , inverted and degenerate patterns of neutrino masses .",
    "this signal results because the acoustic oscillations at the ev era are sensitive to the total energy density in relativistic particles and to whether these relativistic particles scatter or free - stream . a measurement of the energy density of this radiation at the few percent level , and especially its scattering characteristics , will probe physical processes occurring in the neutrino fluid at and before the ev era .",
    "the mass scale of all the quarks and charged leptons is set by the scale @xmath4 of electroweak symmetry breaking : @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the electroweak higgs field .",
    "the interaction generating these masses is assumed to have the form @xmath7 , where @xmath8 can be any of the quarks or charged leptons .",
    "if neutrino masses also originate from such an interaction , it is hard to understand why neutrinos would be so much lighter than the charged fermions .",
    "the beauty of the seesaw mechanism is that it explains why , of all the fermions , it is the neutrinos which are light .",
    "the only fermion that does not couple to the known gauge interactions is the right - handed neutrino , and hence it is not protected by gauge symmetry from acquiring a large majorana mass , @xmath9 . on integrating it out of the theory , the left - handed lepton doublet @xmath10 acquires an interaction which is bilinear in @xmath6 @xmath11 leading to a neutrino mass which is quadratic in @xmath4 , @xmath12 , rather than the linear formula that applies to the charged fermions : @xmath13 .",
    "indeed , eqn .",
    "( [ eq : seesaw1 ] ) provides a more primitive understanding of why the neutrinos are light .",
    "as long as the low energy effective theory does not contain right - handed neutrinos , there are no renormalizable operators that give a neutrino mass  the first neutrino mass operator appears at dimension 5 .",
    "we propose instead that the neutrinos are protected from acquiring a mass at the weak scale by a global symmetry , as in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the operator ( [ eq : seesaw1 ] ) does not possess such a symmetry , and hence is not the tev description of neutrino masses we seek .",
    "the operators relevant for neutrino masses must involve a new scalar field @xmath14 which carries a charge under the global symmetry .",
    "thus the tev description of neutrino masses is given by operators of the form @xmath15 where @xmath16 represents the right - handed neutrino , @xmath17 is a mass scale larger than @xmath4 , and @xmath18 is a positive integer .",
    "the first operator applies if lepton number is conserved , leading to dirac neutrino masses , otherwise the second operator applies and the neutrinos are majorana . unlike the case of the seesaw mechanism , there is no preference for the neutrinos to be majorana .",
    "very stringent bounds would result if the goldstone coupled to charged leptons and quarks ; but these couplings are predicted to be absent because the charged fermion masses are not protected by the global symmetry .    at sufficiently high temperatures in the hot big bang , the @xmath14 and @xmath16 particles will be in thermal equilibrium with the particles of the standard model .",
    "however , if @xmath14 and @xmath16 only interact with standard model particles via ( [ eq : tevops ] ) , then they will drop out of thermal equilibrium as the universe cools so that there is an era of two separate sectors . during this era",
    "we assume that sufficient entropy is created in the standard model sector , from phase transitions or from heavy particle annihilations , so that the temperature rises significantly above that of the @xmath19 sector .",
    "hence big bang nucleosynthesis is essentially unchanged by the extra sector .",
    "below we describe a minimal model for the flavor symmetry breaking sector . however , the details of any particular model are not as important as the model independent mechanism .",
    "once symmetry breaking occurs in the @xmath14 sector , a set of goldstone bosons , @xmath20 , are produced .",
    "the cmb signals result from the interactions of @xmath20 with neutrinos at very low energies , and will be discussed in section iii .",
    "we choose the global symmetry to be lepton number , @xmath21 , defined with charge + 1 on all neutrino fields ( _ i.e. _ on both @xmath22 and @xmath23 ) . just below the scale of electroweak symmetry breaking the neutrino mass generation sector",
    "is described by @xmath24 together with kinetic energy terms for @xmath25 ( and for @xmath23 if the neutrino is dirac ) . for simplicity",
    "we have taken the neutrino interaction to be linear in @xmath14 by requiring the complex scalar @xmath14 to have lepton number @xmath26 .",
    "the index @xmath27 runs over the three generations of neutrinos , and we have rotated the neutrino fields to a mass eigenstate basis .",
    "small values for the dimensionless couplings @xmath28 are perfectly natural , reflecting the hierarchy between @xmath4 and @xmath17 .    we have taken the sign of the scalar mass term negative to ensure that @xmath21 is spontaneously broken , @xmath29 .",
    "this minimal model does not address the origin of the neutrino mass ratios , which follow from @xmath30 .",
    "we assume the largest coupling , @xmath31 , does not involve any small dimensionless parameter , so that @xmath31 is @xmath32 for the dirac case or @xmath33 for the majorana case , giving a neutrino mass @xmath34 of @xmath35 or @xmath36 respectively .",
    "the mass scale @xmath17 is then @xmath37 or @xmath38 , respectively .",
    "this should be compared with the seesaw result : @xmath39 . for @xmath40 ,",
    "the scale of the underlying physics is reduced : @xmath41 . at what scale , @xmath42 ,",
    "should the global symmetry be broken ?",
    "if we take @xmath42 all the way down to @xmath34 , then @xmath43 so that the physics generating the non - renormalizable operators ( [ eq : tevops ] ) becomes accessible to high energy colliders .",
    "however , in this case the dimensionless coupling @xmath31 is of order unity , so that in the early universe both @xmath14 and @xmath16 become part of the thermal bath during the mev era , conflicting with big bang nucleosynthesis @xcite . if @xmath42 were larger than the electroweak scale , then @xmath44 , which is too small to generate the cmb signals we have in mind .",
    "hence we study an intermediate situation where @xmath45 we will construct theories in which such low symmetry breaking scales arise naturally in section [ sec : susy ] . breaking lepton number below the weak scale also avoids the potential danger that the baryon asymmetry will be erased @xcite .    in the spontaneously broken phase , @xmath46 , where @xmath20 is a physical goldstone boson , and @xmath47 a higgs boson .",
    "the coupling of the neutrino to @xmath20 and @xmath47 is given by @xmath48 the analysis of this paper is almost entirely based on these couplings , and the symmetry breaking sector that leads to them is of lesser importance .",
    "the masses of @xmath20 and @xmath47 play a very important role .",
    "if the self interactions of @xmath14 are of order unity , then one expects @xmath49 . in this case",
    "it is @xmath20 which is of interest to us .",
    "we assume that @xmath20 is actually a pseudo - goldstone boson , with a non - zero mass @xmath50 , as studied in @xcite .",
    "if this mass arises from a dimension 5 interaction suppressed by the planck scale , @xmath51 , then we expect @xmath52 .",
    "we will not limit ourselves to this case , but take @xmath53 to be a free parameter . if @xmath14 is weakly coupled so that @xmath54 , then the higgs can also play an important role in generating cmb signals . however , higgs particles lighter than @xmath42 require further small parameters . in this paper",
    "we focus on signals from pseudo - goldstone bosons ( pgbs ) .",
    "they are naturally light , and they interact with neutrinos only via the couplings @xmath28 .",
    "furthermore , they generically have interactions among themselves with strength proportional to explicit symmetry breaking that gives pgbs mass . in more general models of spontaneously broken lepton flavor symmetry",
    "there are many pgbs , @xmath55 .",
    "the interactions of pgbs with neutrinos can alter the energy density in neutrinos and cause neutrinos to scatter rather than free stream during the ev era .",
    "both effects leave characteristic signals in the cmb .",
    "the pgbs , @xmath55 , interact only via the small dimensionless couplings @xmath28 to neutrinos , implying that in the early universe the rate for neutrinos to scatter into @xmath55 has a recoupling form ; that is , the rate increases relative to the expansion rate as the temperature , @xmath56 , drops . at some recoupling temperature",
    "some subset of the @xmath57 sector recouples to the left - handed neutrinos , @xmath22 , so that this subset gets reheated .",
    "different subsets may get reheated at various recoupling temperatures . however , while this reheating creates entropy , it does not change the total radiation energy density , so recoupling itself does not lead to a change in the radiation energy density at the ev era .",
    "as the @xmath58 fluid cools , the temperature will drop beneath the mass of one of the pgbs , @xmath59 . since @xmath59 is in thermal equilibrium with @xmath60 and @xmath55 ,",
    "its number density becomes exponentially reduced via decays or annihilations and the neutrino fluid is adiabatically heated , which _ does _ lead to a change in the radiation energy density .",
    "the size of this signal depends on how many right - handed neutrinos and scalars are recoupled , which depends on whether the neutrinos are dirac or majorana and on the strength of the couplings @xmath28 that each neutrino has with @xmath55 .",
    "provided @xmath59 has recoupled and then disappeared before the ev era , the cosmic microwave background will have acoustic oscillations which reflect a radiation energy density that differs from standard cosmology and depends on the type and spectrum of the neutrinos .",
    "if a light pgb recouples to neutrinos before the ev era , but has a mass less than 1 ev , it may prevent one or more of the neutrino species from free - streaming . in the standard model , neutrino free streaming shifts the multipoles of the nth cmb peak by a large amount , @xmath61 , at large @xmath62 ,",
    "so the absence of free - streaming will produce a large signal in future cmb datasets .",
    "in the previous section we have discussed an alternative origin for light neutrino masses , involving extra states at low energy , including goldstone bosons , higgs and possibly right - handed neutrino states .",
    "we have outlined how the interaction of these extra states could lead to signals in the cmb . in this section",
    "we study each of the cmb signals in some depth .",
    "we give general formulas for both signals in a model independent way , and discuss the range of new physics which could lead to each signal .",
    "measurements of the precise form of the cmb acoustic oscillations provide a powerful constraint on the relativistic energy density of the universe during the ev era , @xmath63 . in the standard model , @xmath63",
    "is precisely predicted during this era , so these measurements are powerful probes of non - standard physics .",
    "increasing @xmath63 has several physical effects .",
    "for example , last scatter occurs at a fixed temperature , and hence as @xmath63 increases so the time at last scatter decreases .",
    "this decreases the horizon at last scatter and hence shifts the acoustic peaks to higher multipole @xmath62 .",
    "an increase in @xmath63 leads to a lowering of the redshift of matter radiation equality .",
    "this leads to larger amplitude acoustic peaks at low @xmath62 @xcite , and a marked increase in the damping of the peaks at large @xmath62 @xcite .",
    "what mechanism would allow the total radiation energy density during the ev era to differ from that predicted by standard cosmology ?",
    "we begin by discussing three important types of process : fragmentation , recoupling and disappearance by decay or annihilation .    in cosmology",
    "it is well known that particles which interact with each other at very high temperature may no longer have thermal communication at lower temperature . in general",
    "one should expect that as the universe cools the fluid fragments into multiple components or sectors .",
    "this fragmentation occurs whenever there are no large renormalizable interactions between particles .",
    "neutrinos provide the most familiar example : below the weak scale they only interact via the non - renormalizable fermi interaction and they fragment away from the electron / photon fluid at the mev era .",
    "it appears quite likely that dark matter and dark energy are sectors that fragmented from the visible sector at some stage of cosmological evolution .",
    "we therefore write the relativistic energy density after fragmentation of the known neutrinos as @xmath64 where @xmath65 are the temperatures of the photons , neutrinos and other sectors and the spin degeneracies @xmath66 for neutrinos and other radiation sectors include a factor of 7/8 for fermions .",
    "it is not always necessary that each sector actually be in thermal equilibrium .",
    "for example , during this era in the standard cosmology the neutrinos are free - streaming . in the standard cosmology , @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 , so that @xmath70 where the number of neutrinos , @xmath71 , is 3 . in non - standard cosmologies",
    "we use ( [ eq : rhorad2 ] ) to define @xmath71 , so that @xmath71 may differ from 3 even if there are three species of neutrinos .",
    "it is important to distinguish two very different ways in which cmb experiments could measure @xmath72 .",
    "if @xmath71 does not change between nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) and the ev era ( cmb ) , then cmb could then discover @xmath73 , depending on the uncertainties from bbn .",
    "such a signal could be very significant given the small uncertainties possible in future cmb measurements . since @xmath74 , this could probe the radiation density @xmath75 in some sector that fragmented from the standard model sector before , perhaps much before , bbn .    perhaps less well known than the phenomenon of fragmentation is that of recoupling .",
    "if the renormalizable couplings between particles in different fragmented sectors are small rather than vanishing , then eventually , as the universe cools , the sectors will recouple back into a single thermal component .",
    "the smaller the renormalizable coupling the lower the recoupling temperature .    in this paper",
    "we will be concerned with recoupling contributing to a signal arising from a change in the ratio @xmath76 between bbn and cmb @xcite .",
    "we find such a possibility particularly exciting because it indicates that new physics is affecting cosmological evolution after bbn .",
    "it could arise from a non - standard evolution of @xmath77 or of ( @xmath78 ) .",
    "particularly large effects result if the electron / photon fluid recouples to some previously fragmented sector of spin degeneracy @xmath79 . if the temperature of the fragmented sector is small prior to recoupling , the photon cooling results in a large relative increase in the importance of the neutrinos , giving @xmath80 .",
    "this has already been excluded by the first year of the wmap data @xcite , except for the case of @xmath81 @xcite@xcite .",
    "photon heating is also possible , for example from the out - of - equilibrium decay of a non - relativistic species .",
    "a particularly important way of changing the radiation density of any sector is if some particle species in that sector becomes non - relativistic .",
    "if the number density of the heavy particle maintains an exponentially suppressed equilibrium form , then the decay or annihilation of the particle occurs at constant entropy .",
    "this results in an increase in the temperature of the remaining radiation of that sector by a factor @xmath82 , where @xmath28 and @xmath83 are spin degeneracies of the radiation of that sector before and after the disappearance of the heavy species .",
    "this mechanism is familiar from the annihilation of electron / positron pairs which heat the photons giving @xmath84 . as an example of a non - standard evolution of @xmath77 ,",
    "suppose that the photon first recouples to a sector of spin degeneracy @xmath79 , and then all the species of that sector become non - relativistic before the ev era , the cmb signal is @xmath85 .",
    "a wide range of @xmath79 is allowed by the wmap data and could be observed by future cmb experiments .    in this paper , we will be interested in the case that a cmb signal arises because of a non - standard evolution of @xmath86 after bbn , even though the signals tend to be smaller than those which arise from a non - standard evolution of @xmath77 .",
    "such a signal could arise whenever some particle of a fragmented sector becomes non - relativistic and disappears . while the temperature of this sector would rise by a factor of @xmath82 , this",
    "typically does not give an observable signal since the energy density in the sector is highly sub - dominant .",
    "we will explore theories of neutrino mass generation where the sector that generates the neutrino masses , including the right - handed neutrinos if they are dirac , recouples to the sector of the left - handed neutrinos .",
    "this recoupling ensures that the physics of the new sector is not sub - dominant .",
    "while the recoupling of two such relativistic sectors does not by itself lead to a change in the total energy density , the effects of particle decay or annihilation in the new sector does give signals which depend on the type and spectrum of the neutrinos , and on the mass generation mechanism , and which can be computed from equilibrium thermodynamics .",
    "suppose that after bbn @xmath87 of the left - handed neutrino species recouple to some sector of @xmath88 particles with spin degeneracy @xmath79 .",
    "this recoupling may occur at a variety of temperatures , but we assume that at some stage the resulting @xmath89 fluid thermalizes at a single temperature .",
    "subsequently we assume that some subset of the states of this recoupled sector , with spin degeneracy @xmath90 , become heavy .",
    "as the universe expands further , but well before the ev era , the number density of the heavy states becomes exponentially suppressed so that their entropy is transferred to the lighter states .",
    "this may occur at several stages with different heavy species having different masses . if the whole process occurs without chemical potentials , then the prediction for the relativistic energy density during the ev era",
    "is then given by @xmath91 in the case where the recoupling reactions lead to chemical potentials this prediction is modified .",
    "it is no longer sufficient to calculate the neutrino temperature after the pseudo - goldstone bosons disappear . instead , both the temperature and all chemical potentials must be determined at each step .",
    "typically all chemical potentials are related such that there exists only one additional degree of freedom .    at the first step , when the pseudo - goldstone bosons equilibrate , the total energy density is conserved . in addition , the presence of a non - zero chemical potential implies that there exists an additional conserved charge .",
    "these two conservation laws provide us with two equations to solve for the two unknowns : temperature and chemical potential .",
    "when the goldstone bosons disappear energy is not conserved .",
    "instead comoving entropy density , together with the additional quantum number , are conserved .",
    "this again allows us to calculate the final temperature and chemical potential . from these two parameters we are able to calculate the final energy density in neutrinos and finally the effective number of neutrinos at matter - radiation equality n_= ( 3-n_r)+n_r [ eq : nnumu ] where @xmath92 is",
    "the temperature the neutrinos would have had in the standard model and @xmath93 is the energy density in the @xmath87 neutrino species that recoupled .",
    "recently bashinsky and seljak have given an analytic understanding of the effects of neutrino free - streaming on the position and amplitudes of the cmb acoustic peaks in the standard model @xcite .",
    "here we briefly summarize some of their results , using their notation .    in the conformal newtonian gauge ,",
    "the robertson - walker metric with scalar metric perturbations takes the form @xmath94 where @xmath95 is conformal time and @xmath96 is the cosmological scale factor . in this gauge ,",
    "the density perturbation in the relative photon number density @xmath97 satisfies the equation @xmath98 in the absence of any particle species which free - streams , the energy - momentum tensor takes the form for a locally isotropic fluid , resulting in the equality of the scalar metric perturbations : @xmath99 .",
    "however , neutrino free - streaming introduces a direction at each locality , so that the energy - momentum tensor becomes anisotropic , with off - diagonal entries in the spatial subspace proportional to a free - streaming potential @xmath100 .",
    "this anisotropy induces a difference between the scalar metric perturbations : @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the fraction of radiation in neutrinos : @xmath103 if the initial density perturbations are adiabatic , then the perturbation in the relative number density of all species , before they enter the horizon , are given by @xmath104 , where @xmath105 describes the primordial perturbation . solving first for @xmath100 ,",
    "next for the metric perturbations , and finally for the photon perturbation at comoving wavenumber @xmath106 , bashinsky and seljak find acoustic oscillations in the radiation dominated era for high @xmath106 of the form @xmath107 where , to leading order in @xmath102 , @xmath108 and @xmath109 the amplitude shift of the primordial spectrum , @xmath110 , can only be probed by observations which compare the photon and cold dark matter perturbations , and we do not consider them further .",
    "the @xmath16th peak of the cmb acoustic oscillations occurs at a wavenumber @xmath111 such that the mode has @xmath16 half cycles of oscillation between horizon crossing and last scatter ( ls ) : @xmath112 since the multipole of the peak @xmath113 , @xmath114 causes a shift in the position of the @xmath16th peak .",
    "this analytic solution accurately reproduces the numerical results obtained by the cmbfast code , and it is apparent that this shift of the position of the peaks is purely due to the free - streaming of the neutrinos , since , in the absence of free - streaming , both @xmath100 and @xmath114 vanish .",
    "thus , the free - streaming of @xmath71 species of neutrinos shifts the positions of the peaks , at large @xmath16 , by @xmath115 giving @xmath116 for @xmath117 .",
    "here @xmath118 is the difference in multipole between successive peaks at large @xmath16 .",
    "as the number of free - streaming neutrinos is increased above the standard model value of 3 , so the peaks shift to lower @xmath62 .",
    "the beauty of this signal is that , for adiabatic perturbations , it is not mimicked by changing other parameters of the theory . while other parameters do cause a shift in the positions of the peaks , only by changing the free - streaming behavior can one obtain a non - isotropic energy - momentum tensor which leads to a shift in the @xmath16th peak which is _ independent _ of @xmath16 .    with these results in hand",
    ", we immediately see that there is an important signal in the position of the cmb peaks for theories where one or more neutrinos are scattering during the ev era rather than free - streaming",
    ". in general one must replace ( [ eq : rnu ] ) by @xmath119 where @xmath120 is the energy density of the relativistic components that free - stream , while @xmath63 is the total relativistic energy density , including both free - streaming and scattering components .",
    "@xmath121 is the energy density of the relativistic free - streaming particles , expressed as an equivalent number of neutrino species .",
    "consider a simple limit where the energy density of the free - streaming neutrinos and the total radiation is standard .",
    "if only @xmath122 of the three neutrino species free - stream , then @xmath123 relative to the position of the peaks expected for the standard model with three free - streaming neutrinos , there is a uniform shift in the position of the peaks to _ larger _ @xmath62 .",
    "this can only result if some of the known neutrinos are not free - streaming , and in this simple example the shift in @xmath62 is 7.8 for each scattering neutrino species .",
    "the result ( [ eq : lshiftscatt ] ) applies if the energy densities are standard .",
    "however , since non - standard physics is required to prevent free - streaming , it could well be that the neutrino energy densities are also non - standard , or there could be energy density from light pgbs .",
    "how does this effect the change in the position of the peaks induced by the phase shift @xmath124 ? from ( [ eq : rnugeneral ] )",
    "we need expressions for @xmath121 and @xmath71 .",
    "the value of @xmath71 is predicted in our theories by ( [ eq : nnuenergy ] ) , or ( [ eq : nnumu ] ) for a non - zero chemical potential , and a similar result can be derived for @xmath121 . in terms of these quantities",
    "@xmath125 clearly , in general the position of the peaks could be determined by a combination of extra neutrinos ( [ eq : lshift ] ) , scattering of the known neutrinos ( [ eq : lshiftscatt ] ) , and non - standard energy densities of the known neutrinos ( [ eq : lshiftdeltae ] ) . in this paper",
    "we limit our consideration to the case of theories with three neutrinos .",
    "we will find that the mass generation mechanism gives large regions where the prediction ( [ eq : lshiftdeltae ] ) differs significantly from the shift of @xmath126 expected in the standard model .",
    "the largest effect comes from @xmath127 , but a significant deviation from ( [ eq : lshiftscatt ] ) may result because the energy density in each free - streaming neutrino is non - standard .    in this section",
    "we have discussed two different cmb signals that occur in theories with three neutrino species if their interactions are non - standard .",
    "the first probes non - standard neutrino energy densities which lead to effects such as delayed matter radiation equality and enhanced damping of acoustic oscillations at higher @xmath62 .",
    "however , we have shown that such signals can result from a variety of underlying physics origins which lead to a change of @xmath71 .",
    "in contrast , the second signal  a uniform shift of the cmb peaks to larger @xmath62 , ( [ eq : lshiftscatt ] )  is a unique signal for the absence of free - streaming of one or more of the known neutrino species .",
    "if the physics leading to neutrino scattering also substantially affects the neutrino energy densities , then a measurement of @xmath1 would not only reveal neutrino scattering , but would also confirm non - standard energy densities .",
    "a complete analysis of the cmb energy density and scattering signals from the interactions of pgbs with neutrinos is complicated .",
    "several stages of spontaneous breaking of lepton flavor symmetries can each lead to several pgbs , and the combination of neutrino and pgb mass matrices leads to many parameters . in this section",
    "we study the simplest situation that leads to our cmb signals : a single pgb coupled to a single neutrino .",
    "there are three independent parameters , the pgb and neutrino masses , @xmath50 and @xmath128 , and the coupling strength @xmath79 of the interaction between them .",
    "this coupling parameter @xmath79 can be traded for the symmetry breaking scale at which the pgb is produced @xmath129 .",
    "we aim to discover whether , for typical values of the neutrino mass suggested by data , there are large regions in the @xmath130 parameter space that give observable cmb signals .",
    "we will first consider the case that the neutrinos are majorana , and later discuss the minor changes that must be made in the case of dirac neutrinos .      since @xmath20 is a pseudo - goldstone boson , at low energies it does not possess significant self - interactions , so that the only interaction of interest is given by the lagrangian term ( h+ig ) .",
    "this interaction results in three possibly interesting processes : @xmath131 , @xmath132 and @xmath133 . we will show that the first process has a rate that increases relative to the hubble expansion rate as the temperature of the universe decreases .",
    "therefore , this rate may lead to the recoupling required to produce the signals we seek .",
    "the second process may also couple neutrinos to the pseudo - goldstone boson .",
    "however , for @xmath134 the rate has a decoupling form and is therefore unable to produce either signal . instead",
    ", demanding that neutrinos and goldstone bosons be decoupled prior to big bang nucleosynthesis will lead to an upper bound on the coupling constant @xmath79 , and therefore a lower bound on @xmath42 .",
    "finally , the rate for @xmath135 will be shown to be too slow to produce a signal .    the first process , @xmath136 , is able to generate either a @xmath0 and @xmath137 signal .",
    "the regions of parameter space in which each signal is possible are clearly separated by simple kinematics . for a change in the effective number of neutrinos @xmath71 to be possible , @xmath20 must go out of the bath prior to @xmath138 ev .",
    "therefore , the scalar mass must satisfy @xmath139 ev . on the other hand , for the neutrinos to not free - stream during the era probed by the acoustic oscillations they must be scattering during the ev era . for this to be possible",
    "the scalar mass must satisfy @xmath140 ev .    to see more precisely in what regions of parameter space a signal results",

    "indeed , for the symmetry breaking coming from the charged lepton sector , neutrino oscillation data already tell us that there are large mixing angles between the two bases . hence ,",
    "if we consider the coupling to the heaviest mass eigenstate neutrino @xmath262 , we expect that @xmath263 will be a linear combination of all the pgb mass eigenstates without any small mixing angles .",
    "hence the suppression factor for all of them is only @xmath264 .",
    "if one of the pgb recouples we typically expect that they all do .",
    "this does not mean that the signal is insensitive to the neutrino spectrum , since the signal does depend on the number of neutrinos that get recoupled . from table [ table : nrec ]",
    "we see that the dependence on the number of recoupled neutrinos is large and future cmb experiments will be able to probe the nature of the neutrino spectrum , unlike the case of a single pgb discussed in the previous section .",
    "the change in the neutrino energy density is now so large that this has repercussions for the size of the scattering signal .",
    "this results from large deviations of @xmath71 from three in eqn .",

    "additionally , if some neutrinos that were coupled to the heavy pseudo - goldstone bosons are not coupled to the light pgb and hence free - stream , it is possible that @xmath265 . in general , assuming that all scattering neutrinos and light goldstone bosons were heated by the disappearance of the heavy pgbs , @xmath121 is given by n_fs = ( 3-n_r ) + ( n_- ( 3-n_r ) ) where @xmath266 or @xmath267 if the neutrinos are majorana or dirac and @xmath268 is the spin degeneracy of the light pgbs .",

    "the phase of the acoustic oscillations may give us information about the number of neutrino species that were coupled to the heavy pseudo - goldstone bosons and the number of heavy pgbs as well as the number of neutrinos that are scattering at an ev .",
    "an example of this is shown in table [ table : deltal ] , which shows the case of majorana neutrinos coupled to 8 heavy and 1 light pgb .",
    "we assume that one neutrino species is scattering and that this species was also heated by the decay or annihilation of the heavy pgbs .",
    "we see that in this case the @xmath1 shift has a noticeable dependence on the number of recoupled neutrino species , in contrast with eqn .",
    "( [ eq : lshiftscatt ] ) , and could be discovered with an observational resolution of @xmath270 .",
    "one aspect of the pgb couplings is very general , and is independent of the underlying symmetry structure , the @xmath14 multiplet structure and the interactions coupling @xmath14 to neutrinos .",
    "if a pgb is produced at a symmetry breaking of strength @xmath42 that produces a mass term @xmath128 for some neutrinos , then the pgb coupling strength to these neutrinos is @xmath271 .",
    "this means that the analysis of section [ sec:1nu ] applies to any individual pgb , providing @xmath128 is interpreted as the neutrino mass arising from this particular pgb coupling . for the majorana case ,",
    "the lines of figure 1 do not depend on @xmath128 , hence the only modification necessary is to rescale the @xmath42 axis by a factor @xmath272ev . from this",
    "we see that cmb signals may arise in _ any _ theory of majorana neutrinos where neutrino flavor symmetries are broken in the mass range @xmath273 for the dirac case , the slopes of some of the lines do depend on @xmath128 , and some limits depend on @xmath183 , so that the relevant regions are shifted to somewhat lower values of @xmath42 . we seek theories where lepton flavor symmetries are broken at the weak scale , or up to four orders of magnitude below the weak scale .",
    "whatever breaks the weak interaction might also break lepton flavor symmetries , either directly or at one or two loop order .",
    "this large range in @xmath42 allows a wide variety of models , not just those of eqn .",
    "( [ eq : tevops ] ) , but does not include the popular seesaw models where lepton number is broken quite close to the scale of grand unification . in general two factors contribute to explaining why the neutrinos are much lighter than the weak scale : @xmath274 and @xmath32 .",
    "the relative importance of these two factors is model dependent .",
    "however , for all models it is clear that a crucial ingredient is that an approximate lepton flavor symmetry is broken at some scale @xmath42 much less than the energy scale , @xmath17 , responsible for the physics of neutrino masses .",
    "below we choose two models to illustrate the rich range of possibilities .",
    "it may be that @xmath43 and the suppression of neutrino masses is entirely due to a small value for @xmath274 .",
    "as an example of such a theory , consider the seesaw model : @xmath275 where order unity couplings are understood .",
    "suppose that lepton number is spontaneously broken at the weak scale @xmath276 , while other lepton flavor symmetries are broken at some lower scale @xmath42 : @xmath277 .",
    "the light neutrinos are majorana with a mass seesawed down to @xmath278 , so that @xmath42 should be of order 1 gev .",
    "there are two very different types of pgb : @xmath20 and @xmath239 with symmetry breaking parameters @xmath4 and @xmath42 . from figure",
    "[ fig : majorana ] we find that either could give scattering or energy density cmb signals .",
    "the mass of @xmath20 would need to be close to 1 ev , but @xmath239 could give a signal for a wide range of masses .",
    "a discussion of realistic three neutrino theories with a single goldstone was given in section [ sec:3nu ] .",
    "with more than one goldstone an important new ingredient appears : multiple symmetry breaking scales @xmath42 .",
    "neutrino mass ratios may now arise from a hierarchy of @xmath79 parameters or from a hierarchy of @xmath42 parameters .",
    "of course , given the observed pattern of neutrino oscillations the hierarchies need not be large . in the case of hierarchical flavor symmetry breaking , for a fixed pattern of neutrino masses , smaller values of @xmath42 translate into larger values for @xmath79 . hence the couplings of the pgbs to the lighter neutrinos are larger than for the case of a single symmetry breaking scale , discussed in section [ sec:3nu ] , and the signal regions are correspondingly enhanced for the lighter neutrinos compared to the regions shown in figures [ fig : majorana3 ] and [ fig : dirac3 ] .",
    "a particularly interesting model with a hierarchy of global symmetry breaking scales is a @xmath279 theory of majorana neutrinos described by @xmath280 where @xmath281 carries overall lepton number , while the multiplet @xmath282 is a representation of @xmath283 .",
    "this theory not only has multiple symmetry breaking scales with hierarchical vevs of @xmath282 , but neutrino masses occur at second order in symmetry breaking , rather than at linear order .    the neutrino mass is a product of symmetry breaking terms @xmath284 that could lead , for example , to a hierarchical spectrum .",
    "the coupling of the goldstone of overall lepton number , @xmath285 , is proportional to the @xmath283 symmetry breaking : @xmath286 while the couplings of the goldstones of broken @xmath283 are proportional to the breaking of lepton number : @xmath287    the cmb signals for this model vary drastically as @xmath288 are varied . if @xmath289 there are no cmb signals .",
    "if only @xmath290 then there is a single flavor - diagonal pgb , @xmath285 , with signals as given in section [ sec:3nu ] . on the other hand",
    "if @xmath291 while @xmath292 , then there are several pgb , @xmath55 , which contribute to cmb signals and which may have a hierarchy of @xmath293 . if @xmath294 we have a model of majorana neutrinos where the maximal number of pgbs can contribute to cmb signals . since @xmath285 is a member of @xmath223 , it may have a small mass and give rise to a scattering signal . even though it derives from overall lepton number symmetry",
    ", it has a different coupling to each neutrino species , so that the scattering signal may correspond to 1,2 or 3 neutrinos depending on the neutrino spectrum .",
    "the 8 flavor pgb , @xmath55 , may all be @xmath224 type with larger masses , giving a very large @xmath295 signal as shown in table [ table : manyg ] .",
    "cmb signals are possible even if the lepton flavor symmetries are broken at scales as high as the electroweak scale , @xmath4 . however , observable signals result from a much wider range of pgb masses if @xmath297 .",
    "there are a variety of scenarios for naturally inducing symmetry breaking scales well beneath the weak scale ; in this section we study a supersymmetric theory .",
    "consider the superpotential below , where in addition to a dirac mass for the neutrino of the form of equation ( [ eq : tevops ] ) , we have added a mass @xmath298 for the right - handed neutrino . as we will argue later ,",
    "the natural size of @xmath298 is of order the weak scale , and therefore the neutrino masses in this theory are majorana .",
    "the theory has an r symmetry corresponding to lepton number under which @xmath299 and @xmath300 are all charged . in the absence of the mass term @xmath298 for the right - handed neutrino the theory has an additional right - handed lepton number symmetry under only @xmath18 and @xmath300",
    "are charged ; this symmetry is broken at the weak scale generating a right - handed neutrino mass .",
    "@xmath301    after supersymmetry and electroweak symmetry breaking , we obtain the coupling @xmath302 which leads to a dirac mass term , and the scalar potential @xmath303 where we have taken a common soft mass , @xmath304 , for @xmath305 and @xmath306 for simplicity . note that we have made a crucial assumption that @xmath300 does not feel supersymmetry breaking directly ; namely there is no soft mass for @xmath14 .",
    "this would occur , for example , in certain theories of gauge - mediated supersymmetry breaking if @xmath300 does not have any gauge interactions . since @xmath300 couples through @xmath28 to particles which do feel supersymmetry breaking , radiative corrections must induce a supersymmetry breaking mass at least as big as @xmath307 where @xmath79 is the largest coupling of @xmath300 to neutrinos .",
    "note that the sign is negative , and will induce symmetry breaking , in a very similar fashion to radiative electroweak symmetry breaking in the standard supersymmetric model .",
    "therefore , the vev of @xmath14 , namely @xmath42 , is given by @xmath308 for @xmath309 of order unity , we see that supersymmetry protects @xmath42 down to the scale @xmath310",
    ". if there are several @xmath300 multiplets with a hierarchy of couplings to neutrinos , then their symmetry breaking scales will reflect that hierarchy .",
    "the coupling @xmath79 is naturally small , @xmath311 , and is related to the observed neutrino mass as @xmath312 eliminating @xmath79 between eqs .",
    "( [ f1 ] ) and ( [ f2 ] ) we obtain an approximate expression for the scale @xmath42 given below @xmath313 a natural value for the scale @xmath298 at which right - handed lepton number is broken is the weak scale .",
    "this scale could for example be generated from a term of the form @xmath314 in the superpotential . here",
    "@xmath315 acquires a vev and thereby breaks right - handed lepton number , and @xmath316 is a coupling constant . if @xmath316 is of order one and the @xmath317 s have a soft mass of order the weak scale then @xmath318 can acquire a vev of order the weak scale radiatively , exactly the way the higgs does in the minimal supersymmetric model .    for @xmath319",
    "ev and @xmath320 gev we find that supersymmetry is able to protect @xmath42 down to 30 mev .",
    "this is the lowest @xmath42 for which our cmb signals are compatible with bbn constraints .",
    "larger @xmath42 could be obtained in this simple model of radiative lepton flavor symmetry breaking in several ways , for example by reducing the coupling @xmath309 or by introducing additional couplings of @xmath300 to the supersymmetry breaking sector .",
    "hence we conclude that no fine tuning is necessary anywhere in the wide range of @xmath321 parameter space that leads to cmb signals .",
    "we have proposed that future measurements of the cmb will provide a powerful probe of theories of neutrino mass that have lepton flavor symmetries spontaneously broken at or below the weak scale .",
    "such theories lead to light pseudo - goldstone bosons that interact with neutrinos with couplings proportional to the neutrino masses .",
    "such interactions can modify the acoustic oscillations of the electron - photon fluid during the ev era .",
    "in particular there is a change in the relativistic energy density , parameterized by an effective change in the number of neutrino species , @xmath0 , and a change in the multipole of the @xmath16th cmb peak , @xmath1 , for large @xmath16 .",
    "while other new physics could lead to an energy density signal , a uniform shift in the high @xmath16 peaks to larger @xmath62 can only result from scattering of the known neutrinos , and is therefore an ideal test of our class of theories .",
    "the present experimental limit on deviations from the relativistic energy density predicted by the standard model is roughly @xmath322 @xcite @xcite , although the precise numbers depend what other data are included in the fit .",
    "our predictions are well within these bounds , typically in the range @xmath323 .",
    "the planck experiment is expected to reach a sensitivity of @xmath324 at one standard deviation , and the proposed satellite experiment cmbpol could probe to @xmath325 @xcite .",
    "these projections assume that the neutrinos are free - streaming ; in the presence of our scattering signal we do not know how well the energy density can be measured .",
    "the inherent limit on @xmath0 from cosmic variance is at the level of @xmath326 for measurements up to @xmath62 of 2000 , if the cmb is to determine all the cosmological parameters @xcite .",
    "if the cmb is used only to determine @xmath71 , then the cosmic variance limit drops to @xmath327 .",
    "all numbers assume polarization correlations are measured as well as the temperature correlations .",
    "while the positions of the low @xmath16 cmb peaks are now accurately determined , the higher @xmath16 peaks will have to await future measurements at higher @xmath62 .",
    "to first approximation , our signal is @xmath328 , where @xmath329 is the number of neutrino species that scatter by pgb exchange during the ev era .",
    "this is a clear order of magnitude larger than the expected reach of planck , @xmath330 , and cmbpol , @xmath331 , always at 1 standard deviation @xcite .",
    "the signals can be precisely calculated in any particular theory of neutrino masses , and reflect both the spectrum of the neutrinos and whether the neutrinos are majorana or dirac .",
    "signals are expected for a wide range of lepton symmetry breaking parameters , 10 mev @xmath332 tev , and for a wide range of the pgb masses , @xmath333 mev .",
    "the signal regions for a goldstone boson produced at scale @xmath42 with mass @xmath50 are shown in figure 1 for majorana neutrinos and in figure 2 for dirac neutrinos . in the case that the same symmetry breaking scale @xmath42 produces all three neutrino masses , the signal regions are shown in figures 3 and 4 , for a hierarchical pattern of neutrino masses .",
    "the size of the signals differs in the regions labeled 1,2,3 , and the sizes of these regions change as the pattern of neutrino masses changes .    in many cases",
    "the scattering signal depends only on the number of scattering neutrino species and is given by @xmath334 , relative to the prediction of the standard model , which will be easily seen in upcoming experiments .",
    "on the other hand , the size of @xmath0 is highly dependent on the number and spectrum of pgbs and the neutrino spectrum . for a single pgb",
    "the signal is small ; for example , with a non - zero chemical potential @xmath335 for the dirac , majorana cases , for the pgb recoupling to @xmath336 neutrino species .",
    "the dependence on @xmath87 is mild , so that in this case the signal does not allow a discrimination between hierarchical , inverted or degenerate spectra .",
    "the size of the @xmath0 signal increases dramatically in theories with multiple pgb .",
    "this is partly due to the larger number of degrees of freedom , and partly because the interactions between different pgb generically sets the chemical potential to zero .",
    "for example , for 8 pgb , corresponding to breaking a @xmath283 lepton flavor symmetry , if all three neutrino are recoupled , @xmath337 , then @xmath338 for the dirac and majorana cases .",
    "the signals for @xmath339 are @xmath340 for the dirac case and @xmath341 for the majorana case .",
    "hence a precise measurement of @xmath0 has the ability to distinguish both the type and spectrum of the neutrinos . in cases such as this , where there is a large @xmath0 signal , there are deviations from the simple prediction for the scattering signal , @xmath1 , which now also depends on @xmath87 and the number of pgb .    for a theory of neutrino masses to give a cmb signal ,",
    "the crucial ingredient is the spontaneous breaking of lepton flavor symmetry at a scale @xmath42 of the weak scale or below .",
    "this does not occur in the conventional seesaw models .",
    "we have shown that the well - known radiative symmetry breaking mechanism of supersymmetry can yield such values for @xmath42 , and we have demonstrated that the explicit breaking of the global lepton symmetries expected from the planck scale leads to pgb masses precisely in the range that gives cmb signals . there is a rich variety of models with cmb signals .",
    "we have given two illustrations where the interactions of the neutrinos are bilinear in the field @xmath14 that breaks the lepton symmetries .",
    "in the first model the right - handed neutrinos are at the weak scale , @xmath4 , and the lightness of the neutrinos is due to powers of @xmath274 . in the second model",
    "there are two types of pgb , the flavor - diagonal majoron , and the flavor - changing pgb associated with @xmath283 .",
    "one possibility is that the latter contribute to a large @xmath0 signal , while the majoron is lighter and gives a scattering signal .",
    "it is remarkable that the cmb offers a powerful probe of this physics .",
