    "angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) is one of the well - known methods to probe the electron - phonon interaction in solids  @xcite .",
    "renormalization of the electronic energy due to the electron - phonon interaction has been explored by the observation of the electron dispersion relation near the dirac point ( the @xmath2 or @xmath7 points of the hexagonal brillouin zone ) in graphene  @xcite .",
    "the electron - phonon renormalization causes the appearance of a kink structure in the electron dispersion relation .",
    "the arpes intensity is expressed in terms of the self - energy , in which the real and imaginary parts of the self - energy determine the kink structure and the linewidth in the electronic energy dispersion , respectively  @xcite .",
    "it is known that the arpes spectra around the @xmath8 point and near the fermi level ( with binding energies around @xmath9@xmath10 ) do not exist for the direct optical transition because there is no corresponding energy state  @xcite .",
    "however , recent arpes experiments show that measurement of the arpes intensity around the @xmath1 point and near the fermi level could also provide valuable information on the electron - phonon interaction  @xcite . for example , liu _",
    "et al . _ have observed the arpes spectra at the @xmath1 point and near the fermi level for graphene - based materials  @xcite .",
    "they pointed out that the observation of arpes spectra originates from the _ indirect transition _ of electrons , which is mediated by phonons . in their experiment ,",
    "the observed arpes spectra with binding energies around @xmath11 and @xmath12 have been ascribed to the energy and momentum of the phonon at the @xmath2 ( or @xmath4 ) point .",
    "they suggest that the electron is scattered from the @xmath2 to the @xmath8 point by emitting a phonon through an indirect transition .",
    "however , the phonon dispersion from their experiment could not be determined because they used photon energies of more than @xmath13 .",
    "tanaka _ et al .",
    "_  have reported arpes spectra of highly - oriented pyrolytic graphite ( hopg ) around the @xmath1 point and near the fermi level for various photon energies less than @xmath14  @xcite .",
    "this experiment probes the energies and momenta of the electrons and phonons involved in the indirect transition , for different photon energies , so that the phonon dispersion of hopg can be obtained .",
    "they found that , when the incident @xmath15-polarized photons are incident on the sample surface , the arpes intensity increases like a step - function at the binding energies around @xmath11 and @xmath12 for @xmath16 and for @xmath17 , respectively , and that the arpes spectra can not be observed for incident photons in the range @xmath18@xmath14 in their experiment .",
    "however , not all the possible phonon dispersion relations of graphite could be well - resolved since hopg is not a single crystal of graphite .",
    "thus , the phonon modes involved in the indirect transition were not assigned properly from previous experimental measurements which were based on hopg .    in this work , motivated by the observations of the indirect transition arpes",
    "spectra  @xcite , we investigate the detailed mechanisms of indirect transitions in graphene and graphite by the calculation of the electron - photon interaction and the electron - phonon interaction based on first principles calculations  @xcite . by considering the indirect transition , we compare our theoretical calculation of the arpes intensity with the latest data from experimental measurements for hopg and a single crystal of graphite in order to evaluate and assign the origin of the observation of the phonon dispersion in graphene and graphite through arpes for various photon energies .",

    "although the longitudinal acoustic ( la ) phonon mode also has the even symmetry with respect to the mirror plane , the la phonon mode can not be observed due to the negligibly small electron - phonon matrix element in the vicinity of the @xmath2 point .",
    "we also find that the arpes spectra near the binding energy of @xmath11 can be assigned by the arpes intensity calculation as the to phonon mode for the applied photon energy @xmath19 , in which the relevant mechanism involves the resonant indirect transition . on the other hand , for the lower photon energy @xmath20",
