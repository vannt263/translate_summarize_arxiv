    "this basic fact is expressed in the second law of thermodynamics : _ the entropy of a closed system never decreases _ : @xmath1 where the entropy is denoted by @xmath2 .    in the 1870s ,",
    "ludwig boltzmann @xcite@xcite provided a description of the entropy relating the states of macro and micro - systems .",
    "he argued that any system would evolve toward the macrostate that is consistent with the largest possible number of microstates .",
    "the number of microstates and the entropy of the system are related by the fundamental formula : @xmath3 where @xmath4 jk@xmath5 is boltzmann s constant and @xmath6 is the volume of the phase - space that corresponds to the macrostate of entropy @xmath2 .",
    "the physical processes in any thermodynamical system are irreversible .",
    "consequently , any system always tends to its state of maximum entropy .    if we consider the maximal system , the universe , the situation is not so clear . in the past , the universe was hotter and at some point matter and radiation were in thermal equilibrium ( i.e. in a state of maximum entropy ) ; then , how can entropy still increase if it was at a maximum at some past time ?",
    "some attemps were made @xcite to answer this question , invoking the expansion of the universe : the universe actually began in a state of maximum entropy , but because of the expansion , it was still possible for the entropy to continue growing .",
    "the main problem with this type of explanation is that the effects of gravity can not be neglected in the early universe @xcite .",
    "roger penrose suggested that entropy might be assigned to the gravitational field itself .",
    "though locally matter and radiation were in thermal equilibrium , the gravitational field should have been quite far from equilibrium , since gravity is an atractive force and the universe was initially structureless @xcite .",
    "consequently , the early universe was globally out of equilibrium , being the total entropy dominated by the entropy of the gravitational field . in absence of a theory of quantum gravity , a statistical measure of the entropy of the gravitational field is not possible .",
    "the study of the gravitational properties of macroscopic systems through classic general invariants , however , might be a suitable approach to the problem .",
    "penrose proposed that the weyl curvature tensor can be used to specify the gravitational entropy .",
    "the weyl tensor is a 4-rank tensor that contains the independent components of the riemann tensor not captured by the ricci tensor .",
    "it can be considered as the traceless part of the riemann tensor .",
    "the weyl tensor can be obtained from the full curvature tensor by substracting out various traces .",
    "the riemann tensor has 20 independent components , 10 of which are given by the ricci tensor and the remaining by the weyl tensor .",
    "the weyl tensor is given by : @xmath7\\beta}-g_{\\beta[\\gamma}r_{\\delta]\\alpha})+\\\\ \\nonumber & + & \\frac{2}{(n-1)(n-2 ) } r~g_{\\alpha[\\gamma}g_{\\delta]\\beta},\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is the riemann tensor , @xmath9 is the ricci tensor , @xmath10 is the ricci scalar , @xmath11 $ ] refers to the antisymmetric part , and @xmath12 is the number of dimensions of space - time .",
    "the behaviour of the weyl tensor follows what is expected for the gravitational entropy throughout the history of the universe : it is zero in the ( homogeneous ) friedmann - robertson - walker model and it is large in the schwarzschild space - time .",
    "rudjord , gr@xmath0n and sigbj@xmath0rn @xcite made a recent attempt to develop a description of the gravitational entropy based on the construction of a scalar derived from the contraction of the weyl tensor and the riemann tensor .",
    "their phenomenological approach is based on matching their description of the entropy of a black hole with the hawking - bekenstein entropy @xcite . in particular , they calculated the entropy of schwarzschild black holes and the schwarzschild - de - sitter space - time .",
    "the main goal of the present study is to extend the calculation of the gravitational entropy to other space - time geometries and to analyse whether the proposal still works in more complex objects .",
    "in this section we provide a brief review of the work done by rudjord et .",
    "al . they suggested an estimator for the gravitational entropy taking into account the hawking - bekenstein entropy .",
    "the entropy of a black hole can be described by the surface integral : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the surface of the horizon of the black hole and the vector field @xmath15 is : @xmath16 with @xmath17 a unitary radial vector .",
    "the scalar @xmath18 is defined in terms of the weyl scalar ( w ) and the krestchmann scalar ( r ) .",
    "it takes the form : @xmath19 in order to find an acceptable description of the entropy of a black hole , it is required that equation [ sint ] be equal at the horizon to the hawking - bekenstein entropy : @xmath20 the latter equation allows to calculate the constant @xmath21 : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is boltzmann s constant , @xmath24 is the planck area , @xmath25 @xmath26@xmath27 @xmath28 is the constant of gravitation , and @xmath29 . as usual , @xmath30 is the planck s constant .",
    "in what follows we will set the constant @xmath21 equal to 1 since it plays the role of a scale factor in equation [ sint ] .",
    "this simplifies the notation .",
    "the entropy density can be then determined by means of gauss s divergence theorem , rewriting equation ( [ sint ] ) as a volume integral : @xmath31 here , the absolute value brackets were added to avoid negative or complex values of entropy .",
    "rudjord et .",
    "al . calculated the entropy density in schwarzschild , de sitter , and schwarzschild - de - sitter ( sds ) space - times .",
    "their investigations of the de sitter space - time led them to conclude that the entropy of the cosmological horizon can not be gravitational .",
    "they suggested two different interpretations : either the horizon entropy is in general of different nature from gravitational entropy or , if a cosmological constant is introduced , there is a thermodynamical factor related to it .",
    "the schwarzschild space - time seems to have only gravitational entropy .",
    "then , the schwarzschild and de sitter space - times were interpreted as two extreme cases of the sds space - time .",
    "this result is what is expected from a reasonable description of the gravitational entropy : large thermodynamical entropy in the early universe and large gravitational entropy around black holes .    in the next section we present the results of our calculations of the gravitational entropy and density for more complex objects : reissner - nordstrm , kerr , kerr - newman black holes , and a special case of wormhole using rudjord et .",
    "al.s conjecture .",
    "the reissner - nordstrm metric @xcite is a spherically symmetric solution of the einstein field equations @xcite .",
    "it is not a vacuum - solution since the source has electric charge @xmath32 , and hence there is an electromagnetic field .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor of this field is : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the electromagnetic field strength tensor and @xmath35 is the electromagnetic 4-potential . outside the charged object",
    "the 4-current @xmath36 is zero , so the maxwell equations are : @xmath37    the solution for the metric is given by : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the schwarzschild radius and : @xmath40 is related to the electric charge @xmath32 .",
    "the study of the metric shows the presence of two different horizons : the outer ( @xmath41 ) and the inner ( @xmath42 ) horizons : @xmath43 if @xmath44 , the outer horizon becomes schwarzschild s and the inner horizon collapses into a central singularity . we shall discuss a formulation of the gravitational entropy in terms of both horizons .    in order to find @xmath18",
    ", we calculate the weyl scalar and the kretschmann scalar .",
    "the results are : @xmath45 and @xmath46    therefore , @xmath18 is given by : @xmath47    according to rudjord et .",
    "@xcite , in order to find the gravitational entropy we must operate in a 3-space .",
    "therefore , the spatial metric is defined as : @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the 4-dimensional space - time metric and the latin indices denote spatial components , @xmath50 , @xmath511,2,3",

    "the simple method that rudjord et .",
    "al . developed in the case of the schwarzschild black hole was to integrate over a small sphere with radius @xmath55 around the origin , and to substract this from integral [ sint ] .",
    "this yields : @xmath56 the scalar @xmath18 does not depend on @xmath57 and @xmath58 , so we have : @xmath59\\int_0^{2\\pi } \\int_0^\\pi \\sin \\theta d \\theta d \\phi \\notag . \\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] when @xmath60 , the entropy of the horizons is obtained : @xmath61 by replacing equation [ rnh ] into equation [ s+ ] we can see that when @xmath44 , the entropy of the outer horizon becomes the schwarzschild entropy @xcite . for the inner horizon",
    "we obtain an indeterminate form : @xmath62    a possible interpretation of the last limit is the following : when the electric charge goes to zero , the inner horizon collapses into the singularity .",
    "in other words , the entropy of the inner horizon goes to the entropy of the singularity .",
    "general relativity is not an epistemologically well - determined theory : the language of the theory says nothing about the singularity because continuum space - time does not exist there .",
    "we now calculate the entropy density using equation [ den ] .",
    "we get : @xmath63 where : @xmath64 and @xmath65.\\ ] ]    again , if @xmath44 , we obtain the same result as in the schwarzschild case . figure [ fig : rn_entropy_density ] shows a plot of @xmath66 for different values of the charge .    , @xmath67 .",

    "the function @xmath66 is not defined at @xmath69 and it tends asymptotically to zero for large values of the radius .",
    "this is actually what it is expected of a good description of the entropy density for reissner - nordstrm black holes : @xmath66 can not be defined at the origin because of the presence of a singularity , and goes to zero as the field decreases .",
    "furthermore , one of the minima of the function @xmath66 is at @xmath70 where the inner cauchy horizon is located .",
    "this horizon is near two relative maxima and an other relative minimum of the function @xmath66 .",
    "a possible explanation is that in the case of reissner - nordstrm black hole , near the cauchy horizon , there is a small region of space - time where the curvature is high and potentially unstable against external perturbations , as shown by poisson and israel @xcite .",
    "the behaviour of the entropy density for @xmath71 $ ] could then be reflecting the accumulation of gravitational energy and entropy in that region , and the instability of the inner horizon .    . here , @xmath72 , @xmath67",

    "contrary to black holes , wormholes are holes in space - time , i.e. , their existence implies a multiple - connected space - time @xcite .",
    "there are many types of wormhole - like solutions of the einstein field equations @xcite .",
    "let us consider the static spherically symmetric line element : @xmath73 here , @xmath74 and @xmath75 are two arbitrary functions to be constrained by the required properties of the wormhole .",
    "the function @xmath75 is called `` the shaped function '' because it determines the spatial shape of the wormhole , whereas @xmath76 determines the gravitational redshift and is called the `` redshift function '' .",

    "it decreases from @xmath79 to a minimum value @xmath80 , the radius of the throat ; then it increases from @xmath80 back to @xmath79 as distance to the throat increases .",

    "these `` junction conditions '' allow to determine the specific form of the functions @xmath83 and @xmath76 .",
    "one possible case is to confine the exotic material , that keeps the throat open , to the interior of a sphere of surface radius @xmath84 .",
    "the vacuum region outside @xmath84 constrains the external space - time geometry to have the standard schwarzschild form @xcite : @xmath85    there are some other solutions in which the exotic material is limited to the throat vecinity . morris and",
