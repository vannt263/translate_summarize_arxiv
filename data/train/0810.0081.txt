    "the subject of quantum vacuum energy ( the casimir effect ) dates from the same year as the discovery of renormalized quantum electrodynamics , 1948 @xcite .",
    "it puts the lie to the naive presumption that zero - point energy is not observable . on the other hand , because of the severe divergence structure of the theory , controversy has surrounded it from the beginning .",
    "sharp boundaries give rise to divergences in the local energy density near the surface , which may make it impossible to extract meaningful self - energies of single objects , such as the perfectly conducting sphere considered by boyer @xcite .",
    "these objections have recently been most forcefully presented by graham , jaffe , et al .",
    "@xcite and by barton @xcite , but they date back to deutsch and candelas @xcite .",
    "in fact , it now appears that these surface divergences can be dealt with successfully in a process of renormalization , and that finite self - energies in the sense of boyer may be extracted .",
    "gravity couples to the local energy - momentum tensor , and such surface divergences promise serious difficulties .",
    "how does the completely finite casimir interaction energy of a pair of parallel conducting plates , as well as the divergent self - energies of non - ideal plates , couple to gravity ?    for a beginning of the renormalization of einstein s equations resulting from singular casimir surface energy densities see ref .",
    "brown and maclay @xcite showed that , for parallel perfectly conducting plates separated by a distance @xmath0 in the @xmath1-direction , the electromagnetic stress tensor acquires the vacuum expectation value between the plates @xmath2 outside the plates the value of @xmath3 .",
    "now we turn to the question of the gravitational interaction of this casimir apparatus .",
    "it seems this question can be most simply addressed through use of the gravitational definition of the energy - momentum tensor , @xmath4 for a weak field , @xmath5 , ( schwinger s definition of @xmath6 ) . since the gravitational field is weak , we can ignore @xmath7 .",
    "the change in the gravitational energy , for a static situation , is therefore given by ( @xmath8 ) @xmath9 if we replace @xmath10 by @xmath11 in ( [ t ] ) , we obtain an expression which is not gauge invariant , that is , which is dependent on the coordinate system chosen , because @xmath12 on the plates . to obtain a physically meaningful result , we must adopt an interial coordinate system , which corresponds to the use of the fermi metric : @xmath13 here , the cartesian coordinate system attached to the earth is @xmath14 , where @xmath1 is the direction of @xmath15 .",
    "the cartesian coordinates associated with the casimir apparatus ( plate separation @xmath0 , length @xmath16 ) are @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is normal to the plates , and @xmath19 and @xmath20 are parallel to the plates .",
    "the angle between @xmath18 and @xmath1 is arbitrary .",
    "now let the apparatus be rigidly displaced by an amount @xmath21 , a constant .",
    "then we see that the gravitational force per area @xmath22 on the apparatus is independent of orientation : @xmath23 a small upward push .",
    "this is exactly what the equivalence principle would predict .",
    "thus the total energy of the casimir apparatus , consisting of the mass @xmath24 of the plates plus the casimir energy , undergoes the same acceleration , @xmath25 where the mass per area of the plates is @xmath26 . for more details , see ref .",
    "relativistically , uniform acceleration @xmath27 is described by hyperbolic motion @xmath28 which corresponds to the metric @xmath29 the dalembertian operator has in these coordinates a cylindrical form @xmath30    in this section we will consider the casimir energy due to parallel semitransparent plates .",
    "such a plate is described by a @xmath31-function potential , @xmath32 , if the plate is perpendicular to the @xmath33 direction . note that in the limit @xmath34 such a potential imposes a dirichlet boundary condition on a scalar field . for two semitransparent plates , at @xmath35 and @xmath36 , respectively , the green s function can be written as @xmath37 where the reduced green s function satisfies @xmath38g= \\frac1\\xi\\delta(\\xi-\\xi'),\\label{rgfe}\\ ] ] which we recognize as just the parallel semitransparent cylinder problem with @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the canonical energy - momentum for a scalar field is given by @xmath41 where the lagrange density includes the @xmath31-function potentials .",
    "using the equations of motion , we find for the energy density , @xmath42 here @xmath43 follows from @xmath44 .",
    "the force density is given by @xmath45 so the gravitational force / area on the system is @xmath46 @xmath47 is given in terms of modified bessel functions .      in the weak acceleration limit , @xmath48 , the green s function corresponding to two parallel plates , following from ( [ rgfe ] ) , reduces to exactly the expected result , for example , for @xmath49 @xmath50,\\ ] ] where @xmath51 and @xmath52      if we now use ( [ gf ] ) , and take the @xmath48 limit , we find the following form for the gravitational force on the vacuum energy of the apparatus : @xmath53\\nonumber\\\\ & = & -(\\mathcal{e}_c+\\mathcal{e}_{d1}+\\mathcal{e}_{d2}),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is just the negative of the casimir energy of the two semitransparent plates , including divergent parts @xmath54 associated with each plate . the divergent terms simply renormalize the bare mass / area @xmath55 of each plate : @xmath56 and thus the gravitational force on the entire apparatus obeys the equivalence principle @xcite @xmath57",
    "a casimir apparatus undergoing centripetal acceleration ( @xmath58 ) also can be shown @xcite to experience the expected acceleration , in terms of @xmath59 , the center of energy of the entire renormalized system , @xmath60",
    "we have demonstrated that casimir energy gravitates just like any other form of energy , @xmath61 .",
    "this result , obtained by a variational calculation , is independent of the orientation of the casimir apparatus relative to the gravitational field .",
    "although there was a certain period of confusion @xcite , there now seems to be complete agreement on this result @xcite .",
    "although gravitational energies have a certain ill - defined character , being gauge- or coordinate - variant , this result is obtained for a fermi observer , the relativistic generalization of an inertial observer .",
    "this conclusion is supported by an explicit calculation in rindler coordinates , describing a uniformly accelerated observer .",
    "this demonstrates , quite generally , that the total casimir energy , including the divergent parts , which renormalize the masses of the plates , possesses the gravitational mass demanded by the equivalence principle .",
    "( for earlier work on the finite part only , see ref .",
    "@xcite . ) the inertial properties of casimir energies further are confirmed by considering centripetal acceleration .",
    "we hope to consider the acceleration of a boyer sphere in the near future .",
