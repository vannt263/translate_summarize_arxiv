    "therefore , the solution idea for the noncausal iid is inapplicable to the causal iid problem . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "the solutions to the causal iid problem are only limited to a class of bounded forcing term generated by an exosystem . for a class of forcing term generated by a linear exosystem , the iid can be given exactly by solving a sylvester equation proposed in @xcite .",

    "furthermore , by using higher - order sliding mode differentiators , it was modified in @xcite for an unknown matrix @xmath30 however , both dynamic generators do not cover the case that @xmath13 is singular as they require obtaining @xmath31 .",

    "the same difficulty also exists in solving a time - varying sylvester equation .    in this paper , we propose a new causal dynamic iid generator for a class of perturbed forcing terms generated by linear exosystems .",
    "analysis shows that the equation ( [ easy ] ) is solvable if @xmath13 is singular under the conditions consistent with that for  the sylvester equation proposed in @xcite .",
    "furthermore , to suppress the perturbation by the noise , the parameters are partly chosen via @xmath0 optimization so that the error bound caused by the perturbation can be evaluated . to show the advantage ,",
    "the proposed iid generator is also applied to a slowly time - varying unstable differential equation in the simulation .",
    "compared with existing similar generators , it avoids computing @xmath31 so that it can cover the case that @xmath13 is singular , and is further easier to apply to matrix differential equations with slowly time - varying system matrices .",

    "<S> the design of ideal internal dynamics ( iid ) generators , namely solving iid , is a fundamental problem , which is a key step to handle the nonminimum - phase output tracking problem . in this paper , for a class of unstable matrix differential equations , a new causal dynamic iid generator is proposed , whose parameters are partly chosen via @xmath0 optimization . compared with existing similar generators , it is applicable to matrix differential equations with singular system matrices and is easily extended to slowly time - varying matrix differential equations without extra computation .    </S>",
