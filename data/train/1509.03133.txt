    "we make the following convention for a function @xmath24 defined on @xmath25 : @xmath26and we will apply the same principle to other functions defined over @xmath27 .",
    "before we give the boundary conditions that we shall consider on @xmath28 , we have to introduce first a generalized version of a weak normal derivative of a function @xmath24 on the interface @xmath28 .",
    "we notice that the definition given below is a version of the one introduced in @xcite .",
    "let @xmath29 denote the surface measure on @xmath30 , that is , the restriction to @xmath31 of the @xmath32-dimensional hausdorff measure , and recall that @xmath9 is well defined as a unit normal vector on @xmath6 . since by assumption @xmath10 may be so irregular that no normal vector @xmath33 can be defined on @xmath10 , we will use the following generalized version of a normal derivative of a function on @xmath28 .",

    "if @xmath44 and @xmath45 exists , then we will denote by @xmath46 and call it the generalized @xmath47-normal derivative of @xmath24 on @xmath28 .    .",

    "let @xmath50 be the exterior normal vector to @xmath51 at @xmath28 .",
    "then the exterior normal vector to @xmath52 at @xmath28 should be @xmath53 ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "let @xmath54 be such that there are @xmath36 and @xmath55 satisfying @xmath56for all @xmath38 . on the other hand , since @xmath57 , then using the classical green formula ( recall that we are in the situation where @xmath58 has a lipschitz continuous boundary )",
    ", we have that for all @xmath38 , @xmath59 moreover , @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "it follows from and that in this case , @xmath63 and @xmath64 so that @xmath65 and hence , @xmath66 we will always use the generalized green type identity and the generalized @xmath47-normal derivative of a function @xmath24 on @xmath28 introduced above .",
    "now , on the interfacial region @xmath10 we impose the dynamic boundary condition formally given by @xmath67where we are primarily interested in nonlinear sources at the interface @xmath10 such that@xmath68the function @xmath69 satisfies @xmath70 for @xmath15-a.e . @xmath71 but it is _ not identically _ equal to zero on @xmath10 and @xmath72 is a real number .",
    "note that the condition on @xmath73 implies that @xmath73 has a bad sign and is of superlinear growth at infinity ( i.e. , @xmath74 as @xmath75 , for some @xmath76 and @xmath77 ) . in ( [ m2 ] ) , we define @xmath78 as a non - local operator in the following fashion ( see section [ sub-22 ] below ) : @xmath79for functions @xmath80 such that @xmath81 and @xmath82where the kernel @xmath83 is symmetric and satisfies @xmath84for all @xmath85 , @xmath86 , for some constants @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "a basic example is @xmath89 . in this case , @xmath90 is a nonlocal operator characterizing the presence of anomalous `` fractional '' diffusion along @xmath10 .",
    "the @xmath47-normal derivative @xmath91 of @xmath24 in is understood in the sense of .",
    "we mention that if @xmath10 is a lipschitz hypersurface of dimension @xmath32 , then the condition reads @xmath92finally , initial conditions for , and must also be prescribed on @xmath93 and on @xmath94 respectively .    the interface problem , and with a more simple transmission condition ( [ m2 ] ) on @xmath10 , i.e. when @xmath95 @xmath96 and @xmath97 , is often encountered in the literature in heat transfer phenomena , fluid dynamics and material science , and in electrostatics and magnetostatics .",
    "it is the usual case when two bodies materials or fluids with different conductivities or diffusions are involved .",
    "the corresponding transmission problem for the linear elliptic equation assuming that the interface @xmath10 is at least lipschitz smooth and @xmath96 , @xmath97 , has been considered by a large group of mathematicians including o.a .",
    "ladyzhenskaya and n.n .",
    "uraltseva since the 1970 s ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we also refer the reader to the recent book of borsuk @xcite . under the same foregoing assumptions the ( linear )",
    "parabolic transmission problem has also been investigated recently in @xcite ( and the references therein ) in the case when @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "the transmission problem with a linear dynamic ( i.e. , when @xmath100 ) transmission condition on a smooth surface @xmath10 ( so it can be flattened ) and its influence of the solution was studied in @xcite  in the autonomous case .",
    "finally , a linear interface problem with linear dynamic transmission condition involving the surface diffusion @xmath101 on @xmath10 and allowing both cases in which @xmath47 is nondegenerate and degenerate , and when the interface @xmath10 is a @xmath102-dimensional lipschitz hypersurface was also considered in @xcite .",
    "when @xmath10 is rough and fractal - like has also attracted considerable interest over the recent years due to their importance in various engineering , physical and natural processes , such as , hydraulic fracturing , a frequently used engineering method to increase the flow of oil from a reservoir into a producing oil well @xcite , current flow through rough electrodes in electrochemistry @xcite or diffusion and biological processes across irregular physiological membranes @xcite .",
    "it is our goal to give a unified analysis of these transmission problems for a large class of fractal - like interfaces , to go beyond the present studies which have focused mainly on the linear interface problem with linear transmission conditions and mainly well - posedness like results .",
    "we will derive stronger and sharper results in terms of existence , regularity and stability of bounded solutions .",
    "then we also show the existence of finite dimensional attractors for the nonlinear transmission problem , and especially in non - dissipative situations in which a bad source @xmath73 ( via ( [ bad - h ] ) ) is present along @xmath10 such that energy is always fed in all of @xmath93 through @xmath10 but eventually dissipated completely by a nonlinear `` good '' source @xmath2 .",
    "it turns out that blow - up phenomena and global existence are strictly related to competing conditions and the behavior of the nonlinearities @xmath103 at infinity as @xmath104 .",
    "we state sharp balance conditions between the bulk source / sink @xmath2 and interfacial source @xmath105 allowing us to directly compare them even when they are acting on separate parts of the domain @xmath106 on @xmath93 and on @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "notably , similar ideas have been used by gal @xcite in the treatment of parabolic @xmath107-laplace equations with nonlinear reactive - like dynamic boundary conditions ( cf . also bernal and tajdine @xcite for parabolic problems subject to nonlinear robin conditions ) , and by gal and warma in @xcite to give a complete characterization of the long - time behavior as time goes to infinity ( in terms of a finite dimensional global attractor , @xmath108-limit sets and lyapunov functions ) for semilinear parabolic equations on rough domains subject to nonlocal robin boundary conditions .",
    "since most of the aforementioned applications have a real physical meaning in non - reflexive banach spaces , like @xmath109 or @xmath110 , our prefered notion of generalized solutions and nonlinear solution semigroups will naturally be given in @xmath111-type spaces .",
    "it is this context in which in fact our balance conditions on the nonlinearities become also optimal and sharp in a certain sense . in this work",
    ", we also develop a unified framework in order to resolve the difficulties coming from having to deal with a rough fractal - like interface @xmath10 , and develop new tools based on potential analysis to handle the present case .",
    "this new approach allows us to not only overcome the difficulties mentioned earlier , but also to do so using only elementary tools from sobolev spaces , nonlinear semigroup theory and dynamical systems theory avoiding the use of sophisticated tools from harmonic analysis .",
    "the remainder of the paper is structured as follows . in section [ prelim ]",
    ", we establish our notation and give some basic preliminary results for the operators and spaces appearing in our transmission model . in section strong - sol ,",
    "we prove some well - posedness results for this model ; in particular , we establish existence and stability results for strong solutions . in section [ gl ] , we prove results which establish the existence of global and exponential attractors for , and .",
    "section [ bl ] contains some new results on the blow - up of strong solutions .",
    "in this section we introduce the functional framework associated with the transmission problem in question and then derive semigroup type results for the linear operator corresponding to the linear problem .",
