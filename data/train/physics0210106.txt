    "the problem of electromagnetic ( em ) wave propagation and related phenomena in relativistic plasmas has attracted considerable attention in the recent past . from the nonthermal emission of the high - energy radiation coming from a variety of compact astrophysical objects it has become possible to deduce the presence of a population of relativistic electrons in the plasma created in the dense radiation fields of those sources @xcite .",
    "the principal components of these plasmas could be either relativistic electrons and nonrelativistic ions ( protons ) , or relativistic electron - positron ( e - p ) pairs .",
    "relativistic e - p dominated plasmas may be created in a variety of astrophysical situations .",
    "the e - p plasmas are likely to be found in pulsar magnetospheres @xcite , in the bipolar outflows ( jets ) in active galactic nuclei ( agn ) @xcite , and at the center of our own galaxy @xcite .",
    "the presence of e - p plasma is also argued in the mev epoch of the early universe . in the standard cosmological model ,",
    "temperatures in the mev range ( @xmath0k@xmath1mev ) prevail up to times @xmath2sec after the big bang @xcite . in this epoch ,",
    "the main constituent of the universe is the relativistic e - p plasma in equilibrium with photons , neutrinos , and antineutrinos .",
    "contemporary progress in the development of super strong laser pulses with intensities @xmath3 has also made it possible to create relativistic plasmas in the laboratory by a host of experimental techniques @xcite . at the focus of an ultrastrong laser pulses , the electrons can acquire velocities close to the speed of light opening the possibility of simulating in the laboratory the conditions and phenomena that , generally , belong in the astrophysical realm @xcite .",
    "elucidation of the electromagnetic wave dynamics in a relativistic plasmas will , perhaps , be an essential tool for understanding the radiation properties of astrophysical objects as well as of the media exposed to the field of superstrong laser radiation .",
    "although the study of wave propagation in relativistic plasmas has been in vogue for some time , it is only in the recent years that the nonlinear dynamics of em radiation in e - p dominated plasmas @xcite has come into focus .",
    "the enhanced interest stems from two facts : 1 ) e - p plasmas seem to be essential constituents of the universe , and 2 ) under certain conditions , even an ultrarelativistic electron - proton plasma can behave akin to an e - p plasma @xcite .",
    "recently , we firstly found dark soliton as well as vortex soliton solutions in e - p plasma @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is also shown analytically that dark soliton is the natural nonlinear coherent structure in unmagnetized cold e - p plasmas . however , it is conceivable that soliton solutions obtained in a one dimensional formulation will turn out to be unstable in higher dimensions , which may lead to the creation of vortex solitons .",
    "since dark and vortex solitons are asymptotically nonvanishing , they have received much less attention than their localized cousins due to the generally accepted requirement that the fields be localized in physical system . however , in recent experiments studying laser field dynamics in different kinds of optical media , it was demonstrated that dark and vortex solitons can be readily created as superimpositions upon a localized field background @xcite .",
    "vortex soliton solutions are also found in imperfect bose gas in the superfluids @xcite , and they are extensively investigated and discussed @xcite . in this paper , we systematically investigate the instability of dark solitons and show that it can lead to the formation of vortex solitons .",
    "we speculate about interesting application of the vortex soliton in the early universe .    in the recent paper @xcite ,",
    "we had developed an argument for the creation of domains of nonzero angular momentum in the mev era of the early universe when it is supposed to be dominated by a plasma of e - p pairs .",
    "we first showed that in such a plasma the dynamics of a pulse of electromagnetic radiation , with a frequency much larger than the plasma frequency , is controlled by a generalized nonlinear schrdinger equation ( gnse ) with a defocusing nonlinearity .",
    "then , borrowing a result of nonlinear optics @xcite where the standard nonlinear schrdinger equation ( nse ) with a cubic nonlinearity has been investigated in great depth and detail , we conjectured that even the gnse whose nonlinearity is similar in nature to that of nse will allow vortex soliton solutions with an angular momentum that is conserved during propagation .",
    "the latter system also allows dark soliton solutions in one dimension which are known to be unstable to two - dimensional ( 2d ) perturbations and eventually evolve to 2d vortex chains .    in this paper",
    "we demonstrate that the arguments given in ref .",
    "@xcite are actually borne out by the direct solutions of the derived gnse .",
    "we begin by analytically showing that the 1d dark solitons of the gnse are , indeed , unstable to 2d perturbations . in the process , we derive the instability criterion which agrees with the numerical solution of the linearized system .    the main part of the demonstration , however , comes from a numerical simulation of our gnse . starting from a broad variety of initial conditions",
    ", we find the eventual emergence of angular momentum carrying vortex solitons .",
    "that is , the stipulated solitonic structures are readily accessible within the framework of this general equation with a nonlinearity more complicated than that of nse .",
    "thus we can state with much greater confidence that electromagnetism , operative in the mev era , could easily be the primordial source of angular momentum associated with various structures of the observable universe .",
    "we again stress that the present results are quite general in the nonlinear dynamics in an electron positron plasma .",
    "in the envelope approximation , a finite amplitude , circularly polarized electromagnetic ( em ) pulse propagating in a relativistic e - p plasma obeys ( for details , see @xcite ) : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the slowly varying amplitude of the perpendicular ( to the propagation direction ) vector potential , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 is the `` comoving '' ( with group velocity @xmath8 ) coordinate . here",
    "@xmath9 is the electron langmuir frequency , @xmath10 is the number density of the unperturbed background ( subscript @xmath11 denotes the value at infinity ) , @xmath12 is the lorentz factor , and @xmath13 with @xmath14 , denoting the @xmath15-th order modified bessel functions of the second kind , is the enthalpy density .    in this approximation",
    "the continuity equation , determining the number density @xmath16 , becomes @xmath17^{1/2 } } , \\label{plasma current}\\ ] ] and the system is closed by the adiabatic equation of state @xmath18    the low frequency motion of the plasma is driven by the ponderomotive pressure [ @xmath19 of the high - frequency em field , and is independent of the sign of the particles charge .",
    "it is perfectly natural to assume that the electron and the positron fluids have equal temperatures ( @xmath20 ) in equilibrium so that their effective masses ( @xmath21 ) will also be equal",
    ". the radiation pressure will impart equal low - frequency momenta to both fluids allowing the possibility of overall density changes without producing charge separation .",
    "the charge neutrality conditions @xmath22 , @xmath23 has been assumed by neglecting the small inequality of the charge due to baryon asymmetry .",
    "it is also evident that the symmetry between the two fluids keeps their temperatures always equal ( @xmath24 ) if they were equal initially . in deriving ( [ nse])-([plasma current ] ) , we have also assumed that the plasma is transparent ( i.e. @xmath25 ) , and that the longitudinal extent of the pulse is much shorter than its transverse dimensions ( @xmath26 ) .    defining the normalized variables @xmath27 and noting that even with the assumption @xmath28 , the diffractive term can be the same order or even greater than the dispersive one for a highly transparent plasma ( @xmath29 ) , eq .",
    "( [ nse ] ) converts to the following gnse ( @xmath30 ) : @xmath31 with the nonlinearity @xmath32    equation  ( [ final nse ] ) admits a symmetric two - dimensional solitary wave solution . for stationary solitons ,",
    "the ansatz @xmath33 reduces ( [ final nse ] ) to @xmath34 with the potential @xmath35 defined as @xmath36 with the prime denoting the derivative with respect to its argument , and @xmath37 representing the nonlinear frequency shift .",
    "a numerical analysis of the solution of this eigenvalue problem is given in ref .",
    "because of the absence of @xmath38-derivatives in ( [ final nse ] ) , any pulse - like localized structure is allowed in the propagation direction . in the direction perpendicular to the propagation ,",
    "on the other hand , the amplitude was shown to approach a constant value . since there",
    "does exist a small baryon asymmetry in the early universe that acts on a longer characteristic length  @xcite , the extent of the constant amplitude region may be considered to be finite .",
    "due to the single - valuedness of the vector potential , @xmath39 must be an integer and @xmath40 must vanish at the origin for non - zero values of @xmath39 .",

'' strictly speaking , one must redefine the integrals of motion for non - vanishing boundary conditions @xcite , but such a renormalization is not important here because of the fact that infinite - extent solution is just a formal approximation .",
    "the presence of a small fraction of ions makes the physical solution decay at infinity @xcite .",
    "it is already suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite that dark stripe solitons are unstable and break into vortex filaments .",
    "when the amplitude is small ( @xmath46 ) , the nonlinearity reduces to the simple kerr - type , and the vortex dynamics of nse with such a nonlinearity has been studied in a variety of numerical calculations @xcite .",
    "our full nonlinearity is somewhat different and it has to be independently investigated . for this section , our goal is to show that the one - dimensional dark stripe solution is unstable against transverse perturbations in two dimensions .",
    "such an instability causes the breakup of the stripe leading to a chain of vortex solitons with alternating polarity .",
    "the one - dimensional stationary solution for the gnse ( [ final nse ] ) has the form @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) , where the real function @xmath49 satisfies @xmath50 since we are examining the linear stability of the solution with the least number of nodes , @xmath51 is assumed to be an odd function with a single node at the origin .",
    "let us perturb the one - dimensional solution by @xmath52 where the small perturbations @xmath53 and @xmath54 are real functions of @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "assuming sinusoidal behavior , @xmath57 and @xmath58 , the linearized gnse could be reduced to the following eigenvalue problem : @xmath59 where @xmath60    remembering that @xmath61 and @xmath62 , we can construct from ( [ combined full spectral ode for v ] ) the relation @xmath63 by multiplying @xmath64 on both sides and integrating with respect to @xmath55 .",

    ", we introduce a complex - valued function @xmath90 in ( [ iiia : linearization ] ) .",
    "then , the linearized equation looks @xmath91 where the prime denotes derivative with respect to its argument . putting @xmath92 and @xmath93 yields a linear eigenvalue equation for @xmath94 : @xmath95 we have numerically solved ( [ linst : spectral equation ] ) by the shooting method with boundary conditions @xmath96 ( @xmath97 ) and @xmath98 ( @xmath99 ) .",
    "it is clear from ( [ linst : spectral equation ] ) that the complex conjugate of the eigenfunction is also an eigenfunction .",
    "namely , if @xmath100 is an eigenfunction of ( [ linst : spectral equation ] ) corresponding to the eigenvalue @xmath101 , then @xmath102 is also an eigenfunction of ( [ linst : spectral equation ] ) corresponding to the eigenvalue @xmath103 , where the bar denoting the complex conjugate .    for @xmath104 ,",

    "first , we fix an arbitrary value on the real part of @xmath94 at @xmath116 .",
    "given an expectant eigenvalue , the imaginary part of @xmath94 is calculated from ( [ linst : asymptotic argument ] ) .",
    "then , the derivative @xmath117 is estimated by using ( [ asymptotics ] ) , and we can integrate ( [ linst : spectral equation ] ) from @xmath116 to @xmath99 by the 4-th order runge - kutta formula . the data of @xmath49 is drawn from the numerical solution of ( [ iiia : stationary state ] ) . at @xmath99 , the boundary condition @xmath98 is checked .",
    "if this boundary condition is not satisfied , we guess the next eigenvalue by the newton method and carry out the shooting again .",
    "the dispersion relation is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dispersion ] .",
    "we can see a good qualitative agreement with the analytic evaluation with the fact that the growth rate begins from zero as @xmath71 , experiences a maximum value with respect to @xmath88 , and the mode is finally stabilized for a sufficiently large @xmath88 .",
    "the eigenfunctions corresponding to @xmath118 , @xmath119 , and @xmath120 for the parameter @xmath121 are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : eigenfunctions ] . from fig .",
    "[ fig : dispersion ] , the mode with @xmath122 gives the maximum growth rate @xmath123 .",
    "as is seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : eigenfunctions ] , the imaginary part of the eigenfunction becomes wider and wider as @xmath71 , which agrees qualitatively with the analytical estimate .",
    "since we are performing the numerical shooting in the finite domain , it becomes difficult to estimate the correct eigenvalue in this regime .",
    "we will now present the numerical simulation of the dynamics of angular momentum creation from one - dimensional dark stripe solitons by solving the full nonlinear system ( [ final nse])-([sec2:nonlinearity ] ) .",
    "the calculation was carried out on a @xmath124 spatial mesh placed in a calculation box of size @xmath125 .",
    "the boundary conditions @xmath126 ( @xmath127 ) are imposed at the edges @xmath128 ( @xmath129 ) .",
    "note that these boundary conditions numerically respect the constants of motion in the domain of integration .",
    "as an input we choose the one - dimensional @xmath55 dependent stationary solution with @xmath121 .",
    "it is to be noted that the photon number and the hamiltonian are conserved to order @xmath130 during the calculation .",
    "since the initial value of the integrated angular momentum is zero , it is found to always remain zero ( within an error of order @xmath131 ) .",
    "strictly speaking , the eigenfunction in the previous section ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : eigenfunctions ] ) contains cores of angular momenta , i.e. crossings of the real and imaginary zeros of the field due to the periodic form of the perturbation in the @xmath56 direction .",
    "thus , the growth of small amplitude perturbation itself does not exactly mean the ` creation ' of angular momenta . in order to check the real creation of angular momenta from an exact zero everywhere ,",
    "we have first carried out the calculation with an initial condition of the form @xmath132 + { \\rm i } \\sqrt{1 - \\alpha^2 } g(x),\\ ] ] with @xmath133 , @xmath134 , and @xmath135 .",
    "this initial condition is so arranged that there is no crossing of the real and imaginary zeros .",
    "it is done by imposing a real - valued perturbation on a complex - valued stationary solution .",
    "the zero line of the imaginary part exactly coincides with the @xmath56-axis , while that of the real part deviates from the @xmath56-axis by @xmath136 .",
    "as the system evolves , we observe the creation of crossings and the appearance of vortex solitons .",
    "as the initial conditions are changed ( always starting form no crossings ) , the main qualitative result  the emergence of angular momentum carrying vortex soliton chains  is found to be fairly robust .",
    "next we investigate the evolution of the system under transverse perturbations of the form @xmath137 with @xmath138 and @xmath139 .",
    "the zero lines of the real and imaginary parts at @xmath140 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : crossing at time 2 ] . as we noted in sec .",
    "[ single vortex soliton ] , the crossing points of two zero lines correspond to the vortex centers .",
    "we initially have twelve crossings suggesting twelve vortices .",
    "these twelve vortices , however , do not have well - formed solitonic structures since they are too close , and overlapping .",
    "as the system evolves , the vortices move and we see annihilations of pairs of opposite polarity .",
    "the first annihilation event was observed in the interval @xmath141 ; two of the vortices destroy one another near the center , and the other two seem to disappear near the edge ; the annihilation of two pairs removes four from the original twelve at @xmath142 .",
    "the second annihilation event occurs during @xmath143 . as is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : annihilation ] , the zero lines of the real and imaginary parts tend to separate around the center @xmath144 .",
    "here two vortices approach the origin around @xmath145 , and then they are annihilated . after the annihilation , two inner vortices approach the origin . finally the remaining six vortices tend to spread and align with equal inter - vortex spacing ( see @xmath146 in fig .  [",
    "fig : annihilation ] ) .    the amplitude @xmath147 corresponding to this sequence",
    "is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : amplitude evolution ] . at @xmath148",
    ", the vortices do not quite look like vortex solitons , even though the number of vortices has been reduced to six .",
    "since the distance between adjacent vortices is still small , they overlap and are not quite independent .",
    "the central hump around @xmath149 is the remnant of the second annihilation event . with time , the peaks tend to expand to the central region and are sufficiently apart to look and behave like vortex solitons .",
    "by @xmath150 , we observe the formation of six solitonic structures as predicted in ref.@xcite ( see @xmath146 in fig .  [",
    "fig : amplitude evolution ] ) .",
    "notice that the vortices disappear only when annihilated by another with opposite polarity .",
    "after @xmath151 , a propagating wave is clearly seen in the region @xmath152 and @xmath153 where the field was originally flat ( see fig .  [ fig : radiation ] ) .",
    "this propagating field is the trace of the cherenkov radiation which comes from the non - integrability of the system @xcite .",
    "the radiation will propagate away from vortices . in the finite calculation domain",
    ", the radiation will be reflected back at the boundary .",
    "when we extend the time evolution further , we observe the third annihilation event around @xmath154 .",
    "however , this annihilation may be an artifact of the finite size of the domain .",
    "when we carry out the simulation in a domain larger than ( @xmath125 ) but with the same initial conditions , the third annihilation event takes place at a later time while the times of the first and the second annihilation events remain unchanged .",
    "the third annihilation event is likely to be driven by the reflection of the cherenkov radiation at the boundary .",
    "equivalently , it may be concluded that six vortex solitons are stable in our domain and may stay forever .",
    "it is noted that the distance among vortices at the final stage approximately coincides with the inverse of the wave number with the maximum growth rate @xmath155 .",
    "we have demonstrated the dynamics of angular momenta creation in a highly relativistic electron - positron plasmas subject to the passage of a strong pulse of electromagnetic fields .",
    "the system is governed by a generalized nonlinear schrdinger equation with a defocusing inverse square root type nonlinearity .",
    "it turns out that the one - dimensional dark soliton stripe solutions of this equation , just like those of the standard nonlinear schrdinger equation , are unstable to transverse perturbations . by carrying out a linear analysis ,",
    "we have found that there exists an instability window of transverse wave numbers for the system . by a numerical simulation of the fully nonlinear equation",
    ", we have shown that the transverse instability will yield , after a few annihilation events , a well - separated chain of vortex solitons with alternating , singly - charged polarity or topological charge ( @xmath156 ) .",
    "these singly - charged vortex solitons are topologically stable and do not disappear unless they collide with their compliments and annihilate .",
    "the number of the created vortex solitons seem to be determined by the inverse of the wave number @xmath155 with the maximum linear growth rate . for the box size @xmath125",
    ", the six vortex soliton state is found to be robust .",
    "we have suggested a simple and plausible mechanism of angular momentum generation in the mev epoch of the universe .",
    "electromagnetism , operating through the versatile substrate of the electron - positron plasma , seems to readily generate highly interesting , long - lived objects which are capable of carrying large amounts of mass , energy and angular momentum .",
    "since an initial localization of mass , energy and angular momentum is precisely the seed that gravity needs for eventual structure - formation , electromagnetism may have provided a key element in the construction of the large - scale map of the observable universe .",
