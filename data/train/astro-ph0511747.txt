    "the prevalence of black holes in present day galaxy bulges , and the proportionality between black hole and spheroid mass @xcite implies that the formation of the two components are intimately linked .",
    "one way to probe star formation in distant qsos is to observe them at submillimetre wavelengths , and so measure the amount of radiation from young stars which is absorbed and re - emitted by dust in the far infrared . with this in mind , we have observed matched samples of x - ray absorbed and unabsorbed qsos at 850@xmath1 m with scuba .",
    "these observations revealed a remarkable dichotomy in the submillimetre properties of these two groups of sources : x - ray absorbed qsos are often ultraluminous infrared galaxies , while x - ray unabsorbed qsos are not .",
    "this suggests that the two types are linked by an evolutionary sequence , whereby the qso emerges at the end of the main star - forming phase of a massive galaxy ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* carrera et  al .",
    "2006 , this volume ) .",
    "however , the nature of the x - ray absorption remains puzzling .",
    "it could be due to gas located within the agn structure , or from more distant material in the host galaxy .",
    "these objects are characterised by hard , absorbed x - ray spectra , but they have optical / uv spectra which are typical for qsos , with broad emission lines and blue continua .",
    "assuming that their hard x - ray spectral shapes result from photoelectric absorption from cold material with solar abundances , the column densities are @xmath2  @xmath3 .",
    "these properties are surprising : for a galactic gas / dust ratio , the restframe ultraviolet spectra would be heavily attenuated by such large columns of material . therefore in order to investigate the x - ray absorption , we have obtained deep ( 50100ks ) _ xmm - newton _ observations of three submillimetre bright , x - ray absorbed qsos from our sample of hard - spectrum _ rosat _ sources @xcite .",
    "the _ xmm - newton _ spectra were first fitted with a power law and fixed galactic absorption .",
    "surprisingly , the power law produces reasonable @xmath4 values . however , the photon indices are unusually hard for qsos , and the data show a deficit of counts relative to the model at the softest energies , indicating that absorption is present .",
    "the original _ rosat _ pspc spectra and the _ xmm - newton _ spectra show excellent agreement ( see fig . [",
    "fig : threeqsos ] ) .",
    "the hypothesis of a normal ( @xmath5 ) agn x - ray spectrum and a cold absorber is strongly rejected for rxj121803 and rxj124913 .",
    "therefore we considered ionised absorber models for the x - ray absorption , using the ` xabs ' model in spex , which includes both photoelectric and line absorption .",
    "for all three agn an acceptable fit can be obtained with a @xmath5 power law and an absorber with an ionisation parameter log  @xmath6 and column densities of @xmath7@xmath8  @xmath3 .",
    "these absorbers have similar properties to the high - ionisation absorber phases seen as outflows in some nearby seyfert 1 galaxies and qsos such as ngc3783 and pg1114 + 445 @xcite .    at these ionisation parameters and column densities ,",
    "the absorbers are likely to originate in the agn themselves , rather than in the host galaxies .",
    "this solution is attractive , because it is compatible with the lack of optical extinction in these objects : if the absorber is driven as a wind , either from the accretion disc or from evaporation of the inner edge of the molecular torus , then dust will be sublimated before ( or as ) it enters the flow .",
    "the low space density of x - ray absorbed qsos relative to unabsorbed qsos and to distant ultraluminous galaxies detected in blank field scuba surveys , implies that the x - ray absorbed qsos are caught during a short - lived transitional phase . before this brief phase , agn must be weak , and heavily obscured @xcite ; after this phase the host galaxy is essentially fully formed , and the naked qso shines brightly until its fuel is consumed .",
    "a number of theoretical models predict a very similar evolutionary pattern . in many of these models ,",
    "the qso terminates the star formation in the host galaxy by driving a powerful wind ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the epic spectra of our x - ray absorbed qsos suggest that the absorbers are ionised winds driven by the agn , and therefore that the transition between buried agn and naked qso is mediated by a radiatively driven wind from the agn , as predicted by these models .",
