    "in the present paper we review our approach to description of a nucleon , placed into nuclear matter .",
    "the in - medium characteristics of nucleon can tell us much about the medium itself . on the other hand",
    ", the introduction of nuclear matter enables to separate the problems of nucleon interactions from those , connected with individual features of specific nuclei .",
    "thus investigation of nucleon characteristics in nuclear matter is an important step for studies of physics of nuclei .    until mid 70-th the studies of nuclear matter were based on the nonrelativistic approach . since the publication of the paper @xcite description of the in - medium",
    "nucleon was based on dirac phenomenology .",
    "it was successful in describing most of characteristics of nucleons both in nuclear matter and in finite nuclei @xcite . in the meson exchange picture",
    "the vector and scalar fields correspond to exchange by the vector and scalar mesons between a nucleon and the nucleon of the matter .",
    "this picture is called quantum hadrodynamics ( qhd ) . in the simplest version",
    "( qhd - i ) only vector @xmath3 and scalar @xmath2 mesons are involved . in more complicated versions some other mesons",
    "are included @xcite . while the studies in framework of the nonrelativistic approach are going on , i.e. the applications of the nuclear density functional method provided very accurate description of the data @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , many efforts have been made to improve the qhd .",
    "there were many reasons for this .",
    "first of all , the qhd itself has several weak points .",
    "it is not clear , if the scalar @xmath2 meson does exist , the experimental data are controversial .",
    "it is rather an effective way of describing the two - pion exchange .",
    "the mass of this effective state is about 500  mev .",
    "the mass of vector @xmath3 meson is about 780  mev .",
    "hence , the exchange by theses mesons takes place at the distances , where the nucleon can not be treated as a point -like particle .",
    "thus the qhd inherited the problems of nonrelativistic phenomenology , connected with description of the interaction at small distances .",
    "the other weak points are discussed in @xcite . also , it is desirable to match the qhd with the quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) which is believed to be a true theory of strong interactions .",
    "another reason is that there are various problems in nuclear physics .",
    "it is desirable to have an approach , which would enable to calculate :    * the nucleon single - particle potential energy @xmath4 , where @xmath5 in the density of the baryon quantum number .",
    "this enables one to find the saturation density @xmath6 and the single - particle binding energy @xmath7 .",
    "* parameters of interaction with external fields . these are magnetic moments @xmath8 and the axial coupling constant @xmath9 .",
    "the latter is important for understanding of the chiral properties of the matter . *",
    "neutron  proton mass splitting in isotope - symmetric matter .",
    "it was observed for a number of nuclei , being known as the nolen  schiffer anomaly . * structure functions of the deep inelastic scattering .",
    "they describe the internal structure of nucleons .",
    "investigation of the latter is important for construction of the quark models of nucleons , for studies of the confinement , etc .",
    "the reasons for some of the in - medium modifications of the structure functions are still obscure .",
    "they become a subject for discussions from time to time . * the single particle potential energy for hyperons in nuclear matter .",
    "can a system of hyperons be stable ?",
    "in other words , can a strange matter exist ?",
    "as we said earlier , the first problem was solved in framework of dirac phenomenology @xcite for the values of density close to the saturation value .",
    "the nucleon was considered as a relativistic particle , moving in superposition of vector and scalar fields @xmath10 and @xmath11 . in the rest frame of the matter @xmath12 .",
    "the dynamics of the nucleon is described by equation @xmath13 with @xmath14 , @xmath15 . in nuclear matter the fields @xmath16 and @xmath11 depend only on the density @xmath5 , and do not depend on the space coordinates .",
    "the values of the fields are adjusted to reproduce either the data on nucleon ",
    "nucleon scattering or the nuclear data ",
    "see , e.g. @xcite .",
    "however , each of the other listed problems requires additional improvements of the qhd .",
    "turning to the other problems from the above list , note that the axial coupling constant changes due to polarization of medium by pions @xcite , with a crucial role of the delta - isobar excitations @xcite .",
    "thus , in order to solve the second problem one should introduce additional degrees of freedom into the qhd .",
    "also , the third problem requires introduction of the nuclear forces , which break the isospin invariance @xcite . finally ,",
    "the fourth problem is just unaccessible for traditional methods of nuclear physics .",
    "there were several attempts to combine the qhd and the quark structure of nucleons .",
    "the nucleon - nucleon forces , constructed within such models enabled to reproduce semi - quantitatively or quantitatively the nucleon characteristics in nuclear matter . in the quark",
    " meson coupling ( qmc ) model @xcite the nucleon was considered as a three - quark system in a bag .",
    "the quarks were directly coupled to @xmath2 and @xmath3 mesons .",
    "the values of the nucleon effective mass @xmath0 and of the in - medium coupling constant @xmath17 appeared to be somewhat smaller than in qhd @xcite .",
    "this model is employed nowadays as well @xcite .    in another class of works the short - range interaction between the nucleons",
    "was treated as interaction between their quarks .",
    "the latter were described in framework of some qcd motivated models .",
    "the long - range nn interaction was described in terms of nucleons and pions .",
    "these works were reviewed in @xcite .    during the two latest decades",
    "much work was done on development of the effective field theory ( eft ) .",
    "the starting point is the most general lagrangian , which includes nucleons and pions as the degrees of freedom and respects all the symmetries of qcd , i.e. the lorentz invariance , chiral symmetry , etc . @xcite .",
    "the applications of the eft is usually combined with the expansion in powers of the pion mass ( chiral perturbation theory ) .",
    "expansion in powers of low momenta is also usually carried out .",
    "the works , based on the eft are reviewed in @xcite , for some of recent developments - see @xcite .",
    "the eft approach does not touch the quark degrees of freedom of the nucleons .",
    "all the traditional nuclear physics approaches face difficulties in attempts to describe the nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) interaction at small distances . on the other hand , the quantum chromodynamics ( qcd )",
    "is believed to be a true theory of strong interactions .",
    "it has many unsolved problems at large distances .",
    "however , it becomes increasingly simple at small distances due to the asymptotic freedom .",
    "the interaction of quarks and gluons , which are the ingredients of qcd can be treated perturbatively .",
    "this is known as the asymptotic freedom @xcite .",
    "it is tempting to use this feature of qcd in building the nucleon forces .",
    "one should take into account , however , that due to spontaneous breakdown of the chiral symmetry of the qcd , the vacuum expectations of some qcd operators ( condensates ) have nonzero values .    in medium with a nonzero value of the density of the baryon quantum number the condensates change their values . also , some other condensates , which vanish in vacuum , obtain nonzero values .",
    "the qcd sum rules ( sr ) method describes the vacuum hadron parameters basing on the quark dynamics at short distances , where the asymptotic freedom works . in other words , the dynamics of the quark system at the distances of the order of the confinement radius is described basing on that at small distances , where it is determined by the qcd condensates .",
    "thus , the sr method enables to describe the hadron parameters in terms of the qcd condensates .",
    "the approach was worked out in @xcite , where it was used for mesons .",
    "it is based on the dispersion relation for the function , describing the system which carries the quantum numbers of the hadron .",
    "the sr method was successfully applied for nucleons in vacuum @xcite , describing all their static and some of dynamical characteristics ",
    "see @xcite for a review .",
    "thus it looks reasonable to try to apply the qcd sr method for the description of nucleons in nuclear matter .",
    "it was suggested in @xcite that the parameters of nucleon in nuclear matter can be expressed in terms of the in - medium values of qcd condensates . in medium with a nonzero value of the density of the baryon quantum number the condensates change their values . also , some other condensates , which vanish in vacuum , obtain nonzero values .",
    "the generalization of the sr method for the case of finite densities was not straightforward .",
    "one of the main problems was the choice of variables , which enabled to separate the singularities connected with the in - medium nucleon from those connected with the medium itself .",
    "this was done in @xcite@xcite .",
    "it was found also in these papers that the nucleon characteristics ( effective mass @xmath0 and the vector self - energy @xmath1 ) can be presented in terms of the vector and scalar condensates @xmath18 here @xmath5 and @xmath19 are the density and vector of the ground state of the matter , @xmath20 is the quark field , the summation over flavors @xmath21 is carried out .",
    "the vector condensate is written in the rest frame of the matter . due to conservation of the vector current",
    "the vector condensate is a linear function of @xmath5 @xmath22 is just the number of valence quarks in a nucleon .",
    "the scalar condensate can be represented as @xcite @xmath23 with @xmath24 caused by interaction of the nucleons of the matter . since @xmath25 can be expressed in terms of the pion ",
    "nucleon @xmath2 term @xcite , while the latter is related to observables @xcite , one can obtain the values of the nucleon parameters at least in the gas approximation . since @xmath24 is small for the densities , close to the saturation point",
    "( see below ) , the values obtained in such approach are close to the physical ones .",
    "they appeared to be @xmath26mev , and @xmath27mev close to the saturation point .",
    "thus , including only the condensates of the lowest dimension and neglecting the radiative corrections , we found that the qcd sr method reproduce the main features of the qhd @xcite .",
    "however , the role of the condensates of higher dimension remained obscure .",
    "the contribution of the gluon condensate @xmath28 is rather small .",
    "however , an estimation for the value of the four - quark condensate @xmath29 , which suggests itself , destroys the agreement with the walecka model . also , the lowest order radiative corrections are numerically large .",
    "this took place for the vacuum as well .",
    "this caused doubts in possibility to expand the sr method for the case of finite densities .",
    "the four - quark condensates are the most important among those of the higher dimension .",
    "their calculation requires some model assumption on the quark structure of nucleon .",
    "we employed the perturbative chiral quark model ( pcqm ) , suggested originally in @xcite .",
    "we calculated these condensates @xcite and found that previous naive estimation of its contribution was wrong , due to some cancelations which take place in any reasonable model.we demonstrated that the sr method provides the dependence of the nucleon characteristics @xmath0 and @xmath1 on the density @xmath5 and on the neutron - to - proton density ratio @xcite , which is consistent with the results obtained by using traditional nuclear physics methods .",
    "we analyzed the role of radiative corrections for the nucleon sr in vacuum and demonstrated that their influence on the value of the nucleon mass is small @xcite .",
    "also , in nuclear matter the radiative corrections do not change much the nucleon characteristics @xmath0 and @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "we found that the nonlinear contribution to the scalar condensate @xmath24 is determined mainly by the pion contribution to the self - energy of the nucleon of the matter .",
    "simple estimations show that this term may provide a saturation mechanism in our approach @xcite .",
    "however , a rigorous treatment requires renormalization of the pion propagator by the particle - hole excitations .",
    "the renormalized pion propagator depends on the nucleon effective mass @xmath0 and on the in - medium value of the pion ",
    "nucleon coupling constant @xmath30.the latter can be obtained by the sr method .",
    "this brings us to a self - consistent scenario . at the present level of our knowledge",
    "it requires some more phenomenological assumptions @xcite .",
    "note also , that the finite density sr method provided reasonable results for the axial coupling constant @xcite , for the neutron ",
    "proton mass splitting @xcite and for the difference between the deep inelastic structure of nucleus and that of sum of those of free nucleons@xcite .",
    "however , in these calculations only the condensates of the lowest dimensions have been included .",
    "now we give the details .",
    "this approach is described in details in many publications .",
    "earlier papers are reviewed in @xcite .",
    "the nowadays state of art is presented in @xcite and @xcite , see also the book @xcite . however , to make the text self - consistent we recall the main points of the approach .",
    "we emphasize the points , which we shall need for the extension of the sr method for the case of finite density of the baryon quantum number .",
    "the nucleon qcd sum rules succeeded in describing of the nucleon characteristics in vacuum in terms of the vacuum expectation values of the products of quark or ( and ) gluon operators ( qcd condensates ) @xcite .",
    "this approach is based on the dispersion relation for the function @xmath31 describing the propagation of the system which carries the quantum numbers of the proton , @xmath32 is the unit @xmath33 matrix . in the simplest form",
    "the dispersion relations are @xmath34 as we shall see below , we do not need to worry about possible subtractions .    in quantum mechanics",
    "@xmath35 is just the proton propagator . in the field theory",
    "different degrees of freedom are important in different regions of the value of @xmath36",
    ".    one can consider the proton as a system of three strongly interacting quarks .",
    "due to asymptotic freedom of qcd + cite18a the description becomes increasingly simple at @xmath37 .",
    "this means that at @xmath37 the function @xmath35 can be presented as a power series of @xmath38 and of the qcd coupling constant @xmath39 .",
    "the coefficients of the expansion in powers of @xmath38 are the qcd condensates .",
    "such presentation known as the operator product expansion ( ope ) @xcite provides the perturbative expansion of the short distance effects , while the nonperturbative physics is contained in the condensates . in qcd sr approach the left - hand side ( lhs ) of eq.([5 ] ) is considered at @xmath37 , and several lowest order terms of the ope are included . in this and in the next subsections we neglect the radiative corrections ,",
    "i.e. we do not include interactions and self - interactions ( self - energy insertions ) of the quarks , putting @xmath40 .    turning to the right - hand side ( rhs ) of eq .",

    "the structure and the role of the three - body ( many - body ) nuclear interactions is much studied nowadays  see , e.g. @xcite . in the sr approach",
    "such interactions emerge in a natural way .",
    "there are two types of many - body interactions in our approach .",
    "one of them is connected with the four - quark condensate .",
    "another one manifests itself in the baryon - hole excitations , taken into account by the in - medium pion propagator .    in sec .",
    "6 the contribution of four - quark condensates was included in the gas approximation .",
    "our probe nucleon exchanged both pairs of quarks with the same nucleon of the matter . beyond the gas approximation",
    "two quark pairs can be exchanged with different nucleons of the matter .",
    "this corresponds to the three - body interactions .",
    "such terms are shown in fig .  21 .",
    "their contribution , e.g. to the lhs of eq .",
    "( [ 57 ] ) for the @xmath165 structure @xmath784 can be estimated as @xmath785 . at the saturation value of density",
    "this can change the value of @xmath784 by about @xmath786 .",
    "this will lead to relative changes of the same order of the nucleon self - energies . at larger values of density",
    "the role of these terms increases .    as we discussed in sec .  3",
    ", the contributions , involving @xmath787 nucleons of the matter have the branching points in variable @xmath788 . generally speaking ,",
    "this means that we need a more complicated model of the spectrum .",
    "however , we see that in the ope series the three body terms do not contain branching points in @xmath36 . in framework of our model for the higher lying states they contribute only to the pole term on the rhs of the sum rules .",
    "adding gluon interactions with the matter , i.e. including the four - quark - gluon condensates , we obtain the terms , involving larger number of nucleons of the matter , corresponding to many - nucleon forces .",
    "they contribute to the higher order ope terms .",
    "due to the small value of the in - medium gluon condensate we expect such contributions to be small .",
    "another type of many - body interactions manifests itself in the nonlinear contribution to the scalar condensate @xmath24 .",
    "as we saw in subsection  4.5 , it is determined by the pion cloud .",
    "the general form of the contribution is @xmath789 where summation over spin and isospin variables is assumed . here",
    "@xmath790 is the propagator of intermediate baryon in nuclear matter , @xmath791 is the pion propagator , renormalized by the particle - hole excitations of medium .",
    "the vertices of @xmath792 interaction in nuclear matter are denoted as @xmath793 .",
    "integration over momenta of the nucleons of the matter is limited by condition @xmath794 .",
    "upper index @xmath795 denotes the vacuum functions . the second term on the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ 174 ] ) subtracts the terms , which are already included in the physical nucleon . for @xmath796 the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ 174 ] ) turns to that of eq .",
    "( [ 114 ] ) .",
    "the contribution is illustrated by fig .",
    "the pion propagator @xmath791 includes the multi - nucleon effects .",
    "thus , eq .  ( [ 174 ] ) includes the many - body interactions .",
    "however , the rigorous calculation of its rhs is a part of a self - consistent problem .",
    "we have seen that the shape of the density dependence of the quark condensates @xmath293 is very important for the hadronic physics .",
    "it is also important for description of the matter as a whole , since characterizes a degree of restoration of the chiral symmetry with the growing density . on the other hand",
    ", we saw that it determines the main density dependence of the effective mass @xmath797 .",
    "the linear part of the density behavior of @xmath293 is related to observables and can be calculated in a model - independent way . however , the nonlinear contribution , expressed by eq .",
    "( [ 174 ] ) depends on several hadron parameters . if the intermediate baryon in eq .",
    "( [ 174 ] ) is a nucleon , these are the nucleon effective mass @xmath0 and the nucleon pion coupling constant @xmath798 .",
    "the latter can be expressed in terms of the pion decay constant @xmath799 and the nucleon isovector axial coupling @xmath9 via the goldberger ",
    "treiman relation @xcite @xmath800 the density dependence of @xmath17 and @xmath126 can also be obtained in the sr approach .",
    "one should add similar equations for the contribution of delta - isobars to the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ 174 ] ) .",
    "thus we come to self - consistent set of equations which can be solved within the qcd sum rules approach . @xmath801    of course",
    ", the sr approach should be combined with some other ones.we have seen already that the calculation of the four - quark condensate required a quark model for the nucleon . also , the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ 174 ] ) contains the in - medium pion propagator .",
    "it satisfies the dyson equation @xmath802 where the pion polarization operator @xmath803 describing the baryon - hole excitations of the matter .",
    "the operator @xmath803 depends strongly on the hadron correlations at the distances @xmath804 , corresponding to small momenta .",
    "they can be included by employing of the finite fermi system theory ( ffst ) @xcite , @xcite .",
    "thus , in order to obtain the many - body effects it is reasonable to combine the sr approach with the ffst .",
    "we demonstrated that the qcd sum rules provide a consistent formalism for solving various problems of nuclear physics .",
    "we expressed the nucleon parameters in nuclear matter in terms of the in - medium qcd condensates .",
    "in symmetric matter the leading contributions to the vector and scalar self - energies are expressed in terms of vector and scalar condensates .",
    "the vector condensate @xmath292 can be calculated easily . in the gas approximation , corresponding to inclusion only of the two - body interactions , the scalar condensate @xmath293 is related to the observable pion  nucleon sigma - term .",
    "in other words , exchange by the strongly correlated quark systems ( mesons ) is expressed in terms of exchange by the system of weakly interacting quarks with the same quantum numbers .",
    "thus the nucleon self - energies are obtained without employing a controversial conception of interaction of the point - like nucleons .",
    "inclusion of the condensates of the lowest dimension confirmed that the nucleon in nuclear matter can be treated as moving in superposition of strong vector and scalar fields of the order of about 300  mev .",
    "the vector field is positive , while the scalar field is negative , and a strong cancellation takes place .",
    "this result is not altered by inclusion of the four - quark condensates .",
    "thus we can expect the convergence of the series with successive inclusion of the condensates of higher dimension .",
    "note , however , that the calculation of the in - medium four - quark condensates requires employing a quark model of nucleon .",
    "we used the approach for calculation of other nucleon characteristics in nuclear matter .",
    "we calculated the nucleon self - energies in asymmetric nuclear matter and found their dependence on the difference between the densities of the neutrons and protons .",
    "we calculated the in - medium quenching of isovector axial coupling constant .",
    "we found the neutron - proton mass difference , providing at least qualitative explanation of the nolen  schiffer anomaly .",
    "also , we demonstrated that our approach enables to investigate internal structure of the nucleon , providing description of some features of the emc effect .",
    "such problems are unaccessible for nuclear physics .",
    "inclusion of the nonlinear density dependence of the scalar condensate @xmath293 corresponds to taking into account the many - body interactions .",
    "we show that the nonlinear terms in @xmath293 are provided mainly by the pion cloud . a simple inclusion of the contributions beyond the gas approximation signals on a possible saturation mechanism , which is due to the many - body effects .",
    "thus it differs from that in the walecka model .",
    "a more rigorous treatment of the nonlinear contributions to @xmath293 requires solution of the self - consistent problem , in which the coupling constants @xmath805 and @xmath806 as well as the effective mass of the @xmath54 isobar should be also determined as functions of @xmath435 , while @xmath435 should be expressed in terms of these parameters . this would provide the dependence of @xmath807 .",
    "this is an important parameter of the matter itself , since it shows the degree of restoration of the chiral symmetry .",
    "this analysis requires employing of the pion propagator , which is renormalized by the particle - hole excitations of the matter .",
    "these excitations can be included by using the finite fermi system theory , formulated and developed by a.  b.  migdal and his colleagues several decades ago .",
    "the work on the project is in progress .",
