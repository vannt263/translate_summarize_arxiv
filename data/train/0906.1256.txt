    "the classical isoperimetric problem in euclidean space @xmath1 looks for `` least perimeter '' sets among those ones with prescribed volume . a first solution of this problem was provided in 1935 by lusternik , by proving , using symmetrisation techniques , that balls minimise minkowski content ( see also burago - zalgaller ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapters 8 and 10 ) ) ; the complete solution was given by de giorgi @xcite , with the proof that balls are minimisers in the class of finite perimeter sets .",
    "the isoperimetric problem has been extended to riemannian manifolds and , more recently , to the so - called _ manifolds with density_.    a manifold with density ( see also ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 18 ) ) is a manifold @xmath2 endowed with a positive function @xmath3 used to weight both perimeter and volume .",
    "more precisely , given a regular set @xmath4 , we define the ( weighted ) volume and perimeter of @xmath5 to be @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are volume and surface elements on @xmath2 ( see also section [ preliminaries ] for precise definitions ) .",
    "note that such a density is not equivalent to scaling the metric of @xmath2 conformally by some factor @xmath9 , since in that case perimeter and volume would scale by different powers of @xmath9 .",
    "one of the first and most important examples of manifolds with density , with applications to probability and statistics , is gauss space @xmath1 with density @xmath10 .",
    "isoperimetric sets are half - spaces ( @xcite ; see also ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 18 ) or ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 3 ) ) .",
    "more recently other authors ( e.g. @xcite ) have considered different examples of manifolds with density and generalised classical techniques : steiner and schwarz symmetrisations @xcite , functional versions of the isoperimetric inequality @xcite , first and second variation formulae , mean curvature , ricci curvature , and so on .",
    "we refer the reader also to @xcite and references therein .    in this paper we will consider two kinds of densities on the plane @xmath0 : continuous modifications of the gaussian density and piecewise constant densities , apparently the first examples of discontinuous ones .",
    "these questions arose in the lectures on `` manifolds with density '' by f.  morgan during the meeting `` gmtlap - geometric measure theory and least area problems '' in modena ( italy ) , 15 - 17th february 2007 , organized by g.p .",
    "leonardi , r.  monti , f.  serra  cassano , r.  serapioni and i.  tamanini .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following .",
    "section [ preliminaries ] contains introductory material on manifolds with density , perimeter , existence of isoperimetric sets , and first variation of the perimeter .",
    "we stress proposition [ teofresnel ] , which provides a snell refraction law for isoperimetric boundaries for discontinuous , piecewise constant densities .",
    "we comment on minimal surfaces in manifolds with density and introduce calibrations , which provide sufficient conditions for minimality .    in section [ secpcdens ]",
    "we investigate the isoperimetric problem in some cases of piecewise constant densities .",
    "the first one is the half - space density , i.e. , the density on @xmath1 taking values 1 on the half - space @xmath11 and @xmath12 on @xmath13 , where @xmath9 is a function depending only on the last coordinate @xmath14 ; in this case , the isoperimetric sets are provided by round balls in the half - space @xmath15 ( theorem  [ serapioni ] ) .",
    "the second one is the `` strip '' density on @xmath1 taking values 1 if @xmath16 and a constant @xmath12 otherwise ; we show that isoperimetric sets exist and are connected for any given volume in the planar case , with some additional properties in general dimension .",
    "a further analysis leads us to conjecture  [ conj : strip ] , where we list the possible solutions in the planar setting .",
    "this conjecture is almost completely proved in theorem  [ teostrip ] .",
    "the last density we consider is the `` ball '' density on @xmath0 with values @xmath17 outside the ball @xmath18 and constant @xmath19 inside : here isoperimetric sets exist for any given volume , are connected , and can assume several profiles , both in the case @xmath12 ( see theorem  [ ballmagg ] ) and the case @xmath20 ( see theorem [ conj : ballmino1 ] ) .",
    "section [ seccontdens ] concerns with modifications of gauss density on @xmath0 .",
    "a question risen during the gmtlap meeting concerned the density @xmath21 on the half - plane @xmath22 .",
    "we recently discovered that a paper of brock et al .",
    "@xcite gives a complete answer to this problem , showing that sets bounded by vertical lines are isoperimetric .",
    "we point out that , from that result , the same holds true also for the whole plane . during the gmtlap meeting",
    "also the isoperimetric problem in the plane with density @xmath23 was risen : we conjecture that here the isoperimetric boundary is provided by vertical or horizontal lines . for certain volume bounds ( those close to half of the total volume ) horizontal lines are better than vertical ones , while for other bounds vertical lines beat horizontal ones ( see proposition  [ propconj1 ] ) .",
