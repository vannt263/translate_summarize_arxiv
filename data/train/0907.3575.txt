    "the assumption is that the line luminosity represents the same fraction of   in all agn .",
    "a line that is commonly used is  and the scaling of its luminosity to  is obtained from observations of type - i sources , where both the line and the non - stellar continuum are directly observed .",

    "two different possibilities ought to be considered .",
    "the first is a `` standard '' sed that represents high ionization agn and assumed to retain its shape in phases of low and high accretion rates .",
    "given the unobserved far - uv continuum , the range of possible shapes is large and various components must be considered .",
    "these can be described by : 1 .",
    "the shape of the 0.11@xmath14 m continuum .",
    "2 . the bolometric correction factor , bc , which specifies the ratio of the total luminosity to the optical continuum luminosity .",
    "the bc is not directly observed and its value is estimated from analysis of various emission lines .",
    "3 . the normalization of the optical and x - ray fluxes , e.g. the value of @xmath15 .",
    "the shape of the x - ray continuum .",
    "experimenting with a range of possible continuum shapes shows that the two that are shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : sed ] bracket most realistic seds .",
    "the first of these ( sed-1 ) is a combination of a disc - like optical - uv continuum , combined with a @xmath16 x - ray ( @xmath17 kev ) powerlaw .",
    "in this case , bc , which is defined here as / , where  is @xmath18 at 5100 , is 7 and @xmath19 .",
    "such seds are typical of high luminosity agn . the second case ( sed-2 )",

    ", width=317 ]    the second possibility is that different phases of activity are associated with different seds .",
    "for example , a luminous , fast accreting phase may be associated with an sed similar to one of the continua shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : sed ] while a less luminous , slower accreting rate phase , might show a different sed .",
    "this may be the result of a change in the spectral properties of the central accretion disc , in particular a significant reduction in the `` blue bump '' flux . such a possibility is illustrated by the various curves shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : sed ] .",
    "the top sed , marked v1 , represents the high accretion rate phase .",
    "it is similar to sed-1 except that a relatively stronger x - ray continuum , typical of low luminosity agn , has been used . in this case",
    "bc=12.4 and @xmath24 .",
    "the additional curves , marked v2v5 , represent several possibilities where the accretion disc continuum is significantly reduced .",
    "such spectra have been speculated for liners and the ones shown here were motivated by the recent work of maoz ( 2007 ) . according to maoz ( 2007 ) ,",
    "there is a strong uv ( 2500 ) point - source continuum in several nearby liners . in those cases , @xmath25 , very similar to the values observed in seyfert 1 galaxies .",
    "it thus seems that either there are no significant changes in the near uv - sed between low and high accretion rate phases , or else such changes only affect the part of the continuum between @xmath26  and @xmath13 kev ) .",
    "the various curves in the diagram illustrate several such possibilities .",
    "the seds are truncated at energies from 0.5 rydberg , just beyond the 2500  measured point , to 1.81 rydberg , the hei ionization edge .",
    "the transitions from sed - v1 to any of the other seds mimic several possible changes that are consistent with both the maoz ( 2007 ) observations and the assumption of a reduced disc emission .",
    "the constant density models considered here assume column density of 10@xmath27 , enough to make the cloud optically thick to the ionizing continuum radiation , and hydrogen number density of @xmath28 , low enough to avoid strong collisional de - excitation of the  line .",

    "2008 ; ho et al .",
    "i calculated various line ratios , for all seds , over a large range of the hydrogen ionization parameter , @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the cloud central source distance and @xmath31 the rate of emission of lyman continuum photons .",
    "this was done for two generic types of models , one with ism - type depletion and one for dust - free gas .",
    "the gas composition was changed between one and four times solar and the depletion fraction is assumed to be independent of abundance .",
    "the models shown here are all for dusty clouds which are thought to be more appropriate for nlr conditions .",
    "i have included several models similar to the cases discussed in groves et al .",
    "( 2004 ; 2006b ) where radiation pressure force operating mostly on grains , determines the internal pressure in the cloud . experimenting with the various parameters confirms that @xmath32 , the dust content and the sed shape are the most important parameters that determine the interesting line ratios .",

    "bol  is basically constant ( less than 0.3 dex ) over the same range which reflects the constant fraction of the lyman continuum photons absorbed by the optically thick gas .",
    "such results are well known and well documented in numerous publications . in dust - free large @xmath32 models ( not shown here ) , _ bol  and _ bol  are larger by about a factor two compared with the dusty models shown here .",

    "[ fig : calculated_oiii_hb ] such that _ bol  drops much more ( factors of 1020 ) compared with the drop in _ bol  and _ bol ( factors 1.52 ) .",
    "the reason is that the difference in ionization potential between hydrogen and @xmath38 is small and changes in the flux of the @xmath38 ionizing photons are associated with similar changes in the number of lyman continuum photons .",
    "most of the reduction in  is due to changes in @xmath32 and can not be explained by changes in continuum shape , at least not for the seds considered here .    to summarize ,",

    "this requires the removal of blue galaxies from the sample and is explained in  3.1 . for the comparison with type - i agn , i retain the entire sample since no separation of blue and red galaxies has been applied to the type - i sdss sample used here .",
    "the line fluxes for the type - ii sources were re - extracted from the raw data in the archive and reddening corrected fluxes were obtained in two ways , using the observed  line ratios .",
    "the first assumes standard galactic reddening curve combined with the assumption that the intrinsic ratio is = 2.86 .",
    "this value is somewhat smaller than the one expected for s2s ( 33.1 ) but is a very good approximation for l2s .",
    "the second is aimed to duplicate the values used in k03 , b04 and in groves et al .",
    "( 2006a , 2006b )",

    "fortunately , a consistent use of the two reddening laws ( see  2.2.2 ) results in only a small difference in the deduced .",
    "two additional complications related to reddening must be considered .",
    "first , the emission line reddening in type - ii agn is thought to be larger than in type - i agn .",
    "this has been discussed in various papers , e.g. netzer et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , and melendez et al .",
    "any reddening correction based on average values obtained from type - i samples must include this effect .",
    "second , the average /  in previous optically selected and x - ray selected samples ( e.g. the bassani et al 1999 sample ) is larger than the one measured here .",
    "this is possibly explained by k03 who noted the large range in /  and the tendency to detect the highest values in galaxies containing more sf gas ( e.g. smaller 4000  systems ) .",
    "several of the pre - sdss selected samples might preferentially pick galaxies of this type .",
    "the present work uses reddening corrected values based on the mean observed ew ( ) in type - i sdss sources .",
    "it is therefore appropriate to use the mean value of /  in the sdss s2 sub - sample in order to choose the correct scaling between type - i and type - ii sources .",
    "the total number of l2s and s2s in the sample considered here is about 85,000 and the maximum redshift is about 0.25 .",
    "the main purpose is to obtain the most reliable  by using various emission lines .",
    "therefore , most of the results pertain to sources with s / n@xmath52 in the , , ,   and  lines .",
    "this reduces the sample size to about 42,000 . out of these",
    ", about 10,000 are classified as blue galaxies (  3.1 ) and are removed from part of the analysis , as described below .",

    "there are 11,803 such sources and they are referred to here as the `` ke06 sample '' .",
    "the s2 sub - group contains 6641 sources and the l2 group 5162 sources . obviously , the ratio of the populations depends on the assumed s / n since l2s have , on the average , weaker emission lines .",
    "for example , assuming s / n=1 in the ka03 sample , i get n(l2)/n(s2)=2.5 .",
    "the samples were selected by their reddening corrected line ratios .",

    "bh mass estimates for most of these sources can be obtained from @xmath5 measurements listed in the literature .",
    "the archive used for this purpose is leda ( paturel et al . 2003 )      every narrow emission line is a potential  indicator .",
    "however , lines like  are very sensitive to the gas composition ( e.g. groves et al .",

    "[ fig : calculated_oiii_hb ] and table  [ tab : line_bol ] ) . the normalization of _ bol  can be obtained from type - i observations where the optical agn continuum is directly observed .",
    "a major source of uncertainty is the difficult deblending of the relatively weak narrow component from the strong , broad  line .",
