    "it is now well established that x - ray emission is a common feature of kiloparsec - scale radio jets ( see * ? ? ? * for a recent review and the associated website , http://hea-www.harvard.edu/xjet/ ) .",
    "the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of the powerful quasar jets are predominantly characterized as `` optically faint '' , with the spectra rising between the optical and x - ray bands .",
    "current models for this ` excess ' x - ray emission posit either inverse compton ( ic ) scattering off cmb photons in a ( still ) relativistic kpc - scale jet or an additional high - energy synchrotron emitting component .    in the simplest scenario , such models have diverging predictions at high redshift .",
    "specifically , we expect a strong redshift dependence in the monochromatic flux ratio , @xmath3 for ic / cmb , whereas in synchrotron models , we expect no such dependence , @xmath4 . as a first order test of this simple idea ,",
    "our approach is to study the highest - redshift relativistic jets",
    ". such jets probe the physics of the earliest ( first @xmath01 gyr of the universe in the quasars studied ) actively accreting supermassive black hole systems and are interesting for other reasons .",
    "for instance , the ambient medium in these high - redshift galaxies is probably different ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) and this may manifest in jets with different morphologies , increased dissipation , and slower than their lower - redshift counterparts .",
    "most @xmath2 studies of quasar jets have so far targeted known arcsecond - scale radio jets ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as most known examples are at @xmath5 @xmath62 @xcite .",
    "there are currently only two high-@xmath5 quasars with well - established kpc - scale x - ray jet detections : gb  1508 + 5714 at @xmath5=4.3 @xcite and 1745 + 624 at @xmath5=3.9 @xcite .",
    "they are observed to have large @xmath7 values as expected in the ic / cmb model @xcite , although the small number of high-@xmath5 detections preclude any definitive statements @xcite .",
    "we have therefore carried out a vla survey in search of new radio jets in a sample of high-@xmath5 quasars (   [ sec - vla ] ) and new @xmath2 observations of a small subset (   [ sec - cxo ] ) .",
    "this contribution presents some results from these observations . for the redshifts",
    "considered , @xmath5=3.4 to 4.7 , 1@xmath8 corresponds to 7.4 to 6.5 kpc ( @xmath9 km  s@xmath10  mpc@xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 ) .",
    "using ned , we assembled a sample of z@xmath13.4 flat - spectrum radio quasars for imaging with the vla .",
    "we did not aim for our sample to be a complete one as current samples of lower - z x - ray jets are inhomogenous also . with archival @xcite and new vla observations , we find that radio jets in this redshift range are common with a @xmath050@xmath13 detection rate ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and in preparation ) .",
    "examples of new radio jets detected from our observations are shown in figure  [ fig-1 ] .",
    "a small percentage of the radio jets from our radio study (   [ sec - vla ] ) are extended enough ( @xmath12.5  long ) to study with @xmath2 .",
    "we observed four of them with short snapshot @xmath2 observations ( figure  [ fig-2 ] ) .",
    "we detected bright x - ray counterparts to the jets in the quasars j14210643 ( @xmath5=3.689 ; * ? ? ? * ) and gb  1428 + 4217 ( @xmath5=4.72 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; the latter detection is currently the highest - redshift kpc - scale radio and x - ray jet known .",
    "we did not detect the x - ray counterparts to the radio jets in 1239 + 376 ( z=3.819 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and j1754 + 6737 ( @xmath5=3.6 ; * ? ? ?",
    "the 2/4 x - ray jet detection rate of our high-@xmath5 sample is comparable to that of lower-@xmath5 samples @xcite .",
    "previous @xmath2 imaging studies of a number of z@xmath14 radio loud quasars do not reveal significant extended x - ray emission @xcite .",
    "however , in these studies , there were no pre - existing information on possible radio structures in the target objects and any definitive statements regarding the nature of the x - ray emission mechanism in jets at high - redshifts may be premature .",
    "in fact , in one case where there was evidence of an extended x - ray structure ( j22192719 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , our vla observation revealed a radio counterpart ( figure  [ fig-1 ] ) .    in our approach",
    ", we began with a vla survey of a sample of z@xmath13.4 quasars and found radio jets to be relatively common ( @xmath050@xmath13 detection rate ) .",
    "these jets are quite luminous ; with a confident detection of a 1 mjy knot at 1.4 ghz , this corresponds to luminosities of 1.5 @xmath1410@xmath15 erg s@xmath10 ( @xmath5=3.4 ) to 3.1 @xmath1410@xmath15 erg s@xmath10 ( @xmath5=4.7 ) .    with the radio survey results",
    ", we found only a few radio jets to have sufficient angular extent to be imaged with @xmath2 .",
    "the detection rate of x - ray counterparts of the high - z radio jets ( 2/4 ) is similar to that of lower - z radio jet samples @xcite .",
