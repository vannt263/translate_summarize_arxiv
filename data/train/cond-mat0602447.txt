    "<S> we discuss the four - fold anisotropy of in - plane ferromagnetic resonance ( fmr ) field @xmath0 , found in a square lattice of circular permalloy dots when the interdot distance @xmath1 gets comparable to the dot diameter @xmath2 . the minimum @xmath0 , along the lattice @xmath3 axes , and the maximum , along the @xmath4 axes , differ by @xmath5 50 oe at @xmath6 = 1.1 . </S>",
    "<S> this anisotropy , not expected in uniformly magnetized dots , is explained by a non - uniform magnetization @xmath7 in a dot in response to dipolar forces in the patterned magnetic structure . </S>",
    "<S> it is well described by an iterative solution of a continuous variational procedure .    </S>",
    "<S>    </S>",
    "<S>     # 1([#1 ] )    magnetic nanostructures are of increasing interest for technological applications , such as patterned recording media @xcite , or magnetic random access memories @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one of the most important issues for understanding their collective behavior is the effect of long - range dipolar interactions between the dots @xcite . for the single - domain magnetic state of a dot </S>",
    "<S> , the simplest approximation is that dots are uniformly magnetized and interactions only define relative orientation of their magnetic moments @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> if so , the system of dipolar coupled dots in a square lattice should be magnetically isotropic .    </S>",
    "<S> however , in all known experimental studies of closely packed arrays of circular dots , a four - fold anisotropy ( ffa ) was found , either by brillouin light scattering @xcite , ferromagnetic resonance ( fmr ) @xcite or magnetization measurements ( from hysteresis loops ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is important to note that ffa exists in both unsaturated samples and saturated ones ( i.e. above vortex annihilation point on the hysteresis loop ) . </S>",
    "<S> hence it can not be only associated with vortex formation suggested in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it was instead qualitatively related to stray fields from unsaturated parts of magnetization inside the dots @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however no quantitative description of ffa in such systems was given up to now . </S>",
    "<S> so the aim of this study is to explain quantitatively the deviations from isotropy in terms of modified demagnetizing effect in a patterned planar system at decreasing inter - dot distance , from the limit of isolated dot to that of continuous film . the choice of _ x_-band fmr techniques for this study has an advantage in eliminating possible interference from domain ( vortex ) structure @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the variational theoretical analysis is followed by micromagnetic simulations .    </S>",
    "<S> permalloy ( py ) dots were fabricated with electron beam lithography and lift - off techniques , as explained elsewhere @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the dots of thickness @xmath8 = 50 nm and diameter @xmath2 = 1 @xmath9 m were arranged into square arrays with the lattice parameter @xmath1 ( center to center distance ) varying from 1.1 @xmath9 m to 2.5 @xmath9 m . </S>",
    "<S> the dimensions were confirmed by atomic force microscopy and scanning electron microscopy . </S>",
    "<S> room temperature fmr studies were performed at 9.8 ghz using a standard _ </S>",
    "<S> x_-band spectrometer . </S>",
    "<S> the dependence of the fmr field @xmath0 on the azimuthal angle @xmath10 of applied field @xmath11 with respect to the lattice [ 10 ] axis for almost uncoupled dots ( @xmath1 = 2.5 @xmath9 m ) is shown in fig . </S>",

    "<S> only a weak uniaxial anisotropy of @xmath12 is present here , which can be fitted by the simple formula @xmath13 . for the @xmath1 = 2.5 @xmath9 m sample </S>",
    "<S> , we found the average peak position @xmath14 koe and the uniaxial anisotropy field @xmath15 oe . </S>",

    "<S> b ) at @xmath17 m , the best fit ( solid line ) is a superposition of ffa and uniaxial anisotropy ( separately shown by dashed line ) . ]    with decreasing distance @xmath1 between dots , two changes are observed in the @xmath12 dependence . </S>",
    "<S> first , @xmath18 decreases to @xmath19 koe at @xmath1 = 1.1 @xmath9 m ( fig . [ fig1]b ) . </S>",
    "<S> second , a four - fold anisotropy ( ffa ) is detected in the samples with @xmath201.5 @xmath9 m by pronounced minima of @xmath21 at @xmath10 close to the lattice @xmath3 axes . </S>",

    "<S> b ) the same data plotted against @xmath24 for @xmath18 and @xmath25 for @xmath23 give excellent linear fits ( dashed lines ) . ]    the ffa effect , which could not arise in uniformly in - plane magnetized cylindrical dots , is evidently related to a non - uniform distribution of the magnetization @xmath26 ( in cylindric coordinates @xmath27 ) . </S>",
    "<S> a similar effect was discovered using brillouin light scattering @xcite and magnetization reversal @xcite in such systems under weak enough external fields , which displace vortices in each dot . </S>",
    "<S> this can be modeled by displacements of two oppositely in - plane magnetized uniform domains @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> but in the presence of external fields strong enough to observe fmr , one has to assume a continuous ( and mostly slight ) deformation of @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> the simplest model for such deformation uses a variational procedure with respect to a single parameter @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , as will be shown below , the non - uniform magnetic ground state of this coupled periodic system results from a rather complicate interplay between intra - dot and inter - dot dipolar forces , which requires a more general variational procedure .    </S>",
    "<S> assuming fully planar and @xmath29-independent dot magnetization with the 2d fourier amplitudes @xmath30 , the total ( zeeman plus dipolar ) magnetic energy ( per unit thickness of a dot ) can be written as ( see appendix )    e = - _ 0 + _ 0 |_|^2 ,    where @xmath31 @xcite and the vectors of the 2d reciprocal lattice are @xmath10-dependent : @xmath32 ( for @xmath33 and integer @xmath34 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the variation of exchange energy at deformations on the scale of whole sample is of the order of stiffness constant ( @xmath35 for py ) and it can be neglected beside the variation @xmath36 of terms included in eq . </S>",
    "<S> [ eq1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> if the dot magnetization has constant absolute value : @xmath37 , its variation : @xmath38 ( where @xmath39 is unit vector normal to plane ) , is only due to the angle variation @xmath40 . using the fourier transform @xmath41 in the condition @xmath42 leads to the equilibrium equation for the fourier amplitudes :    m_,y & = & _ ^0 ( _ ^ ^ ) + & & ( _ - ^ ^ ) .    </S>",

    "<S> [ fig2]a ) .    finally , by calculating the true local fmr fields @xmath79 from eqs . </S>",
    "<S> [ eq6 ] and [ eq7 ] , the field dependent absorption is obtained as @xmath80 . </S>",
    "<S> then the fmr fields , @xmath0 defined from maximum of @xmath81 in two geometries , display ffa in a good agreement with the experimental data ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this effect is due to the fact that stronger deformation of magnetization stronger suppresses the demagnetizing effect ( the differences @xmath82 ) and thus enhances @xmath0 . </S>",

    "<S> , it is shown that under in - plane magnetic fields , @xmath11 , even strong enough for fmr , the dipolar coupling in a dense lattice of circular magnetic dots is able to produce a continuous deformation of the dot magnetization , strongest for the field orientation along lattice axes .    </S>",
