    "recently , a chinese group has raised the proposal of constructing a high luminosity @xmath0 collider in china , the so - called super @xmath3-factory @xcite , which is similar to the gigaz program suggested by the internal linear collider collaboration @xcite but with a even higher luminosity . as for this",
    "newly purposed super @xmath3-factory , a @xmath0 collider shall run at the energies around the mass of @xmath1-boson resonance and with a high luminosity up to @xmath2 .",
    "many interesting topics can be studied in this super @xmath3-factory : the properties of @xmath1-boson and the precision tests of the electro - weak sector of the standard model , the properties of the heavy mesons or baryons , @xmath22 physics , the physics beyond the standard model and etc .",
    "the @xmath16 meson has aroused people s great interests since its discovery by cdf collaboration @xcite .",
    "the @xmath16 meson is a doubly heavy quark - antiquark bound state and carries flavors explicitly .",
    "systematic studies of its production properties at the hadronic colliders tevatron and lhc have been done in the literature , e.g. refs.@xcite . in particular , a computer program bcvegpy for the hadronic production of the @xmath16 meson has been completed and developed in refs.@xcite , which can be conveniently implemented into pythia @xcite for simulating @xmath16 events . very recently , a first observation of the decay channel @xmath23 with the help of bcvegpy by lhcb group has been finished @xcite . at the hadronic colliders ,",
    "there is much pollution from the hadronic background and many produced @xmath16 events shall be cut off by the trigging condition @xcite .",
    "so , some alternative measurements would be helpful for a comprehensive study .",
    "comparing to the hadronic colliders as the tevatron and lhc , a @xmath24 collider has three general features as cleanliness , democracy and holism @xcite , which are helpful and have some advantages to perform more precise measurements for certain processes . to seek the @xmath16 events at a @xmath0 collider",
    "has already been tried by the lep - i experiment , however no @xmath16 events have been found there .",
    "if the luminosity of a @xmath24 collider is raised up to @xmath25 and its colliding energy is confined to be around the @xmath1-peak , it will raise the production rate up to several orders .",
    "this is reasonable , since as estimated in ref.@xcite , more than @xmath26 @xmath1-boson resonance can be produced for gigaz with @xmath27 .",
    "moreover , refs.@xcite have shown that sizable @xmath16 events can be produce through the @xmath1-boson decays . then , as a rough combination , one can estimate that such a super @xmath3-factory will open new opportunities for studying the @xmath16-meson properties . and to be useful reference , it is interesting to present a more sound estimation .    under the non - relativistic qcd ( nrqcd )",
    "framework @xcite , a doubly heavy meson is considered as an expansion of fock states , and the probability of finding each fock state in the expansion is proportional to a definite power of @xmath28 , where @xmath28 is the relative velocity and @xmath29 is around @xmath30 for heavy quarkonium .",
    "we have studied the production of @xmath31- and @xmath32- quarkonium with a photon or via initial state radiation at the @xmath1-peak in the super @xmath3-factory @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to see whether there has enough @xmath16 events produced at such a high luminosity @xmath0 collider , which can be produced through the process @xmath33+b+\\bar{c}$ ] , where @xmath6 $ ] stands for the @xmath4-quarkonium fock states .",
    "excited @xmath4-quarkonium states , such as the color - singlet @xmath21-wave states and the color - octet @xmath34-wave states , may directly or indirectly decay to the ground state with almost 100% possibility via electromagnetic or hadronic interactions . then",
    ", as a full estimation of the @xmath16-meson production , we shall discuss the following @xmath4-quarkonium states simultaneously ; i.e. @xmath7\\rangle$ ] , @xmath8g\\rangle$ ] , @xmath9\\rangle$ ] , @xmath10g\\rangle$ ] , @xmath11\\rangle$ ] and @xmath12\\rangle$ ] ( with @xmath13 ) . here",
    "the thickened subscript of @xmath4-quarkonium denotes the color index , * 1 * for color - singlet and * 8 * for color - octet ; the relevant angular momentum quantum numbers are shown in the parentheses accordingly .    because of the emergence of massive - fermion lines , the analytical expression for the squared amplitude becomes too complex and lengthy for more ( massive ) particles in the final states and for more higher - order fock states to be generated .",
    "for example , to derive the amplitudes for the @xmath21-wave states , one also needs to get the derivative of the amplitudes over the relative momentum of the constitute quarks .",
    "it has been found that to do the numerical calculation using the conventional squared - amplitude technology becomes time - consuming for these complex processes , since the cross - terms increases with the increment of feynman diagrams , @xmath35 , where @xmath36 stands for the number of feynman diagrams for the process .",
    "one important way to solve this is to deal with the process directly at the amplitude level . for the purpose ,",
    "the  improved trace technology \" is suggested and developed in the literature @xcite . after generating proper phase - space points ,",
    "one first calculate the numerical value for the amplitudes , and then sum these values algebraically and square it to get the squared amplitude , @xmath37 ; through such way , numerical simulation efficiency can be greatly improved in comparison to the usual squared amplitude technology .",
    "events through pythia by @xmath24 annihilation . however , in pythia all kinds of @xmath38-hadron ( @xmath39 , @xmath16 , @xmath40 and etc . )",
    "events will be produced according to the proper fragmentation possibilities , among which the fragmentation possibility for the doubly heavy @xmath16 meson is quite small @xcite , thus using pythia to generate @xmath16 events is not ` economical ' ; i.e. , when simulating the @xmath16 events , too much time will be wasted by generating enormous unwanted @xmath38-hadron events .",
    "] moreover , under the approach , many simplifications can be done at the amplitude level due to the fermion - line symmetries and the specific properties of each heavy - quarkonium fock states , then , we can even written down the analytic expressions for the amplitude .",
    "the  improved trace technology \" has been adopted to derive a simplified and compact analytical expressions for the on - shell @xmath1-boson decay process , @xmath41+b+\\bar{c}$ ] @xcite . at the present",

    "it is noted that under suitable transformations , this approach is also useful for deriving the polarized cross - sections , which is helpful for a polarized @xmath0 collider .    as an explanation for the  improved trace technology \" ,",
    "we first arrange the amplitude @xmath76 into four orthogonal sub - amplitudes @xmath78 according to the spins of the outgoing quark @xmath79 with spin @xmath56 and antiquark @xmath80 with spin @xmath81 , then transform these sub - amplitudes into a trace form by properly dealing with the massive spinors with the help of an arbitrary light - like momentum @xmath82 and an arbitrary space - like momentum @xmath83 , which satisfies @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "the final results are independent of @xmath82 and @xmath83 , which provides a way to check the rightness of the derived results . and one can choose them to be those that will maximumly simply the amplitude .",
