    "searches on electromagnetic properties of neutrinos have became one of the important issue in particle physics , astrophysics and cosmology after observation of neutrino oscillations gives evidence that the neutrino mass is non - zero @xcite .",
    "moreover , this searching may play a key role to understanding the physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) and contributes to studies in astrophysics and cosmology .",
    "although , the coupling of neutrino - photon ( @xmath6 ) and neutrino two - photon ( @xmath7 ) interactions by evaluating radiative diagrams in the simplest extension of sm with massive neutrinos are very small , there are several models beyond sm , predicting relatively large coupling . thus , one of the best method to research electromagnetic properties of neutrinos is a model - independent way .",
    "anomalous properties of neutrinos will already be well known from the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) data before a tev scale linear collider runs , since the lhc can produce very massive new particles and will extend the possibilities of testing for new physics effects .",
    "nevertheless , the lhc may not provide precision measurements as a result of the typical characteristic of hadron machine .",
    "whereas , a linear collider with energies on the tev scale , extremely high luminosity and clean experimental environment , can provide complementary information for these properties with performing precision measurements that would complete the lhc results . a most popular proposed linear colliders with energies on the tev scale ( @xmath8 3 tev ) and extremely high luminosity ( @xmath9 @xmath10s@xmath11 ) is compact linear collider ( clic ) @xcite .",
    "clic generates an accelerating gradient of 150 mvm@xmath11 with the resulting 20 km of active length .",
    "clic uses two beam accelerator technology operating at 30 ghz radio frequency to reach this high accelerating gradient .",
    "in addition to @xmath12 , linear colliders provide a suitable platform to study @xmath4 and @xmath13 interactions at energies and luminosities comparable to those @xmath12 collisions through the laser backscattering procedure @xcite .",
    "the most sensitive experimental bounds on neutrino magnetic moment are obtained from neutrino - electron scattering experiment with reactor neutrinos @xcite and solar neutrinos @xcite , where these limits are about order of @xmath14 .",
    "another bounds on magnetic moment of neutrinos derived from energy loss of astrophysical objects give about an order of magnitude more restrictive constraint than reactor and solar neutrino probes @xcite .",
    "although , @xmath0 coupling attract too much attention , @xmath1 coupling has been much less studied in literature .",
    "current experimental bound on @xmath1 coupling was obtained from the lep data via @xmath15 decay as follows @xcite : @xmath16 ^ 6 \\sum_{i , j , k}\\left(|\\alpha^{ij}_{rk}|^2+|\\alpha^{ij}_{lk}|^2\\right)\\leq2.85\\times10^{-9}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the analysis of primakoff effect on @xmath17 conversion in the external coulomb field of the nucleus @xmath18 yields about two orders of magnitude more restrictive bound than @xmath19 decay . in refs .",
    "@xcite , the potential of @xmath20 and @xmath4 collisions at the lhc was studied to probe neutrino - photon and neutrino - two photon coupling . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was shown that the reaction @xmath21 provides more than eight orders of magnitude improvement in @xmath1 couplings compared to lep limits .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to report on the possibility of obtaining indirect bounds on electromagnetic properties of neutrinos from anomalous @xmath0 and @xmath1 couplings via @xmath22 and @xmath5 processes at the clic .",
    "the magnetic moment couple neutrinos to photon through the dimension-6 effective lagrangian term @xcite @xmath23 where , @xmath24 is the electromagnetic field tensor , @xmath25 are the flavor indices , @xmath26 is the magnetic moment of @xmath27 and @xmath28 @xmath29 is the transition magnetic moment .",
    "the new physics energy scale @xmath30 is embedded in the definition of @xmath28 in the above dimension-6 effective lagrangian .",
    "now we turn to the neutrino - two - photon ( @xmath1 ) vertex which describing from following dimension-7 effective lagrangian @xcite : @xmath31 where @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 are dimensionless coupling constants .",
    "we will focus on dirac neutrino case and obtain model independent bounds on couplings using effective lagrangians ( [ eqn1 ] ) and ( [ eqn2 ] ) .    during calculations in this paper we set @xmath30= 1 gev as a reference value . in order to prevent any misunderstanding",
    ", we should note that this does not means new physics appears at 1 gev which is a quite low value for a new physics energy scale .",
    "we set @xmath30= 1 gev as a reference value which makes our bounds easy to compare with current experimental bounds ( see eq . ( [ leplimit ] ) ) .",
    "bounds at any value for @xmath30 can easily be extracted from our tables by multiplying an appropriate factor .    in this study , we consider @xmath22 and @xmath5 processes for searching non - standard @xmath36 and @xmath1 interactions which denotes lagrangians ( [ eqn1 ] ) and ( [ eqn2 ] ) .",
    "the complete sets of feynman diagrams contributing to @xmath22 at tree level are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] . as seen from fig.[fig1 ] , the first six diagrams((a)-(f ) ) contains nonstandard @xmath36 vertices and the last two diagrams ( ( g ) and ( h ) ) comes from sm electroweak processes .      as shown in fig.[fig2 ] , we have only three feynman diagrams in the presence of the effective interaction ( [ eqn2 ] ) .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows the feynman diagrams of @xmath5 process which consists of only non - standard @xmath36 and @xmath1 interaction vertices .          in this study",
    ", we consider initial state radiation ( isr ) for incoming electron .",
    "isr is a process of photon radiation by the incoming electron due to its interaction with other collision particle .",
    "in addition , we take into account this spectrum in our calculations by using the comphep program with beamstrahlung spectra .",
    "beamstrahlung is a process of energy loss by the incoming electron due to its interaction with the positron ( electron ) bunch moving in the opposite direction .",
    "beamstrahlung spectrum , which depends on the bunch geometry , bunch charge and the collision energy , is an attribute of the linear collider design .",
    "when calculating these effects we take into account the beam parameters of the clic as shown in table  [ tab : table_bs ] .",
    ".the beam parameters of the two energy options of the clic .",
    "n is the number of particles in the electron bunch , @xmath41 are the average sizes of the electron bunches and @xmath42 is the design luminosity .",
