    "nuclear reactions induced by @xmath0 are very important for the study of astrophysical nucleosynthesis , especially for the production of c-12 via the hoyle state , and provide a new possible way to solve the lithium puzzles in nuclear astrophysics .",
    "the production of the element carbon is one of the key reactions in stellar nucleosynthesis . ordinarily , the probability of the triple @xmath8 process is extremely small .",
    "the most abundant isotope , @xmath9 , is created through the formation of the @xmath0 ground state as intermediate state .",
    "however , @xmath0 has a very short lifetime against @xmath8 decay , implying that it should almost always break up rather than become the seed for carbon .",
    "the astrophysicist fred hoyle recognized that the observed abundance requires an accelerating mechanism and he predicted the existence of a excited state in @xmath9 close to the threshold for @xmath10 fusion @xcite .",
    "this resonance greatly increases the probability that an incoming @xmath8 will combine with @xmath0 to form @xmath9 .",
    "the excited state , with @xmath11 , @xmath12 , indeed exists , and is often referred to as the `` hoyle state '' .",
    "but , there is no way to directly study the reaction @xmath13 up to now .    to solve the lithium puzzle in nuclear astrophysics",
    ", there will be a new possible way when taking into account the @xmath0 induced reactions .",
    "the observed @xmath14 abundance in low - metallicity stars is about three orders of magnitude large than that predicted from standard big bang nucleosynthesis .",
    "in addition , @xmath15 observations lie a factor 3 - 4 below the big bang prediction @xcite .",
    "the fusion of two @xmath8 into @xmath0 requires 0.093 mev . while there is a resonance in @xmath16 at about 0.1 mev above the @xmath17 fusion threshold .",
    "so this resonance maybe markedly increase the @xmath14 production by reaction @xmath18 , when the temperatures and densities were suitable in some astrophysical environment . on the other hand , the @xmath19 reaction proceeding maybe have effect for destroying @xmath15 .",
    "although the nuclear reactions induced by @xmath0 are so important , however due to the short life of @xmath0 which is only @xmath20s , it can neither be used as a beam nor as as a target by current technical means .",
    "therefore , up to now , the @xmath0 induced nuclear reactions can not be studied directly .    the trojan - horse method ( thm ) @xcite provides a possible way for indirect research of @xmath0 induced nuclear reactions by using @xmath3 as the trojan horse nucleus , assuming that @xmath3 has a ( @xmath0 + n ) cluster structure @xcite with the orbital angular momentum @xmath2 .",
    "the thm is an indirect approach to determine the energy dependence of @xmath21 factors of astrophysically relevant two - body reactions .",
    "the aim of the thm is to extract the cross - section of an astrophysically relevant two - body reaction @xmath22 from a suitably chosen reaction @xmath23 with three particles in the final state assuming that the trojan - horse @xmath24 is composed predominantly of clusters @xmath25 and @xmath26 . if the @xmath27 system is considered as an excited state of the compound system @xmath28 .",
    "the formulation eq.([eq-23 ] ) is the direct relation of the three - body cross - section to the two - body cross - section for partial wave @xmath29 after selecting the quasi - free events @xcite .",
    "@xmath30 @xmath31 is a kinematical factor containing the final state phase space factor and is a function of the masses , momenta and angles of the outgoing particles .",
    "@xmath32 is the momentum distribution of the spectator @xmath26 inside the trojan - horse nucleus @xmath24 .",
    "the term @xmath33 is the differential two - body cross section induced at energy @xmath34 given in post - collision prescription by @xmath35 .",
    "the variable @xmath36 is the relative energy between the outgoing particles and @xmath37 is the q - value of the vietual two body reaction .",
    "using the eq.([eq-23 ] ) , we can reconstruct the momentum distribution of @xmath32 via thm .    in this paper ,",
    "the thm was applied to the @xmath38 reaction .",
    "the @xmath3 nucleus was assumed as @xmath39 cluster structure and used as the trojan - horse nucleus .",
    "the @xmath0 nucleus acts as a participant , while the neutron is a spectator to the virtual @xmath40 reaction .",
    "the experimental neutron momentum distribution inside the trojan - horse nucleus @xmath3 would be reconstructed .",
    "this can give a test if there is a cluster structure of @xmath41 inside @xmath3 , which is a feasibility study for the further research work of @xmath0 related nuclear reactions .",
    "and it is also worth to mention that this is the first experiment to use a @xmath2 nucleus as trojan - horse nucleus .",
    "a beam of @xmath3 at 22.4 mev was provided by the hi-13 tandem accelerator at china institute of atomic energy .",
    "a strip of deuterated polyethylene target @xmath42 of about @xmath43 in thickness and about 1 mm in width was oriented with its surface perpendicular to the beam direction . using the strip target",
    "limited the horizontal width of the beam spot in 1 mm to decrease the angle error .",
    "a position sensitive detector ( @xmath44 ) was placed at @xmath45 to the beam line direction and about 240 mm from the target . in the other side of the beam line ,",
    "a @xmath46 ( dual position sensitive detector , consisted of @xmath47 in the upside and @xmath48 downside ) was used at @xmath49 and about 250 mm distance from the target .",
    "the trigger for the event acquisition was generated by events having particle multiplicity larger than 1 .",
    "energy and position signals for the detected particles were processed by standard electronics and sent to the acquisition system for online monitoring and data storage for offline analysis .",
    "for the angular calibration , an equally spaced grid was mounted in front of each detector and the angular position of each grid inside the scattering chamber was determined by using an optical system .",
    "the position and energy calibrations were performed by means of a standard @xmath8 source , the @xmath50 and @xmath51 scattering with @xmath14 beam at 15 and 10 mev , and the @xmath52 scattering with @xmath3 beam at 8 and 22.4 mev .",

    "we assume all those particles detected by @xmath44 are @xmath14 , all particles detected by @xmath47 ( in the upside of the @xmath46 ) are @xmath8 , and the third particles calculated with @xmath56 three - body reaction kinematic equations are @xmath57 . in order to understand",
    "the experimental data , a set of simulation system was established for the experimental setup based on geant4 @xcite .",
    "these right events were selected with the help of the simulation system .",
    "the q - value of the @xmath56 reaction was reconstructed by means of the momentum and energy conservation .",
    "the experimental spectrum of the q - value is shown in fig.[fig - q ] , for which a peak centered about -0.1 mev was obtained in agreement with the expected theoretical value .",
    "the majority of events would be considered in the reaction channel of interest when the q - value was selected from -0.9 to 0.7 mev .",
    "the next step is the quasifree mechanism identification of the @xmath58 exit channel .",
    "there is a peak of @xmath59 mev in fig.[fig - li7star ] , which belongs to the 7.45 mev excited states of @xmath60 .",
    "relative energy of @xmath61 spectra .",
    "there is a peak about 0.2 mev belonging to the 7.45 mev excited states of @xmath60.,scaledwidth=46.0% ]    it means that the events mainly came from the sequential mechanism reaction @xmath62 . because @xmath8 came from the two - body reaction @xmath63 , the events appears a curve in the @xmath64 vs @xmath65 relative two - dimensional plots ( see fig.[fig-2dli7star ] ) .",
    "@xmath64 vs @xmath65 relative two - dimensional plots .",
    "the events , which appears a curve and were indicated by an arrow , mainly came from the sequential mechanism reaction @xmath62.,scaledwidth=46.0% ]    so those events , which were around the curve indicated by an arrow in fig.[fig-2dli7star ] , would be eliminated for the quasifree mechanism identification .    in this paper , we expect the trojan - horse nucleus to be @xmath66 .",
    "but , in fact , the neutron can also come from the trojan - horse nucleus @xmath67 .",
    "an intermediate process was assumed exist when those events meet the qusifree condition @xcite .",
    "three criteria for the experimental identification of the qusifree mechanism were introduced @xcite .",
    "two different trojan - horse nucleus situation were respectively applied to these criteria .",
    "the events will be selected when they are agree with the trojan - horse nucleus as @xmath66 , and be eliminated when they are agree with the trojan - horse nucleus as @xmath67 .",
    "comparison between the experimental neutron momentum distribution ( different color solid symbols ) and theoretical one ( grey line ) .",
    "the different color solid symbols come from cutting different range of @xmath68 relative energy and extracting the neutron momentum distribution .",
    "the error bars include only the statistical one.,scaledwidth=46.0% ]",
    "the term @xmath33 in eq.[eq-23 ] represents the nuclear part of the differential cross section for the virtual two - body reaction @xmath69 that in post - collision prescription occurs at an energy @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the @xmath68 relative energy and @xmath72 is the two - body @xmath73 value .    to reconstruct the neutron momentum distribution , a small @xmath68 relative energy window ( about 100 kev ) was selected .",
    "in such a small energy window , @xmath33 can be considered constant . thus the experimental @xmath32 distribution was extracted by dividing the three - body coincidence yield by the kinematic factor .",
    "the results are showed in fig.[fig - be8distribution ] with the different color solid symbols .",
    "in fig.[fig - be8distribution ] , the theoretical neutron momentum distribution was calculated based on assuming @xmath3 nucleus as @xmath74 cluster structure with the orbital angular momentum @xmath2 . to solve the schr@xmath75dinger equation we applied the wood - saxon potential with the standard values for the radius parameter and diffuseness while the potential well depth was fixed using the @xmath76 binding energy .",
    "the orbital angular momentum of neutron was assumed to be unity because @xmath77 for the ground state of @xmath3 .",
    "the agreement between experimental and theoretical momentum distribution indicates the @xmath74 cluster structure of @xmath3 , and represents a very strong check for the existence of the qusifree mechanism in the present data . in advance",
