    "blazars emit their most energies in the @xmath0-ray domain , dominating the extragalactic @xmath0-ray sky ( nolan et al .",

    "significant @xmath0-ray variability is a distinct character for blazars .",

    "these episodes put severe challenge on the classic one - zone homogeneous leptonic blazar radiation models that include synchrotron and inverse compton ( ic ) process ( begelman et al . 2008 ) . in the gev range , there are only two fsrqs , ( mattox et al .",
    "1997 ) and ( wehrle et al . 1998 ) , from which flux variations on several hours have been detected by cgro / egret .",

    "fast @xmath0-ray variability together with the absorption features in @xmath0-ray spectra ( poutanen & stern 2010 ) , suggest that the dissipation region is probably within the broad line region ( blr ) . however , detailed multi - wavelength studies including correlation and lag analyses on outbursts , together with kinematic studies on very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) component ejection , suggest that the dissipation site of jet locates at pc scale ( e.g. marscher et al .",

    ", lat performs a complete and uniform coverage of the sky in 3 hours and 3-hour bin is the smallest bin allowed with the standard software . since the light curves of are extracted during the survey mode operation of lat , due to the limited exposure time , doubling timescales of 2 - 3 hours should be treated as upper limits only . and",
