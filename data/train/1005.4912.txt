    "the spectra of the ceru@xmath0sn@xmath1polycrystals were obtained with the field - sweep method at ( fig .",

    "the @xmath53sn - nmr spectra of ceru@xmath0sn@xmath1  show two distinct maxima which are attributed to the two sn positions @xmath84 . towards lower temperatures ,",
    "the spectra broaden and the two sharp maxima can no longer be easily resolved .",
    "the anisotropic shift of the two sn lines attributed to the spectral overlap of the two inequivalent sn sites imparts an arbitrary element to their simulation which makes a quantitative analysis of these spectra rather tenuous .",
    "therefore , we limit our interpretation to what can be learnt from estimating the nmr shift and the hyperfine field .    the respective frequency- and field - dependent investigation of the nmr spectra , concerning shift and broadening , should give information about the unusual behavior of the susceptibility at low temperatures ( @xmath96 ) .",

    "the uniformity of shape and broadening is seen to be quite precise . when scans taken at are plotted in the same fashion ( fig .",
    "[ fig : spec5k30k ] , bottom panel ) , a striking change is seen to take place .",
    "a progressively larger ( fractional ) broadening occurs as the frequency is lowered , so that at the spectrum is nearly twice as wide as at .",
    "the analysis of the entire series of spectra can be represented by a distribution of shifts broadened by a convolution with a gaussian function having a fixed width parameter of @xmath99 .",
    "broadening fields which are independent of the applied field only occur in cases of `` spin freezing '' , e.g. in a spin glass such as cu : mn @xcite .",

    "[ fig : dosfu ] and the behavior reminds of the @xmath135 kondo imputiy model @xcite . as a matter of fact , we can now use this density of states to calculate all the observables .",
    "the point @xmath136 where @xmath28 crosses the fermi level provides the sommerfeld coefficient @xmath137 at @xmath138 . plotting @xmath136 as a function of @xmath139 indicates how @xmath8 decreases in an exponential fashion with increasing magnetic field ( see inset ( a ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : dosfu ] ) . to compare the values of @xmath140",
    "obtained from nmr measurements and those obtained by fitting the specific - heat data , we plotted both in the same diagram in inset ( b ) of the same figure .",
    "similar values and a comparable field dependency is found among the two approaches . assuming a zeeman energy @xmath141 , the magnetic moment of these states can be estimated from the slope of the dashed line in inset ( b ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : dosfu ] : the fit gives a value close to @xmath142 .    .",
    "the field - derived @xmath13 states density is depicted in inset ( b ) and inset ( a ) plots the field evolution of the inner gap @xmath10 responsible for the low - energy properties .",
    "lines are guides to the eye . ]    to estimate the number of states per formula unit , @xmath28 can be integrated . at zero field and @xmath143 , 0.039 states per formula unit",

    "this value is in good accordance with that obtained from hall - coefficient data , which gave 0.03 carriers per formula unit  @xcite .",
    "additionally , the contribution of these spin states to the magnetization can be calculated at given values of temperature and field .",
    "considering that the states have @xmath144 , the magnetization can be calculated by @xmath145 where @xmath146 and @xmath147        for example , at @xmath148 and @xmath149 , @xmath150 states are obtained , which cause a net magnetization @xmath151/f.u .",
    "the experimental measurements ( fig .  [ fig : magn ] ) give @xmath152/f.u . at the same values of temperature and field",
    "; this means that only 20% of the residual density of states contribute to the complete magnetization , where the van - vleck contribution to @xmath45 has , however , not been taken into account .",

    "[ fig : magcalc ] and is found very similar to the total magnetization in fig  [ fig : magn ] .    the model for the density of states ( eq .  ( [ eq : cl ] ) ) could also be successfully applied to calculate the complete temperature and field dependences of the susceptibility .",
    "this calculation for selected fields is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : magcalc ] .",
    "qualitatively , the steep increase of @xmath44 at low temperatures can be reproduced by such a form of the residual density of states .",
    "below , @xmath44 flattens and its value @xmath39 at @xmath138 decreases with increasing field , scaling with @xmath137 . the predicted trend is largely played out by the experimental results in fig .  [ fig : susc ] .",
    "however , the absolute values differ generally from the experimental ones . it should be noted that additional effects such as an underlying magnetocrystalline anisotropy precludes a quantitative treatment in the present study on polycrystalline samples .",
    "we have presented detailed measurements of the field response of the specific - heat ( @xmath6 ) and of nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) on the intermetallic kondo - insulator compound ceru@xmath0sn@xmath1 .",
    "a survey of earlier results of the electrical resistivity , thermopower , and specific - heat hinted at the possibility that this system might be on the verge of magnetic order , and that magnetic correlations certainly play an influential role in the anomalous ground - state properties . here , strong correlations form out of a low charge carrier density which is a rare occurrence in the highly correlated class of systems .",
    "the aim of this work was to seek a description that would consistently explain the strongly enhanced low - temperature specific heat and magnetic phenomena found in ceru@xmath0sn@xmath1  through nmr measurements .",
    "a v - shaped pseudogap with a broad band of residual states at the fermi energy was first proposed by kyogaku and coworkers @xcite and provides a convenient mechanism for modeling susceptibility , knight shift , and spin - lattice - relaxation rate in non - cubic kondo insulators like cenisn and u@xmath18ru@xmath18sn . for ceru@xmath16sn@xmath17 ,",
    "this model is not valid , and we have assumed a simple , rigid rectangular gap model and have replaced the broad band by a narrow one of ( field dependent ) residual states .",
    "we have applied this density - of - states model with considerable success to the specific - heat and nmr data of ceru@xmath0sn@xmath1  and found the field dependence of these properties to be fully reconcilable in the framework of this model .",
    "the temperature evolution of electronic and thermodynamic properties is driven by two nested energy gaps , @xmath153 and @xmath154 ( at zero field ) , centered on the fermi energy .",
    "the gapping is not complete and a residual number of heavy - mass charge carriers within the smaller of the two gaps achieves a finite electrical conductivity even at the lowest temperatures .",
    "these states are correlated , presumably due to the kondo - screening effect , as inferred from strong temperature dependences of the sommerfeld - coefficient of 4@xmath155 increment to the specific heat and the magnetic susceptibility , both of which are found to saturate at large values as @xmath13 .",
    "the scope of the physics forwarded for ceru@xmath0sn@xmath1  in this work provides a platform from which to test the predicted nodal kondo insulating state as a new type of semimetal that forms under favorable conditions @xcite .",
    "the axial symmetry of nodes of vanishing density of states set the stage for anisotropic electronic conduction .",
    "anisotropic magnetic properties in ceru@xmath0sn@xmath1  single crystals has recently been reported @xcite .",
    "a considerable magnetocrystalline anisotropy is evident between the basal - plane and the tetragonal @xmath86-axis .",
    "in particular , a tiny @xmath86-axis magnetization of @xmath156 at @xmath157 was found in @xmath158 which amounts to no more than about @xmath159 of the moment extracted along the isotropic basal plane directions .",
    "furthermore , our results obtained might reflect the interplay between rkky and kondo interaction in the limit of a very low carrier concentration as discussed by coqblin _",
    "future studies on ceru@xmath0sn@xmath1  would benefit from magnetic susceptibility data at very low temperatures to assess , for instance , the role of magnetic correlations through progression of the sommerfeld - wilson ratio .",
    "electrical resistivity studies on single crystals are highly desirable and high - resolution inelastic - neutron - scattering measurements would conceivably enhance our knowledge about the low - lying spin excitations in the material .",
