    "the far ultraviolet ( fuv ) spectral region is one of the least studied ranges in stellar physics .",

    "the absolute fluxes obtained by these investigations are often highly discrepant for a variety of reasons .    in a previous work ( morales et al .",
    "2000 ) , we reported on fuv spectroscopic observations of the bright star @xmath1 vir ( spica ) obtained with the eurd spectrograph , which provided an absolute flux for this star .",
    "eurd data on @xmath1 vir were reasonably well reproduced by kurucz models ( kurucz 1993 ) fitted to iue data .    in this paper , we present spectra of stars observed by eurd during its first two years of operation .",

    "eurd is one of the instruments onboard the spanish satellite minisat-01 .",
    "it consists of two spectrographs covering the bandpass between 350 and 1100  , with @xmath0 5  spectral resolution .",
    "minisat-01 was launched on april 21 , 1997 .",
    "its orbit is retrograde with an inclination of 151@xmath11 and an altitude of 517 km .",
    "the design of the spectrographs and their ground calibrations are described in detail in bowyer , edelstein , & lampton ( 1997 ) .",
    "eurd samples the entire ecliptic plane once per year using nightly observations in the anti - sun direction .",

    "stars with ecliptic latitudes between 13@xmath11 and + 13@xmath11 can , in principle , be detected by eurd .",
    "however , only those between 4@xmath11 and + 4@xmath11 are certain to fall into the field of view .",
    "the 12 stars presented in this paper are those which have been observed up to march 31 , 1999 .",
    "other stars were detected in these eurd data , however obtaining their spectra was impossible because of spectral confusion from other stars simultaneously in the field of view .",
    "eurd has detected stellar emission only from 912 to 1100  due to the absorption by the interstellar medium .",
    "the data reduction process consists of identifying and separating stellar point - source emission from the instrumental noise and diffuse emission produced by strong geocoronal airglow emission lines and possibly by the hot component of the interstellar medium .",
    "the photon counting detector records images with spectral resolution ( @xmath0 5  ) in one axis and angular resolution ( @xmath13 ) in the other axis .",
    "when a star falls in the field of view of the instrument , its spectra is distributed within a finite area in the angular dimension .",
    "in contrast , instrumental background and diffuse emission will be located along the entire angular dimension . to test for the presence of a stellar source , we accumulated an entire detector image every 28 seconds .",
    "the detector image was integrated over the spectral dimension to obtain a histogram of total spectral intensity as a function of field - view angle .",
    "if the maximum of the histogram exceeded 4 times the noise level , defined as the standard deviation of the continuum level of the histogram , then a stellar spectrum was obtained from the flux found within 7 angular pixels ( @xmath14 ) of the maximum .",
    "a net stellar spectrum was derived by subtracting the atmospheric and instrumental background taken from an equivalent area adjacent to the stellar region .",
    "the net spectrum s intensity was corrected using the inflight - calibrated variation of optical efficiency as a function of radiation input angle ( determined with observations of @xmath1 vir during april 1999 ) .",
    "intensity - corrected spectra were co - added for each stellar object and converted to fluxes , applying the in - flight calibration performed using simultaneous observations of the full moon with euve and eurd .",

    "the iue absolute flux calibration defined for the final archive used in this work is 7.2  10 % lower than the hubble space telescope flux scale ( gonzlez - riestra 1998 , massa & fitzpatrick 2000 ) .",
    "we have compared our data with the kurucz ( 1993 ) atmosphere models , extracted from the homogeneous grid of models of lejeune , cuisinier , & buser ( 1997 ) .",
    "the comparison with kurucz models is done with the same method we used for @xmath1 vir , binning iue and eurd spectra to the 10    spectral resolution of the models and dereddening them with the cardelli , clayton , & mathis ( 1989 ) extinction law . between 912 and 1100  this law",

    "eurd spectra and the appropriate kurucz models show a general agreement , with the best agreement occurring at wavelengths shorter than lyman @xmath8 ( 1026  ) .",
    "eurd integrated fluxes shortward of 1010   are 10 to 40% higher than kurucz fluxes in most cases ( see table 3 ) , while for wavelengths longward of lyman @xmath8 , the eurd flux can exceed the model values by up to 95% for the worst case ( hd 87901 [ @xmath1 leo ] , see fig . [ figeurdmodel ] ) .",
    "this confirms the result obtained for eurd observations of @xmath1 vir ( morales et al .",
    "2000 ) that also found higher fluxes than expected from the models .",
    "if we correct the iue absolute flux calibration to match the hst flux calibration , the agreement with the models improves except for the stars with negative difference ( hd 25204 and hd 175191 ) .",
    "only hd 138485 shows slightly less flux than the models longward of lyman @xmath8 , but this could reflect the uncertainty in the value of of r=6 used for dereddening .",
    "the same trend of observed fluxes higher than the models can be seen in iue spectra shortward of lyman @xmath1 ( 1216  ) for hd 23793 , hd 25204 and hd 29763 , and hd 87901 , although high fluxes at longest eurd wavelengths and shortest iue ones could be due to edge effects in the detectors .",
    "in fact , errors have been found to be systematically higher at iue shortest wavelengths ( massa & fitzpatrick 2000 ) .",
    "however , voyager data , which have the region between lyman @xmath1 and lyman @xmath8 in the middle of their detectors , agree with eurd fluxes for the two stars they have in common , @xmath1 vir and @xmath1 leo . fig .",
    "[ fighd87 ] shows a comparison of eurd and voyager observations with the corresponding model for @xmath1 leo , which shows the highest discrepancy from models at the longest eurd wavelengths .",
    "it is obvious that both observations closely agree with each other , and are significantly higher than the model .",
    "the agreement between voyager and eurd is also remarkable for @xmath1 vir ( morales et al .",
    "2000 ) , both being higher than the corresponding atmosphere model .",
    "main - sequence b stars are thought to be relatively well understood in terms of the modeling of their photospheres .",
    "however , as discussed earlier , there have been relatively few studies in the fuv to test available models .",
    "the discrepancies we found between observed and model fluxes could in principle arise from several different sources : eurd instrument calibration errors ; inappropriate ism reddening corrections ; deficiencies in the kurucz lte model atmosphere ; or errors in the adopted model stellar parameters",
    ".    an incorrect eurd calibration might be responsible for the discrepancy .",
    "however , the detailed character of our inflight calibration and the agreement in observed fluxes for two stars , @xmath1  vir and @xmath1  leo , observed by both _ voyager _ and eurd , using independent calibrations ( with white dwarfs and the moon respectively ) , give support to the correctness of our calibration .",
    "significant problems associated with our extinction corrections also seem unlikely . while accurate corrections for the effects of ism absorption and scattering in the fuv is a difficult problem ( e.g. , savage et al .",
    "1985 ) , all of our stars have very low values of reddening and consequently any uncertainty will be small . though early results from a survey of interstellar h@xmath17 made by fuse have indicated an ubiquitous presence of h@xmath17 ( tumlinson et al . 1999 ) , we have not applied corrections for h@xmath17 absorption because the h@xmath17 columns toward these targets are small and the effects should be negligible .",
    "we have verified this assumption by computing the h@xmath17 absorption in the 900 - 1100    range seen at the resolution of the eurd instrument .",
    "the relatively narrow molecular bands begin to saturate at quite low h@xmath17 columns ( @xmath18  @xmath19 ) .",
    "however , they account for relatively little net flux loss at these columns when integrated over the eurd response function .",
    "this same result was found by snow , allen & polidan ( 1990 ) for the case of _ voyager _ spectra : for a h@xmath17 column of @xmath20  @xmath19 ( a value higher than that expected for any of the main - sequence stars in our sample ) the net absorption amounts to less than 5  % .",
    "we do note that a value of r=1.0 would increase model fuv fluxes without distorting the iue range very much , but this value of r is very unlikely ( he et al .",
    "1995 )    we suggest that kurucz atmosphere models underestimate fluxes between lyman @xmath1 and lyman @xmath8 . it is worth noting that other authors studying stellar spectra in this wavelength range have also found discrepancies in the same direction between their observations and kurucz models ( e.g. , chavez , stalio , & holberg 1995 ; buss , kruk , & ferguson 1995 ; dixon & hurwitz 1998 ) .",
    "an important assumption used in the kurucz model atmospheres adopted in this study is that of lte . in order to investigate the effects of relaxing this assumption ,",
    "we have carried out new calculations using the tlusty model atmosphere program ( hubeny & lanz 1995 ; hubeny 2000 , private communication ) that uses extensive line - blanketing and that treats h , he and abundant metals fully in non - lte in both line and continuum processes .",
    "tlusty model atmospheres for representative effective temperatures of 15000  k and 20000  k , with a surface gravity of @xmath21 and solar metallicity ( [ m / h]@xmath22 ) , were computed both under the assumption of lte and also with the lte assumption relaxed .",
    "in addition , a slightly cooler model with effective temperature of 13500  k was added because of the rapid change in this temperature regime in important continuum opacity sources from neutral c , n and o to once ionized species in the fuv region .    in terms of temperature structure ,",
    "the lte and non - lte models are very similar in the deepest layers at all the effective temperatures investigated , as expected . toward higher layers in the line - forming regions ,",
    "the lte models are slightly hotter than the non - lte models by up to 400  k or so . in the outer layers",
    "this situation is reversed , with the non - lte models ending up hotter but by a larger amount of about 1500  k. we have computed the resulting synthetic spectra using the lte and non - lte models ; comparisons for the 15000  k models are illustrated in figure  [ f : lte_nlte_kur_15 ] , binned at a resolution commensurate to that of the iue spectra used to determined the stellar effective temperatures .",
    "we also illustrate the corresponding kurucz model as a grey shaded region .    for the iue spectral range ,",
    "although the forms of the lte and non - lte model spectra appear quite similar , many differences in the various more prominent absorption lines become readily apparent when examining these model spectra at high spectral resolution . at the lower resolution of the observations however , these differences become washed out and the emergent fluxes in each spectral bin are in general similar .",
    "the situation changes in the fuv range of interest for our eurd observations : it is immediately apparent that the non - lte model fluxes are substantially higher overall than the lte fluxes , especially in the region between lyman @xmath1 and @xmath8 . for the fuv spectral range between lyman @xmath1 and @xmath8 , differences between non - lte and lte model fluxes increase from longer to shorter wavelengths , amounting to as much as 30  %  or so near 1050   . toward wavelengths shortward of lyman  @xmath8 , lte and non - lte model",
    "fluxes converge slightly and are in somewhat better agreement .",
    "comparisons between hotter and cooler temperature models reveal an interesting trend . in the case of the hotter 20000  k model ,",
    "the differences between lte and non - lte fluxes are in the same sense as for the 15000  k model , but they are significantly smaller and amount to only 10  %  or so near 1050   .",
    "agreement throughout the iue range is also slightly better .",
    "in contrast , comparison of the slightly cooler 13500  k models reveals _ even larger differences _ between lte and non - lte fluxes than for the 15000  k models , amounting to approximately a factor of 2 at 1050   . in all cases",
    "the differences are reduced again toward wavelengths shortward of lyman  @xmath8 .",
    "we note that the trend of increasing disparity between lte and non - lte model fluxes with decreasing effective temperature , especially near 1050   , is similar to the discrepancies between observations and lte models , which are most pronounced for the coolest star of the sample .",
    "we also note that the wavelength regime in which the non - lte effects appear most significant supports our method of deriving effective temperatures based on iue fluxes longward of lyman  @xmath1 , where non - lte effects appear comparatively small at iue resolution . at the same time , our findings suggest difficulties for methods hoping to use fuv fluxes for the derivation of effective temperatures based on synthetic lte spectral indices .    making the straightforward conclusion that non - lte effects must be responsible for the model and observed fuv flux disparities in our program main - sequence b stars",
    "is complicated by the comparison between the tlusty lte and kurucz lte models .",
    "it is apparent from figure  [ f : lte_nlte_kur_15 ] that these are also not in good agreement in the fuv range .",
    "the kurucz model predicts more fuv flux than the tlusty model .",
    "the reason for these discrepancies is not obvious , though it may be related to differences in the line and continuum opacities employed .",
    "taking just the lte models , the kurucz models are in better agreement with the observations than the tlusty lte models .",
    "however the _ differential _ comparison of tlusty lte and non - lte models is valid and these non - lte effects will be in operation in late b star photospheres .",
    "therefore , while the problem as to the best model formulation for the fuv range must remain unanswered , we conclude that at least some , and perhaps all , of the differences we are observing between model and eurd fluxes are caused by departures from lte in the photosphere .",
    "the particular departures from lte that give rise to the effects described above are in the continua of low z metals that dominate the continuous opacity in the fuv region in late b stars .",
    "neutral species such as ci are overionized in the photospheric layers , and so the opacity is reduced leading to higher fluxes in the regions affected .",
    "toward higher effective temperatures the neutrals become more minor species and cease to dominate the continuous opacity ; departures from lte in these species are therefore less important .",
    "we have also investigated the sensitivity of the kurucz model fuv fluxes to the stellar parameters : effective temperature , surface gravity and metallicity .",
    "there are surprisingly few modern , detailed , high resolution spectroscopic studies available for main - sequence b field stars on which to draw for guidance as to the exact parameters and compositions of our target stars .",
    "as has been discussed by previous authors , the effective temperature scale of b main - sequence stars is dependent to a significant extent on the indices used to derive it , even down to different uv indices ( e.g. chavez et al . 1995 ; buss et al .",
    "moreover , it is well known that the fuv fluxes of b main - sequence stars are very sensitive to the effective temperature adopted .",
    "indeed , the 500 - 1000  k higher effective temperatures derived by buss et al .",
    "( 1995 ) based on _ hut _ fuv fluxes are a direct result of the same excess observed flux at short wavelengths as is evident in our eurd spectra . what is less often discussed is the effects of surface gravity and metallicity on these fluxes ( see fitzpatrick & massa 1999 , for a discussion on their effects on uv - optical fluxes ) .",
    "we illustrate the fuv flux sensitivity to model parameters for the case of the @xmath23  k model in figure  [ f : mod15_plots ] .",
    "as expected , strong sensitivity to temperature is shown by the comparison with a model 2000  k cooler , but with otherwise similar parameters .",
    "the flux disparity increases toward shorter wavelengths as expected from the analogous black body behavior .",
    "a difference of 2000  k in effective temperature is much larger than any uncertainties in the derivation of temperature scales , but it is clear that even adopting model parameters a few hundred degrees different would significantly alter the predicted fluxes in the very shortest wavelengths .",
    "the flux discrepancy we are seeing for @xmath1  leo is not simply an error in the adopted effective temperature .",
    "this is clear in view of the nature of the discrepancy : instead of increasing with decreasing wavelength , the model and observations are actually in much better agreement below 1000    than above .",
    "it is also clear from figure  [ f : mod15_plots ] that stellar fuv fluxes are not strongly dependent on the exact value of surface gravity adopted . reducing the surface gravity leads to a _ decrease _ in the fuv flux and a slight _ increase _ in the flux at the longest uv wavelengths .",
    "thus , for the case of a typical b star in our study , an error in the adopted surface gravity is likely to be at least partially compensated for by the derivation of a slightly different effective temperature .",
    "the resulting predicted fuv fluxes _ seen at the resolution of our instrument _ would be corrected for by a compensatory temperature error .",
    "the value adopted for the metallicity is much more important .",
    "previous fuv studies appear to have assumed that the metallicities of all early - type stars are identically equal to the solar value ( chavez et al .",
    "1995 ; buss et al .",
    "studies of disk stars and young stars formed in very similar ism environments show this not to be the case at levels that could be significant for fuv fluxes .",
    "the studies of abundances in main - sequence b stars in the orion association by cunha & lambert ( 1992 , 1994 ) revealed differences in o and si abundances of as much as 0.2 dex in stars co - located on the sky and at similar distances .",
    "they conjectured that these differences arose because they were formed from different regions of a parent molecular cloud enriched to different extents with the ejecta of type ii supernovae . on a much wider scale , young stars in the solar neighborhood",
    "also exhibit significant scatter in metallicity amounting to @xmath24  dex or so about the solar value ( e.g. luck & lambert 1985 ; nissen 1988 ; boesgaard 1989 ; edvardsson et al . 1993 ) .",
    "assumption of solar metallicity for young disk stars should therefore only be done under peril of errors of up to 50 % .    by inspection of figure",
    "[ f : mod15_plots ] , we note a difference in fuv flux shortward of lyman  @xmath8 of as much as 30  % for a model differing in metallicity by 0.5  dex , with the change occurring in the obvious sense that lower metallicity , leading to lower fuv opacity , leads to higher fuv fluxes . consequently , care should be taken in the adoption of the metallicity parameter if comparison is to be meaningful at a level of order 15  % or better .",
    "another possible stellar parameter that can have an important effect on fuv fluxes is microturbulent velocity .",
    "fitzpatrick & massa ( 1999 ) have found a dependence of uv flux on this parameter that is of the same order as the effect of surface gravity and metallicity .",
    "however , their calculation does not extend to the fuv",
    ". therefore it would be interesting to investigate the impact of microturbulent velocity in the eurd range .    in the particular case of @xmath1 leo",
    ", we note that its rotational velocity ( v = 350 km @xmath25 , bernacca & perinotto 1970 ) could also be important to interpret its large fuv flux excess .",
    "model calculations by collins & sonneborn ( 1977 ) predict a flux dependency on rotational velocity that becomes more significant in the fuv , for b0-f8 stars .",
    "however this effect has not been found observationally ( molnar , stephens & mallama 1978 , llorente de andrs & morales 1979 ) . on the other hand",
    ", it has been suggested that rotational velocities may induce an effective color excess for spectral types earlier than b6 ( maeder 1975 , llorente de andrs et al .",
    "1981 ) , which if neglected , would result in a spurious ultraviolet excess .",
    "this would not be the case for @xmath1 leo , a b7 star , and we suggest that its high rotational velocity do not have a significant impact on its fuv flux excess .",
    "we obtained spectra of two peculiar stars .",
    "however , the strong influence of metallicity in the far ultraviolet fluxes of model atmospheres makes comparisons with models difficult for these stars .",
    "an accurate knowledge of this stellar parameter is necessary in order to find the appropriate model to compare with the observations .",
    "the two peculiar stars we observed were :    * hd 210424*. a suspected chemically peculiar star of the si type in the catalog of renson , gerbaldi , & catalano ( 1991 ) .",

    "( 1997 ) found a metal abundance of [ fe / h ] @xmath26 , while leone , manfr , & catalano ( 1995 ) , with optical high resolution spectroscopy , could not find any sign of metallicity , while the overall flux distribution could be reproduced using a kurucz model ( atlas9 ) with solar abundance .",
    "this , together with flux differences of 20% among iue observations at @xmath27   makes the comparison with model atmospheres difficult . with both values of metallicity",

    "kurucz models fitted to maximum and minimum iue data show a difference of 600 k between them , and the extension of none of them fit well the eurd range .",

    "non - lte effects on low z metals , which are important continuum opacity sources , can lead to elevated fluxes shortward of the ci edge .",
    "we therefore suggest that the observed flux excesses compared to kurucz lte models between lyman  @xmath1 and @xmath8 could be due to departures from lte .",
    "the non - lte effects increase with decreasing effective temperature as the neutral absorbers , though significantly overionized , become major species . at higher effective temperatures these absorbers",
    "are completely ionized and do not contribute to the opacity .",
    "the common assumption of solar metallicity for young disk stars should be questioned when attempting to model the fuv flux of mid- and late - type b stars .",
    "even fairly small deviations from the solar mixture of 0.1 - 0.2  dex ( values typical of the scatter expected in present - day star - forming regions and in young stars in the solar neighborhood ) can have a significant and observable impact on fuv fluxes that are heavily moderated by metal line blanketing .",
