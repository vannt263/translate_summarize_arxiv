    "it is well known that inflation provides a natural explanation for some long - standing problems of the standard hot big bang cosmology .",
    "inflation is also a successful scenario for production and evolution of the perturbations in primary stages of the universe evolution [ 1 ] .",
    "although inflation paradigm is successful in these respects , there is a problem for realization of this scenario that we do not know how to integrate it with ideas of the particle physics [ 2,3,4 ] .",
    "one important feature of the inflationary paradigm is the fact that inflaton can interact with other fields such as gravitational sector of the theory .",
    "this interaction is shown by the non - minimal coupling of the inflaton field and ricci scalar in the spirit of the scalar - tensor theories .",
    "in fact , there are several compelling reasons for inclusion of an explicit non - minimal coupling of the inflaton field and gravity in the action .",
    "for instance , non - minimal coupling arises at the quantum level when quantum corrections to the scalar field theory are considered .",
    "even if for the classical , unperturbed theory this non - minimal coupling vanishes , it is necessary for the renormalizability of the scalar field theory in curved space . in most theories used to describe inflationary scenarios ,",
    "it turns out that a non - vanishing value of the coupling constant can not be avoided .",
    "also , in general relativity , and in all other metric theories of gravity in which the scalar field is not part of the gravitational sector , the coupling constant necessarily assumes the value of @xmath0 ( see [ 5,6 ] for more details ) .",
    "thus , it is natural to study an extension of the inflation proposal that contains explicit non - minimal coupling of the scalar field and gravity .",
    "currently , theories of extra spatial dimensions , in which the observed universe is realized as a brane embedded in a higher dimensional spacetime , have attracted a lot of attention . in this framework",
    ", ordinary matters are trapped on the brane , but gravitation propagates through the entire spacetime [ 7 - 15 ] .",
    "the cosmological evolution on the brane is given by an effective friedmann equation that incorporates the effects of the bulk in a non - trivial manner [ 16,17,18,19 ] .",
    "the chaotic inflation on the rsii brane has been studied for first time in [ 20 ]",
    ". then extension of this study to warm inflation has been preformed in [ 21 ] .    with these preliminaries ,",
    "the goal of the present study is to investigate a braneworld viewpoint of inflation with an explicit non - minimal coupling of the scalar field and ricci curvature on the brane .",
    "we study possible impact of the non - minimal coupling on the dynamics of this braneworld - inspired inflation .",
    "our setup is based on the rs ii braneworld model and we assume that brane is stable and inflation dynamics on the brane is independent of the bulk dynamics .",
    "we study modifications of this slow - roll inflation due to non - minimal coupling of the inflaton field and gravity on the brane .",
    "we study also parameter space of the model numerically to obtain constraints imposed on this model by recent observations released by wmap5+sdss+snia datasets and we compare our results with the minimal case studied in ref .",

    "we note that there are two critical values of @xmath1 given by @xmath12 that should be avoided to have well - defined field equations .",

    "[ 22 ] have treated this conservation on the brane in a relatively different way .",
    "they have defined a total energy - momentum tensor which consists of two parts : a pure ( canonical ) scalar field energy - momentum tensor and a non - minimal coupling - dependent part . the total energy density defined in this manner",
    "is then conserved . in our case",
    ", we have included all possible terms in equations ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) from the beginning and therefore , total energy density defined in this manner is conserved too .",

    "we should stress here that in our non - minimal setup , depending on the values of the non - minimal coupling @xmath7 , it is possible to fulfill @xmath69 condition even before fulfilling @xmath70 . in other words , for some values of the non - minimal coupling , inflation terminates if the condition @xmath68 is fulfilled .",

    "this feature is shown in figure @xmath73 for different values of the non - minimal coupling .",
    "we stress that in this figure the minimal case with @xmath39 accounts for natural exit without additional mechanism too .",
    "this is possible in our setup because of the braneworld effect . in the standard @xmath74-dimensional inflationary scenario with one minimally coupled inflaton field , it is impossible to exit inflationary phase naturally .",
    "we note also that the values of the non - minimal coupling @xmath7 used in the figures lie within the acceptable range for @xmath7 as has been obtained in ref .",
    "[ 25 ] by confrontation of a non - minimally coupled phantom cosmology with the recent observations ( see also [ 26 ] ) .",

    "the number of e - folds is proportional to the area enclosed between the @xmath81-curve and horizontal axis from @xmath78 to @xmath79 .",
    "figure @xmath82 shows the variation of @xmath81 versus @xmath1 for different values of the non - minimal coupling and for two different energy scales . as the value of the non - minimal coupling increases , the enclosed area between @xmath81-curve and horizontal axis decreases leading to the conclusion that the number of e - folds reduces by increasing the values of the non - minimal coupling .",
    "comparison with the minimal case shows also that the number of e - folds reduces by inclusion of a positive non - minimal coupling .",
    "now , we study scalar and tensor perturbations in this non - minimal model .",
    "these perturbations are supposed to be adiabatic on the brane .",
    "we define the scalar curvature perturbation amplitude of a given mode when re - enters the hubble radius as follows @xmath83 the scalar spectrum index is defined as follows @xmath84 the interval in wave number is related to the number of e - folds by the relation @xmath85 . substituting ( 3 ) into the relation ( 22 ) we find for @xmath86 @xmath87 using the slow - roll parameters , we have @xmath88 the running of the spectral index which is defined as @xmath89 in our model takes the following form @xmath90    tensor perturbations are bounded to the brane at long - wavelength and up to the first order these perturbations are decoupled from matter on the brane [ 21 ] .",
    "therefore , on the large scale we can use the classical expression for these amplitudes [ 20 ] .",
    "these amplitudes at the hubble crossing are given by @xmath91 where in our non - minimal case and within the slow - roll approximation @xmath92 is given by equation ( 13)with positive sign , explicitly depended on the non - minimal coupling , @xmath7 .",
    "the tensor spectral index is given by @xmath93 where @xmath54 is given by equation ( 15 ) .",
    "the ratio between the amplitude of tensor and scalar perturbations is given by @xmath94 after constructing the basic formalism , we study inflationary dynamics of this non - minimal model numerically . for this goal , in which follows and in all of our numerical calculations , we consider the well - known large - field inflationary potential @xmath95 with @xmath96 to investigate outcomes of our model .",
    "as has been shown previously in figures @xmath71 and @xmath73 , this non - minimal model accounts for natural exit from inflationary phase without any additional mechanism .",
    "in fact , non - minimal coupling of the inflaton field and gravity on the brane provides a suitable parameter space for natural exit from inflationary phase .",
    "figure @xmath74 shows the variation of @xmath97 for different values of the non - minimal coupling versus the inflaton field .    combining wmap5 with sdss and snia data ,",
    "the spectral index is given by ( see for instance [ 27 ] and references therein ) @xmath98 this result shows that a red power spectrum is favored and @xmath99 is disfavored even when gravitational waves are included , which constrains the models of inflation that can produce significant gravitational waves , such as chaotic or power - law inflation models , or a blue spectrum , such as hybrid inflation models .",
    "as we have shown , our non - minimal scenario on the brane gives also a red and nearly scale invariant power spectrum which excludes blue spectrum .",
    "since , @xmath100 , our numerical calculation shows that we can constraint @xmath7 to the following range @xmath101 which lies within the acceptable range for @xmath7 as has been obtained in ref . [",
    "25 ] by confrontation of a non - minimally coupled phantom cosmology with the recent observations .",
    "note that negative values of @xmath7 corresponding to anti - gravitation are excluded from our considerations .",
    "if there is running of the spectral index , the constraint on this running from combined data of wmap5+sdss+snia is given by @xmath102 within the @xmath103 cl [ 27 ] .",
    "the special case with @xmath104 and @xmath105 results in the scale invariant spectrum .",
    "the significance of @xmath97 and @xmath106 is that different inflation models motivated by different physics make specific , testable predictions for the values of these quantities .",
    "figure @xmath107 shows the running of the spectral index versus the inflaton field for different values of the non - minimal coupling for @xmath108 .",
    "evidently , our non - minimal setup agrees with this dataset and again we can use this observational data to constraint the values of the non - minimal coupling . in other words , since @xmath109 , we can constraint @xmath7 so that @xmath110 . comparing this range of @xmath7 with constraint ( 32 ) , we see that confrontation of this non - minimal brane inflation with recent observations leads to the result that @xmath111 which is acceptable from other studies such as ref . [",
    "one important point in our study is the issue of frame .",
    "there is a conformal transformation which transforms the action ( 1 ) ( which is written in the jordan frame ) to corresponding action in the einstein frame [ 5,6 ] . in the einstein frame ,",
    "the gravitational sector is expressed in terms of a re - scaled scalar field which is minimally coupled to gravity and evolves in a re - scaled potential , thereby simplifying the formalism .",
    "however , we should keep in mind that the matter sector is strongly affected by such a conformal transformation since all of the matter fields are now non - minimally coupled to the re - scaled metric : in particular , stress tensor conservation in the matter sector is no longer ensured [ 28,29 ] . on the other hand , as makino and sasaki [ 30 ] and fakir _ et al _ [ 31 ] have shown , the amplitude of scalar perturbation in the jordan frame exactly coincides with that in the einstein frame .",
    "this proof ( for details see [ 32 ] ) allows us to calculate the scalar power spectrum in the jordan and einstein frame . as a result",
    ", the scalar power spectrum has no dependence on the choice of frames , i.e. , it is conformally invariant .",
    "so , our results can be compared to observations directly without any ambiguities .",
    "this is an important point since one has to check validity of non - gravity experiments in einstein frame .",
    "for instance , validity of electro - magnetic related experiments such as cmb experiment should be checked in einstein frame . as komatsu and futamase have shown , the scalar power spectrum is independent on the choice of frames [ 32 ] .",
    "in the inflationary paradigm , inflaton field can interact with other fields such as ricci curvature .",
    "this interaction is shown by the non - minimal coupling of the inflaton and gravity in the action of the scenario .",
    "there are many compelling reasons to include an explicit non - minimal coupling in the action of the theory .",
    "so , naturally we should include non - minimal coupling of gravity and inflaton field in the action of an inflation scenario .",
    "usually by incorporation of the non - minimal coupling it is harder to realize inflation even with potential that are known to be inflationary in the minimal case .",
    "however , inclusion of the non - minimal coupling is inevitable from field theoretical viewpoint especially their renormalizability . in this paper",
    "we have studied an inflation model that there is an explicit non - minimal coupling of the inflaton field and gravity on the randall - sundrum ii brane .",
    "this is an extension of the study presented in ref .",
    "[ 20 ] to scalar - tensor type theories .",
    "we have studied impact of the non - minimal coupling on the dynamics of this braneworld - inspired inflation .",
    "as we have shown , this model provides a natural exit from the inflationary phase without adopting any additional mechanism for appropriate values of the conformal coupling . the number of e - folds decreases by increasing the values of the conformal coupling , @xmath7",
    ". a confrontation with recent wmap5+sdss+ snia combined data shows that this model gives a red and nearly scale invariant power spectrum for @xmath108 and @xmath112 . from another viewpoint , comparison of this non - minimal inflation model with observational data could provide severe constraints on the values of the non - minimal coupling . in this paper",
    "our numerical analysis shows that @xmath111 is favored by non - minimal inflation on the randall - sundrum ii brane . since we have calculated the first order contributions in slow - roll parameters , our results are valid in both jordan and einstein frames .",
    "however , higher order corrections could lead to different results in these two frames .",
    "finally , we note that inclusion of the non - minimal coupling of gravity and inflaton field produces a wider parameter space relative to minimal case .",
    "this wider parameter space provides much more freedom than single self - interacting scalar field to fit with the observational data .",
