    "recently , there have been extensive studies of both the statics and dynamics of the pb / si(111 ) system @xcite . at equilibrium ,",
    "the system can exist in a striped incommensurate ( si ) phase with stripes of domain walls separating commensurate domains , as well as in a hexagonal incommensurate ( hi ) phase with a hexagonal pattern of domain walls @xcite . in growth processes",
    ", the system displays spontaneous self - organization and height selection of pb islands beyond the monolayer regime .",
    "the most striking feature of this system is that the observed rate of island growth implies a rate of mass transport orders of magnitude faster than that from the usual atomic diffusion mechanism @xcite .",
    "theoretical models @xcite indicate that domain wall motion in an incommensurate phase can provide the basic mechanism for such fast dynamics .",
    "this anomalous fast mass transport dynamics was subsequently confirmed in another experimental study following the refilling of a hole region in the adsorbate layer in real time @xcite .",
    "the results also showed an unexpected bifurcation of the initial step profile into two sharp fronts , with a hexagonal phase in between , propagating in opposite directions at a speed much faster than that due to simple atomic diffusion .",
    "previously , we performed a molecular dynamics ( md ) simulation @xcite study of an atomistic model that admits both the si and hi phases .",
    "we found that for an initial step profile separating a bare substrate region ( or a hole ) from the rest of the si phase , the domain wall dynamics leads to a bifurcation of the initial step profile into two interfaces propagating in opposite directions at a superfast speed with a hi phase in between , in agreement with the experimental observation on the pb / si(111 ) system @xcite .",
    "this theoretical study indicates that there are two central ingredients for the observed anomalous superfast mass transport mechanism with profile bifurcation .",
    "the first is the existence of a discontinuous transition between two incommensurate phases such as the si and the hi phases corresponding to different coverages .",
    "the second is the ability of the si phase to transform itself rapidly into the hi phase near the boundary of the two phases , and the ultrafast domain wall dynamics in the hi phase with a negligible peierls pinning barrier .",
    "however , the simulation study was limited to relatively small system sizes and short time scales when compared to the experimental systems , and the propagating fronts observed in the simulation studies was not as sharp as the experimentally observed . to overcome the system size and time scale limits and clarify the basic physics behind the observed anomalous mass transport mechanism like the one observed for pb / si(111 ) system , we consider in this work a simple continuous density field description of a strained overlayer by the phase field crystal ( pfc ) model @xcite . unlike the conventional pfc model , which retains density variation at microscopic atomic length scales , here",
    "we employ a coarse - grained pfc model where the fundamental length scale corresponds to the separation between the domain walls .",
    "thus the origin of the formation of domains and domain walls due to the competition of lattice mismatch strain energy and the adsorbate - substrate binding energy do not appear explicitly in the model .",
    "instead , a periodic array of domains in the incommensurate phase is built into the model via a preferred length scale that corresponds to the separation between the domain walls .",
    "this model allows for both an si and a honeycomb incommensurate ( hoi ) phases .",
    "there is a discontinuous transition between the si and the hoi phases .",
    "this will lead to the bifurcation of the propagating fronts just as that observed in the pb / si(111 ) system @xcite resulting from the discontinuous si - hi transition .",
    "the pfc model also has negligible conversion barriers between the si and hoi phases as well as that for the peierls barrier for the hoi model , which are the other ingredients for the anomalous mass transport mechanism .",
    "the main advantage of this simple coarse - grained model is that it allows us to study much larger system sizes and get a clear qualitative physical picture of the mass transport mechanism in these systems .",
    "the long - time dynamics of the adsorbed overlayer in the incommensurate phase is essentially controlled by the nature and interaction of the topological defects that characterize such a phase , which consist of an array of interacting domain walls forming the si , hi or hoi phases . to model such topological defects in the simplest way , we use a phase - field description , where the physically relevant continuous density field is the adsorbed layer coverage .",
    "phase - field models are based on free - energy functionals , which are constructed by considering symmetries and conservation laws @xcite . in order to take into account the structural changes of the domain - wall structure of the adsorbed layer , we follow the approach of the two - dimensional phase - field crystal model @xcite , described by the free - energy functional @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the density field , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are effective dimensionless parameters , and @xmath4 is a dimensionless reference density . for convenience ,",
    "we set @xmath5 and @xmath6 . the fundamental length scale is set by @xmath7 which corresponds to the spacing between domain walls .",
    "the last term represents a pinning potential @xmath8 . unlike the conventional pfc model @xcite , where the density field corresponds to the atomic density coarse - grained over vibrational time scales , we consider the present model as described in eq .",
    "( [ model ] ) as a coarse - grained description of the overlayer , which averages out spatial variations at the microscopic scales , but incorporates the domain wall patterns .",
    "the domain walls are light ( heavy ) for a compressively ( tensile ) strained adsorbate layer .",
    "correspondingly , for a compressively strained system the regions near maxima in the phase field @xmath1 correspond to a commensurate domain , whereas the region around the minima of the density constitute the domain walls . for a tensile strained overlayer , we just need to reverse the interpretation of the maxima and minima of the density as domain walls and commensurate domains , respectively .",
    "note that in this interpretation of the model , there is no atomic spatial resolution , but only the spatial resolution of the domain wall structure .",
    "it does incorporate the essential ingredient for fast mass transport with profile bifurcation , which is the existence of a structural phase transition with discontinuity in the density .",
    "just as in the standard pfc model @xcite , the model of eq .",
    "( [ model ] ) displays a first - order transition between the si and hoi phases with light ( heavy ) domain walls for decreasing ( increasing ) density .",
    "the main assumption for the dynamics is that the density field @xmath9 should evolve in time in a way that reduces the total free energy @xmath10 .",
    "since density field is conserved , it satisfies the continuity equation @xmath11 where the current density is given phenomenologically by @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a kinetic coefficient setting the fundamental time scale for the domain wall motion .",
    "this should be orders of magnitude smaller than the atomic diffusion time scale at low temperatures since it is controlled by the relatively small peierls energy barrier @xcite pinning the domain walls and governing the conversion of the si phase to the hoi phase , rather than the corrugation of the adsorption potential which controls atomic diffusion .",
    "due to the discontinuous transition described by eq .",
    "( [ model ] ) , the dependence of the current density @xmath14 on the density field @xmath15 does not follow , in general , the usual fick s law @xmath16 .",
    "this is consistent with the behavior found in the experiments for pb / si(111 ) , which has been argued @xcite to imply an apparent anomalous diffusion . from eqs .",
    "( [ cont ] ) and ( [ fick ] ) , the time evolution of @xmath15 is then described by the cahn - hilliard dynamic equation @xcite @xmath17",

    "figure [ phd ] shows a portion of the phase diagram near the si to hoi phase transition as a function of the average density @xmath22 ( for @xmath23 ) for the light domain wall case . in the range @xmath24 ,",
    "the honeycomb and striped phases coexist while for @xmath25 and @xmath26 , the equilibrium phases correspond to the hoi and si phases , respectively , as shown in fig .",
    "[ phases ] . for small @xmath27 or small @xmath28 ,",
    "there is also a uniform phase without domain - wall patterns , which is of no interest here .",
    "the time evolution of an initial state with a density profile containing a hole with a lower density ( @xmath29 ) will be different for an initial si or a hoi phase .",
    "for an initial si phase , the decrease in the average density after creating the hole can bring the system near or into the coexistence region . if the average density @xmath22 after the creation of the hole is in the range @xmath30 , then an hoi region centered at the hole can coexist with the remaining si phase at long times . for an initial hoi phase",
    ", however , the decrease in the density moves the system further away from the coexistence region and there is just a spreading of the density without an expanding interface , following the creation of a hole , eventually tending to a uniform profile .    .",

    "the outward front corresponds to a si - hoi interface , where the local stripe pattern is converted into a honeycomb pattern , while the inwards front is a step edge refilling the hole .",

    "a sign of the decay of the hoi region at long times could be the partial recovery of density in the hexagonal phase found in the experiment .",
    "for this system , the boundary of the coexistence region between hoi phase and si phase , at coverage values @xmath50 and @xmath31 in fig .",

    "the existence of this lower critical coverage for this system is most likely due to the existence of other commensurate phases at or slightly above coverage @xcite 1.2 ml .",
    "this is beyond the scope of our simple model , which focuses only on the si and hoi phases near a single commensurate phase at a slightly higher coverage than the si / hoi boundary .",
    "other more microscopic models @xcite can account for this critical coverage as a competition between the lattice mismatch strain energy and the adsorbate - substrate binding energy for increasing coverage .    in the refilling experiment for pb / si(111 ) @xcite ,",

    "the new model is similar to the traditional pfc model @xcite , but the interpretation of the phase field and the fundamental length scale are different .",
    "it focuses on the domain wall pattern and not the density variation inside the commensurate domains at a microscopic scale .",
    "it shares with the conventional pfc model the advantage that numerical work can be performed for system sizes orders of magnitude larger than in microscopic md simulation studies @xcite .",
    "our results for the mass transport mechanism are qualitatively similar to the previous md work of an atomistic model @xcite . taken together , they clearly demonstrate that the essential ingredient for the mass transport with a bifurcation of the initial profile is the presence of two incommensurate phases with a first order transition between the two incommensurate phases involving a discontinuity in the coverage . in the work presented here ,",
    "the two incommensurate phases involved are the si phase and the hoi phase , but qualitatively it has the same feature as the si - hi phase transition in the pb / si(111 ) adsorption system .",
    "this mass transport mechanism is fast because the hi and the hoi phases have negligible peierls pinning barriers while the conversion of the si phase to the hi or hoi phase near the phase transition boundary also involves barriers much lower than those for atomic diffusion .",
    "the si - hi transition corresponds to the pb / si(111 ) adsorption system @xcite and many heteroepitaxial metallic overlayers @xcite , while the si - hoi transition occurs for a system such as xe / pt(111 ) , xe / graphite and kr / graphite @xcite . in these cases , the commensurate state is a @xmath65 phase , which can undergo a transition into the si phase and then to the hoi phase @xcite .",
    "our results here demonstrate that the phenomena of fast mass transport should not be just confined to the pb / si(111 ) system alone , but is expected to be a general feature for a wide class of surface adsorption systems under appropriate conditions .",
