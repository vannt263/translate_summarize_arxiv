    "the novelty of the work presented here is that we re - transcribe the problem of routing in a delay tolerant network ( dtn )  @xcite on the basis of mobility patterns into a problem of routing in a virtual space defined by those patterns . by doing so",
    ", we can bring the powerful formalism of euclidean space to bear on the problem of dtn routing .    in one common dtn scenario ,",
    "nodes are mobile and have wireless networking capabilities .",
    "they are able to communicate together only when they are within transmission range .",
    "the network suffers from frequent connectivity disruptions , making the topology intermittently and partially connected .",
    "this means that there is a very low probability that an end - to - end path exists between a given pair of nodes at a given time .",
    "end - to - end paths can exist temporarily , or may sometimes never exist , with only partial paths emerging . due to these disruptions , regular ad - hoc networking approaches to routing and transport do not hold , and new solutions must be proposed .",
    "the delay tolerant network research group ( dtnrg )  @xcite has proposed an architecture  @xcite to support messaging that may be used by delay tolerant applications in such a context .",
    "the architecture consists mainly of the addition of a new layer to the regular tcp / ip stack called the bundle layer .",
    "messages transferred in dtns are called bundles .",
    "they are transferred in an atomic fashion between nodes using tcp in order to ensure node - to - node reliability .",
    "these messages can be of any size .",
    "nodes are assumed to have large buffers in which they can store the bundles .",
    "routing is one of the very challenging open issues in dtns , as mentioned by jain et al .",
    "indeed , since the network suffers from connectivity issues , manet  @xcite routing algorithms such as olsr , based on the spreading of control information , or aodv , which is on - demand , fail to achieve routing .",
    "different approaches have to be found .",
    "epidemic routing is a possible solution when nothing is known about the behavior of nodes . since it can lead to buffer overloads and inefficient use of transmission media",
    ", one would prefer to limit bundle duplication and instead use routing heuristics that can take advantage of context . in order to move in such a direction",
    ", the dtn architecture defines several types of contacts : scheduled , opportunistic , and predicted .",
    "_ scheduled _ contacts can exist , for instance , between a base station somewhere on earth and a low earth orbiting relay satellite .",
    "_ opportunistic _ contacts are created simply by the presence of two entities at the same place , in a meeting that was neither scheduled nor predicted . finally , _ predicted _ contacts are also not scheduled , but predictions of their existence can be made by analyzing previous observations .",
    "some work has been done with scheduled contacts , such as the paper by jain et al .",
    "@xcite that tries to improve the connectivity of an isolated village to the internet based on knowledge of when a low - earth orbiting relay satellite and a motor bike might be available to make the necessary connections . also of interest ,",
    "work on inter - planetary  @xcite networking uses predicted contacts such as the ones between planets within the framework of a dtn architecture .",
    "the case of only opportunistic contacts has been analyzed by vahdat and becker  @xcite using the epidemic routing scheme .",
    "most of the work around routing in dtns has been performed with predicted contacts , such as the algorithm of lindgren et al .",
    "@xcite , which relies on nodes having a community mobility pattern .",
    "nodes mainly remain inside their community and sometimes visit the others . as a consequence ,",
    "a node may transfer a bundle to a node that belongs to the same community as the destination . in a similar manner ,",
    "burns et al .",
    "@xcite proposed a routing algorithm that uses past frequencies of contacts . also making use of past contacts , davis et al .",
    "@xcite improved the basic epidemic scheme with the introduction of adaptive dropping policies .",
    "recently , musolesi et al .",
    "@xcite have introduced a generic method that uses kalman filters to combine and evaluate the multiple dimensions of the context in order to take routing decisions .",
    "the context is made of measurements that nodes perform periodically , which can be related to connectivity issues , but not necessarily .",
    "this mechanism allows network architects to define their own hierarchy among the different context attributes .",
    "the case study presented in this paper relies also on contacts that can be characterized as predicted , but the underlying idea is a more generic abstraction compared to previous work , being able to capture the interesting properties of major mobility patterns for routing .",
    "the main contribution of this paper is the use , for routing in dtns , of the formalism of a high - dimensional euclidean space based on nodes mobility patterns .",
    "we show the feasibility of this concept through an example in which each dimension represents the probability for a node to be found in a particular location .",
    "we conduct a simulation that produces promising initial results for this concept .    applying",
    "the formalism of euclidean space to computer networking problems is not in itself a new idea . to our knowledge , however , it has not previously been used for dtn routing .",
    "furthermore , we believe that the idea of constructing a virtual space based upon mobility patterns is new .    previous work with euclidean spaces for networking has included the geolocalization of internet hosts , as in the geoping technique developed by padmanabhan and subramanian  @xcite .",
    "the position of a host to localize in euclidean space is compared to the position of well know landmark nodes in order to estimate the host s location .",
    "round trip times are used to determine coordinates .",
    "as opposed to what we do here , this euclidean space is not used for routing .",
    "euclidean spaces have also been exploited in peer - to - peer architectures , notably by ratnasamy et al .",
    "for can  @xcite , in order to construct a robust and scalable mechanism to handle search queries . in this case , the euclidean space is a virtual space , in which keys describing files are assigned virtual coordinates , and each node in the system governs a portion of the space .",
    "queries are routed from node to node in the direction of the key .",
    "the routing scheme presented in this paper is similar to the one of can , since messages are routed in a virtual space . as opposed to can ,",
    "in our scheme there is no notion of neighbor in the virtual space .",
    "nodes may be directly connected to nodes that are nearby or that are very far . and these connections arise and dissolve dynamically as a function of node mobility in the physical space .",
    "nodes opportunistically take advantage of connections that promise to advance bundles toward the destination .",
    "the rest of the paper is structured as follows .",
    "[ sec_algo ] describes the mobility pattern based routing scheme .",
    "[ sec_simus ] presents the simulation results .",
    "[ sec_conclu ] concludes the paper , discussing directions for future work .",
    "this section first presents the idea behind routing in a high - dimensional euclidean space constructed upon mobility patterns of nodes and then shows how we applied this idea within the framework of a scenario inspired by real observations .",
    "the euclidean virtual space introduced here is a generalization of ideas that are already current in the dtn literature .",
    "the principle is to use a euclidean space as a tool to help nodes to take routing decisions .",
    "these decisions rely on the notion that a node is a good candidate for taking custody of a bundle if it has a mobility pattern similar to that of the bundle s destination .",
    "routing is done by forwarding bundles toward nodes that have mobility patterns that are more and more similar to the mobility pattern of the destination .    in the space that we define",
    ", the mobility pattern of a node provides its coordinates .",
    "several questions arise .",
    "what type of dimensions do we choose , how many , and what kind of range for values do we define ? how do we define the notion of distance ?",
    "is straightforward euclidean distance useful or are other similarity functions more appropriate ?",
    "is it possible to have an infinite space in terms of the number of dimensions ? what might be the problems with such a scheme ?",
    "note that the objective of this paper is not to answer all these questions .",
    "it is to introduce a new concept for routing and to examine some of the interesting problems that the concept presents . in this section",
    ", we describe a manner in which mobility patterns can be characterized and discuss other possible alternatives .",
    "the question of the choice of a similarity metric is addressed in sec .",
    "[ case_study ] .",
    "several methods could be employed to describe a mobility pattern .",
    "for instance it could be based upon historic information regarding contacts that the node has already had .",
    "if we want to route a bundle from one node to another , we have an interest in considering information on these contacts as forming a virtual space .",
    "each possible contact is an axis , and the distance along that axis indicates a measure of the probability of contact .",
    "two nodes that have a similar set of contacts that they see with similar frequencies are close in this space , whereas nodes that have very different sets of contacts , or that see the same contacts but with very different frequencies , are going to be far .",
    "it seems reasonable that one would wish to pass a bundle to a node that is as close as possible to the destination in this space , because this should improve the probability that it will eventually reach the destination .    in the virtual contact space",
    "just described , knowledge of all axes of the space requires knowledge of all nodes that are circulating in the space .",
    "note that a full knowledge of the axes might not be required for successful routing .",
    "nonetheless , we might wish to consider an alternative space in which there is a fixed , or at least more limited and well known number of axes .",
    "if nodes visits to particular locations can be tracked , then the mobility pattern of a node can be described by its visits to these locations . in this scenario ,",
    "each axis represents a location , and the distance along the axis represents the probability of finding a node at that location .",
    "we can imagine that nodes that have similar probabilities of visiting a similar set of locations are more likely to encounter each other than nodes that are very different in these respects .",
    "this is the virtual space that we employ in the study described in sec .",
    "[ case_study ] .",
    "dtn routing in a contact space or a mobility space is based on the assumption that there will be regularities in the contacts that nodes have or their choices of locations to visit .",
    "there is always the possibility that , we may encounter mobility patterns similar to the ones observed with random mobility models .",
    "the efficiency of the virtual space as a tool may be limited if nodes too rapidly change their habits .",
    "some problems could occur even if nodes have well defined mobility patterns for instance , in the euclidean space , a bundle may reach a local maximum if a node has a mobility pattern that is the most similar in the local neighborhood to the destination node s mobility pattern , but is not sufficient for one reason or another to achieve the delivery . in the second type of space where each dimension represents a location , it can happen if nodes visit similar places , but for timing reasons , such as being on opposite diurnal cycles , they never meet .",
    "other issues surrounding the use of a virtual contact space or mobility space are discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec_conclu ] .",
    "recent studies of the mobility of students in a campus @xcite or corporate users @xcite equipped with pdas or laptops able to be connected to wireless access networks , show that they follow common mobility patterns .",
    "they show that significant aspects of the behavior can be characterized by power - law distributions .",
    "specifically , the session durations and the frequencies of the places visited by users follow power laws .",
    "this means that users typically visit a few access points frequently while visiting the others rarely , and that users may stay at few locations for long periods while visiting the others for very short periods .",
    "henderson et al . observed  @xcite that @xmath0% of users studied spent @xmath1% of their time attached to a single access point and this proportion decreased exponentially .",
    "if we take these wireless access network studies to be representative of a class of mobile node behavior , we can consider that these observations are applicable to at least certain dtn scenarios .    for this case",
    "study we propose the following mobility model .",
    "let us consider a set of nodes that move among a set of @xmath2 locations .",
    "two nodes can communicate only if they are at the same location .",
    "node movements are based on power - laws , and each node has a mobility pattern defined by the distribution of @xmath3 .",
    "@xmath4 is the probability for the node to be at location @xmath5 and @xmath6 with @xmath7 the probability of being found in the location @xmath5 , @xmath8 the exponent of the power - law based mobility pattern and @xmath9 a constant .",
    "@xmath10 means that the location @xmath11 is the preferred one .",
    "because @xmath12 , we have :    @xmath13    under this model , @xmath8 is the fundamental parameter governing node behavior . as shown in fig .",
    "[ im_distributions ] , when @xmath8 is high , nodes tend to move among a very small subset of locations , having one that they strongly prefer to the others .",
    "as @xmath8 approaches @xmath14 , the range of locations that nodes visit regularly becomes wider , while still presenting a hierarchy of preferences .",
    "when @xmath15 , we have equiprobability .     power - law probability distributions for different values of @xmath8.,width=302 ]    note that a mobility pattern should also characterize the time that a node remains at each location .",
    "we propose to capture this in the mobility model described here by uniformly distributing the resting time at each location over the interval @xmath16 $ ] with @xmath17 and @xmath18 quite close together , and by allowing nodes to randomly choose the same location consecutively .    for each of the nodes in this model , there is therefore a well defined probability of finding that node at each of the @xmath2 locations .",
    "this set of probabilities is a node s mobility pattern , and is described by a point in an @xmath2 dimensional euclidean space .",
    "we propose to route bundles in this space by sending them to nodes having mobility patterns that are successively closer to the mobility pattern of the destination . in simple words ,",
    "we prefer to give custody of a bundle to a node that has mobility habits similar to those of the bundle s destination . in order to complete our model",
    ", we therefore require a similarity function that can be used to compare mobility patterns .",
    "we study the following functions , each of which is a measure of similarity between two points in a euclidean space :    * _ euclidean distance _ :",
    "this is the most common distance measure .",
    "it returns the root of the sum of the square differences between the coordinates of a pair of points .",
    "+ @xmath19 * _ canberra distance _ : canberra distance returns the sum of a series of fractional differences between coordinates of a pair of points . each fractional difference term has a value between 0 and 1 . if one of coordinate is zero , the term is defined to be unity regardless the other value .",
    "+ @xmath20 * _ cosine angle separation _ : this measure represents the cosine of the angle between two vectors .",
    "it measures similarity rather than distance or dissimilarity .",
    "thus , a high cosine angle separation value indicates that two vectors are similar .",
    "+ @xmath21 * _ matching distance _ : this measure is simply the raw number of location probabilities that are similar for two nodes .",
    "we consider two coordinates on a given axis to be similar if their absolute difference is less than or equal to a defined value @xmath22 .",
    "+    in the routing scheme presented here , the only information that must be flooded by nodes is their mobility patterns .",
    "these mobility patterns can be spread in an epidemic fashion .",
    "furthermore , we introduce an optimization based upon the power - law distribution of probabilities . under this optimization , nodes transmit only the main components of their mobility patterns .",
    "the other components are presumably negligible in comparison .",
    "we examine the performance and the limits of such an optimization in sec .",
    "[ partial ] .",
    "this section presents the manner in which we evaluated the mobility pattern based routing scheme , and the results we obtained .",
    "we have implemented a stand alone simulator to evaluate the mobility pattern based routing scheme presented in this paper .",
    "this simulator only implements the transport and network layers and it makes simple assumptions regarding lower layers , for instance allowing for infinite bandwidth .    in this paper , we refer to routing based on mobility patterns by the following names : _ euclidean _ , using the euclidean distance metric ; _ canberra _ , using the canberra distance metric ; _ angle _ , using the cosine angle separation distance metric ; and _ matching _ , using the matching distance metric .",
    "we compared these routing algorithms against the following :    * _ epidemic _ : this is based on epidemic routing , as described by vahdat and becker  @xcite : each time two nodes meet , they exchange their bundles .",
    "the major interest of this algorithm is that it provides the optimum path and thus the minimum bundle delay .",
    "we use it here as a lower bound . in practice ,",
    "epidemic routing suffers from high buffer occupancy and high bandwidth utilization . *",
    "_ opportunistic _ : a node waits to meet the destination in order to transfer its bundle .",
    "the main advantage of this method is that it involves only one transmission per bundle . * _ random _ : when a node is at a location and the bundle s destination in not there , the node transfers the bundle to a neighbor chosen at random .",
    "we have added a rule to avoid local loops : a node can only handle a bundle one time per location visit .",
    "this scheme is used in this paper as another basis of comparison .",
    "a novel algorithm should perform better than this one in order to be valuable .",
    "all the scenarios simulated in the rest of the paper share common parameters that can be found in table  [ simulation_parameters ] .",

    "furthermore we have consider in this work that nodes have the knowledge of their mobility pattern , but to fit better with real conditions of deployments questions about the way nodes learn or get their mobility patterns have to be investigate .",

    "finally , in this work we consider that the essential characteristics of a node s mobility or contact patterns are fully captured by the frequency with which nodes find themselves in certain locations or the probability that they will be in proximity to certain nodes .",
    "however , prior work  @xcite , has demonstrated the interest of capturing temporal information as well . it is well known that network usage patterns follow diurnal and weekly cycles .",
    "we could easily imagine two nodes that visit the same locations with the same frequencies , but on different days of the week .",
    "though it still might make sense to route to one node in order to reach the other , especially if there is a relay node at the commonly visited location , the euclidean space description that we have provided does not capture this point of dissimilarity .",
    "we can , however , imagine ways in which the dimensional representation could capture temporal information as well .",
    "for instance , visiting patterns could be translated into the frequential domain .",
    "a node s visits to a location could be represented by a point on a frequency axis , capturing the dominant frequency of visits , and a point on a phase axis , as well as a point on the axis already described , that represents the overall probability of visiting the location .",
