    "the identification and subsequent study of extrasolar planets has become a subject of intense interest in recent years . to date , @xmath6250 giant planets have been discovered , ranging in mass from neptune to greater than jupiter .",
    "these new worlds are altering our understanding of the formation and evolutionary processes of giant planets in the immediate solar neighborhood .",
    "currently , the majority of them have been found using radial velocity ( rv ) techniques , which favours the detection of close - in , massive planets",
    ".    statistical analysis of current rv detections indicates that 1.2@xmath9@xmath130.3@xmath9 of nearby f , g and k stars are orbited by ` hot jupiter ' ( hj ) planets , those with orbital periods of only a few days ( @xmath40.1 au ) and minimum masses approximately equal to that of jupiter @xcite . such discoveries have challenged traditional ideas of planetary evolution , implying that a rapid migration of the planet takes place soon after formation .",
    "planet frequency from radial velocities appear to depend on the metallicity of the host star @xcite .",
    "however , there is very little observational evidence for a lower planetary frequency at quite low metallicities , due to the bias of radial velocity detections in association with bright nearby high metallicity stars .",
    "hence dedicated surveys in low metallicity environments , like globular clusters , can provide information to help understand this relationship in a more robust manner .",
    "indeed , does low metallicity halt planet formation or just affect the planetary migration process ?    of the currently known planets , @xmath690@xmath9 have only a minimum mass assigned to them , due to the unknown inclination of the planetary orbit , and unknown radii and densities .",
    "these quantities can be measured for transiting planets .",
    "due to its short orbital period , each hj has a non - negligible probability of transiting its host star that depends on the orbital separation and the ratio between the stellar and planetary radii .",
    "typical transit depths and durations are @xmath61.5@xmath9 and @xmath62 hours respectively . with precise photometry these transiting systems can be identified in the field , leading to direct measurements of the planetary radius ( provided the stellar radius is known ) from the depth of the transit dip .",
    "studies of the planetary atmosphere may be attempted if transits occur , and when coupled with rv measurements , accurate mass and density determinations can be made .",
    "currently , 28 transiting exoplanets are known @xcite , only a handful of which were first discovered through radial velocity searches . despite an increasing number ,",
    "the detection rate of planets from transit searches is significantly lower than initially expected eg , @xcite .",
    "this lack of detections is due , in part , to observing strategy : a long observing window ( @xmath141 month equivalent ) with a dedicated telescope coupled with a wide field and high temporal resolution are needed to sample enough stars frequently enough to allow the detection of a transit .",
    "also the production of a large enough number ( @xmath15 ) of high - quality ( @xmath40.02 mag ) lightcurves of dwarf stars coupled with a sensitive detection algorithm with low false alarm rates is non - trivial .",
    "recently , @xcite analyzed ogle  iii transit surveys in galactic fields and concluded that the occurrence frequencies of the detected planets in these surveys is not statistically different from that found in rv surveys of nearby stars .",
    "however , they did conclude that the frequency of hj planets with periods p satisfying 3@xmath10p@xmath105 days ( @xmath16  1/320(1@xmath17 ) at a 90@xmath9 confidence ) was statistically different from and larger than that of very hot jupiter ( vhj ) planets ( 1@xmath10p@xmath103 days ) , which have @xmath181/710(1@xmath19 ) at 90@xmath9 confidence . since the ogle  iii surveys detected no planets with radius larger than 1.3r@xmath20,they placed upper limits on the occurrence frequency of larger worlds .",
    "transit searches , unlike rv , are not limited to the immediate solar neighborhood and can be used to measure relative planet frequencies in various regions of the galaxy , providing information on the role environmental effects play on hj planet formation .",
    "early predictions for the success of transit searches in open clusters was presented by @xcite , indicating that with a large amount of telescope time planets could be detected via the transit technique in nearby clusters .",
    "more recently , @xcite presented an analysis of the prospective harvest of cluster transit surveys by discussing the observational techniques and methods to maximise the chances of a detection .",
    "they concluded that due to their mass functions , the most populous , nearby and bright clusters have the greatest chance of yielding a planet . @xcite then went on to discuss specifically the detection of short period ` hot earth ' and ` hot neptune ' planets .",
    "the detection yields for various nearby clusters with various instruments was estimated .",
    "agree that small - aperture wide field surveys targetting nearby clusters have the potential to discover transiting hot neptune planets .",
    "transit searches have been undertaken in bright metal - rich open clusters including stepps @xcite , ustaps @xcite , pisces @xcite , @xmath21 @xcite , explore - oc @xcite and in the praesepe cluster ( m44 ) with kelt @xcite .",
    "searches have also been performed in the general galactic field @xcite and toward the galactic bulge @xcite . if cluster candidates are confirmed as planetary in nature , difficult if fainter than v@xmath617.0 , they can provide information on the timescales of hj formation and subsequent migration .",
    "null results of high significance allow planet frequency upper limits to be estimated .",
    "globular clusters provide an excellent opportunity to study the effects of environment on planetary frequency .",
    "two bright , nearby southern clusters , 47 tuc and @xmath0 centauri , have stars in sufficient numbers ( @xmath610@xmath22 ) and brightness ( v@xmath2317 ) for meaningful statistics to be gained using ground - based telescopes of moderate aperture .",
    "47 tuc was previously sampled for planetary transits , resulting in a high significance ( @xmath243@xmath25 ) null result in both the cluster core @xcite and in the outer halo @xcite .",
    "these two results strongly indicate that system metallicity - not crowding - is the dominant factor determining hj frequencies in this cluster .",
    "this paper presents the results of a dedicated transit search in the second cluster , @xmath0 centauri , in order to test further the dependence of planetary frequency on stellar metallicity and crowding .",
    "omega centauri has only 1/10@xmath26 the core density of 47 tuc yet contains five times the total mass ( 5.1@xmath210@xmath27m@xmath28 , @xcite ) . due to its low stellar density compared to other globular clusters and long stellar interaction timescale , a null result for @xmath0 centauri can be used to test the relative importance of stellar metallicity over density in the formation of giant planets .",
    "omega centauri ( @xmath0 cen , ngc 5139 ) has been subjected to intense research over the years .",
    "the cluster is unique among globular clusters in that it displays a distinct spread of metallicity among its stars @xcite , due to an extended period of star formation and chemical enrichment . using he abundances",
    ", @xcite has shown that the cluster has three distinct stellar populations , with metallicities of @xmath291.7 , @xmath291.2 and @xmath290.6 dex , corresponding to 0.80 , 0.15 and 0.05 of the total population respectively .",
    "the cluster has a highly - bound , retrograde orbit @xcite and is by far the most massive of the globular clusters @xcite .",
    "indeed , these vagaries have led to the theory that the cluster had an external origin , being the left - over remains of a tidally disrupted dwarf galaxy @xcite . with its relative proximity ,",
    "@xmath0 cen presents a statistically significant number of upper main sequence stars that can be searched for transiting hj planets .    here",
    "we present the result from a vigorous search for the transit signatures of large planets on 45,406 lightcurves in a 0.75deg@xmath3 field centered on @xmath0 cen .",
    "the same set of observations yielded a total of 187 variable stars in the field , 81 of which are new discoveries , and are presented in a companion paper @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we observed a control field in the lupus galactic plane to test the data reduction and transit identification strategies .",
    "analysis for this field is ongoing , but has led to the identification of several transit candidates , of which none similar were seen in the @xmath0 cen dataset .",
    "one candidate in particular has excellent prospects for being a new hot jupiter planet @xcite .",
    "section 2 of this paper describes our observational strategy and data reduction details .",
    "section 3 details how the photometry was obtained for both the crowded core regions and outer halo parts of the dataset .",
    "the cluster color magnitude diagram dataset ( along with astrometry ) are also briefly discussed .",
    "section 4 describes the stellar parameters of the cluster stars that were searched for transits , and the expected characteristics of the transits themselves .",
    "the total number of stars in the field ( both in the cluster and the foreground galactic disk ) is also calculated .",
    "section 5 describes the transit detection algorithms used in our search and our removal of systematics in the photometry .",
    "our monte carlo simulations to derive expected recovery of real transits and false alarms are described in section 6 , and their application to estimate our hj sensitivity outlined in section 7 .",
    "the results of our transit search in @xmath0 cen are presented in section 8 , with discussion , comparison to the literature and interpretation in section 9 .",
    "we conclude in section 10 .",
    "our dataset was produced using the australian national university ( anu ) 40-inch ( 1 m ) telescope located at siding spring observatory , fitted with the anu wide field imager ( wfi ) .",
    "this telescope and detector combination permits a 52@xmath1@xmath252@xmath1 ( 0.75 deg@xmath3 ) field of view , which was centered on the cluster core .",
    "wfi is capable of sampling a large fraction of the cluster in a single exposure , as the field extends to 50@xmath9 the cluster tidal radius @xcite , allowing a large time series dataset to be produced with only a single pointing .",
    "the wfi detector consists of a 4@xmath22 array of 2048@xmath24096 pixel back - illuminated ccds in an 8k@xmath28k arrangement .",
    "the pixel scale at the telescope cassegrain focus is 0@xmath30.38 pixel@xmath31 , permitting suitable sampling of the point spread function ( psf ) .    in order to increase the likelihood of transit detection ,",
    "an observing strategy was employed to maximize the temporal resolution of the dataset while keeping the resultant signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) , and hence photometric precision , high . in other words ,",
    "deep images with short exposure times are necessary . in order to do this with a 1 m telescope ,",
    "a special broad - band filter was constructed to cover the combined wavelength range of cousins v and r.    a five minute exposure of a v@xmath518.5 star ( typical of a main sequence star in the cluster ) with this filter has a photon noise s / n of 220 in 7-day moon and 2@xmath30 seeing . in order for a typical hj ( transit depth @xmath60.015 mag ) to be detected at the 3@xmath25 level , an effective s / n of 200 is required , which is thus obtainable with this v+r filter on timescales that would well resolve the expected @xmath62-hour transits . this same telescope and detector combination",
    "was used successfully for a transit search in 47 tucanae , which led to a high significance null result in that cluster @xcite .",
    "the globular cluster @xmath0 centauri was observed for 25 contiguous nights , from 2003 may 2 to 2003 may 27 with a field center ( j2000.0 ) of @xmath32 @xmath5 13@xmath3326@xmath3445.89@xmath35 ,",
    "@xmath36 @xmath5 @xmath2947@xmath3728@xmath136.7@xmath30 ( j2000.0 ) .",
    "an exposure time of 300s was used throughout the observing run with the v+r filter .",
    "each image was checked individually for quality after readout at the telescope .",
    "if an image displayed bad seeing ( @xmath143@xmath30 ) , bad focus or cosmetic problems ( such as satellite trails , intermittent clouds or other adverse effects ) it was discarded . after this quality control , a total of 875 images were obtained over the 25-night run , the dataset having an average temporal resolution of six minutes and covering nine hours on a typical night .    initial image reduction was performed using standard reduction practices with the mscred package of iraf .",
    "this procedure included region trimming , overscan correction , bias correction , flat - fielding and dark current subtraction .",
    "the reduced images were then checked for quality before entering the photometric pipeline .",
    "of the 875 images obtained , 90@xmath9 ( 787 images ) were deemed suitable for use in the production of the time series dataset , as indicated by their small telescope offsets and good seeing .",
    "high precision photometry can be obtained on faint targets in the crowded field of @xmath0 cen by performing differential photometry .",
    "this method was originally described as an optimal point - spread - function ( psf ) matching algorithm by @xcite , and was subsequently modified by @xcite for use in detecting microlensing events .",
    "a detailed description of the difference image analysis ( dia ) method and software pipeline can be found in wozniak s paper ; only the main steps are summarized here .",
    "the process of matching the stellar psf in a large database of images reduces dramatically the systematic effects due to varying atmospheric conditions on the photometric precision , allowing the detection of small brightness variations in faint targets with ground - based observations .",
    "dia is also an excellent photometric method for dealing with crowded fields .",
    "since a larger number of pixels contain information on any psf differences as the number of stars increases , there is an improvement in the psf - matching process .",
    "baseline flux measurements of the stars are made via profile fitting on a master template frame , which is produced by median - combining a large number ( 40@xmath38 in our case ) of the best quality images with small offsets .",
    "this flux measurement is used as the zero - point in the photometric time series for an individual star .",
    "stellar positions are determined from a reference image , usually the image with the best seeing conditions ; and all other images in the dataset ( including the template ) are shifted to match .",
    "the best psf - matching kernel is then found for each image , and each registered image is subtracted from the template .",
    "the residual subtraction image is generally dominated by photon noise .",
    "any object that has changed in brightness between the image and the template is given away as a bright or dark spot .",
    "the pixel coordinates of all visible stars were determined separately on the reference frame via daofind within iraf , and the profile photometry was then extracted from the subtracted frames at those determined positions .",
    "differential photometry produces a time series measured in differential counts , a linear flux unit from which a constant reference flux ( taken from the template ) has been subtracted . to convert this to a standard magnitude system",
    ", the total number of counts for each star was measured using the psf photometry package of daophot within iraf , with the same images and parameters as used in the photometry code .",
    "the time series fluxes were then converted into magnitude units via the relation :    @xmath39 $ ]    where @xmath40 is the total flux of star @xmath41 on the template image and @xmath42 is the difference flux in the time series as produced with the photometric code .    when combining differential fluxes with daophot - derived photometry on the reference image , it is important to correct for errors based on the individual apertures used .",
    "the scaling between the two fluxes was determined via performing an aperture correction on the daophot magnitudes for the cluster stars , as per the method described in appendix b of @xcite .",
    "we found that our psf magnitudes were consistently 0.09 magnitudes brighter than the aperture - derived values ( using the same aperture values as in the differential photometry ) .",
    "we corrected for this by shifting our magnitude zero - point to 25.0@xmath29 0.09 @xmath5 24.91 .",
    "a total of 109,726 stellar photometric time series were produced across the whole wfi field , each containing 787 independent data points , which then became the subject of analysis .",
    "data from each of the four outer ccds of wfi were divided in half for dia analysis , with each half producing an average of 9,500 time series . for the crowded core of the cluster , where the number of stars becomes very large , computational limitations necessitated a different strategy . for the core regions , the images were analysed in 360 individual subframes , 90 per ccd .",
    "the locations of these subframes were chosen so that no stars would be lost at the edges of each individual subframe , and the entire core region of the cluster was covered .",
    "data of sufficient quality could not be obtained in regions affected by telescope offsets during observing ( typically a 160 pixel border surrounding each ccd .",
    "the sysrem systematics removal package of @xcite was applied to all resulting lightcurves .",
    "fig.[rmsplot ] presents the resultant dia - derived photometric precision , measured as root - mean - square scatter ( @xmath43 ) , for the 97,935 stars that were cross - identified with the cluster cmd dataset .",
    "the position of the cluster main sequence turnoff ( msto ) is marked to indicate where the cluster stars become members of the main sequence .",
    "objects to the left of this line are likely red giant branch and foreground galactic disk stars .",
    "the photometric uncertainty is 1@xmath9 at v@xmath517.4 , rising to 4@xmath9 at v@xmath519.0 .",
    "also overlaid on fig.[rmsplot ] is the expected depth of a transit for a 1.5r@xmath20 planet as a function of v magnitude of the parent star .",
    "the total star , background and residual noise contribution is also plotted ( thin locus of red points ) .",
    "the photometry is photon - noise - limited for v@xmath2317.0 and sky+residuals dominated to fainter magnitudes .",
    "we define our lower limit as lying at the magnitude value where all of the stars in our dataset have photometric uncertainty larger than the expected transit depth .",
    "it can be seen on fig.[rmsplot ] that this limit is reached at v@xmath519.5 .      using the same telescope / detector combination , a v , v - i color magnitude diagram ( cmd ) totalling",
    "203,892 stars was produced for the observed field , enabling the detected transiting systems to be placed on the standard v and i magnitude system .",
    "this aids in determining their likely nature .",
    "the total cmd dataset is presented in our variable star companion paper @xcite .",
    "fig.[transcmd ] presents the diagram for the upper main sequence region that was targeted for the transit search .",
    "the photometric errors reported by daophot in both v and v - i are marked as errorbars as a function of v magnitude .    as standard field data was of unacceptable quality , the cmd was calibrated by matching stellar astrometry from our catalog to that of @xcite ( also taken with the anu 40-inch and wfi combination in v and i ) .",
    "the difference in v and i between our uncalibrated data and the @xcite calibrated data was measured for each of the matched stars ( totalling more than 20,000 ) in each ccd independently .",
    "the resulting calibration accuracy is @xmath40.03 magnitudes .",
    "variable stars found in the monitoring data were identified on the cmd by visually identifying the star on the template image and comparing it to the v - band cmd image for the respective ccd .",
    "astrometry was obtained for a total of 212,959 stars identified in the v band image of the cluster and 243,466 stars in the i - band .",
    "a search of the usno ccd astrograph catalog ( ucac1 ) was carried out for astrometric standard stars within the field .",
    "several hundred such stars were successfully identified , producing an accurate determination of the astrometric solution for the stars in each ccd independently ; the resulting calibration accuracy was 0.25@xmath30 .",
    "the extent of our single wfi field of view can be seen in fig.[chips ] , plotted as @xmath44ra and @xmath44dec in degrees from the position of the cluster core . for comparison",
    ", the locations of the cluster core radius ( inner ellipse ) , half - mass radius ( middle ellipse ) , and the location of 50@xmath9 of the cluster tidal radius are also marked overlying the location of the eight wfi ccds .",
    "in order to determine the expected depths and durations of planetary transits ( which are necessary for the monte carlo simulations ) against main sequence cluster stars , the radii of those stars were first calculated as a function of magnitude .",
    "this was done by producing three theoretical @xcite isochrones , each with metallicity and age values for @xmath0 cen as taken from @xcite to simulate the cluster stellar content .",
    "the majority of the stars ( @xmath680@xmath9 ) are expected to lie on the most metal - poor ( [ fe / h]@xmath5@xmath291.7 ) sequence , which was used for our analysis .",
    "these three isochrones and the corresponding parameters can be seen superimposed on fig.[transcmd ] .",
    "table 1 presents the resulting stellar parameters as determined from the isochrone for this metal poor population for stars with v@xmath517.0@xmath4520.0 , namely those stars on the cluster turnoff and upper main sequence .",
    "tabulated are the apparent magnitude , the stellar mass , temperature and luminosity ( in solar units ) , the stellar surface gravity and the corresponding absolute magnitude .",
    "the stellar radius has been calculated from the surface gravity values and is also tabulated .",
    "the stellar radius increases rapidly for cluster stars brighter than the main sequence turnoff ( at v@xmath617.5 ) , hence transit visibility becomes reduced for the brightest stars .    from these calculated radii ,",
    "the expected depths in magnitude units ( dep ) and durations in hours ( dur ) for a transiting planet were found via :    @xmath46    where @xmath47 is the radius of the planet and @xmath48 is the radius of the star , and :",
    "@xmath49    where @xmath50 and @xmath48 are the stellar mass and radius in solar units , and @xmath51 is the orbital period of the planet in days , taken from @xcite .",
    "we assume a period of 3.3d , typical of hj planets found in the solar neighborhood .",
    "the duration value incorporates a @xmath52/4 reduction in transit duration , corresponding to the average chord length across a stellar disk .",
    "a centrally - crossing transit would have a duration 1.28 times longer than the values determined here .",
    "this relation can be used to infer the planetary radius of any detected candidates with a known period and total duration .",
    "the orbital inclination is also determined in that calculation .",
    "the transit depth and duration values as calculated via the yi isochrones are displayed for planets of 1.5@xmath53 in fig.[transcmd ] for various v magnitudes of the cluster main sequence .",
    "also overplotted is the location in brightness at which various photometric precisions can be expected .",
    "the precision becomes comparable to the expected depth of a 1.5@xmath53 planet at v@xmath619.5 .",
    "the expected transit depths are superimposed on fig.[rmsplot ] for all cluster stars .",
    "the line indicates 1.5@xmath53 planet depths and we do not have the photometric accuracy to search for planets smaller than this limit .",
    "the transit depth becomes very small once the stars leave the cluster turnoff ( hence becoming physically larger ) and rapidly become undetectable . for larger planets ,",
    "the transit depth is similar to the photometric uncertainty , as stars are smaller further down the main sequence .",
    "the optimal zone for transit detection is v@xmath517.0@xmath4519.0 , with the limit at v@xmath619.5 , where photometric errors dominate the lightcurve and the transit depth is greater than the photometric uncertainty .",
    "we do not consider the signal - to - noise of the transits in our limit determination , only the magnitude limit for which the per - data point photometric error becomes larger than the expected transit depth .    with this knowledge ,",
    "the total number of stars available for analysis was determined for this planetary radius limit . for 1.5@xmath53 planets ,",
    "45,406 appropriate stars are in our dataset between cluster turnoff and v@xmath519.5 .",
    "however , this number also contains some galactic contamination . from application of a becanson galactic field model @xcite for a wfi field in the direction of @xmath0 cen",
    ", this contamination has been estimated at 31@xmath9 . by accounting for galactic contamination in this magnitude range ,",
    "we arrive at @xmath631,000 cluster stars suitable for a search for large transiting planets .      using the becanson model @xcite",
    ", we can estimate the total number of foreground galactic disk stars in the field ( non cluster members ) that have photometric uncertainty @xmath42@xmath9 . assuming these stars are foreground stars with solar radius or lower , they are suitable for a transit search in their own right .",
    "cluster stars of this brightness correspond to subgiant and red giant branch members , which are unsuitable for the search .",
    "there are an estimated total of 6500 foreground disk stars in the field as determined from the model with @xmath42@xmath9 photometry to a magnitude limit of v@xmath518.2 . of these",
    ", 770 are g type main sequence stars with 160 k and 25 m main sequence stars .",
    "the remainder are of unsuitable luminosity class . by considering the small radius of m - dwarf stars ,",
    "it is possible to extend a search to v@xmath519.5 with sufficient photometric uncertainty to detect a planet with radius approximately equal to jupiter .",
    "this permits a total estimate of @xmath6200 foreground m - dwarfs in the dataset .",
    "although these numbers are insufficient for a statistical transit detection , all stars were nevertheless searched in the course of this work .      before being subjected to the main transit search ,",
    "the time series dataset was filtered for outlying data points and subjected to the systematics removal package of @xcite .",
    "systematics are well known as the source of the vast majority of false transit - like features detected in large datasets , caused by various uncontrollable factors inherent in ground - based photometry ( such as varying airmass and differing weather conditions ) .",
    "indeed , it is clear that removal of systematics is a vital part of any transit search .",
    "the algorithm works without any previous knowledge of the particular systematics that affect the observations , and removes common trends in the data .",
    "the difference of each data point from the mean of the lightcurve is found , and the best linear fit determined .",
    "the slope is then found and the effect subtracted out , assuming the same effect is present in many lightcurves .",
    "the algorithm does not increase the photometric precision ( as seen in fig.[rmsplot ] ) except for the bright stars , whose scatter is dominated by systematics . for these",
    "the photometric precision was increased from 0.01 magnitudes to 0.003 . from experimentation with the transit search algorithms",
    ", we found that the @xcite algorithm reduced the number of detected ` false transits ' in the data by a factor of five , while leaving transit recoverability of true artificially - induced transits unaffected .",
    "the transit search was carried out using two separate transit detection algorithms in tandem , namely the box fitting least - squares ( bls ) method of @xcite and the ws method of @xcite .",
    "the ws and bls codes themselves are described in detail by @xcite and @xcite , respectively , to which we direct the reader for more detailed information . in general , the matched filter approach for transit detection was first suggested by @xcite and has been described as the method of choice for transit searches in the general literature @xcite .",
    "several recent experiments have adopted the method with some success ( ie , @xcite ) .",
    "the ws version of the matched filter method assumes a simple square - well approximation for the transit shape ( a justified assumption when searching for signals near the noise level ) and involves comparison of the data to a large database of suitable transit models ( @xmath610@xmath54 ) with varying period , depth , duration and transit time .",
    "each model is compared to the data via a statistical test ( a cross - correlation - function in the case of @xcite ) and a high significance output determines if a signal has been detected and at which period . by introducing detection criteria the significance of the detection ` @xmath55 ' , as described in @xcite , and the number of output data points above a pre - determined threshold ( n@xmath56 ) , the number of false detections can be minimized while keeping the real recoverability high .",
    "the bls method has also been utilized by many current transit surveys .",
    "the algorithm searches the data for the specific shape of a transit via the least - squares fitting of step - functions to the phase - wrapped data .",
    "this is repeated for a range of trial periods , fractional transit lengths , transit depths and transit epochs .",
    "the deviation of the fit to the data is calculated and the best - fitting combination of these parameters is flagged with a detection significance .",
    "this significance ( sde ) is somewhat dependent on dataset properties but has been generally set at @xmath66@xmath25 in previous applications @xcite .",
    "both algorithms have similar transit recoverability levels as determined via separate monte carlo testing on our data .",
    "the ws code was implemented with strict transit detection criteria , @xmath55@xmath1411 and n@xmath56@xmath1410 , dataset dependent values as described in @xcite that incorporate information about the real noise in the data and the window function .",
    "the bls code , however , produces more accurate periodicity information for candidates , leading to easier identification when phase - wrapping and searching the candidates by eye .",
    "the degree to which the ws and bls codes discriminate between transit - bearing artificial lightcurves and the total real dataset can be seen in fig.[falsedets ] .",
    "the top histogram shows the bls output sde ( @xmath25 ) significance that results from running the algorithm on all dataset stars ( open histogram ) and on only those stars for which an artificial transit has been added via our monte carlo simulations ( shaded histogram ) .",
    "the difference in the mean significance between these two populations is only marginal with a large degree of overlap between the two distributions . hence if bls alone was used on the dataset , most , if not all of the stars , would need to be searched with another method to identify real transit features .",
