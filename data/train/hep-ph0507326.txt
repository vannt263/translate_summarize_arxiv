    "recent years many efforts have been made to understand charmless decays of b mesons , which provide good grounds to get deep insights into the flavor structure of the standard model ( sm ) , the origin of cp violation , the dynamics of hadronic decays , and to search for any signals of new physics beyond the sm .",
    "up to now ,",
    "babar(slac )  @xcite and belle(kek )  @xcite have already accumulated large set of data and have made plenty of exciting measurements . moreover , in the near future lhc - b experiment , the expected number of @xmath4 events produced per year is about @xmath5 , it is noted that 10% of the events would fragment to @xmath6 mesons .",
    "this high statistics will allow studies of rare @xmath7 decay modes , which will provide very sensitive tests of theories for b decays , electro - weak interaction models and so on .    for nonleptonic b",
    "meson decays , the most difficult aspect lies in the computation of matrix elements of the effective four - quark operators between hadron states . to deal with this ,",
    "a simple and widely used approach is the so - called factorization approach(fa )  @xcite . in the past few years , new approaches , such as the qcd factorization(qcdf)@xcite and perturbation qcd ( pqcd ) scheme@xcite have been proposed to improve the fa on qcd grounds .    in the most cases of b meson nonleptonic decays , the annihilation contribution carries weak and strong phases different from that provided by the tree or penguin amplitudes , which is very important for studying cp - violating observables",
    "meanwhile , the calculation of annihilation contributions is interesting by itself , since it can help us to understand the low energy qcd dynamics and the viability of the theoretical approaches .",
    "as argued in  @xcite , the annihilation amplitude is formally power suppressed by order @xmath8 in qcdf .",
    "however , the annihilation contribution may not be small . in a recent systematic calculation of b decays@xcite",
    ", it is shown that the annihilation contributions could cause considerable uncertainties in their theoretical predictions , where the contributions are parameterized in term of the divergent integral @xmath9 . in this paper , we argue that the strength of annihilation could be probed by measuring the interesting decay mode @xmath10 , which is a pure annihilation process . in our calculation of the scattering kernel , we will use cornwall@xcite prescription of gluon propagator with a dynamical mass to avoid enhancements in the soft end point .",
    "it is very interesting to note that recent theoretical@xcite and phenomenological@xcite studies are now accumulating supports for softer infrared behavior for gluon propagator . besides serving a probe for the annihilation",
    ", the decay has some interesting features : sizable cp violation due to both tree and penguin operators contributing , clear experimental signatures due to its two charge final states .",
    "moreover , if few percentage of final pions are mis - identified to be muons , it would bring considerable uncertainties to the measurement of @xmath11 at lhcb .",
    "therefor , the decay deserves our theoretical studies using different approaches .",
    "we have found that the cp averaged branching ratio of @xmath12 decay is about @xmath13 , the direct cp asymmetry @xmath2 is about -0.05 , while the mixing - induced cp asymmetry is as large as @xmath3=0.18 .",
    "our results might be tested in the near future at lhcb .",
    "the remaining parts of this paper are organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we outline the necessary ingredients of the qcd factorization approach for describing the @xmath14 decay and calculate the decay amplitude . in section 3 , we give the numerical results of the cp averaged branching ratio and discuss cp asymmetries in @xmath14 decay .",
    "we will start as usual from the effective hamiltonian for the @xmath16 transitions given by  @xcite @xmath17 -v_{tb}v_{ts}^*\\sum\\limits_{i=3}^{10}c_{i}(\\mu)o_{i}(\\mu)\\}+h.c,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 are wilson coefficients at the renormalization scale @xmath19 in the standard model by integrating out heavy gauge bosons and top quark fields .",
    "@xmath20 are tree operations arising from w - boson exchange and @xmath21 are penguin operators .",
    "the values for @xmath22 and the definition of operators @xmath23 could be found in @xcite .",
    "we list the parameters used in our numerical calculation  @xcite @xmath49 we set the scale in @xmath50 to be @xmath51 which is about the averaged virtuality of the time - like gluon . in eq.[am1 ] , [ am2 ] we meet endpoint divergences , which is the known difficulty to deal with the annihilation diagram within qcd factorization framework . instead of the widely used treatment @xmath52 in the literature@xcite , we use an effective gluon propagator  @xcite to avoid enhancements in the soft end point region @xmath53^{-\\frac{12}{11}}.\\ ] ] typically @xmath54 mev , @xmath55=250 mev .",
    "the use of this gluon propagator is supported by lattice result  @xcite , and field theoretical studies  @xcite which have shown that the gluon propagator is not divergent as fast as @xmath56 .    for twist-3 da @xmath41 ,",
    "its asymptotic form is @xmath57 @xcite which used in @xcite . to further suppress endpoint contributions",
    ", we will use the recent model by huang and wu@xcite @xmath58 \\exp\\left[-\\frac{m^2}{8\\beta^2 x(1-x)}\\right],\\ ] ] where @xmath59 and @xmath60 are gegenbauer polynomials and other parameters could be found in @xcite .    using these inputs ,",
    "we get the cp averaged branching ratio of the decay @xmath61 the available upper limit of the decay at 90% confidence level  @xcite is @xmath62 obviously , our result is far below this upper limit . however , our result is larger than these qcd factorization result @xmath63 @xcite by using the treatment @xmath64 .",
    "we also note that our result may consistent with the one of ref.@xcite @xmath65 if the huge uncertainties are considered . in a recent study in the framework of pqcd factorization@xcite ,",
    "the authors found @xmath66 where the end point divergence is regulated by @xmath67 .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     the absolute ratio between the amplitude of penguin and the tree is @xmath68 , and the strong phase is @xmath69 .",
    "so , we can see that almost all the contribution comes from penguin .",
    "our results for z and @xmath47 agree with the pqcd results@xcite .",
    "now it is time to discuss cp asymmetries of @xmath70 .",
    "the time - dependent asymmetries are given by@xcite @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the mass difference of the two mass eigenstates of @xmath6 meson .",
    "@xmath2 and @xmath3 are parameters describing the direct cp violation and the mixing - induced cp violation , respectively .    finally , our results for direct and mixing - induced cp violations in the decay are presented as functions of weak phase @xmath73 in fig.2.a , b respectively . for @xmath74@xcite ,",
    "the direct cp violation parameter @xmath2 is about -0.05 , the mixing - induced cp violation parameter @xmath75 of the decay is as large as 0.18 .    in summary , we have calculated the cp averaged branching ratio and cp asymmetries of the decay @xmath14 within the framework of qcd factorization .",
    "we have obtained that the cp averaged branching ratio of this decay mode is of the order of @xmath76 .",
    "the cp violations are estimated to be @xmath77 , @xmath78 .",
    "compared with former studies in the same framework , we have included both the two distribution functions @xmath79 and @xmath80 of @xmath7 meson .",
    "we also have used cornwall prescription@xcite for the gluon propagator with a dynamical mass to avoid enhancements in soft endpoint region .",
    "it is noted that recent studies@xcite have given support for cornwall prescription , which might have many phenomenological applications in b decays . once future measurements at lhcb in agreement with our predictions",
    ", it would indicate that cornwall prescription could be used in qcdf to improve it s treatment of endpoint divergences in hard - spectator scattering and annihilation topologies to enhance its power for analyzing charmless b nonleptonic decays .",
