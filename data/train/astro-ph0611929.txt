    "white dwarfs ( wds ) represent the endpoint of stellar evolution for the majority of stars . as such ,",
    "wds present an opportunity to study stellar populations long after stellar evolution is complete .",
    "wds in star clusters are especially useful due to their residence in a co - eval , single - metallicity population , allowing determination of their progenitor masses .",
    "studies of wds in open star clusters are often used to address the relation between a star s main - sequence mass and that of its wd remnant ( the initial - final mass relation , or ifmr ) .",
    "the ifmr represents the integrated mass lost by a star over its entire evolution .",
    "an understanding of this relation is necessary for understanding chemical enrichment and star formation efficiency in galaxies @xcite and for understanding the origin and evolution of hot gas in giant elliptical galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the ifmr also plays a vital role in the study of the field wd luminosity function ( wdlf ) , as the wdlf represents a convolution of the ifmr with the star formation history of a stellar population .",
    "the wdlf is one of the primary means to determine the age of the galactic thin disk ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and interest is building in attempts to determine the age of the thick disk and the halo via similar methods ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the first observational work on wds in open star clusters was presented by @xcite , followed closely by @xcite .",
    "both used photographic plates to search for overdensities of faint blue objects in intermediate - age open clusters ( ages @xmath2 myr to @xmath3 gyr ) .",
    "this work was followed by a series of papers by koester & reimers , who presented follow - up spectroscopy of many of these and other photographic wd candidates .",
    "the addition of spectroscopy is crucial .",
    "first , it allows the unambiguous identification of the bona - fide wds in the samples . in the photometric surveys , candidate wds",
    "have been identified spectroscopically as hot horizontal - branch , main - sequence or subdwarf stars , and qsos .",
    "second , high quality spectra of the wds allow the physical properties of the wds to be determined . by fitting synthetic spectra to the observed spectra , the effective temperature ( @xmath4 ) and surface gravity ( @xmath5 ) of each wd is determined .",
    "using wd evolutionary models , these quantities can be converted into a wd mass ( @xmath6 ) and cooling time ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "subtraction of @xmath7  from a cluster s age results in the total age of the progenitor star . from stellar evolutionary models ,",
    "the progenitor mass is thereby determined .",
    "uses data achieved via this method along with theoretical stellar evolutionary models to derive a semi - empirical ifmr .",

    "the first such study is that of @xcite , who use proper motions and digital photometry to locate wds in the core of praesepe , which are then followed up with spectroscopy at large - aperture telescopes .    we have undertaken a similar approach to detecting and analyzing wds in intermediate - age open clusters , with initial results presented in @xcite .",
    "the first results of our study , now tagged with the somewhat clumsy and outdated ( but iau - approved ) appellation `` lick - arizona white dwarf survey ( lawds ) , '' were seven massive wds in the open cluster ( m35 ) @xcite .",
    "at least two other groups are conducting concurrent open cluster wd studies .",
    "@xcite present analysis of wds in the open cluster ( m37 ) and are continuing this work in other older open clusters ( j.  kalirai 2006 , personal communication ) .",
    "in addition , @xcite have analyzed several wds in praesepe not included in the @xcite study .",
    "in addition to leading to a more defined ifmr , the recent cluster observations have revealed the somewhat surprising possibility that the ratio of hydrogen - atmosphere wds ( spectral class da ) to helium - atmosphere wds ( the non - da spectral classes ) may differ between the field and cluster wd populations .",
    "this effect was noted by , and was more recently explored by @xcite .",
    "we note in @xcite that some of the apparent discrepancy may be due to the known temperature dependence of the da : non - da ratio , though there is still a possible deficiency of non - da wds in clusters as compared to the field .",
    "it is therefore important to analyze carefully any non - da spectral type wds in open cluster fields .    in this paper",

    "these images were taken as part of the cfht open star cluster survey @xcite using the cfh12k mosaic camera on ut 1999 october 16 .",
    "we reduced the data using the iraf external package cfh12k , an extension to the mscred mosaic reduction package .",
    "the twilight flat fields obtained on the night of observation were not useful due to high stellar densities , so twilight flat field images from subsequent nights were retrieved from the archive and used to construct flat fields .",
    "the data were bias - subtracted , trimmed , flat - fielded , and resampled to a common pixel scale and coordinate grid , the basic algorithm suggested by @xcite . due to the large number of bad columns in ccd05 of cfh12k ,",

    "this areal coverage issue has been found to be the likely cause of the apparent deficit of wds in praesepe @xcite .      if we assume that both candidate cluster da wds are indeed members of their respective clusters , we can place these two objects on the empirical ifmr . in figure [ fig.ifmr ] , we plot these two points along with the data collected by @xcite . ngc 6633:lawds 27 is seen to fall on the @xcite relation , while ngc 7063:lawds 1 falls well off the relation .",
    "this can be readily explained if ngc 7063:lawds 1 is the product of binary evolution ( see  [ sec.n7063wb6 ] ) or not a true cluster member .",
    "ngc 6633 has a lower metallicity than the hyades and praesepe , yet the ngc 6633 wd occupies the same region of the initial - final mass relation as the wds in the hyades and praesepe .",
    "this suggests that metallicity , at least over this small metallicity range , has little impact on the wd mass , though the observational scatter is still quite large and can easily swamp a small signal .",
    "at least three wds in this sample show potential k absorption : ngc 6633:lawds 8 ( ew@xmath219  ) , ngc 6633:lawds 15 ( ew@xmath220 ) , and ngc 6633:lawds 27 ( ew=@xmath221 ) .",
    "while these features could be interstellar in nature , the other wds in the cluster field at similar or greater distances have no discernible absorption .",
    "@xcite determine that @xmath1 of da wds show k absorption , if the spectra are of high enough s / n and sufficiently high resolution . our detection of in 3 of 11 da wds is fully consistent with that number .",
    "we therefore classify these three objects as spectral type daz .",
    "the origin of the metals in daz wds remains controversial , with explanations including accretion from the interstellar medium , cometary impacts @xcite , and accretion of asteroidal material @xcite .",
    "however , recent data from the spitzer space telescope and the irtf reveal that several dazs with high @xmath222 $ ] have circumstellar debris disks @xcite .",
    "two of these dazs , ngc 6633:lawds 8 and ngc 6633:lawds 27 , have @xmath4  in the range where a debris disk may be detected .",
    "we have obtained photometric and spectroscopic data for white dwarfs ( wds ) in two sparse open clusters , ngc 6633 and ngc 7063 . for the open cluster ngc 6633 , we determine a main - sequence turnoff age of @xmath60 myr .",
    "we select 32 candidate wds based on   photometry .",
    "spectroscopic follow - up of 22 of these candidates finds 9 of these to be wds , 7 with spectral types da or daz and 2 of spectral type db .",
    "one da and one db have distance moduli consistent with cluster membership .",
    "two other das are @xmath223 mag over - luminous for cluster member wds ; these are potential double - degenerate cluster wds which , if truly binary , would each have combined masses above the chandrasekhar mass .",
    "the ngc 6633 db wd is the third known cluster wd with a he - dominated atmosphere .    for the open cluster ngc 7063",
    ", we estimate a main - sequence age of @xmath224 myr , assuming solar metallicity . using @xmath13photometry , we identify nine candidate wds .",
    "spectroscopy of 7 candidates confirms 5 wds , though only one is consistent with cluster membership .",
    "this wd has a mass of 0.37@xmath173 , and so is likely a he - core wd resulting from binary evolution of two massive stars , with the wd s progenitor mass @xmath225 .",

    "most of the points in the initial - final mass relation in the region occupied by the ngc 6633 wd(s ) are from the super - solar metallicity open clusters praesepe and the hyades , so the agreement of the sub - solar metallicity ngc 6633 wd(s ) with these points suggests little metallicity dependence in the initial - final mass relation over this metallicity range .",
    "three of our 11 da wds show absorption lines and are therefore classified as spectral type daz .",
    "the ratio of dazs to das is consistent with other published studies indicating that @xmath1 of hydrogen - atmosphere wds are dazs .",
    "one open issue is the membership of the reported cluster wds .",
    "while the observed distance modulus is an important diagnostic , we can not rule out that the cluster wds are interlopers from the field .",
    "an independent method of determining cluster membership , such as proper motion measurements for these wds , would greatly assist in this regard .",
