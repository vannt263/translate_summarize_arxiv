    "the macroscopic energy of weakly anisotropic ferromagnets which first appeared in the seminal paper by landau and lifshitz @xcite , has been an instrument for innumerable investigations of domain walls and other inhomogeneous states of magnetic systems .",
    "later an approach based on this macroscopic energy has been called `` micromagnetics '' @xcite . strictly speaking ,",
    "micromagnetics is an essentially zero - temperature theory for _ classical _ magnets , as it considers the magnetization as a vector of fixed length . under these conditions ,",
    "it can be easily obtained as a continuous limit of the classical hamiltonian on a lattice .",
    "practically , micromagnetics has been applied to nonzero temperatures as well , with temperature - dependent equilibrium magnetization and anisotropy constants .    on the other hand ,",
    "close to the curie temperature @xmath0 a magnetic free energy of the landau type can be considered .",
    "this free energy allows the magnetization to change both in direction and length , and it is , in fact , a continuous limit of the free energy following from the mean - field approximation ( mfa ) . using this approach , bulaevskii and",
    "ginzburg @xcite predicted a phase transition between the bloch walls and the ising - like walls at temperatures slightly below @xmath0 .",
    "much later this phase transition was observed experimentally @xcite using the theoretical results for the mobility of domain walls in this regime @xcite .",
    "although both of these approaches have been formulated at the same mean - field level , they have been considered as unrelated for a long time . on the other hand ,",
    "the mfa itself is an all - temperature approximation , and thus one can question its macroscopic limit in the whole temperature range .",
    "the corresponding macroscopic free energy should interpolate between the landau - lifshitz energy , or micromagnetics at @xmath3 and the landau free energy in the vicinity of @xmath0 .",
    "the euler equation for the magnetization which minimizes this generalized free energy appears in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite .",
    "whereas the condition for the landau theory is @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the saturation magnetization at @xmath3 , the new equations only require @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the equilibrium magnetization at zero field . for weakly anisotropic magnets ( the anisotropy energy is much less than the homogeneous exchange energy , and this is satisfied by most compounds ) the magnetization magnitude @xmath8 is either small or only slightly deviates from @xmath7 , thus the condition above is satisfied in the whole temperature range .",
    "derivation of the generalized macroscopic free energy from the mfa is much subtler than that of the euler equations .",
    "this free energy appears in ref .",
    "@xcite where its form was guessed . in this paper",
    ", we will present this derivation and illustrate the resulting magnetic free energy in the case of a single - domain magnetic particle with a uniaxial anisotropy . for the sake of transparency",
    ", we will consider the exchange anisotropy rather than the single - site anisotropy ; this does not change the qualitative results .",
    "it will be shown that the free - energy landscape for the magnetic particle has different forms at low temperatures and near @xmath0 . at low temperatures ,",
    "the saddle point between the `` up '' and `` down '' minima is located near the sphere @xmath9 , the value of @xmath8 being somewhat reduced in comparison with @xmath7 due to thermal effects at @xmath10 . near @xmath0 , the value of @xmath8 strongly changes by going from one minimum to another through the saddle point ; for zero fields the saddle point becomes @xmath11 .",
