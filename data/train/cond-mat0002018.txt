    "the samples we chose for the xafs studies were : as - deposited at 750  k , annealed at 1000  k and annealed at 1200  k. the annealed samples were held at their respective temperatures for 10 hours in flowing oxygen , and were heated and cooled at 2  k per minute .    the xafs experiments were done on beamline 10 - 2 at ssrl using si @xmath9220@xmath10 monochromator crystals and a 13-element ge detector to collect mn @xmath11 fluorescence data .",

    "the saturated magnetization of the samples increases with annealing temperature .",
    "this indicates that at higher annealing temperature , a larger fraction of the sample becomes ferromagnetic in the fm phase at low temperature .",
    "our previous experiments show that the 30% ca doped lcmo powder sample has a curie temperature of @xmath12 260  k@xcite , which is very close to the t@xmath5 of the fully annealed thin film sample .",

    "the biggest change in mr occurs at the lowest measuring temperature ( 70  k ) .",
    "it should also be noted that the peak in resistivity is very close to t@xmath5 for the 1200  k annealed sample , but well below t@xmath5 ( over 10  k difference ) for the 1000  k annealed sample .",

    "[ mr ] . as mentioned earlier , our thin film samples are deposited on srtio@xmath3 ( sto ) substrates . when the sample is deposited on sto",

    "this sr diffusion could produce a resistance peak at a lower temperature and may be responsible for this extra peak .",
    "we chose to use sto substrates instead of laalo@xmath3 ( lao ) substrates , which have no diffusion problem , because the large la @xmath19-edge xafs from the substrate would interfere with our mn k edge xafs data .",
    "our xafs data are sensitive to this sr diffusion layer only if we focus on the further neighbors such as mn - la , mn - ca and mn - sr",
    ". the mn - o bond distance does not change much between ca and sr substitution .",
    "consequently for the mn - o pair distribution function which is the focus of this paper , we are not very sensitive to sr in the lower 10% of the film .",
    "we collected all mn-@xmath0 edge data in fluorescence mode .",
    "first the pre - edge absorption ( absorptions from other edges ) was removed using the victoreen formula .",
    "next we extract k@xmath20(k ) where the photoelectron wave vector k is obtained from k=@xmath21 and the xafs function @xmath20(k ) is defined as @xmath20(k)=@xmath22(k)/@xmath23(k)-1 .",
    "we fit a 7-knot spline to @xmath22(k ) ( the @xmath0-edge absorption data above the edge ) to obtain the background function @xmath23(k ) ( embedded atom function ) .",
    "an example of such data is shown in fig .",
    "[ kspace ] .",
    "next we obtain the r - space data from the fourier transform ( ft ) of k@xmath20(k ) ; fits to the data were carried out in r - space@xcite .",

    "the width , @xmath26 , of the pair distribution function is a measure of the local distortions in a shell of neighboring atoms . in xafs",
    ", a large @xmath26 leads to a decrease in the amplitude of the @xmath24-space peak .",
    "we obtain some results from these data without having to resort to curve fitting .",
    "first , the amplitude of the mn - o peak ( the first peak ) decreases with increasing temperature .",
    "that means there are increasing distortions in each sample with increasing temperature .",
    "second , for the higher annealing temperature , the amplitude at low temperature increases and the change of the amplitude with temperature for the mn - o peak is larger than that for the other samples . the amount of distortion removed at low temperature is smaller for the 1000  k annealed sample ,",
    "while most of the distortion in the as - deposited sample is still present at @xmath27 = 20  k. the amplitude of the r - space data at high temperature ( 310  k ) is almost the same for all three samples ; this suggests that the amount of distortion at high temperatures does nt change very much with the annealing temperature ; however it is still clearly less than the local distortion observed previously in lamno@xmath3 at 300  k@xcite .",
    "our r - space data were fit using a gaussian pair distribution function for the mn - o , mn - ca / la and mn - mn shells . the pair - distribution width , @xmath26(t ) , ( for mn - o ) was determined from these detailed fits to the data , which were carried out using feff6 theoretical functions@xcite ( see fig . [ s2 ] ) . in the fit , s@xmath28n was fixed at 4.3 , where n is the number of nearest neighbors ( 6 o neighbors ) , and s@xmath28 is an amplitude reduction factor .",
    "k@xmath20(k ) arrives from single - electron process and is normalized to the step height ; s@xmath28 corrects for the fact that the measured step height also includes multi - electron process .",
    "there is an absolute uncertainty in s@xmath28 of roughly 10% , however small changes in s@xmath28 move all the curves up or down in fig .",
    "[ s2 ] and do not change the shape or relative position .",
    "the values of @xmath29 obtained from the fits provide a measure of the distortion of the mn - o bond .",
    "different contributions to the broadening add in quadrature and hence @xmath29 has the general form :    @xmath30    at low temperature , @xmath29 is dominated by zero - point motion and some static distortions .",
    "for all the manganites , the smallest value for @xmath26 is about 0.04  ; consequently small variations in bond lengths , such as occurring for camno@xmath3 are not directly observed in @xmath26 .",
    "it is surprising that the net distortion of the substituted cmr samples is about as small as that observed for the more ordered camno@xmath3 structure at 20  k.    for each temperature 4 traces are analyzed and averaged .",
    "the relative errors shown in fig .",
    "[ s2 ] are the root mean square ( rms ) variation of the fit result at each temperature . for the as - deposited sample",
    ", @xmath29 has a very small change with decreasing temperature ; there is a larger change for the 1000  k annealed sample , and an even larger temperature dependence for the 1200  k annealed sample .",
    "we also find in fig .",
    "[ s2 ] that , at 320  k , @xmath29 increases as the annealing temperature is lowered .",
    "this indicates that some of the static defects in the as - deposited sample can be removed during the annealing process .    the solid line in fig .",
    "[ s2 ] corresponds to the data for the mn - o bond in camno@xmath3 , which has a high debye temperature ( 950  k ) ; @xmath29 for this sample will be denoted @xmath31 ( the camno@xmath3 data we use in this figure are obtained from a powder sample@xcite .",
    "there might be a difference up to 10% between powder samples and thin film samples since they are in different form and this difference may change the effective value of s@xmath28 for the fit process . )",
    "the difference between @xmath32 and @xmath33 at low temperature is due to a static distortion @xmath34 , which is defined as :    @xmath35    to estimate this quantity , we shift the solid line vertically until it fits the low temperature data for the 1200  k annealed sample this yields the dashed line in fig . [",
    "s2 ] , which is defined to be @xmath33 + @xmath34 .",
    "although @xmath34 is almost zero for the 1200  k annealed sample , it is large for the other samples .",
    "we include it here for the 1200  k annealed sample to clarify its definition .",
    "the contribution to @xmath32 above the dashed line is attributed to a polaron distortion , where the full ( maximum ) polaron distortion , @xmath36 , is defined by :    @xmath37    we have found in previous work@xcite that a useful parameter is the distortion removed as t drops below t@xmath5 , @xmath38 , which we define below .",
    "first , the @xmath33 curve is shifted vertically ( by an amount @xmath36 + @xmath34 ) such that it fits the high temperature data .",
    "this yields the dotted line shown in fig .",
    "[ s2 ] which is @xmath33 + @xmath34 + @xmath36 .",
    "this dotted line represents the expected debye behavior plus static distortion if no polaron distortion were removed upon cooling .",
    "we define @xmath38 as the difference between the dotted line and the data :    @xmath39 a similar analysis is carried out for the as deposited sample and the 1000  k annealed sample ( corresponding curves for @xmath31 + @xmath40 and @xmath31 + @xmath40 + @xmath41 are not shown in fig .",
    "it is also important to point out that the difference between @xmath29 for the 1200  k annealed sample and that of camno@xmath3 at 20  k is very small , which suggests that the mn - o local structure of the fully annealed sample can be as ordered as that of camno@xmath3 even though it is a doped sample .",
    "the same result was obtained for la@xmath42ca@xmath43mno@xmath3 cmr powder samples ( x = 0.2@xmath120.5 ) from our previous experiments@xcite .",
    "the reason for this phenomena for the thin films can be explained as follows : first , the high temperature annealing process appears to remove most of the static defects such as dislocations and vacancies ; second , at very low temperatures , there is almost no difference between the two type of mn sites in the de model , the electron moves rapidly from one site to another on a time scale fast compared to the appropriate phonon frequency .",
    "consequently , jahn - teller distortions do nt have time to form .    for the as - deposited sample ,",
    "the large cmr% occurs when there is a large value for @xmath29 at low temperature ; this suggests that the distortion in the sample may , in part , be the origin of the unusually large magnetoresistance in thin - film samples .",
    "we have recently observed similar results in our study of ti and ga doped lcmo powder samples@xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ lns2 ] , we plot @xmath44 _ vs _ @xmath45 .",
    "our previous studies of la@xmath42ca@xmath43mno@xmath3 powder samples showed that there is a linear relationship between @xmath44 and the magnetization@xcite , which provides evidence that there is a strong connection between the local distortion and magnetism in these materials .",
    "the solid squares in fig .",
    "[ lns2 ] show the linear relationship for a la@xmath46ca@xmath47mno@xmath3 powder sample from our previous work@xcite .",
    "for the thin film samples , there is a similar connection between local distortion and magnetization .",
    "for the 1000  k and 1200  k annealed samples , we find a small deviation from a straight line below m / m@xmath6 @xmath120.3 . since the error of the data in this range ( m / m@xmath6 @xmath9 0.3 ) is large , it is not clear if this is a real effect or not .",
    "the data for the as - deposited sample appear to follow a straight line , but the errors in the difference are too large to draw conclusions . also , we find that the data for the 1200  k annealed thin - film and the powder sample ( both la@xmath46ca@xmath47mno@xmath3 ) almost overlap each other .",
    "this suggests that the local structure of the fully annealed thin - film behaves similarly to that of the corresponding bulk sample .    in order to see the effect of annealing temperature on the local distortion more clearly , we plot the distortion contributions , @xmath40 and @xmath41 , as a function of annealing temperature in fig . [ disorder ]",
    "this figure shows that the static distortion decreases with annealing temperature , while the polaron contribution increases with annealing temperature .",
    "this suggests that part of the static distortions observed in the as - deposited sample become dynamic , polaron - like , distortions after annealing , for t @xmath10 t@xmath5 .",
    "it should be noted that although the magnetization only drops by roughly 50% for the as - deposited sample , the @xmath41 contribution becomes much smaller ( of order 5% ) .",
    "consequently , there must be statically distorted regions in the as - deposited sample that are also ferromagnetic .",
    "the reduction of the saturated magnetization can arise in several ways .",
    "first , because of the inhomogeneous material , small regions may be antiferromagnetic ( af ) .",
    "second , it has been suggested that the crystal field , particularly in regimes where the inhomogeneity causes a local reduction of the tolerance factor , can result in a low spin mn ( @xmath48t@xmath49 ) configuration with a local 50% decrease in mn moment@xcite .",
    "third , the spins in a small domain may not be exactly parallel .",
    "however , to explain the entire decrease in saturated magnetization would require very large canting angles .",
    "fourth , the magnetization vectors of each domain may not be aligned .",
    "the number of domain - walls may be important for calculating the resistivity .",
    "however , for domains large compared to a unit cell , slightly canted spins within a domain or a lack of alignment of the magnetization of various domains would not lead to a significant decrease in the polaron contribution to the broadening in xafs .",
    "consequently , the presence of static distortions but essentially no polaron - like contributions in the as - deposited material indicate both a significant fraction of af material , and the presence of some low spin mn sites , possibly induced by the disorder ( interstitials , vacancies , inhomogeneous ca concentrations etc . ) .",
    "this disorder must pin the local distortions which would also suppress the electron hopping frequency , thereby reducing the effectiveness of the de interaction .",
    "all three thin film samples were prepared in the same way , except for the annealing temperature . during the annealing process , part of the static defects in the sample such as vacancies and interstitials can be removed .",
    "in addition , the annealing process can also change the amount of oxygen in the sample@xcite .",
    "the sample is slightly oxygen deficient before the annealing process , and oxygen is incorporated during annealing .",
    "the fully annealed sample ( 1200  k ) is expected to be fully stoichiometric ( similar to the corresponding powder sample ) .",
    "it is well documented that samples without sufficient oxygen can have higher resistivities , a lower resistance peak temperature , a lower t@xmath5 and a lower saturated magnetization@xcite .",
    "we have the same trends in our experiments .",
    "compared to the 1200  k annealed sample , the samples annealed at lower temperatures have a large decrease in @xmath36 and a large increase in resistivity , while the saturated magnetization changes by less than a factor of two .",
    "this suggests that much of the distorted magnetic regions probably do not contribute to the conductivity and that the fraction of conducting material is very low for the as - deposited sample .",
    "however , the six order of magnitude increase in resistivity is much larger than the volume reduction of the regions that still have a polaron - like distortion .",
    "consequently , it is likely that percolation also plays a role for transport in the as - deposited sample .",
    "then the magnetic field may play two roles for this sample ; it will decrease the resistivity for the conducting pathways that exist at b=0 and may also make some `` marginal '' pathways become conducting .",
    "from our analysis , we find that the annealing temperature of the thin films affects the local distortion of the materials appreciably .",
    "the large change in resistivity and the small change in local structure with temperature for the as - deposited sample suggest that only small regions are contributing to the resistivity and percolation may play a role .",
    "we also find that there is still a strong connection between local distortions , resistivity and magnetism in the fully annealed thin - film materials , which behaves much like a powder sample .",
    "for the 1000  k annealed sample , the resistivity and mr peaks are well below t@xmath5 . in this case",
    "( including the as - deposited sample ) , the local distortions correlate well with the magnetization , but there is no feature in @xmath26 that occurs at the temperature at which the resistivity has a peak ."
