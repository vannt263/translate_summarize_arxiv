    "the metallicity of hii  regions in small isolated dwarf galaxies is key to investigating the physical processes that govern star formation in undisturbed stellar systems .",
    "the small isolated gas rich irregular dwarf galaxy ( sigrid ) sample of small isolated gas rich irregular dwarf galaxies @xcite was selected with the aim of exploring the behavior of the mass or luminosity  metallicity relation at the low end of the mass scale .",
    "this is based on the observation that nebular metallicity decreases with galaxy stellar mass / luminosity ( see , for example , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , the low end of the mass scale shows significantly more scatter in metallicity than the high end in the tremonti sdss data . by selecting isolated dwarf galaxies",
    ", it was our intention to see if this scatter persisted , and whether it was an intrinsic property of small galaxies .",
    "the sigrid study is complementary to the `` choirs '' study which looks for tidal dwarf emission line galaxies in group environments @xcite .",
    "it is distinct from the spitzer local volume legacy survey used by @xcite and the sdss data of @xcite in using targets specifically chosen for their isolation .",
    "it is most similar in concept to the study by @xcite of galaxies in the lynx - cancer void , but is limited to small very isolated dwarf objects .",
    "other questions that the sigrid observations are intended to address are the existence or otherwise of a primary nitrogen `` plateau '' at metallicities below z=8.45 @xcite , and the relationship between oxygen abundances determined using `` direct method '' , based on the measurement of the electron temperature and the estimation of the ionization correction factors to account for unseen ionization stages , and `` strong line '' technique , based on a calibration of the bright emission lines and emission line ratios .",
    "there has not been good agreement to date between the two methods , attributed to the empirical nature of the strong line methods .",
    "they have been calibrated in terms of the direct method , and have not until recently had an analytical basis .",
    "the direct method has been used as a standard for temperature and metallicity measurement , against which the strong line methods have been calibrated .",
    "@xcite subsequently presented a set of strong line diagnostic grids derived from the mappings photoionization modelling code , based on the latest atomic data ( see * ? ? ?",
    "we use both the new atomic data and the new diagnostic grids in our analysis .",
    "one might expect there to be greater scatter in the mass  metallicity relation at low masses , due to ( 1 ) measurement noise in nebular spectra in fainter galaxies , and ( 2 ) different star formation histories in the galaxies .",
    "@xcite suggest that the apparent scatter diminishes in observations at longer wavelengths ( 4.5@xmath7 m ) , and we present additional optical spectral evidence on this question .",
    "the behavior of the ratio of nitrogen to oxygen abundances at low metallicities also shows increased scatter at lower metallicity .",
    "the current consensus appears to be that there is a low metallicity plateau in log(n / o ) , indicating the existence of primary nitrogen ( see , for example , * ? ? ?",

    "however , these previous works were not confined to small isolated dwarf galaxies .",
    "results in our earlier paper on two isolated local void dwarf galaxies @xcite , indicated that log(n / o ) did not plateau at low metallicity , suggesting no evidence for primary nitrogen . in this paper",
    "we present additional evidence for this .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in section 2 we detail the sample selection , the spectroscopic observations , and the data reduction details .",

    "we present the principal results of the analyses : electron temperatures , gas - phase nebular metallicities with the diagnostic grids , the nitrogen to oxygen flux ratios , the [ s ii ] line ratios and electron densities , and the luminosity ",
    "metallicity results . in section 5",
    "we discuss these results , including the anomalies , and in section 6 we present our conclusions .",
    "a discussion of methods used to estimate errors in the emission line fluxes is given in the appendix .",
    "the sigrid sample was selected to identify small isolated gas - rich irregular dwarf galaxies using the criteria described in @xcite .",
    "all objects are members of the survey for ionization in neutral gas galaxies ( singg ) catalog @xcite , selected from their hi  signatures in the hi parkes all - sky survey ( hipass ) @xcite and the presence of h@xmath8 emission from star forming regions . from this sample",
    "we have , to date , observed 34 objects using ifu optical spectroscopy , as detailed below . from these observations we report here on 12 galaxies where the [ o  iii ] auroral line is evident , allowing us to calculate the electron temperature t@xmath0 , and the gas - phase oxygen abundance ; and an additional galaxy , j1118 - 17 , with an unusual spectrum with no observed [ n  ii ] lines . in four objects , two separate hii  regions",
    "were observed which exhibited the auroral line , resulting in 18 separate hii  region observations .",
    "three objects ( j1152 - 02 , j1225 - 06 , j1328 + 02 ) are not members of the final sigrid sample , but had been observed during the refining of that sample .",
    "they were later excluded due to possible influence by regional galaxy groups and clusters , although they are clearly isolated objects , as evidenced by their isolation @xmath9 index values @xcite .",
    "five objects qualify as blue compact dwarf ( bcd ) galaxies , using the definition by @xcite and discussed by @xcite , though they have not previously been identified as such .",
    "the targets were observed using the wifes ifu spectrograph on the australian national university ( anu ) 2.3 m telescope at siding spring .",
    "the wifes instrument is a double - beam image - slicing ifs , designed specifically to maximise throughput .",
    "it covers the spectral range 35009000 , at resolutions of 3000 ( full spectral range ) and 7000 ( long wavelength limit 7000 ) .",
    "it has a science field of view ( fov ) of 25@xmath1038 arc sec .",
    "as most of the sigrid objects subtend angles less than its fov , wifes is an ideal instrument to measure nebular metallicities in the ionized hydrogen star - forming regions .",
    "the instrument generates a data cube that allows exploration of nebular and continuum spectra in different regions of the target objects .",
    "typically , even in poor seeing wifes resolves sigrid object star formation regions easily , making possible exploration of excitation and abundances in different regions of each object . in these observations ,",
    "resolutions used were r=3000 for the blue camera and r=7000 for the red , spanning a usable wavelength range of @xmath43600 to 7000  .",
    "short period ( 150 second on object , 75 second on sky ) nod - and - shuffle observations were used for all objects , to allow near - complete removal of the sky lines .",
    "the exposure times recorded in column 5 of table [ t1 ] are the on - object integration times .",
    "details of the observations are given in table [ t1 ] .",
    "the sample is described in detail in @xcite : essentially , the objects lie between redshifts of 300 and 1650 km / s , have neutral hydrogen masses less than and r - band magnitudes fainter than the small magellanic cloud , low rotation velocities , show evidence of current active star formation , and are isolated , away from galaxy clusters and the tidal effects of other galaxies . all objects exhibit low ( gas - phase ) oxygen abundance ( log(o / h ) @xmath11 z@xmath12 ) , as we describe below .",
    "the seeing listed in column 7 shows that in all but one case , ( j1403 - 27 ) , the seeing was average for siding spring . even in that case , the seeing was better than the spaxel sample size , resulting in little if any flux loss .",
    "several classes of object were identified in @xcite , including `` bloaters '' , which are objects considerably more spatially extended than their masses would suggest .",
    "one of these is j1118 - 17 .",
    "it is very faint , but as we show below , appears to have a very low metallicity . in the light of the results obtained for the relatively faint object , j1118 - 17 ( s1 and s2 targets ) , it would have been desirable to undertake significantly longer integration times , but observing conditions ( weather and moonlight ) did not permit this . we intend to undertake further longer integration time observations for this unusual object .",
    "the spectrum of j1118 - 17s1 is very noisy with few usable spectral lines , so we have analysed only s2the two objects appear similar apart from luminosity .",
    "we reported results for j1609 - 04 , a very isolated galaxy at the edge of the local void , in a previous paper @xcite , and the results are included again here for completeness .",
    "the data were reduced using the revised wifes python `` pywifes '' pipeline .",
    "this involves steps generally similar to those described in for the older pipeline : bias modelling and subtraction , flat fielding , arc line identification and wavelength calibration , cosmic ray removal , sky - line subtraction using nod - and - shuffle , initial data cube construction and atmospheric dispersion correction , standard flux star calibration , telluric correction , assembly into the final data cubes and , where necessary , combination of multiple cubes into a final object data cube .",
    "the standard stars used were taken from @xcite .",
    "spectral sampling was undertaken using a 6 arc sec diameter circular spatial area centered on each hii  region , through the full wavelength range of the data cube , to obtain spectra for each region .",
    "line fluxes were measured from these spectra using iraf / splot .",
    "particular care was taken to account for any stellar absorption features underlying the balmer emission lines , although in all cases , this was minor or absent , due to low stellar continuum .",
    "in fact , the stellar continuum was extremely faint , with the exception of the object j0005 - 28 ( see figure [ fig_7 ] , displayed on a log - intensity scale ) . unlike single slit spectra , with ifu data cubes , we are able to select the entire area of the hii  region from which to extract the spectrum , and exclude the majority of the galaxy stellar background , resulting in better signal - to - noise .",
    "test sample sizes showed that all the detectable h - alpha and [ oiii ] in each hii region lay within the sample aperture , except where there are closely adjacent hii regions ( e.g. , j1609 - 04 ) , where limiting the sample size to 6 arc sec diameter avoids sampling a different region .",
    "ideally , single spaxel - based analysis would be preferable to multi - spaxel sampling , but these objects are so faint that the resultant noise is prohibitive .",
    "flux de - reddening was performed on the raw flux data using two methods .",
    "first , for consistency with other work , we used the dust reddening formulae from @xcite with a@xmath13=3.1 , using the resultant balmer line flux ratios as a check . to confirm these results , we used the dust models from @xcite , using a relative extinction curve with r@xmath14=4.3 , where r@xmath14 = a@xmath13/(e@xmath15 ) and a@xmath13 is the v - band extinction .",
    "this is discussed in more detail in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* appendix 1 ) .",
    "we used an initial balmer decrement ratio of 2.82 for h@xmath8/h@xmath16 , corresponding to an electron temperature of 12 500k , adjusted the electron temperature using the direct method derived from the [ o  iii ] line ratios , then adjusted the apparent balmer ratios by varying the value of a@xmath13 for the best fit to the h@xmath17/h@xmath16 ratio , using the ratio h@xmath18/h@xmath16 as a check , fitting to the @xcite case b balmer ratios .",
    "the de - reddened flux values reported in table [ t2 ] are those using the cardelli method . in all cases ,",
    "the two approaches gave similar results ( to within @xmath43% in the de - reddened balmer line ratios ) . in only one case , j2234 - 04 , object a , did the de - reddening fail to provide a plausible result , and this has been excluded from the results reported here .",
    "it appears likely that two or more incompletely removed cosmic ray artefacts were the cause of the problem .",
    "images of the objects listed in table [ t1 ] are shown in figure [ fig_1 ] .",
    "these are 38@xmath1025 arc sec h@xmath8 slices from the wifes data cubes .",
    "spectra were extracted from these cubes using 6 arc sec diameter samples , centered on each ( bright ) hii  region .",
    "note that the seeing during the observations of object 7 , j1403 - 27 , was poor3 to 5 arc sec  so the dimensions of the image do not indicate the true size of the hii  region .",
    "the image scaling does not reflect the true brightness , but has been adjusted to illustrate the extent of the fainter parts of the hii  regions .",
    "the sample size is larger than the worst seeing so avoids any sample size flux losses . in all but the one case the sample size is much larger than the object ( see table [ t1 ] ) .",

    "spectra extracted from the wifes data cubes are shown in figures [ fig_2][fig_6 ] .",
    "the current data reduction pipeline creates a `` sag '' artefact for wavelengths shorter than @xmath44000  , in the absence of a strong stellar continuum .",
    "stellar continua are weak or non - existent in most objects except for j0005 - 28 , j2242 - 06 , and j2349 - 42 .",
    "defective ccd chip amplification at the time of the observations caused two high noise regions in the spectrum of j2242 - 06 , which have been replaced in figure [ fig_3 ] with straight lines .",
    "incipient noise from these two chip amplifiers is apparent in other spectra , but does not impact on any of the important diagnostic emission lines .",
    "de - reddened fluxes , equivalent widths , and logarithmic extinction coefficients ( c(h@xmath16 ) ) for the observed optical nebular lines are shown in table [ t2 ] .",
    "as noted in the appendix , the extinction coefficients were calculated using the cardelli reddening law with a@xmath13=3.1 similar results ( @xmath203% ) were obtained using methods derived from @xcite .",
    "the equivalent widths are large for for some objects , indicating the very low continua , because the host galaxies are very small and faint , and the spectra were measured from an area sampling only the immediate area of the hii  region .",
    "figure [ fig_4b ] is a close up of the spectra in figures [ fig_2 ] to [ fig_4 ] , from 4200  to 4500 , illustrating the h@xmath17 and auroral [ o  iii ] 4363  lines .",
    "the signal to noise is mainly very good , but for three of the 14 objects in figures [ fig_2 ] to [ fig_4 ] , the detections are real but noisy ( see table [ t2 ] ) .     and",

    "an enlarged section of the spectrum of j1118 - 17s2 near h@xmath8 is shown in figure [ fig_6 ] , illustrating the apparent absence ( to within the noise ) of [ n ii ] , although both [ s ii ] lines are apparent .",
    "this lack of any evidence for nitrogen suggests a particularly low metallicity , which we have estimated below using strong line diagnostic measurements .",
    "this object ( and the associated j1118 - 17s1 ) warrants further observation to reduce the noise and establish the [ n ii ] flux .",
    "we have not presented the spectrum of j1118 - 17s1 as the signal - to - noise ratio was very poor and did not permit reliable measurement of any fluxes other than h@xmath8 , h@xmath16 and [ o  iii ] 5007  .         emission lines . ]",
    "figure [ fig_7 ] shows the emission line rich spectrum of the bright bcd * j0005 - 28 * with flux on a logarithmic scale .",
    "twelve balmer lines can be seen , allowing particularly accurate de - reddening to be calculated .",
    "the de - reddening process based on the h@xmath8 to h@xmath16 ratio gave ratios to within 0.3% for h@xmath18 and 12% for h@xmath21 of the expected values for case b.     4363   line is strong . ]",
    "the electron temperature , t@xmath0 , can be derived from collisionally excited line fluxes , for a variety of ionic species , provided the auroral line is observed ( in the case of o  iii , the 4363  line ) .",
    "the method most frequently used makes use of the ratio of fluxes of the bright [ o  iii ] lines to the auroral line .",
    "this is a well - established technique ( see discussions in * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but it calculates only the o@xmath22 abundance , not the total gas - phase abundance of oxygen . in most hii  regions , the contributions to total oxygen from neutral o and o@xmath23",
    "are minor , so in addition to o@xmath22 we only need to calculate the contribution from o@xmath24 .    if the equivalent auroral lines for [ o  ii ] , [ n  ii ] and [ s  iii ] are present in the spectra , the electron temperatures can be calculated using these lines too , and since they peak at different regions in the hii  region , the auroral lines collectively sample the complete volume . when these auroral lines are not observed , empirical methods can be used to estimate the o@xmath24 abundance , for example in .",
    "however , as those authors note , the methods depend on having reliable atomic data ( energy levels , transition probabilities , and collision strengths ) .",

    "there are two principal methods for determining oxygen abundances from hii  region optical spectra , the direct or electron temperature ( t@xmath0 ) method and the strong line methods .",
    "the t@xmath0 method is possible if one of the auroral lines is observed at adequate signal - to - noise ( @xmath58 ) , usually [ o iii ] 4363 .",
    "this is the case in all but one of the galaxies discussed here and is detailed below .",
    "the so - called strong line methods use flux ratios of the prominent nebular lines to determine abundances ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "conventionally , the strong line methods were empirical , calibrated against results using the direct method .",
    "however , recently , @xcite have extensively revised the strong line techniques , developing diagnostic grids based on the mappings photoionization modelling code , using the latest atomic data , and the possibility that the electrons exhibit a non - equilibrium @xmath59 energy distribution @xcite .",
    "the grids are new , and the ratios used have been selected to maximise the orthogonality of the parameters , avoiding to a large extent the degeneracy of older diagnostics , and to solve for both metallicity and ionization parameter .",
    "these new diagnostics generate values for both the oxygen abundance and the ionization parameter , @xmath49 , and give substantially more consistent abundance values than the older methods .",
    "this can be seen by comparing the metallicity results for the different diagnostics from table [ t3 ] and the older diagnostic results listed in table [ tx ] . in table",
    "[ t3 ] , the diagnostics involving the ratio [ n  ii]/[s  ii ] and [ n  ii]/[o  ii ] are particularly consistent , differing by typically @xmath20.03 dex .    the ionization parameter @xmath49 ( sometimes expressed as @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the speed of light ) is the ratio of the number of ionizing source photons passing through a unit volume to the neutral hydrogen density .",
    "the photon flux matches the number of new ions it produces , and as @xmath49 has the dimensions of velocity , it can be understood as the maximum speed at which the boundary of the ionized region can move outwards @xcite .",
    "@xmath49 is at its maximum at the inner edge of the ionized region of an hii  region , and falls to zero at the outer edge of the ionized nebula , where the ionizing flux is fully depleted .",
    "a problem with older diagnostics such as r@xmath62 is that measured metallicities depend on the ionization parameter .",
    "there have been previous attempts to solve for the ionization parameter @xcite but these new diagnostics solve for its value independently of the metallicity , and consequently , take into account the ionization gradients present in hii  regions .",
    "the diagnostics chosen here are also relatively insensitive to non - equilibrium ( @xmath59 ) electron energy distributions , especially for values of @xmath63 20 . in addition , @xmath59 distributions have a smaller effect on the excitation of lower metallicity hii  regions than in higher metallicity objects .",
    "for this reason , and in the interests of clarity , we present here only the equilibrium ( maxwell - boltzmann , or @xmath64 ) results",
    ".    figures [ fig_8 ] and [ fig_9 ] plot the log flux ratios for the observed objects on the diagnostic grids from @xcite .",
    "not all of the objects can be accommodated within these grids .",
    "there are several possible reasons , and these will be discussed in detail in the second paper in this series .",
    "one likely cause relates to electron densities .",
    "the grids shown here are calculated for an electron density , n@xmath0 @xmath4 5 @xmath5 . for the majority of the observed objects ,",
    "this is accurate , but for some the densities are somewhat higher .",
    "below we analyse the ratios of the two [ s  ii ] lines ( 6716 and 6731  ) which are a useful diagnostic of electron density @xcite , and it is clear that some of the objects exhibit higher densities . some of the `` misfit '' points can be accommodated on grids calculated for higher electron densities ( see below and figure [ fig_11 ] ) .",
    "table [ t3 ] lists the oxygen abundances and ionization coefficients computed from the new diagnostic grids using the `` pyqz '' interpolation described in @xcite .",
    "while the interpolation scheme does not always work reliably for near - vertical grid lines , leading to null results , it is clear that different diagnostics yield somewhat different results .",
    "however , the consistency is far better than earlier methods permitted .",
    "we have found that for low metallicity objects ( @xmath2 0.5 z@xmath3 ) , diagnostics listed in table [ t3 ] involving log(n  ii / s  ii ) give values for the metallicity that differ by typically less than 0.02 dex and diagnostic using the log(n  ii / o  ii ) ratios are similar .",
    "it is also evident from table [ t3 ] that the direct methods are nearly all lower by @xmath40.13 dex than the best log(n  ii / s",
    "ii ) strong line diagnostic values .",
    "this is in agreement with the findings of @xcite that the direct method abundances are generally lower than strong line estimates .",
    "however , with the newer atomic data , the recalculated direct method abundances , and the revised mappings photoionization code , these differences are smaller . for comparison we also present the results of older strong line diagnostics , in table [ tx ] .",
    "perhaps the most variable result is that for j1118 - 17s2 .",
    "this is not surprising , as the [ n  ii ] flux is poorly defined .",
    "it appears likely that an oxygen abundance figure of @xmath47.2 ( @xmath4z@xmath3/30 ) is a reasonable estimate .",
    "it is worth noting that the mappings photoionization modelling grids used here take into account the total oxygen abundance , i.e. , both the gas - phase oxygen and that incorporated in dust grains .",
    "when comparing the electron temperature and strong line abundances , it is necessary to increase the electron temperature oxygen abundance values by @xmath40.07dex , to allow for the oxygen in dust grains that the direct method does not account for .",
    "this , of course , assumes a particular level of dust in the ism . in the mappings strong line diagnostic grids",
    ", we assume a 1.0 solar dust depletion . found that the gas - to - dust ratio varies considerably between objects , depending on their individual star formation histories , particularly at the low end of the galaxy mass scale .",
    "this is a further complication for any attempt to estimate the total oxygen abundance in an hii  region .",
    "has shown a correlation between the reddening coefficient c(h@xmath16 ) and the gas - to - dust ratio in wolf - rayet galaxies , and it is likely that a similar relation holds for smaller dwarf galaxies .",
    "( we do not have the necessary fir data to allow us to calculate the dust mass here ) .",
    "in the meantime , the direct method oxygen abundance measurements provide a lower limit to the total oxygen .",
    "in this section we use the approach from our previous paper , @xcite .",
    "one of the more important parameters in understanding galactic evolution is the nitrogen abundance , and in particular , the ratio of nitrogen to oxygen .",
    "the observations reported here include relatively low noise measurements of both [ n  ii ] and [ o  ii ] , allowing us to explore the values of log(n / o ) for each hii  region .",
    "to calculate the value of n / o from [ n  ii ] and [ o  ii ] line fluxes , we use empirical formulae from , equations ( 3 ) and ( 6 ) .",
    "( this approach was chosen because it accounts for the temperature dependencies of the [ n  ii ] and [ o  ii ] fluxes ) .",
    "these equations reduce to :    @xmath65    where @xmath66 is the [ o  iii ] electron temperature in units of 10,000k .",
    "this equation differs only by a small constant offset ( 0.033 ) from that quoted by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* equation ( 9 ) ) , most probably due to the latter using older atomic data .. we assume the same electron temperature for o  ii and n  ii ( reasonable , as they both arise primarily from the outer parts of the hii  region ) , and further , that n@xmath24/o@xmath24 = n / o , following @xcite and others .",
    "the errors from these assumptions are likely to be of the same order as the measurement uncertainties .",
    "the results are shown in table [ ty ] .    using the abundance values listed in table [ ty ] , we can plot log(n / o ) versus oxygen abundance .",
    "figure [ fig_10 ] shows the data from this work ( yellow triangles ) , data from other sigrid objects from @xcite ( brown triangles ) and data from @xcite ( black circles ) .",
    "the sigrid data are consistent with the van zee results , without any obvious evidence of a floor .",
    "however , @xcite state that the nitrogen floor does not become apparent until the oxygen abundance falls below z=7.7 , so the sigrid data do not resolve the question of whether the floor exists .",
    "while the data for j1118 - 17s2 are not plotted because the value of the [ n  ii ] flux is not well defined , the best estimate values for this object ( log(n / o ) @xmath11 2.481 and z @xmath11 7.2 ) extend the trend considerably further in the same direction , off the graph , below and to the left .",
    "if correct , this suggests a very low level for any primary nitrogen , but further observations are necessary to confirm this the red curve is the fit to the van zee data used in the mappings model grids , from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* figure 3 ) , making allowance for the oxygen depletion into dust grains .",
    "there is an increased scatter in the distribution with decreasing oxygen abundance ( z ) .",
    "two possibilities may contribute to this .",
    "first , as there are populations of older stars in these galaxies ( for example , kk246 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so intermediate mass agb stars will contribute nitrogen to the interstellar medium ( ism ) through hot - bottom burning processes .",
    "second , the amounts contributed by such processes will depend on the ( unknown ) star formation histories of different galaxies .",
    "as the abundances derived using the strong line diagnostics depend at least in part on the log(n  ii / o  ii ) and log(n  ii / s  ii ) ratios , the results are sensitive to deviations in the nitrogen fit from the theoretical fit used in the mappings models , which was derived from van zee s 1998 data ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so any error here affects the model outcomes .",
    "figure [ fig_10 ] shows that , at lower metallicities , the data exhibit increasing scatter and may even have started to fork into two branches .",
    "the upper region of the scatter may indicate nitrogen enrichment by wolf - rayet wn stars , as suggested by .",
    "smaller galaxies may divide into two classes , those with ( or that have had ) wn stars , and those without , depending on the stochastic nature of individual star formation events . @xcite",
    "have suggested the [ n / o ] ratio of hii  regions in a galaxy arise from nitrogen that is significantly primary in origin , and are a measure of the early star formation history .",
    "while this may be correct for larger galaxies , at least in the case of the very isolated dwarf galaxy kk246 , it is not the case , as the log(n / o ) ratio is low but there is evidence of older stellar populations @xcite . the presence or absence of wn stars in a dwarf galaxy s hii  regions is a plausible explanation for this scatter or bifurcation .",
    "this would be consistent with the observations of the blue compact dwarf galaxy , hs0837 + 4717 .",
    "the object appears to harbor over 100 wolf - rayet stars and has both a very low oxygen abundance and a high nitrogen abundance .",
    "the flux ratios of the two [ s ii ] lines at 6716 and 6731    are good indicators of electron density ( section 5.6 , * ? ? ?",
    "table [ t8 ] shows the variation of this ratio calculated for electron densities n@xmath0 of @xmath4 5 and @xmath450 @xmath5 , for an ionization parameter @xmath67 = 7.5 , typical for hii  regions .",
    "the trends in the [ s  ii 6716]/[s  ii 6731 ] line ratio are due to two factors : ( 1 ) the relatively small dependence of the line ratio on n@xmath68 resulting from the collisional excitation rates of the s  ii line upper states , and ( 2 ) the use of the isobaric setting in the mappings photoionization modelling code , such that the density structure of the s  ii region is a function of the ( varying ) temperature within it , which depends on metallicity .",
    "table [ ty ] shows the measured [ s ii ] line ratios and electron densities , calculated using pyneb @xcite , for all objects except j1118 - 17s2 , for which we have no electron temperature . comparing the observed s  ii line flux ratios to table [ t8 ] , it is reasonable to conclude that the mappings values show j0005 - 28 , j1152 - 02a&b , j1403 - 27 , j2039 - 63a ,",

    "the values derived using the two t@xmath0 methods are similar , suggesting that the method developed here is reliable . see also a discussion of this in the forthcoming paper 2 .",

    "the average value of the difference @xmath18z is 0.104@xmath200.171 .",

    "this leads to an overestimate of 0.07 dex in the abundance values derived from the diagnostic grids , compared to the gas - phase - only oxygen abundances from the direct method , explaining about half of the discrepancy .",

    "there may also be increased nitrogen due to enrichment by wn stars , as in the case of hs 0837 + 4717 .",
    "the oxygen abundance discrepancy for j1609 - 04(2 ) is very likely a result of uncertainty in the flux of the [ o  iii ] 4363    auroral line , which is weak in this object .",

    "second , diagnostics involving log(n  ii / h@xmath8 ) give somewhat higher oxygen abundances than both the other diagnostics and the direct method values .",
    "the source of these discrepancies is unclear , but may be related to the abundance fit for nitrogen used in mappings .",
    "they do not materially affect the results reported here , provided we rely on the log(n  ii / s  ii ) and log(n  ii / o  ii ) diagnostics and direct method oxygen abundances .      in the second paper examining these observations",

    "the implications appear to be that some of the high temperatures reported in low metallicity hii  regions may be somewhat in error .",
    "we will demonstrate the effect of taking into account the additional contribution to total oxygen abundance of the oxygen in dust grains .",
    "we will also suggest that the apparent spread in metallicities at the low end of the mass - metallicity relation are due to stochastic effects in stellar mass distributions in the small star clusters exciting hii  regions in small irregular galaxies .",

    "this appendix describes the methods used to estimate emission line flux uncertainties for spectra extracted from wifes data cubes of objects in the sigrid sample .",
    "the data reduction process is described in detail in , and in this paper in section 2.3 .",
    "briefly , the steps where noise is involved or systematic errors are incurred are bias subtraction , flat fielding , cosmic ray removal , sky - line subtraction using nod - and - shuffle , and standard flux star calibration . the principle sources of uncertainty are the ccd detector and amplifier readout noise , and the amplification of this noise through the data reduction chain ; the effects of cosmic rays and sky lines , and their removal ( partial or complete ) ; the calibration of the emission line fluxes using standard star flux data ; the de - reddening process ; and the measurement of the line fluxes from the flux - calibrated spectra .",
    "as the ifu data frame is convolved into a data cube in the pipeline , the process of error calculation is more complex than for single slit or echelle spectroscopy . for the spectral noise uncertainties ,",
    "there are two approaches we could take .",
    "one is to estimate the errors accumulating from each step , such as described for echelle spectroscopy by @xcite .",
    "the other approach , used here , is to measure the statistical noise from spectra extracted from the reduced data cube , and to estimate the systematic errors arising from the de - reddening and flux calibration , which are independent of the statistical noise . unlike single slit spectra , with ifu data cubes , we are able to select the entire area of the hii  region from which to extract the spectrum , and exclude the majority of the galaxy stellar background , resulting in better signal - to - noise .",
    "note that the statistical noise varies with the size of the sampled spaxel area , due to averaging .",
    "for the objects in this study , sampling using a 6 arc sec diameter circular spatial area maximises the amount of flux from the hii  region and minimises both the statistical noise , though averaging , and the stellar continuum from the area outside the hii  region .    in every case , the galaxies were so faint that the stellar extent was at best barely detectable .",
    "however , images from the dss survey and from the singg data ( as illustrated in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggest the individual galaxies are less than or approximately equal to the fov of the wifes spectrograph , 25@xmath1038 arc sec .",
    "the benefit of the ifu is that the sample was centered on the hii  region , and excluded virtually all areas of the galaxies without hii  emission .",
    "line fluxes and noise were measured from the extracted spectra using iraf / splot .",
    "the standard splot ` k - k ' method was used to fit a gaussian to each emission line , to measure the equivalent width ( where possible ) , the gaussian full width at half maximum , and the integrated flux .",
    "noise was measured on both sides of the emission line using the splot ` m - m ' method .",
    "these results were checked using the deblend ` d - d ' method , but using a single line , which automatically generates values of the same parameters .",
    "particular care was taken to account for any stellar absorption features underlying the balmer emission lines , although in all cases , this was minor or absent , due to low stellar continuum .",
    "in fact , the stellar continuum was extremely faint , with the exception of the object j0005 - 28 ( see figure [ fig_7 ] , displayed on a log - intensity scale ) .",
    "test sample sizes showed that all the detectable h@xmath8 and [ o  iii ] in each hii  region lay within the sample aperture .",
    "the observed fluxes mostly peak at or less than a radius of 2.5 arc sec , except where there are closely adjacent hii  regions ( e.g. , j1609 - 04 ) . for these , limiting the sample size to 6 arc sec diameter avoided sampling a different hii  region . ideally , single spaxel - based analysis would be preferable to multi - spaxel sampling , but these objects are so faint that the resultant noise is prohibitive .    detector noise is added to the data frame during bias subtraction and flat fielding , as the bias and flat field frames used also incur readout noise .",
    "the sky subtraction process using the nod and shuffle process or the sky frame method adds additional noise during the subtraction process .",
    "nod - and - shuffle sky subtraction was used for all hii  region observations , with sub - exposure times chose to be shorter than the shortest observed fluctuation in the oh airglow lines @xcite .",
    "the removal of the critical oh lines is effectively complete in all observations .",
    "the [ o  i ] airglow lines are at wavelengths that did not interfere with any of the observed hii  region spectral lines .",
    "cosmic ray removal is reasonably efficient , using the laplacian kernel technique described by @xcite .",
    "the process is not perfect , but virtually all the remaining cosmic ray artefacts are removed using the process . in isolated cases ,",
    "separate cosmic rays occur on all object data frames at the same location , and this can lead to erroneous results , but this can be detected by the labor intensive process of inspecting all the lines on all the ifu slitlets ( 25 ) on all the data frames ( usually 3 ) .",
    "figure [ cosray ] shows part of a raw wifes blue data frame including segments of 7 slitlets ( of a total 25 ) , centered on the h@xmath17 and [ o  iii ] @xmath57 4363 auroral line , for the galaxy j0005 - 28 .",
    "the auroral line is very prominent in this frame , to the left of the h@xmath17 line .",
    "[ cosray ]   line , showing sections of 7 slitlets .",
    "each frame was inspected to check for cosmic ray contamination of key lines .",
    "note that , due to the optical paths in the wifes ifu blue camera , the right side of the image corresponds to shorter wavelengths.,title=\"fig : \" ]    in addition to the intrinsic statistical noise amplified through the data reduction pipeline , when measuring the emission line fluxes , it is necessary to take into account any broad absorption lines in the stellar continuum , on which the nebular spectra are superimposed .",
    "there are three approaches here .",
    "the first is to correct for an assumed 2    ew absorption in each line , as described in @xcite .",
    "the second is to use an automated method such as the lzifu idl program developed by several workers at the university of hawaii , which fits model stellar continua to observed spectra and then calculates the emission line fluxes ( a paper on this application is planned ) .",
    "the third approach , which we use here , works better when the stellar continuum is weak , as with the objects reported here .",
    "it involves manual fitting of gaussian profiles to the emission lines using standard iraf / splot methods .",
    "the technique described by @xcite is very similar in detail to the method used here .",
    "the errors arising from the de - reddening process are due to uncertainties in the nature and amount of dust between the nebular emission and the observer . in the case of the sigrid objects considered here , all are further than 10@xmath77 from the galactic equator , to avoid significant reddening by milky way dust .",
    "we calculated the de - reddening using two independent methods and used the differences between the results as an estimate of the de - reddening errors .",
    "we used the dust reddening formulae from @xcite with a@xmath13=3.1 , adjusting the de - reddening to set the resultant balmer h@xmath8/h@xmath16 flux ratios to the @xcite case b balmer ratios for the calculated [ o  iii ] electron temperature .",
    "we used the ratios of h@xmath17 and h@xmath18 to h@xmath16 as confirmation . to confirm these results , we employed the dust models from @xcite , using a relative extinction curve with r@xmath14=4.3 , where r@xmath14 = a@xmath13/(e@xmath15 ) and a@xmath13 is the v - band extinction .",
    "this is discussed in more detail in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* appendix 1 ) .",
    "we used an initial balmer decrement ratio of 2.82 for h@xmath8/h@xmath16 , corresponding to an electron temperature of 12 500k , adjusted the electron temperature using the direct method derived from the [ o  iii ] line ratios , then adjusted the apparent balmer ratios by varying the value of a@xmath13 for the best fit to the h@xmath17/h@xmath16 ratio , using the ratio h@xmath18/h@xmath16 as a check , again fitting to the storey and hummer case b balmer ratios .",
    "the de - reddened flux values reported in table [ t2 ] are those using the cardelli method .",
    "in all cases , the two approaches gave similar results : the average difference between the two methods for the important diagnostic lines varies between 0.1% and 0.7% . as a consequence",
    ", we have adopted a figure of 1% for the de - reddening error . in only one case , j2234 - 04 , object a , did the de - reddening fail to provide a plausible result , and this has been excluded from the results reported here .",
    "it appears likely that two or more incompletely removed sets of cosmic ray artefacts were the cause of the problem , in this particular case .",
    "flux calibration errors depend on how well one can fit flux - calibrated vales to the standard stars .",
    "the standard stars used were taken from @xcite , using bessell s recalibration of hamuy s southern spectrophotometric standards @xcite .",
    "calibrating to these standards is likely to be more accurate than the older oke standards @xcite , but we have retained an estimated 2% error for calibrating the flux values , as per @xcite .    we have recently corrected a problem with the measured [ o  ii ] line fluxes .",
    "the source of the problem is a sharp absorption edge at 3850 , due to the adhesive used in the beam splitter , and the lack of any significant output below about 3900  from the lamps used for flat exposures to identify and correct this problem .",
    "the lamps are now being replaced , and future measurements using wifes will no longer require this compensation .",
    "the problem was understood in the testing phase of the construction of wifes , and was identified in the observations from poor matches to the diagnostic grids that involve [ o  ii ] in the ratios . to compensate requires boosting the [ o  ii ] flux by a factor of @xmath101.5 .",
    "it affects only the [ o  ii ] @xmath1 3726,9 lines .",
    "it does not make a substantial difference to the calculated oxygen abundances or other results ."
