    "sharp inequalities in analysis and geometry have been of interest for many years and many have been investigated from different points of view where not only their sharpness is proved but the extremal quantities ( those that make the inequality an equality ) are identified .",
    "once the extremals are known it is natural to ask about the stability of such inequalities .",
    "more specifically , the aim in the investigation of stability inequalities is to measure , in terms of an appropriate distance from the extremals , how far an admissible quantity is from attaining equality .",
    "for various examples of such stability results in geometry and spectral theory , we refer the reader to the work by brasco and philippis @xcite . for a sample of stability inequalities in analysis , see bianchi and egnell @xcite , chen , frank and weth @xcite , christ @xcite , dolbeault and toscani @xcite , fathi , indrei and ledoux @xcite , and the very recent paper of carlen @xcite , to list just a few .    on the probability side ,",
    "there has been considerable interest in obtaining sharp inequalities for martingales ( for many examples and further references , see the monograph @xcite ) .",
    "many of these results have had important applications in analysis ; we shall see some examples below and relate them to some results from the literature .",
    "it is interesting to note that in the case of many of the classical martingale inequalities , unlike the inequalities in analysis referenced above , equality is never attained .",
    "that is , extremals do not exist .",
    "this is the case , for example , in doob s maximal inequality , in the classical burkholder - davis - gundy inequalities for martingales with continuous paths ( davis @xcite ) , and in burkholder s martingale inequalities under the assumption of differential subordination , which include his celebrated sharp martingale transforms inequalities @xcite . in this paper",
    "we investigate the stability of burkholder s inequalities and apply this to obtain similar results for a class of fourier multipliers that includes the real and imaginary parts of the beruling - ahlfors operator , the two dimensional hilbert transform , which has been extensively investigated in the literature .",
    "we also obtain the corresponding result for first order riesz transforms on @xmath1 , @xmath2 .",
    "the latter is new even for the hilbert transform , the case when @xmath3 .",
    "our results are motivated from the recent paper @xcite by melas concerning the structure of almost extremal functions associated with the @xmath0-estimate for the dyadic maximal operator @xmath4 on @xmath5^d$ ] , a version of doob s maximal inequality .",
    "it is well - known that @xmath4 is a bounded operator on @xmath6^d)$ ] , @xmath7 , and its norm equals @xmath8 .",
    "although this norm is never attained , there is a very interesting property of the functions which are almost extremal .",
    "a careful inspection of the paper @xcite reveals that for any @xmath9 there is @xmath10 for which the pointwise identity @xmath11 holds true and therefore this family of functions , corresponding to different @xmath12 , can be regarded as an `` approximate eigenfunction '' of @xmath4 associated with the eigenvalue @xmath8 .",
    "one of the main results of @xcite makes this observation more precise .",
    "it is proved that if @xmath13 is a fixed exponent , @xmath9 is a small number and @xmath14 is _ any _ nonnegative function satisfying @xmath15^d)}\\geq\\left(\\frac{p}{p-1}-{\\varepsilon}\\right)||f||_{l^p([0,1]^d)},\\ ] ] then @xmath16^d)}\\leq c_p{\\varepsilon}^{1/p}||f||_{l^p([0,1]^d)}\\ ] ] for some constant @xmath17 depending only on @xmath18 . in other words , if @xmath14 is almost extremal for the @xmath0-estimate , then it is close , in the @xmath0-sense , to being an eigenfunction of @xmath4 corresponding to the eigenvalue @xmath8 .",
    "a careful analysis reveals a similar phenomenon for beurling - ahlfors operator @xmath19 on the plane @xmath20 .",
    "recall that this operator is a fourier multiplier with the symbol @xmath21 , @xmath22 .",
    "alternatively , it can be defined by the singular integral operator @xmath23 this operator plays a fundamental role in the theory of quasiconformal mappings in the plane .",
    "a convenient reference on the subject is the monograph @xcite by astala , iwaniec and martin .",
    "a crucial property of @xmath19 is that it changes the complex derivative @xmath24 to @xmath25 .",
    "more precisely , we have @xmath26 for any @xmath14 in the sobolev space @xmath27 of complex valued locally integrable functions on @xmath20 whose distributional first derivatives are in @xmath28 on the plane .",
    "a beautiful long - standing open problem formulated in 1982 by t. iwaniec @xcite asserts that @xmath29 where @xmath30 .",
    "it is well - known that the @xmath0-norm of @xmath19 can not be smaller than @xmath31 . curiously , the almost - extremal functions , constructed by lehto @xcite , are also close to being eigenfunctions of @xmath19 , but _ up to absolute value_. to state this more precisely , suppose first that @xmath32 .",
    "for a given @xmath33 , let @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the unit disc in the plane . using the commutation of @xmath24 and @xmath25 by @xmath19 , we have that @xmath36 now , if we let @xmath37 , then @xmath38 .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath0-norm of @xmath39 converges to infinity and the `` error term '' @xmath40 becomes irrelevant , so that @xmath41 .",
    "however , the above formula shows that , essentially , @xmath42 pointwise , provided @xmath43 is close to @xmath44 . in other words , @xmath39 is almost an eigenfunction of @xmath19 with the eigenvalue @xmath31 , up to absolute value . in the case",

    "our contribution in this paper is to present a quantitative version of stability result for a large class of fourier multipliers which includes the real and imaginary parts of beurling - ahlfors operator and first order riesz transforms .",
    "consider the following class of symbols , introduced by in @xcite .",
    "assume that @xmath48 is a finite nonnegative borel measure on the unit sphere @xmath49 of @xmath1 and fix a borel function @xmath50 on @xmath49 which take values in the unit ball of @xmath20 .",
    "we define the associated multiplier @xmath51 on @xmath1 by @xmath52 if the denominator is not @xmath53 , and @xmath54 otherwise . here",
