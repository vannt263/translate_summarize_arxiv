    "observations of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) have become essential tools in modern cosmology .",
    "precise measurements of the cmb temperature and polarization anisotropies provide valuable information about the universe  @xcite .",
    "recently , the measurement of cmb spectral distortions , that is , the deviation of the cmb frequency spectrum from a blackbody spectrum , has been expected as a new cosmological probe .",
    "cobe / firas has obtained the almost perfect blackbody spectrum of the cmb with the temperature @xmath1  k  @xcite .",
    "although they have not been detected yet , cmb distortions can be generated within the standard cosmological model as well as with new physics  ( for reviews , see @xcite ) .",
    "currently , the observational bound on the spectral distortions is given in terms of two types of distortions , @xmath2 and @xmath3-type distortions  .",
    "the @xmath2-type distortion is described with a nonvanishing chemical potential  @xmath2 and created at @xmath4 where , even if the cmb spectral distortionsarise , compton scattering is efficient enough to maintain the kinetic equilibrium of cmb photons .",
    "the @xmath3-type distortion is parametrized by the compton @xmath3 parameter and generated in lower redshifts @xmath5 where , once the cmb spectrum is distorted , the kinetic equilibrium of cmb photons is no longer maintained .",
    "the current constraints on the distortion parameters are provided by cobe / firas as @xmath6 and @xmath7  @xcite . to improve these bounds ,",
    "next - generation cmb spectrometers are being discussed  @xcite .",
    "the future measurements or constraints on the cmb distortions allow us to access the properties of primordial fluctuations  @xcite , the nature of dark matter  @xcite , the abundance of primordial black holes  @xcite , the existence of primordial magnetic fields  @xcite and other high - energy physics  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we discuss that the measurement of cmb distortions can also test general relativity  ( gr ) , in particular , the einstein equivalence principle  ( eep ) .",
    "since gr was proposed as the theory of gravity by einstein , the theory has passed almost all tests such as ground - based and solar system experiments  @xcite . and",
    "furthermore , the gravitational wave detection by ligo proves the accuracy of the theory even in a strong gravitational field  @xcite .",
    "however , it still leaves room to verify gr at the cosmological scales .",
    "since the first evidence was presented by the type - ia supernova observations  @xcite , independent cosmological observations strongly support the accelerating expansion of the universe . as an origin of this acceleration , gr requires the existence of unknown dark energy .",
    "alternatively , the modification of gr on cosmological scales is suggested to explain the acceleration as an effect of gravity  @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is still quite important to verify gr in the cosmological context , and we pay attention to the validity of the eep which is one of the fundamental principles in gr .",
    "the eep is tested from laboratory to solar system scales by many authors  ( for reference , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in these studies",
    ", the validity of the eep has been obtained from the travels of a test particle through the gravitational potential .",
    "therefore , as the constraint on the eep , these studies have provided the constraint on the energy dependency of parametrized - post - newtonian ( ppn ) parameter @xmath8 .",
    "recently , this energy dependency has been also tested by using high - energy photons emitted by gamma ray bursts , fast radio bursts , and tev blazers with the gravitational potential of the milky way  @xcite .    in this paper , we focus on the independency of the cosmological redshift effect on the energy of a test particle . because this energy independency is one of the consequences of the eep on cosmological scales , it is important to test the independency of the redshift effect by cosmological observations .",
    "we show that the independency of the redshift effect can be verified by measurement of the cmb distortion . after submitting our paper , ref .",
    "@xcite appeared .",
    "they have investigated the energy dependence of the cosmological redshift effect using the emission lines over the 37006800    range in sdss spectroscopic data at @xmath9 .",
    "their conclusion is that they can not find any energy - dependence of the redshift with a precision of @xmath10 at @xmath11 and @xmath0 at @xmath12 .",
    "our method is complementary with theirs because probing energy is different .",
    "besides , cmb distortion can verify the eep up to redshifts larger than @xmath13 .    to demonstrate the test of the eep through the cmb distortion",
    ", we introduce a simple energy dependence of the friedmann - robertson - walker  ( frw ) metric .",
    "generally , when a metric depends on energy , the eep is violated in this metric theory of gravity . in other words",
    ", the existence of the energy dependence of the metric means that the structure of spacetime felt by a test particle depends on its own energy .    in gr , although cmb photons are redshifted due to the cosmic expansion , the blackbody spectrum of the cmb is hold during their free - streaming because the eep ensures that redshift effect is independent of the photon energy .",
    "however , when the redshift effect depends on the photon energy , the deviation from the blackbody spectrum arises even in the free streaming regime .",
    "we evaluate the cmb distortion and obtain the constraints on the accuracy of the eep on cosmological time and length scales through a comparison with the cobe / firas data .",
    "since the energy dependency of the metric violates the eep , we first consider the energy - dependent frw metric .",
    "taking into account the cosmological principle , we can be allowed to introduce two energy dependent functions , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , in the frw metric as @xmath16 where @xmath17 denotes the energy of a photon observed by a free - falling observer in this metric , and @xmath14 and @xmath15 are arbitrary functions of @xmath17 .",
    "although , without assuming any certain gravity theory , we determine the form of eq .",
    "( [ metric ] ) based on the cosmological principle , the same energy dependence is often discussed in rainbow gravity , which is one of the gravity theories without the eep  @xcite .    since the frw metric depends on the energy , the redshift effect due to the cosmological expansion also has energy dependence . to derive the redshift effect",
    ", we consider the geodesic equation for a photon with energy @xmath17 . in the metric given by eq .",
    "( [ metric ] ) , nonvanishing christoffel symbols are @xmath18 where the dot denotes the derivative with respect to time .    therefore , the geodesic equation provides the modified redshift effect , @xmath19 when @xmath20 and @xmath21 are constant , the redshift effect is the same as in gr .",
    "after the epoch of recombination , the universe becomes transparent for photons and they are free to stream out . during such a free - streaming regime ,",
    "the evolution of the cmb photon energy distribution is given by the collisionless boltzmann equation .",
    "assuming the homogeneity and isotropy of the universe , the collisionless boltzmann equation in the metric by eq .",
    "( [ metric ] ) can be described as @xmath22 although the general solution of eq .",
    "( [ boltz ] ) is provided in a function of the combination value , @xmath23 , we need the initial condition of the energy distribution to solve eq .",
    "( [ boltz ] ) .",
    "well before the epoch of recombination , the time scale of thermal equilibrium for cmb photons is much shorter than the cosmological time scale . in this regime ,",
    "when the deviation from a blackbody spectrum arises , the deviation is quickly erased and the blackbody spectrum is maintained .",
    "therefore , for simplicity , we assume that the energy distribution of the cmb is a blackbody spectrum ,  @xmath24^{-1}$ ] , at the epoch of recombination , where @xmath25 is the temperature at that epoch .",
    "however , as mentioned above , cmb distortions can be generated below @xmath26 , which is well before the epoch of the recombination . during this regime ,",

    "the sensitivity of pixie is expected to be close to that required to measure the distortions arising from the dissipation of the scale - invariant primordial fluctuations , @xmath66 , which is one of unavoidable cosmological sources for cmb distortions . when pixie provides the constraint @xmath67 , the constraint on the eep reaches @xmath68 in the case of eq .",
    "( [ eq : caseii ] ) .",
    "in this paper , we have proposed that the measurement of cmb spectral distortions can test the accuracy of the eep on cosmological scales .",
    "the energy independence of the cosmological redshift effect is one of consequences of the eep . when the frw metric has energy dependence , the eep is violated on cosmological scales . as a result , the geodesic equation of a photon is modified and the redshift effect depends on its energy .",
    "we have shown that , in the energy - dependent frw metric , cmb distortions are generated even in the free - streaming regime through the energy - dependent redshift effect .",
    "the shape and amplitude of the distortion depends on the form of the energy dependency .",
    "to parametrize the validity of the eep in the frw metric , we have introduced the deviation parameter @xmath45 representing the deviation from the eep on the cmb energy scale .",
    "we have analytically evaluated the cmb distortions in two simple power - law cases of the energy - dependent deviation in the frw metric with the power law indices @xmath69 and @xmath70 . in the first case with @xmath69",
    ", we have found that the cobe / firas bound indicates that the eep is valid within the degree of the deviation , @xmath71 , on the cmb energy scale , @xmath72@xmath73  ev .",
    "when @xmath74 , the deviations at higher energy scales are larger than at lower energy scales .",
    "this means that , as @xmath75 becomes larger , the deviation increases at higher redshifts .",
    "therefore , the constraint on @xmath45 becomes tighter when @xmath75 increases . in the second case with @xmath70 ,",
    "the generated distortion is represented as the @xmath2-type distortion and the cobe / firas bound provides the constraint @xmath76 .",
    "when @xmath77 , the deviations at lower energy scales are larger than at higher energy scales .",
    "therefore , we obtain @xmath76 for @xmath77 . depending on the energy dependence of the frw metric",
    ", the spectral shape is different from the ordinary cmb distortions , @xmath2- and @xmath3-type distortions .",
    "therefore , the precise measurement of the distortion shape can provide us with a strong constraint on the eep violation .",
    "it is worth summarizing previous works about the test of the eep and providing comments on the relevance of our study . in previous studies ,",
    "the accuracy of the eep is investigated with the energy dependency of the ppn parameter @xmath8 . using the gamma ray observations , the constraint is provided as @xmath78 and @xmath79  @xcite . in the radio frequency range ,",
    "the energy difference of @xmath8 is less than @xmath80 , which is comparable to our results , from the observations of fast radio bursts  @xcite . since the constraints on the energy difference of @xmath8",
    "is related to the gravitational potential , these constraints are valid for the schwarzschild metric . therefore , these constraints can not be directly applicable to the frw metric without taking a theory of gravity . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors have discussed that the measurement of cmb distortions can provide the constraint on the time variation of the fine structure constant due to the eep violation in the electromagnetic sector .",
    "our constraint is completely independent of these limits . in more detail , we have provided a bound on the eep in the frw metric for the cosmological time scale from the epoch of recombination to the present time .",
    "additionally , upcoming observations with pixie provide 3 orders of magnitude stronger constraints than that of cobe / firas .",
    "recently ref .",
    "@xcite has investigated the energy dependence of the cosmological redshift with sdss data .",
    "their result is consistent with no energy dependence of the redshift effect with a precision of @xmath10 at @xmath11 and @xmath0 at @xmath12 . in this work",
    ", they used the spectral lines over the 37006800    range whose energy range is higher than in the cmb observation frequencies .",
    "although their investigated redshifts are not so high , their results are complementary with our results . according to both results , the violation of the eep in the frw metric is not found in the range from microwave to optical frequencies in the current observation precision .    in this paper , we have demonstrated that the measurement of the cmb distortions can test the eep in the frw metric by taking some assumptions . in particular , to evaluate the cmb distortions analytically , we neglected the evolution of the cmb distortions before the epoch of recombination .",
    "although the distortions can be generated in the energy - dependent frw metric before this epoch , it is necessary to solve the collisional boltzmann equation numerically .",
    "because the next - generation cmb spectrometers are being planned to measure cmb distortions precisely , further detailed calculation is required .",
    "we will address these issues for the eep bound in our future works .",
    "the spectral distortions of the cmb can be generated by other physical mechanisms , in particular , the processes related to the thermal history of the universe .",
    "therefore , it is difficult to solve these degeneracies to point out the effect of the eep violation by only the cmb distortion measurement .",
    "however , although we have only studied the cmb distortions of the cmb , neutrinos and gravitons also suffer an energy - dependent redshift effect and their spectra are modified from ones in the standard cosmology when the eep is violated in the frw metric .",
    "therefore , the frequency spectral measurement of not only cmb but also neutrinos and gravitational waves can allow us to obtain the observational suggestion to the eep violation .",

    "<S> the einstein equivalence principle ( eep ) can be verified by the measurement of the spectral distortions of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) . </S>",
    "<S> one of the consequences of the eep on cosmological scales is the energy independency of the cosmological redshift effect . </S>",
    "<S> we propose a new test of the energy independency of the redshift effect by the measurement of the spectral distortion of cmb . in general relativity , </S>",
    "<S> the energy independency of the redshift effect is ensured by the friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) metric which does not depend on energy . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the cmb spectral distortions arise when the frw metric has the energy dependence . assuming the simple energy - dependent form of the frw metric </S>",
    "<S> , we evaluate the cmb distortions . from the cobe / firas bound </S>",
    "<S> , we find that the deviation degree from the eep is , at least , less than @xmath0 at the cmb energy scales . </S>"
