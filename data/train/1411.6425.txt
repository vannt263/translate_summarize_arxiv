    "narrow line seyfert type 1s ( nls1s ) are small mass , high mass accretion rate active galactic nuclei ( agn ) . like other agn , their fastest",
    ", highest amplitude variability is at x - ray energies , but their lower mass means that this variability is on shorter timescales , making it easier to study over a typical @xmath1 day observation ( e.g. ponti et al 2010 ) .",
    "all the nls1s show rapid x - ray variability ( leighly 1999 ) , but some also show deep dips in the x - ray light curve .",
    "these dips coincide with the appearance of high energy complexity in the 2 - 10  kev spectra , either gradual curvature or strong features around the fe k@xmath2 line energy .",
    "gallo ( 2006 ) termed these complex nls1s to distinguish them from the simple nls1s which do not show dips and have relatively power law like spectra from 2 - 10  kev .",
    "two different models have been proposed to explain the deep dips and associated spectral complexity : partial covering and relativistic reflection .    in the partial covering model",
    ", the dips are caused by low ionisation material moving into the line of sight , increasing the absorption at the iron edge energy at 7.1  kev .",
    "this material can only partially cover the source as some fraction of the flux at low energies is still seen ( e.g. inoue et al 2003 ; turner et al 2007 ; miyakawa et al 2012 ) .",
    "conversely , in the relativistic reflection model the dips are caused by an extremely compact x - ray source on the spin axis of the black hole approaching the event horizon .",
    "the resulting strong light bending focusses the intrinsic continuum away from the observer ( producing the drop in flux ) so it instead strongly illuminates the very inner disc . for high spin black holes the resulting spectrum can be dominated by highly smeared relativistic reflection , marked by a strong but extremely broad and skewed fe k@xmath2 line ( e.g. fabian et al 2004 ; miniutti & fabian 2004 ; fabian et al 2009 ) . in both models , the complex and simple nls1s are intrinsically similar , and can change from one to the other ( as observed : gallo 2006 ) depending on whether there is absorption along the line of sight , or in the reflection model , whether the compact x - ray source is close to the horizon .",
    "both absorption and reflection models can fit the observed 0.3 - 10  kev spectra , as fitting complex models over a limited bandpass is highly degenerate .",
    "however a recent breakthrough is in the use of variability to break some of these degeneracies .",
    "in particular , the new techniques which can identify a lagged signal are clearly well matched to the reflection models , where there is a strong prediction that the reflected emission should lag behind the intrinsic continuum variability on the light travel time ( fabian et al 2009 ; uttley et al 2014 ) .",
    "detection of a very short lag time ( @xmath3  s ) in the complex nls1 1h0707 - 495 is taken as unequivocal support for the high spin relativistic reflection picture , as this implies distances of the source from the disc of @xmath4 for a @xmath5 black hole .",
    "the simple nls1 pg1244 + 026 shows a much longer lag time of @xmath0  s ( alston , done & vaughan 2014 ) , consistent with the source being somewhat further from the horizon .",
    "lags are derived by comparing variability in a soft and hard band , and show much more structure than just the reverberation signal .",
    "the lags change as a function of the timescale of variability .",
    "the soft leads the hard for long timescale variability , then this lag decreases with decreasing variability timescale until it goes negative ( soft lagging ) for the fastest fluctuations .",
    "this characteristic soft lead decreasing with frequency was first seen in the ( much higher signal to noise ) black hole binaries ( bhbs , e.g. miyamoto et al 1988 ; nowak et al 1999 ) , where it is now interpreted as the signature of fluctuations propagating through an inhomogeneous accretion flow ( kotov et al 2001 ; arevalo & uttley 2006 ) .",
    "slow variability starts at large radii , where the spectrum is softer .",
    "it then propagates down through the entire flow until it gets to the centre , modulating the hardest spectral region .",
    "faster variability is only produced closer to the black hole .",
    "it has a shorter distance to travel to reach the inner regions so takes a shorter time before it modulates the hardest x - ray component from the centre , i.e. this characteristic lag pattern is produced by a correlation of spectrum and variability with radial position .",
    "but this also means that the soft and hard bands both contain some emission from the softer spectrum produced at large radii , and the harder spectrum produced at smaller radii .",
    "there is just more of the softer ( large radii ) spectrum in the soft band than in the hard ( and conversely , more of the harder , small radii spectrum in the hard band than in the soft ) .",
    "thus each band contains the same components , but with different weighting , so most of the variability is perfectly correlated , with only a very small fraction which is lagged .",
    "this is seen in bhbs in a cross - correlation of hard and soft bands , which always peaks at zero lag , with just a small asymmetry ( torii et al 2011 ) .",
    "the important point for agn is that the spectral content of the hard and soft bands matters , and that the lags are diluted if the same component appears in both bands ( miller et al 2010 ; uttley et al 2014 )",
    ".    thus lags between light curves in two different energy bands have to be interpreted with a model of the spectral components which contribute to each band .",
    "even the simple nls1 pg1244 + 026 has a spectrum which requires multiple components .",
    "these can either be modelled by a disc , low temperature comptonisation and high temperature comptonisation , together with its ( weak and only weakly smeared ) reflection from a disc , or with disc , high temperature comptonisation and its ( strong , and strongly smeared ) reflection from a disc ( jin et al 2013 ) , or with a steep power law ( presumably from the jet ? ) together with high temperature comptonisation and its ( strong and strongly smeared ) reflection from a disc ( kara et al 2014 ) .",
    "using variability breaks degeneracies , and the combined constraints from energy spectra , power spectra in hard and soft bands , high frequency covariance spectra from the 4 - 10  kev light curve ( the spectrum of the fast variability which correlates with the 4 - 10 kev light curve ) and the lag - frequency spectrum strongly support the first model . in this model , slow fluctuations in the disc propagate down to modulate faster variability in the soft excess ( dominated by the low temperature compton emission ) , which propagates down into the high temperature compton emission from the x - ray corona , which then reflects from and is reprocessed by the disc .",
    "none of the models with strong , strongly smeared relativistic reflection could adequately match all the spectral - timing data for this source ( gardner & done 2014 , hereafter gd14 ) .",
    "in particular the fact relativistic reflection contributes strongly to both the hard and soft bands , results in nearly identical hard and soft band power spectra and high coherence between hard and soft bands up to high frequencies , in disagreement with observations of pg1244 + 026 .",
    "this model had no constraints on spin , as the disc component came from @xmath6 , the soft excess from @xmath7 and the coronal size was assumed to be @xmath8 .",
    "the soft x - ray excess is a composite of a separate low temperature comptonisation component from the disc ( which carries the required propagation signal ) and the mostly thermalised reprocessed emission from non - reflected x - ray illumination of the disc .",
    "hence the soft band contains components which carry the soft lead and the soft lag , but identifying the lag with reprocessing rather than reflection removes the requirement for extreme relativistic smearing as the thermalised emission is already smooth , as seen in the data , quite unlike ionised reflection which has strong atomic features .",
    "nustar data ( akn 120 : matt et al 2014 ) and long term x - ray / uv variability ( mrk 509 : mehdipour et al 2011 ; petrucci et al 2013 ; boissay et al 2014 ) favour the low temperature comptonisation model for the soft x - ray excess in standard broad line seyfert 1s .",
    "this removes the requirement of high spin derived from assuming that this component is instead from ionised reflection ( patrick et al 2011 ; see crummy et al 2006 ) , but we note that the issue is still controversial , and probably complex ( lohfink et al 2012 )",
    ".    with this model , the lag in pg1244 + 026 does not require high spin but neither does it rule out a source at @xmath9 above the event horizon of a high spin black hole , still allowing the range from simple to complex behaviour to be due to the height of the source .",
    "however , the broad band spectral energy distribution _ does _ rule out a standard disc around a high spin black hole .",
    "the observed optical / uv continuum constrains the mass accretion rate onto the black hole given its mass , so the total luminosity is only dependent on the efficiency i.e. on black hole spin .",
    "a high spin black hole produces too much luminosity which is very difficult to hide even in the uv - euv interstellar absorption gap ( done et al 2013 ) .",
    "advection is unlikely to change this conclusion , firstly as this source is not strongly super - eddington , and secondly as the most recent global radiative mri ( but newtonian ) disc simulations of a super - eddington flow at @xmath10 show that this is still almost as radiatively efficient as a standard thin disc due to vertical convection ( jiang , stone & davis 2014 ) .",
    "thus this source is most likely low spin , so should never show the extremely deep dips which are characteristic of the complex nls1 , as a low spin black hole can not produce extreme light bending .",
    "this is because the steep emissivity index required can only be produced when the illuminating source height is @xmath4 ( dovciak et al 2014 ) , which for a low spin bh is below the horizon .",
    "this suggests that simple to complex is more than just the source height , and points instead to spin as the potential difference between the two classes .",
    "yet many nls1s show transitions between simple and complex behaviour ( gallo 2006 ; miller et al 2008 ) so spin can not be the origin of the difference either .",
    "the accretion flow in steady state should only depend on black hole mass , spin , and mass accretion rate , plus inclination with respect to the disc which can change its appearance .",
    "all the nls1s have similar mass and mass accretion rate ( within a factor of @xmath11 ) so if the difference between simple and complex is neither source height nor spin , then inclination is the last parameter to try .",
    "these sources are all around eddington , so it seems unlikely that they are actually described by a flat disc as assumed in the relativistic reverberation models .",
    "the global mri simulation at @xmath10 showed a complex flow structure , with a large scale height radiation pressure driven wind from the inner disc carrying away 30% of the input mass accretion rate ( jiang et al 2014 ) .",
    "this wind is likely to be less strong in pg1244 + 026 since this source is only @xmath12 .",
    "uv line driving is unlikely to help since the low mass and high mass accretion rate of nls1s mean that their disc is too hot for its photosphere to have the required opacity to uv line transitions ( hagino et al 2014 ) .",
    "hence strong mass loss is not expected in the nls1s , but some turbulent , clumpy , failed eddington wind in the inner disc could easily form ( jiang et al 2014 ) .",
    "high inclination angles have a high probability of a clump intersecting the line of sight , while low inclination angles are mostly free of obscuration , giving a potential mapping from complex to simple nls1 as a function of inclination . the spectral signature of this time dependent absorption could be complex , depending on the amount of source occulted and the ionisation state of the absorber .    here",
    "we explore the effect of occultations on the lag - frequency behaviour .",
    "we show that occultations produce a soft lead when relativistic doppler effects are taken into account .",
    "we couple orbiting clump occultations with the full spectral timing model developed in gd14 to explain the properties of the simple nls1 pg1244 + 026 .",
    "we show that multiple occultations of this intrinsic propagation and reprocessing / reflection model can replicate the change in observed lag - frequency properties from a simple to a complex nls1 .",
    "in particular the soft lead resulting from occultations dilutes the maximum measured reverberation lag and shifts it to higher frequencies , as observed .",
    "many issues still remain for this to be a full model of the complex nls1 .",
    "nevertheless , this shows a promising alternative geometry for the complex nls1 .",
    "[ cols= \" < , > \" , ]",
    "we now investigate whether the addition of occultations can change the timing properties of a simple nls1 so that they appear more typical of complex nls1s .",
    "that is , can the effect of occultations reduce the maximum measured reverberation lag from @xmath13s to nearer @xmath14s and shift it to higher frequencies ?    in the previous sections we assumed constant flux from the underlying accretion flow .",
    "we now replace this static model with the time dependent model of gd14 shown in fig .",
    "the disc , which is at the largest radii , generates the slowest fluctuations .",
    "these propagate down to the soft excess , which is at smaller radii and generates its own slightly faster fluctuations .",
    "the fluctuations in soft excess emission therefore consist of the slow fluctuations from the disc , delayed by some lag related to the propagation time , modulated by the faster fluctuations generated in the soft excess .",
    "these fluctuations then propagate down to the corona , which generates even faster fluctuations .",
    "the hard coronal emission therefore shows fluctuations on a whole range of timescales , as it responds to mass accretion rate fluctuations propagating down from all radii .",
    "a fraction of these central hard x - rays will illuminate the cooler soft excess and disc components .",
    "some of this illuminating flux will be reflected , the rest will thermalise and be reprocessed .",
    "12 shows our spectral decomposition now including these reflected and reprocessed components . these come from a fit to the time",
    "averaged spectrum of the simple nls1 pg1244 + 026 ( obs i d : 0675320101 , see gd14 ) , shown in black data points . for simplicity",
    "we assume all reflection / reprocessing occurs on the soft excess ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "thus the fluctuations in the reflected / reprocessed emission follow the coronal fluctuations ( fig .",
    "11a ) , except for the very fastest fluctuations which are smoothed out by the range of light travel time delays . hence the reflected and reprocessed fluctuations are a lagged and smoothed version of the hard coronal fluctuations .",
    "the soft excess therefore consists of intrinsic emission from the accretion flow ( dashed green line , fig .",
    "12 ) , which varies slowly due to intrinsic mass accretion rate fluctuations in the soft excess and those that have propagated inwards from the disc , and reprocessed emission ( dotted green line , fig . 12 ) which follows the faster coronal fluctuations .",
    "gd14 showed that this model can reproduce all the observed timing properties of the simple nls1 pg1244 + 026 .",
    "we use this model to describe the emission from the underlying accretion flow as a function of time , and now add the effect of occulting clouds .",
    "we fix the cloud parameters to @xmath16 , @xmath17s and @xmath18 .",
    "a transit time of @xmath19s implies an orbital radius of @xmath20 .",
    "hence we reduce our transit radius from @xmath21 in fig .",
    "1a to @xmath20 and take into account the circular motion of the clouds . since the clouds are launched so close to the central x - ray source we allow them to be highly ionised and use the magenta transmission spectrum shown in fig .",
    "9a ( @xmath22 , @xmath23 ) .",
    "@xmath20 is consistent with the clouds being launched as part of a failed eddington ( radiation pressure driven ) wind from the soft excess region as sketched in fig .",
    "radiation pressure lifts material from the accretion flow , which forms clumps as it rises ( takeuchi et al 2014 ) .",
    "as soon as the optical depth of the clumps becomes @xmath24 , some of the material is self - shielded from x - ray photons .",
    "the mass of the clump is still the same but the radiation pressure on it is now less .",
    "if the source is not strongly super - eddington , the radiation pressure is not strong enough to expel the material so it falls back to the disc , resulting in a failed rather than outflowing wind .",
    "the whole turbulent large scale height region is the source of the soft excess .",
    "propagation of fluctuations occurs through the disc regions which are the source of the intrinsic emission , while the bulk of the reflected and reprocessed emission comes from the turbulent clouds .",
    "we assume the turbulent velocity is less than the orbital velocity ( @xmath25 ) and that the clouds remain largely intact on the timescale of a single transit ( although @xmath26 may be sufficient to shred them on longer timescales , stripping off material before what remains falls back to the disc ) . for a source at high inclination",
    ", these clouds will intercept the line of sight to the central regions .",
    "as the clouds transit the line of sight , we assume they obscure the intrinsic disc , intrinsic soft excess and coronal emission .",
    "we do not obscure the reflected or reprocessed emission , since we assume these are predominantly from the clouds .",
    "13 shows the resulting soft and hard band light curves ( left and right respectively ) .",
    "the top panels show the original simple nls1 model with no occultations .",
    "these light curves have power spectra that match the hard and soft band power spectra of the simple nls1 pg1244 + 026 .",
    "in the subsequent panels we increase the number of occulting clouds ( @xmath27 , @xmath28 ) .",
    "the occultations are most obvious in the hard band , where the flux drops are conspicuously narrower than in the soft band , due to the smaller physical size of the corona compared to the more extended soft band components .",
    "these occultations add power to the light curve .",
    "the most heavily occulted hard band light curve ( bottom right panel ) shows peaks and deep troughs more typical of a complex nls1 .",
    "14 shows the power spectra , lag - frequency spectra and coherence between hard and soft bands for the same three simulations . comparing the hard band power spectra ( fig .",
    "14a , dashed lines ) of the original model ( black ) with the most heavily obscured model ( magenta ) shows that occultations have increased the power at @xmath29hz by almost one and a half orders of magnitude .",
    "hard band power spectra of complex nls1s routinely show similarly high power at these frequencies .",
    "thus occultations are more than capable of increasing the hard band high frequency power from @xmath30 typical of a simple nls1 to @xmath31 as is typical of a complex nls1 .",
    "the power increase in the soft band ( solid lines ) is much smaller ( @xmath32 half an order of magnitude ) .",
    "however we have only included occultations at @xmath18 .",
    "higher latitude occultations would add additional power to the soft band , however this power would be uncorrelated with the hard band .",
    "14b shows the lag as a function of frequency between the hard and soft bands .",
    "the black points show the original simple nls1 model , with a strong reverberation lag of @xmath13s at @xmath33hz , matching that seen in pg1244 + 026 . as the number of occultations increases ( blue to magenta ) ,",
    "the maximum measured reverberation lag decreases from @xmath34 to @xmath14s and increases in frequency from @xmath33 to @xmath35hz .",
    "this much shorter reverberation lag , at higher frequency , is much more typical of those seen in complex nls1s such as 1h0707 - 495 . in our model , this is a direct result of the soft leads introduced by the occultations at low frequencies , diluting the reverberation lag and shifting its minimum to higher frequencies .",
    "this is also in good agreement with the findings of kara et al ( 2013 ) , who showed that the reverberation lag of the complex nls1 iras 132243809 is much shorter and at higher frequency during low flux periods ( when in this scenario it would be more obscured ) than high flux periods .",
    "14c shows the coherence between hard and soft bands . as the number of occultations increases , the coherence drops slightly , particularly at low frequencies ( from @xmath36 to @xmath37 ) .",
    "this is due to the slightly different shaped flux drops in the hard and soft bands .",
    "the sudden drop in coherence at @xmath38hz , characteristic of the simple nls1 pg1244 + 026 , becomes less obvious in the more obscured simulations .",
    "the coherence functions of complex nls1s do show a more gradual drop in coherence with increasing frequency , so this is not in disagreement with the data .      in fig .",
    "12 , in grey , we show an example of the total spectrum when the source is highly absorbed . we assume the clouds are the source of the reflected and reprocessed emission , hence these components are not absorbed .",
    "consequently the low flux spectrum is dominated by reprocessed emission at low energies ( @xmath1kev ) and reflected emission at high energies this gives a total spectrum that is no longer power - law like but instead shows strong curvature , with a large soft excess and a strong iron emission line , but the smoking gun signature of highly ionised occultation is the presence of highly ionised fe k@xmath2 absorption lines at 6.7 and 6.95  kev .",
    "the strength of these features is probably underestimated in our model as the zxipcf model used assumes a turbulent velocity of only 200  km / s , which is probably much smaller than expected in a failed wind structure from the inner disc .",
    "strong highly ionised absorption lines are detected in the deep dip states of several complex nls1 such as mrk 766 ( miller et al 2007 ) , mcg6 - 30 - 15 ( miller et al 2008 ) and mrk 335 ( gallo et al 2013 ) .",
    "it is possible that even higher turbulent velocities in the failed wind could merge the 6.7 and 6.95  kev absorption lines into each other , and into the absorption edge , which could produce the more dramatic drop at k@xmath2 in 1h0707 - 495 ( hagino et al , in preparation ) .",
    "our assumption that the clouds do not occult the reflected and reprocessed emission sets a limit to the amount of absorption present in our model .",
    "complex nls1s often show rather stronger drops at low energy , which in this scenario would require that the clouds do also occult part of the failed wind structure or that our reprocessed emission is overestimated due to our models taking only the model flux rather than weighting this by the instrument response .",
    "nonetheless , this model demonstrates the potential of this scenario to match the spectral variability , given a more sophisticated prescription for the reflected / reprocessed flux .",
    "we have shown that occultation of the accretion flow can introduce lags between the hard and soft energy bands .",
    "in particular the occultations generate soft leads at a frequency related to the transit time .",
    "for a transit time of @xmath39s , corresponding to an orbital radius of @xmath20 , these lags predominate at low frequencies ( @xmath40hz for a @xmath41 bh ) .",
    "when combined with a model for the intrinsic variability of the accretion flow , these low frequency soft leads act to dilute the negative reverberation lag , reducing the maximum measured lag and shifting it to higher frequencies , reproducing the trend seen in the data from simple to complex nls1 .",
    "this can plausibly be produced by increasing inclination with respect to a clumpy , turbulent structure above the inner disc .",
    "since nls1s are high accretion rate sources , it is likely that the inner regions of the disc will become puffed up to a large scale height where the local accretion rate exceeds the eddington limit ( e.g. jiang et al 2014 ) , producing a turbulent structure capable of obscuring the innermost regions .",
    "low inclination sources are rarely occulted ( simple nls1 ) , while high inclination ones have multiple occultations ( complex nls1 ) .",
    "the assumed higher inclination for complex nls1s also explains the observed association of extreme ( deep dip ) spectra with warm absorbers .",
    "this is not causal , in that the warm absorbers are not distorting our view of the extreme spectra ( e.g. chiang & fabian 2011 ) , but is instead a consequence of high inclination so that the line of sight is more likely to intercept a wind driven from the torus / flattened broad line region ( blr ) .",
    "importantly , the occultations superimpose highly ionised absorption lines at fek@xmath2 in the dips , as are seen in the data .",
    "we show the evolution of the lag - frequency with increased occultations for a fixed black hole mass of @xmath42 , but this should also depend on black hole mass .",
    "the intrinsic lags / leads in the spectral components should scale simply with mass , as should the occultation timescale .",
    "however , mass for nls1s is hard to determine accurately , as they are accreting close to eddington .",
    "masses estimated from line widths assume the blr clouds are virialised",
    ". however the effective gravity experienced by the clouds will be reduced due to radiation pressure from the central source , leading to an underestimate for masses of nls1s ( marconi et al 2008 ) .",
    "inclination is also another uncertainty , as the blr velocity field is not completely virialised , but contains a clear equatorial component ( e.g. collin et al 2006 ; kollatschny & zetzl 2013 ; pancoast et al 2014 ) . any equatorial component to the velocity field",
    "will be suppressed in low inclination ( simple ) nls1s , so their masses will be systematically biased towards higher values compared to high inclination ( complex ) nls1s .",
    "leighly ( 1999 ) give the fwhm for the h@xmath43 line widths in pg1244 + 026 and 1h0707 - 495 as 830 and 1050 km / s , respectively .",
    "these are corrected for feii and have the narrow h@xmath43 component subtracted assuming that this is @xmath44 the [ oiii ] line intensity ( see also leighly & moore 2004 ) .",
    "both sources have intrinsic optical luminosities which are very similar , so these give masses which are @xmath45 and @xmath46 , respectively ( nikolajuk et al 2009 ) .",
    "the two object masses may be even closer if the inclination dependence discussed above is important . an eddington correction to the mass of pg1244",
    "+ 026 increases the mass estimate to @xmath42 ( done et al 2013 ) , but this should also be similar for 1h0707 - 495 . hence , while there are large uncertainties on masses for nls1s , these two objects should be very similar . at this larger mass , pg1244 +",
    "026 is at the eddington limit for a low spin black hole ( done et al 2013 ) . a lower mass and/or higher spin pushes the system to higher eddington fractions , so making it even less likely that the disc is flat .    our model is more of a pilot study than a complete description .",
    "obvious improvements are to include general relativistic effects of light bending on the disc image ( fig .",
    "1a ) , e.g. middleton & ingram ( 2014 ) , miniutti et al ( 2014 ) . this would be most important for the central coronal regions as the far side of this small source always has a small impact parameter with the black hole .",
    "this would make the corona appear larger , so a @xmath47 cloud may not occult the entire corona . as a consequence",
    "the coronal flux drops would not be quite as narrow and deep and this would reduce the difference between the total amount of power added to the hard and soft bands .",
    "complex nls1s do show more power in the hard band than the soft band ( zoghbi et al 2011 ) at all frequencies , unlike the simple nls1 pg1244 + 026 , which shows comparable power at low frequencies in the hard and soft bands .",
    "our occultation model replicates this , since occultations add power to both bands .",
    "however the small size of the corona necessarily adds much more power to the hard band . including light - bending ( or a smaller cloud size )",
    "would slightly lessen this difference , in better agreement with the data .",
    "the model presented here is in some way a composite between the previous extreme relativistic reflection models and partial covering models .",
    "it follows the partial covering model in identifying absorption ( as opposed to light bending ) events as the origin for the deep dips , but has the occulting material be closer to the source ( ten gravitational radii rather than a few tens - hundreds ) , and be more highly ionised .",
    "reflection does make an important contribution to the spectrum during the dips in our model , but it is not extremely smeared by relativistic effects .",
    "instead , and in a step beyond what is modeled here , we envisage the reflector as a clumpy , turbulent , failed wind rather than a flat keplerian disc ( see also miller et al 2008 )",
    ". the clumps may be only marginally optically thick , so their reflected / scattered emission is not quite the same shape as from @xmath48 ( miller & turner 2013 ) , and they may be embedded in hotter material which comptonises the reflected emission . additionally , the cloud itself could have complex structure due to the ionisation instability of x - ray illuminated material ( krolik , mckee & tarter 1981 ) .",
    "the illuminated face of the cloud will be heated to the local compton temperature ( @xmath49k ) .",
    "temperature decreases at larger depths into the cloud where scattering reduces the heating , so the density must increase to keep in pressure balance .",
    "this lower ionisation state material has more line cooling , so the temperature drops abruptly , giving a sharp transition between a highly ionised skin and a nearly neutral core ( chevalier et al 2006 ) .",
    "reflection from such structures , especially with a turbulent velocity field , may be a feasible way to reproduce the observed 2 - 10  kev spectra in the dips .",
    "another difference between this model and standard relativistic reflection is that we include thermalisation of the illuminating flux .",
    "hard x - rays which are not reflected can either heat the disc and be re - emitted as ( mostly ) thermalised radiation , or the energy can be released as lines / recombination continua .",
    "the relative importance of these two processes depends strongly on the vertical structure of the disc .",
    "thermalisation is more important for discs in hydrostatic equilibrium ( nayakshin et al 2001 ) but current reflection models are calculated for constant density discs ( e.g. ross & fabian 2005 ; garcia et al 2014 ) .",
    "the high disc temperatures expected in nls1s means that this component must be important at some level in contributing to the soft x - ray excess in these objects , and since it is predominantly thermal then it has no strong soft x - rays lines which require high spin to smear them into the observed smooth continuum",
    ".    however , probably the most important effect which should be included in matching to real data is that the light curves in the soft and hard bands are weighted by the detector response rather than being simply flux integrated over the energy band as used here .",
    "this is a key requirement to fit the model to real data , which will be the subject of a subsequent paper .",
    "we have constructed a simple occultation model to investigate whether the change in spectral and timing properties between simple and complex nls1s can be explained by a difference in inclination with respect to a failed wind . in this scenario ,",
    "clumps of material lifted from the inner parts of the accretion disc by radiation pressure , obscure the x - ray emission for sources seen at high inclination angles , resulting in more extreme variability and more complex spectra . associating the deep dips with occultation superimposes absorption features from fek@xmath2 on the dip spectra .",
    "this is seen in complex nls1s such as mrk 776 ( miller et al 2007 ) and is a smoking gun for the reality of these occultation events .",
    "we model the obscuration as a series of individual clouds of constant ionisation parameter which transit the inner accretion flow , co - rotating with the flow and obscure the underlying emission .",
    "the underlying accretion flow emission is radially stratified , with the softest x - rays ( disc ) from the largest radii , and then the soft x - ray excess and corona at progressively smaller radii .",
    "we find that occultations add power to the x - ray light curves over a range of frequencies related to the transit time .",
    "occultations also introduce a lag between the hard and soft energy bands when doppler boosting of the underlying accretion flow emission is taken into account ; specifically occultations introduce a soft lead , with the hard band lagging the soft band .",
    "we then combined our occultation model with the full spectral - timing model of gd14 which describes the accretion flow emission of the simple nls1 pg1244 + 026 .",
    "this model also includes reprocessed emission as part of the soft x - ray excess , as well as reflection from it .",
    "this reproduces the timing properties of pg1244 + 026 by assuming slow fluctuations are generated in the outer components and these propagate down to the corona , producing low frequency hard lags .",
    "the high frequency soft lags ( reverberation lags ) are produced predominantly by fast coronal fluctuations being reprocessed in the soft excess wind material rather than by reflection from it .",
    "the effect of the occultations is to dilute the negative reverberation lag and shift it to higher frequencies . by increasing the rate of occultations we can match the change in reverberation lag from the @xmath34s at @xmath50hz seen in the simple nls1 pg1244 + 026 , to the @xmath51s lag at @xmath35hz seen in the complex nls1 1h0707 - 495 .",
    "the lag times and light travel times put into the model are the same in both the obscured and unobscured cases .",
    "the only difference is the presence of occultations .",
    "it is the soft leads caused by the broken symmetry of the ingress and egress of the occultations caused by doppler boosting of the disc emission which result in a shorter net reverberation lag in the obscured case .",
    "the occultations also change the energy spectrum from a simple nls1 , with strong soft excess and a steep power law above 2 kev , to something resembling a complex nls1 , with a prominent iron line from reflection off the soft excess , highly ionised fe k@xmath2 absorption lines and strong spectral curvature .",
    "the short @xmath51s reverberation lags have been taken as evidence for extreme relativistic reflection in complex nls1s . if 50s really is a light travel time this requires reflection from the innermost radii of an accretion disc around a highly spinning bh .",
    "our occultation model shows that this need not be the case .",
    "a short reverberation lag can be the result of a much longer light travel time , diluted and shifted by the soft leads introduced by occulting clouds .",
    "in our model , reflection and reprocessing occurs between @xmath15 and puts no constraints on the spin of the bh . changing inclination then naturally explains the change from smooth spectra to complex spectra , and long lower frequency reverberation lags to shorter higher frequency reverberation lags in simple and complex nls1s .",
    "given that nls1s are high accretion rate sources , it is quite natural to expect that the disc is not flat , that radiation pressure can lift material from the disc which will obscure the central emission for high inclination lines of sight .",
    "this is a promising geometry to explore further .",

    "<S> these are correlated : the strongest fe k features are seen during deep dips in the light curves of complex nls1s . </S>",
    "<S> there are two competing explanations for these features , one where a compact x - ray source on the spin axis of a highly spinning black hole approaches the horizon and the consequent strong relativistic effects focus the intrinsic flux onto the inner edge of a thin disc , giving a dim , reflection dominated spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> the other is that the deep dips are caused by complex absorption by clumps close to the hard x - ray source . </S>",
    "<S> the reflection dominated model is able to reproduce the very short 30s soft lag from reverberation seen in the complex nls1 1h0707 - 495 . </S>",
    "<S> however , it does not explain the characteristic switch to hard lags on longer timescales . instead , a full model of propagating fluctuations coupled to reverberation can explain the switch in the simple nls1 pg1244 + 026 using a low spin black hole . </S>",
    "<S> however pg1244 + 026 has a longer reverberation lag of @xmath0s .    here we extend the successful propagation - reverberation model for the simple nls1 pg1244 + 026 to include the effect of absorption from clumps in a turbulent region above the disk . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting occultations of the inner accretion flow can introduce additional hard lags when relativistic effects are taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> this dilutes the soft lag from reverberation and shifts it to higher frequencies , making a smooth transition between the 200s lags seen in simple nls1s to the 30s lags in complex nls1s . </S>",
    "<S> these two classes of nls1 could then be determined by inclination angle with respect to a clumpy , probably turbulent , failed wind structure on the disc .    </S>",
