    "generating high - energy ion beams by irradiating a solid target with an ultra - intense laser pulse has many potential applications from medicine to controlled nuclear fusion  @xcite .",
    "while different mechanisms of ion acceleration have been demonstrated , ion acceleration at currently available laser intensities mainly follows from the plasma expansion driven by the hot , laser - created , electrons  @xcite .",
    "experimentally , protons with energy up to 70  mev have already been produced  @xcite . however , controlling their energy distribution remains a crucial problem and alternative acceleration mechanisms are considered to overcome this issue  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we revisit ion acceleration from a double - layer target and propose a new laser - based acceleration scheme that allows an excellent control of the ion beam properties .",
    "this mechanism relies on the complete expulsion of electrons from an ultra - thin double - layer target by laser radiation pressure .",
    "the target is almost instantaneously transformed into a capacitor - like structure , where the ions of the first layer and the electron cloud play the role of the anode and cathode , respectively . a strong , quasi - homogeneous , electrostatic field ( @xmath0 )",
    "is built up between the two layers .",
    "the ions of the second layer , with a larger charge - over - mass ratio , are then accelerated in a way similar to ions in a conventional linear accelerator .",
    "later on , once electrons escape from the ion layers , light ions can gain further energy in the electrostatic field of the bare first ion layer .",
    "two - dimensional ( 2d ) particle - in - cell ( pic ) simulations and an analytical model show that high - energy ( @xmath1  mev ) ion beams can be generated over a few laser periods only .",
    "these beams are characterized by small and adjustable energy ( @xmath2 ) and angular ( @xmath3 ) dispersions , which makes them suitable for applications such as hadron - therapy .",
    "double - layer targets for laser - based ion acceleration have recently attracted a lot of attention as they allow to control the energy dispersion of the accelerated ions  @xcite .",
    "the first target layer is usually made of heavy ions with mass @xmath4 ( @xmath5 is the proton mass ) and charge @xmath6 . the second target layer ( or a small dot placed at the rear - side of the first layer ) consists of ions with a larger charge - over - mass ratio ( @xmath7 ) . in what follows ,",
    "we denote by @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 the atomic density , thickness and transverse size of the first layer , respectively .",
    "similarly , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 denote the corresponding parameters for the second target layer or structured dot ( if @xmath14 ) . for the sake of simplicity , all quantities in this paper are expressed in normalized units : masses , charges , densities and distances are normalized to the electron mass @xmath15 , electron charge @xmath16 , critical density @xmath17 ( @xmath18 is the permittivity of vacuum and @xmath19 is the laser frequency ) and inverse laser wave number @xmath20 ( @xmath21 is the light velocity ) , respectively . in addition , the laser field amplitude @xmath22 , as well as all other electric fields , are given in units of the compton field @xmath23 .",
    "when irradiated by an intense laser pulse ( @xmath24 ) , the target ( or a part of the target ) is quickly ionized .",
    "electrons are expelled from the target , and a strong electrostatic field is built - up .",
    "light ions of the second layer are accelerated in this field .",
    "the condition for generation of quasi - monochromatic , well - collimated , light ion beams is simply that the accelerating electrostatic field remains quasi - homogeneous over the second target layer during the acceleration process  @xcite . in this paper , we revisit ion acceleration from a double - layer target in the regime where the laser radiation pressure effectively expels all electrons from the target .",
    "two - dimensional simulations are performed using the pic code calder  @xcite .",
    "a laser pulse with field amplitude @xmath25 is focused at normal incidence on an ultra - thin ( @xmath26 ) double - layer target .",
    "a circularly polarized laser pulse with flat - top temporal intensity profile is used in order to make electron sweeping by the laser radiation pressure more efficient  @xcite .",
    "the pulse duration is @xmath27 ( 10 optical cycles ) only . along the transverse @xmath28direction",
    ", the laser intensity follows a 6-th order super - gaussian profile .",
    "two values for the laser focal - spot full - width at half - maximum have been considered : @xmath29 and @xmath30 ( 10 and 20 laser wavelengths , respectively ) . the first target layer is made of fully ionized carbon ( @xmath31 ) with atomic density @xmath32 and thickness @xmath33 .",
    "its transverse size is @xmath34 ( @xmath35 30 laser wavelengths ) , which is also the transverse size of the simulation domain .",
    "a likewise fully ionized hydrogen dot ( @xmath36 , @xmath37 ) with transverse size @xmath38 ( one laser wavelength ) and thickness @xmath39 is placed at the rear - side of the first layer .",
    "two atomic densities , @xmath40 and @xmath41 , have been considered for the hydrogen dot .",
    "the simulations results are summarized in figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] and  [ fig2 ] .",
    "four laser - periods after the beginning of the interaction , all electrons in a region with diameter @xmath42 irradiated by the laser pulse have been removed from the target ( fig .",
    "[ fig1]a ) .",
    "in contrast to previous works  @xcite where electrons are strongly heated and generate an accelerating sheath at the target rear - side , electrons here form a compact bunch that propagates with the front of the laser pulse .",
    "the target then exhibits a capacitor - like structure and a quasi - homogeneous electrostatic field is built up between the bare heavy ion layer and the electron bunch ( fig .",
    "[ fig1]d ) .",
    "light ions are accelerated in this electrostatic field and can reach high energies in a few optical cycles only . in fig .",
    "[ fig2]b , the light ion energy @xmath43 is shown as a function of time .",
    "four optical cycles after the beginning of the interaction , protons have already reached @xmath44 ( blue line , square ) .    due to the quasi - homogeneity of the accelerating field , both relative energy dispersion @xmath45 and aperture angle @xmath46 remain small ( figs .",
    "[ fig2]b and  [ fig2]c ) .",
    "moreover , both of them are , at this stage of the acceleration process , sensitive to the charge density in the proton dot : the electrostatic repulsion between the protons themselves is therefore the main source of energy and angular dispersion .",
    "this early stage of proton acceleration is maintained as long as the distance between the electron cloud and the bare heavy ion layer remains small compared to their transverse size @xmath47 . at the end of this stage ( at @xmath48 for the smaller laser focal spot and @xmath49 for the larger one ) , protons with energies of the order of 200  mev and 480  mev ,",
    "respectively , have been produced .",
    "later on , the electrostatic field seen by the protons strongly decreases due to geometrical effects ( figs .",
    "[ fig1]b , c , e , f and  [ fig2]a ) and the acceleration process slows down ( fig .",
    "[ fig2]b ) .",
    "figure  [ fig2]b also shows that , while the proton energy in the early stage of ion acceleration does not depend on the transverse width @xmath50 of the laser focal spot , increasing @xmath50 allows to enhance the final proton energy by delaying multi - dimensional effects .",
    "furthermore , this later stage is associated with a slight increase of both the energy and angular dispersion of the proton bunch ( figs .",
    "[ fig2]c and  [ fig2]d ) .",
    "this is the sign that both dispersions result from electrostatic repulsion in the proton dot itself , which evolves on a time scale different from that of the acceleration process .",
    "nevertheless , for the lower hydrogen density ( @xmath40 ) , energy and angular dispersion seem to saturate at the end of the simulation to values not exceeding @xmath51 and @xmath52 , respectively . finally , we point out that while @xmath53 is only slightly sensitive to the transverse size of the laser pulse , @xmath54 is decreased for the larger focal spot .",
    "this prompts us to suggest that the transverse inhomogeneity of the accelerating field also plays a role in the proton angular dispersion .     at the position of the proton bunch ;",
    "( b )  the proton energy @xmath43 ; ( c )  the energy dispersion @xmath53 ; ( d )  the angular aperture @xmath54 . for @xmath40 , @xmath55 ( blue , square ) , @xmath41 , @xmath55 ( green , triangle ) and @xmath40 , @xmath56 ( black , circle ) .",
    "dashed curves account for analytical predictions of sec .",
    "[ sec_model ] .",
    "note that in panels  ( a ) and  ( b ) the blue and green curves are superimposed.,width=264 ]",
    "on the contrary to previous studies  @xcite , the acceleration mechanism discussed here relies on the complete and directed expulsion of all electrons from the double - layer target .",
    "this occurs if the laser radiation pressure @xmath57 is sufficient to overcome both the electron thermal pressure , and the maximal electrostatic pressure @xmath58 resulting from complete electron - ion separation .",
    "the electrostatic field @xmath59 , where @xmath60 and @xmath61 , is the electrostatic field between the bare ion layers and the electron cloud . using a circularly polarized laser pulse allows to maintain the electron temperature to a rather low level  @xcite , so that one obtains the simple condition for complete electron removal @xmath62 .",
    "this condition defines a threshold for the laser field amplitude @xmath63 beyond which electrons are removed from the target and propagate as a compact bunch at the front of the laser pulse  @xcite .",
    "previous numerical simulations show that early light ion acceleration ( typically for @xmath64 ) is one - dimensional ( 1d ) .",
    "it occurs in a monotonically increasing accelerating field that preserves the order of the different ion sheets that make up the light ion layer .",
    "light ions therefore see a constant accelerating field whose amplitude depends only on their initial position .",
    "the light ion mean energy @xmath43 and energy dispersion @xmath65 ( in units of @xmath66 ) can thus be computed exactly  @xcite : @xmath67\\ , , \\\\",

    "\\sqrt{1+t^2/t_r^2}\\right]\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the index linpa accounts for linear plasma acceleration ( with obvious analogy to conventional acceleration techniques ) , and @xmath68 denotes the time over which light ions gain relativistic energies . for @xmath69",
    ", they behave classically and the mean energy and relative energy dispersion are @xmath70 and @xmath71 , respectively .",
    "if light ions experience the field @xmath72 over a time @xmath73 , they gain ultra - relativistic energies @xmath74 , and their relative energy dispersion simply reads @xmath75 .",
    "these analytical estimates are compared to the 2d simulation results of sec .",
    "[ sec_2dpic ] . in the first stage of the acceleration process ,",
    "light ions see a constant accelerating field @xmath76 ( fig .",
    "[ fig2]a ) .",
    "the resulting temporal evolution of the ion energy @xmath43 as predicted by eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) is in excellent agreement with the numerical results during the first acceleration stage ( figs .",
    "[ fig2]b ) .",
    "a good agreement is also found between the predicted value of @xmath77 and numerical results ( fig .",
    "[ fig2]c ) .",
    "in particular , @xmath78 is kept small by ensuring that the accelerating field @xmath79 remains large compared to @xmath80 , which determines the ratio of the areal charges of both ion layers , and limits the brightness of the resulting ion source .",
    "the 1d behavior of light ion acceleration breaks down once the electron cloud is separated from the heavy ion layers by a distance of the order of its transverse size @xmath81 .",
    "because electrons leave the target at a velocity close to @xmath21 , this defines a characteristic time @xmath82 over which the capacitor - like acceleration is maintained . on longer times , electrons eventually escape from the ion layers , and their contribution to the later stage of the ion acceleration process can be neglected .",
    "light ions thus can gain further energy in the electrostatic field due to the bare heavy ion layer in a way similar to the so - called directed coulomb explosion ( dce )  @xcite . assuming @xmath83 , the energy gained during this later stage can be derived from the conservation of the total light ion energy : @xmath84 the first term in the right - hand - side of eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) is similar to estimates obtained in ref .",
    "the second term accounts for the fact that , in contrast to what occurs in `` classical '' dce , part of the light ions potential energy has already been transformed into kinetic energy in the first acceleration stage .",
    "as suggested by our numerical simulations , energy dispersion during this later stage mainly follows from the electrostatic repulsion between the accelerated light ions . a first attempt to estimate this effect is given in ref .",
    "@xcite , however , the method used there is not correct . here",
    ", we propose to estimate the energy dispersion by considering the ion bunch at the end of its acceleration stage as an homogeneously charged sphere with radius @xmath85 , expanding due to its own charge @xmath86 ( in units of @xmath87 ) .",
    "the final energy dispersion can then be derived as a function of the final ion energy @xmath43 : @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the initial potential energy of a light ion on the outer shell of the sphere .",
    "a question arises from previous calculations : which of the two accelerating stages provides the main contribution to the light ion acceleration ? by comparing eqs .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) and  ( [ eq3 ] ) , one obtains that ions with the final energy @xmath90 gain most of their energy during the later , dce - like , acceleration stage . for these ions ,",
    "the final energy is @xmath91 and energy dispersion @xmath92 follows mainly from coulomb repulsion .",
    "both quantities can be controlled by adjusting the target parameters . moreover , since @xmath81 , the condition for electron removal , @xmath93 , defines a threshold for the laser power and we obtain that the light ion energy scales as @xmath94 .",
    "in contrast to that , more energetic ions ( in particular relativistic ions ) quickly separate from the heavy ion layer so that they gain most of their energy during the early , linpa , stage . using @xmath82 and @xmath95 , eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) can be rewritten as a function of the laser power .",
    "one then obtains a threshold power , @xmath96 , above which relativistic ions with energy @xmath97 are expected .",
    "hadron - therapy is certainly one of the most appealing applications of laser - created ion beams .",
    "it typically requires ions with energy of the order of 200  mev / nucleon . for such energies , @xmath98 , both stages of the acceleration process are important ( see sec .",
    "[ scaling ] ) . the final energy and energy dispersion",
    "are thus obtained from eqs .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) and  ( [ eq3 ] ) and eqs .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) and  ( [ eq4 ] ) , respectively .",
    "we now give the characteristic parameters of a target designed for generation of high - quality proton or carbon ion beams . for given ion energy ( let us say 200  mev per nucleon ) and charge - over - mass ratio ,",
    "the quantity @xmath99 is fixed . considering @xmath100 ( 10 laser wavelengths ) , we obtain that accelerating field amplitudes @xmath101 and @xmath102 are required to create the proton and carbon ion beams , respectively . for proton acceleration , a nanometric ( @xmath103  nm - thick considering a @xmath104-laser wavelength ) , fully - ionized , diamond - like carbon foil at solid density can be used as a first layer to generate such an accelerating field . for carbon ion beam generation ,",
    "a gold target is here considered .",
    "assuming partial ionization of the gold atoms ( @xmath105 ) , the required target thickness is @xmath106  nm .",
    "the second ion layer transverse width @xmath107 ( two laser wavelengths ) is chosen @xmath108 in order to minimize the transverse inhomogeneity of the accelerating field . considering @xmath109",
    ", we finally obtain from eqs .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) and  ( [ eq4 ] ) that coulomb repulsion between the accelerated ions limits the accelerated charge @xmath86 to @xmath110  pc for protons and @xmath111  pc for carbon ions per shot .",
    "we would like to stress that this limitation is generic to short , non - neutral ion bunches .    in order to ensure that the laser radiation pressure is sufficient to remove all electrons from the target ,",
    "laser intensities above @xmath112 and @xmath113 ( correspondingly laser powers exceeding 360  tw and 1.5  pw , and laser energies of a few tens of j ) are required depending on whether one considers proton or carbon ion acceleration . to accelerate a sufficient number of ions , repetition rates in the khz - domain are necessary .",
    "in summary , the generation of quasi - monochromatic , well - collimated , light ion beams from a nanometric double - layer target is discussed in the regime where the laser radiation pressure is sufficient to remove all electrons from the target .",
    "the resulting ion acceleration , which is shown to occur in two steps , is described using 2d pic simulations and an analytical model .",
    "both , the light ion source energy and energy dispersion are shown to depend mainly on the target design .",
    "on the contrary to previous findings , we show that the light ion source energy dispersion depends mainly on the electrostatic repulsion in the accelerated bunch itself , which limits the source brightness .",
