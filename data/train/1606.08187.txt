    "ultrahigh intensity laser - matter interaction attracts much attention , first of all , due to the fast development in laser technology @xcite . at extremely high laser intensity",
    "the quantum - electrodynamical ( qed ) effects start to play a key role . among them",
    "are : photon emission by electrons and positrons with strong recoil , photon decay in strong electromagnetic field with electron - positron pair creation ( breit - wheeler process ) , bethe - heitler process , trident process , etc @xcite .",
    "the laser - matter interaction in the qed - dominated regime leads to manifestation of new phenomena like prolific production of gamma - rays and electron - positron pairs @xcite , laser - assisted qed cascading @xcite , radiation trapping of the charged particles @xcite etc .    in this paper",
    "we focus on laser - plasma interaction in the hole - boring ( hb ) regime when the light pressure pushes plasma inside the target @xcite .",
    "the hole - boring front can be introduced as a plasma - vacuum interface propagating towards the target .",
    "the front separates the vacuum region from the high density plasma .",
    "the hb front structure is as follows .",
    "the laser pressure pushes the electrons ahead thereby forming the sheath with the unshielded ions and the thin , dense electron layer .",
    "reflection and absorption of the laser light by the electron layer provides efficient laser pressure .",
    "the charge separation generates strong longitudinal electric field that , on the one hand , accelerates the ions towards the target and , on the other hand , suppress the electron acceleration by the laser pressure .",
    "laser radiation and the plasma ions mostly contribute into the energy - monetum budget .",
    "the hb front velocity can be derived from the equation for the energy - monetum flux balance @xcite    @xmath2    where    @xmath3    @xmath4 is the normalized laser field strength , @xmath5 is the critical plasma density , @xmath6 is the density of the plasma ions , @xmath7 is the laser frequency , @xmath8 is the ion mass , @xmath9 is the speed of light , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the electron charge and mass , respectively .",
    "it follows from eqs .",
    "( [ vhb ] ) and ( [ mu ] ) that the hb front velocity increases with increasing of the laser intensity and decreasing of the plasma density .",
    "the electrons in the laser field can emit high energy photons and if the laser intensity is high enough then the portion of the laser energy converted into the gamma ray energy is large @xcite so that the fluxes of the emitted gamma - photons has to be taken into account in the energy - monetum flux budget @xcite .",
    "it is demonstrated @xcite that the efficient generation of gamma - rays reduces the laser reflection and the hb front velocity .",
    "another effect accompanying the ultrahigh intensity laser - solid interaction is electron - positron pair creation @xcite .",
    "the pairs can be created because of breit - wheeler process .",
    "avalanche - like production of electron - positron pairs and gamma photons is possible at qed cascading @xcite .",
    "a cascade develops as a sequence of elementary qed processes : photon emission by the electrons and positrons in the laser field alternates with pair production because of photon decay .",
    "a cloud or cushion of pair plasma in the laser pulse in front of the target has been observed in numerical simulations @xcite . as the pair number becomes great ,",
    "there is back reaction of the self - generated pair plasma on the laser - solid interaction .",
    "it has been demonstrated @xcite that the produced pair plasma dramatically enhances laser field absorption and gamma - ray emission thereby reducing the hb front velocity .",
    "the pair motion in the combined laser and plasma fields with radiation reaction is rather complex that makes analytical treatment of pair plasma kinetics difficult . the analytical model for pair cushion in the nonlinear regime when the reflection of the laser pulse is strongly suppressed by the self - generated pair plasma has been recently proposed @xcite .",
    "in our work we study the pair production in the regime when the number of the produced pairs is not sufficient to suppress laser reflection and to affect the laser - foil interaction .",
    "this is the case , for example , for interaction between extremely intense laser pulse and thin foils or for early stage of the laser interaction with thick solid target .",
    "the results of three dimensional particle - in - cell monte carlo ( 3d pic - mc ) simulations demonstrating the hb effect at interaction between a circularly polarized laser pulse and a foil are shown in fig .  1 .",
    "pic - mc simulations including emission of hard photons and electron - positron pair production allow us to analyze the hb process at extremely high intensities .",
    "a similar numerical approach has been used in a number of works ( see , e. g. @xcite ) . to distill the physics of pair production and pair dynamics we consider extremely intense laser pulses .",

    "the electron - positron pairs are produced from the photons emitted by the foil electrons .",
    "this stage can be described as follows .",
    "the laser pulse propagating in the positive direction of @xmath36-axis is reflected by the dense electron layer at the hb front .",
    "the layer electrons in a laser field emit a number of hard photons propagating in the same direction .",
    "the hb front outrun the photons emitted at the large angle to the @xmath36-axis so after that the photons move in vacuum region in the field of the incident and reflected laser radiation . in the hb front reference frame ( `` hb - frame '' ) these photons after escaping from plasma moves in the vacuum region in the negative direction of @xmath36-axis in the field of the circularly polarized standing wave . the structures , which are close to a counter - propagating wave or a standing wave , are efficient for pair creation @xcite so that the photons decay and produce electron - positron pairs .",
    "in the second stage the number of pairs becomes so great that the number of high - energy photons emitted by the pairs exceeds the number of the external photons emitted by the foil electrons . in this case self - sustained qed cascade develops in the standing wave . in the final , third stage",
    "there is the back reaction of the self - generated electron - positron plasma on the laser - foil interaction .",
    "the electron - positron plasma becomes so dense that the significant part of the laser energy is absorbed by the pairs . in this paper",
    "we focus on the first two stages .",

    "[ a1840 ] that for strong laser field with @xmath22 the most of the positrons are created in front of the foil near the first magnetic node of the standing wave because the most of the photons , which are emitted from the foil and initiating the cascade , decay already in the first period of the standing wave . in this case the pair production effects dominate over the pair drift so that the number of the pairs produced at the magnetic nodes is higher than that drift to the electric nodes @xcite . in other words ,",
    "the time of the particle doubling is less than the time which takes for the the particles to pass from a magnetic node to the neighboring electric nodes .",
    "for @xmath19 the probability of the pair production is lower than for @xmath22 and the positrons are located in the several wavelengths in front of the foil near the electric and magnetic nodes ( see fig .",
    "[ a1000 ] ( c ) ) that is in the qualitative agreement with the predictions formulated in the previous section . small shift of the maximums of the density profile from the exact position of the nodes can be caused by fact that the reflection is not perfect so that the wave in the hb - frame is not exactly standing .",

    "it is demonstrated that numerous electron - positron pairs are produced in the hole - boring regime of interaction between a foil and laser pulse with intensities higher than @xmath0w @xmath1 .",
    "the pair production scenario can be roughly divided into three stages : ( i ) cascade initiation by the photons emitted from the foil electrons ; ( ii ) self - sustained qed cascading in the standing wave ; ( iii ) the back reaction of the produced pair plasma on the laser - foil interaction . in the first two stages",
    "the pairs are mainly located in the vacuum region in front of the foil where the incident and reflected laser waves interfere . when the number of the produced electron - positron pairs is not very large the field structure in the vacuum region is close to the standing circularly polarized wave in the hole - boring front reference frame .",
    "the electron - positron plasma is mainly produced as a result of qed cascading in the standing wave .    the analytical model for the dynamics of the electrons and positrons in the rotating electric field with radiation reaction",
    "is extended to the rotating electric and magnetic fields which are parallel to each other .",
    "the model proposed by zeldovich @xcite predicts the stationary trajectory attracting the electron trajectories in the rotating electric field when the radiation reaction is strong . on such trajectory",
    "the work done by the electric field is balanced by the radiative losses .",
    "the particle performs circular motion and the energy balance is controlled by the phase shift between the electric field and the particle velocity . in the case of the rotating electric and magnetic fields , which are parallel to each other , the stationary trajectory also exists and is helical - like with infinite motion along the axis perpendicular to the plane of the field rotation .",
    "the dynamics in the circularly polarized standing wave is more complex @xcite .",
    "moreover , the particle motion can be stochastic and the attractor accumulating the trajectories in the phase space is located only at the electric node .",
    "the attractors are recently studied in the field of standing waves of various configurations @xcite .",
    "our model allows one to calculate the particle trajectory near the magnetic node of the standing wave .",
    "it is shown that the trajectory of the electron and positrons near the magnetic node is close to the stationary trajectory in the local electric and magnetic fields .",
    "the model includes the qed effect of the radiation reaction suppression because of the reduction of the total power radiated by the particle in the quantum regime @xcite .",
    "the calculated trajectories are used to analyze the positron density distribution in the standing wave .",
    "it follows from the model that the positron density peaks at the nodes and antinodes of the standing wave because the electron - positron pairs are mainly produced at the magnetic nodes as the cascade growth rate peaks there and the produced pairs drift to the electric nodes as the magnetic nodes are unstable for them .",
    "the positron distribution in @xmath36-@xmath87 plane is sawtooth - like and the longitudinal velocity of the positrons is equal to hb - front velocity at the magnetic nodes . near the electric nodes the motion of the electrons and positrons is close to the superposition of the drift and the rotation so that the longitudinal velocity varies within the wide range .",
    "this is in agreement with the results of the numerical simulations .    in the case of high laser intensity ( @xmath22 ) the density peaks at the magnetic node closest to the hb front .",
    "the reason is that the high - energy photons emitted by the foil electrons decay rapidly and can not initiate cascade far from the hb - front .",
    "the number of the pairs in the in the electric nodes is much smaller than that in the magnetic ones because near the magnetic node the pair production rate dominates over the pair loss rate due to the drift .    the first stage representing the cascade initiation is not pronounced in fig .",
    "one of the reason is that the number of the high - energy photons emitted by the electron layer is not very large because the laser field is strongly suppressed in the layer and the layer electrons are not accelerated so efficiently as the positrons and the secondary electrons in the vacuum region in front of the foil .",
    "therefore the number of the high - energy photons emitted by the pairs and participating in cascading will exceed the number of the photons emitted by the foil electrons in very short period of time so that the duration of the first stage may be small .    when the pair number becomes great",
    "the produced electron - positron plasma can absorb the laser radiation and affect the dynamics of the laser - foil interaction .",
    "the manifestation of such nonlinear stage ( the third stage ) can been seen in figs .",
    "[ a1000](a ) and [ a1840](a ) where the standing wave is slightly attenuated towards the hb front .",
    "the transition between the second and the third stage can be seen in fig .",
    "[ n ] as a saturation of the pair number growth .",
    "the transition occurs at @xmath214 for @xmath19 and for @xmath215 for @xmath22 .",
    "the analytical model of the third stage has been proposed in ref .",
    "it is based on one - dimensional solutions of the two - fluid ( electron - positron ) and maxwell equations , including a classical radiation reaction term .",
    "the model predicts the vacuum gap with the standing wave structure between the pair `` cushion '' and the targets .",
    "however the model verification by self - consistent numerical simulations is still absent and the detailed analysis of the third stage with back reaction is needed ."
