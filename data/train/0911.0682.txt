    "[ lnevsn ] .",
    "it is noteworthy that the total energy of the pairs produced add up to @xmath110 by virtue of the delta function constraint in eq ( 24 ) .",
    "commonly in quantum mechanics , perturbations at frequency @xmath39 produce excitations with energy @xmath111 ( as for example in optical transitions in atomic physics ) . here",
    "excitations with energies equal to all multiples of the fundamental frequency are produced ( although in practice the higher harmonic production may be small except in an ultra - relativistic limit ) .",
    "this situation is also encountered in laboratory scale phenomena such as mossbauer spectroscopy and the excitation of conduction electrons by the motion of impurities in metals .",
    "mathematically the appearance of excitations at higher harmonics is traceable to the fourier expansion eq ( 17 ) .    in the next sub - section , using the formalism developed in appendix  [ appendixframe ] , we re - analyze ab radiation from an oscillating solenoid for arbitrary values of the ab phase , @xmath112 , but in the limit of small @xmath106 .",
    "we recover the periodicity of the result as a function of ab phase .",
    "we also show that the results of the two different methods agree in the limit that both @xmath112 and @xmath106 are small .",
    "now let us consider the circumstance that the flux is not a small perturbation . in this case we can still obtain analytic results for particle production in the limit that the solenoid motion is non - relativistic .",
    "these results are non - perturbative in the flux and show the flux periodicity expected of the aharonov - bohm effect .",
    "moreover , the small flux limit of the results obtained in this section match the low velocity limit of the results in the previous section .",
    "the essential physics here is that for a stationary solenoid the eigenmodes of the scalar field depend ( periodically ) on the flux @xmath2 of the solenoid .",
    "if the solenoid is moved to a different location the eigenmodes and hence the quantum vacuum is altered . if the solenoid is moved slowly from the initial to the final configuration , in the adiabatic approximation it will simply pass from the initial vacuum to the final vacuum , but post - adiabatic corrections lead to particle production .",
    "the technical implementation of this idea is relegated to appendix  [ appendixframe ] where we analyze the leading post - adiabatic dynamics of an assembly of oscillators with slowly varying eigenmodes .",
    "we will work in cylindrical co - ordinates and in the `` singular gauge '' where the gauge potential of a static solenoid is @xmath113 here @xmath114 is the heaviside function .",
    "the gauge potential vanishes everywhere on the @xmath115plane and is singular along the positive @xmath116axis .",
    "it is easy to check that the line integral of the gauge potential along a path enclosing the origin yields the flux @xmath2 .",
    "the eigenmodes , @xmath117 , for a scalar field in the background of a solenoid along the @xmath18axis have been found in ref .",
    "we will use those eigenmodes in singular gauge . in order to box normalize the eigenmodes , we adopt periodic boundary conditions along the @xmath118-axis and take the length of the solenoid to be @xmath119 . along the radial direction",
    "we find it convenient to impose dirichlet boundary conditions at @xmath120 ( _ i.e. _ @xmath121 ) if @xmath122 is even , and neumann boundary conditions ( _ i.e. _ @xmath123 ) if @xmath122 is odd .",
    "these boundary conditions are convenient because they allow us to do certain integrals in closed form ; they also give the physical result that the particle production vanishes in the limit that the solenoid flux goes to zero .",
    "the values of @xmath124 now take on discrete values for finite @xmath125 , but the set becomes a continuum in the limit @xmath126 .",
    "then the singular gauge eigenmodes are @xmath127 where @xmath128 , and @xmath4 .",
    "the modes are labelled by the radial momentum @xmath124 , the @xmath118-momentum , @xmath129 , and the azimuthal quantum number @xmath122 .",
    "the frequency of the mode is @xmath130 note that the eigenmodes have a discontinuity along the positive @xmath78-axis .",
    "this is because we are working in singular gauge where the gauge potential is singular on the positive @xmath116axis .",

    "even if the signal is too weak to be used to find strings on the sky , it might be a useful signature to confirm the presence of a string if one is suspected in some field of view .    before closing this section",
    "it is important to point out that our estimate treats all kinks equally whereas copeland and kibble @xcite emphasize that most kinks are nearly straight and it is relevant to consider the sharpness of the kink .",
