    "stability and propagation of waves in viscous accretion disks have been studied extensively for more then thirty years , since the pioneering work of @xcite . adopting the local approximation ,",
    "he has shown that the horizontal @xmath2-mode oscillations of the keplerian isothermal disk become over - stable when a small viscosity of the fluid is introduced .",
    "the instability arises because the azimuthal component of the viscous force varies in phase with the azimuthal velocity during oscillations and thus a positive work on the oscillations is done .",
    "the source of the energy for the oscillations is the angular momentum flowing radially in the background flow . under suitable conditions , given mainly by the temperature and density dependence of viscosity and also by the mode eigenfrequencies and the shape of the modal eigenfunctions ,",
    "this process may provide energy sufficient to amplify the oscillations against other normal viscous damping processes .",
    "the instability of @xmath2-modes is even stronger in the relativistic disk , where the gradient of the angular velocity is steeper .    later on ,",
    "this problem has been reconsidered by other authors and the analysis has been expanded also to other types of oscillation modes . for example , @xcite studied stability of @xmath2-modes in disks with different ratios of the gas to the radiation pressure , @xcite discussed possibility of viscous excitation of the one - armed corrugation mode in relativistic disks .",
    "the local approximation was released in the work of @xcite , who estimated growth rates of @xmath2-modes trapped near the inner edge of the disk and @xmath3-modes trapped near the radius of the maximum of the radial epicyclic frequency .",
    "some of the analysis go even beyond the standard @xcite prescription that is based on the mixing - length theory . @xcite",
    "considered the effects of an anisotropic viscosity and showed that the growth of the trapped @xmath3-modes is enhanced while that of the @xmath2-modes is suppressed .",
    "perhaps even more advanced is the analysis of @xmath4-mode oscillations in relativistic disks by @xcite who uses the transport equations in calculating the stress tensor perturbations based on his second - order closure scheme .    in this note",
    "we study effects of viscosity on oscillation modes of a slender torus .",
    "the main difference of this configuration from the thin disks studied in the work cited above are the angular momentum profiles that can be significantly different from the keplerian distribution and the following substantial pressure and density gradient in the radial direction ( i.e.  in the same direction as the angular velocity is changing ) .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section [ sec : inviscid - tori ]",
    "a basic theory of inviscid tori and the limit of slender tori are reminded .",
    "the section [ sec : secular - evolution ] deals with the secular evolution of the torus that arises when a small viscosity is introduced to the flow .",
    "the section [ sec : pert ] is devoted to the general discussion of oscillation modes and the effects of viscosity on the oscillation frequencies .",
    "there we derive a general formula for the eigenfrequency shifts which we subsequently apply in sections [ sec : results - special ] and [ sec : results ] .",
    "the section [ sec : results - special ] contains results for the modes of high order and for keplerian tori and the section [ sec : results ] focuses on the lowest - order modes . finally , section [ sec : concl ]",

    "the construction of an inviscid axisymmetric polytropic slender torus is described by @xcite in the newtonian gravitational field and by @xcite in the case of a general axisymmetric gravitational potential .",
    "the fluid of the torus is in pure rotation , e.g. its velocity in the polar coordinates @xmath5 can be expressed as @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the angular velocity .",
    "the shape of the equi - pressure and equi - density surfaces coincide because of the polytropic equation of state , @xmath8 , and can be uniformly described by the lane - embden function @xmath9 .",
    "the density and pressure are then given by @xmath10 and @xmath11 ( the subscript zero indicates the evaluation at the center of the torus , where the density and pressure are maximal ) .",
    "another consequence of using the polytropic equation of state is that the angular velocity is a function of the radial coordinate only , @xmath12 .",
    "in addition , throughout the paper , we assume that this function is slowly varying , i.e.  @xmath13 .",
    "the structure of these surfaces follows from the poloidal part of the euler equation @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the slenderness parameter @xmath16 that gives the thickness of the torus , both the radial and vertical extend of the torus are of the order of @xmath17 .",
    "the limit @xmath18 describes slender tori .",
    "the surfaces of constant pressure and density have elliptic cross - sections , whose centers correspond to the maximal - pressure circle at @xmath19 in the equatorial plane .",
    "it is convenient to introduce dimensionless coordinates @xmath20 and @xmath21 contracting with the torus as @xmath18 , @xmath22 the shapes of the equipressure surfaces are then given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the radial and vertical epicyclic frequencies normalized by @xmath26 and @xmath27 describes distribution of the angular momentum @xmath28 , which is in the slender - torus limit linear .",

    "we obtain again @xmath43 while the toroidal part and the continuity equation gives @xmath44 and @xmath45 the right - hand sides of the latter two equations are of the first order in @xmath0 , these equations therefore describe a slow evolution of the angular momentum and the density on the time scale @xmath46 . on the other hand ,",

    "we have shown that this process occurs on the timescale @xmath153 and can be regarded as a quasi - steady , i.e.  as a series of steady inviscid tori configurations , because the poloidal velocity due to the viscosity is negligible .",
    "we have also found that the angular momentum transport is symmetric , the location of the center of the torus remains unchanged .",
    "this result is related to the reflection symmetry around the @xmath57 surface that appears in the slender torus limit . including the higher - order terms in @xmath16 that break this symmetry , we would likely find a shift of the torus center towards the central object .    in the rest of the paper we dealt with the oscillations of the viscous tori . for simplicity",
    ", we neglected the secular evolution what allowed as to assume the harmonic time dependence of perturbations .",
    "we derived inhomogeneous master equation ( [ eq : pp ] ) with left - hand side giving the normal modes of the inviscid tori and right - hand side describing effects of viscosity on the modes .",
    "we formulated a general first - order perturbation theory for the case when the right - hand side is small and with the aid of this theory we obtained a general formula for the mode growth rates . applying this formula in the short - wave limit",
    ", we have found that the viscosity acts to damp the acoustic modes . on the other - hand",
    "the viscous tori are unstable with respect to the inertial oscillations .",
    "the growth - rate of the instability increases with decreasing wavelength .",
    "we also calculated the damping rates of the acoustic oscillations in the keplerian limit and showed that they agree with the results based on the wkbj theory in the limit of high nodal numbers .",
    "finally we calculated the growth rates of the lowest order modes and explored their behavior with changing various parameters .",
    "we found that the damping of three of four modes is significantly reduced as the angular momentum distribution approaches the keplerian one .",

    "here we deal with a perturbation theory for equation ( [ eq : pp ] ) with the assumption that @xmath0 is small .",

    "therefore they can not change the sign of @xmath106 and we can conclude that the high - order inertial modes grow . moreover , introducing a typical wavelength of the mode @xmath115 , the upper and the lower scalar product can be estimated as @xmath171 and @xmath172 , respectively . hence the growth rate can be estimated as @xmath173",
