    "magnetic ordering of localized spins mediated by nonmagnetic conduction electrons , the so - called double exchange ( de ) or indirect exchange , is the source of a variety of magnetic behavior in transition metal and rare - earth compounds @xcite .",
    "conversely , this interplay affects the mobility of the carriers and may lead to interesting transport properties such as colossal magnetoresistance in manganites .",
    "the origin of the de lies in the intra - atomic coupling of the spin of the itinerant electrons with localized spins @xmath1 . in this coupling , localized and itinerant electrons belong to the same atomic shell .",
    "according to hund s rule , the coupling is ferromagnetic ( f ) when the local spins have less than half - filled shells and anti - ferromagnetic ( af ) for more than half - filled shells @xcite .",
    "this mechanism has been widely used in the context of manganites @xcite .",
    "a similar coupling also occurs in kondo systems via the so - called @xmath2 exchange model . in this case ,",
    "local spins are from a @xmath3 shell ( or @xmath4 shell in rare - earth compounds ) while the conduction electrons are from @xmath5 or @xmath6 states and the coupling is anti - ferromagnetic . in recent literature",
    "the ferromagnetic coupling case is often referred to as the ferromagnetic kondo model . independently of the sign of the coupling , the kinetic \" energy lowering , favors a f background of local spins .",
    "this f tendency is expected to be thwarted by af super - exchange ( se ) interactions between localized spins @xmath1 as first discussed by de gennes @xcite who conjectured the existence of canted states.in spite of recent interesting advances , our knowledge of magnetic ordering resulting from this competition is still incomplete .    although it may look academic , the one - dimensional ( 1d ) version of this model is very illustrative and helpful in building an unifying picture . on the other hand , the number of pertinent real 1d systems as the nickelate one - dimensional metal oxide carrier - doped compound @xmath7@xcite is increasing . in this compound , carriers are essentially constrained to move parallel to @xmath8 chains and a spin - glass - like behavior was found at very low temperature @xmath9 for typical dopings @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "recently , it has been shown that three - leg ladders in the oxyborate system fe@xmath13bo@xmath14 may provide evidence for the existence of spin and charge ordering resulting from such a competition @xcite .",
    "naturally , the strength of the magnetic interactions depends significantly on the conduction band filling , @xmath15 . at low conduction electron density , f polarons",
    "have been found for localized @xmath16 quantum spins batista19982000 .",
    "island  phases , periodic arrangement of f polarons coupled anti - ferromagnetically , have been clearly identified at commensurate fillings both for quantum spins in one dimension @xcite and for classical spins in one koshibae1999 and two dimensions @xcite .",
    "phase separation between hole - undoped anti - ferromagnetic and hole - rich ferromagnetic domains has been obtained in the ferromagnetic kondo model @xcite .",
    "phase separation and small ferromagnetic polarons have been also identified for localized @xmath17 quantum spins @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is of importance to clarify the size of the polarons , and whether it is preferable to have island phases , separate small polarons or eventually large polarons .    in this paper , we present an analytical and numerical study of the one - dimensional double and super - exchange model .",
    "our results provide a plausible understanding of the ground state of the nickelate 1d compound @xmath7 allowing a straightforward explanation of its spin - glass - like behavior ditusakojima .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 a brief description of the model",
    "is given . in section 3 ,",
    "results and a discussion are presented .",
    "finally , our results are summarized in section 4 .",
    "the de  hamiltonian is originally of the form , @xmath18where @xmath19 are the fermions creation ( annihilation ) operators of the conduction electrons at site @xmath20 , @xmath21 is the hopping parameter and @xmath22 is the electronic conduction band spin operator . in the second term",
    ", @xmath23 is the hund s exchange coupling . here",
    ", hund s exchange coupling is an intra - atomic exchange coupling between the spin of conduction electrons @xmath24 and the spin of localized electrons @xmath1 .",
    "this hamiltonian simplifies in the strong coupling limit @xmath25 , a limit commonly called itself the de model .",
    "we will consider the local spins as classical @xmath1 @xmath26 , a reasonable approximation in many cases in view of the similarity of the known results @xcite .",
    "the de hamiltonian takes the well - known form , @xmath27the itinerant electrons being now either parallel or antiparallel to the local spins are thus spinless .",
    "@xmath28 is the relative angle between the classical localized spins at sites @xmath20 and @xmath29 which are specified by their polar angles @xmath30 , @xmath31 defined with respect to a @xmath32-axis taken as the spin quantization axis of the itinerant electrons .",
    "the super - exchange coupling is an anti - ferromagnetic inter - atomic exchange coupling between localized spins @xmath1 .",
    "the complete one - dimensional de+se hamiltonian becomes , @xmath33where @xmath34 and @xmath35 is the super - exchange interaction energy .",
    "in this section , we determine the complete phase diagram in one dimension as a function of the super - exchange interaction energy @xmath35 and the conduction electron density @xmath15 , showing that up to now the model has not revealed all its richness . besides the quantum results already published batista19982000,garcia20002002,neuber2006 we find two types of phase separation .",
    "in addition to the expected f - af phase separation appearing for small @xmath35 , we obtain a new phase separation between small polarons ( one electron within two or three sites ) and af regions for larger @xmath35 .",
    "it is interesting to note that large polarons are never found stable in this limit .",
    "the magnetic phase diagram has been obtained at t=0k by using open boundary conditions on a linear chain of n=60 sites . for a given conduction electron density @xmath15 ( @xmath36 because of the hole - electron symmetry )",
    ", we have to optimize all the n-1 angles @xmath37 . for this goal",

    "a complete analytical solution can be derived in this case .",
    "similar phases p3 and cp3 are obtained for @xmath52 . in cp3 , two angles @xmath50 , @xmath51 are finite inside the 3-site polaron while , between polarons , @xmath53 .",

    "the analytical results for n=60 sites are very close to this line .",
    "when the conduction electron density gets larger @xmath75 the f - af phase separation becomes the f phase .",
    "the size of the ferromagnetic polaron in the thermodynamic limit @xmath76 is @xmath77 for @xmath78 and @xmath79 in the ferromagnetic phase .",
    "an important effect of lattice distortion is expected between these f and af domains @xcite .",
    "the effect of lattice distortion can be studied in the f - af phase separation using the following density matrix elements . inside the f domain",

    "charge distribution is easily obtained for @xmath82 figures fig7cl-[fig5cl ] .",
    "for example in figure [ fig4cl ] , charge distribution of the f phase can be observed for 25 electrons and at @xmath83     ( 3 electrons ) and @xmath65 , showing n-1 angles , charge distribution and a spin configuration snapshot . ]    , but at @xmath84 ( 12 electrons ) . ]    for small se interaction , the f - af phase separation has been reported in two dimensions @xcite , in one dimension using classical localized spins and @xmath85 @xcite and in the one - dimensional ferromagnetic kondo model @xcite .",
    "quantum results for @xmath17 , showed phase separation when coulomb repulsion was taken into account neuber2006 .",

    "below cp3+p2 , the phase labelled t in figure [ fig1cl ] is a more general complex phase obtained by the monte carlo method and can be polaronic like or not .",
    "close to the boundary with cp3+p2 this phase resembles the p3+p2 phase separation , so as seen in figure [ fig1cl ] , the transition line @xmath105 , corresponding to @xmath57 , is second order .",

    "this can be proved analytically in the thermodynamic limit using the expressions we have derived for the different phases , except for the t - phase for which numerical results are necessary . in two - dimension",
