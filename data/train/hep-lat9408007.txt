    "particularly true to the quotes is the field of strong interaction where there has been an intense interplay between theory and experiment .",
    "the advent of quantum chromodynamics(qcd ) , a non - abelian gauge relativistic quantum field theory of quarks and gluons ( the constituents of protons and neutrons ) , in the early seventies has offered the most promising description of strong interaction dynamics and internal structure of hadrons both in logical consistency and in scope@xcite .",
    "it is widely accepted that it is the correct theory of strong interaction .",
    "this acceptance is based on a substantial amount of experimental data accumulated and refined over the last two decades .",
    "it is particularly so for the inclusive scattering processes at large momentum transfer where the perturbative qcd is applicable . on the other hand ,",
    "confirmation of qcd as the fundamental theory of strong interaction has been somewhat hampered by the lack of analytical calculations of the low frequency modes due to the inherent non - perturbative nature of the theory .",
    "the invention of lattice - regularized qcd@xcite with monte carlo methods@xcite holds the promise of circumventing the difficulty of obtaining analytic results via numerical simulation . in the lattice - regularized gauge theory , the continuous space - time is discretized by a finite lattice with a periodic boundary condition . as a consequence",
    ", the infinite dynamic degrees of freedom associated with the space - time is reduced to a finite number which makes numerical analysis feasible . the recent advancement in supercomputer technology and the doe grand challenge award",
    "have made it possible to carry out large scale monte carlo simulations to calculate the hadronic structure and interaction in the framework of lattice qcd .",
    "this allows us to compare the lattice results with the experimental data in a qualitative and semi - quantitative manner which is very valuable in understanding physics from first principles free from the uncertainty of models .    in the present paper",
    ", we shall report results on the study of the nucleon structure which includes the electromagnetic , axial , pseudoscalar , and scalar form factors and compare them with the known experiments . from the pseudoscalar form factor",

    "the euclidean path integral formulation of quantum field theory is employed to calculate the green s function . in this way , the quantum field theory becomes a problem in classical statistical mechanics .",
    "physical observables are then extracted from the statistical correlation functions of composite operators built on the fundamental dynamical variables in quark and gluon fields . in the following , we present a synopsis of the formalism and related numerical steps .",
    "the correlation functions have the following generic form @xmath7 [ d\\psi ] [ d \\bar{\\psi } ] e^ { - s_{g } - s_{f } }   \\bar{\\psi_{\\alpha } } \\bar{\\psi_{\\beta } } ...   t^{\\alpha \\beta ... } _ { \\alpha^{\\prime } \\beta^{\\prime } ... } ( u ) ...   \\psi_{\\alpha^{\\prime } } \\psi_{\\beta^{\\prime } } ... , \\ ] ] where @xmath8 is the partition function .",

    "one might think of approximating the integral by summing over a sufficiently dense set of mesh points , say 4 per variable .",
    "however , this `` modest '' goal is well beyond the capacity of the existing supercomputers : for a ( small ) @xmath19 lattice , it would require a calculation on @xmath20 points .",
    "instead , one may use the important sampling technique to select a comparatively small subset of gauge configurations @xmath21 among the `` important '' ones , such that the probability of occurrence of a given configuration @xmath22 in this ensemble approaches the desired distribution @xmath23 e^ { - s_g } \\det m[u],\\ ] ] for @xmath24 .",
    "then the quantum average are given(for sufficiently large @xmath25 ) by averages taken over the sample : that is @xmath26 m^{-1}[u_i ] ... t ] \\pm o ( { 1 \\over \\sqrt{n } } ) .\\ ] ]    there are three numerical steps to lattice gauge calculations .",
    "the first step is to prepare an ensemble of gluon configurations @xmath27 in the vacuum .",
    "this is done using the cabibbo - marinari@xcite pseudo - heatbath algorithm , a monte carlo method which generates sets of link matrices @xmath28 according to the distribution in eq.([glue ] ) . in principle , the probability distribution includes a factor of @xmath29)$ ] which represents the effect of quark - antiquark polarization in the vacuum . in the present simulations , we omit this factor as an approximation since it would require more computation than we can do",
    ". we will discuss the validity of this approximation when we come to the results of the calculations . omitting this determinant",
    "is referred to as the quenched approximation .",
    "the second step is to calculate the quark propagator matrix @xmath30 $ ] in the prepared gluon @xmath31 background .",
    "this is done with the conjugate - gradient algorithm@xcite .",
    "this is an iterative scheme which is capable of giving the desired solution to arbitrary accuracy .",
    "we typically find a few hundred iterations to be sufficient .",
    "the last step is to assemble the quark propagator matrices @xmath32 $ ] and the the matrix @xmath33 $ ] defined in eqs .",
    "( [ corr1 ] ) and ( [ corr2 ] ) to evaluate the correlation function in eq.([sum ] ) from which we extract the physical quantities with statistical analysis .",
    "electron and neutrino scatterings off the nucleon target are useful probes of the nucleon internal structure by measuring its electromagnetic and axial form factors",
    ". these form factors can be simulated in the lattice gauge calculation and compared with experiments directly and thereby serve as a test to the monte carlo calculation and the theory as well .",
    "the @xmath0 coupling form factor is a fundamental quantity in the pion - nucleon and nucleon - nucleon dynamics . yet",
    "it is not experimentally accessible directly and is poorly known theoretically . from the calculation of the pseudoscalar form factor , we extract the @xmath0 form factor with pion pole dominance . in this case , it is a prediction from the fundamental theory and will have great help in settling the large uncertainty over the shape and the cutoff of the @xmath0 form factor .",
    "furthermore , there have been sprouting interest in the sea - quark contributions to the nucleon structure , for example , the @xmath5 term , the strange condensate in the nucleon and the flavor - singlet axial charge @xmath34 .",
    "the recent deep inelastic scattering experiment obtained a very small @xmath34 which suggests that most of the spin of the proton does not come from the quark spin which is a great surprise and has been dubbed the `` proton spin crisis '' . since no model we know has a handle on this problem",
    ", we expect the answer to come from the lattice qcd calculation .",
    "the nucleon can be obtained from the following two- and three - point correlation functions @xcite @xmath35 @xmath36 where @xmath37 represents the proton or neutron interpolating field with the dirac component @xmath38 , @xmath39 is a @xmath40 matrix in the dirac space and @xmath41 represents various bilinear quark currents in the form of @xmath42 . by inserting complete sets of states and setting @xmath43 , the lattice spacing , we obtain the electromagnetic form factors @xmath44 and @xmath45 , axail form factor @xmath46 , pseudoscalar form factor @xmath47 , and scalar form factor @xmath48 from the ratios of the three point functions involving corresponding currents to two point functions .",
    "the results corresponding to the physical quark masses are obtained from the extrapolation from those with heavier quarks to the chiral limit where the pion mass is zero .",
    "our results are based on 24 quenched ( ignoring the determinant in eq .",
    "( [ glue ] ) gauge configurations on a @xmath49 lattice and were calculated using the monte carlo cabibbo - marinari pseudo - heatbath algorithm@xcite . the @xmath18 fundamental wilson action was used with periodic boundary conditions and the coupling constant was set at @xmath50 .",
    "the gauge field was thermalized for 5000 sweeps from a cold start and 24 configurations separated by at least 1000 sweeps were saved .",
    "for the quarks we use periodic boundary conditions in the spatial directions and `` fixed '' time boundary conditions , which corresponds to setting the quark couplings across the time edge to zero .",
    "the origin of all quark propagators was chosen to be at lattice time site 5 ; the secondary zero momentum nucleon source was fixed at time site 20 .",
    "we expect that these positions are sufficiently far from the lattice time boundaries to avoid nonvacuum contaminations .",
    "we used the red - black pre - conditioned conjugate - gradient algorithm for the quark propagator . for our convergence criterion we demanded that the absolute sum of the squares of the quark propagators be less than @xmath51 over 5 iterations . as a check of the nucleon secondary source , we verified current conservation for @xmath52 to @xmath53 .",
    "our present space - time lattice with merely the size of @xmath2 gives a quark matrix of the dimension @xmath6 including the spin and color degrees of freedom .",
    "while it is durable to calculate the quark propagator , i.e. @xmath54 for a point source s at 0 with a reasonably small quark mass ( e.g. a fraction of the strange quark mass ) on today s supercomputers , the quark propagator @xmath55 from any point to any point is certainly unattainable . for calculations of the 2-point functions ( eq .",
    "( [ 2pt ] ) and 3-point functions ( eq .",
    "( [ 3pt ] ) with connected insertions for flavor non - singlet currents , one can get by with the help of translational symmetry and uses only @xmath54 .",
    "but there are cases where one can not rely on such a help .",
    "these include the calculations of quark loops which are space - time or space integrations of the fermion propagators .",
    "examples of interest in qcd include the quark condensate and the topological susceptibility with the fermion method , flavor - singlet meson masses which involve disconnected quark loops in the two - point functions , notably the u(1 ) problem . , and the @xmath56 @xmath57 term and the proton spin problem which involve quark loop contributions in the three - point functions .    instead of waiting for the advent of more powerful hardware ,",
    "we have employed the stochastic algorithm with the @xmath3 noise to estimate the quark loops  @xcite .",
    "stochastic approach to estimating the inverse of an @xmath58 matrix m entails the introduction of an ensemble of l column vectors @xmath59 ( each of dimension @xmath60 ) with the properties of a white noise , i.e. @xmath61 the expectation value of the matrix element @xmath62 can be obtained by solving for @xmath63 in the matrix equations @xmath64 with the l noise vectors @xmath65 and then take the ensemble average with the j - th entry of @xmath65 @xmath66 = \\langle \\eta_j x_i\\rangle = \\sum_k m_{ik}^{-1 } \\langle   \\eta_j \\eta_k \\rangle = m_{ij}^{-1}.\\ ] ] which is the matrix element @xmath62 itself .",
    "in fact , it has been shown recently  @xcite that the variance of a inverted matrix element due to the stochastic estimation is composed of two parts    @xmath67 = \\frac{1}{l } \\{[m_{ij}^{-1}]^2 c_2 ^ 2 + \\sum_{k \\neq j } [ m_{ik}^{-1}]^2\\}.\\ ] ]    whereas the second part is independent of the kind of noise used , the first part is proportional to the square of the diagonal error @xmath68 . since @xmath3 , or @xmath69 for that matter , has no diagonal error , i.e. @xmath70 , it produces a * minimum * variance .",
    "other noises will have larger variances due to the non - vanishing @xmath71 .",
    "for example , @xmath72 for the gaussian noise with large and independent configurations .",
    "the question remains as to whether the @xmath3 noise is superior than the other noises on a practical footing with reasonable small l. to answer this question , we have tested the usefulness of the @xmath3 noise against the gaussian noise for small noise configurations l ( @xmath73 ) and smaller quark masses .",
    "plotted in the left column in fig .",
    "1 are the accumulated averages for the estimate of the real part of the diagonal trace @xmath74 as a function of l for the @xmath3 and gaussian noises with wilson hopping parameters @xmath75 and 0.154 for a gauge configuration . with @xmath76",
    ", @xmath77 corresponds to the strange quark mass and @xmath78 corresponds to a mass about half of that .",
    "the straight line is the result from the stochastic estimate at l = 300 .",
    "we see that the estimate from the @xmath3 noise approaches the value at l= 300 ( assumed to be the asymptotic value ) faster than that of the gaussian noise .",
    "the corresponding jackknife errors for different l ( the right column in fig .",
    "1 ) show that the @xmath3 noise is consistently better than the gaussian noise by a factor of two for all three @xmath79 .",
    "this means that to achieve the same level of accuracy for the diagonal trace , one needs statistics for the gaussian noise about 4 times as much as for the @xmath3 noise .",
    "we have also examined the near diagonal trace related to the point - split axial current .",
    "the result is similar to that of the diagonal trace  @xcite .",
    "we have employed the @xmath3 noise to calculate the quark loops in the presence of the nucleon with l = 200 to 300 only .",
    "some of the results will be reported in the next section .",
    "compared with the brute force approach of inverting the whole quark matrix , we have saved the computer time by as much as a factor of 6000 !",
    "it is worthwhile noting that the stochastic estimation is particularly successful for the trace ( denotes as @xmath80 in fig .",
    "this is due to the translational , color and spin symmetries . as a result ,",
    "the error is proportional to @xmath81 where n is the dimension of the matrix . with @xmath82 in our case and the ratio @xmath83 ^ 2 /[m_{11}^{-1}]^2 = 0.8 $ ]",
    ", we predict the error to signal ratio to be @xmath84 from eq .",
    "( [ variance ] ) for l = 1 .",
    "this agrees well with the numerical calculation shown in fig .",
    "1 . given this level of accuracy , it is feasible to apply the stochastic method to the calculation of the determinant , the eigenvalues , and the eigenvectors of the matrix m which might not be feasible with other algorithms .",
    "we present our results in three groups .",
    "the first group includes the electromagnetic and axial form factors where the experimental results are available .",
    "we shall compare them with our calculation directly .",
    "the second group consists of the @xmath0 form factor deduced from the pseudoscalar form factor where is no direct experimental result available .",
    "the third group involves flavor - singlet quantities which require the quark loop calculation with disconnected insertions like the @xmath5 and the strange condensate in the nucleon .      in fig .  2",
    ", we plot the isovector axial form factor extrapolated to the chiral limit for the local current ( l.c . ) and the point - split current ( p - s.c . ) in comparison with the experimental result . in doing so",
    ", we have used the calculated nucleon mass to set the scale for the momentum  @xcite .",
    "in addition , we also show the calculated electric form factor @xmath85 extrapolated to the chiral limit and the corresponding experimental results .",
    "the experimental @xmath46 has been measured in neutrino - neutron scattering and pion electroproduction .",
    "the neutrino data gives a good fit in the dipole form up to @xmath86  @xcite , i.e.  @xmath87 , with the axial vector coupling constant @xmath88 and @xmath89 ( world average ) .",
    "the new data from brookhaven e734 experiment  @xcite gives a value @xmath90 which is higher than the previous world average .",
    "our fit of the axial form factor to the dipole form yields @xmath91 for the p - s.c .  and @xmath92 for the l.c .  which are closer to the new experimental fit of the brookhaven e734 data  @xcite",
    "similarly , the fitted dipole mass for @xmath85 is @xmath93 which is close to the experimental dipole mass of @xmath94  @xcite . comparing to the experimental value @xmath95",
    ", we find that the calculated @xmath96 and 1.18(11 ) from the p - s.c .  and l.c .",
    "are @xmath97 and @xmath98 smaller respectively .",
    "the @xmath99 form factor @xmath100 is a fundamental quantity in the low - energy pion - nucleon and nucleon - nucleon dynamics .",
    "many dynamical issues like the @xmath56 elastic and inelastic scattering , nn potential , three -body force ( triton and @xmath101 binding energies ) , pion photoproduction and electroproduction all depend on it .",
    "similarly , the pseudoscalar form factor is important to testing low - energy theorems , chiral ward identity and the understanding of the explicit breaking of the chiral symmetry . yet , compared with the electromagnetic form factors and the isovector axial form factor of the nucleon shown in the last section , the pseudoscalar form factor @xmath47 and the @xmath0 form factor @xmath100 are poorly known either experimentally or theoretically .",
    "notwithstanding decades of interest and numerous work , the shape and slope of @xmath100 remain illusive and unsettling . upon parametrizing @xmath100 in the monopole form or the dipole form",
    ", the cutoff mass can differ as much as a factor of 3 in different models .",
    "the @xmath0 form factor ( shown in fig .",
    "3 ) is obtained from the pseudoscalar form factor with pion pole dominance  @xcite .",
    "we fitted it with both a monopole form and a dipole form .",
    "we found that the monopole form with @xmath102 agrees with the goldberger - treiman relation at @xmath103 and the dipole form does not .",
    "extrapolation of the monopole fit to @xmath104 gives @xmath105 which agrees well with the phenomenological value of @xmath106 .",
    "@xmath107 which agrees with the gt relation .",
    "this is a good example where the important physical quantity is not directly accessible experimentally or reliably obtainable from the models , lattice calculation can fill the void and give a reliable prediction .",
    "the matrix element @xmath109 and the @xmath5 term requires the quark loop calculation with disconnected insertions .    for the disconnected insertion of the current @xmath110 , we calculate the ratio of the three- and two - point functions .    @xmath111    here @xmath25 is the nucleon interpolation field and @xmath112 is summed over to obtain the forward matrix element .",
    "hence , the matrix element can be obtained as the slope from the above ratio . since we use the fixed boundary condition for the quark field in the time direction , @xmath113",
    "is summed to 4 steps away from the time - boundary in both ends to avoid the boundary effect .",
    "plotted in fig .",
    "4 are the ratios defined in eq .",
    "( [ ratio ] ) for quark masses ranging from the charm ( wilson @xmath114 ) to strange ( @xmath78 ) .",
    "we see clearly that the slope becomes larger when the quark mass becomes smaller . extrapolating to the chiral limit",
    ", we obtain @xmath115 .",
    "this is very large , about twice of the connected insertion @xmath116 .",
    "if we take the quark mass to be 5 mev , the calculated @xmath5 term is then @xmath117 mev .",
    "this is quite in agreement with the 45 mev obtained from @xmath56 scattering and is also consistent with a similar calculation on a @xmath118 lattice with the volume source  @xcite .",
    "we have also calculated @xmath109 . in this case",
    ", the quark mass in the loop due to the current self - contraction corresponds to the strange with @xmath78 .",
    "the valence quarks in the nucleon interpolating filed are then extrapolated to the chiral limit .",
    "for the strange condensate , we obtain @xmath119 .",
    "if the strange quark mass is taken to be 130 mev , then the strange will contribute @xmath120 mev to the nucleon mass .",
    "this constitutes an appreciable percentage of the total nucleon mass .",
    "we have demonstrated in this paper that it is feasible to perform _ ab initio _ calculations of the hadronic structure directly from the fundamental field theory  quantum chromodynamics without having to rely on models .",
    "notwithstanding the fact that the present lattice size is modest ( e.g. @xmath49 ) , the quark masses used are heavy compared to the physical situation , the quenched approximation is used , and the @xmath3 noise algorithm saved us 6000 times of the computer time for the quark loop calculation , present calculations still took substantial supercomputer resources to perform .",
    "for example , the project on the quark loop calculation took 2000 c-90 cpu hours at 1 gflop / processor speed to accomplish . for the @xmath2 lattice ,",
    "the memory requirement is 20 megawords .    in order to test qcd as the fundamental theory and",
    "make predictions to compare with experiments beyond doubt , we need to push the calculation to a much larger lattice , a smaller quark mass and with the full description of the dynamic fermions ( non - quenched approximation ) .",
    "each of these directions will demand one or more orders of magnitude in speed and memory than the present calculation requires .",
