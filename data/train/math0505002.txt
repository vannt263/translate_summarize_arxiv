    "it is well known  @xcite that there is a one - to - one correspondence between unitary colligations or ( in terminology of system theory ) conservative linear systems @xmath0 and operator valued functions @xmath1 of the schur class @xmath2 is one of the directions of the above mentioned correspondence . the opposite direction is realized via functional model  @xcite , whose essential ingredients are hardy spaces @xmath3 and @xmath4 ( see  @xcite ; note that @xmath5 ) .",
    "these two sides of the theory are equipollent : both have simple , clear and independent descriptions and we can easily change a point of view from unitary colligations to schur class functions and back",
    ".    we shall consider operator valued functions ( or rather sets of operator valued functions @xmath6 ) of _ weighted schur classes _ @xmath7 : @xmath8 & \\quad\\forall\\;\\zeta\\in c\\;\\;\\forall\\;n\\in { \\mathfrak n}_+\\quad ||\\theta^{+}(\\zeta)n||_{-,\\zeta}\\le    \\end{array}\\eqno{\\rm{(cfn)}}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is a multiply - connected domain bounded by a rectifiable jordan carleson curve @xmath10 ( we use also notation @xmath11 for @xmath12 ) , @xmath13 are weights such that @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 .    at this moment",
    "we ought to look for a suitable generalization of conservative systems ( = unitary colligations ) , but we find ourself in a position to make a choice what features of unitary colligations to retain .",
    "first , we are going to keep conservatism , that means the characteristic function of a such system ought to be of weighted schur class .",
    "here we fork with  @xcite , where general transfer functions , rather than conservative ones , is a subject of study .",
    "second , we want to retain analiticity in both domains @xmath9 and @xmath11 . in such a way we reserve to ourself possibility to exploit techniques that are typical for the boundary values problems ( singular integral operators , the riemman - hilbert problem , etc ) including connections to the stationary scattering theory  @xcite ( e.g. , the smooth methods of t.kato ) .",
    "thus we will use both smirnov spaces @xmath17",
    "@xcite , which are analogues of the hardy spaces @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the requirement of analyticity in both domains conflicts with requirement of orthogonality : in general , the decomposition @xmath18 is not orthogonal .",
    "the combination `` analyticity in @xmath9 plus orthogonality '' is a mainstream of development in the multiply - connected case starting with  @xcite and therefore at this point we fork with traditional way of generalization of sz .- nagy - foia theory  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , our requirements are also substantial and descends from applications ( see  @xcite ) : in  @xcite we studied the duality of spectral components for trace class perturbations of a normal operator with spectrum on a curve ; the functional model from  @xcite goes back to  @xcite , which is devoted to spectral analysis of linear neutral functional differential equations .",
    "moreover , one can regard the present paper as a result of comparison and unification of the approaches from  @xcite .",
    "if we examine our variant of functional model with more retrospective point of view , we can observe that it lies on intersection of evolution lines going back to @xcite .    in order to formulate a main result , we need some background ( see for details  @xcite ) .",
    "consider pairs @xmath19 of operators @xmath20 such that @xmath21 where @xmath22 are projections such that @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "operators @xmath25 are isometries if we regard them as operators acting from weighted @xmath26 with operator valued weights @xmath27 .",
    "note that in this interpretation @xmath28 are the adjoint operators of @xmath29 .",
    "we shall say that @xmath30 is a free _ functional model _ of sz .- nagy - foia type ( see  @xcite for the unit disk case ) and write @xmath31 .",
    "however , in contrast to  @xcite , in our axiomatics we use neither a unitary dilation nor orthogonal compliments",
    ".    it can easily be checked that @xmath32 therefore we have defined the functor @xmath33 , where @xmath34 and the symbol @xmath35 denotes the category of _ characteristic functions_. conversely , for a given @xmath36 , it is possible to construct ( up to unitarily equivalence ) a functional model @xmath37 such that @xmath38 , i.e. , there exists the inverse functor @xmath39 .",
    "note that any characteristic function @xmath36 can be transformed to the form @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the pure `` part '' of @xmath42 and @xmath43 is the unitary `` part '' of @xmath42 ( see remark  [ rem2 ] ) .",

    "the relations ( stot ) and ( ctot ) define the functors @xmath65 and @xmath66 , respectively .",
    "thus we have arrived to the following commutative diagram @xmath67    we have defined the notion of conservative curved system .",
    "linear similarity ( instead of unitarily equivalence for unitary colligations ) is a natural kind of equivalence for conservative curved systems and duality is a substitute for orthogonality .",
    "another distinctive feature of conservative curved systems is that we distinguish notions of characteristic and transfer function . in section 1",
    "we give a more detailed survey of categories @xmath68 and related functors .",
    "the fundamental relation @xmath69 from that section explains a functorial character of the transformation @xmath70 .",
    "as we can now see , characteristic functions and conservative curved systems are not on equal terms : first of them plays leading role because the definition of conservative curved system depends on the functional model , which , in turn , is uniquely determined by the characteristic function .",
    "but , surprisingly , the conservative curved systems is a comparatively autonomous notion and one of the aims of this paper is to `` measure '' a degree of this autonomy .    examining the diagram ( c&f ) we see that it is an interesting problem to recover a functional model @xmath31 for a given conservative curved systems @xmath71 .",
    "we have @xmath72 .",
    "since the functor @xmath73 is evidently invertible , the main problem is to invert @xmath74 .",
    "in fact , the projections @xmath22 are singular integral operators and we can regard ( ctot ) as a system of singular integral equations with unknown @xmath75 and given @xmath76 .",
    "the main result of section  2 ( and of the paper on the whole ) is the uniqueness of a solution of this system .    if @xmath77 and @xmath78 , then @xmath79 .    in other words , if the transfer function @xmath80 is a function of the nevanlinna class and the weights @xmath81 are fixed , then the pure `` part '' @xmath82 of the characteristic function is uniquely determined . here",
    "@xmath83 is the nevanlinna class of operator valued functions that admit representation of the form @xmath84 , where @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "we also describe a procedure how to find a characteristic function for given transfer function . knowing the characteristic function we can construct the functional model @xmath30 and obtain explicit formulas for conversion of the simple system @xmath60 into the model system @xmath87 . as a result",
    "we give purely intrinsic description of simple conservative curved systems with the transfer function of the nevanlinna class .",
    "note that conservative curved systems arise for certain problems of operator theory and we reap the benefit of functional model when we are able to determine that some set of operators @xmath88 is a curved conservative system  @xcite .",
    "in section 3 we employ the functional model to establish duality of spectral components of trace class perturbations of normal operators with spectrum on a curve .",
    "the statement is the same as in  @xcite , but now we extend that assertion to the multiply connected case .",
    "one of our purposes is to demonstrate how and why the functional model for conservative curved systems can be successfully used in perturbation theory .",
    "the author is grateful to d.yakubovich for interesting and useful information and j.ball for stimulating questions .",
    "in this section we survey ( mainly without proofs ) basic facts concerning the categories @xmath68 and related functors ( see  @xcite for details ) .",
