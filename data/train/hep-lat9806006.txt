    "it is well known , though , that lattice perturbation theory is ill behaved , due to the presence of tadpole - like diagrams @xcite and at values of the coupling @xmath1 , the higher - order corrections may not be small , thus introducing a large uncertainty in the calculation of the renormalized matrix elements in some continuum scheme .",
    "these problems are avoided using non - perturbative ( np ) renormalization techniques @xcite .",
    "the procedure proposed in @xcite allows a full non - perturbative computation of the matrix elements of composite operators in the regularization independent ( ri ) scheme @xcite .",
    "the matching between the ri scheme and @xmath2 , which is intrinsically perturbative , is computed using only continuum perturbation theory , which is well behaved .",

    "moreover , any attempt to tackle the question of the @xmath4 rule must rely on np methods @xcite .    in this paper , we extend the exploratory computations done in @xcite to a high statistics study with both the standard wilson action and the tree - level improved sw - clover action @xcite at different values of the coupling in the quenched approximation .",
