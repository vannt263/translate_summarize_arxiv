    "early x - ray observations of elliptical galaxies revealed that the dominant source of x - ray emission comes from the diffuse , hot interstellar medium ( ism ) at a temperature of @xmath51 kev ( e.g. , forman , jones , & tucker 1985 ) .",
    "however , these galaxies have also been shown to contain a population of x - ray emitting point sources ( sarazin , irwin , & bregman 2000 ; fabbiano , kim , trinchieri 1994 ) . before the launch of _ chandra _ , with its excellent angular resolution , x - ray source populations could not be studied in detail in galaxies outside the local group .",
    "however , many studies were done on the estimated cumulative emission from discrete sources with previous x - ray satellites ( kim , fabbiano , & trinchieri 1992 ; matsumoto et al .",
    "1997 ; irwin & sarazin 1998 ) . the presence of these sources could be seen as deviations from the spectral and spatial properties of the hot gas . in ngc  720 , for example",
    ", the total emission from discrete sources has been estimated from both the hard spectral component detected with _",
    "asca _ and from the spatial distribution of the x - ray surface brightness with _",
    "rosat_. in both cases , the ratio of the flux of discrete sources to the flux of diffuse emission was estimated to be about 0.40 ( buote & canizares 1996 , 1997 ) . with _",

    "the x - ray luminosity functions ( xlf ) of sources in these galaxies have been found to follow a broken power - law distribution with a break luminosity close to the eddington limit for an accreting neutron star , and they contain a number of sources with luminosities exceeding this limit . among late - type galaxies studied , kilgard et al .",

    "it was found early on that some galaxies contain ultraluminous sources ( l@xmath1 ergs s@xmath2 , fabbiano 1989 ) .",
    "the nature of these sources has not yet been determined .",
    "the possibilities include intermediate mass black holes , with masses between those of stellar black holes and agn ( e.g. colbert & mushotzky 1999 ) , or beamed emission from stellar mass black hole or neutron star binaries ( king et al .",
    "2001 ; king 2002 ) .",
    "_ chandra _ has revealed these sources in many galaxies .",
    "comparison of the xlfs of galaxies of different morphological type has led to the suggestion that a larger fraction of ultraluminous sources is present in star forming galaxies and that they may be associated with young stellar populations ( kilgard et al .",
    "2002 ; zezas & fabbiano 2002 ) .    in this paper , we study the previously unresolved x - ray point source population in ngc  720 .",
    "ngc  720 is an x - ray bright , relatively isolated elliptical galaxy .",
    "an agn has not previously been detected in this galaxy , although as discussed later we see possible evidence for a low - luminosity agn with _",
    "chandra_. some of the galaxy s basic properties are listed in table 1 .",
    "the diffuse x - ray emission in ngc  720 was studied previously with _",

    "chandra _ in a separate paper ( buote et al .",
    "the diffuse emission shows a position angle twist consistent with a triaxial mass distribution .",
    "this isophote twist is not seen in the optical , and the ellipticity of the x - ray emission is too large to be explained by a model with mass following optical light .",
    "therefore , the distribution of x - ray emission indicates the presence of dark matter in this galaxy .",
    "the distance to ngc  720 has been determined through a variety of methods .",
    "the distance measured from surface brightness fluctuations ( sbf ) calibrated to cepheids is @xmath6 mpc",

    "however , we use @xmath10 km s@xmath2 mpc@xmath2 in order to compare to the results of sarazin et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and blanton et al .",

    "all our luminosities should be reduced by a factor of 1.8 .",
    "ngc  720 was observed with the back - illuminated _ chandra _ acis - s3 detector on 2000 october 12 - 13 for 41,565 s. we kept only _ asca _ grades 0 , 2 , 3 , 4 , and 6 .",
    "we then examined the satellite aspect and light curve to eliminate time intervals of bad aspect or high background .",
    "columns adjacent to node boundaries were also removed . after filtering ,",
    "the net useful exposure time was 38,830 s. the 0.3 - 10 kev image of ngc  720 is shown in figure 1 .",
    "the image has been smoothed with the chandra interactive analysis of observations ( ciao ) program _ csmooth _ with a minimum significance of 3 and a maximum significance of 5 .",
    "the minimum , maximum , and average smoothing scales were 0.188 , 74.7 , and 62.6 pixels respectively .",
    "also shown is the x - ray image overlaid with the optical contours from the dss image of ngc  720 .",
    "after our analysis of ngc  720 was complete , new alignment files were released which correct for aspect offsets in _",
    "observations based on the cross - correlation of chandra sources and several accurate catalogs ( icrs , tycho2 , usno - a2.0 , 2mass ) .",
    "the new alignment values are based on a decaying exponential fit to the offsets in a carefully selected sample of observations spanning the entire mission . for a sample of observations reprocessed with the new alignments",
    "files the 90% uncertainty in the _ chandra _ positions for sources within 2@xmath13 of the hrma optical axis was 0.6@xmath0 .",

    "= -0.93@xmath0 and @xmath14dec .",
    "= 0.27@xmath0 .",
    "we have corrected all of the source positions in this paper . we were not able to find any optical or radio sources with accurate positions that had x - ray counterparts on acis - s3 , so we were not able to independently check the astrometry .    before spectral",
    "fitting , the data were corrected for charge transfer inefficiency ( cti ) and matching rmfs were used ( townsley 2000 ) .",
    "the spectral analysis was limited to the 0.3 - 7 kev range to reduce the effect of the background . at the time of this paper",
    ", there was some uncertainty in the spectral calibration at low energies . to investigate the effects of this problem , we tried both using a newer test version of the quantum efficiency file which does a better job of modeling the carbon k edge region of the spectrum and fitting only energies above 0.7 kev .",
    "however , almost all of our fits were the same within the errors , and the luminosities changed by less than 10% . only the fits in the 0.3 - 7 kev range are reported here .",
    "all spectra were extracted in pi ( pulse height - invariant ) channels , which correct for the gain difference between different regions of the ccd , and grouped to give a minimum of 15 counts per energy bin .",
    "fitting was done with xspec ( v11.1.0 ) .",
    "point sources were detected using _ wavdetect _ , a wavelet source detection program in ciao .",
    "the energy range was restricted to 0.3 - 10 kev , the wavelet scales used were 2 , 4 , 8 , 16 , and 32 pixels , and the significance threshold was set at @xmath15 , corresponding to about one false detection in the area of the s3 chip .",
    "sources were then examined by eye in both the smoothed image and binned raw data .",
    "sources within approximately @xmath16 of the galaxy center are listed in table 2 in order of increasing distance from the optical center .",
    "this list includes all sources inside the @xmath17 ellipse .",
    "there are a total of 42 sources including source 1 , which is a possible central source .",
    "table 2 lists the source number and position , the projected distance from the optical center of ngc  720 , the count rate , the significance of the detection , and the unabsorbed x - ray luminosity assuming the sources are located at the distance of ngc  720 .",
    "details of the luminosity calculation are given in section 4.3 .",
    "source counts were calculated in circular apertures surrounding each source with radii of @xmath18 depending on source strength , crowding , and distance from the aim point , and the background was estimated from an annular local background .",
    "the count rates given by _",
    "wavdetect _ were not used because they were too high for a few sources near the center of the galaxy , most likely due to the diffuse emission for the other sources , _ wavdetect _ gave very similar count rates to those listed .",
    "examination of the exposure map for this observation showed that the exposure varied by 3% or less between sources , so we have used the same exposure time for all sources .",
    "errors in the count rate were calculated using the gehrels approximation ( gehrels 1986 ) , and the source significances were estimated based on the poisson probability of detecting the observed total source counts given the expected number of counts from the background .",
    "the minimum detected count rate was approximately @xmath19 counts s@xmath2 .",
    "our detection limit may be a bit higher near the central region of the galaxy where the diffuse emission is brightest , but examination of table 2 shows that we are still detecting relatively low count rate sources at high significance at a radius of approximately 20@xmath0 .",
    "based on source number counts from the _ chandra _ deep field south and _ chandra _ deep field north , we expect that 8 - 11 of the sources are not associated with the galaxy ( campana et al .",
    "2001 , tozzi et al .",
    "2001 , brandt et al .",
    "the fits of mushotzky et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and baldi et al .",
    "( 2001 ) give a slightly larger number of expected unassociated sources .",
    "however , their fits require extrapolation down to our flux limit , and , from the deeper surveys , it appears that the logn - logs flattens at small fluxes .",
    "we have compared our x - ray source positions to a list of globular cluster candidates provided by m. kissler - patig ( chapelan 2001 ) .",
    "these globular cluster positions were derived from observations of ngc  720 taken by buat and burgarella at the 3.6 meter canada - france - hawaii telescope ( cfht ) , and globular cluster candidates were selected based on their b - i color .",
    "we find that eight x - ray sources are a distance of 1@xmath0 or less from a globular cluster candidate and another four are 2@xmath0 or less .",
    "the globular cluster positions have an accuracy of about 1 - 2@xmath0 . given the density of globular clusters we would expect @xmath20 random associations within 1@xmath0 and @xmath21 within 2@xmath0 .",
    "for this calculation , the globular cluster density was calculated in five radial annuli about the galaxy center .",
    "the possible globular cluster associations are noted as `` gc '' in table 2 .",
    "with the exception of the brightest source , number 40 , the sources have too few counts to fit individual spectra .",
    "however , we can get an indication of their spectral properties through hardness ratios .",
    "following sarazin et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and their study of the sources in ngc 4697 , we divide source counts into three energy bands : soft s , 0.3 - 1.0 kev ; medium m , 1.0 - 2.0 kev ; and hard h , 2.0 - 10.0 kev .",
    "we then plot h31 = ( h - s)/(h+s ) versus h21 = ( m - s)/(m+s ) for all sources with more than 20 counts .",
    "this color - color diagram is shown in figure 2 .",
    "error bars give 1-sigma errors in the ratios based on a binomial distribution of the source counts in each band , but do not include error due to the background .",
    "also plotted are the predicted ratios for different power - law spectral models . the upper line is for a power - law with a hydrogen column density equal to the galactic value of @xmath22 @xmath23 ( dickey & lockman 1990 ) ; the plotted points are for photon indices of 0 , 1 , 2 , and 3 .",
    "the lower line gives the colors for a column of @xmath24 @xmath23 and photon indices of 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 .",
    "overall , the distribution of source colors is quite similar to those seen in the faint elliptical and s0 galaxies ngc  4697 and ngc  1553 ( sarazin et .",
    "al 2000 ; blanton et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "the color - color diagram reveals that there are several sources with positive hardness ratios , indicating that they emit mostly high energy photons .",
    "these sources appear to be absorbed .",
    "most of the other sources are in a diagonal band with negative h31 and h21 ranging from -0.3 to 0.2 .",
    "there is also one very soft source , number 3 , with ratios of ( h21 , h31 ) = ( -0.6 , -0.9 ) .",
    "both the brightest source , source number 40 , and the central source number 1 have high hardness ratios of ( 0.5 , 0.5 ) and ( 0.3 , 0.2 ) respectively . in order to look at their composite spectra",
    ", we divided the sources into three groups according to their hardness ratios .",
    "the sources in group a were defined to be those with both h21 and h31 greater than zero . the sources in this group are indicated with an `` a '' in the last column of table 2 and are plotted with open diamonds in figure 2 .",
    "source 40 and the central source were excluded from the group a composite spectrum , but both are denoted with an `` a '' and plotted with diamonds .",
    "source 40 was not included in the composite spectrum because it has a significantly higher flux than the other sources and could bias the overall spectrum .",
    "we fit its spectrum separately .",
    "the central source was not included due to the possibility that it is an agn , however , its inclusion would not significantly affect the fits .",
    "the sources in group b were those sources with h31 less than zero and which fell closer to the galactic absorption curve in figure 2 .",
    "these sources are indicated with `` b '' in table 2 and plotted with open squares in figure 2 .",
    "the group c sources , which lie closer to the curve for a column of @xmath24 @xmath23 , are denoted as `` c '' and plotted with xs .",
    "an interesting property of the group a sources is that , with the exception of source 6 , they all lie more than an arcmin from the galaxy center . of the fourteen sources at a distance of greater than @xmath25 , nine are a sources .",
    "for contrast , within @xmath25 of the center , only five of twenty - seven sources are from group a ( excluding the center ) .",
    "this effect could be due to the fact that at larger radius more sources will be unassociated with the galaxy .",
    "we could account for nearly all of the these sources with the expected number of unrelated sources . however , four of the group a sources ( including number 40 ) seem to be associated with globular cluster candidates , and globular clusters are seen at radii larger than those considered here ( chapelan 2001 ) .",
    "we fit the combined spectrum of all of the sources ( excluding 1 and 40 ) as well as the combined spectra for each of the three groups .",
    "the results are summarized in table 3 . for a power - law fit",
    ", we find that both the group a and c sources are consistent with having absorption greater than the galactic value of @xmath22 @xmath23 ( dickey & lockman 1990 ) with the a sources having a higher best - fit column of @xmath26 @xmath23 . in both cases , setting the absorption to the galactic value gave a worse fit .",
    "both groups have a similar photon index of about 2 . for the group b sources ,",
    "the best fit column was below galactic , so we fixed it at the galactic value .",
    "these sources had a flatter index than the other two groups with a best - fit value of 1.2 .",
    "from the spectra , it appears that the group a sources are actually softer than the b sources ; they appear hard from their hardness ratios because their high absorption results in a small number of low energy photons .",
    "the combined spectrum of all of the sources , not surprisingly , gave values intermediate between these with a best - fit column density of @xmath27 @xmath23 and a best - fit index of 1.5 .",
    "all of the above fits had a reduced @xmath28 of one or less .",
    "the a , b , and c spectra and best - fit power - law models are shown in figure 3 .    for both the c and total source spectra , we found that we could obtain a good fit for galactic absorption by adding a black body thermal component to the power - law model .",
    "for both spectra , we then get a power - law index of @xmath29 , in good agreement with the group b index , and black body temperatures of 0.38@xmath30 kev and 0.62@xmath31 kev respectively .",
    "both the single component and power - law plus black body models gave excellent fits to the data .",
    "for the spectrum of all of the sources , the black body component accounted for approximately 30% of the flux , while for group c , the black body component contributed approximately 40% of the flux .",
    "this was not a good model for either the a or b spectra , giving unreasonable values of the parameters ( kt@xmath32 ) for the a sources and an essentially unconstrained black body temperature for the b sources .",
    "we also tried fitting to an absorbed thermal bremsstrahlung model .",
    "the fits to the a and c sources gave temperatures of 6 kev and 3 kev , with the a sources again having a higher column .",
    "for the composite spectrum of all the sources , we got a higher best - fit temperature of 11 kev .",
    "we do not include a bremsstrahlung fit to the group b spectrum because the temperature had very large errors , and we conclude that it is not well described by this model .    also shown in table 3 are the results of fits to the spectrum of source 40 .",
    "of the 42 sources in table 2 , only source 40 had enough counts to fit an individual spectrum .",
    "as mentioned before , this source is hard and located a distance of 134@xmath0 from the center of the galaxy .",
    "a power - law fit to the spectrum gives a column density of 4.3@xmath33 @xmath23 , in excess of the galactic value , and an index of 1.3@xmath34 .",
    "therefore , this source may be an agn unassociated with the galaxy .",
    "if it were located at the same distance as ngc  720 , it would have a luminosity of @xmath35 ergs s@xmath2 which is three times as luminous as the next most luminous source .",
    "however , source 40 is located 1.6@xmath0 from a globular cluster candidate .",
    "we also fit to a black body model , which gave a temperature of 0.93@xmath36 kev . here",
    ", we chose to fix the absorption at the galactic value because the best fit was below this value .",
    "the spectrum and best - fit power - law model are shown in figure 4 .",
    "as mentioned earlier , we detect a source close to the optical center of the galaxy .",
    "it is listed as source 1 in table 2 .",
    "the position of the center is listed in table 1 and was taken from the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) . with hardness ratios of ( h21 , h31 )",
    "= ( 0.3 , 0.2 ) , this source appears to be either hard or highly absorbed .",
    "these ratios are harder than those for the diffuse galaxy component , and this source is not likely to be simply a peak in the diffuse emission . a kolmogoroff - smirov test of the events in source 1 versus the diffuse emission in the central 15@xmath0 of ngc  720 gives a probability of 0.13% that they were drawn from the same distribution of energies . a ks test of source 1 versus the diffuse emission from the whole galaxy gives a probability of 1.3% .",
    "_ wavdetect _ finds the size of this source to be fairly large given its position near the aim point , with a radius of over 3@xmath0 , indicating that it could be extended .",
    "however , this could be due to contamination from the bright diffuse emission at the galaxy center , and the source appears small in both the smoothed image and binned data .",
    "using the group a spectrum normalization , we find that source 1 has a luminosity of @xmath37 ergs s@xmath2 .",
    "the high luminosity , large hardness ratios , and location of this source indicate that it could be a low - luminosity agn ( terashima & wilson 2002 ; ho et al . 2001 ) .",
    "however , we see several other ultraluminous sources in ngc  720 which have similar hardness ratios or are associated with globular cluster candidates .",
    "an agn has not been detected in this galaxy at other wavelengths , but from the central surface birghtness profile van der marel ( 1999 ) estimated a black hole mass of @xmath38 for this galaxy .",
    "a correlation has also been found between bulge luminosity and black hole mass ( kormendy & gebhardt 2001 ) . using the blue luminosity of ngc  720 and the fit of kormendy & gebhardt ( 2001 )",

    "the xlf of ngc  720 is flat out to fairly large luminosities .",
    "the large number of ulxs in ngc  720 and its relatively flat xlf may provide evidence against the association of all ulxs with young stars . as stated above , further evidence for the common occurrence of ulxs in ellipticals",

    "recently , king ( 2002 ) suggested that there are two classes of ulxs which both have super - eddington mass accretion rates : thermal - timescale mass transfer in high - mass x - ray binaries and long - lasting transient outbursts in low - mass x - ray binaries .",

    "the globular clusters have a similar distribution to the optical light ; however , the x - ray gas does not .",

    "investigation of the x - ray image , however , reveals that the source distribution appears distinctly non - uniform .",
    "there appear to be arcs of sources as well as large regions with no sources .",
    "figure 6b shows the angular distribution of sources at distances larger than 90@xmath0 from the galaxy center , while figure 6c shows the distribution for distances less than 90@xmath0 . at small radii ,",
    "the distribution is similar to the overall distribution , but at large radii , all of the sources lie in a large arc running from east to south of the galaxy center .",
    "figure 7 shows a histogram of the source distances from the center of the galaxy .",
    "the distribution of x - ray sources around ngc  720 is quite unusual . as mentioned before , most of the sources at large radius , which make up the outer arc , are the highly absorbed group a sources .",
    "approximately a quarter of the sources in ngc  720 are expected to be unassociated with the galaxy , and these sources could be background sources .",
    "however , it would be perhaps more unusual to have such a non - uniform distribution of background sources , and several of these sources are globular cluster candidates .",
    "it is unlikely that the sources would be affected by interaction with a neighboring galaxy .",

    "the arc pattern of the sources is similar to the `` shells '' seen in some elliptical galaxies at optical wavelengths .",
    "these shell galaxies are thought to be the result of the merger of an elliptical galaxy with a disk galaxy and seem to occur more frequently in isolated ellipticals ( quinn 1984 ; colbert , mulchaey , & zabludoff 2001 ) .",
    "ngc  720 is classified as having `` irregular '' isophotes which in conjunction with its strong x - ray emission has been suggested to mean that it has undergone a past merger ( nieto & bender 1989 ) .",
    "perhaps the non - uniform x - ray source distribution is the result of a merger event . on the other hand , ngc  720",
    "does not show shells at optical wavelengths .",

    "we have detected 42 x - ray point sources within 2.5@xmath13 of the center of the elliptical galaxy ngc  720 .",
    "this list includes all sources inside the @xmath17 ellipse for this galaxy . assuming that they are located at the distance of ngc  720 , these sources have luminosities between @xmath90 ergs s@xmath2 and @xmath91 ergs s@xmath2 .",
    "based on the _ chandra _ deep fields , we estimate that a quarter of these sources are unassociated with the galaxy .",
    "investigation of the color - color diagram of the sources reveals that most of the sources lie in a diagonal band with negative h31 and h21 ranging from -0.3 to 0.2 .",
    "we divide these sources into two groups based on their apparent absorption .",
    "one group of sources is well described by a flat power - law spectrum with a photon index of 1.2 and galactic absorption .",
    "the other group can be well fit by either a steeper power - law , with a photon index of 2.2 and excess absorption of @xmath92 @xmath23 , or a flat power - law , with an index of 1.1 plus a thermal blackbody component with a temperature of 0.38@xmath30 kev .",
    "there is also a group of sources with positive hardness ratios , indicating that most of their counts are at high energies .",
    "the combined spectrum of this group is well fit by a power - law with an index of about 2 and high absorption of @xmath26 @xmath23 which can not be accounted for by an additional thermal component .",
    "these highly absorbed sources are generally located at large distances from the galaxy center and could be mostly background sources . however , four of the these sources seem to correspond to globular cluster candidates .",
    "the spectral fits are summarized in table 3 .",
    "we also detect a source near the center of ngc  720 which could be a central low - luminosity agn .",
    "this source has large hardness ratios and a luminosity of @xmath37 ergs s@xmath2 .",
    "the overall spatial distribution of x - ray sources in ngc  720 is consistent with the galaxy ellipticity and position angle from either the diffuse x - ray emission or optical light .",
    "however , the sources do not appear to be uniformly distributed .",
    "for example , at large radii all of the sources lie in a large arc running from east to south of the galaxy center .",
    "ngc  720 is fairly isolated and it is unlikely that the source distribution could be explained by interaction with another galaxy .",
    "it is possible that this feature could be due to a background structure , but it seems more likely that such a non - uniform distribution would be associated with the galaxy .",
    "most of the sources in this arc belong to the group of sources with large hardness ratios and high absorption , and the feature may be the result of a past merger and starburst event .    with _ chandra _ , the luminosity functions of x - ray sources in several galaxies have been studied . in two other early - type galaxies",
    "the xlfs have been well fit by a broken power - law with a break luminosity of 3 - 4 @xmath93 ergs s@xmath2 and a high luminosity slope of 2.7 - 2.8 ( sarazin et al . 2000 ; blanton et al .",
    "in contrast , the disk and merger galaxies studied so far have xlfs which can be fit by a single power - law with a flatter slope ( kilgard et al . 2002 ; zezas & fabbiano 2002 ) .",
    "we do not detect sources to low enough luminosities in ngc  720 to be able to compare to the break seen in ngc  4697 and ngc  1553 ; however , we see possible evidence of a break at a much higher luminosity of @xmath4 ergs s@xmath2 .",
    "this break is too high to be explained as a transition between neutron star and black hole binaries as suggested by sarazin et al .",
    "alternatively , it has been suggested that a break in the xlf could be produced by a decaying starburst component from binaries formed in a past merger ( kilgard et al .",
    "2002 ; wu 2001 ) .",
    "if this is the case , ngc  720 may have undergone a more recent merger than either ngc  4697 or ngc  1553 .",
    "a broken power - law is a somewhat better fit to the ngc  720 xlf than a single power - law , with a low luminosity slope of 1.4 and a high luminosity slope of 5 . with its high break luminosity ,",
    "the xlf of ngc  720 is flat out to fairly large luminosities .",
    "when fit to a single power - law , the slope of the xlf in ngc  720 is possibly flatter than the other early - type galaxies and possibly steeper than the disk and merger galaxies , but could agree with either within the errors .",
    "this flatness of the xlf also agrees with the possiblity of an evolved starburst from a past merger .",
    "the `` shell - like '' distribution of x - ray sources in ngc  720 could be the result of a past merger .",
    "however , the sources in ngc  720 would have to be associated with relatively low mass stars . as mentioned before , the time since the last major starburst event in ngc  720 is estimated to be 3.4 gyrs ( terlevich & forbes 2001 ) .",
    "in addition , the formation time of shells in a merger is 0.1 - 1 gyrs ( quinn 1984 ) .",
    "we would , therefore , only expect to find main - sequence stars of 1 - 2 m@xmath94 or less .",
    "ultraluminous sources ( l@xmath1 ergs s@xmath2 ) have now been seen in galaxies of many morphological types , and the nature of these sources is unknown . they could be associated with 10 - 100 m@xmath94 black holes binaries ( e.g. colbert & mushotzky 1999 ) or beamed emission from stellar mass black hole or neutron star binaries ( king et al .",
    "2001 ; king 2002 ) .",
    "comparison of the x - ray luminosity functions of early - type and star forming galaxies suggests that perhaps there is a larger fraction of these sources in star forming galaxies and that they could be associated with young stellar populations ( kilgard et al .",
    "2002 ; zezas & fabbiano 2002 ) .",
    "ngc  720 may provide evidence against this suggestion .",
    "fitting to a single power - law , its luminosity function is nearly as flat as those seen in disk and merger systems , and fitting to a broken power - law , the xlf is extremely flat out to a luminosity of @xmath4 ergs s@xmath2 before dropping off .",
    "it also contains a large number of ultraluminous sources .",
    "we find 9 ulxs in ngc  720 for @xmath71 km s@xmath2 mpc@xmath2 of which at most two are expected to be unassociated with the galaxy .",
    "this number is similar to the 10 and 8 detected in the antennae and ngc  3256 merger systems ( zezas et al .",
    "2002 ; for @xmath78 km s@xmath2 mpc@xmath2 ; lira et al . 2002 ) and more than has been previously seen in an early - type galaxy .",
    "we investigated the possibility that we could be overestimating the number of ulxs in ngc  720 .",
    "a 20% error in the distance would reduce the number of ulxs to 5 .",
    "we also calculated source luminosities using different spectral models including absorption fixed at galactic and the other fits listed in table 3 . dividing the sources into groups",
    "a , b , and c and varying the spectral models gave a minimum of 6 ulxs . using the composite spectrum of all of the sources and varying",
    "the model gave a minimum of 4 ulxs .",
    "a reduction in the number of ultraluminous sources to 4 would be in good agreement with the number seen in ngc  1553 .",
    "the detection of ulxs in several early - type galaxies implies that not all of these systems are related to young , massive stars . in a study of 54 galaxies containing ulxs with _ rosat _ , colbert & ptak ( 2002 ) found a higher number of these sources per galaxy in ellipticals , and king ( 2002 ) suggests that there may be two classes of ulxs with one class associated with hmxbs and the other with lmxbs .",
    "however , the unusual source distribution may indicate that ngc  720 has undergone a merger , provding a possible connection between these sources and those seen in the antennae .",
    "again , the sources in ngc  720 would have to be associated with lower mass stars of at most 1 - 2 m@xmath94 .",
    "so far only a handful of galaxy source populations have been studied . as a larger sample of galaxies becomes available with _",
    "chandra _ , the properties of ulxs and their relationship to galaxy morphology as well as the location and cause of the break in the xlfs of early - type galaxies can be studied with more certainty .",

    "<S> we find that there is a population of highly absorbed sources located at large distances from the center of the galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> the overall spatial distribution of sources is consistent with the ellipticity and position angle of the galaxy , but the sources appear to form several arcs . </S>",
    "<S> ngc  720 contains nine ultraluminous sources ( l@xmath1 ergs s@xmath2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this number is more than have previously been detected in an early - type galaxy but similar to the number seen in the antennae merger system . </S>",
    "<S> the ratio @xmath3 for ngc  720 is more than double the ratio for the s0 galaxy ngc  1553 and a factor of seven higher than for the elliptical galaxy ngc  4697 , although uncertainties in the distance and the source spectral properties could bring these ratios into agreement . </S>",
    "<S> the x - ray source luminosity function is also nearly as flat as those seen in disk and merger systems . </S>",
    "<S> the large number of ulxs in ngc  720 and its relatively flat xlf may provide evidence against the association of all ulxs with young stars . </S>",
    "<S> we also see a possible high luminosity break in the luminosity function at @xmath4 ergs s@xmath2 . </S>"
