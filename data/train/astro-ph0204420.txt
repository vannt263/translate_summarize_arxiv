    "the sombrero galaxy ( m104 = ngc  4594 ) is well known for its dominating bulge / halo component which contributes with about 80% of the total luminosity @xcite .",
    "this makes the sombrero an important intermediary case between later - type spirals and elliptical / s0 galaxies , and an ideal place to study the relation between spiral bulges and early - type galaxies .",
    "one interesting aspect of such studies is to compare the globular cluster ( gc ) systems of early- and late - type galaxies .",
    "the sombrero has a very rich gc system with an estimated total of @xmath5 clusters @xcite , about an order of magnitude more than the milky way and m31 @xcite , but comparable to many early - type galaxies of the same luminosity . using archive wfpc2 images , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper i ) detected a clearly bimodal color distribution for the sombrero gcs , confirming hints by @xcite .",
    "the number of red ( metal - rich ) and blue gcs were found to be roughly equal , in contrast to m31 and the milky way where the metal - poor gcs constitute about 2/3  3/4 of the total population , but again similar to the situation in early - type galaxies .",
    "thus , we suggested in paper i that the metal - rich gcs in the sombrero are associated with the bulge rather than with its disk , in which case a much more modest number of metal - rich gcs would have been expected .",
    "the wfpc2 data presented in paper i also showed that the mean colors of the two gc populations in the sombrero are very similar to those in early - type galaxies as well as the milky way , m31 and other spiral galaxies @xcite , with inferred mean metallicities of [ fe / h]@xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "although there may not be a one - to - one correspondence between star formation and formation of globular clusters , information about the age distribution of gcs would presumably provide valuable insight about major star formation episodes in their host galaxies .",
    "an important , unresolved issue is whether age differences exist between the gc subpopulations in galaxies , and how large such age differences might be .",
    "this question is still controversial even in our galaxy , where gc ages can be derived from color - magnitude diagrams @xcite , so it is not surprising that it has proven to be very difficult to obtain reliable information about ages of extragalactic gcs from integrated photometry and/or spectroscopy . as shown by @xcite",
    ", blue horizontal - branch morphology can have a significant impact on observed h@xmath8 indices , the most commonly used age indicator .",
    "more recently , @xcite have discussed a number of problems in the modeling of globular cluster spectra , and concluded that uncertainties in the luminosity function of the red and asymptotic giant branches , @xmath9-element enhancement , horizontal branch morphology and other factors can affect spectroscopic age estimates by at least 34 gyr .",
    "observationally , useful constraints on typical gc ages require very accurate measurements of balmer line indices , as the separation between e.g.  the 10 gyr and 11 gyr isochrones is only about 0.1   in the equivalent width of h@xmath8 . furthermore , at lower metallicities ( @xmath10$}}\\la-1 $ ] ) , recent models ( maraston 2001 , priv .",
    "comm . , bruzual & charlot 2001 , priv .",
    "comm . ) suggest that the balmer lines no longer depend on age in a simple way for ages greater than about 10 gyr .",
    "a more indirect way to constrain the formation history of stellar populations in general , including gcs , is by studying their abundance patterns .",
    "the milky way bulge and halo populations , as well as many early - type galaxies , show an enhancement in the abundances of @xmath9-elements relative to the fe - group compared to the sun ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "the enhancement is typically around @xmath0$}}\\sim + 0.3 $ ] @xcite and is also seen in the sombrero bulge stars @xcite .",
    "the most commonly adopted explanation is that different elements are produced by stars with different lifetimes , of which supernovae of type ia are generally assumed to have the longest lifetimes and make the strongest contribution to fe .",
    "thus , populations that formed on time - scales too short for sn ia to have made any significant contribution to the abundance patterns show `` enhancement '' of other elements relative to fe ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , studies of abundance patterns may provide an alternative chronometer for the chemical evolutionary history of galaxies , although the timescale for development of sn ia remains very uncertain .",
    "because of its relatively small discance and rich gc system , the sombrero galaxy is an attractive target for detailed studies of individual gcs . with 810 m class telescopes , high - quality spectra can be obtained for many of the brighter clusters , and by co - adding spectra of several gcs it is possible to achieve sufficient s / n to bring the errors down to a level where model uncertainties rather than observational errors dominate .",
    "this makes it possible to test whether the models yield internally consistent results , e.g.  by comparing age estimates based on different balmer lines ( h@xmath8 , h@xmath11 , h@xmath12 ) .",
    "spectroscopically , the gc system of the sombrero has been studied by @xcite who obtained rather low s / n spectra for 34 confirmed gcs .",
    "by co - adding the spectra they found a mean metallicity of [ fe / h ] = @xmath13 , but the s / n was too low to constrain metallicities of individual clusters . in this paper",
    "we present new spectra for gcs in the sombrero , selected from the paper i sample .",
    "of 17 gc candidates , 14 are confirmed as gcs .",
    "combining our data with those of @xcite , the total number of confirmed gcs in the sombrero is increased to 48 .",
    "the best of our spectra have a s / n of about 50 per pixel , allowing us to accurately measure the metallicities of individual clusters and compare with previous photometric estimates .",
    "by co - adding the spectra of blue ( metal - poor ) and red ( metal - rich ) clusters , we also put constraints on the ages ( section [ sec : popsynt ] ) and abundance ratios ( section [ sec : alpha ] ) of the sombrero gc subpopulations .",
    "finally , we use all available gc radial velocities in the sombrero to constrain the mass of the sombrero galaxy ( section [ sec : mass ] ) .",
    "the data were obtained with the lris spectrograph @xcite on the keck i telescope during two observing runs on 2001 , april 28 and may 1920 .",
    "we utilized the newly installed blue side on lris ( `` lris - b '' ) and a dichroic splitting at 5600  to simultaneously obtain blue and red spectra , covering the regions @xmath1435005500  and @xmath1457008500 , respectively . on the blue side",
    "a 400 l / mm grism was used , providing a dispersion of 1.74  pix@xmath15 and a resolution of @xmath16 . on the red side we used a 600 l / mm grating blazed at 5000 , with a dispersion of 1.28  pix@xmath15 and a resolution of @xmath17 .",
    "in addition to the multislit spectra of sombrero gc candidates , we also obtained long - slit spectra for a number of radial velocity standard stars , flux standards , and lick / ids standard stars from @xcite .    because of anticipated problems with `` ghosts '' in lris - b , we applied 2  offsets to the telescope pointing for some exposures .",
    "although these offsets were intended to be parallel to the slitlets , we found that they inevitably included some component perpendicular to the slits as well , resulting in greatly reduced signal from our science targets .",
    "thus , we quickly decided to abandon this procedure .",
    "another problem was related to the input coordinates . for the april run we used coordinates",
    "measured directly on the `` central '' and `` inner halo '' wfpc2 images from paper i , using the metric task in the stsdas package .",
    "unfortunately , there were systematic differences between the two wfpc2 pointings which made it impossible to align all objects in the slitlets at the same time .",
    "for the may run we used direct images from the april run to alleviate this problem , but as a result of these slitmask alignment problems , we achieved a significantly lower s / n for some of the objects than could have been possible under optimal circumstances .",
    "following initial processing of the images ( bias subtraction , flatfielding ) , the spectra were extracted using standard tools in the iraf specred package .",
    "as the spectra were obtained over several hours , significant shifts in the wavelength scale due to mechanical flexure were found to be present between individual integrations , amounting to up to @xmath18  .",
    "assuming that all spectra in a given exposure were subject to the same shifts , the shifts were determined by cross - correlating the spectra of the brightest objects in each exposure with the spectra in a reference exposure , taken immediately before the arc spectra . for the red spectra ,",
    "the wavelength zero - point was further fine - tuned using the nad night sky lines at @xmath19 5890 and 5896  .",
    "finally , the individual spectra of each object were co - added , using a sigma - clipping algorithm to reject cosmic ray events .",
    "the s / n at each pixel in the combined spectra was estimated from the variance of the combined pixels .",
    "the total integration time was @xmath20 hours .",
    "table  [ tab : clusters ] lists all science objects for which spectra were obtained .",
    "the object ids refer to paper i , where the coordinates are listed . for convenience , we have also included the @xmath21 photometry from paper i. note that the brightest cluster , h222 , was saturated on the wfpc2 data used in paper i , making its  color unreliable .",
    "the radial velocities in table  [ tab : clusters ] are generally measured on the red spectra , for which the wavelength calibration zero - point could be checked using the night sky lines .",
    "the errors on the radial velocities in table  [ tab : clusters ] are random errors , based on the uncertainties in the location of the cross - correlation peak reported by the fxcor task .",
    "these do not take into account various systematic errors , mostly due to uncertainties in wavelength calibration .",
    "we estimate that such errors are on the order @xmath22 , or @xmath23 km / s .",
    "no skylines were present in the blue spectra , and differences of 100150 km / s between radial velocities measured on the blue and red spectra were not uncommon .",
    "another problem with the wavelength calibration in the blue stems from the fact that the calibration lamps in lris only had a few ( 57 ) suitable lines .",
    "the best fitting 2nd order polynomial wavelength solutions in the blue generally had a significant residual scatter ( 12 ) , presumably indicating that higher - order terms ought to be included in the wavelength solution , but the small number of calibration lines made it impossible to include higher - order terms .",
    "the radial velocity of the sombrero galaxy is listed as 1024 km / s in the rc3 catalogue @xcite .",
    "if we exclude the three objects in table  [ tab : clusters ] with rv@xmath24600 km / s , we are left with a sample of 14 globular clusters .",
    "these have a mean radial velocity of 1019 km / s and a dispersion of 246 km / s , in excellent agreement with the radial velocity of the sombrero itself . of the three objects with radial velocities",
    "less than 600 km / s , two ( h2 - 06 and h2 - 10 ) are very compact and essentially unresolved on the hst images with effective radii @xmath25 0.3 pc @xcite and are most likely foreground stars .",
    "the third ( h2 - 27 ) is quite well - resolved on the hst images and has an effective radius of 3.4 pc , typical for globular clusters .",
    "it therefore seems likely that this object is indeed a globular cluster .",
    "the s / n of this spectrum is very poor and the cross - correlation signal was not very strong , so the radial velocity may be in error .",
    "in fact , using the blue spectrum of this object , we get a radial velocity of 1069 km / s .",
    "because of the uncertain radial velocity and poor s /",
    "n we exclude this object from further analysis in this paper .",
    "before spectrophotometric indices were measured , the spectra must be corrected for radial velocity . rather than blindly applying the radial velocities in table  [ tab : clusters ] to the blue spectra",
    ", we used a number of easily identifiable features such as the h@xmath8 , h@xmath11 , h@xmath12 , ca ii h@xmath26k lines and the g - band to determine small zero - point shifts and scale corrections to the dispersion solutions .",
    "thus , the wavelength scale of the final spectra used for the spectrophotometric analysis was typically accurate to better than 1  in the region of interest ( i.e. @xmath275400  ) .",
    "in order to test if there might be any systematic differences between indices measured on lris - b spectra and the standard lick / ids system , we observed a number of stars from @xcite in longslit mode . in fig .",
    "[ fig : stdcmp ] we compare our lris - b measurements of all lick / ids indices that were covered by our blue spectra with the standard values .",
    "generally , our measurements agree well with the standard values , although there are slight systematic offsets for some of the narrower indices like ca4227 and ca4455 .",
    "this may be attributed to the slightly higher resolution of lris - b compared to the lick / ids spectrograph .",
    "unfortunately , the wavelength range covered in longslit mode by lris is slightly different from the one covered in multislit mode and does not extend beyond 5300 .",
    "therefore , several key indices ( such as , fe5270 and fe5335 ) redward of this limit could not be compared .",
    "furthermore , since this part of the spectrum is not covered by the flux standards , the flux calibration of the multislit spectra beyond 5300  also becomes uncertain .",
    "this is particularly problematic because the blue reflection efficiency of the dichroic already begins to drop around @xmath145300 .",
    "we derived metallicities for each gc using the calibration by @xcite , but adopting the modification to the error on the combined metallicity estimate described in @xcite .",
    "metallicities for each of the individual calibrators , as well as the combined metallicity estimates are listed in table  [ tab : mettab ] . for comparison",
    "we have also included photometric metallicities based on the  colors in table  [ tab : clusters ] and the calibration in @xcite .",
    "the spectroscopic and photometric metallicity estimates are compared in fig .",
    "[ fig : metcmp ] and generally agree quite well . three representative globular cluster spectra with low , intermediate and high metallicities are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] .",
    "high s / n spectra have the potential to remove the age - metallicity degeneracy inherent in photometric studies . at least in principle , ages are well constrained by balmer line strengths , while metallicity information is provided by indices such as fe5270 , fe5335 and  @xcite .",
    "here we compare our sombrero spectra with two sets of recent population synthesis models , kindly provided by c.  maraston ( see * ? ? ? * ) and r.schiavon @xcite . like",
    "most of the current models , the maraston models are based on the `` fitting '' functions by @xcite .",
    "the schiavon models are based on a new set of fitting functions derived from the spectral library of @xcite , and also include empirical corrections to the luminosity function of red giants @xcite .",
    "we use a preliminary version of the schiavon models where only the balmer line indices are based on the new fitting functions , i.e.other indices such as ,  and the various fe indices are still based on the worthey fitting functions .",
    "the schiavon models also cover a more limited age / metallicity range than the maraston models , but the comparison nevertheless provides some useful insight into the differences between various available models .",
    "as discussed in sect  [ sec : stdcmp ] , our instrumental system appears to be very similar to the lick / ids system so we have not applied any corrections to spectrophotometric indices measured on the lris - b spectra .",
    "as mentioned earlier , some indices may be compromised by difficulties with the calibration of the blue spectra redward of 5300 .",
    "the  index is particularly vulnerable to such problems because of the wide separation between the continuum passbands , and offsets are frequently found between the standard lick / ids indices and instrumental systems ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : mgb_mg2 ] we compare our measurements of  with , which is slightly narrower but measures essentially the same feature .",
    "however , while the continuum passbands of  are located about 150  from the feature passband , those of  are located adjacent to it , making  much less sensitive to errors in the continuum slope .",
    "generally , fig .",
    "[ fig : mgb_mg2 ] shows that the two mg sensitive indices correlate well , but the slope of our observed   relation is shallower than the maraston model predictions , which in turn agree well with ",
    "plots in e.g. @xcite and @xcite .",
    "one possible explanation for this discrepancy is that errors in the continuum level at the position of the red continuum passband cause us to measure too low values for the  index because of uncorrected reduced throughput by the dichroic .",
    "another possibility is that peculiarities in the abundance patterns affect the continuum passbands of  and  in different ways @xcite .    in fig .  [",
    "fig : popmod ] we compare various index measurements with the maraston and schiavon model predictions .",
    "the schiavon models are tabulated at 5 , 7.9 , 11.2 and 14.1 gyr and at metallicities of  = @xmath28 , @xmath29 , 0.0 and @xmath30 .",
    "while the maraston models are tabulated at 1 gyr intervals from 2 to 15 gyrs , we have plotted only the 5 , 8 , 11 and 14 gyr models , for easy comparison with the schiavon models .",
    "note that the metallicity divisions of the maraston models are different from those of the schiavon models (= @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , 0.00 and @xmath34 ) .",

    "we show h@xmath35 and h@xmath36 vs.  , using the definitions in @xcite . because of the difficulties with the calibration of  discussed earlier , we have chosen  instead of  even though the formal errors on  are somewhat larger .",
    "the errors on the indices were estimated directly from the s / n of the spectra .",
    "to first order , fig .",
    "[ fig : popmod ] indicates high ages for most clusters , although the error bars are generally still too large to put strong constraints on the ages of individual clusters . in order to compare the mean properties of metal - rich and metal - poor gcs , we therefore co - added all spectra with [ fe / h]@xmath37 and [ fe / h]@xmath38 , respectively .",
    "the co - added spectra are shown in figure  [ fig : sp_coadd ] and the corresponding datapoints are shown with filled circles in fig .",
    "[ fig : popmod ] . in the h@xmath8 plots both the metal - poor and metal - rich co - added datapoints fall near the @xmath39 gyr maraston isochrones , with little evidence of any significant age differences between the two within the formal @xmath40 gyr error bars on the co - added data .",
    "the schiavon models tend to predict lower ages for a given h@xmath8 index than the maraston models , especially at younger ages and lower metallicities . at the location of the metal - rich sombrero gcs in the ",
    "h@xmath8 plane the difference is relatively modest and amounts to an age difference of only 12 gyrs , but at lower metallicities the difference between the two sets of models becomes more pronounced and amounts to about 4 gyrs at the lowest metallicity tabulated by schiavon .",
    "thus , the trend in these models is to decrease the ages of the metal - poor clusters more than those of the metal - rich ones , relative to the maraston models .    the h@xmath35 and h@xmath36 measurements basically confirm the ages estimated from h@xmath8 , but note that both h@xmath35 and h@xmath36 reach a minimum around 11 gyr at low metallicities and then increase strongly at higher ages . at @xmath10$}}\\",

    ". the schiavon models do not include tabulations of h@xmath35 and h@xmath36 , but in figure  [ fig : hgv_fe ] we show their predictions for another h@xmath11 index defined by @xcite .",
    "this h@xmath11 index ( in the following denoted h@xmath41 ) differs from h@xmath35 in that the continuum passbands are located closer to the feature passband , thereby avoiding the strong metallicity dependence of h@xmath35 which results from its blue continuum passband coinciding with the g  band . in fact , figure  [ fig : hgv_fe ] shows that h@xmath41 is practically independent of metallicity , at least within the range spanned by the models .",
    "taken at face value , figure  [ fig : hgv_fe ] would suggest that the metal - rich clusters are slightly _ older _ than the metal - poor ones , but both sub - populations are compatible with the same ( high ) age within the errors .",
    "thus , although it should be stressed that even relative ages may still be somewhat model - dependent , it seems reasonable to conclude that both gc sub - populations in the sombrero are old , and probably coeval to within the measurement uncertainties , i.e.  with age differences of 23 gyrs at most .",
    "some attempts to model the effect of @xmath9-element enhancement on lick indices have been made by @xcite , who modeled the effect of @xmath9-element enhancement on the lick  index and a broad index ( tio@xmath42 ) covering the tio band centered at 7257  .",
    "the tio@xmath42 index is included in our red lris spectra .",

    "we found that the linear relation @xmath43 approximated the maraston models to within 0.1   for the age range 1015 gyr and @xmath44 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mgb_mg2 ] ) .",
    "in addition to the strong terrestrial o@xmath45 absorption bands , which are located just outside the tio@xmath42 continuum passbands , the wavelength region around 72007500  is affected by terrestrial h@xmath45o absorption .",
    "we corrected our red spectra for this by normalizing the flux standard spectra with a smooth continuum and then dividing the gc spectra by the normalized flux standard spectra .",
    "this correction affected the tio@xmath42 index downwards by about 7 .",
    "[ fig : fe_alpha ] shows our measurements of tio@xmath42 and @xmath46 on the co - added spectra , compared to the alpha - enhanced models by @xcite . in the @xmath47 plot we also show the maraston models for an age of 12 gyr .",
