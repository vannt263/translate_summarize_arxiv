    "circumstellar disks are found around most , if not all , young stars .",
    "at least 5 @xmath3 of these circumstellar disks are likely planet - forming @xcite and it is commonly believed that our solar system formed from a solar nebula similar to circumstellar disks found around young stars ( russell et al . , met . and early solar system ii in press ) .",
    "initially these disks are composed of gas and dust from the interstellar medium .",
    "theoretical models predict that collisions between grains and subsequent coagulation result in modified grain size distributions and eventually the growth of planetesimals @xcite .",
    "however , observational evidence of this process remains elusive @xcite .",
    "one way to gain insight into the process of grain growth , planetesimal evolution , and eventually planet formation , is to constrain the effects of these processes on the observed mid - infrared spectra from circumstellar dust .",
    "grain growth and changes in composition due to dust processing in circumstellar disks can have dramatic effects on the observed spectrum of the dust in emission and absorption . in this contribution",
    ", we attempt to quantify those effects and place them in the context of modern theories of disk evolution and planet formation .",
    "dust in the interstellar medium , and thus in the early stages of star formation , consists primarily of oxygen - rich silicates and carbon - rich grains ( for summary , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) from a wide range of sources , including stellar atmospheres , novae , supernovae .",
    "these silicates are either olivines ( mg@xmath4fe@xmath5sio@xmath6 ) , ranging from fayalite ( @xmath7 ) to forsterite ( @xmath8 ) , or pyroxenes ( mg@xmath9fe@xmath5sio@xmath10 ) , ranging from ferrosillite ( @xmath7 ) to enstatite ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "silicate condensates formed in supernovae and during star formation are primarily fe - rich and amorphous , but at high temperatures , mg - rich crystalline silicates ( i.e. , pure forsterite and enstatite ) are produced . the fraction of pyroxenes versus olivines depends on both temperature and pressure . for a given pressure , the pyroxenes ( e.g. , enstatite ) dominate at low temperatures and",
    "becomes less abundant with increasing temperature ( at equilibrium ) .",
    "the olivines ( e.g. , forsterite ) form a significant fraction of the mixture only for a narrow region in pressure - temperature space .",
    "the low temperatures of the ism are expected to result in amorphous mixtures of olivines and pyroxenes with olivine the dominant component .",
    "indeed , strong smooth features near 9.7 ( si - o stretching mode ) and 18.5 @xmath0 m ( o - si - o bending mode ) are observed in absorption along lines of sight through the diffuse interstellar medium @xcite .",
    "molecular clouds also possess a mixture of olivines and pyroxenes , which are expected to remain amorphous due to cosmic ray impacts ; a broad structureless band centered near 10 @xmath0 m is observed toward several objects @xcite .",
    "observations by @xcite suggest a shift from amorphous olivine dominated grains in diffuse - medium environments to amorphous pyroxenes in molecular clouds and ysos , indicating that some dust processing is occurring during the early stages of star formation .",
    "further processing is evidenced by the presence of crystalline silicates in the dust surrounding some main sequence stars , with amorphous olivine and forsterite as the dominant components ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "comets also contain both amorphous and crystalline silicates ( see review by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with crystalline fractions that are too high ( up to 30@xmath3 by mass ) to be accounted for by the ism ( where the crystalline fraction is @xmath11  2@xmath3 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , indicating that crystallization occurred in the proto - solar nebula .",
    "differences in the silicate spectra of interstellar versus solar - system dust suggest an evolutionary sequence in which the grain composition changes from amorphous olivine to crystalline forsterite during the star and solar system formation process .",
    "dust grains in accretion disks around young stars therefore must be significantly modified with respect to those of the ism and are thus excellent laboratories for the study of _ in situ _ crystallization of silicates .",
    "if crystallization proceeds via annealing , then silicates in the outer disk are expected to accrete icy mantles and retain cores that are similar to ism dust ( i.e. , amorphous olivine and pyroxene ) , while in the inner disk ( t @xmath12 800 k ) , microcrystalline lattice structures on 0.001 @xmath0 m size scales can form within silicate grains @xcite . if annealing continues for a sufficiently long time , or occurs in a sufficiently hot environment , crystallization spreads from these critical nuclei over the entire grain . at disk radii corresponding to temperatures above @xmath1 1000",
    "k , 0.11 @xmath0 m grains should be completely crystallized @xcite and larger dust grains should possess regions of localized crystallization detectable in ir spectra @xcite .",
    "increases in temperature are also predicted to result in conversion from pyroxenes to olivines .",
    "thus we would expect both crystallization and composition ( i.e. , the content of fe vs. mg and olivine vs. pyroxene ) of the silicates in disks to be dependent on exposure to stellar radiation ( e.g. , location in the disk , disk geometry , stellar type ) and/or the duration of processing ( e.g. , amount of disk turbulence , disk age ) .",
    "high spectral resolution studies of the warm dust emission near 10 @xmath0 m are vital in understanding the composition and processing of dust in the planet - forming region ( 110 au ) of circumstellar disks around young stars .",
    "the dominant feature in the 813  @xmath0 m spectral region accessible from the ground is from amorphous olivine ( peaking at 9.5 @xmath0 m ) , with weaker features arising from silica ( sio@xmath13 ; 8.6 @xmath0 m ) and crystalline silicates including enstatite ( mgsio@xmath10 ; 9.2 , 10.4 @xmath0 m ) and forsterite ( mg@xmath13sio@xmath6 ; 10.2 , 11.3 @xmath0 m ) .",
    "the transition from amorphous olivine to crystalline forsterite results in a predicted shift of the silicate emission feature from 9.7 to 11.3 @xmath0 m .",
    "however , analysis of the 10 @xmath0 m silicate feature is complicated by the fact that the strength and shape of the emission can not be uniquely correlated with abundance or composition .",
    "the presence of organics on grain surfaces results in increased opacity at @xmath14 @xmath11 6 @xmath0 m and decreased contrast between the silicate band at 10  @xmath0 m and the adjacent continuum @xcite .",
    "grain size has a similar effect and for large grains ( @xmath15  @xmath0",
    "m ) the silicate bands disappear almost entirely @xcite .",
    "additionally , @xcite suggest that grain shape also needs to be taken into account in the interpretation of silicate spectra , particularly for strong crystalline bands , for which a combination of spherical and ellipsoidal grains may be required .",
    "disk morphology and optical depth also influence the shape / strength of the silicate feature @xcite . despite difficulties in constructing unique interpretations ,",
    "a number of ground- and space - based studies of the disks around t tauri and herbig ae / be ( hereafter referred to as haebe ) stars have been conducted , yielding important constraints on the evolution of circumstellar material .",
    "early studies of young low - mass stars @xcite show a single , rather sharp peak between 9 and 10 @xmath0 m , resembling molecular clouds and the diffuse ism .",
    "iso spectra of young low - mass stars in chameleon @xcite display 10 @xmath0 m silicate emission that is significantly broader and stronger than that from the diffuse ism , but consistent with the emission predicted by a simple radiation transfer model of @xmath111 @xmath0 m amorphous pyroxene and/or olivine grains in a flared disk .",
    "more recent surveys ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "haebe stars were studied more extensively with iso and , based on 245 @xmath0 m iso spectra of haebe stars spanning a range of ages , an evolutionary sequence has been suggested @xcite . in this sequence ,",
    "rising featureless dense cloud core spectra proceed to strong amorphous 10 @xmath0 m silicate absorption from embedded protostars .",
    "these are followed by optically thick protoplanetary disks with spectra showing warm 10 @xmath0 m silicate dust emission and prominent cold dust emission longward of 15 @xmath0 m , then spectra with only warm dust interpreted as arising from disks undergoing planet formation , and finally the most evolved sources with nearly photospheric spectra , indicating disk dispersal . in addition to this general evolutionary trend , iso detected crystalline silicate emission bands ( 11.3 , 27.5 , 33.5 , 35.8 and 70 @xmath0 m ) toward a modest sample of haebe star+disk systems @xcite .",
    "the longer wavelength emission bands are highly dependent on the structure of the dust .",
    "these studies show large variations in dust crystallinity and composition among ysos of similar age and stellar properties @xcite , indicating the necessity of large samples to test scenarios of disk evolution",
    ".    objects that may be in transition between primordial dust and debris dust ( generated through collisions of planetesimals ) , or which are fully debris , have also been investigated @xcite revealing generally photospheric or continuum excess spectra .",
    "the 10 @xmath0 m spectrum of the 12@xmath16 myr old @xcite a star @xmath2 pictoris , however , exhibits a remarkable resemblance to that of solar system grains and comets , suggesting a mixture of crystalline and amorphous material @xcite .",
    "direct imaging of @xmath2 pictoris shows a warped disk that is potentially caused by collisions of planetesimals and may be shaped by recent planet formation @xcite .",
    "spatially resolved 10 @xmath0 m spectroscopy of @xmath2 pictoris @xcite revealed that the silicate emission arises only from dust within 20 au of the star , compared to the 77 au emitting region in the continuum .",
    "furthermore , the mixture of amorphous and crystalline dust appears to remain constant , suggesting that the crystallization process may be acting uniformly as a function of radius within the planet formation region .",
    "observations of silicate emission toward young stellar objects in a variety of evolutionary stages can provide valuable information about the modification of dust during solar system formation . in the present study ,",
    "813 @xmath0 m spectra were obtained for 34 low- and intermediate - mass young stars , ranging from embedded protostars to debris disk systems .",

    "one possible difference between the low- and intermediate - mass stars in our sample is that for the intermediate - mass stars , crystalline silicates have been found in sources which possess large near- and far - ir excesses , but the one low - mass star toward which crystalline silicates have been found , hen 3 - 600a ( see also * ? ? ?",

    "furthermore , the broad silicate emission feature observed toward aa tau , which shows no evidence of emission from crystalline forsterite , is quite weak and lies in the middle of the trend .",
    "therefore , the shift in the wavelength of maximum emission in the 10 @xmath0 m region , or the `` 9.8-to-11.3 @xmath0 m phase transition '' , appears to be largely dependent grain size variations and thus is in fact _ not _ a good indicator of crystallization fraction .",
    "if the trends depicted in figure  [ fig : vbfit ] primarily indicate a change in the grain size , then they suggest a progressive removal of small grains ( @xmath11 2 @xmath0 m ) from the warm ( t @xmath23 300k ) disk surface probed by the 10 @xmath0 m feature .",

    "this suggests an absence of small ( @xmath72 m ) , warm ( t@xmath23300 k ) _ crystalline _ silicates in these t tauri star disks , but colder or larger crystalline silicate grains may still be present and , if so , will be visible through far - infrared lattice modes accessible from space born observations . * a correlation between the peak shape as traced by f@xmath73f@xmath71 and feature strength for 5 t tauri and 5 haebe in our sample was also found . this is consistent with that seen for several haebe stars @xcite and t tauri stars @xcite , which are attributed to changes in grain size ( from 0.12 @xmath0 m )",
    ". the entire sample can be fit best with a single trend , including spectra with strong indications of crystalline forsterite .",
    "the wavelength of maximum emission was also found to be correlated with peak strength for our sample .",
    "this indicates that interpretation of the `` 9.8-to-11.3 @xmath0 m phase transition '' must therefore include analysis of grain size in addition to crystallization fraction .",
    "* we also demonstrate that the flux at 11.3 @xmath0 m does not increase at the expense of that at 9.8 @xmath0 m . if crystallization is dominating the transition , then this indicates that the crystalline forsterite emitting near 11.3 @xmath0 m was likely not formed from the population of amorphous olivine emitting near 9.8 @xmath0 m , suggesting a more complex crystallization mechanism .",
    "another interpretation is that the relationship between the 11.3 and 9.8 @xmath0 m fluxes is _ dominated _ by grain size effects and not crystallization .",
    "silicate emission features in solar - mass t tauri stars have primarily been observed in the 10 @xmath0 m atmospheric window ( as in this study ) . due to sensitivity limitations , iso studies of silicates focused on intermediate or high - mass stars .",
    "the spitzer space telescope will be used to expand these studies for a large sample of low - mass stars , ranging from embedded protostars to optically thin disks , via the combination of various gto programs and the c2d ( @xmath74 ) and feps ( @xmath75 ) legacy programs . in this manner , the study of the crystalline and amorphous silicates in disks , will be expanded to include disks around low - mass , sun - like stars , creating a database analogous to iso studies of high / intermediate - mass stars .",
    "these studies will include longer wavelength silicate bands , which depend intricately on the coordination of the silicon atoms and can provide more specific information about the minerals present , including the mg / fe ratio .",
    "the mineral content of the grains in each stage of evolution can thus be directly compared to that of meteorites , asteroids and comets .",

    "long term monitoring of several sources , including dg tau @xcite and hd 45677 @xcite , has revealed dramatic variations in the strength and shape of silicate features over periods of months to years .",
    "observations of dg tau revealed that although the dust continuum remained fairly constant , the silicate feature evolved from nearly featureless continuum to emission from crystalline and amorphous silicates to emission from primarily amorphous silicates and , finally , to absorption from amorphous silicates between 1996 and 2000 .",
    "@xcite indicate that these variations in the silicate feature are due to dust in the optically thin disk surface , and that the continuum is produced by the underlying disk midplane ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    ", the flux of the silicate emission feature was observed to decrease by @xmath130% between 1980 and 1992 , coincident with an increase in the stellar flux of @xmath160% @xcite .",
    "the authors suggest a scenario in which long - term ( decade - long ) variations in uv and optical flux are due to a clear hole moving into the line of sight , which is possibly coupled with a loss of small grains , as indicated by the change in flux of the silicate feature .",

    "in particular , the 11.3 @xmath0 m feature ( crystalline forsterite ) is much less prominent in our observations and there is an additional peak at @xmath110.5 @xmath0 m ( near the position of crystalline enstatite ) .",
    "however , the ( peak - to - continuum ) strength of the feature is the same to within @xmath115@xmath3 .",
    "the observations of hen 3 - 600a by @xcite ( subaru comics , 2001 december 27 ) also suggest strong evidence of variability when compared to our data ( figure  [ fig : tts ] , 2000 february 21 ) .",
    "our spectrum shows much less emission at 9.2 @xmath0 m and possibly 10.3 @xmath0 m ( both attributed to enstatite ) , with the peak at 11.3 @xmath0 m ( forsterite ) dominating the spectrum .",
    "there also appears to be an accompanying decrease in the continuum or in the strength of emission near 12.5 @xmath0 m from 2000 to 2001 .",
    "there is no obvious trend in the variability with respect to spectral parameters or silicate emission feature shape from these observations .",
    "hd 179218 and hen 3 - 600a have similar emission features , ages and are in similar evolutionary stages ( although their mass differs by a factor of 2).yet the spectrum of hen 3 - 600a is highly variable on 1 yr timescales while the spectrum of hd 179218 has not changed in @xmath38  3 yr .",
    "although hd 163296 and mwc 480 possessed similar spectra in 1996 @xcite , the spectra for these sources are quite different from each other in 1999 ( our data ) .",
    "mwc 480 has undergone changes in the spectrum that indicate conversion between the crystalline forms of forsterite ( mg@xmath13sio@xmath6 ) and enstatite ( mgsio@xmath10 ) .",
    "this conversion , also seen in the hen 3 - 600a spectrum , is the opposite of the expected transition with time during the standard annealing process ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    studies of the variability of silicate emission may provide valuable information about the mechanisms of grain growth and/or crystallization that affect the feature shape .",
