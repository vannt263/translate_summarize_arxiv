    "in the darwinian view of nature @xcite , biological evolution is a fierce competition among different organisms in which the winners are rewarded by copious offspring while the losers perish .",
    "it should therefore be no surprise to see metaphors from the world of athletics turn up in the description of evolutionary dynamics .",
    "indeed , every evolutionary innovation that is fixed in a population has to be a _",
    "record _ , in the sense that it solves some problem encountered by the organism in a way that is superior to all existing solutions .",
    "a possible mathematical relationship between evolution models and the theory of records was suggested by kauffman and levin in the context of long - jump adaption on correlated fitness landscapes @xcite , and has more recently been elaborated by sibani and coworkers @xcite .",
    "the basic problem of record statistics can be formulated as follows @xcite : given an ordered sequence @xmath2 of real random variables ( rv s ) , a _ record _ occurs at @xmath3 iff @xmath4 by convention , @xmath5 is always a record , and through application of ( [ record ] ) a series of _ record times _ @xmath6 and _ record values _",
    "@xmath7 is generated from the underlying sequence @xmath8 , with @xmath9 denoting the time of the @xmath10th record and @xmath11 .",
    "many properties of records are known for the case when the @xmath12 are independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . ) . in particular , the statistics of the record times is completely independent of the underlying probability distribution .",
    "this is largely a consequence of a simple symmetry argument @xcite .",
    "denote by @xmath13 the probability that a record occurs at @xmath14 . in the i.i.d .",
    "case , each of the @xmath14 rv s @xmath15 is equally likely to be the largest , and hence @xmath16 .",
    "in particular , the expected number of records @xmath17 up to time @xmath14 is equal to @xmath18 the full distribution of @xmath19 becomes poissonian for large @xmath14 , and the record sequence can be described as a poisson process in logarithmic time @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it can be shown that the ratios of subsequent record times @xmath21 become uniformly distributed , independent random variables for large @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "this implies that the sequence @xmath22 of record times has some rather counterintuitive properties ; for example , given the time @xmath9 of the @xmath10th record , the expected time of the preceding record is @xmath23 , while the expected time @xmath24 of the next record is infinite rather than as @xmath25 @xcite . ] .",
    "the record sequence is distinctly non - stationary : with increasing time , it becomes exponentially harder to beat the current record .",
    "for this reason record dynamics and the associated log - poisson process has been invoked to describe the nonstationary aspects of macroevolutionary dynamics @xcite ( as evidenced e.g. by extinction and origination rates of taxa in the fossil record @xcite ) , as well as the relaxation of disordered systems such as spin glasses @xcite . the pattern of static periods of exponentially increasing duration interspersed by rare events of rapid change ( new records ) is a simple realization of _ punctuated equilibrium _ , an important paradigm of evolutionary theory @xcite .    here",
    "we approach the relation between evolution and records from the point of view of population dynamics on the space of genetic sequences @xcite .",
    "we show how the properties of sequence space introduce modifications to the standard record problem , which are of interest in their own right , and only partly understood at present .",
    "some basic notions are introduced in the next section , and the remaining sections summarize the main results of a detailed investigation , which will be published elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the proper arena in which to describe evolutionary dynamics is the space of genotypes , which are represented as sequences @xmath26 of @xmath0 symbols taken from an alphabet of @xmath27 letters ; for dna sequences @xmath28 , but in many theoretical studies binary sequences ( @xmath29 ) are considered for simplicity .",
    "the total number of possible sequences is @xmath30 .",
    "the nearest neighbors of a given sequence @xmath31 are those sequences @xmath32 that can be reached from @xmath31 by a single point mutation , which alters one of the @xmath0 symbols .",
    "more generally , the _ hamming distance _ @xmath33 beween two sequences @xmath31 and @xmath32 is the number of symbols in which the two differ .",
    "an important quantity in what follows is the number @xmath34 of sequences at distance @xmath10 from a given sequence , which takes the form @xmath35 this can be derived by noting that there are @xmath36 ways of choosing @xmath10 mutation sites on the sequence , and at each site @xmath37 different symbols are available .",
    "the maximum distance between two sequences is @xmath0 . for large @xmath0 ( [ alphak ] ) takes the form of a gaussian of width @xmath1 centered around the distance @xmath38 at which the majority of sequences reside .",
    "next we have to associate a fitness with each sequence @xmath31 .",
    "we define the fitness @xmath39 , in the wrightian sense @xcite , to be _ proportional to the expected number of offspring of an individual carrying the genotype @xmath31 _ @xcite .",
    "this implies that @xmath40 , and only ratios of fitnesses matter .",
    "we can thus write @xmath41 to introduce an _ inverse selective temperature _ @xmath42 @xcite for later use .",
    "in the following both @xmath43 and @xmath44 will be referred to as `` fitness '' .",
    "the mapping from genotype to fitness is largely unknown , but it is expected to be very complicated . we therefore follow a common practice and assume the @xmath45 to be quenched i.i.d .",
    "rv s drawn from some distribution @xmath46 ; in statistical physics this is known as the _ random energy model _ ( rem ) of spin glasses @xcite , while in the context of evolutionary biology it has been referred to as the _ house of cards model _ @xcite or the _ uncorrelated fitness landscape _ @xcite .",
    "many properties of the rem fitness landscape , such as the number of local fitness maxima and the length of uphill adaptive walks @xcite , can be derived using simple ideas from order statistics @xcite .",
    "it is of particular interest to find properties that are independent of the fitness distribution .",
    "for example , the probability that a given sequence is a local maximum is equal to the probability that it has the largest fitness in the set of sequences comprising its @xmath47 nearest neighbors and itself ; by the symmetry argument of sect.[records ] , this is just @xmath48^{-1}$ ] .",
    "important characteristics of the rem landscape needed in the following discussion are the expected maximum fitness value @xmath49 that occurs among the @xmath50 independent sequences , and the _ fitness gap _ @xmath51 , which is the difference between the largest and the second largest fitness value @xcite .",
    "a simple estimate for the maximum fitness is obtained by setting the cumulative fitness distribution @xmath52 equal to @xmath53 @xcite , @xmath54 and the fitness gap is of the order of @xmath55^{-1}$ ] @xcite .",
    "kauffman and levin @xcite found record statistics to be applicable in a situation where a population , assumed to be localized at a single sequence at all times , explores sequence space by random mutations of arbitrarily long range , and moves to a new location whenever the fitness of the mutant exceeds that of the present position . to highlight the role of the geometry of sequence space",
    ", we consider here a variant of their model where the range of mutations is restricted but grows in the course of time . at time @xmath56 the entire population resides at a randomly chosen `` seed '' sequence @xmath57 . at the integer time @xmath58 , the population has access to all genotypes within hamming distance @xmath59 of @xmath57 , and it always resides in its entirety at the sequence of maximum fitness within the accessible region .",
    "thus the current position of the population in sequence space",
    "_ jumps _ whenever a fitness record occurs among the @xmath34 sequences which become newly available at time @xmath60 .",
    "the analysis of this model requires a slight generalization of the basic symmetry argument of record statistics outlined above , which is adapted to a situation where a variable number of new i.i.d .",
    "rv s is introduced at each time step @xcite : as the newly introduced rv s are indistinguishable from those that have appeared at earlier times , the probability that a record occurs among them is simply equal to @xmath61 in the last step the expression ( [ alphak ] ) has been inserted and an expansion for @xmath62 at fixed @xmath63 has been carried out @xcite .",
    "the probability @xmath64 starts out at unity and dwindles to zero as @xmath10 approaches the value @xmath65 of the hamming distance at which the majority of sequences reside ; the process stops at @xmath66 , when the globally fittest sequence @xmath67 ( which is located with certainty at @xmath65 for large @xmath0 ) is reached .",
    "in contrast to the logarithmic increase ( [ log ] ) in the i.i.d .",
    "case , here new records are found quite frequently , at least when @xmath68 .",
    "this is because of the exponential growth of the number of available sequences with increasing distance from the seed , which compensates the scarcity of new records .    integrating ( [ pk ] ) from @xmath69",
    "to @xmath65 one finds that the mean of the total number of records @xmath70 that are encountered during the evolution is given by @xmath71 it can be shown that the occurrences of records are independent events in this model @xcite , and hence the variance and higher moments of @xmath70 can also be computed from the @xmath64 .",
    "the variance is @xmath72 for large @xmath0 , which decreases with increasing @xmath27 .",
    "thus asymptotically @xmath70 is a normal rv with fluctuations of order @xmath1 .",
    "in addition , analytic results for the the spacings between records are reported in @xcite .",
    "for a somewhat more realistic description of the population dynamics , we turn to eigen s quasispecies model @xcite , arguably the simplest mathematical model that implements the basic mechanisms of selection and mutation for a genetically heterogeneous population on the level of the sequence space @xcite . the model was introduced to describe the population dynamics of asexually reproducing entities like self - replicating macromolecules .",
    "it can be applied whenever the population size is large , so that the number of individuals occupying a given site in sequence space can be represented by a continuous variable . because of the exponential proliferation of the number of sequences with increasing @xmath0 , real populations are very sparse in sequence space , which severely limits the applicability of a continuum description .",
    "we nevertheless believe that it is important to first understand the long time dynamics of sequence space evolution in the continuum setting , before taking into account the effects of the discreteness of real populations .    in the quasispecies model ,",
    "the population @xmath73 of genotype @xmath31 at time @xmath74 evolves in discrete time according to the linear recursion relation @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the mutation probability that sequence @xmath31 appears as offspring of sequence @xmath32 . assuming that single point mutations occur with probability @xmath77 per generation",
    ", the mutation probability takes the form @xmath78    consider a population that is initially localized at a seed sequence @xmath57 , i.e. , the initial condition for ( [ quasi ] ) is @xmath79 . then after one time step we have @xmath80^{d(\\sigma,\\sigma_0 ) }   \\sim \\exp[-d(\\sigma,\\sigma_0)/\\lambda].\\ ] ]",
    "the population density is now nonzero everywhere , with a magnitude decaying exponentially with increasing distance from the seed sequence , where the decay length is @xmath81 $ ] . at this point",
    "individuals with genotypes far away from the seed start to compete with the majority of the population still located at @xmath57 . to quantify this competition , we follow the location of the _ current leader _ @xmath82 , which is defined as the sequence at which @xmath73 is maximal .",
    "the path of @xmath82 describes an _ evolutionary trajectory _ in sequence space @xcite .",
    "along such a trajectory the fitness @xmath83 increases in a stepwise fashion , similar to the _ fitness trajectories _ observed in experimental studies of microbial populations @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of evolutionary trajectories is simple in a",
    "_ strong selection limit _ modeled after the zero temperature limit of the statistical physics of disordered systems @xcite .",
    "writing @xmath84 and taking the inverse selective temperature @xmath85 , one obtains a recursion relation for the logarithmic population variable @xmath86 defined by @xmath87 .",
    "as was shown in @xcite , the behavior remains essentially unchanged if the mutational part of the dynamics is turned off after the first time step .",
    "this implies that for @xmath88 the population at each site @xmath31 grows independently , at its own logarithmic rate @xmath45 , according to @xmath89 here the initial condition ( [ initial ] ) has been inserted .",
    "equation ( [ linear ] ) is a particularly transparent representation of the evolutionary race .",
    "each genotype advances at its own speed @xmath45 , from an initial position determined by its distance from the seed sequence @xmath57 . in the course of time , the leadership in the population changes from sequences with relatively low fitness located close to @xmath57 to more distant sequences of larger fitness , until eventually the globally fittest sequence is reached and the race comes to an end . at any given time the current leader @xmath82 satisfies @xmath90 ; that is , @xmath91 is the upper envelope of the family of straight lines defined by ( [ linear ] ) , and _ leadership changes _ correspond to the corners of the envelope .",
    "the leadership changes are precisely the jumps in the punctuated evolutionary trajectory , and their statistics will be discussed in the next section .",
    "several properties of evolutionary trajectories follow immediately from the representation ( [ linear ] ) . first , since all sequences within a _ shell _ of constant distance @xmath92 start with the same population at @xmath93 , only the sequence with the largest fitness within each shell has a chance of ever attaining the leadership .",
    "second , in order to become the new leader , the fitness of a sequence has to exceed that of the current leader , i.e. the sequence has to be a _",
    "record _ in the sense of sect.[recordsseq ] .",
    "thus , among the @xmath94 available genotypes only a small fraction given by the mean number of records ( [ meanr ] ) is eligible to become part of the evolutionary trajectory .",
    "however , not every record will become a leader . to see this ,",
    "suppose the current leader is at @xmath31 , and let @xmath32 be a subsequent record with @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "then @xmath86 and @xmath97 will cross at time @xmath98}{f(\\sigma')- f(\\sigma)}.\\ ] ] the leadership will be taken over by the sequence @xmath32 that minimizes the crossing time ( [ tsigma ] ) , which does not need to be the next record in line .",
    "we say that a sequence @xmath99 is _ bypassed _ by a sequence @xmath100 with @xmath101 , if @xmath102 . because of bypassing , the number of records ( [ meanr ] ) is only an upper bound on the number of leadership changes .",
    "in contrast to the properties of the records discussed in sects.[records ] and [ recordsseq ] , which are independent of the underlying fitness distribution , the prevalence of bypassing depends on @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "we can get some insight into the behavior by estimating the typical time @xmath103 at which the penultimate leader @xmath104 is overtaken by the sequence @xmath67 with globally maximal fitness @xcite .",
    "as both @xmath67 and @xmath104 are expected to reside within a belt of thickness @xmath1 around @xmath105 , we have @xmath106 .",
    "the fitness difference @xmath107 should be of the order of the fitness gap of the landscape . for example , for a fitness distribution with a power law tail @xmath108 , we have according to ( [ fmax ] ) that @xmath109 , and the fitness gap is of the same order .",
    "this implies that the crossing time @xmath110 decreases has a universal @xmath111 tail with a prefactor that vanishes for @xmath112 for power law fitness distributions @xcite . ] with increasing @xmath0 ; for large @xmath0 _ all _ intermediate records are bypassed , and the globally fittest sequence immediately takes over the leadership .",
    "nontrivial behavior is found when the fitness gap decreases with @xmath0 , or increases more slowly than @xmath1 . in fig.[shellfig ] we show numerical data for gaussian and exponential fitness distributions , for which the gap is of order unity independent of @xmath0 .",
    "very large sequence lengths can be treated by using the _ shell fitness _ @xmath113 , which is the largest of @xmath34 i.i.d .",
    "@xcite ; in this way the number of rv s that are needed for each realization reduces from @xmath94 to @xmath0 .",
    "the generation of the @xmath113 is feasible despite the astronomically large values of @xmath34 because the maximum of @xmath34 exponential or gaussian rv s is only of order @xmath114 or @xmath115 , respectively [ compare to ( [ fmax ] ) ] .",
    "the key result illustrated in fig.[shellfig ] is the scaling form @xmath116 for the probability @xmath117 for an evolutionary jump to occur at distance @xmath10 from the seed .",
    "the total number of jumps is of order @xmath1 , and hence most of the @xmath118 records are bypassed .",
    "the scaling function @xmath119 is cut off at @xmath120 , but its shape appears to be independent of the alphabet size @xmath27 ( inset of fig.[shellfig ] ) . for both gaussian and exponential fitness distributions ,",
    "the behavior of the scaling function at small arguments is close to @xmath121 .",
    "this behavior would imply that @xmath122 independent of @xmath0 for @xmath68 , and that the number of jumps grows as @xmath123 with increasing distance from the seed site .",
    "we expect these results to be generally valid for fitness distributions in the gumbel universality class of extreme value theory @xcite .",
    "the case of bounded fitness distributions should also be interesting , but has not been treated so far because of the difficulty in creating the shell fitnesses for large @xmath0 .",
    "an analytic understanding of ( [ pktilde ] ) is lacking at present , and must be left to future work .",
    "in fact , as is explained in detail in @xcite , the statistics of bypassing is difficult to handle analytically even for the simple case when the geometry of sequence space is ignored and the shell fitnesses are replaced by i.i.d .",
    "it is remarkable that the innocuous generalization of the basic record model , defined by the family ( [ linear ] ) of lines with random slopes , leads to a rather involved and rich probabilistic problem .",
