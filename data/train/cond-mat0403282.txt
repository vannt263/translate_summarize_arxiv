    "as mentioned in section ii a finite fermi level broadening , @xmath58 , has to be used for the conductance calculations . as an example , for the point contact depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : geom]a , we investigated the dependence of the conductance on @xmath58 .",
    "the summation in eq .",
    "( [ eq : cond ] ) was carried out up to convergence for the first two ( symmetric ) full layers ( @xmath71 ) . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : delta ] , the calculated conductances depend strongly but nearly linear on @xmath58 . a straight line fitted for @xmath72 mryd intersects the vertical axis at 2.38 @xmath0 .",
    "assuringly enough , a calculation with @xmath60ryd resulted in @xmath73 .",
    "although the nearly linear dependence of the conductance with respect to @xmath58 enables an easy extrapolation to @xmath74 , as what follows all the calculations refer to @xmath75ryd .    for the same type of contact we investigated the convergence of the summation in eq .",
    "( [ eq : cond ] ) over the layers @xmath24 and @xmath22 , whereby we chose different symmetric pairs of full layers . the convergence with respect to the number of atoms in the layers is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : conv ] .",
    "convergence for about 20 atoms can be obtained for the first two full layers ( @xmath71 ) , whereas the number of sites needed to get convergent sums gradually increases if one takes layers farther away from the center of the contact .",
    "this kind of convergence property is qualitatively understandable since the current flows from the contact within a cone of some opening angle that cuts out sheets of increasing area from the corresponding layers .",
    "as all the calculations were performed with @xmath60ryd , current conservation has to be expected .",
    "consequently the calculated conductance ought to be independent with respect to the layers chosen for the summation in eq .",
    "( [ eq : cond ] ) . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : conv ] this is satisfied within a relative error of less then 10%",
    ". it should be noted , however , that for the pairs of layers , @xmath76 , @xmath77 convergence was not achieved within this accuracy : by taking more sites in the summations even a better coincidence of the calculated conductance values for different pairs of layers can be expected .",
    "[ fig : conv ] also implies that an application of the landauer - bttiker approach to calculate the conductance of nanocontacts is numerically more tedious than the present one , since , in principle , two layers situated infinitely far from each other have to be taken in order to represent the leads .",
    "although only one au atom is placed in the center of the point contact considered above , see fig .",
    "[ fig : geom]a , the calculated conductance is more than twice as large as the conductance unit .",
    "this is easy to understand since the planes @xmath64 and @xmath65 , each containing four au atoms , are relatively close to each other and , therefore , tunneling contributes quite a lot to the conductance through the contact . in order to obtain a conductance around 1 @xmath0 , detected in the experiments ,",
    "a linear chain has to be considered .",
    "the existence of such linear chains is obvious from the long plateau of the corresponding conductance trace with respect to the piezo voltage in the break - junction experiments .",
    "since , as mentioned in section ii , our method at present can only handle geometrical structures confined to three dimensional translational invariant simple bulk parent lattices , as the simplest model of such a contact we considered a slanted linear chain as shown in fig . [",
    "fig : geom]b . in here , the middle layer ( @xmath63 ) and the adjacent layers ( @xmath78 ) contain only one au atom , layers @xmath79 and @xmath80 4 and 9 au atoms , respectively , while layers @xmath81 refer to the first two full layers .",
    "the sum in eq .",
    "( [ eq : cond ] ) was carried out for two pairs of layers , namely for @xmath82 , @xmath83 ( full layers ) and for @xmath84 , @xmath85 ( not full layers ) .",
    "the convergence with respect to the number of atoms in the chosen layers can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : lincond ] .",
    "the respective converged values are 1.10 @xmath0 and 1.17 @xmath0 . in the case of @xmath86 , @xmath85",
    "we observed that the contribution coming from the vacuum sites is nearly zero : considering only 4 au atoms in the summation already gave a value for the conductance close to the converged one .",
    "the small difference between the two calculated values , 0.07 @xmath0 , can most likely be attributed to an error caused by the asa .",
    "nevertheless , as expected , the calculated conductance is very near to the ideal value of 1 @xmath0 .",
    "another interesting structure is the 2x2 chain described in ref . .",
    "here we considered a finite length of this structure sandwiched between two semi - infinite systems , see fig .",
    "[ fig : geom]c .",
    "the conductance was calculated by performing the summation for 100 atoms from each of the first two full layers . as a result we obtained a conductance of 2.58 @xmath0 .",
    "@xcite got a conductance of 3 @xmath0 for an infinite cu wire to be associated with three conducting channels within the landauer approach . for an infinite wire",
    "the transmission probability is unity for all states , therefore , the conductance is just the number of bands crossing the fermi level . for the present case of a finite chain ,",
    "the transmission probability is less than unity for all the conducting states .",
    "this qualitatively explains the reduced conductance with respect to an infinite wire .    finally , we studied the dependence of the conductance on the thickness of the nanocontacts .",
    "all the investigated structures have @xmath87 symmetry and the central layer of the systems is a plane of reflection symmetry . the set - up of the structures is summarized in table [ tab : geom ] .",
    "contact 0 refers to a broken contact , while the others have different thicknesses from 1 up to 9 au atoms in the central layer . in fig .",
    "[ fig : thick ] the calculated conductances are displayed as performed by taking nearly 100 atoms from each of the first two full layers : @xmath88 for the broken contact and @xmath71 for all the other cases , see table [ tab : geom ] .",
    "it can be seen that the conductance is nearly proportional to the number of au atoms in the central layer .",
    "this finding can qualitatively be compared with the result of model calculations for the conductance of a three - dimensional electron gas through a connective neck as a function of its area in the limit of @xmath89 for the opening angle @xcite . in the case of the broken contact ,",
    "the non - zero conductance can again be attributed to tunneling of electrons .      in recent break junction experiments @xcite remarkable changes of the conductance histograms of nanocontacts formed by aupd alloys",
    "have been observed when varying the pd concentration .",
    "studying the effect of impurities placed into the nanocontact are , in that context , at least relevant for dilute alloys .",
    "the interesting question is whether the presence of impurities can be observed in the measured conductance .",
    "for that reason we investigated transition metal impurities such as pd , fe , and co placed at various positions of the point contact as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : geom]a . for the notation of the impurity positions see fig .",
    "[ fig : imp ] .",
    "the calculated spin and orbital moments of the magnetic impurities are listed in table [ tab : impmom ] . as usual for magnetic impurities with reduced coordination",
    "number@xcite , both for fe and co we obtained remarkably high spin moments , and in all positions of a co impurity large orbital moments . in particular",
    ", the magnitude of the orbital moments is very sensitive to the position of the impurity .",
    "this is most obvious in case of fe , where at positions b and c the orbital moment is relatively small , but at position a a surprisingly high value of 0.47 @xmath90 was obtained .",
    "the summation over 116 atoms from each of the first two full layers ( @xmath71 ) in eq .",
    "( [ eq : cond ] ) has been carried out in order to evaluate the conductance .",
    "the calculated values are summarized in table [ tab : impcond ] .",
    "a pd impurity ( independent of position ) reduces only little the conductance as compared to a pure au point contact .",
    "this qualitatively can be understood from the local density of states ( ldos ) of the pd impurity ( calculated by using an imaginary part of the energy of @xmath58 = 1 mryd ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : pd ] we plotted the corresponding ldos at positions a and c. clearly , the change of the coordination number ( 8 at position a and 12 at position c ) , i.e. , different hybridization between the pd and au @xmath1 bands , results into different widths for the pd @xmath1-like ldos . in both cases , however , the pd @xmath1 states are completely filled and no remarkable change in the ldos at fermi level ( conducting states ) happens .",
    "the case of the magnetic impurities seems to be more interesting . as can be inferred from table [ tab : impcond ] , impurities at position b change only a little the conductance .",
    "being placed at position a , however , fe and co atoms increase the conductance by 11 % and 24 % , while at position c they decrease the conductance by 19 % and 27 % , respectively . in ref .",
    "it was found that single fe , co ( and also ni ) defects in a 2x2 infinite cu wire decreased the conductance . by analyzing the dos",
    "it was concluded that the observed reduction of the conductance is due to a depletion of the @xmath2 states in the minority band .",
    "the above situation is very similar to the case of an fe or co impurity in position c of the point contact considered , even the calculated drop of the conductance ( @xmath91 -20 % for fe and @xmath91 -28 % for co ) agrees quantitatively well with our present result .",
    "our result , namely , that fe and co impurities at position a increase the conductance can , however , not be related to the results of ref . .",
    "in order to understand this feature we have to carefully investigate the ldos calculated for the point contact .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : dos ] we plotted the minority @xmath1-like ldos of the fe and co impurities in positions a and c as resolved according to the canonical orbitals @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath93 and @xmath95 .",
    "we have to stress that this kind of partial decomposition , usually referred to as the @xmath96 representation of the ldos , is not unique within a relativistic formalism , since due to the spin - orbit interaction the different spin- and orbital components are mixed .",
    "however , due to the large spin - splitting of fe and co the mixing of the majority and minority spin - states can be neglected . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : dos ] , the ldos of an impurity in position a is much narrower than in position c. this is an obvious consequence of the difference in the coordination numbers ( 8 for position a and 12 for positions c ) .",
    "thus an impurity in position a hybridizes less with the neighboring au atoms and , as implied by the ldos , the corresponding @xmath1 states are fairly localized",
    ". also to be seen is a spin - orbit induced splitting of about 8 mryd ( @xmath91 0.1 ev ) in the very narrow @xmath92-@xmath93 states of the impurities in position a. the difference of the band filling for the two kind of impurities shows up in a clear downward shift of the ldos of co with respect to that of fe .    in explaining the change of the conductance through the point contact caused by the impurities in positions a and c , the @xmath2-like dos at the center site , i.e. , at the narrowest section of the contact , is plotted in the top half of fig .",
    "[ fig : sdos ] . as a comparison",
    "the corresponding very flat @xmath2-like dos is shown for a pure au contact . for contacts with impurities",
    "this @xmath2-like dos shows a very interesting shape which can indeed be correlated with the corresponding @xmath95-like dos at the impurity site , see bottom half of fig .",
    "[ fig : sdos ] .",
    "clearly , the center positions and the widths of the @xmath95-like dos peaks and those of the respective ( anti-)resonant @xmath2-like dos shapes coincide well with each other .",
    "this kind of behavior in the dos resembles to the case studied by fano for a continuum band and a discrete energy level in the presence of configuration interaction ( hybridization ) @xcite .",
    "apparently , by keeping this analogy , in the point contact the @xmath2-like states play the role of a continuum and the @xmath95-like state of the impurity acts as the discrete energy level .",
    "since the two kinds of states share the same cylindrical symmetry , interactions between them can occur due to backscattering effects .",
    "it should be noted that similar resonant line - shapes in the stm i - v characteristics have been observed for kondo impurities at surfaces @xcite and explained theoretically @xcite .    inspecting fig .",
    "[ fig : sdos ] , the enhanced @xmath2-like dos at the fermi level at the center of the point contact provides a nice interpretation to the enhancement of the conductance when the fe and co impurity is placed at position a. as the peak position of the @xmath95-like states of fe is shifted upwards by more than 0.01 ryd with respect to that of co , the corresponding resonance of the @xmath2-like states is also shifted and the @xmath2-like dos at the fermi level is decreased .",
    "this is also in agreement with the calculated conductances . in the case of impurities at position",
    "c , i.e. , in a position by @xmath97 = 7.63 a.u .",
    "away from the center of the contact , the resonant line - shape of the @xmath2-like states is reversed in sign , therefore , we observe a decreased @xmath2-like dos at the fermi level , explaining in this case the decreased conductance , see table [ tab : impcond ] . since , however , the @xmath2-like dos for the case of a co impurity is larger than for an fe impurity , this simple picture can not account correctly for the opposite relationship we obtained for the corresponding conductances .",
    "by using a green s function technique based on the embedding scheme of the multiple scattering theory and the kubo - greenwood linear response theory as formulated by baranger and stone @xcite we studied the conductance of gold nanocontacts depending on the contact geometry and transition metal impurities placed at various positions .",
    "we performed several numerical tests that proved the efficiency of our method . in good agreement with experiments and other calculations we obtained a conductance of 1.1 @xmath0 for a finite linear chain connecting two semi - infinite au leads .",
    "the calculated conductance for a thicker 2x2 wire , 2.58 @xmath0 , can be related to a recent result for an infinite 2x2 chain ( 3 @xmath0 ) @xcite .",
    "also in agreement with quantum mechanical model calculations @xcite we found a nearly linear dependence of the conductance on the thickness  of the contact . by embedding magnetic transition metal impurities into a point contact we found both enhancement and reduction of the conductance depending on the position of the impurities . on analyzing the local density of states we concluded that the effect of the impurity is mainly controlled by the interaction of the minority @xmath1-like and @xmath2-like states giving rise to a resonant line - shape ( fano - resonance ) in the @xmath2-like dos at the center of contact .",
    "we suggest that this line - shape should also be observed in @xmath98 conductance characteristics providing thus an experimental  tool to detect magnetic impurities ( even their position ) in a noble metal point contact .",
