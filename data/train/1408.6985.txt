    "an intense electromagnetic field makes possible the processes which are forbidden in a vacuum such as the neutrino production of an electron ",
    "positron pair @xmath0 . the list of papers devoted to an analysis of this process and the collection of the results obtained could be found e.g. in ref .  @xcite . in most cases , calculations of this kind",
    "were made either in the crossed field approximation , or in the limit of a superstrong field much greater than the critical value of @xmath1  g , when the electrons and positrons were born in states corresponding to the ground landau level . however , there are physical situations of the so - called moderately strong magnetic field , @xmath2 is the electron mass , and @xmath3 is the elementary charge . ] , @xmath4 , when electrons and positrons mainly occupy the ground landau level , however , a noticeable fraction may be produced at the next levels .",
    "the indicated hierarchy of physical parameters corresponds to the conditions of the kerr black hole accretion disk , regarded by experts as the most likely source of a short cosmological gamma - ray burst .",
    "the disc is a source of copious neutrinos and anti - neutrinos , which partially annihilate above the disc and turn into @xmath5 pairs , @xmath6 .",
    "this process was proposed and investigated in many details , see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite and the papers cited therein , as a possible mechanism for creating relativistic , @xmath5-dominated jets that could power observed gamma - ray bursts . in ref .",
    "@xcite , in addition to @xmath7 annihilation , the contribution of the magnetic field - induced process @xmath0 to the neutrino energy deposition rate around the black hole was also included .",
    "however , in calculations of the efficiency of the electron - positron plasma production by neutrino through the process @xmath0 in those physical conditions  @xcite ( @xmath8 to 180 @xmath9 , @xmath10 to 25 mev ) , it should be kept in mind that approximations of both the crossed and superstrong field have a limited applicability here . we know",
    "a limited number of papers  @xcite , where the probability of neutrino - electron processes was investigated , as the sum over the landau levels of electrons ( positrons ) . in the papers",
    "@xcite , only the neutrino - electron scattering channel in a dense magnetized plasma was studied , which was the crossed process to the considered here neutrino creation of electron - positron pairs . in the paper  @xcite , also devoted to the study of the process @xmath0 , the analytical calculations were presented in a rather cumbersome form , caused by the choice of solutions of the dirac equation .",
    "the final results for the process probability were obtained by numerical calculations for some set of landau levels occupied by electrons and positrons . in astrophysical applications , there exists probably more interesting value than the process probability , namely , the mean value of the neutrino energy loss , caused by the influence of an external magnetic field .",
    "thus , the aim of this paper is the study of the process @xmath0 in the physical conditions of the moderately strong magnetic field , where the electrons and positrons would be born in the states corresponding to the excited landau levels , and the theoretical description would contain a relatively simple analytical formulas for the mean value of the neutrino energy loss , for a wide range of landau levels .",
    "more details of the analysis can be found in our recent paper  @xcite .",
    "we use the standard calculation technics , see e.g. ref .  @xcite .",
    "the effective local lagrangian of the process can be written in the form @xmath11 \\ , \\big [ \\bar \\nu \\gamma^{\\alpha } ( 1 - \\gamma_5 ) \\nu \\big ] \\ , , \\label{eq : l}\\ ] ] where the electron field operators are constructed on a base of the solutions of the dirac equation in the presence of an external magnetic field .",
    "the constants @xmath12 and @xmath13 for different neutrino types are : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the weinberg angle .",
    "the total probability of the process @xmath16 where the electron and the positron are created in the states corresponding to @xmath17th and @xmath18th landau levels correspondingly , is , in a general case , the sum of the probabilities of the four polarization channels : @xmath19 for each of the channels , the differential probability over the final neutrino momentum per unit time can be written as @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the total interaction time , @xmath22 is the total volume of the interaction region , @xmath23 is the @xmath24-matrix element constructed with the effective lagrangian  ( [ eq : l ] ) , and the elements of the phase volume are introduced for the electron and the positron ( the magnetic field is directed along the @xmath25 axis ) : @xmath26    in the integration over the momenta of the electron and the positron , a condition arises : @xmath27 which determines the range of integration over the final neutrino momentum . here",

    "hereafter called @xmath32 , where the momentum of the initial neutrino directed at an angle @xmath33 to the magnetic field , the threshold energy is given by : @xmath34 in fig .  [",

    "it is convenient to perform further integration over the final neutrino momentum , without loss of generality , not in an arbitrary reference frame @xmath32 , but in the special frame @xmath41 , where the initial neutrino momentum is perpendicular to the magnetic field , @xmath42 .",
    "one can then return from @xmath41 to @xmath32 by the lorentz transformation along the field ( recall that the field is invariant with respect to this transformation ) .",
    "it is convenient to use the dimensionless cylindrical coordinates in the space of the final neutrino momentum vector @xmath43 : @xmath44 & & r = e'/e_{\\mprp } = \\sqrt{\\rho^2 + z^2 } \\ , .",

    "we do not present here the set of expressions for the probability of the process @xmath16 , which can be found in the paper  @xcite .",
    "these probabilities evaluated numerically as the functions of the initial neutrino energy and of the magnetic field strength for all channels considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the electron and positron are created in the lower landau levels , are in a good agreement with the results of that paper .",
    "the probability of the @xmath0 process defines its partial contribution into the neutrino opacity of the medium .",
    "the estimation of the neutrino mean free path with respect to this process gives the result which is too large  @xcite compared with the typical size of a compact astrophysical object , e.g. the supernova remnant , where a strong magnetic field could exist .",
    "however , a mean free path does not exhaust the neutrino physics in a medium . in astrophysical applications , we could consider the values that probably are more essential , namely , the mean values of the neutrino energy and momentum losses , caused by the influence of an external magnetic field . these values can be described by the four - vector of losses @xmath47 , @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the total differential probability of the process @xmath0 .",
    "the zeroth component of @xmath47 is connected with the mean energy lost by a neutrino per unit time due to the process considered , @xmath50 .",
    "the space components of the four - vector  ( [ eq : q0 ] ) are similarly connected with the mean neutrino momentum loss per unit time , @xmath51 .",
    "it should be noted that the four - vector of losses @xmath47 can be used for evaluating the integral effect of neutrinos on plasma in the conditions of not very dense plasma , e.g. of a supernova envelope , when an one - interaction approximation of a neutrino with plasma is valid  @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the formula ( 10 ) for the energy deposition rate was taken , which was calculated in the crossed field limit  @xcite . by the way , the value @xmath52 defined by eq .",
    "( 10 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite is not the 4-vector while the value @xmath53 is .",
    "however , in the region of the physical parameters used in ref .",
    "@xcite ( @xmath8 to 180 @xmath9 , @xmath10 to 25 mev ) , the approximation of a crossed field is poorly applicable , as well as the approximation of a superstrong field when @xmath29 are created in the ground landau level .",
    "the contribution of the next landau levels which can be also excited , should be taken into account .",
    "we present here the results of our calculation of the mean neutrino energy losses caused by the process @xmath0 in a moderately strong magnetic field , i.e. in the conditions of the kerr black hole accretion disk .",
    "we parametrize the energy deposition rate as : @xmath54 where @xmath55 , and the dependence on the initial neutrino energy and the field strength is described by the function @xmath56 .",
    "this function calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite in the crossed field limit had the form @xmath57    on the other hand , in the strong field limit when both electron and positron are born in the ground landau level , the function @xmath58 was also calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite and can be presented in the form @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the modified bessel function .    in conditions of moderately strong magnetic field , when the electron and the positron are created in the process @xmath16 in the @xmath17th and @xmath18th landau levels , the result has more complicated form .",
    "it is significantly simplified when one of the particles , electron or positron , is born in the ground landau level , and if an approximation @xmath61 is used .",
    "we obtain the contribution of the channels @xmath62 and @xmath63 to the function @xmath58 as follows : @xmath64 & & \\times   \\left[(1 - \\rho^2)^2 + 4 r^2 - 2 r ( 1+\\rho^2 ) \\right ]   \\int\\limits_0^{2 \\pi } \\frac{{\\mathrm{d}}\\phi}{2 \\pi } ( r-\\rho \\cos \\phi )   \\nonumber\\\\[2 mm ] & & \\times \\ ,   ( 1 - 2 \\rho \\cos \\phi + \\rho^2)^{n-1 }   \\exp \\ ! \\left ( - \\frac{y^2 ( 1 - 2 \\rho \\cos \\phi + \\rho^2)}{2 \\eta } \\right ) , \\label{eq : f_(0n)}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath65 in figs .",
    "[ fig : function180][fig : function50 ] , the function @xmath58 obtained in different approximations is shown at @xmath66 .",
    "it can be seen that the crossed field limit gives the overstated result which is in orders of magnitude greater than the sum of the contributions of lower excited landau levels . on the other hand ,",
    "the results with @xmath29 created at the ground landau level give the main contribution to the energy deposition rate , and almost exhaust it at @xmath67 .",
    "this would mean that the conclusion  @xcite that the contribution of the process @xmath0 to the efficiency of the electron - positron plasma production by neutrino exceeds the contribution of the annihilation channel @xmath6 , and that the first process dominates the energy deposition rate , does not have a sufficient basis .",
    "a new analysis of the efficiency of energy deposition by neutrinos through both processes , @xmath6 and @xmath0 , in a hyper - accretion disc around a black hole should be performed , with taking account of our results for the process @xmath0 presented here .",
    "in the paper , a calculation is performed of the mean value of the neutrino energy loss due to the process of electron - positron pair production , @xmath0 , in the magnetic field of an arbitrary strength at which the electrons and positrons can be produced in the states corresponding to the excited landau levels , which could be essential in astrophysical applications .",
    "the results obtained should be used for calculations of the efficiency of the electron - positron plasma production by neutrinos in the conditions of the kerr black hole accretion disk , regarded by experts as the most likely source of a short cosmological gamma - ray burst . in those conditions ,",
    "the crossed field limit used in the previous calculations led to the overstated result which was in orders of magnitude greater than the sum of the lower landau levels .",
    "the study may be also useful for further development of computational techniques for the analysis of quantum processes in an external active environment , particularly in conditions of moderately strong magnetic field , when the allowance for the contribution of only the ground landau level is insufficient .",
    "we dedicate this paper to the blessed memory of our teacher , colleague , and friend nickolay vladimirovich mikheev , who passed away on june 19 , 2014 .       for @xmath68 obtained in the crossed field limit (",
