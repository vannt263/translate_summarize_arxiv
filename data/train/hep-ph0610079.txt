    "the discovery potential of the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) should be sufficient to resolve the issue of the existence of a neutral higgs boson @xcite .",
    "an electron ",
    "positron collider would , however , serve as an ideal tool to measure the properties of neutral higgs bosons very precisely @xcite . to discover a charged higgs boson , @xmath3 , on the other hand , is much harder at the lhc @xcite , especially if the @xmath3 is substantially heavier than the top quark .",
    "the reason for this is the dominant decay of the @xmath3 bosons into heavy quarks ( @xmath4 or @xmath5 ) which leads to hadronic signatures that are hard to distinguish from qcd background events and which forces one either to rely on the less probable decay @xmath6 or to accumulate a lot of statistics during several years of running at high luminosity in order to claim discovery .",
    "actually , the strong dependence of the production cross sections on the ratio of vacuum expectation values in the higgs sector , @xmath7 , makes it almost impossible to discover the charged higgs boson at the lhc in a wedge - shaped region of intermediate @xmath8-values in the @xmath9@xmath10 plane if it is heavier than the top - quark @xcite .",
    "this non - discovery range includes @xmath11 at @xmath12 and widens continuously to e.g.  @xmath13 at @xmath14 @xcite .    at an @xmath15 collider with a centre - of - mass energy @xmath16",
    ", the main production process for charged higgs bosons is pair production ( @xmath17 ) which is mediated mainly via photon- and @xmath18-exchange in the s - channel .",
    "the pair - production cross section is almost independent of @xmath8 and , owing to the colourless initial state , higgs - boson signatures from decays into heavy quarks are not obscured by enormous amounts of qcd background events , like at the lhc .",
    "therefore , detection of charged higgs bosons via pair production should be possible in the whole @xmath10@xmath9 plane up to a mass limit somewhat below @xmath19 .",
    "if the collider energy is not sufficient for pair production ( i.e.  @xmath20 ) , the only way to extend the search for the charged higgs boson to higher masses is to try to observe its single production in association with lighter particles .",
    "the most relevant processes which have been studied in the literature are the tree - level processes @xmath21 @xcite and @xmath22 @xcite , and the loop - induced processes @xmath23 @xcite and @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "most of the studies are done in the framework of a two higgs doublet model ( thdm ) with parameters fixed at mssm values , except for refs .",
    "@xcite which study @xmath25 production in the general thdm , refs .",
    "@xcite which study the same process in the full mssm , and ref .",
    "@xcite which includes virtual sfermion contributions for the cross section prediction of the @xmath26 final state .",
    "if the collider energy does not allow for pair production and @xmath27 , the @xmath28 production process can become the dominant source of charged higgs bosons , depending on @xmath9 . in this case , as the process is loop - induced , the signal rate is much smaller than the typical pair - production rate .",
    "even if @xmath29 production is the main production process at an @xmath15 collider , it would still be very rewarding to measure the @xmath28 production cross section as well .",
    "while the @xmath29 cross section is determined at tree - level by the gauge couplings to photon and @xmath18-boson , the @xmath28 cross section is loop - induced and thus depends already at leading order on the virtual particles in the loops .",
    "therefore , with a cross section measurement of the latter process one would have access to information about the underlying model .",
    "this paper presents a calculation of the mssm prediction for the process @xmath30 . by the time this work was finalized , another calculation of the same prediction appeared @xcite .",
    "we carried out a detailed comparison @xcite of our results with those of ref .",

    "@xcite in particular .",
    "in section [ sect : theprocess ] we present the process @xmath30 with the contributing feynman diagrams in the mssm and some details about our calculation .",
    "section [ sect : results ] presents our numerical results in two stages . in stage one",
    ", we examine the basic features of the @xmath25 cross section for a @xmath33 and @xmath34 @xmath35 collider for two distinct mssm parameter scenarios and compare the results also to predictions of a thdm with the same higgs sector parameters .",
    "this enables us to exemplify the range of influence of virtual superpartners on the cross section .",
    "the effect of polarized electron and positron beams on the cross section is discussed briefly followed by a demonstration of the decoupling of superpartners with increasing supersymmetry - breaking scale . in stage two",
    ", we present results of a thorough scan of the mssm parameter space for regions of large , possibly observable , cross section and try to understand for which parameter scenarios they arise .",
    "section [ sect : conclusion ] contains our conclusions .",
    "some results of this calculation were already reported in @xcite .",
    "we study the reaction @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 denote the momenta of the initial - state electron and positron , @xmath39 and @xmath40 the momenta of the final - state gauge boson @xmath41 and higgs boson @xmath42 .",
    "additionally , the electron , positron , and @xmath2-boson are characterized by their spin polarization @xmath43 and @xmath44 . neglecting the electron mass , the kinematical invariants @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 fulfil the relation @xmath48 we assume unpolarized electron and positron beams . thus ,",
    "the differential cross section summed over spin polarizations of the final - state @xmath2-boson reads @xmath49 with the helicity amplitudes @xmath50 of the process .",
    "the total cross section is evaluated by numerical integration over the kinematically allowed @xmath51-range : @xmath52      in the mssm and thdm all leptons couple gauge - invariantly to one of the two higgs doublets and therefore also to the physical higgs bosons .",
    "thus , there is a non - vanishing tree - level amplitude for the process under study .",
    "the feynman graphs on tree - level consist of three graphs with @xmath53-channel exchange of neutral higgs bosons ( @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 ) and one with a @xmath51-channel exchange of a neutrino .",
    "the yukawa couplings which appear in all tree - level graphs are @xmath57 and suppress the tree - level contribution strongly .",
    "the tree - level amplitude can thus safely be neglected and consequently there are no photon bremsstrahlung corrections at leading order .    in our calculation",

    "the latter model corresponds to the mssm with decoupled superpartners .",
    "thus , one achieves insight in the contribution of superpartner loop graphs to the cross section .      in order to demonstrate possible differences between the sthdm and the full mssm , we are interested in scenarios which potentially show large effects from virtual superpartners . hence , the mssm parameter scenarios for which we present numerical results have a rather low squark - mass scale . in the mssm , large mixing in the stop sector",

    "* this scenario allows for the production of stop pairs at the energy scales considered in the following sections and the decay of the charged higgs into stop and sbottom will be kinematically allowed for @xmath118 .    _",
    "no - stop - mixing scenario _ : here , we choose the same values of the mssm parameters as above , except for @xmath113 which is set to zero .",
    "the main features of this scenario are :    * both stops have masses around @xmath119 and all other sfermions have masses around @xmath120 . *",
    "the stop mixing angle is zero .",

    "both scenarios respect all superpartner mass bounds from direct search results and fulfil indirect constraints on the parameters coming from requiring vacuum stability and from experimental bounds on the electroweak precision observables .",
    "also the lower bound on the lightest neutral mssm higgs boson is respected by both scenarios , except for the case @xmath122 in the no - mixing scenario . yet , for the sake of comparison , we also show this case among our numerical results .",
    "there are two major motivations for studying the mssm prediction for @xmath0 cross sections at a future ilc .",
    "firstly , it is important to know the expected event rates at the ilc either to confirm the discovery of charged higgs bosons at the lhc or to assess the @xmath3 discovery potential of the ilc beyond the pair - production limit of @xmath123 .",
    "secondly , the observation of this process provides the opportunity to glean some information about the underlying model because of its potential sensitivity to virtual superpartners .",
    "we present results for two collider energies , @xmath124 and @xmath125 .",
    "for each energy we show results for the the large - stop - mixing and no - stop - mixing scenario for different @xmath9-values in and around the `` wedge region '' and for charged higgs bosons masses below , above and right at the pair production limit of 250 and 500 gev , respectively .      in figs .",

    "the spike in all predictions for @xmath129 is due to a threshold effect in the vertex graphs with virtual top- and bottom - quarks ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : eewh - tribox-2hdm ] ) .",
    "similar spikes appear in the full mssm prediction in places where @xmath10 equals @xmath130 and are due to threshold effects in the feynman graphs with virtual stops and sbottoms , e.g.  for @xmath116 where @xmath131 .",
    "[ fig : tb - eehw]a shows the @xmath9-dependence for @xmath132 , @xmath133 , and @xmath120 .",

    "sbottom thresholds are within the accessible mass range for the charged higgs boson .",
    "the enhancement with respect to the sthdm case is due to the threshold effects combined with enhanced couplings of the charged higgs boson to third - generation squarks . in the large - stop - mixing scenario , the feynman graphs with virtual squarks of the third generation comprise the dominant contribution to the cross section if @xmath9 is not too small . in this scenario",
    "each entry of the rotation matrix which transforms the stop fields into the mass eigenbasis is of similar magnitude .",
    "thus , all potentially large terms in the couplings of third - generation squarks to higgs bosons are weighted by a factor of order 1 , especially the term proportional to @xmath135 .",
    "[ fig : mhpm - eehw]c and [ fig : tb - eehw]c show the predicted cross section for a @xmath33 collider in this scenario .",
    "superpartner effects are small in this case and the mssm as well as the sthdm predict almost the same cross section . without mixing in the stop sector the two factors which caused the large enhancement in the large - mixing case are absent .",
    "firstly , there are no enhancement effects by thresholds in stop",
    " sbottom loops .",
    "secondly , the mixing angle in the stop sector is exactly zero which leads to the absence of terms proportional to @xmath135 in the @xmath136-couplings .",

    "this might predict @xmath25 production to be observable in such mssm scenarios unlike in the corresponding sthdm scenario .",
    "we investigate this possible behaviour more systematically by scanning over the relevant mssm parameter space .",
    "the detectors at the lhc will be capable of finding an mssm charged higgs boson only in certain regions in the @xmath162@xmath9 plane .",
    "likewise , the ilc can detect charged higgs bosons easily only if pair production is kinematically possible .",
    "thus , as far as @xmath25 production at the ilc is concerned , there are two points of departure : either we will know to some extent what the mass of the charged higgs boson is or we will not . in the first case it makes sense to combine this knowledge with the knowledge of the cross section prediction in the mssm and adjust the collider energy to the maximum of the expected cross section as a function of @xmath16 . in the second case it is difficult to say what the best strategy of choosing @xmath16 will be for searching for the charged higgs boson .",
    "a reasonable assumption is however that a significant fraction of the data during ilc operation will be collected at the highest collider energy .    with these two possibilities in mind ,",
    "we devised two parameter scans .",
    "the first scan assumes that the charged higgs mass is known and that it makes sense to adjust the collider energy to maximize the cross section .",
    "furthermore , it assumes that one has also acquired some knowledge about the value of @xmath9 .",

    ", we are interested in regions of parameter space where the cross section is large such that it might still be detectable at the ilc . in order to increase the number of scanned parameter points in the region of large cross section",
    ", we use the  adaptive scanning  algorithm described in more detail in ref . @xcite .",
    "essentially , that means that we are using the importance sampling algorithm vegas @xcite to evaluate the integral of the cross section over the relevant mssm parameters .",
    "however , we are not interested in the value of the meaningless integral but store the sampled points which automatically accumulate in the region of large cross section .",
    "this method allows to perform scans of higher - dimensional parameter spaces with emphasis on certain features of the results much more efficiently than a grid of points or purely random sampling can do .",
    "more precisely , the quantity we are integrating over in our scans is identical to the cross section only at ` allowed ' points according to the exclusion limits defined below , and zero otherwise .",
    "the enrichment of points thus focuses also on the allowed region .",

    "@xcite .",

    "we use feynhiggs 2.5.1 @xcite for calculating the @xmath165 prediction and allow for a theoretical uncertainty of @xmath168 .",
    "secondly , we calculate the leading - order mssm prediction for the branching ratio @xmath169 @xcite and exclude parameter points if the prediction falls outside of the range @xmath170 .",
    "this range is determined by using the experimental central value @xcite and adding up the experimental @xmath171 interval ( @xmath172 ) and an estimate of the independent theoretical uncertainty ( @xmath173 ) .",
    "the latter estimate ( 20% ) is guided by the discussion of theoretical uncertainties for the sm prediction @xcite .",

    "the well - known fact that for small @xmath9 the constraints , especially the lep higgs - mass bound , require a fair amount of stop mixing ( i.e. @xmath185 ) to be present , is clearly seen in all three figures .    also owing to the lep bound ,",
    "the lowest common squark mass scale @xmath179 for which we find allowed scenarios is about @xmath119 for positive @xmath186 and @xmath1 for negative @xmath186 .",
    "it is for rather low @xmath179 , below about @xmath158 , that the few scenarios with a cross section above @xmath183 appear .",

    "[ fig : scan1 - 2d - slices]d , [ fig : scan1 - 2d - slices]e and [ fig : scan1 - 2d - slices]f ) the results of the scan change drastically compared to the @xmath122 case .",
    "firstly , the allowed region in the @xmath179@xmath186 plane ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : scan1 - 2d - slices]d ) is much larger , now also including scenarios without stop mixing and scenarios with @xmath179 below @xmath188 .",

    "interestingly , the projection of the parameter points on the @xmath179@xmath186 plane ( fig .",
    "[ fig : scan1 - 2d - slices]d ) shows that the scenarios with a ( large ) cross section above @xmath190 are confined to a very specific region with @xmath179 between @xmath133 and @xmath1 , and @xmath186 between @xmath191 and @xmath145 simultaneously .",
    "the projection on the @xmath186@xmath192 plane ( fig .",
    "[ fig : scan1 - 2d - slices]e ) shows that all large cross section scenarios also have a significantly nonzero and negative value of @xmath192 .",
    "quantitatively , it turns out that those scenarios typically have the two mass scales @xmath193 and @xmath194 of the same order of magnitude .",
    "furthermore , from the projection on the @xmath186@xmath96 plane ( fig .",
    "[ fig : scan1 - 2d - slices]f ) we see that those scenarios also have a positive and large value of @xmath96 , typically between @xmath195 and @xmath196 ( the limit of our scan range ) .",
    "looking into the @xmath192-@xmath197 plane ( not depicted ) we find large cross section scenarios for almost any value of @xmath197 .    the scan results for @xmath198 ( figs .  [ fig : scan1 - 2d - slices]g , [ fig : scan1 - 2d - slices]h and [ fig : scan1 - 2d - slices]i ) look very similar to the previous case .",

    "a detection of squarks with masses in this range at the lhc would raise hopes that @xmath25 production would be observable at the ilc with an integrated luminosity of the order of 1000 events/@xmath217 .",
    "as in scan 1 it turns out that the mixing parameters in the third generation squark sector are important for the understanding of the large cross section regions .",

    "we find cross section values above @xmath199 only for scenarios which also have a considerable amount of sbottom mixing , typically @xmath220 .    at this point , it is instructive to compare our scan with a variant version where the lep higgs constraint on the mssm parameters is implemented in its most simple way , which is often done in the literature .",
    "this simple implementation only makes use of the overall , scenario independent , bound on @xmath221 ( e.g. @xmath222 @xcite ) , discarding all scenarios which predict @xmath221 to lie below it . obviously , this prescription is overly conservative , keeping e.g. all sm - like scenarios with masses above @xmath222 although in this case a bound close to the sm limit of about @xmath223 @xcite applies .",
    "[ fig : scan2 - 2d - slices]b shows the results for scan 2 using the simple implementation of the lep higgs constraint .",
