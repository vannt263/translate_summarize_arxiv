    "2o  megamasers are best known as a means to probe the accretion disks in seyfert galaxies . in the most famous source , ngc  4258 , a thin , slightly warped , nearly edge - on disk orbits in keplerian rotation around a central mass of 4@xmath310@xmath4 ( e.g. greenhill  1995 ; miyoshi  1995 , herrnstein 1999 ) .",
    "vlbi studies have been used to determine the size and shape of this warped molecular disk as traced by the maser spots .",
    "a few other sources show evidence of a toroidal structure , but the distribution of maser spots is not as well understood .",
    "for example , vlbi observations of megamasers seen in ngc  3079 indicate that the structure of the maser components is consistent with a parsec - scale disk , but also exhibits a significant non - rotational component ( trotter  1998 ) .",
    "ngc  3079 also exhibits  absorption toward the core ( sawada - satoh  2000 ; baan & irwin 1995 ) , which in some cases can be a tracer of a circumnuclear torus ( _ e .",
    "g. _ peck & taylor 2001 ) .",
    "the ngc  4945 maser ( greenhill , moran & herrnstein 1997 ) is tentatively interpreted to consist of a parsec - scale disk , but shows some deviations in both position and velocity of the maser components from the keplerian model .",
    "there is evidence , however , for a distinct class of h@xmath0o megamaser . in these sources",
    "the amplified emission is the result of an interaction between the radio jet and an encroaching molecular cloud , rather than occurring in a circumnuclear disk .",
    "the only known sources in this class were ngc  1068 ( gallimore  1996 ) and the circinus galaxy ( greenhill  2001 ) , which appear to have both a circumnuclear disk and maser emission arising along the edges of an ionization cone or outflow , and ngc  1052 , in which the masers appear to arise along the jet and have a full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) @xmath190  ( claussen  1998 ) .",
    "we have recently identified the fourth such source , 348 , a seyfert 2 galaxy with a low inclination angle and an exceptionally bright and highly variable nuclear radio source ( falcke  2000 ) .",
    "348 ( ngc  262 ) is a well - studied galaxy which exhibits interesting morphology at a wide range of wavelengths .",
    "this galaxy has been classified as s0/a ( devaucouleurs , devaucouleurs & corwin 1976 ) , although recent studies by antn  ( 2002 ) indicate that it is more likely between sa+ and sb+ .",
    "it exhibits a large  halo ( morris & wannier 1980 ) which may have been produced by an interaction with a companion galaxy ( ngc  266 , at an angular distance of 23@xmath5 ; simkin  1987 ) . a variety of measurements of recessional velocity , both optical and radio , exist in the literature ( _ e.g. _ cruz - gonzales  1994 , richter & huchtmeier 1991 , bottinelli  1990",
    ", mirabel & wilson 1984 , feldman  1982 , heckman , balick & sullivan 1978 , koski 1976 ) .",
    "it is possible that some of these measurements might be affected by the gas in the halo .",
    "because the redshift of optical emission lines can be affected by local dynamics and stellar outflows in the galaxy , we adopt the recent central  value of bottinelli  ( 1990 ; c@xmath6 4507 ) as the most likely estimate of the systemic velocity .",
    "this corresponds to a distance of 62.5 mpc , assuming h@xmath7=75  mpc@xmath2 .",
    "vlbi observations of 348  at 1.417  ghz by neff & de bruyn ( 1983 ) show a three component radio source with a total extent of 180 mas ( 50 pc ) .",
    "later observations using global vlbi at 4.8  ghz ( roy  1999 ) show two faint continuum hotspots on either side of a much brighter central peak .",
    "this central component is thought to be the core , and the separation between the outer hotspots and the core is around 50 mas to the north , and 120 mas to the south .",
    "the relative intensities of the two outer components are quite similar , indicating that relativistic beaming effects are probably minimal and the jet axis should be close to the plane of the sky .",
    "ground - based observations ( simpson  1996 ) show evidence of an ionization cone with a half - angle of 45 , which also suggests a jet axis fairly close to the plane of the sky .",
    "vlba images at higher frequencies ( ulvestad  1999 ) reveal a small - scale double continuum source , the axis of which is aligned with the optical [ oiii ] emission ( capetti  1996 ) , with a position angle of @xmath816 .",
    "although a broad polarized h@xmath9 line with fwhm 7400  ( miller & goodrich 1990 ) and a strongly absorbed hard x - ray source having @xmath1010@xmath11 @xmath12 ( warwick  1989 ) argue for the presence of an obscured nucleus , many attempts to detect the expected obscuring torus at radio wavelengths have not been successful .",
    "gallimore ( 1999 ) searched for  in absorption with the vla in 1992 , but did not detect any absorption toward the radio source with a 3@xmath13 upper limit of 4  mjy , or @xmath140.014 .",
    "taniguchi  ( 1990 ) did not detect any @xmath15co(j=1@xmath80 ) emission or absorption using the nobeyama radio observatory 45-m telescope in 1989 , although their upper limit of 10.4 k  for this source was fairly high .",
    "barvainis & lonsdale ( 1998 ) reported that there was no evidence for free - free absorption in the spectral energy distributions of the core component in 348 between 1.4 and 15  ghz .",
    "hubble space telescope ( falcke , wilson & simpson 1998 ) observations show evidence of a dust lane crossing the nucleus .    in this paper , we present the results of effelsberg 100-m telescope monitoring of the evolution of the 2o  line flux and 22  ghz total continuum flux density ( @xmath163.1 ) , vla monitoring of the integrated continuum flux density at various frequencies ( @xmath163.2 ) , observations of the milliarsecond scale jet morphology during the course of the continuum flare ( @xmath163.3 ) and high spatial and spectral resolution vlba imaging of the megamaser emission at one epoch in june 2000 ( @xmath163.4 ) .",
    "details of the methods used for all of these experiments are given in @xmath162 .",
    "in @xmath164 , we present discussions of the physical environment in the central few parsecs in this galaxy , and the conditions which give rise to megamaser emission .",
    "with the effelsberg 100-m telescope , data were taken at the end of 1997 and early 1998 in a position switching mode with a 22 ghz maser receiver and a backend consisting of 1024 channels and a bandwidth of 50  mhz .",
    "the recorded system temperature was @xmath17 @xmath1 75  k on a @xmath18 ( antenna temperature corrected for atmospheric attenuation ) temperature scale . between march 2000 and august 2001 we used a new dual channel 22 ghz hemt receiver in a dual beam switching mode with a beam throw of 2  and switching frequency of 1hz ( for details , see falcke  2000 ) .",
    "for the measurements with the hemt receiver , pointing could be checked on 348  itself .",
    "amplitude calibration was obtained using ngc  7027 ( 5.8 jy ; see baars  1977 , ott 1994 ) as a primary calibrator and adopting the 22  ghz gain curve given by gallimore  ( 2001 ) .",
    "since 348  itself could be used as a pointing source , pointing errors do not significantly affect calibration uncertainties so that we conservatively estimate that our flux densities are accurate to 10% or better .",
    "the nrao very large array ( vla ) observations were made at six frequencies ranging from 1.4  ghz to 43  ghz .",
    "we observed 348 on 8 dates between november 1998 and july 2001 in various configurations .",
    "the source 3c48 was used as the primary flux density calibrator , and 348 was self - calibrated and imaged with the astronomical image processing system ( aips ; van moorsel , kemball , & greisen 1996 ) .",
    "the vla images are not shown as the radio source was unresolved in all cases ; only the integrated flux densities are reported here .",
    "the nrao very long baseline array ( vlba ) was used to image 348 in the continuum at three epochs : 1997.10 , 1998.75 , and 2000.00 . observing frequencies ranged from 1.7 through 22.2  ghz , with three different frequency bands used at each epoch .",
    "the 15  ghz observations from the first two epochs have been described previously by ulvestad  ( 1999 , hereafter u99 ) , while the remainder of the observations are reported for the first time here . in all instances , the vlba observations utilized four 8-mhz if channels with two - bit sampling of the data , resulting in total data rates of 128  mbit  s@xmath2 . at the first two epochs ,",
    "single polarizations were observed at each frequency , while dual polarizations were used at the third epoch . between 1 and 3 hours",
    "was spent integrating on 348 in each of the frequency bands observed at each epoch .",
    "details of the observations are summarized in table  [ tab : vlba - cont ] .",
    "all data calibration was carried out in aips .",
    "the amplitudes of the vlba data were calibrated by means of the standard antenna gain files maintained by vlba staff as well as system temperatures measured every 12 minutes during the observations .",
    "this calibration is estimated to be accurate to 5% at all frequencies through 15  ghz , and 10% at 22  ghz due to the increased ( variable ) impact of atmospheric emission . at the first epoch",
    ", the antennas at north liberty , iowa and hancock , new hampshire were not used due to snow and ice in the dishes , while the pie town , new mexico antenna failed during the second epoch .",
    "low - elevation data ( typically below 10 ) were discarded at the higher frequencies ; other data editing was minor .",
    "residual clock errors were removed by means of observations of a strong calibrator source or the application of the pulse - calibration tones inserted at the vlba front ends .",
    "residual delay , rate , and phase errors were derived in most cases by constructing `` fringe '' solutions on 348 itself ; however , at the first epoch , 348 was relatively low in flux , so the local phase - reference calibrator j0112 + 3522 was used instead .",
    "following the initial calibration , data were self - calibrated and imaged in both aips and difmap ( shepherd 1997 ) , resulting in the final images discussed in this paper .",
    "images made in aips used an intermediate weighting with a briggs robustness parameter of 0 .",
    "gaussian fits were made to component flux densities , sizes , and relative positions . for the extended lobes seen at 1.7  ghz ,",
    "flux densities were determined by integrating over the portions of the images where significant emission was detected .",
    "the high spatial resolution observations of the maser line were made using all 10 antennas of the vlba on june 10 , 2000 .",
    "348  was observed for 9 hours over a 12 hour period . because the line was seen in the march effelsberg observations to be too broad to fit in a single 16 mhz if ( full width at zero power @xmath19250 ) , 2 ifs of 16 mhz each in both right and left circular polarizations were used , overlapped somewhat in frequency .",
    "256 channels were used in each if , resulting in a channel spacing of 125 khz .",
    "this corresponds to a velocity resolution of 1.74 .",
    "amplitude calibration was derived using the antenna gain curves and measurements of system temperature as described in @xmath162.3 .",
    "the calibrator source j0237 + 2848 ( 4c+28.07 ) was used as an initial fringe finder , following which delay and rate solutions were calculated using the bright , compact continuum source in 348  itself , using the aips task fring with a solution interval of 3 minutes .",
    "the nearby source j0136 + 4651 was observed every 40 minutes to ensure adequate bandpass calibration .",
    "this setup provided enough bandwidth to cover the line and supply 20 line - free channels on the low frequency end of the line which could be used to generate a clean `` map '' of 348  in difmap .",
    "this model of clean components was then used to remove any amplitude offsets between the two ifs and between right and left circular polarizations .",
    "unfortunately , no line - free channels were available on the high frequency side of the line .",
    "following calibration , the overlapping channels were removed and the 2 ifs were joined together , using the aips task uvglu , to yield a single cube of 174 channels covering 23 mhz .",
    "continuum subtraction was done in the _ u , v _ plane using the aips task uvlsf .",
    "subsequent editing and imaging of all data was done using difmap .",
    "the line spectra were then analyzed and fitted with gaussian functions using the groningen image processing system , gipsy ( van der hulst  1992 ) .",
    "the initial detection of the flaring maser in 348  using the effelsberg 100 m telescope took place in 2000 march ( shown in figure  [ fig:100 m ] , 2nd profile ; see also falcke  2000 ) .",
    "re - analysis of previous unpublished data on this source ( shown in the top profile , fig .",
    "[ fig:100 m ] ) indicates that the maser was also present but only marginally detectable in late 1997 .",
    "the 2o  maser line in 348  is extremely broad , with a fwhm of @xmath1130 , though in many of the monitoring epochs the emission appears to consist of 2 lines which can be tentatively fit with a broad gaussian function at 4609  with fwhm100  and a narrower one at 4678  with fwhm60 .",
    "the amplitudes of each component vary significantly on very short timescales .",
    "there are no detectable high velocity components within 1500  on either side of the strong emission line ( for the noise levels of the spectra , see fig .",
    "[ fig:100 m ] ; for upper limits over a wider velocity range , see falcke  2000 ) .",
    "monitoring of the 2o  emission through june 2000 showed that the maser again decreased to its 1997/1998 level within 2 months , although xanthopoulos & richards ( 2001 ) report a value of 107  mjy on may 2 using merlin .",
    "our may 2 profile indicates a peak flux of @xmath116  mjy , consistent with our vlba observations on june 10 ( see  3.4 ) .",
    "resumption of the monitoring program at effelsberg in december 2000 showed little change in the line flux , although the component centered on 4609  appears to be slightly stronger than the higher velocity feature . in february 2001 , however , another flare appears to have begun .",
    "the observations made in early april 2001 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:100 m ] ) show that the fwhm linewidth decreased to 603 km s@xmath2 , and the velocity centroid increased from 4642 km s@xmath2 to @xmath146651 km s@xmath2 .",
    "thus it seems that only the higher velocity line component was flaring . following this peak near april 2",
    ", the line again began to decrease in flux .",
    "further observations show that in june 2001 , the low velocity component underwent a smaller flare of unknown duration .",
    "this behavior is consistent with the scenario described in @xmath163.4 in which the higher velocity component arises closer to the central engine of the radio source .",
    "figure  [ fig:4profs ] shows 5 spectra which were chosen to emphasize the significant variations in the line profiles over our first 16 months of observations .",
    "the first profile is the discovery spectrum , where both components had a flux of around 30  mjy . in the second profile , taken within a week of our vlba observations , both components verged on undetectability and",
    "then , in the third profile , the higher velocity component flared to twice the intensity of the year previous , and the lower velocity component disappeared altogether .",
    "this change was reversed in june , shown in the fourth profile , when the lower velocity component was present , though the intensity was low , and the higher velocity component vanished . within two weeks",
    ", both components were once again nearly equal .",
    "figure  [ fig : linevtime ] shows the variation in line and continuum flux density with respect to time .",
    "comparison shows that the continuum flux varies loosely with the maser flux .",
    "the implications of this for the maser position with respect to the central engine are discussed in @xmath164.2 .",
    "figure  [ fig : vlaspec ] shows the continuum spectrum of 348 measured at 8 epochs over 2.5 years using the vla . during the first four epochs ( 1998 november to 1999 march ) ,",
    "the spectrum of 348 is inverted at centimeter wavelengths and reaches its peak at 22  ghz . during the following epochs , this turnover dropped to lower frequencies . at frequencies above the turnover",
    ", the spectrum gradually flattens with time .",
    "this behavior is similar to that in iii  zw  2 , where this type of evolution in turn - over frequency has been linked to the expansion of synchrotron bubbles in a jet and decreasing self - absorption .",
    "this interpretation is further discussed in @xmath164.1 .",
    "figure  [ fig:18 cm ] shows the large - scale vlbi image of 348 at 1.7  ghz , from 1997.10 .",
    "the core and outer lobes shown in figure  [ fig:18 cm ] were first imaged by neff & de bruyn ( 1983 ) ; the image shown here indicates that the northern and southern lobes are quite diffuse and heavily resolved .",
    "in fact , neither lobe is detected at 5.0  ghz , with @xmath20 upper limits of 0.32  mjy  beam@xmath2 .",
    "this is consistent with the scenario in which the emission in the lobes is smoothly distributed and has the spectrum of optically thin synchrotron emission .",
    "the absence of 5  ghz hotspots may indicate that there is no powerful jet currently feeding the lobes .",
    "the total flux density detected in the northern lobe is 27  mjy , while that in the southern lobe is 17  mjy .",
    "these values are far below the respective 1.4  ghz values of 118  mjy and 63  mjy reported by neff & de bruyn ( 1983 ) who used shorter baselines in europe , indicating that the vlba has resolved out much of the lobe structure .",
    "figure  [ fig : vlbacore ] contains the vlba images of the parsec - scale emission from 348 at 8 , 15 , and 22  ghz , from the data acquired at epoch 2000.00 .",
    "in addition to the extended emission at @xmath21  mas to the north - northwest of the core , first reported by u99 , the core is significantly resolved along the direction of the beam .",
    "in fact , the core appears to contain a new double source within the main peak .",
    "this component is quite obvious in the visibility function ; fig .",
    "[ fig : visplot ] shows the 22  ghz visibility amplitude and phase plotted against projected baseline along position angle 165(15  west of north ) , for data from 1998.75 , 2000.00 and the line - free channels from the maser observations on 2000.44 .",
    "this figure shows that the dominant source ( component 1 in u99 ) has changed from being barely resolved in 1998.75 , with the flux decreasing only slightly at longer baselines , to strongly resolved in 2000.44 . in the 2000.00 data",
    ", there is a clear minimum in the visibility function , which reaches almost to zero for a projected baseline separation of 210240 million wavelengths .",
    "this implies the presence of two components with nearly equal intensity with a separation of @xmath22  mas .",
    "multi - component gaussian fitting in the image plane confirms that the two strongest components are separated by 0.43 mas .",
    "a somewhat larger separation is evident from the 22  ghz continuum image made from the maser observations in 2000.44 , where the peak radio emission is now significantly displaced from the southern edge of the core component .",
    "the minimum in the visibility function is at 160 million wavelengths , suggesting a separation between the two components of @xmath23  mas .",
    "this is likely to be an overestimate because the additional continuum component further to the northwest causes the visibility minimum to move toward a shorter baseline length ( larger separation ) than would be true for an isolated double source .",
    "this yields an upper limit on the apparent separation speed of @xmath24 between 2000.00 and 2000.44 .",
    "the new component , which was not separately detectable at 1998.75 , seems to have appeared concurrently with the flare in the nucleus of the galaxy . at 15",
    "ghz , component  1 was reported by u99 to change from a 100  mjy unresolved component at 1997.10 to a 550  mjy resolved component at 1998.75 , probably indicating the beginning of the emergence of the new component .",
    "table  [ tab : vlba - res ] contains the results of gaussian fits to the core components at various frequencies and different epochs . within the central few milliarcseconds of the source",
    ", components are numbered from south to north ; because of the newly emerging components , component 1 of u99 has been split into first two components , 1a and 1b , for the 2000.00 data , and then a third component designated 1c that appears between them in the 2000.44 image made by averaging the line - free channels in the spectral - line data .",
    "this new component may indicate the re - emergence of the `` core '' component previously referred to as component 1 as 1a and 1b have separated sufficiently to `` expose '' 1c .",
    "its location is marked in figure  [ fig : profplot ] .    adding the third epoch at 15  ghz ,",
    "measuring all components relative to the position of 1a , the southernmost component , we find that the proper motion of component 2 between the first and third epochs is @xmath25  mas  yr@xmath2 ( @xmath26 error quoted ) , consistent with u99 who found a proper motion of @xmath27  mas  yr@xmath2 between the first two epochs .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath28 .",
    "the relative speeds of components 1 ( or 1a ) and 2 at 8.4 and 22  ghz have not been assessed , because component 1 at 8.4  ghz is affected significantly by apparent synchrotron self - absorption , while component 2 is well - resolved at 22  ghz at 2000.0 , and has no isolated component peak .",
    "we note that component 2 has brightened and component 3 has appeared at 15 ghz between 1998.75 and 2000.00 , implying that they may be responding to the flare in the nucleus .",
    "figure  [ fig : spectra ] shows the radio spectra of components 1 ( all sub - components added together ) and 2 at 1998.75 and 2000.00 .",
    "the radio flare at 8.4  ghz appears to lag the flares at 15 and 22  ghz ( also shown in the integrated flux measurements in fig .",
    "[ fig : vlaspec ] ) , perhaps due to optical depth effects ; in this regard , at 2000.00 , component 1a is @xmath29  mas closer to 1b at 8.4  ghz than at the higher frequencies .",
    "the spectrum of component 1 seems to have a maximum near 15  ghz at both epochs , and its sub - components also peak near 15  ghz .",
    "given the sub - parsec sizes of the components , synchrotron self - absorption is likely .",
    "however , since all components show a peak relatively near the same frequency at different epochs , the frequency of the peak emission of component 1 was probably between 5 and 15  ghz at 1997.10 .",
    "this may imply that the radio emitters are free - free absorbed by a common parcel of foreground gas , perhaps in the circumnuclear torus that was discussed by u99 .",
    "figure  [ fig : profplot ] shows three line profiles toward 348 taken in 2000.44 .",
    "the maser emission is clearly seen to lie along the line of sight to component 2 , the fainter continuum component , rather than components 1a , 1c and 1b which comprise the brightest region of the continuum source .",
    "the gaussian fit to the line shown in the upper left profile has an amplitude of 142  mjy and an integrated flux of 2.110.34 jy / beam/ , indicating that all of the flux measured in the effelsberg may 2 observation ( 2.120.18 jy / beam/  with a peak of 16 mjy ) has been recovered .",
    "the fwhm is 13911  centered on 46412.2 , consistent with the single - dish measurements and redshifted by 134  with respect to the systemic velocity .",
    "a tentative 2 component fit to the data yields a narrower line at 46823 with fwhm60  and amplitude 91  mjy , and a broader line at 46174 with fwhm100  and amplitude 111  mjy , again consistent with our single - dish measurements .    the plots in figure  [ fig : pixbypix ] show gaussian fits to the data at each pixel .",
    "pixels where the signal to noise ratio in the line was less than three have been blanked .",
    "maser emission is seen only toward the northern jet .",
    "this emission is unresolved at our angular resolution of 0.42@xmath30.76 mas , corresponding to a linear size of less than 0.25 pc .",
    "the central panel in figure  [ fig : pixbypix ] shows a velocity gradient that , in conjunction with the gradient in fwhm depicted in the right panel , appears to show that the narrower , higher velocity emission component described above arises to the southeast of the slightly broader , lower velocity line . while this gradient by itself should not be over - interpreted as",
    "the masing region is unresolved , the possibility that the higher velocity component may be caused by masing in gas closer to the central engine of the source is supported by the fact that the higher velocity component was seen to flare in april 2001 , 80 days before a similar flare in the lower velocity component was observed , as described in @xmath163.1 .",
    "although we do not have high enough time resolution in our monitoring program to ascertain exactly when either flare began , we can still estimate the maximum distance between the two regions responsible for these masers , based on the distance covered in 80 days at light - speed , to be 2.07@xmath310@xmath30 cm , or 0.07 pc .",
    "this distance is well within the size restrictions imposed by the maximum linear size of the maser source .",
    "much higher time resolution is needed to measure an accurate time delay .",
    "megamaser sources in which the mechanism causing population inversion is thought to be an interaction between the radio jet and a molecular cloud can provide detailed information about the conditions in the central parsecs of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "the study of these `` jet masers '' can yield information about the molecular clouds in the interstellar medium ( ism ) of the host galaxy , because population inversion in water molecules following a shock in a molecular cloud implies a fairly narrow range of temperatures and pressures in the pre - shock gas ( _ e .",
    "g. _ elitzur 1995 ) .",
    "these sources can also yield important information about the evolution of jets and their hotspots .",
    "systematic reverberation mapping may allow us to determine jet speeds , variations in source sizes and positions , actual distances between the various targets , an estimate of inclination by comparing these distances with projected angular separations , and the relation of the maser components to continuum flares .",
    "although we have only a small number of epochs so far , we can address the evolution of the continuum morphology on mas scales , analyze the physical properties of the gas giving rise to maser emission , and hypothesize about future prospects of jet maser detections .",
    "vlba observations of 348 have thus far shown only sub - relativistic expansion ( u99 ) . the initially ghz - peaked integrated spectrum of 348 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : vlaspec ] ) can be interpreted as an enhancement of one spatial region in a conical jet where the peak frequency is inversely related to the spatial scale ( see blandford & knigl 1979 ; falcke & biermann 1995 ) .",
    "the enhancement could be caused by the formation of compact hotspots as a consequence of the jet hitting a dense target , such as a molecular cloud or torus , or the appearance of new bright components emanating from the central engine .",
    "the fact that the turnover frequency of the spectrum was dropping at the end of 1999 can be interpreted as expansion of the source and supports the interpretation of synchrotron self - absorption for the inverted spectrum .",
    "the flattening of the spectrum at higher frequencies suggests that scales even more compact and therefore probably closer to the nucleus brighten .",
    "this behavior can be compared to the spectral evolution in the recent outburst of the seyfert 1 galaxy iii  zw  2 .",
    "iii  zw  2 showed a self - absorbed synchrotron spectrum with a turnover frequency of 43  ghz ( falcke  1999 ) .",
    "the turnover frequency stayed constant during the outburst , and the source showed no expansion on sub - pc scales .",
    "then the spectral peak dropped quickly to 15  ghz within a few months .",
    "this phase of rapid spectral evolution in iii  zw  2 was accompanied by a superluminal expansion of the source on sub - pc scales ( brunthaler  2000 ) .",
    "the evidence indicates that the center of activity in 348  is likely to be located between components 1a and 1b . at an epoch prior to 1998.75 , jet components were ejected simultaneously in the approaching and receding jets , leading to both the continuum flare and the new flaring activity of the maser .",
    "we base this interpretation both on the fact that the maser emission is redshifted with respect to the systemic velocity of the source , indicating that it most likely arises in the receding jet ( see @xmath16 4.3 ) , and on the fact that we expect to see a detectable corresponding approaching jet component in any radio source where we detect a receding jet component .",
    "thus it seems unlikely that the central engine could be located at the southern extremity of the radio source as had been inferred by u99 .",
    "figure  [ fig : profplot ] shows the image made from 20 line - free channels at the low frequency end of our observing band in the 2000.44 observations .",
    "our inferred position of the core is marked with an asterisk .",
    "limits can be placed on the separation speed of the new components , 1a and 1b .",
    "a firm lower limit is derived by assuming that at least one of the new components did not exist at 1997.10 , before the radio flare .",
    "therefore , the relative separation of 0.43  mas in 2000.00 (  3.3 ) occurred in less than 2.90  yr , or at a rate of at least 0.15  mas  yr@xmath2 , twice the apparent speed of component 2 during the same period .",
    "an improved lower limit can be derived from the single gaussian source size of 0.16  mas for component 1 at 1998.75 .",
    "this indicates that the separation of 1a and 1b was likely to be no more than 0.16  mas at that epoch , consistent with the lack of a visibility minimum out to nearly 400 million wavelengths ( fig .",
    "[ fig : visplot ] ) giving a lower limit of 0.22  mas  yr@xmath2 between 1998.75 and 2000.00 .",
    "the resolution of component 1 at 1998.75 indicates that 1a already existed , so the upper limit to the apparent speed is 0.43  mas in 1.25  yr , or 0.34  mas  yr@xmath2 .",
    "converting angular motions to linear speeds , we find @xmath31 for the apparent relative speeds of components 1a and 1b between 1998.75 and 2000.00 .",
    "this is also consistent with the upper limit of @xmath24 between 2000.00 and 2000.44 .",
    "although component 2 appears to have sped up between 2000.00 and 2000.44 , perhaps having emerged from the far side of the molecular cloud , the apparent higher speed of 1b relative to 1a implies that it would have caught up with component 2 at approximately 2001.3 .",
    "further vlba continuum monitoring experiments have been undertaken to determine whether this has occurred .",
    "one concern raised by the scenario of a molecular cloud within a projected distance on the order of one parsec from a supermassive object is whether the gas density is high enough to keep the cloud from being disrupted by tidal forces . using 2@xmath310@xmath32 as the central mass of mrk  348 ( nishiura & taniguchi 1998 ) , and an approximate distance of one parsec",
    ", we can calculate whether this cloud is likely to remain intact .",
    "if we assume that the gas is roughly virialized , but infalling so that the kinetic energy is slightly less than the gravitational potential energy , then the upper limit on the circular velocity ( @xmath33 ) around a central massive object of 2@xmath310@xmath32  at a distance of 1 pc is 900 . using this upper limit , we can then estimate the average density ( @xmath34 ) following the reasoning of stark ( 1989 ) .",
    "they estimate the density needed to keep individual parcels of gas bound to a central cloud core near a large central potential to be    @xmath35 @xmath36 3/2@xmath37 g @xmath3",
    "@xmath38/r@xmath39 @xmath40    where r@xmath41 is the distance of the cloud from the dynamical center . using this relationship , we obtain @xmath424@xmath310@xmath43 @xmath40 .",
    "this high value is regarded as an upper limit for the required density of the pre - shocked gas in the masing region for two reasons : first , the trajectory of the molecular cloud is not known but a stable virial orbit in a cloud this close to the central engine seems unlikely ; and second , the masing region is known to be @xmath440.25 pc in extent , and so could correspond to a less dense region or regions in a larger molecular cloud .",
    "this upper limit is thus reasonably consistent with the highest pre - shock density one would expect before maser quenching sets in , around 2@xmath310@xmath32 @xmath40 for high velocity shocks ( _ e .",
    "g. _ elitzur 1995 ) .",
    "this is also within the range of gas densities required to provide enough shielding to keep the gas in a molecular phase , as predicted by theoretical models based on ngc  4258 ( maloney 2002 ; maloney , hollenbach & tielens 1996 ) . within 1 pc of an x - ray source yielding 10@xmath45 ergs s@xmath2 ,",
    "a depth of only 10@xmath46 cm ( @xmath4410@xmath47 pc ) of shielding gas having a density of 10@xmath4810@xmath32 @xmath40 is needed , well within the size of the masing cloud estimated by the time lag between flaring components in  3.4 .",
    "the jet in 348  is probably relativistic but the shock velocity which gives rise to the maser emission is determined not only by the jet velocity , but also by the relative densities of the jet and ambient material .",
    "the shock front is at the outer edge of an expanding bubble or cocoon driven into the cloud by the jet . a cartoon model of this scenario",
    "is shown in figure  [ fig : model ] .",
    "the masing region is located within or immediately behind the radiative shock .",
    "this situation is analogous to that found in high mass star forming regions , where collimated outflow from a young stellar object drives an overpressured cocoon into a dense ism ( see _ e.  g. _ reid  1995 ; mac low  1994 ) .",
    "the morphology of such a bubble in extragalactic sources was explored by scheuer ( 1974 ) , who determined that the bulk of the expansion would take place in the direction of jet propagation , but that the bubble would also expand laterally at slower speeds .",
    "the velocity of the shock front in the direction of propagation of the jet ( @xmath49 ) is related to the jet velocity ( @xmath50 ) and the ratio of the densities of the jet ( @xmath51 ) and the ambient material ( @xmath52 ) by @xmath53(@xmath51/@xmath52)@xmath54 ( _ e .",
    "g. _ elitzur 1995 ) .",
    "in 348 , the jet axis seems to be fairly close to the plane of the sky , as indicated by the optical observations of simpson  ( 1996 ) and the flux densities of outer jet components ( neff & de bruyn 1983 ) and also by the fact that the axis of the radio jet might be close to the plane of the galaxy , which has an inclination angle of 16(braatz , wilson & henkel 1997 ) , in order for the jet to be hitting a dense molecular cloud .",
    "further evidence for the small angle between the radio axis and the plane of the galaxy has recently been presented in the thorough study by antn  ( 2002 ) .",
    "the orientation of the jet close to the plane of the sky should result in shocks with the right orientation to yield strong masers along our line of sight .",
    "this situation is analogous to the galactic masers in star - forming regions , where lower doppler velocities are correlated with stronger masers ( elitzur , hollenbach & mckee 1992 ) .",
    "because all of the detected maser emission is redshifted with respect to the systemic velocity , we assume that the jet component toward which the maser emission is seen is probably the receding jet , and the redshift is caused by the entrainment of gas in this jet which is directed somewhere between the plane of the sky and along the line of sight away from us . in order to maintain velocity coherence",
    ", we suspect that the shock velocity in the direction of jet propagation ( the `` head '' of the bubble ) should be at least equal to the line of sight component of entrainment velocity",
    ". if the jet is close to the plane of the sky , the total shock velocity might be much higher .",
    "the maximum shock velocity expected is 300 , since anything higher than that will destroy the dust grains which are required to provide condensation nuclei in the post - shock gas for the hydrogen to coalesce into h@xmath0 and then to form 2o  ( elitzur , hollenbach & mckee 1989 ) . if we assume that the maser emission comes from the head of the expanding bubble and @xmath50",
    "is between 0.1c and 0.5c ( a range covering the measured expansion speed of the jet components ) , then a density contrast of 10@xmath55 between the jet and the ambient material is required . for @xmath5210@xmath32 @xmath40 based on the requirements described above to preserve the cloud (  4.2 )",
    ", this implies @xmath51100 @xmath40 . for a higher density jet , the dust",
    "would be disrupted in the region immediately behind the shock at the head of the bubble , and so the maser emission would have to arise from regions where the shock front is expanding at slower speeds laterally into the cloud . if the two velocity components seen in the line profiles are representative of masing arising from the shocks on `` front '' and `` back '' sides of the bubble from our viewpoint , then a lower limit on the shock velocity can be estimated based on the line of sight components of the separation velocity .",
    "the centroids of the main line components are separated by 70 yielding a lower limit on the shock velocity of 35 .",
    "this lower limit is still consistent with the range of velocities needed to produce population inversion in gas with a pre - shock density between 10@xmath55 and a few times 10@xmath32 @xmath40 .",
    "although few other molecules have been searched for since the onset of the continuum flare in 348 , we have made a deep search for ammonia with the effelsberg 100 m telescope .",
    "we do not detect any ammonia ( nh@xmath56 ) in absorption toward the continuum source , with 1@xmath13 upper limits of between 17 and 10  mjy for the ( 1,1 ) through ( 4,4 ) lines with 1  channel spacing ( falcke  2000 ) .",
    "this is perhaps not surprising in view of the conditions in the post - shock gas .",
    "h@xmath0o and nh@xmath56 are hydrogenated molecules",
    ". these are , as a consequence of the high mobility of atomic hydrogen on cold surfaces , abundant on dust grain mantles ( e.g. van dishoeck & blake 1998 ) .",
    "a moderate velocity c - shock ( velocities ranging from 0 to 60 ) , as well as a more violent j - shock ( velocities @xmath5760 ) that disrupts icy dust grain mantles without destroying the dust entirely , can cause a significant increase in the gas phase abundances of h@xmath0o and nh@xmath56 .",
    "evaporation temperatures are @xmath1100k for both molecules .",
    "h@xmath0o abundances appear to be [ h@xmath0o]/[h@xmath0 ] @xmath1 10@xmath5910@xmath60 in cool molecular cloud cores ( e.g. melnick  2000 ; snell  2000a , b , c ; neufeld  2000b ) , 10@xmath61 in stellar outflow sources ( e.g. neufeld  2000a ) , and 10@xmath62 in warm shock heated gas ( melnick  2000 ) . at temperatures of several hundred to a few thousand degrees , common in c - shocks or in the radiative region behind j - shocks , reactions with energy barriers become efficient and direct gas phase formation of h@xmath0o takes place via o + h@xmath0 @xmath63 oh + h and oh + h@xmath0 @xmath63 h@xmath0o + h.    in the case of nh@xmath56 , quiescent dark clouds have typically @xmath64[nh@xmath56]/@xmath64[h@xmath0 ] @xmath1 10@xmath60 ( e.g. benson & myers 1983 ; their table  5 ) , but abundances become 10@xmath6110@xmath66 in hot cores ( e.g. mauersberger , henkel & wilson 1987 ; hermsen , wilson & bieging 1988 ; cesaroni  1994 ) , where dust grain evaporation is believed to modify the chemical constituents of the gas . unlike h@xmath0o , gas phase nh@xmath56 formation appears not to be drastically accelerated in the warm post shock gas ( e.g. ho & townes 1983 ) .",
    "h@xmath0o is less rapidly destroyed by photodissociation than nh@xmath56 ( e.g. crovisier 2001 ) and has a higher energy threshold for photodissociation ( @xmath16.6 versus 4.1  ev ; crovisier 1989 ; suto & lee 1983 ) .",
    "thus nh@xmath56 should be destroyed more rapidly by the ultraviolet radiation that is expected to arise during the hot adiabatic phase of a j - shock .",
    "we thus find two qualitative scenarios : behind a c - shock , where the bulk of the gas remains molecular and where no additional uv - radiation is produced , h@xmath0o _ and _ nh@xmath56 abundances should be enhanced due to the release of grain mantle material into the interstellar medium . in more violent j - shocks , however , where gas phase molecules get destroyed , h@xmath0o re - formation proceeds much faster , since potential barriers do not inhibit its direct gas - phase formation and since photodissociation by uv radiation from the shock affects predominantly nh@xmath56 .",
    "thus the non - detection of nh@xmath56 implies a j - shock scenario , consistent with the argument above that relativistic jets from the nuclei of active galaxies should have the potential to create fast j - shocks in molecular clouds .",
    "although many water maser surveys have been conducted on seyfert galaxies with low detection rates ( braatz  1997 and refs . therein ) , the newly discovered `` jet masers '' suggest a new criterion for selecting targets for much deeper searches . in sources where the orientation of the radio jets with respect to the disks of the spiral galaxies is known",
    ", a small separation angle makes them worthy of a much longer integration than has been afforded individual sources in previous large samples .",
    "new receiver technology also makes it possible to detect much weaker masers than in the past .",
    "in particular , the masers in ngc 1052 and 348  would not have been detected but for exceptionally sensitive observations with a flat baseline ( as are now routinely available at 22  ghz at the effelsberg 100 m telescope ) .",
    "we are currently undertaking a survey of target sources which have been selected from a collection of seyfert galaxies in which both the inclination of the host galaxy and the linear extent of the radio source are known ( nagar & wilson 1999 ) . to maximize our detection rate of jet masers we have chosen nearby active galaxies for which there is a high probability of strong interaction between radio jets and galaxy ism .",
    "these sources are seyfert galaxies with a face - on ( @xmath6735 ) galaxy disk in optical observations and extended radio structures in vla or vlba observations , indicating that both the disk of the galaxy and the radio jet should be fairly close to the plane of the sky .",
    "this combination of geometries increases the probability that the radio jet lies close to the disk of the galaxy .",
    "indeed , three of the four known jet maser sources , ngc  1068 , ngc  1052 and 348  were among the galaxies selected from the parent sample using the above criteria , suggesting that this method of selection should yield a much higher detection rate than has been achieved in past surveys .",
    "during early 2000 , the h@xmath0o emission toward 348  showed a dramatic intensity increase which followed a significant increase in the flux of the nuclear radio continuum source in late 1998 .",
    "the unusual line profile led us to suspect that this source , like ngc  1052 ( claussen  1998 ) , might belong to a class of megamaser galaxies in which the amplified emission is the result of an interaction between the radio jet and an encroaching molecular cloud , rather than occurring in a circumnuclear disk ( falcke  2000 ) .",
    "analysis of our vlba observations indicates that the maser emission does indeed arise along the line of sight to a jet component in 348 , confirming this prediction .",
    "the very high linewidth occurring on such small spatial scales and the rapid variability indicate that the h@xmath0o emission is more likely to arise from a shocked region at the interface between the energetic jet material and the molecular gas in the cloud where the jet is boring through , than simply as the result of amplification by molecular clouds along the line of sight to the continuum jet .",
    "the orientation of the radio jets close to the plane of the sky also results in shocks with the preferred orientation for strong masers from our vantage point .",
    "this hypothesis is supported by the spectral evolution of the continuum source , which showed an inverted radio spectrum with a peak at 22  ghz , later shifting to lower frequencies .",
    "further evidence for the ejection of new components in the jets is shown by the sub - pc scale vlba observations made over a period of 3 years . in this scenario ,",
    "the recent high frequency radio continuum flare , the linear motion of the brightest continuum components and the flare in the maser emission are all attributable to the generation and ejection of new components in the approaching and receding jets .",
    "the very close temporal correlation between the flaring activity in the maser emission and the continuum flare further suggest that the masing region and the continuum hotspots are nearly equidistant from the central engine and may be different manifestations of the same dynamical events .",
    "the gas in the molecular cloud within the central parsecs of 348 has a pre - shock density ranging from around 10@xmath55 @xmath40 to a few times 10@xmath43 @xmath40 .",
    "an expanding bow - shock being driven into this cloud by the agn jet has a velocity between 135  and 0.5c in the direction of jet propagation , and between 35  and 300  at various points along the oblique edges .",
    "this shock generates a region of very high temperature , ( @xmath6810@xmath69 k ) , which dissociates the molecular gas and to some extent shatters the dust grains expected to be present and/or evaporates their icy mantles . immediately following this shock",
    ", h@xmath0 begins forming on the surviving dust grains when the temperature has dropped to 1000 k , and this in turn provides sufficient heating to stabilize the temperature at 400 k , with gas densities of 10@xmath32 @xmath40 and ultimately an 2o  abundance as high as 10@xmath66 .",
    "ammonia is not found because the levels of uv radiation remain too high , but the detection of other molecular species will help to test this scenario .",
    "for example , we are currently undertaking a search for sio masers which might be generated as the gas is liberated from the solid phase by the shattering of dust grains toward the head of the shock .",
    "we are also searching for formaldehyde which might be located within the cocoon , and  from the outer edges of the cloud which might be detectable in absorption toward the background continuum source .",
    "we thank lincoln greenhill , james braatz , mark claussen , greg taylor , chris carilli and floris van der tak for enlightening discussion and/or comments .",
