    "heavy ion collisions at the relativistic heavy - ion collider ( rhic ) have made it possible to obtain important information on the properties of the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) that is produced in these collisions  @xcite . among the many observables that have been used to infer the properties of the qgp are the anisotropic flows of produced particles , particularly the elliptic flow ( @xmath1 )  @xcite that corresponds to the second - order harmonic coefficient of the anisotropic flow and is appreciable in noncentral collisions of identical nuclei .",
    "more recently , it was found that the triangular flow @xmath2 that corresponds to the third - order harmonic coefficient of the anisotropic flow could also be significant in collisions of all centralities as a result of initial density fluctuations in the collision geometry  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it was shown that studying @xmath2 together with @xmath1 can help better constrain the properties of the qgp  @xcite .",
    "also , it was suggested that useful information about the qgp could be obtained from the dihadron correlation  @xcite between lower-@xmath3 associated particles from the medium response to the away - side jet and higher-@xmath3 trigger particles produced from the near - side jet .",
    "studies based on the transport model showed that higher - order anisotropic flows , especially the triangular flow , had a large effect on dihadron correlations induced by initial energetic jets  @xcite . to extract from the dihadron correlation information on the interactions of energetic jets produced from initial hard collisions with medium partons in the quark - gluon plasma requires , however",
    ", the subtraction of the background contribution from anisotropic flows and their fluctuations , and this is a topic of great current interest  @xcite .",
    "recently , results from the first pb - pb collisions at @xmath4 tev at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) have attracted a lot of attentions  @xcite . in the most central collisions ( @xmath5 ) , the multiplicity density of produced charged particles at mid - pseudorapidity is @xmath6 times of that in au+au collisions at @xmath7 gev at rhic .",
    "the measured elliptic flow , which can provide more reliable information about the produced qgp  @xcite , is of a similar magnitude as that measured at rhic . besides",
    ", experimental data on higher - order flows  @xcite and dihadron correlations  @xcite have also become available , providing the opportunity to study the properties of the hotter and denser qgp formed at lhc . in particular , it was found that the long - range dihadron azimuthal correlations could be entirely accounted for by the anisotropic flows  @xcite .    in a recent work  @xcite",
    ", we studied pb - pb collisions at @xmath4 tev in a multiphase transport ( ampt ) model .",
    "the ampt model is a hybrid model with the initial particle distribution generated by the heavy ion jet interaction generator ( hijing ) model  @xcite . in the version of string melting , which was used in the previous work  @xcite and",

    "quarks and aniquarks are converted via a spatial coalescence model to hadrons , and the scatterings among them are described by a relativistic transport ( art ) model  @xcite .",
    "for a recent review of the ampt model , we refer the readers to ref .  @xcite . by adjusting the values of parameters in the lund string fragmentation function and the parton scattering cross section",
    ", we fitted the differential elliptic flow at @xmath8 centrality window and reproduced reasonably well the centrality dependence of both the multiplicity density and the elliptic flow of mid - pseudorapidity charged particles  @xcite , although the transverse momentum spectrum at most central collisions is softer than the data from the alice collaboration as a result of the use of massless partons in the model that are less affected by the radial flow  @xcite . in the present paper ,",
    "we study higher - order anisotropic flows and dihadron correlations in pb - pb collisions at lhc by using the ampt model with the newly fitted parameters .",
    "our results show that in heavy ion collisions at lhc higher - order flows are appreciable and a ridge structure exists in the dihadron correlation as seen in the experiments  @xcite . the ridge structure is a result of the longitudinal expansion of the anisotropic flows as pointed out previously in ref .",

    "it is seen that the anisotropic flows for different pseudorapidity cut @xmath41 and @xmath35 are similar to those from the alice data , while at larger transverse momenta in the case of the smaller pseudorapdity cut the ampt model gives larger values due to overestimated nonflow effects .",
    "as for rhic  @xcite , anisotropic flows for the most central collisions from the ampt model are overestimated in comparison with those from the alice data , while they are consistent with the alice data for mid - central collisions .",
    "the reason for this might be due to the constant parton scattering cross section used in the ampt model for all centralities .",
    "since the temperature of produced partonic matter is higher in central collisions than in mid - central collisions , a smaller strong coupling constant and a larger screening mass  @xcite should be used in calculating the parton scattering cross section .",

    "we note that once the elliptic flow is fitted , the higher - order flows are automatically consistent with the experimental data .",
