    "present studies primarily rely on tracing molecular gas through the observation of low rotational emission lines of co. this provides a selective , if not biased , view of the molecular universe .",
    "co observations may well miss a major fraction of the molecular gas in galaxies hidden in their low metallicity outskirts as well as key aspects of the energetic interplay between galaxies and the intergalactic medium , and between stars and their nascent clouds .",
    "molecules are known to be ubiquitous .",
    "they have been observed in both the local and the distant universe , in environments as diverse as proto - planetary disks , star forming regions , the diffuse interstellar medium , galactic disks , cooling flows , and distant ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) .",
    "however , observations have so far remained blind to the main constituent of this gas , h@xmath1 , leaving its role in cosmic evolution and its diagnostic power , mostly unexplored .",
    "the @xmath8 and @xmath9 satellite observations studied the electronic transitions in the uv and were sensitive to very low h@xmath1 column densities , but the uv absorption by dust is also very important and these observations are limited to tenuous regions .",
    "they miss h@xmath1 in shielded regions and thus , most of the h@xmath1 in the universe .",
    "the near - infrared rovibrational transitions ( 10 transitions and above ) are routinely imaged from ground - based telescopes . emission in these lines mostly results from fluorescence following uv absorption . very high densities and temperatures are required for the collisional excitation of the vibrationally excited levels .",
    "the first rotational transitions in the mid - infrared ( 00 s(0 ) at 28.2@xmath2 m , s(1 ) at 17.0@xmath2 m , s(2 ) at 12.3@xmath2 m , s(3 ) at 9.7@xmath2 m ... ) are more relevant to baryonic structure evolution because they relate to the energetics of the bulk of the molecular gas .",
    "most of the h@xmath1 is too cold to emit strongly , but uv pumping and the dissipation of both ordered , and turbulent kinetic energy give rise to significant emission in the pure rotational lines .",

    "the motor is activated at each step and is cut during the constant 20s integration time per image which follows the motion , making negligible the heat load .",
    "the distance between the two cat s eyes produces a very small lateral motion ( 0.7 mm ) for the maximum travel .",
