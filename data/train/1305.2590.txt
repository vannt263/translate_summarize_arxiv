    "in recent years experiments with trapped ions have made important contributions to many fields in physics @xcite .",

    "we exhibit in the analysis the interesting effect of large quantum mechanical uncertainties in regions close to the instability region .",
    "although the average values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 follow the classical trajectories the uncertainties exhibit significant quantum mechanical behavior .",
    "our analysis has important implications , e.g. , the use of mass spectrometry can be applied only in the regions of small quantum mechanical fluctuations  @xcite which can be calculated exactly by our method ; a trapped ion can be stored as long as the quantum fluctuations are smaller than the trap dimension .",
    "of course , the time - dependent quadratic hamiltonian is basic in all fields of physics and our new simplified expression for its exact propagator should be very useful .    in our previous work  @xcite the general quadratic time - dependent hamiltonian was considered @xmath2 with @xmath3 arbitrary real functions of time and @xmath4 a real positive function of time .",

    "this is demonstrated in the next section for the classical case and can also be applied to the quantum case .",
    "in the classical case ( with arbitrary friction term , not necessarily derived from hamilton equations ) we have @xmath34 defining @xmath27 as the solution of the homogeneous equation we write the classical invariant ( analogous to eq .  ) @xmath35 with @xmath36 the classical trajectory is @xmath37 thus , the forced motion is obtained by solving the homogenous equation for @xmath27 . in particular , the well known result  @xcite for the forced harmonic oscillator ( @xmath38 @xmath39 @xmath40 ) may be achieved directly @xmath41    a paul trap utilizes a combination of dc and ac fields in order to trap an ion ( with charge @xmath42 ) in a stable trajectory .",
