    "elm wds are interesting because the universe is not old enough to form them through single - star evolution . instead",
    ", elm wds form out of binary common envelope evolution @xcite .",
    "the result is that elm wds are the signposts of ultra - compact double - degenerate binaries , systems that are among the strongest known mhz gravitational wave sources @xcite .",
    "we use the term elm wd to describe a wd with surface gravity @xmath2 and effective temperature 8,@xmath3000  k , an empirical definition inspired by the near complete absence of such objects in major spectroscopic wd catalogs @xcite .",
    "we identify elm wds by their spectra : hydrogen balmer lines provide a sensitive measure of surface gravity in this effective temperature range .",
    "elm wds are distinct from helium - burning sdb stars that have @xmath4,000  k @xcite at these surface gravities .",
    "elm wds are also distinct from hydrogen - burning main sequence stars that have @xmath5 at these temperatures @xcite .",
    "others have referred to similar objects as `` low - mass wds '' @xcite , `` helium - core wd progenitors '' @xcite , and `` proto - wds '' @xcite .",
    "theoretical wd evolutionary models indicate that there can indeed be some ambiguity about the evolutionary status of @xmath6 hydrogen atmosphere objects : thermonuclear hydrogen shell flashes , present in @xmath7 @xmath1  wd tracks , can cause wds to loop around in @xmath8-@xmath9 space before they settle on the final cooling track @xcite .",
    "observationally , elm wds in eclipsing binaries obey wd mass - radius relations @xcite .",
    "pulsating elm wds display pulsation frequencies that validate them as @xmath100.2 @xmath1  degenerate objects @xcite .",
    "we thus feel comfortable calling our @xmath11 objects elm wds , whether or not there is residual shell burning .",
    "the recent discovery of a pulsating elm wd in the highly relativistic binary psr j1738 + 0333 will enable future , high - precision constraints on the internal structure and evolutionary state of an elm wd @xcite .",
    "our approach to finding new elm wds is to select candidates by broadband color , and then to obtain spectroscopy to identify the nature of the objects .",
    "previous elm survey papers have reported the discovery of 73 low mass wds , 67 of which are in single - line spectroscopic binaries with orbital periods @xmath12 day @xcite .",
    "the most spectacular object to - date is the @xmath13 sec detached eclipsing wd binary j0651 , a gravitational wave source 10,000 times stronger than the hulse - taylor pulsar @xcite .    here",
    ", we present 15 new elm wd candidates , 9 of which are in short period binaries",
    ". we will henceforth refer to any double - degenerate binary that contains an elm wd as an elm wd binary .",
    "six of the elm wd candidates show no significant radial velocity variation .",
    "while the non - variable objects have @xmath14 , the absence of orbital motion means that we can not be certain whether or not they are elm wds .",
    "@xcite recently identified a population of `` sda '' stars at comparable @xmath9  and @xmath15,000 k in the sdss spectroscopic catalog .",
    "given that many of our non - variable objects are clumped around 8,000 k , and that the number of our non - variable objects is in tension with the number of low inclination binaries expected in a random sample , at least some of the non - variable objects may be linked to this sda stellar population .",
    "we focus our discussion on using the elm wd binary sample to study the distribution of elm wd orbital properties .",
    "we begin by defining a clean sample of elm wd binaries for detailed analysis .",
    "we fit the observed distribution of orbital period and semi - amplitude , and then derive the distribution of companion mass @xmath16 .",
    "the average companion is a 0.76 @xmath1  wd , which implies an average binary mass ratio of 1:4 and a total binary mass below the chandrasekhar mass .",

    "we take reddening values from sdss , and indicate de - reddened photometry and colors with a subscript 0 .",
    "objects fall outside our target selection regions for two reasons .",
    "first , a handful of elm wd candidates were selected from the sdss spectroscopic catalog and thus were not drawn from the hvs survey and elm survey target selection regions @xcite .",
    "second , sdss photometry has changed since our original target selection : of the five objects published here that come from the hvs survey , three are now 1 - 2@xmath17 outliers from the hvs survey target selection region ( see green diamonds in figure [ fig : ugr ] ) presumably due to photometric recalibrations .",
    "the sdss colors for our objects thus have systematic errors comparable to their published statistical errors .",

    "we measure radial velocities using the rvsao cross - correlation program @xcite with high signal - to - noise templates .",

    "our observing strategy is to acquire a single spectrum per target , identify candidate elm wds from the initial spectra , then re - observe candidate elm wds in subsequent observing runs .",
    "if a candidate showed velocity variability , we continue to observe the object until we constrain its orbital solution .",

    "we note that j0125 + 2017 and j1128 + 1743 are abnormally low surface gravity objects , with @xmath118 , @xmath190 k , and masses around 0.19 @xmath1  if they are elm wds .",
    "their low @xmath191 km  s@xmath19  semi - amplitudes imply that the unseen companions are comparable 0.2 @xmath1  mass objects at 2.5 @xmath181   orbital separations ( assuming @xmath182 ) .",
    "alternatively , it is possible these objects are very metal poor , young main sequence stars .",
    "padova tracks show that a 1.6 @xmath1 , @xmath192 star has similar @xmath8  and @xmath9  at @xmath193 myr ages @xcite .",
    "if j0125 + 2017 and j1128 + 1743 are very metal poor main sequence stars , their orbital motion would be due to 0.4 @xmath1  mass companions at 4.5 @xmath181   orbital separations .",
    "very metal poor main sequence stars should not be forming near the sun , but blue stragglers are possible ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "however , observed blue stragglers have typical orbital periods of @xmath1941000 days @xcite .",

    "j1555 + 2444 is a possible elm wd + m dwarf system .",
    "the m dwarf is classified as an 0.43 @xmath1  m2 star @xcite .",
    "assuming that the m2 star dominates the @xmath195-band flux and has absolute magnitude @xmath196 @xcite , its distance is about 0.51 kpc .",
    "this is consistent with the 0.44 kpc and 0.49 kpc distance estimates to the hot @xmath8= 18,170 k elm wd using @xcite and @xcite tracks , respectively .",

    "we constrain its orbital semi - amplitude to have a 95% confidence upper limit of @xmath197 km  s@xmath19  on the basis of 6 epochs of radial velocities obtained over 2 yrs .",
    "this result is in tension with the work of @xcite , who find that the period distribution of wd + main sequence binaries peaks around @xmath198 hr .",

    "an obvious question is whether our observations have missed potential companions .",
    "we explore the sensitivity of our radial velocities to different possible orbital periods and semi - amplitudes following the procedure described by @xcite : we monte",
    "- carlo the observed velocities with their errors , and count the number of 10,000 orbital fits that have f - test probabilities @xmath201 for orbital periods between 0.1 and 2 days .    figure [ fig : pktest ] presents the averaged result for the six non - variable elm wd candidates .",
    "the lines in figure [ fig : pktest ] represent the probability of detecting @xmath200 , 75 , and 100 km  s@xmath19  orbits as a function of @xmath185 given our set of observations .",
    "the objects have 6 or 7 epochs of time - series spectroscopy and a total of a couple dozen observations each .",
    "figure [ fig : pktest ] shows that , while our ground - based observations are naturally less sensitive around 12 hr and 24 hr orbital periods , we are sensitive to almost any orbit with @xmath202 km  s@xmath19 . on average , our observations should detect 95% of binary systems with @xmath175 km  s@xmath19   and 99% of binary systems with @xmath203 km  s@xmath19  out to @xmath204 day orbital periods . yet our observations show that the non - variable systems have a typical 95% confidence upper limit of @xmath205 km  s@xmath19 .    while we expect to find some binaries in face - on orientations , it is hard to explain all of the non - variable elm wd candidates in this way . restricting ourselves to the 78 best elm wd candidates in our survey , those objects with @xmath206 , we find 67 binaries and 11 non - variable objects .",
    "the median semi - amplitude of the elm wd binaries is @xmath207 km  s@xmath19 , a semi - amplitude that would appear @xmath208 km  s@xmath19  for @xmath209 inclinations . assuming a random distribution of inclinations ,",
    "only 5 of the 78 objects with @xmath206 should have @xmath209 .",
    "yet 11 of the 78 objects are non - variable .",
    "if we adopt the uncertainty as @xmath210 , the excess of non - variable objects appears significant at the 2.5-@xmath17 level .",
    "this excess suggests that the non - variable elm wd candidates in our sample may not all be face - on binary systems .    to avoid possible bias in relying on observed semi - amplitudes",
    ", we can instead assume a companion mass distribution @xmath16 and ask what fraction of binaries should fall below our detection threshold .",
    "if we adopt the lognormal orbital period distribution ( allowing @xmath211 ) and the normal @xmath16 distribution derived below ( section 4 ) and assume a random distribution of inclinations , 6.5 of 78 binaries should have @xmath212 km  s@xmath19 .",
    "this number is in 2-@xmath17 disagreement with the number of observed non - variable elm wd candidates . while not formally significant , it is suggestive that @xcite find a similar excess of non - variable objects in their sample of @xmath213 @xmath1  low mass wds .",
    "thus our non - variable objects are possibly binaries with long orbital periods , or they are possibly something else altogether .",
    "notably , 8 of the 11 non - variable elm wd candidates are found clumped together around @xmath214,000  k at the cool edge of our survey .",
    "@xcite recently identified thousands of similar `` sda '' stars with @xmath15,000  k and @xmath6 in the sdss spectroscopic catalog .",
    "the non - variable elm candidates are possibly linked to these sda stars , however the sda stars can not be elm wds on the basis of their numbers .",
    "according to the evolutionary tracks , an elm wd spends about as much time with @xmath215 k as it spends at 8,@xmath216,000 k. shell flashes can cause the time spent in these temperature ranges to differ by a factor of 2 , but not by a factor of 10 .",
    "the models also show that 8,000 k elm wds are about 3 mag fainter in @xmath170 than 12,000 k elm wds .",
    "taken together , a magnitude - limited survey should observe fewer elm wds at 8,000 k than at higher temperatures .",
    "yet the sda stars of @xcite are over 10 times more abundant than our higher-@xmath8   elm wd binaries in the same footprint of sky .",
    "we conclude that the sda stars are probably unrelated to elm wds .",
    "our 8 non - variable objects with @xmath214,000  k are possibly related to the sda stars .",
    "if true , this would explain why we find so many non - variable objects around 8,000 k. the three hotter non - variable objects would then be consistent at the 1-@xmath17 level with the number of elm wds we would expect to find in face - on binaries in our color - selected survey .",
    "given the ambiguity about the nature of the non - variable objects , we focus the remainder of this paper on the elm wd binaries .",
    "we begin by defining a clean sample of elm wd binaries , and then use that sample to derive the orbital period and secondary mass distributions of the sample .",
    "we construct a clean sample of elm wd binaries by first taking the 88 published elm survey objects and excluding the 12 non - variable objects .",
    "we further restrict the sample to those binaries with @xmath202 km  s@xmath19 , a semi - amplitude threshold above which our catalog should be 95% complete ( figure [ fig : pktest ] ) .",
    "the elm survey color selection provides a built - in temperature selection , but the @xmath9   selection is more ambiguous .",
    "@xcite 3d corrections push some of the wd surface gravities below @xmath217 .",
    "we have also obtained observations for every wd near @xmath218 during the course of our survey . since we would like to maximize our number statistics , we choose to restrict our sample to @xmath219 , a range over which the elm survey observations should be reasonably complete . taken together ,",
    "these cuts leave us with a clean sample of 62 elm wd binaries .",
    "we present the clean sample in table [ tab : clean ] sorted by orbital period .",
    "next , we consider the orbital period distribution of the clean sample , plotted in figure [ fig : pdist ] . the median orbital period of the clean sample is 0.226 days , or 5.4 hrs .",
    "we use the non - parametric anderson - darling test to evaluate the goodness of fit between a model distribution and the observations @xcite .",
    "the p - value of the anderson - darling test is the probability that the model and observations share a common distribution .",
    "a p - value of zero rejects the null hypothesis that the model and observations share a common distribution .",
    "we fit different functional forms to the period distribution and find that the observations are best matched by a lognormal distribution , @xmath220 where p is the period , @xmath221 is the lognormal mean , and @xmath222 is the standard deviation .",
    "we restrict the fit to @xmath223 day to match the absence of orbital periods greater than @xmath101 day in the clean sample .",
    "the green lines in figure [ fig : pdist ] show the best fit for lognormal mean @xmath224 and standard deviation @xmath225 .",
    "the anderson - darling p - value is 0.999 , indicating a strong consistency between the model and the observations .",
    "we now derive the ( unseen ) secondary mass distribution by considering the distribution of observables .",
    "formally , the observed orbital period @xmath185 , semi - amplitude @xmath226 , and derived elm wd mass @xmath227 are related to the secondary mass @xmath16 and orbital inclination @xmath228 by the binary mass function , @xmath229 given our surface gravity constraints , the elm wd mass distribution @xmath227 is narrow and centered around @xmath1940.2 @xmath1 .",
    "thus most of the information about @xmath16 is encoded in the semi - amplitude distribution .",
    "inclinations of individual binaries are unknown , however the target selection is known : the elm wds were targeted by color .",
    "thus we will assume that the inclination distribution is random in @xmath230 above our detection threshold .",
    "our computational approach is to monte carlo different trial distributions of @xmath16 .",
    "we draw inclination from a random @xmath230 distribution and @xmath185 from the observed lognormal distribution .",
    "we clip the simulations to match the observational @xmath202 km  s@xmath19  sample limit , a threshold that translates into an @xmath231 limit in inclination .",
    "we then use the anderson - darling test to quantify how likely the simulated and observed distributions of semi - amplitude share a common distribution .",
    "figure [ fig : m2 ] presents three trial @xmath16 distributions and their corresponding simulated @xmath226 distributions compared to the observations . at the top",

    "the flat @xmath16 distribution produces a @xmath226 distribution that clearly differs from the observations ( @xmath232 ) . in the middle is the wd mass distribution observed by sdss @xcite .",
    "the sdss wd mass distribution produces a @xmath226 distribution that agrees somewhat better with the observations ( @xmath233 ) .",

    "@xcite also finds a similar result using an earlier version of the elm survey data and an inversion technique .",

    ", we calculate the distributions of @xmath237 , @xmath238 , and @xmath239 for each system .",
    "the results are presented in table [ tab : clean ] .",
    "the columns list the median value of each distribution ; the uncertainty comes from the 0.1587 and 0.8413 percentile values , equivalent to 1-@xmath17 uncertainties if the quantities are normally distributed .",
    "we find that the average total mass of the elm wd binaries is @xmath240 @xmath1 . statistically speaking ,",
    "95% of the elm wd binaries have a total mass below the chandrasekhar mass and thus are not type ia supernova progenitors .",
    "this is unsurprising given the mass of the elm wds .",
    "however , their short orbital periods and relatively massive binary companions yield a median gravitational wave merger time of 5.8 gyr for the sample .",
    "the outcome of the elm wd binary merger process depends in part on the stability of mass transfer .",
    "the elm wd has the largest diameter of two objects in a double - degenerate binary and thus will become the donor star , the star that will fill its roche lobe and will transfer matter to its companion when the binary evolves into contact .",
    "a clear implication of the @xmath16 distribution is that the binary components have fairly extreme mass ratios , on average @xmath227:@xmath241:@xmath242 . for this mass ratio",
    ", theorists predict that helium mass transfer rates from the donor wd should be below the rate of stable helium burning on the accretor wd @xcite",
    ". thus mass transfer should proceed stably over billion year timescales , and the elm wd binaries will become am cvn systems @xcite .",
    "however , this statement ignores an elm wd s hydrogen envelope .",
    "if the initial hydrogen mass transfer rate is super - eddington , a common envelope may form and cause the two wds to quickly merge into a single massive wd @xcite .",
    "material ejected during shell flashes may also form a common envelope and result in a merger @xcite .",
    "interestingly , a small peak around 1 @xmath1  is seen in the mass distribution of all wds within 20 pc @xcite .",
    "the same peak is also seen in the mass distribution of wds in the sdss wd catalog ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite argue that the @xmath243 @xmath1  peak in the wd mass distribution is more substantial than suggested in these earlier surveys .",
    "perhaps part of the 1 @xmath1  peak in the wd mass distribution is related to the elm wd binaries .",
    "the merger of a he+co wd should eliminate the hydrogen atmosphere and look like an extreme helium star or r  crb star @xcite . whether the elm wd binaries evolve into stable mass - transfer am cvn systems or single massive wds remains unclear , but it is fair to say that the binary mass ratio favors the am cvn outcome .",
    "we present 15 new elm wd candidates , 9 of which are double degenerate binaries .",
    "this brings our targeted elm survey sample to 88 objects and 76 double degenerate binaries .",
    "the 12 non - variable objects in the sample are puzzling , because they exceed the number of face - on binaries we expect in a randomly oriented sample .",
    "most of the non - variable objects have @xmath214,000  k , however , and so may be related to the sda stellar population uncovered by @xcite ; the remaining non - variable objects would then be consistent with the number of face - on elm wd binaries we would expect in a sample of color - selected targets .",
    "we show that the elm wd binaries have a lognormal distribution of orbital period with a median period of 5.4 hr .",
    "this median period is in agreement with expectations of binary population synthesis models @xcite .",
    "the distribution of companion mass is best described by a normal distribution with a mean of 0.76 @xmath1 .",
    "alternative distributions , such as the observed sdss wd mass distribution , fit the observations very poorly .",
    "the upshot is that the total mass of our elm wd binaries is about 1 @xmath1 , their mass ratio is about @xmath227:@xmath244:4 , and their median gravitational merger time is about 6 gyr .",
    "an open question is the outcome of elm wd binary mergers .",
    "their total mass rules out type ia supernovae .",
    "their mass ratios argue for long - lived stable mass - transfer am cvn binaries . yet",
    "a merger into a single massive wd remains a possibility .",
    "merger rates may provide a useful discriminant .",
    "binary population synthesis models predict formation rates that differ by a factor of ten for am cvn and r  crb stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
