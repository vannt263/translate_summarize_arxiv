    "the ternary rare earth family cemin@xmath0 ( m = co , ir , and rh ) are heavy fermion , unconventional superconductors : @xcite cecoin@xmath0 and ceirin@xmath0 become superconducting at ambient pressure at @xmath4@xcite and @xmath5 k@xcite , whereas the incommensurate heavy fermion antiferromagnet cerhin@xmath0 ( @xmath6 ) exhibits superconductivity under pressure ( @xmath7 gpa , @xmath8).@xcite all members of this family crystallize in the tetragonal hocoga@xmath0 structure ( space group p4/_mmm _ ) , which is derived from cubic cein@xmath9 intercalated with min@xmath10 layers along the tetragonal @xmath11 axis .",
    "the cubic compound cein@xmath9 orders antiferromagnetically at @xmath12 = 10 k and has a hybridization temperature @xmath13 of about 10 k.@xcite this temperature , which gives the energy scale of the hybridization between the local @xmath2 moments and surrounding conduction electrons , is highly pressure dependent in cemin@xmath0 compounds .",
    "it has been argued that a sufficiently strong hybridization or kondo interaction with respect to the rkky exchange interaction suppresses antiferromagnetic order to the benefit of superconductivity .",
    "@xcite general scaling behaviors of the characteristic energy scales in kondo lattice materials are a matter of intense debate,@xcite and @xmath13 has traditionally been interpreted as the temperature below which the coherence of the kondo lattice sets in .",
    "more recently @xmath13 has been suggested to be the temperature scale denoting the development of a dense `` kondo liquid '' within a `` two - fluid '' model also comprised of a `` kondo gas '' phase of uncorrelated magnetic moments at high temperatures .",
    "this characteristic temperature scale is determined with many techniques such as thermodynamic , transport , knight shift measurements , and of course , quasielastic neutron scattering @xcite .",
    "another interesting scaling has been shown by bauer _",
    "@xcite : the superconducting transition temperatures @xmath14 of the cemin@xmath0 and also of the pumga@xmath0 family vary linearly with the @xmath15 ratio of the tetragonal lattice constants , pointing towards the importance of the anisotropic electronic structure for the superconducting state .",
    "this brings into focus the importance of the spatial distribution of the crystal - field split hund s rule ground state , which is highly anisotropic for materials containing rare earth .    the hund s rule ground state of ce@xmath16 with @xmath17 splits under the influence of a tetragonal crystal - field ( point group @xmath18 ) into three kramer s doublets , which can be represented in the basis of @xmath19 .",
    "the eigenfunctions of the three kramer s doublets can be written as @xmath20 .",
    "the anisotropy of certain wave functions may give rise to @xmath2 conduction electron hybridizations which are more advantageous than others for forming a superconducting ground state.@xcite the importance of momentum dependent ( * q*-dependent ) hybridization in these and some semiconducting kondo materials has been investigated by several groups .",
    "@xcite    various groups attempted to determine the crystal - field scheme of these compounds , but there are significant discrepancies depending on the applied methods , which include bulk measurements based on transport , thermodynamic and nmr experiments.@xcite christianson et al . performed extensive inelastic neutron scattering ( ins ) studies,@xcite but phonon contributions in the energy range of the magnetic scattering , broadened crystal - field excitations due to hybridization effects and the enormous absorption of the sample s constituents make the determination of reliable magnetic intensities rather challenging .",
    "since the latter give the wave functions via the transition matrix elements the resulting wave functions should be taken with care ( see appendix ) while the transition energies are fairly sound ( see section iii b ) .",
    "we have shown for the case of the heavy fermion materials cepd@xmath10si@xmath10 and cept@xmath9si that polarization dependent soft x - ray absorption ( xas ) at the ce m@xmath3 edges can be complementary to neutron scattering in determining the ground state wave function.@xcite xas is highly sensitive to the initial state and via its polarization dependence ( _ linear dichroism _",
    "@xmath21 ) direct information about the @xmath19 admixtures of the ground state wave function can be obtained .",
    "sensitivity to higher lying crystal - field states is achieved by thermally populating those states.@xcite    we present a combined inelastic neutron scattering and soft x - ray absorption study on the cemin@xmath0 m = co , ir , and rh compounds . combining both techniques",
    "has the advantage of determining transition energies and mixing parameters independently , each with the most suitable technique .",
    "the line positions in the magnetic contributions of the ins data yield the crystal - field transition energies within mev resolution , whereas the ld in xas , when performed at temperatures where only the ground state is populated , yields the ground state wave function , i.e. in case of a mixed ground state the mixing factor @xmath22 ( see eq .",
    "( 1 ) ) within @xmath23 = @xmath24 . in the limit of small crystal - field splittings",
    "the dichroic signal of the ground state is independent of crystal - field energies .",
    "once the ground state has been determined , the order of states can be determined from the temperature dependence of the ld since at finite temperatures it reflects the superposition of polarizations from each populated state , i.e. here the crystal - field energies , as determined from the neutron scattering experiment , enter via the thermal population .",
    "in addition , high - resolution ins data are presented to determine the characteristic temperature t@xmath1 for the _",
    "4f _ conduction electron hybridization via the quasielastic line width .",
    "the latter has been applied successfully by several authors.@xcite",
    "the high quality single crystals of cemin@xmath0 for the x - ray experiments were grown with the flux - growth method @xcite .",
    "the powder samples for the present ins experiments were the same samples as used by christianson _ _ et al.__@xcite .",
    "the xas spectra were recorded during various beam times at the two different synchrotron light sources bessy ii and nsrrc .",
    "we recorded all spectra with the total electron yield method ( tey ) and under uhv , i.e. in a chamber with a pressure in the 10@xmath25 mbar range .",
    "clean sample surfaces were obtained by cleaving the samples _ in situ_. at bessy ii we used the ue46 pgm-1 undulator beam line . the total electron yield ( tey )",
    "signal was normalized to the incoming photon flux @xmath26 as measured at the refocusing mirror .",
    "the energy resolution at the cerium @xmath27 edges ( @xmath28 ev ) was set to 0.15 ev .",
    "the undulator combined with a normal incident measurement geometry allow for a change of polarization without changing the probed spot on the sample surface .",
    "the two polarizations were @xmath29 and @xmath30 , @xmath11 being the long tetragonal axis . at the nsrrc we performed the experiment at the dragon dipole beam line .",
    "the energy resolution at the cerium @xmath27 edges was set to 0.4 ev .",
    "the crystals were mounted with the @xmath11-axis perpendicular to the poynting vector of the light . by rotating the sample around this poynting vector ,",
    "the polarization of the electric field can be varied continuously from @xmath29 to @xmath30 .",
    "for all measurements the sample was rotated 4 times by 90@xmath31 , so that for each orientation @xmath29 and @xmath30 two equivalent positions were measured .",
    "thus for both experimental end stations a reliable comparison of the spectral line shapes is guaranteed .",
    "we measured several crystals and/or recleaved in order to assure the reproducibility of the spectra ( see table 1 ) .    to calculate the xas spectra we performed ionic full multiplet calculations using the xtls 8.3 program@xcite .",
    "all atomic parameters are given by hartree - fock values , with a reduction of about 40% for the @xmath32 coulomb interactions and about 20% for the @xmath33 interactions to reproduce best the experimental isotropic spectra , @xmath34 .",
    "these values compare well with our findings for other heavy fermion compounds @xcite and account for the configuration interaction effects not included in the hartree - fock scheme .",
    "once the atomic parameters are fine tuned to the isotropic spectra , the polarized xas data can be described by the incoherent sums of the respective polarization dependent spectra of the pure @xmath19 states @xcite as long as the crystal - field splitting @xmath35 is small with respect to the spin orbit splitting @xmath36 .",
    "the latter requirement , which is fulfilled here ( @xmath36 @xmath37 280  mev and @xmath35 @xmath38 30  mev ) , assures that interference terms resulting from intermixing of the @xmath17 and @xmath39 multiplet can be neglected .    , ceirin@xmath0 , and cecoin@xmath0 at the ce@xmath16 m@xmath3 edges .",

    "the latter has been verified with the knowledge of the crystal - field energies ( see table 2 ) .",
    "for cecoin@xmath0 the linear dichroism ( ld ) is smallest , but has an opposite sign with respect to ceirin@xmath0 and cerhin@xmath0 .",
    "cerhin@xmath0 has the largest ld .",
    "figure [ lowt ] shows further the simulations based on a full multiplet treatment as described in the experimental section ( dotted lines ) . for cecoin@xmath0",
    "we find from our full multiplet calculation @xmath41 .",
    "this value is just below the zero polarization for @xmath42 where the ld vanishes when it changes sign . for ceirin@xmath0 and cerhin@xmath0",
    "we obtain @xmath43 and @xmath44 , respectively .",
    "the resulting ground state wave functions , with an arbitrarily chosen phase , are : @xmath45the orbitals shown in figure [ lowt ] show the spatial distributions of the @xmath2 electrons for the respective crystal - field ground states .",
    "the higher the @xmath46 contribution to the ground state the flatter the @xmath2 distribution , i.e. cerhin@xmath0 , which does not become superconducting at ambient pressure , has the flattest @xmath2 orbital .",
    "the pure @xmath46 orbital is donut and the pure @xmath47 is yo - yo shaped ( see e.g. willers _ _",
    "et al.__@xcite ) .",
    "the general trend of a decreasing @xmath46 contribution to the ground state from m = rh , ir to co agrees with the ins findings by refs .",
    "but we observe smaller @xmath46 contributions ( note : @xmath48 = @xmath49 as given by christianson _",
    "et al . _ ) .",
    "this is most likely due to systematic errors in the phonon correction of the ins neutron data ( see appendix ) .",

    "the blue triangles are the total scattering .",
    "the data of the la samples show that there is only little phonon scattering for 20 mev incident energy .",
    "it has nevertheless been corrected for ( method 2 ) in order to determine the magnetic scattering in the cerium data .",

    "the red circles are the pure magnetic scattering in the low angle banks , resulting from subtracting the scaled phonon intensities ( black lines ) from the total scattering ( blue triangles ) .",
    "all three compounds exhibit two magnetic ground state excitations at about 5 - 7 and 24 - 30  mev .",
    "the low energy one ( cf1 ) is best resolved in the 20 mev data while the 60 mev data show both excitations ( cf1 and cf2 ) .",
    "the quasielastic scattering can not be resolved with these thermal measurements .",
    "the inelastic , magnetic excitations have been described with two inelastic lorentzians .",
    "the crystal - field transitions are fairly sharp in cerhin@xmath0 but much broader for ceirin@xmath0 and cecoin@xmath0 , leading to considerable error bars in the line widths and position .",
    "the 60  mev data are described with two inelastic lorentzians of same widths , but only the parameters of the higher energy excitations were freely varied , position and width of the low energy excitations have been determined from the 20  mev data .",
    "we can state that the excitations broaden from m = rh to ir and co , consistent with the expected increase in the electronic specific heat coefficient @xmath55 from rh to ir to co. table 2 gives the summary of all parameters .",
    "in the @xmath53 = 60 mev data phonon and magnetic scattering are very much intermixed , the line widths are broad and we know from the non - magnetic reference samples that there is a substantial error in not taking out enough phonon scattering below 10 mev , i.e. in the range of the lower crystal - field excitation ( this is explained in the appendix , see figure [ y - la_60mev ] ) . we know further that the fine structure of the phonon scattering is not ideally represented by the @xmath54 scaled high angle data ( see appendix , right hand panel of figure [ y - la_60mev ] ) .",
    "hence we do not attempt to determine magnetic intensities to obtain transition matrix elements .",
    "the magnetic signal is nevertheless strong enough to determine the crystal - field energies fairly well , irrespective of the method of phonon correction as can be seen from the fact that we obtain similar line positions as christianson et al . who applied some extra scaling factor for the phonon correction in addition to the one found from the la samples ( compare appendix with refs .",
    "however , for ceirin@xmath0 christianson et al . can only state that the low lying crystal - field state must be some where between 0 and 7 mev .",
    "our neutron data show , due to the better flux and resolution , that the level is located between 5.2 @xmath56 1 mev ( see figure  [ hetdata ] e ) ) .",
    "this is supported by the fact that the polarization effect of the xas data increases from 20 to 80 k ( see section c , figure  [ allt ] ) , i.e. when the thermal occupation of the first excited state takes place , before it decreases again due to the beginning population of the second excited state .",
    "we find narrower line widths and we find that the width of the spectra increases in the sequence m = rh to ir and becomes broadest for co in contrast to refs . .",
    "we believe that this is due to the better signal to noise ratio of the present data . while we do not consider the quality of the magnetic intensities to be sufficiently accurate to determine the wave functions properly from these data , we agree with christianson @xmath57 that general intensity considerations based on the selection rule @xmath58 = @xmath561 lead to the conclusion that the @xmath46 contribution to the ground state decreases from rh to ir and co , that is in agreement with our low temperature xas data .",
    "we conclude further from the intensity ratios , as chrstianson @xmath57 , that the second excited state is the pure @xmath59 in all compounds .",
    "the same set of data was taken at t = 120  k ( not shown here ) where we would expect to see the transition from the first @xmath60 to the second @xmath61 excited state at @xmath62-@xmath63 , but we do not resolve another peak .",
    "however , it should be noted that at 120  k the phonon correction is more important with respect to 5  k while the magnetic lines are broader .",
    "in addition , this third transition is weaker than the two ground state excitations .         with m = rh , ir and co , ( at 20 k ) and of ceau@xmath10si@xmath10 ( at 40 k ) for comparison .",
    "all spectra were recorded under the same beam line conditions at the nsrrc . in the right panel are blow - up graphs with arrows pointing out the @xmath64 initial state contributions . ]      when analyzing the temperature dependence of the polarization dependent xas data we will only show the @xmath65 edge for clarity .",
    "figure [ allt ] shows the temperature dependence of the ld for all three cerium compounds . for each compound the measured data and corresponding simulations are shown .",
    "for cerhin@xmath0 the ld in the experimental data increases slightly from 18 to 80 k indicating the population of the first excited crystal - field level and then decreases with further rising temperature due to population of the next state .",
    "when all states are equally populated the polarization should vanish entirely since a equal occupation resembles the fully degenerate hund s rule ground state which has spherical symmetry . to the right of the measured data the simulated xas spectra",
    "are shown .",
    "there , the crystal - field energies as determined in the neutron experiment and the mixing factor @xmath66 as obtained from the low temperature xas data are used as input parameters .",
    "the @xmath59 has been assumed to be the highest lying crystal - field level and only the population of states has been adapted to the corresponding temperature .",
    "the simulation reproduces well the trend of the temperature dependence of the ld , i.e. it increases at first and then decreases above 80 k with further rising temperature .",
    "the assumption of a different order of states would lead to a change of sign in the polarization for increasing @xmath67 , which is in contradiction to the observation and can therefore be excluded .",
    "the other panels of figure [ allt ] show the same set of spectra for ceirin@xmath0 and cecoin@xmath0 .",
    "for ceirin@xmath0 we observe very much the same effect as for cerhin@xmath0 and we are able to simulate the general trend of the temperature dependence in the same manner . for cecoin@xmath0",
    "the temperature dependence seems different , but is based on the same effect , namely occupation of the next higher states : the low temperature polarization has a different sign with respect to m= rh and ir ( see section * a * ) so that here the occupation of the first excited state leads to a decrease of polarization with rising temperature and a change of sign between 50 and 80 k. then the ld increases at first with further rising temperature and starts to decreases again above 180 k. here too we are able to simulate this temperature trend under the assumption that the @xmath59 is the highest lying crystal - field state . for m = co , the assumption of a different order of states would not give rise to a change of sign in the polarization as function of temperature .",
    "this analysis of the temperature dependence is analogous to our previous results on cept@xmath9si.@xcite ground state , energy splittings , and order of states describe the crystal - field potential fully and the corresponding crystal - field parameters ( in stevens formalism ) are listed in table 2 . while the temperature dependence of the ld is qualitatively reproduced with our simulations , there is also some quantitative deviation : at high temperatures the measured ld is always smaller than the simulated one .",
    "we exclude depolarization effects due to a ) surface degrading and/or b ) polycrystalline contributions .",
    "possibility a ) can be excluded since we recleaved and repeated the measurements to assure reproducibility ( see table 1 ) and we exclude b ) since it would require an unrealistic 35% of polycrystalline contribution in order to account for the mismatch in e.g. the co data at 280 k. more physical and interesting is to consider kondo interactions : they will have a depolarizing effect too .",
    "the hybridization of the @xmath68 state with the surrounding conduction band has not been considered in the present analysis of the xas data . yet",
    ", the existence of the latter can be seen from the @xmath64 initial state satellites at the high energy tails of the m@xmath3 edges .",
    "figure  [ isotrope ] shows the isotropic spectra and the tails of the m@xmath3 edges on a blown - up scale for the cemin@xmath0 compounds and in comparison for ceau@xmath10si@xmath10 .",
    "the arrows in figure  [ isotrope ] indicate the position of the @xmath69 spectral weight .",
    "ceau@xmath10si@xmath10 is an antiferromagnet with a small hybridization temperature ( @xmath70 k)@xcite and with a good agreement of simulated and measured xas data at all temperatures @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that the @xmath64 spectral weight is basically non - existent in ceau@xmath10si@xmath10 , but stronger in the cerhin@xmath0 data and again more pronounced for ceirin@xmath0 and cecoin@xmath0 . in the same sequence",
    "the inelastic line widths in the ins spectra and the deviation between simulated and measured spectra increase .",
    "we speculate that hybridization effects , which are not yet included in the calculation , may be responsible for these quantitative discrepancies .",
    "it is desirable that further theoretical work be carried out , using for instance the anderson impurity model , to find out how much the cf wave functions are modifed from our present estimates .",
    "we nevertheless expect that these modifications are very modest for the cerhin5 since the @xmath69 weight in the ground state is minimal .",
    "we may even speculate that the corrections are also small for the cecoin@xmath0 and ceirin@xmath0 in view of the special condition that the crystal - field ground state wave function is very close to cubic , i.e. almost isotropic .",
    "figure  [ in6 ] shows high resolution inelastic neutron scattering data of cemin@xmath0 m = rh , ir and co , taken with in6 at ill with e@xmath71 = 3.1 mev incident energy at 1.5 , 8 , and 75 k. the blue triangles ( pointing down ) are the total scattering from the cerium samples .",
    "we further show the scattering from lairin@xmath0 at 75 k ( see black triangles pointing up in the 1.5 and 75 k cerhin@xmath0 spectra ) in order to verify that the phonon scattering is negligible at these temperatures in this energy window . at 1.5 k cerhin@xmath0",
    "is magnetically ordered ( t@xmath72=3.8  k ) and the scattering function exhibits in addition to the elastic line ( incoherent , elastic , nuclear scattering ) some magnon density of states which peaks at about 1.7 mev . at 8  k the spectrum consists mainly of quasielastic scattering , which is well described with a quasielastic lorentzian with hwhm @xmath73/2 = 1.2  ( @xmath560.1)mev .",
    "note , that for @xmath74 a quasielastic lorentzian appears highly asymmetric in energy @xcite .",
    "the crystal - field excitation cf1 contributes only little in this energy window but has nevertheless been taken into account according to the crystal - field model ( see green line ) .",
    "a quasielastic line width of @xmath73/2 = 1.2  ( @xmath560.1 )  mev corresponds with @xmath75 = k@xmath76 t to t@xmath1  @xmath37  14  ( @xmath561 )  k. at 1.5 and 8 k the scattering intensity for cecoin@xmath0 and ceirin@xmath0 is considerably lower with respect to cerhin@xmath0 , but not zero , so that we conclude the quasielastic lines are broader and peaked outside the energy window available at low temperatures .",
    "it should be mentioned that although cecoin@xmath0 is in the superconducting phase at 1.5 k , we did not observe the spin resonance at 0.6  mev @xcite , most likely because this resonance is fairly sharp in reciprocal space whereas the present data are averaged over all @xmath54 .    before discussing the cecoin@xmath0 and ceirin@xmath0 data at 1.5 and 8 k data in more detail , we look at the high resolution spectra at 75 k ( right hand panel of figure  [ in6 ] ) . here",
    "the energy window is larger due to population of states on the neutron energy gain side .",
    "thanks to population and resolution the quasielastic scattering and the low lying crystal - field excitation can be observed simultaneously in the same energy window .",
    "the black triangles in the cerhin@xmath0 spectrum are the scattering from lairin@xmath0 at 75 k. since it is almost negligible we will not consider it when describing the cerium data . for cerhin@xmath0 quasi- and inelastic scattering",
    "are well resolved while for ceirin@xmath0 and cecoin@xmath0 the spectra are broader so that it is difficult to separate the two .",
    "we fit the data with the crystal field model , i.e. keep the intensity ratios of quasi- and inelastic lines as well as the line positions fixed ( see parameters in table 2 ) .",
    "thus only the line widths and an overall intensity parameter were varied .",
    "the latter is necessary although we scaled to absolute intensities , most likely since the absorption corrections are so large .",
    "the data are well described with our crystal - field parameters , the resulting quasi- and inelastic line widths at 75 k are listed in table 2 .",
    "we return to the 8 k data in order to give an estimate for the quasielastic line widths of cecoin@xmath0 and ceirin@xmath0 .",
    "the quasielastic intensity at 8 k is scattering from the crystal - field ground state which is proportional to the square of the transition matrix element .",
    "the ground state of each compound is know from the low temperature xas data , hence we know the respective matrix elements of the quasielastic scattering .",
    "we further know the relative scaling factor of the data from the 75 k spectra .",
    "for cerhin@xmath0 the quasileastic width and intensity can easily be fitted .",
    "knowing scaling factors and matrix elements allows us then to estimate the line widths of the co and ir samples at 8 k ( middle columns of figure  [ in6 ] ) .",
    "we use the widths at 75 k as a crude guess for the quasielastic line widths of cecoin@xmath0 and ceirin@xmath0 at 8 k and take into account the inelastic scattering according to the crystal - field model .",
    "the red lines are the result .",
    "the agreement is reasonable so that we give the following values for the corresponding coherence temperatures t@xmath1 : @xmath77",
    "the hybridization temperatures t@xmath1 as determined from the present neutron scattering experiments are smallest for cerhin@xmath0 and largest for cecoin@xmath0 in agreement with the increasing spectral weight of the @xmath69 contribution to the xas spectra .",
    "the values we find from neutron scattering agree well with temperatures below which fermi liquid behaviour sets in : the anomalous hall effect below 20 k for cerhin@xmath0 , 31 k for ceirin@xmath0 , 53 k for cecoin@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "knight shift experiments give 10 - 12 k for cerhin@xmath0 , and for cecoin@xmath0 42 k for in plane and 89 - 95 k for out of plane , i.e. a powder averaged value of about 58 k @xcite .",

    "a summary of values and references can be found in the supplementary information of ref . .",
    "cerhin@xmath0 is the most localized member of this family .",
    "the hybridization temperature of cerhin@xmath0 compares with those of other heavy fermion materials like cecu@xmath10si@xmath10 ( t@xmath1 @xmath37 10 k ) @xcite , ceru@xmath10si@xmath10 ( t@xmath1 @xmath37 10 k ) @xcite , and with the ones of the antiferromagnetic compounds cepd@xmath10si@xmath10 ( t@xmath1 = 10 k , t@xmath72 = 8 k)@xcite and the cubic parent compound cein@xmath9 ( t@xmath1 @xmath37 10 k , t@xmath72 = 10 k)@xcite . with the exception of ceru@xmath10si@xmath10 all these compounds , exhibit superconductivity : cecu@xmath10si@xmath10 at ambient pressure depending on sample stoichiometry , or cerhin@xmath0 , cepd@xmath10si@xmath10 and cein@xmath9 with an applied pressure of 1.6 gpa and about 2.5 gpa for the latter two@xcite .",
    "it is intriguing that for ceau@xmath10si@xmath10 , which also orders antiferromagnetically at t@xmath72 @xmath37 10 k but has a much smaller hybridization temperature of t@xmath1 = 1.5 k@xcite , no superconductivity has been reported up to 17 gpa @xcite .",
    "since pressure on the cerium ion increases delocalisation , these findings underline the idea that sufficient kondo screening favors superconductivity to the detriment of antiferromagnetic order @xcite . for ceirin@xmath0 and cecoin@xmath0 where the hybridization temperatures are larger the kondo screening seems to be sufficiently large so that superconductivity can develop at ambient pressure . here the larger hybridization temperature of cecoin@xmath0 ( t@xmath79 = 2.3 k ) with respect and ceirin@xmath0 ( t@xmath79 = 0.4 k ) goes along with a higher superconducting transition temperature .",
    "there is another aspect which makes ceirin@xmath0 and cecoin@xmath0 remarkable .",
    "they are rare examples for compounds where the hybridization temperature t@xmath1 is similar in magntitude to the size of the ( low lying ) crystal - field splitting .",
    "one may speculate that this should have an effect on the degeneracies involved when describing ground state properties .",
    "along with the increasing hybridization from m = rh , via ir to co goes a decrease of the @xmath46 contribution to the ground state . cerhin@xmath0 which has the flattest @xmath2 orbital ( see orbitals in figure 2 ) does not become superconducting at ambient pressure and it does not appear in the t@xmath79 versus @xmath15 scaling plot as suggested by pagliuso@xcite , although its @xmath15 ratio is in between the values of ceirin@xmath0 and cecoin@xmath0 .",
    "the ceir@xmath80rh@xmath81in@xmath0 and ceco@xmath80rh@xmath81in@xmath0 systems , however , exhibit superconductivity and fit into this @xmath15 scaling .",
    "it would be interesting to see where , in a similar scaling of t@xmath79 with the @xmath2 wave functions , the ceir@xmath80rh@xmath81in@xmath0 and ceco@xmath80rh@xmath81in@xmath0 would fit .",
    "since the crystal - field energies do not vary much from sample to sample it would be sufficient to determine the ground state wave functions with linear polarized xas at low temperatures .",
    "we have determined the hybridization temperatures t@xmath1 and crystal - field schemes of cemin@xmath0 m = rh , ir and co with inelastic neutron scattering and polarized soft x - ray absorption .",
    "the hybridization temperatures t@xmath1 as determined from the line widths of the inelastic neutron data increase from m = rh to ir , and are largest for co which supports the idea that increasing kondo interaction favours superconductivity while preventing long range magnetic order .",
    "the hybridization temperature of cerhin@xmath0 , the most localized member of the family , is comparable to the ceru@xmath10si@xmath10 and cecu@xmath10si@xmath10 . for ceirin@xmath0 and cecoin@xmath0",
    "the energy scale of the @xmath2 conduction electron interaction is of the order of the energy of the low lying crystal - field excitation , which may have an impact on the ground state degeneracy and/or properties .",
    "our finding of the crystal - field schemes is coherent with previous work by christianson _",
    "@xcite but we can give more precise values for the ground state wave functions from our xas data .",
    "we find that the @xmath82 contribution to the ground state is largest(smallest ) for cerhin@xmath0 ( cecoin@xmath0 ) so that cerhin@xmath0 has the flattest @xmath2 orbital .     and lairin@xmath0 .",
    "_ left _ : high and low angle data at 5 k. _ right _ : 5 k low angle data shown on an expanded intensity scale and scaled ( @xmath83 ) high angle data .",
    "_ bottom right _ : the red squares are the same low angle data taken at 280 k. the orange line represents the 5 k data scaled to 250 k with the bose factor . ]",
    "a single phonon scattering process increases with momentum transfer @xmath54 as @xmath84 and magnetic scattering decreases with the magnetic form factor of the magnetic ion .",
    "phonon scattering follows bose and the occupation of crystal - field states is according to boltzmann statistics .",
    "we shall now discuss the two ways of separating magnetic and phonon scattering : 1 ) subtraction of the high  @xmath54 data from the low  @xmath54 data after scaling the high  @xmath54 data with a scaling factor @xmath85 which has been determined with a non - magnetic reference compound@xcite and 2 ) subtraction of @xmath86 of a non - magnetic reference which has been scaled by the average scattering cross - section .",
    "method 1 ) : since we group angles and not momentum transfers @xmath54 we will determine the scaling factor for high to low scattering angles @xmath87 and not for @xmath54 .",
    "the left hand panel of figure  [ y - la_60mev ] shows @xmath88 ) of ycoin@xmath0 and lairin@xmath0 for 60 mev incident energy for large scattering angles @xmath89 = 135@xmath52 as black triangles ( pointing up ) and small scattering angles @xmath89 = 19@xmath90 as blue triangles ( pointing down ) .",
    "all scattering of these non - magnetic samples is of phonon origin so that a phonon scaling factor @xmath85 from large to small scattering angles can be determined .",
    "empirically we find for both non - magnetic samples that the high angle intensities scale to the low angle ones with a factor of @xmath85 = 1/8 .",
    "the quality of this scaling is shown in the right hand panel of figure  [ y - la_60mev ] .",
    "the blue triangles ( pointing down ) are again the low angle scattering , now shown on an expanded intensity scale and the black line is the high angle scattering scaled by @xmath85 = 1/8 . while the overall intensity is well described , the low angle phonon scattering below 10 mev is under estimated by such a scaling and the fine structure of the low angle phonon scattering above 10 mev is not so well reproduced .",
    "method 2 ) : next we check method 2 by scaling the two non - magnetic reference compounds to each other with the averaged nuclear cross - section , again for grouped angles .",
    "the ratio of the averaged nuclear cross - sections of ycoin@xmath0 and lairin@xmath0 is 1.37 . for large scattering angles the 60  mev data seem to scale rather well with this value ; we find a scaling factor of 1.3 .",
    "however , for small scattering angles they do not . here we find that the two non - magnetic data sets scale best with a factor of 1.1 .",
    "this deviation is probably due to multiple scattering which seems stronger in the forward detectors .",
    "this finding makes this type of scaling some what arbitrary for the magnetic samples unless a detailed phonon simulation and multiple scattering calculation is performed .",
    "another obstacle of method 2 ) can be that often the non - magnetic reference samples are only measured at base temperature and the higher temperatures are obtained from bose scaling .",
    "the bottom right panel of figure  [ y - la_60mev ] shows that this can be traitorous : ycoin@xmath0 was measured at 5 ( triangles ) and 250  k ( circles ) .",
    "scaling the scattering function @xmath91 at 5  k to 250  k with the bose factor [ @xmath92 and @xmath93 ] gives the orange line which highly overestimates the actual scattering at 250  k. the bose scaling does of course not take into account multiple phonon processes .",
    "we therefore discard the direct subtraction method for the phonon correction of the 60 mev data and rather apply the high to low @xmath54 or large to small scattering angle @xmath87 scaling",
    ". however , for the 20 mev data which exhibit very little phonon scattering in the forward detectors ( see left column of figure  [ hetdata ] ) the cross - section scaling looks fine and we correct the 20  mev data by subtracting the data of the cross - section scaled non - magnetic reference samples since the high angle data of the 20  mev data contain still a non - negligible amount of magnetic scattering due to the smaller @xmath54 values .",
