    "since the discovery of hawking radiation @xcite , there has been a growing interest on the close relation between gravity and thermodynamics . in particular , the black hole entropy problem , whether or not black hole entropy can be explained statistically has attracted much attention because it is hoped that the statistical explanation may shed light on the way to quantize gravity .",
    "in fact recent development in string theoretical explanation for black hole entropy @xcite is regarded as the indication that string theory may be an integral ingredient of quantum gravity .",
    "although these development excites us , it raises at the same time an uneasy feeling how can quantum gravity plays such an essential role in understanding entropy of a black hole .",
    "this is because the entropy is associated with any size of black hole whose gravity is very week .",
    "also , we note that such an exact explanation is only successful so far for bps black hole .",
    "thus it seems us to be also important to think about other possibilities to explain entropy statistically from field theoretical view point",
    ".    there has been various attempts in this direction , but all of them so far considered a classical black hole which is not in thermal equilibrium with radiation .",
    "for example york has attempted to solve this problem by counting quasi - normal modes in quantum ergo - region @xcite .",
    "although the approach is very interesting , thermal nature of the black hole is put in by hand and some details are left unexplained partly because of the difficulty associated with the complexity in four dimensional gravity , namely there is no hope to have a realistic solution in some sort of theory of quantum gravity expressing a black hole in thermal equilibrium with radiation",
    ".    there might be something important missing if we are not paying any special attention to the situation where a radiating black hole is in thermal equilibrium with incoming radiation .",
    "therefore it seems urgent to examine carefully the entropy of a black hole in thermal equilibrium from field theoretical view point before withdrawing any conclusion .",
    "this is main motivation of this paper .",
    "here we shall follow in spirit york s approach to the problem , but with two different settings .",
    "one is that we consider two - dimensional dilaton gravity because of its simplicity instead of einstein gravity .",
    "we hope this will not much make the problem unrealistic because it has been shown that two - dimensional gravity shows many common feature with einstein gravity on black hole formation and hawking radiation @xcite .",
    "second is we consider the entropy of a quantum black hole in the sense that it is in thermal equilibrium with radiation .",
    "as stressed above such setting seems more appropriate to think about thermodynamical quantities like entropy .",
    "thus we consider thermal fluctuation around a quantum black hole in two dimensional dilaton gravity and if there are some kind of ( quasi- ) stable modes which could contribute to its entropy .    to avoid any confusion ,",
    "we make clear our situation here .",
    "we mean by a quantum black hole as a static configuration in a pure state defined by an effective action including quantum effect .",
    "then the quantum black hole is supposed to be in equilibrium with a thermal bath .",
    "thus we concern the thermal state and the thermal fluctuation will be inevitably present . in our paper the word `` fluctuation '' is always used in this sense .",
    "actually the above program has been carried out by the present authors for investigating the dynamical instability of the quantum black hole in lowe s model @xcite . there",
    "it is found that the fluctuation obeys the wave equation with a negative definite potential and thus such a black hole is unstable .",
    "this does not mean that quantum black holes in any two - dimensional models are unstable .",
    "this is because the dilaton gravity in two dimensions does not have a unique action and there exist an infinite number of variations of the models .",
    "thus it may well be other models in which the potential for the fluctuation behaves totally different such that quasi - stable modes exit between its positive peaks .",
    "what we would like to show is that this is actually the case . for this purpose",
    "we need a general model of two - dimensional dilaton gravity which admit a family of static black hole solution with regular horizon .",
    "fortunately for classical dilaton gravity models this is provided by some of the present authors @xcite .",
    "they have given a prescription to construct all such dilaton gravity models containing at most second derivatives of the fields in the action .",
    "we shall extend their formalism into quantum models and carry out the above program .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we shall give a brief review of our general prescription how to construct a quantum black hole solution in general two - dimensional dilaton gravity . here",
    "the previous studies play essential roles @xcite .",
    "some details of calculation are found in appendix a. in section 3 the equation for the fluctuation is obtained by perturbing the solution obtained in the previous section .",
    "calculational details are found in appendices b and c. in section 4 we shall propose new type models in which quasi - bounded modes are present .",
    "namely we will find a model in which the potential for the fluctuation has double peaks .",
    "some discussions are devoted in section 5 where we shall also summarize our results . in appendix",
    "d we will apply the present formalism to the problem of dynamical instability of a black hole @xcite . there",
    "the solvable models are discussed in some detail .",
    "in particular we will find rst model @xcite is dynamically stable .",
    "+ in this section we shall give a brief review of how to construct a quantum black hole solution in general two - dimensional dilaton gravity .",
    "more detailed discussion can be seen in the appendix a.    we consider the following action which includes only second derivative terms , the dilatonic cosmological term and back reaction term .",
    "@xmath3 here , @xmath4 is the determinant of the two - dimensional metric , @xmath5 is the dilaton field .",
    "@xmath6 is related to the number of matter fields @xmath7 , such as @xmath8 .",
    "the back reaction term is obtained from integrating out the fluctuation in massless matter fields in the same way as the cghs model @xcite .",

    "although the back reaction term in the action ( [ action ] ) is derived in the large @xmath6-limit , such an expression for the potential make sense because the term proportional to @xmath6 is relatively small when mass of black hole become large .",

    "in this section we propose new models in which quasi - bounded modes are found .",
    "the basic idea is as follows . there may be a large region of @xmath64 space where the model which is specified by @xmath65 and @xmath10 has positive potential defined by ( [ potinf ] ) with some peaks .",
    "these peaks are located at a distance of about @xmath66 from the black hole .",
    "the potential is made by the fluctuations of matter fields which are inevitably present in thermal equilibrium through the quantum back reaction .",
    "then the thermal fluctuation of the radiation may be confined into the regions surrounded by these peaks .",
    "such quasi - trapped modes are neither growing nor decaying when black hole is in thermal equilibrium .",
    "thus it can be seen from the distant observer as if the black hole may be surrounded by these modes and we can think that they contribute to the black hole entropy .",
    "now , we show one of such new models . for simplicity , we will give a model which has two potential peaks .",
    "we note that there are models in which the potential has many peaks and such models are not rare .",
    "first we take black hole field such as @xmath67 }             + 0.032 \\frac{e^{2 \\lambda ( r+1.5)}}{1+e^{2 \\lambda ( r+1.5)}}. \\label{rho }              \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] ( see figure 1 . ) one can easily confirm that this satisfies the condition ( [ rhosbc ] ) .",
    "then from the equation ( [ fseq ] ) , we can solve @xmath24 numerically and which is positive definite .",
    "we show @xmath68 in figure 2 .",
    "this shows that the model which has above black hole field really exists .",
    "the potential can then be calculated numerically by the equation ( [ potinf ] ) and is shown in figure 3 .",
    "this potential has in fact two peaks . from this potential",
    ", we can find the quasi - bounded modes by solving the equation ( [ wave ] ) numerically .",
    "now let s discuss the relation between the black hole mass @xmath58 and the number of quasi - bounded modes .",
    "here we consider the potential to the leading order of @xmath6 ( see figure 4 ) . to estimate the number of modes confined between the peaks",
    ", we consider the area between these peaks . the equation ( [ potinlarge ] ) may be used to examine the behavior of the potential in black hole with various mass @xmath58 . here",
    "we consider two cases . in one case",
    "the cosmological term @xmath66 retain its value when @xmath58 increase ( figure 5 ) . in the other @xmath66 scales as @xmath69 which is expected in a four dimensional black hole case ( figure 6 ) .",
    "it can be seen that in both cases the horizon erode away the potential more and more as @xmath58 becomes larger .",
    "for example , in figure 5 the left hand side potential peak becomes smaller in height when @xmath58 becomes larger , and beyond a certain value of mass the peak disappears .",
    "then the ( quasi- ) bounded modes confined between these peaks must vanish .",
    "thus the area between the peaks of the potential tends to decrease when @xmath58 is increased .",
    "since the entropy is expected to increase as the mass of black hole , this behavior suggests that the freedoms associated with the quasi - bounded modes may not contribute to the ordinary black hole entropy . we might call them an additional thermal hair .",
    "it is very interesting to see if these thermal hair has something to do with information paradox in black hole evaporation @xcite .",
    "in this section we devote summary and some discussions .",
    "we have investigated the possibility of explaining the black hole entropy statistically by quasi - bounded modes of thermal fluctuation of black hole space time .",
    "we consider the black hole in thermal equilibrium with the hawking radiation and it is natural situation to think about black hole entropy . we have found the following result .",
    "the fluctuation obeys wave equation with a potential which is near the black hole and is caused by quantum effect .",
    "there are many models in which the potential has positive peaks and quai - bounded modes exist between these peaks .",
    "these modes are confined near the black hole .",
    "thus they may contribute to the black hole entropy .",
    "but ordinary area law is not found , therefore we conclude that the entropy related with these modes is not ordinary black hole entropy .",
    "we can identify them as an additional thermal hair .",
    "our result suggests that the black hole entropy problem is not settled down at all and actually the situation becomes more difficult .",
    "finally , we note that there is a possibility to have ordinary entropy from quasi - bound modes discussed above .",
    "we have shown that the potential is eroded by the horizon when black hole mass becomes large in the previous section .",
    "this is understood by the behavior of @xmath25 and the equation ( [ rh ] ) .    however , there is a difference between two cases , in one case @xmath66 is not scaled with mass , and in the other case @xmath66 is scaled with mass . in the latter case",
    "the potential is more stretched in width than in the former case .",
    "thus we may have a model in which there are some potential peaks which are stretched in width and are not eroded by the horizon even if the mass becomes large .",
    "then the number of the quasi - bounded modes increase as black hole mass .",
    "this will remain as a future work .",
    "in this section we will discuss the way to determine @xmath24 from gravity field @xmath25 up to integral constants and derive the equation ( [ fseq ] ) .",
