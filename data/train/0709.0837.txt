    "the basic logic of a factorization system @xmath1 on a finitely complete category @xmath2 has been known for a long time : it gives rise to a ( variant of ) elementary existential doctrine with the comprehension scheme ( see @xcite and  @xcite ) ; or , otherwise stated , to a subfibration of the codomain fibration on @xmath2 , which is itself a bifibration . indeed , substitution @xmath3 along @xmath4 is given by pullbacks , and since the category @xmath5 of predicates over @xmath6 is a reflective full subcategory of @xmath7 : @xmath8 the existential quantification @xmath9 can be obtained as @xmath10 .",
    "in particular , the doctrine associated to the comprehensive factorization system @xmath11 ( where truth values are sets and existential quantification corresponds to kan extensions ) was among the instances of hyperdoctrine in  @xcite and  @xcite . the comprehensive factorization system itself was made explicit in  @xcite .",
    "( we here consider the dual choice : @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the classes of final functors and discrete fibrations , rather than initial functors and discrete opfibrations ) .",
    "about at the same time , the relevance of the omprehension adjunction \" @xmath14 in the calculus of colimits was shown thoroughly in  @xcite . by developing further these items in recent years ( see  @xcite ) ,",
    "it became clear that several categorical properties rest on the above reflection , that is on the comprehensive factorization system .",
    "in fact , in the present paper we will show how some of these properties , when properly formulated , _",
    "depend only on the general logic of factorization systems_.    so , category theory has a kernel which can be developed in any @xmath1-category @xmath2 , that is in any finitely complete category with a factorization system on it .",
    "however , in general the objects of @xmath2 do not yet deserve to be called categories : in order to consider @xmath2 a ategory of categories `` we should assume at least an rrow object '' as in section  [ ar ] ( see also below ) .    on the contrary , other axioms on @xmath2 ( see section  [ top ] ) would lead to consider it rather as a category of opological spaces `` , including some kind of nfinitesimal '' objects .",
    "( the term pace \" is in some respects inadequate : for instance , although a right adjoint to the inclusion @xmath15 does exist for @xmath16 , we presently are not assuming it , so that @xmath2 is not a category of cohesion relative @xmath17 in the sense of  @xcite . )    in such a opological `` category , any space over a base space @xmath18 has a _ discrete _ ( or _ tal _ ) reflection in @xmath5 . in particular",
    ", any space has a et of components '' , and the discrete reflection of a point @xmath19 is the ( infinitesimal ) _ neighborhood _ @xmath20 of @xmath21 .",
    "the full subcategory @xmath22 generated by the neighboroods of the points of @xmath18 is the _ adherence _ category of @xmath18 .",
    "if a space @xmath23 over @xmath18 is in a neighborhood @xmath24 , then v@xmath25 is near the point @xmath21 `` ; more generally , if neighbhorhoods are not monomorphisms , a map @xmath26 s a way to be near the point @xmath21 '' . for a discrete space @xmath23 in @xmath5 , the following property is now almost tautological : for any @xmath27 and any @xmath28 over it , the neighborhood @xmath24 can be uniquely lifted to the neighborhood @xmath29 of @xmath30 ; equivalently , for any @xmath28 , @xmath31 .",
    "thus @xmath23 is indeed a ocal hemeomorphism `` in a very natural sense .",
    "( the fact that local homeomorphisms are the topological correspective of the discrete fibrations in @xmath0 is further supported by  @xcite , where it is shown that tal spaces coincide with pullback - stable iscrete ultrafilter fibrations '' ; in our context , stability of discreteness always holds . )    in @xmath0 , the neighborhood ( in the above sense ) of the point - object @xmath27 is the discrete fibration @xmath32 corresponding to the presheaf represented by @xmath21 , and a way for a functor @xmath23 to be near @xmath21 is simply a cone of base @xmath25 and vertex @xmath21 .",
    "so , a reflection of a functor @xmath23 in @xmath33 in the adherence category @xmath34 is a colimit of @xmath25 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath4 has a right adjoint iff the inverse image ( pullback ) under @xmath35 of any neighborhood in @xmath36 is a neighborhood in @xmath18 .    in section  [ fs ] , we briefly review factorization systems in general , and the comprehensive factorization system on @xmath0 . in sections",

    "we introduce some axioms , mostly aiming at a more accurate description of the category of categories . in section  [ pow ] , we define power objects ( playing the role of presheaf categories ) and prove that if @xmath18 has such a yoneda map `` @xmath37 , the classical definition - characterization of finality holds : a map @xmath38 is in @xmath12 iff for any map @xmath4 the colimits of @xmath35 and @xmath39 are the same ( either existing if the other one does ) .",

    "most of the classical examples of factorization systems give rather uninteresting instances of ategory theories `` .",
    "( indeed , if all the points @xmath58 are in @xmath13 , the adherence categories are discrete and only the constant maps can have ( co)limits ) .",
    "however , apart from categories and opological spaces '' , there are at least two @xmath1-categories which may take advantage from being considered in the present perspective : the category of ( reflexive ) graphs and the category of posets , with @xmath13 given respectively by graph fibrations and by inclusions of lower - sets .",
    "these are briefly considered in section  [ ex ] , where we also discuss some properties of opological categories \" .",
    "some of these topics have been presented at the international conference on category theory ( ct2007 ) held at carvoeiro in june 2007 .",

    "although @xmath368 clearly satisfies lawvere s axioms , it is not an arrow object in our sense , since it does not generate @xmath1 .",
    "note that another factorization system on @xmath356 can be obtained by simply restricting the comprehensive factorization system to the full subcategory of posets .",

    "this @xmath1-category may be considered as representing the common kernel shared by ategories of categories `` and opological categories '' .      as already remarked , by exploiting the logic of a factorization system on an arbitrary finitely complete category , we have been doing in a sense @xmath1-category theory and @xmath1-topology at the same time .",
    "indeed , we have often let our intuition be guided by topological ideas , and we have also talked about opological categories `` when we meant to refer specifically to some category of paces '' rather than of ategories \" .",
    "of course , we are not thinking of the classical category of topological spaces , since we assume that some kind of infinitesimal objects exist in @xmath2 .",
    "in particular the neighborhood @xmath24 of a point should be thought of as the infinitesimal part of the space near @xmath21 .",
    "we have also observed in section  [ ar ] that the classical analysis of infinitesimal aspects in topology via ultrafilter convergence can be in part reconstructed in our general context by assuming a niversal convergence object `` @xmath43 . here , rather than presenting any specific model of opological '' @xmath1-category , we briefly speculate on some properties which may be required to hold in it .",
    "first , it seems natural to assume that neighborhoods are really _ parts _ of the space , that is , the maps @xmath20 are monorphisms .",
    "thus , a space over @xmath18 has at most a way to be near @xmath21 ( see section  [ disp ] ) .",
    "although both the @xmath1-categories of posets just defined have this property they do not have the following eparation property \" : distinct points have disjoint neighborhoods ( that is , with an initial pullback ) .",
    "if this is the case , there are no non - trivial displacements between points , so that @xmath138 is discrete . thus , @xmath23 ( with @xmath125 non - empty ) is near @xmath21 iff it converges to @xmath21 .",

    "the neighborhood of @xmath92 itself is the identity @xmath369 .",
    "the terminal map @xmath290 is fully - faithful and adjunctible .",

    "one may reasonably assume that @xmath2 is a category of cohesion relative to @xmath287 , in the sense of  @xcite .",
    "we now consider only the existence of a right adjoint to the discrete inclusion , but _ at any level_. that is , we suppose that for any @xmath6 there is an nterior operator \" @xmath371 ( as it happens in @xmath0 , but also in the classical category of topological spaces , if @xmath13 is the class of local homeomorphisms ) . in that case",
    ", the points of @xmath372 over @xmath27 are bijective with morphisms @xmath373 over @xmath18 .",
    "( this corresponds to the classical fact that the points of the fiber over @xmath21 of the tal coreflection of a bundle are bijective with the germs of its cross sections at @xmath21 . ) in particular , for monomorphic spaces over @xmath18 , a point is in the interior of a part iff its neighborhood is in the part .",
    "so far , we have done ne - sided @xmath1-topology `` . clearly , it is not appropriate to assume a duality functor @xmath374 as for ategories of categories '' .",
    "yet , @xmath2 may be considered two - sided , by assuming that it has another factorization system @xmath245 , where @xmath375 plays the role of the class of continuous perfect maps ( so that @xmath376 is the subcategory of ompact `` spaces ) .",
    "indeed , the latter are classical characterized by a iscrete ultrafilter fibration '' property , dual to the one that holds for local homeomorphisms . in that case",
