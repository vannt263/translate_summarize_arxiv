    "over the last decades , cosmological observations have provided us with a wealth of information about the structure and evolution of the universe .",
    "dedicated studies of anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) by the _ cobe _ , _ wmap _ and _ planck _ satellites as well as ground - based telescopes have yielded increasingly precise information on the spectrum of cosmic density fluctuations on the largest scales @xcite .",
    "extensive surveys of galaxies and clusters of galaxies and their gravitational lensing effects have clarified the power - spectrum of large - scale structure ( lss ) on somewhat smaller scales @xcite . finally , investigations of inhomogeneities in intergalactic hydrogen through the lyman alpha forest have led to valuable constraints on the distribution of cosmic structure on the smallest scales to date @xcite .",
    "most current observations can be accommodated consistently by the concordance @xmath7cdm cosmological model , based on cold dark matter ( cdm ) , a cosmological constant , and a power - law spectrum of adiabatic primordial density fluctuations that is nearly scale - invariant @xcite .",
    "however , the @xmath7cdm model has yet to be sufficiently tested against observations on scales much smaller than those corresponding to massive galaxies .",
    "the small - scale power spectrum ( ssps ) , that is , the power spectrum of large - scale structure on such scales , is of great interest from different perspectives , not only for cosmology but also for fundamental physics .    on the premise that the concordance @xmath7cdm cosmology is basically valid",
    ", one aspect of the ssps that has received great attention is its role in constraining the mass of neutrinos @xcite .",
    "the existence of finite rest mass of neutrinos has been demonstrated by experiments probing solar and atmospheric neutrino oscillations , which are sensitive to the relative mass differences between different neutrino families .",
    "an important cosmological effect caused by light , massive neutrinos is the suppression of the matter power spectrum on scales smaller than the free streaming scale , which becomes stronger when the total mass of neutrinos is larger . in turn , various cosmological observations including the ssps can provide valuable upper limits on the total mass of neutrinos .",
    "current such limits on the sum of neutrino masses of all families is conservatively of order @xmath8 .",
    "it is of great interest whether further observations can improve on them or even provide measurements of the neutrino mass .",
    "going somewhat beyond the simplest @xmath7cdm model , an interesting possibility is that the spectrum of primordial fluctuations is not a pure power - law but has a running spectral index ( rsi ) , that is , a spectral index @xmath9 that is scale - dependent .",
    "standard , single - field , slow - roll models of cosmological inflation in the early universe predict a nearly scale - invariant spectrum with @xmath10 , where @xmath11 and @xmath3 are expected to be first and second order respectively in the small , slow - roll parameters .",
    "however , in some inflation models , relatively large rsi can be realized @xcite .",
    "current cosmological observations indicate @xmath12 , consistent with standard , slow - roll inflation models .",
    "more extensive observations over a wider range of scales including the ssps should lead to more precise constraints and help to discriminate among inflation models that are indistinguishable in terms of @xmath9 alone .    finally , as a more drastic alternative to cdm , warm dark matter ( wdm ) with particles masses in the kev range has been proposed on various grounds @xcite . the cosmological effect of wdm is characterized by its free streaming scale that depends on its mass @xmath4 . whereas above this scale , it behaves in a way similar to cdm and is indistinguishable from it , below this scale , it dramatically suppresses the power spectrum , resulting in much fewer dark matter halos on small scales compared to cdm .",
    "one specific particle physics candidate for wdm is sterile neutrinos , which are currently constrained to have a mass somewhere in the range @xmath13 kev @xcite .",
    "furthermore , wdm has also been motivated from an astrophysical viewpoint .",
    "current observations indicate that the abundance of satellite galaxies around the milky way and in the local group is much lower than compared to the abundance of cdm subhalos on corresponding scales , the so - called `` missing satellites problem '' @xcite .",
    "although the resolution may lie in astrophysical feedback effects that preferentially quench star formation in smaller systems , wdm can provide an intriguing alternative explanation by attributing the lack of satellite galaxies to the absence of the relevant dark halos in such cosmologies .",
    "such an interpretation may favor a wdm mass in the range of a few kev @xcite ( see however @xcite ) .",
    "further observations of the ssps can offer a critical test of wdm as a viable dark matter candidate .    in order to investigate the ssps in greater depth and test @xmath7cdm and its alternatives",
    ", the most direct approach would be to observationally probe dark matter halos on scales much smaller than those of galaxies in the present universe .",
    "however , this is made difficult by the fact that the bulk of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) has been fully ionized after completion of cosmic reionization at @xmath14 .",
    "in such circumstances , the gas in sufficiently small halos , in particular `` minihalos '' with masses @xmath15 and virial temperature @xmath16 k , is expected to have been substantially photoevaporated @xcite .",
    "thus the only way to probe such halos in the present day may be via gravitational lensing effects @xcite or possibly dm annihilation gamma rays @xcite , which are quite challenging prospects .",
    "on the other hand , an alternative avenue may open up by focusing on redshifts @xmath17 , before cosmic reionization and minihalo photoevaporation have proceeded significantly . at such epochs",
    ", the cold , neutral gas associated with collapsed systems may be observable as a series of redshifted absorption features due to the 21 cm transition in the continuum spectrum of luminous background radio sources such as radio quasars or possibly gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) . dubbed the `` 21 cm forest '' in analogy with the lyman alpha forest",
    ", previous work has shown that the gas in minihalos can give rise to numerous , narrow absorption features that may be observable with future facilities such as the square kilometer array ( ska ) , as long as sufficiently bright radio sources exist at the relevant redshifts @xcite .",
    "the mass function of minihalos is dependent on the ssps on scales @xmath0 mpc@xmath1 , much smaller than the smallest scales that are at present observationally accessible via the lyman alpha forest .",
    "therefore , future observations of the 21 cm forest can potentially provide a very sensitive probe of the ssps , which in turn can provide valuable constraints or measurements of fundamental physics parameters such as the neutrino mass , the wdm particle mass or rsi of primordial fluctuations , the prospects of which are the main topic of this paper .",
    "note that minihalos themselves are unlikely to harbor appreciable star formation , as their virial temperatures are below the threshold for efficient gas cooling via atomic transitions .",
    "however , the 21 cm forest signal can also be significantly affected by external astrophysical effects , such as a background of uv photons or heating of the gas via x - rays or shocks , which are expected to become progressively more important as cosmic reionization proceeds .",
    "indeed , the implications of such astrophysical feedback processes have been the main focus of studies on the 21 cm forest so far @xcite ( see however @xcite ) .",
    "since the consequences for the 21 cm forest of the ssps beyond the standard @xmath7cdm cosmology is being discussed here for the first time , as an initial step , here we choose not to account for the complicating effects of a uv background or heating caused by astrophysical sources .",
    "thus we are able to isolate and clarify the effects of modifications to the ssps itself .",
    "the neglect of feedback effects would be more justifiable at higher redshifts , @xmath18 , where the formation and evolution of stars and other objects are expected to be more limited .",
    "we mention that the global signal of 21 cm emission from minihalos and/or the igm at high redshifts ( for reviews , see @xcite ) has been previously discussed as a potentially powerful probe of the ssps @xcite . however , the major obstacle to such prospects is the huge level of foreground emission , several orders of magnitude brighter than the expected signal , that must be removed very efficiently in order to observe such emission @xcite . in contrast , foregrounds are not a concern for observing the 21 cm forest , as long as sufficiently bright background radio sources exist .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we describe our basic assumptions and formulation regarding the halo gas profile , spin temperature , optical depth and abundance of absorbers .",
    "section iii continues with how we formulate the modifications to the ssps caused by massive neutrinos , rsi and wdm , and also presents the corresponding expectations for the 21 cm forest , in comparison with the standard @xmath7cdm case .",
    "we end with discussions on the observability , various caveats , and a summary in section iv .    for our baseline cosmological model",
    ", we adopt @xmath7cdm with the following parameters from the latest planck data : @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21=0.68 , @xmath22 $ ] , @xmath23 , @xmath24    , where @xmath25 are the densities of cold dark matter , baryons , and cosmological constant , respectively , in units of the critical density , @xmath26 is the hubble constant , and @xmath27 is the variance of mass fluctuations averaged over a sphere with radius 8@xmath28 @xcite .",
    "for the most part , our basic formulation follows that given by furlanetto @xcite , with due modifications for our purposes .",
    "we start with the description of the gas density profile in dark matter halos .",

    "we also note that in treating nonstandard cosmological effects caused by massive neutrinos , rsi or wdm ( section iii ) , we focus on the consequent modifications to the halo mass function , and do not account for modifications to the halo profile itself ( see section iv for further discussion . )      the optical depth to 21  cm absorption is determined by the hi column density and the excitation state of the hyperfine transition of the hi atom , characterized by the spin temperature @xmath59 .",
    "most generally , @xmath59 is determined by the following equation describing the balance between absorption / emission of cmb photons , collisions with other particles and scattering with uv photons @xcite : @xmath60 here , @xmath61 is the cmb temperature at redshift _ z _ , @xmath62 is the gas kinetic temperature , @xmath63 is the effective color temperature of the uv radiation field , and @xmath64 and @xmath65 are the coupling coefficients for collisions with particles and uv photons , respectively .",
    "as discussed in section i , in this work we choose not to account for any uv radiation field in order to understand better how the 21 cm forest is affected by modification to the ssps itself .",
    "hence the relevant equation simplifies @xmath66    we also set @xmath67 , which should be a good approximation for minihalos where gas cooling is inefficient . in principle , h@xmath68 molecular cooling can reduce the gas temperature slightly below @xmath62 @xcite and increase the absorption optical depth , but this effect can be mitigated by h@xmath68 destruction by a lyman - werner background @xcite .",

    "the spin temperature is equivalent to the virial temperature in the inner regions of minihalos ( @xmath82 ) , and decreases asymptotically to the cmb temperature toward the virial radius .",

    "the expected number of absorption features is much less , only of order one with @xmath117 along a given line of sight .",
    "thus , at these redshifts , at least several ( and preferably much more ) background sources would be required for the 21 cm forest to be a useful probe of the ssps .",
    "provided that such measurements can be successfully conducted , the uncertainties with which the key physical parameters are constrained may be roughly estimated as follows .",
    "focusing on @xmath115 , the bottom panels of figs . 6 , 8 and 10",
    "show that the most essential observable for our objectives is the abundance of absorption features with @xmath117 . from the bottom panels of figs . 2 and 4",
    ", it can be judged that such absorbers reflect the most probable lines of sight through minihalos in the crucial mass range just above @xmath120 ( section iii ) .",
    "since we foresee on average only one such absorber per line of sight out to @xmath115 for our baseline case , the main uncertainty would come from the number of available background radio sources with flux @xmath184 .",
    "assuming poisson statistics , measurements for @xmath129 lines of sight would imply uncertainties of @xmath185 ; for example , if suitable observations can be made for 100 background sources at @xmath115 , the parameters characterizing the ssps can be constrained to an accuracy of 10% .",
    "primary candidates for such sources at high redshifts are radio - loud quasars .",
    "for example , an object similar to a powerful , local radio galaxy such as cyg a would have the requisite brightness if placed at @xmath182 @xcite .",
    "estimates based on extrapolations of the observed radio luminosity functions to higher redshifts suggest that depending on the assumptions , there could be as many as @xmath186 and @xmath187 radio quasars with sufficient brightness in the whole sky at @xmath109 and @xmath188 , respectively @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "however , from a physical standpoint , it is an open question whether black holes with accordingly large masses could already have existed at such epochs .",
    "an alternative possibility is the radio afterglows of certain types of grbs .",
    "grbs have already been observed up to @xmath189 , and it is plausible that they occur up to the earliest epochs of star formation in the universe at @xmath148 or higher @xcite .",
    "however , if such grbs are similar to those seen at lower redshifts , their radio afterglows are not expected to be bright enough at the relevant observer frequencies @xmath176 100 mhz due to strong synchrotron self - absorption @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", it has been recently proposed that grbs arising from population ( pop ) iii stars forming in metal - free environments may be much more energetic compared to ordinary grbs , which can generate much brighter low - frequency radio afterglows by virtue of their blastwaves expanding to larger radii over longer timescales @xmath190 yr @xcite .",
    "if the rate of pop iii grbs with sufficiently bright radio emission is 0.1 yr@xmath1 or roughly @xmath191 of all grbs , one can expect @xmath192 such sources all sky at a given time .",
    "thus they may potentially suffice for 21 cm forest studies even at @xmath148 , albeit with large uncertainties .",
    "a practical question that remains is how we can observationally identify such sources .",
    "further discussions on the observability of the 21 cm forest are beyond the scope of this paper and will be explored in future work .",
    "next , we briefly discuss some aspects of astrophysical feedback effects that we have chosen to neglect in this work in order to focus on the implications of the ssps .",
    "once the formation of stars and/or black holes is initiated in the universe , a background of uv and x - ray photons will build up over time .",
    "ly @xmath84 photons can resonantly scatter with hydrogen atoms and alter its hyperfine excitation state via the wouthuysen - field effect ( see eq.[eq : spin1 ] ) @xcite .",
    "furthermore , uv and x - ray photons as well as shocks driven by supernova explosions , quasar outflows , etc . can heat the igm to temperatures much above our assumed value of @xmath193 corresponding to simple , adiabatic cosmic expansion .",
    "the consequences of such effects on the 21 cm forest are likely to be significant @xcite , especially at @xmath182 , where it is clear that cosmic reionization is already in progress from cmb polarization measurements . as a simple illustration of such feedback effects , fig.[fig : abundance_temp ]",
    "shows how the 21 cm forest at @xmath57=10 is affected by introducing a uniform temperature floor in the igm at different values .",
    "the main consequence here is the increase of the jeans mass , which eliminates the smaller minihalos that are predominantly responsible for the 21 cm forest signal and leads to its severe suppression .",
    "compared to the effects of the ssps discussed in section iii , those due to feedback exhibit a much stronger dependence on @xmath100 , which in principle may help in distinguishing the two . however , in practice , exploring the ssps clearly favors observations at @xmath148 and above where such feedback effects are expected to be more limited , in addition to the fact that the ssps - related effects are larger , including those caused by massive neutrinos , running spectral index and warm dark matter .",
    "= 10 for different values of @xmath194 as indicated in the legend.,width=302 ]    we comment on a few other pertinent issues that have not been fully addressed in this paper .",
    "first , at least for low redshifts , the press - schechter form of the halo mass function that we have adopted is not known to be the most precise representation of numerical n - body simulation results , and other forms such as that of sheth and tormen @xcite are more often employed in the literature .",
    "however , the situation is currently less clear for the high redshifts of our interest @xcite , so the press - schechter form was chosen here for simplicity .",
    "further progress warrants more conclusive studies on the subject .",
    "second , our treatment of the cosmological effects induced by massive neutrinos , rsi or wdm concentrated on the resultant modifications to the halo mass function . on the other hand",
    ", these effects can also alter the dark matter profile within individual halos and hence the gas profile as well , potentially affecting the 21 cm absorption signal .",
    "consequences for the halo dark matter profile of massive neutrinos @xcite , rsi @xcite and wdm @xcite have been studied to some extent for galaxy- to cluster - scale halos at low redshifts , indicating that they are affected mainly in the central regions with @xmath195 0.1 .",
    "although no corresponding work exists for high - redshift minihalos , we may speculate that the impact is less than that due to the mass function with regard to our results , for which the outer regions of the halo are more relevant ( fig.2 ) .",
    "nevertheless , this needs to be substantiated by future , dedicated investigations .",
    "third , we did not account for neutral gas lying outside the virial radii of minihalos and accreting onto them , which can provide a significant additional contribution to the absorption feature @xcite .",
    "albeit challenging to model accurately , such components should be taken into account for more accurate predictions in the future .",
    "note also the possibility of further absorption along the line of sight due to the incompletely virialized cosmic web and/or the global igm that is expected to be much weaker @xcite , and that due to the disks of larger galaxies that should be individually stronger but much rarer @xcite .",
    "finally , the implications of relative streaming velocity between baryons and dark matter @xcite may also be interesting for future studies of the 21 cm forest .    to conclude",
    ", we have presented a novel approach to probe small - scale cosmological fluctuations utilizing the 21 cm forest , that is , absorption features caused by hi gas in minihalos in the spectrum of background radio sources at redshifts at @xmath182 and above .",
    "the method is potentially sensitive to scales @xmath0 mpc@xmath1 , much smaller than can be currently studied via observations of the cmb , galaxy clustering or the ly@xmath84 forest .",
    "new insight can be expected into aspects of physics beyond the standard @xmath7cdm cosmological model such as massive neutrinos , running of the primordial spectral index and warm dark matter .",
    "radio quasars or population iii gamma - ray bursts are potential candidates for the background radio sources with the requisite brightness and number at the appropriate redshifts for future observations with ska .",
    "further potentially interesting cosmological applications of the 21 cm forest include probes of primordial non - gaussianity in relation to either the nonlinear , scale - dependent bias @xcite or the halo mass function @xcite , and probes of isocurvature primordial perturbations ( e.g @xcite ) .",
    "we note that several recent papers have discussed the possibility of studying various aspects of the ssps via the 21 cm emission signal @xcite , although efficient removal of the far brighter foreground emission poses a major observational challenge for realizing such prospects @xcite .",

    "<S> although the cosmological paradigm based on cold dark matter and adiabatic , nearly scale - invariant primordial fluctuations is consistent with a wide variety of existing observations , it has yet to be sufficiently tested on scales smaller than those of massive galaxies , and various alternatives have been proposed that differ significantly in the consequent small - scale power spectrum ( ssps ) of large - scale structure . </S>",
    "<S> here we show that a powerful probe of the ssps at @xmath0 mpc@xmath1 can be provided by the 21 cm forest , that is , systems of narrow absorption lines due to intervening , cold neutral hydrogen in the spectra of high - redshift background radio sources in the cosmic reionization epoch . </S>",
    "<S> such features are expected to be caused predominantly by collapsed gas in starless minihalos , whose mass function can be very sensitive to the ssps . as specific examples , we consider the effects of neutrino mass , running spectral index ( rsi ) and warm dark matter ( wdm ) on the ssps , and evaluate the expected distribution in optical depth of 21 cm absorbers out to different redshifts . within the current constraints on quantities such as the sum of neutrino masses @xmath2 , running of the primordial spectral index @xmath3 and wdm particle mass @xmath4 , the statistics of the 21 cm forest manifest observationally significant differences that become larger at higher redshifts . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , it may be possible to probe the range of @xmath5 kev that may otherwise be difficult to access . </S>",
    "<S> future observations of the 21 cm forest by the square kilometer array may offer a unique and valuable probe of the ssps , as long as radio sources such as quasars or population iii gamma - ray bursts with sufficient brightness and number exist at redshifts of @xmath6 10 - 20 , and the astrophysical effects of reionization and heating can be discriminated . </S>"
