    "the gravitational collapse of the core of a massive stars entails a vast release of energy . because particles with only weak interactions can readily escape the star on a timescale of tens of seconds , an overwhelming fraction of the binding energy is carried away by neutrinos .",
    "the neutrino burst from a galactic supernova can be detected in terrestrial detectors .",
    "as of this writing , the only supernova for which neutrinos have been detected is sn1987a , for which a total of 19 neutrinos were observed in two water cherenkov detectors@xcite ; scintillation detectors@xcite also reported observations .",
    "these observations confirmed the expected general features of gravitational collapse , but the data were insufficient to distinguish fine details of different models .",
    "the baseline model predicts a burst of neutrinos of total energy a few times 10@xmath0 ergs .",
    "the expected proto - neutron star core temperature corresponds to neutrino energies in the few to tens of mev range . in the most straightforward picture ,",
    "one expects @xmath1 , because neutrino species with fewer interactions with the core s matter will emerge from deeper , and hence hotter regions of the star .",
    "however , some recent studies ( _ _ e.g.__@xcite ) bring into question the robustness of this prediction , since scattering may degrade this hierarchy of energies .",
    "the timescale of the burst is tens of seconds ( consistent with the 1987a measurements ) , with a higher rate during the first few seconds .",
    "the neutrinos will emerge from the collapsed core well before any supernova photons .",
    "possibly , the flux could be modulated by formation of a black hole or other events early in the neutron star s life .",
    "the neutrino burst includes all flavors of @xmath2 and @xmath3 , and the generic expectation is for the neutrino energy to be roughly equipartitioned among the different flavors .",
    "a nearby core collapse supernova would be a neutrino experimentalist s dream , as well as an astrophysicist s . the huge burst will certainly help us learn about the core collapse process itself .",
    "the neutrino burst s time , flavor and energy structure will bring information about the explosion mechanism , accretion , possible quark matter or black hole formation , and so on .",
    "in addition , we can learn about neutrinos themselves .",
    "for instance , absolute neutrino mass leads to an energy - dependent time of flight delay as neutrinos travel from their source to earth ; however , it will be difficult to improve on current laboratory limits .",
    "the parameters governing neutrino oscillations will imprint themselves on the neutrino signal .",
    "as the neutrinos propagate through the stellar matter , they may undergo msw - type resonance transitions in regions of specific matter density ; in particular , there may be signatures of the unknown mixing angle @xmath4 and neutrino mass hierarchy ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) . other properties of neutrinos may also yield interesting effects , as will various proposed exotic physics scenarios : in particular , the observed cooling timescale allows one to set limits on coupling to axions , large extra dimensions , and other exotic physics ( _ _ e.g.__@xcite ) , since any large coupling would allow extra energy to escape from the star , and lead to a neutrino signal which is abbreviated with respect to the expected burst .",
    "again , the measured time , flavor and energy structure of the burst will contain the signatures of unknown physics .",
    "however , a difficulty here is that both core collapse physics and neutrino physics affect the nature of the burst , and it may not be trivial to disentangle the two . to learn about neutrinos , one must make assumptions about the nature of the collapse , and vice versa .",
    "nevertheless , some features of the collapse are more robust than others , allowing model - independent studies .",
    "also , one may cancel supernova model - dependent uncertainties in the study of neutrino oscillations by comparing fluxes measured at different locations on the earth , and one may even look for matter - induced oscillation features in the spectrum of neutrinos measured in a single detector @xcite . clearly , the more information we can gather about the flavor , energy and time structure of the burst , in as many detectors around the world as possible , the better chance we will have of disentangling the various effects .",
    "one other potential scientific gift from a neutrino burst is an early warning of a supernova s occurrence : the neutrinos emerge promptly from the dense core , while astronomers must wait hours for the first photons to appear as the shock wave emerges from the stellar envelope .",
    "the snews@xcite network exists to provide such an early warning to astronomers ( and others ) , which may allow observations from the very early ( and previously rarely - observed ) turn - on of the supernova light . clearly , the more information that can be gathered , in all wavelengths ( and also perhaps in gravitational waves ) , the better . because core collapses are rare events ( a few per century ) , it is essential to be prepared .",
    "from a neutrino experimentalist s point of view , the basic strategy is to prepare to collect as many neutrino events as possible , of as many flavors as possible .",
    "a back of the envelope calculation shows that one typically gets a few hundred neutrino interactions per kton of detector material for a core collapse event at the center of the milky way , 8.5  kpc away . for a successful observation",
    ", the detector background rate must not exceed the supernova signal rate in a 10 second burst : this criterion is easy to satisfy for underground detectors , and is even thinkable for many near - surface detectors@xcite .",
    "one would like to have event - by - event timing resolution , ability to measure neutrino energies , and if possible , ability to use the neutrino information to point back to the supernova .",
    "sensitivity to all flavors of the burst is extremely desirable : @xmath5 and @xmath6 flavors comprise two - thirds of the burst s energy , but because supernova neutrino energies rarely exceed a few tens of mev , these components of the flux are overwhelmingly below charged current ( cc ) interaction threshold , and neutral current ( nc ) sensitivity is required to detect them . as a final point , it will be especially valuable for detectors to have _ ability to tag _ interactions as @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 as well as just to collect them .",
    "currently the world s primary sensitivity to supernova neutrinos is via that old workhorse of neutrino physics , inverse beta decay : @xmath10 . in this reaction",
    ", the produced positron has the energy of the neutrino , less 1.8  mev ; the positron s energy loss is the primary means of detection .",
    "there are furthermore two possible tags of inverse beta decay : a prompt positron annihilation produces two 0.511  mev @xmath11 rays , and the neutron may also be observable via its time - delayed capture on a nucleus .",
    "capture of a neutron by a free proton produces a 180 @xmath12s - delayed 2.2  mev @xmath11 ray .    in any detector with lots of free protons , inverse beta decay typically dominates by orders of magnitude .",
    "the reaction has a mild energy - dependent anisotropy@xcite .",
    "examples of detectors leaning heavily on this reaction are hydrocarbon - based , and usually scintillating ( e.g. baksan,@xcite , lvd@xcite , kamland@xcite , borexino@xcite , and mini - boone@xcite . )",
    "scintillation detectors can often achieve quite low ( sub - mev ) energy thresholds , and therefore have potential for neutron capture and/or @xmath11 tagging . however because scintillation light is emitted isotropically , pointing capability is generally poor .",
    "water cherenkov detectors ( e.g. super - kamiokande@xcite ) also have a high rate of inverse beta decays , but have difficulty with tagging neutrons due to high energy thresholds . a recent suggestion to spike water with gadolinium trichloride@xcite which may allow tagging .",
    "gd has a huge neutron capture cross - section ; the resulting @xmath11-rays can then be observed via the cherenkov radiation from compton scatters .",
    "the gd - capture technique has been successfully used in small scintillation detectors ( _ e.g. _ chooz@xcite ) and is currently under study for super - kamiokande .    the use of water cherenkov detectors for supernova neutrino detection can be extended to detectors like amanda / icecube that are made of long strings of sparsely distributed photomultiplier tubes embedded in ice or water .",
    "such sparse pmt array detectors are nominally high energy ( @xmath13  gev ) neutrino detectors .",
    "they can not record mev neutrinos on an event - by - event basis ; nevertheless they may be able to observe a coincident increase in single count rates from many phototubes due to a large number of inverse - beta - decay - induced cherenkov photons in the surrounding ice or water@xcite .",
    "charged current interactions can occur for bound as well as free nucleons .",
    "reactions of both @xmath7 and @xmath8 can occur , with the production of an electron or positron : @xmath14    cross - sections are typically smaller for bound than for free nucleons , but can nevertheless be non - negligible .",
    "the charged lepton is usually observable , and cc interactions sometimes can be tagged in other ways , _",
    "e.g. _ via detection of ejected nucleons or nuclear de - excitation @xmath11 rays .",
    "cc cross - sections and the nature of the observables are dependent on the nuclear physics of the specific nucleus involved , and in many cases there are large uncertainties .",
    "examples of cc interactions useful for supernova neutrino detection are nc breakup in heavy water ( @xmath15 , @xmath16 ) , interactions with oxygen in water , ( @xmath17 , @xmath18 ) , and interactions with carbon in scintillator ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 ) .",
    "interactions with heavier nuclei may also yield high rates : for example , various lead - based detectors have been proposed ( omnis , land / halo)@xcite .",
    "a particularly nice tagged @xmath7 channel is available in argon , @xmath21 ; the @xmath22 de - excitation @xmath11 s would be observable in various proposed large liquid argon detectors ( icarus , lanndd)@xcite . finally , radiochemical detectors based on ga , cl , and other isotopes could potentially yield excess events ( although without time resolution ) ; and it is in principle possible to run some of these in a quasi - real - time mode .      elastic neutrino - electron scattering ( es ) , @xmath23 , which occurs via both cc and nc channels , has a relatively small cross - section : the rate is a few percent of the inverse beta decay rate in scintillator and water cherenkov detectors .",
    "nevertheless the es component of the supernova neutrino signal will be especially interesting , because it is _ directional _ : the electrons get kicked forward by the neutrinos with an average angle of about 25@xmath24 . if the direction of the kicked electron can be determined ( e.g. from a cherenkov cone ) , elastic scattering can be used to learn the location of the supernova , and is in fact the best way of using a neutrino detector to point back to the supernova s location@xcite .",
    "only the @xmath7 and @xmath8 components of the supernova neutrino signal are accessible via cc interactions .",
    "because nc interactions are flavor - blind , they measure the total flux , including the @xmath25 and @xmath26 components .",
    "various nc interactions on nuclei have cross - sections that yield reasonable rates , and as for the cc case , sometimes a nice tag is possible via ejected nucleons or de - excitation @xmath11 s .",
    "for example , a 15.5  mev de - excitation @xmath11-ray tags the nc excitation of @xmath27 , @xmath28 ; a cascade of 5 - 10  mev de - excitation @xmath11s may also tag @xmath29 in a water cherenkov detector @xcite .    a particularly promising future possibility for nc supernova neutrino detection is a lead - based neutrino detector , for which the cross - section is high for nc as well as cc channels .",
    "for @xmath30 , the lead nucleus subsequently emits a neutron .",
    "the one - neutron emission channel is expected to be predominant for nc@xcite , in contrast to a high rate of double - neutron emission for the cc reaction .",
    "the relative rates for the different channels in lead depend on neutrino energy , which promises some spectral information and hence sensitivity to oscillation effects .",
    "there have been proposals to employ metallic lead and lead in form of perchlorate .",
    "a promising recent proposal is halo@xcite , which plans to make use the @xmath31he ncd counters from sno when sno shuts down at the end of 2006 . as for the cc @xmath2-nucleus reactions , here again rates and signatures depend on specific nuclear physics .",
    "another nc channel which has been not been explored until fairly recently is neutrino - proton nc elastic scattering , @xmath32@xcite .",
    "the rate is relatively high , but because the free proton target is heavy , recoil kinetic energies are low . the recoils may nevertheless be observable in large low threshold scintillation detectors , e.g. kamland , even after accounting for `` quenching '' in scintillator .",
    "neutral current coherent neutrino - nucleus elastic scattering , @xmath33 , occurs at even higher rates than @xmath34 scattering , but because the targets are yet heavier , recoil energies are yet tinier in the tens of kev range .",
    "this might seem a hopeless situation , but such tiny recoils are within the reach of novel detectors developed for pp solar neutrinos or wimp detection@xcite .",
    "for example , a detector like clean@xcite , which can potentially expand to a 10 ton scale , would observe a few events per ton from an 8.5  kpc supernova .",
    "current and proposed detectors are summarized in table  [ tab : detectors ] .",
    "the numbers of events given for a galactic center supernova should be taken as uncertain by at least 50% ; not only are there uncertainties in the collapse models , in many cases the numbers of observable events depend on assumed thresholds , efficiencies , enrichment , and other detector - configuration - specific properties .",

    "in many cases , the cross - sections have never been measured experimentally , and theoretically there are large uncertainties .",
    "one way of decreasing uncertainties is to use a stopped - pion neutrino source to measure relevant cross - sections : such a source provides @xmath5 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 in nearly the same energy range as expected for a supernova .",
    "a future program of measurements on various targets , such as that planned for the spallation neutron source@xcite , will be vital for extracting physics from the next supernova .",
    "even the largest detectors running today are sensitive only to supernovae within a few hundred kpc , which pretty much covers only our own galaxy .",
    "the next nearest large concentration of stars is the andromeda galaxy , about 770 kpc away ; at this distance , super - k would expect only @xmath391 event . unfortunately , the expected rate of milky way supernovae is only a few per century , so if luck is against us , the wait may well be longer than a typical physicist s career .",
    "several next - generation very large detectors have been proposed which would have supernova neutrino sensitivity : these include mton - scale water detectors ( hyper - k@xcite , uno@xcite , memphys@xcite ) and 100 kton - scale large lar and scintillator detectors ( landdd@xcite , lena@xcite ) .",
    "however even the largest of these mega - detectors would see only tens of events from a core collapse in andromeda .",
    "but while @xmath40 hurts , the increase of potential sources as @xmath41 helps : a recent study@xcite has pointed out a regime for which the probability of detecting a few events per supernova in a mton detector is reasonably close to 1 at the same time as the overall rate of expected core collapses is reasonably close to 1 per year .",
    "so if one can operate a large , low background detector ( possibly using optical or gravitational wave ( gw ) detections nearby in time to reduce the background ) , one can expect to collect a thin but steady dribble of supernova neutrinos .",
    "we can look even farther out : stellar cores have been giving up their binding energy to neutrinos ever since the first stars formed , and we are awash in a sea of these ancient neutrinos .",
    "this diffuse supernova neutrino background ( dsnb ) ( formerly known as the `` relic '' supernova neutrino background ) provides a steady source of neutrinos .",
    "but because there is no hope of tagging dsnb neutrinos with optical or gw events , detection feasibility rests on reducing background to essentially zero .",
    "this may indeed be possible for @xmath8 using a large scintillator or gd - spiked water detector to tag @xmath8 , in the few tens of mev regime , which is nearly free of solar or atmospheric neutrino background .",
    "detection of dsnb neutrinos is very interesting from the point of view of learning about cosmology via knowledge of the past supernova rate .",
    "however , when considering use of the dsnb to learn about neutrinos , stellar collapse physics and so on , one must consider the overall rate .",
    "one expects a low , but sure return on one s investment at @xmath390.1 event / kton / yr of dsnb .",
    "in contrast , in the very long term , on average one expects about 10 events / kton / yr of galactic supernova neutrinos . counting on a signal from the latter is risky in the short term , because there may be large poissonian gaps .",
    "but surely , over centuries , the galactic supernova detection approach wins .",
    "clearly the best strategy is diversification of one s experimental portfolio : a large , clean detector that runs for decades will yield rich and reliable returns .",
    "several supernova - neutrino detectors are running and ready to observe a galactic burst .",
    "a variety of new detectors are proposed : those with broad flavor sensitivity and tagging ability will be especially valuable for extracting physics from the signal .",
    "the neutrinos will come .",
    "we need to build detectors to gather them all : the galactic bursts , the fainter flashes from just beyond , and the dim but steady background glow .",
