    "in nature and technology , a broad variety of active media where pattern selection occurs is governed by kuramoto  sivashinsky type equations . in the presence of an imposed advectional transport @xmath0 in the @xmath1-direction the modified kuramoto",
    " sivashinsky equation reads @xmath2 this equation describes two - dimensional large - scale natural thermal convection in a horizontal fluid layer heated from below  @xcite and is still valid for a turbulent fluid  @xcite , a binary mixture at small lewis number  @xcite , a porous layer saturated with a fluid  @xcite , etc . in these fluid dynamical systems , except for the turbulent one  @xcite , the plates bounding the layer should be nearly thermally insulating ( in comparison to the fluid ) for a large - scale convection to arise . in the problems mentioned , equation   governs evolution of temperature perturbations @xmath3 which are nearly uniform along the vertical coordinate @xmath4 and determine fluid currents .",
    "the origin of such a frequent occurrence of equation   is its general validity , which may be argued as follows .",
    "basic laws in physics are conservation ones .",
    "this often results in final governing equations having the form @xmath5+\\nabla\\!\\cdot\\![\\mbox{flux of quantity}]=0 $ ] .",
    "such conservation laws lead to kuramoto  sivashinsky type equations .",
    "while the original kuramoto  sivashinsky equation has a quadratic nonlinear term ( cf  @xcite ) , this term should be replaced by a cubic one for the systems with the sign inversion symmetry of the fields , which is widespread in nature , or for description of a spatiotemporal modulation of an oscillatory mode .",
    "thus the governing equation takes the form  . on these grounds , we state",
    "that equation   describes pattern formation in a broad variety of physical systems .",
    "we restrict this paper to the case of convection in a porous medium  @xcite for the sake of definiteness ; nonetheless , most of our results may be extended in a straightforward manner to the other physical systems mentioned .",
    "is already dimensionless and below we introduce all parameters and variables in appropriate dimensionless forms .    in the large - scale ( or long - wavelength ) approximation , which we use ,",
    "the characteristic horizontal scales are assumed to be large against the layer height @xmath6 . in equation",
    ", @xmath7 represents the local supercriticality : @xmath8 is the sum of relative deviations of the heating intensity and of the macroscopic properties of the porous matrix ( porosity , permeability , heat diffusivity , etc . ) from the critical values for the spatially homogeneous case  @xcite . for positive spatially uniform @xmath9 , convection sets up , while for negative @xmath9 , all the temperature perturbations decay . in a porous medium  @xcite ,",
    "the macroscopic fluid velocity field is @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the stream function amplitude , and the reference frame is such that @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the lower and upper boundaries of the layer , respectively [ ( b ) ] . though the temperature perturbations obey equation   for diverse convective systems , function @xmath14 , which determines the relation between the flow pattern and the temperature perturbation , is specific to each case .",
    "notice that @xmath0 is not presented in expression   owing to its smallness in comparison to the excited convective currents @xmath15 .",
    "the impact of a weak imposed advective flow on the evolution of temperature perturbations is caused by its symmetry properties : the gross advective flux through the vertical cross - section is @xmath0 , while the convective flow @xmath15 possesses zero gross flux and , therefore , yields a less effective heat transfer along the layer  @xcite .",
    "although equation is valid for a large - scale inhomogeneity @xmath7 , which means @xmath16 , one can set such a hierarchy of small parameters , namely @xmath17 , that a frozen random inhomogeneity may be represented by white gaussian noise @xmath18 : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the disorder intensity and @xmath21 is the mean supercriticality ( i.e.  departure from the instability threshold of the disorder - free system ) .",
    "numerical simulation reveals only time - independent solutions to establish in with @xmath22 and such @xmath7  @xcite ; for a small non - zero @xmath0 , stable oscillatory regimes are of low probability by continuity .    in the stationary case for @xmath22 the linearized form of equation , i.e.",
    ", @xmath23 is a stationary schrdinger equation for @xmath24 with @xmath21 instead of the state energy and @xmath25 instead of the potential .",
    "therefore , similarly to the case of the schrdinger equation ( see  @xcite ) , all the solutions @xmath26 to the stationary linearized equation are spatially localized for arbitrary @xmath21 ; asymptotically , @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the localization exponent .",
    "such a localization can be readily seen for the solution to the nonlinear problem in ( a ) for @xmath29 , @xmath22 , which is a solitary vortex .",
    "for @xmath30 the solitary patterns are still exponentially localized [ ( a ) , @xmath31 .",
    "however , their localization properties change drastically because instead of the second - order linear ode with respect to @xmath24 , equation  , one finds a third - order equation : @xmath32 the two symmetric modes @xmath33 and trivial solution @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) turn into three modes @xmath36 , @xmath37 , of equation   with @xmath38 , @xmath39 ( see sample spectrum of @xmath40 in  ; cf  @xcite for details ) .",
    "specifically , @xmath41-mode is the successor of @xmath42 , @xmath43-mode is the one of the trivial homogeneous mode , and @xmath44-mode is that of @xmath45 .",
    "thus , the upstream flank of the localized pattern is now composed by two modes decaying in the distance from the pattern : @xmath46 where functions @xmath47 and @xmath48 neither grow nor decay over large distances .",
    "the @xmath41-mode , which disappears for @xmath22 , i.e.  @xmath49 , decays slowly for a small finite @xmath0 , prevails over the @xmath43-mode decaying rapidly , and , thus , determines the upstream localization properties of the pattern .",
    "the upstream localization length @xmath50 can become remarkably large leading to upstream delocalization of patterns , which can be seen in .",
    "one should keep in mind , that consideration of solitary patterns makes sense where such patterns can be distinguished , i.e. , are sparse enough in space .",
    "this is the case of negative @xmath51 . in  , for a sample realization of @xmath18 , one can see that localized patterns can be discriminated for @xmath52 , @xmath53 and the localization properties are very well pronounced for @xmath29 .",
    "here we would like to emphasize the fact of existence of convective currents below the instability threshold of the disorder - free system .",
    "these currents considerably and nontrivially affect transport of a pollutant ( or other passive scalar ) , especially when its molecular diffusivity is small in comparison to the thermal one , which is quite typical in nature ( for instance , at standard conditions the molecular diffusivity of nacl in water is @xmath54 against the heat diffusivity of water which is @xmath55 ) .",
    "transport of a nearly indiffusive passive scalar , quantified by the effective ( or eddy ) diffusivity coefficient , is the object of our research , as a `` substance '' which is essentially influenced by these localized currents and , thus , provides an opportunity to observe manifestation of disorder - induced phenomena discussed in  @xcite .    in",
    "@xcite we studied the problem for the case of no advection ( @xmath22 ) and calculated ( both numerically and analytically ) the enhancement of the effective diffusivity by disorder - induced currents ; this enhancement is especially strong for low molecular diffusivity deep below the instability threshold of the disorder - free system ( see ) . in this paper",
    "we address the role of an imposed advection in this problem .",
    "the interest to advection is provoked by its dramatic influence on localization properties , i.e. , the upstream delocalization of convective currents that is described above .",
    "we expect this delocalization to result in a giant increase of the effective diffusivity for a nearly indiffusive pollutant and , particularly , in the lowering of the mean supercriticality ( @xmath21 ) value at which the transition from sets of localized convective currents to an almost everywhere intense ` global ' flow occurs .",
    "in this section we describe the transport of a passive pollutant by a steady convective flow ; `` passive '' means that the flow is not influenced by the pollutant .",
    "the assumption of passiveness is practically relevant because ( biologically / chemichally ) significant concentrations of a pollutant can be very small and mechanically negligible .",
    "the flux @xmath56 of the pollutant concentration @xmath57 is @xmath58 where the first term describes the convective transport , the second one represents the molecular diffusion , and @xmath59 is the molecular diffusivity . the establishing time - independent distributions of the pollutant obey @xmath60 [ with account for ] yields a distribution of @xmath57 which is uniform along @xmath4 and is determined by @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the constant pollutant flux along the layer . detailed derivation of equation for @xmath22 can be found in  @xcite where it was performed in the spirit of the standard multiscale method ( interested readers can consult , _ e.g. _ ,  @xcite ) .",
    "remarkably , advection velocity @xmath0 is not presented in the last equation : its direct contribution to convective currents transferring the pollutant is small in comparison to the one of excited convective currents .",
    "instead , it influences the heat transfer and , consequently , excited flows , drastically changing properties of the field @xmath26 .",
    "notice that , for the other convective systems which we mentioned in , the result differs only in the factor ahead of @xmath63 .",
    "thus we come to introducing the effective diffusivity for the system under consideration ( general ideas on the effective diffusivity in systems with irregular currents can be found , e.g. , in  @xcite ) .",
    "let us consider the domain @xmath64 $ ] with the imposed concentration difference @xmath65 at the ends .",
    "then the establishing pollutant flux @xmath62 is defined by the integral [ cf ] @xmath66 for a lengthy domain the specific realization of @xmath18 becomes insignificant : @xmath67 hence , @xmath68 which means that @xmath69 can be treated as an effective diffusivity .",
    "the effective diffusivity @xmath70 turns into @xmath59 for vanishing convective flow . for small @xmath59",
    "the regions of the layer where the flow is damped , @xmath71 , make large contribution to the mean value appearing in and diminish @xmath69 , thus , leading to the locking of the spreading of the pollutant .",
    "the disorder strength @xmath20 can be excluded from equations by the appropriate rescaling of parameters and fields . as a consequence",
    ", the results on the effective diffusivity can be comprehensively presented in terms of @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , and @xmath75 : @xmath76 provides calculated dependencies of effective diffusivity @xmath73 on @xmath74 for moderate and small values of molecular diffusivity @xmath72 . concerning these dependencies",
    "the following is worth noticing :    * ( a ) * for small @xmath72 a quite sharp transition of effective diffusivity @xmath73 between moderate values and ones comparable with @xmath72 occurs near @xmath77 ( note logarithmic scale of the vertical axis ) , suggesting the transition from an almost everywhere intense ` global ' flow to a set of localized currents to take place .    *",
    "( b ) * in the presence of a weak imposed advection , @xmath78 , the transition to ` global ' flow occurs at the value of @xmath74 which is considerably lower than that without advection .    *",
    "( c ) * below the instability threshold of the disorder - free system , where only sparse localized currents are excited , the effective diffusion can be significantly enhanced by these currents .    *",
    "( d ) * the disorder - induced enhancement of the effective diffusivity is especially drastic in the presence of an imposed advection ; e.g. , for @xmath79 , @xmath80 , the effective diffusivity is increased by one order of magnitude compared to the molecular diffusivity without advection ( @xmath81 ) and by two orders of magnitude for @xmath78 .",
    "the effective diffusivity can be analytically evaluated for a small molecular diffusivity ( @xmath82 ) and sparse domains of excitation of convective currents ( the spacial density of the excitation domains @xmath83 ) . in",
    "@xcite it was evaluated for the case of no advection , @xmath84 where one can use the asymptotic expressions for the density of the excitation domains @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 which are valid for @xmath88 .",
    "the latter expression is known from the classical theory of al ( e.g. , see  @xcite ) . in the following",
    "we advance the evaluation procedure realized in  @xcite in order to account for the asymmetry between up- and downstream localization exponents .",
    "now we calculate the average @xmath89 due to ergodicity , this average over @xmath1 for a given realization of @xmath18 coincides with the average over realizations of @xmath18 at a certain point @xmath90 .",
    "we set the origin of the @xmath1-axis at @xmath90 and find @xmath91 .",
    "when the two nearest to the origin excitation domains are distant and localized near @xmath92 and @xmath93 ( see ) , @xmath94 where @xmath95 and @xmath96 characterize the amplitude of temperature perturbation modes excited around @xmath97 and @xmath98 , respectively . for small @xmath72 and density @xmath85 , the contribution of the excitation domains to @xmath99 is negligible against that of the extensive regions where flow is weak , but @xmath100 is still larger than @xmath72 .",
    "therefore , one may be not very subtle with `` cores '' of excitation domains and may utilize expression   even for small @xmath101 : @xmath102 where @xmath103 [ @xmath104 is the density of the probability to observe the nearest right [ left ] excitation domain at @xmath105 [ @xmath106 . for probability distribution @xmath107 , one finds @xmath108 , i.e. , @xmath109 .",
    "hence , @xmath110 , and probability density @xmath111 . as regards averaging over @xmath112 ,",
    "it is important that the multiplication of @xmath112 by factor @xmath113 is effectively equivalent to the shift of the excitation domain by @xmath114 , which is insignificant for @xmath115 in the limit case that we consider .",
    "hence , one can assume @xmath116 ( the topological difference between different combinations of signs of @xmath112 is not to be neglected ) and rewrite equation   as @xmath117 .",
    "\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for @xmath118 and @xmath43-mode dominating over @xmath41-mode ( that is the case in ) , the last formula yields @xmath119 here we assume that advection is weak and suppresses thermal convection in a negligible fraction of the excitation centers and the asymptotic expression is still valid .",
    "noticeable difference between equation for @xmath81 , i.e. , @xmath120 , and equation is actually insignificant up to our approximations , because moderate number @xmath121 risen to small power @xmath122 , @xmath123 which is the ratio of these equations , approximately equals 1 . is simpler than that we consider here and admits analytical evaluation of integrals with a fewer number of approximations . ] for instance , in , the curves given by analytic expressions   and with @xmath120 are visually undistinguishable .    for small finite @xmath75 , smallness of @xmath43 in equation",
    "gives rise to a significant enhancement of effective diffusivity @xmath73 , which is in agreement with the results of numerical simulation presented in .",
    "shows that for @xmath78 the effective diffusivity in the presence of advection is always stronger than without it ; the larger the difference between the effective and the molecular diffusivity the stronger advectional enhancement of the effective diffusivity is . for instance , for @xmath124 , @xmath80 the effective diffusivity in the presence of advection @xmath78 is by factor 10 larger than without advection , and this factor grows as @xmath72 decreases .",
    "noteworthy , for @xmath78 expression   provides slightly overestimated value of the effective diffusivity while for @xmath81 the analytical estimation is accurate .",
    "the inaccuracy appears because in our analytical theory we ignore three factors : ( a ) decrease of the spatial density of the excitation centers owing to advectional suppression ( washing - out ) of weak excitation centers ; ( b ) for small @xmath75 the rapidly decaying upstream @xmath41-mode is significant because of the smallness of the slowly decaying @xmath43-mode ; and ( c ) as the advection strengthens , currents in some excitation domains disappear via a hopf bifurcation  @xcite and thus there is non - zero probability to observe oscillatory flows for small @xmath75 even though there is no stable time - dependent solutions for @xmath81 .",
    "unfortunately , inaccuracies caused by these three assumptions can not be minimized simultaneously : the first and third assumptions require @xmath125 , while the second one needs @xmath75 to be small but finite .",
    "oscillatory localized patterns discovered in the dynamic system   for non - zero @xmath75 ( ( a ) ; see  @xcite for details ) are statistically improbable and rare when @xmath75 is small .",
    "notably , their relative contribution to the effective diffusivity is much larger than their fraction among the excited localized patterns . in ( b )",
    "one can see the soaring of the effective diffusivity along a finite region as a localized pattern turns oscillatory ( @xmath126 ) before disappearing ( @xmath127 ) .",
    "( a ) reveals the origin of this soaring : the oscillatory pattern is not so well localized as the time - independent one .",
    "indeed , the localization properties of the oscillatory pattern of frequency @xmath128 are determined by the following linearization of equation  : @xmath129 in contrast to  , this is already a 4th - order differential equation , which yields four localization exponents .",
    "the newly appeared 4th mode possesses @xmath130 , i.e. , decays slowly , and contributes to the downstream flank of localized patterns ( evidence of these facts is beyond the scope of this paper and will be presented elsewhere ) . as well as",
    "the @xmath43-mode results in upstream delocalization of time - independent patterns , the new mode leads to downstream delocalization of oscillatory patterns , which appear to be weakly localized both up- and downstream , as one sees this in ( a ) .",
    "nevertheless , owing to the smallness of the fraction of the oscillatory patterns among all the localized patterns at small @xmath75 , their contribution to the effective diffusivity over large domains is still negligible .",
    "this is additionally confirmed by the accuracy of our analytical theory disregarding oscillatory currents [ equation  ] .",
    "meanwhile , the analytical theory accounting for the oscillatory patterns should involve the distribution of frequencies of excited patterns , which are to be determined only from the nonlinear problem  : this is not an analytically solvable problem .",
    "we have studied the transport of a pollutant in a horizontal fluid layer by spatially localized two - dimensional thermoconvective currents appearing under frozen parametric disorder in the presence of an imposed longitudinal advection .",
    "though we have considered the specific physical system , a horizontal porous layer saturated with a fluid and confined between two nearly thermally insulating plates , our results can be in a straightforward manner extended to a broad variety of fluid dynamical systems ( like ones studied in  @xcite ) .",
    "we have calculated numerically the dependence of the effective diffusivity on the molecular one and the mean supercriticality for a non - zero advection strength ( see ) .",
    "the results reveal that advectional delocalization of convective currents greatly assists transfer of a nearly indiffusive pollutant ( @xmath131 ) below the instability threshold of the disorder - free system : the effective diffusivity can become by several orders of magnitude larger in comparison to that without advection .    the analytical theory focusing on advectional delocalization of localized current patterns yields results which are in a fair agreement with the results of numerical simulation .",
    "this correspondence confirms our treatment of importance of disorder - induced patterns and their localization properties in active / dissipavite media , which provoked works  @xcite ."
