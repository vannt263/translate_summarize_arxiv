    "observations of the redshifted 21-cm radiation from the large scale distribution of neutral hydrogen ( hi ) is one of the most promising probes to study the high redshift universe ( recent reviews : @xcite ) .",

    "<S> we present two estimators to quantify the angular power spectrum of the sky signal directly from the visibilities measured in radio interferometric observations . </S>",
    "<S> this is relevant for both the foregrounds and the cosmological @xmath0-cm signal buried therein . </S>",
    "<S> the discussion here is restricted to the galactic synchrotron radiation , the most dominant foreground component after point source removal . </S>",
    "<S> our theoretical analysis is validated using simulations at @xmath1 , mainly for gmrt and also briefly for lofar . </S>",
    "<S> the bare estimator uses pairwise correlations of the measured visibilities , while the tapered gridded estimator uses the visibilities after gridding in the @xmath2 plane . </S>",
    "<S> the former is very precise , but computationally expensive for large data . </S>",
    "<S> the latter has a lower precision , but takes less computation time which is proportional to the data volume . </S>",
    "<S> the latter also allows tapering of the sky response leading to sidelobe suppression , an useful ingredient for foreground removal . </S>",
    "<S> both estimators avoid the positive bias that arises due to the system noise . </S>",
    "<S> we consider amplitude and phase errors of the gain , and the @xmath3-term as possible sources of errors . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the estimated angular power spectrum is exponentially sensitive to the variance of the phase errors but insensitive to amplitude errors . </S>",
    "<S> the statistical uncertainties of the estimators are affected by both amplitude and phase errors . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath3-term does not have a significant effect at the angular scales of our interest . </S>",
    "<S> we propose the tapered gridded estimator as an effective tool to observationally quantify both foregrounds and the cosmological @xmath0-cm signal .    </S>",
