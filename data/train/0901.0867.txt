    "this is possible for cosmic superstrings because string theory allows us to explicitly construct the reconnection process and compute detailed interaction properties .",

    "is found to be @xmath17    it is also likely that there will be radiation emitted during this reconnection .",
    "this can be included by using the reconnection process as a classical background trajectory @xmath18 upon which the radiation vertex operator must be integrated over @xcite .",
    "then the probability to emit a radiated state of definite momentum @xmath19 will be the probability of reconnection times a factor depending on the radiated particle under consideration , @xmath20 \\right|^2 .\\ ] ] one might also consider the possibility that the strings will pass through each other without reconnecting but still emit radiation in the process .",
    "this is a valid possibility but one in which the amplitude is suppressed by a factor of @xmath21 due to three final strings instead of two ( recall that a reconnected kinked string is considered a single string , whereas this process will produce two unconnected strings with accompanying coupling factor ) .",
    "so to leading order this process can be neglected .",
    "the reconnection trajectory was computed in @xcite by considering the vertex operator of the kinked string .",

    "the reason is that the placement of vertex operators has treated them in a non - symmetric fashion , expanding @xmath29 around the location of @xmath30 . to remedy this we simply redo the previous calculation but expand both vertex operators around the midpoint of their separation , @xmath31 a good check that this is a physically equivalent solution",
    "( i.e. obtainable via a conformal transformation @xmath32 ) is that for the massless kink state ( @xmath33 ) the polarization vector @xmath34 has merely been replaced with @xmath35 , which is a difference proportional to the wavevector @xmath36 and thus pure gauge . now combining this new kink vertex operator with symmetric relocations @xmath37 for the incoming straight - string vertex operators , the transformed trajectory is @xmath38 \\\\   & - &   i { \\alpha ' \\over 2 } p_{2l } \\left [ \\ln \\left(z+ { 1 \\over 2 } \\right ) + \\sum _ { n=1}^n \\left ( \\frac{1}{n } - \\frac{1}{n+1 } \\right ) \\left ( - \\frac{z}{2 } \\right ) ^n \\right ] \\ + \\ ( l \\rightarrow r , z \\rightarrow { \\bar z } )",

    "this simplifies in the cosmic string limit ( @xmath41 ) by performing the summation , @xmath42 we will neglect the second term since this is a good approximation for most of the parameter space , and the trajectory simplifies tremendously : @xmath43 however , the trajectory ( [ xcltemp ] ) as written is complex , due to the analytic continuation required by string theory ; we now need to transform this back into a trajectory in real space .",
    "this is easily done by recalling that vertex operators are inserted into the path integral as source terms via @xmath44 this produces a trajectory @xmath45 we see the winding term is real , and that moving around the vertex operator produces @xmath46 as desired .",
    "the momenta term , however , is purely imaginary ; this can be remedied by rotating @xmath47 , allowing us to interpret the ( logarithmic ) distance away from the vertex operator as displacement in time .",

    "our task now is to evaluate the amplitude @xmath54\\ ] ] given the trajectory ( [ xcl ] ) .",
    "as explained in more detail in section 3.1 , this problem is tantamount to determining the cosmic string s energy - momentum tensor @xmath55 damour and vilenkin investigated this quantity for classical cosmic strings @xcite , finding that it is largest when both the left- and right - moving components of the exponential have either a saddle point or discontinuity at the same location .",
    "the signal strength can then be conveniently ranked according to the phase behavior :    1 .   *",
    "cusp * : double saddle - point .",
    "* kink * : one saddle - point , one discontinuity .",
    "* reconnection * : double discontinuity .    since the contribution of radiation emitted from reconnection would appear to be a _",
    "sub_-sub - leading correction , it is not surprising that henceforth no effort has been made to explicitly calculate this .",
    "the reason we believe this is now a worthwhile endeavor is because in superstring theory the probability of reconnection @xmath56 can be greatly suppressed , @xmath57 . as discussed in more detail in the next section , this then produces a larger number of strings @xmath58 , the number of reconnection attempts now scaling as @xmath59 , and the number of successful reconnections scaling as @xmath60 .",
    "thus , as is the case for bursts from cusps , the lower the probability of reconnection , the larger the gravitational wave signal .    let us make a naive attempt to evaluate the amplitude ( [ tmunu ] ) .",
    "in examining @xmath61 in ( [ xcl ] ) , there do not appear to be any kink - like discontinuities , but there do appear to be cusps as indicated by the presence of extrema .",
    "focusing now on just the holomorphic part of @xmath61 , the cusp condition is @xmath62 rewriting this as a quadratic equation , one sees there are two solutions , @xmath63 one solution will be @xmath64 and the other @xmath65 . in the large - winding limit @xmath66 , away from these extrema",
    "the phase will oscillate wildly and so we attempt to utilize a saddle - point approximation , @xmath67 \\times ( l \\rightarrow r , z \\rightarrow { \\bar z } ) \\hspace{0.3 in } { \\rm ( naive ) } .\\ ] ] this could not be possibly be correct , as this @xmath68 spectrum indicative of simultaneous cusps does not even remotely reproduce the @xmath69 spectrum due to simultaneous kinks , which we must obtain in the classical limit .",
    "where did we go wrong ?",
    "the answer lies in the fact that our saddle - point evaluation was done at the edge of moduli space @xmath65 , where such an approximation breaks down @xcite .",
    "to evaluate the amplitude correctly , we follow kawai - lewellen - tye @xcite and write the exponential part of the amplitude explicitly : @xmath70 denoting @xmath71 , the integrand is an analytic function of @xmath72 with eight branch points : @xmath73 .",
    "the contour over @xmath72 stretches from @xmath74 to @xmath75 along the real axis , so we can then rotate it counter - clockwise to now run from @xmath74 to @xmath75 along the imaginary axis . if we then define the _ independent _ variables @xmath76 we can rewrite the integral in terms of these variables , paying special attention to the phases , @xmath77 k \\cdot p_{1l } + \\left [ \\arg ( z_l + \\frac{1}{2 } )   - \\arg(2+z_l ) \\right ]   k \\cdot p_{2l } - \\left [ \\arg ( z_r- \\frac{1}{2 } )   - \\arg(2-z_r ) \\right ] k \\cdot p_{1r } - \\left [ \\arg ( z_r + \\frac{1}{2 } )   - \\arg(2+z_r ) \\right ] k \\cdot p_{2r }   \\ } } .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]     initially lie on the real axis ( above ) and are chosen to circumnavigate the poles so as to produce the correct phases in the amplitude .",

    "once these choices have been made , of course , we are free to deform them into something more convenient for analysis .",
    "we choose to deform the contour into the complex unit circle , which we recall corresponds to zero time as shown in figure 2 .",

    "now that we have completely factored the left- and right moving components to ( [ tmunu ] ) , we are only concerned with the evaluation of the integral over the angle @xmath78 , @xmath79 defining the scale - invariant quantities @xmath80 , we can expand ( [ il ] ) in powers of @xmath4 near the points @xmath81 at which the trajectory is very nearly linear : @xmath82 e^{-ik \\cdot \\left [ \\psi \\partial_\\phi { \\hat x}_l(1 ) + \\frac{\\psi^2}{2l } \\partial_\\phi^2 { \\hat x}_l(1 ) + \\cdots \\right ] /2 }   \\\\ \\nonumber & + & \\int_{l \\pi /2 } ^{-l \\pi /2 } d \\psi \\ \\left [ \\partial_\\phi { \\hat x}_l^\\mu(-1 ) + \\frac{\\psi}{l } \\partial^2_\\phi { \\hat x}^\\mu(-1 ) + \\cdots \\right ] e^{-ik \\cdot \\left [ \\psi \\partial_\\phi { \\hat x}_l(-1 ) + \\frac{\\psi^2}{2l } \\partial_\\phi^2 { \\hat x}_l(-1 ) + \\cdots \\right ] /2 } \\\\",

    "thus in accordance with the classical expectation , we have obtained a spectrum which is scale - invariant in the large - winding limit , and which has virtually identical dependence upon the relative angle and velocity of the strings . in the last line",
    "we have written it to most resemble the classical answer plus corrections ; the terms proportional to @xmath83 are the corrections from the string path integral .",
    "of course the procedure is then repeated for the right - moving side .",
    "we must also average over all geometric possibilities for which reconnection takes place using the probability measure @xmath84 modulated by some string distribution @xmath85 and then finally to sum over polarizations . while ( [ pmeasure ] ) itself easily evaluates to @xmath86 , averaging ( [ il2 ] ) must be done numerically .",
    "though we have considered massless gravitational modes , the same procedure will work for any string mode by using the appropriate vertex operator in ( [ amp ] ) .",
    "however , analysis of the decay modes for highly - excited strings suggests that radiation into massive states is suppressed and that only massless quanta are excited @xcite .",
    "in addition to the fundamental cosmic superstrings considered here , there are also d- and @xmath87-strings produced in brane inflation which will have significantly larger tension are therefore might be capable of emitting higher - energy bursts @xcite @xcite . though the method of calculation for reconnection interactions is very different @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite , ideally their waveform could be estimated by adapting the f - string result ( [ il2 ] ) and appropriately replacing the inverse tension as @xmath88 in the bps limit , depending on the specific brane inflation model .",
    "these @xmath87 strings also form more sophisticated networks @xcite and thus would have distinctive burst patterns @xcite .      for verification and comparison",

    "if we assume the string density to be inversely proportional to the reconnection probability , at cosmic time @xmath107 the density of long strings in the scaling regime is @xcite @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the mass per unit length in strings and @xmath110 is the reconnection probability .",
    "the total energy in long strings is @xmath111 and the total length is @xmath112 , so the total number of long strings in a hubble volume at any time is @xmath113 @xcite .",
