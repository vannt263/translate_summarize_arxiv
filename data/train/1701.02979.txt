    "caching content near end - users is one of the most promising solutions proposed for next generation wireless networks such as 5 g @xcite .",
    "the main reason of the effectiveness of this approach is that a significant portion of mobile traffic is multimedia - like which makes demands predictable @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "memory hardware is much cheaper than bandwidth , and is abundantly available at mobile devices .",
    "thus , using a technique which turns memory into bandwidth ( i.e. , _ caching _ ) is of high interest .",
    "the surprising finding of @xcite shows that by careful caching at end - users the delivery bandwidth burden can be greatly relaxed by multicasting coded file chunks to these users .",
    "the main idea of this so - called _ coded caching _",
    "approach is to cache non - identical file chunks among different users , which will provide coded multicasting opportunities .",
    "this idea has been extended to other scenarios such as hierarchical caching @xcite , d2d networks @xcite , and multi - server setup @xcite .",
    "since the coded caching scheme is not originally designed for wireless scenarios ( such as 5 g ) this approach should carefully be adapted to specific characteristics of wireless channels . in order to achieve this goal",
    "we consider a multi - antenna transmitter ( e.g. , a base station ) delivering contents to multiple single - antenna receivers ( e.g. , user terminals ) , i.e. , cache - enabled miso broadcast . since the coded caching approach is designed to provide multicasting opportunities , the baseline scheme we consider is using the multiple antennas at the transmitter to design max - min fair multicast transmissions to receiver groups .",
    "the second approach we consider is employing the transmit antennas multiplexing gain to enlarge the size of multicast groups , following ideas in @xcite .",
    "we investigate this approach by assuming coded file chunks formed in both the signal domain ( complex field ) and the data domain ( finite field ) .",
    "for all the aforementioned schemes we derive delivery rate at finite snr .    it should be noticed that a conventional approach using caching in the non - cooperative traditional way would simply cache a fraction of the library at each user , and serve a number of users ( smaller than the number of transmit antennas ) via spatial multiplexing and single - user codes .",
    "in contrast to our proposed schemes , such solution does not benefit from the cooperative caching gain making it non - scalable for large networks .    while there are other works which have considered coded caching in wireless scenarios such as @xcite our paper addresses the problem at finite snr .",
    "such finite snr analysis proposes important design guidelines not revealed in earlier ( high snr ) dof analysis of wireless coded caching papers .",
    "moreover , although the paper @xcite considers a finite snr setup , in contrast to our paper , their scheme is designed for a massive mimo scenario with more transmit antennas than users . in this case , if full channel state information at the transmitter ( csit ) is available , there is no need for multicasting opportunities provided by coded caching .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : model ]",
    "we describe the model . in section [ sec : max - min ]",
    "we describe the baseline scheme of max - min fair multicasting . in sections [ sec : complexfield ] and [",
    "sec : finitefield ] we analyze multi - antenna coded caching .",
    "section [ sec : compare ] compares the three schemes , and finally , section [ sec : conclusions ] concludes the paper .    in this paper",
    "we use the following notations .",
    "we use @xmath0 to denote the hermitian of a complex matrix .",
    "let @xmath1 and @xmath2 denote the set of complex and natural numbers and @xmath3 be the norm of a complex vector .",
    "also @xmath4 $ ] denotes the set of integer numbers @xmath5 , and @xmath6 represents addition in the corresponding finite field . for any vector @xmath7",
    ", we define @xmath8 such that @xmath9 .",
    "we consider downlink transmission from a multiple - antenna base station ( bs ) with @xmath10 antennas having access to a library of @xmath11 files @xmath12 , each of size @xmath13 bits .",
    "the transmission is to @xmath14 single antenna user terminals ( ut ) . the wireless channel from the bs to the uts",
    "is represented by the matrix @xmath15 ( complex baseband discrete - time channel model ) .",
    "in addition , we consider @xmath16 to be constant over large blocks of @xmath17 channel uses in the time - frequency domain .",
    "also , we assume full csit is available , and @xmath18 .",
    "let us represent data by @xmath19-bit symbols in the finite field @xmath20 .",
    "consider a one - to - one map @xmath21 from @xmath20 to @xmath22 complex numbers belonging to a gaussian codebook @xmath23 , i.e. , @xmath24 , which constitute the transmit signal from bs antennas passed through @xmath22 channel uses .",
    "we also assume a power constraint on the codebook as follows : if @xmath25 is an @xmath19-bit symbol , then we should have @xmath26 \\leq n \\times snr$ ] . the operator @xmath21 encodes a vector of symbols element - wise . for ease of presentation",
    "we denote the encoded version of file @xmath27 with @xmath28 throughout the paper .",
    "consider @xmath22 channel uses .",
    "then , the received signal at user @xmath29 is given by @xmath30 where @xmath31 denote the received signal sequence ( over @xmath22 channel uses ) at receiver @xmath29 and the corresponding additive white gaussian noise sequence , with i.i.d .",

    "each user @xmath29 has stored in its cache a message @xmath37 , where @xmath38 denotes a function of the library files with entropy not larger than @xmath36 bits .",
    "this operation is referred to as the _ cache content placement _ , and it is performed once and at no cost . during the network operation ,",
    "users place requests for files in the library .",
    "we let @xmath39 $ ] denote the request of user @xmath29 and @xmath40 be the request vector .    upon a set of requests @xmath41 at the _ content delivery _ phase , the bs transmits a coded signal , such that at the end of transmission all users can reliably decode their requested files .",
    "notice that user @xmath29 decoder , in order to produce the decoded file @xmath42 , makes use of its own cache content @xmath43 as well as of its own received signal from the wireless channel .    in this work we focus on the worst - case ( over the users ) delivery rate at which the system can serve any users requesting any file of the library .",
    "consider the mimo channel at hand , and suppose that the coded multicasting codeword is formed by the concatenation of subcodewords @xmath44 , where each subcodeword is dedicated to a subset @xmath45 $ ] of users , of length @xmath46 bits each .",
    "let @xmath47 ( in bit / s ) denote the multicast rate at which the bs can communicate a common message to all users in subset @xmath48 .",
    "it follows that the total transmission time necessary to deliver all multicast subcodewords is given by @xmath49 } \\frac{\\mathcal{l}(u_s ) f}{c(snr , s , \\mathbf{h})}.\\ ] ]    since time @xmath50 is necessary for each user to be able to decode its own request file of @xmath13 bits , the system _ symmetric rate _ can be defined as the `` goodput '' ( useful bits per second ) at which each user is served . since each user is able to decode a file of @xmath13 bits after time @xmath50 , the per user symmetric rate is given by @xmath51 } \\frac{\\mathcal{l}(u_s)}{c(snr , s , \\mathbf{h } ) } \\right ] ^{-1}.\\ ] ]",
    "in this case , the cache content placement works exactly as in maddah - ali and niesen scheme @xcite . for the case of @xmath52 , each file is partitioned into @xmath53 non - overlapping subfiles as : @xmath54 , |\\tau| = t\\ } , \\;\\;\\;\\ ; \\forall \\;\\ ; n \\in [ 1:n].\\ ] ] each user @xmath29 stores in its cache all subfiles such that @xmath55 .",
    "these are @xmath56 , such that the cache memory is completely used since @xmath57 .    in the content delivery phase ,",
    "let @xmath40 be the current demand vector .",
    "for all subsets @xmath45 $ ] of size @xmath58 ( denoted in the following as @xmath59-subsets ) , the bs forms the coded message @xmath60    in maddah - ali and niesen proposal @xcite the bs communicates to all users simultaneously through an error free link of capacity @xmath61 bits per unit time . in this case , the coded multicast codeword consists simply of the concatenation of the coded messages @xmath62 , |s| = t + 1\\}.\\ ] ] the transmission length of @xmath63 is @xmath64 resulting in the symmetric rate @xmath65 ( consistently with our definition given before ) .",
    "now , it turns out that each coded message @xmath44 is useful only to the users in @xmath48 .",
    "therefore , each message @xmath44 can be sent by multicasting to the group of users @xmath48 . in order to do this",
    "we use a beamforming vector @xmath66 ( where @xmath67 ) which results in the following common rate for group @xmath48 : @xmath68 which can be maximized by choosing @xmath69 this optimization problem has been shown to be np - hard , however , close - to - optimal solutions can be obtained by a semidefinite relaxation ( sdr ) approach @xcite .",

    "the basic idea of the last section was to adapt the multicasting opportunities to the wireless channel via max - min fair beamforming . however , in the above scheme the spatial multiplexing gain of transmit antennas is not exploited . in this section",
    "we introduce a new scheme which exploits multiplexing and caching gains simultaneously .",
