    "effective temperature , @xmath1 , is the stellar parameter of crucial astrophysical importance .",
    "it needs to be accurately known prior to any detailed analysis of stellar structure and evolution . according to definition , effective temperature",
    "is determined from the integrated emergent energy flux which , in turn , can be calculated from the observed energy distribution and angular diameter of the star @xcite .",
    "the method can not be used on a massive scale because accurate observations of the energy distribution and angular diameters are available for a limited number of stars only .",
    "such stars serve usually as standards for calibration of other temperature measures of which most useful are color indices observed with different photometric systems . to avoid problems with measuring angular diameters indirect methods",
    "have been suggested , like the infrared flux method ( irfm ) in which the diameter can be calculated from the ratio of the observed to ( stellar ) surface monochromatic flux in infrared , assuming its weak dependence on temperature @xcite . since",
    "a large grid of realistic model atmospheres computed by @xcite has became available ( see http://kurucz.harvard.edu./grids.html ) effective temperature of a star can be determined from a fit of a theoretical emergent flux to the observed energy distribution .",
    "model atmospheres are available for a broad range of temperatures , gravities and different metal abundances ( scaled solar abundances ) .",
    "with effective temperature known , the angular diameter can be calculated from the total observed energy flux . because the energy distribution depends only weakly on surface gravity , the simultaneous determination of temperature and gravity is impractical , even in case of stars with known metallicity .",
    "surface gravity is usually determined from other data , e. g. from balmer lines or spectral type . on the other hand , energy distributions of two models with the same @xmath1 and @xmath0 but",
    "different metal abundances may differ significantly .",
    "metals produce a large number of spectral lines in the uv , which block effectively a noticeable fraction of the flux ( this is called blanketing effect ) .",
    "the blocked flux is radiated in longer wavelengths due to backwarming effect ( an increase of temperature of the corresponding atmospheric layers ) .",
    "increased metal abundance modifies the temperature distribution as a function of optical depth in a sense that temperature is higher , compared to normal metal abundance star , in layers where the visual part of the spectrum is formed and it is lower in layers where the uv part of the spectrum is formed . as a result , calibrations based on visual energy distributions of normal stars are not applicable to metal rich stars as they give systematically too high effective temperatures .",
    "stars with chemical composition deviating significantly from solar should be calibrated separately .",
    "several groups of chemically peculiar ( cp ) stars with non - solar abundances exist among upper main sequence stars @xcite .",
    "one of them is a group of magnetic cp ( mcp ) stars .",
    "they show a presence of strong , ordered surface magnetic fields with intensities up to several kilogauss @xcite , associated with large atmospheric overabundances of heavy elements , among them silicon , rare earth elements and iron peak elements @xcite .",
    "compared to other peculiar stars , e. g. hgmn , @xmath2 boo type or am stars , mcp stars show the largest deviations of spectral energy distribution ( sed ) from normal stars .",
    "the overabundant elements block effectively the uv flux which is re - radiated in longer wavelengths , similarly as in metal rich stars . however , a precise shape of sed of each mcp star depends sensitively on its detailed chemical composition . in many such stars elements",
    "are not evenly distributed over the atmosphere .",
    "instead , they show concentrations in some parts of the stellar surface ( chemical spots ) and are nonuniformly distributed in the vertical direction @xcite .",
    "all this complicates enormously modeling of their atmospheres .",
    "even if one considers only a surface averaged model of mcp star , the correct approach requires an iterative process in which the atmospheric parameters and chemical abundances are corrected at each step .",
    "such a procedure has not been so far applied to mcp stars .",
    "several years ago there have been attempts to model the observed energy distributions of a few stars with individually tailored , but fixed , chemical compositions @xcite but , due to a shortage of the modeling procedure , significant discrepancies between the observed and computed sed remained .",
    "very few individual sed of chemically peculiar stars have been modeled since then ( see http://wwwuser.oat.ts.astro.it/castelli ) .",
    "many attempts to determine effective temperatures of mcp stars can be found in literature . unfortunately , most of them are based on photometry or , at best , on visual parts of sed @xcite . as a result",
    "they are prone to systematic errors arising from peculiar sed and uncertain reddening corrections .",
    "@xcite analyzed full seds ( visual + uv from iue ) but , in lack of metal enhanced models at that time , they fitted the kurucz solar composition models to the visual parts of sed and then they calculated corrections resulting from the uv flux deficit to obtain final effective temperatures .    on the other hand ,",
    "a large volume of photometric data in different photometric systems exist for peculiar stars , which could be used to determine their temperatures if reliable calibrations exist for them @xcite .",
    "a critical analysis of some of them is given by @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to determine effective temperatures of mcp stars for which uv and visual scans exist , by fitting metal enhanced model atmospheres to dereddened ( if necessary ) sed .",
    "thus determined temperatures can be used to improve existing calibrations of photometric color indices .",
    "selection criteria for including a star into our analysis and stellar observational data are described in the next section together with the method of obtaining the final observed sed .",
    "the fitting method of model atmospheres to the observations and the results are given in section 3 together with the discussion and new calibrations in terms of the color indices from str \" omgren photometry .",
    "the last section summarizes the main conclusions .",

    "a star had to fulfill simultaneously the following criteria to be included into further analysis :    * to be classified as chemically peculiar of cp2-type @xcite , * to be observed at least once by iue with the large aperture , in low dispersion and with both , short - wavelength ( sw ) and long - wavelength ( lw ) cameras , * to be observed spectrophotometrically in visual .",
    "as a first step we folded the iue archive with 5225 objects for which required observations exist with the _ general catalog of ap and am stars _ by @xcite .",
    "this step was necessary because not all cp stars observed with iue are marked as such in the archive .",

    "however , according to the _ ines catalog _ ( see below ) , these spectra are attached to hd 192679 which is only about 0.3 of a magnitude brighter than hd 192678 and has a spectral type of f5v . apparent similarity of both stars might have caused the confusion .",

    "we decided to exclude hd 192678 from our sample .",

    "it is assumed , when reducing the observations , that those obtained with the large aperture contain a full stellar flux whereas only an unknown part of the flux is registered through the small aperture because of the vignetting effect .",
    "the precise calibration factor converting the small amplitude flux to the large aperture flux must be determined individually for each scan . without large aperture observations",
    "such an individual factor can not be found , so stars with only small amplitude spectra were excluded from our analysis .    as a first step",
    ", we checked all large aperture spectra for internal consistency .",
    "the following scans turned out to be discrepant : one sw scan of hd 19832 ( out of 39 listed in archive ) , two sw scans of hd 34452 ( out of 7 ) , and 2 lw scans of hd 98664 ( out of 3 ) . in the last case",
    "the lw scans were additionally checked against sw and visual scans .",
    "all discrepant scans were rejected .",
    "next , the average sed was formed from individual scans weighted with inverse square root of the observational error which is listed in the archive together with each measurement .",
    "measurements flagged with negative `` errors '' are outliers and were not included into the average . scaling factors for small aperture spectra",
    "were then determined from a comparison of a median value of each small aperture spectrum to a median value of the average large aperture spectrum . after multiplying all small aperture spectra by the corresponding scaling factors ,",
    "they were averaged in the same way as those obtained with the large amplitude and compared with them . in no case",
    "any systematic difference between small and large amplitude spectra was detected , hence both sets were used to obtain the ( weighted ) grand average sed .",
    "only one sw and one lw spectrum is available for hd 43819 and , unfortunately , the lw spectrum badly disagrees with the sw and visual scans .",
    "the discrepant spectrum was rejected but the star was retained .",
    "this is the only star in our analysis for which the full ( i. e. uv plus visual ) sed is not available . in the last step we calculated the values of the observed flux at the wavelengths for which model values are listed by kurucz .",
    "the latter values are given every 10 a for wavelengths shorter than 2900 a and every 20 a for the longer ones .",
    "after dividing the observed spectral range into intervals with centers corresponding to the wavelengths in which model values of fluxes are given , the weighted average value for each interval was calculated .",
    "fluxes in the overlapping wavelength interval were calculated from observations taken with both cameras , allowing for the respective errors .",
    "thus obtained seds can directly be compared with theoretical models .",
    "@xcite list several scans for each observed star .",
    "the spectral passband varies between 25 and 30 a and the number of measurements per scan varies between 30 and 50 .",
    "fluxes are given in magnitudes and always centered at nearly the same wavelengths , although small differences among the scans are present .",
    "as a first step in forming the final sed we checked the scans of each star for internal consistency . for two stars : hd 171782 and hd 215441 , additional scans corrected for interstellar absorption are also listed .",
    "we excluded them from further analysis because we applied the corresponding corrections to the whole sed of these stars ( see below ) .",
    "otherwise , the scans did not show discrepancies .",
    "next , we reduced flux values of each star to a uniform set of wavelengths using linear interpolation .",
    "for example , if most of the observations were obtained for the wavelength 5556 but in some scans values for 5550 a are given , they were interpolated to the former wavelength . then",
    ", mean seds were calculated assuming equal weights of all measurements . scans of variable stars were obtained in different phases of the variation period so the mean sed can be treated as period averaged , particularly when a substantial number of scans is available . as a next step ,",
    "the observations were converted into absolute units , using vega calibration @xcite    @xmath13    where @xmath2 is the wavelength in a , @xmath14 is the stellar flux in absolute units ( erg@xmath15s@xmath16a@xmath16 ) , @xmath17 erg@xmath15s@xmath16a@xmath16 , @xmath3 and @xmath18 = 0.026 are the magnitudes of the star and vega in @xmath3-band of the @xmath19 system , and @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the magnitudes of the star at the wavelength @xmath2 and at 5556 a.    if , instead of averaging magnitudes , we had transformed them into fluxes , the resulting differences in the mean values turned out to be negligible ( less than 0.5 % ) , compared to the procedure described above .",
    "@xcite lists observations obtained by many different observers and with different instrumentation .",
    "bandwidths used by them extend from 10 to 100 a. for eleven stars the catalog contains only one scan and for 5 of them two scans per star , extending over different spectral regions , e.g. 3000 - 5500 a and 5000 - 8000 a. the analyzed scans were first compared to those from the adelman et al .",
    "catalog ( if the latter were available ) . only in case of one scan of hd 112413 a substantial discrepancy occurred .",
    "this scan was also discordant with the uv observations so we rejected it .",
    "all the accepted scans were then reduced to absolute units in the same way as those from adelman et al .",
    "catalog and merged into one sed by averaging measurements from overlapping spectral intervals if two scans were available .    in the catalogs of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ( henceforth abgk catalogs ) from 1 to 7 scans per star are given .",
    "@xcite used the bandwidth of 100 a. we could not find any information on bandwidths used by the other authors .",
    "nearly all the observations extend from 3200 to about 8000 a but @xcite and @xcite obtained observations up to 10800 a. for consistency with other observations we ignored observations beyond 8500 a. the fluxes listed in the abgk catalogs are given in absolute units per different length units . to reduce them to the common scale we applied corresponding scaling factors .",
    "next , fluxes of each star were interpolated to a uniform wavelength set and averaged , assuming equal weights .    in all the considered catalogs the observations obtained within the balmer lines or very close to them are present . because we are interested in continuum distribution",
    "only , the observations affected by balmer lines were rejected .",
    "the remaining continuum observations were interpolated to the wavelengths listed in model computations .    because the scans from @xcite and @xcite are given on the same scale , a direct comparison of them for each star can be made .",
    "no systematic difference was found between both sets of scans for stars listed in the catalogs .",
    "a good agreement means that the temperatures obtained for stars not observed by @xcite but present in the breger catalog do not need any systematic corrections .",
    "scans from the abgk catalogs could not be directly compared with those from adelman et al . or breger catalogs ,",
    "so they were analyzed separately to keep track of any possible systematic differences .",
    "the results showed that they also agree well with the adelman et al . and breger catalogs ( see below ) .",
    "when a uv spectrum is plotted together with a visual scan , they usually do not merge smoothly .",
    "instead , a gap is often visible between them in the wavelength region around 3200 a covered by both sets of observations .",
    "visual observations were retained here because formal errors of the uv observations in the overlapping region are substantially larger than those of visual observations . in majority of cases",
    "the uv observations lie slightly lower than visual but there are also cases when they agree well and even some cases when they lie higher .",
    "small shifts between uv and visual observations result probably from calibration errors .",
    "no attempt was made to remove them .",
    "the observed sed should be corrected for interstellar absorption before fitting the theoretical sed .",
    "unfortunately , standard methods of determination the individual values of the interstellar reddening can not be applied to mcp stars due to their peculiar photometric indices @xcite .",
    "other , indirect methods , e. g. based on maps of the distribution of the interstellar matter , can also result in gross errors because interstellar dust has a very patchy structure .",
    "recent investigation of interstellar absorption for many w uma - type stars by @xcite showed that the reddening of nearby stars had been significantly overestimated by earlier authors .",
    "in fact , interstellar reddening is close to zero for stars closer than 100 pc and rarely exceeds 0.03 for distances up to 200 pc ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "based on these results we assumed zero reddening for all stars closer than 100 pc .",
    "each star lying further than 100 pc was checked individually . if literature data or maps of interstellar matter suggested @xmath22 we assumed zero reddening .",
    "we believe that the overestimate of the reddening is as dangerous for the determination of true sed as its underestimate , so in cases when no lower limit for the reddening is given , it is safer to assume zero .",
    "several stars are , however , significantly reddened and values of @xmath4 up to 0.27 mag can be found in literature .",
    "with one exception we accepted the literature values as they are , although some of them are very uncertain . for one star , hd 215441 ,",
    "the fit of the model atmosphere was so poor with the published @xmath23 that we decided to do a numerical experiment for this star by keeping the reddening as an additional free parameter to be determined from the best fit ( see 3.1 ) .",
