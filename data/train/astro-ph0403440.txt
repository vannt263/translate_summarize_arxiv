    "cold fronts were discovered as sharp features in the x - ray surface brightness distribution in chandra observations of the clusters a2142 and a3667 ( markevitch et al . , 2000 , vikhlinin , markevitch & murray , 2001a ) , see also markevitch et al .",
    "similar features have now been found in several other clusters ( e.g. sun et al . , 2002 ,",
    "kempner , sarazin & ricker , 2002 ) .",
    "unlike shocks , these features have lower gas temperature on the x - ray brighter side of the discontinuity .",
    "for that reason they are called `` cold fronts '' .",
    "it is believed that some cold fronts are formed when a subcluster merges with another cluster and the ram pressure of gas flowing outside the subcluster gives the contact discontinuity the characteristic curved shape . indeed , features resembling cold fronts",
    "are found in numerical simulations of cluster formation ( bialek , evrard & mohr , 2002 , nagai & kravtsov , 2003 ) .",
    "ablation of the gaseous cloud by the hot gas causes characteristic differential motion of the gas inside the subcluster , which transports the low entropy gas from the subcluster core towards the contact discontinuity , thus enhancing the jump in temperature and surface brightness across the discontinuity ( heinz et al .",
    "2003 ) .    here",
    "we address the question of the front stability . as was pointed out by vikhlinin et al .",
    "( 2001a , b ) , vikhlinin and markevitch ( 2002 ) the observed fronts are narrow and could be unstable to the kelvin - helmholtz ( kh ) instability .",
    "for a3667 however the front appears to be narrow ( less than @xmath05 kpc in width ) up to @xmath030from the stagnation point .",
    "magnetic fields can act as a stabilizing agent thus allowing indirect estimates of the field strength near the front ( vikhlinin , markevitch & murray,2001b ) . on the other hand numerical simulations without magnetic field ( and in particular relatively high resolution simulations by heinz et al .",
    "2003 ) do not show instability of the front within 20 - 30 .",
    "while this discrepancy could be due to numerical effects , we revisit the question of the front stability below and show that the characteristic convex geometry and finite ( small ) intrinsic width of the interface may help to stabilize the discontinuity with respect to kh instability .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we derive a simple expression for the growth of the kh instability along the curved interface . in section 3",
    "we argue that diffusion processes are likely to set an approximately constant width for the interface . in section 4",
    "we discuss astrophysical applications .",
    "the last section summarizes our findings .",
    "for an infinitely thin plane parallel interface separating semi - infinite layers of two incompressible fluids with densities @xmath1 and @xmath2 the dispersion relation for kelvin - helmholtz instability is ( landau & lifshitz , 1987 ) : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a wave number , @xmath5 is the wavelength of the perturbation , @xmath6 is the velocity of fluid with density @xmath1 , while fluid with density @xmath2 is at rest and @xmath7 .",
    "the frequency @xmath8 is measured in the frame of the fluid at rest ( i.e. with density @xmath2 ) . for cold fronts in clusters",
    "we adopt the geometry of the flow following vikhlinin et al .",
    "2001a as shown in fig.[fig : geom ] .",
    "the front has a curvature radius @xmath9 and the velocity @xmath6 along the interface is assumed to follow the law @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the angle along the interface . for the potential flow of incompressible fluid @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the velocity of the cold gas through the hot gas . for a particular case of the cold front in a3667 , vikhlinin et el .",
    "( 2001b ) argue that due to compressibility @xmath14 is more close to @xmath13 . for simplicity",
    "we assume that the densities of both fluids remain constant along the interface .",
    "consider the perturbation of the interface separating cold and hot gas . from eq.([eq : dr ] ) it follows that perturbations are advected along the interface with the increasing velocity @xmath15 , where @xmath16 .",
    "this implies that the wave number @xmath17 of the perturbation decreases as : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the wave number at some initial position @xmath20",
    ". this result can be formally obtained from the lowest order wkb ( wentzel - kramer - brillouin ) approximation ( see appendix ) , applicable if @xmath21 .",
    "apart from the exponentially growing factor , the next order wkb approximation allows one to estimate slower changes of the perturbation amplitude @xmath22 caused by the changes of the velocity along the interface and stretching of fluid elements in the azimuthal direction ( see appendix ) . for estimates",
    "we assume that @xmath23 , and @xmath24 . i.e. @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the initial amplitude",
    ".    thus one can evaluate the growth of the perturbation propagating along the interface as : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the increment of kh instability and one has to evaluate it using @xmath17 from eq.([eq : stra ] ) .",
    "an analogous expression was used by inogamov & chekhlov ( 1991 ) for the growth of perturbations for rayleigh - taylor instability . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : dr ] ) and ( [ eq : stra ] ) it is clear that the increment @xmath29 does not increase as the perturbation propagates , since the increase of the velocity amplitude is compensated by the decrease of the wave number .",
    "thus @xmath30 , where @xmath31 .",
    "replacing @xmath32 with @xmath33 one can write an explicit expression for @xmath34 : @xmath35 .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus the final expression for the growth factor for a perturbation starting at @xmath20 with the wave number @xmath36 measured at position @xmath37 is : @xmath38 |_{\\theta_1}^{\\theta_2 }    \\right \\}. \\label{eq : gft}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] one can compare this expression with eq .",
    "( 10 ) from vikhlinin & markevitch ( 2002 ) - i ) an additional factor appears in front of the exponential and more importantly ii ) the argument of the exponential is changed due to the variation of the velocity along the interface , thus * reducing the growth factor * for a fixed @xmath36 and @xmath20 .",
    "we note here that from the point of view of the degree of nonlinearity of a perturbation one can use the ratio of the amplitude to the wavelength : @xmath39 . therefore the expression for the degree of nonlinearity of a perturbation will contain an additional factor proportional to @xmath40 in front of the exponential .    alternatively , since @xmath41",
    ", we may regard the growth factor as a function of @xmath42 specified at the angle @xmath37 .",
    "the formal condition for the growth factor ( 5 ) to diverge for small @xmath20 is @xmath43 .",
    "thus in spite of the * suppression * of the growth factor for a fixed * initial * wave number , the growth factor can be infinitely large for a fixed * final * wave number .",
    "there are however several factors which can limit the growth of instability .",
    "we argue below that a small , but finite , thickness of the interface is the most important factor in the conditions relevant for cold fronts in clusters .",
    "any real interface can not be infinitely thin . if the thickness of the interface is @xmath44 , then only modes with @xmath45 are unstable .",
    "thus for a fixed @xmath37 and @xmath46 the minimum angle at which kh instability starts is such that @xmath47 . in section 3 we argue that diffusive processes across the interface may set a finite thickness of the interface , which is almost independent of the position ( angle ) .",
    "one can approximately account for the finite width of the interface by using @xmath48 as a lower bound in eq.([eq : gft ] ) .",
    "but in fact the largest contribution to the growth factor comes from small angles and this part of the integral has to be evaluated more accurately than simply introducing a cutoff in @xmath11 .",
    "one can use for instance the dependence of increment on the wave number and thickness in the form given by rayleigh ( see `` the theory of sound '' , e.g. 1945 edition ) for two fluids with similar densities : @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the condition for instability .",
    "thus the growth factor is : @xmath51 where @xmath52 is such that @xmath53 . in this case",
    "the growth factor has to be calculated numerically . in fig.[fig : growth ] we show the total growth factor calculated for several values of @xmath37 and @xmath44 . for @xmath54",
    "30the instability grows very strongly if the thickness of the interface is less than @xmath01.5 - 2% of the curvature radius .",
    "we note that all the above expressions for the growth factor do not depend explicitly on the absolute value of @xmath14 , indicating that the appearance of the front may be similar for clouds moving with different velocities , if the relation between the width and the curvature of the interface is the same .",
    "an interesting question is if the nonlinear evolution of kh instability itself can be responsible for establishing the width of the interface ( along the lines of reasoning given by nulsen , 1982 ) of order of few percent of @xmath9 , smoothing an interface and suppressing growth of longer modes .",
    "we leave this question for subsequent studies and in the next section consider the width of the interface set by diffusion .",
    "for flow past a flat plate ( with high reynolds number ) the width of the boundary layer is known to vary as the square root of the distance @xmath55 from the front edge of the plate ( blasius law ) : @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the viscosity . for a rounded body ,",
    "the flow velocity increases linearly with distance from the stagnation point , @xmath58 , making the width of the boundary layer constant ( landau & lifshitz , 1987 ) .",
    "thus @xmath59 , where @xmath9 is the curvature radius . substituting further @xmath60 , where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the rms velocity and mean free path for ions and assuming that @xmath63 one gets an order of magnitude estimate of the expected width @xmath64 . in the absence of magnetic field the viscosity of the hot gas is larger than for the cold gas and most of the velocity drop may take place on the hotter side in the form of a broad layer .",
    "we note here that observationally it is almost impossible to `` see '' such a layer .",
    "analogously one can consider the case of a scalar diffusion ( e.g. thermal conduction ) with a constant diffusion coefficient @xmath65 .",
    "assuming that conditions inside the cloud ( where the fluid is not moving ) are frozen and seeking a stationary solution of a diffusion equation in outer gas it is easy to show that @xmath66 .",
    "both expressions , when applied to the case of a3667 and compared with the upper limit on the front width ( vikhlinin et al . , 2001a ) , indicate significant suppression of transport processes across the front .",
    "more accurate calculations and a detailed comparison with observations are beyond the scope of this paper and will be reported elsewhere . in what follows",
    "we assume that the interface has a constant width independent of @xmath11 and the expression ( [ gfray ] ) for the growth factor is applicable .",
    "we now apply the above results to the particular case of the cold front in a3667 .",
    "we set the following parameters based on the results of vikhlinin et al .",
    ", 2001a , b , vikhlinin & markevitch 2002 : @xmath67 kpc , @xmath68 , @xmath69 .",
    "they give the width of the front ( upper limit ) in terms of the standard deviation of a gaussian smoothing , as @xmath70 kpc . in our notation , @xmath71 . in fig.[fig : a3667 ] we plot the growth factor calculated for several values of @xmath72 and angle @xmath37 .",
    "this is largely the same figure as fig.[fig : growth ] but now in natural units . for comparison",
    "we show ( upper dotted curve ) the growth factor calculated for an infinitely thin interface , assuming fixed wave number @xmath17 and @xmath7330 .",
    "one can see that accounting for varying wave number and the finite thickness of the interface ( within the observational limits , i.e. @xmath70 kpc ) drastically reduces the growth factor . for these reduced values",
    "it is not obvious that small initial perturbations can grow strongly nonlinearly and disturb the sharp appearance of the front around @xmath5430 . for larger angles or for smaller widths of the interface",
    "the growth factors are large .      while we assumed above that the gas inside the cloud is still , internal motions are likely to appear during the formation of the front and especially during later periods of the cloud evolution when continuous stripping at the sides of the cloud is compensated by the cold gas flow along the interface to replenish the losses .",
    "e.g. in simulations by heinz et al .",
    "( 2003 ) the velocity of the gas inside the cloud @xmath00.2 of the velocity of the surrounding gas at the moment when the morphology of the front and the temperature distribution resemble those observed in a3667 as follows from the bernoulli equation .",
    "due to gravity the velocity of the motions in cold gas should be lower . ] .",
    "the internal motions have a two - fold effect : i ) they reduce the shear rate and ii ) they increase the group speed of the perturbation in the interface , both of which reduce the total growth of a perturbation arriving at the angle @xmath37 .",
    "accounting for internal motions can easily reduce the argument of the exponential in equation ( [ gfray ] ) by 30 - 50% thus strongly reducing the final growth factor compared to fig.[fig : a3667 ] .      in the above discussion",
    "we have completely neglected the role of gravity , although we assumed that it plays an important role in preserving the integrity of the cold cloud when it passes through the hot gas . for an infinitely thin interface",
    ", gravity modifies the dispersion relation ( [ eq : dr ] ) to : @xmath74 where @xmath75 is gravitational acceleration . for a fixed @xmath42 and @xmath37 and",
    "given that @xmath76 and @xmath77 the role of gravity is more important for small angles @xmath11 , effectively introducing a lower limit on @xmath20 .",
    "the growth factor calculated with the above dispersion relation and using the values of @xmath75 and @xmath14 from vikhlinin & markevitch ( 2002 ) is very large , implying that gravity does not strongly suppress kh instability , in agreement with their conclusion .    for an interface of finite thickness",
    ", gravity makes the region near the stagnation point stable for perturbations of any @xmath17 .",
    "one can estimate the richardson number of the flow assuming that density and velocity both vary over a layer of thickness @xmath44 : @xmath78 the sufficient condition for stability is @xmath79 everywhere in the flow . again plugging in the numbers from vikhlinin & markevitch ( 2002 ) we find that for @xmath80 kpc the front is stable up to angles of @xmath06,11,14respectively .",
    "simple estimates show that account for this stable region would further reduce the growth factor compared to fig.[fig : a3667 ] , although not dramatically .",
    "this is expected given that gravity alone ( for the thin interface case - see above ) does not strongly suppress kh instability .",
    "accurate calculations of the growth factor taking account of gravity and the finite thickness of the interface require knowledge of the density and velocity profiles of the interface and are beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we note only that stretching of the flow in the stable region near the stagnation point insures that initial perturbations in the unstable regions further downstream are small .",
    "since we are considering motion near the stagnation point the velocities are small compared to the gas sound velocity ( even for colder gas ) and compressibility does not play a significant role .",
    "further downstream the compressibility starts to be more important and it reduces the growth factor of the perturbation ( see dispersion relation in miles , 1958 , gerwin , 1968 or nulsen 1982 ) .",
    "e.g. for the density ratio @xmath81 the quantity @xmath82}{\\rm re[\\omega]}$ ] is equal to @xmath83 for small shear velocity and it drops to @xmath84 when the shear velocity approaches the sound speed of the colder gas ) is proportional to this factor ] .",
    "we have shown that accounting for wave number changes along the curved interface and finite ( but small ) width of the interface significantly reduces the kh instability growth factor .",
    "we also argue that if diffusion sets the intrinsic width of the interface then this width does not vary much along the interface ( at least for small angles ) .    for a set of parameters relevant for the front in a3667",
    "the growth factor is not large enough to guarantee nonlinear growth at angles @xmath030 , provided that the intrinsic width of the front is of the order of a few percents of the curvature radius ( i.e. not much less than the existing observational limit ) .",
    "therefore dynamically important magnetic fields may not be necessary to stabilize this particular cold front .",
    "the growth factor ( and therefore possible limits on the magnetic fields ) * depends critically on the width of the interface * and much more weakly on the angular extent over which the front remains sharp .",
    "a factor of 2 - 3 improvement in the observational constraints on the interface width is therefore extremely important .    for a given width of the interface the value of the growth factor does not depend strongly on the absolute value of the shear velocity .",
    "this probably explains the ubiquity of fronts both in observations and hydrodynamical simulations .",
    "we are grateful to sebastian heinz , rashid sunyaev and alexey vikhlinin for numerous useful discussions .",
    "we would like to thank the referee , paul nulsen , for a number of important and constructive comments and suggestions .",
