    "for an ideal scintillator , the number of optical photons produced by a gamma ray is linearly proportional to the energy deposited in the scintillator by the gamma ray .",
    "however , many scintillators exhibit nonproportionality in their response , especially for gamma - ray energies below 100  kev  @xcite .",
    "nonproportionality is typically defined by the ratio of the scintillation yield for a particular energy deposit to the scintillation yield due to complete energy deposit for a 661.7 kev gamma ray from a @xmath1cs source .",
    "measurements of nonproportionality in the response of bismuth germanate ( bgo ) in the following energy ranges have been reported : 4.5 kev to 662 kev  @xcite , 6 kev to 1332 kev  @xcite , 14 kev to 1330 kev  @xcite , 60 kev to 662 kev  @xcite , and 11 kev to 100 kev  @xcite .",
    "we report new measurements in the energy range from 6 kev to 662 kev .",
    "our measurements and comparison to prior results were motivated by an experiment to study the radiative decay mode of the free neutron .",
    "we reported the first observation of this process in a pilot experiment in which gamma - rays were detected by a single bgo crystal  @xcite . to accurately test theoretical predictions for the photon energy spectrum",
    ", a higher precision experiment has been performed with a 12-element bgo detector  @xcite .",
    "analysis of this experiment requires both monte carlo modeling of the energy deposit spectrum in the bgo crystals and understanding of the light yield from bgo . for our minimum detectable gamma ray energy deposit of @xmath05 kev",
    ", the nonproportionality for bgo is an important source of uncertainty .",
    "hence we performed measurements to determine the nonproportionality observed for our crystals , temperature , electronics , and other operating conditions .",
    "our results were determined by both tests on a single bgo crystal with radioactive sources in a small test cryostat and with radioactive sources illuminating a 12-element detector in our apparatus for neutron beta - decay .",
    "in addition , the multi - element detector allowed for an additional measurement approach in which for any given crystal , a continuum of background gamma rays incident on the other 11 crystals produced escaping bismuth k x - rays that are detected by that given crystal .",
    "this particular determination of nonproportionality at the bi k x - ray energy ( mean of 78.7 kev ) was performed in a magnetic field of 4.6  t. as in prior published studies , we determined the nonproportionality by comparing the center of the peak in the pulse height spectrum for a given gamma - ray energy deposit @xmath2 , @xmath3 , to that expected based on linear scaling from the center for the 661.7 kev gamma rays from a @xmath1cs source , @xmath4 .",
    "this definition applies for sufficiently high photoelectron yields so that a symmetric peak is obtained , which applies to all of our results except the @xmath5fe source results presented at the end of the paper . for this definition",
    ", the measured nonproportionality @xmath6 at energy @xmath2 expressed in percent is given by    @xmath7    hence for a ideal scintillator , @xmath6 is unity for all energies . in sec .",

    "[ concl ] we summarize the paper .",
    "the test cryostat apparatus has been previously described in its use for studies of apd response  @xcite . for these nonproportionality studies ,",
    "a 12 mm by 12 mm by 200 mm bgo crystal @xcite coupled to an apd with an active area of 13.5 mm by 13.5 mm  @xcite was thermally sunk to the bottom of the inner reservoir of a cryostat ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : photos ] ) . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the opposite end of the bgo crystal was painted with reflective paint to improve the light collection efficiency .",
    "the long sides of the bgo crystal were covered by two layers of aluminized mylar ( total of 12.4 @xmath8 m mylar and 0.065 @xmath8 m aluminum ) .",
    "the long - side regions near the end faces ( @xmath012 mm ) had additional layers of polytetrafluoroethlyene ( ptfe ) tape and aluminized mylar for mechanical protection .",
    "( @xmath0300 @xmath8 m ptfe and 6 @xmath8 m mylar with 0.033 @xmath8 m aluminum ) .",
    "the cryostat s vacuum jacket included a 3.5 cm diameter tube with a 7 cm diameter metal - sealed flange through which we illuminated the crystal about midway along its 200 mm length ( see right side of fig .",
    "[ fig : photos ] ) . the light collection efficiency for gamma rays incident at different locations along this crystal can vary by @xmath0  8  % from the center , with greater light collection efficiency obtained at either end of the crystal .",
    "this geometric effect is independent of the incident energy  @xcite . for these nonproportionality tests , the tubing for the vacuum port and the cryostat itself provided sufficient collimation to ensure that only the central region of the crystal was illuminated . for the highest energy ( thus most penetrating ) source , this",
    "was confirmed by a check with additional collimation that consisted of 1.2 cm thick , 2.8 cm tall copper pieces clamped in place above and below the horizontal 3.5 cm tube .",
    "an oil - free turbomolecular pumping station was used to reduce the pressure in the chamber to a typical base pressure of on the order of 10@xmath9 mbar . upon filling the cryostat with liquid nitrogen , the typical pressure was on the order of 10@xmath10 mbar .",
    "the apd signal was sent to a charge - sensitive preamplifier@xcite , followed by an amplifier set for a gain of 100 and a 6  @xmath8s shaping time constant .",
    "the output of the shaping amplifier was registered by a multichannel analyzer ( mca)@xcite . the lower level discriminator of the mca was typically set slightly below the detector noise level at @xmath0 10 channels , for a 1000-channel full range of @xmath01000  kev .",
    "the apd was operated at a typical bias of 1380  v ( @xmath040  v below breakdown ) . using studies with a precision pulser",
    ", we found that our electronics for the test cryostat apparatus exhibited a slight nonlinearity that was consistent with an offset of one channel out of 1000 in the mca . to determine the bgo nonproportionality , we corrected for this nonlinearity , which yielded a shift of 4.3  % for our lowest energy datum at 23.3 kev , decreasing to 1  % at 60 kev .",
    "a thin polyimide window in the side port allowed the sources to be outside the cryostat vacuum space so they could be easily manipulated .",
    "the gamma - ray energies and sources employed in the test cryostat apparatus are listed in table  [ table : sources ] . a @xmath1cs source was used to provide the 662 kev reference .",
    "the mean energy deposit listed was determined for multiple - line emissions from the following components in kev , using the weighting percentages  @xcite in parentheses : @xmath11cd - 22.1 , 25.1 ( 83.7 * 0.026 , 17.7 * 0.078 ) ; @xmath12ba - 30.6 , 31.0 , 35.1 , 35.9 ( 54 , 100 , 29 , 7 ) ; @xmath13gd - 97.4 , 103.2 ( 29 , 21 ) ; and @xmath14co - 122.1 , 136.5 ( 85.5 , 10.7 ) . for the low energy lines of the @xmath11cd source , the weighting included the factors shown to account for energy - dependent transmission through a 0.25 mm thick stainless steel cover on this particular source . to evaluate the nonproportionality ,",
    "the pulse height spectrum for a given emission was fit with a single gaussian , except for the multiple - line emissions noted above for which multiple - line gaussians were employed . in the case of multiple - line emission",

    "as in the test dewar , each crystal is coupled to an apd with an active area of 13.5 mm by 13.5 mm . however , the electronic processing and spectrum analysis were different than that performed for the test dewar studies .",

    "a @xmath1cs source was used to provide the 662 kev reference line for lines from a @xmath12ba ( nominally 31 kev , 81 kev , and 356 kev ) and a @xmath14co source ( 122 kev and an x - ray escape peak at 43 kev ) .",
