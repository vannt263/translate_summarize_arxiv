    "supersymmetry ( susy ) is a promising candidate for physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "it stabilizes the big hierarchy between the planck scale and the electroweak scale ( 1 part in @xmath2 for the squared mass scale ) .",
    "furthermore , the minimal supersymmetric extension of the sm ( mssm ) predicts a precise gauge coupling unification .",
    "it is also equipped with a natural candidate of the dark matter . in 2012 ,",
    "atlas and cms collaborations discovered the higgs boson , the last missing piece of the sm @xcite .",
    "its mass is 125 gev @xcite , which means that the self - coupling of the higgs boson is perturbative .",
    "this perfectly matches with the prediction of the minimal susy .",
    "susy is such a wonderful theory with full of conceptual successes .",
    "however , now it is facing with an annoying little fine - tuning problem. lhc run i has finished and it did not find any sign of the colored susy particles .",
    "the lower bound of the mass of the gluino is now roughly 1.4 tev .",
    "those of the first / second generation squarks and the third generation squarks are about 1 tev and 700 gev in simplified models ( for example see , @xcite ) . among them , the masses of the gluino and stops are mixed up with @xmath3 , the susy breaking mass parameter of the higgs boson , via the renormalization group evolution . without fine - tuning the initial conditions , they are expected to be similar in their sizes . while in the mssm , the z boson mass , @xmath4 which represents the scale of the electroweak breaking is determined as , @xmath5 with @xmath6 expansion . here",
    "@xmath7 is the susy preserving higgsino mass whose origin is in most cases different from @xmath3 .",
    "this means that @xmath8 gev is the result of a fine - tuning between @xmath3 and @xmath9 worse than 1% .",
    "a possible solution of this problem is a susy breaking mediation mechanism which , with some underlying reasons , exactly realizes @xmath10 at the electroweak scale , simultaneously with the gluino and stops as heavy as @xmath11 tev or more ( little susy hierarchy ) .",
    "tev scale mirage mediation is proposed as one of such mechanisms @xcite@xcite . in the mssm",
    ", it alleviates the problem considerably , however , suffers from several problems , in particular after the discovery of the higgs boson . in this talk",
    ", we argue that the tev scale mirage mediation in the next - to - minimal susy sm ( nmssm ) provides a novel solution for this little susy hierarchy problem and discuss its phenomenology focusing on the precision higgs measurement @xcite .",
    "the mirage mediation is a susy breaking mediation mechanism based on supergravity @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "it is inspired by the kklt flux string compactification @xcite , however , not necessarily assumes strict string realizations .",
    "it is a combination of well - known two mechanisms , the modulus mediation @xcite and the anomaly mediation @xcite .",
    "the order parameter of the former is the modulus mediated gaugino mass , @xmath12 and that of the latter is the gravitino mass @xmath13 .",
    "the modulus mediation is a tree - level effect in supergravity , while the anomaly mediation works at loop - level .",
    "thus , the latter is negligible if @xmath14 .",
    "however , the kklt type modulus stabilization predicts @xmath15 and both of them give the leading effect @xcite .",
    "the important feature of the mirage mediation is the mirage unification @xcite .",
    "the renormalization group corrections to the modulus mediated susy breaking cancel with the anomaly mediation at the mirage unification scale , @xmath16 at one - loop level .",
    "then , the boundary conditions for the modulus mediation appear at @xmath17 , not at the unification scale .",
    "@xmath18 is essentially given by the ratio of @xmath12 and @xmath13 , @xmath19 .",
    "it is determined by the scaling dimension of the uplifting potential against the modulus field in supergravity .",
    "considering its underlying geometrical origin , @xmath18 is not arbitrary but typically given by a ratio of small integers . if @xmath20 , the boundary conditions for the modulus mediation appear around the electroweak scale .",
    "they are given by , @xmath21 with the soft susy breaking lagrangian , @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the mass of the gaugino @xmath24 , while @xmath25 is the mass of the sfermion @xmath26 .",
    "@xmath27 is the @xmath28 term for the yukawa coupling constant , @xmath29 .",
    "@xmath30 is the modular weight for @xmath26 and given by a ratio of small integers again reflecting a geometrical origin of @xmath26 .",
    "in addition , we also have uncontrollable threshold corrections depending on the detail of the uv theory @xcite . for the cancellation of the renormalization group running , a sum rule ,",
    "@xmath31 is required for non - negligible yukawa coupling constants , @xmath32 .",
    "if the uv theory chooses @xmath33 , we obtain the desired little hierarchy at the electroweak scale up to the threshold corrections and 2-loop effects in the renormalization group running .",
    "this is the tev scale mirage mediation scenario .",
    "tev scale mirage mediation can considerably ameliorate the little susy hierarchy problem , however , it has two problems in the mssm .",
    "the first problem is the @xmath34 problem inherent with the model based on the anomaly mediation .",
    "the @xmath35 term which appears in the higgs potential has a tree - level contribution of the order of @xmath36 .",
    "thus , we need a delicate cancellation with another contribution to realize @xmath37 @xcite@xcite .",
    "the second problem is the higgs boson mass .",
    "it is difficult to achieve the 125 gev higgs boson with @xmath38 tev because the a - term for the top yukawa coupling is fixed by the sum rule .",
    "the extension to the nmssm can solve these two problems .    in the nmssm",
    ", we introduce a singlet supermultiplet @xmath39 to the mssm @xcite@xcite .",
    "the superpotential for the nmssm is given by , @xmath40 where we impose @xmath41 symmetry to forbid liner and quadratic terms of @xmath39 and @xmath42 . to eliminate the domain wall formed in the early universe , @xmath41 symmetry must be broken by some higher dimensional operators .",
    "we also have the yukawa couplings of quarks and leptons as in the mssm . in the following",
    ", we will use the same notation for the supermultiplet and its scalar component .",
    "after the scalar component of @xmath39 develops a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) , the higgs fields obtain the effective @xmath7 term , @xmath43 .",
    "the size of @xmath44 is controlled by the soft susy breaking terms .",
    "thus as is well known , @xmath7 problem in the mssm is solved in the nmssm @xcite .",
    "the @xmath35 term of the mssm is also replaced with @xmath45 and its size is the order of @xmath12 in the mirage mediation .",
    "then the first ( @xmath34 ) problem of the mirage mediation is solved @xcite . in the nmssm",
    ", we have a new quartic coupling , @xmath46 in the higgs potential .",
    "this helps to raise the higgs boson mass if @xmath47 is small .",
    "also the mixing between the singlet and doublet higgs fields pushes the mass of the sm - like higgs boson if the singlet is lighter than the doublet .",
    "these features are useful to solve the second problem in the mirage mediation .",
    "we apply the tev scale mirage mediation to the nmssm @xcite .",
    "we consider a model with the following modular weights for fields in the nmssm , @xmath48 we assume the same modular weights for three generations of quarks and leptons .",
    "for the top yukawa coupling and @xmath49 , the sum rule is satisfied , while it is violated for @xmath50 and the bottom yukawa coupling .",
    "then , we are only interested in the parameter region with small @xmath50 and small / moderate @xmath47 . in any case , we need small @xmath50 to evade the landau pole if we want to have large @xmath49 for raising the higgs mass .",
    "the large @xmath47 region is also excluded by the lep chargino mass bound .",
    "thus their corrections to the mirage unification are actually small .",
    "we have chosen the above modular weights because the fine - tuning of the ( effective ) @xmath7 term is considerably ameliorated @xcite . in the context of the natural susy @xcite , @xmath51 is often quoted as a spectrum to solve the fine - tuning problem in ( [ eq : fine - tuning ] ) and predicts a light higgsino .",
    "however , even if we have @xmath52 with the heavy susy spectrum for some reason , we need another mechanism to fine - tune @xmath53 because its origin is somehow related with the susy breaking and thus belongs to the heavy spectrum . the doublet higgs mass matrix of the model at the origin of the potential is given by , @xmath54 where @xmath55 .",
    "the trace of the mass matrix is given by @xmath56 while @xmath12 cancels in the determinant as @xmath57 .",
    "thus the mass of the light doublet , @xmath58 is suppressed as @xmath59 , while that of the heavy doublet , @xmath60 is @xmath61 .",
    "this corresponds to the cancellation of the second and the third terms in the formula , @xmath62 thus the electroweak scale @xmath4 is insensitive to @xmath7 in the model and mostly determined by @xmath63 .",
    "@xmath7 can be as large as @xmath64 without deteriorating the fine - tuning .",
    "the sum rule @xmath65 in the nmssm and @xmath66 are essential for this cancellation .",
    "note that a similar mechanism works in the mssm , however , the @xmath35 term is a remnant of the cancellation and vulnerable to uncontrollable corrections .    in the nmssm ,",
    "mixing with the singlet may destroy the above nice feature .",
    "in addition it also causes phenomenological problems .",
    "if the lightest cp even higgs boson is doublet ( sm ) like , the mixing with the singlet reduces the higgs boson mass and makes it difficult to achieve 125 gev .",
    "if the lightest cp even higgs boson is singlet like , the mixing with the doublet tightens the constraint from the lep higgs boson search because it couples with the @xmath67 boson via the mixing .",
    "however , we find that , in the model with @xmath68 and @xmath69 like we are considering , this mixing is suppressed due to approximate scale symmetries @xcite . in the limit , @xmath70 and @xmath71 , the model has the following approximate scale symmetry , @xmath72 which is explicitly broken by the khler potential @xmath73 , the d - term potential and all the kinetic terms .",
    "the vevs of @xmath74 breaks the symmetry and the light doublet is the corresponding nambu - goldstone ( ng ) boson which is inherently a mass eigen state .",
    "thus the mass and the mixing with the singlet must pick up the explicit breaking . while in the @xmath70 and @xmath75 limit",
    ", the model has another approximate symmetry in which @xmath39 and @xmath76 are exchanged in the above formulas .",
    "the ng boson is a mixture of @xmath39 and @xmath77 and its mass and the mixing with @xmath76 also need to pick up the explicit breaking . thus the mixing between the light doublet and the singlet must pick up the explicit breaking terms of the both symmetries or a term breaking both of them because it vanishes if either of the symmetries survives .",
    "in addition , the mixing disappears if @xmath77 decouples and it must be suppressed by @xmath78 ( thus , only @xmath50 or the gauge coupling is not enough to generate the mixing ) .",
    "therefore the doublet - singlet mixing is expected to be highly suppressed at classical level in the model .",
    "in the following we show the results of our numerical calculations .",
    "we solve the one - loop renormalization group equations from the unification scale to the susy scale , assuming the boundary condition ( [ eq : boundary - condition ] ) in addition with the contribution from the anomaly mediation .",
    "we adopt these solutions for the susy spectrum and the large parameters , however , discard them for the small parameters , @xmath3 , @xmath79 , @xmath7 and @xmath80 .",
    "we rather deal them as free parameters at the susy scale , taking into account the ambiguities stemming from the threshold corrections and two - loop renormalization group running .",
    "then we solve the minimum of the one - loop effective higgs potential in terms of them so that we obtain the observed value of @xmath4 .",
    "we accept the solutions if they are within the range of the ambiguities .",
    "we fix @xmath80 to a reference value @xmath81 gev because there are not enough equations to determine it .",
    "we use the ` nmssmtools ` package for calculating the physical mass spectrum @xcite .",
    "we have three cp - even , two cp - odd and one charged higgs bosons .",
    "the heaviest cp - even , cp - odd and charged higgs bosons correspond to the heavy doublet and have almost degenerate masses @xmath82 .",
