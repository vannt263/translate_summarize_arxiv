    "a central problem for the latter case is to determine the overall statistically steady propagation rate of the wrinkled front , which exceeds the average local speed because the front is defined by the fastest paths through the medium ( first passage ) .",
    "our main result , establishing under general conditions the proportionality of the speedup to the 4/3 power of the amplitude of weak fluctuations , agrees with previous heuristic analysis @xcite and numerical simulations @xcite , and eliminates ambiguities @xcite concerning the physical relevance of the scaling . in the important case of premixed fluid combustion",
    ", the result describes the weak - advection scaling of the turbulent burning velocity @xcite .",
    "our analysis relates the front dynamics to the evolution of a pressure - free fluid obeying the white - noise - driven burgers equation , itself a widely studied model of turbulence @xcite .",
    "the results reported here enable adaptation of existing treatments of burgers turbulence @xcite to estimate the prefactor of the speedup scaling and its dependence on medium structure , with implications even for the opposite , practical limit of strongly advected flames .",
    "the propagation of a huygens front in a general nonuniform medium is governed by the local advecting velocity of the medium as a function of time and space , @xmath0 , and the local speed of propagation relative to the medium , @xmath1 .",
    "huygens principle can then be stated as follows ( using three - dimensional language for definiteness ) : if at time  @xmath2 a point  @xmath3 lies in the affected region ( including its boundary , the front ) , then at a slightly later time @xmath4 all points in a ball of radius @xmath5 about the point @xmath6 are affected .",
    "the boundary of the affected region at  @xmath7 ( the new front ) thus consists of certain points on the surfaces of balls originating from the initial front .",
    "if we consider all points on these spherical surfaces , then we automatically include those on the new front and more .",
    "hence the front at any later time will be found among the affected points reached by arbitrary trajectories @xmath8 that start on the initial front and always move at the local speed @xmath9 ( in any direction ) relative to the medium , so that they obey @xmath10    two simplifications of this general framework are physically important .",
    "first , for geometrical optics in a static or `` quenched '' medium with nonuniform refractive index , or for combustion of a solid propellant with nonuniform burning rate , we have @xmath11 ( time - independent fluctuations ) and @xmath12 ( no advection ) .",
    "note that our nonrelativistic equations do not correctly describe advection of light anyway , but are adequate for an optical medium `` at rest '' ( where fluctuations of  @xmath9 dominate those of  @xmath13 ) and for advection of sound in geometrical acoustics .",
    "second , for idealized combustion of a premixed turbulent fluid in the limit of a very thin flame front @xcite , @xmath9  is a constant ( the laminar flame speed ) and @xmath0 is the turbulent flow ( assumed to be unaffected by the flame ) . following the derivation of our key results in sections",
    "[ fronts ] and [ weak ] , further implications for combustion are discussed in section  [ concl ] .",
    "in the general case , eq .  ( [ huygens ] ) defines a large family of `` virtual '' trajectories @xmath8 of which only a subset actually form the front at a given time .",
    "the criterion for the relevant trajectories is simplest if @xmath14 everywhere , as we now assume ( in section  [ concl ] we discuss relaxing this assumption ) .",
    "this inequality , which is trivially satisfied for a quenched medium , ensures that advection can never sweep the front backward and thus that each point @xmath15 is crossed by the front only once .",
    "the time of this crossing , which we call @xmath16 , is simply the time when the first virtual trajectory reaches @xmath15 , hence defining a first - passage problem .    to reduce the number of extraneous trajectories",

    "such a fluid is described by the inviscid burgers equation ( with suitable forcing ) and the collisions are known as shocks @xcite . because our particles fill a surface and not all of space , we must define the corresponding burgers fluid more precisely .",

    "<S> front propagation described by huygens principle is a fundamental mechanism of spatial spreading of a property or an effect , occurring in optics , acoustics , ecology and combustion . if the local front speed varies randomly due to inhomogeneity or motion of the medium ( as in turbulent premixed combustion ) , then the front wrinkles and its overall passage rate ( turbulent burning velocity ) increases . </S>",
    "<S> the calculation of this speedup is subtle because it involves the minimum - time propagation trajectory . </S>",
    "<S> here we show mathematically that for a medium with weak isotropic random fluctuations , under mild conditions on its spatial structure , the speedup scales with the 4/3 power of the fluctuation amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> this result , which verifies a previous conjecture while clarifying its scope , is obtained by reducing the propagation problem to the inviscid burgers equation with white - in - time forcing . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , field - theoretic analyses of the burgers equation have significant implications for fronts in random media , even beyond the weak - fluctuation limit .    ,    front propagation , random media , geometrical optics , turbulent combustion , burgers equation 02.50.ey , 42.15.dp , 47.70.fw </S>"
