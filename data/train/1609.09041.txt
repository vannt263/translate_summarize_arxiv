    "the field of superconducting quantum circuits ( sqc ) is a highly active field of research with outstanding progress over the last decade .",
    "typically , the circuits are operated at microwave frequencies and therefore profit from commercially available low - noise amplifiers .",

    "also , the bipartite entanglement of the emitted light modes allows one to detect low reflectivity objects in quantum illumination protocols more efficiently than in the classical case  @xcite .",

    "we study jpas consisting of a superconducting coplanar waveguide resonator short - circuited to ground by a dc - squid .",
    "in particular , we investigate how the resonant frequency of five jpas with different screening parameters of the constituent dc - squid depends on the magnetic flux threading the dc - squid loop . from numerical simulations of the dc - squid potential , we find that the flux dependence of the jpa resonant frequency is , in general , hysteretic for arbitrary screening parameters of the dc - squid and find good agreement with experimental observations .",

    "<S> josephson parametric amplifiers ( jpa ) have become key devices in quantum science and technology with superconducting circuits . in particular </S>",
    "<S> , they can be utilized as quantum - limited amplifiers or as a source of squeezed microwave fields . here , we report on the detailed measurements of five flux - driven jpas , three of them exhibiting a hysteretic dependence of the resonant frequency versus the applied magnetic flux . </S>",
    "<S> we model the measured characteristics by numerical simulations based on the two - dimensional potential landscape of the dc superconducting quantum interference devices ( dc - squid ) , which provide the jpa nonlinearity , for a finite screening parameter @xmath0 and demonstrate excellent agreement between the numerical results and the experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we study the nondegenerate response of different jpas and accurately describe the experimental results with our theory . </S>"
