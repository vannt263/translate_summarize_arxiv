    "with the static color charges one observes on the lattice a color - electric flux tube @xcite , which , if the distance between the static quarks is large , can be approximated as a string .",
    "this string is nondynamical ( in the sense that its ends are fixed ) . in the light quark systems",
    "a crucial aspect is a relativistic motion of quarks at the ends of a possible string .",
    "there is no consistent theory of the dynamical qcd string with quarks at the ends .",
    "it is even apriori unclear whether such a picture has something to do with reality . in this case",
    "the chiral symmetry as well as its dynamical braking should be relevant .",
    "both confinement and chiral symmetry breaking dynamics are important for the hadronic mass generation .",
    "their interplay is responsible for a rather complicated structure of the hadron spectra in the light quark sector .",
    "a large degeneracy is seen in the highly excited mesons @xcite , which is , however , absent in the observed spectrum below 1.8 gev .",
    "the low - lying hadron spectra should be strongly affected by the chiral symmetry breaking dynamics .    in order to disentangle the confinement physics from the chiral symmetry breaking dynamics we remove on the lattice from the valence quark",
    "propagators the lowest - lying quasi - zero modes of the dirac operator keeping at the same time the gluon gauge configurations intact @xcite .",
    "indeed , the quark condensate of the vacuum is related to a density of the lowest quasi - zero eigenmodes of the dirac operator @xcite :    @xmath2    we subtract from the valence quark propagators their lowest - lying chiral modes , which are a tiny part of the full amount of modes ,    @xmath3    where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenvectors of the dirac operator .",
    "given these reduced quark propagators we study the existence of hadrons and their masses upon reduction of the lowest - lying modes responsible for the chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "in contrast to refs .",
    "@xcite , where a chirally not invariant wilson lattice dirac operator was employed , we adopt now @xcite a manifestly chiral - invariant overlap dirac operator @xcite .",
    "the quark propagators were generously provided by the jlqcd collaboration @xcite .",
    "for some technical details of the work we refer the reader to ref .",
    "at this first stage of the study we have investigated the ground state and the excited states of all possible @xmath6 isovector @xmath7 mesons , i.e. , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 .",
    "an exponential decay of the correlation function is interpreted as a physical state and its mass is extracted .",
    "the quality of the exponential decay improves with the reduction of the lowest modes . the evolution of masses of the ground and excited states upon reduction of the low - lying modes is shown in fig . 1 .",
    ".the complete set of @xmath11 @xmath7 states classified according to @xmath0 .",
    "the symbol @xmath12 indicates the states belonging to the same representation @xmath13 that must be degenerate in the chirally symmetric world . [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]        all possible multiplets of the @xmath0 group for the @xmath7 mesons are shown in table 1 @xcite . in the chirally symmetric world",
    "there must be two independent @xmath15-mesons that belong to different chiral representations .",
    "the first one is a member of the @xmath16 representation .",
    "it can be created from the vacuum only by the operators that have the same chiral structure , e.g. by the vector - isovector current @xmath17 .",
    "its chiral partner is the axial vector meson , @xmath18 , that is created by the axial - vector isovector current .",
    "when chiral symmetry is restored this @xmath15-meson must be degenerate with the @xmath18 state .",
    "another @xmath15-meson , along with its chiral partner @xmath19 , is a member of the @xmath20 representation .",
    "it can be created only by the operators that have the same chiral structure , e.g. by @xmath21 .    in the real world",
    "( i.e. with broken chiral symmetry ) each @xmath15-state ( i.e. @xmath15 and @xmath22 ) is a mixture of these two representations and they are well split . upon subtraction of 10 lowest modes",
    "we observe two independent degenerate @xmath15-mesons .",
    "one of them couples only to the vector current and does not couple to the @xmath21 operator .",
    "the other @xmath15 meson - the other way around .",
    "this means that one of these degenerate @xmath15-states belongs to the @xmath16 multiplet and the other one is a member of the @xmath20 representation .",
    "a degeneracy of the @xmath23 @xmath15-meson with the @xmath18 meson is a clear signal of the chiral @xmath0 restoration .",
    "consequently , a similar degeneracy should be observed in all other chiral pairs from table 1 .",
    "the @xmath1 symmetry transforms the @xmath24 state into the @xmath20 @xmath15-meson @xcite .",
    "their degeneracy indicates a restoration of the @xmath1 symmetry .",
    "we conclude that simultaneously both @xmath0 and @xmath1 symmetries get restored .",
    "the restored @xmath25 symmetry requires a degeneracy of four mesons that belong to @xmath26 and @xmath20 chiral multiplets @xcite , see table [ tab : t1 ] .",
    "this symmetry does not require , however , a degeneracy of these four states with other mesons , in particular with @xmath18 and its chiral partner @xmath15 .",
    "we clearly see the latter degeneracy .",
    "this implies that there is some higher symmetry , that includes @xmath27 as a subgroup .",
    "this higher symmetry requires a degeneracy of all eight mesons from the table [ tab : t1 ] .",
    "all these eight mesons can be combined to a reducible @xmath6 representation , which is a product of two fundamental chiral quark representations @xcite : @xmath28 \\times [ ( 0,1/2)+(1/2,0 ) ] = \\hspace{15 mm } \\nonumber\\\\ ( 0,0 ) + ( 1/2,1/2)_a + ( 1/2,1/2)_b + [ ( 0,1)+ ( 1,0)]\\;.\\hspace{4mm}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] they exhaust all possible chiralities of quarks and antiquarks , i.e. , their spin orientations , as well as possible spatial and charge parities for non - exotic mesons .",
    "the observed degeneracy of all these eight mesons suggests that the higher symmetry , mentioned above , should combine the @xmath1 and the @xmath29 rotations in the isospin space with the @xmath30 spin - symmetry .",
    "the latter one is due to independence of the energy on the orientations of the quark spins .",
    "the higher symmetry group that combines all eight mesons from the table 1 into one multiplet of dimension 16 should be @xmath31 .",
    "the quark - spin independence of the energy levels implies that there are no magnetic interactions in the system , i.e. , the spin - orbit force , the color - magnetic ( hyperfine ) and tensor interactions are absent @xcite .",
    "the energy of the system is entirely due to interactions of the color charges via the color - electric field and due to a relativistic motion of the system .",
    "we interpret ( or define ) such a system as a dynamical qcd string .",
    "note a significant qualitative difference with the case of a motion of an electrically charged fermion in a static electric field or with a relative motion of two fermions with the electric charge .",
    "in the latter cases there exist spin - orbit and spin - spin forces that are a manifestation of the magnetic interaction in the system . in our case",
    "such a magnetic interaction is absent , which implies that both quarks are at rest with respect to the electric field ( that moves together with quarks ) .",
    "it is this circumstance that suggests to interpret ( define ) our system as a dynamical qcd string .",
    "the observed radial levels at the truncation energy 65 mev , at which we see the onset of the symmetry , are approximately equidistant and can be described through the simple relation @xmath32 the extracted value of the radial string excitation quantum amounts to @xmath33 mev . at the moment",
    "we can not exclude , however , the quadratic relation @xmath34 , because the excited level can be shifted up due to rather small finite lattice volume .",
    "there is an interesting aspect of the dynamical qcd string that crucially distinguishes it from the nambu - goto open string .",
    "the energy of the the nambu - goto open bosonic string is determined by its orbital angular momentum @xmath35 , @xmath36 .",
    "for the dynamical qcd string that contains chiral quarks at the ends the orbital angular momentum @xmath35 of the relative motion is not conserved @xcite .",
    "for instance , two orthogonal @xmath15-mesons at the same energy level are represented by the mutually orthogonal fixed superpositions of the @xmath37- and @xmath38-waves .",
    "@xmath39      i am very grateful to m. denissenya and c. b. lang for our common efforts in lattice simulations .",
