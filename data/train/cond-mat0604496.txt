    "l. d. landau s `` fermi liquid theory '' provides a robust and accurate description of the leading low temperature , long wavelength behavior of a wide range of systems of interacting fermions in two and three spatial dimensions . in landau s original work",
    "@xcite it was assumed that the temperature ( @xmath5 ) and momentum ( @xmath6 ) corrections to the leading fermi liquid behavior were analytic functions of @xmath7 and @xmath8 , with the fermi momentum @xmath9 set by the inter - particle spacing and the fermi temperature @xmath10 with @xmath11 a typical measured electron velocity .",
    "however , subsequent work revealed that in dimensions @xmath12 and @xmath13 the leading temperature and momentum dependences of measurable quantities including the specific heat and spin susceptibility are in fact non - analytic functions of @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the nonanalyticities have been studied in detail for galilean - invariant systems ( spherical fermi surface or circular fermi line ) ( see ref   for a list of references ) . in this paper",
    "we extend the analysis to a more general class of systems , still described by fermi liquid theory but with a fermi surface of arbitrary shape .",
    "the extension is of interest in order to allow comparisons to systems such as @xmath4 @xcite and quasi - one - dimensional organic conductors @xcite , in which lattice effects are important .",
    "the extension also provides further insight into a fundamental theoretical issue : a crucial finding of the previous analysis @xcite was that for two dimensional systems the non - analytical term in the specific heat coefficient @xmath16 arise solely from `` backscattering '' processes at any strength of fermion - fermion interaction . for the spin susceptibility ,",
    "the situation is more complex : in addition to the backscattering contributions to @xmath17 and @xmath18 there are contributions of third and higher order in the interaction which involve non - backscattering processes @xcite .",
    "if the interaction is not too strong the backscattering terms dominate .    unlike scattering at a general angle ,",
    "the kinematics of backscattering is effectively one - dimensional , and depends sensitively on the shape of the fermi surface .",
    "we shall show that the crucial parameter is the fermi surface curvature , and that for two dimensional systems in which the fermi surface possesses an inflection point , the power laws change from @xmath19 to @xmath20 or @xmath21 according to whether the inflection point is or is not along a reflection symmetry axis of the material .",
    "similar effects occur in three dimensional systems , but the effects will be weaker as the singularities there are only logarithmic .",
    "the importance of the fermi surface geometry was previously noted by fratini and guinea , who showed that the presence of inflection points changes the power law for the spin susceptibility @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "however , we believe that their calculation treated the kinematics of the backscattering incorrectly ; as a result , they found that , in @xmath23 , the presence of the inflection point changes the temperature dependence only by a logarithm , from @xmath24 to @xmath25 , instead of the @xmath26 found here .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii introduces the model and defines notation . in section iii",
    ", we demonstrate the physical origin of the results , via a calculation of the long range dynamical correlations of a fermi liquid .",
    "section iv presents results for the specific heat of a multiband system . in section",
    "v we calculate the nonanalyticities in the momentum and temperature dependence of @xmath27 .",
    "section vi shows how new power laws emerge for fermi surfaces with inflection points , and why one - dimensionality affects the powers .",
    "section vii presents estimates of the size of the nonanalytic terms in @xmath4 .",
    "section viii is a conclusion .",
    "we study fermions moving in two dimensions in a periodic potential . as discussed at length in ref .",
    "[ ] , because we are concerned with the low @xmath5 properties of a fermi liquid we may adopt a quasiparticle picture .",
    "lifetime effects are not important , and the quasiparticle weight ( @xmath28 ) factors may be absorbed in interaction constants .",
    "we may therefore consider several bands , labeled by band index @xmath29 , of quasiparticles moving with ( renormalized ) dispersion @xmath30 .",
    "the fermi surfaces are defined by the condition @xmath31 ; an example is shown in fig [ fsfig ] .",
    "we parameterize the position at the fermi surface by a coordinate @xmath32 . for vectors @xmath33 near a particular fermi surface point @xmath34 we will write@xmath35 with @xmath36 the fermi velocity at the point @xmath37 and the components of @xmath33 parallel and perpendicular to the fermi velocity ( fermi surface normal ) given by    @xmath38",
    "@xmath39 is the curvature of the fermi surface at the point @xmath32 . for a circular fermi surface , @xmath40 independent of @xmath41 ; but",
    "in general @xmath42 and both depend on @xmath41 .",
    "it is sometimes convenient to use the variables @xmath43 and @xmath44 , where @xmath44 is the angle determining the direction of the fermi velocity @xmath45 relative to some fixed axis .",
    "eq [ ep ] shows that the jacobean of the transformation is @xmath46    in a non - galilean - invariant system the fermi surface may contain _ inflection points _ at which the curvature vanishes , i.e. @xmath47 . if the inflection point does not lie on an axis of reflection symmetry of the brillouin zone , the dispersion ( measured in terms of the difference of the momentum from an inflection point ) is @xmath48 however , if the inflection point lies on a symmetry axis , then only even powers in @xmath49 may occur and @xmath50 here @xmath51 and @xmath52 are coefficients expected in general to be @xmath53 .",
    "the fermions interact .",
    "we assume that the @xmath54 , long wavelength properties are described by the fermi liquid theory , so that at low energies the interactions may be parameterized by the fully reducible fermi surface to fermi surface scattering amplitude @xmath55 . for particles near the fermi surface ,",
    "@xmath56 , and @xmath57 depends on the angle @xmath58 between @xmath59 and @xmath60 and on the band indices @xmath29 ( for @xmath61 ) and @xmath62 ( for @xmath63 ) .",
    "backscattering corresponds to @xmath64 .",
    "it is often useful to decompose @xmath65 into charge and spin components @xmath66    it is also instructive to make contact with second order perturbation theory for a model in which the particles are subject to a spin - independent interaction @xmath67 with charge density operator @xmath68 the leading perturbative result is then @xmath69    if the interaction is local and only one band is relevant , i.e. , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72",
    "previous studies of the isotropic case demonstrated  @xcite that the nonanalyticities in the specific heat and spin susceptibility arise from the long spatial range dynamical correlations characteristic of fermi liquids .",
    "these are of two types .",
    "one involves slow ( @xmath73 ) long wavelength fluctuations and is expressed mathematically in terms of the long wavelength limit of the polarizibility @xmath74 .",
    "the @xmath75 behavior of polarizibility gives rise to a long - range correlation between fermions which decays as @xmath76 at distances @xmath77 .",
    "the other involves processes with momentum transfer @xmath78 , and is expressed mathematically in terms of the polarizibility @xmath79 ( for @xmath80 .",
    "the @xmath81 behavior of @xmath82 gives rise to an oscillation with a slowly decaying envelope , @xmath83 , again at distances @xmath84 and again leading to singular behavior .",
    "we now compute these processes in the multiband model defined above , and then show how they affect thermodynamic variables .    consider the long wavelength process first .",
    "the non - analyticity comes from a particle - hole pair excitation in which both particle and hole are in the same band , and have momenta in the vicinity of fermi surface points @xmath85 satisfying @xmath86 .",
    "choosing one of these points as the origin of coordinates we have @xmath87 performing the integral over @xmath88 and the matsubara sum as usual yields @xmath89 we see that for the part of @xmath82 which is even in @xmath90 the integral is indeed dominated by @xmath91 , so the approximation of expanding near this point is justified , and we obtain the nonanalytic long wavelength contribution as a sum over all fermi points @xmath85 satisfying @xmath92 with coefficients determined by the local fermi velocity and local curvature : @xmath93 for a circular fermi surface , two points satisfy @xmath94 , @xmath40 and eq .",
    "( [ pilong ] )  reduces to the familiar result @xmath95 .",
    "if the curvature vanishes , then use of eqs ( [ ep_1 ] ) or ( [ ep_11 ] ) in eq ( [ pi0 ] ) yields a @xmath96 respectively .",
    "we next consider the `` @xmath97 '' process .",
    "here the situation is a little different .",
    "the singularities in general come from processes connecting two fermi points with parallel tangents ( the importance of parallel tangents points has been noted in other contexts @xcite)for example the points @xmath98 or @xmath99 shown in fig [ fsfig ] . for a given vector @xmath100",
    "we denote as @xmath101 the closest vector which is parallel to @xmath100 and connects two `` parallel tangents '' points .",
    "symmetry ensures that the leading dependence of @xmath102 involves only the @xmath103 .",
    "labeling the initial and final of the two fermi points connected by @xmath104 as @xmath105 and noting that for systems with inversion symmetry the points come in pairs symmetric under interchange to the band indices we have @xmath106 here the _ sign _ of @xmath107 and @xmath108 becomes important . for two points",
    "`` on the same side '' of the fermi surface ( e.g. points @xmath109 and @xmath110 in fig [ fsfig ] ) the two velocities and the two curvatures have the same sign ( a change of @xmath88 either increases or decreases both energies ) , the integrations proceed as in the analysis of eq ( [ pi0 ] ) , and the different position of the @xmath6 means that to the order of interest there is no singular non - analytical term . on the other hand ,",
    "if the two velocities have opposite sign ( e.g. points @xmath109 , @xmath111 in fig [ fsfig ] ) then after integrating over @xmath88 and @xmath49 we obtain ( for @xmath112 ) @xmath113 here @xmath114 , and @xmath115 completing the evaluation yields @xmath116 the singular @xmath117 behavior of the dynamic @xmath118 only holds when @xmath119 and is obtained by expanding ( [ new_2 ] ) in @xmath120 . on the contrary , the singular behavior of the static @xmath121 holds at @xmath122 the dynamic part of @xmath123 behaves as @xmath124 at @xmath125 .",
    "this section treats the non - analyticity in the specific heat .",
    "the galilean - invariant case studied previously is simple enough that the corrections can be evaluated , with no approximations beyond the usual ones of fermi liquid theory @xcite .",
    "the evaluation confirms that in two dimensions the non - analytical contributions to the specific heat involve only the backscattering amplitude @xmath126 . in work prior to that reported in ref [ ] this conclusion was reached by approximate calculations in which it was assumed that the non - analytical contributions were governed by the backscattering amplitude only , and then the assumption was shown _ a fortiori _ to be consistent . in the non - galilean - invariant case of interest here ,",
    "a complete analysis along the lines of ref [ ] is not possible .",
    "we will follow earlier work and assume that the effects arise only from backscattering processes , and then show that the assumption is self consistent .",
    "we specialize for ease of writing to a momentum - independent vertex @xmath57 ( see ( [ new_1 ] ) ) , but keep band indices . for a two - dimensional system",
    "the diagram which gives the nonanalytic term in the thermodynamic potential @xmath127 is @xcite shown in fig [ omega ] .",
    "we may write the resulting diagram schematically as @xmath128 now , singularities leading to non - analytical terms may arise for @xmath129 , in which case we must consider only the intraband contribution to @xmath130 , and @xmath131 , where @xmath104 is one of the `` parallel tangents '' vectors mentioned in the previous section , in which case the band indices of polarizabilities may be different .",
    "let us consider first the small @xmath6 singularities .",
    "we have @xmath132 substituting from eq ( [ pilong ] ) gives @xmath133 the integral over @xmath6 is logarithmic and is cut by @xmath90 ; the analytical continuation and integral of frequencies may then be performed and we obtain @xmath134    we now turn to the parallel tangents part of the calculation , finding @xmath135 note that the symmetry of the vertex means that @xmath136 . again substituting @xmath123 instead of @xmath137 and evaluating the integrals",
    "explicitly we find  @xcite ( note that to obtain the non - analytical behavior it is sufficient to expand @xmath138 for @xmath139 ) @xmath140 now noting that @xmath141 and that @xmath142 we see that @xmath143 and @xmath144 give identical contributions despite the apparently different kinematics .",
    "adding the two contributions , we obtain @xmath145 note that the integrals over the fermi surface contain @xmath146 rather than the product of two @xmath108 factors at different points along the fermi surface .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the fact that only backscattering contributes to ( [ eq32 ] ) and ( [ eq33 ] ) . for a one band model with an isotropic fermi surface , eq .",
    "( [ apr4_1 ] ) reduces to the result in @xcite . for a generic interaction ,",
    "the calculation goes through as before with @xmath147 replaced the components of the fully renormalized , symmetrized fermi surface to fermi surface backscattering amplitude so that @xmath148",
    "= 0.8      this section presents calculations of the non - analytical momentum and temperature dependence of the spin susceptibility of a two dimensional non - galilean - invariant fermi liquid system . with a fermi surface without inflection points .",
    "in contrast to the specific heat , there are two classes of contributions to the nonalnayticities in the susceptibility @xcite .",
    "one is of second order in the fullly renormalized interaction amplitudes , involves only the backscattering , and is treated here .",
    "the other , which we do not study here , is of third and higher orders , and involve averages of the interaction function over a wide range of angles ( analogously to similar contributions to the specific heat of a _ three _ dimensional fermi liquid @xcite ) .",
    "the former process is dominant at weak coupling , and involves an integral of the square of the curvature over the fermi arc .",
    "the latter process has a less singular dependence on the curvature .    even to the order at which we work , many diagrams contribute ( see fig [ diagramsforchi ] ) ; we evaluate one in detail to illustrate the basic ideas behind the calculation and then simply present the result for the sum of all diagrams . consider for definiteness the `` vertex correction '' diagram  diagram 3 in figure [ diagramsforchi ] .",
    "the analytical expression corresponding to this diagram is ( we use a condensed notation in which ( dk ) stands for an integral over momentum , normalized by @xmath149 , and a sum over the corresponding matsubara frequency ) @xmath150 and @xmath151 is the product of the interaction vertices and internal polarization bubble : @xmath152 \\label{lambdadef}\\ ] ] where @xmath58 is the angle between @xmath59 and @xmath60 , and we have used the fact that @xmath59 and @xmath60 are near the fermi surface .",
    "a complete calculation in the galilean - invariant case shows that , just as for the specific heat , the non - analytical momentum dependence of the susceptibility arises from the regions of small @xmath153 and @xmath154 .",
    "we consider these in turn .      here",
    "we choose a particular point @xmath155 on the fermi surface and integrate over @xmath43 and the corresponding frequency .",
    "we parametrize the position on the fermi surface by the angle @xmath156 between @xmath157 and @xmath100 and use eq [ jacobean ] .",
    "we adopt coordinates @xmath158 and @xmath159 denoting directions parallel and perpendicular to @xmath160 and obtain @xmath161 we may similarly evaluate @xmath151 , proceeding from eq ( [ lambdadef ] ) .",
    "choosing as origin the point @xmath162 , defining coordinates @xmath163 and @xmath164 antiparallel and perpendicular to @xmath165 , integrating over @xmath163 and the corresponding loop frequency gives @xmath166    viewed as a function of @xmath158 the second line in eq ( [ chismallq1 ] ) decays rapidly ( @xmath167 ) at large @xmath158 and has poles only in the half plane @xmath168 .",
    "evaluation of the @xmath158 integral by contour methods , closing the contour in the half plane @xmath169 shows that nonanalyticities can only arise from singularities of @xmath151 .",
    "reference to eq ( [ lambda2 ] ) shows that these can only arise from momenta @xmath60 satisfying @xmath170 . in the galilean - invariant case",
    "the integral could be evaluated exactly ; the resulting non - analytical terms were found to be determined by a very small region around @xmath162 , i.e. , around @xmath64 in ( [ lambdadef ] ) .",

    "is based on an expansion for small @xmath173 .",
    "the integrals over these quantities are cut off by other physics above a cutoff scale @xmath151 which we have written as a hard cutoff .",
    "the ellipsis denotes other terms arising from physics at and beyond the cutoff scale , which lead to additional , regular contributions to @xmath177 involving positive , even powers of @xmath6 .",

    "@xmath185 , @xmath107 is a constant , and eq .",

    "produce an expression with all poles in the same half plane . exploiting the non - analyticity of @xmath190 we obtain an expression which has a nonanalytic part which evaluates to the same expression as eq ( [ chi3 ] ) . instead of presenting the details of this calculation",

    ", @xmath205 has to be replaced by @xmath206 .",
    "higher order powers of @xmath57 do contribute to @xmath207 and @xmath5 terms in @xmath208 , in distinction to @xmath209 , and at strong coupling , the non - analytic terms in the spin susceptibility are not expressed entirely via @xmath210  @xcite .",
    "the terms of order @xmath211 have a less singular dependence on the curvature . at weak and moderate coupling ,",
    "though , eqs . ( [ eq32 ] ) and ( [ eq33 ] ) should be sufficient .",

    "we see from eq .

    "new physics , however , emerges when the fermi surface develops inflection points at which @xmath213 diverges .",
    "inflection points are a generic feature of realistic fermi surfaces of two dimensional materials . in this section",

    "we therefore conclude that for chemical potentials in the appropriate range inflection points must exist because the curvature has opposite sign at two points on the fermi surface .",

    "the curvature diverges , i.e. , there is no quadratic term in the expansion of the quasiparticle energy in deviations from the fermi surface . in the generic case , the dispersion is then @xmath238 where , as before , the directions @xmath88 and @xmath49 are along and transverse to the direction of the fermi velocity at @xmath237 . for a special situation",

    "each integral diverges logarithmically , and the correction would then scale as @xmath266 .",
    "the emergence of the anomalous power of temperature or momenta for a generic inflection point in our calculations is the direct consequence of the one - dimensionality of the relevant interaction .",
    "we see therefore that the anisotropy of the fermi surface is an ideal tool to probe the fundamental 1d nature of the non - analyticities in a fermi liquid .",
    "a crucial and so far unresolved question related to the results reported here and in previous papers is the observability of the effects .",
    "evidence for the @xmath269 nonanalyticities expected in three dimensional materials have been observed in the specific heat of @xmath270 @xcite ( indeed this observation played a crucial role in stimulating the theoretical literature ) and similar effects have been noted in the specific heat of the heavy fermion material @xmath271 @xcite .",
    "more recently , a linear in @xmath5 behavior has been observed in the specific heat of fluid monolayers he@xmath272 adsorbed on graphite  @xcite , but to our knowledge no evidence for nonanalytic terms in the susceptibility has been reported .",
    "we consider here @xmath4 , a highly anisotropic layered compound for which detailed information about the shape of the fermi surface , the quasiparticle mass enhancements , the susceptibility and optical conductivity is available @xcite .",
    "these data imply @xcite that the material is `` strongly correlated '' , in the sense that fermi velocities and susceptibilities are substantially renormalized from the predictions of band theory .",
    "the data also suggest that the dynamical self energy is at most weakly momentum - dependent , because the shapes of the fermi surface deviate only slightly from those found in band structure calculations , implying that the self energy has a much stronger frequency dependence than momentum dependence .",
    "we extract fermi surface shape and fermi velocities from quantum oscillation data @xcite and cross - check with photoemission data where available .",
    "we use available susceptibility @xcite and optical data @xcite to estimate the interaction functions .",

    "the relevant electrons are the three @xmath281 symmetry @xmath282 d - orbitals and there are accordingly three bands at the fermi surface , conventionally labeled as @xmath283 . the fermi surface _ shape _ , shown in fig [ fsfig ] is well described by the two dimensional tight binding model @xmath284 ( couplings in the third dimension are an order of magnitude smaller ) .",

    "they also present results for the mass enhancements in each fermi surface sheet , which may be converted into experimental estimates for @xmath285 .",
    "the shape , of course , does not depend on the magnitudes of the tight binding parameters .",

    ".tight binding band parameters ( in [ ev ] ) which reproduce the shape and , approximately , the fermi velocities of the three bands at the fermi surface of @xmath4 .",

    "first , the calculated @xmath287 band properties depend very sensitively on how close the @xmath287 ( @xmath288)-derived band approaches the van hove points @xmath289 , @xmath290 .",
    "published band calculations @xcite show wide variations in the position of the the singularity relative to the fermi level .",
    "second , the @xmath291 derived from the specific heat involves both the velocity and the geometrical properties of the fermi surface .",
    "the mass for the @xmath292 band is small because of its small size , even though its velocity is relatively small .",
    "third , and most important , the curvature of the @xmath293 bands depends very sensitively on the parameters @xmath294 ; the velocities also depend somewhat on these parameters .",
    "a recent angle - resolved photoemission experiment @xcite reports that the @xmath292 band fermi velocity at the zone face crossing point is @xmath295 ; the parameterization used here gives an essentially identical value .",
    "we now turn to the landau interaction function .",
    "a complete experimental determination is not available , but considerable partial information exists .",
    "bergemann and co - workers @xcite have determined , for each band , the spin polarization induced by a uniform external magnetic field , so the @xmath296 spin channel landau parameters may be estimated .",
    "optical conductivity data @xcite provide some information on the @xmath297 spin - symmetric channel current response .",
    "general arguments suggest that the charge compressibility is only weakly renormalized in correlated oxide materials , allowing a rough estimate of the @xmath296 charge channel interaction .",
    "we will use this information to estimate the scattering amplitudes and hence the nonanalytic terms in the susceptibilities .",
    "these estimations are certainly subject to large uncertainties , but we hope they will give a reasonable idea of the magnitude of the effects .    in the three - band material of present interest the interaction function is a symmetric @xmath298 matrix with components @xmath299 labelled by orbital or band indices , which should then be decomposed into charge ( symmetric ) and spin ( antisymmmetric ) components and into the angular harmonics appropriate to the tetragonal symmmetry of the material .",
    "we begin with the isotropic @xmath296 spin channel .",
    "we assume ( consistent with the usual practice in transition metal oxides ) that the deviations from @xmath300 symmetry , while crucial for electronic properties such as the band structure and conductivity , are not crucial for the local interactions , which arise from the physics of the spatially well localized @xmath301 electrons .",
    "this implies that the interactions are invariant under permutations of orbitals , so that it is reasonable to assume that the two - particle irreducible spin channel interaction takes the simple slater - kanamori form with two parameters , which we write as @xmath302 and @xmath303 .",
    "thus the physical static susceptibilities are given by @xmath304 and fix the parameters @xmath305 and @xmath306 by comparing measured susceptibilities to the values predicted by the renormalized tight binding parameters .",
    "ref @xcite presents ( as mass enhancements ) data for the spin susceptibility of each band ( obtained from the spin splitting of the fermi surfaces ) ; finding @xmath307 , @xmath308 and @xmath309 .",
    "we estimate @xmath310 and @xmath311 , where @xmath312 is the susceptibility implied by the quantum oscillations fermi surface and mass .",
    "this implies that the dimensionless landau interaction parameters ( in the limit @xmath313 limit @xmath314 @xmath315    the uncertainties in the off diagonal components are large , perhaps @xmath316 , but because the interactions enter squared , the contribution of the off diagonal components is not very significant .",
    "the dominant term is the @xmath317 band interaction , as expected because it has the largest mass and the largest susceptibility enhancement , but that all of the other contributions taken together make a non - negligible contribution to the interaction .",
    "finally , we note that the spin channel renormalizations are not large , so use of the second order result is not unreasonable .",
    "we now turn to the charge channel , beginning with the compressibility .",
    "there is no experimental information available .",
    "however , it is generally believed that for systems , such as transition metal oxides , with strong local interactions the total charge susceptibility is not strongly renormalized , so that the landau parameter acts to undo the effects of the mass enhancement .",
    "further , if the @xmath318 ( orbital non - diagonal ) component of the interaction is not too small relative to the @xmath319 ( orbital diagonal component ) then a residual interaction acts to shift the levels such that the ratio of occupancies of each of the three @xmath281 orbitals remains constant under chemical potential shifts . taking as unrenormalized value the susceptibilities folllowing from the tight binding parameters given in ref @xcite we then obtain @xmath320 with again considerable uncertainty in the off diagonal components .    finally , we turn to the current renormalization . the optical conductivity is commonly presented in the extended drude form @xmath321 where @xmath322 is the mean interplane spacing and @xmath323 has the meaning of an optical mass enhancement defined with respect to a reference value determined by @xmath324 . in a fermi liquid at low temperatures , @xmath325 is very small and ( assuming tetragonal symmetry ) @xmath326 note that the numerical value of the mass enhancement @xmath327 depends on the choice of reference value @xmath324 but that @xmath328 is a physically meaningful quantity determined directly from the data .",
    "the room temperature conductivity of @xmath4 has been measured @xcite .",
    "these authors chose the value @xmath329 ( which they denote as @xmath330 ) to correspond to @xmath331 and find @xmath332 ( which they denote as @xmath333 ) to be @xmath334 .",
    "this implies that @xmath335 , somewhat smaller than the value @xmath336 obtained from eq [ ddef ] , implying that the average over all bands is @xmath337 .",
    "the temperature dependence of @xmath328 in @xmath4 has not been measured , but it seems reasonable that @xmath328 should decrease as @xmath5 decreases , implying a further increase in the magnitude of @xmath338 .",
    "determining the temperature dependence of the optical mass is therefore an important issue .",
    "ref @xcite presents , as masses , data for the cyclotron resonance frequencies for the different fermi surface sheets .",
    "these masses should be essentially equivalent to the @xmath328 values quoted above .",
    "bergemann et .",
    "emphasize that the frequencies are subject to large errors , and that the results should be regarded as tentative .",
    "the quoted cyclotron masses correspond to @xmath328 values about a factor of two larger than those implied by the measured fermi velocities , and about a factor of @xmath339 larger than the values inferred from the optical data . in view of the stated large uncertainties in the measurement and the qualitative incosistency with the optical data ,",
    "we disregard the cyclotron resonance measurements here .",
    "now , the crucial object for the specific heat is the backscattering amplitude .",
    "a negative @xmath338 implies a positive backscattering amplitude , so as a rough approximation to the effects of the current channel landau renormalization we add the interaction corresponding to @xmath340 to the diagonal components of eq [ fc ] .",
    "the crucial points emerging from this analysis are that the reducible interactions in the charge channel are of order unity , whereas those in the spin channel are somewhat smaller , implying a larger nonanalyticity in the specific heat than in the susceptibility . substituting the interaction amplitudes into eqs .",
    "[ apr4_1_1 ] , [ eq33 ] and performing the fermi surface averages then yields the following estimates @xmath341\\right ) \\\\",
    "\\chi(t)[si / volume]&=&1.5\\times 10^{-4 } \\left(1-.00001 t[k]\\right)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the small magnitude of the corrections ( especially to the spin susceptibiltiy ) follows from the small prefactors in eq ( [ eq33 ] ) and the not too large landau renormalizations .",
    "the size of the effect is increased by the relatively small curvatures of the @xmath292 and , especially , @xmath342 bands , and we note that substantial increases in the coefficients occur if the mixing coefficients @xmath294 in eq [ eab ] are reduced . we expect the results to be valid above a ( still not well determined ) scale probably @xmath343 at which the fermi surface warping becomes important enough to make the material three dimensional , and below the scale at which fermi liquid theory breaks down , and we see that temperatures of order @xmath344 lead to @xmath345 deviations in the value of the specific heat coefficient and to @xmath346 changes in @xmath27 .",
    "replacing @xmath347 by @xmath348 leads to a dramatic ( factor @xmath349 in @xmath350 ) enhancement of the susceptibility .",
    "it seems likely that this increase is not due to a decrease in the fermi velocities , but must be interpeted as a dramatic increase in the spin landau parameter , suggesting perhaps that nonanalytic @xmath5-dependence of @xmath27 might be more easily observed in @xmath348 doped materials , although in this case disorder effects would need to be considered .",
    "in this paper , we studied non - analytic terms in the spin susceptibility and specific heat in 2d systems with anisotropic , non - circular fermi surfaces . for systems with circular fermi surfaces , the non - analytic terms in @xmath351 and @xmath209 are linear in @xmath352 .",
    "we argued that the anisotropy of the fermi surface serves as a testing ground to verify the theoretical prediction that the non - analytic terms originate from a single 1d scattering amplitude which combines two 1d interaction processes for particles at the fermi surface in which the transferred momenta are either @xmath353 or @xmath354 , and , simultaneously , the total moment is zero .",
    "we obtained explicit expressions for the non - analytic momentum and temperature dependences of the spin susceptibility and the specific heat in systems with non - circular fermi surfaces and demonstrated that for the fermi surfaces with inflection points , the the non - analytic temperature and momentum dependences are @xmath355 , @xmath356 in a generic case , and as @xmath357 , @xmath358 for the special cases when the inflection points are located along symmetry axis for the quasiparticle dispersion .",
