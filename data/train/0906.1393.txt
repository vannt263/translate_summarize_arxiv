    "the isolation of single layers of carbon ( graphene ) whose low - energy spectrum is described by the dirac - weyl hamiltonian of massless spin-@xmath7 fermions @xcite , has offered physicists the unique possibility to test the predictions of relativistic quantum mechanics in a condensed phase .",
    "a particular attention focuses on ballistic transport @xcite , as the unusual band structure of a carbon monolayer @xcite leads simultaneously to a divergent fermi wavelength @xmath8 in the undoped graphene limit , and to a zero bandgap . for these reasons ,",

    "@xcite , the fano factor in this case coincides with that of a diffusive wire ( @xmath1 ) . also , the transmission eigenvalues of these two systems display the same distribution .",
    "this analogy coined the term of _ pseudodiffusive transport _ , which describes ballistic graphene properties in the universal conductivity limit .",

    "@xcite show the convergence should be already reached for moderate aspect ratios @xmath17 . a clear explanation of this discrepancy is missing , but it is usually attributed to the fact that boundary conditions used in theoretical works , which describe either an abrupt termination of a perfect honeycomb lattice or an infinite mass confinement @xcite , may not model the real - sample edges correctly @xcite .    in this work ,",

    "a further analogy between them appears when ( at least ) one of the leads is narrow in comparison to the characteristic length of the conducting region @xmath19 .",
    "namely , the conductance in such a  _ quantum tunneling _ regime shows a  power - law decay @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is a nonuniversal ( geometry - dependent ) exponent .",

    "the original feature of the geometries studied in this article is that the influence of sample edges are eliminated ( for the corbino setup ) or irrelevant , as the spatial current distribution is not uniform , but concentrated far away from the edges .",
