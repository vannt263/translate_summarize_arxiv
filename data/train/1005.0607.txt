    "the chern - simons ( cs ) modification to einstein general relativity ( gr ) consists of augmenting einstein - hilbert action by adding a parity violating gravitational term which couples a scalar field @xmath0 to the first - class pontryagin density @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the dual riemann tensor @xcite . with this modification",
    ", the gravitational action in the absence of matter takes the form @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the coupling constant and @xmath5 ( throughout the article we adopt units such that @xmath6 ) . the quadratic term in the action ( [ action ] ) can be thought of as a gravitational parity violating analogue of the axion term .",
    "it is usual to motivate such a term from string theory as a similar term appears in the string low energy effective action and is related to the string anomaly cancellation .",
    "however , in the string theory context the natural order of magnitude of the predicted coupling constant is several order of magnitudes lower than the one required for the effects to be observed in astrophysics @xcite .",
    "this cs modification to einstein theory has attracted considerable attention recently . in particular , this theory has been considered in a phenomenological context in cosmology and relativistic astrophysics ; see @xcite and references therein .",
    "observational constraints on the cs coupling @xmath7 coming from spinning compact objects were given in @xcite , where the bound @xmath8 was obtained .",
    "it was argued in @xcite that gravitational wave detection could eventually improve this bound on @xmath7 in a couple of orders of magnitude .",
    "more recently , in @xcite it was discussed how the observation of slowly rotating neutron stars would yield bounds on @xmath7 that are three order of magnitudes stronger than the one mentioned above , which comes from pulsar observations . in @xcite , the gravitational perturbations of a schwarzschild black hole in dynamical cs gravity were studied , and it was shown that the gravitational oscillation modes carry the imprints of the coupling to the scalar field , then the theory could be tested with gravitational wave detectors .    it is known @xcite that the introduction of a cs modification in the gravitational action yields a modification of the spinning black hole geometry . this is due to the fact that , unlike schwarzschild solution , kerr solution has a non - vanishing pontryagin density .",
    "the spinning black hole solution to the theory ( [ action ] ) is known only in the slowly rotating approximation and for small coupling constant @xmath7 @xcite , and here we investigate its strong field regime by analyzing the trajectories of photons in its vicinity .    as black holes are essentially non - emitting objects , it is of interest the study of the null geodesics around them , in which photons coming form other sources move , to obtain information about these objects . in particular , gravitational lensing by black holes has received considerable attention in the last few years , mainly because of the fact of the strong evidence about the presence of supermassive black holes at the center of galaxies .",
    "a useful tool to study black hole gravitational lenses is the strong deflection limit , which is an approximate analytical method for obtaining the positions , magnifications , and time delays of the images .",
    "it was introduced by darwin @xcite for the schwarzschild geometry , rediscovered several times @xcite , extended to reissner - nordstrm geometry @xcite , and to any spherically symmetric black holes @xcite .",
    "numerical studies @xcite were performed as well .",
    "kerr black holes were also analyzed in the strong deflection limit @xcite .",
    "another related aspect that was considered , with the intention of measuring the properties of astrophysical black holes , are the shadows cast by rotating ones @xcite , which present an optical deformation caused by the spin , instead of being circles as in the non - rotating case .",
    "this subject have been recently re - examined by several authors @xcite due to the expectation that the direct observation of black holes will be possible in the near future .",
    "more details about these topics , additional references and a discussion of the observational perspectives can be found in the review article @xcite .    in this paper , we study how the introduction of a cs term in the gravitational action modifies the null geodesics structure and the shadow produced by a spinning black hole .",
    "the article is organized as follows : in section 2 we review the slowly spinning limit of a rotating black hole solution in cs modified gravity , for a small coupling constant ; in section 3 , we study the null geodesics around the black hole and integrate the generic photon orbits . in section 4 , we find the shape of the shadow and , finally , in section 5 , we discuss the results obtained .",
    "as pointed out above , we will study how the null geodesics and the shadow produced by a rotating black hole get modified by the introduction of a cs term in the gravitational action .",
    "first , let us analyze the spinning solution of the theory ( [ action ] ) .    the equations of motion coming from the action ( [ action ] ) take the form @xmath9 and @xmath10 where the traceless tensor @xmath11 is given by @xmath12 the pontryagin density can be written as the exterior derivative of a cs form , namely @xmath13 and this yields the conservation of a topological current .",
    "this relation to the three - dimensional gravitational cs term is precisely the reason why the theory ( [ action ] ) receives the name of chern - simons theory , even if it sounds curious in the context of four dimensions .",
    "this makes the theory defined by ( [ action ] ) specially related to the three - dimensional topologically massive gravity @xcite .",
    "now , let us move to discuss the spinning solution to the field equations ( [ a ] ) and ( [ b ] ) .",
    "this solution is only known for slow rotation and small coupling constant approximation , and it was recently found in references @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to a perturbation of the kerr solution of gr .",
    "so , let us recall the kerr solution . written in boyer - lindsquit coordinates ,",
    "kerr metric reads @xmath14 with @xmath15 the parameter @xmath16 is the mass of the object , while the spin parameter @xmath17 is given in terms of its angular momentum @xmath18 . in the slowly spinning approximation @xmath19",
    ", the kerr metric takes the form @xmath20",

    "if a cs term is added to the einstein - hilbert action ( that is , considering @xmath22 in eqs .",
    "( [ a ] ) and ( [ b ] ) ) , then the spinning solution of gr gets modified .",
    "the metric corresponding to the solution of the modified theory , in the slowly spinning and small @xmath4 approximation , has the form @xcite @xmath23 while the configuration corresponding to the scalar field @xmath0 is given by @xmath24 from eq .",
    "( [ metrica ] ) we observe that the off - diagonal component of the metric receives contributions of order @xmath25 .",
    "this produces a weakened dragging effect and , as we will show below , this also alters the null geodesics structure stamping its imprint on the shadows of spinning compact objects .",
    "lets us analyze the null geodesics around the black hole . for simplicity , from now on",
    "we adimensionalize all quantities with the mass of the black hole , i.e. we replace @xmath26 by @xmath27 , @xmath28 by @xmath29 , @xmath30 by @xmath4 , etc . ( which is equivalent to put @xmath31 in all equations ) .",
    "the equation for the trajectories of photons in the equatorial plane ( @xmath32 ) can be obtained from the condition @xmath33 , where the contraction of the four - velocity @xmath34 is calculated using the metric ( [ metrica ] ) . in this case , we have @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the affine parameter , @xmath37 is the energy , @xmath38 is the angular momentum in the direction of the axis of symmetry of the black hole , and @xmath39 is the impact parameter . for slow rotation ,",
    "the parameter @xmath29 is small . in this case , we approximate the effective potential @xmath40 by its taylor expansion to order @xmath41 : @xmath42 where @xmath43 .",
    "the limit @xmath44 gives @xmath45 which is the effective potential associated with kerr solution , to second order in @xmath29 , as expected ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "it is possible to obtain the equatorial orbits of photons around black holes in gr or in cs modified gravity from the effective potential @xmath40 .",
    "this potential has an unique extreme in the range @xmath46 ( with @xmath47 the event horizon radius ) , which corresponds to a maximum .",
    "the behavior of the potential is similar to that in gr .",
    "the potential depends on the impact parameter @xmath48 , so prograde and retrograde photons interact with different potentials .",
    "in fact , we have four types of possible equatorial orbits for photons :    * _ scattering orbits _",
    ": photons that come from the infinity , reach the perihelion , and then scatter back to infinity .",
    "this kind of orbits happens when @xmath49 , being @xmath50 the largest value of the potential . * _ falling orbits _",
    ": photons that come from the infinity , and then eventually fall into the black hole crossing the horizon . in this case ,",
    "@xmath51 . *",
    "_ circular orbits _ : unstable circular orbits with radius @xmath52 , where @xmath53 . * _ falling orbits , initial position close to the horizon _ : photons that come from some initial radius @xmath54 such that @xmath55 , and end up falling into the black hole .    in this work",
    ", we concentrate on the first two types of orbits .",
    "the shape of the orbits can be obtained by numerical integration of @xmath56 , which is the quotient between @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",

    "carter showed in @xcite that this separability is possible in the case of kerr geometry , using a third conserved quantity , often called carter constant . in this section",

    "@xmath74 because we are dealing with null geodesics . then , considering this _ ansatz _ for @xmath69 in ( [ shj1 ] ) , we get @xmath75 where the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ shj3 ] ) is calculated to order @xmath41 .",
    "it might be instructive for the reader to compare this expression with the one corresponding to the kerr geometry , calculated to second order in @xmath29 ( the exact expression for kerr geometry can be found in @xcite ) .",
    "taking all this into account , the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ shj3 ] ) can be expressed in the form @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the derivative of @xmath69 with respect to @xmath36 for the case of the kerr geometry , and to second order in @xmath29 .",
    "@xmath78 is a corrective term that appears from considering the rotating black hole solution with metric ( [ metrica ] ) .",

    "( [ r ] ) one recovers the expression for kerr s metric ( to second order in @xmath29 ) .",
    "regarding the function @xmath93 , it is worth noticing that the equation ( [ sth ] ) is the same as in the kerr geometry ; therefore , it should satisfy the same conditions ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "finally , the jacobi action @xmath69 reads @xmath94 where it was taken into account that both the energy @xmath72 and the angular momentum @xmath73 are conserved quantities ( and consequently we have the conserved quantity @xmath84 as a parameter ) . without losing generality , we can fix @xmath95 .",
    "the equations of motion corresponding to coordinates @xmath27 and @xmath81 can be simply obtained from @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "then , combining these with ( [ sr ] ) and ( [ sth ] ) , we have that @xmath98 the orbits with constant @xmath27 are those for which the conditions @xmath99 are satisfied .",
    "the values of the impact parameters @xmath100 and @xmath101 that are compatible with these conditions determine the contour of the shadow of the black hole . a detailed treatment of the shadow for ( extremal ) kerr geometries can be found in @xcite , while other interesting related works are @xcite . in the case of rotating cs black holes , the parameters @xmath100 and @xmath101 compatible with eqs .",
    "( [ r0 ] ) belong to two possible families , as in the case of kerr geometry ( see @xcite ) .",
    "however , one of these families is not consistent with the conditions that the function @xmath93 should satisfy . in our case , the family of allowed parameters is the one that in the limit @xmath66 leads to the valid family for the kerr geometry .",

    "as we have pointed out in the previous section , the allowed values for the parameters @xmath100 and @xmath101 are those that determine the shadow of the black hole .",
    "if a black hole is situated between a source of light and an observer , the light reaches the observer after being deflected by the black hole gravitational field ; but some part of the photons emitted by the source , those with small impact parameters , end up falling into the black hole , not reaching the observer .",
    "the apparent shape of a black hole is thus defined by the boundary of the shadow . to describe the shadow ,",

    "the distortion parameter is defined by @xmath123 , where @xmath124 is the difference between the endpoints of the circle and of the shadow , both of them at the opposite side of the point @xmath122 , i.e. corresponding to the prograde circular orbit .",

    "in this work , we have studied the null geodesics corresponding to a slowly rotating black hole in chern simons gravity , with a small coupling constant .",

    "this means that the aspect of the shadow allows to distinguish between the kerr geometry and its cs modification . in this alternative theory , for a given rotation parameter @xmath29 ,",
    "the shadow is always larger , and less distorted than in gr when @xmath4 is lower than a critical value , or distorted in the opposite direction if @xmath7 exceeds that critical value .",

    "then , in the case that the cs theory is a valid correction to gr , the known bound allows for a larger relative deviation from kerr in the shadows of low mass black holes .",
    "this entails an extra observational difficulty , because the angles subtended by the shadows of stellar mass black holes as seen from the earth are much smaller than those corresponding to intermediate mass black holes or to the supermassive black hole sgr a * at the galactic center .",
    "the angular radius size of the shadow can be estimated from the schwarzschild one with the same mass , which is given by @xmath151 , with @xmath152 the distance from the observer to the black hole .",

    "the observation of the effect of the cs coupling on the shadow corresponding to the black hole in the vicinity of sgr a * would be extremely difficult because of the very the small deformation allowed by the bound on @xmath4 . in the case of stellar size black holes , the main problem is not the bound on @xmath7 but the small angular size of the shadow .",
    "it seems that the better candidates to observe the possible effects of the cs coupling on the shadows it would be the intermediate mass black holes in our galaxy if the existence of these objects is confirmed . in any case",
    ", the observation of the lensing effects due to a cs correction like those discussed in this paper will be inaccessible to current or near future technology .",
