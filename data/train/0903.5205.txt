    "time variable x - ray emission is a probe to the inner regions of the active galactic nuclei ( agn ) and is considered to be one of their defining characteristics .",
    "x - ray variability studies provide insight into the geometry and the physical conditions in the nuclear regions on account of the fact that this emission is thought to be emitted from regions close to the supermassive black hole .",
    "the x - ray variability studies on time - scales of months to years in agns have established the similarity of the physical processes across stellar mass to supermassive black holes @xcite .",
    "since the characteristic time - scale is proportional to the mass of the black hole , @xmath0 , continuous monitoring for a long duration becomes necessary in the case of agn based on linear scaling with black hole mass from x - ray binary systems .",
    "early studies on x - ray variability using data from _ exosat _ in the 0.1  10 kev range showed that on short time - scales agn variability appeared to be red noise dominated .",
    "in other words , it was unpredictable and aperiodic in nature @xcite . corresponding power spectral density ( psd , that is , variability power as a function of temporal frequency ) is best fitted by a power - law of slopes -1 to -2 with no cut - off seen down to the lowest sampled frequencies .",
    "however , the shapes of their psds were shown to be similar to those of x - ray binaries ( xrbs ) in their soft state @xcite . hence analogous to the high - frequency breaks seen in the psds of xrbs and assuming the break time - scale varying linearly with @xmath0 , a break to flatter psd slope was expected over a period of days to weeks .",
    "due to the uneven sampling of data the results yielding the break - frequency were uncertain .",
    "the _ exosat _",
    "data of a @xmath1day - long agn x - ray observations have revealed inverse correlation between the amplitude of variability and x - ray luminosity @xcite .",
    "results from the _ rosat _ all - sky survey ( rass ) on the soft x - ray variability of agn showed the variability strength on timescales of days to be a function of steepness of the x - ray spectrum with sources with steeper spectra exhibiting stronger variability @xcite .",
    "psd studies were constrained due to large time gaps between subsequent observations in _ rosat _ data .    with the launch of the _ rxte _ in 1995 ,",
    "a significant improvement was seen in the quality of data and a manifold increase in the monitoring timescale , from months to years , was possible .",
    "because of its rapid slewing capability and flexible scheduling , an evenly sampled long - term monitoring of agn x - ray variability was carried out for several sources .",
    "contrary to the results from the then existing satellites , agn light curves from _ rxte / pca _ in the 2  20 kev energy band showed that on longer timescales , of about a month , sources displayed less dispersion in variability amplitudes compared to those measured on time scales of 1 day @xcite .",
    "the psds also revealed a cutoff/ break at long timescales correlated with their black hole mass @xcite . but with a large scatter in the correlation @xcite .",
    "@xcite ascribed this scatter to a third variable , accretion rate , and found that the break time scale combined with accretion rate can predict the mass of the black hole all the way from galactic x - ray binaries to supermassive agns .",
    "they postulated that the variability originates within the accretion disk and the break time scale is associated with the inner edge of the disk , which makes an inward movement with an increasing accretion rate for a given black hole mass .",
    "since such a scenario makes a definitive suggestion of the accretion disk geometry , a study of variability with energy should be able to pin down the radiation processes in the inner accretion disk quite reliably .",
    "recently , the variability studies of agn at energies above 15 kev are carried out by @xcite .",
    "the data of the first 9 months of the _ swift / bat _ all - sky survey in the 14 - 195 kev range of the 44 brightest agn revealed a tendency of unabsorbed or type 1 seyfert galaxies to be less variable than absorbed or type 2 objects .",
    "also they found a more solid anti - correlation between variability and luminosity , which was previously detected in soft x - rays , uv and optical bands .",
    "the rxte / asm all - sky survey data gives information on a large number of x - ray sources , including agns .",
    "the sensitivity ( typically 10 mcrab for the one day average data ) is not sufficient to make a detailed study of agns . by taking data at larger bin sizes ,",
    "however , it should be possible to get meaningful information on the variability at longer time scales . in this paper , we have carried out a comparative study of the variability of agn in soft ( @xmath2 12 kev ) and hard ( @xmath3 12 kev ) x - ray bands using data from the _ rxte / asm _ all - sky survey and results obtained by beckmann et al . from _",
    "swift / bat _ all - sky survey .",
    "data selection is described in section 2 followed by data analysis and results in section 3 and discussion and conclusions in section 4 .",
    "the all - sky monitor ( asm , @xcite ) onboard rossi x - ray timing explorer ( _ rxte _ , @xcite ) consists of three shadow scanning cameras ( sscs ) .",
    "each ssc contains a position - sensitive proportional counter ( pspc ) that views sky through a slit mask .",
    "fov of each ssc is 6@xmath4@xmath590@xmath4 , allowing asm to scan most of the sky every 1.5 hours .",
    "so apart from locating transient objects , it also provides photometric records of known sources in three energy bands corresponding to a ( 1.5  3 kev ) , b ( 3  5 kev ) and c ( 5  12 kev ) in addition to the total , or sum band , intensity in the 1.5  12 kev band .",
    "the mit database ( http://xte.mit.edu/asm_lc.html ) , from where we have extracted asm light curves , gives data dwell by dwell and one day average data points .",
    "in dwell by dwell each raw data point represents the fitted source flux from one 90 second dwell . whereas in case of",
    "one day average each data point represents the one - day average of the fitted source fluxes from a number ( typically 5  10 ) of individual asm dwells .    to have a comprehensive information , we have selected all agn candidates ( 147 ) from the asm source list and carried out a systematic analysis .",
    "we found 31 agn from the sample used by @xcite .",
    "we find measurable asm flux for all the sources except two ( ngc 1365 and grs 1734 - 292 ) .",
    "this sample of common sources consists of 3 blazars , 1 radio galaxy , 8 seyfert 1 , 4 seyfert 1.5 , 2 seyfert 1.8 , 1 seyfert 1.9 and 12 seyfert 2 .",
    "the bat sources not in the asm source list include 1 blazar , 3 seyfert 1 , 1 seyfert 1.5 and 8 seyfert 2 .",
    "we have downloaded all available asm dwell data for 147 agn from mit database ( http://xte .",
    "mit.edu/asm_lc.html ) .",
    "this covers data from mjd 50087 to about 54466 , i.e. 1996 january 5 to 2008 july 15 .",
    "dwell data are subjected to the usual selection cuts as prescribed by the asm website and binned in 20 and 40 days bins . on closer inspection of light curves of individual sources , several large spikes , some of them with an apparent periodicity of one year ,",
    "were noticed .",
    "these abnormal data were found to have large intrinsic errors too .",
    "since the count rates in asm is based on a profile fitting method , the errors depend on the other sources in the field of view and the orientation of the asm fov for a given observation . as a first cut",
    ", we examined the possibility that there could be enhanced unaccounted systematic errors for data points with large measured errors .",
    "it is found that the measured errors for each dwell data is sharply peaked at 1 counts / s .",
    "the distribution of errors for each dwell data for one of the sources ( ic4329a ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ dwellerrdist ] . based on these considerations ,",
    "we have introduced a selection criterion of an upper limit on sum count rate error of 3 counts / s , corresponding to thrice the peak value of the distribution .    after selecting dwell count rates for sum , a , b and c bands based on the above mentioned cuts",
    ", they are binned into 20 and 40 days starting from mjd 50087 . for each bin",
    "the average rate and error are calculated for all the four bands , which are weighted mean and estimated error of the mean .",
    "data points with too few number of individual dwell measurements ( less than 20 data points for 20 day binning and less than 40 data points for 40 day binning ) are also ignored , ensuring that there is at least one dwell per day , on an average .",
    "for example , for ic4329a , fig .",
    "[ errorvsdwell ] shows the sum band rate error after binning as a function of number of dwells per bin , for 20 and 40 days binning . in both",
    "the cases sum band error increases sharply for bins with lower number of dwells . after introducing these criteria ,",
    "the individual light curves are carefully examined and no systematic abnormalities are found in these light curves .    to summarize , the selection criteria for generating asm light curves are :",
    "* reduced chi - square of the fit @xmath2 1.5 * number of sources in the field of view @xmath2 16 * earth angle @xmath3 75@xmath4 * exposure time @xmath3 30 seconds * long - axis angle -41.5@xmath4 @xmath2 @xmath6 @xmath2 46@xmath4 * short - axis angle -5@xmath4 @xmath2 @xmath7 @xmath2 5@xmath4 * error on sum count rate @xmath2 3 counts / s * number of dwells for n day bin light curve is @xmath3 n    the first six selection criteria are the same as those used for generating one - day average count rates from dwell data as described in the mit database webpage .",
    "the asm measurements have a systematic error of 3% added in quadrature to the statistical errors .",
    "this error is estimated using crab light curves and could be underestimate in some cases ( http://xte.mit.edu/asm_lc.html ) .",
    "@xcite have studied light curves of several sources with constant x - ray flux binned with different bin durations from 1 to 200 days and have estimated systematic error on large time scales in the range of 0.01 - 0.1 cts / s , depending on the source flux . according to fig . 2 of their paper , there seems to be a shift of about 10% between measured and estimated rms for sources with constant flux .",
    "we have investigated this in detail to get a better handle on the average systematic errors .",
    "for a few of the bright sources , we have generated the power spectral density spectra ( psd ) using a method based on the autocorrelation function ( gilfanov & arefiev 2005 ) and have assumed that the frequency independent power has to be due to the errors in each observations .",
    "based on these psd , rms noise level seems to be underestimated by a factor of 1.13 .",
    "a few steady sources too were investigated and the frequency independent systematic error is similar to this number . though we can not completely rule out some additional frequency dependent systematic errors , we assume that for large bin sizes ( greater than 10 days ) , most of the systematic errors are taken into account .",
    "this assumption is further strengthened by examining individual light curves as well as the distribution of the source fluxes ( see below ) . after correcting typical binned error of 0.005 c",
    "/ s with this factor , this systematic error translates into typical systematic error of 0.5 c / s for dwell in s band and 0.3 c / s for a , b and c bands .    according to asm data products page ( http:// xte.mit.edu/ ) ,",
    "there is a 1 mcrab positive bias in the light curve intensities .",
    "this bias is only evident when enough data are averaged so that the statistical uncertainties are driven to be very small .",
    "this generally requires binning or analyzing the light curves on time scales of many days or longer . in order to estimate this bias",
    "we have carried out the following exercise .",
    "we have generated histogram of average sum band count rates for 147 agn ( fig .",
    "[ sumratehist ] ) . unlike the usual number distribution given in an integral way ,",
    "this is a differential plot and hence the number should vary with count rates as a power - law with an index of -2.5 for an isotropic distribution .",
    "hence we have fitted this histogram with a function consisting of a power - law with slope -2.5 and constant offset represented as the start point of the power - law .",
    "count rates were spread in the x - axis using a gaussian distribution with @xmath8=0.0056 counts / s according to the above mentioned error estimation .",
    "fit for sum band data is shown in the fig .",
    "[ sumratehist ] .",
    "the number distribution is shown as data points with error bars ( error taken is the square root of the number in each bin ) and the fit is shown as a histogram .",
    "offsets obtained with this method for various bands are as follows : s band : 0.0895 c / s , a band : 0.0274 c / s , b band : 0.015 c / s and c band : 0.0213 c / s .",
    "these values are consistent with the 1 mcrab offset quoted in the asm website .    ]    as a further verification of these offsets and systematic error , we checked for consistency of flux estimates .",
    "we compared our results with the flux obtained from an uniform spectral analysis done on a large sample of agns @xcite and found 22 common sources . using the spectral parameters from @xcite and asm sum band average count rates we estimated 210 kev absorbed flux for these sources using web calculator ( webpimms tool at http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/tools ) .",
    "[ asmvsxrtflux ] shows the plot of ten years averaged absorbed asm flux vs observed flux from other experiments , both in the energy range of 210 kev .",
    "it should be noted that these observations are not simultaneous .",
    "hence source variability can cause non - identical fluxes between the asm and the other experiments .",
    "points are marked by diamonds .",
    "solid line corresponds to the case where asm flux is equal to flux measurements from other experiments .",
    "dotted lines correspond to asm flux equivalent to @xmath90.1 c / s around solid line .",
    "most of the sources barring a few like ic4329a and ngc 4388 are close to the fitted line , within @xmath90.1 asm c / s . as a further check we compared the long duration rxte pca measurements from the uniform analysis done by @xcite .",
    "we found these measurements for nine sources : ic4329a , ngc4151 , ngc3783 , mcg-6 - 30 - 15 , 3c120 , 3c390.3 , ngc3227 , ngc4051 and ngc3516 @xcite .",
    "we estimated the asm flux by extracting 40 days binned sum band rates near simultaneous with the pca measurements .",
    "these points are indicated by plus signs with error bars in the plot .",
    "hence overall there is a good agreement between flux estimates from asm and other observations .",
    "this agreement also justifies our estimates of count rate offsets and systematic errors .",
    "we note here that further refinement in the flux comparison is difficult to achieve because of the fact that at shorter time scales ( where pointed observations are available ) asm error bars are too large and at longer time scales ( when the asm error bars are driven to a small value ) pointed observations are simply not available .    applying the above mentioned cuts and corrections , light curves in all four bands were generated for all asm detected agns .",

    "the effective area at 2 kev is about 33% of the effective area at 5 kev @xcite , whereas this number is @xmath2 1% for rxte",

    "hence it is quite possible that the higher variability at low energies derived by us is real and indicate a sharp increase of variability in agns at lower energies for longer time scales . though we can not completely rule out some further systematic errors , it is quite evident that rxte - asm is an unique instrument to probe long time scale variability at lower energies .",
    "there are , indeed , several indicators from early exosat data which supports the above assertion .",

    "though there is a strong indication of very high soft x - ray variability at long time scales , a detailed comparison with a large number of pointed observations for individual sources are required to pin down any residual systematic errors in the rxte - asm data .",
    "energy dependent variability has been studied extensively in galactic black hole sources ( see @xcite and references therein ) and one of the models used to explain the energy dependency is the variations in the input parameters of the thermal comptonization process which results in an pivoting power - law spectrum .",
    "though the very low value of variability in the bat energy band may be influenced by a non - varying spectral component in this energy band ( like reflection ) , detailed wide band spectroscopy of seyfert galaxies suggest a common continuous phenomena for the decreasing variability with increasing energy . for example , the radio galaxy 3c120 shows only a moderate reflection component and very strong spectral variability ( over two days ) with the spectral index correlated with the soft x - ray flux , indicating a phenomena where the input seed photon variation for a thermal comptonization process causes the energy dependent x - ray variability @xcite .",
    "if the same phenomena is responsible for most of the sources reported in this work , it suggests that a ) for a majority of agns the thermal comptonization is the dominant process , b ) the pivot energy is higher ( greater than about 20 kev ) .",

    "<S> we investigate the x - ray variability characteristics of hard x - ray selected agns ( based on swift / bat data ) in the soft x - ray band using the rxte / asm data . </S>",
    "<S> the uncertainties involved in the individual dwell measurements of asm are critically examined and a method is developed to combine a large number of dwells with appropriate error propagation to derive long duration flux measurements ( greater than 10 days ) . </S>",
    "<S> we also provide a general prescription to estimate the errors in variability derived from rms values from unequally spaced data . though the derived variability for individual sources are not of very high significance , we find that , in general , the soft x - ray variability is higher than those in hard x - rays and the variability strengths decrease with energy for the diverse classes of agn . </S>",
    "<S> we also examine the strength of variability as a function of the break time scale in the power density spectrum ( derived from the estimated mass and bolometric luminosity of the sources ) and find that the data are consistent with the idea of higher variability at time scales longer than the break time scale . </S>"
