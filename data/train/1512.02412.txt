    "<S> 2 . </S>",
    "<S> the decay times for the peak a and b are highlighted . </S>",
    "<S> for all samples , higher emission energy is correlated with slower luminescence decay . as the nominal coverage of gaas </S>",
    "<S> is increased from 1.8 ml to 3.6 ml , the decay time for the peak a decreases from 8.5 ns to 6 ns . </S>",
    "<S> the decay time at peak b changes from 3 ns to 2.4 ns . </S>",
    "<S> increasing temperature results in the shorter decay time as a consequence of the thermally activated non - radiative decay processes ; e.g. the 3.6-ml sample exhibits decay times at 300 k of about 3.1 and 0.9 ns for peaks a and b.    our experimental results can be understood as follows : according to the structural investigations , the qw sample ( 1.2 ml ) and the small qds ( less than 1 nm high ) are fully strained . due to the strain , the conduction band minimum of gaas has a shift of 356 mev to higher energy and hence , the @xmath11-like electrons in the gaas are located significantly higher than the x - valley in the gap . in such a case , the favorable optical transition is indirect and occurs between the electrons ( e ) localized at the x state of gap and the heavy - holes ( hh ) in gaas . with increased the gaas coverage , the qds become larger and partially relaxed . depending on the degree of relaxation , the bottom of the @xmath11-conduction band in gaas shifts to lower energy . finally for the fully relaxed qds , the electrons at the @xmath11 state in gaas are localized lower than the x - valley in the gap matrix and the electron - hole transition becomes direct in both @xmath12 and real space . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4a shows schematically the band alignment of the two extreme situations of a fully strained ( type ii and indirect ) and a fully relaxed ( type i and direct ) gaas / gap heterostructure . </S>",
    "<S> the two arrows indicate the e - hh transition for both cases . from the afm analysis , we know that for nominal thickness above 1.8 ml , a multimodal size distribution fits better to the investigated qds than a single gaussian distribution . </S>",
    "<S> we divide the qds , therefore , depending on their height , into small , intermediate , and large qds . </S>",
    "<S> such arrangement fits to the lateral size distribution , too . </S>",
    "<S> the small qds are strained with an indirect e - hh transition , whereas the large qds are relaxed with a direct e - hh transition . </S>",
    "<S> the electrons localized in the qds with intermediate size are expected to have a mixed @xmath4 nature . </S>",
    "<S> we consider that all of qds contribute to the optical emission and they are the origin of peaks a and b in fig . 2 for nominal thickness above 1.8 ml . </S>",
    "<S> peak a is due to the smaller qds and peak b to the larger qds .    </S>",
    "<S> our model is also experimentally supported by the behavior of the luminescence intensity for the samples with different gaas coverage , in particular the ratio between peaks a and b. as can be seen in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 , an increased nominal coverage of gaas is correlated with a larger total light output and more dominant peak b. we suggest that the increasing of the total light intensity is connected to a transition from a fully strained indirect type - ii qds system ( 1.8 ml sample ) to a relaxed system with direct type - i qds ( 3.6-ml sample ) . for 2.7 and 3.6 ml samples , the large qds are already relaxed and have higher intensity due to the stronger overlap between electrons and holes wave functions in the type - i band alignment . the facts that both samples emit light up to room temperature and the faster decay time for peak b indicate a direct gap and type - i character of large qds in the samples . </S>",
    "<S> the larger qds have light emission at lower energy mainly due to the confinement effect . </S>",
    "<S> the small qds , on the other hand , emit predomintly at position a with a slower decay time and faster thermal quenching , behaving like a type - ii system . </S>",
    "<S> the connection between the increasing of size and the red shift in emission energy with the corresponding band alignment explain the decay time behavior presented in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3b . the probability to have a mixed direct and indirect transition , and finally a direct and type - i qd increases with increasing the size of the qds . </S>",
    "<S> larger dots with type - i band alignment have large overlap between the electron - hole wave functions and hence , faster decay time . </S>",
    "<S> the fastest measured decay time of about 2 ns is still higher than the reported values for the pure type - i systems , but it can be explained by the mixed direct - indirect nature of the optical transitions .    generally , at the interface of two semiconductors , with their conduction band minima at two different valleys , the formation of localized interface states is expected . </S>",
    "<S> such states may have also mixed @xmath4 character and lead to optical transition , particularly for a common anion heterointerface . however , in the case of gaas / gap with a common cation heterointerface the interface states are not localized in the gap and are not optically active , as predicted by atomic empirical pseudopotential calculations @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the appearance of peak a and b in luminescence spectra shows that both kinds of transition occur simultaneously in a mixed ensemble of type - i and type - ii qds . </S>",
    "<S> the excitation intensity dependence of the pl measurements in the range of 0.001 to 10 w/@xmath13 verifies this picture and shows a remarkable 50 mev blueshift for peak a and a slight blueshift of about 6 mev for peak b for the 3.6-ml sample . </S>",
    "<S> the strong blueshift has already been reported for several type - ii qds @xcite .        in order to corroborate our model , we calculated the energy states of gaas / gap qws and qds using the effective mass approximation for different relaxation degree @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> since the height of the qds is at least one order of magnitude smaller than their lateral size , the qds were modeled as qws with a thickness equivalent to the height of the qds . according to the calculation </S>",
    "<S> , a direct e - hh transition in gaas qds is expected only if the qds are higher than 2 nm and fully relaxed . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4b depicts the calculated energetically lowest and favorable e - hh transition for fully strained , 75% strained , and fully relaxed qds as a function of the height . </S>",
    "<S> the symbols show the peak positions of samples with nominal coverage between 1.2 ml to 3.6 ml . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding height for every peak position was taken from afm analysis and gives the average height of small and large qds in every sample . </S>",
    "<S> the luminescence peak positions fit well to the calculated results .    </S>",
    "<S> these results support our model for a transition from optically low - efficient indirect type - ii strained qw and qds to optically efficient direct type - i relaxed qds while the size of dots increases . </S>",
    "<S> the strain relaxation in the gaas / gap qds occurs via the formation of edge dislocations , which do not act as nonradiative recombination centers and hence , allows the realization of high - efficient e - hh transition @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> similar characteristics have been also reported for the qds based on the direct gap ingaas embedded in the indirect gap matrix @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> several stranski - krastanow qds systems such as ( in , ga)as / gaas and inas / inp show luminescence spectra with two peaks , which are attributed to the qds and to the wetting layer . </S>",
    "<S> however , the emission energy of gaas / gap qds is very low for the strained wetting layer with an estimated thickness of @xmath14 nm . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we believe that the origin of the light emission is the carrier recombination in the qds . only for 1.8-ml sample the origin of peak a might be the fully strained wetting layer .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have demonstrated the optical emission of the gaas / gap qds up to room temperature in the visible range . </S>",
    "<S> the luminescence spectra can be fitted using two gaussians . </S>",
    "<S> the afm analysis shows a multimodal size distribution for the qds . </S>",
    "<S> the thin quantum wells and small dots are fully strained and have type - ii band alignment with indirect e - hh transition , whereas the large qds are fully relaxed with type - i band alignment and direct e - hh transition .    </S>",
