    "zika virus ( zv ) , an emerging mosquito - borne flavivirus related to yellow fever , dengue , west nile and japanese encephalitis @xcite , has taken the americas by a storm .",
    "zv is transmitted primarily by _",
    "aedes aegypti _ mosquitoes , which also transmits dengue and chikungunya , are responsible for huge outbreaks in some regions in brazil , colombia , and el salvador .",
    "zv cases as of february 9 , 2016 , according to the cdc @xcite , have been reported throughout the caribbean , mexico as well as in most south american nations except for chile , uruguay , argentina , paraguay and peru .",
    "several states within the united states have reported zv cases@xcite and although it is expected that zv will be managed within the usa , the possibility of localized zv outbreaks is not out of the question . + phylogenetic analyses have revealed the existence of two main virus lineages ( african and asian ) @xcite . up to date",
    ", there are no concise clinical differences between infections with either one of these two lineages .",
    "this is in part due to the few human isolates belonging to the african lineage which were mainly obtained from sentinel rhesus in 1947 in uganda , where it was first discovered during primate and mosquito surveillance for yellow fever @xcite .",
    "its geographic habitat at that time was tied in to narrow equatorial belt running across africa and into asia .",
    "the african lineage circulated primarily in wild primates and arboreal mosquitoes such as _ aedes africanus _ ; spillover infections in humans rarely occurred even in areas were it was found to be highly enzootic @xcite .",
    "the more geographically expanded asian lineage seems to have originated from the adaptation of the virus to invade a different vector , _ aedes aegypti _ , which unfortunately seems to be perfectly adapted to infect humans @xcite .",
    "the first human infection was reported in nigeria in 1954 @xcite . in 2007 ,",
    "zika moved out of africa and asia causing an outbreak in yap island in the federated states of micronesia @xcite , this was followed by a large outbreak in french polynesia in 2013 - 2014 @xcite and then spreading to new caledonia , the cook islands and eastern islands @xcite .",
    "some evidence exists regarding zika spread following chikungunya epizootics and epidemics as african researchers observed this decades ago .",
    "this pattern was also present in 2013 when chikungunya pandemic spread from west to east followed by zika @xcite . in early 2015 , zv was detected in brazil .",
    "phylogenetic analyses of the virus isolated from patients placed the brazilian strains in the asian lineage @xcite , which has been previously detected during the french polynesian outbreak @xcite . since the first detection of zv in brazil , the following countries have reported ongoing substantial transmission of zv in south america : bolivia , brazil , colombia , ecuador , french guyana , guyana , paraguay , suriname and venezuela @xcite .",
    "several central america countries are also affected including costa rica , el salvador , guatemala , honduras , nicaragua and panama @xcite .",
    "the rapid expansion of zv has led the world health organization ( who ) to declare it a public health emergency of international concern @xcite .",
    "+ it has been estimated that about 80% of persons infected with zv are asymptomatic @xcite and it is known that those with clinical manifestations present dengue - like symptoms that include arthralgia , particularly swelling , mild fever , lymphadenopathy , skin rash , headaches , retro orbital pain and conjunctivitis which normally last for 2 - 7 days @xcite . due to the similarity in clinical characteristics between dengue , chikungunya and zv , the lack of widely distributed zv - specific tests , the high proportion of asymptomatic individuals , it may turn out that the number of patients infected with zv may actually be a lot higher than what it is being reported @xcite .",
    "moreover , co - infection with dengue and zv is not uncommon .",
    "in fact , it has been previously reported making zv diagnosis even more difficult@xcite .",
    "+ the challenges linked to the control of zv must include the fact that there is no vaccine available , a troublesome situation given the fact that zv has been linked recently to potential neurological ( microcephaly ) and auto - immune ( guillain - barr syndrome ) complications .",
    "further the evidence so far points to the likelihood that zv can also be sexually transmitted @xcite .",
    "education about zv modes of transmission and ways of preventing transmission are essential in order to halt mosquito growth and thus zv spread at the community , population , regional , national and global levels .",
    "control measures available are limited and include the use of insect repellents to protect us against mosquito bites and sex abstinence or protection while engage in sexual activity @xcite .",
    "some countries face immense challenges that if not addressed would make current efforts by officials to educate the public highly ineffective .",
    "and additional challenges that may limit if not stop the use of whatever control or education measures that a city , or nation or region may be able to put in place , are tied in to the effectiveness of public safety , violence and organized crime activity ( including gangs ) .",
    "the latin america and the caribbean population comprise only 9% of the global population and yet , it accounts for 33% of the world s",
    "homicides @xcite . in this study",
    ", we analyze the impact of that restrictions to public safety may have in the control of zv .",
    "the motivation comes from our interest in addressing the role of violence and insecurity within the context of the caribbean , particularly el salvador .",
    "as specified in the introduction , the objective of this manuscript is to look at the impact of mobility and security on the transmission dynamics of the zika virus ( zv ) , in regions where insecurity , violence and resource limitations make it difficult to implement effective intervention efforts . as a first step ,",
    "we proceed to build a two - patch model , both patches defined by their relationship to security and associated per capita resources . and so , the first patch is defined by low level security , which makes it difficult to have access and carry out systematic vector control efforts due , for example , to gang activity . the second patch a safe territory ,",
    "that is , a place where security is high , access to health services is expected , and relative high levels of education are the norm . + building detailed parametrized models that account for all the above factors would require tremendous amount of data and information and so , the model would require a large number of parameters , some that have never been measured . its use as a policy simulation tool would also require impressive amounts of information on , for example , individuals daily scheduled activities . here , it is assumed , that each patch is made up of individuals all experiencing the same degree of risk to infection .",
    "it is also assumed that all individuals are typical representatives of either the high risk ( patch1 ) or low risk ( patch 2 ) communities .",
    "the level of risk ( violence and infection ) is incorporated within a single parameter @xmath0 and so , by definition , we have in general that @xmath1 .",
    "this assumption captures in a rather simplistic way the essence of what we want to address , namely , the fact that we are looking at the dynamics of zv in a highly heterogeneous world , modeled , for the purpose of exploring its role , in as simple scenario as possible . here",
    "we look at an extreme case where the situation , idealistically defined via two patches ; a high and a low risk patch .",
    "the dynamics of individuals in both patches , short time scales are incorporated .",
    "the analysis is over the duration of a single outbreak .",
    "+ in the rest of this section , we introduce the prototypic model that will be used to model zv dynamics within a patch . and so , we let @xmath2 denote the host patch population size interacting with a vector population of size @xmath3 .",
    "the transmission process is model through the interactions of the following epidemiological state variables . and so , we let @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 denote the susceptible , latent , infectious asymptomatic , infectious symptomatic and recovered sub - populations , respectively while @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are used to denote the susceptible , latent and infectious mosquito sub - populations . since the focus is on a single outbreak , we neglect the hosts demography while assuming that the vector s demography does not change , this is done , by simply assuming that the birth and death per capita mosquito rates are the same .",
    "new reports point @xcite to the identification of an increasing number of asymptomatic infectious individuals from ongoing zv outbreaks .",
    "and so , we consider two classes of infectious @xmath6 and @xmath7 , asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals . furthermore , since not much is known about the dynamics of zv transmission , we assume that @xmath6 and @xmath7 individuals are equally infectious and that their periods of infectiousness are roughly the same .",
    "this is not a terrible assumption given our current knowledge of zv epidemiology and the fact that in general zv infections are not severe .",
    "furthermore , since the infectious process of zv is similar to dengue we proceed to use parameter estimates for dengue transmission in el salvador @xcite as well as our current estimates of the basic reproduction number for zv obtained from the data on barranquilla s colombia current zv outbreak @xcite .",
    "the selection of model parameters ranges benefited from those estimated from the 2013 - 2014 french polynesia outbreak @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of the prototypic single patch system , single epidemic outbreak , is modeled via the following nonlinear system of differential equations : @xmath12    cc parameters & description + @xmath13 & infectiousness of human to mosquitoes + @xmath14 & infectiousness of mosquitoes to humans + @xmath15 & biting rate in patch @xmath16 + @xmath17 & humans incubation rate + @xmath18 & fraction of latent that become asymptomatic and infectious + @xmath19 & recovery rate in patch @xmath16 + @xmath20 & proportion of time residents of patch @xmath16 spend in patch @xmath21 + @xmath22 & vectors natural mortality rate + @xmath23 & vectors incubation rate +        the parameters of model [ 1patch ] are collected and described in table [ tab : param ] while the flow diagram of the model is provided in fig [ fig : flow ] .",
    "we now proceed to compute the formula for the _ basic reproduction number _ for this prototypic model , that is , the average number of secondary infections generated by a typical infectious individual in a population where nobody has experienced a zv - infection .",
    "that is , we take @xmath24 , that is , we focus on perturbations of the disease free equilibrium of model ( [ 1patch ] ) , that is , on @xmath25 . and so , using standard approaches , we find that the basic reproduction number is given by @xmath26}{n_h\\gamma_{h , a}\\gamma_{h , s}\\mu_v(\\mu_v+\\nu_v)}\\\\ & : = & \\mathcal r_{0,a}^2+\\mathcal r_{0,s}^2,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 the average number of secondary cases produced by infectious asymptomatic during their infectious period whereas @xmath28 is the average number of secondary cases produced by a symtptomatic infectious during their infectious period .",
    "we also define the level of risk @xmath29 as the product of the biting rate , vector - host ratio and the infectiousness of humans to mosquitoes , @xmath30 .",
    "the dynamics of the single patch model are well known . in short ,",
    "if @xmath31 , there is no epidemic out break , that is , the proportion of introduced infected individuals , decrease while if @xmath32 we have that the host population experiences an outbreak , that is , the number of cases exceeds the initial size of the introduced infected population at time @xmath33 .",
    "when @xmath34 , the population of infected individuals eventually decreases and the disease dies out ( single outbreak model ) .",
    "+ in the next section , a two patch model using a lagrangian approach found in @xcite is introduced . and so , individual in patch @xmath35 never loose their residency status .",
    "the mobility of patch , residents visiting other patches is modeled by the use of a _ residence times matrix_. each entry models the proportion of time that each resident spends in his own patch or as a visitor , every day .",
    "we make use of the @xmath36 matrix @xmath37 , with entries @xmath38 ; @xmath39 .",
    "parameters specific to el salvador are used and the most recent estimates of @xmath40 for zv we explore , via simulations , the consequences of mobility , modeled by the matrix @xmath37 , the impact that the differences in risk , captured on the assumption @xmath41 , have on the transmission of zv by asymptomatic and symptomatic infectious individuals .",
    "the role of mobility between two communities , within the same city , living under dramatically distinct health , economic , social and security settings is now explored using as simple model as possible .",
    "we need two patches , the inclusion of within- and across - patches vector - host transmission , and the ability of each individual to ` move ' without loosing , within the model , its place of residence .",
    "we consider two highly distinct patches .",
    "patch 1 with access to health facilities , regular security , resources and effective public health policies , while patch 2 lacks nearly everything . within this",
    "highly simplified setting , the differences in risk , which depend on host vector ratios , biting rates , use of repellents , access to vector control crews and more , are captured by assuming dramatic differences in transmission ; all captured by the single parameter @xmath29 .",
    "it is therefore assumed that @xmath42 , where @xmath43 defines the risk in patch @xmath44 [ high risk patch 1 and low risk patch 2 ] . + the two - patch lagrangian model makes use of a host population stratified by epidemiological classes indexed by residence patch , that is , we let @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 denote the susceptible , latent , infectious asymptomatic , infectious symptomatic and recovered sub - populations , respectively while @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 denote the susceptible , latent and infectious mosquito sub - populations .",
    "again , @xmath2 denotes the host patch population size and @xmath3 the total vector population in each patch .",
    "it is further assumed , a reasonable assumption in the case of _ aedes aegypti _ , that the the vector does not travel between patches .",
    "the single - patch model - parameters are collected and described in table [ tab : param ] while the flow diagram of the single - patch dynamics model , when residents and visitors do not move ; that is , when the @xmath36 residence times matrix @xmath37 is such that @xmath45 , are captured in fig [ fig : flow ] + the @xmath36 residence matrix @xmath37 with entries @xmath38 , @xmath39 , where @xmath20 denotes the proportion of the day that a resident of patch @xmath16 spends in patch @xmath46 , defines host - mobility , lagrangian approach used here .",
    "the use of this approach , under the assumption that vectors do not move @xcite , has consequences .",
    "for example , it leads to the conclusion that at time @xmath47 , the population on each patch does not necessarily have to be equal to the number of residents in that patch , in other words , the _ effective population patch size _ must account for residents and visitors at _ each patch at time @xmath47_. the specifics of the model are now provided following the work of bichara et al .",
    "@xcite .      following our recently developed version of residence patch models @xcite , leads to the following two patch model where @xmath48 and @xmath49 represents the residence time that an individual from patch @xmath16 spends in patch @xmath50 .",
    "@xmath51    the basic reproduction of this model is the largest eigenvalue of the following matrix @xcite ,    @xmath52 where @xmath53 @xmath54 @xmath55 @xmath56 particularly , @xmath57 we also have the relationship @xmath58 .",
    "if the two are isolated , that is , @xmath45 , a case that allow us to estimate the power of zv transmission in the absence of mobility , that is , when each community deals with zv independently and mobility is not allowed , the basic reproduction number is @xmath59 where , for @xmath60 ,    @xmath61    and so , we proceed to make use of the disparity between patches assumption , captured by the inequality , @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is directly proportional to the local basic reproduction number or @xmath62 , which defines the risk in patch @xmath44 , [ high risk patch 1 and low risk patch 2 ] under idealized , that is , no mobility conditions .",
    "changes in the entries of @xmath37 lead to changes in the global basic reproduction number , @xmath40 , which naturally impact for example , the long - term dynamics of zv in the two - patch system .",
    "it impacts the overall final epidemic size as well as the residents prevalence within each patch . a possible scenarios that allow us to explore the role that mobility ,",
    "@xmath37 and local risk , @xmath63 have on global risk ( @xmath40 ) and on the prevalence of infections among the residents of each patch are explored via simulations .",
    "simulations are used to assess the impact of local mobility , on the dynamics of zv , between two close communities . the first heavily affected by violence , poverty and lack of resources and a second with access to public health vector control measures , health facilities , resources and the ability to minimize crime and violence .",
    "we assume the high risk community ( patch 1 ) is at a higher risk of acquiring zv ; this risk will be manifested through higher biting rates and a higher vector - host ratio leading well captured with a high reproductive number .",
    "the simulations of this idealized world considers two scenarios for patch 1 , the first defined by a high local basic reproductive number , @xmath64 and the second by taking @xmath65 , both within the ranges of previous zv outbreaks @xcite .",
    "it is assumed that in the absence of mobility , patch 2 would be unable to support a zv outbreak and since its mobility - free reproductive number is assumed to be @xmath66 .",
    "it is further assumed that mobility from patch 2 into patch 1 is unappealing due to , for example , high levels of violent activity in patch 1 . and",
    "so , individuals from patch 2 spend on average a a limited amount of their day in patch 1 ; thus for our baseline simulations we take @xmath67 .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] , shows the proliferation of the outbreak as a result of mobility when we assume the reproduction number from the current barranquilla outbreak ( @xmath64 ) @xcite . both the incidence and final size of patch 1 and patch 2 increase for all the mobility values tested .    ,",
    "@xmath68 and @xmath69 .",

    "nonetheless , this reduction on the final size of patch 1 is not significant enough to have a positive effect on the outcome of the global final size .     and @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",

    "furthermore , the global reproductive number @xmath70 is reduced for almost all mobility values compared to the zero mobility case .",
    "it is important to notice that the global reproductive number never drops below 1 , meaning that for these two particular cases ( @xmath71 ) , mobility is not enough to bring @xmath72 .    .",
