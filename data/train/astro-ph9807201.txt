    "irc  + 10  216 (= afgl 1381 = cw leo ) is the best - studied carbon star , because it is intrinsically bright and nearby .",
    "one aspect of study has traditionally been the properties of the circumstellar shell : e.g. , what is the mass loss rate , has the mass loss rate changed with time , what kind of chemistry takes place , what is the geometry of the shell ?    in two recent papers we have made an extensive study of the circumstellar dust shell of irc  + 10  216 ( groenewegen 1996 , 1997 , hereafter g97 ) . a much larger set of observational constraints was used than in any previous study .",
    "this allowed the derivation of the present - day dust mass loss rate , the ratio between the luminosity at maximum light divided by the distance squared , the dominant grain size , the effective temperature and the inner dust radius .    in another paper",
    "we have mapped the 1.3 mm continuum emission around the star ( groenewegen et al .",
    "it was detected out to 50at a noise level of 3@xmath13 or better .",
    "there is evidence for phases of enhanced mass loss , but a quantitative analysis is hampered by the significant contribution of molecular lines to the continuum emission , and the uncertainty in the radial distribution of that contribution .    another way to study",
    "the circumstellar shell is by observing the gas component .",
    "a good tracer of the ( h@xmath12 ) gas is the co molecule , and numerous co observations exist of irc  + 10  216 ( see the catalog of loup et al .",
    "( 1993 ) for a compilation ) .",
    "a fair number of detailed models have been proposed to explain various co observations .",
    "the pioneering work was done by kwan & hill ( 1977 ) . for an assumed distance of 200 pc they deduced a mass loss rate of 2 @xmath10 10@xmath14 m@xmath2 yr@xmath7 , a co abundance relative to h@xmath12 of about 8 @xmath10 10@xmath15 ( both uncertain to a factor of 2 ) , and a co/@xmath1co isotope ratio of 35 @xmath5 7 . in a second paper",
    "kwan & linke ( 1982 ) deduced a mass loss rate of 4 @xmath10 10@xmath14 m@xmath2 yr@xmath7  for a distance of 200 pc and a co abundance of 6 @xmath10 10@xmath15 .",
    "sahai ( 1987 ) finds , based on the modeling of high - j lines , that the temperature in the inner region is much larger than that predicted by the kwan & linke model , and that the mass loss rate in the inner 6  region is 3.2 @xmath10 10@xmath14 m@xmath2 yr@xmath7  and 50% higher in the extended envelope , assuming a distance of 300 pc and a co abundance of 8 @xmath10 10@xmath15 .",
    "truong - bach et al . ( 1991 ) also find evidence for a hot inner core : a mass loss rate of 2.5 @xmath10 10@xmath14 m@xmath2 yr@xmath7  in the inner 4.2  and a mass loss rate of 4 @xmath10 10@xmath14 m@xmath2 yr@xmath7  in the outer region ( for a distance of 200 pc ) .",
    "kastner ( 1992 ) found a best fit to some co data for a distance of 150 pc and a mass loss rate of 2 @xmath10 10@xmath14 m@xmath2 yr@xmath7 . in a recent paper , crosas & menten ( 1997 ) also presented j = 6 - 5 @xmath0co and @xmath1co data , and combined those with other data from the literature , and modelled the data . in this respect",
    "the philosophy behind that paper is similar to ours .",
    "the major differences with that paper are that the effective absorption coefficient is taken into account in a consistent way ( see below and sect .",
    "7.2 ) and that the parameter space is scanned consistently no a - priori fixing any parameter . in crosas & menten ,",
    "the dust - to - gas ratio is _ fixed _ at a value of 0.01 .",
    "they find a good fit using a distance of 150 pc , a mass loss rate of 3.25 @xmath10 10@xmath14 m@xmath2 yr@xmath7 , a co abundance of 6 @xmath10 10@xmath15 , and a dust - gas momentum transfer rate @xmath16 of 0.025 for the inner region ( @xmath17 cm ) , and 0.018 for the outer region .",
    "they conclude there is no need for a hot inner core .    in all the model calculations mentioned above the effective absorption coefficient @xmath16",
    "is assumed to be a free parameter .",
    "@xmath16 describes the momentum transfer efficiency between the gas and the dust .",
    "however , we claim , and this is a key point in this paper , that effective absorption coefficient @xmath16 is not a free parameter but is related to the properties of the dust .",
    "this had been realised before but it requires the simultaneous fitting of the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) and the co data in order to estimate @xmath16 in a self - consistent way .",
    "this approach was taken in the fitting of two oh / ir stars in groenewegen ( 1994b ) and is proposed here for irc  + 10  216 .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in sects . 2 and 3",
    "the model is briefly described . in sect .",
    "4 the @xmath0co and @xmath1co j = 6 - 5 observations as well as the other co data to which the models are compared are presented . in sect .",
    "5 the results of the model calculations are described .",
    "so - called visibility curves , to be compared with future interferometric observations , are presented in sect .",
    "the paper ends with discussion and conclusions in sect .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     the uncertainty in the mass loss rate and dust - to - gas ratio derived from the dust shell is about 8% and 6% due to uncertainties in the assumed mass ( varied to 0.6 m@xmath2 ) and @xmath18 ( varied to 0 km s@xmath7 ) . in the ideal situation",
    "the mass loss rates and dust - to - gas ratios from the two methods would be identical to indicate a perfectly consistent model .",
    "the best overall agreement based on this analysis is achieved for a luminosity of 15  000 l@xmath2 .    given all these considerations",
    "it is likely that the luminosity of irc  + 10  216 is between 10  000 and 15  000 l@xmath2  and its distance is between 110 and 135 pc . the present - day mass loss rate is ( 1.5 @xmath5 0.3 ) @xmath6 m@xmath2 yr@xmath7  and the gas - to - dust ratio is about 700 @xmath5 100 .",
    "the dust opacity at 60 @xmath8 m is found to be of order 250 @xmath9gr@xmath7 .",
    "the co abundance is 1.1 @xmath10 10@xmath11 relative to h@xmath12 .",
    "compared to the previously proposed models mentioned in the introduction this represents a somewhat lower mass loss rate , partly because these other models adopted larger distances as well in many cases .",
    "the co abundance is larger than in most previous models , but in agreement with theoretical expectations .",
    "the gas - to - dust ratio we find is larger that the canonical value of 200 often quoted . on the other hand",
    "there have been other recent studies that found larger gas - to - dust ratios for carbon stars as well , e.g. a gas - to - dust ratio of 550 for irc  + 10  216 for a distance of 135 pc ( ivezi & elitzur 1996 ) , a value of 1230 for irc  + 10  216 ( winters et al .",
    "1997b ) , a value of 530 for afgl 3068 ( winters et al .",
    "note that in the model of crosas & menten ( 1997 ) the gas - to - dust ratio is fixed at 100 , and they mention that a larger value would result in lines that are consistently too low .",
