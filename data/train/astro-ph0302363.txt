    "recent chandra observations have shown that nearby spiral galaxies similar to the milky way ( e.g. , m81 , @xcite ) contain hundreds of discrete x - ray sources .",
    "the source numbers are even large in giant ellipticals , starburst galaxies and mergers ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "while these sources are an inhomogeneous population , the majority of them are believed to be x - ray binaries ( xrbs ) containing a black hole or neutron star .",
    "the x - rays from these binaries are powered by accretion , with the duration of their x - ray phases limited by the supply of accreting material from their companion stars , which are mostly main - sequence or giant stars .",
    "the lifespans of xrbs are therefore finite .",
    "if the averaged mass - transfer rates are higher for brighter systems , then brighter xrbs are short - lived .    for the x - ray luminosities of the chandra sources in galaxies at distances of a few mpc ( @xmath2 ) , the duration of their mass - transfer ( x - ray ) phase are shorter than @xmath3  yr .",
    "these timescales are short in comparison with the dynamical timescales of galaxies , which are usually longer than @xmath3  yr .",
    "xrbs are thus formed and then cease to be x - ray active within the lifetime of their host galaxies . as the formation of xrbs is a ongoing process like the formation of normal stars , xrbs populate not just starburst galaxies but galaxies of different ages and of different hubble types .",
    "if a galaxy is undisturbed so that its stellar population ages smoothly , then the formation of xrbs is also likely to be a smooth process . if the galaxy has an episode of vigorous star - formation triggered by galactic interaction or merging , then enhancement in the rates of xrb formation will subsequently occur .",
    "the xrb populations are therefore tracers of the dynamical history of galaxies .    here",
    ", we construct a birth - death model and use it to describe the time - dependent evolution of the xrb populations in galaxies .",
    "we show that the model is able to qualitatively explain the morphology of x - ray luminosity functions of xrbs in nearby galaxies .",
    "in particular , the model provides a mechanism for the formation of a luminosity break in the log(@xmath0)log(@xmath1 ) curves of the xrbs ( where @xmath1 is the observed x - ray flux ) .",
    "the implications of the results from this study on our understanding of galactic dynamics and evolution are briefly discussed .",
    "for an xrb population in a galaxy with the number of systems within a luminosity range @xmath4 at time @xmath5 specified by @xmath6 , the cumulative luminosity distribution of xrbs is @xmath7 as the sources are more or less at the same distance @xmath8 , we can adopt @xmath9 , where the observed flux @xmath10 . for a population of systems determined only by birth and death processes ( the beginning and end of the x - ray active phase , respectively ) ,",
    "the evolution of @xmath11 is governed by a linear differential equation of the form @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the birth rate and @xmath14 is the death rate .      as a simple illustration ,",
    "consider the case in which ( i ) the sources have a finite x - ray phase duration @xmath15 , say , proportional to @xmath16 , ( ii ) the source brightnesses are constant throughout the x - ray phase , and ( iii ) the sources are born at the same time , @xmath17 .",
    "we further consider a birth - rate function @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the brightness distribution of the sources at birth , and @xmath20 is the usual dirac @xmath21-function . in an absolute deterministic case , the death - rate is a time translation of the birth rate : @xmath22 .    when @xmath13 and @xmath14 are so specified , we can integrate equation ( 2 ) with respect to @xmath5 , yielding @xmath23     \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath24 are the heaviside unit step - functions .",
    "the constant @xmath25 is zero , because of the assumption that no systems are born except at @xmath17 .",
    "the result here is clear  we only see xrb after a time @xmath17 , and we will not see systems with @xmath26 after a time @xmath27 . moreover , the bright systems disappear first , followed by fainter systems . if @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is a constant , then a step - like luminosity cutoff is formed at @xmath30^{-1}$ ] in @xmath11 and in the cumulative luminosity distribution @xmath31 . as the xrb population ages",
    ", the cutoff migrates from high to low luminosities ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "galaxies also have continuous formation of xrbs due to ongoing star - formation ( such as young high - mass xrbs in the arms of spiral galaxies ) or orbital and nuclear evolution of binary systems ( such as old low - mass xrbs in elliptical galaxies or in bulges of spiral galaxies ) .",
    "this will produce a population of xrbs in addition to those formed as a result of starbursts . if @xmath5 is large such that the birth and death of the xrbs due to continuous formation has reached an equilibrium , such that @xmath32 , the linearity of the formulation allows us to simply set a non - zero @xmath25 in equation ( 3 ) and obtain a solution immediately .",
    "provided that the xrb population due to the starburst dominates , the luminosity cutoff should be evident ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "the formulation can be easily generalised to take into account the delay in the xrb formation after a starburst episode at @xmath17 .",
    "we can parametrise the delay @xmath33 as a function @xmath26 , such that @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "it is again straightforward to integrate equations ( 2 ) and ( 1 ) directly and show qualitatively that the shape of the @xmath36 distribution of the xrbs obtained in the idealised case still hold .",
    "the only difference is that now the luminosity cutoff is no longer step - like",
    ". a more realistic and comprehensive modeling of the delay effects will be presented in wu et al .",
    "( in preparation ) .",
    "the purely deterministic approach given above needs to be modified because the onset of the x - ray phases of xrbs can not be simultaneous and the systems may undergo transitions between bright and faint states .",
    "the observed luminosities @xmath26 are not simply the lifespan - averaged luminosities which can be related to the duration of the x - ray active phase",
    ". also , the lifespans of the sources are characterised by their internal clocks , which are the individual source ages @xmath37 , and they are not the same as the external clock by which the time parameter @xmath5 specifying the evolution of the xrb population has been defined .",
    "the ages of individual systems are not direct observables in the study of populations of xrbs in galaxies .",
    "only globally - averaged properties such as luminosity distributions can be measured .",
    "hence , the death rate , defined in terms of @xmath5 , can not be considered as the time translation of the birth rate .",
    "if we assume that the systems with an observed luminosity @xmath26 have a death rate which is specified by a probability mortality function @xmath38 , and that the birth of xrbs is a poisson process subject to a birth rate at time @xmath5 , we can construct a simple statistical / stochastic birth - death formulation to describe the time - dependent evolution of the xrb population .",
    "the corresponding equation is @xmath39 ( @xcite , @xcite ) . as an approximation",
    ", we define @xmath38 to be the inverse of the characteristic lifespan @xmath15 , such that @xmath40 implies @xmath41 , where @xmath29 is a constant . for simplicity",
    "we neglect the delay in the formation of xrbs with respect to the starburst at time @xmath17 and assume that the birth function due to the starburst takes the form @xmath42 .",
    "thus , we have @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the continuous component of the birth rate of xrbs and @xmath45 is a parameter specifying the relative strength of the starburst component . as @xmath13 and @xmath15 are now specified , equations ( 4 ) and ( 1 ) can be solved , yielding @xmath11 and @xmath31 .",
    "an important property of the solutions is that , at any time @xmath5 , the starburst component of @xmath11 has a cutoff at a critical luminosity @xmath30^{-1}$ ] . here",
    "the cutoff is exponential , whereas in the idealised deterministic model considered above it is step - like .",
    "the location of the cutoff of the two cases is , however , identical .",
    "the cutoff causes an exponential luminosity break in the @xmath36 distribution . including time - delay effects in the formulation",
    "will not eliminate the luminosity cutoff but , instead , will cause @xmath36 to appear as a broken power law for a power - law form @xmath19 ( soria , private communication ) . for the continuous component of @xmath11",
    "there is no cutoff at @xmath30^{-1}$ ] .",
    "the corresponding cutoff is at @xmath46^{-1}$ ] , where @xmath47 is the age of the host galaxy .",
    "the luminosity break is therefore robust , and it is a characteristic of aging of a population of xrbs born as a consequence of an episode of star - formation in the recent past",
    ".    we must emphasise that the results obtained from the above formulation should be interpreted in a probabilistic and statistical context .",
    "the formulation allows the presence of systems with luminosity @xmath26 brighter than the characteristic cutoff luminosity because the birth of xrbs is a poisson process in the time domain and because the observed @xmath26 is an instantaneous quantity while the duration of the x - ray phase of an xrbs is related only to the luminosity averaged over the lifespan of the source .",
    "moreover , @xmath11 is the expected value over an ensemble of sources with a distribution of ages which is not directly observable .",
    "( for more details , see @xcite . )",
    "nevertheless , the results obtained by the deterministic and stochastic formulations are qualitatively similar , as can be demonstrated using the following example .",
    "consider a simple birth - rate function , @xmath48 $ ] , where @xmath45 is now the ratio of the strength of the impulsive starburst component to that of the continuous formation component .",
    "( here we assume the same initial xrb brightness distributions for the two components . )",
    "then we have @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the initial population . by comparing the last term in equation ( 5 ) with equation ( 3 ) ( with @xmath51 ) , we can easily see their similar time - dependent behaviours . also , for @xmath52 , the second term in equation ( 5 ) becomes @xmath53 , which is independent of @xmath5 just as is the term @xmath25 in equation ( 3 ) .",
    "consider an initial population and a birth rate in power - law forms with the lower cutoff below the limit of detection @xmath54 , i.e. , @xmath55 and @xmath56 , where @xmath57 and @xmath58 are constants .",
    "then the cumulative luminosity distribution is @xmath59 \\nonumber \\\\      & & \\ + \\ { a f_{\\rm o * } } l_*[\\beta l _ * ( t - t_{\\rm a})]^{\\alpha_2 - 1 }    \\nonumber \\\\        & & \\hspace*{0.85 cm }        \\times \\ \\gamma\\big(1-\\alpha_2 , \\beta l ( t - t_{\\rm a } ) \\big )       \\theta ( t - t_{\\rm a } ) \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath60 is the incomplete gamma function .",
    "figure 2 shows four examples of @xmath36 calculated from this model .",
    "the luminosity break is clearly present for the impulsive - starburst component .",
    "by adjusting the relative strengths of the continuous and starburst components , we can obtain a form of @xmath36 which is a single power law or which has a luminosity break .",
    "note the curve in panel ( a ) are very similar to what is observed in m81 ( fig .",
    "above the completeness limit , the log(@xmath0)log(@xmath1 ) curves of xrbs in individual nearby galaxies can be described as a single or a broken power law . separating the sources in the bulge and disk of the spiral galaxy m81",
    "reveals that the log(@xmath0)log(@xmath1 ) curves of the xrbs in the two galactic components are different ( @xcite ) . while the log(@xmath0)log(@xmath1 ) curve of the disk sources is a single power law , that of the bulge sources is a broken power law . a power - law form for log(@xmath0)log(@xmath1 ) curve is generally found for xrbs in galaxies or galactic components with strong ongoing star - formation activity ( e.g. , the disk of m101 , @xcite ; the nuclear region of m83 , @xcite ; and the starburst galaxy m82 ) .",
    "broken power - law log(@xmath0)log(@xmath1 ) curves are , on the other hand , found for the sources in early - type galaxies ( e.g.  ngc  4697 , @xcite ) and the bulges of spiral galaxies ( e.g.  m31 , @xcite )    @xcite proposed that the luminosity break is caused by a population of xrbs containing a neutron star which accretes at the eddington limit . using the stochastic formulation described above and assuming the eddington luminosity limit ( @xmath61 ) for the neutron - star xrbs , it can be shown that a prominent luminosity break can be created ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the break marks the eddingtion limit for 1.5-m@xmath62 compact objects . as this break is stationary and",
    "has the same value for all galaxies , it can be used as a distance indicator ( @xcite ) .    while it is possible that the luminosity breaks in the log(@xmath0)log(@xmath1 ) curves of elliptical galaxies are caused by the luminosity limit of neutron - star xrbs",
    ", the luminosity breaks in the log(@xmath0)log(@xmath1 ) curves of m31 ( @xcite ) and of the bulge sources in m81 ( @xcite ) at about @xmath63 must be due to another mechanism .    from the birth - death model",
    ", we can see that a natural explanation for the luminosity break is the aging of a populations of xrbs born at approximately the same time in the recent past .",
    "if this explanation is correct , then the location of the break marks the starburst epoch and the luminosity function becomes an indicator of the age of the host galaxy ( or the host galactic component ) .",
    "the location of the break for the chandra sources in the m81 bulge , for example , indicates that @xmath64 , which is consistent with the time m81 underwent a close encounter with its neighbor m82 ( @xcite )    we thank r. soria for discussion . k.w .",
