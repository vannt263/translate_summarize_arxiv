    "the synchronization in coupled oscillators has intensively been studied  @xcite .",
    "one of the recent topics is the synchronization in various types of networks  @xcite .",
    "the network structure itself is intensively investigated in physics .",
    "there are some reports on the network structure of power grids .",
    "barabsi and albert reported that a power grid in the western united states is a scale - free network  @xcite ; however , some other authors reported that the link number distribution of transmission lines is an exponential distribution  @xcite .",
    "a serious issue in power grids is a large - scale electric failure called blackout  @xcite .",
    "blackout or cascade failure in power grids is disastrous in the modern society .",
    "since the alternating current ( ac ) system is used in power grids , not only the network structure but also electric potentials and phase variables are important for describing the behavior of power grids quantitatively .",
    "for example , the power supply to consumers becomes impossible , when the power demand is beyond the threshold .",
    "this is called the voltage collapse .",
    "another important phenomenon in power grids is the step out , in which the frequency of a generator deviates from the standard frequency such as 50 or 60 hz owing to the very large power demand .",
    "these electric failures can lead to a large - scale blackout .",
    "several authors proposed some coupled oscillator models for describing the dynamical behaviors of power grids  @xcite .",
    "we proposed a phase model with feedback control to maintain the standard frequency , and showed a cascade failure in a square lattice and a scale - free network  @xcite . in this study",
    ", we numerically investigate the phase model in a network corresponding to the actual power grid in the kyushu region .",
    "the network is composed of @xmath0 nodes of power stations and transformer substations and the transmission lines connecting the nodes .",
    "the total number of power stations in our model is @xmath1 , which are denoted by squares in fig .",
    "there are various magnitudes of power stations or generators in the kyushu region .",
    "for example , the maximum output power of the `` genkai '' nuclear power plant is @xmath2 kw and the maximum output powers of the `` ohmuta '' solar power plant is @xmath3 kw .",
    "the sum of the maximum output powers of the 15 power stations is @xmath4 kw . in our previous work , we studied model systems in a square lattice and a scale - free network , where the maximum output powers of generators were assumed to be the same . in real power grids ,",
    "the maximum output powers of generators are very widely distributed . in this paper",
    ", we will propose a simple and rather effective feedback control method applied in such heterogeneous systems .",
    "the @xmath5 nodes denoted by the plus sign in fig .",
    "1 are transformer substations .",
    "the links between the generators and the transformer substation and between two transformer substations are transmission lines .",
    "there are two types of transmission lines , i.e. , 500kv transmission lines and 275kv transmission lines .",
    "transmission lines of lower voltage are extended from the transformer substations to local consumers , but they are not shown in fig .  1 . in our model , the lower - level power grids are effectively treated as consumed electric power at the transformer substations .",
    "we explain the phase model of power grids proposed in the previous paper  @xcite . in synchronous generators , the rotational motion of a turbine",
    "is driven by mechanical power such as the steam power generated by burning fuel .",
    "the rotational motion is directly transformed into the sinusoidal alternating current .",
    "the phase variable of the alternating current for the @xmath6th generator is denoted as @xmath7 .",
    "we use another phase variable , @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the standard frequency 50 or 60 hz , because the phase @xmath10 is more convenient for denoting the deviation from the standard frequency . the equation for @xmath10",
    "is assumed to obey @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the damping constant , @xmath13 denotes the input power to the @xmath6th generator , and @xmath14 is the output power from the @xmath6th generator .",
    "the output power @xmath14 is expressed as @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the electric potential at the @xmath6th generator , and @xmath17 denotes the admittance between the @xmath6th and @xmath18th nodes . here , we have assumed that the resistance @xmath19 between the @xmath6th and @xmath18th nodes is neglected for simplicity . the summation in eq .",
    "( 2 ) is taken for all @xmath18 nodes linked to the @xmath6th generator .",
    "the electric potential @xmath16 and the admittance @xmath17 are normalized using base values of the electric potential such as 500 or 275 kv and an electric power of 1000 mw .",
    "the admittance of the transmission line depends on the distance between the two nodes , which is evaluated from the map shown in fig .  1 .",
    "in this paper , the output voltage @xmath16 for generators is assumed to take a constant value of 1 in the normalized unit .",
    "the generated electric power is transmitted through the transfer substations to consumers .",
    "we assume that a constant quantity of electric power is consumed under the @xmath6th transfer substation .",
    "the consumed electric power at the @xmath6th node is expressed by the complex number @xmath20 , where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the effective power and reactive power , respectively .",
    "the complex power @xmath20 is expressed as @xmath23 , where @xmath16 is the electric potential , @xmath24 is the current supplied to the @xmath6th node , and @xmath25 implies the complex conjugate . from the conservation law of current , @xmath24 is expressed as @xmath26 the powers @xmath21 and @xmath22 are therefore given by @xmath27 the summation is taken for all nodes @xmath18 linked to the @xmath6th node .",
    "the feedback control is applied to maintain the standard frequency .",
    "one of the simplest model of feedback control is @xmath28 where @xmath29 denotes the strength of the feedback control . if @xmath30 is positive or the frequency is higher than the standard value , the input torque power @xmath13 decreases .",
    "conversely , if @xmath30 is negative or the frequency is lower than the standard value , the input torque power increases .",
    "if the feedback control works well , the frequency @xmath30 is maintained at zero , and the entire power system including the generators and loads works at the standard frequency @xmath9 .",
    "the above feedback control method is a local feedback , because the input power to the @xmath6th generator is controlled by the local value @xmath30 of the same generator .",
    "the actual power system is regulated not only by such a local feedback but also by the global control from the control center using all the information of the network .",
    "a relation expressing such a nonlocal feedback control is written as @xmath31 where @xmath32 denotes the effect from the @xmath18th generator to the @xmath6th generator .    if the power demand expressed by @xmath14",
    "is too large , the input power @xmath13 can not respond to the excessive demand .",
    "if generators are overloaded , they might break down . to avoid such breakdown ,",
    "generators are stopped , or the overall synchronization would be lost .",
    "that is , a loss of synchronization would occur , which is called the step out .",
    "if some generators stop , the load to other generators increases and some other generators are overloaded successively .",
    "this leads to a cascade failure .",
    "to express such a situation , we assume a simple rule that @xmath16 is set to zero if @xmath13 is beyond the critical value @xmath33 , where @xmath33 can be interpreted as the maximum output power of the @xmath6th generator .",
    "the magnitudes of @xmath33 are very widely distributed in our network , because various types of generators work in the kyushu region .",
    "if @xmath34 is set to zero , the function of the generator is lost .",
    "this is equivalent to the removal of the generator node @xmath6 from the network .    in our model ,",
    "the sum of the maximum output powers of the 15 power stations is fixed at @xmath35 .",
    "similarly , the sum of the consumed effective powers is expressed as @xmath36 , and the sum of the reactive powers is @xmath37 . in our model power grid , we assume that the consumed power @xmath21 at the @xmath6th node is proportional to the population @xmath38 in the area around the @xmath6th node , which is also estimated from the map , and the ratio of @xmath22 to @xmath21 is constant .",
    "the ratio of the total consumed power to the total maximum output power of generators is called the utilization ratio @xmath39 . using these assumptions , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are expressed as @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the utilization ratio of the electric power , and @xmath42 denotes the power factor . in our setting , the effective power of @xmath43 is consumed in the entire region and the effective power for each area around the @xmath6th node is proportional to the population of the area .",
    "the utilization ratio @xmath44 implies that the maximum output power from the generators is completely consumed in the entire region .",
    "the phase @xmath10 and electric potential @xmath16 are determined by solving the coupled equations eqs .",
    "( 4 ) and ( 5 ) for the assigned values of @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "these coupled equations can be numerically solved by an iterative method .",
    "if @xmath21 and @xmath22 are sufficiently small , there are two stationary solutions : one is stable and the other is unstable .",
    "however , if the effective power @xmath21 is gradually increased , the stable solution @xmath16 decreases and the unstable one increases . at a critical value of @xmath21 ,",
    "the stable and unstable solutions merge and disappear .",
    "there are no stationary solutions beyond the critical value .",
    "this phenomenon is called the voltage collapse .",
    "if the voltage collapse occurs , the voltage @xmath16 decreases rapidly .",
    "generally , the voltage collapse occurs more easily if the reactive power @xmath22 is large .",
    "if the voltage collapse occurs , there is no stationary solution , or the power supply to the @xmath6th node becomes impossible . in our simple model , @xmath16 is set to zero when @xmath34 decreases to zero .",
    "this is equivalent to removing the node @xmath6 from the network .",
    "the two removal rules correspond to the two types of electric failures , i.e. , the step out and voltage collapse .",
    "we numerically study electric failures in the model network using the phase model with feedback control , as the utilization ratio @xmath39 is increased .",
    "the parameter @xmath12 is fixed to be 1 .",
    "the initial values of @xmath45 , @xmath10 , and @xmath30 are set to 0 in our numerical simulation .     as a function of the utilization ratio @xmath39.,height=132 ]",
    "firstly , we show synchronization - desynchronization transitions when only one generator is controlled by the local feedback , as expressed by eq .",
    "figure 2 shows the average frequency @xmath46 , where @xmath47 denotes the long - time average when @xmath48 and @xmath49 for the other generators . here , the first generator is the generator at genkai with the largest maximum output power .",
    "that is , the feedback control is set only for the first generator .",
    "the input power @xmath13 for @xmath50 is fixed to be @xmath51 .",
    "the parameter @xmath52 is set to be 0 ; therefore , the power factor is 1 .",
    "when the utilization ratio @xmath39 is between 0.4 and 0.6 , the average frequency is maintained to be 0 .",
    "the average frequency of all the generators is 0 by the mutual synchronization .",
    "the standard frequency is realized in this power grid owing to the local feedback control and mutual synchronization .",
    "when @xmath39 is smaller than 0.4 , the torque @xmath53 of the first generator becomes 0 . the total input power @xmath54 is larger than the power demand @xmath55 , and the frequency of generators becomes larger than 0 continuously . on the other hand ,",
    "the input power @xmath53 of the first generator reaches its maximum @xmath56 , and the first generator stops when @xmath39 is larger than 0.6 .",
    "the total input power @xmath54 is insufficient for the power demand .",
    "then the frequency of generators decreases from the standard value discontinuously , because the input power of the first generator decreases to 0 discontinuously .",
    "it is desirable to maintain the standard frequency up to @xmath44 , where the maximum output of all generators is completely consumed by consumers ; however , electric failure tends to occur easily when @xmath39 is close to 1 .",
    "we propose a local feedback control method of the following form as one efficient feedback control method : @xmath57 it is a feature of this method that the strength of the feedback is proportional to the maximum output power of the generator .",
    "the method works fairly well as shown in the following , even if the maximum output powers of generators are very widely distributed .",
    "figure 3(a ) shows the number ratio @xmath58 for @xmath59 .",
    "the number ratio of the step out , @xmath58 , is zero up to @xmath60 , and increases stepwise to 0.133 at @xmath61 and to 0.8 at @xmath62 .",
    "this implies that the power grid is rather stable .",
    "a cascade failure is observed at @xmath62 , because the step out of some generators makes the surviving generators overloaded , and it leads to the step out of the surviving ones .",

    "a few generators with small maximum output power exhibited the step out and links from the nodes disappeared .",
    "the links from the step - out generators disappeared successively , and only three generators survived at @xmath64 after the cascade failure .",

    "that is , the step out occurs for a very small @xmath39 .",
    "this is because generators with a small maximum output power tend to exhibit the step out easily even for a rather small @xmath39 .",

    "the feedback control is proportional to the maximum output power @xmath33 of each generator , which is the same as the local feedback model expressed by eq .",
    "this feedback control is a global feedback in that the average @xmath78 of all the generators is used for controlling the @xmath6th generator .",
    "because the initial values of @xmath13 are set to zero and @xmath79 takes the same value for all @xmath6 s , @xmath80 is proportional to @xmath33 for any time in this feedback control method .",

    "this is because the loss at the transmission lines is assumed to be zero . when @xmath13 becomes @xmath33 for all the generators , @xmath85 which implies that @xmath39 is equal to 1",

    "we have checked it by the direct numerical simulation .",

    "@xmath58 is 0 up to @xmath44 and jumps to 1 for @xmath86 .",

    "( 9 ) is carried out . as an example",

    "the other parameters are set to be @xmath99 , @xmath59 , and @xmath100 . the instant frequency @xmath30 and its average @xmath88 oscillate owing to the periodic change in the input power @xmath101 .",

    "the dashed line indicates @xmath105 . the amplitude @xmath91 changes with @xmath92 ; however , the dependence is not very large and it can be approximated at @xmath106 .",
    "this result suggests that the temporal variation in the input power is averaged out by the mutual synchronization among generators . if the temporal variation in @xmath88 is too large , various harmful effects appear in the electric systems .",
    "it is desirable that the oscillation amplitude in the entire power grid can be reduced by the mutual synchronization .",
