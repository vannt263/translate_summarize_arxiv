    "detection of the mott insulating transition is a desirable function for the first - principles calculations , which has been demanded for years .",
    "a recently developed multi - reference density functional theory with the fluctuation reference method defines a self - consistent first - principles calculation , in which a short - range correlation effect is explicitly included.@xcite this technique is a generalization of the kohn - sham scheme of the electronic structure calculation.@xcite incorporation of the effective many - body system to determine the total energy and the single - particle charge density of the electronic state became possible through 1 ) introduction of a fluctuation - counting term and 2 ) the reformulation of the exchange correlation energy functional as a residual exchange correlation energy functional .",
    "the effective hamiltonian appearing in the theory is a kind of the hubbard model@xcite or the anderson model@xcite .",
    "the lda+u hamiltonian@xcite is derived as an approximation for the residual exchange correlation functional.@xcite    in this short paper , i show a technique to determine the mott insulating phase in this first - principles calculation .",
    "the method is an application of the momentum boost technique known in the literature.@xcite to introduce the momentum boost method in the density functional theory , one needs to show the n representability .",
    "this is done by extending the harriman construction@xcite for the twisted boundary condition .",
    "a test calculation will be shown using a simple artificial system , which may be represented by a one - dimensional hubbard model . in the last part",
    ", i will summarize the present work .",
    "i consider a born - von - karman boundary condition with a twist .",
    "consider an array of atoms in one dimension and let @xmath0 the number of atoms in the direction , which is called the @xmath1 direction below . formally using a phase @xmath2 with @xmath3 and a unit flux @xmath4",
    ", i introduce a twisted boundary condition in this @xmath1 direction .",
    "@xmath5 here , i used a combined coordinate @xmath6 with the space and spin coordinates .",
    "@xmath7 is a unit vector and @xmath8 is the lattice constant in the @xmath1 direction .",
    "@xmath9 is a many - body wavefunction and @xmath10 is a creation operator defined with a properly determined wannier basis @xmath11 .",
    "indeed , determining a wannier transformation fixing a gauge in the unitary transformation,@xcite the set of @xmath11 is uniquely determined in each self - consistent step of the extended kohn - sham scheme.@xcite    using another gauge transformation , the twisted boundary condition is represented by shifted @xmath12 vectors , @xmath13 , for the single - particle bloch orbitals . here",
    "@xmath14 is an integer within a range of @xmath15 . from the single - particle energy @xmath16",
    ", one may construct a tight - binding model written in @xmath10 and @xmath17 .",
    "determining the eigen energy of the effective fermion system , one has an energy - flow diagram as a function of @xmath18 .",
    "if the system is a metal , the flow given by adiabatic connection of the ground state should show a long extended ab period , while the period has to be @xmath4 , when there is a charge gap due to formation of a mott gap .",
    "although the density - functional theory utilized in the present work is the ground - state formulation , one can have a signal of the change in the period as disappearance of a cusp in the lowest - energy flow . in case of the mott insulator ,",
    "the flux line becomes a smooth curve without any cusp .",
    "the appearance of the isolated lowest flow lie implies uniqueness of the ground state separated by a gap from charge excitations in the whole range of twist and thus indicates the formation of the mott gap .",
    "if one has a difficulty in finding the change of the period with a three - dimensional sample , one may consider a one - dimensional setup using a needle like sample .    before discussing the result ,",
    "i show that the @xmath19 representability of the present problem is guaranteed . in the present setup ,",
    "only the boundary condition in the @xmath1 direction is a twisted one .",
    "thus i consider a slice of the charge density @xmath20 fixing @xmath21 and @xmath22 coordinate for simplicity .",
    "we are seeking for @xmath23 satisfying @xmath24 where @xmath12 is an integer , @xmath25 and @xmath26 . in the twisted boundary condition",
    ", however , @xmath27 obeys the periodic boundary condition as @xmath28 here , integration with respect to @xmath29 should be interpreted as a summation .",
    "thus , we can readily prepare the orbital @xmath23 obeying the twisted boundary condition as , @xmath30 with @xmath31 we can immediately show that a set of @xmath23 forms complete orthonormal and that @xmath32 using the orbital wavefunction @xmath23 obeying the twisted boundary condition , we can show existence of a many - body state @xmath33 whose coordinate expression is the single slater determinant made on @xmath23 .",
    "as a test calculation , i consider a one - dimensional hydrogen array .",

    "the lattice parameters for the inner cell are @xmath34 and @xmath35",
    ". the determination of @xmath36 may be achieved by setting a reference calculation.@xcite here , to show the change in the period explicitly , i consider @xmath37 as a parameter and do only the self - consistent calculation for the extended - kohn - sham system . here",
    ", @xmath38 is the value of the nearest - neighbor transfer parameter .",
    "note that the present system is represented by a tight - binding model with long - range hopping terms .",
    "for the exchange - correlation energy functional , i utilized the perdew - zunger parameterization of the ceperley - alder diffusion monte - carlo data.@xcite the troullier - martins soft pseudopotential is used with the cut - off energy of 20 [ ry].@xcite this setup is confirmed to be enough accurate for the discussion below by increasing the parameters .",

    "this result is qualitatively the same as the single - band hubbard model with only the nearest neighbor hopping.@xcite if the fluctuation reference method is precisely applied , a finite value of @xmath36 is expected , since the inter - atomic distance of @xmath41 is in a strong - correlation regime for the hydrogen molecule.@xcite thus the present result gives a concrete test for the method of determination of the mott insulator from the first - principles .",
