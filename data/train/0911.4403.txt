    "in supersymmetry the fermionic partners of charged higgs and @xmath0 gauge bosons , the higgsinos and winos , mix to form a pair of charged fermions called charginos , @xmath1 @xcite . in many supersymmetric scenarios they are light enough to be produced at the lhc and ilc ,",

    "the full potential of this calculation will become available when quantum corrections to polarized chargino decays are incorporated , as indicated by the tree - level analysis of the importance of spin correlation between chargino production and decay @xcite .    in order to handle the full one - loop calculation we use form - factors to organize the bubble and triangular diagrams , and @xmath4-charges to merge form - factors with box diagrams .",

    "all of these figures have the same structure and differ in the chargino helicities and the electron polarization . in all plots we show @xmath190 gev because it is the most interesting region , with larger cross sections and better chances of differentiation from background .     as a function of @xmath181 in the focus point scenario within msugra.[focus_point_lpm],width=340 ]    in fig .  [ focus_point_lpm ]",
    "we have @xmath191 , i.e. , for a chargino with positive helicity , an antichargino with negative helicity , and a left handed electron ( right handed positron ) . on the left we have the differential cross section as a function of @xmath181 , where we compare the born approximation , the one - loop corrected cross section including mssm and qed corrections , and the corrected cross section including mssm , qed , and leading logarithms .",
    "qed+mssm corrections are moderate and negative , varying between -1% and -18% , as can be seen also in the lower right frame .",
    "leading logarithms are very large , and increase the differential cross section even more , except at large @xmath181 , where @xmath161 are negative .",
    "the largest positive corrections are obtained for low transverse momentum , @xmath192 gev , while the largest negative corrections appear at @xmath193 gev .",
    "this choice for the chargino helicities and electron polarization gives the highest values for the differential cross section , varying between 0.2 and 2.1 fb / gev .",
    "in the upper right frame we show the mssm and qed corrections separately from each other , and compared with the born approximation .",
    "we see that the qed corrections ( not including leading logarithms ) are smaller than 1% .     as a function of @xmath181 in the focus point scenario within msugra.[focus_point_lmp],width=351 ]    in fig .",

    "we observe that qed+mssm corrections are larger in magnitude than the previous case , and also negative .",
    "note that here the relative magnitude of the corrections decrease with @xmath181 , as opposed to the previous case , where they increase .",
    "another difference with the previous case is that qed corrections are larger , but smaller in magnitude than mssm corrections , as seen in the upper - right frame .",
    "this is a case where qed quantum corrections should not be neglected .",
    "the leading logarithms are usually positive , but become negative at large @xmath181 , owing to the fact that at large @xmath181 , @xmath168 is required to be larger than @xmath195 , thereby reducing the @xmath168-dependent phase - space factor @xmath196 in eq.([lleq ] ) .",
    "all the above differences between the corrections to @xmath197 and @xmath198 are interesting manifestations of the parity violation properties of the mssm .     as a function of @xmath181 in the focus point scenario within msugra.[focus_point_lpp],width=351 ]    in fig .",
    "[ focus_point_lpp ] we see the equal chargino helicity production cross section .",
    "cp invariance , which we assume , enforces the equality of @xmath199 and @xmath200 , and it serves as a check of our calculations .",
    "this cross section is much smaller , varying from less than 0.001 fb / gev at low @xmath181 up to almost 0.2 fb / gev at large @xmath181 . in the lower - right frame",
    "we see that qed+mssm quantum corrections are negative at large @xmath181 , and positive at low @xmath181 , although in that case they are correcting a cross section which is already very small at tree - level . from the upper - right frame",
    "we learn that qed corrections are smaller than mssm corrections , however they can not be neglected at medium values for @xmath181 .",
    "leading logarithms are comparatively large , but in absolute terms they are smaller than in the different helicity cases .     as a function of @xmath181 in the focus point scenario within msugra.[focus_point_rpm],width=351 ]    in the next three figures we plot differential cross sections where right handed electrons collide with left handed positrons .",
    "these cross sections are noticeably smaller than the case with left handed electrons .",
    "the reason is an accidental cancellation between @xmath3 and photon contributions in the amplitude already present at tree - level , as it was explained before . in fig .",
    "[ focus_point_rpm ] we have @xmath201 , which varies from 0.01 to 0.2 fb / gev as @xmath181 grows from 100 gev up to 468.8 gev , which is the maximum value for @xmath181 .",
    "qed+mssm corrections vary slowly between @xmath202-@xmath203 , as seen in the lower - right frame .",
    "nevertheless , from the upper - right frame we see that most of these corrections come from mssm loops and qed can be neglected .",
    "in addition , leading logarithms can be seen in the left frame , and they are large and positive with the exception of very large @xmath181 where they can be negative .     as a function of @xmath181 in the focus point scenario within msugra.[focus_point_rmp],width=351 ]    in fig .",
    "[ focus_point_rmp ] we have @xmath204 , which is a factor 1/2 smaller than the previous one .",
    "quantum corrections corresponding to qed+mssm are larger , between @xmath205 and @xmath177 , and interestingly enough they have different sign than the case with opposite chargino helicities , thus they cancel and not add to each other as in the case for left handed electrons .",
    "nevertheless , these large corrections for right handed electrons act on a 10 times smaller cross section compared with left handed electrons .",
    "if electrons are not @xmath96 polarized ( as expected ) the pure right handed cross section will be diluted by the left handed cross section .",
    "we see from the upper - right frame that the qed corrections are of the same order than mssm ones , and non - negligible .",
    "leading logarithms are large , positive for small @xmath181 and negative for high @xmath181 .     as a function of @xmath181 in the focus point scenario within msugra.[focus_point_rpp],width=351",

    "[ focus_point_rpp ] we have the equal chargino helicities production cross section @xmath206 for the case of right handed electrons and left handed positrons .",
    "this cross section is extremely small , never bigger than 0.02 fb / gev .",
    "quantum corrections are very large at small @xmath181 , but with cross sections so small that the chance to be observed is minimal .",
    "we include it for completness .",
    "we have calculated the complete one - loop quantum corrections to the differential cross section for chargino production in electron positron collisions , at 1 tev center of mass energy , relevant for the future international linear collider . in the analysis we have included the electron and positron polarization , as well as the chargino helicities .",
    "we organize the non - qed corrections calculating the helicity amplitudes , and regularizing the ultraviolet divergences with dimensional regularization .",
    "our renormalization scheme includes on shell masses and @xmath34 running couplings .",
    "in addition , we use the dipole subtraction formalism in bremsstrahlung contributions to cancel analytically soft and collinear divergences , with infrared divergences from virtual qed corrections . the well known leading logarithms remain , and we isolate them in order to better understand quantum corrections .    we show numerical results for the focus point scenario in msugra .",
    "the dipole subtraction formalism is designed to handle analytically the divergences , therefore the use of infrared cut - offs becomes unnecessary , making the calculation numerically stable .",
    "we find important quantum corrections for differential cross sections with definite chargino helicities .",
    "the substantial differences in the nlo corrections depending on the helicities of the charginos and of the initial leptons , show that the rich structure of the mssm - in particular the parity violating properties - can be investigated , firstly by polarization of the incoming electron / proton beam and secondly by determining ( through the angular distributions of the decay products ) the helicities of the charginos produced @xcite .",
    "since charginos are unstable , the full potential of this work will be fulfilled when similar radiative corrections are included for the chargino decay , and the spin correlations between production and decay are evaluated .",
    "large corrections of the order of -18% and -35% are obtained for the largest cross sections , @xmath194 and @xmath191 .",
    "they are large enough to making it necessary to include them in any analysis for the ilc .",
