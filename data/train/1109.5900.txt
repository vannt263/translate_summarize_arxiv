    "in the past few years , direct imaging surveys have begun to build up a picture of the mass and semimajor axis distributions of substellar companions at separations beyond @xmath02030au . meanwhile ,",
    "statistical analyses of radial velocity results have tended to focus on objects with masses below @xmath010@xmath6 out to separations of @xmath03au @xcite .",
    "however , given the observational biases of radial velocity and direct imaging surveys , the separation range of @xmath0330au has remained relatively unexplored .",
    "aperture masking interferometry is a direct detection technique that is well suited for detecting substellar companions with masses of @xmath010@xmath6 and semimajor axes within @xmath030au around young , nearby stars .",
    "for instance , it has been used to conduct surveys for substellar companions around members of the upper scorpius @xcite and taurus - auriga @xcite associations , as well as to measure the dynamical mass of the brown dwarf companion to gj  802b @xcite , show that coku tau/4 is a binary system rather than a transitional disk @xcite , and place limits on possible companions existing within 10au of hr8799 @xcite .",
    "recently , the technique has also produced the first direct detection of a young exoplanet still undergoing formation within the transitional disk of lkca15 ( kraus & ireland , submitted ) and a similar detection of an object within the gap of the t cha disk .",
    "this paper presents the results of an aperture masking survey of 67  members of the ab  doradus ( ab  dor ) , @xmath1  pictoris ( @xmath1  pic ) , hercules - lyra ( her - lyr ) , tucana - horologium ( tuc - hor ) , and tw  hya ( twa ) moving groups .",
    "at least 49 of our targets have been observed previously as part of deep imaging surveys , but these observations have typically been sensitive to different orbital separations than those that are probed here .",
    "we chose our targets based on their youth ( 8200myr ) and proximity ( 586pc ) .",
    "the former ensures that any substellar companions are still glowing relatively brightly at infrared wavelengths following their recent formation , while the latter allows smaller absolute separations to be explored for a given angular separation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : am ] , we provide a brief overview of the aperture masking technique . in section  [ sec : sample ] , we describe our survey sample . in section  [ sec : obsdatared ] we summarize the observations that were made and how the data were reduced . in section  [ sec : binaryfitting ] , we explain how we searched for companions to the target stars in the reduced data and how we derived the survey detection limits . in section  [ sec : results ] we report our results , including the detections and orbits for stellar companions around hip14807 , hd16760 , hd113449 , and hd160934",
    ". however , no substellar companions were detected , and in section  [ sec : analysis ] we present a statistical analysis of this null result before concluding in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "the aperture masking technique works by placing an opaque , perforated mask at or near the pupil plane of a telescope ( @xcite ; @xcite ; more recently , see @xcite ) .",
    "this converts the single aperture into a multi - element interferometer . each pair of holes in the mask acts as an interferometric baseline , resulting in an interferogram being projected onto the image plane .",
    "the complex visibility  @xmath9 @xcite of the source brightness distribution  @xmath10 is sampled by taking the 2d fourier transform of the measured interferogram  @xmath11 .",
    "this follows from the van cittert - zernike theorem , which states that the normalized complex visibility is equal to the fourier transform of the brightness distribution : @xmath12 where the tilde denotes the fourier transform and @xmath13 is the total source flux .",
    "since the detected image is the convolution of the instrumental point spread function  ( psf ) and the source brightness distribution , this leads to : @xmath14 where @xmath15 denotes the fourier transform of the psf . in practice ,",
    "the psf is measured by observing an unresolved calibrator star , i.e.  a point source , which has unit complex visibility @xmath16 .    in this study",
    ", we used non - redundant aperture masks , with each baseline pair corresponding to a unique point on the spatial frequency plane .",
    "we used masks with 7 , 9 , and 18 holes , giving 21 , 36 , and 153 independent baselines , respectively .",
    "hole diameters and transmission fractions are provided in table  [ table : masks ] .",
    "the subaperture configurations on the masks were designed to provide a uniform and isotropic sampling of the complex visibility function , with the specific mask chosen to observe a given target depending on the target s brightness and the expected sources of systematic error .",
    "for example , although the 18 hole masks had slightly longer baselines than the 7 or 9 hole masks , they had lower total throughput with a broader psf .",
    "this meant that they could only be used with narrow band filters , which restricted their use to brighter targets .    to identify faint companions around our targets",
    ", we used a quantity derived from the complex visibility known as the closure phase  @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "the closure phase is obtained by adding the complex visibility phases around a closure triangle of subapertures .",
    "explicitly , if we denote the measured complex visibility phase between the @xmath18th and @xmath19th subapertures as @xmath20 , the intrinsic complex visibility phase as @xmath21 , and a phase error due to atmospheric and instrumental effects across the @xmath18th aperture as @xmath22 , then we have : @xmath23 importantly , the diameter of the mask holes are chosen to ensure that the wavefront phase variations across each subaperture are approximately constant so that they can be neglected .",
    "combining aperture masking with adaptive optics allows subaperture diameters that are larger than the atmospheric fried parameter and exposure times that are longer than the atmospheric coherence time to be used , providing a greater through - put of photons .",
    "it follows that the @xmath24 terms cancel out when we take the closure phase sum : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the closure phase of the triangle @xmath27 .",
    "the independence of the closure phase quantity from major sources of systematic error allows us to achieve the full interferometric resolution according to the michelson criterion , which is equal to @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the observing wavelength and @xmath30 is the longest baseline on our mask .",
    "this is the smallest angular separation for which two point sources would be fully resolved .",
    "given that the longest baseline of the masks used in this study span nearly the entire telescope aperture , this corresponds to angular scales of roughly half the single - aperture diffraction limit .",
    "in 2007 , our group initiated a search for close , faint companions around young , nearby stars using the aperture masking facilities installed on the 5.1 m hale telescope at palomar observatory in california . in subsequent years ( 20072011 )",
    "the survey was extended and made use of similar facilities installed on the 10 m keck  ii telescope at keck observatory in hawaii and the 8.2 m vlt ut4 telescope at the vlt observatory in chile .",
    "our final survey sample consisted of 67  proposed members of the ab dor @xcite , @xmath1  pic @xcite , her - lyr @xcite , tuc - hor @xcite , and twa @xcite moving groups .",
    "a concise summary of the sample is provided in table  [ table : mg ] while the full list is given in table  [ table : sample ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : sptmasses ] shows the sample members binned according to spectral type and masses .    in selecting our targets",
    ", we noted that many of the moving group members have already been identified as binary systems .",
    "the presence of a binary companion within @xmath01  of a target star reduces the ability of aperture masking to detect additional companions , because the interferograms will overlap .",
    "also , similar brightness companions at separations of @xmath01.53  can prevent the adaptive optics system from achieving a stable lock on the target . for these reasons , we chose not to include any targets in our sample that were known to be affected by such issues .",
    "we also emphasize the difficulty of assigning moving group membership to individual stars .",
    "consequently , it is possible that not all objects in our sample are necessarily young . in particular",
    ", the moving group memberships of nine of our targets ( hd89744 , hd92945 , gj466 , ekdra , hip30030 , twa-21 , twa-6 , twa-14 , twa-23 ) were either unable to be confirmed or else ruled to be unlikely by @xcite using a dynamical convergence analysis .",
    "furthermore , the existence of her - lyr as a genuine moving group is not yet as well - established as the others . to investigate",
    "how sensitive our statistical analysis presented in section  [ sec : mc ] is to the uncertain membership of these targets , we repeated the calculations separately with them included and then removed from the sample .",
    "we observed our program objects over the course of twelve  observing runs using the facility adaptive optics imagers at palomar ( pharo ) , keck ( nirc2 ) , and vlt ( conica ) between april 2007 and april 2011 .",
    "each camera has aperture masks installed at ( palomar , vlt ) or near ( keck ) the pupil stop wheels .",
    "the central wavelengths and bandpass widths for each filter used are listed in table  [ table : filters ] and details of our observations are summarized in table  [ table : observations ] . observing conditions varied widely , but we attempted to match the observations to the appropriate conditions .",
    "most of our brighter targets were observed through clouds or marginal seeing as they were the only ones we could lock the ao system on , while our fainter targets were typically observed under better conditions .",
    "our observing strategy has been described previously in @xcite .",
    "each observation consisted of 13 target - calibrator pairs , usually with @xmath01020 frames per block .",
    "we tried to choose calibrators with optical and near - infrared brightnesses that were similar to those of the target , rather than calibrators that were necessarily brighter .",
    "this was done due to concerns about the magnitude - dependence of non - common path errors in the adaptive optics system . for targets of brightness @xmath31",
    ", calibrators were chosen from the stable radial velocity stars of @xcite .",
    "for fainter stars , we could not explicitly choose calibrators that had been vetted for close binaries , so we simply chose nearby 2mass sources with similar colors and brightnesses .",
    "in all cases , we tried to select calibrators that appeared to be single and unblended in the 2mass images , as well as close to the target on the sky ( @xmath3210deg for the nidever et al sources and @xmath323deg for the 2mass sources ) .",
    "in addition to reducing overhead times , using nearby calibrators helped to minimize residual wavefront errors introduced by long telescope slews .    data reduction was performed using our group s custom - written idl pipeline ( for further details , see @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) .",
    "complex visibilities were extracted by fourier - inverting the cleaned data cubes and sampling the @xmath33-plane at points corresponding to the mask baselines .",
    "calibration was performed by subtracting the calibrator complex visibility phases from the complex visibility phases of the science targets .",
    "we used the same method as @xcite to search for companions to our targets over the separation range 20320mas .",
    "we only used closure phases in our binary model fitting , discarding the visibility amplitudes as these are more affected by systematic errors .",
    "the parameters we fit for were the angular separation @xmath34 between the primary and companion , the position angle @xmath35 of the companion , and the brightness contrast ratio @xmath36 , where @xmath37 and @xmath38 were the fluxes of the primary and companion , respectively .",
    "fitting was performed by initially fixing a high contrast ratio of @xmath39 and generating the corresponding model closure phases for each point on a grid of angular separations spanning @xmath40mas and position angles spanning @xmath41deg .",
    "the point on the @xmath34@xmath35 grid giving the lowest @xmath42 for the measured closure phase values was then taken to be the starting point for a steepest - descent search in which all three model parameters ( @xmath43 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 ) were allowed to vary .",
    "the initial grid search ensured that the final minimum reached corresponded to the global minimum .",
    "the binary fit was considered to be bona fide if it passed a 99.5% detection criterion , which has been explained in @xcite .",
    "this was done by generating 10000 artificial closure phase data sets with fourier plane sampling that was identical to that of the measured data .",
    "each artificial closure phase was randomly sampled from a gaussian distribution with a mean of zero , corresponding to an unresolved point source , and the same variance as the corresponding measured value .",
    "a best - fit companion contrast @xmath43 was then obtained for each set of artificial closure phases using @xmath42 minimization at each point on the @xmath34@xmath35 grid . once again , by searching over the entire grid we ensured that the global minimum was identified .",
    "a 99.9% detection threshold was then defined separately for five contiguous annuli ( 2040mas , 4080mas , 80160mas , 160240mas , 240320mas ) , corresponding to the 0.1th percentile of the best - fit contrasts obtained for the artificial data sets within that annulus . in other words , if the target was a point source instead of a binary , there was only a 0.1% chance that the measured closure phases would give a best - fit contrast lower than the threshold value in the annulus corresponding to the best - fit separation .",
    "this corresponds to a @xmath44 false alarm probability across the full 20320mas range .",
    "therefore , if the best - fit model satisfied this condition , the detection was considered to be real at 99.5% confidence .",
    "it was important to ensure that any high probability ( @xmath4599.5% ) detections were not caused by companions around one of the calibrators rather than around the science target .",
    "a small number of such false alarms ( @xmath05 ) did occur during the course of our analysis .",
    "such cases were usually quite straightforward to identify by systematically repeating the calibration and binary fitting , excluding one calibrator at a time . given that the calibrators did not have known ages , but were likely to be @xmath0gyr old , any companions detected around them were almost certainly not substellar , and so they were not considered further .",
    "using the method described in section  [ sec : binaryfitting ] , we identified stellar companions to four of our ab  dor targets ( hip14807 , hd16760 , hd113449 , hd160934 ) and report our best - fit binary solutions in table  [ table : binariesdetected ] .",
    "of these , the companion to hip14807 is a new discovery while the companions to hd16760 , hd113449 , and hd160934 are the same as those discovered independently using radial velocity .",
    "we describe the detected companions in sections  [ sec : hip14807][sec : hd160934 ] , and present our full survey detection limits in section  [ sec : generallimits ] .",
    "a companion was clearly detected in our keck observations of hip14807 on 2009 november 21 ( mjd 55156.2 ) at an angular separation of @xmath46mas with a contrast ratio of @xmath47 in the co filter . assuming a system age of @xmath48myr , interpolation of the nextgen isochrones of gives an estimated companion mass of @xmath4@xmath3 , which includes the uncertainty in the age and distance , as well as the uncertainty in the fitted contrast .",
    "the companion was also detected at high confidence in the palomar data from 2007 november 29 ( mjd 54433.1 ) , with a fitted contrast ratio of @xmath49 .",
    "however , this error bar is neither symmetric nor realistic , as there is a strong degeneracy between contrast and separation for small separations in aperture masking data sets .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ fig : hip14807degen ] ( see also figure 7 in @xcite , table 2 in @xcite , and figure 2 in ) .",
    "a fuller discussion of this degeneracy is provided in section 2.1 of @xcite . in cases such as these",
    ", quick data sets were taken with only one or two calibration observations . as a result ,",
    "the quoted error bars are not necessarily accurate at the few tens of a percent level , because the dispersion between calibrators is used to estimate the errors in the closure phases . despite this , global orbital fitting to multiple aperture masking data sets has been performed successfully by using a single contrast for all epochs , with the resulting astrometric fits being consistent with those obtained using other techniques , and having reduced @xmath42 of order unity ( eg .  @xcite ) .    for these reasons , we redid the binary fitting to the mjd 54433.1 data using a prior on the contrast determined from the other well - constrained fit to the mjd 55156.2 data .",
    "the results of this revised fit are given in table  [ table : binariesdetected2 ] .",
    "hd16760 is unusual because it shows signs of being both young and old .",
    "its youth is implied by its high lithium abundance , as well as its physical association with the active star hip12635 and a common proper motion with the ab dor group @xcite .",
    "its old age is implied by its low @xmath50 value ( @xmath51 kms@xmath52 , ; @xmath53 kms@xmath52 , @xcite ) and its low ca h & k activity index ( @xmath54 , @xcite ; @xmath55 , ) , which is consistent with field dwarfs ( @xmath56 , @xcite ) and inconsistent with high probability members of the 625myr hyades cluster ( @xmath57 , @xcite ) and other young stars ( see tables  58 of @xcite ) .",
    "however , we note that this system is not the only example of a binary pair showing contradictory age indicators : when examining the activity consistency of known binary pairs , @xcite identified a similar case of an inactive primary with an active companion ( hd137763 a / b ) .",
    "previous radial velocity measurements have shown that hd16760 possesses a close companion , for which sato and coworkers derived a minimum mass @xmath58 value of @xmath59@xmath6 , while bouchy and coworkers obtained a similar value of @xmath60@xmath6 .",
    "we clearly detected this companion in our keck data from 2008 december 23 ( mjd 54823.2 ) , 2009 august 6 ( mjd 55049.6 ) and 2009 november 20 ( mjd 55155.3 ) ( table  [ table : binariesdetected ] ) .",
    "taking the weighted mean of the well - constrained isochrone mass estimates , we obtain a mass of @xmath7@xmath3  for the companion , which includes the uncertainty in the age , distance and fitted contrasts .",
    "this places it well within the stellar mass range .    meanwhile , due to degeneracy between contrast and separation ( see section  [ sec : hip14807 ] ) , combined with mediocre data quality , the separation derived from the mjd 55155.3 k band data was inconsistent with the separation derived from the j and h band data taken on the same night .",
    "for this reason , we obtained a further observation the following night with the co filter , which has a very similar bandpass to the kcont filter ( see table  [ table : filters ] ; we had intended to use the kcont filter , but there was a mix - up in the filter selections ) .",
    "the binary parameters derived from this follow - up observation are in close agreement with the values obtained from the j and h band observations .",
    "we also repeated the fit to the degenerate k band data with a prior on the contrast obtained by combining the fitted contrasts to the other k band epochs .",
    "the system properties derived from this re - analysis are reported in table  [ table : binariesdetected2 ] , and agree with the values obtained for the j and h band data sets .",
    "we note , however , that the calibration error added in quadrature to obtain a reduced @xmath42 of unity for this fit was 1.8 degrees .",
    "this is unusually large and suggests that the quoted errors for the inferred parameters are likely to be underestimated somewhat .    using our multi - epoch data",
    ", we were able to derive an orbital solution for the companion . to do this , we fixed the values for the time of periastron @xmath61 , orbital period @xmath62 , orbital eccentricity @xmath63 , and argument of periastron @xmath64 published for the radial velocity orbit from @xcite .",
    "we were not able to fit for the orbital inclination @xmath18 using our aperture masking astrometry data because we only measure the axis ratio of the visual orbit , and this varies with the cosine of the inclination .",
    "hence , we are not sensitive to small changes in @xmath18 when @xmath18 is near zero , as is the case here . instead , we combined the model - dependent mass estimate obtained from the aperture masking results with the value for @xmath58 derived from the radial velocity results to calculate @xmath65deg . then with these parameters held fixed , we inferred values for the longitude of the ascending node @xmath66 and semimajor axis @xmath67 by fitting to the aperture masking astrometry listed in tables  [ table : binariesdetected ] and  [ table : binariesdetected2 ] . the final orbital solution is reported in table  [ table : systemparameters ] , and plotted in figure  [ fig : hd16760orbit ] .",
    "lastly , we note that the rotational velocity of the primary is revised upwards from @xmath68@xmath69 kms@xmath52 to @xmath702025 kms@xmath52 , a value that is more in line with other members of ab dor .",
    "however , the low ca h & k emission of hd16760 remains unexplained .",
    "the only reason we might expect to see an inclination dependence in the strength of @xmath71 is if the ca h & k emission varies with latitude on a star , such that polar areas show little emission compared to equatorial regions .",
    "we are not aware of any model that would predict this effect .",
    "we detected a companion around hd113449 in six of our data sets taken at palomar and keck between 2007 apr 6 and 2010 apr 25 ( table  [ table : binariesdetected ] ) .",
    "four of these data sets ( mjd 54196.3 , mjd 54634.2 , mjd 54821.7 , mjd 553311.4 ) were well - constrained , and taken together imply a companion mass of @xmath72@xmath3  based on the nextgen isochrones of , including the uncertainty in the age , distance and fitted contrasts .",
    "the other two data sets , however , gave fits that were degenerate in contrast and separation , as has been described above .",
    "for the first of these ( mjd 54197.6 ) , we repeated the analysis with a prior on the separation taken from the well - constrained fit to the previous night s data ( see footnote in table  [ table : binariesdetected ] ) .",
    "for the second case ( mjd 54252.1 ) , the analysis was repeated with a prior on the contrast taken from the well - constrained solutions obtained for the four other h band data sets ( see table  [ table : binariesdetected2 ] ) .",
    "the companion we report here was first announced by @xcite subsequent to the commencement of our survey . using radial velocity measurements",
    ", those authors obtained a value of @xmath73@xmath3  for the spectroscopic mass function and estimated a secondary - to - primary mass ratio of @xmath74 .",
    "in addition , using astrometry measurements made with the vlt - i they obtained a value of @xmath75 for the inclination , @xmath76 for the longitude of the ascending node and @xmath77au for the semimajor axis .",
    "we computed an orbital solution for the companion using our aperture masking astrometry ( tables  [ table : binariesdetected ] and  [ table : binariesdetected2 ] ) , allowing @xmath18 , @xmath67 , and @xmath66 to vary as free parameters in our fitting , while holding @xmath62 , @xmath61 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 fixed at the values determined cusano and coworkers .",
    "however , we found that we could not obtain a reasonable @xmath42 value with the period of @xmath78 days reported by those authors . instead",
    ", an acceptable fit was made when we allowed the period to be a free parameter , obtaining @xmath79 days .",
    "the best - fit parameters are reported in table  [ table : systemparameters ] and the corresponding orbit is plotted in figure  [ fig : hd113449orbit ] .",
    "in particular , our fitted value of @xmath80 does not agree with the value of @xmath76 reported in @xcite , but as the details of those vlt - i observations are not given , we can not make a further comparison .",
    "lastly , the dynamical mass of the system ( @xmath81@xmath3 ) appears to be underestimated by @xmath82 when compared to the isochrone - determined masses ( @xmath83@xmath3  and @xmath84@xmath3 ) .",
    "as the orbital period is @xmath01 year and the astrometric semimajor axis is comparable to the parallax , examining this discrepancy in more detail would require refitting to the raw hipparcos data .",
    "we detected a companion around hd160934 in our palomar data taken on 2008 june 23 ( mjd 54640.3 ) and keck data taken on 2010 april 26 ( mjd 55312.6 ) and 2011 april 23 ( mjd 55674.6 ) .",
    "the binary solutions are all in excellent agreement ( table  [ table : binariesdetected ] ) .",
    "we obtain a value of @xmath85@xmath3  for the companion mass by combining the estimates from each epoch .",
    "this companion was first reported by , who identified hd160934 as a spectroscopic binary with an estimated period of @xmath017.1 years and an eccentricity of @xmath63@xmath00.8 .",
    "however , these were preliminary values based on limited phase sampling , and a period of approximately half this is also consistent with the data .",
    "in fact , this shorter period is the one preferred by , who repeated the fit to the same data with a small number of more modern radial velocity measurements .",
    "furthermore , in addition to our values presented in table  [ table : binariesdetected ] , relative astrometry measurements have been published by @xcite and @xcite . using the combined data set , which is summarized in table  [ table : hd160934_allastrom ]",
    ", we performed a least - squares orbital fit and report the results in table  [ table : systemparameters ] .",
    "the solution is plotted in figure  [ fig : hd160934orbit ] . in order to achieve a reduced @xmath42 of 1.0 , we had to add an extra position angle error of 0.4 degrees to all data , which may indicate a small position angle calibration mismatch between the three instruments used in this fit . of these parameters",
    ", only @xmath61 has an uncertainty that would be significantly changed by the addition of radial velocity data , which have not been made available to us because at least one new paper including those data is in preparation ( montes , private communication ) .",
    "however , we can combine the semiamplitude of the radial velocity curve published in ( @xmath86=7.39@xmath870.22kms@xmath88 ) with our orbital fit and the hipparcos parallax of 30.2@xmath872mas @xcite to obtain a mass of 0.48@xmath870.06@xmath3 for the companion .",
    "this value is consistent with the one derived above using isochrones , at the level of the uncertainties .",
    "although the binary orbit is not taken into account in computing the hipparcos parallax , the period is several times longer than the length of the hipparcos mission and the system was near apastron at the time of observations , so we do not expect the orbital photocenter motion to have a significant effect on the measured parallax .",
    "as the parallax uncertainty dominates our mass uncertainty , we have repeated the orbital calculation at several fixed parallax values as given in table  [ table : systemparameters_hd60934_b ] . according to the nextgen models of , plausible ages for the companion range from @xmath050myr through to the zero - age main sequence .",
    "therefore , the dynamical mass does not allow us to place a strong constraint on the system age , but the lower range of allowed values is compatible with the age of ab dor .",
    "we list our detection limits in table  [ table : detlims ] , corresponding to the 99.9% threshold values for each of the separation annuli , as defined in section  [ sec : binaryfitting ] .",
    "these were translated into upper limits for companion masses by first converting the contrast ratios into absolute companion magnitudes using the distances listed in table  [ table : sample ] . then combining these intrinsic luminosities with the assumed ages listed in table [ table : mg ] , we determined the corresponding companion mass by interpolating an appropriate set of isochrones : specifically , the dusty isochrones @xcite for objects with @xmath89 and the nextgen isochrones for objects with @xmath90 . for the four targets with detected companions ( hip14807 , hd16760 , hd113449 ,",
    "hd160934 ) we quote the limits obtained for the residual closure phases .",
    "it should be emphasized that the mass limits quoted in table  [ table : detlims ] inherit the systematic errors of the models used to compute them .",
    "for instance , @xcite have shown that the predicted luminosities are highly dependent on the treatment of initial conditions , with `` cold start '' models generating luminosities that can be orders of magnitudes fainter than those obtained by the `` hot start '' dusty models over gyr time scales .",
    "however , objects in the mass range that our survey is sensitive to would most likely have formed by the gravitational collapse of instabilities in the stellar disk , a process that is more akin to the hot start scenario .",
    "indeed , recent observational evidence appears to favor the hot start models down to masses of @xmath010@xmath6  ( eg . * ? ? ? * ) or even suggest that they could even overpredict the luminosity of such objects @xcite . in the latter case",
    ", the values quoted in table  [ table : detlims ] would be conservative estimates .    with these considerations in mind ,",
    "figure  [ fig : detlims ] shows the detection limits plotted in terms of equivalent companion mass as a function of angular separation .",

    "the top panel shows the detection limits for our older ab dor ( @xmath0110myr ) and her - lyr ( @xmath0200myr ) targets , the middle panel shows the detection limits for our younger @xmath1  pic ( @xmath012myr ) and tuc - hor ( @xmath030myr ) targets , and the bottom panel shows the detection limits for the twa ( @xmath08myr ) targets .",
    "the twa targets have been plotted on their own because all but three of them were observed during the same observing run at vlt using the l@xmath91 filter with a 7-hole mask .",
    "we have used our detection limits listed in table  [ table : detlims ] to constrain the frequency of @xmath02080@xmath6 companions in @xmath0330au orbits around 0.21.5@xmath3  stars . to do this , we employed the same methodology as @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and .",
    "we present a brief outline of the approach here , but the reader may consult those works for further details .",
    "firstly , if we denote the outcome of our survey of @xmath92 stars as the set @xmath93 , where @xmath94 is equal to zero if no companion was detected around the @xmath19th star or equal to one if a companion was detected , then the likelihood that the fraction of stars with companions is equal to @xmath95 is given by : @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the likelihood of our data and @xmath98 is the prior probability that the underlying companion frequency is equal to @xmath95 .",
    "we adopt an ignorant prior of @xmath99 .",
    "the fact that we did not detect any 2080@xmath6 companions allows us to place an upper limit  @xmath100 on their frequency by integrating equation  [ eq : bayestheorem ] , such that : @xmath101 where @xmath102 is a fraction giving the confidence of our limit ( eg .  @xmath103 corresponds to a confidence of 95% ) .    using poisson statistics",
    ", it can be shown that a null result implies : @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the probability that a substellar companion would have been detected around the @xmath19th star if there had been one present .",
    "the next task is to determine values for each of the @xmath105 terms , and we did this using a monte carlo  ( mc ) approach . for each target star in our sample",
    ", we generated 10000 hypothetical companions , each with a mass  @xmath106 and angular separation  @xmath34 .",
    "the companion masses were either obtained by randomly sampling from an appropriate distribution ( see section  [ sec : mdist ] below ) or else they were set to a fixed value ( see section  [ sec : distindependent ] below ) . to obtain the angular separations , we had to properly take into account the companion orbital eccentricities , phases , and orientations .",
    "we did this using the approach described by @xcite in their appendices 1 and 2 .",
    "as with the companion masses , this required either randomly sampling these properties from appropriate distributions ( see sections  [ sec : edist ] and  [ sec : adist ] below ) or else setting them to fixed values ( see section  [ sec : distindependent ] below ) .    having generated 10000 hypothetical companions with masses and angular separations for each of the targets in our sample , we then consulted the detection limits in table  [ table : detlims ] .",
    "companions with masses that fell above the minimum detectable mass in the corresponding separation annulus for their target star were counted as detections . the @xmath105 value for each target was thus given by the number  @xmath107 of such detections divided by the total number of hypothetical companions generated , i.e.  @xmath108 . equipped with the @xmath105 values , we were then able to calculate an estimate for the companion frequency upper limit  @xmath100 at some level of confidence @xmath102 by integrating equation  [ eq : ci2 ] .",
    "the distribution of substellar companion masses in the separation range @xmath0330au is not yet constrained by observations . to accomodate this uncertainty ,",
    "we have repeated our mc analysis separately for three different assumed forms for the mass distribution .",
    "for the first of these , we extrapolated to 2080@xmath6 the power law distribution that has been uncovered by the keck radial velocity survey for companions with masses @xmath109@xmath6  and periods @xmath62@xmath1102000 days @xcite , given by : @xmath111 where @xmath112 is the number of objects with masses in the interval @xmath113 $ ] .",
    "the second distribution that we used was the universal mass function proposed by @xcite for companions to solar mass stars , suggested by those authors for companion masses between 0.01@xmath3 and 1.0@xmath3 and semimajor axes between 0au and 1590au .",
    "it is given by : @xmath114 where @xmath115 is the secondary - to - primary mass ratio .",
    "the last distribution that we used was a log - normal paramaterization proposed by @xcite , derived using an ad hoc physical model of binary formation .",
    "it is given by : @xmath116 } \\label{eq : qlognormal}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and we used the authors proposed value of @xmath117 .",
    "as with masses , the distribution of substellar companion orbital eccentricities in the semimajor axis range @xmath0330au is not yet constrained by observations .",
    "we chose to draw companion eccentricities from a distribution of the form : @xmath118 which , as noted in appendix 2 of @xcite , is an approximation that has been derived from physical considerations .",
    "however , to test how sensitive our results were to the distribution of companion eccentricities , we repeated all of our mc analyses for two limiting cases : ( 1 )  fixing the orbital eccentricity of all hypothetical companions to @xmath119 ; ( 2 )  fixing all hypothetical companion eccentricities to @xmath120 .",
    "we drew substellar companion semimajor axes from an inverse power law of the form : @xmath121 over the separation range 330au .",
    "this distribution was also used by @xcite for @xmath122au ( see their appendix 2 for a discussion ) and it is consistent with recent results for stellar binaries between @xmath123@xmath124au ( eg . * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , in the event that @xmath4510@xmath6 objects can form by the same mechanism as lower - mass gas giant planets , equation  [ eq : adist ] is a reasonable extrapolation from the results of @xcite , who found a nearly - log - flat distribution for @xmath11010@xmath6 gas giant planets at separations @xmath125au .",
    "in addition to assuming specific forms for the distribution of companion properties , we repeated the analysis with them set to fixed values . this allowed us to obtain conservative upper limit estimates for the companion frequencies .",
    "for instance , the less massive a companion is , the more difficult it is to detect because it is fainter and hence the required contrasts are higher .",
    "therefore , by setting all of our hypothetical substellar companions to have some mass @xmath126 , the subsequent result we obtain from the mc analysis is an upper limit on the frequency of all companions with masses @xmath127 .",
    "similarly , our ability to detect companions varied with angular separation ( figure  [ fig : detlims ] ) , which is related to the semimajor axis of the companion via the distance to the system and the orientation of the orbit .",
    "now suppose we fix the semimajor axes of the hypothetical companions to a certain value  @xmath128 and repeat the mc analysis for values over some interval @xmath128@xmath129@xmath130 $ ] .",
    "then the maximum value of @xmath100 obtained from these analyses is the most conservative upper limit estimate for the frequency of companions with semimajor axes on that interval .",
    "we present the results of these distribution - independent calculations in section  [ sec : mcresults ] , as well as the results obtained by assuming the specific distribution forms described in sections  [ sec : mdist][sec : adist ] .",
    "ideally , when performing the calculations described above , we would like to combine the results of our aperture masking survey with those of other imaging surveys targeting wider angular scales .",
    "this would allow us to put tighter constraints on the companion frequencies across a larger range of separations .",
    "to this end , we identified 49 of our targets that have previously been observed as part of published direct imaging surveys and list these in table  [ table : imassumpt ] .",
    "for each of these targets , we quote the inner separation angle that was probed by the imaging observations as well as the corresponding sensitivity of the observations . in most cases",
    ", these values were taken directly from the published survey limits , but when these were not provided explicitly we attempted to make conservative estimates .",
    "we also list each of the sensitivities in table  [ table : imassumpt ] as an equivalent minimum detectable companion mass , calculated by interpolating the dusty isochrones of @xcite in the same manner outlined in section  [ sec : generallimits ] .",
    "we incorporated these limits into our analysis described in section  [ sec : mc ] by treating hypothetical companions as `` detected '' ( i.e.  by increasing @xmath107 by 1 ) whenever they came within the detectability range of the previous imaging observations ( i.e.  if they had separation and masses above the values quoted in table  [ table : imassumpt ] ) . in the next sections , we present the results obtained from this combined approach ( aperture masking + previous imaging ) together with the results obtained using the aperture masking limits alone .",
    "the @xmath105 values calculated separately for each of the three companion mass distributions that we considered ( equations  [ eq : mpowerlaw ] , [ eq : qpowerlaw ] , and [ eq : qlognormal ] ) are plotted in ascending order in figure  [ fig : pjvals ] for the case of a companion orbital eccentricity distribution given by @xmath131 ( equation  [ eq : edist ] ) and semimajor axis distribution given by @xmath132 ( equation  [ eq : adist ] ) . in this figure",
    ", we immediately see the advantage of combining our aperture masking results with the results from imaging surveys : the overall effect is roughly equivalent to an upwards shift of the @xmath105 values by @xmath01030% for the majority of targets .        in table",
    "[ table : mcresults ] , we present 95% confidence ( i.e.  @xmath103 in equation  [ eq : ci2 ] ) upper limit estimates @xmath100 for the frequency of 2080@xmath6 substellar companions in the separation range 330au , with companion semimajor axes randomly drawn from the inverse power law distribution @xmath132 ( equation  [ eq : adist ] ) . also presented are calculations made separately for each permutation of the companion mass and eccentricity distributions described in sections  [ sec : mdist ] and  [ sec : edist ] , respectively , as well as for different fixed companion masses of 20@xmath6 , 40@xmath6 , and 60@xmath6 ( see section  [ sec : distindependent ] ) .",
    "all calculations reported in table  [ table : mcresults ] are reasonably robust to the different assumptions made for the companion eccentricities , with the calculated upper limits only differing by @xmath3212% depending on whether all companion eccentricities are fixed to @xmath120 or @xmath119 , or if they are drawn randomly from a distribution of the form @xmath131 ( equation  [ eq : edist ] ) .",

    "to investigate how sensitive our results are to the uncertainties in the distances and ages of our targets , we repeated the above calculations using the @xmath133 upper limits for the ages and distances of each target provided in tables  [ table : mg ] and [ table : sample ] .",
    "for instance , instead of using a distance of 28pc and an age of 110myr for pw  and , we used @xmath134pc and @xmath135myr , respectively . assuming upper values for the ages and distances in this way results in a downward revision of our sensitivities to faint companions at smaller separations .",

    "these results are broadly in line with expectations from current models of substellar companion formation .",
    "firstly , population synthesis models predict that core accretion only produces companions with masses up to @xmath010@xmath6  @xcite , or else , if objects are formed with masses above 20@xmath6 , then these are extremely rare .",
    "unsurprisingly , the observational studies outlined above provide no evidence to the contrary , despite the aperture masking surveys in particular probing the range of separations where core accretion is expected to be most efficient .    indeed , 2080@xmath6  companions are much more likely to form by either gravoturbulent fragmentation during the initial collapse of the molecular cloud ( eg . * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or by the fragmentation of gravitational instabilities in the protostellar disk once the initial free - fall collapse of the molecular cloud has ended ( eg . * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for the gravoturbulent fragmentation scenario , the low frequencies of substellar companions deduced for separations @xmath32200au from observational studies is in qualitative agreement with the hydrodynamical simulations of @xcite who found that the separation of binary pairs consisting of a stellar primary and a very low - mass secondary increases strongly with decreasing mass ratio .",
    "meanwhile , the disk fragmentation mechanism is not expected to occur within @xmath04070au of the primary , where radiative cooling time scales are too long for the disk to be toomre unstable ( eg .",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "alternatively , 2080@xmath6  objects might form by gravitational disk instabilities at separations beyond @xmath04070au and then migrate inwards .",
    "@xcite considered this for the case of a massive disk extending between 40400au around a 0.7@xmath3  star .",
    "however , they found that when low mass ( @xmath11080@xmath6 ) companions did form at closer separations , they were subsequently scattered outwards by dynamical interactions with more massive companions in the same disk , leading to a brown dwarf desert that extended out to @xmath0100200au .",
    "again , the low occurence of 2080@xmath6  companions inferred from observational studies over this separation range is consistent with such a scenario , though the constraints are not yet tight enough to make a definitive statement .",
    "this paper has presented the results of an aperture masking survey of 67  young nearby stars for substellar companions .",
    "our detection limits extend down to @xmath040@xmath6  for 30 of our targets , and of these , we are sensitive down to @xmath020@xmath6  or less for a subset of 22 . although we did not uncover any substellar companions , we detected four stellar companions .",
    "one of these , a @xmath4@xmath3  companion to hip14807 , is a new discovery .",
    "we have also shown that the companion to hd16760 is on a low inclination orbit with a mass of @xmath140@xmath3 , much higher than the minimum mass of @xmath1411314@xmath6  inferred from radial velocity measurements .",
    "if we do not make any assumptions about the distribution of companion masses or semimajor axes , we calculate that the frequency of 2080@xmath6  companions is less than @xmath019% in the range 310au and less than @xmath012% in the range 1030au at 95% confidence . if , however , we assume that the semimajor axes of 2080@xmath6  companions are distributed according to @xmath8 and that their masses are distributed according to a log - normal parameterization of the secondary - to - primary mass ratio , this limit becomes @xmath09% over the 330au separation range",
    ". similar values of @xmath010% and @xmath011% are obtained if we assume instead that the companion masses or secondary - to - primary mass ratios , respectively , are distributed according to power laws .",
