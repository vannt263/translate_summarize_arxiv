    "propagation of optical pulses in fibers with non - uniform dispersion remains to be a field of intensive research .",
    "the relevant studies are motivated by their application to modern optical communication systems .",
    "random fluctuations of the dispersion coefficient is inherent to existing optical fibers , which deteriorates the performance of communication lines based on both standard and dispersion - managed solitons @xcite .",
    "therefore , the proper compensation of the pulse distortion caused by random fluctuations of the fiber dispersion is of vital importance , especially for long haul optical communication systems .",
    "the previous investigations were concerned with the analysis of the modulational instability ( mi ) of electromagnetic waves in fibers with random dispersion .",
    "it was shown that the randomness can reduce the mi gain for anomalous dispersion region and generate the instability for the whole spectrum of modulations in the normal dispersion region @xcite . recently",
    "the performance of dispersion - managed soliton system with random variations of span length and span path - average dispersions has been studied numerically in ref .",
    "the comprehensive analysis of the dynamics of solitons implies the solution of the nonlinear schrdinger equation ( nlse ) with randomly varying coefficients , which is a rather complex problem .",
    "however , in the particular case , when a uniform fiber dispersion is superimposed by weak random modulations , the perturbation theory based on the inverse scattering transform ( ist ) can be applied . in the framework of this approach",
    "the decay law for optical solitons was derived which describes their radiative damping due to emission of linear waves @xcite .",
    "the case of dispersion - managed ( dm ) solitons is more complicated because here one has the superposition of the random fluctuations and strong periodic modulations of the dispersion . in recent works @xcite the variational approach was employed to analyze the dynamics of optical pulses in systems with random dispersion - management .",
    "it was shown that the dm soliton is subject to disintegration due to random variations of the dispersion map parameters .",
    "the averaged equation in the frequency domain was derived in @xcite , where an interesting idea of pinning ( compensation of the accumulated effect of fluctuations ) is proposed .",
    "numerical simulations of the dynamics of dm solitons in systems with random dispersion - management are presented in @xcite .",
    "analytical description of the dm soliton dynamics in fluctuating media remains to be an open problem , since the radiative effects can not be taken into account in the frame of the variational approach . however , there exists a limit pertaining to strong dispersion - management , where the nlse with periodic coefficients is nearly integrable @xcite .",
    "the development of the stochastic perturbation theory similar to the ist approach may be successful in this limit .",
    "this problem deserves a separate consideration .    in this study",
    "we apply the mean field method ( mfm ) for the analysis of propagation of optical pulses in fibers with random dispersion , including the dm case .",
    "the advantage of this method consists in that , it does nt depend on the fact whether the basic deterministic equation is integrable or not .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we derive the mean field equation for the case of uniform dispersion perturbed by random modulations and compare the predictions of this approach with the corresponding result of the ist based perturbation theory .",
    "the condition for the existence of autosoliton in random media is derived .",
    "the section iii is devoted to analysis of the dm soliton dynamics in the framework of mfm .",
    "we show that the variational approach applied to the mean field equation with a frequency dependent damping leads to a system of ode s for dm soliton parameters . and in the last section iv , we briefly summarize the main results of this study .",
    "the propagation of optical pulses in a fiber with uniform dispersion superimposed by random modulations was considered in the framework of the perturbation theory based on the ist @xcite . assuming the perturbation to be of the form @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a weak random process , the radiative decay of a soliton was calculated .",
    "the decay law for the pulse amplitude was derived from the energy conservation and the dynamic balance between the radiative component and localized mode .",
    "it was shown that the amplitude of the soliton decays with the propagation distance as @xmath2 for @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the noise level .",
    "in addition , the decay rate was revealed to be highly dependent on the pulse duration @xmath5 , i.e. the influence of the randomness is superior on short pulses , particularly in the femtosecond range .",
    "the extension of this approach for more general cases ( e.g. dispersion - managed solitons ) is in general not possible .",
    "therefore , it is of interest to apply another approach which is independent on the fact whether the underlying deterministic equation is integrable or not .",
    "one of such possibilities is provided by the mean field method @xcite . despite the",
    "well known troubles of this approach for random nonlinear wave equations @xcite , one can obtain reasonably well description in the case of weak fluctuations , and/or small distances of propagation .    in this section",
    "we apply the mfm and the perturbation theory based on the ist to the problem of optical pulse propagation in fibers with random dispersion . by comparing the predictions of these two approaches",
    "we reveal the limits of validity of the mfm .",
    "optical pulse propagation in fibers is well described by the nlse @xmath6 here @xmath7 are the coefficients of linear and nonlinear amplification ( damping ) respectively . in our model these terms are supposed to compensate the damping originated from the randomness of the fiber dispersion .",
    "below we consider the case , when the dispersion coefficient @xmath8 is the sum of the constant and random parts , i.e. @xmath9 with @xmath10 the noise is assumed to be small compared to the constant part of the dispersion .    to derive the equation averaged over fluctuations we apply the mean field method , representing the field as consisting of the mean value and small fluctuating part @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is a slowly varying mean field . according to this method",
    "we can use the decoupling @xmath13 .",
    "this corresponds to neglecting by fluctuations of the nonlinearity , and the approximation is valid for propagation distances @xmath14 . in typical optical experiments",
    "this requirement is satisfied . in general",
    "the decoupling procedure is inaccurate since the scattered field @xmath15 grows with propagation distance and becomes comparable with @xmath12 , that violates the assumption @xmath16 . in order to decompose the mean @xmath17 we use",
    "the furutsu - novikov formula @xmath18 of particular interest is the case of white noise fluctuations , when @xmath19 .",
    "also the causality principle will be useful @xmath20 then integrating eq.([main ] ) over @xmath21 from @xmath22 to @xmath23 and taking variational derivative ( with the causality principle in mind ) we obtain @xmath24 in the result we get the equation for averaged pulse profile with a fourth order dissipative term ( for simplicity we dropped averaging symbol in @xmath25 ) @xmath26 where @xmath27 being the noise strength .",
    "as it is apparent from this equation , the effect of random dispersion on the pulse evolution is described as the pulse propagation in a uniform medium with _ the frequency depending dissipation_. formally this equation coincides with the complex swift - hohenberg equation .",
    "thus we can expect the existence of _ dissipative solitons _ in nonlinear media with fluctuating dispersion .",
    "at first we examine the decay rate of a pulse under the action of the 4th order dispersion coefficient in eq.([u4 t ] ) . for the weak noise case",
    "this term is small and we can apply the perturbation theory . the single soliton propagation is conveniently described using the equations for the energy @xmath28 and momentum @xmath29 .",

    "( [ dndz]),([dpdz ] ) we obtain the system of equations for the soliton amplitude and velocity @xmath33 , \\label{ampl } \\\\    \\frac{d\\omega}{dz}&=&-\\frac{8}{3}\\gamma\\omega\\eta^2    ( \\frac{7}{5}\\eta^2+\\omega^2 ) .",
    "\\label{vel}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] parameters @xmath34 are absent in the second equation , since the soliton velocity is not affected by such type of perturbations . for @xmath35",
    "one can find the decay law of the soliton due to the 4th order dispersive dissipation , which follows from eq.([ampl ] ) @xmath36 now we can compare the prediction of the mfm with that of the perturbation theory based on the ist @xcite and thus find the limits of applicability of the mfm ( within the limits of the error of the ist method ) . in the frame of ist",
    "based perturbation approach , the decrease of the soliton amplitude due to radiation of random waves under fluctuations of dispersion can be estimated from the balance equation for the norm @xmath37 , which is the integral of motion .",
    "the norm can be represented as @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the spectral parameter , @xmath40 is the wavenumber , @xmath41 are the jost coefficients of the zakharov - shabat linear spectral problem and @xmath42 . for the weak noise case @xmath43 .",
    "the balance equation can be obtained by differentiation of the norm with respect to @xmath23 @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the spectral power of emitted radiation by the soliton .",
    "the jost coefficient @xmath46 can be calculated using the perturbation theory based on the ist @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the total wave is given by @xmath47 where @xmath48 here @xmath49 is the soliton part of the total wave .",
    "the first component of @xmath50 represents the emitted wavepacket .",
    "the second component is due to interaction between the soliton and the emitted wavepacket and it is appreciable only nearby the soliton",
    ". we will be interested in the decay of a soliton under emission far from the soliton , assuming that this emission is lost and has no back action on the soliton .",
    "the equation for the amplitude is @xmath51 the solution reduces to the algebraic equation @xmath52 since @xmath53 we can replace @xmath54 .    for distances of propagation @xmath55 one can neglect the second term in the denominator of eq.([eq ] ) and find the decay law for the amplitude @xmath56 this equation gives almost the same decay rate as eq.([mf ] ) ( see @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the ist approach conforms with the picture of soliton propagation in uniform media with the effective frequency dependent ( @xmath57 ) losses .",
    "also the ist and mfm predict the strong @xmath58 dependence of the decay rate on the pulse duration .",
    "the comparison shows that the mean field theory underestimates the soliton decay rate relative to the ist as given by the ratio @xmath59 .",
    "this discrepancy between numerical constants in eq.([mf ] ) and eq.([eq2 ] ) is due to the approximate character of the mean field equation , where we have neglected by the renormalization of the nonlinear term .    in fig.[fig1 ]",
    "we report the comparison of predictions of different models regarding the decay law of the pulse ( decreasing of its amplitude ) in the course of propagation along a fiber line with randomly varying dispersion .",
    "it is seen that all the models well describe the initial stage of the radiative damping .",
    "the mf nls eq.([u4 t ] ) and decay law eq.([mf ] ) better describe the damping at distances @xmath60 , compared to the algebraic eq.([eq1 ] ) .",
    "the curve labeled stochastic nls is obtained by the averaging over 70 realizations .     with @xmath61 .",

    "one can see that @xmath65 .",
    "this is due to the fact that the numbers of quanta emitted by the soliton in forward and backward directions are equal .",
    "therefore the predictions of the mfm and ist for @xmath66 coincide only at the fixed point , where @xmath35 .",
    "the ratio of amplitudes at the fixed point is @xmath67 for the case of linear amplification , and @xmath68 for nonlinear amplification .",
    "the decay of a soliton can be compensated by linear and/or nonlinear amplifications .",
    "this results in formation of an autosoliton . in our case ,",
    "when the pulse power loss due to 4th order dispersion effect @xmath69 is compensated by the linear @xmath70 and/or nonlinear @xmath71 amplification in eq.([main ] ) , such an autosoliton can be created .",
    "a distinctive property of these solitons is that , they recover the stable waveform when deformed .",
    "fig.[fig2 ] demonstrates such an aspect of autosolitons , when the power dissipation due to 4th order dispersion term is compensated by linear / nonlinear amplification .",

    "the effect of nonlinearity is small in the scale of a unit cell , while accumulated on longer distances , can lead to formation of a breathing dm soliton .",
