    "the successful simulation of binary black holes with spin @xcite has presented two intriguing surprises : if the spin lies in the orbital plane , an up - and - down `` bobbing '' of the entire orbital plane is seen to occur in phase with the orbit , and when the black holes merge , the final black hole can acquire a `` kick '' velocity exceeding those occurring in the non - spinning case by an order of magnitude . in the kick - maximizing case of circular orbit with antiparallel spins lying in the orbital plane , the direction ( up or down ) and speed of the kick depend on the orbital phase at merger .",
    "two natural questions are : what causes the bobbing motion ? can the kick be viewed as a post - merger continuation of the bobbing ?    in this paper we shall address these questions by studying simple _ analogous systems _ : analytical toy models of the spinning black hole binary system that display some of its salient features .",
    "we first consider two spinning bodies connected by an elastic band in flat spacetime , a system we refer to as `` tetherballs . ''",
    "we find that this system displays bobbing motion very similar to that observed in numerical simulations of binary black holes .",
    "the bobbing is identified as arising from a purely `` kinematical '' spin effect that gives rise to bobbing independently of the details of the particular type of force holding the two bodies in orbit .",
    "this effect is analogous to the thomas precession , which gives rise to a precession independently of the details of the particular type of force accelerating a spinning body .",
    "the analog system of primary interest to us is an _",
    "electromagnetic binary _ , consisting of two charged magnetic dipoles with spin in flat spacetime . here we find that , in addition to the `` kinematical bobbing '' associated with their spin , the individual bodies also undergo `` dynamical bobbing '' associated with their magnetic dipole moment .",
    "however , at the level of approximation corresponding to 1.5 post - newtonian  which we refer to as `` 1.5 post coulombic''we shall show that the mass - weighted dynamical bobbing of the two bodies is equal and opposite , so that the _ net _ bobbing ( i.e. , the sum of the mass times the bobbing velocity for the two bodies ) is purely kinematical , just as in the case of tetherballs . nevertheless , we will also see that a considerable amount of momentum is exchanged between the bodies and the electromagnetic field during each orbit .",
    "this momentum exchange does not contribute to the net bobbing because the net momentum acquired by the bodies from the electromagnetic field goes into the `` hidden mechanical momentum '' @xcite of the bodies .",
    "if an electromagnetic analog of a merger event were to occur , a net kick could be experienced by the system only if momentum is carried away to infinity by the electromagnetic field .",
    "we can not analyze the momentum radiated to infinity  momentum can not be radiated to infinity at the 1.5 post - coulombic approximation  but , in a more exact treatment , we would expect the radiated momentum to be related to the total momentum stored in the electromagnetic field at or near merger .",
    "however , the momentum stored in the electromagnetic field is entirely unrelated to the net bobbing of the bodies .",
    "in particular , the momentum stored in the electromagnetic field depends upon the magnetic dipole moment of the bodies but not their spin , whereas the net bobbing depends upon their spin but not their magnetic dipole moment .",
    "thus , in the electromagnetic case , we believe that the bobbing phenomenon is entirely unrelated to possible kicks .    in this paper , we will derive precise rules for relating the equations of motion of charged bodies in a stationary external electromagnetic field in flat spacetime with the motion of bodies in a weakly curved stationary spacetime .",
    "these rules will enable us to directly translate our electromagnetic results on bobbing motion into results for the corresponding gravitational case ",
    "a binary system of spinning masses  at the 1.5 post - newtonian approximation .",
    "this gravitational binary system has been directly analyzed in the 1.5 post - newtonian approximation in @xcite , and our results on bobbing in the gravitational case agree with theirs .",
    "however , it is much more difficult to unambiguously interpret the results in the gravitational case as compared with the electromagnetic case for the following three reasons : ( i ) in the gravitational case , the kinematical bobbing terms take the exactly same mathematical form as the dynamical bobbing terms , so it is much less clear how to make a clean distinction between effects of a kinematical origin and effects of a dynamical origin .",
    "( ii ) the description of the motion of bodies in the gravitational case is gauge dependent , as are the `` gravitational field strengths . ''",
    "( iii ) in general relativity , only the total momentum of the entire system is well defined .",
    "any allocation of a portion of the momentum of the system to the gravitational field and a portion to the bodies requires both a choice of pseudotensor ( such as the landau - lifshitz pseudotensor used in @xcite ) and a choice of gauge , and it is unclear the extent to which this allocation may depend on these choices .",
    "nevertheless , the very close analogy established in this paper between the electromagnetic and gravitational cases leads us to believe that our interpretation of the nature of bobbing and kicks in the electromagnetic case should extend to the gravitational case .",
    "we therefore propose the following answers to the questions posed in the first paragraph above : the bobbing seen in simulations of black hole mergers is a purely kinematical spin effect that is in no way special to the gravitational interaction .",
    "the kick has an entirely different cause , and should not be viewed as a post - merger continuation of the bobbing phenomena , these distinct terms in electromagnetism translate into terms of exactly the same functional form in gravity .",
    "therefore , it should not be surprising if in the gravitational case , the magnitude of the kick velocity and its dependence on the phase of the orbit are very similar to those of the net bobbing velocity . ] .",
    "the nature of the effects we wish to analyze in this paper require us to be very careful and precise in our definitions of quantities such as the linear momentum , spin , and center of mass position of a body , which will require us to develop a substantial amount of machinery in the next section .",
    "it may therefore be worthwhile to give here a simple explanation of the nature and origin of the kinematical bobbing effect in flat spacetime .",
    "consider a body described by stress - energy tensor @xmath0 in global inertial coordinates @xmath1 that is acted upon by an external @xmath2-force density @xmath3 , so that @xmath0 satisfies @xmath4 integrating this equation , we obtain @xmath5 multiplying the @xmath6 component of eq . by @xmath7 , integrating over space , integrating by parts , and using , we obtain @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the total energy of the body as measured in the lab frame , and we have defined the `` lab frame centroid '' @xmath10 differentiating with respect to time and using eq .",
    "again , we obtain @xmath11    we now restrict consideration to non - relativistic motion and drop terms of order @xmath12 .",
    "we may then replace @xmath13 by the rest mass , where @xmath14 is the @xmath2-momentum of the body , defined ( in the absence of an electromagnetic field ) by an integral of @xmath15 over a spacelike slice .",
    "however , even in minkowski spacetime , if an external force acts on a body , then @xmath14 will be slice dependent .",
    "in particular , @xmath14 and @xmath16 depend on the choice of frame and we must distinguish between , e.g. , the rest mass @xmath17 as determined in the lab frame and the rest mass @xmath18 as determined in the center of mass frame",
    ". these differences will be negligible for the present calculation , and we will ignore them .",
    "similar remarks apply to spin .",
    "we will treat these issues with great care in section [ sect : mechanics ] .",
    "] , @xmath16 , of the body .",
    "if the integrated @xmath2-force density is nearly orthogonal to the @xmath2-velocity of the lab frame centroid ( as must occur if the rest mass of the body is approximately constant ) , then the last term on the right side of will be of order @xmath19 and may be dropped .",
    "furthermore , if the external force is nearly centered about the lab frame centroid , the second term on the right side of also will be negligible . dropping this term as well",
    ", we obtain @xmath20 which can be recognized as a version of @xmath21 . however , the `` @xmath22 '' that appears in this equation is the acceleration of the lab frame centroid .",
    "the lab frame centroid @xmath23 measures the `` center of energy '' of a body as determined by a lab frame observer .",
    "however , for a spinning , moving body , this center of energy will be skewed towards the side of the ( rotating ) body that moves with the body s bulk motion , on account of the extra lab frame kinetic energy present there . as obtained in equation below , the true center of mass @xmath24",
    "is related to the lab frame centroid @xmath23 approximately by and does not agree with the notion of center of mass used in the present paper . ]",
    "@xmath25 if @xmath26 lies in a plane at all times , and if @xmath27 initially lies in this plane , then by the lab frame centroid is confined to the plane . however ,",
    "if the spin of the body has a component in the plane , then by the center of mass will be displaced out of the plane .",
    "this accounts for the `` kinematical bobbing '' ( see figure [ fig : kbobbing ] ) .",
    "-@xmath28 plane .",
    "however , since the body has a ( constant ) spin vector lying in the plane , its center of mass ( solid dot ) is displaced in the @xmath29 direction by a velocity dependent factor ( equation ) , giving rise to bobbing",
    ". the body is shown at two phases in its orbit . in the foreground",
    ", the bottom portion of the body contains extra lab frame kinetic energy ( illustrated with shading ) , skewing the lab frame centroid downwards so that the center of mass must have bobbed up .",

    "sect : mechanics ] we present a general formalism for describing the motion of extended test bodies in curved spacetime .",
    "we explicitly include the possibility of an external electromagnetic field , and allow for the possibility of additional external forces .",
    "the first subsection defines linear and angular momenta of a body .",
    "the second subsection deals with the association of a center of mass worldline to a body .",
    "the third subsection deals with the evaluation of electromagnetic and gravitational forces and torques up to quadrupole order .",
    "section [ sect : mechanics ] is almost entirely review , although some aspects of the presentation are new and there is some new material on , e.g. , the relationship between the true center of mass and the `` lab frame '' and `` hybrid '' centroids .",
    "in section [ sect : simplebobbing ] we apply this formalism to derive bobbing effects in simple example systems .",
    "first we consider the case of tetherballs and derive the kinematical bobbing effect discussed above .",
    "we then consider the example of a magnetic dipole orbiting a line electric charge in flat spacetime , and a spinning body orbiting a line mass in general relativity . in these cases",
    "the kinematical bobbing is supplemented by dynamical bobbing .",
    "in section [ sect : analogy ] we give a careful treatment of the analogy between the equations of motion of a body moving in the electromagnetic field of a stationary source in flat spacetime and the motion of a body in a weakly curved , stationary spacetime in general relativity .",
    "we extend the results of @xcite to include quadrupole terms and terms quadratic in the velocity of the body .",
    "we provide precise rules for translating the electromagnetic evolution equations for center of mass motion and spin into the corresponding gravitational equations at this order of approximation .",
    "finally , in section [ sect : generalem ] we consider the electromagnetic analog of a black hole binary , consisting of two orbiting charged magnetic dipoles with spin .",
    "we assume that each body moves in the electromagnetic field of the other according to the laws of test body motion derived in section [ sect : mechanics ] .",
    "( these laws were also obtained in @xcite , where self - force effects were considered in addition . )",
    "we obtain the spin and magnetic dipole terms appearing in the equations of motion at `` 1.5 post - coulombic '' order ( corresponding to 1.5 post - newtonian order in the gravitational case ) . using the translation rules developed in section [ sect : analogy ] we also obtain the corresponding results for gravity , which agree with @xcite .",
    "we analyze the flow of momentum between the bodies and the electromagnetic field , and discuss what can be learned from this analysis about kicks .",
    "our notation and conventions on indices are as follows .",
    "latin indices from early in the alphabet ( @xmath30 ) are used to denote abstract tensor indices .",
    "greek indices are used to denote components of these tensors ( most commonly in global inertial coordinates in minkowski spacetime ) .",
    "latin indices from the middle of the alphabet ( @xmath31 ) denote spatial components , and a `` @xmath32 '' will be used for time components .",
    "sign conventions are those of @xcite .",
    "consider a body with stress - energy tensor @xmath33 and electromagnetic charge - current density @xmath34 moving in a curved spacetime @xmath35 . both @xmath36 and @xmath34 are assumed to have support within a spatially - compact worldtube @xmath37 .",
    "we also allow for an electromagnetic field @xmath38 , which is assumed to satisfy maxwell s equations    [ maxwell ] @xmath39 } = 0    \\\\",
    "\\nabla^b f_{ab } = 4 \\pi j_a\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in a neighborhood of @xmath37 .",
    "it follows from this that the current density is conserved : @xmath40 .    the total stress - energy tensor @xmath41 of the system is also assumed to be conserved .",
    "( this would follow from einstein s equation , but we do not impose einstein s equation in the present section . )",

    "except in sect .",
    "[ sect : tether ] below , this paper will mainly be concerned with the case @xmath47 .",

    "[ sect : momdef ] requires only that @xmath37 lie in a suitable normal neighborhood of the timelike worldline used in the construction of certain `` generalized killing fields . ''",

    "electromagnetic self - fields may be large , and , if einstein s equation is imposed , the body can contribute significantly to the spacetime curvature .",
    "some relatively minor additional restrictions are required in sect .",
    "[ sect : cm ] in order to ensure the existence of a unique center of mass worldline @xcite , but the constructions and results presented there also do not require that any self - fields be negligible .",

    "are changed only in that each instance of the external field is replaced by that external field plus the so - called `` regular '' detweiler - whiting component of the body s self - field @xcite .",
    "a short review of the full theory may be found in @xcite for the special case of self - interaction with a scalar field in a fixed curved spacetime .",

    "we now focus on bobbing by considering only the acceleration perpendicular to the `` instantaneous orbital plane '' spanned by @xmath471 and @xmath472 .",

[",
    "sect : tether ] , we now consider the mass - weighted average @xmath479 + @xmath480 of the bobbing accelerations , which provides a measure of the net oscillation of the system s orbital plane .",
    "this quantity is easily read off of equation by noting that @xmath472 and @xmath481 are odd under the exchange @xmath482 .",
    "this `` antisymmetrizes '' the kinematical contribution but in fact _ eliminates _ the dynamical contribution , so that the net bobbing is given by @xmath483.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus there is in fact _ no _ net dynamical bobbing in the electromagnetic binary : any dipole effect pushing one body upwards is always compensated by a corresponding dipole effect pushing the other body downwards .",
    "this cancellation is analogous to that found in section [ sect : cylsym ] ; the dynamical hidden momentum bobbing effect on one body is compensated by the lorentz force on the other body .",
    "although this cancelation is somewhat mysterious from the laws of motion point of view , in the next section its necessity will be seen at the level of conservation of momentum .",
    "recalling that @xmath484 , equation may be recast back into the canonical `` @xmath321 '' form of the kinematical bobbing effect ( present already in ) .",
    "this yields an expression for the net bobbing , @xmath485 \\cdot \\frac { \\hat{r } \\times \\vec{v } } { | \\hat{r } \\times \\vec{v } | }   \\bigg\\},\\label{eq : fnetbobbing2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is directly analogous to the net bobbing result obtained in eq .",
    "for the tetherballs system .      the corresponding results for a gravitational binary may be obtained as follows .",
    "as already remarked , in the instantaneous rest frame of ( say ) body @xmath315 , the fields are sufficiently stationary that the analysis of section [ sect : analogy ] for the motion of body @xmath486 is valid to 1.5pc and 1.5pn orders . as in the electromagnetic case , the terms in the acceleration of each body that are linear in velocity can depend only on the relative velocity of the bodies .",
    "therefore , the substitution rules of sect .",
    "[ compare ] should hold for equation restricted to terms linear in the velocity .",
    "however , no non - linearities in velocity occur proportional to spin or dipole , so we can use our substitution rules on the spin and dipole terms of and plug in the appropriate gravitoelectric and gravitomagnetic fields to obtain the analog of , @xmath487 \\nonumber \\\\   & - \\frac{m_{{\\rm b}}\\vec{s}_{{\\rm a}}}{r^3 | \\hat{r } \\times \\vec{v } | } \\cdot [ \\hat{r } ( v^2 -3(\\hat{r } \\cdot \\vec{v})^2 ) + 2\\vec{v}(\\hat{r } \\cdot \\vec{v } ) ] .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] although all terms are now proportional to spin , we would still say that the first line is dynamical in origin while the second line is kinematical in origin .",
    "the net bobbing again arises only from the kinematical terms , @xmath488.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this result agrees with the corresponding equation ( 5.19 ) obtained in @xcite using post - newtonian methods ( after dotting the latter equation with @xmath489 and fixing a typographical error involving a missing factor of @xmath490 ) . reintroducing the gravitoelectric field @xmath491 , equation may alternatively be written",
    "@xmath492 \\cdot \\frac { \\hat{r } \\times \\vec{v } } { | \\hat{r } \\times \\vec{v } | } \\bigg\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] equations , , and are of an essentially identical form and clearly demonstrate the identical ( purely kinematical ) nature the net bobbing displayed by slow - motion binaries interacting via elastic , electromagnetic , and gravitational forces . in each case , the net bobbing is controlled by the identical form of `` @xmath321 '' , where @xmath493 is the particular force holding the bodies in orbit .",
    "although the net bobbing occurring in our electromagnetic binary system is purely kinematical in nature , we now demonstrate that there is a considerable flow of momentum between the bodies and the electromagnetic field during each orbit .    in order to calculate the momentum contained in the electromagnetic field , we note that the stress - energy tensor @xmath494 of the electromagnetic field is quadratic in @xmath38 .",
    "it naturally breaks up into terms quadratic in the field of body @xmath314 , terms quadratic in the field of body @xmath315 , and cross terms linear in the fields of both bodies @xmath314 and @xmath315 . by the schwartz inequality , the self - field contributions to the electromagnetic stress - energy tensor can not be negligible compared with the cross terms ( which we shall denote by @xmath495 ) .",
    "unfortunately , however , inclusion of these self - field terms would take us beyond the test body approximation , and therefore outside the scope of the formalism developed in this paper .",
    "we will simply appeal to the work of @xcite and @xcite , which demonstrates that , at the order of approximation to which we work , stress - energy components quadratic in the field of body @xmath314 can naturally be viewed as `` self - energy '' terms that comprise part of the stress - energy of body @xmath314 .",
    "similarly , terms quadratic in the field of body @xmath496 can be viewed as comprising part of its stress - energy .",
    "`` renormalizing '' both objects stress - energy tensors in this way , the only self - field effect remaining in the laws of motion at this order is the abraham - lorentz - dirac self - force .",
    "this makes no contribution to bobbing or to momentum flow perpendicular to the orbital plane .",
    "all self - field effects will therefore be ignored here ( as they have been above ) .",
    "we therefore focus attention on the momentum , @xmath497 , carried by the cross - term portion , @xmath495 of the electromagnetic stress - energy tensor , @xmath498 in vector notation , we have @xmath499 to the accuracy required for the 1.5pc approximation ( which is @xmath459 for the momentum ) , we may replace @xmath500 by @xmath501 , where @xmath502 is the instantaneous coulomb potential of body @xmath314 . making a similar replacement for @xmath503 and",
    "integrating by parts , we obtain @xmath504 it is now useful to perform the expansion @xmath505 where @xmath506 denotes the instantaneous center of mass of body @xmath315 . plugging this expansion into the integral of ,",
    "using the definition of the magnetic dipole moment , and keeping only terms proportional to dipole , we obtain @xmath507 since only momentum proportional to dipole can point out of the orbital plane , this equation ( dotted into the normal ) gives the entire electromagnetic momentum perpendicular to the plane .",
    "we have thus found that the relevant electromagnetic field momentum is in fact equal and opposite to the sum of the `` @xmath333 '' portions of the hidden momenta associated with the two charges ( see equation ) .",
    "the reason for this remarkable - looking cancellation can be understood as follows .",
    "consider the case where both the 3-current @xmath508 of body @xmath314 and the charge density @xmath509 of body @xmath315 vanish , so , in particular , @xmath476 and @xmath510 vanish .",
    "there will be no force on either body if they are both stationary , so this system can exist in stationary equilibrium .",
    "nevertheless , despite the fact that the bodies and their electromagnetic fields are stationary , the above calculation shows that the cross term in the electromagnetic stress - energy tensor still carries a momentum @xmath511 however , the total stress - energy @xmath512 remains conserved , where @xmath513 is the stress - energy of the matter that makes up body @xmath314 and @xmath514 is the stress - energy of its electromagnetic self - field ( and likewise for @xmath315 ) .",
    "in particular , we have @xmath515 the first term vanishes by stationarity . multiplying by @xmath516 , integrating over space , and then integrating the resulting expression by parts , we obtain @xmath517",
    "note that neither the purely electric self - field of body @xmath314 nor the purely magnetic self - field of body @xmath315 can make a contribution to @xmath518 .",
    "consequently , can be made compatible with only by assigning a hidden mechanical momentum @xmath519 to body @xmath315 that is equal and opposite to the electromagnetic field momentum .",
    "indeed , this way of resolving the apparent conflict between and was used in @xcite to argue for the existence of hidden momentum in electromagnetic systems . note that in this stationary example , one may construct a simple model of a magnetic dipole to understand at a microscopic level the way in which the hidden mechanical momentum is stored by the dipole @xcite .",
    "given that exact cancellation of the electromagnetic field momentum and hidden mechanical momentum must occur in the stationary case , it should not be surprising that for quasi - stationary systems , there remains a cancellation of the electromagnetic field momentum proportional to the dipole and the non - kinematical portion of the hidden momentum of the bodies .",
    "the above considerations yield a rather surprising picture of what happens in the 1.5pc approximation when two charged , spinning bodies orbit each other with their spins and magnetic dipole moments lying in the orbital plane . during an orbit , there is a substantial transfer of momentum perpendicular to the orbital plane between the electromagnetic field and the bodies .",
    "nevertheless , when the momentum is transferred from the electromagnetic field to the bodies , it does not produce any net bobbing motion ; all of the perpendicular momentum transferred to the bodies from the fields goes into the hidden momentum of the bodies , and there is no net effect on the perpendicular motion of their centers of mass .",
    "net bobbing arises solely from the kinematic `` @xmath520 '' contribution to the hidden momentum  exactly as for the tetherballs of subsection [ sect : tether ] .",
    "as previously noted in subsection [ sect : cylsym ] , the gravitational case differs on a fundamental level from the electromagnetic one .",
    "the true acceleration ( or force ) and the true hidden momentum of each body ( nearly ) vanish in pure gravity . furthermore , although the total momentum of the complete system is well - defined if the spacetime is asymptotically flat , there is , in general , no meaningful way of assigning one portion of this total to the gravitational field and another portion to the bodies .",
    "field momentum need not be localizable or additive . nevertheless , the analogy established in sect .",
    "[ sect : analogy ] suggests that in the 1.5pn approximation , each body acts _ as though _ it possessed a hidden momentum @xmath341 ( where @xmath521 ) .",
    "this may be interpreted as arising from the usual kinematical contribution @xmath522 as well as a dynamical term @xmath523 ( corresponding to @xmath333 in the electromagnetic case ) .",
    "furthermore , the system acts _ as though _ , during each orbit , the dynamical portion of the hidden momentum is exchanged with gravitational field momentum .",
    "we have shown in this paper that bobbing behavior is a ubiquitous feature of the motion of relativistic spinning bodies .",
    "furthermore , we have shown explicitly that for the tetherball system , for the electromagnetic binary at 1.5pc order , and for the gravitational binary at 1.5pn order , the net bobbing is of a purely kinematic nature .    in the case of coalescing black holes , not only",
    "is bobbing behavior seen , but , in some cases , after merger the coalesced system receives a large `` velocity kick . '' in some cases , this kick appears to be a continuation of the net bobbing motion of the black holes just prior to merger .",
    "thus , it appears natural to expect that the velocity kick is closely related to the bobbing behavior and that , indeed , these could be two aspects of the same basic phenomenon .",
    "we now argue that this is not the case , and that the kicks and bobbing are essentially unrelated .    in the case of a merger of two bodies ,",
    "the resulting body should move inertially and , by , would be expected to have negligible hidden momentum .",
    "thus , in order have a velocity kick , it is necessary for the merged body to have a momentum kick as well . in order for this to be possible , it is necessary that momentum be carried off by another system . in the case of tetherballs ,",
    "this is impossible , since there is no other system available .",
    "thus , although the tetherball system bobs in a manner very similar to the black hole system , if the tetherballs were to merge , the merged system could not acquire any velocity kick .    on the other hand , a velocity kick should be possible in the merger of two charged spinning bodies .",
    "we have seen in the previous subsection that even in the 1.5pc approximation , a significant amount of momentum can be stored in the electromagnetic field ( see ) . if a merger event were to occur and",
    "if some rather than over all of space and then perform the same manipulations that led to , we find that a surface term contribution of @xmath524 now arises from the integration by parts .",
    "we thereby find that the field momentum contained within the ball is @xmath525 .",
    "this calculation shows that @xmath526 of the momentum stored in the electromagnetic field is located within  or very near  the bodies , and would not likely be released in a merger event .",
    "] of this field momentum could be `` released '' and allowed to radiate to infinity rather than be reabsorbed by the merged object , then the merged object would acquire a velocity kick .",
    "the 1.5pc approximation is not adequate to analyze kicks , because at this level of approximation , the field momentum can only be exchanged with the bodies and can not be radiated to infinity .",
    "however , it is not difficult to imagine that in a more relativistic system containing charged spinning bodies , a field momentum comparable to could be radiated to infinity if a merger event were to occur .",
    "although many of the quantitative details would undoubtedly differ from the 1.5pc approximation , we would expect ( net ) bobbing to be governed primarily by spin and kicks to be governed primarily by magnetic dipole moment .",
    "in particular , if the charged bodies have spin but no magnetic dipole moment ( e.g. , they are composed partly of uncharged rotating matter and partly of charged non - rotating matter ) then we would expect significant bobbing but no significant kick .",
    "by contrast , if the bodies have magnetic dipole moment but no spin ( e.g. , they contain oppositely charged portions that counter - rotate ) , then we would expect to have negligible net bobbing effects , but in suitable cases it might be possible for a merged object to acquire a large kick .",
    "similarly , if in an electromagnetic system we were to reverse the magnetic dipole moments but not the spins , then we would expect the net bobbing to be the same but the kick to reverse sign .    in the gravitational case ,",
    "both the kinematic net bobbing and the perpendicular field momentum are determined by @xmath520 at 1.5pn order and can not be varied independently .",
    "thus , in the gravitational case , it should not be surprising if the perpendicular kick velocity is correlated with the phase of net bobbing at merger , and if the maximum perpendicular kick velocity is the same order of magnitude as the maximum net bobbing velocity . nevertheless , it is our view that bobbing and kicks are most naturally viewed as independent phenomena .",
