    "success@xcite in isolating nearly perfect monolayer and few layer sheets from bulk graphite , along with progress@xcite in the epitaxial growth of few - layer graphene samples , has led to an explosion of experimental and theoretical@xcite interest in this interesting class of quasi - two - dimensional electron systems ( 2des s ) .",
    "unique aspects of the electronic structure of graphene based 2des s have raised a number of new fundamental physics issues and raised hope for applications .",
    "monolayer graphene has a honeycomb lattice structure and is a gapless semiconductor .",
    "hopping between its equivalent @xmath5 and @xmath6 sublattices gives rise to a massless dirac fermion band structure with @xmath7 chirality when the sublattice degree of freedom is treated as a pseudospin . in this paper",
    "we will find it useful to view the quantum two - level degree of freedom associated with two sublattice sites as a pseudospin in the multi - layer case as well . in ab - stacked graphene bilayers , for example ,",
    "electrons on the @xmath8 and @xmath9 sublattices are repelled from the fermi level by a direct interlayer tunneling process with energy @xmath10 , leaving@xcite only states that are concentrated on the @xmath11 and @xmath12 sites in the low - energy band - structure projection .",
    "when direct hopping between @xmath11 and @xmath12 sites is neglected , the two - step hopping process via high energy sites leads to @xmath13 conduction and valence band dispersions and to a pseudospin chirality that is doubled , _",
    "i.e. _ to a phase difference between sublattice projections which is proportional to @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the two - dimensional momentum orientation .",
    "pseudospin chirality has a substantial influence on interaction physics@xcite in both single - layer and bilayer graphene , and through the associated momentum space berry phases also on landau quantization and the integer quantum hall effect.@xcite .",
    "because the two low - energy sublattices in bilayer graphene are located on opposite layers it is possible to introduce@xcite a gap@xcite in the electronic structure simply by using gates to induce a difference in electric potential between layers . according to some theories a small gap could even emerge spontaneously@xcite in neutral graphene bilayers with weak disorder because of layer inversion symmetry - breaking .",
    "graphene bilayer 2des s are quite distinct from single layer 2des s because of their flatter band dispersion and the possibility of using external potentials to create gaps . among all stacking possibilities , only the abc arrangement ( see below ) maintains the following features that make bernal bilayer electronic structure interesting in thicker @xmath0-layer films : ( i ) there are two low - energy sublattice sites , implying that a two band model provides a useful tool to describe its physics ; ( ii ) the low energy sublattice sites are localized in the outermost layers , at @xmath11 and @xmath16 , and can be separated energetically by an electric field perpendicular to the film ; ( iii ) hopping between low energy sites via high energy states is an @xmath0-step process which leads to @xmath2 dispersion in conduction and valence bands , sublattice pseudospin chirality @xmath0 and berry phase @xmath17 .",
    "the low - energy bands are increasingly flat for larger @xmath0 , at least when weak remote hopping processes are neglected , and the opportunity for interesting interaction and disorder physics is therefore stronger .",
    "consequently , in the simplified chiral model , the density - of - states @xmath18 diverges as @xmath19 approaches zero for @xmath20 whereas it remains finite for @xmath21 and vanishes for @xmath22 .",
    "these properties also have some relevance to more general stacking arrangements since the low energy hamiltonian of a multilayer with any type of stacking can always be chiral - decomposed to a direct sum of abc - stacked layers.@xcite    abc - stacked multilayers are the chiral generalizations of monolayer and bernal bilayer graphene , and we refer them collectively as the chiral 2d electron system ( c2des ) family .",
    "we believe that they are likely to prove to be fertile ground for new physics . as a first step in the exploration of these materials we report in this paper on an effort to characterize the way in which the chirality @xmath0 bands of an @xmath0-layer c2des are altered by remote hopping processes neglected in the simplified model , focusing on the @xmath23 trilayer case .",
    "we use _ ab initio _ density functional theory ( dft ) calculations , combined with a @xmath3 expansion of the low - energy bands near the dirac point , to fit the parameters of a phenomenological tight - binding method ( ptbm ) for the @xmath1-bands of multilayer graphene.@xcite we find that details of the low - energy band dispersion can be used to fix rather definite values for the model s remote inter - layer hopping parameters .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we first sketch the derivation of the low energy effective band hamiltonian of a trilayer , reserving details to an appendix and explain how the interlayer hopping parameters influence the shape of constant energy surfaces .",
    "the values for these parameters obtained by fitting to our dft calculations are surprisingly different from the values for the analogous hopping parameters in bernal stacked layers , and are not yet available from experiment . in section",
    "ii we also discuss the evolution of constant energy surface pockets with energy , concentrating on the lifshitz transitions at which pockets combine , in terms of berry phase considerations and a competition between chiral dispersion and trigonal warping . in section",
    "iii we use dft to estimate the dependence of the trilayer energy gap on the external potential difference between top and bottom layers and compare with predictions based on the simplified two - band model .",
    "the simplified model picture is readily extended to higher @xmath0 and we use it to discuss trends in thicker abc multilayers .",
    "finally , we conclude in section iv with a discussion of how berry phases modify the integer quantum hall effect and weak localization in c2des s and with some speculations on the role of electron - electron interactions in these two - dimensional materials .",

    "[ fig : one](a ) , each adjacent layer pair forms a ab - stacked bilayer with the upper @xmath6 sublattice directly on top of the lower @xmath5 sublattice , and the upper @xmath5 above the center of a hexagonal plaquette of the layer below .",

    "we have retained leading terms with cubic , quadratic , and constant dispersions , which are due respectively to three - step , two - step , and one - step hopping processes between low energy sites . for trilayer graphene , the linear term is absent because the one step hopping ( @xmath30 ) is normal to the 2d space and therefore independent of momentum .",

    "@xmath75 is proportional to @xmath76 and , because it is isotropic in 2d momentum space , is responsible for trigonal warping of constant energy surfaces when combined with the @xmath73 chiral term .",

    "this term in the effective hamiltonian preserves layer inversion symmetry .",
    "@xmath79 captures the external potential processes which break layer inversion symmetry and introduce a gap between electron and hole bands .",
    "the possibility of opening a gap with an external potential is unique to abc stacked multilayers , increasing the possibility that they could be useful materials for future semiconductor devices .",
    "the strength of the gap term decreases with increasing momentum ( since @xmath80 ) so that the gap around @xmath43 has a mexican hat shape , as we will discuss later .",

    "@xmath0 landau levels are pinned to the neutral system fermi level for each spin and valley . at the lowest energies , within around @xmath183mev of the neutral system fermi level",

    "we expect both disorder and interaction effects to be strong within this family of low - dimensional electron systems , which should be accessible to experimental study in samples for which disorder is weak on the energy scale over which the low - energy effective model applies .    in summary , we have derived an effective model for trilayers , extracted the hopping parameters for abc - stacked multilayers , from dft and studied the trilayer fermi surfaces .",
