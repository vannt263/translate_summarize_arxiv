    "<S> the elementary excitations of a state of matter consisting of large collection of interacting particles can be very different from the original particles . in the most interesting examples , </S>",
    "<S> the particles effectively decompose into smaller constituent particles , which only carry a fraction of their quantum numbers . when these constituents are free , as in fractionally quantised hall states , it is conceptually clear how to observe them . </S>",
    "<S> but what if they are confined , as it might be the case in spin liquids hypothesised to describe high @xmath0 superconductors ?    </S>",

    "<S> email : greiter@tkm.uni-karlsruhe.de    the classic example of confinement among constituent particles is given by the theory of the strong interactions in particle physics , also known as quantum chromodynamics@xcite ( qcd ) . </S>",
    "<S> the theory assumes that hadrons , which most prominently include protons , neutrons , and pions , consist of several smaller particles called quarks , which among other quantum numbers carry fractional charge and are held together through a non - abelian gauge field interactions , or equivalently , through the interchange of virtual particles called gluons . </S>",
    "<S> this interaction couples to an su(3 ) quantum number , which is called colour and can take the nominal values `` red '' , `` blue '' or `` green '' . unlike weak , electromagnetic , and gravitational forces , the force mediated by the gluons does not decrease with increasing distance , which confines the quarks into bound states with no net colour , or technically speaking , su(3 ) colour singlets . depending on which quarks one combines to form these singlets , one obtains protons , neutrons , and so on . </S>",
    "<S> all the hadrons are comparatively heavy , as a lot of energy is stored in the internal field configuration where the quarks wiggle around each other vigorously but can not escape . </S>",
    "<S> this theory has not led to quantitative advances in nuclear physics , as contemporary methods do not allow us to evaluate systems consisting of significant numbers of strongly interacting quarks , but has still been confirmed experimentally , due to a property called `` asymptotic freedom '' . </S>",
    "<S> this property implies that the quarks interact only weakly if probed at sufficiently high energies , which makes them visible in high - energy experiments .    in certain condensed matter systems , </S>",
    "<S> similar constituent particles appear as collective excitations of strongly correlated many body states . </S>",
    "<S> the most established examples are the fractionally charged quasiparticles in quantised hall states@xcite and spinons  that is , particles with the spin of an electron but without the charge , in models of antiferromagnetically interacting spins ( _ i.e. _ , neighbouring spins like to point in opposite directions ) on a one - dimensional lattice@xcite ( _ i.e. _ , spin chains ) . in both these examples , the constituent particles are `` free '' , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ , deconfined , which greatly eased the task of observing and hence establishing them . </S>",
    "<S> there are other instances , however , where theoretical models suggest that the constituent particles are confined , as the quarks in qcd are . </S>",
    "<S> it has been a long outstanding problem to observe them experimentally in these systems , as most probes just detect the bound states without revealing the internal structure . </S>",
    "<S> on page xxx of this issue , lake and colleagues@xcite report the first observation of a crossover between confined and deconfined spinon excitations through variation of the energy scale they employ in inelastic neutron scattering experiments on a quantum magnet . to borrow jargon from particles physics , they observed `` asymptotically free '' spinons with spin @xmath1 at high energy transfers and bound states of them with spin @xmath2 at lower energies . or put more simply , they have observed confinement in a condensed matter system .    to see how they accomplished this , a little bit of background is helpful </S>",
    "<S> . let us begin with the fractional quantisation of charge in the laughlin state@xcite describing the a quantised hall fluid at landau level ( ll ) filling fraction 1/3 . </S>",
    "<S> there are three times as many states in the lowest ll as there are electrons . </S>",
    "<S> analyticity properties require that the many body wave function has as many zeros in each particle coordinate as there are states , that is , three times as many as there are electrons . </S>",
    "<S> the fermi statistics of the electrons requires that one of the zeros for a given electron coordinate coincides with each of the positions of the other electrons . </S>",
    "<S> the distinguishing feature of the laughlin state is that all the remaining zeros are also attached to the electrons , such that each coordinate coincides three zeros . a true hole in the liquid is consequently given by three zeros without an electron attached . </S>",
    "<S> these three zeros will repell each other , and each of them will form a `` quasihole '' . as the hole had an effective charge @xmath3 ( where @xmath4 is the electron charge ) , each quasihole will have charge @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> this charge has been observed in resonant tunnelling experiments@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the mechanism for fractional quantisation of spin in antiferromagnetic spin chains@xcite is actually similar , except that the electrons are now replaced by spin - flips , which carry spin one . </S>",
    "<S> we view the spin - up - flips as `` particles '' in a background where all the spins point down . </S>",
    "<S> since the antiferromagnetic interaction favours neighbouring spin to anti - align , it induces an effective repulsion between the spin - flips , which takes the role of the coulomb repulsion between the electrons in the quantum hall liquid . </S>",
    "<S> the emergence of fractionally quantised excitations , `` spinons '' with one half of the spin of a spin flip , is illustrated in figure 1 . </S>",
    "<S> in analogy to the creation of the hole in the quantum hall fluid , we remove a spin - up - flip or create a spin - down - flip by turning an up spin into a down spin in figure 1a . </S>",
    "<S> this creates two domain walls ( _ i.e. _ , parallel spins ) on each side of the spin we flipped , which propagate independently , as shown in figure 1b . </S>",
    "<S> as the spin - flip carried spin one , each of the domain walls or spinons will carry spin 1/2 .    </S>",
    "<S> the most direct way to observe the spinons is through inelastic neutron scattering , which in essence measures the energy absorption spectrum for spin flips at various wave vectors . </S>",
    "<S> if the spin flip were to create only one particle , one would observe a resonance with a well defined energy . as it decays into two smaller constituent particles , the spinons , </S>",
    "<S> there is a continuum of ways to distribute the total momentum of the spin flip among the spinons . </S>",
    "<S> this yields a continuous absorption spectrum , and is exactly what lake and colleagues observe when probing their system at high energies .    </S>",
    "<S> confinement among spinons results if one couples two antiferromagnetic spin chains@xcite , as illustrated in figure 1c . </S>",
    "<S> if one creates two domain walls or spinons at some distance along the chains , the spins on the rungs between the spinons become ferromagnetically aligned ( _ i.e. _ , they point in the same direction ) , which costs energy as the interaction across the rungs favours them to align antiferromagnetically . </S>",
    "<S> the associated cost in energy is hence proportional to the number of these rungs , and the force between the spinons does not decrease with the distance .    </S>",
    "<S> the energy gap associated with the confinement can now be understood as the quantum mechanical zero - point energy of the constant force oscillator describing the relative motion of the two spinons@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the first excited state of this oscillator is also important , as the wave function describing it is antisymmetric under spinon interchange while the ground state is symmetric . </S>",
    "<S> the wave function in spin space is therefore likewise symmetric ( _ i.e. _ , a spin triplet ) for the ground state and antisymmetric ( _ i.e. _ , a spin singlet ) for the first excited state .    </S>",
    "<S> the energy gap for magnetic excitations in antiferromagnetic ladder systems ( _ i.e. _ , coupled spin chains ) is long established@xcite . but beyond theoretical models@xcite , it is not at all clear how one can establish , even as a matter of principle , that we are really looking at confined spinons . </S>",
    "<S> lake and her colleagues succeed through an ingenious combination of two factors . </S>",
    "<S> first , the material they probe is effectively critical at the relevant energies , which implies that the lowest energy excitations are gapless . </S>",
    "<S> second , by comparing the measured intensity of the magnetic absorption spectrum around what would be the magnetic ordering wave vector if the system were ordered to universal predictions of a conformal field theory , the so - called su(2 ) level @xmath6 wess - zumino - novikov - witten model@xcite , they are able to extract the spin of the now effectively gapless excitations as they vary the energy at which they measure the magnetic absorption spectrum . this enables them to establish that the spin of the critical low energy excitations is effectively @xmath7 in the energy window between 10 and 32 mev , and @xmath8 above a crossover regime extending up to roughly 70 mev . in other words , </S>",
    "<S> they observe how `` asymptotically free '' spinons at high energies evolve into excitations with spin @xmath7 as they lower the energy , and thereby show that the @xmath7 triplon excitations are bound states of confined spinons with @xmath8 each .    </S>",
    "<S> let me conclude with a personal view why this experiment is important . </S>",
    "<S> one of the main problems in contemporary condensed matter physics , if not physics in general , is the problem of high @xmath9 superconductivity in the cuprates@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the materials consist of weakly coupled cuo layers , which are responsible for the anomalous properties and for most purposes adequately described by two - dimensional antiferromagnets doped with mobile holes . </S>",
    "<S> we may view the planes as infinite arrays of strongly coupled spin chains , as compared to the weakly coupled pairs of chains investigated by lake _ </S>",
    "<S> et al._. many of the key properties , including the superconductivity and the anomalous properties of the so - called pseudo - gap phase , could be understood very plausibly if the holes where in fact spinon - holon bound states held together by a strong confinement force . </S>",
    "<S> if lake and her colleagues could confirm this picture at a level similar to the results reported for spinon confinement in coupled chains , it would provide a huge step towards solving high @xmath9 .    </S>",
