    "homestake , gallex , sage , kamiokande , super - kamiokande and sno [ 1 - 6 ] , these are the six solar neutrino experiments for which up to date experimental results are available . out of these six detectors ,",
    "first three are radiochemical detectors and can measure only the total event rate produced by the electron neutrinos , where as other three are water - cherenkov detectors and provide the facility to record the time of the event , energy of the scattered electron and scattering angle .",
    "these detectors are sensitive to all flavors of neutrinos .",
    "all these detectors have detected solar neutrinos at the rate much smaller than predicted by the standard solar model ( ssm ) [ 7 ] .",
    "this discrepancy between ssm and experimental measurements is called solar neutrino puzzle ( snp ) .",
    "the puzzle can be explained in two general ways .",
    "perhaps the solar models do not accurately describe the sun .",
    "perhaps the known theories of neutrino do not accurately describe it .    at present",
    "it is difficult to accept ( 1 ) because the ssm has been very successful in describing many features of the sun , particularly the latest confirmation of the ssm s prediction of the velocity of sound at the surface of sun through helioseismological studies [ 7 ] .",
    "now it is generally believed that the solution of the puzzle is to come from the particle theory .",
    "the most elegant solution , which the particle physics provides , is the neutrino oscillation. the phenomena in which different flavors of neutrino may oscillate into each other while passing through vacuum or matter [ 8 ] . the exact amount of depletion which may be caused by the oscillations , however , depends on the neutrinos squared mass differences and mixing angles .",
    "the global analysis of solar neutrino data , in which we fix the values of these parameters so that the difference between the predicted and measured rates is minimum , reveals that there are many possible solutions in the frame work of neutrino oscillations [ 9 ] .",
    "however , these solutions have different goodness - of - fit ( g.o.f ) .",
    "the latest analysis shows that the large mixing angle ( lma ) solution have the highest g.o.f and hence most probable [ 9 ] .",
    "there is another mode of analysis in which we try to probe the oscillations from the experimental data , without using the prediction of solar neutrinos flux by the ssm . in this model independent analysis",
    "we compare the data in the same or different solar neutrinos experiments and try to find out whether it is consistent with the neutrino oscillations or not [ 10 ] .",
    "this comparison of the solar neutrino data obtained from different detectors , however , requires the equalization of their response functions .",
    "the equalization of the response functions of two different detectors is non - trivial phenomena and so far it has been possible only for the sk and sno detectors . in [ 10,11,12 ]",
    "the authors have proved that it is possible to equalize the response functions of the sk and sno by changing the trigger threshold or energy bins of one of these detectors .",
    "the comparison , after the equalization of the response functions , reveals that the results obtained from the sk and sno are consistent with the neutrino oscillations[6,10 ] .    in the equalization of these response functions , accurate values of the cross sections of neutrino - electron ( @xmath0 ) and neutrino - deuteron ( @xmath1 ) reactions , occurring in the sk and sno respectively , are very important .",
    "the most accurate calculations of the cross sections of @xmath0 process is given in [ 16 ] .",
    "these calculations include the effect qed and qcd radiative corrections up to one - loop . for neutrino - deuteron reactions ,",
    "the most successful method used is the standard nuclear physics approach ( snpa ) based on one - body impulse approximation terms and two - body exchange - current terms acting on non - relativistic nuclear wave function .",
    "the status of the first detailed calculation based on snpa is given in [ 17 ] , referred as kubodera - nozawa  ( kn ) calculations .",
    "the calculated values of the cross section of @xmath1 process in [ 17 ] have been used in the equalization of response functions of the sk and sno in [ 10,11,12 ] .",
    "the work of kubodera and nozawa was further improved by using more accurate nn potentials and nucleon weak - interaction form factors [ 18 ] . in the literature",
    "this improved work is referred as the nsgk calculations .",
    "the estimates of nsgk calculations have been further improved by about 1% by updating some of its inputs and by taking into account the results of recent effective - field - theoretical calculation [ 19 ] .    in our work",
    "we have studied the response functions of the sk and sno detectors for b@xmath2 neutrinos using the most accurate estimate of cross sections of @xmath0 and @xmath1 process taken from reference [ 16 ] and [ 19 ] respectively . in section 2 we present the basic definitions of the response functions . in section 3 and 4",
    "we present our results of the comparison of the response functions . as a consequence of the approximate equalization of the response functions , we show in section 5 , that in the presence of active neutrino oscillations , how the total event rates and event rates for energy bins of the sk and sno detectors are related to each other .",
    "the solar neutrinos are detected in the sk by the following elastic scattering ( es ) process .",
    "@xmath3    this process is caused either by the electron neutrino @xmath4 or other two active neutrinos @xmath5 with cross sections @xmath6and @xmath7 respectively .    in the sno ,",
    "the neutrinos are detected by the following charged - current ( cc ) and neutral - current ( nc ) processes .",
    "@xmath8    the cc process is caused by only electron neutrinos with cross section @xmath9where as nc process is caused by the all three flavors of neutrinos with the same cross section @xmath10    all the scattering events in the sk and sno are detected by detecting the cherenkov radiation emitted by the scattered electron along its direction of motion .",
    "this method allows us to record the energy as well as the direction of the scattered electrons .",
    "however , due to finite detector resolution the measured energy @xmath11 is expected to be scattered around its actual value @xmath12 according to some well - defined distribution function , called resolution of the detector [ 13 - 15 ] . in this way it is possible to define the total event rates by applying some limit on the minimum value of the measured energy , called trigger threshold and event rate for a measured energy range , called energy bin .",
    "normally the trigger threshold and energy bin are taken not less than 5 - 6 mev to reduce the background effects . at this higher value of threshold",
    "only b@xmath13  or possibly hep neutrinos contribute to the measured events .",
    "the response function for the total event rate ( or the rate for an energy bin ) is the normalized effective cross section for producing the scattered electron with the measured energy greater than the trigger threshold e@xmath14(or lying in a specific energy bin ) [ 11,12,14 ] .",
    "the response functions ( rf ) relevant for our work are    @xmath15 , the rf of es @xmath16 for event rate above @xmath17    @xmath18 , the rf of es @xmath19 for event rate above @xmath20    @xmath21 , the rf of cc @xmath16 for event rate above @xmath20    @xmath22 , the rf of es @xmath16 for event rate in @xmath23 energy bin    @xmath24 , the rf of es @xmath19 for event rate in @xmath23 energy bin    @xmath25 , the rf of cc @xmath16 for event rate in @xmath23 energy bin    these response functions are defined as following .",
    "@xmath26    where the differential cross sections @xmath27 and @xmath28 for es processes are taken from ref [ 16 ] and @xmath29 for cc process is taken from the ref [ 19 ] .",
    "it is noted that in [ 10,11,12 ] the authors have used old theoretical data for cc process [ 17 ] .",
    "@xmath30 and @xmath31 are the resolutions functions of the sk and sno respectively .",
    "@xmath32 is the normalized energy spectrum of b@xmath33 neutrinos .",
    "the denominators represent the b@xmath33 neutrinos total cross sections for producing an electron with the observed energy greater than the trigger threshold or lying with in the specific energy bin as per the definition of response function .",
    "the denominator in each expression is obtained by integrating the numerator over the energy @xmath34 of b@xmath35 neutrinos .",
    "in this section , it is shown that the following total response functions for the sk and sno can be equalized to a good approximation by an appropriate choice of the trigger threshold .",
    "@xmath36    equalization of es response functions of the sk for @xmath37 and @xmath38 neutrinos is accurately possible where as the es response function of the sk for @xmath37 can be approximately equalize to the cc response function of sno for @xmath39 by changing the trigger threshold of either of the detectors . in order to compare the response functions , we determine the following integral differences .",
    "by requiring the minimization of these integral differences we obtain the best equalization of the response functions .",
    "these integral difference are zero if the equations [ e1 ] and [ e2 ] satisfy exactly .",
    "it is found that the first integral difference is zero at all values of @xmath17 . in minimizing the second integral difference",
    ", we take sno s threshold , @xmath41 mev and obtain the value of @xmath42 for different values of sk s threshold @xmath43 . the results in figure [ g1 ]",
    "shows that @xmath44 has one minima at @xmath45 mev . at this value of sk s threshold ,",
    "the response function are best equalized .",
    "figure [ g2 ] shows the graphs of these approximately equalized response functions of the sk and sno .",
    "the value of @xmath46 obtained by the old theoretical data of cc cross section in [ 10,11 ] , is 8.6 mev . in the combined sk and sno data analysis by sno collaboration in [ 6 ] , the value of 8.5 mev was used , which is in agreement with our calculation .",
    "in this section , it is shown that the following response functions of the sk and sno for the energy bins can be equalized to a good approximation by an appropriate choice of the range of energy bins .",
    "@xmath47    equalization of the es response functions of sk for @xmath37 and @xmath38 neutrino is accurately possible for the same energy bins where as the cc response function of sno for @xmath37 can be approximately equalized to es response function of sk for @xmath37 for different energy bins . in order to compare these response functions , we determine the following integral differences .",
    "@xmath48    by requiring the minimization of these integral differences , we obtain the best equalization of the response functions for energy bins .",
    "it is found that the first integral difference is zero for all energy bins of sk . in minimizing the second integral difference",
    ", we take 13 different energy bins of the sk for which the experimental data is available and obtain the values of @xmath44 for different energy bins of sno . for each energy bin of sk",
    ", we find the energy bin of sno for which @xmath42 is minimum .",
    "the results are summarized in the table [ t1 ] .",
    "figure [ g3 ] and [ g4 ] shows the graphs of these approximately equalized response functions for energy bins of the sk and sno .",
    "after equalizing the total and energy bin response functions of the sk and sno , it is possible to relate the corresponding event rates [ 10,11,12 ] .",
    "first we relate the total event rate defined above the trigger threshold . these total event rate , assuming no oscillation , are given by .",
    "@xmath49    where @xmath50 is the ssm s predicted total flux of b@xmath33 neutrinos and @xmath51 @xmath52 are total effective cross section for observing the event above the trigger threshold of sk and sno respectively .",

    "now if these response functions are equal , as they are by the equations 14 and 15 , then it implies the equalization of these three response function s weighted survival probabilities . @xmath59    the event rates normalized to un - oscillated rates are now given by @xmath60 \\\\",

    "similarly by applying the equalization of the response functions of the sk and sno for energy bins , we can obtain the similar relation between the sk and sno event rates for energy bins .",
    "@xmath64    where @xmath65 and @xmath66 are the normalized event rates of @xmath23 energy bin of sk and sno respectively and @xmath67 are the effective cross sections for producing the event in the @xmath23 energy bin by @xmath37 and @xmath38 neutrinos .",
    "the values of these cross sections are given in table  1 .",
