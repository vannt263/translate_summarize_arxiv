    "understanding the details of the galaxy in which we live is one of the great intellectual challenges embraced by modern science .",
    "our galaxy contains a complex mix of stars , planets , interstellar gas and dust , radiation , and the ubiquitous dark matter .",
    "these components are widely distributed in age ( reflecting their birth rate ) , in space ( reflecting their birth places and subsequent motions ) , on orbits ( determined by the gravitational force generated by their own mass ) , and with complex distributions of chemical element abundances ( determined by the past history of star formation and gas accretion ) .",
    "astrophysics has now developed the tools to measure these distributions in space , kinematics , and chemical abundance , and to interpret the distribution functions to map , and to understand , the formation , structure , evolution , and future of our entire galaxy .",
    "this potential understanding is also of profound significance for quantitative studies of the high - redshift universe : a well - studied nearby template galaxy would underpin the analysis of unresolved galaxies with other facilities , and at other wavelengths .",
    "understanding the structure and evolution of the galaxy requires three complementary observational approaches : ( i ) a census of the contents of a large , representative , part of the galaxy ; ( ii ) quantification of the present spatial structure , from distances ; ( iii ) knowledge of the three - dimensional space motions , to determine the gravitational field and the stellar orbits .",
    "astrometric measurements uniquely provide model - independent distances and transverse kinematics , and form the basis of the cosmic distance scale .",
    "complementary radial velocity and photometric information are required to complete the kinematic and astrophysical information about the individual objects observed .",
    "photometry , with appropriate astrometric and astrophysical calibration , gives a knowledge of extinction , and hence , combined with astrometry , provides intrinsic luminosities , spatial distribution functions , and stellar chemical abundance and age information .",
    "radial velocities complete the kinematic triad , allowing determination of dynamical motions , gravitational forces , and the distribution of invisible mass .",
    "the gaia mission will provide all this information .    even before the end of the hipparcos mission , a proposal for an ambitious follow - on space astrometry experiment was submitted to esa ( roemer : @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the idea of using ccds as a modulation detector behind a grid ( @xcite ) , similar to hipparcos , was replaced by the more powerful option adopted for roemer ( @xcite ) where ccds measure the direct stellar images in time - delayed integration ( tdi ) mode in the scanning satellite .",
    "a more ambitious interferometric mission , gaia , was proposed and subsequently recommended as a cornerstone mission of the esa science programme by the horizon 2000 + survey committee in 1994 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the gaia proposal demonstrated that accuracies of 10  @xmath1as at 15  mag were achievable using a small interferometer ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the european scientific community and esa have now completed a detailed study of the science case and instrument design , identifying a number of further improvements , including reverting to full - aperture telescopes ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the results demonstrate that unique and fundamental advances in astrophysics are technically achievable on the proposed time - scales , and within a budget profile consistent with the current esa cornerstone mission financial envelope .",
    "gaia will be a continuously scanning spacecraft , accurately measuring one - dimensional coordinates along great circles in two simultaneous fields of view , separated by a well - known angle .",
    "the payload utilises a large but feasible ccd focal plane assembly , passive thermal control , natural short - term instrument stability due to the sun shield and the selected orbit , and a robust payload design .",
    "the telescopes are of moderate size , with no specific manufacturing complexity .",
    "the system fits within a dual - launch ariane  5 configuration , without deployment of any payload elements .",
    "the study identifies a ` lissajous ' orbit at l2 as the preferred operational orbit , from where about 1  mbit of data per second is returned to the single ground station throughout the 5-year mission .",
    "a comprehensive accuracy assessment has validated the proposed payload and the subsequent data reduction .",
    "this paper provides a summary of the key features of the improved gaia design , and the resulting scientific case , evaluated during the recent study phase ( @xcite ; see also http://astro.estec.esa.nl/gaia ) . a comparison between the scientific goals of gaia , and other post - hipparcos space astrometry missions ,",
    "is given in section  [ sec : other - missions ] .",
    "the primary objective of the gaia mission is to observe the physical characteristics , kinematics and distribution of stars over a large fraction of the volume of our galaxy , with the goal of achieving a full understanding of its dynamics and structure , and consequently its formation and history ( see , e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; as well as extensive details of the scientific case given in @xcite ) . an overview of the main galaxy components and sub - populations is given in table  [ tab : tracers ] , together with requirements on astrometric accuracy and limiting magnitude .",

    "the full evolutionary history of the galaxy is determinable ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "determination of the relative rates of formation of the stellar populations in a large spiral , typical of those galaxies which dominate the luminosity in the universe , will provide for the first time quantitative tests of galaxy formation models .",
    "do large galaxies form from accumulation of many smaller systems which have already initiated star formation ?",
    "does star formation begin in a gravitational potential well in which much of the gas is already accumulated ? does the bulge pre - date , postdate , or is it contemporaneous with , the halo and inner disk ? is the thick disk a mix of the early disk and a later major merger ?",
    "is there a radial age gradient in the older stars ? is the history of star formation relatively smooth , or highly episodic ?",
    "answers to such questions will also provide a template for analysis of data on unresolved stellar systems , where similar data can not be obtained .",
    "gaia will provide distances of unprecedented accuracy for all types of stars of all stellar populations , even those in the most rapid evolutionary phases which are very sparsely represented in the solar neighbourhood .",
    "all parts of the hertzsprung  russell diagram will be comprehensively calibrated , from pre - main sequence stars to white dwarfs and all transient phases ; all possible masses , from brown dwarfs to the most massive o  stars ; all types of variable stars ; all possible types of binary systems down to brown dwarf and planetary systems ; all standard distance indicators , etc .",
    "this extensive amount of data of extreme accuracy will stimulate a revolution in the exploration of stellar and galactic formation and evolution , and the determination of the cosmic distance scale ( cf .",
    ".      the gaia large - scale photometric survey will have significant intrinsic scientific value for stellar astrophysics , providing valuable samples of variable stars of nearly all types , including detached eclipsing binaries , contact or semi - contact binaries , and pulsating stars ( cf .",
    "the pulsating stars include key distance calibrators such as cepheids and rr  lyrae stars and long - period variables .",
    "existing samples are incomplete already at magnitudes as bright as @xmath20  mag .",
    "a complete sample of objects will allow determination of the frequency of variable objects , and will accurately calibrate period - luminosity relationships across a wide range of stellar parameters including metallicity",
    ". a systematic variability search will also allow identification of stars in short - lived but key stages of stellar evolution , such as the helium core flash and the helium shell thermal pulses and flashes .",
    "prompt processing will identify many targets for follow - up ground - based studies .",
    "estimated numbers are highly uncertain , but suggest some 18  million variable stars in total , including 5  million ` classic ' periodic variables , 23  million eclipsing binaries , 20008000 cepheids , 60000240000 @xmath21  scuti variables , 70000 rr  lyrae , and 140000170000 miras ( @xcite ) .",
    "a key scientific issue regarding double and multiple star formation is the distribution of mass - ratios @xmath22 . for wide pairs ( @xmath23  arcsec )",
    "this is indirectly given through the distribution of magnitude differences .",
    "gaia will provide a photometric determination of the @xmath22-distribution down to @xmath24 , covering the expected maximum around @xmath25 .",
    "furthermore , the large numbers of ( ` 5-year ' ) astrometric orbits , will allow derivation of the important statistics of the very smallest ( brown dwarf ) masses as well as the detailed distribution of orbital eccentricities ( @xcite ) .",
    "gaia is extremely sensitive to non - linear proper motions .",
    "a large fraction of all astrometric binaries with periods from 0.0330 years will be immediately recognized by their poor fit to a standard single - star model .",
    "most will be unresolved , with very unequal mass - ratios and/or magnitudes , but in many cases a photocentre orbit can be determined . for this period range , the absolute and relative binary frequency can be established , with the important possibility of exploring variations with age and place of formation in the galaxy .",
    "some 10  million binaries closer than 250  pc should be detected , with very much larger numbers still detectable out to 1  kpc and beyond .",
    "sub - stellar companions can be divided in two classes : brown dwarfs and planets . there",
    "exist three major genesis indicators that can help classify sub - stellar objects as either brown dwarfs or planets : mass , shape and alignment of the orbit , and composition and thermal structure of the atmosphere .",
    "mass alone is not decisive .",
    "the ability to simultaneously and systematically determine planetary frequency and distribution of orbital parameters for the stellar mix in the solar neighbourhood is a fundamental contribution that gaia will uniquely provide .",
    "any changes in planetary frequency with age or metallicity will come from observations of stars of all ages    an isolated brown dwarf is typically visible only at ages @xmath26  gyr because of their rapidly fading luminosity with time .",
    "however , in a binary system , the mass is conserved , and the gravitational effects on a main - sequence secondary remain observable over much longer intervals .",
    "gaia will have the power to investigate the mass - distribution of brown - dwarf binaries with 130  year periods , of all ages , through analysis of the astrometric orbits .",
    "there are a number of techniques which in principle allow the detection of extra - solar planetary systems : these include pulsar timing , radial velocity measurements , astrometric techniques , transit measurements , microlensing , and direct methods based on high - angular resolution interferometric imaging .",
    "a better understanding of the conditions under which planetary systems form and of their general properties requires sensitivity to low mass planets ( down to @xmath27 ) , characterization of known systems ( mass , and orbital elements ) , and complete samples of planets , with useful upper limits on jupiter - mass planets out to several  au from the central star ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "astrometric measurements good to 210  @xmath1as will contribute substantially to these goals , and will complement the ongoing radial velocity measurement programmes . although sim will be able to study in detail targets detected by other methods , including microlensing , gaia s strength will be its discovery potential , following from the astrometric monitoring of all of the several hundred thousand bright stars out to distances of @xmath28  pc ( @xcite ) .",
    "solar system objects present a challenge to gaia because of their significant proper motions , but they promise a rich scientific reward .",
    "the minor bodies provide a record of the conditions in the proto - solar nebula , and their properties therefore shed light on the formation of planetary systems .",
    "the relatively small bodies located in the main asteroid belt between mars and jupiter should have experienced limited thermal evolution since the early epochs of planetary accretion . due to the radial extent of the main belt ,",
    "minor planets provide important information about the gradient of mineralogical composition of the early planetesimals as a function of heliocentric distance .",
    "it is therefore important for any study of the origin and evolution of the solar system to investigate the main physical properties of asteroids including masses , densities , sizes , shapes , and taxonomic classes , all as a function of location in the main belt and in the trojan clouds .",
    "the possibility of determining asteroid masses relies on the capability of measuring the tiny gravitational perturbations that asteroids experience in case of a mutual close approach . at present",
    "only about 10 asteroid masses are known , mostly with quite poor accuracy .",
    "asteroid - asteroid encounters have been modelled , and show that gaia will allow more than 100 asteroid masses to be determined accurately .",
    "albedo is a useful complement to spectrophotometric data for the definition of different taxonomic classes .",
    "the gaia photometry will be much more reliable than most data presently available .",
    "the colour indices will provide a taxonomic classification for the whole sample of observed asteroids .    for direct orbit determinations of known asteroids ,",
    "preliminary simulations have been performed in which the covariance matrices of the orbital elements of more than 6000 asteroids were computed using both the whole set of astrometric observations collected from ground - based telescopes since 1895 through 1995 , as well as a set of simulated observations carried out by gaia , computed by considering a 5  year lifetime of the mission , and present instrument performances .",
    "another set of simulated ground - based observations covering the period 19962015 were also performed . for the known asteroids the predicted ephemeris errors based on the gaia observations alone 100  years after the end of the mission are more than a factor  30 better than the predicted ephemeris errors corresponding to the whole set of past and future ground - based observations . in other words , after the collection of the gaia data , all the results of more than one century of ground - based asteroid astrometry will be largely superseded .",
    "in addition to known asteroids , gaia will discover a very large number , of the order of @xmath29 or @xmath30 new objects , depending on the uncertainties on the extrapolations of the known population .",
    "it should be possible to derive precise orbits for many of the newly discovered objects , since each of them will be observed many times during the mission lifetime .",
    "these will include a large number of near - earth asteroids .",
    "the combination of on - board detection , faint limiting magnitude , observations at small sun - aspect angles , high accuracy in the instantaneous angular velocity ( 0.25  mas  s@xmath31 ) , and confirmation from successive field transits , means that gaia will provide a detailed census of atens , apollos and amors , extending as close as 0.5  au to the sun , and down to diameters of about 260590  m at 1  au , depending on albedo and observational geometry .",
    "gaia will not only provide a representative census of the stars throughout the galaxy , but it will also make unique contributions to extragalactic astronomy ( table  [ tab : gg_local - group ] ) .",
    "these include the structure , dynamics and stellar populations in the local group , especially the magellanic clouds , m31 and m33 , the space motions of local group galaxies , a multi - colour survey of galaxies ( @xcite ) , and studies of supernovae ( @xcite ) , galactic nuclei , and quasars .",
    "[ tbh ]    [ cols=\"<,>,>,<,<,^,^ , > , > , > \" , ]",
    "gaia will create an extraordinarily precise three - dimensional map of about one billion stars throughout our galaxy and the local group .",
    "it will map their space motions , which encode the origin and subsequent evolution of the galaxy , and the distribution of dark matter . through on - board photometry",
    ", it will provide the detailed physical properties of each star observed : luminosity , temperature , gravity , and elemental composition , which encode the star formation and chemical enrichment history of the galaxy .",
    "radial velocity measurements on board will complete the kinematic information for a significant fraction of the objects observed .    through continuous sky scanning , the satellite will repeatedly measure positions and colours of all objects down to @xmath0  mag . on - board object detection ensures a complete census , including variable stars and quasars , supernovae , and minor planets .",
    "it also circumvents costly pre - launch target selection activities .",
    "final accuracies of 10  microarcsec at 15  mag will provide distances accurate to 10  per cent as far as the galactic centre .",
    "stellar motions will be measured even in the andromeda galaxy .    in order to limit failure modes ,",
    "the instrument design includes only one deployable element ( the sun shield / solar array ) and only three on - board mechanisms ( two secondary mirror correctors , one for each of the astrometric telescopes , and an orientation adjustment for the spectroscopic ccds ) . operation of the focal plane is robust against failure of individual ccds , or against failure of one or more ` rows ' of the main focal plane ( whether it be the sky mapper , the main detectors , or the on - board data handling units associated with each such row ) , which would correspond to no more than a loss of overall observing time .",
    "the ccds for the medium - band photometer and radial velocity spectrograph are designed so that the loss if one ccd leads to the loss of only the upper or lower half of one colour band , amounting to a ` graceful degradation ' of the mission s science goals .",
    "loss of throughput , of whatever form , would lead to a decrease in the limiting magnitude , and a corresponding degradation of the astrometric accuracy as a function of magnitude .",
    "it is not easy to quantify ` break points ' in the scientific case at which the astrometric improvement compared to hipparcos , occasioned by failures or performance limitations , would cease to have a significant scientific impact , as evidenced by the selection of both the fame and diva missions .",
    "nonetheless , a limiting magnitude of 20  mag , accuracies of 10  @xmath1arcsec at 15  mag , and the provision of in - depth photometric and radial velocity data for each object , remain primary mission goals .",
    "gaia s main scientific objective is to clarify the origin and history of our galaxy , from a quantitative census of the stellar populations .",
    "it will advance fundamental questions such as when the stars in the milky way formed , when and how the milky way was assembled , and the distribution of dark matter in our galaxy .",
    "in so doing , it will pinpoint exotic objects in substantial numbers : many thousands of extra - solar planets will be discovered , and their detailed orbits determined ; tens of thousands of brown dwarfs and white dwarfs will be identified ; rare stages of stellar evolution will be quantified ; some 100000 extragalactic supernovae will be discovered , and details communicated for follow - up ground - based observations ; solar system studies will receive a massive impetus through the detection of many tens of thousands of new minor planets ; inner trojans and even new trans - neptunian objects , including plutinos , may be discovered .",
    "gaia will follow the bending of star light by the sun and major planets over the entire celestial sphere , and therefore directly observe the structure of space - time  the accuracy of its measurement of general relativistic light bending may reveal the long - sought scalar correction to its tensor form .",
    "the ppn parameters @xmath32 and @xmath33 , and the solar quadrupole moment j@xmath34 , will be determined with unprecedented precision .",
    "new constraints on the rate of change of the gravitational constant , @xmath35 , and on gravitational wave energy over a certain frequency range , will be obtained .",
    "gaia is timely as it complements other major space and ground initiatives .",
    "understanding and exploration of the early universe , through microwave background studies ( planck ) and direct observations of high - redshift galaxies ( ngst , first , alma ) , are complemented by theoretical advances in understanding the growth of structure from the early universe up to galaxy formation .",
    "serious further advances require a detailed understanding of a ` typical ' galaxy , to test the physics and assumptions in the models . our galaxy , a typical example of those luminous spirals which dominate the luminosity of the universe , uniquely provides such a template .    this summary of the gaia mission , as presented to and approved by the scientific advisory committees of the european space agency in september ",
