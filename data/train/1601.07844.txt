    "more than two decades have now elapsed since the discovery of the first exoplanet orbiting a main sequence star @xcite . over that time tremendous technological advances have been made , allowing the detection of earth - size and approximately earth - mass planets with both transits ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) or radial velocities ( rvs ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "nonetheless , hot jupiters remain the easiest planets to detect with both techniques , due to their large radii and masses and short orbital periods . the exoplanet orbit database @xcite lists more than 200 known hot jupiters ( @xmath11 days , @xmath12 ) as of january 2016 . expanding this sample",
    "will allow ever more fine - grained explorations of correlations among parameters for this class of planets ( mass , radius , orbital period , temperature , stellar properties , etc . ) , as well as the discovery of rare systems .",
    "a recent example of this latter class is the wasp-47 system , which is unique in having two small planets orbiting in close proximity to the hot jupiter @xcite .",
    "an expanded population of known hot jupiters , and the statistical explorations and further observations that this will enable , can help to answer a number of unsolved problems regarding hot jupiters .",
    "one such outstanding problem involves the origins of hot jupiters .",
    "ever since the discovery of the first hot jupiter , 51 peg b , it has been recognized that forming these planets _ in situ _ would be very difficult @xcite . a wide variety of mechanisms have been proposed to bring hot jupiters in from their formation locations outside the snow line to where they are observed today ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and a great deal of work has been devoted to determining which mechanisms actually produce hot jupiters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "despite this , the contributions of different migration mechanisms to the hot jupiter population , and even which is the dominant migration mechanism , is still a matter of debate .",
    "there have even been recent suggestions that some hot and warm jupiters ( i.e. , jovian planets with periods of greater than approximately 10 days but interior to the habitable zone  exact values depend upon the stellar parameters ) might form _ in situ _ rather than migrating from further out @xcite .",
    "the expansion of the population of hot jupiters , enabling more follow - up observations and the discovery of rare objects like wasp-47 , can help to solve this problem .",
    "the most prolific planet hunter to date is the _ kepler _ mission @xcite , which has produced thousands of planet candidates @xcite and hundreds of validated or confirmed planets ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "after the failure of a second reaction wheel , however , the _ kepler _ spacecraft was no longer able to keep pointing at the original _ kepler _ field , and was repurposed for the k2 extended mission @xcite . during this extended mission",
    "it is surveying a series of fields around the ecliptic ; each campaign ( observations of a specific field ) has a duration of @xmath13 days .",
    "k2 has already produced hundreds of planet candidates @xcite , but , like any other transit survey , further observations are typically needed to confirm or validate planet candidates as _ bona fide _ planets .",
    "this is particularly true for giant planet candidates , as this population suffers from high false positive rates @xcite .",
    "conversely , however , giant planet candidates are the easiest population to confirm with rv measurements of the stellar reflex motion due to the large rv semi - amplitude variations induced by the planets .    here",
    "we present k2 photometry for two late - type dwarf stars , epic 211089792 ( k2 - 29 ) and epic 210957318 ( k2 - 30 ) , for which we identified periodic transit signals , and our follow - up spectroscopic observations .",
    "these have allowed us to confirm both transiting objects as _ bona fide _ hot jupiters , and to measure the stellar and planetary parameters .",
    "observations for k2 campaign 4 began on 2015 february 7 ut and lasted until 2015 april 23 ut ; during these observations the boresight of the _ kepler _ spacecraft was pointed at coordinates of @xmath14 , @xmath15 .",
    "a total of 15,847 long cadence ( 30 minute integration time ) and 122 short cadence ( 1 minute integration time ) targets were observed .",
    "we utilized two different methods to produce light curves for all 15,969 targets from the k2 pixel data .",
    "the first technique followed the methodology outlined in @xcite .",
    "the k2 target pixel files were analyzed for stellar targets and a mask for each target was calculated . after light curve extraction ,",
    "disturbances produced by the drift of the telescope were corrected by calculating the rotation of the telescope s ccd .",
    "this drift is caused by the fact that the _ kepler _ spacecraft is now operating on only two reaction wheels , and is using the combination of carefully balanced solar radiation pressure and periodic thruster firings for stabilization about the third axis ; this results in a periodic rotation of the spacecraft about the axis of the telescope @xcite . in the second method ,",
    "the photometric time - series data extraction was based on circular apertures . for each target , we selected an optimal aperture size to minimize the noise in the light curve and estimated the background by calculating the median value of the stamp after excluding all bright pixels which might belong to potential sources .",
    "the resulting light curves were decorrelated using the movement of the centroid as described in @xcite .",
    "we also analyzed the light curves produced using their methodology , which are publicly available .",
    "we used aperture sizes of approximately 60 pixels to produce our own lightcurves , while the @xcite lightcurves utilize aperture sizes of 29 and 18 pixels for k2 - 29 and k2 - 30 , respectively .",
    "after extraction of the light curves , we searched for transit signals using the dst algorithm @xcite and the exotrans pipeline @xcite .",
    "dst and exotrans have been applied extensively to both _",
    "@xcite and _ kepler _ ( * ? ? ?",
    "* grziwa et al . 2016 , submitted ) data .",
    "all transit detection algorithms search for a pattern in the data and use a statistic to decide if a signal is present in the data or not . when compared to widely used algorithms like box least squares ( bls ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , dst uses an optimized transit shape , with the same number of free parameters as bls , and an optimized statistic for signal detection .",
    "exotrans uses a combination of the wavelet based filter technique varlet @xcite and bls .",
    "varlet was developed to reduce stellar variability and discontinuities in light curves .",
    "we identified periodic transit - like signals associated with two k2 campaign 4 targets , epic 211089792 and epic 210957318 ; both signals were detected in the lightcurves produced by all three methods , and using both dst and exotrans for transit detection .",
    "epic 211089792 was selected for k2 observations by program go4007 ( p.i .",
    "winn ) , while epic 210957318 was also proposed by program go4007 as well as programs go4020 ( p.i .",
    "stello ) and go4060 ( p.i .",
    "coughlin ) .",
    "for brevity we will hereafter refer to these targets as k2 - 29 and k2 - 30 , respectively .",
    "k2 - 29 was located on module 4 , channel 10 of the _ kepler _ focal plane , while k2 - 30 was located on module 20 , channel 71 .",
    "both targets passed all of the tests that we used to identify likely false positives ( including lack of odd - even transit depth variations , absence of a deep secondary eclipse , and lack of large photometric variations in phase with the candidate orbital period ) , and so we proceeded to more detailed fitting of the light curve as well as reconnaissance spectroscopy and then rv observations ( see  [ specobs ] for more on these latter points ) .",
    "we also searched for additional transit signals in the lightcurves of these stars , but none were found .",
    "the identifiers , magnitudes , colors , and proper motions of these stars are listed in table  [ magstable ] .",
    "k2 - 29 has a nearby star that is 4  northeast of the target and @xmath16 mag fainter , and whose flux contaminates the measured light curve .",
    "given that the aperture - mask that was used to extract the light curve is several times wider than the star - contaminator separation ( 1.0 pixels in the _ kepler _ plate scale ) , we estimated that the fraction of the psf from both target and contaminator that was included in the aperture mask is the same to within 20% .",
    "we therefore used the contaminator - to - target brightness ratio as an estimate of the fraction of contaminating flux in the target light curve , obtaining @xmath17 , and corrected the light curve accordingly .",
    "there are no sources close to k2 - 30 that could contaminate its light curve .    in order to fit the k2 photometry and extract the transit parameters",
    ", we used the ` exofast ` package @xcite to simultaneously fit the k2 photometry as extracted by @xcite and our radial velocity observations .",
    "we modified the original code to account for rv data - sets from different spectrographs .",

    "the trough - to - peak amplitude is @xmath96 .",
    "the overall shape of the light curve changes significantly over the course of the k2 observations , indicating the presence of spot evolution and/or differential rotation .",
    "we analyzed the rotational variability using the auto - correlation function ( acf ) of the light curve ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "using this methodology , we found a rotation period of @xmath6 days .",
    "periodogram analysis of the light curve gives a broadly consistent rotation period , although it also contains significant power at the first harmonic near 5.4 days .",

    "discrepancies between stellar ages inferred from isochrones and gyrochronology , however , are common for hot jupiter host stars ; these stars tend to rotate more quickly than expected given their isochrone ages and thus appear younger gyrochronologically ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "we also detected chromospheric emission in the cores of the ca  ii h and k lines ; the spectra are too noisy at these wavelengths to obtain a quantitative measurement of the emission level , however .",
    "the presence of significant stellar activity suggests that either the star is relatively young ( ages as young as 1.5 gyr are still within @xmath92 of the isochrone age , using the formal uncertainties ) , or that tidal spin - up has allowed it to remain active despite its age .    in order to further constrain the age we searched for li absorption , which is an indicator of youth ; gkm stars primordial li abundances are typically destroyed over the first few hundred myr of their lives ( see e.g. the review of * ? ? ?",
    "we did not detect any li absorption , and set a conservative upper limit of a(li)@xmath102 by fitting synthetic spectra to our stacked fies spectrum .",
    "our stacked harps - n spectrum is also consistent with this limit . using the results of @xcite , who measured li abundances in young open clusters ,",
    "we can easily rule out ages of @xmath103 myr for k2 - 29 .",
    "furthermore , we can likely rule out ages as great as @xmath104 myr ; the more metal - rich clusters at this age studied by @xcite show greater depletion , and for the clusters most similar in [ fe / h ] to k2 - 29 we would be able to detect the expected a(li ) level .",
    "k2 - 29 therefore likely has an age of @xmath105 myr , which would rule out the gyrochronological value of @xmath99 myr .",
    "we also sought to determine whether k2 - 29 could be a member of either of the young open clusters in the campaign 4 field of view , the hyades and pleiades .",
    "we computed the space velocities of the star using the ` gal_uvw ` idl routine , finding @xmath106 km s@xmath68 , @xmath107 km s@xmath68 , and @xmath108 km s@xmath68 . using eqn . 2 of @xcite and the cluster @xmath109 values presented in that work",
    ", we estimated that k2 - 29 has a 10% probability of being a member of the hyades supercluster , but only a 0.01% probability of belonging to the pleiades moving group .",
    "our calculated metallicity for k2 - 29 , @xmath10=0.00\\pm0.05 $ ] , is also lower than that of the hyades , which has @xmath10\\sim 0.15 $ ] @xcite .",
    "we thus conclude that k2 - 29 is unlikely to have originated as part of either the pleiades or the hyades .      in order to quantitatively",
    "assess the implications of the eccentric planetary orbit and the tidal spin - up of the host star for the past evolution of the system , we calculated the tidal timescales of the system using the model of @xcite .",
    "we assumed values for the tidal quality factors @xmath110 of the star and planet of @xmath111 and @xmath112 , respectively , and used our other measured parameters of the system .",
    "we found that the semi - major axis tidal interaction timescale is @xmath113^{-1}=1.77 $ ] gyr , and the eccentricity timescale is @xmath114^{-1}=0.027 $ ] gyr .",
    "these results indicate that the planet is indeed donating angular momentum to the star , and as a result its semi - major axis is shrinking .",
    "the timescale for the star s rotational evolution with these tides , however , is @xmath115 gyr , indicating that the planet could _",
    "_ n__ot have spun up the star through tides alone .",
    "the star s fast spin must therefore have been caused by another mechanism , for instance suppressed magnetic braking or the ingestion of another planetary body .",
    "a value of the eccentricity tidal interaction timescale of 0.027 gyr is much shorter than the age of the system , which has consequences for its past evolution . in general ,",
    "eccentric orbits of hot jupiters might be generated in two different manners : either the eccentricity is primordial , a relic of high - eccentricity migration that emplaced the planet on a short - period orbit , or the eccentricity is being excited by an external perturber .",
    "the short tidal eccentricity timescale suggests three possibilities for k2 - 29b : 1 ) it migrated recently via high - eccentricity migration ; 2 ) its eccentricity is currently being excited by a perturber ; or 3 ) we have underestimated the tidal quality factor of the planet and/or star , resulting in a much longer eccentricity timescale , in which case the planet could have migrated via high - eccentricity migration when the system was much younger .",
    "for instance , a value of @xmath116 would result in an eccentricity timescale of 2.24 gyr , consistent with the system age .",
    "all of these scenarios are testable with further data .",
    "if the orbital eccentricity of k2 - 29b is being excited by an external perturber , the presence of such a perturber could be detected through long - term radial velocity observations , or through transit timing variations ( ttvs ) .",
    "as only long cadence k2 data are available for k2 - 29 , and the @xmath117 days of k2 observations are insufficient to be sensitive to ttvs due to a much longer - period perturber , we do not pursue this line of investigation .",
    "future high - cadence transit observations could , however , be used to search for ttvs .",
    "high - eccentricity migration mechanisms include planet - planet scattering ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the kozai - lidov mechanism ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and coplanar high - eccentricity migration @xcite . planet - planet scattering and coplanar high - eccentricity migration are both expected to take place during the first tens to hundreds of myr of a system s lifetime , whereas kozai - lidov cycles can cause migration resulting in the emplacement of hot jupiters on short - period orbits even gyrs after the system formed @xcite .",
    "if k2 - 29b migrated recently , then it likely did so via the kozai - lidov mechanism , but if the tidal quality factor is higher than expected and it migrated early in the system s history , it could have done so via any of these mechanisms .",
    "further observations could help to distinguish between these mechanisms .",
    "all three mechanisms require the presence of an additional object in the system , which could be detected either through measurement of an rv trend , or high - resolution imaging to find a distant stellar companion which could induce kozai - lidov oscillations .",
    "measurement of the spin - orbit misalignment of k2 - 29b would also be useful on this front ; a misaligned orbit would point towards migration through either planet - planet scattering or kozai - lidov .",
    "our measured rotational period and calculated stellar radius predict an equatorial rotational velocity of @xmath118 km s@xmath68 .",
    "this deviates from the value of @xmath119 km s@xmath68 that we measured from our spectra by only @xmath120 , suggesting that the star is viewed close to equator - on .",
    "this also suggests that the spin - orbit misalignment might be small , although large spin - orbit misalignments can exist even for stars with @xmath121 .",
    "only direct measurement of the spin - orbit misalignment can solve this issue .",
    "the full and phase - folded light curves and the rvs for k2 - 30 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_7318 ] .",
    "a total of 16 transits were observed by k2 during campaign 4 .",
    "we removed clear outliers by visual inspection and excluded the 10@xmath122 transit from our analysis because of photometric discontinuities occurring immediately before and during the transit .",
    "we list the parameters for the star and planet in table  [ parstable ] .",
    "k2 - 30b is a @xmath123 planet with an orbital period of @xmath7 days .",
    "it has a radius of @xmath124 .",
    "we do not have sufficient rv data to constrain the planet s eccentricity , and so we fixed it to zero in our fits .",
    "the star has a slightly sub - solar metal content ( @xmath10=-0.15 \\pm 0.05 $ ] ) .",
    "a metallicity this low is unusual for a hot jupiter host , though by no means unprecedented ; there are currently hot jupiters known around stars with metallicities as low as @xmath10=-0.6 $ ] ( wasp-98 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    using isochrones , we found an age of @xmath125 gyr for k2 - 30 .",
    "no significant rotational modulation is evident in the k2 light curve ( top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig_7318 ] ) , and so we could not measure the rotation period and calculate the gyrochronological age for this star as we did for k2 - 29 .",
    "we also calculated the space velocity of k2 - 30 , finding @xmath126 km s@xmath68 , @xmath127 km s@xmath68 , and @xmath128 km s@xmath68 . again using the methodology of @xcite",
    ", we find that k2 - 30 s kinematics give it a 7% membership probability in the hyades supercluster , and an @xmath129% membership probability in the pleiades moving group .",
    "as is also the case for k2 - 29 , k2 - 30 s low metallicity is inconsistent with the bulk metallicity of the hyades , and so we conclude that k2 - 30 is also unlikely to have formed as part of either of these clusters .",
