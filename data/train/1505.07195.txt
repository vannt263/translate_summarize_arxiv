    "ultra - relativistic heavy ion collisions are the unique method to produce the deconfined medium experimentally on the earth @xcite .",
    "various observables are measured in the experiments @xcite to reveal properties of the deconfined medium and a variety of phenomena which come into play during the time evolution of the hot medium . among these observables ,",
    "the dilepton production yield has a characteristic feature that the yield provides us direct signals from the primordial deconfined medium @xcite , because dileptons once produced in the hot medium do not interact with and pass through the medium owing to their colorless nature .",
    "the dilepton yield observed experimentally consists of the sum of the dilepton production in each stage of the time evolution of the hot medium . the dilepton production in heavy ion collisions is roughly classified into three processes except for final state hadronic decays .",
    "the first one is the hard process , in which dileptons are produced by scatterings of hard partons in the colliding nuclei .",
    "the second and third ones are thermal radiations from the deconfined medium and confined medium , respectively .",
    "the dileptons in low invariant mass region are usually expected to be dominated by these thermal radiations , while dileptons from the hard process have relatively high transverse momenta and large invariant masses .",
    "experimental results on the dilepton production yield are usually compared with the baseline called cocktail , which is the production yield estimated from the observed hadron abundances and their branching ratios into a dilepton pair .",
    "if there is no dilepton production from hot medium , dilepton production yield should be consistent with the cocktail result .    at relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) at brookhaven national laboratory , @xmath4 pair production yield is measured by two collaborations , star and phenix @xcite .",
    "both of these collaborations reported that the pair production yield measured in au+au collisions at @xmath5 gev has significant enhancements in the low invariant mass ( @xmath6 ) region compared with the cocktail @xcite , although the descrepancy on the magnitude of the enhancement between the two experimental groups has not been settled down yet .",
    "the result of phenix collaboration shows that the yield at @xmath7 mev is about one order larger than the cocktail @xcite .",
    "when one performs an estimate of the dilepton production yield , one first calculates the dilepton production _ rate _ per unit time and unit volume from a static medium . the dilepton production _",
    "yield _ is then given by the space - time integral of the rate from each volume element of the medium .",
    "the dilepton production rate of a static medium is proportional to the imaginary part of virtual photon self - energy @xcite .",
    "when the temperature ( @xmath8 ) is asymptotically high , the photon self - energy can be calculated perturbatively .",
    "using the hard thermal loop ( htl ) resummed perturbation theory @xcite ,",
    "the dilepton production rate was calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite for lepton pairs with zero total three - momentum , and the result was extended in ref .",
    "@xcite to nonzero momentum .",
    "it is , however , nontrivial whether or not such perturbative analyses well describe the production rate from the deconfined medium near the critical temperature @xmath2 , which has turned out to be a strongly - coupled system @xcite .",
    "moreover , it is known that the perturbative analyses in refs .",
    "@xcite are modified by proper inclusion of higher - order terms @xcite .",
    "the analysis of higher order terms , however , is complicated and it is still under debate whether the scheme is valid for the whole kinetic region @xcite . for the description of the dilepton production rate in the deconfined phase near @xmath2 ,",
    "therefore , it is desirable to evaluate the rate without resort to perturbative methods .",
    "in particular , the large enhancement observed at phenix @xcite suggests a possibility that the dilepton production from the strongly - coupled medium above @xmath2 has a large enhancement compared with the perturbative results used in the previous analyses @xcite .",
    "there are several attempts of non - perturbative analyses for the dilepton production rate with lattice qcd @xcite .",
    "when one investigates the rate on the lattice one must take an analytic continuation from the imaginary - time correlator computable on the lattice to the real - time photon self - energy .",
    "this procedure , however , is an ill - posed problem , since the information on the imaginary - time correlators for discrete imaginary - time points obtained on the lattice is insufficient to reconstruct the continuous real - time function by itself @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , an ansatz for the spectral function is introduced to avoid this problem .",
    "an alternative way is to use the baysian analysis such as the maximum entropy method @xcite .",
    "the lattice correlator , however , is insensitive to the structure of the spectrum in the low energy region @xcite .",
    "the estimate of the low - energy spectrum on the lattice , therefore , is a difficult problem with the presently existing methodologies .",
    "the exact non - perturbative photon self - energy can be calculated by the schwinger - dyson equation ( sde ) if we have the full quark propagator and the photon - quark vertex function .",
    "recently , an analysis of the non - perturbative quark propagator above @xmath2 was performed on the lattice in the quenched approximation in landau gauge @xcite . in this series of analyses ,",
    "the quark propagator was analyzed with the two - pole ansatz for the real - time propagator in order to carry out the analytic continuation .",
    "this pole ansatz was employed motivated by the study of fermion propagator at nonzero temperature @xcite .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that this simple ansatz can reproduce the quark correlator obtained on the lattice over a rather wide range of bare quark mass and momentum .",
    "it is therefore expected that the obtained quark propagator well grasps the gist of the non - perturbative nature of the quark propagator .",
    "the purpose of the present study is to analyze the dilepton production rate using this quark propagator .",
    "we construct the sde with the quark propagators obtained on the lattice in ref .",
    "@xcite and with the vertex function constructed so as to satisfy the ward - takahashi identity ( wti ) .",
    "our formalism , therefore , fulfills the conservation law of electric current . in this analysis",
    ", we show that the obtained dilepton production rate exhibits an enhancement of one order or more compared with the one from the free quark gas . compared with the perturbative result in ref .",
    "@xcite , our result has a qualitatively similar behavior at low @xmath6 region , while it exhibits an enhancement around @xmath9 owing to van hove singularity .",
    "the effect of the vetex correction is also discussed in detail .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in the next section",
    "we introduce the sde for the photon self - energy and its components , lattice quark propagator and a veterx function satisfying the wti . in sec .",

    "first , in our two - pole ansatz the quark propagator for massless free quarks is obtained by setting @xmath158 equation  ( [ eq : full_rate ] ) thus should reproduce the photon self - energy of the free quark gas , when eq .",
    "( [ eq : zfree ] ) is substituted .",
    "this can be explicitly checked as follows . by substituting @xmath159 , all terms including @xmath160 vanishes .",
    "since @xmath161 for @xmath159 , the third and fourth lines in eq .",
    "( [ eq : full_rate ] ) cancel out with each other without constraints on @xmath58 . only the first term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : full_rate ] ) thus survives , which gives the free quark result .",
    "second , our result on the dilepton production rate approaches the free quark one in the large @xmath87 limit , because the lattice quark propagator used in this study reproduces eq .",
    "( [ eq : zfree ] ) at large momentum .",
    "this behavior will be explicitly checked in the next section .",
    "the result without vertex correction is also plotted .",
    "thin lines represent the htl and free quark results . ]",
    "now let us see the numerical results on the dilepton production rate obtained in the previous section . in fig .",
    "[ fig : two ] , we present the @xmath87 dependence of the dilepton production rate for @xmath0 . in the figure",
    ", we also plot the result without vertex correction , eq .",
    "( [ eq : novert ] ) , together with the rates obtained by the htl calculation @xcite and the free quark gas , eq .",
    "( [ eq : free ] ) .",
    "the value of the thermal mass @xmath63 is taken from the the result obtained on the lattice @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : two ] shows that the production rate with the lattice quark propagators has divergences at two energies , @xmath162 and @xmath163 . for @xmath164 , our result , as a whole , behaves similarly to the htl one @xcite , i.e. it increases as @xmath87 decreases , although our production rate is smaller than the perturbative one for small @xmath87 .",
    "near @xmath165 , however , it shows a prominent enhancement and exceeds the latter .",
    "the region , where the large production rate is obtained , is located around @xmath63 .",
    "therefore , it can be possible that the production yield obtained by integrating this rate has the large enhancement below several hundred mev , where the enhancement in the experimentally - observed dilepton spectra at rhic @xcite exists .",
    "the rate has a discontinuity at @xmath166 , and is significantly suppressed compared with eq .",
    "( [ eq : free ] ) for @xmath167 .",
    "the rate has another discontinuity at @xmath168 , above which the rate is close to the free quark one . in the dilepton rate without vertex correction ,",
    "one also finds two divergences at @xmath166 and @xmath169 , while the rate vanishes for @xmath167 .        in order to understand these results in more detail",
    ", we show the contribution of each term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : full_rate ] ) separately in fig .",
    "[ fig : three ] . in the figure ,",
    "the rate coming from the pair annihilation of two normal modes ( nn ) , two plasmino modes ( pp ) , and a normal and a plasmino modes ( np ) are separately shown , together with those of the landau damping between quasi - particles ( ld ) and processes including an @xmath138 mode with a normal ( ne ) and a plasmino ( pe ) modes . from the figure , one finds that the two divergences at @xmath166 and @xmath169 come from the ld and pp rates , respectively . as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : rate2 ] , these divergences come from van hove singularity .",
    "the photon self - energy eq .",
    "( [ eq : full_rate ] ) is inversely proportional to derivatives of the dispersion relations , @xmath170 and @xmath171 . as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : one ] and [ fig : add_disp ] , each of @xmath58 and @xmath125 has an extremum at nonzero @xmath56 .",
    "their values at the extrema are @xmath172 and @xmath173 . at these points",
    "the derivatives vanish .",
    "this leads to the divergences in the photon self - energy , and accordingly the dilepton production rate .",
    "figure  [ fig : three ] also shows that each indivisual process is nonvanishing in a limited range of @xmath87 .",
    "the range can be read off from the corresponding functions plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : add_disp ] .",
    "the nn and np rates are nonvanishing for @xmath123 . on the other hand ,",
    "the lower threshold of the pp rate , @xmath168 , is slightly lower than @xmath174 , because @xmath58 has a minimum smaller than @xmath63 at nonzero momentum .",
    "the range of the landau damping is also kinematically constrained to @xmath175 .",
    "the ne and pe rates are nonvanishing for @xmath176 and @xmath177 , respectively .",
    "the ne rate gives rise to a nonzero value for @xmath167 . to the dilepton pruduction rate without the vertex correction , only the nn ,",
    "pp , and ld contribute and the rate vanishes for @xmath167 .    for large @xmath87 ,",
    "the rate is dominated by the nn .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that the quark propagator approaces the free quark one as @xmath56 becomes larger .",
    "a glance at fig .  [ fig : three ] might give an impression that the ne rate also survives for large @xmath87 .",
    "although not shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : three ] , however , the np rate takes a negative value for @xmath178 , and this term almost cancels out with the ne rate ; see the discussion in sec .",
    "[ sec : rate3 ] .",
    "next , let us address the behavior of the production rate in the @xmath179 limit .",

    "the low energy behavior of @xmath181 is related to electric conductivity @xmath182 through the kubo formula ,",
    "@xmath183 our result shows that @xmath184 approaches zero faster than @xmath87 in the @xmath179 limit , and thus the electric conductivity vanishes .",
    "incorporation of the width of the quasi particle modes , which is not included in the form of the quark propagator used in this study , may lead to nonzero @xmath182 .",
    "deconfined phase . ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : five ] , we show the dilepton production rate at @xmath151 .",
    "one sees that the behavior is qualitatively the same as the result for @xmath0 .",
    "in particular , there exists an enhancement of the rate around @xmath185 owing to van hove singularity .",
    "this indicates that the large enhancement of the dilepton production rate around @xmath186 is a general result irrespective of @xmath8 .",
    "the gap between @xmath165 and @xmath169 is narrower than that at @xmath0 , because of the change of the dispersion relations @xmath55 obtained on the lattice .",
    "one also finds that the rate takes a finite value at @xmath144 , while it diverges for @xmath0 .",
    "this limiting behavior may depend on the way of the extrapolation of @xmath55 to large momentum .",
    "in this study we have investigated the dilepton production rate using a quark propagator obtained on the lattice with a pole ansatz . the schwinger - dyson equation for the photon self - energy",
    "is solved with the lattice quark propagator and the photon - quark vertex satisfying the ward - takahashi identity .",
    "the effect of the vertex correction is discussed by comparing the result with the calculation without vertex correction .",
    "our numerical result shows that the dilepton production rate with the lattice quark propagators is larger by about one order or more compared with that with the free quark ones in the low invariant mass region .",
    "compared with the htl result , there exists a significant enhancement around @xmath187 owing to van hove singularity .",
