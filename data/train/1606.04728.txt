    "engineered quantum systems have shown great potential in providing a spectrum of devices superior to the present state of the art in information technological applications .",
    "since quantum technological devices operate at the level of single energy quanta , they exhibit very low tolerance against external perturbations .",
    "consequently , they need to be extremely well isolated from all sources of dissipation during their quantum coherent operation .",
    "these properties typically lead to an elevated operation temperature and long natural initialization times . thus finding a versatile active refrigerator for quantum devices is of great importance .",
    "one of the greatest challenges of this century is to build a working large - scale quantum computer  @xcite . to date , a superconducting quantum computer  @xcite has reached the required gate and measurement accuracy thresholds for fault - tolerant quantum error correction  @xcite [ see also ref .   - ",
    "this device on the decade - long development of circuit quantum electrodynamics  @xcite ( cqed ) , i.e. , the study of superconducting quantum bits , qubits , coupled to on - chip microwave resonators  @xcite .",
    "although several methods have been demonstrated to initialize superconducting qubits and resonators  @xcite , the demanding requirements of efficient fault - tolerant quantum computing .",
    "thus cqed provides an ideal context for the demonstration of a quantum refrigerator .",
    "electronic microcoolers based on normal - metal  insulator  superconductor ( nis ) tunnel junctions  @xcite offer opportunities to cool electron systems well below the temperature of the phonon bath even at macroscopic sizes  @xcite . due to the ideally exponential tunability of the nis cooling and input powers using an applied bias voltage ,",
    "these tunnel junctions are attractive candidates for quantum refrigerators .",
    "although single - charge tunneling has previously been demonstrated to emit energy quanta even in applications such as the quantum cascade laser@xcite , and @xcite , it has not been experimentally utilized to directly cool engineered quantum circuits .",
    "even the recently demonstrated autonomous maxwell s demon has only been used to refrigerate dissipative electron systems  @xcite .",
    "the mode is evident from our qualitative observation that a distant probe resistor electrically coupled to the resonator cools down even if the temperature of the qcr , and of the other heat baths , is elevated ( shaded region in fig .",
    "[ fig2]a ) .",
    "this claim is reinforced by the absence of cooling in a control sample , in which the coupling between the probe and the microwave resonator is suppressed ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , b and c ) .",
    "furthermore , we obtain a good quantitative agreement between our theoretical model and the experimental results over a broad range of qcr operation voltages and bath temperatures ( figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] and  [ fig3 ] ) , providing firm evidence of our conclusions .",
    "figure  [ fig1]a  d shows the active sample where a qcr and a probe resistor are embedded near the opposite ends of a superconducting coplanar - waveguide resonator .",
    "the refrigerator involves a pair of nis junctions biased using an operation voltage @xmath0 .",
    "the probe resistor and the qcr are both equipped with an additional pair of current - biased nis junctions . using a calibration against the bath temperature  ( supplementary fig .  [ figs1 ] )",
    ", the observed voltage excursions across these thermometer junctions provide us independent measures of the electron temperatures of the qcr , @xmath1 , and of the probe resistor , @xmath2 .",
    "figure  [ fig1]e shows a control sample which has additional superconducting wires in parallel with the qcr and with the probe resistor to decouple these from the electric currents associated with the resonator modes with no other significant effects . thus the difference between the behaviour of the active sample and that of the control sample can be attributed to microwave photons in the resonator .    .",
    "figure  [ fig2]a shows the changes in the electron temperatures of the qcr and of the probe resistor as functions of the qcr operation voltage . since single electrons can not tunnel from the qcr into the superconductor unless they overcome the energy gap @xmath3  @xmath4ev in the superconductor density of states ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2]b ) , the electron temperatures stay essentially unchanged for operation voltages well below @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the elementary charge . slightly below the gap voltage @xmath5",
    "however , both electron temperatures are significantly decreased . here",
    ", the high - energy electrons at the qcr overcome the superconductor energy gap and tunnel out of the normal metal , thus evaporatively cooling it .",
    "typically , the observed temperature drop at the probe resistor would be simply explained by conduction of heat from it to the qcr .",
    "however , this explanation is excluded by our observation that at operation voltages slightly above the gap voltage , the electron temperature in the qcr is well elevated but the probe resistor remains cooled .    figure  [ fig2]b schematically shows different tunneling processes at the qcr with the operation voltage slightly exceeding the superconductor energy gap . here , the majority of the tunneling events take place near the edges of the gap where the density of states in the superconductor achieves its maximum value . because the elastic tunneling events , for which the electrons do not exchange energy with the resonator , dominate ( supplementary information ) , the normal metal mostly receives electrons above its fermi level and loses electrons below it . thus the qcr heats up .",
    "however , the electromagnetic mode of the resonator is not affected by elastic tunneling . instead , the mode cools down by the mechanism of photon - assisted tunneling  @xcite when it promotes a low - energy electron from the normal metal to the superconductor . on the other hand",
    ", the resonator mode heats up when receiving a photon during tunneling of a high - energy electron from the normal - metal to the superconductor .",
    "however , this tunneling rate is exponentially suppressed due to the low thermal occupation of high - energy electrons .",
    "thus the resonator mode cools down , resulting in the experimental observations shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2]a : reduced electron temperature at the probe resistor although the qcr temperature is elevated .",
    "note that the other essential heat baths for the probe electrons , composing of phonons in the solid and quasiparticle excitations in the superconductor , can not explain the observed cooling since they are heated by the operation of the qcr .",
    "the above - discussed observation is the most striking effect of the resonator acting as a structured electromagnetic environment for the tunneling process . in the supplementary information ,",
    "we discuss in detail how photon - assisted tunneling can be used for on - demand control of dissipation in the resonator      to analyze quantitatively the observed temperature changes in fig .",
    "[ fig2]a , we introduce a thermal model shown in fig .",
    "we theoretically model the photon - assisted tunneling using the so - called @xmath7 theory  @xcite for nis tunnel junctions  @xcite .",
    "the dominating energy flows into the conduction electrons of the probe resistor are obtained from their coupling to the substrate phonons and to the resonator .",
    "the coupling to the resonator arises from ohmic losses due to the electric current associated with the resonator photons  @xcite .",
    "similar ohmic the qcr , .",
    "in addition , we take into account a weak residual heating of the probe resistor due to the power dissipation at the qcr , a constant thermal conductance to an excess bath , and a constant heating photon leakage from the high - temperature stages of the cryostat .",
    "further details of the thermal model including the employed parameter values are given in supplementary information .",
    "for a given operation voltage and electron temperature at the qcr , we solve the temperatures of the probe resistor and the resonator from the thermal model ( supplementary information ) such that the different power flows in fig .",
    "[ fig2]c balance each other .",
    "the theoretical prediction for the probe temperature is in very good quantitative agreement with our experimental observations as demonstrated in fig .",
    "the figure also shows that a theoretical prediction lacking the contribution from photon - assisted tunneling is in clear with the measurements .",
    "this is a clear indication that the cooling power of the qcr originates from the direct absorption of resonator photons in the course of electron tunneling .",
    "figure  [ fig3]a shows the temperature change of the probe resistor in a broad range of cryostat bath temperatures , @xmath8 , and qcr operation voltages . a good quantitative agreement with the experimental data and",
    "the thermal model is obtained . for bath temperatures above 200  mk ,",
    "the qcr operation voltage has a very weak effect on the probe resistor .",
    "this loss of probe sensitivity is explained by the quartic temperature dependence of the thermal conductance between the probe electrons and phonons ( supplementary information ) .",
    "the greater this thermal conductance is , the less sensitive the probe is to the changes of the resonator temperature .",
    "figure  [ fig3]b shows results similar to those in fig .  [ fig3]a but obtained with the control sample , in which the ohmic losses at the qcr and the probe due to the resonator modes are suppressed ( fig .",
    "[ fig1]e ) .",
    "although residual heating is observed at high operation voltages , there is no evidence of refrigeration at the probe .",
    "thus the cooling of the probe in the active sample must arise from the qcr acting on the resonator . this conclusion is also supported by fig .",
    "[ fig3]c , where we show the maximum temperature drop of the probe for the two samples at various bath temperatures . here ,",
    "the control sample exhibits no cooling and the theoretical prediction is in very good agreement with the experimental observations .      to verify that the refrigerated resonator has a well - defined mode at the designed frequency , we introduce rf excitation to one of the input ports of the resonator as described in fig .",
    "although not necessary for the operation of the qcr , these ports are deliberately very weakly coupled to the mode , and hence there is essentially no transmission through the resonator .",
    "however , we study the resonance in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] by measuring the electron temperatures of the qcr and of the probe resistor as functions of the frequency and amplitude of the excitation .",
    "we observe a well - resolved resonance peak centered at @xmath9  ghz in agreement with the design parameters ( supplementary table  [ tab_s1 ] ) . at the lowest probe powers , the electron temperature and the absorbed power are linearly dependent .",
    "therefore , we can accurately extract the full width at half maximum , @xmath10  mhz , using a lorentzian fit to the electron temperature .",
    "the obtained quality factor of the resonance , @xmath11 , indicates that the resonator supports a well - defined mode .",
    "similar experiments on the control sample yield a quality factor of 572 indicating that as expected , ohmic losses dominate in the active sample .",
    "we attribute the observed losses in the control sample to residual ohmic coupling owing to the finite impedance of the shunt .",
    "that single - electron tunneling between a normal metal and a superconductor can be used to refrigerate a microwave resonator on demand . in the future",
    ", the refrigerator will be optimized for minimal ohmic losses .",
    "such a device can refrigerate a multitude of quantum circuits applications such as precise qubit initialization for large - scale , gate - based quantum computing , , and active enhancement of ground - state population in quantum annealing  @xcite . when inactive , the refrigerator is not expected to degrade the quantum coherence as desired . to decrease the base temperature achieved with the device",
    ", multiple refrigerators may be cascaded with each other  @xcite or with distant ohmic reservoirs at very low temperatures  @xcite .    in our experiments ,",
    "the relatively low quality factor of the resonator is a result of the chosen measurement scheme : rather strong dissipative coupling between the resonator photons and the probe resistor is needed to achieve conveniently measurable temperature changes at the probe resistor when the resonator is being refrigerated . in the future ,",
    "different probe schemes may be employed where such limitation is absent .",
    "these include amplification and analysis of the resonator output signal  @xcite and measurement of the resonator occupation using a superconducting qubit  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the ohmic losses due to the qcr may be overcome by minimizing its resistance and by moving it to the end of the resonator where the current profile of the resonator mode ideally vanishes .",
    "importantly , this does not reduce the cooling power of the qcr which utilizes the voltage profile . as discussed in more detail in the supplementary information , this type of straightforward improvements of the qcr for resonator quality factors in the range of 10@xmath12 when the qcr is inactive  @xcite . such level of dissipation low enough for the undisturbed operation of quantum devices in their known applications .",
