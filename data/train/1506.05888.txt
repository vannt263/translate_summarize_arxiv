    "a considerable number of stars in our and other galaxies are formed as a result of star formation triggered by the expansion of h@xmath0 regions .",
    "such expanding h@xmath0 regions have a great variety .",
    "they can appear as a result of rare energetic events like a supernova explosion producing huge superbubbles @xcite , rare energetic objects like wr stars or clusters of massive stars @xcite .",
    "these energetic objects attract the majority of effort in the field of triggered star formation . at the same time star formation",
    "can be efficient on the borders of the h@xmath0 regions formed by almost isolated massive stars @xcite .",
    "rather frequently triggered star formation is realized as a collapse of a pre - existing clump . in this process contraction of a pre - existing molecular clumps",
    "is initiated by the photoionization and shock fronts propagating away from the h@xmath0 region .",
    "bright rims are expected to appear at the sides of the clumps which face the ionizing star ( similar to those observed e.g. by @xcite ) .",
    "clear examples of the star formation due to compression of pre - existing dense condensations are found in ic  1396 , ic  1805 , sfo  79 star - forming regions @xcite .",
    "another type of triggered star formation is the  collect - and - collapse process , first proposed by @xcite . in this process",
    "massive ob - stars create an h@xmath0 region expanding into the ambient molecular cloud due to the presence of a pressure difference between the molecular and ionized gas .",
    "this expansion compresses ambient molecular material , consecutive fragmentation of which creates molecular clumps and filaments .",
    "these clumps are progenitors for the next generations of stars .",
    "the important aspect of this scenario is that there is a delay between the expansion of the h@xmath0 region and the onset of triggered star formation @xcite .",
    "this is different from the case of star formation by collapse of pre - existing clumps where the formation of the star starts almost immediately .",
    "clear examples of star formation by the ",
    "collect - and - collapse process in our galaxy can be found in s104 and s212 @xcite .",
    "@xcite investigated properties of the  collect - and - collapse process of star formation with a one - dimensional model of the shocked shell driven by expansion of the h@xmath0 region into a uniform medium .",
    "they concluded that resulting fragments are likely to have high mass ( @xmath3  @xmath4 ) .",
    "it was found that gravitational fragmentation of the shell takes place when the column density of hydrogen in the shell reaches @xmath5  @xmath6 .",
    "@xcite use the thee - dimensional smooth particle hydrodynamic ( sph ) model to test the applicability of the thin - shell approximation used in @xcite for more realistic astrophysical situation .",
    "they concluded that this approximation should be used with some caution because of the problem with the boundary conditions which greatly influence the fragmentation of the shell .    in this paper , we consider the border of an h@xmath0 region around an early - type star .",
    "it will be shown that there are signs of the considerable influence of this ionizing star on the ambient molecular cloud .",
    "this influence possibly results in triggering the formation of the next - generation star(s ) on the border of the s233 h@xmath0 region .",
    "the s233 region is a small ( @xmath7 in diameter ) optical emission nebula formed by the ionizing star usno - a2 1200 - 03588518 ( @xmath8 ) with visual magnitude @xmath9 .",
    "the s233 region is a part of s231 - 235 star formation complex .",
    "this complex is located in the perseus spiral arm and contains four developed h@xmath0 regions : s231 , s232 , s233 , and s235 @xcite .",
    "published distance estimates to the objects in this complex vary from 1.6 to 2.3 kpc @xcite .",
    "the s233 region is mentioned in the review of @xcite , which states that the s233 h@xmath0 region is excited by a b1.5  ii star @xcite . in the present study we conducted a spectroscopic analysis of the ionizing star using high - resolution spectroscopic data and",
    "have shown that it is a main sequence star of the b0.5 spectral type with mass of @xmath10  @xmath4 .",
    "@xcite studied co(1 - 0 ) molecular line emission toward the iras sources beyond the solar circle .",
    "they distinguished two separate components of the co(1 - 0 ) line toward iras 05351 + 3549 situated within the optical s233 emission .",
    "our newly obtained data enable us to investigate the spatial structure of these co components .",
    "the main gas component of co emission ( @xmath11 at @xmath12 ) has a large - scale spatial extension , but the second component ( @xmath13 at @xmath14 ) is a rather compact clump of gas situated close to the infrared source iras 05351 + 3549 .",
    "for our study of molecular gas in the vicinity of the s233 region , we used information on emission in four spectral lines of the co molecule : @xmath15co(1 - 0 ) , @xmath15co(2 - 1 ) and the lines of isotopologue @xmath16co(1 - 0 ) and @xmath16co(2 - 1 ) .",
    "these lines are known to be an efficient probe of morphology and physical parameters of molecular gas .",
    "the maps of the @xmath15co(2 - 1 ) and @xmath16co(2 - 1 ) spectral lines were obtained with the 10-meter heinrich hertz submillimeter telescope ( smt ) , a facility of the arizona radio observatory .",
    "the maps include a @xmath17 region centered at @xmath18 , @xmath19 which covers more than @xmath20 around the vicinity of the s233 region .",
    "observations were obtained in january 2010 .",
    "the whole map consists of subfields with @xmath21 size .",
    "each subfield was mapped using the on - the - fly mode of the smt telescope .",
    "the beam size was 32 for the @xmath15co(2 - 1 ) and 33.5 for the @xmath16co(2 - 1 ) .",
    "observed frequencies were 230.53800  ghz for the @xmath15co(2 - 1 ) and 220.39868  ghz for the @xmath16co(2 - 1 ) lines , respectively .",
    "the main beam efficiency was 0.81 for the @xmath15co line and 0.78 for the @xmath16co line .",
    "the observations were made with a 10  angular spacing , which was at least three times smaller than the beam size .",
    "this allows avoiding sudden changes in intensity from pixel to pixel and positively affects the accuracy of determination of physical parameters in the molecular cloud .",
    "the spectral resolution was 0.325 @xmath22 for the @xmath15co(2 - 1 ) line and 0.340 @xmath22 for the @xmath16co(2 - 1 ) line .",
    "achieved rms noise levels were 0.23  k and 0.21  k for the @xmath15co(2 - 1 ) and @xmath16co(2 - 1 ) lines , respectively .    the @xmath15co(1 - 0 ) and @xmath16co(1 - 0 ) spectral lines were mapped using the 13.7-meter fcrao radio telescope with the 32-pixel sequoia focal plane array receiver . the s231-s235 complex was mapped in january 2000 .",
    "the map of each isotope line includes a @xmath23 region based on the galactic coordinate system , centered at @xmath24 , @xmath25 ( @xmath26 , @xmath27 ) .",
    "the main beam sizes were 45  and 47  for the @xmath15co(1 - 0 ) and @xmath16co(1 - 0 ) lines , respectively .",
    "observed frequencies were 115.27120  ghz and 110.20135  ghz for the @xmath15co(1 - 0 ) and @xmath16co(1 - 0 ) lines , respectively .",
    "the pixel spacing was 22.5 and the velocity channel spacings were 0.127 @xmath22 and 0.133 @xmath22 for the @xmath15co(1 - 0 ) and @xmath16co(1 - 0 ) lines , respectively .",
    "achieved rms noise levels were 1.1  k and 0.63  k for the @xmath15co(1 - 0 ) and @xmath16co(1 - 0 ) lines , respectively .",
    "the main beam efficiencies for the and lines were 0.45 and 0.48 , respectively .",
    "these efficiencies applied if the source of emission was approximately the same size as the main beam . however , if the emission is widely distributed on scales of  @xmath28 or more , it fills the error beam of the fcrao telescope , and in such a case one need to apply scattering efficiency of 0.7 for both lines . given the large range of angular sizes of the structures in s233 complex neither main beam nor scattering efficiencies will give good calibration . to calibrate the fcrao co(1 - 0 ) data we used a deconvolution method described in @xcite to remove a @xmath28 error beam component and then we used main beam efficiencies .",
    "the deconvolution method involves a division of fourier transform of source data by fourier transform of the error beam .",
    "correction for the error beam improves the calibration of the line intensities by 10 - 30 percent .",
    "we used the miriad software package @xcite for manipulating data cubes and the karma package @xcite for visualization . in this paper , we have extracted a @xmath21 region centered at the position of the ionizing star in the s233 region with coordinates @xmath29 , @xmath30 . because the data for different transitions was obtained with different receivers , we have applied some corrections to the original data for comparing line profiles observed with different telescopes .",
    "these corrections include the convolution of all data cubes to the same beam size of fwhm@xmath31 . for the @xmath16co ( 1 - 0 ) line",
    "this is the original beam size , thus no changes were made to this data cube , but for the @xmath15co ( 2 - 1 ) and @xmath16co ( 2 - 1 ) lines the original beam size is 32 and 33.5 , respectively .",
    "thus to achieve 47 beam size we convolved these line maps with @xmath32 and @xmath33 gaussians , respectively .",
    "for investigating the spatial - kinematic structure of molecular cloud the corrections are not necessary .",
    "the observations were obtained in january 2012 with the echelle - spectrograph mounted on the special astrophysical observatory ( sao ) 6-m telescope @xcite .",
    "the detector of the echelle - spectrograph was a large size @xmath34-pixel ccd array with an image slicer .",
    "we used a setup yielding a resolving power of r = 50000 , with a spectral coverage of 4000 - 7000  .",
    "a hollow cathode th - ar lamp was used for the wavelength calibration .",
    "we have obtained 6 spectra with a 45 minutes exposure time for each spectrum .",
    "initial inspections showed no significant velocity variation in this sample .",
    "thus , all spectra were combined to improve the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) and a master spectrum was created for subsequent analyses .",
    "the initial steps of the data reduction process ( removal of cosmic ray features , background subtraction , and spectral order extraction ) were done under the echelle context of midas software package @xcite , while the final steps ( i.e. , continuum normalization , radial velocity and equivalent widths ( ew ) measurements ) were performed using the package dech20 @xcite .",
    "the snr of the reduced spectra depends on wavelength , and is about 60 and 30 in h@xmath35 ( 6563  ) and h@xmath36 ( 4861  ) regions , respectively .          as noted in section  [ sec : intro ] the s233 ionizing star was classified as b1.5  ii by @xcite .",
    "we classified this star as b0.5  v by comparing our smoothed and degraded to r = 4000 spectrum with the corresponding part of the digital atlas of @xcite ( see figure  [ fig : s233_spectra ] ) .",
    "degradation was performed using the gnu data language routine ` rebin.pro ' . the main criteria to estimate the spectral type of the ionizing star were approximate equality of the strengths of the si iii 4552 and si iv 4089 lines and the presence of the very weak he ii 4686 line @xcite .",
    "the ratio of si iii 4552 and he i 4837 lines was the primary criterion to estimate the luminosity class .",
    "it seems that the modest disagreement in the spectral classification is likely due to differences in the resolution and perhaps snr , together with some degree of subjective judgment in the comparison by eye with standard spectra .    to confirm the spectral classification we also performed the spectroscopic analysis using stellar atmosphere models from the bstar2006 grid with the solar metallicity and microturbulent velocity of @xmath37 km  s@xmath38 @xcite .",
    "the steps of the effective temperature @xmath39 and surface gravity ( log@xmath40 ) in the grid are 1000  k and 0.25  dex , respectively .    at the first step of the spectral analysis the projected rotational velocity @xmath41",
    "was obtained by comparing observed line profiles of helium and metal lines with synthetic ones .",
    "synthetic profiles were computed with the values of @xmath39 = 29000  k and log@xmath42  dex which correspond to a b0.5  v star @xcite .",
    "the comparison was performed by eye using synthetic spectra calculated by the rotin3 program ( provided with synspec @xcite ) for three @xmath41 values : 10 , 20 and 30 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "the relatively large step of 10 km  s@xmath2 allows to easily determine how well the observed spectrum is fitted by a synthetic spectrum .",
    "spectra with @xmath43  km  s@xmath2 and @xmath44  km  s@xmath2 gave a very poor fit .",
    "the resulting value of @xmath41 and its standard deviation are 13  km  s@xmath2 and 5  km  s@xmath2 , respectively .    at the second step of the spectral analysis the observed spectrum",
    "was compared with a number of synthetic spectra computed using bstar2006 grid for different values of @xmath39 and log@xmath40 .",
    "we compared observed profiles of si iii @xmath454552 , 4567 , 4574 , 4716 , 4813 , 4819 , 4829 , 5740 and si iv @xmath454089 , 4116 , 4631 and cores and wings of balmer lines ( h@xmath35 , h@xmath46 , h@xmath36 , h@xmath47 ) . to characterize",
    "how well the observed profiles are fitted by model spectra we used the quantity @xmath48",
    "@xmath49    where @xmath50 is the number of wavelength points in the spectral line @xmath51 , @xmath52 is the number of spectral lines used in the analysis , @xmath53 is the observed flux in the @xmath54-th point of the spectral line @xmath51 , @xmath55 is the synthetic flux , @xmath56 is a weight which corresponds to the spectral line @xmath51 , and @xmath57 accounts for the signal - to - noise ratio of the spectral line @xmath51 . for all lines except si iv",
    "@xmath584089 a value of weights equals to 1.0 were used . for the si iv @xmath584089 line we used a weight of 0.5 because it was blended with the oii line .",
    "the minimization of @xmath48 provides the maximum likelihood estimate of the model parameters , @xmath59 and log@xmath40 . in our case the model with @xmath60  k and log@xmath42 exhibit the minimum of @xmath48 .",
    "these model parameters were used to evaluate silicon and helium abundances based on the curve - of - growth method ( see , for example , @xcite ) . in this method the abundance and @xmath61 for a given @xmath59 and log@xmath40 are varied while the same abundance is not obtained for all lines .",
    "we used a grid of synthetic spectra for various abundances and @xmath61 values that were computed with the code synspec48 @xcite .",
    "the number densities of si in the grid are @xmath62 dex where @xmath63 is the solar abundance @xcite .",
    "the he / h values are varied from 0.05 to 0.15 with 0.025 step . using a linear interpolation on the grid with @xmath64 km  s@xmath2",
    "we have obtained the log(si / h)-ew diagram that is shown in figure  [ siabund ] .",
    "the log(si / h)-ew dependence was approximated by the straight line that is shown as solid line in figure  [ siabund ] .",
    "the linear approximation of log(si / h)-ew is given by @xmath65 , where after a ` @xmath66 '  sign standard errors are given .",
    "it should be noted that si iii @xmath454813 , 4819 , 4829 lines were excluded from the si abundance analysis because this triplet tends to give different results .",
    "this discrepancy could be related to the problems of a si model atom ( see e.g. @xcite ) . using the similar diagram",
    ", we also obtained the helium abundance @xmath67 .",
    "km  s@xmath2 .",
    "the solid line represents the linear regression fit .",
    "uncertainties in the individual line abundances ( propagated from the standard deviations in the measured ews ) are indicated as error bars .",
    "because si iv @xmath584089 line was blended with the oii line , second to last point has large uncertainty .",
    ", width=317 ]    at the final step of spectral analysis we obtained a @xmath48 distribution for @xmath64 km  s@xmath2 and @xmath68 .",
    "this distribution is shown in figure  [ khi_distr ] . according to this distribution",
    ", we selected all models with a @xmath48 below the critical value . the critical value is a minimal @xmath48 value for models on the edge of the grid .",
    "the resulting values of @xmath69 k and log@xmath70 dex are obtained by averaging selected models , weighted by @xmath71 , and their standard deviations .",
    "a comparison of our derived parameters with the calibration of @xcite enables us to suggest that the s233 ionizing star is a b0.5  v star .",
    "the he abundance also indicates that most likely this star is still on the main sequence .",
    "we estimated the mass of the s233 ionizing star to be @xmath72 by interpolating the stellar evolutionary tracks of @xcite in the log@xmath40-@xmath59 plane ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) and using the monte - carlo error propagation .",
    "an estimate of the age is much more uncertain with the standard deviation equal to the value itself : @xmath73 yr .",
    "nonetheless , one may say that the star is rather young and spent about @xmath74 of its lifetime on the main sequence .    to estimate the distance to the ionizing star we used the k - band magnitude",
    "@xmath75 obtained from 2mass , absolute magnitude @xmath76 @xcite and interstellar absorption @xmath77 according to the reddening law of @xcite and @xmath78 estimated by @xcite .",
    "the estimated distance @xmath79 kpc is in agreement with published distances to the s231 - 235 complex .",
    "for example , @xcite estimated the distance to the s233 region as @xmath80 kpc .",
    "the range of the effective temperature of the ionizing star ( @xmath81  k ) limits the range of the number of ionizing photons @xmath82 , to between 47.0 to 47.34 .",
    "this range is obtained by linear extrapolation of values on @xmath39 in table 4 of @xcite .",
    "@xcite give two estimates of the number of ionizing photons : @xmath83 and @xmath84 , the values are estimated from radio continuum and h@xmath35 observations , respectively .",
    "however , we note that they adopted a distance to s233 of 4.7 kpc .",
    "if we adopt the distance of 2.3  kpc , then the values of the number of ionizing photons should be scaled by @xmath85 .",
    "this gives @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "the value @xmath87 is almost equal to the lower estimate of the number of ionizing photons with the stellar parameters obtained by us .",
    "this indicates that the ionizing star has a sufficient lyman continuum flux to account for the observed h@xmath35 intensity and the radio flux density of the s233  h@xmath0 region .",
    "most likely estimation of the number of ionizing photons for the s233 h@xmath0 region is @xmath88 .",
    "difference between the observed spectrum and spectra computed with @xmath64 km  s@xmath2 and @xmath68 .",
    "abundances of other chemical elements are solar .",
    "the @xmath48 values are quantified by shades of grey .",
    "the cross marks the position of the model with minimum value of @xmath48.,width=317 ]      the radial velocities were measured for 150 absorption lines using dech20 .",
    "the radial velocities were obtained interactively with a mirroring method @xcite , i.e by means of the best match of the line profile with its mirror .",
    "rest wavelengths for each line were taken from vald @xcite .",
    "the derived radial velocity of the s233 ionizing star is @xmath1 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "this velocity is consistent with the velocity of the surrounding molecular cloud ( from @xmath8915 to @xmath8920 km  s@xmath2 ) , thus the physical association with this molecular cloud may be assumed .",
    "there are also the nebular lines in the echelle - spectrum of the ionizing star . using [ sii ] @xmath456716 , 6731 and [ nii ] @xmath456548 , 6583 lines we estimated the radial velocity @xmath90 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "because the nebular lines are used , the derived velocity represents the ionized gas in the s233 region .    analyzing the velocities of the star , ionized and molecular gas ,",
    "we conclude that the ionizing star is moving together with the parent molecular cloud , but the ionization front is moving slower in the direction to the observer with a velocity of @xmath91  km  s@xmath2 with respect to the ionizing star .",
    "this value indicates the expansion velocity of the s233 h@xmath0 region .",
    "the s233 region is seen as an optical h@xmath0 region . in the dss red image",
    "the optical nebula exhibits almost a spherical morphology ( see figure  [ ukidss ] ) which is typically found in h@xmath0 regions .",
    "the dss red image traces primarily ionized gas . the ionized region does not have a clear edge at the north - east while there is a clear edge seen in the south - west side .",
    "the dss red image also shows condensation at the west of the central ionizing star .",
    "this condensation is also seen in near - ir and mid - ir images ( see section  [ mid_ir ] and [ near_ir ] ) .",
    "the condensation is also detectable in the dss blue image , which can not be explained as emission directly of the interstellar dust .",
    "if we assume the emission is the reflected light of the central ionizing star , the condensation detected in the dss blue image supports that the region is physically associated with the ionizing star .",
    "figure [ wise ] shows the mid - ir images of the s233 region .",
    "these images were obtained from the all - sky data release @xcite of the wide - field infrared survey explorer ( wise ) at 4.6 , 12 and 24 .",
    "the images reveal the existence of diffuse nebulosity to the south - west of the ionizing star .",
    "the main contribution to the emission at 12 comes from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) in a photodissociation region ( pdr ) .",
    "usually a pdr appears as a relatively thin region of mid - ir emission along the periphery of an h@xmath0 region , where pah is excited enough to glow , but not to be destroyed by uv - radiation    in our case we do not see a sharp boundary of the pah emission of the s233 h@xmath0 region .",
    "this could be due to projection effects together with the non - uniform distribution of the ambient material .",
    "if we overlay the dss red image with the wise 12 image ( see figures  [ wise ] and  [ ukidss ] ) , we find that the optical emission of the ionized gas overlaps with the pah emission recognized in the 12 image . in the case of uniform distribution of material around a spherically expanding h@xmath0 region",
    ", the bright pah emission should surround the ionized gas . in the present case the pah emission overlaps with the optical emission of the ionized gas , which could be due to projection effects .",
    "this comparison suggests that the h@xmath0 region interacts with the ambient material on the far side from the observer , so the region of the pah emission is relatively extended .",
    "therefore , the conclusion is that the ambient material is denser in the south - west region : this situation is consistent with the cometary - like structure of the ionized hydrogen region , seen in red optical images .",
    "the nebulosity contains a number of condensations , which are labeled on the figure  [ wise ] as s1 , s2 and s3 .",
    "the bright point source below s1 is likely a foreground star as it coincides with a star seen in the optical image , identified as usno - a2 1200 - 03587620 and 2mass source 05382867 + 3550388 with a magnitude 12.5 in the k band .    in figure  [ wise ] , we see the emission of the ionizing star at 24 . in order to check whether this emission is spatially separated from the nearest infrared peak s1",
    ", we obtained images with a higher spatial resolution using the hires technique @xcite .",
    "the resulting hires image of the s233 region shows a clear separation between the s1 condensation and the ionizing star emission .",
    "the s1 condensation is also seen in the dss blue band image as it reflects the light of the ionizing star . from this fact",
    "we can conclude that s1 is physically associated with the ionizing star in the s233 region ( see section [ sec : optical ] )      the ukidss survey @xcite is the next generation near - infrared sky survey , the successor to 2mass .",
    "the survey instrument is @xcite mounted on the uk infrared telescope ( ukirt ) in hawaii .",
    "the high resolution of ( 0.4 ) gives a high quality images of the particular regions of the sky .",
    "the s233 region lies in the area covered by the galactic plane survey ( gps ) of ukidss .",
    "figure  [ ukidss ] shows the image in the k band along with the optical images .",
    "it is clearly seen that in the s233 region there are well - pronounced structures having forms of bright rims elongated perpendicular to the ionizing star . within these rim structures the condensations s1 , s2 and s3",
    "are pronounced .",
    "the fine structure of these condensations is clearly seen in this image .",
    "the s1 condensation has a brightness gradient , revealing the brightest part on the ionizing star side and the darker part in the opposite side .",
    "a number of molecular clouds associated with similar structures and condensations were studied by @xcite .",
    "finally , the iras source 05351 + 3549 is located in the vicinity of the s233 region .",
    "the angular separation between the iras source 05351 + 3549 and the s1 condensation , discussed in section  [ mid_ir ] , is 17 .",
    "taking into account the uncertainty of the iras source position ( major radius of the error ellipse is 31 ) , we assume that the iras source 05351 + 3549 is associated with the s1 peak seen in the mid - ir images of wise and near - ir images of ukidss .",
    "this iras source has the following flux densities : @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 .",
    "it is notable that the flux density increases as the wavelength increases .",
    "the colours ( according to definition of @xcite ) of iras 05351 + 3549 are @xmath96-[25]=4.12 $ ] , @xmath97-[60]=4.89 $ ] .",
    "these colours correspond to those of a young stellar object in the colour - colour diagram given by @xcite .",
    "one may notice that iras 05351 + 3549 is marked an extended source in the iras catalog .",
    "this extension is probably due to the association of another infrared source with the s1 clump .",
    "moreover , the central ionizing star , which is located close to the s1 peak ( @xmath98 ) , emits radiation at mid - ir wavelength and falls into the ellipse of iras source position error .",
    "the angular resolution of the iras image is not sufficient to resolve the s1 peak and the ionizing star and to construct their reasonable spectral energy distributions . but",
