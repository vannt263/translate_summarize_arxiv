    "at a distance of @xmath6  mpc ( freeman  1977 ) the circinus galaxy is one of the nearest seyfertii galaxies that hosts an extragalactic h@xmath0o maser .",
    "the @xmath7 erg s@xmath8 ( 2 - 10 kev ) central engine is obscured at energies below 10 kev by a large gas column , n@xmath9 @xmath10 ( matt  1999 ) .",
    "veilleux & bland - hawthorn ( 1997 ) observed linear optical filaments and compact knots in the ionization cone , which opens by at least @xmath11 at a mean position angle ( pa ) of roughly @xmath12 .",
    "the agn also drives a kpc - scale nuclear outflow that creates bipolar radio lobes at pa @xmath13 ( elmouttie  1998 ) , largely along the rotation axis of a nuclear @xmath14co ring ( curran  1998 ) .",
    "there is good evidence that extragalactic h@xmath0o masers in ngc4258 and ngc1068 trace edge - on accretion disks bound by central engines @xmath15 m@xmath2 .",
    "discovery of maser emission in circinus more or less symmetrically bracketting the systemic velocity led to speculation that these masers also trace an accretion disk ( greenhill  1997 ) .",
    "though the detection of an accretion disk reported here confirms that prediction , the additional discovery of qualitatively new , nondisk emission introduces a fresh element in modeling the agn dynamics .",
    "we observed the circinus h@xmath0o maser three times in 1997 ( june & july ) and 1998 ( june ) with four stations of the atnf long baseline array .",
    "we used a spectral - channel separation of 0.21   over 437  in 1997 and 553  in 1998 , centered on the known emission .",
    "we calibrated the data with standard vlbi techniques and estimated a new astrometric position for the 565  line ( where we adopt the radio astronomical definition of doppler shift ) by analyzing the time variation in fringe rate .",
    "the new position , @xmath16 , @xmath17 is the best estimate so far of the agn .",
    "we calibrated tropospheric path - length fluctuations by self - calibrating the @xmath18  emission and achieved 0.025 - 0.045 jy noise ( @xmath19 ) in the deconvolved synthesis images , depending on the epoch .",
    "we fitted a 2-d gaussian model brightness distribution to each spot stronger than @xmath20 .",
    "because spectral lines come and go from epoch to epoch , we superposed the maps for all epochs , so as to trace the underlying dense molecular gas as completely as possible with the available data ( figure1 ) .",
    "at each epoch , the sky distribution of maser emission comprises three populations : ( 1 ) a thin , gently curved , s - shaped locus of highly redshifted and blueshifted emission arcs to the southwest and northeast , respectively ( aka `` high - velocity '' emission ) , ( 2 ) emission close to the nominal systemic velocity of the galaxy that lies between the high - velocity arcs ( aka `` low - velocity '' emission ) , and ( 3 ) modestly doppler shifted emission broadly distributed in knots that lie north and west ( redshifted ) and south and east ( blueshifted ) of the low - velocity emission . in 1998 detectable emission lay between 215  and 677 .",
    "we have fitted a model edge - on disk with smoothly varying position angle as a function of radius ( figure1 ) .",
    "the observed disk inner and outer radii are @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively ( 0.1 - 0.4 pc ) .",
    "the peak orbital speed is 237 , and the mass enclosed with 0.1 pc is @xmath23 m@xmath2 , for circular motion and a 451  model systemic velocity . among the redshifted high - velocity masers , the peak rotation velocity as a function of impact parameter from the dynamical center , @xmath24 , traces a rotation curve that declines as approximately @xmath25 ( figure2 ) .",
    "we infer a disk mass on the order of @xmath3 m@xmath2 between 0.1 and 0.4 pc .",
    "the inner disk is edge - on , but if it is inclined toward the outer radius , then the disk mass is larger .",
    "an estimate of the toomre q - parameter ( @xmath26 ) suggests that self - gravity in the disk is important , which is consistent with apparent clumpy substructure in the distribution of disk emission .",
    "the disk model derives its strongest support from the following observations : ( 1 ) the angular distribution of high - velocity masers is highly elongated , roughly symmetric , and perpendicular to the approximate axis of the known ionization cone , ( 2 ) the apparent rotation curve is nearly keplerian , ( 3 ) the innermost red and blue - shifted emission and the low - velocity emission are colinear in position and position - velocity space .",
    "the latter item indicates the low - velocity emission lies close to the inner radius of the disk .",
    "outflow is traced by emission between 300 and 450 , south and east of the dynamical center of the disk , and by emission between 450 and 580 , north and west of the dynamical center .",
    "the distribution of masers on the sky suggests a wide - angle flow , and the segregation of red and blueshifted emission suggests an inclined flow . because h@xmath0o maser emission requires @xmath27 @xmath28 , the masers probably represent high - density `` bullets '' immersed in a thinner , photoionized medium , equivalent to a narrow - line region .",
    "however , the opacity of that region probably obscures all but the nearside of the flow , and if the disk is inclined toward its outer radius , then ionization along the disk surface probably obscures one side of the flow preferentially .",
    "the outflow appears to arise in the vicinity of the central engine ( @xmath4 pc ) rather than from the `` maser - disk '' by magneto - centrifugal processes ( emmering  1992 ; kartje , knigl , & elitzur 1999 ) .",
    "notably , rotation is absent from the line - of - sight velocity and position data , even for masers quite close to the disk ( i.e. , height / radius @xmath29 ) .",
    "though the outflow could originate in a `` hot '' disk that lies within the ( warm ) molecular maser - disk , the physical conditions that support maser emission are consistent with adiabatic expansion of agn broad line clouds , i.e. , @xmath30 - 10@xmath14 @xmath28 and of @xmath31 k ( brotherton  1994 ) .",
    "the disk structure disappears at a radius of @xmath5 pc ( figures1 & 2 ) , perhaps because the wind disrupts the accretion disk , whose mean surface density presumably declines with increasing radius .",
    "the existence of an outer radius is supported circumstantially by two observations .",
    "first , outflow - borne masers all lie at the edge of or outside the shadow cast by the truncated disk .",
    "( we assume that the maser excitation depends on irradiation and heating of molecular gas by hard x - rays , as in neufeld , maloney , & conger ( 1994 ) ) .",
    "second , the position angles at which the outflow is free of occultation by the truncated disk coincide with the limits of the kiloparsec scale ionization cone observed west of the nucleus ( veilleux & bland - hawthorne 1997 ) .",
    "for example , the southern edges of the redshifted maser outflow and the ionization cone , both lie at position angles of @xmath32 . in addition",
    ", we note that the mean axis of the maser outflow , @xmath33 , corresponds well to the orientation of the dominant [ oiii ] filament , @xmath34 and a radio hotspot ( elmouttie  1998 ) ."
