    "in contrast to the edge states of the integer quantum hall phase and/or in inverted band 2d topological insulators the edge states induced by the edge soc are , in general , not protected against disorder .",
    "this is so because although scattering from one edge state to the other is forbidden by time reversal symmetry , backscattering can occur through the bulk - like states which , in general , coexist with the edge states in the same energy range .",

    "the soc strength must be such that the total energy of the edge states , @xmath80 , becomes smaller than @xmath6 , i.e. , the condition @xmath81 must be satisfied .",

    "as long as the inequality @xmath104 holds , there are no qualitative differences to the case @xmath105 .",
    "the only effect is the reduction of the @xmath73-domain in which edge states do not exist [ i.e. , the white zones in fig .",
    "[ fig : phases](a ) are reduced when increasing @xmath106 .",
    "this is because as @xmath107 increases , the energy branches corresponding to the counterpropagating edge states tend to match each other at the zone center .",

    "protected edge and surface states are known to appear in systems with strong atomic soc in which a band inversion drives the system into a topological insulator phase.@xcite the mechanism proposed in this work does not rely on band inversion but rather on the use of the edge soc .",
    "it represents a new alternative for the creation of protected helical edge states that could be relevant for engineering new types of topological insulators .",
    "unfortunately , although the model presented here provides a qualitative description of the formation of such states , it is difficult at the present stage to predict which materials should be combined for the condition in eq .",
    "( [ ti - condi ] ) to be fulfilled and the protected helical states to appear .",
    "this is so because the parameter characterizing the strength of the edge soc ( @xmath22 or its dimensionless version , @xmath86 ) is not precisely known for much systems . in general , the value of @xmath22 must be extracted from first - principles calculations or deduced from experiments .",
