    "in these lectures , i propose to discuss the application of symplectic numerical methods @xcite to the investigation of cosmological singularities . for a system",
    "whose evolution can be described by a hamiltonian , the symplectic approach splits the hamiltonian into kinetic and potential subhamiltonians .",
    "if the subhamiltonians are exactly solvable , these solutions can be used to evolve the system from one time to the next .",
    "fortunately , an appropriate choice of variables in the standard @xmath4 hamiltonian formulation of general relativity enables einstein s equations to be derived from a hamiltonian appropriate for the symplectic algorithm ( sa ) .",
    "so far , the primary application of sa to general relativity has been to determine the asymptotic singularity behavior of cosmological models ( but see also @xcite ) .",
    "the sa is well - suited to this problem because it becomes exact if the asymptotic behavior is asymptotically velocity term dominated ( avtd)i.e .",
    "the kinetic subhamiltonian asymptotically determines the dynamics .    to study the application of sa to general relativity , we shall consider a sequence of models whose variables depend on 0 , 1 , and 2 spatial dimensions .",
    "the first case we shall consider is the spatially homogeneous mixmaster universe .",
    "( for convenience , we shall consider only the diagonal bianchi ix vacuum model . )",
    "einstein s equations can be obtained by variation of the hamitonian @xmath5 where @xmath6 here @xmath7 is the logarithm of the cosmological scale factor and measures isotropic expansion , while @xmath8 measure orthogonal anisotropic shears with @xmath9 and @xmath10 respectively canonically conjugate to @xmath11 and @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "the potential @xmath12 is proportional to the spatial scalar curvature ( @xmath13 ) and is shown in fig .",
    "[ mixtraj ] .",
    "( [ mixh0 ] ) is itself the hamiltonian constraint @xmath14 .",
    "the properties of this model have been known ( more or less ) since the late sixties @xcite .",
    "the first three terms in @xmath12 describe triangular walls .",
    "as the model evolves toward the singularity at @xmath15 , the walls become exponentially steep . within the walls ,",
    "the system behaves almost as a free particle ( @xmath16 ) . in the approach to the singularity ,",
    "@xmath11 itself may be used as the time variable . as @xmath17 ,",
    "a fixed value of @xmath12 , say @xmath18 , moves outward in the @xmath8-plane at a speed @xmath19 that of the system point @xcite .",
    "thus the system evolves with an infinite sequence of bounces off the potential . a typical trajectory is shown in fig .  1 .",
    "while there is no exact solution , each straight line segment can be parametrized and a map ( the bkl map ) derived to link one segment to the next @xcite .",
    "there is a long history of numerical simulations @xcite , @xcite trying to assess the validity of the bkl map as a descriptor of the dynamics .",
    "part of this interest can be traced to the fact that a bounce which leaves one of the @xmath20 corners of the potential to move to another corner exhibits the sensitivity to initial conditions usually associated with chaos . whether or not mixmaster dynamics is chaotic",
    "remains a topic for both analytic and numerical study @xcite .",
    "we note that with @xmath21 , the solution is that of kasner @xcite . a solution which is asymptotically kasner is avtd .",
    "the mixmaster solution is the antithesis of avtd since there is ( presumably ) no last bounce .",
    "the effect of the spatial derivatives that generate @xmath12 , though almost absent during each kasner epoch , always recurs .",
    "our remaining examples are spatially inhomogeneous cosmologies ( still vacuum for convenience ) . long ago , bkl conjectured that the singularity in spatially inhomogeneous cosmologies is locally of the mixmaster type @xcite .",
    "analytic verification of the bkl conjecture has bogged down on the issue of setting up the local mixmaster behavior in a global way . for this reason",
    ", a numerical approach may be useful .",
    "while our second model s plane symmetry precludes local asymptotic mixmaster dynamics , it does serve as an excellent laboratory for the sa . the gowdy model on @xmath2",
    "is described by the metric @xcite @xmath22\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 are functions of @xmath26 , @xmath27 .",

    "if we assume @xmath24 and @xmath25 to be small , we find them to be respectively the amplitudes of the @xmath30 and @xmath31 polarizations of the gravitational waves with @xmath23 describing the background in which they propagate .",
    "the time variable @xmath27 measures the area in the symmetry plane with @xmath32 a curvature singularity .",
    "einstein s equations split into two groups .",
    "the first is nonlinearly coupled wave equations for @xmath24 and @xmath25 ( where @xmath33 ) : @xmath34 the second contains the hamiltonian and @xmath26-momentum constraints which can be expressed as first order equations for @xmath23 in terms of @xmath24 and @xmath25 : @xmath35=0,\\ ] ] @xmath36 this break into dynamical and constraint equations removes two of the most problematical areas of numerical relativity from this model : ( 1 ) the normally difficult initial value problem becomes trivial since @xmath24 , @xmath25 and their first time derivatives may be specified arbitrarily ( as long as the total @xmath26 momentum in the waves vanishes ) .",
    "( 2 ) the constraints , while guaranteed to be preserved in an analytic evolution by the bianchi identities , are not automatically preserved in a numerical evolution with einstein s equations in differenced form .",
    "however , in the gowdy model , the constraints are trivial since @xmath23 may be constructed from the numerically determined @xmath24 and @xmath25 . for the special case of the polarized gowdy model ( @xmath37 ) , @xmath24 satisfies a linear wave equation whose exact solution is well - known @xcite . for this case",
    ", it has been proven that the singularity is avtd @xcite .",
    "this has also been conjectured to be true for generic gowdy models @xcite .",
    "we shall show in section 4 how the sa applied to this model provides strong support for this conjecture .",
    "our final model generalizes the plane symmetry to a u(1 ) symmetry @xcite .",
    "the details of this model will be given in section 5 .",
    "@xmath3 models allow local mixmaster dynamics and thus can be used to test the bkl conjecture .",
    "in fact , it is possible that any type of allowed cosmological singularity will already appear in the @xmath3 models .",
    "the extension of the gowdy sa methods to the @xmath3 case is straightforward .",
    "consider the time evolution of a set of variables @xmath38 from @xmath39 to @xmath40 .",
    "we can define an evolution operator @xmath41 such that if f @xmath42 is infinitesimal , then @xmath43 must have the form @xmath44 but @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the poisson bracket with @xmath47 the hamiltonian .",
    "thus @xmath48 with the empty slot in the operator to act on @xmath38 . in the standard way ( by dividing @xmath49 into @xmath50 intervals and applying @xmath51 @xmath50 times ) we obtain the exponentiated form ( for finite @xmath49 ) @xmath52 suppose @xmath53 . then @xmath54 .",

    "one evolves @xmath38 from @xmath57 to @xmath58 by first evolving with @xmath59 from @xmath57 to @xmath60 , taking that result and evolving with @xmath61 from @xmath57 to @xmath58 , and , finally , evolving that result with @xmath62 from @xmath60 to @xmath58 .",
    "suzuki has shown how to obtain a representation of @xmath43 to arbitrary order @xcite .",
    "for example , @xmath63{\\cal u}_{(2)}(s\\delta t)\\ ] ] where @xmath64 . in general , @xmath65{\\cal u}_{(2m-2)}(s_m\\delta t)\\ ] ] where @xmath66 . as a concrete example , consider the hamiltonian @xmath67 where @xmath68 is an arbitrary potential . note that both @xmath69 and @xmath70 yield exact solutions . for @xmath69 , @xmath71 while for @xmath70 , @xmath72 since @xmath73 is constant for the hamiltonian @xmath70 , the solution for @xmath74 is exact no matter how complicated the potential @xmath68 .",
    "thus the exact solutions ( [ h1soln1dof ] ) and ( [ h2soln1dof ] ) are used to evolve from @xmath57 to @xmath58 according to the prescription @xmath75 . to go to higher order , nothing new is required .",
    "the time intervals are selected according to the prescription ( [ evopmth ] ) , but the same exact solution is used .",
    "extension to fields @xmath76 , @xmath77 is straightforward . with computation in mind , define @xmath78 , etc .  where @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "then the exact solutions are for @xmath69 @xmath81 and for @xmath70 @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the appropriate functional derivative .",
    "again , the exact solution exists for @xmath70 no matter how complicated the potential .",
    "of course , one must represent the spatial derivative @xmath84 as accurately as possible .    to represent spatial derivatives to the desired order , evaluate ( e.g.  in 1d ) the taylor series for an arbitrary function @xmath85 .",
    "say the 4th order accurate expression for @xmath86 is desired .",
    "demand that @xmath87&+&a_2\\left [ { f(x+2\\varepsilon ) + f(x-2\\varepsilon ) } \\right]\\nonumber \\\\    & = & { { d^2f } \\over { dx^2}}\\varepsilon ^2+o(\\varepsilon ^6).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we find @xmath88 , @xmath89 .",
    "a similar procedure can be used for any term in the taylor expansion .",
    "it can also be extended to two spatial dimensions where the same coefficients are found .",
    "extension to higher order requires @xmath90 for some @xmath91 ( depending on order ) .",
    "the only remaining issue in the evaluation of @xmath92 is whether to vary @xmath68 analytically and then difference the variation or difference @xmath68 and then vary the differenced form .",
    "we have chosen the latter .",
    "( for complicated @xmath68 , the two are equivalent only to some order . ) as a simple example , again consider @xmath93 to arise from the variation of @xmath94 . since the hamiltonian for this case is @xmath95\\kern 1pt\\,dx}$ ] , the differenced form is ( for 2nd order accuracy ) @xmath96 ( the negative of ) the variation with respect to @xmath97 ( which appears in two terms of the sum ) yields the standard differenced second derivative @xmath98 .",
    "although i have done several computational projects with the mixmaster model , ( see references in @xcite ) , none of these have used the sa . here",
    "we shall use mixmaster primarily as an application of sa rather than to evaluate mixmaster parameters or to compute lyapunov exponents @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ mixh0 ] ) clearly is in the correct form with @xmath99 and @xmath100 having obvious exact solutions .",
    "( the variables chosen are not the only ones that have been used .",
    "for example , the adm reduction can be performed by choosing @xmath11 to be the time variable and solving the hamiltonian constraint ( [ mixh0 ] ) , @xmath14 , for @xmath9 .",
    "the remaining degrees of freedom for @xmath8 are dynamical .",
    "since the constraint is automatically preserved , one might argue that this choice is better .",
    "however , the ability to monitor @xmath47 as an indicator of the accuracy and stability of the solution outweighs the disadvantage of the extra degree of freedom . )    there is actually some debate over the optimal choice of ode solver ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . the choice will involve trade - offs between accuracy and computer time .",
    "accuracy is especially important for models with sensitivity to initial conditions since a small numerical error could qualitatively change the solution .",
    "( sensitivity to initial conditions means that an arbitrarily small change in initial data can generate qualitatively different trajectories .",
    "numerical error could simulate change in initial conditions . ) here we shall consider only comparisons between a 4th order runge - kutta algorithm ( rka ) @xcite and 4th and 6th order sa s . in all cases ,",
    "the same initial data set ( freely specify @xmath11 , @xmath8 , and @xmath10 and solve @xmath14 for @xmath9 ) is run for up to 2000 time steps .",
    "an adaptive step size algorithm has been borrowed from @xcite for use in all these codes . a modification to limit the maximum step size",
    "is required to avoid seriously over - running a mixmaster wall .",
    "when this eventually occurred anyway , the computation was stopped .",
    "[ savsrk ] displays the results for the three codes at a single mixmaster bounce .",
    "note that the 4th order sa and rka have similar performance while the 6th order sa equally well represents the solution with many fewer time steps .",
    "the 6th order sa easily reached @xmath101 , more than two orders of magnitude greater than rka in essentially the same number of steps .",
    "the much larger time step possible with the 6th order sa easily overcomes tje extra computational time needed to take a 6th order step as three 4th order ones .",
    "it is only now that sa s are being applied to the study of mixmaster @xcite and related models @xcite .",

    "implementation of the sa is completely straightforward .",

    "while the bianchi identities guarantee the preservation of the constraints by the einstein evolution equations , there is no such guarantee for differenced evolution equations . at this stage of the project , we monitor the maximum value of the constraints vs @xmath27 over the spatial grid but do nothing else to try to stay on the constraint hypersurface .    the third difficulty , and the one that is proving to be the greatest obstacle , is instability associated with spatial differencing in two dimensions . the differencing algorithm of section 2 for sixth order accurate expressions ( based on second order ones ) is used",
    "the difficulties we encounter are apparently common to nonlinear equations in two or more dimensions . in an attempt to control the instability ,",

    "<S> a primary unresolved issue for cosmological singularities is whether or not their behavior is locally of the mixmaster type ( as conjectured by belinskii , khalatnikov , and lifshitz ( bkl ) ) . </S>",

    "<S> a multiple of the spatial scalar curvature acts as a closed potential leading , in the evolution toward the singularity ( say @xmath0 ) , to an ( almost certainly ) infinite sequence of bounces whose parameters exhibit the sensitivity to initial conditions usually associated with chaos . </S>",

    "<S> , we shall consider application of the method to three models of increasing complexity . </S>",
    "<S> the first application is to spatially homogeneous ( vacuum ) mixmaster cosmologies where we compare the symplectic ode solver to a runge - kutta one . </S>",
    "<S> the second application is to the ( plane symmetric , vacuum ) gowdy universe on @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamical degrees of freedom satisfy nonlinearly coupled pde s in one spatial dimension and time . </S>",

    "<S> the gowdy code is easily generalized to this model , although , the spatial differencing needed in the symplectic method is not trivial.for avtd models , we expect the potential - like term in the hamiltonian constraint to vanish as @xmath1 while in local mixmaster it becomes ( locally ) large from time to time . </S>",
