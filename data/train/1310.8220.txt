    "citations of scientific papers are considered to be an indicator of papers importance and relevance , and a simple count of the number of citations a paper receives is often used as a gauge of its impact .",
    "however , it is also widely believed that citations are affected by factors besides pure scientific content , including the journal a paper appears in , author name recognition , and social effects  @xcite .",
    "one substantial and well - documented effect is the so - called cumulative advantage or preferential attachment bias , under which papers that have received many citations in the past are expected to receive more in future , independent of content .",
    "a simple mathematical model of this effect was proposed by price  @xcite , building on earlier work by yule  @xcite and simon  @xcite , in which paper content is ignored completely and citation is determined solely by preferential attachment plus stochastic effects . within this model , the expected number of citations a paper receives is a function only of its date of publication , measured from the start of the topic or body of literature in which the paper falls , and shows a strong `` first - mover effect '' under which the first - published papers are expected to receive many more citations on average than those that come after them .",
    "indeed the variation in citation number as a function of publication date is normally far wider than the stochastic variation among papers published at the same time . in a previous paper  @xcite",
    "we compared the predictions of price s model against citation data for papers from several fields and found good agreement in some , though not all , cases .",
    "this suggests that pure citation numbers may not be a good indicator of paper impact , since much of their variation can be predicted from publication dates , without reference to paper content .    instead , therefore , we proposed an alternative measure of impact .",
    "we proposed that rather than looking for papers with high total citation counts , we should look for papers with counts higher than expected given their date of publication .",
    "since publication date is measured from the start of a field or topic , and since different topics have different start dates , one should only use this method to compare papers within topics .",
    "the appropriate calculation is to count the citations a paper has received and compare that figure to the counts for other papers on the same topic that were published around the same time . in our work we used a simple @xmath0-score to perform the comparison : we calculate the mean number of citations and its standard deviation for papers published in a window close to the date of a paper of interest , then calculate the number of standard deviations by which that paper s citation count differs from the mean . papers with high @xmath0-scores we conjecture to be of particular interest within the field .",
    "one promising feature of this approach is that the papers it highlights are not necessarily those with the largest numbers of citations .",
    "the most highly cited papers are almost always the earliest in a field , in part because of the first - mover effect but also because they have had longer to accumulate citations .",
    "more recent papers usually have fewer citations , but they may still have high @xmath0-scores if the count of their citations significantly exceeds the average among their peers .",
    "thus the method allows us to identify papers that may not yet have received much attention but will do so ( we conjecture ) in the future .    in our previous study , we used this method to identify some specific papers that we believed would later turn out to have high impact .",
    "here we revisit those predictions to see whether the papers identified have indeed been successful . to quantify success",
    ", we look again at citation counts , and to minimize the preferential attachment bias we compare them against randomly drawn control groups of papers that had the same numbers of citations at the time of the original study . as we show , our predictions appear to be borne out : the papers previously identified as potential future successes have received substantially more attention than their peers over the intervening years .",
    "in this section we briefly review some of the results from our previous paper  @xcite , which we will refer to as paper  1 .",
    "in paper  1 we examined citation data from several different fields in physics and biology , but made specific predictions for one field in particular , the field of interdisciplinary physics known as network science .",
    "this field is an attractive one for study because it has a clear beginning  a clear date before which there was essentially no published work on the topic within the physics literature ( although there was plenty of work in other fields)and a clear beginning is crucial for the theory developed in the paper to be correct and applicable .",
    "( it is also the present author s primary field of research , which was another reason for choosing it . )",
    "it is again on papers within network science that we focus here .    in paper  1",
    "we assembled a data set of 2407 papers on network science published over a ten year period , starting with the recognized first publications in 1998 and continuing until 2008 .",
    "the data set consisted of papers in physics and related areas that cited one or more of five highly - cited early works in the field  @xcite , but excluding review articles and book chapters ( for which citation patterns are distinctly different from those of research articles ) .",
    "we then calculated the mean and standard deviation of the number of citations received by those papers as a function of their time of publication within a moving window .",
    "crucially , however , our theoretical studies indicate that `` time '' in this context is most correctly defined not in terms of real time , but in terms of number of papers published within the field .",
    "if @xmath1 papers have been published in the field in total ( with @xmath2 in this case ) , then the `` time ''  @xmath3 of publication of the @xmath4th paper is defined to be @xmath5 , where papers are numbered in the order of their publication .",
    "thus @xmath3 runs from a lowest value of @xmath6 for the first paper in the field to @xmath7 for the most recent paper .",
    "it is in terms of this variable that we perform our averages .",
    "armed with these results , we then calculate a @xmath0-score for each paper as described in the introduction : we take the count of citations received by a paper , subtract the mean for papers published around the same time , and divide by the standard deviation .",
    "figure  [ fig : outliers ] reproduces a plot from paper  1 of @xmath0-scores for papers in the data set . only @xmath0-scores that exceed  2 are shown , since these are the ones we are most interested in , corresponding to papers whose citation counts are significantly above the mean for their peers .",
    "as the figure shows , there are within this set a small number of papers that stand out as having particularly high @xmath0-scores .",
    "our suggestion was that these were papers to watch , that even if they did not currently have a large number of citations , they would in future attract significant attention .",
    "table  [ tab : winners ] lists twenty of the top papers by this measure from our 2008 data set along with their citation counts and @xmath0-scores  @xcite .",
    "-scores for citations to papers in the data set of ref .",
    "each @xmath0-score is equal to the number of standard deviations by which the citations to the corresponding paper exceed the mean for papers published around the same time . only @xmath0-scores greater than two ( the dashed line ) are plotted . as described in the text , the `` time '' in the horizontal axis",
    "is measured by the number of papers published , not real time . ]    [ cols=\"<,<,<,>,>,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     looking at the papers in these 100 sets , we now find the number of new citations each received in the last five years , the difference between their citation counts in 2013 and 2008 . calculating the median new citations for each set",
    ", we find the average figure over all sets to be @xmath8 , a much lower number  by a factor of  15than the median of 238 measured for the fifty leaders from our analysis . alternatively , as before",
    ", we can compute the ratio of new to old citations , again taking a median for each set , and we find an average figure of @xmath9 , not very different from the @xmath10 we found for the entire data set ( perhaps suggesting that our assumption of linear preferential attachment was a reasonable one ) . as reported above , the equivalent figure for the set of fifty leading papers was more than twice the size , at  5.24 .    by these measures",
    "it appears that the predictions of paper  1 are quite successful .",
    "papers identified using our method outperformed by a wide margin both the field at large and randomly drawn control groups that started out with the same number of citations .",
    "encouraged by these results and capitalizing on the fact that we have a new data set of papers and their citations up to the year 2013 , we now apply our methods to the new data to make predictions about papers that will be highly cited in the next few years .    working with the entirety of our new 6976-paper data set",
    ", we again calculate the mean and standard deviation of the numbers of citations received as a function of time and look for the papers with the highest @xmath0-scores  those that exceed the mean for their publication date by the largest number of standard deviations .",
    "table  [ tab : newwinners ] is the equivalent of table  [ tab : winners ] for this new analysis , listing twenty of the papers with the highest @xmath0-scores within the field of network science .",
    "a few observations are worth making .",
    "first , note that the numbers of citations received by these papers are substantially greater than those received by the papers in table  [ tab : winners ] at the time of our first round of predictions .",
    "all but one of them have over 100 citations already , putting them in the top few percent of the data set .",
    "this is probably in part a sign of the rapid growth of the field mentioned earlier .",
    "a more rapid rate of publication means more citations are being made , and hence more received , particularly by the most prominent papers .",
    "it s worth emphasizing , however , that each of the papers in the table earned its place by receiving significantly more citations , by many standard deviations , than other papers in the same field published around the same time .",
    "so the citation counts are not merely high , but anomalously so .",
    "moreover , the @xmath0-scores in table  [ tab : newwinners ] are significantly higher than those in table  [ tab : winners ] , so the margin by which the top papers outperform expectations has also grown .",
    "second , we note that while some of the papers in the list would be unsurprising to those familiar with the field of network science , such as the influential early papers by watts and strogatz  @xcite and by barabsi and albert  @xcite , there are also some more recent papers listed , such as the papers by buldyrev  _ et  al . _",
    "@xcite on interdependent networks or liu  _ et  al . _",
    "@xcite on controllability , which received two of the highest @xmath0-scores in the table .",
    "our analysis suggests that these papers will have an outsize impact a few years down the road , relative to what one would expect given only their current numbers of citations .",
    "third , we notice the abundance in the list of papers published in the journal _ nature _ , and to a lesser extent _ science _ and _ proceedings of the national academy of sciences_. the publication venues of the papers in our old list , table  [ tab : winners ] , were more diverse",
    ". the predominance of these journals could just be coincidence ",
    "the sample size of 20 is small enough to make such a thing plausible .",
    "but it is also possible that it is a real effect .",
    "perhaps these journals have over the last few years established a special name for themselves as attractive venues for publication of work in this particular field . or perhaps there has been a deliberate change in editorial policy that has resulted more papers in the field being accepted for publication in these journals .",
    "alternatively , these journals may have pulled ahead of their competition in the accuracy of their peer review , so that they are better able to identify ( and hence publish ) papers that will be important in the field . or it may be that papers in these high - profile journals tend to be cited more than papers in other journals because they are more visible , and hence they are more likely to appear in our table . or the truth might be a combination of all of these factors , and perhaps some others as well .",
    "in this paper we have revisited predictions made in 2008 of scientific papers in the field of network science that , according to those predictions , should receive above average numbers of citations , even though they may not yet have had many citations at that time .",
    "looking at those predictions five years on , we find that the papers in question have indeed received many more citations than the average paper in the field .",
    "indeed they have received substantially more even than comparable control groups of randomly selected papers that were equally well cited in 2008 .",
    "because of the so - called preferential attachment effect , one can quite easily identify papers that will do well just by looking for ones that have done well in the past .",
    "but the papers identified by our analysis did well even when one controls for this effect , indicating that the analysis is capable of identifying papers that will be successful not merely because they already have many citations .",
    "we hope , though we can not prove , that the additional factors driving this success are factors connected with paper quality , such as originality and importance of research and quality of presentation .",
    "we have also applied our methods to contemporary data , from 2013 , to make a new round of predictions , identifying papers that , according to the metrics we have developed , are expected to see above average citation in the next few years , when compared to other papers that currently have the same number of citations .",
    "it will be interesting to see whether these predictions in turn come true .",
    "we have been slightly selective about the papers listed in the table .",
    "the actual top  20 papers included a number written by the present author , most of which we omitted from the list out of modesty .",
    "the table lists the twenty papers with the highest @xmath0-scores among those that remain",
    ". the full list of highest - scoring papers , including those written by yours truly , can be found online at ` http://www.umich.edu/~mejn/citation ` ."
