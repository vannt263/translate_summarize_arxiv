    "massive stars have a profound affect on their natal environment .",
    "they have strong ionizing radiation fields which create hii regions , and their powerful winds sweep up surrounding material creating wind - blown shells and cavities .",
    "their supernovae ( sne ) chemically enrich the interstellar medium ( ism ) and help to sustain turbulence within it .",
    "thus the presence of massive stars in stellar clusters has implications for future generations of star formation .",
    "the dispersal and destruction of molecular material by the winds and ionzing radiation may inhibit further star formation within that region .",
    "conversely , compression of material by winds and shocks may also trigger new star formation @xcite and new cluster formation @xcite .",
    "many high - mass star - forming regions are observed to contain diffuse thermal x - ray emission , which requires high temperature plasma .",
    "it has long been recognized that the fast winds of individual massive stars create high pressure and high temperature bubbles ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in large clusters containing many early - type stars",
    "the individual stellar winds may combine , collectively creating a so - called cluster wind ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in many cases",
    "the observed diffuse emission from massive - star forming regions ( msfrs ) is relatively soft .",
    "for instance , in m17 and the rosette nebula the characteristic temperature @xmath7kev @xcite .",
    "the x - ray emitting plasma in the extended orion nebula is similarly cool @xcite .",
    "however , in other msfrs the characteristic temperature is considerably higher .",
    "for instance , the diffuse thermal x - ray emission from ngc3603 @xcite , the core of the arches cluster @xcite , and the quintuplet cluster @xcite has @xmath8kev .",
    "in some clusters the diffuse x - ray emission may be predominantly non - thermal : e.g. ngc6334 @xcite , rcw38 @xcite , the arches cluster @xcite and on2 @xcite .",
    "this requires non - thermal particles , which also occur when high speed flows and strong shocks are present .",
    "@xcite argue that the non - thermal emission detected from the ngc3576  ob  association may arise from both a pulsar wind nebula and a cavity supernova .",
    "a caveat to some of these works is that the diffuse x - ray emission from clusters which are at larger distances is more likely to suffer contributions from unresolved point sources .",
    "a summary of x - ray studies of young stellar clusters is presented by @xcite .",
    "early studies indicated that the detection of diffuse x - ray emission in stellar clusters required the presence of stars earlier than o6 @xcite , although an exception , the o7-powered hourglass nebula @xcite , was known . @xcite",
    "have since discovered diffuse x - ray emission from ngc2024 ( the flame nebula ) , which contains only late o- to early b - type stars . on the other hand ,",
    "it is curious that diffuse x - ray emission has yet to be detected from some very massive stellar clusters where very early o - type stars are present , such as trumpler16 @xcite .",
    "other work has indicated that the temperature of the diffuse plasma may be correlated with how embedded it is , as measured by the column density @xcite",
    ". clusters with high temperature plasma appear to have @xmath9 , while clusters with cooler plasma have less absorption .",
    "@xcite suggest that while the stellar winds are bottled up the shocked gas remains maximally heated , but subsequent leakage and the resulting adiabatic cooling of the gas causes the gas temperature to drop .",
    "unfortunately , past comparisons of x - ray observations with theory have had mixed success .",
    "many works on msfrs simply compare the observed x - ray luminosity against the mechanical wind power of the stars , or the thermal energy of the plasma against an estimate of the time - integrated energy input of the winds ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the efficiency of the conversion of mechanical energy to radiation is then found to range from @xmath10 to 0.1 .",
    "this , and the estimated mass of the x - ray emitting gas , indicates that in many cases the winds are not completely confined and that hot plasma must flow into the wider environment .",
    "this conclusion is reinforced by the fact that the application of completely confined wind - blown - bubble models often leads to a significant overprediction of the x - ray luminosity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "other works have compared the x - ray luminosity and the surface brightness profile of the diffuse emission to the predictions of cluster - wind models . in their analysis of the arches and quintuplet clusters",
    ", @xcite found that the radial intensity profiles of the diffuse emission were more extended than theoretical predictions .",
    "@xcite recently determined that the observed diffuse x - ray emission from the carina nebula was 60 times too faint compared to predictions from the @xcite model , and 10 times too luminous compared to the @xcite model .",
    "this led @xcite to develop a third model whereby density variations in the ism surrounding the cluster causes gaps in the swept - up shell , through which some of the high pressure gas in the bubble interior can leak .",
    "their new model predicts a lower pressure within the bubble than the @xcite model , as the wind material is not completely confined , and also a lower x - ray luminosity .",
    "consequently , it is more consistent with observations .",
    "however , since the covering fraction of the shell is a free parameter this model suffers from a lack of predictive power .    in young msfrs",
    "in which there has not yet been time for any massive star to explode as a supernova , the diffuse x - ray emission must result from the action of stellar winds . however , in older clusters where some of the massive stars have exploded one still might not detect any signature of a sn explosion because the effect of a snr on the thermal properties of the hot cluster gas is likely to be relatively short - lived .",
    "this time scale is generally believed to be @xmath11yr ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "for this reason , most studies of stellar clusters prefer a wind based explanation for the diffuse x - ray emission , though @xcite favour a recent sn explosion in their study of the eastern tip of the carina nebula .",
    "a distinction exists between individual stellar clusters , and larger scale regions of star formation which create superbubbles where multiple cavity supernovae are believed to be responsible for the diffuse emission ( such as those of 30doradus , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "given the challenges of interpreting such complex environments as msfrs , and the highly idealized models of most theoretical and modelling work , in this paper the hydrodynamical models of stellar wind and supernova feedback in an inhomogeneous environment outlined in @xcite ( henceforth referred to as paper i ) are used as a basis to simulate the resulting x - ray emission from such regions .",
    "of great interest are the x - ray luminosity and spectrum , and their temporal variation as the stars in the simulation cycle through various evolutionary stages , including main sequence , red supergiant , wolf - rayet and supernova . in section  [ sec : xray_model_details ] the details of the model and the method of calculating the x - ray emission and absorption are discussed .",

    "comparisons to numerical models and observations are made in sections  [ sec : comp_theory ] and  [ sec : comp_obs ] respectively .",
    "section  [ sec : xray_conclusions ] summarises and concludes this work .",
    "the x - ray calculations in this paper are based on the 3d hydrodynamical model described in paper i. the simulations were performed using the hydrodynamical code arwen , which uses a piecewise parabolic interpolation and characteristic tracing to obtain the time - averaged fluid variables at each zone interface .",
    "an iterative riemann solver is used to determine the time - averaged fluxes and solve the equations of hydrodynamics ( see paper i for more details ) .",
    "the simulations consist of three massive o stars which represent the main sources of mechanical feedback in a massive star forming region contained within an inhomogeneous gmc clump of radius 4pc and mass 3240m@xmath0 .",
    "the medium surrounding this clump is homogeneous , with a density of 3.33@xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) and a temperature of 8000k .",
    "the simulations were performed on a 512@xmath14 grid with free outflow boundary conditions .",
    "the total simulation volume covers a cubic region of @xmath1516pc centered on the gmc clump .",
    "the cluster wind is injected as thermal energy within a radius of 6 cells ( 0.375pc ) .",
    "the evolution of the three stars is treated simplistically as three distinct phases - the main sequence ( ms ) , red supergiant ( rsg ) and wolf - rayet ( wr ) phases .",
    "the details of the stellar cluster are summarized in table  [ evolution ] . at the end of the wolf - rayet phase",
    "the stars explode imparting 10m@xmath0 of material and 10@xmath16ergs of thermal energy into the environment .",
    "the lifespans of the stars are designed in such a way so that there are three distinct supernova explosions over the course of the simulation .",
    "the simulation utilizes a temperature dependent average particle mass , and molecular , atomic and ionized phases are tracked separately .",
    "the net heating / cooling rate per unit volume is parameterized as @xmath17 , where @xmath18 .",
    "@xmath19 is the heating coefficient and is set at a constant value of @xmath20 .",
    "@xmath21 is the cooling coefficient which is assumed to depend only on temperature .",
    "cooling at low temperatures ( t@xmath22k ) is then adjusted to provide three thermally stable phases which correspond to the molecular ( t@xmath23 10k ) , atomic ( t@xmath23 150k ) and ionized ( t@xmath23 8500k ) phases .",
    "this cooling curve and the phase diagram are shown in @xcite .",
    "photoevaporation is not treated in these simulations .",
    "however , as the photoevaporation time for a clump of these characteristics is comparable to the lifetime from ablation this should not significantly affect the results .",
    "the simulations in paper i showed that the inhomogeneous structure of the natal gmc cloud surrounding the cluster had an important effect on the initial expansion of the cluster wind , which cut channels through the low density material to escape the clump .",

    "this paper investigates the x - ray emission from a massive young stellar cluster embedded in an inhomogeneous gmc clump treating only the mechanical effects from winds and supernovae . the hydrodynamical input model was previously simulated in paper i , and this work explores the emission arising from that model .",
    "initially the dense parts of the clump decrease the observed x - ray emission due to attenuation , but once the cluster wind has destroyed and ablated a large portion of this material the attenuation from the ism material is dominant .    at very early times , when the wind material is still confined by the inhomogeneous gmc material the x - ray luminosity is reasonably bright , at l@xmath39 .",
    "however , as the cluster wind errodes and destroys the surrounding clump it is no longer completely confined and therefore hot gas is able to leak through the gaps in the shell .",
    "this causes a reduction in the x - ray luminosity as the pressure within the bubble decreases .",
    "once the low density gas from the clump has been ablated away the covering factor of the cluster remains more or less constant , leading to an approximately constant intrinsic x - ray luminosity of 1.7@xmath4 and an attenuated x - ray luminosity of 7@xmath40 .",
    "the most massive star becomes a rsg at t=4.0myrs , resulting in a large drop in the x - ray luminosity in all three of the x - ray broadbands studied .",
    "the most dramatic decrease is seen in the bb3 ( 2.510.0kev ) emission , where the attenuated x - ray luminosity drops four orders of magnitude , from l@xmath41 to l@xmath42 by the end of the rsg phase .",

    "although a lot of material is deposited in the rsg - enhanced cluster wind , the amount of material at x - ray emitting temperatures is very low , contributing to the lack of x - ray emission observed at this time .",
