    "star formation is widely thought to occur in molecular clouds , which then provide the raw material from which stars can accumulate during the course of the gravitational collapse .",
    "while many details of the star formation process remain topics of controversy , the idea that most young stellar objects ( ysos ) should be physically associated with molecular clouds remained unchallenged until recently .",
    "two observational findings in the last few years did , however , cast some doubt on this widely held belief . first came the discovery by the rosat satellite of a population of x - ray active pre - main sequence stars ",
    "many identified as weak - emission line t tauri stars ( wttss )  extending far beyond the boundaries of known star - forming regions ( e.g. , neuhuser et al .",
    "@xcite , neuhuser et al .",
    "this result was at first taken as an indication that ysos could migrate far away from the region of their formation on short time - scales .",
    "propositions to explain this fact included the formation of stars in fast - moving molecular cloudlets ( feigelson @xcite ) or tidally - induced escapes within multiple systems ( armitage & clarke ) . however , the recent finding that many of these pre - main sequence objects are most likely the low - mass counterpart of the gould belt ob  associations ( guillout et al .",
    "@xcite ) reconciles the rosat results with the conventional idea that these stars formed in ( now dispersed ) molecular clouds .",
    "another observation which may contradict the hypothesis that ysos and molecular clouds are associated was recently reported by favata et al .",
    "( @xcite ) . on the basis of the hipparcos satellite astrometric measurements",
    ", these authors assert that some classical t tauri stars ( cttss ) of the taurus - auriga star - forming region are apparently much closer than previously thought and may not belong to the taurus clouds .",
    "if this result were proven true beyond reasonable doubt , consequences for the physics of star formation and evolution of solar - type stars would be far - reaching , since arguments for the youth of a given stellar object relate primarily to its location in the vicinity of molecular clouds .",
    "four arguments are used to infer pre - main sequence status of a solar - type star :    * association with ob stars ( e.g. , in the orion trapezium region ) ; * association with dark or bright nebulosity ( e.g. , in the taurus - auriga region ) ; * location above the main - sequence in the hertzsprung - russell diagram ; * presence in the spectrum of the @xmath0  lii resonance line ( with equivalent width larger than in zams stars of the same spectral type ) .",
    "the first two criteria are straightforward : ob associations are short - lived , which guarantees the youth of associated low - mass objects , while physical association of a star with a cloud is either seen at the telescope when close reflection and emission nebulae are present  as is the case in the vicinity of many cttss  or inferred from kinematic studies ( e.g. jones & herbig ) .",
    "the last two criteria above are more indirect .",
    "the location in the h - r diagram depends on the assumption made about the respective luminosities of photosphere and circumstellar matter in a given object ( kenyon & hartmann ) , as well as on the assumed distance .",
    "lithium is , in theory , destroyed early in the star history , when the temperature at the bottom of the convection zone reaches about @xmath1k , but the lithium abundance may be dependent on variables other than age ( cf .",
    ", e.g. , ventura et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "if some cttss appear to be located nearby , and thus far away from known star - forming region , as suggested by favata et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , one must then choose between two equally unsettling possibilities : ( a ) either they are young stars , and one must explain how they arrived at their present location , or ( b ) they are field stars that mimic ysos , and one must understand how this is possible .",
    "needless to say , there are no obvious answers to these questions , and the entire picture of low - mass star formation would have to be fully revised in order to account for these observations .",
    "this paper provides a detailed re - examination of hipparcos satellite data for ttss , focusing mainly on distances and binarity / multiplicity properties .",
    "data are discussed in sect .",
    "3 then examines the hipparcos results relevant to yso and molecular cloud distances , and concludes that hipparcos distances for young stars are generally consistent with their expected physical association with molecular clouds .",
    "the same conclusion was reached independently by wichmann et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , but we extend their analysis by providing new astrometric solutions for groups of ttss in various star - forming regions .",
    "we then study the binarity / multiplicity hipparcos data in sect .",
    "4 . there , we discuss or improve the astrometric data reductions for several yso systems , using hipparcos intermediate astrometric data and , when available , taking advantage of recent spectroscopic information .",
    "the sample of young stars contained in the herbig & bell ( 1988 ) catalogue of orion population objects with emission lines ( hbc ) and observed by the hipparcos satellite is fairly limited:13  herbig ae / be stars ( 7 of which have significant parallax values ) ; 16 cttss , 10 of which have significant parallaxes ; 7 wttss or su aurigae stars , 4 of them are positively detected ; and 9 stars with uncertain pre - main sequence status , 4 of which have significant parallaxes .",
    "table [ table1 ] displays the ttss found both in the hbc and in the hipparcos catalogue ( esa @xcite ) .",
    "column 1 gives the star name , while columns 2 and 3 indicate its hbc and hip number , respectively .",
    "entries are in order of increasing @xmath2 .",
    "column 4 indicates the associated nebular region , and column 5 indicates the object type according to the hbc nomenclature .",
    "a ctts is denoted ` tt ' , a wtts is called ` wt ' , a member of the herbig ae / be ( haebe ) group is noted ` ae ' , and a su  aurigae - type star is marked ` su ' .",
    "a ` ? ' symbol indicates an uncertain type , while a ` * ' symbol denotes uncertain pre - main sequence status .",
    "column 6 gives the median hipparcos magnitude , and column 7 shows the hipparcos parallax @xmath3 in milliarcsecond ( mas ) , with standard error @xmath4 as indicated in column 8 .",
    "column 9 indicates the derived distance in pc for stars with @xmath5 ( marked ` :') and for stars with @xmath6 , with error bars corresponding to @xmath7 .",
    "column 10 gives the flag found in field h59 ( double and multiple systems annex flag ) of the hipparcos catalogue , the meaning of which we now briefly describe .",
    "for the majority of hipparcos stars , the astrometric solutions were derived using a single star model , where the five astrometric parameters are the equatorial coordinates ( @xmath8 ) , the proper motion components ( @xmath9 ) and the parallax @xmath3 . however , detected non - single stars received different solutions , depending on the nature of their duplicity .",
    "five different possibilities are noted in the h59 field by different flags : either the system was resolved into several components with an assumed linear motion ( component solutions , flag c in field h59 ) , or an orbital solution could be computed ( flag o ) , or the duplicity was detected by a non - linear motion of the photocentre ( acceleration solution , flag g ) , or by the variability of one component , resulting in a specific motion of the photocentre ( vim solutions : flag v ) , or by an excess scatter of the measurements possibly due to a short - period variation of the photocentre ( stochastic solutions , flag x ) .",
    "we emphasize here that the value of the derived parallax depends on the adopted astrometric model .",
    "it may happen , for example , that a single - star model was given in the catalogue for a star which is now known to be a spectroscopic binary .",
    "one can then go back to the one - dimensional measurements archived in the hipparcos intermediate astrometric data , cd - rom 5 , in order to compute an orbital solution for this system , resulting in a presumably more accurate value of the parallax and other astrometric parameters .",
    "the reader is referred to esa ( @xcite ) for a detailed explanation of astrometric solutions for non - single stars .",
    "this is one of the few objects in table [ table1 ] that hipparcos did not flag as a suspected binary star . that it is single down to 0.01 arcsec is further confirmed by hst observations ( bernacca et al .",
    "closer binarity would obviously not be detected by hipparcos , and we can rule out variability - induced motions of the photocentre to explain the parallax found in the standard data reduction .",
    "an undetected orbital motion can not be an explanation either , although a one - year orbital period would obviously result in a confusion between the orbital and the parallactic motion .",
    "we checked that this assumption would imply unreasonably large  masses ( on the order of 15m@xmath10 ) for the two components .",
    "because the star is apparently single , we can not dismiss bp tau s apparent parallax easily .",
    "we do not believe , however , that it should be taken at face value for the following reason .",
    "the solution published in the hipparcos catalogue represents the best astrometric fit with normalized @xmath11 equal to 1.1 .",
    "if we now compute a solution where we constrain the parallax to be that of the taurus stars , we get a fit with normalized @xmath11 equal to 1.2 . in other words , the solution is only marginally worse than the published solution , and a true parallax at @xmath12 from the published parallax is not unlikely .",
    "also , one should note that the star , although it would be located in front of the taurus group if the hipparcos parallax were correct , has the same proper motion as confirmed members of the taurus sfr .",
    "this casts additional doubt on the published parallax value .",
    "assuming for the moment that the hipparcos parallax is correct , is it plausible that the current location of bp tau could be explained by its relatively large heliocentric radial velocity , @xmath13  km  s@xmath14 ( barbier - brossat & figon 1999 ) ?",
    "this velocity translates to a lsr velocity of about + 5  km  s@xmath14 .",
    "given the lsr radial velocity of the local molecular cloud of + 7.1  km  s@xmath14 ( herbig @xcite ) , the radial velocity of bp tau with respect to the cloud is about -2  km  s@xmath14 .",
    "the radial displacement of the star in its estimated lifetime of 1 myr ( siess et al .",
    "@xcite ) is thus about 2 pc .",
    "this is obviously not consistent with location of bp tau in the molecular cloud at birth .",
    "there is no obvious reason to dismiss the hipparcos parallax for this star , but conversely , there is no strong reason to believe it either ; the large statistical error on the result precludes a firm conclusion .",
    "the reason for this large error is not obvious either .",
    "most likely , the culprits are the faintness of bp tau and its intrinsic variability . as in the case of df tau ,",
    "the conclusion is somewhat frustrating , as no clear - cut answer can be given to the question of these stars distance .",
    "a major conclusion that was drawn , however , is worth being repeated here : whereas distances of individual ttss must be viewed with caution , the distance of taurus ttss _ as a group _ is entirely consistent with the molecular cloud distance .",
    "one of the brightest cttss , gw  ori was found to be a single - lined spectroscopic binary by mathieu et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , who give its orbital parameters .",
    "because of the large distance of this star , the astrometric perturbation due to orbital motion ( reflex motion @xmath15  mas ) is too small for hipparcos to detect it .",
    "this is a sb2 system with well - defined orbital parameters ( cf .",
    "andersen et al .",
    "@xcite ) . unfortunately",
    ", the two components have nearly equal masses and luminosities , so that the photocentre orbital motion is not significant , precluding a computation of the other orbital elements from hipparcos data .",
    "astrometry turned out to be a powerful tool for detecting the binarity of variable stars using the variability - induced motion of the photocentre ( wielen @xcite ) . in spite of the limitations of the method , which must assume that only one component is variable and neglects all other causes of photocentre motions , the binary parameters derived for vim systems are in remarkable agreement with other observations .",
    "vim detection of the ry  tau binarity is a long awaited , but somewhat unexpected result of the hipparcos mission .",
    "this research made heavy use of the simbad database and vizier service of the centre de donnes astronomique de strasbourg ( cds ) and of nasa s astrophysics data system abstract service .",
    "we acknowledge useful discussions with sylvie cabrit , suzan edwards and catherine turon , and thank jean - louis falin for his reanalysis of and hipparcos data .",
    "we are also indebted to joli adams for smoothing out the english ."
