    "the simplest case already studied is the case of monomial ideals , which means ideals generated by monomials . in this case , the results are expressed in terms of the newton polygon of the ideal . if @xmath7 $ ] , denote @xmath8 the newton polygon @xmath9 is the union of the @xmath10-dimensional compact faces of the convex hull @xmath11 of @xmath12 . in particular the zariski decomposition of",

    "moreover , if @xmath1 has finite codimension , we have @xmath20 which is twice the area of the region @xmath21 delimited by the coordinate axes and the newton polygon .",
    "such results have been generalized in the case of non degenerate ideals of finite codimension .    in this article",
    "we prove for instance that such results can be generalized to _ any _ ideal , if we use a finite number of newton polygons instead of one .",
    "the method we use is inspired by newton s method to find roots of @xmath22 $ ] .",
    "we call it newton algorithm .",
    "we codify the algorithm in two ways : the newton tree which keeps the information of the successive newton polygons we encounter in the algorithm , and the newton process which keeps the information of all the newton maps we use in the algorithm . from the newton process",
    ", we can recover the newton tree but not the other way around .",
    "we prove that the newton process characterizes the integral closure of the ideal and allows to give its zariski decomposition , whereas the newton tree suffices to compute the hilbert - samuel multiplicity .",
    "it should be noted that the newton algorithm has been very efficient in the proof of the monodromy conjecture for quasiordinary power series , see @xcite@xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we introduce the newton algorithm , as a composition of newton maps , that transforms an arbitrary ideal @xmath1 of @xmath2 $ ] into a principal monomial - like  ideal .",
    "we associate a notion of depth to @xmath1 , being roughly the length of this algorithm , and we say that @xmath1 is non degenerate if the depth of @xmath1 is at most one . in the cases where @xmath1 is principal or of finite codimension ,",
    "this is consistent with usual notions of non degeneracy . in section 3",
    "we describe the newton tree and its combinatorial properties .",
    "in particular we compare the newton tree of a non - principal ideal with the newton tree of a generic curve of that ideal .",
    "the newton process is treated in section 4 , where we show that an ideal has the same newton process as its integral closure . in section 5",
    "we then study several invariants of an ideal @xmath1 of @xmath2 $ ] in terms of its newton tree or process .",
    "first we identify the rees valuations of @xmath1 with certain elements in the newton tree / process .",
    "this leads to the proof of the fact that two ideals have the same newton process if and only if they have the same integral closure , using a result of rees and sharp .",
    "further we interpret zariski s decomposition of @xmath1 , as a product of principal and simple integrally closed ideals of finite codimension , in terms of the newton process , generalizing ( [ closure - monomial ] ) .",
    "finally we compute , when @xmath1 has finite codimension , its multiplicity , its ojasiewicz exponent and its hilbert - samuel multiplicity @xmath5 from the newton tree , and we show an alternative formula for @xmath5 in terms of the area defined by the successive newton polygons encountered in the newton algorithm .",
