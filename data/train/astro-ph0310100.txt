    "x - ray observations from the past few years have revealed the existence of a large variety of galactic point - like sources , many of them identified with neutron stars but presenting very different observational properties .",
    "these unresolved sources , which appear either isolated or in the interior of supernova remnants ( snr ) , have no radio counterpart and very high x - ray to optical flux ratios . about half of these sources show x - ray pulsations with periods between 6 and 12 seconds ( anomalous x - ray pulsars , axp ) and can even present sporadic strong @xmath4-ray emission ( soft gamma - ray repeaters , sgr ) . the rest of these sources",
    "are generally called either isolated neutron stars ( ins ) if they are not associated with any other object in the sky , or central compact objects ( cco ) if they appear projected on the interior of a snr ( see a recent review by pavlov et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "the nature of most ccos is still unclear .",
    "brazier & johnston ( 1999 ) explain them as normal pulsars with unfavourable radio beaming , while the soft thermal x - rays would be easily detected due to its almost isotropic emission .",
    "on the other hand , vasisht et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and frail ( 1998 ) conclude that ccos are neutron stars ( nss ) born with long initial periods and high magnetic fields ( @xmath5 g ) , and thus would be related to axps and sgrs . however , geppert , page & zannias ( 1999 ) suggest that ccos are fast - spinning , weakly - magnetized sources . the x - ray emission from ccos",
    "is generally explained as thermal radiation from cooling nss ( e.g zavlin , trmper & pavlov 1999 ) , with typical temperatures of a few 10@xmath6 k , as inferred from their thermal - like spectra .    in a recent  study towards the bilateral snr g296.5 + 10.0 , giacani et al .",
    "( 2000 ) found that the associated cco , 1e 1207.45209 , lies near the center of a small  depression located at the same systemic velocity as the snr .",
    "the authors propose that the depression is due to self - absorption of a cool  cloud just foreground to a hotter volume of gas surrounding the cco , and heated by its x - ray flux .",
    "we have begun a systematic search for similar traces in the neutral gas around other ccos .",
    "the observations towards the x - ray point source rx j08224300 in puppis a revealed an  structure consisting of a nearly circular minimum coincident with the cco plus two aligned lobe - like depressions that appear to emerge from the cco ( reynoso et al .",
    "the two lobes appear to have been formed by a combination of the proper motion of the cco and the ejection of a collimated outflow . in this paper",
    ", we present the results obtained for e , the cco associated with the snr rcw 103 ( g332.40.4 ) .",

    "high - resolution radio polarimetric data reveal an approximately east - west alignment of the magnetic field which could be helping to limit the expansion north - south ( dickel et al .",
    "the brightening of the rim in the northern and southern sides , that hints for an incipient bilateral barrel shape for this snr , could be related to this frozen - in magnetic field .",

    "( 1975 ) suggest a distance of 3.3 kpc .",
    "optical filaments are seen toward the brighter regions of the radio shell ( van den bergh , marscher & terzian 1973 ; ruiz 1983 ) , and observations at infrared wavelengths show evidence for interaction with a dense interstellar medium ( ism ) , particularly to the south ( oliva , moorwood & danziger 1990 ; burton & spyromilio 1993 ; oliva et al .",

    "soft x - ray emission from rcw 103 was first detected with the einstein observatory ( tuohy et al .",
    "1979 ) , indicating a close correlation with the non - thermal radio emission .",
    "also , a faint , point x - ray source , e , was located near the centre of the snr ( tuohy & garmire 1980 ) .",
    "the lack of optical or radio counterparts led tuohy et al .",
    "( 1983 ) to propose that this point source was a thermally radiating cco .",
    "however , subsequent observations with the einstein ipc and rosat failed to confirm the existence of this source ( becker et al .",
    "finally , gotthelf , petre & hwang ( 1997 ) detected hard x - rays from the elusive cco using asca .",
    "they found that the spectral characteristics were incompatible with a simple cooling ns model .",
    "follow - up observations ( gotthelf , petre & vasisht 1999 ) confirmed that e   manifests long - term variability , explaining the non - detections after its discovery .",

    "was applied to the atca data cube to convert flux densities to brightness temperatures .",
    "no tapering was applied to the low resolution cube .",
    "the rms of the combined image is 2 k per channel .",
    "to constrain the systemic velocity of rcw 103 , we analyzed the absorption against the strong radio continuum emission from the remnant . the radio contimuum image obtained with atca at the frequency of 1384 mhz in a field of about @xmath15 around rcw 103",
    "is shown in figure 1 . according to the equation of radiative transfer ,",

    "equation ( 1 ) can be simplified to a single unknown if @xmath24 .",

    "( 1975 ) based on data obtained with the parkes interferometer with a 2  spectral resolution .",
    "we do not believe the absorption at + 34  to be real because ( a ) absorption features should appear also from 43  to the tangent point at 115 , and ( b ) the distance to the snr would be @xmath26 kpc , which gives an unrealistic size and expansion velocity .    for comparison",
    ", we obtained atca spectra towards the strong galactic radio sources present in the field g332.70.6 and g332.20.4 ( fig .",
    "1 ) , placed within @xmath27 of rcw 103 , and found that absorption features appear only in the velocity ranges from 0 to 50 and to 58  respectively .    to solve this puzzle , we followed the method employed by dickey et al .",
    "we constructed a new  cube without subtracting the radio continuum and removing all baselines shorter than 1 k@xmath8 ( 210 m ) . in this way , all  structures larger than @xmath28 are filtered out . the term involving @xmath19 in eq .",
    "( 1 ) can thus be neglected .",
    "the data cube was further weighted by the radio continuum .",
    "we then computed @xmath25 using eq .",
    "the resulting profile is plotted in figure 2c .",
    "this filtering method succeeded in removing most of the emission , as is apparent by comparing figs .",
    ". the absorption feature at 43  is confirmed , while the feature at + 34 has disappeared .",
    "this implies that the latter was produced by self absorption on a scale between @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the absorption feature at 43  corresponds to a lower distance limit of 3.1 kpc according to the galactic rotation model of fich , blitz & stark ( 1989 ) .",
    "we do not see any absorption against the emission peak at @xmath31 , even though it has a brightness temperature of @xmath32 k. thus the upper distance limit is 4.6 kpc .",
    "the lower distance coincides with the near side of the scutum - crux arm ( georgelin & georgelin 1976 ) , and will be assumed throughout the paper .",
    "we estimated the  column density towards e   by integrating the foreground  brightness temperature of the interferometric plus single - dish data up to 43 .",
    "the value obtained depends on the lower limit adopted for the velocity interval in the integration since , although the local gas is supposed to lie at a systemic velocity of 0 , turbulence may cause departures of about 7  from this value . besides , due to the distance ambiguity , it is possible that some background gas is included in the integration , leading to an overestimation of @xmath33 . at @xmath34 ,",
    "the line of sight crosses the far side of the scutum - crux arm . taking into account these considerations",
    ", we integrate the brightness temperature between @xmath35 and @xmath36  and estimate the  column density to be @xmath37 2 .",
    "the implicances of this determination will be discussed in @xmath384 .",
    "an inspection of the  images at velocities around 43 revealed that e   lies inside a local  depression which is present in all channels between 46.1 and 53.5 . in figure 3 , an image of the average  emission within this velocity interval is shown .",
    "the  depression , which attains its minimum at ra@xmath39 , dec.@xmath40 ( j2000 ) , is elongated , with a minor - to - major axis ratio of @xmath41 , and has a mean diameter of @xmath42 ( 1 pc at a distance of 3.1 kpc ) .",
    "e   is @xmath43 ( 0.3 pc ) away from the centre of the hole .",
    "we note that due to the proximity to the galactic plane , our data show several similar  depressions at different locations and velocities .",
    "however , the coincidence in position and velocity makes an association between the cco and this  feature very likely .    in what follows , we analyze possible origins for this  void .",
    "if the  minimum is produced because of a real absence of , then the missing mass is estimated to be 0.3 m@xmath44 .",
    "if instead it is produced by hot  gas self - absorbed by a cooler foreground , as proposed for the cco 1e 1207.45209 ( giacani et al .",
    "2000 ) , then we can follow the method described by schwarz et al .",

    "the hole attains its minimum emission at @xmath52 . we compared the brightness temperature of the atca  data at this velocity with the continuum emission and fitted a straight line to the distribution .",
    "to avoid confusion possibly introduced by regions of low continuum emission , all values of @xmath21 under 350   were clipped .",
    "we obtained that @xmath53 , which implies that @xmath54 . to estimate the spin temperature ,",
    "it must be noticed that for a single dish measurement towards a region with no continuum emission , the brightness temperature of the line is @xmath55 ( schwarz et al .",
    "we averaged the parkes data in a box around rcw 103 ( excluding the contribution from the snr ) and obtained that @xmath56 k , hence @xmath57 k. finally , at the location of e , the interferometric data give @xmath58 k and @xmath59 k. thus , applying eq .",
    "( 3 ) to the emission towards the cco , the hot  gas in the hole is found to have a temperature of @xmath60 k. such a temperature is unrealistically low at the interior of a snr , therefore we discard the possibility that the  minima observed around ccos are produced by self - absorption .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^ \" , ]      the rotational energy of pulsars is dissipated via a magnetized relativistic wind composed of electrons and positrons .",
    "the shock front between this wind and the ambient medium can give rise to a synchrotron emitting bubble ( known as a pulsar wind nebula , pwn ) .",
    "the detectability of such a pwn depends on the density of the ambient medium and the pulsar parameters .",
    "the majority of pulsars do not have detectable pwn ( gaensler et al . 2000 ) .",
    "for a very young pulsar inside an snr , the luminosity @xmath61 of the pwn is a strong function of the initial period of the pulsar , @xmath62 ( @xmath63 ; reynolds and chevalier 1984 ) .",
    "we do not detect a pwn at the position of e. rather , the radio continuum emission in rcw 103 has a minimum near the cco ( figure 4 ) . to investigate",
    "if there is a pwn around the cco that could be beam - diluted at the resolution of @xmath64 , we constructed another continuum image using only the longest baselines .",
    "this image , with a resolution of @xmath65 , shows no emission at the position of the cco down to a level of @xmath66 .",
    "this limit is not very constraining - it may imply either that the spin period of e  is not particularly short or that the pwn is not well confined in the interior of the snr .",
    "gotthelf et al . ( 1997 ) investigated different fits to the x - ray spectrum of e using a nonequilibrium ionization plasma model combined alternatively with a blackbody , a power - law , and a thermal bremsstrahlung continuum component .",
    "the best fits were achieved with  column densities of 5 , 31 , and @xmath67 2  respectively , although a fixed value of @xmath68 2  also gives reasonable fits in all three cases .",
    "the value of @xmath33 that we estimated from the present observations , @xmath69 2 , clearly favours the blackbody solution in this case .",
    "however , since 1997 , there is growing evidence to indicate that e might be an accreting binary system .",
    "chandra and asca observations revealed a sinusoidal light curve with a period of @xmath70 hr ( garmire et al .",
    "2000a ) . even though subsequent observations failed to detect the modulation again ( garmire et al .",
    "2000b ) due to pile - up in the detectors from the very high x - ray flux , the detection of two partial dips separated by 180@xmath71 in phase in the light curve , and a possible near - ir counterpart about @xmath72 away from the nominal chandra position , suggest that e   may be powered by accretion likely from a low - mass companion in a binary system ( sanwal et al .",
    "finally , becker & aschenbach ( 2002 ) discovered an eclipse 3 h after the start of their observations using xmm - newton data .",
    "this would make e the first accreting binary detected inside a snr .",
    "becker & aschenbach ( 2002 ) also obtained an x - ray spectrum towards e  and found that a simple blackbody model describes the data almost up to @xmath73 kev but not beyond .",
    "they obtain a best fit with a double blackbody , but the required @xmath33 of @xmath74 2  is incompatible with our results .",
    "we note that all the blackbody models imply temperatures as high as @xmath75 k ( becker & aschenbach 2002 ) and a luminosity of @xmath76 ergs s@xmath77 ( gotthelf et al .",
    "1997 ) , at least twice the values predicted by theoretical models ( see gotthelf et al .",
    "1997 and references therein ) . in general ,",
    "fitting ns models to the compact sources inside snrs presents the problem that the derived parameters ( temperature and luminosity ) are far larger than normally expected ( lloyd , hernquist & heyl 2002 ) . in addition , estimates of x - rays emitting areas based on blackbody models are usually too small to be the size of a ns ( e.g. becker & aschenbach 2002 ) .",
    "one possible solution is proposed by heyl & hernquist ( 1998 ) , who show that a hot blackbody can be mimicked if the cooling ns model includes an ultramagnetized star ( b @xmath78 g ) with an accreted hydrogen atmosphere .",
    "this explanation was also invoked for other ccos , like rx j082243 in puppis a ( zavlin et al .",
    "1999 ) and 1e 1207.45209 in g296.5 + 10.0 ( zavlin et al . 1998 ) . even in non - magnetic atmospheres ,",
    "the effect of h or he atmospheres is to deviate the high energy spectrum in such a way that the effective temperatures as given by blackbody models could be overestimated by a factor of 2 ( zavlin , pavlov & shibanov 1996 ) .    in summary",
    ", it seems most likely that e   is a binary system and that fits to the x - ray spectrum need to be re - visited . on the other hand , it is still possible that this system is a single neutron star .",
    "the constraints we have put on @xmath33 show that it is very hot for its age , and may indicate exotic atmospheric processes at work .",
    "the present study reveals the third case in which a cco associated with a snr is located inside an  depression .",
    "the other two cases are 1e 1207.45209 in the snr g296.5 + 10.0 , and rx j08224300 in puppis a. in table 1 we compare the main parameters derived for the three  depressions . in g296.5",
    "+ 10.0 , only the size and velocity width are given in giacani et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , thus the remaining parameters , where possible , have been estimated directly on the images presented in their paper . in computing the minor / major axis ratio , the beam elongation was taken into account .",
    "a number of similarities can be found between the three cases .",
    "all  cavities appear to have the same elongation , and the ccos are off - centred by similar distances . in the two cases where the missing mass was computed ,",
    "a similar value was obtained . on the other hand ,",
    "the size of the  hole in g296.5 + 10.0 is larger than the other two holes by more than a factor of 2 .",
    "this discrepancy may be related to the beam size of the observations , which is almost 4 times larger than those of the puppis a and rcw 103 data .",
    "the main difference between the three cases is given by puppis a , which presents two lobe - like  depressions emerging from its associated cco at the systemic velocity of the snr ( reynoso et al .",
    "the present observations do not reveal any similar morphology around e.    in what follows we will analyze if the  depression around e can be a swept up hole .",
    "the rate of energy needed to set the missing mass in the cavity into motion with velocity @xmath79 is @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the evacuated mass in m@xmath44 , @xmath82 is the radius of the hole in pc , and @xmath83 is the age of the cco , equal to the age of the host snr , in years . replacing in eq .",
    "( 4 ) the radius and missing mass computed in  3 , and assuming that the age of rcw 103 is 2,000 yrs ( carter et al .",
    "1997 ) , we obtain @xmath84 erg s@xmath77 , where the quoted errors allow for ages of 1,000 and 3,000 yrs old .",
    "the spin down energy loss has not been measured for e , but if it is similar to the values observed in other ccos ( energy loss rates between @xmath85 erg and @xmath86 erg ; slane et al .",
    "1997 , brazier & johnston 1999 ) , then a complete conversion of the rotational energy into kinetic energy of the surrounding medium can account for the observed  hole .",
    "an alternative possibility is that the depression does not contain swept up , low density gas , but is filled with  gas heated up by the cco at temperatures higher than the surroundings . in that case , the depression should contain enhanced ionized hydrogen ( i.e. it would form a small   region ) , and this is not observed in the radiocontinuum image .",
    "we would , however , expect to see infra - red emission from such a region but a search in mid- and near - infrared wavelengths using data from the midcourse space experiment ( msx ) and the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) , yielded negative results . in conclusion ,",
    "we find that the swept - up cavity provides a more convincing explanation for the observed  minimum .",
    "in this paper , we present the third case in which a cco lies at a local   minimum at a velocity compatible with the systemic velocity of the host snr .",
    "we have shown that self - absorption does not provide a satisfactory explanation for this kind of features , as was proposed for 1e 1207.45209 ( giacani et al .",

    "we did not detect any synchrotron nebula around the cco down to a level of 1 .",
    "the present data allow us to constrain the   column density to be @xmath88 2 .",

    "<S> we have carried out a study of the neutral hydrogen in the direction of the x - ray source e , a compact central object ( cco ) located in the interior of the supernova remnant ( snr ) rcw 103 . </S>",
    "<S> the   21 cm line observations were carried out using the australia telescope compact array , complemented with single dish data from the parkes radio telescope to recover information at all spatial scales . </S>",
    "<S> we derive a distance to rcw 103 of 3.3 kpc , in agreement with previous distance measurements . </S>",
    "<S> we have also detected a small hole in the   emission which is positionally and kinematically coincident with the location of the cco which confirms the association between the snr and the cco . </S>",
    "<S> this is the third case of a depression in   emission seemingly associated with ccos in snrs . </S>",
    "<S> the characteristic parameters of the holes such as their size , eccentricity and evacuated mass are similar in all three cases . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate the absorbing   column density towards e   to be @xmath0 2 , a value compatible with a blackbody solution for the cco x - ray emission </S>",
    "<S> . however , the implied brightness temperature is very high compared to most neutron stars . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the strong long - term variability in x - rays favours the hypothesis that e   is an accreting binary source rather than an isolated , cooling neutron star . </S>",
    "<S> an analysis of the continuum image obtained at 1.4 ghz from these observations shows no trace of a pulsar wind nebula around e , in spite of it being a young object .    </S>",
