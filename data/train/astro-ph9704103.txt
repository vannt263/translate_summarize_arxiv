    "the idea of ` bars - within - bars ' , with a small nuclear bar lying inside a slower - rotating kiloparsec - scale bar , was introduced to explain how gas could flow into the center of a galaxy with an active nucleus , to feed ` the monster ' lurking there ( shlosman , frank & begelman 1989 ) .",
    "torques due to a single bar can efficiently remove angular momentum from gas and cause it to move inwards ; but if the bar has an inner lindblad resonance , the gas accumulates in this region , which in a kiloparsec - scale bar is generally at least 100 pc out , and flow into the center is slow ( piner 1995 ) . nuclear bars nested within the main bar and having a whole range of position angles relative to it have been observed in the optical and near ir ( see shaw 1993 ; 1995 ; wozniak 1995 ; friedli 1996 ; erwin 1997 ) .",
    "self - consistent n - body simulations including a gas component ( friedli & martinet 1993 ; heller & shlosman 1994 ; combes 1994 ) have produced double bars which persist for at least several rotation periods and significantly influence the gas distribution in the inner parts of the galaxy .    because there is no reference frame in which the potential of a doubly - barred system is constant , the particle motions are often assumed to be chaotic : we show here that this is a misconception ; these potentials admit families of regular , multiply - periodic orbits .",
    "our work runs somewhat parallel to that of louis & gerhard ( 1988 ) and of sridhar ( 1989 ) , who studied orbits in a pulsating spherical system .",
    "in the symmetry plane of a single steadily - rotating bar , there are two principal families of stable orbits which close in the rotating frame of the bar , and lie within the corotation radius , at which the pattern speed of the rotating bar is equal to the orbital period of the disk stars : they are the @xmath0 and @xmath1 orbits , elongated respectively parallel and perpendicular to the bar . in a self - consistent bar",
    ", most of the stars will be on orbits trapped around the @xmath0 family ( contopoulos & papayannopoulos 1980 , sparke & sellwood 1987 ) . on these periodic orbits ,",
    "only the action associated with a star s orbit around the center is non - zero , and the motion is simply periodic .",
    "choosing spherical polar coordinates @xmath2 in the plane of the barred disk , we can approximate the potential @xmath3 of a weakly barred galaxy as the sum of an axisymmetric part @xmath4 and a bisymmetric term @xmath5 \\/,\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is the bar s angular velocity",
    ". the motion of a test particle in this potential can be decomposed into the ` guiding center ' motion , on a circle of radius @xmath7 with the angular velocity @xmath8 corresponding to the axisymmetric potential @xmath9 , together with the epicyclic oscillations resulting from the forcing term @xmath10 , and a free oscillation at the local epicyclic frequency @xmath11 . on a periodic orbit ,",
    "this last oscillation is absent , and in the rotating frame of the bar we can write the deviations @xmath12 from a circular orbit as @xmath13 where the frequency @xmath14 $ ] , and the constants @xmath15 are functions of the potential ; @xmath16 gives the initial position of the particle ( see section 3.3.3 of binney & tremaine 1987 ) .",
    "since the particle returns to the same point after a time @xmath17 , this orbit is closed .",
    "a second smaller bar would correspond to an additional potential of the form ( 1 ) , where @xmath18 and @xmath6 are replaced by the quantities @xmath19 and @xmath20 appropriate to the second bar .",
    "since the equations of motion are linear , the new forced oscillation is the sum of those induced by the two bar potentials separately ; in the frame rotating with the larger bar , we can write the displacement in radius as @xmath21 +   s_r \\cos [ ( \\omega-\\omega_p ) t + 2 \\theta_s ] \\/,\\ ] ] where @xmath22 , with a similar equation for @xmath23 . here",
    "@xmath16 is the initial angular coordinate of the particle , where we measure the time @xmath24 from the moment at which the two bars are aligned .",
    "_ we define a loop as the one - dimensional curve defined by varying @xmath16 : if at any instant one places particles along this curve , then after a time @xmath25 , they will all have returned to the curve , but will have moved around it by an angle @xmath26 . _ in this linear approximation , a loop is a set of particles which have the same guiding radius , and lack any free epicyclic motion , but respond only to the periodic forcing of the two bars ; a general orbit with that same guiding center will oscillate about the loop .    abandoning the epicyclic approximation , the two - dimensional problem of motion in the symmetry plane of a general doubly - barred system",
    "can be reformulated as that of motion in a three - dimensional time - steady potential ( lichtenberg & lieberman 1992 , p.15 ) . a regular orbit in such a potential can be expressed as the sum of motions with three independent frequencies , which are the relative pattern speed @xmath27 , and two others which correspond in the epicyclic limit to @xmath28 and @xmath29 ; on a loop , the action corresponding to the last of these , the free radial oscillation , is zero . in this case",
    ", we must find the loops numerically .",
    "clearly , the loop concept can be extended to a potential with 3 or more periodically varying components .",
    "as an example of a realistic double - barred galaxy potential , we modified the ` standard ' single - bar model used by athanassoula ( 1992 ) and piner ( 1995 ) , consisting of an axisymmetric disk and bulge , and an @xmath30 ferrers bar",
    ". the larger bar in our model is prolate with axial ratio @xmath31 , the quadrupole moment is @xmath32 m@xmath33 kpc@xmath34 and its semimajor axis is @xmath35 = 7 kpc ; the radius of the lagrangian point @xmath36 is @xmath37 .",
    "the small bar is also an @xmath30 ferrers bar , with its mass , linear size , and lagrangian radius all set at 60% of the corresponding quantities for the big bar .",
    "the central density and core radius of the bulge are adjusted so that the central density of the whole system is @xmath38 m@xmath33 kpc@xmath39 and the mass within 10 kpc is @xmath40 m@xmath33 .",
    "our potential has a somewhat weaker bar than the standard model of athanassoula and piner , with half the quadrupole moment , because we want to compare our exact loops with those predicted by the epicycle approximation .    in the epicyclic approximation ,",
    "our small bar has inner lindblad resonances at 0.6 and 1.3 kpc ; its corotation radius is at 4.9 kpc , beyond the outer of the inner lindblad resonances of the larger bar at 2.9 kpc .",
    "we solve the linearized equations of motion in the @xmath41 component of this potential , to find the loops in the middle column of figure 1 .",
    "the four innermost loops behave like the inner @xmath0 orbits in the potential of the smaller bar alone ; the inner two are almost circular , and the next two follow the small bar as it rotates inside the larger bar .",
    "particles following orbits trapped around these loops should be able to support the figure of the small bar .",
    "further out , as the influence of the large bar becomes stronger , the loops change smoothly from approximately following the @xmath0 orbits in the small bar , to being the counterparts of the @xmath1 orbits in the big bar . beyond the inner lindblad resonance of the large bar at radius 2.9 kpc , the loops are elongated along the @xmath42 axis and behave like @xmath0 orbits in the large bar .",
    "the small bar has little influence at these radii , except close to its corotation point at @xmath43 kpc .",
    "the epicyclic approach fails close to the lindblad resonances and the corotation point of either bar , since the perturbations @xmath44 and @xmath23 become large .",
    "when we return to the nonlinear equations of motion in the exact potential , we can again seek one - dimensional closed curves which transform into themselves after a time @xmath25 , when the two bars return to the same relative position .",
    "in general , the frequency @xmath27 of the two bar patterns relative to each other is not commensurable with the frequency @xmath28 with which any individual particle circumnavigates the loop ; so the position and velocity of a particle on a generic loop at successive times @xmath45 , where @xmath46 , will fill the one - dimensional curve which is the loop . in the rotating frame",
    "in which the large bar remains parallel to the @xmath42 axis , we searched for loops by following a particle that starts on the @xmath47 axis at an instant when the bars are aligned .",
    "we restricted ourselves to symmetric loops , for which the starting velocity along the @xmath47 direction is zero , and varied the starting @xmath42 velocity so as to converge on the loop , beginning from an initial estimate given by the epicyclic approximation .",
    "the left column of figure 1 shows one of our loop solutions , with the epicyclic approximation for comparison .",
    "the dots show successive positions of a particle launched near the loop and followed for 400 orbits ; it stays close to the loop , which is seen to be stable .",
    "although ( just as in a single bar ) particle orbits become chaotic near strong resonances , loops exist over most of the range in radius , suggesting that a self - consistent double bar could be built from particles on orbits trapped around them .    the central column of figure 1",
    "shows that many of the loops in our doubly - barred potential which lie within the small bar ( semimajor axis @xmath48 kpc ) remain aligned with it ; particles following orbits trapped around these loops can support the figure of this bar .",
    "if the small bar rotated somewhat more rapidly , its corotation radius would coincide with large bar s inner lindblad resonance ; tagger ( 1987 ) have suggested that a secondary bar is most likely to form with resonances in this relation .",
    "in that case , loops which are confined within the small bar would not be influenced by any of the resonances of the big bar , and almost all of them would remain aligned with the small bar as it rotates relative to the larger bar ; this would be the most favorable case for building a strong secondary bar .",
    "louis & gerhard ( 1988 ) have shown that two bars which make up a self - consistent double - bar system must distort slightly as they rotate through each other ; but since this deformation has the same periodicity as the relative rotation of the bars , it will not introduce any extra frequencies into the potential , and the loops should remain qualitatively similar to those we calculate here .",
    "lindblad & lindblad ( 1994 ) , and wada ( 1994 ) , added a dissipative term to the equations of motion in a single bar , linearized the equations using the epicyclic approximation , and studied the closed periodic orbits in this system . with the dissipative term included , the deviations from circular orbits are finite at the lindblad resonances , and the major axis of the closed orbits rotates smoothly through 90 degrees ; but the epicyclic approximation still breaks down at corotation . inside corotation ,",
    "a surprising correspondence was found : the pattern of closed orbits closely reflects the gas flows modeled hydrodynamically  the damped epicyclic equations give us a cheap way to preview the hydrodynamic simulation .",
    "these two papers used slightly different versions of the frictional term , and their results are substantially independent of the exact form chosen .",
    "unlike stars , gas clouds orbiting in a single bar potential can only fill orbits which do not cross themselves or intersect each other : gas clouds on self - crossing or intersecting orbits would collide , removing the gas from these orbits . in a double bar , if loops which are solutions of linearized equations of motion including dissipation should cross themselves or intersect other loops _ at any given time _ , gas will be quickly swept out of these loops . in regions where orbits or loops crowd together ,",
    "shocks in gas are expected , which would be visible in a real galaxy as dark dust lanes .    in order to preview gas flows in a doubly - barred potential",
    ", we included in our equations of motion a dissipative term @xmath49 \\ / r\\ ] ] proportional to the difference between the particle s velocity and the speed on a circular orbit at that radius ; the constant @xmath50 prescribes the strength of the friction .",
    "the results for @xmath50=16 km s@xmath51 , which at @xmath524 kpc is equal to the value used by lindblad & lindblad , are presented in the right column of figure 1 .",
    "this force corresponds only to about 8% of the circular velocity on the flat part of the rotation curve in our potential , so it is small in relation to other speeds in the problem .",
    "the flow breaks into two parts : the outer pattern is generated by the big bar and is almost steady in the rotating frame , while the inner one rotates along with the smaller bar .",
    "the shocks induced separately by each bar are at times connected ( the two lower panels on fig.1 ) while at other relative phases of the two bars , they are disconnected ( two upper panels ) .",
    "connected shocks may speed up the gas inflow into the galaxy center , which might give rise to a long - timescale periodicity in the feeding of an active nucleus . in the dissipative epicyclic approximation",
    ", particles remain on closed orbits or periodic loops , so we can not use this scheme to estimate the rate of gas inflow . depending on the relative location of resonances induced by both bars , the loop patterns can interfere with each other in different ways : so the arrangement of dust lanes or the distribution of gas can be used as a diagnostic of the bar pattern speeds in observed double - bar systems .",
