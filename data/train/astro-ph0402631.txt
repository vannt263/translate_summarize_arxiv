    "in a series of publications larsen @xcite and @xcite examined star cluster populations of 37 spiral and dwarf galaxies and compared the derived properties with overall attributes of the host galaxy . for this work they used archive hst data , own observations and literature data .",
    "they showed that cluster luminosity functions ( lfs ) are very similar for a variety of galaxies .",
    "they also found that the v - band luminosity of the brightest cluster , @xmath7 , correlates with the global star - formation rate , sfr , but it is unclear if this correlation is of physical or statistical nature .",
    "according to the statistical explanation there is a larger probability of sampling more luminous clusters from a universal cluster lf when the sfr is higher @xcite .",
    "@xcite concluded that all types of star clusters form according to a similar formation process which operates with different masses .",
    "smaller clusters dissolve fast through dynamical effects ( gas expulsion , stellar - dynamical heating , galactic tidal field ) and only massive clusters survive for a significant fraction of a hubble time @xcite .",
    "the notion is that virtually all stars form in clusters @xcite , and that a star - formation `` epoch '' produces a population of clusters ranging from about @xmath8 ( taurus - auriga - like pre - main sequence stellar groups ) up to the heaviest star cluster which may have a mass approaching @xmath9 .",
    "the time - scale over which such a cluster population emerges within a galaxy defines its momentary sfr .",
    "the aim of this contribution is to investigate if the empirical @xmath10 relation may be understood to be a result of physical processes . in   [ obs ]",
    "the observational data concerning the correlation between the sfr and @xmath11 of the brightest star cluster are presented , and the empirical and physical models describing this correlation are elaborated in   [ equ ] .",
    "  [ condis ] contains the discussion and conclusion .",
    "based on various observational results @xcite concludes that star clusters form under the same basic physical processes , and that the so - called super - clusters are just the young and massive upper end of the distribution .",
    "we firstly derive from this observational material a correlation between the absolute magnitude of the brightest cluster and the star - formation rate of the host galaxy .    including in fig.[fig1 ] all data - points presented by @xcite the following equation ( [ fitall ] ) emerges from a 2-dimensional linear least square fit @xmath12 with a reduced @xmath13 of about 17 . excluding four points ( a , b , c and d , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that lie far above this first fit leads to @xmath14 with a reduced @xmath13 of about 6 .",

    "error is based on photon statistics , and is always very small ( especially since these are the brightest clusters in the galaxies ) , usually 0.01 mag or less .",
    "most of the errors are systematic , due to uncertain aperture corrections , contamination within the photometric aperture by other objects and are typically 0.1 mag .",
    "the sfrs are derived from ir - fluxes puplished in the iras catalog which lists typical errors of 15% .",
    "however , a major source of uncertainty in the derived sfrs lies in the fir luminosity vs sfr calibration , for which @xcite quote a typical error of + 100%/-40% .",

    "the exclusion of a , b , c and d is motivated by three of them being clusters in very sparse cluster systems in dwarf galaxies ( ddo 165 , ngc 1705 and ngc 1569 ) dominated by a single brightest member .",
    "therefore the _ present _ sfr does not describe the rate during the birth of these clusters .",
    "it has dropped to the shown values as no further ( massive ) clusters are seen to be forming .",
    "this can be understood as a general trend of aging after a star - formation epoch .",
    "the underlying ( observed ) sfr has dropped while the clusters retain an approximately constant luminosity for the first few million years ( table  [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "the clusters therefore appear on the left in this diagram ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) in dwarf galaxies in which sf proceeds in bursts .",
    "the cluster in ngc 7252 was excluded because this galaxy is a several @xmath20  yr old merger in which the sfr was presumably much higher when most of its clusters formed and in which the brightest `` cluster '' is probably an unresolved or already merged star - cluster complex @xcite , and thus not a true single cluster .",
    "from the second fit to the observations ( eq .  [ fit ] ) we derive an empirical model for the dependence of the mass of the heaviest cluster on the underlying star - formation rate of the host galaxy . with the use of the mass - to - light - ratio , @xmath21 , the magnitude ( @xmath22 )",
    "can be converted to a mass ( @xmath0 ) , @xmath23 where @xmath0 is the stellar mass in the cluster .",

    "this does not always hold true for the very youngest phases , where the clusters may briefly brighten somewhat due to the appearance of red supergiant stars ( table  [ tab1 ] ) .",

    "<S> observations indicate that young massive star clusters in spiral and dwarf galaxies follow a relation between luminosity of the brightest young cluster and the star - formation rate ( sfr ) of the host galaxy , in the sense that higher sfrs lead to the formation of brighter clusters . assuming that the empirical relation between maximum cluster luminosity and sfr reflects an underlying similar relation between maximum cluster mass ( @xmath0 ) and sfr , we compare the resulting @xmath1 relation with different theoretical models . the empirical correlation is found to suggest that individual star clusters form on a free - fall time - scale with their pre - cluster molecular - cloud - core radii typically being a few  pc independent of mass . </S>",
    "<S> the cloud cores contract by factors of  5 to 10  while building - up the embedded cluster . </S>",
    "<S> a theoretical @xmath1 relation in very good agreement with the empirical correlation is obtained if the cluster mass function of a young population has a salpeter exponent @xmath2 and if this cluster population forms within a characteristic time - scale of a few-@xmath3  myr . </S>",
    "<S> this short time - scale can be understood if the inter - stellar medium is pressurised thus precipitating rapid local fragmentation and collapse on a galactic scale . </S>",
    "<S> such triggered star formation on a galactic scale is observed to occur in interacting galaxies . with a global sfr of @xmath4/yr </S>",
    "<S> the milky way appears to lie on the empirical @xmath1 relation , given the recent detections of very young clusters with masses near @xmath5 in the galactic disk . </S>",
    "<S> the observed properties of the stellar population of very massive young clusters suggests that there may exist a fundamental maximum cluster mass , @xmath6 .    </S>",
