    "prompt long wavelength follow - up of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) has revolutionized the study of these energetic and enigmatic objects . with the successful launch of the recent high - energy missions such as the _ high energy transient explorer 2 _ ( _ hete-2 _ ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , _ international gamma - ray astrophysics laboratory _ ( _ integral _ ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and _ swift _ @xcite satellites , rapid follow - up of gamma - ray bursts has come to maturity . _",
    "swift _ and",
    "_ hete-2 _ not only detect new grbs but also provide rapid x - ray localization allowing for very precise ( uncertainties as small as a few arcseconds ) positions , far superior than possible in the past .",
    "the size of modern grb samples have become large enough to study the statistical properties of grbs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and rapid follow - up observations have allowed for the first optical , radio , and x - ray localization of afterglows from short - hard gamma - ray bursts @xcite",
    ".    there has been large - scale success in identifying afterglows and conducting prompt spectroscopic follow - up ; afterglows extending out to @xmath0 @xcite have been spectroscopically confirmed providing luminous probes of the universe even back to the era of reionization .",
    "recently , high resolution spectroscopy of grbs has allowed for detailed studies of absorbing systems arising in the local environment of the grb progenitor @xcite .",
    "absorption line analyses of grb afterglow spectra show structure similar to that of quasar damped ly@xmath1 absorbers ( dlas ) but extend to higher hydrogen column densities and include several metal lines not found in quasar dla systems @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that grbs can provide a new class of standard candle for future cosmological experiments @xcite . as the luminosities of these objects should allow detection to very high redshifts ( @xmath2 ) @xcite",
    ", studies of grbs could extend current work using sn ia to high redshifts , thus providing considerable constraints on our understanding of cosmology .",
    "before gamma - ray bursts can be used as a cosmological tool , however , a large number of bursts must be observed spectroscopically in order to calibrate the method .",
    "two keys to studying grb afterglows are the identification of a transient afterglow coincident with the burst detected at high energies and high - quality information for in - field photometric calibration stars so that all observations can be placed onto a common photometric system .",
    "currently , many afterglow searches compare new data to digitized palomar observatory sky survey photometric plates ( dss ) and use usno stars @xcite to calibrate both astrometry and photometry .",
    "as larger telescopes join the search for afterglows , the dss imaging quickly becomes insufficient , as these images are too shallow for a detailed comparison to deep optical imaging , so afterglow candidates can only be identified through their temporal properties .",
    "the usno catalog is a astrometric catalog , but it was not intended as a source of photometric calibration across the sky ; usno - calibrated photometry may thus be strongly affected by systematic photometric residuals in the usno catalog itself .",
    "the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) provides accurate photometry and astrometry for objects over @xmath3 of the sky , making it a viable alternative to the dss images and usno catalogs .",
    "the imaging from sdss extends over a magnitude deeper than those from the dss , making it a valuable resource in identifying transient objects while the stable photometric and astrometric calibration of the survey makes it an ideal source of calibration data in grb fields . in order to aid the community",
    ", we are releasing sdss imaging and spectroscopy for the fields of 27 _ swift_-observed grbs detected after december 2004 , including bursts originally localized by _ swift _ , _ hete-2 _ , and _ integral _ observations . here , we offer a bulk release of grb fields observed in the sdss , but , in the future , we will release similar data through the grb coordinate network ( gcn ) shortly after the detection of a new burst within the sdss survey area .",
    "in this document , we provide some basic documentation relating to the sloan digital sky survey and describe the data products included in each grb release .",
    "we hope that the information provided here will be a useful primer for those unfamiliar with sdss data , but this document is by no means intended to be a full description of the survey or survey data products .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows : in  2 , we describe the sloan digital sky survey itself .",
    "a brief description of photometric quantities measured in sdss is given in  3 .",
    "we describe the data products provided with each grb release in  4 and offer some concluding remarks in  5 .",
    "the sloan digital sky survey @xcite is imaging @xmath4 steradians of the sky through 5 filters , @xmath5 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see figure [ fig : filters ] and table 1 for transmission curves and effective wavelengths ) .",
    "the imaging is conducted with a ccd mosaic in drift - scanning mode @xcite on a dedicated 2.5 m telescope @xcite located at apache point observatory in new mexico .",
    "images are processed @xcite and calibrated @xcite after which targets are selected for spectroscopy @xcite with two double - spectrographs mounted on the same telescope using a fiber allocation algorithm which ensures highly complete spectroscopic samples @xcite .",
    "the reduced spectra are classified and redshifts are determined using the idlspec2d automated pipeline ( schlegel et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "cccccc & 3546 & 4670 & 6156 & 7472 & 8917    the photometric calibration of sdss imaging results in photometry which is nearly on an ab system @xcite .",
    "the details of sdss photometric calibration are beyond the scope of this document ; the interested reader may find the calibration procedure in the data release papers and technical papers cited above ; the bottom line is that the photometric calibration in sdss is quite robust with small random errors .",
    "when considering the position of the bright - star stellar locus in color - color space , the rms errors in the @xmath6 , @xmath7,and @xmath8 bandpasses are found to be 0.01 mag , 0.02 mag in the @xmath9-band , and 0.03 in the @xmath10-band @xcite .",
    "similarly small photometric errors have been demonstrated by measuring the small scatter in the colors of early - type galaxies on the red sequence @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the data provided in these pre - burst grb releases have been processed using a slightly different pipeline than that used for the sdss public data releases .",
    "we can not guarantee that the values presented here will exactly match those from the sdss public data releases ; in particular , we expect the photometric calibrations to differ by of order 0.01 mag .",
    "astrometric calibration within sdss is also quite robust .",
    "relative astrometry is generally better than 50 milli - arcseconds per coordinate while the absolute astrometry is generally better than 0.1 arcseconds per coordinate @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the sdss astrometric system can have systematic offsets with respect to other astrometric catalogs .",
    "users requiring high accuracy astrometry should check for any such offsets when comparing astrometry between sdss and data calibrated to another astrometric system .",
    "users of @xmath11 imaging may also find the transformations ( both empirically measured and theoretically derived ) between the @xmath11 and @xmath5 photometric systems described in @xcite and @xcite useful when using the photometry included in our grb releases to calibrate new observations .",
    "in this section , we outline the definitions of several of the photometric measurements used in the sdss and included in this data release .",
    "this description is , by no means , an exhaustive source of information .",
    "much more detailed descriptions of the sdss data products can be found in the data release papers and the technical papers referenced in the previous section .",

    "asinh magnitudes are identical to the standard logarithmic magnitude @xcite .",

    "the petrosian flux is given by the flux within a circular aperture of @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the radius at which @xmath31 falls below 0.2 .",
    "in sdss , @xmath38 is determined in the @xmath7-band then subsequently used in each of the other bands . in the absence of seeing effects , this flux measurement contains a constant fraction of a galaxy s light , independent of its size or distance , and thus provides a fair flux measurement when comparing galaxies of different sizes or at different redshifts .",
    "more details of sdss petrosian magnitudes can be found in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .      a number of data quality flags",
    "are maintained in order to guarantee the accuracy of photometric measurements in sdss .",
    "a full description of these flags is beyond the scope of this document but can be found in the early data release paper @xcite and at the sdss dr4 website . for each object",
    "included in this release , we provide five quality flags ( one for each band ) based on the flags output by the sdss pipeline . in brief , we collapse all of the sdss data quality flags into a single yes or no quality indicator .",

    "these stars provide a reliable basis for both the astrometric and photometric calibration of grb follow - up imaging .",

    "we recommend using model fluxes when calculating colors of galaxies with @xmath42 .",
    "we generally prefer petrosian fluxes compared to model fluxes for the overall flux of a galaxy , but petrosian fluxes are noisier than model quantities at faint flux levels .",
    "we warn the user to exercise caution about using photometry with quoted errors larger than 20% in flux .",
    "these objects generally are simply low signal - to - noise ratio detections , but sometimes the large errors indicate complications in the reductions .",
    "if sdss spectroscopy has been completed in the field of the grb , we include redshifts of spectroscopically observed objects within 6@xmath40 of the grb location in the sdss.spectro file .",

    "<S> in this paper , we present sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) photometry and spectroscopy in the fields of 27 gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) observed by _ swift _ , including bursts localized by _ swift _ , _ hete-2 _ , and _ integral _ , after december 2004 . after this bulk release </S>",
    "<S> , we plan to provide individual releases of similar data shortly after the localization of future bursts falling in the sdss survey area . </S>",
    "<S> these data provide a solid basis for the astrometric and photometric calibration of follow - up afterglow searches and monitoring . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the images provided with this release will allow observers to find transient objects up to a magnitude fainter than possible with digitized sky survey image comparisons . </S>"
