    "the subaru deep field ( sdf ; @xcite ) catalog and the subaru / xmm - newton deep survey ( sxds ; @xcite ) catalog are wide and deep photometric catalogs at high galactic latitude using the subaru prime focus camera ( suprime - cam ; @xcite ) .",
    "they have been used for many studies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "recently , @xcite identified and reported the discrepancy in b - band and r - band photometry between sdf and sxds catalogs by comparing them with the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) data release 8 ( dr8 ; @xcite ) photometric catalog .",
    "the amount of the photometric zero point ( zp ) difference is more than 0.1 mag .",
    "@xcite wrote that `` in any case , the errors in the photometric zero points of our final images would be less than 0.05mag . '' and @xcite wrote that `` ... the uncertainties of calibrated photometric zero points of the sxds images are 0.03  0.05 mag rms . '' the zp difference of 0.1 mag is larger than the error that sdf / sxds claimed .    in this paper",
    ", we measure the zp offset of the sdf and sxds catalog from sdss , and investigate the potential causes .",
    "it should be noted that the zp offset also affects the catalog magnitude of extended sources , though we only used photometry of point sources to measure it .",
    "the investigation of the possible photometric errors of each object from flat - fielding , sky subtraction , and/or coadding is beyond the scope of this paper , and will be investigated elsewhere .. the total errors are 0.06 , 0.02 , 0.03 , 0.05 , and 0.06 mag for b , v , r , i , and z - band , respectively . ]    the official filter names of the suprime - cam , w - j - b , w - j - v , w - c - rc , w - s - i+ and w - s - z+ , are abbreviated as b , v , r , i , and z , respectively .",
    "for the difference between the sdss and suprime - cam band , we always subtract suprime - cam magnitude from the sdss one .",
    "if we write i - i in a figure , it means i(sdss)-i(suprime - cam ) . the ab magnitude system @xcite is used throughout the paper",
    "the original calibration of the sdf and sxds catalogs was performed in two stages @xcite .",
    "first , the photometric result is calibrated using standard stars .",
    "the calibration of sxds depends on the previous work by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "then , a slight ( @xmath1 mag ) shift is applied to the photometric zp so that the color - color diagram of stars matches the model color - color diagram .",
    "the model color is constructed with the atlas of @xcite spectral library(gs83 ) , assuming that the distribution of the color of the stars in gs83 is the same as those in the observed field .",
    "sdf used 100 bright i@xmath223 mag stars in the observed field , and sxds used 700 - 1100 of 20.5@xmath2r@xmath223.5 mag stars .    to verify the assumption that the color of gs83 is the same as the stars in the field , we used another calibrated catalog ( sdss dr8 ) .",
    "we retrieved stellar objects ( type=6 in photoobj table in sdss catalog archive server ) in @xmath3(deg)@xmath4 , @xmath5(deg)@xmath6 for sxds and @xmath7(deg)@xmath8 , @xmath9(deg)@xmath10 for sdf .",
    "the areas are 1.714(sxds ) and 0.309(sdf ) square degree , and the difference in the area size is the main reason for the difference in the number of the stars .",
    "we use psfmag of sdss hereafter , but our result is the same if we use modelmag instead .",
    "sdss uses asinh magnitude @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "the pogson magnitude@xcite @xmath12 is calculated as @xmath13 , \\label{eqn : laptitude}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is a softening parameter .",
    "the parameter for each band is given on the sdss webpage .",
    "in @xmath15 range , however , the difference between asinh magnitude and pogson magnitude is negligible ( @xmath16 mag ) as calculated from equation ( [ eqn : laptitude ] ) , and we neglect the difference hereafter .",
    "the difference between sdss magnitude and ab magnitude is still under debate .",
    "we adopted the offset used in kcorrect@xcite v4 ; @xmath17 m = m@xmath18 - m@xmath19 = -0.036 , 0.012 , 0.010 , 0.028 , 0.040 in u , g , r , i , and z bands .",
    "though the precision of the values is not explicitly given , we expect that it would be smaller than 0.01 mag , since the values have a 0.001 digit . in sdss - dr8 ,",
    "some stars have multiple entries in the database , as they were observed more than once .",
    "we calculate the magnitude difference in g , r , i and z - band between each pair of the entries of stars observed multiple times .",
    "we adopted a threshold of difference as 3@xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) , and if the difference is larger than the threshold , the star is not used in our analysis , since it might be a variable star . if the difference is smaller than the threshold , the psfmag of the multiple entries are averaged and used in the following analysis .",
    "the synthetic color of gs83 stars are calculated following the equation ( 9 ) of @xcite using the transmission by @xcite , and overlaid on the catalog colors of sdss stars in figure [ fig : colcol_gs83 ] .",
    "@xcite measured the responses of correctors , filters and ccds in sdss using a monochromatic illumination system .",
    "then it is multiplied with the model reflectivity of the primary and the secondary mirrors and given in their table 4 .",
    "we multiplied it with the atmospheric transmission at 1.3 airmass given in the table , and the product was used as the sdss transmission in this study .",
    "@xcite reported that the variation of the response function may amount to 0.01 mag in g , r , i and z band , but it is cancelled by a calibration procedure , and does not appear in the final sdss catalogs .",
    "they concluded that the residual effects are smaller than 0.01 mag for all passbands .",
    "we can therefore expect that the error of synthetic magnitudes due to a possible error of the transmission curve would be @xmath20.01 mag .    since the gs83 spectral energy distribution ( sed ) adopts the air wavelength while sdss transmission uses the vacuum wavelength , we converted the sed to the vacuum wavelength using the index of @xcite , which has very small ( @xmath22 ) difference from the iau standard by @xcite .",
    "we omitted 22 stars from the plot since they lack data at some wavelength within g , r , and/or i passband .    in figure",
    "[ fig : colcol_gs83 ] , it is clearly seen that gs83 stars have an offset from sdss stars to the right - bottom direction .",
    "the possible effect of the galactic extinction is checked with the extinction curve by @xcite and @xcite with rv=3.1 .",
    "the reddening vector is also written in figure [ fig : colcol_gs83 ] . as the reddening is a bit different in different sed",
    ", we plotted the median reddening vectors for o , and m - type stars in gs83 .",
    "the direction of the gs83 offset from sdss stars is perpendicular to the reddening , and therefore the offset is not caused by the galactic extinction .",
    "we calculate the amount of the offset by comparing the distribution of gs83 stars with an empirical fit of the distribution of sdss stars .",
    "@xcite gives an analytical expression of ( g - r ) color of sdss stars as a function of their ( r - i ) color .",
    "the amount of ( g - r ) offset of gs83 stars from the fit is shown in figure [ fig : compjuric ] .",
    "the median offset of ( g - r ) is 0.13 mag for the @xmath23(r - i)@xmath24 clump .",
    "this color offset between sdss and gs83 was already recognized by previous studies ( e.g.,@xcite ) .",
    "@xcite discussed that the offset is explained by the metallicity variance .",
    "they investigated the color of stars in the sdss system using a photometric catalog of sdss - dr6@xcite .",
    "the blue gs83 stars are metal - rich disk stars , while the sdss stars , especially at high galactic latitude , are metal - poor popii stars .",
    "we discuss the metallicity effect in section [ sec : metal ] . here",
    "we stress that the color distribution of gs83 stars would not be a good representation of that of the faint field stars that were used for the sdf / sxds calibration .      in this study",
    ", we return to a classical color calibration method ; a color conversion between filter systems .",
    "if we can convert the sdss catalog magnitude to the ab magnitude in the suprime - cam system , all the stars in sdss would be used as photometric standards . though the photometric error of sdss ( @xmath25mag ) is relatively larger than that of the well - calibrated photometric standard stars ( e.g.,@xmath16mag;@xcite ) , or that of the spectrophotometric standard stars ( e.g. , @xmath20.5%@xmath00.005 mag ; @xcite ) the large number of sdss stars , @xmath2650 stars in a suprime - cam field will make the systematic error smaller .",
    "this method was not possible when the sdf or sxds catalog was constructed , since the sdss catalog of the region did not exist . now",
    "this method is promising , thanks to the wide coverage of the sdss dr8 catalog .",
    "we fit the difference of suprime - cam magnitude and sdss magnitude as a function of the sdss color ; @xmath27      in our previous work @xcite , we fit bruzual - persson - gunn - stryker atlas ( bpgs ) colors with quadratic functions .",
    "bpgs is an extrapolation of the original gs83 data , and is also used in this study instead of gs83 , hereafter . in this work ,",
    "we first use the model spectral energy distributions ( seds ) to cover a wider variation of stars , such as low - metal stars .",
    "we retrieved several flux calculation of atlas9 models @xcite on the web ( atlas9 grids ) . the input parameters are the metallicity ( [ fe / h ] ) , the alpha enhancement ( [ @xmath28/fe ] ) , the temperature ( t ) , the surface gravity ( log g ) , mixing length parameter ( l / h ) , the helium enhancement ( dy ) , and the perturbation velocity(v@xmath29 ) .",
    "we adopted l / h=1.25 , v@xmath29=2 km s@xmath30 , and dy=0 models , because these parameters are used as default values in the atlas9 grids .",
    "the temperature range is @xmath31 . since the relation between the temperature and the surface gravity changes according to [ fe / h ] ,",
    "the possible combinations are taken from yonsei - yale(y@xmath32 ) isochrone version 2 @xcite , which covers 0.4@xmath2m@xmath33m@xmath345 stars . in the isochrone , stars of all ages are used .",
    "we used [ @xmath28/fe]=0.3 models in y@xmath32 for [ @xmath28/fe]=0.4 models to set constraints on the combinations of [ fe / h ] , t and log g. note that low mass ( m@xmath33m@xmath340.4 ) stars , subdwarfs and white dwarfs are not included in the model .",
    "the set of [ fe / h ] and [ @xmath28/fe ] we used are ( + 0.5,0.0 ) , ( + 0.5,+0.4 ) , ( 0.0,0.0 ) , ( 0.0,+0.4 ) , ( -0.5,0.0 ) , ( -1.5,0.0 ) , ( -1.5,+0.4 ) , and ( -2.5,+0.4 ) . the set of the temperature and surface gravity are taken from y@xmath32 isochrone @xcite .",
    "we do not apply galactic extinction at this stage .",
    "the effect of the galactic extinction is investigated later .      for sdss synthetic magnitude",
    ", we adopted the transmission by @xcite .",
    "it includes the atmospheric effect at airmass=1.3 at the sdss site .",
    "the suprime - cam response is calculated as the product of the quantum efficiency(qe ) of mit / lincoln laboratory ( mit / ll ) ccds , the filter responses , the transmittance of the primary focus corrector , and the reflectivity of primary mirror .",
    "the extinction of a model atmosphere at airmass=1 is then multiplied .",
    "the total throughput curves are slightly different from the one used in sdf and sxds photometric calibrations , because of the update of the responses of the telescopes , and difference of the airmass . however , the difference is negligible ( @xmath20.01mag ) in this study .",
    "it should also be noted that the sdss system is at airmass=1.3 , and suprime - cam system is at airmass=1 .",
    "the possible effect of the change in airmass on the suprime - cam system is investigated later .",
    "the synthetic ab magnitude is calculated by multiplying the model seds and the system response .",
    "the wavelength of model seds by atlas9 are in a vacuum , and the suprime - cam response is in the air .",
    "we corrected the sed to the air wavelength and measured the color .",
    "note that the difference of the wavelength between in the vacuum and in the air is 1  2 , and makes 0.007 mag difference at most .",
    "we then fit the equation ( [ eqn : colorconv ] ) to the model color distribution .",
    "the internal calibration error of sdss dr8 is claimed to be 0.01 mag in g , r , i , and z - band @xcite .",
    "dr8 adopted ubercal method @xcite , and the absolute zero point is calibrated against dr7@xcite .",
    "the absolute zero point error of dr6 is evaluated by @xcite .",
    "they compared photometry against spectroscopic data , and concluded that the error is smaller than 0.04 mag .",
    "since the data handling of dr7 is the same as dr6 , the error of the absolute calibration of dr7 and dr8 would be smaller than 0.04 mag .",
    "we therefore aim to obtain a fit whose systematic error @xmath35 0.04 mag .",
    "the order of the polynomial is set so that akaike s information criterion is minimal .",
    "the fit results are shown as figure [ fig : fit0 ] , and the coefficients are presented in table [ tab : coeff0 ] . in the color range shown in the table , the deviation of the model color from the fitting polynomial is smaller than 0.04 mag .",
    "we collected four empirical seds ; bpgs , hilib@xcite , stelib@xcite , and the indo - u.s .",
    "library of coud feed stellar spectra ( cflib ; @xcite ) to see whether the color conversions also work well for them .",
    "we did not interpolate the seds , and the data which lacks some part in the filter coverage were omitted .",
    "the result is shown in bottom panels of figure [ fig : fit0 ] .",
    "most of the color deviations are within the @xmath36 range , except for a few ( @xmath37 in b , at most ) outliers .",
    "the color of the stars is changed by the galactic extinction , and we can only know the upper limit of the extinction .",
    "we adopted the model first developped by @xcite and updated by @xcite , and applied an av=1 extinction with rv=3.1 to the model seds to see how the deviation changes .",
    "the reddened sdss color versus residual is plotted in figure [ fig : av1 ] . because of the nonlinear fit of the equation ( [ eqn : colorconv ] ) , the nearly linear shift of the distribution by galactic extinction makes the distribution winding . even with the extreme av=1 reddening , however , the fit is better than @xmath38 mag in the selected color range . for the sdf and sxds field ,",
    "the total galactic extinction is av=0.049 and 0.058 , respectively , from @xcite via nasa / ipac extragalactic database(ned ) .",
    "we can therefore expect that the effect of galactic extinction on sdf and sxds catalogs does not affect the color conversion much .",
    "the atmospheric extinction is another factor to change the color conversion .",
    "the sdf and sxds were observed in various airmasses .",
    "we estimated the exposure time weighted mean of the airmass using the subaru stars archive @xcite .",
    "the result is shown in table [ tab : airmass ] .",
    "the mean airmass is between 1 .",
    "we can also see a trend that longer wavelength data are observed in larger airmass .",
    "observers know that seeing size in shorter wavelength is likely to be affected by the airmass , while lights of longer wavelength are less dimmed by atmospheric extinction , observers prefer to observe shorter wavelength at smaller airmass .",
    "this may introduce some systematic biases in the calibration .",
    "we used an atmospheric extinction curve shown in figure [ fig : skyext ] .",
    "the model is constructed using the high resolution line extinction data by @xcite and the mauna kea extinction model .",
    "the change of the sdss color vs @xmath17 color relation is shown in figure [ fig : airmass ] .",
    "we fit a function @xmath39 to the difference of the synthetic magnitude between airmass=1 and 2 models .",
    "the coefficients are shown in table [ tab : extcoeff ] . in figure",
    "[ fig : airmass ] , only @xmath40 is corrected . after the correction of the linear airmass term",
    ", we can not see any difference among the different airmass models in v , r , and i - band relations , as suggested by small @xmath41 . in b - band , a ( g - r)=1.5 object would brighter by @xmath42 mag at airmass=2 . in z - band , an ( i - z)=1.5 object would brighter by @xmath43 mag at airmass=2 .",
    "it should be noted that the extinction in magnitude is not a linear function of the airmass when a cross - term of color and airmass exists , and it makes the airmass=3 model in z - band slightly shifted . in airmass@xmath23 ,",
    "the relations are in the @xmath38 mag range .",
    "if we use this sdss color versus ( sdss)-(suprime - cam ) plot , the airmass effect is small , and the difference of the mean airmass among the different bands would have no effect .",
    "the model spectra are calculated in the rest frame .",
    "the recession velocity of a star makes the spectrum redshifted / blueshifted , and may change the color . in faint magnitude",
    ", the majority of stars will be halo stars , and they would have a large recession velocity in some field , because of the rotation of the sun around the galaxy .",
    "we constructed @xmath44300 km s@xmath45 model spectra and made sdss color vs @xmath17color plots .",
    "the result is shown in figure [ fig : pecvel ] . in z - band calibration",
    ", we can see a slight offset , but the difference is 0.006 mag at most .",
    "we can conclude that the effect of the recession velocity on the color conversion is negligible for galactic stars .",
    "we then re - calibrate the zp of sdf and sxds catalogs using the color conversion in the previous section .",
    "we used the public catalog of sdf data products version 1 and sxds data release 1 ( dr1 ) .",
    "sxds consists of 5 fields , sxds - c , sxds - n , sxds - s , sxds - e , and sxds - w , which are defined in @xcite . both catalogs used suprime - cam @xcite with mit / ll ccds .",
    "the mag_auto parameter is used for the magnitude .",
    "the galactic extinction is not corrected in the catalog .",
    "we set constraints so that fwhm is smaller than 8 pixels ( 1.6arcsec ) , and brighter than 24 mag . for both catalogs ,",
    "all combinations of the detection band and the measurement band are available , but we used catalogs whose detection band is the same as the measurement band .",
    "we cross - matched the sdf and sxds catalogs with stars in sdss dr8 .",
    "the object within 2 arcsec from the sdss star is regarded as the corresponding object .",
    "we first select the nearest sdss star within 2 arcsec from each sdf / sxds star .",
    "if an sdss star is assigned to more than one sdf / sxds star , the nearest pair is kept for identification .",
    "the residual of coordinates of stars in r - band magnitude of @xmath46 are shown in figure [ fig : pos0 ] , where we simply converted @xmath47 and @xmath48 , though the astrometry of sxds - c shows a larger scatter , the radius of 2 arcsec of cross - match covers the difference .",
    "the sdss magnitude versus the difference color of the sdss and suprime - cam is shown as figure [ fig : cmd0 ] . in the figure ,",
    "the object whose suprime - cam magnitude is fainter has a negative difference in y. the tendency that bright objects has a negative difference is due to a saturation in suprime - cam data . as it is not simple to exclude saturated objects from the catalog correctly , we did not apply any selection of saturation in this study .",
    "note that the difference in y is not corrected for the color dependence , and therefore the relation is broad .",
    "for example , the two loci in v - band correspond to two different populations , distant blue stars and closer red stars .    from figure",
    "[ fig : cmd0 ] , we adopted the magnitude range for the calibration ; @xmath49 for b and v , @xmath46 for r , @xmath50 for i , and @xmath51 for z. in the magnitude range , the saturation of suprime - cam stars has not effect .",
    "we also set a constraint that the error of the sdss photometry , psfmag_err@xmath20.1 , to avoid poor photometry data .",
    "then , the sdss color versus the difference color of the sdss and suprime - cam in the magnitude range are plotted in figure [ fig : cal0 ] .",
    "they correspond to the top panels of figure [ fig : fit0 ] . in some panels",
    ", we can see a significant offset from the model color distribution .",
    "the green filled circles with errorbars show the median of the ( sdss)-(suprime - cam ) color in 0.2 mag bin of sdss color .",
    "the errorbar represents the root mean square ( rms ) of the bin estimated from the median of the absolute deviation ( mad ) as @xmath52 the trend is almost parallel to the distribution of the model distribution .",
    "the apparent difference in the slope between the model and the catalog in z - band is a fake .",
    "it was made by the relatively larger dispersion of z(sdss ) ( @xmath53 mag ) compared with that of i(sdss ) ( @xmath25 mag ) and z(suprime - cam ) ( @xmath16 mag ) .",
    "the distribution is elongated from top - left to bottom - right by the error of z(sdss ) , and taking a median of z(sdss)-z(suprime - cam ) after binning in i(sdss)-z(sdss ) changed the apparent slope .",
    "if we plot i(sdss)-z(suprime - cam ) vs z(sdss)-z(suprime - cam ) , the z(sdss ) error is perpendicular to the binning axis , and the model and the catalog is almost parallel .",
    "the result suggests that the difference between the sdss and suprime - cam catalog would be the offset of the zp of suprime - cam catalogs .",
    "we then estimate the offset of the zp of the sdf and sxds catalogs from the sdss based on an estimation using the parameters in table [ tab : coeff0 ] . the number of stars , the median of the offset , and the rms of the distribution ( @xmath20 ) calculated from the mad are shown in table [ tab : zpdiff ] .",
    "the offset is also plotted as a function of the wavelength as figure [ fig : wavdepend ] , where open squares represent sdf , and other symbols represent sxds fields . for sxds",
    ", a clear correlation between the wavelength and the offset is recognized .    in table",
    "[ tab : zpdiff ] , the @xmath20 ( 5th column ) is the rms of the distribution and not the error .",
    "the determination error of the offset from statistics is roughly approximated by @xmath54 mag , where @xmath55 is the factor for the rms of the median .",
    "the @xmath20 mainly comes from the photometric error of sdss .",
    "we calculated the contribution of the sdss error as @xmath56 and is shown in the 6th column in table [ tab : zpdiff ] .",
    "the @xmath20 is partly explained by the sdss error . if we subtract the effect , the mean residuals of the 6 fields are 0.06 , 0.02 , 0.03 , 0.05 , and 0.06 mag for b , v , r , i , and z - band , respectively .",
    "the residuals include the intrinsic dispersion around our best fit , which is the error of our color conversion , and the error of the data reduction and the photometry .",
    "some suprime - cam data show an offset even larger than the sigma of the distribution , and the offset is significant .",

    ", the offset is different between sdf and sxds by @xmath57 . on the other hand ,",

    "the systematic difference between sdf and sxds seems to be marginal in z - band , @xmath58 . in i",
    "- band , the variation of the estimated offset is large ( peak - to - peak 0.06 mag ) .    in summary , we found a significant offset of zp in some of the sdf / sxds catalogs at bright ( @xmath59 ) magnitude stars from ab magnitude of sdss .",
    "the amount of the offset is significantly larger than the estimated uncertainty from the catalogs .",
    "if we correct the zp offset , the distribution of the ( sdss)-(suprime - cam ) color follows the model sequence well .",
    "examples are shown as figure [ fig : cal1 ] .",
    "the different offset of b - band and z - band ( figure [ fig : wavdepend ] ) makes the color distribution of sdf and sxds different .",
    "we made a color histogram of faint objects in sdf and sxds - c and compared them .",
    "most of the faint objects are galaxies .",
    "we used the r - band selected catalog , the r - band based object extraction and mag_auto .    for the b - band check , we used ( b - r ) color , because @xcite calibrated and checked b and r - bands . the galactic extinction is assumed to be @xmath60=(0.07,0.04 ) for sdf , and ( 0.091,0.056 ) for sxds - c@xcite",
    "the result is shown as the left panel of figure [ fig : colhist0 ] . the slight difference in the size of the observed area",
    "is not corrected . in the original catalogs , the blue end of the color histogram is different(figure [ fig : colhist0 ] top - left ) .",
    "the difference gets smaller if we use our recalibrated catalogs ( figure [ fig : colhist0 ] bottom - left ) .",

    "our correction again decreases the apparent difference of the color distribution .",
    "this result suggests that the different zp offset between sdf and sxds in b - band and z - band would be due to a calibration error , and not coming from possible inhomogeneity of sdss dr8 .",
    "the result also shows that the offset of magnitude found around r@xmath020 mag stars would be similar in r@xmath024 mag objects .",
    "it supports our assumption that the difference between the sdss - based magnitude and the original sdf / sxds magnitude would be an offset of the zp in sdf / sxds catalogs .        in figure",
    "[ fig : colcolmodel_bpgs ] , we plotted bpgs stars and atlas9 models .",
    "we plotted model points with [ fe / h]=0 and [ @xmath28/fe]=0 ( hereafter [ fe / h]=0 model ) as filled green circles and those with [ fe / h]=-2.5 and [ @xmath28/fe]=0.4 ( hereafter [ fe / h]=-2.5a model ) as filled red circles .",
    "the [ fe / h]=0 model seems suitable in all the color combinations in atlas9 . for a comparison , we plotted sdss stars of ( @xmath62 ) in sdf and overlaid models in figure [ fig : colcolmodel_sdss ] .",
    "the [ fe / h]=-2.5a models well covers the sdss color distribution on the bluer side , and [ fe / h]=0 model is somewhat better on the redder side .",
    "the reason why the color - color diagram ( figure [ fig : colcolmodel_sdss ] ) shows the offset between different metallicities but not in figure [ fig : fit0 ] is simply the difference in the central wavelength of the filters used in the y - axis .",
    "the variation of slope and curvature of the spectrum has less of an effect on the y - axis for a pair of passbands which have close central wavelengths .",
    "the trend that blue stars are metal poor is understood by the color - magnitude relation of the stars , and the metallicity gradient along the distance from the galactic disk .",
    "we checked this effect using a simple model .",
    "we adopted a metallicity distribution by @xcite , and connected them with intercepts as @xmath63 } & = & -0.21 |z| ~~(|z|<2)\\nonumber\\\\ & & -0.16 |z|-0.1 ~~(2\\leq|z|<5)\\nonumber\\\\ & & -0.05 |z|-0.65 ~~(5\\leq|z|<48)\\nonumber\\\\ & & -3 ~~(48\\leq|z| ) , \\label{eqn : zzmodel}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath64 is the distance from the galactic plane in kilo parsec unit .",
    "then the correlation of the color and the metallicity is calculated for a certain apparent magnitude .",
    "we used the color and the magnitude from y@xmath32 isochrone with @xcite color models @xcite , as the model seds do not give the radius of the star , and therefore the calculation of the absolute magnitude is difficult to perform .",
    "we adopted [ @xmath28/fe]=0.3 for [ fe / h]@xmath65 - 1 , and [ @xmath28/fe]=0 for [ fe / h]@xmath261 .",
    "note that the y@xmath32 model prepares [ @xmath28/fe]=0.3 and 0.6 , while the atlas9 grids prepare [ @xmath28/fe]=0.4 .",
    "then , the metallicity , the color and the absolute magnitude are obtained from the isochrone .",
    "when we set an apparent magnitude , the absolute magnitude is converted to the distance , and then it is converted to @xmath64 using the galactic latitude .",
    "if the metallicity is within @xmath66 of equation ( [ eqn : zzmodel ] ) , the point is plotted . in figure",
    "[ fig : colz ] , we plotted the ( b - v ) color versus metallicity relation of v=14 and v=19 magnitude stars in galactic latitude of 60 and 80 degree fields , which correspond to sxds and sdf fields .",
    "note that the color of @xcite is in the johnson ubv system , and ( b - v)@xmath18=(b - v)@xmath67 + 0.10 @xcite .",
    "we corrected the color for the magnitude system difference in figure [ fig : colz ] .",
    "the trend is thus reproduced by a simple model , and the effect is stronger in fainter magnitude .",
    "we can therefore think that `` if one tries to match the distribution of faint stars , which should have low metallicity , with that of higher metallicity stars ( such as bpgs and gs83 ) by tuning the zp , incorrect shifts might be introduced . ''",
    "the second step of the sdf and sxds calibration may have suffered this effect .    in figure",
    "[ fig : supcolcol1 ] we plot color - color diagrams in suprime - cam color for sdf and sxds - c .",
    "the stars matched with the sdss catalog are used , and magnitude cut based on sdss magnitude is applied ; @xmath49 for ( x - v ) vs ( v - y ) , @xmath46 for ( x - r ) vs ( r - y ) , and @xmath50 for ( x - i ) vs ( i - y ) , where x=(b , v , r ) and y=(r , i , z ) . the magnitude range is the same as that for the calibration in the previous section .",
    "the filled black circles are the values in the catalog .",
    "the estimated zp offset in table [ tab : zpdiff ] is shown as a blue arrow .",
    "the filled circles represent the model colors ; [ fe / h]=0 model in green and [ fe / h]=-2.5a model in red , as in figure [ fig : colcolmodel_bpgs ] .",
    "sdf b - band offset is understood by this metallicity effect .",
    "the original calibration follows the [ fe / h]=0 models and the arrow shows that it should rather follow [ fe / h]=-2.5a models . since @xcite did not shift the b - band of sxds , the distribution is free from the metallicity effect , and it would be the reason the b - band zp offset of sxds from sdss is small ( @xmath68 mag ) .",
    "the calibration of sxds depends on the calibration by @xcite .",
    "we refer to the catalog by @xcite as the gt - sxdf - catalog hereafter .",
    "the b , v , r and i - band data of gt - sxdf - catalog were obtained in november and december 2000 .",
    "additional r - band data and z - band data were obtained in september 2001 .",
    "we investigated the gt - sxdf - catalog which was used for the calibration of sxds dr1 catalog , whether they also show an offset from sdss .",
    "in november and december 2000 , the ccd configuration of suprime - cam was heterogeneous ; four site ccds , three mit / ll engineering ccds with a brickwall pattern ( we call them mit0 ) , and two mit / ll scientific - grade ccds without a brickwall pattern ( mit1 ) .",
    "the three different types of ccds have different qe functions . in april 2001 ,",
    "the mit0 and site chips were replaced with mit1 ccds .",
    "the sdf and sxds dr1 data re - calibrated in this study were obtained with the mit1 ccds .    in figure",
    "[ fig : gt0 ] , the sdss color versus ( sdss)-(suprime - cam ) magnitude are plotted using the gt - sxdf - catalog .",
    "we simply classified the stars in the gt - sxdf - catalog to the nearest ccd group .",
    "therefore , misclassifications and/or hybrids may contaminate . in @xcite",
    ", they adopted the 2 arcsec aperture magnitude with 0.2 mag aperture correction , but we adopt mag_auto as in the plot as @xcite . for figure",
    "[ fig : gt0 ] , we adopted a slightly different magnitude selection from figure [ fig : cmd0 ] as @xmath49 for b and v , @xmath46 for r , @xmath69 for i , and @xmath70 for z. as r - band is a coadd of data taken with old ccds and mit1 ccds , and mit1 model is overplotted , though the difference is indistinguishable .",
    "the gt - sxdf - catalog was calibrated as the ab magnitude with the site response as done in @xcite , which is slightly different from the mit1 response adopted in sxds .",
    "it might have contributed partly to the offset of zp of sxds in b - band . in the b - band mit0 plot",
    ", the color slope is different between the model and the catalog , suggesting that the ccd response used in the calculation was wrong at shorter wavelength .",
    "it is reported that the linearity of mit / ll ccds was not so good from october 2000 to december 2000 .",
    "the effect of the correction on the zp is unclear , though .    in i and z - band , the offset in the zp from the estimation",
    "is already seen in the gt - sxdf - catalog .",
    "it should be noted that the ccds used in z - band are the same as those for the sxds catalog , and the offset is not from the difference of ccd responses .",
    "unfortunately , the details of the first step of the standard star calibration for the gt - sxdf - catalog were lost because of a hardware failure ( ouchi , m. , 2012 , private communication ) .",
    "we can not unveil the history further .",
    "for i - band in sxds , synthetic magnitude of sa95 - 42 calculated from spectrophotometric data by @xcite was used@xcite , and the synthetic magnitude of 16.23 was adopted .",
    "we noticed that oke s spectrum is different from that of sdss as shown in figure [ fig : specsa95 - 42 ] .",
    "the sdss i - band magnitude calculated from sdss spectrum ( 16.11 ) is 0.12 mag brighter . in sdss dr8",
    "photometric data , meanwhile , the magnitude of sa95 - 42 is 16.16 after the ab - sdss correction of 0.028 by kcorrect v4 .",
    "the sdss i - band ab magnitude of sa95 - 42 has thus not converged",
    ". it might be an origin of the @xmath0 0.1 mag dimming of sxds catalog and gt - sxdf - catalog from sdss . and",
    "since both i - band and z - band had offsets in the zp in the sxds catalog , the offsets in both bands would not have been fully corrected in the comparison with the gs83 distribution .",
    "the spectrophotometric standard stars used in sdf for i and z - band are hz21 , hz44 , gd153 , p177d , and p330e @xcite .",
    "they are originally from @xcite , and are available at stsci sites .",
    "the stars do not have sdss spectra , but have psfmag in sdss dr8 .",
    "the difference of the i and z - band psf magnitudes of sdss dr8 and the synthetic magnitudes using @xcite transmission and the sed are shown in table [ sdfstandards ] . the offset given by kcorrect v4 is applied to sdss magnitude in the table .",
    "the error shows the sdss catalog error ( psfmag_err ) .",
    "the version of the sed used for the analysis of sdf and adopted magnitude were lost and we can not investigate the historical detail .",
    "however , the difference is mostly too small ( @xmath20.04 mag , except for z of hz44 and i of gd153 ) to explain the 0.1 mag offset we found .",
    "moreover , the sign of the gd153 offset in i - band ( + 0.14 mag ) is opposite to the zp offset we found . in our analysis ,",
    "sdf stars are fainter than sdss , while the synthetic magnitude of gd153 is brighter than sdss .",
    "therefore , the i - band and z - band magnitude difference of sdf may not be explained only by some error of spectrophotometric standards .",
    "using sdss , we found an offset of the zp of sdf and sxds .",
    "we present a robust color conversion from sdss to the suprime - cam system .",
    "the color conversion is robust against the difference in metallicity , galactic extinction , atmospheric extinction , and recession velocity of the stars . and the offset of zp",
    "is then calculated against sdss .    if we applied the correction of the offset we obtained , the difference in the color distribution of faint ( @xmath71 ) objects in sdf and sxds disappears .",
    "the result supports that the relative color difference between sdf and sxds is corrected well by our result . and",
    "since the relative color offset of sdf and sxds of bright stars ( @xmath72 ) and at the faint object are consistent , it should be explained by a simple offset of the zp .",
    "the b - band offset of sdf would be explained by the difference of the color of stars in the data and the adopted references , due to the different metallicity .",
    "the i and z - band of sxds inherited the offset in the previous catalog .",
    "the magnitude of i - band standard star sxds adopted ( sa95 - 42 ) has a offset ( @xmath730.07 ) from sdss , which may be the origin of the sxds i - band offset .",
    "the origin of the offset of sdf i - band and sdf / sxds z - band are yet to be understood .",
    "we thank the anonymous referee for valuable comments and suggestions .",
    "we appreciate masayuki tanaka , masami ouchi , nobunari kashikawa , and kazuhiro shimasaku for their suggestive comments , indications , and information . the sdf catalog and sxds catalog",
