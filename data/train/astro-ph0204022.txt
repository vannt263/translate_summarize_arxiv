    "clusters of galaxies are believed to form from the infall / merging of smaller scale systems .",
    "memory of the formation process may be probed through the x - ray analysis of the intracluster medium ( icm ) , where most of the cluster s visible mass resides .",
    "this is due to the fact that the merging of sub - units is predicted to create gas substructures such as temperature and density inhomogeneities , destruction of cooling flows & metal abundance gradients and generation of gas bulk velocities .",
    "the comparison of observed structures to numerical hydrodynamical+n body simulations can then provide clues as to the cluster s evolutionary stage ( e.g. evrard 1990 ; katz & white 1993 ; navarro , frenk & white 1995 ; evrard , metzler , & navarro 1996 ; roettiger , burns & loken 1993,1996 ; schindler & muller 1993 ; pearce , thomas & couchman 1994 ; gomez et al .",
    "2001 and references therein ) .    until very recently the physical characteristics of the icm had been derived almost exclusively by the analysis of distributions of electron temperature ( @xmath6 ) and surface brightness ( @xmath7 ) ( or gas density ) , even though in the last few years various numerical simulations of off - center cluster mergers have been published predicting the presence of long - lasting residual intracluster gas velocities approaching a few thousand km  s@xmath4 ( e.g. roettiger , loken & burns 1997 , ricker 1998 ; roettiger , stone , & mushotzky 1998 ; takizawa & mineshige 1998 ; burns et al . 1999 ; takizawa 1999 , 2000 ; roettiger & flores 2000 ) . furthermore , since we are always looking at 2-d projections , velocity maps may be a crucial addition , necessary to break the degeneracies associated with analyses based solely on @xmath6 & @xmath7 distributions .",
    "recently , dupke & bregman ( 2001a , b ) detected icm bulk motions in two galaxy clusters using _ asca _ data : perseus ( abell 426 ) and centaurus ( abell 3526 ) .",
    "the intracluster gas velocity distributions detected in these two clusters are roughly consistent with systematic gas bulk rotation with correspondent circular velocities @xmath8 1000 km s@xmath4 , implying that a significant fraction of the intracluster gas energy can be kinetic . since x - ray measurements are haunted by the need of precise knowledge of instrumental gain these detections are significant only at the ( 2 - 4 ) @xmath9 level .",
    "realistically , the significance of these measurements are not expected to improve substantially within the next several years even with _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ , since the spectral resolution of the imaging spectrometers on - board these satellites , acis and epic , is only slightly better than that of the siss on - board _",
    "asca_. furthermore , it will take a few years before detailed gain variations across those detectors are known well enough for reliable icm velocity measurements . to compensate for the lack of knowledge of the gain variations in x - ray spectrometers it is necessary to take several consecutive off - center long - exposure observations of a cluster , so that sky regions with discrepant radial velocities can be observed at the same ccd position . however , this kind of measurement is very time consuming if one does not have prior knowledge of the best orientations for velocity measurements .",
    "alternatively , icm velocity measurements can be , in principle , corroborated / detected by the use of the kinetic s - z effect ( sunyaev & zeldovich 1970 , 1972 , 1980 ) .",
    "intracluster gas bulk velocities as high as those detected in a3526 should generate significantly different levels of comptonization of the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) towards different direction of the cluster ( red - shifted and blue - shifted sides ) .",
    "this effect could be detected with current ( or in development ) instruments , such as the _ bolocam _ , or , with smaller spatial resolution , _ acbar _ and the high frequency instrument on - board _",
    "planck_.    in this paper we realistically predict differential variation of the cmbr temperature as it passes through the intracluster gas of the central regions of the centaurus cluster , @xmath10 @xmath11 .",
    "we propose that this effect can be observed soon in cool clusters such as centaurus at frequencies that minimize the thermal component ( 214 ghz ) .",
    "we suggest that differential s - z measurements of clusters , coupled with x - ray spatially resolved spectroscopy can provide crucial information not just to cosmology but also to the study of intracluster gas dynamics .",
    "the cmbr intensity and temperature variations with respect to the background towards the direction of a rotating cluster has two components ; a thermal and a kinetic component .",
    "the latter can be associated with some global peculiar velocity and also with internal bulk motions , which is the one that we are interested in this work .",
    "if the resulting radial velocity of the kinetic s - z component at some projected radius `` b '' is denoted by v@xmath12 the thermal and kinetic variation of intensity ( @xmath13 ) and temperature ( @xmath14 ) of the cmb in the non - relativistic approximation can be can be given by ( for reviews see , e.g. , rephaeli 1995 ; birkinshaw 1999 ) :    @xmath15    @xmath16    @xmath17    where    @xmath18    @xmath19    where @xmath6 & @xmath14 are respectively the icm and cmb temperatures , and the other parameters have their usual meanings . if the gas number density @xmath20 follows a king - like profile @xmath21 , where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are respectively the core radius and the central density , the optical depth is given as a function of the projected radius `` b '' by    @xmath24    where @xmath25 is the beta function of p , q .",
    "centaurus ( abell 3526 ) is a bm type i , nearby ( z@xmath0 0.0104 ) , x - ray bright cooling flow ( accretion rate @xmath26 30 - 50 m@xmath27yr@xmath4 ) , cold ( kt@xmath28@xmath293 - 3.5 kev ) ) cluster .",
    "its x - ray emission is relatively smooth except for the central 1@xmath5 where _ chandra _ found x - ray substructures ( sanders & fabian 2001 ) , and is peaked on the cd galaxy ngc 4696 .",
    "the existence of galaxy velocity bi - modality in centaurus had been shown by lucey , currie & dickens ( 1986a , b ) and was more recently confirmed by stein et al .",
    "two galaxy groups are clearly separated : the main group ( cen 30 ) , which is centered on the cd galaxy ( ngc 4696 ) shows an average radial velocity of 3397@xmath1139 km  s@xmath4 and a velocity dispersion of 933@xmath1118 km  s@xmath4 . the second group ( cen 45 ) is associated with the galaxy ngc 4709 at @xmath3015@xmath31 from ngc 4696 .",
    "it has an average radial velocity of 4746@xmath143 km  s@xmath4 and a velocity dispersion of 131@xmath323 km  s@xmath4 .",
    "one arcmin at centaurus distance corresponds to @xmath0 19 h@xmath33 kpc .",
    "the general interpretation for this bi - modality is that cen 45 is being accreted by the centaurus cluster .",
    "this explanation has been further strengthened by : 1)the discovery of higher gas temperatures ( @xmath305 kev ) associated with cen 45 by churazov et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and 2 ) a marginally significant intracluster gas velocity difference of @xmath0 1800 km s@xmath4 between cen 45 and cen 30 detected by dupke & bregman ( 2001b ) , hereafter db01 .",
    "more interestingly , db01 found a small - scale ( within the central 10@xmath5 ) significant ( @xmath899.8% confidence ) intracluster gas velocity gradient more or less symmetric with respect to the cluster s center , consistent with bulk gas rotation with a correspondent circular velocity of 1.59@xmath10.32 @xmath2 10@xmath3 km  s@xmath4 .",
    "the nature of this velocity gradient is likely to be related to some previous merger on the main body of the centaurus cluster ( cen 30 ) .",
    "the maximum velocity difference is found roughly along an axis at a position angle of @xmath0 40@xmath34 ( figure 1 ) .",
    "therefore , velocity measurements by means of the kinetic s - z effect on cmbr temperature and intensity variations could be optimized along that axis ( e.g. by choosing symmetric subregions for source / background along that position angle , such as the extremes of the box in figure 1 ) .    in figure 2",
    "we show the absolute and relative variations of intensity and cmbr temperature towards the directions of maximum ( dotted ) and minimum ( dashed ) velocities _ as observed _ by _ asca _ , i.e. , 5@xmath5 away from the cluster s core ( regions p3 & p7 in figure 1 ) , as a function of wavelength .",
    "both kinetic and thermal effects are added .",
    "the gas density profile used was obtained taking into account that we are looking at spatial regions with the same scale as ( or smaller than ) the cluster s core radius .",
    "therefore , it is more appropriate to choose surface brightness profile fittings that realistically take into account the central cluster region , where the surface brightness is enhanced and single @xmath35 models diverge significantly from the observed profiles .",
    "we believe that the double @xmath35 fitting profiles used in the extensive _ rosat _ analysis of mohr , mathiesen & evrard ( 1999 ) ( hereafter mme99 ) are the most reliable for that purpose and we use them in our calculations . ]",
    "mme99 surface brightness fitting function @xmath36 , assumed a constant @xmath35 but different core radii and normalizations for the dominant components near the center and away from the central regions . to deproject that surface brightness fitting and",
    "obtain a `` physical '' density profile mme99 expressed the total gas density as being proportional to the primary density component multiplied by a `` fudge '' function ( @xmath37 ) that compensated for the distortions caused by the central component .",
    "mme99 constrained @xmath37 using the observed surface brightness for each radial bin .",
    "following their methodology we use for our @xmath38 the following integral @xmath39    instead of equation 6 . in equation",
    "7 @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the number density and the `` fudge '' function ( @xmath37 ) at the cluster s center ( mme99 ) .",
    "we use for the functional form of @xmath37 an inverse polynomial given as @xmath42 , where the best fit values within b@xmath26190 h@xmath33 kpc are @xmath43 , @xmath44 & @xmath45 .",
    "the surface brightness parameters used to derive the optical depth ( equation 7 ) are t@xmath28(r=5@xmath5 ) = 3.4 kev , v@xmath46(r=5@xmath5)=1600 km s@xmath4 ( db01 ) , @xmath35=0.57 , @xmath40=0.068 @xmath47 , r@xmath48=7.3@xmath5 ( mme99 ) . in all three plots",
    "the solid thick line shows the difference between the redshifted and blueshifted curves .",
    "it can be seen that the cmbr intensity variation difference ( figure 2 , top ) is maximized at 214 ghz ( @xmath49=0.14 cm ) .",
    "this is the optimal frequency to observe the relative kinetic s - z effect and consequently to determine a velocity map . at that frequency",
    "the difference between the relative variations of intensity and temperature are @xmath50 5 @xmath2 10@xmath51 and @xmath52 ( figure 2 middle and bottom plots ) .",
    "the magnitude of the parameters derived above are , naturally , a function of the projected radial distance from the cluster s center . in order to determine the radial profile of the expected @xmath53 at 214 ghz",
    "we make two assumptions ; firstly , we assume that in the region from 0@xmath5 to 5@xmath5 the cooling flow can be approximated by a linear function varying from 3.4 kev to 1 kev at the center .",
    "the flattening of the temperature profile at the cluster s center has been observed for some clusters with _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm _ , and may be a common feature of cooling flows ( fabian 2001 ) . in the case of centaurus",
    "there is evidence that the minimum temperature derived from spectral fittings using cooling flow models is @xmath8 0.4 - 1.0 kev ( sanders and fabian 2001 ) .",
    "the central arcmin in centaurus has an impressive amount of substructures ( plumes ) and this makes our estimation of the central densities more uncertain .",
    "therefore , we exclude that region from our analysis ( figure 3 ) .",
    "secondly , we assume the gas motion can be approximated by a solid body rotation .",
    "this functional form for the gas velocity can not be supported for larger radii since the gas becomes gravitationally unbound but it is a good observed first order approximation for the inner regions ( dupke & bregman 2002 ) .",
    "actually , this assumption is supposed to break at @xmath0 5 - 6@xmath5 , when the combined bulk kinetic and thermal energies become greater than the gravitational and the gas becomes unbound ( e.g. see allen & fabian 1994 ) . assuming that the velocity `` freezes '' at 1600 km  s@xmath4",
    ", we also show in figure 3 the predicted behavior of @xmath53 at regions radially greater than that encompassed by asca velocity analysis , for illustration purposes .",
    "the kinetic comptonization of the spectrum that reaches us from a rotating cluster is roughly antisymmetric with respect to the center of the cluster from @xmath0 160 - 270 ghz .",
    "this suggests that larger variations of intensity and temperature of the cmbr can be observationally enhanced by comparing the measurements ( in the same channel ) `` within '' the cluster , rather than to a background region away from the cluster .",
    "the results are maximized at 214 ghz and we show the distribution of cmb temperature variations ( @xmath54 ) at that frequency in figure 3 .",
    "the horizontal errors in figure 3 show the fwhm of bolocam .",
    "the solid lines represent the estimated 1-@xmath9 errors of measurement associated to the x - ray - derived parameters , and are dominated by x - ray velocity measurement errors .",
    "s - z measurements of radial velocities can be performed within these 1-@xmath9 limits with a relatively short exposure time ( see below ) .",
    "variations of intensity or temperature of that magnitude can be relatively easily observed currently , or in the very near future , with the new generation of bolometers .",
    "a total variation of cmb temperature of @xmath0 0.3 mk between the `` knees''in figure 3 is equivalent to a flux density of @xmath551.2 mjy  ( fwhm)@xmath56 , this could be done with high significance in a relatively short amount of time with , for example , _ bolocam _ , given that for that instrument the fwhm is 43@xmath57 and the _ expected _ noise equivalent flux density ( nefd ) is 35  mjy  hz@xmath58 at the 1.4 mm band is @xmath59 sec plus overhead](glenn et al .",
    "direct indications of the presence of large bulk motions in clusters of galaxies have been recently obtained through x - ray spatially resolved spectroscopy . however , these observations are limited by detector s gain fluctuations and this will continue to be the case for the next several years .",
    "an alternative way of measuring intracluster gas bulk velocities is through the use of the kinetic s - z effect .",
    "the use of bolometers has improved significantly the precision of radio observations of the s - z effect , especially within the optimal frequency range for such measurements , i.e. , @xmath0 214 ghz ( @xmath49 = 0.14 cm ) , so that , it will be possible in the near future to perform such velocity measurements in instruments such as _ bolocam _ ( bock et al 1998 ) with relatively short exposure times . the combination of x - ray and radio measurements can provide us with independent / complementary information crucial to build icm velocity maps and to determine the degree of evolution and the history of galaxy clusters .",
    "so far , the best candidate for testing the proposed multi - wavelength measurements of velocity gradients is the centaurus cluster .",
    "the symmetry of the gas velocity distribution and the low temperatures measured for this cluster should facilitate the separation of the rotational kinetic component from both thermal and peculiar velocity ones . by combining the analyses of intracluster gas velocity & temperature distributions with other relevant x - ray cluster characteristics we predict that the variations of cmbr temperature between two regions symmetrically located 5@xmath5 from the clusters center along the line of maximal velocity gradient at @xmath49 = 0.14 cm is @xmath00.3 mk .",
    "the magnitude of the s - z parameters observationally derived in this work , if typical , could significantly enhance possible halo - induced gas rotation contribution to the cmbr angular power spectrum ( cooray & chen 2002 ) .",
    "however , the limiting nature of the search for velocity gradients using current x - ray spectrometers tends to be biased towards clusters with high bulk velocities , so that the current data does not allow us yet to calculate precise velocity distributions and , consequently , to determine the deviations from the assumptions used in statistical analysis of the temperature anisotropies such as those performed by cooray & chen ( 2002 ) .",
    "furthermore , if both `` rotational '' and `` transient '' bulk velocities are as common in the central regions of clusters as suggested by a more extended asca analysis ( dupke & bregman 2002 ) , measurements of cluster peculiar velocities using the s - z effect should be treated with extreme caution , given the potential confusion with an internal gas bulk motion component .",
    "multiple off - center long exposure velocity measurements of intracluster gas with the _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ satellites coupled with radio observations of the differential kinetic s - z effect will be crucial to determine precise intracluster velocities in the central and intermediate regions of galaxy clusters , improving significantly the determination of their evolutionary stage , and constraining biases related to the presence of coherent velocity fields in blind s - z surveys .",
