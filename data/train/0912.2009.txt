    "typically , approaches like the slithering snake algorithm @xcite or various types of chain growth algorithms like perm @xcite are applied to sample such configurations .    a new class of monte carlo moves which takes advantage of destroying and reconnecting bonds",
    "was first suggested independently by mansfield @xcite and olaj and lantschbauer @xcite in 1982 . even though both papers focus on sampling ( polydisperse ) lattice melts , ref .",
    "@xcite also includes the so called backbite move which preserves monodispersity and can be applied to single chains as well .",
    "two additional bridging moves for single polymer chains on the lattice were subsequently introduced by deutsch in 1997 @xcite and have since been combined with schemes to sample free energy landscapes @xcite like wang - landau sampling @xcite .",
    "nowadays , a rather evolved set of bridging methods exists for off - lattice atomistic polymer melts @xcite , and one particular move was also ported to single chain simulations @xcite .",
    "apart from the obvious application of sampling static melt quantities , these moves are also applied to generate well - equilibrated starting configurations for subsequent molecular dynamics runs @xcite .",
    "our paper focuses on the efficient generation of globular off - lattice polymers . to this extent",
    "we adapt the three single chain bridging moves of mansfield and deutsch @xcite to continuum models .",
    "technical aspects of our implementation which further improve efficiency are also discussed . in the second part",
    "we test the performance of the moves and compare it to a standard implementation of the slithering snake algorithm .",
    "distinguishing independent configurations in globular states is a formidable task on its own as commonly used observables are typically unable to yield information about the topology of the chain . to this end ,",
    "we determine whether or not a globular state is knotted and compare the times which are required to generate `` topologically independent '' configurations .",
    "on a lattice , the number of neighbors of a particular monomer is always well - defined . in the continuum , we call two monomers neighbors if the distance @xmath1 between them is within a certain range @xmath2 . the basic idea of the backbite move is illustrated in figure  [ fig : begend ] .",

    "note that the selection probability for the reverse monte carlo move @xmath4 ( from @xmath5 to @xmath6 ) may be different from @xmath7 .",

    "@xcite deutsch proposes two additional moves for single chains in globular states , which were originally used to search for ground - states in the hp - model @xcite . both monte carlo moves cut and `` rewire '' the polymer internally , and have to our knowledge not been ported to a continuum model so far",
    "first , we recall deutsch s definition of parallel and anti - parallel bonds : two opposing strands along the chain made up of monomers @xmath14 and @xmath15 are named parallel if @xmath16 and anti - parallel if @xmath17 ( see figs .  [",

    "new bonds are always created between @xmath18 and @xmath19 and @xmath20 and @xmath21 , which need to be neighbors . when bonds are anti - parallel ( and not parallel as suggested in the original publication ) , we attempt a move of type i. likewise , if bonds are parallel we try a type ii move . for pedagogical reasons we will first discuss moves of type ii ( fig .  [",
    "fig : internal1 ] ) because they are easier to implement .",

    "one simply checks for neighboring bonds on the lattice and rejects the move if no adequate bond is present .",
    "figure [ fig : internal2 ] provides details on the long range move of type i. first we select one bond @xmath23 at random ( with probability @xmath24 ) and choose one of the neighboring anti - parallel bonds @xmath26 ( with probability @xmath33 ) .",
    "bonds @xmath22 between @xmath18 and @xmath20 and between @xmath26 between @xmath19 and @xmath21 are cut and reconnected to @xmath27 between @xmath18 and @xmath19 and @xmath28 between @xmath20 and @xmath21 such that the chain is split into a linear and a circular part .",

    "are stored in sequence in a double - linked list .",
    "this allows for an efficient detection of parallel and anti - parallel bonds for internal moves of type ii and i. even more importantly , we set up neighbor tables in which the neighbors of each monomer are stored .",
    "unfortunately , this neighbor table needs to be updated each time local moves , which are essential for the ergodicity of the algorithms , are attempted . in order to minimize these efforts",
    ", we always perform several local displacements for all particles before we return to a sequence of bridging moves .    as indicated in previous sections , the internal move of type i is by far the most complicated to implement because we need to take care of the chain separation in both linear and circular parts .",
    "the easiest move is implement is the backbite move followed by the internal bridging move of type ii .",
    "in the following we compare the performance of the moveset with an implementation of the slithering - snake algorithm @xcite : we choose with probability 0.5 one end of the chain and attempt to attach the end monomer to a random position at the opposite terminus without changing the bond length .",
    "our model system consists of a simple flexible lennard - jones + fene homopolymer @xcite with cut and shifted lennard - jones interactions between all monomers @xmath45   & \\text { , if } r < 2 \\sqrt[6]{2 } \\\\   0 & \\text { , otherwise } \\label{eqn : lj } \\end{cases}\\ ] ] and fene interactions between adjacent beads : @xmath46 . }",

    "[ eqn : lj ] and [ eqn : fene ] , the energy difference in the metropolis criterion of the bridging moves only consists of changes in the bond energy as the position of the particles are only altered by local moves .",
    "all simulations took place at @xmath47 , which corresponds to @xmath48 ( for a chain of infinite length @xcite . ) therefore , for @xmath49 to @xmath0 only globular states are observed .    in an attempt to gauge the efficiency of the three bridging moves",
    ", we determined whether or not a particular globule is unknotted by calculating the alexander polynomial @xcite .",
    "note that mathematically knots are only well - defined in closed curves .",
    "however , if we connect the ends of an open chain in a well - defined manner we can still obtain corresponding information about the `` knottedness '' of the globule . ref .",
    "@xcite provides details on this topic as well as on our implementation of the alexander polynomial .",
    "the particular closure used in this work is described in ref .",
    "@xcite . to quantify the number of independent configurations generated by the bridging algorithms we measured the correlation times between unknotted configurations @xcite : @xmath50 where @xmath51 an `` independent configuration '' is defined by the decrease of the auto - correlation function to @xmath52 .",
    "note that our approach is particularly well - suited for the task of comparing bridging moves as it focuses on changes in topology and self - entanglements . in our current implementation",
    "neither bridging moves nor slithering snake moves are ergodic because they do not alter bond lengths .",
    "therefore , it becomes necessary to combine the algorithms with local monte carlo moves : in our case , each simulation run spent 26 @xmath53 of the time with local displacements .",
    "[ fig : unknottingpercentage ] shows the percentage of unknotted configurations for chain lengths ranging from @xmath49 up to @xmath0 : for @xmath49 roughly 90 % of all configurations are unknotted , for @xmath0 only 20 % are unknotted @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : performance1]a shows the number of generated configurations per minute divided by our estimate for the geometric correlation time as a function of chain length .",
    "all configurations were created on a single core of a core2quad q6700 processor running at 3.33 ghz .",
    "figure  [ fig : performance1]b shows the same data normalized by the results for the slithering snake moves .",
    "note that the time - limiting step in this analysis is not the generation of globular states but the subsequent knot analysis which took place on a supercomputer .",
    "for chains larger than @xmath54 all bridging moves become more efficient than slithering snake moves .",
    "the internal bridging move of type ii is the most efficient followed by the backbite move and the internal move of type i. if we consider that the latter is by far the most difficult to code among the three , we do not recommend its implementation .",
    "interestingly , the time to generate an `` independent configuration '' appears to be almost independent of chain length for type ii and backbite moves , whereas it increases rapidly for slithering snake moves as expected .",
    "finally , it is worth noting that combinations of moves may even yield better results .",
    "a combination of internal ii and backbite moves is about two orders of magnitude faster for @xmath0 than slithering snake moves .",
    "the aim of this paper is threefold .",
    "first , we have implemented three efficient lattice bridging moves for single flexible globular homopolymer chains in a continuum model , and discussed difficulties arising from the implementation . in an attempt to measure performance we determined correlation times between unknotted globular states . to our knowledge",
    "this is the first time in which topology is considered to gauge the efficiency of global monte carlo moves . from this analysis ,",
    "we conclude that all bridging moves become more efficient than slithering snake moves for chains larger than @xmath54 monomers . among the three moves ,",
    "the internal bridging move of type ii is the most successful .",
    "the most complicated move ( internal i ) performs worst and we do not recommend its implementation . for @xmath0",
    "a combination of backbiting and internal bridging moves of type ii is two orders of magnitude faster than our implementation of the slithering snake move .    the exact speed ",
    "up factors should , however , be taken with a grain of salt and rather serve as a guideline .",
    "long - range correlations , which are only relaxed by local moves , were e.g. not considered , and results also depend a lot on the model under consideration . if chain stiffness is included @xcite , efficiency will drop , and results will also deteriorate if the implementation does not include look - up tables .",
    "nonetheless , we believe to have demonstrated that bridging algorithms are indeed the method of choice for the simulation of long globular polymers in the continuum .",
