    "using new observational and analytical techniques , it has recently been shown that high magnification events may be readily detected , including events with very high magnifications ( bond _ et al .",
    "_ , 2002b ) . here",
    "we discuss the detectability of planets in this new class of events using 1-m class telescopes , including :    * critical observational period for planet detection * zones of detectability of terrestrial and giant planets * detectability of habitable planets and solar - system analogues .",

    "we consider the lensing of a source star by a lens star where the lens star is assumed to have a planet or planets orbiting it not dissimilar to those in our solar system . to first order , the lensing by such a system can be approximated by the lens star alone . in this case",
    "the lensing can be parametrised in terms of the einstein radius @xmath4 and crossing time @xmath5 where    @xmath6    and @xmath7    @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the observer - lens and lens - source distances respectively and @xmath10 .",
    "we see that @xmath11 au and @xmath12 days for bulge events when the lens mass @xmath13 , @xmath14kpc , @xmath15 kpc .",
    "the transverse velocity , @xmath16 , of the lens with respect to the observer - source line of sight is taken as @xmath17 @xmath18 .",
    "high magnification occurs when the lens and source stars are well aligned , i.e. when the impact parameter @xmath19 . in this case",
    "@xmath20 a useful quantity in high magnification events is the time of full - width - half - maximum with respect to the peak given by : @xmath21",
    "liebes ( 1964 ) discussed several features of gravitational microlensing events with magnifications up to @xmath22 , and remarked that planets orbiting the lens stars in these events would perturb the light curves .",
    "griest & safizadeh ( 1998 ) subsequently computed the perturbations for a variety of high magnification configurations , and showed that the probability for detecting planets in these events is high .",
    "in particular , they showed that planets with masses as low as @xmath23 could be detected with significant probability in events with magnifications @xmath24 by monitoring the peaks of the events with a photometric precision @xmath25 .",
    "it has subsequently been shown that events with magnification up to @xmath26 are quite readily detectable , and also that intensive photometric monitoring of the peaks of these events with a precision significantly better than @xmath27 is feasible ( bond _ et al .",
    "_ , 2002a ; bond _ et al .",
    "_ , 2002b ) . consequently the prospects for planet detection have improved .    in this section",
    "we examine typical light curves for events of higher magnification , to determine the basic requirements for planet detection .",
    "the light curves presented here , and indeed throughout the paper , were generated using a rapid version of the inverse ray shooting method ( schneider & wei , 1986 ; kayser , refsdal & stabell , 1986 ; wambsganss , 1997 ) . the technique was implemented on a @xmath26 node cluster computer at the university of auckland ( dobcsnyi , 1999 ) .",
    "a further improvement in the code runtime is described in appendix a.    in figure [ fig : library ] we show a selection of light curves for a typical lens system consisting of a star with a single planet in a typical event of high magnification .",
    "the fractional difference light curves are plotted : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the light curve of the lens star including its planet and @xmath30 is the light curve of the lens star alone .",
    "the planet - star mass ratio of the lens is @xmath31 .",
    "this corresponds to a planet of four earth masses orbiting a @xmath32 mass star , the most probable lens mass .",
    "the maximum magnification is @xmath33 .",
    "the radius of the source star , @xmath34 , has been set equal to @xmath35 , as is done throughout this paper unless otherwise stated .",
    "the projected orbital radius of the planet at the time of the lensing event is @xmath36 or @xmath37au .",
    "the lens geometry is shown in figure [ fig : coords ] .",
    "it is clear from figure [ fig : library ] that the position angle of a planet at the time of lensing may be determined from the light curve .",
    "this follows because the peak deviation occurs at the point on the source star track when it is crossed by the planet - star axis .",
    "thus the position angle @xmath38 is given by the equation @xmath39 where @xmath40 denotes the time of maximum planetary deviation .",
    "equation [ eq : tp ] implies that , provided @xmath38 is not within @xmath41 of either @xmath42 or @xmath43 , then @xmath40 lies in the interval @xmath0 $ ] .",
    "it follows that for two - thirds of all planetary positions , the perturbations they produce to the microlensing light curve occur in the very restricted time interval @xmath0 $ ] .",
    "this is the critical time for planet searches .",
    "[ ] [ ] planet at @xmath44 =    figure [ fig : shapes ] shows typical examples of deviations produced by planets of different masses and at different projected radii . in general , heavier planets",
    "produce larger deviations , as do planets nearer the einstein ring .",
    "the shapes of the deviations are also dependent on these properties .",
    "it is thus possible to determine both the mass and the projected radius of a planet from the deviation to the light curve . in section [ sec : accuracy ]",
    "we discuss the precision with which this may be achieved .",

    "planetary zones of detectability in high magnification events were determined by comparing simulated perturbations to microlensing light curves produced by planets of various mass and at various projected radii with minimum detectable perturbations .",
    "each simulated planetary light curve was comprised of @xmath46 evenly spaced points in the critical time interval @xmath1 . in order to simulate the observation process",
    ", noise was added to the simulated light curves . as a representative example , we assumed observations of 200s duration were made with a 1 m telescope in a passband of 200 nm . in this case , the number of detected photons per exposure is given by the expression ( eccles 1983 ) :    @xmath47    where @xmath48 denotes the telescope throughput .",
    "the number at any magnification , given a maximum magnification , @xmath49@xmath50 , is : @xmath51 if we assume poisson statistics , the photon noise , @xmath52 , is @xmath53^{-\\frac{1}{2}}$ ] . using equations [ eq : flux ] and [ eq : noise1 ] ,",
    "this becomes : @xmath54^{-\\frac{1}{2 } } \\label{eq : noise2}\\ ] ] where @xmath55 is the magnitude at peak magnification .",
    "equation [ eq : noise2 ] defines our noise function for any light curve with peak amplification @xmath49@xmath50 and peak magnitude @xmath56 .",
    "the minimum error that the difference imaging technique can achieve is typically : @xmath57 because it involves the difference of two similar quantities . in what follows we assumed @xmath58 and gaussian noise with @xmath59",
    "this implies @xmath60 at the peak of a light curve with @xmath61 , consistent with the results reported by bond ( 2002a ) .      for each light curve @xmath62was computed using the single lens light curve",
    "this was compared to @xmath63 , the value obtained from data without any planetary signal . a deviation in the light curve was considered detectable if the difference between these two values , @xmath64 , was greater than 60 .",
    "figure [ fig : limits_ex ] shows the positions for an earth - mass planet which give @xmath65",
    ". the threshold value of 60 was chosen because it corresponds to @xmath66 consecutive deviations of 1 - 2@xmath67 ( bond _ et al .",
    "_ , 2002a ) . for events with @xmath68 ,",
    "the total number of measurements that can be made in the time interval @xmath69 $ ] is @xmath70 assuming parameters as above and a readout time between exposures of the ccd camera @xmath71 secs .",
    "if measurements are made over the interval @xmath72 $ ] , then @xmath73 measurements may be anticipated .",
    "the probability for a random fluctuation to yield @xmath65 is @xmath74 for 300 measurements , and @xmath75 for 600 measurements .",
    "however , any random fluctuation will be easily identifiable in any densely sampled light curve , because it will not produce a coherent perturbation .",

    "following kasting ( 1993 ) and wetherill ( 1996 ) , and allowing for internal heat sources such as long - lived radionuclides ( perryman , 2000 ) , we assumed  see table [ tab : hzs ]  the following limits for the habitable zone around a star of approximately solar mass : @xmath78 au .",

    "these are typical values for real events , but they will be subject to large event - to - event variations in real cases . a complete analysis of the data for actual events will require direct knowledge of these parameters . also , observations of an event during the critical time @xmath1 only , although sensitive to the presence of planets , will not suffice to determine accurately the value of @xmath49for an event . knowledge of this quantity is required to quantify planetary parameters .",
    "additional measurements will be needed in actual events to determine the values of the above parameters .",
    "the distance to the source star @xmath81 may be determined approximately from the measurements described above for determining its radius .",
    "the remaining quantities may be evaluated by directly observing the lens and source stars a few years after a microlensing event , when they have diverged sufficiently to be resolved ( alcock _ et al _ , 2001 ) .",
    "multi - passband photometry of the lens star would enable its type and mass @xmath82 to be determined , and also its distance @xmath8 approximately .",
    "at the same time , the baseline intensity of the source star could be accurately measured , and @xmath49evaluated accurately .",
    "these measurements would provide absolute values of all microlensing parameters of the event .",

    "this quantity could be better constrained through direct measurement of @xmath16 and use of the equation @xmath85 .",
    "the net result of these measurements would be the absolute determination of the mass and projected orbital radius of any detected planet , and also the identification of its host star type .",
    "we note , however , that a telescope with capabilities approaching that of the vlt interferometer may be required .",
    "additional information on the parameters @xmath81 , @xmath8 , and @xmath82 may be obtained through parallax measurements ( refsdal , 1966 ; gould , 1995 ; holz & wald , 1996 ) .",
    "these would be most useful if carried out from a satellite in a distant ( solar ) orbit .",
    "as depicted in figure [ fig : parallax ] , the source , lens and earth may then be treated as collinear at the time of peak magnification for a high magnification event .",
    "the amplification as detected by the satellite at this time could be determined from the light curve recorded by the satellite .",
    "this would yield the impact parameter @xmath86 of the lens at this time as seen from the satellite relative to the einstein ring radius of the lens @xmath4 .",
    "also , the baseline @xmath87 of the satellite could be determined from the satellite s orbit .",
    "these quantities would then satisfy the parallax equation :    @xmath88    equation [ eq : parallax ] could be used to constrain the parameters @xmath81 , @xmath8 and @xmath82 .",
    "dominik ( 1998 ) first studied the effect of orbital motion of a binary lens during a microlensing event .",
    "it is generally held that for most planetary microlensing events , the effect of the orbital motion of the planet around the lens star will be negligible .",
    "this assumption appears particularly safe for high magnification events , where the critical observation time @xmath1 is so short . to confirm this we determined typical parameters for which planetary motion during the peak of an event would be detectable .",
    "a face - on planetary system was assumed with a @xmath32 lens star and a jupiter mass planet , @xmath89 orbiting at @xmath90 .",
    "these parameters correspond to a `` hot jupiter '' orbiting a typical lens star .",
    "the light curve shows a clear deviation from a model with a static planet , see figure [ fig : dynshow ] .",
    "the light curve perturbation due to a moving planet is seen to be broader ( narrower ) than that for a static planet when the direction of the source star is in the same ( opposite ) as the moving intersection of the planet - star axis with the source star track .",
    "the simulation was repeated for a jupiter mass planet at @xmath36 , using @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "similar results were obtained , with the broadening effect apparent during the whole peak perturbation .",
    "the first planned searches for planets using the microlensing technique were not based on the high magnification technique that has been described here ( albrow _ et al . _ , 1996 ; pratt _ et al . _ , 1996 ) .",
    "rather , they were based on the well - known `` caustic crossing '' technique ( mao & paczyski , 1991 ; gould & loeb , 1992 ; bolatto & falco , 1994 ; bennett & rhie , 1996 ; wambsganss , 1997 ; bozza , 1999 ) .",
    "caustic crossing events , in which the light curve undergoes large , rapid changes in amplification , can yield a great deal of information about the lens system and the source star .",
    "however , even if a planet is known to be in the lens system , the probability for a caustic crossing to occur is low .",
    "moreover , the time of occurrence of the caustic crossing is unpredictable . for these reasons ,",
    "the observational study of planets by the caustic crossing technique has proved to be difficult . as a practical technique ,",
    "it is preferable to be able to concentrate telescope resources during a short well - defined time period , rather than over a longer , indeterminate period .",
    "this is especially true for ground - based telescopes that are being used for several purposes .",
    "ultimately , a wide - angle space - borne telescope dedicated to microlensing could achieve the greatest sensitivity , by continuously monitoring a very large number of main sequence stars .",
    "this would yield sensitivity to terrestrial planets over a significantly wider range of orbital radii than the high magnification technique can achieve . the galactic exoplanet survey telescope ( gest )",
    "has been proposed to exploit this capability ( bennett & rhie , 2002 ) .    in order to further compare the caustic crossing and high magnification techniques , we estimated relative frequencies of planetary detections that may occur with and without caustic crossings in events of high magnification . from the perturbative analysis of bozza ( 1999 ) ,",
    "the caustic curve maps for a range of single planet lens systems were generated , varying planet position , mass and the minimum impact parameter , @xmath93 .",
    "for each set of planet parameters , it was determined if a caustic crossing occurred at any time within the interval @xmath94 $ ] .",
    "a solar radius source star was used . in order to preserve the perturbative nature of the analysis of bozza , parameter sets where the first order perturbative term exceeded 0.05",
    "were ignored .",
    "an example image of the results obtained in this analysis is shown in figure [ fig : caustic_map ] .",
    "the positions where the source star track crosses a planetary and/or the central caustic are shown . from this",
    "it is evident that nearly all planetary detections in high magnification events will not involve caustic crossings .",
    "the investigations presented here provide further support for the practicality of studying planetary systems in gravitational microlensing events of high magnification , including planets with masses as low as that of earth .",
    "it has been shown that the perturbations produced by planets with position angles @xmath95 or @xmath96 with respect to the source star track occur in the restricted time interval @xmath0 $ ] about the peak of the light curve . here , @xmath97 , and",
    "is typically @xmath2 hours when @xmath68 .",
    "this implies that the planetary deviations of two thirds of all planets occur in this relatively restricted time interval , a significant advantage for carrying out practical observations .",
    "it has also been demonstrated that the position angle of a planet is simply related to the time and sign of the perturbation it produces on the light curve , and that its mass and projected orbit radius may be determined from the height and shape of the planetary deviation , provided the radius of the source star can be determined independently .",
    "it has been shown that earth - mass planets are typically detectable with 1-m class telescopes provided they lie within about @xmath98 of the einstein ring radius of the lens star , i.e. from about 1.5 - 2.5 au .",
    "neptune - mass are typically detectable provided they lie beyond about 0.8 au , and jupiter - mass planets are detectable almost anywhere .",
    "these zones of detectability , whilst large , only marginally include planets in the `` habitable zone '' .",
    "it was also shown that nearly all planetary detections in high magnification events will not involve caustic crossings .",
    "multi - planet systems can be systematically characterised . to a good approximation",
    ", the joint perturbation is the sum of the individual perturbations of the component planets .",
    "this approximation may be used as a first approximation in planetary modelling .",
    "source star effects have been investigated .",
    "the main effect is the size of the source star .",
    "this may be able to be determined by multi - passband photometry carried out during the course of a microlensing event .",
    "the effects of spots on the source star are likely to be negligible . the effect of orbital motion of a planet during a microlensing event has also been investigated . in most cases",
    "this is entirely negligible , although in the case of hot jupiters it is likely to be significant .",
    "follow - up observations carried out a few years after a microlensing event when the lens and source stars are resolvable should suffice to characterize the parameters of any detected planet , and its host star , absolutely .    finally , we have found that the numerical inverse ray shooting technique for analysing microlensing events can be conveniently carried out on a cluster computer , and that complicated physical situations can thereby be rapidly simulated .",
