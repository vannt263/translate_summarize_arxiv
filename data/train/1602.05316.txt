    "the history of the josephson junction began with brian josephson s paper in 1962 @xcite .",
    "the 50th anniversary of this discovery was marked at the 2012 applied superconductivity conference in portland or .    at its simplest ,",
    "a josephson junction consists of two superconductors separated by a very thin barrier , typically an oxide of a superconducting material .",
    "figure [ jj ] shows a typical thin film junction .",
    "the nb electrodes each have a small finger , and these fingers overlap to form a josephson junction from the sandwich of nb top and bottom , and the oxide in between . in the most successful fabrication technology @xcite",
    "the oxide is @xmath0 thermally grown over a thin aluminum layer wetting the nb bottom layer .",
    "the two bulk superconducting electrodes can be viewed phenomenologically as possessing separate macroscopic wavefunctions @xmath1 and @xmath2 , as indicated in the figure , whose phase difference @xmath3 is @xmath4 .",
    "josephson predicted that a supercurrent could flow through the junction without any associated voltage - the expression for this supercurrent being    @xmath5    if a voltage does exist across the junction , then the phase is governed by @xmath6for small junctions , those two equations comprise a complete specification of the junction dynamics . a typical current - voltage characteristic of a @xmath7 josephson tunnel junction having a zero - voltage supercurrent of few hundreds microampres is shown in fig .",
    "[ iv ] .    a surprising fact implied by the above equations",
    "is that the existence of the josephson effect requires only a pair of superconducting electrodes - the choice of specific materials plays no role other than to affect the critical current @xmath8 . as illustrated in fig.[solymar ] , this critical current rises as the junction temperature drops and saturates at low temperatures @xcite .",
    "the data in this plot are taken from fiske and the theoretical curves are from @xcite .",
    "therefore , well below the transition temperature of the films there would be no additional temperature dependence in a josephson device .",
    "relevant and fundamental observations on the nature of the josephson phase difference and associated energy / potential were reported by p. w. anderson @xcite    in 1980 leggett @xcite postulated that , at sufficiently low temperatures , the phase of a josephson junction would take on the attributes of a macroscopic quantum coordinate .",
    "since then , over the following decades , experimental and theoretical work has been reported demonstrating evidence that a quantum interpretation of experiments performed at low temperatures on josephson junctions is possible .",
    "later we will duly reference and analyze several of these experiments which are complex and sophisticated and were performed bearing in mind the idea that at very low temperatures a macroscopic quantum description was necessary .",
    "it is our opinion , however , that * decisive * confirmation of the macroscopic quantum hypothesis requires an experiment ( or many experiments ) whose results * can not be explained * in other terms .",
    "in particular , it is known that there exists ( and already existed in the early 80 s indeed ) a whole field of research on nonlinear circuits and applied superconductivity in which the josephson phase is treated as a classical continuum variable in the sense specified by p. w. anderson @xcite .",
    "we will herein refer to this approach as the `` classical '' approach .",
    "thus the necessity of new quantum interpretation of experiments would be mandatory in case these experiments can not be explained by the classical approach . in this review",
    "we consider a number of key experiments that were initially claimed to unequivocally verify the quantum hypothesis .",
    "we use data extracted from those publications to very carefully reconsider the matter using the classical josephson junction model applied to the specific conditions of each experiment .    in the next section",
    "we review shortly the features of the classical model of josephson junctions and circuits and successively we turn to a set of essentially defining experiments and examine in detail the evidence for and against both the classical and quantum interpretations .",
    "in the 1968 a very simple equivalent circuit , depicted in fig.[rcsj ] , for a josephson junction was proposed by w.j .",
    "johnson ( pp122 - 124 , barone ) , d.e .",
    "mccumber , and w.c .",
    "stewart , @xcite .",
    "this circuit @xcite captures the essential ingredients of a real josephson device .",
    "it is comprised of three parallel elements : a shunt resistor r , a shunt capacitor c , and a pure josephson element usually labeled here with a bowtie graphic  the rcsj model .",
    "the rcsj equivalent circuit for a josephson junction has proven to be exceptionally successful in modeling the dynamics of the josephson systems .",
    "the current through a josephson element is given by @xmath9 and the voltage across the parallel combination is governed by @xmath10 . with a total applied bias current @xmath9 ,",
    "the phase dynamics are governed by    @xmath11    if time is normalized to @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the zero - bias josephson plasma frequency , then    @xmath14    where @xmath15 is a normalized bias current and @xmath16 is a normalized loss coefficient .",
    "a josephson junction with phase @xmath4 has stored energy is @xmath17 .",
    "the pre - factor in this expression is the josephson energy :    @xmath18      the total potential energy of a junction , when an additional bias current is supplied , is @xcite    @xmath19    in this form it is apparent that the phase dynamics can be viewed in terms of a fictitious ` particle ' whose coordinate is @xmath20 , moving in a washboard potential , as indicated in fig.[fig1 ] .    in this analog , at zero bias the potential is a horizontal washboard and a ` particle ' would sit at the bottom of the well at @xmath21 .",
    "small oscillations around the minimum of that well occur at the plasma frequency @xmath22 . at non - zero values of the bias : ( 1 ) the washboard tilts ( 2 ) the minimum of the well occupied by the particle shifts to @xmath23 ( 3 ) the wells in the washboard potential become progressively shallower , with correspondingly smaller plasma frequencies , @xmath24 , disappearing altogether at a bias equal to the junction critical current .      for larger oscillation amplitudes ,",
    "the well shape becomes increasingly anharmonic and oscillations will occur at a frequencies slightly lower than the small amplitude values given by @xmath25 .",
    "this can be expressed approximately as    @xmath26 \\sqrt{1-\\left ( \\frac{% \\eta } { j_{0}(a)}\\right ) ^{2 } } }   \\label{eq12}\\ ] ]    where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are bessel functions of the first kind and @xmath29 is the amplitude of the oscillation .",
    "a ` large ' amplitude oscillation would take the phase from the minimum position of a well to the inflection point of that well . in this case",
    "the amplitude can be approximated by@xmath30(see @xcite ) . at the critical bias @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "for bias currents less than unity , the anharmonic plasma frequency is slightly smaller than the harmonic value .",
    "the barrier height @xmath34 for the washboard potential , indicated in fig [ fig2 ] , is controlled by the bias current @xmath35 and is given by eq.eq5    @xmath36   \\label{eq5}\\ ] ]    if noise is present , then the ` particle ' can hop out of the well and bounce down the washboard , as illustrated above . for thermal activation ,",
    "the escape rate at temperature @xmath37 is given by    @xmath38    where @xmath39 is an attempt frequency .",
    "so if a constant bias is applied , escape is inevitable , but for a shallow well it will happen sooner than for a deep well .    because @xmath40 , this bouncing motion is accompanied by an oscillating but always positive junction voltage .",
    "modeling some types of experiment , those involving junctions in superconducting circuits , can be done by determining the junction phase dynamics from eq .",
    "[ eq1 ] while other types , those based on activation processes , can be addressed with eq .",
    "[ eq2 ] .      equation [ eq1 ] is isomorphic to the equation that governs the motion of a driven pendulum , as depicted in fig.[simplependulum ] .    for the pendulum , the equation of motion is@xmath41where",
    "@xmath42 is the mass of the bob , @xmath43 is the length of the suspension , @xmath44 is the rotational moment of inertia ( @xmath45 in the case of a simple pendulum ) , @xmath46 is the damping , and @xmath47 is the net appied torque .  the potential energy of this system for a displacement angle @xmath48 and an applied torque @xmath47 is@xmath49this , of course , is the washboard potential of eq.[eq4 ] and fig.fig1 .",
    "a mechanical analog such as this helps to visualize the behavior of a josephson junction .",
    "for example , increasing the applied torque will increase the pendulum angle until it reaches @xmath50 at which point a minute additional applied twist , or noise , will cause the pendulum to flip over the top and then spin - i.e. bounce down the washboard .",
    "this critical torque , @xmath51 , plays the role of the critical current @xmath8 in the junction .",
    "also , at zero - torque the frequency of small oscillations about the down position is the familiar @xmath52 . which is the analog of the josephson zero - bias plasma frequency with the correspondence : @xmath53 .",
    "but if these oscillations have a large motion side - to - side with an amplitude @xmath54 then the period becomes    @xmath55    where the right hand side is an elliptic integral of the first kind ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this period becomes larger than the small angle value as the amplitude of the oscillations increases , and so the anharmonic frequency diminishes accordingly .",
    "the analog of a constant current bias of a josephson junction is a constant torque applied to the pendulum . for any applied torque @xmath56",
    ", the pendulum will have a stable position at an angle somewhere between @xmath57 and @xmath50 .",
    "any perturbation will cause oscillations around that stable point .",
    "as with the josephson junction , the frequency of small oscillations would scale with the applied torque.@xmath58{1-\\left ( \\gamma /\\gamma _ { c}\\right ) ^{2 } } \\label{pendfrequency}\\]]but for larger induced oscillations around the stable angle , an expression similar to eq.[eq12 ] would apply .",
    "the usual experimental approach to measuring activation involves _ sweeping _ the bias current upward from zero .",
    "early in the sweep , the well is deep ; late in the sweep the well becomes quite shallow .",
    "thermal activation is easier from a shallow well .",
    "but in addition , as the bias is swept , the plasma frequency drops and thus the rate of escape attempts decreases .",
    "the interplay of these two factors determines the net escape rate for the momentary bias current .",
    "when the bias current is _ repeatedly _ ramped up from zero , at a given temperature , for each sweep the value of the bias current when the junction switches to the finite voltage state is recorded .",
    "the distribution of these accumulated escape events forms a switching current distribution ( scd ) peak whose two key attributes are position and width ; this is the primary form of experimental data .",
    "a method for simulating the escape process seen in an experiment was described in @xcite .",
    "the method begins with an ensemble of @xmath59 junctions .",
    "the bias on all junctions starts at @xmath57 and is incremented in @xmath60 steps , with each step of duration @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the sweep frequency .",
    "each step is assigned a channel , and the total counts in that channel indicates how many junctions have switched to the finite - voltage state ( escaped from a potential well ) during that interval . as the bias sweep proceeds , the original ensemble will have lost @xmath63 junctions in the first interval , @xmath64 junctions in the second interval , and so forth .",
    "consequently , at the beginning of the @xmath65 bias interval , there will be @xmath66 junctions not yet escaped .",
    "the number from this remaining pool of junctions that will escape during the next interval@xmath67 will be    @xmath68 \\,\\gamma ( t_{n})\\delta t,\\quad n=2,3\\cdots n   \\label{eq7}\\ ] ]    where @xmath69 is the probability of escape per unit time in the @xmath70 interval .",
    "of course , the initial interval just satisfies :    @xmath71    these two equations will mimic a swept - bias experiment provided a suitable expression is available for the escape rate @xmath72 .    for the case of thermal activation ( ta ) out of the potential",
    "well at the @xmath73stage , the escape rate is    @xmath74    where @xmath75 is the josephson plasma frequency in the @xmath65 bias interval and @xmath76 is the height of the potential barrier divided by the mean thermal energy .",
    "so from eq .",
    "[ eq2 ] with @xmath77 indicating the bias current at the @xmath70 step normalized to the junction critical current , @xmath78   \\label{eq10}\\ ] ]    to perform a simulation , only three parameters must be known : the critical current of the junction @xmath8 , the bias sweep frequency @xmath62 , and the temperature @xmath37 .",
    "values must be chosen for the number of channels @xmath60 and for the ensemble number @xmath59 ; these are arbitrary ",
    "large numbers improve precision but slow the computation slightly .",
    "typical choices were : @xmath79 .",
    "it is worth noting that a number of papers reported on successful investigations of potentials of specific josephson junctions systems by using thermal escape techniques in parallel with rcsj simulations .",
    "these analyses were concerned with extended josephson junctions @xcite , dc - squid systems @xcite and step - edge junctions @xcite of high tc superconductors .",
    "the concept of crossover temperature was introduced by affleck @xcite in the attempt to distinguish between classical and quantum fluctuations in one - dimensional potentials  in terms of josephson quantum narrative , in the vicinity of the crossover temperature , the mechanism for escape to a finite voltage state changes from thermal activation ( ta ) to macroscopic quantum tunneling ( mqt ) .",
    "because the mqt tunneling rate is * not * temperature dependent , the position and width of scd peaks must both saturate at low temperatures .    as discussed earlier ,",
    "the classical escape rate for thermal activation is @xmath80 . for the case of escape via macroscopic quantum tunneling , the rate is given by ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath81 } \\\\   { a_{q}\\approx\\left [ 120\\pi\\left ( \\frac{7.2\\delta u}{hf_{j}}\\right ) \\right ] ^{1/2}}% \\end{array } \\label{eq18}\\ ] ]    the crossover temperature may be defined by the condition that the escape rate for thermal activation equals the escape rate for mqt , which is@xmath82 \\label{eq19}\\ ] ]    and so    @xmath83    with the usual assumptions : @xmath84 and@xmath85 .",
    "therefore    @xmath86    the josephson plasma frequency is bias - dependent because the curvature of the well is also bias - dependent .",
    "for example , in the harmonic approximation , @xmath87 .",
    "switching current distributions ( scd ) are acquired by repeatedly sweeping the bias current at a specified temperature ; consequently throughout any scan the ta escape rate varies only because of the changing bias .",
    "for each temperature , there will be a different scd peak . in comparison , because the mqt escape rate is independent of temperature , only a single peak should be seen .",
    "figure [ fig23 ] shows simulation results based on experimental data from @xcite .",
    "it can be seen that the mqt scd peak falls exactly on a ta scd peak at just one particular temperature  that defines the crossover temperature .",
    "note that the value of the bias of this special peak is not zero , and so the plasma frequency @xmath88 will be smaller than @xmath89 . because any peak position is never known _ a priori _ , the expression for the crossover temperature can only be used as an approximation with @xmath90 .",
    "suppose for example , an experimental scsd peak happened to occur at a normalized bias of @xmath91 .",
    "then @xmath92 and so the anticipated crossover temperature would be a fraction of the value obtained using @xmath93 . taking as an example a crossover temperature quoted at @xmath94 _ mk _ , the ` true ' value could be @xmath95 _ mk_. the higher the peak position , the larger the discrepancy . most cryostats bottom out at around @xmath96 _ mk _ meaning the acquired data do not reach very far below the presumed crossover value .",
    "we conclude that there is not much room to show unambiguous experimental confirmation of an mqt transition in josephson junctions .",
    "[ [ voss - and - webb ] ] voss and webb    the pivotal moment in the history of switching current distributions measured at millikelvin temperatures was the 1981 paper by voss and webb @xcite .",
    "they presented experimentally recorded scd peaks for 11 selected temperatures .",
    "their figure is shown here ( fig [ fig3 ] ) together with results from an rcsj simulation based on the thermal - activation escape rate given in eq.[eq9 ] .",
    "the simulation is clearly in excellent agreement with experiment , but a precise test is not possible because full details of the bias sweep were not given ; the text says only that a low - frequency sinusoidal current ( amplitude @xmath97 ) was applied to the junction and the distribution of currents at which the junction switched out of the superconducting state was measured .",
    "the current - sweeps were stipulated as being in the range @xmath98 .",
    "peak positions , especially at high bias values , are known to be sensitive to the shape and speed of the bias sweep .",
    "the peak width data from voss and webb @xcite for the sample with critical current @xmath99 are shown in fig.[fig24 ] .",
    "note the choice of a log scale for temperature .",
    "again , this set the standard for presentations of experimental data ( however see the appendix ) . from this figure data points",
    "were extracted and then re - plotted as shown in the right panel .",
    "this illustrates a crucial point : the choice of a logarithmic temperature axis makes it appear that there is a flattening .",
    "the linear plot of the same data , shown here , makes it very clear that saturation of the peak width below @xmath100 has * not * occurred .",
    "the fact that the trend in the data is not towards the origin is discussed in the section : effective temperature .    since the paper by voss and webb @xcite , many other swept bias experiments have been reported . a typical example from",
    "three decades later is the following .",
    "[ [ yu - et - al . ] ] yu et al .",
    "@xcite carried out swept bias experiments on a junction with a critical current of @xmath101 and a bias sweep rate of @xmath102 ma / s ; the observed scd peaks are shown in fig.[fig4 ] .",
    "an rcsj simulation was applied to this experiment @xcite ; representative simulation scd peaks are also shown .    from figure 2 in",
    "@xcite the experimental peak positions ( blue squares ) were digitized and are plotted in figure [ yupeakpositions ] .  clearly , there is a suggestion of levelling off at low temperatures , however this impression is exaggerated by the choice of a logarithmic temperature scale .",
    "just replacing the log scale with a linear scale produces the result shown in fig.[correction ] ( a ) .",
    "clearly the peak positions deviate from the expectations of a fully classical ta escape process ( dashed line ) and the deviation increases as the temperature is lowered .",
    "nevertheless , it is quite apparent that the peak positions have not decisively saturated at the lowest temperatures .",
    "a resolution of this difficulty can be found in choosing any specific peak , and noticing that the experimentally reported temperature is not the same as the temperature of an identical classical peak , as indicated by the construction lines in fig.[correction ] ( a ) .    in other words , it is the effective sample temperature that ought to be used in the escape rate @xmath103to give correct peak positions ( and widths ) .",
    "our definition of @xmath104 is essentially the same as the escape temperature @xmath105 introduced in 1985 by devoret , martinis , and clarke @xcite and repeated in several subsequent papers . with the bath temperature replaced by the effective temperature , the earlier plot changes to fig.[correction](b ) which shows excellent agreement between experimental data and predictions of thermal activation theory .",
    "the experimentally reported temperatures are , in reality , the measured mixing chamber temperatures .",
    "the effective temperatures refer to the junctions themselves . a plot of @xmath106 ( see fig.correction ( c ) ) highlights the degree to which the junction temperature rises above the bath temperature .",
    "even more revealing is a plot , fig.[correction ] ( d ) , derived from the previous graph , of the difference between the effective ( junction ) temperature and the bath temperature as a function of bath temperature .",
    "the junction temperature is seen to begin rising above the bath temperature below about @xmath107 and this behavior is mirrored in the temperature dependence of the thermal resistivity of niobium ( inset ) .",
    "one could infer from these plots that the apparent rise of the junction temperature might be connected to the increasing thermal resistance of the thermal path from junction to bath .",
    "the paper by voss and webb in 1981 indeed launched a field of study ; its importance was that it seemed to show for the first time ( in fig.3 ) clear evidence that below @xmath108  _ mk _ the distribution widths become independent of @xmath37  and that the results are in excellent agreement with predictions for the quantum tunneling of the ( macroscopic ) junction phase ",
    ", in other words , that mqt had been confirmed .",
    "figure [ fig25 ] is an expanded view of experimental data points from yu et al.@xcite . both axes are linear in contrast to a log temperature scale which , as was pointed out earlier , tends to stretch the data along the temperature axis and create the appearance of a saturation of the peak positions as the lowest temperatures are approached .",
    "the dashed line is drawn at the peak position indicated by yu et al . as the expected quantum limit .",
    "it is quite apparent that the peak positions have * not * become temperature independent , and no evidence of an mqt transition can be claimed .    a recent investigation of transmon qubits @xcite considered the possibility that a superconducting qubit might not be in equilibrium with its cryogenic environment , leading to effective temperatures in the range @xmath109 .      in 1985 ,",
    "devoret et al .",
    "@xcite introduced the concept of an escape temperature , defined by the expression    @xmath110    from their experimental data for the positions of the escape peaks at a each bath temperature , the escape rate was determined .",
    "then , @xmath105was calculated from the above equation .",
    "in other words , they asked : what revised junction temperature would yield agreement with the experimental observations of escape peak positions ?",
    "this in fact is exactly the question posed in our discussion of scd peaks in the rcsj model .",
    "so the escape temperature here is the effective temperature in the earlier discussion .",
    "their plot showing the relationship between escape temperature and bath temperature is reproduced here in fig.[fig26 ] .    in the limit @xmath111 , the escape rate",
    "is expected to be entirely due to mqt and therefore    @xmath112    for their high critical current junction , they indicate that the escape temperature was expected to be @xmath113 _ mk _ , as marked by the label ` mqt ' .    the calculation can be inverted by substituting this value of @xmath114 in the expression and asking what plasma frequency",
    "is implied . for @xmath115",
    "the conclusion is that to make this work , the plasma frequency must be @xmath116 or @xmath117 .",
    "however , the zero - bias plasma frequency @xmath118 equals @xmath119 using the stated values @xmath120 and @xmath121 ; thus @xmath122 .",
    "hence the _ apparent _ fit to the experimental data in the @xmath111 limit is a result of choosing a plasma frequency approximately half the zero - bias value .",
    "that drop in value would occur at a normalized bias of @xmath123 .",
    "but what justification is there for this value ? in devoret",
    "the claim was made that all of this is achieved `` with no adjustable parameters '' , but it seems the plasma frequency was selected to achieve the desired limit .",
    "an important point to note is that each of the points in this plot came from finding an escape temperature that matched the observed escape rate @xmath72 .",
    "there is nothing intrinsically quantum in such a calculation .",
    "only the limiting value ( @xmath111 ) is a prediction of mqt , not the data points at finite temperature .",
    "this particular plot first appeared in devoret , martinis , and clarke ( 1985 ) @xcite , and the exact same figure appeared also in martinis , devoret , and clarke ( 1987 ) @xcite and yet again in clarke , cleland , devoret , esteve , and martinis ( 1988 ) @xcite .",
    "it might also be noted that the classical junction  was just the quantum junction  with an applied magnetic field used to reduce the critical current from @xmath124 to @xmath125 , so in fact only one experimental sample was involved in all these claims of observing mqt effects .    as was done in the earlier discussion of the rcsj model",
    "applied to such experiments , an alternate graphical presentation ( fig.[fig27 ] ) hints at another interpretation .",
    "taking all the data points and not focusing entirely on the limiting value , it becomes apparent , as discussed for the rcsj interpretation of the data of yu et al .",
    ", that the sample temperature appears to rise above the bath temperature , martinis et al .",
    "( 1987 ) @xcite were obviously aware of this issue when they stated : although the low - temperature values of @xmath105 plotted in fig .",
    "2 are in good agreement with the @xmath126 prediction , nevertheless one should demonstrate that the flattening of @xmath127 is not due to an unknown , spurious noise source .",
    "this crucial point was raised by cristiano and silvestrini @xcite who noted that in the presence of external noise , the effective temperature can be higher than the bath temperature .",
    "this matter was debated in an exchange in physical review letters 1989 @xcite . in a subsequent paper on the topic of escape temperature ,",
    "silvestrini silvestrini aptly remarked : from a theoretical point of view , @xmath105 is then a good variable to clearly visualize the transition between the classical and quantum limit , * if there is any *  and then from an experimental point of view , on the contrary , @xmath105 is not a direct measured quantity but strongly correlated to junction parameters which are not known _ a priori _ , as the critical current @xmath8 , the junction effective resistance and capacitance .  and in fact devoret et al .",
    "( 1985 ) devoret did concede that the error in the predicted value of @xmath105 arises predominantly from uncertainties in @xmath128 and @xmath129 .",
    "a definitive resolution of the dispute would be to directly measure the junction temperature during the experiment instead of measuring the bath temperature",
    ". then one would know for certain if the escape temperature did or did not indicate an mqt escape process at work .",
    "otherwise , as is obvious , there remains a ` loophole ' in the logic because evidence that no noise is present is indirect and possibly not applicable to the many other similar experiments that also claim to see mqt .",
    "finally , in their reply to silvestrini s comment , devoret et al.devoret conceded that : it is of course true that , as silvestrini states , our data do not represent an unambiguous proof of mqt .",
    "in terms of rcsj model the phase dynamics of a josephson junction are governed by equation [ eq1 ] . for small amplitude oscillations in the washboard potential",
    "well , the natural frequency is @xmath130 . in the anharmonic approximation",
    ", larger amplitude oscillations occur at a frequency given by eq.[eq12 ] .",
    "when both dc and ac bias currents are applied , the phase equation becomes    @xmath131    the ac forcing term mimics the presence of external microwaves irradiating the junction . as an illustrative example , the following junction parameters were chosen : @xmath132,@xmath133 , giving a zero - bias plasma frequency of @xmath134 the above was solved numerically @xcite , see fig.[resonance ] , under the following conditions : the dissipation constant was set at @xmath135 and the dc bias current was fixed , in this case at @xmath136 . for each selected ac bias frequency , the excitation amplitude @xmath137 was ramped up from zero to approximately @xmath138 over a time interval of @xmath139 plasma periods .",
    "the maximum amplitude of the resulting oscillations in @xmath4 on the escape side of the well was noted .",
    "this response curve shows clearly that the amplitude of the induced phase oscillations is a maximum when the excitation frequency matches the plasma frequency as determined by the anharmonic approximation ( marked by a black triangle ) .",
    "the plasma frequency calculated from the harmonic approximation ( dashed line ) lies slightly above that value and has slightly smaller induced oscillations .    to carry out a full simulation of a swept bias experiment , the previous method ( no microwaves )",
    "must be adapted to the present case .",
    "the essential idea is to modify the previous escape rate ( at the @xmath65 step in the bias sweep )    @xmath140    so as to account for the lowering of the barrier by the resonant excitation . whenever sustained phase oscillations are induced , energy is pumped into the system .",
    "as figure [ fig14 ] suggests , the maximum induced phase excursion @xmath141 on the escape side of the well that exists at the @xmath142bias step leads to an effective barrier that is smaller than the full height @xmath143 :    @xmath144    it is reasonable to suppose that ac induced phase oscillations would take the form    @xmath145    in other words , a lorentzian distribution centered on the resonance mentioned earlier ",
    "@xmath146 being the anharmonic bias value .    the pump energy can be calculated from the value of the phase at the bottom of the well together with @xmath147 . with this modification to the barrier height , the revised escape rate can be used exactly as in the earlier simulation of swept bias experiments without microwaves .",
    "the potential energy of a josephson junction @xmath148 is given by eq.[eq4 ] and is plotted in fig.[quantumlevels ] .",
    "the macroscopic quantum conjecture is that well below the crossover temperature the phase of a josephson junction @xmath4 becomes the coordinate of a quantum ` particle ' existing within a potential well which can contain discrete energy levels .",
    "the wavefunctions of the ground state and first two excited states , calculated numerically @xcite , are shown .",
    "if  true , a josephson junction would be a macroscopic object with atom - like energy states you .",

    "the experimental evidence for rabi oscillations presented in @xcite ( see the upper panel of fig.[rabidoubleplot ] )    seemed persuasive and this added to the consensus in the mqt community that a josephson junction would indeed function as a qubit at very low temperatures .    during the first half of the 2000 - 2010 decade , however , numerical techniques for simulating escape processes in josephson junction through the rcsj model had been set up and calibrated in a number of papers @xcite .",

    "this situation is distinctly different from the more common current - biased josephson junction where the energy takes the form of a washboard potential . in the quantum picture for this system , it a fluxon that would escape from the well by tunneling out into the larger and deeper well .",
    "we remark that the rcsj model suggests that the action of the microwaves is merely to kick the ` particle ' into oscillations within its shallow well , so in principle a brief plain pulse would work just as well .",
    "the mqt view is that microwaves are necessary to pump the ` particle ' to a higher level in that initial well .",
    "so a significant test of this issue would be to substitute a simple pulse in both experiment and simulation .",
    "we would predict the experimental data would not be affected .",
    "it is worth noting that in this case `` unambiguous '' evidence of quantum behaviour of the coupled loops was claimed @xcite based on the fact that the density matrix had off - diagonal terms ( see fig.[fig29 ] ) the belief was that a classical system could not possess such a property . that conjecture is naturally wrong if we think in terms of classical nonlinear systems , * *  * * and indeed simulations of rf - squids coupled through a capacitor showed that a suitably defined density matrix could have off - diagonal terms @xcite .",
    "these simulations returned a picture very close to that obtained in the experiments , as shown in fig.[fig30 ] .",
    "bear in mind that fig .",
    "[ fig29 ] derives from experimental data while fig .",
    "fig30 is obtained from numerical simulation data from a fully classical model .",
    "therefore state tomography can not be considered a definitive test of quantumness in the source of the data .    *  *",
    "at first the idea of a classical / quantum transition became the subject of experiments by just a few groups , and the evidence did seem to be consistent with the macroscopic quantum hypothesis .",
    "then the level of activity on the topic rose significantly .",
    "josephson systems such as rf - squids , large area junctions , annular junctions , and configurations of coupled junctions were all examined with the expectation that they would provide confirmation at the lowest temperatures of the new quantum phenomenology , and most of the obtained results seemed to support that idea . by the early 90 s , in the absence of any detailed classical rcsj simulations ,",
    "it was was generally accepted within the community that the quantum hypothesis had been confirmed by experiments .",
    "like supersolids @xcite , once the idea of a macroscopic quantum state was out there , people pursued it .",
    "unfortunately , several aspects concerning rcsj simulations were not clear in the 80 s , mainly because computer simulations for the nonlinear circuit model , including dc and ac forcing currents , along with noise current terms , represented a rather challenging topic and few groups around the world having access to powerful computing facilities were able to tame it . also , at that time , the exponential growth of the interest for chaotic dynamics moved the attention of the international community toward the intriguing and interesting evidences of chaos in josephson systems @xcite and , more in general , toward spatio - temporal structures competition in nonlinear systems @xcite .",
    "thus , at the beginning of the 90ies , in the absence of specific and systematic rcsj simulations , the existence of a crossover temperature , of energy levels in the josephson potentials and their evidence through spectroscopy  were generally accepted as a necessity .",
    "the above historical conditions gave birth , at the beginning of the 90ies , to a research project @xcite , aiming at securing evidence of macroscopic quantum coherence ( mqc was the acronym of the project ) along the philosophy of a gedanken experiment proposed by claudia tesche tesche90 .",
    "the project was aiming to take advantage of the possible macroscopic quantum behaviour of josephson circuits in order to provide proof of fundamental relations of quantum mechanics such as bell s inequalities .",
    "the experiment was based in particular on the double - well potential of an rf - squid , namely a superconducting loop interrupted by a josephson junction .",
    "one well of the potential was supposed to be occupied by a current circulating clockwise while the other well was occupied by a current circulating counterclockwise . in principle , if the barrier between the two wells was sufficiently low , the net current in the rf - squid loop could be considered as being a superposition of the state of each well , and the system itself could be in a typical quantum singlet state . using a dc - squid coupled to an rf - squid that served as a detector for the superposition state",
    ", it should have been possible to probe the quantum properties of the superposition itself ( see fig.2 @xcite ) .",
    "the mqc experiment resulted in the development of a thermal escape technique necessary for probing tunnelling and potentials@xcite .    at some point the basic circuit architecture of the mqc experiment was changed in order to introduce , following an idea of j. e. lukens and co - workers @xcite , a means of tuning of the height of the barrier separating the two wells of the rf - squid potential .",
    "a lower barrier could favor the interaction between the macroscopic quantum states in the two wells while the tunability could pinpoint the moment when the quantum interaction turned on .",
    "this tunability could be realized by replacing the single junction of the rf - squid loop with a two parallel junctions in a small subsidiary loop as shown in fig.[tunablebarrier ] .",
    "sophisticated and sensitive potential escape measuremets @xcite at very low temperatures showed that the role of the inner loop giving rise to the tunability of the system modifies the shape of the potential giving rise to interesting features which can be explained within the general frame of the analysis of singularities in classical nonlinear systems @xcite .",
    "it is most likely the nonlinear dynamic interaction between the junctions of the dc interferometer which originates a gapin the excitation spectrum which was interpreted as evidence of a quantum effect due to level quantization @xcite : in general indeed , we have found that a gap structure can arise in the excitation spectrum of two rcsj oscillators whenever a coupling between those is allowed .    over all ,",
    "interactions between the two wells of the rf - squid potential expected in zero - applied microwaver ( rf currents ) have not been observed from escape measurements .",
    "some interesting observations have been recently reported by pulsing the system with microwave burst @xcite , however , the discussion reported in the previous sections concerning the `` atom - like '' responses of josephson junctions indicates that collecting information by pumping withy external microwaves , or short microwave bursts , or anything else can hardly lead to unique quantum  properties for josephson systems .",
    "it must always be recalled that the junctions used for macroscopic quantum coherence experiments are of very good quality and , speaking in terms of rcsj model , very lightly damped , and therefore a short burst of microwaves , or even just a single pulse , induces oscillations having a very long decay time which can allow modelling and manipulations even from a classical point of view .",
    "in the first publication reporting experimental results for coupled qubits @xcite , the coupling was provided by a macroscopic external capacitor .",
    "the interpretation placed on the experimental findings was entirely within a quantum narrative and concluded that entanglement had been observed .",
    "a classical equivalent circuit based on the rcsj model led to a pair of coupled differential equations for the phase variables ; numerical solutions of these equations @xcite , @xcite were shown to fully replicate the experimental observations .",
    "this cast significant doubt on the claims that quantum entanglement had been unambiguously demonstrated .",
    "more recently , this kind of macroscopic coupling , now of two transmons , has been extended from a capacitor to a one - meter transmission line , as shown in fig.[coax ] from @xcite .",
    "a transmon is a particular configuration of josephson junctions , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ koch transmon ] , taken from @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "all of the experiments reviewed here were intended either to confirm the existence of a macroscopic quantum state for josephson junctions at very low temperatures , or to exploit the anticipated properties of a junction in the macroscopic quantum state .",
    "the simplest and most straightforword investigations were structured as swept - bias experiments , both with and without applied microwaves .",
    "these experiments recorded the value of the bias current at the moment when a finite voltage suddenly appeared across the junction .  accumulated data from repeated bias scans provided switching current distributions ( scd ) .  without microwaves , a single scd peak is seen .",
    "mqt theory predicted that the position of this peak should become temperature independent at sufficiently low temperatures .",
    "such peak freezing is a _ sine qua non _ of any claims that a macroscopic quantum state has been achieved .",
    "as shown in this review , close inspection of experimental data clearly indicates that peak freezing has not been seen .",
    "when microwaves are present , additional scd peaks appear , commonly just one or two .",
    "these are well described as resulting from classical resonant activation at the anharmonic , or harmonic , plasma frequency .",
    "what has not been reported are multiple peaks expected from different pairs of inter - level spacings in a well .",
    "next were experiments involving more complex superconducting circuits ; they were focused on expectations arising from the artificial atom picture of a low temperature josephson junction .",
    "finally , there were experiments consisting of a coupled pair of superconducting loops , each containing a josephson junction .",
    "these were intended to probe anticipated quantum entanglement .",
    "it is worth recalling that above a hypothetical transition temperature , circuits containing josephson junctions can be fully modelled with classical components ( capacitors , inductors , resistors ) together with the johnson - mccumber - stewart josephson junction model from 1968 .",
    "the key question is whether a transition to a macroscopic quantum state occurs at sufficiently low temperatures . at present",
    "the allure of a superconducting quantum computer is undeniable , however , as we have seen in this report , there may have been a rush to judgment because , on close examination , much of the collected experimental data did not , in a _ definitive _ fashion , conclusively support the hypothesis of a transition to macroscopic quantum state .",
    "this applies to phase qubits , flux qubits , squid s , etc .",
    "even some recent qubit configurations such as transmons may be expressed in terms of the rcsj model @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "beginning with the early experiments of voss and webb @xcite , and devoret et al.@xcite , the accumulating evidence seemed to support the conjecture that josephson junctions at sufficiently low temperatures would enter a new macroscopic quantum state . if true , josephson junctions could function as of superconducting quantum bits ( qubits )",
    "the evidences documented in this review show that the interpretation of such experiments in terms of the new macroscopic quantum states is far from unique and/or necessary . a decisive experiment would be required whose results could _ only _ be understood in quantum terms and to make this crucial step , the rcsj model must be applied and shown to fail .",

    "at the very beginning of the mqt story , in 1981 , the paper by voss and webb @xcite gave pride of place to scd peak _ width _ over peak _",
