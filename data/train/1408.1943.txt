    "the theory of self - organized criticality ( soc ) , introduced by bak and collaborators , provides an appealing explanation for the distribution of sizes ( and presumably durations ) of many naturally occurring catastrophic events @xcite .",
    "earthquakes , landslides , volcanic eruptions , rainfall , hurricanes , etc .",
    "@xcite , have been found to display power - law distributions of event sizes , which implies the absence of characteristic scales for those sizes .",
    "this means that if you ask , for instance : `` how big are earthquakes in japan ? ''",
    ", this innocent question has no possible answer @xcite . in mathematical terms",
    ", this implies that after performing a scale transformation of a function describing the size of the events , the function has to remain unchanged , and the only univariate function with this property ( for any dilatation or contraction ) is the power law .",
    "soc explains this power - law behavior as coming from a self - organization process that leads the system to the critical point of a phase transition , where scale invariance is ensured .",
    "other approaches , purely probabilistic , support the power - law tail in some cases , as described by the generalized pareto distribution @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the exponent of the power law in self - organized - critical systems takes such values that it is associated to an infinite expected value for the size of the events , which is unphysical ; therefore , in practice , one can not ignore finite - size effects .",
    "when one is worried not about the size but about the time between events , the situation is a bit more involving .",
    "in fact , the waiting time is defined as the time between consecutive events when these events are above a certain threshold in size . in the usual case this approach takes place in a slow time scale , in which events happen instantaneously ( in comparison with the waiting times , earthquakes are a good example ) .",
    "when the threshold is high enough , the events can be considered as extreme events , but there is no formal difference between these and ordinary events .",
    "models of self - organized criticality are not very useful at this point , because , although the most common soc models lead to a poissonian occurrence of events and therefore to an exponential distribution of waiting times ( in contrast to some observational data @xcite ) , other soc models yield correlated avalanches @xcite one concludes from here that soc is not about the temporal occurrence of events ( in the slow time scale ) but about their size ( or duration ) .",
    "but it is interesting anyhow to stretch the notion of scale invariance to the waiting - time problem .",
    "one deals now with two variables ( size and waiting time ) , and in this case the scale transformation @xmath0 is written as @xmath1 =   c f(x / a , y / b),\\ ] ] with @xmath2 a bivariate function , and @xmath3 , the scale factors of the transformation .",
    "when @xmath4 are greater than one the transformation dilates the function in its three directions ; for instance , taking @xmath5 takes a function in the scale of , let us say , meters to the scale of centimeters .",
    "the condition of scale invariance comes in this case from imposing @xmath1 =   c f(x / a , y / b ) = f(x , y),\\ ] ] for all @xmath6 .",
    "so , we are looking for a fixed point for @xmath0 and the only solution @xcite can be written in the form @xmath7 with @xmath8 an arbitrary univariate function called scaling function and @xmath9 and @xmath10 not free but given by @xmath11 and @xmath12",
    ". we will refer to this functional form of @xmath2 as a scaling law .",
    "note that for the univariate problem , described just by @xmath13 , the scaling function has to be a constant , and then a power law is left .",
    "in fact , a power law is a particular case of a scaling law , but not the opposite , and so it is useful to keep the distinction between both concepts if one is involved with multivariate functions . the scaling law can be expressed in other , alternative , equivalent forms , as for instance , @xmath14 etc . , just remember that the scaling function @xmath8 is arbitrary .",
    "however , one can immediately realize that , when events above a low threshold in size are compared to events with higher size , the analysis of the waiting - time does not only involve a scale transformation . indeed ,",
    "an additional coarse - graining transformation is opperating .",
    "this comes from the fact that events below the threshold need to be eliminated , in order to measure the time between consecutive events above the threshold .",
    "so , the transformation of the data comprises a coarse - graining followed by a scale transformation @xcite .",
    "this is the essence of a renormalization - group transformation @xcite .    on the other hand",
    ", one can analyze soc models and soc - like systems in a complementary way , not in the slow time scale in which almost instantaneous events happen but in the fast time scale inside of the events .",
    "then , one takes a threshold not in size but in intensity ( size per unit time ) and measures the analogous of the waiting time , the time the signal is below threshold , which in this context is called quiet time .",
    "this approach was pursued in ref .",
    "@xcite , where a totally different behavior was found , with a power - law distribution of quiet times ( in agreement then with some observational results @xcite ) . naturally , this framework is valid not only for soc - like systems but for any time series from which events are defined by a process of thresholding .",
    "this paper has as a goal to approach both kind of problems , waiting times defined in a slow time scale and quiet times defined in a fast time scale , from the point of view of scaling theory . in the next section the renormalization - group approach to the waiting - time sequence",
    "will be revisited and the precise form of the resulting scaling law will be presented for two broad class of processes , in analogy with the central limit theorem . a different scaling form for the quiet - time distribution will be used in the third section , generalizing the result for the diffusion of a brownian particle .",
    "this yields however important consequences for the projection of extreme - event recurrence .",
    "the result is extended to the interesting case in which the right tail of the distribution is a power law , with such an exponent that the expected value of the variable is infinite .",
    "the paper illustrates in which way one has to extrapolate the statistics of ordinary events in order to infer the recurrence of extreme events in a system that shows scaling .",
    "a point process , for our purposes , is a set of point events , i.e. , instantaneous events , that occur in time @xcite .",
    "the simplest point process is the poisson process , in which the events take place at a constant rate , independently of any other event .",
    "a marked point process is a point process in which the points , i.e. , the events , carry some `` mark '' , which in our case corresponds to their size or dissipated energy .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , when one considers events of a large enough size , the original point process transforms or renormalizes to a new point process .",
    "events below the threshold in size are eliminated whereas events above the threshold survive .",
    "this coarse graining or decimation is called thinning @xcite or rarefaction @xcite in the theory of point processes . as a special class of marked point processes we will consider in this section what is called marked renewal processes @xcite , in which the size of events will be independent on other sizes and on the time of occurrence of the events , and",
    "additionally , the waiting times will be independent on previous waiting times ( and constitute then what is called a renewal processes @xcite , in which only the time of occurrence of the last event determines the time of the next one ) .    by construction , sizes are independent random variables , thus , the elimination of events below the threshold in size is equivalent to a random thinning . in this case , the waiting - time density transforms after thinning to @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the probability of surviving to the thinning , i.e. , the probability of being above the threshold @xmath17 , @xmath18 is the laplace transform of the original waiting - time probability density @xmath19 , and @xmath20 is the laplace transform of the waiting - time density for events of size larger than @xmath17 , see refs .",
    "@xcite . the laplace transform arises because the waiting - time density for events above the threshold is the convolution of a random number of densities for all events .",
    "then , going to laplace space simplifies considerably the equations , as convolutions transform into simple products there .",
    "the subsequent step of the renormalization transformation is a scale transformation .",
    "this can be done in two different ways , a trivial one and a non - trivial one , as we will show in the next two subsections .",
    "let us considering the following scale transformation for the waiting - time density for events above size @xmath17 , @xmath21 , or , in laplace space , @xmath22 this is because we expect that thinning increases the time scale in a @xmath23 factor , and so , in order to compensate for this fact , we perform a contraction of the function in the @xmath24axis with a scale factor @xmath25 , whereas we perform a dilatation of the function in the @xmath26axis with a scale factor @xmath27 , in order to keep normalization .",
    "we will see in the next subsection that this makes sense only if the mean waiting time @xmath28 is finite .",
    "the combined effect of the thinning ( [ coarse ] ) and scale transformation yields the complete renormalization transformation @xmath29 , which is then @xmath30 = \\frac{p \\tilde f(p \\omega)}{1-q \\tilde f(p \\omega ) } \\label{renorm}\\ ] ] with @xmath31 .",
    "the solution of the fixed - point condition @xmath32= \\tilde f^*(\\omega)$ ] , for all @xmath16 , leads to the fixed - point solution or renormalization - invariant laplace transform of the density @xmath33 . defining a new variable @xmath34 and separating the variables @xmath35 and @xmath36 leads to the laplace transform of an exponential distribution , i.e. , @xmath37 with @xmath38 an arbitrary constant , see refs .",
    "this exponential distribution corresponds , due to the independence of the events in the process , to the poisson process . in words ,",
    "the poisson process is invariant under the renormalization transformation given by eq .",
    "( [ renorm ] ) .",
    "this is obvious if one intuitively knows the properties of the poisson process .",
    "but it is not only that the poisson process is invariant under the transformation ( [ renorm ] ) , the results also tells us that the poisson process is the only marked renewal process invariant under such transformation @xcite . and , even more , it is easy to show that it is also an attractor for any marked renewal process with waiting - time density with a finite mean ( and whose laplace transform exists ) , see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "this leads us to the first scaling form or data collapse considered in this paper .",
    "remember that in order to compare the thinned or coarse - grained distribution with the original one we perform a scale transformation of the form @xmath39 .",
    "this means that the fixed - point solution , i.e. , the resulting probability density for very high thresholds in size fulfills the following scaling law @xmath40 where the scaling function @xmath41 is a decreasing exponential , but we will see that @xmath41 can take more general forms in other cases .",
    "therefore , if plotting @xmath42 versus @xmath43 yields a data collapse , i.e. , a single curve , independently on the value of @xmath16 , this implies that the scaling law is fulfilled .",
    "other equivalent forms of the scaling law can be obtained from the fact that the parameter @xmath16 gives the probability that an event has energy @xmath44 larger than the threshold @xmath17 ( given that has energy larger than a reference level 0 ) , i.e. , @xmath45 } \\simeq \\frac { n_s}{n_0}\\ ] ] where @xmath46 is the number of events with energy above @xmath17 .",
    "thus , the scaling @xmath47 is equivalent to @xmath48 but this is only valid if the window width @xmath49 is fixed .",
    "if time windows of different width are compared one needs to correct for this fact ; so , the rescaling is equivalent to @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the rate of events above @xmath17 , i.e. , the number of events above @xmath17 per unit time .",
    "the situation of comparing different time windows is common when dealing with real data of natural catastrophes , as different sizes have different windows of completeness ( see caption of fig .",
    "23 in ref .",
    "then , the scaling law ( [ scalinguno ] ) can be alternatively written as @xmath52 where we have introduced the mean waiting time @xmath53 ( which of course depends on the threshold @xmath17 although this is not reflected in the notation ) .",
    "note that the scaling function @xmath41 appearing here is not exactly the same as the one in eq .",
    "( [ scalinguno ] ) , as two multiplicative constants are reabsorbed in @xmath41 . in this case",
    "the scaling law can be fulfilled by plotting the dimensionless waiting - time density @xmath54 versus the dimensionless time @xmath55 ( in other words , plotting the waiting - time density in units of @xmath51 versus the waiting time in units of @xmath28 ) .    in order to end with the different scaling forms ,",
    "if there is scale invariance in the sizes ( as it happens in soc systems , in earthquakes , etc . ) , then @xmath56 , so , an additional form for the scaling law is @xmath57 where again , some multiplicative constant has been dropped deliberately .",
    "this form of the scaling law is the `` most natural one '' in the sense that it is written in terms of the two variables of the problem , @xmath58 and @xmath17 .",
    "the equivalence with the scale - invariant form of eq .",
    "( [ scaling_original ] ) is achieved by realizing that @xmath59 .",
    "these scaling laws , eqs .",
    "( [ scalinguno ] ) , ( [ scalingdos ] ) , and ( [ scalingtres ] ) , are very useful in practice , as they have been shown to show up in several natural hazards , as for instance , earthquakes @xcite .",
    "however , the scaling function @xmath41 is not provided by an exponential function alone ; rather , it contains a decreasing power - law for small to intermediate times , with exponent @xmath60 .",
    "other authors , using a simplified model of seismicity , have argued for a different behavior , with no scaling law @xcite . in any case , the simple approach in this section , based in a process with independent times and sizes , is clearly not valid for earthquakes and other natural hazards , in which important dependences exist @xcite .",
    "other examples of a general scaling law under thinning with non - exponential scaling function include fractures @xcite , forest fires @xcite , and , curiously , printing requests @xcite . in the case of fires only eqs .",
    "( [ scalinguno ] ) and ( [ scalingdos ] ) are valid , and not eq .",
    "( [ scalingtres ] ) , as the fire size is not power - law distributed , for the particular data analyzed in ref .",
    "the scaling is also found in a different approach for earthquakes @xcite , but there not only simple thinning is performed and the scaling under thinning should arise from the underlying scaling explained in ref .",
    "other references provide only very indirect evidence of the scaling , as in nanofractures @xcite and in tsunamis @xcite , the problem being that no different thresholds in size are considered , although the resulting scaling functions seem to be the same as for earthquakes .",
    "the recurrence of words in texts , despite yielding a function very similar to the earthquake case , has nothing to do with thinning or renormalization @xcite .",
    "finally , approaches in which the threshold is imposed not in size but in intensity will be considered in the next section @xcite , whereas the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite is for a transformation of the original signal .",
    "we explain in this subsection how the linear scaling with @xmath16 in eq .",
    "( [ linial ] ) is not the only reasonable possibility .",
    "let us consider instead a constant @xmath61 and perform the rescaling as @xmath62 ; this yields the ( completed ) renormalization transformation @xmath29 , using eq .",

    "this distribution is not only the only fixed point , for a fixed @xmath67 , but it is also an attractor for distributions with power - law tail , of the form @xmath68 .",
    "the case @xmath69 does not lead to well - defined probability distributions .",
    "the non - linear rescaling with @xmath70 is explained by the generalized central limit theorem .",
    "indeed , as the times @xmath71 have a distribution with a power - law tail , with exponent smaller than 2 , the classic central limit theorem does not hold and one has instead that the total time @xmath49 scales as @xmath72 see ref .",
    "@xcite or the appendix i here .",
    "thus , after thinning by a factor @xmath16 , the time window which restores the number of events @xmath73 is the one that contains @xmath74 events , and this is the time window of duration @xmath75 . in other words , we need to rescale time as @xmath76 .",
    "this is the origin of the non - linear rescaling .    in the same way as in the previous subsection ,",
    "invariance under the renormalization transformation means that the invariant density is of the form @xmath77 with @xmath78 a scaling function given by the inverse laplace transform of eq .",
    "( [ laplace_r ] ) , which we have explained has a double power - law form .",
    "expressions alternative to the previous rescaling can be obtained as before , by using that @xmath79 where @xmath46 is the number of events with size ( energy ) above @xmath17 and we have taken into account that , in practice , the time window can be different for events above size @xmath17 than for events above the reference size @xmath80 .",
    "therefore , the scaling law ( [ pr ] ) can be written as @xmath81 where @xmath82 refers to events above threshold @xmath17 and @xmath83 the sample mean of the waiting time above @xmath17 ( different from the mean of the distribution , which is infinite ) .",
    "note that the generalized central limit theorem implies that @xmath83 diverges with the number of data , but @xmath84 does not . in the case",
    "@xmath66 , then @xmath85 and we recover the scaling of the previous subsection .",
    "if we put the size - dependence explicitly , @xmath86 in this one and in eq .",
    "( [ specialuno ] ) we have deliberately ignored some multiplicative constants . comparison with the scale - invariant solution of the scale transformation , eq .",
    "( [ scaling_original ] ) , shows that @xmath87 .",
    "a marked renewal process of the sort of the one in this subsection is neither implausible nor artificial .",
    "indeed , consider that a hidden signal triggers instantaneous events ( as earthquakes ) when it reaches a fixed threshold and that at that point the signal is immediately reset just below the threshold .",
    "if the sizes of the events are independent and the signal can not reach an absorbing boundary below it ( this can be achieved in practice by putting the boundary of a random walk at @xmath88 , or by taking the exponentiation of the random walk , which never reaches the absorbing boundary at zero ) , then this leads to a marked renewal process with waiting - time density given by the so - called lvy - smirnov distribution , see eq .",
    "( [ levy_smirnov ] ) , which has a right power - law tail with exponent 3/2 @xcite .",
    "iterative application of the thinning transformation leads to a different distribution , which keeps the power - law tail with exponent @xmath89 for large times but develops a new power law in the regime of small @xmath58 , with exponent 1/2 .",
    "several references have pointed out the relationship between the central limit theorem and renormalization @xcite , including the generalized case @xcite . from our perspective",
    ", we can provide a clear connection between the renormalization under random thinning explained in the previous subsections and the generalized central limit theorem .",
    "the key is to consider a point process in which events are not removed randomly but deterministically , surviving a proportion @xmath16 , in such a way that out of @xmath23 events , the @xmath90th survives and the rest are removed ( with @xmath23 integer , for instance , if @xmath91 the events are removed alternatively ) .",
    "then , for a process in which the waiting times are independent ( i.e. , a renewal process ) , this deterministic thinning transformation can be written as @xmath92^{\\star 1/p},\\ ] ] where @xmath19 is the probability density of the original point process , @xmath93 the corresponding one after thinning ( associated to events above size @xmath17 ) , and @xmath94 denotes convolution @xmath23 times . in laplace space , the combined thinning plus rescaling transformation becomes @xmath95 = [ \\tilde f(p^r\\omega)]^{1/p},\\ ] ] which is the equivalent of eq .",
    "( [ renormdos ] ) , and then , the fixed point condition for @xmath29 , taking logarithms , fulfills @xmath96 this means that @xmath97 , which is a cumulant generating function , has to fulfill the scale - invariance condition .",
    "if we impose the fixed point condition for all @xmath16 the solution is then a power law , @xmath98 and for the laplace transform of the density we find , @xmath99 for the case @xmath66 we recognize the laplace transform of a dirac s delta function , @xmath100 , whereas for @xmath101 we get @xmath102 which is sometimes called lvy - smirnov distribution . for any @xmath61",
    "the fixed - point distribution has a power - law tail , for large times , with exponent @xmath65 ( with infinite mean therefore ) .",
    "as one can see in appendix i , these distributions are also attractors , with different domains of attraction .",
    "the case @xmath66 yields the classic law of large numbers @xcite , in the form of the attractiveness of the dirac s delta function , whereas @xmath61 leads to a certain case of the generalized central limit theorem @xcite .",
    "the previous section was devoted to point processes in which the size of the events was larger than some threshold .",
    "from the point of view of soc , we were looking at the system in the slow time scale . here",
    "we analyze the equivalent problem in the fast time scale ( if there are two time scales ) , in order to see similarities and differences",
    ". our approach will be also valid for non - soc systems , with only one time scale , as usual time series .",
    "the procedure consists simply in introducing a threshold in the value of the signal ( intensity or activity in the soc language ) and define the quiet time as the time the signal is below threshold .",
    "several papers have used this approach before @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the results will be of broader applicability .      in appendix",
    "ii we consider an intensity signal modeled by a brownian noise between two absorbing boundaries ( the zero - intensity state and the threshold ) and show how the quiet - time distribution fulfills a scaling law .",
    "let us generalize here that scaling law , replacing the brownian exponent 3/2 by a generic and undefined exponent @xmath103 , and considering a generic scaling function @xmath78 , then we write @xmath104 where the scale parameter is now called @xmath105 , and enters as a subindex of the probability density @xmath106 to indicate the dependence on the threshold ( as @xmath105 depends on it ) .",
    "the density is defined for @xmath107 and is zero otherwise .",
    "the scaling function @xmath78 has to decrease , for large arguments , fast enough , which in our case means faster than @xmath108 , as we are interested , at most , in the calculation of the third moment ( i.e. , we ask not only for the finiteness of the expected value of @xmath109 , which is @xmath110 , but also for the finiteness of the second moment of @xmath109 , which is @xmath111 ) .",
    "this is the `` worst '' scenario and in some case @xmath78 can decay slower than @xmath108 , the main requirement being that the moments involved in the equations are finite , as well as their variances .    as shown in appendix ii",
    ", the scaling function @xmath78 can be a bit complicated and it is more convenient to write the scaling law in a slightly modified form , separating a power - law behavior for intermediate values from the rest of the scaling function , @xmath112 for @xmath113 , where we assume that the function @xmath41 tends to a positive constant at zero , and @xmath114 is a normalization constant .",
    "this scaling form also comprises the scaling laws of the previous section , taking @xmath115 for the case of earthquakes @xcite , and @xmath116 for the trivial poisson fixed point of uncorrelated point processes . as , for small arguments",
    ", the scaling function @xmath41 tends to a constant and decreases `` fast enough '' for large arguments , the scale parameter @xmath105 separates at least two regimes , being the one for @xmath117 the corresponding for extreme events ; in other words , @xmath105 sets the scale of extreme events .",
    "it is worth mentioning that here we use a broader definition of scaling function than the one of ref .",
    "@xcite , as there it is enforced that the scale parameter @xmath105 only appears in the argument of the scaling function , and not outside .",
    "the use of that prescription or the use of our scaling form is a matter of choice and has no fundamental implications .",
    "thus , in the case @xmath118 we can take @xmath119 and verify that @xmath114 is a constant indeed and then it is reabsorbed into the scaling function ( i.e. , @xmath120 ) .",
    "however , for @xmath121 one finds that @xmath114 is not a true constant but proportional to @xmath122 , and then @xmath123 can not be zero .",
    "the scaling law for @xmath124 turns out to be @xmath125 both cases , @xmath118 and @xmath121 , can be summarized into a unique scaling law , @xmath126 with @xmath127 and @xmath119 for @xmath118 and with @xmath128 and @xmath129 for @xmath121 .",

    "we have seen how scaling laws can arise in the waiting time or quiet time between extreme events .",
    "we consider two scenarios .",
    "the first one deals with point processes , for which events happen instantaneously in comparison with the waiting time between events .",
    "this corresponds to the slow time scale of driving in soc systems .",
    "it is shown that scaling might arise as an attractive fixed point of a renormalization transformation , consisting of thinning of events below a threshold in size plus a rescaling of the time axis ( so , it is considered that high enough thresholds lead to the fixed - point solution ) . for processes without correlations ,",
    "the resulting scaling law contains an exponential scaling function ( characteristic of a poisson process ) if the mean waiting time between the original events has a finite mean .",
    "in contrast , if the mean waiting time is infinite , a non - trivial scaling function arises , with a double - power - law behavior .",
    "different forms of the scaling law are shown in terms of the probability @xmath16 of surviving the thinning process , the mean waiting time for the renormalized events , or the distribution of events above size @xmath17 .",
    "the results are critically dependent on whether @xmath28 is finite or infinite . as a corollary ,",
    "a slight change in the renormalization procedure ( removing events deterministically instead of randomly ) leads to a direct derivation of the law of large numbers and the generalized central - limit theorem ( for the case of maximum asymmetry ) @xcite .",
    "the second scenario contemplates time series , and the variable of interest is the quiet time ( the time the signal is below a threshold ) , representing again but in a different way the time between extreme events . in the soc framework",
    "this would correspond to look at the system in the fast time scale inside the avalanches . in this case scaling laws",
    "might show up from the first - passage time of diffusion processes that model the signal , in the limit of high enough thresholds .",
    "the scaling law yields scaling functions different than the ones from point processes , with a decaying power law for short times ( except for the shortest times ) and a much faster decay for long times . using the dependence of the moments of the distribution on the scale parameter and on the power - law exponent we can replace the latter ones in terms of the former ones and obtain a non - parametric scaling law , depending only on the moments .",
    "the particular equation for the scaling law depends on the value of the power - law exponent ; in particular we have distinguished @xmath118 ( trivial scaling ) , @xmath164 , and @xmath160 . finally , this result is generalized for the case in which the waiting - time distribution does not decay fast enough for long times but slow enough in such a way that the mean waiting time becomes infinite .",
    "no non - parametric scaling is possible then and one obtains a semi - parametric scaling in which the dependence on the scale parameter can be substituted by the dependence on the sample moments , but the exponents can not be replaced . additionally , important lessons for the projection of extreme events are derived from the different scaling of the mean of the distribution and the scale of extreme events .",
