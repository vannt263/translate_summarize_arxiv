    "aptamers are short rna / dna molecules capable of binding , with high affinity and specificity , a specific target molecule via sequence and structure features that are complementary to the biochemical characteristics of the target s surface .",
    "the utilization of aptamers in a multitude of biotechnological and medical sciences has recently dramatically increased . while only 80 aptamer related publications were added to pubmed in the year 2000",
    ", this number has since roughly doubled every 5 years , with 207 records added in 2005 alone , 565 additional inclusions in 2010 , and as many as 957 new manuscripts indexed in 2014 .",
    "this astonishing trend is in part attributable to the considerable diversity of possible targets which span from small organic molecules @xcite , over transcription factors @xcite and other proteins or protein complexes @xcite , to the surfaces of viruses @xcite and entire cells @xcite .",
    "this broad range of targets makes aptamers suitable candidates for a variety of applications ranging from molecular biosensors @xcite , to drug delivery systems @xcite , and antibody replacement @xcite to just name a few .",
    "+ while the specifics vary depending on the target , aptamers are typically identified through the systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment ( selex ) protocol @xcite .",
    "selex leverages the well established paradigm of _ in vitro _ selection by repetitively enriching a pool of initially random sequences ( species ) with those that strongly bind a target of interest .",
    "specifically , based on the assumption that a large enough initial pool of randomized ( oligo)nucleotides contains some species with favorable sequence and structure allowing for binding to the target , these binders are then selected for through a series of selection cycles .",
    "each such cycle involves ( a ) incubating the pool with the target molecules , ( b ) partitioning target - bound species from non - binders and ( c ) removing the latter from the pool , followed by ( d ) elution of the bound fraction from the target , and ( e ) amplifying the remaining sequences via polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) to form the input for the subsequent round . after a target - specific number of selection cycles ,",
    "the final pool is then used to extract dominating , putatively high - affinity species , via traditional cloning experiments , computational analysis , and binding affinity assays . depending on their intended application ,",
    "favorable binders are often further post - processed _ in vitro _ to meet additional requirements such as improved structural stability or reducing the size of the aptamer to the relevant binding region . +",
    "another reason for the resurgence of interest in aptamer research relates to the utilization of affordable next - generation sequencing technologies along with traditional selex .",
    "this novel protocol , called ht - selex , combines systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment with high - throughput sequencing . in ht - slelex , after certain ( or all ) rounds of selection ( including the initial pool ) , aptamer pools are split into two samples , the first of which serves as the starting point for the next cycle whereas the latter is sequenced . the resulting sequencing data , consisting of 2 - 50 million sequences per round ,",
    "is then analyzed _ in silico _ in order to identify candidates that experience exponential enrichment throughout the selection @xcite .",
    "+ the massive amount of sequencing data produced by ht - selex opens the opportunity for the study of many aspects of the protocol that were either not accessible in traditional selex or that could be realized more accurately given hundreds of millions of data points .",
    "one of the most challenging of these problems is the discovery of aptamer properties that facilitate binding to the target .",
    "however , development of universal methods for the analysis of ht - selex data is challenged by the vast diversity of selection conditions such as temperature , salt concentration and the number of targets in the solution to just name a few .",
    "further , each of the stages ( a - e ) comprising one selection cycle can be accomplished by a variety of technologies .",
    "for instance , choosing between open pcr and droplet pcr for the amplification step has been shown to have a great impact on the diversity of the amplification product @xcite .",
    "even more importantly , the complexity of the target molecule is also of great relevance . as a case in point",
    ", it has been shown that _ in vitro _",
    "selection against transcription factors , and other molecules that are evolutionary optimized to efficiently recognize specific dna / rna targets , requires only a small number of rounds in order to produce high quality aptamers @xcite . on the other side of the spectrum , in the case of cell - selex , a variation of selex",
    "in which the pool is incubated with entire cells , the number of required selection cycles and the amount of non - specific binders that emerge during selection is significantly larger .",
    "indeed , such a target can in general accommodate a multitude of binding sites , each exposing different binding preferences and leading to a parallel selection towards unrelated binding motifs .",
    "current motif finding algorithms however , have not been designed with these challenges in mind and the need for the development of novel approaches that address the characteristics specific to the selex protocol has become highly relevant .",
    "+ * traditionally , motif discovery * has been defined as the problem of finding a set of common sub - sequences that are statistically enriched in a given collection of dna , rna , or protein sequences . to date , a large variety of computational methods in this area has been published ( see @xcite for a comprehensive review ) . in one of the earlier works ,",
    "lawrence and reilly @xcite introduced an expectation maximization ( em ) based algorithm for finding motifs from protein sequences .",
    "this approach has been consequently adopted by various other methods @xcite including meme @xcite  one of the most widely used programs in this category .",
    "et al . _ also introduced a gibbs sampling approach for motif identification @xcite which laid the grounds for other methods such as alignace @xcite , motifsampler @xcite , and bioprospector @xcite based on this general technique .",
    "in addition , numerous approaches have been designed based on efficient counting of all possible @xmath0-mers in a data set followed by a statistical analysis of their enrichment .",
    "representatives for this category include weeder @xcite , dreme @xcite , ymf @xcite , mdscan @xcite , and amadeus @xcite .",
    "_ designed a kernel based technique around a set of similar @xmath0-mers with a small number of mismatches to extract short motifs in protein sequences @xcite .",
    "another group of algorithms that also allows for elucidation of motifs with mismatches is built on suffix tree techniques ( sagot @xcite , pavesi _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , and leibovich @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , regression based methods have been developed that take additional information , such as the affinity of the input sequences or the genomic regulatory contexts into account .",
    "these include , but are not limited to matrixreduce @xcite , prego @xcite , chipmunk @xcite , and seqgl @xcite . for more information ,",
    "we refer the reader to weirauch _",
    "@xcite for a comprehensive evaluation of many of the above techniques .",
    "finally , a number of approaches for the identification of sequence motif in ht - selex data targeting transcription factors ( tf - selex ) have been published .",
    "one representative of this category is beeml @xcite , which is , to our knowledge , the first computational method for finding motifs on this type of high - throughput sequencing data . assuming the existence of a single binding motif",
    ", the method aims at fitting a binding energy model to the data which combines independent attributes from each position in the motif with higher order dependencies .",
    "another method by jolma _",
    "et al_. approaches the problem by using @xmath0-mers to construct a position weight matrix in order to infer the binding models @xcite .",
    "similarly , orenstein _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite also uses a @xmath0-mer approach based on frequencies from a single round of selection to identify binding motifs for transcription factor ht - selex data .",
    "notably , despite of ht - selex capability of generating data from multiple rounds of selection , all currently existent methods are based on the analysis of only a single selection cycle . however , choosing the round for optimal motif elucidation is not always trivial , and while some effort has been made to address this question ( see for example orenstein and shamir @xcite , jolma _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) this decision is ultimately left to the user . + * the search for motifs in the context of rna * sequences faces another dimension in complexity as binding of ssdna and rna molecules is known to be sequence and structure dependent . in particular",
    ", it has been proposed that binding regions in those molecules tend to be predominantly single stranded @xcite .",
    "memeris @xcite , for instance , leverages this assumption by weighting nucleotides according to their likelihood of being unpaired .",
    "these positional weights then guide meme to focus the motif search on loop regions .",
    "in contrast , rnacontext @xcite divides the single stranded contexts into known secondary substructures such as hairpins , bulge loops , inner loops , and stems .",
    "consequently , rnacontext is capable of reporting the relative preference of the structural context along with the primary structure of the potential motif .",
    "recently , hoinka et al . introduced aptamotif @xcite a method to discover sequence ",
    "structure motifs from selex derived aptamers .",
    "this method utilizes information about the structural ensemble of aptamers obtained by enumerating of all possible structures within a user - defined energy range from the minimum free energy ( mfe ) structure . by representing each aptamer by the set of its unique substructures ( i.e. hairpins , bulge - loops , inner - loops , and multibranch loops )",
    ", aptamotif applies an iterative sampling approach combined with sequence - structure alignment techniques to identify high - scoring seeds which are consequently extended to motifs over the full data set .",
    "however , aptamotif was designed for sequencing data obtained from traditional selex , under the assumption that this data predominantly consists of motif containing sequences .",
    "subsequently , aptani @xcite extended aptamotif to handle larger sequence collections via a set of parameter optimizations and sampling techniques , but it also expects a high ratio of motif occurrences .",
    "+ * still , none of the above mentioned methods * address the full spectrum of challenges when analyzing data from ht - selex selections .",
    "first , none of these approaches , as currently implemented , scales well with the data sizes produced by modern high throughput sequencing experiments .",
    "next , only a few of the methods consider the existence of secondary motifs while the majority operates under the assumption that only a singe primary motif is present in the data .",
    "this assumption might apply to tf - selex , but it can not be generalized to common purpose ht - selex but where one should consider many motifs of possibly similar strength . furthermore ,",
    "secondary structure information , which has proven effective in guiding the motif search to biologically relevant binding sites , is not included in most of these methods .",
    "a notable exception is rnacontext which can handle relatively large data sets but suffers from the single motif assumption that can not be easily removed .",
    "finally , none of these approaches attempt to utilize the full scope of the information produced by modern ht - selex experiments that includes sequencing data from multiple rounds of selection . + * in order to close this gap * , we have developed aptatrace , a method for the identification of sequence - structure motifs for ht - selex that utilizes the available data from all sequenced selection rounds , and which is robust enough to be applicable to a broad spectrum of rna / ssdna ht - selex experiments , independent of the target s properties .",
    "furthermore , aptatrace  is not limited to the detection of a single motif but capable of elucidating an arbitrary number of binding sites along with their corresponding structural preferences .",
    "aptatrace  approaches the sequence - structure motif finding problem in a novel and unique way . unlike previous methods",
    ", it does not rely on aptamer frequency or its derivative - cycle - to - cycle enrichment .",
    "aptamer frequency has been recently shown to be a poor predictor of aptamer affinity @xcite , and while cycle - to - cycle enrichment has shown a somewhat better performance , the choice of the cycles to compare is not obvious and does not always allow for extraction of sequence - structure motifs .",
    "in contrast , our method builds on tracing the dynamics of the selex process itself to uncover motif - induced selection trends .",
    "+ we applied aptatrace  to sequencing data obtained from realistically simulating selex over 10 rounds of selection ( 4 million sequences per round ) with known binding motifs as well as to an _ in vitro _ cell - selex experiment over 9 selection cycles ( 40 million sequences per cycle ) . in both cases , our method was successful in extracting highly significant sequence - structure motifs while scaling well with the 10-fold increase in data size .",
    "we start with a high - level outline of the method , followed by a more detailed description .",
    "next , we use simulated data produced with a novel , extended version of our aptasim program @xcite to compare the performance of aptatrace  to other methods that can handle similar data sizes or incorporate secondary structure into their models .",
    "finally , we show our results of applying aptatrace  to an _ in vitro _",
    "selection consisting of high - throughput data from 9 rounds of cell - selex @xcite .",
    "our method builds on accepted assumptions regarding the general ht - selex procedure .",
    "first , we assume that the affinity and specificity of aptamers are mainly attributed to a combination of localized sequence and structural features that exhibit complementary biochemical properties to a target s binding site . given a large number of molecules in the initial pool",
    "it is expected that such binding motifs are embedded in multiple , distinct aptamers .",
    "consequently , during the selection process , aptamers containing these highly target - affine sequence - structure motifs will become enriched as compared to target non - specific sequences .",
    "notably , under these assumptions , aptamers that contain only the sequence motif without the appropriate structural context are either not enriched at all or enriched to a much lower degree .",
    "the second critical assumption we make is the existence of a multitude of sequence - structure binding motifs that either compete for the same binding site , or are binding to different surface regions of the target @xcite . + leveraging the above properties of the selex protocol , aptatrace  detects sequence - structure motifs by identifying sequence motifs which undergo selection towards a particular secondary structure context .",
    "specifically , we expect that in the initial pool the structural contexts of each @xmath0-mer are distributed according to a background distribution that can be determined from the data .",
    "however , for sequence motifs involved in binding , in later selection cycles , this distribution becomes biased towards the structural context favored by the binding interaction with the target site .",
    "consequently , aptatrace  aims at identifying sequence motifs whose tendency of residing in a hairpin , bugle loop , inner loop , multiple loop , danging end , or of being paired converges to a specific structural context throughout the selection . to achieve this ,",
    "for each sequenced pool we compute the distribution of the structural contexts of all possible @xmath0-mers ( all possible nucleotides sequences of length @xmath0 ) in all aptamers .",
    "+ next , we use the relative entropy ( kl - divergence ) to estimate , for every @xmath0-mer , the change in the distribution of its secondary structure contexts ( @xmath1-context distribution , for short ) between any cycle to a later cycle .",
    "the sum of these kl - divergence scores over all pairs of selection cycles defines the context shifting score for a given @xmath0-mer .",
    "the context shifting score is thus an estimate of the selection towards the preferred structure(s ) . complementing the context shifting score is the @xmath1-context trace , which summarizes the dynamics of the changes in the @xmath1-context distribution over consecutive selection cycles .",
    "+ in order to assess the statistical significance of these context shifting scores , we additionally compute a null distribution consisting of context shifting scores derived from @xmath0-mers of all low - affinity aptamers in the selection .",
    "this background is used to determine a @xmath2-value for the structural shift for each @xmath0-mer .",
    "predicted motifs are then constructed by aggregating overlapping @xmath0-mers under the restriction that the structural preferences in the overlapped region are consistent . finally , position specific weight matrices ( pwm ) , specifically their sequence logos representing these motifs , along with their motif context traces ( the average @xmath0-context traces of the @xmath0-mers used in the pwm construction ) are reported to the user .",
    "aptatrace  takes as input the sequencing results from all , or a subset of selection cycles from an ht - selex experiment and outputs a list of position specific weight matrices ( pwms ) along with a visual representation of the motifs structural context shift throughout the selection .",
    "+   + * @xmath1-context and @xmath1-context distribution .",
    "* any individual occurrence of a @xmath0-mer in an aptamer has a specific secondary structure context called @xmath1-context that depends on the structure of that particular aptamer . in what follows ,",
    "let @xmath3 be the @xmath4-th @xmath0-mer ( using an arbitrary indexing of all @xmath5 possible @xmath0-mers over the alphabet @xmath6 ) .",
    "in addition , let @xmath7 be the set of unique aptamers sequenced in selection round @xmath8 that have a frequency above a threshold @xmath9 ( this facilitates noise reduction - see computation of @xmath2-value below and fig . [",
    "fig : overview ] , a ) .",
    "+ first , for every aptamer @xmath10 of fixed length @xmath11 in @xmath7 , we use sfold @xcite to estimate the probability for each nucleotide in @xmath10 of being part of a hairpin ( h ) , an inner loop ( i ) , a bulge loop ( b ) , a multi - loop ( m ) , a dangling end ( d ) , or being paired ( p ) ( fig .",
    "[ fig : overview ] , b ) .",
    "each aptamer @xmath10 is hence associated with a matrix of dimension @xmath12 , where @xmath13 , in which rows correspond to a particular context @xmath14 while each column contains the context probabilities of the corresponding nucleotide in @xmath10 .",
    "next , we define the @xmath1-context of a @xmath0-mer occurrence in aptamer @xmath10 as the row - wise mean of the context probabilities over the matrix columns corresponding to the location of that @xmath0-mer in the aptamer sequence",
    ". + recall , that the main idea behind aptatrace  is to track the changes in secondary structure preferences of @xmath0-mers over the selection cycles . capturing these secondary structure preferences",
    "should therefor take the entirety of @xmath1-contexts from all occurrences of a @xmath0-mer in a particular selection cycle into account .",
    "thus , we define the @xmath1-context distribution of a @xmath0-mer @xmath3 in round @xmath8 as the averaged secondary structure profile of all @xmath1-contexts of @xmath3 over all aptamers in @xmath7 .",
    "formally , let @xmath15 , where @xmath16 , be the average probability of the structural context @xmath14 over all occurrences of the @xmath0-mer @xmath3 in all aptamers that meet the threshold criteria in round @xmath8 .",
    "then , the @xmath1-context distribution of @xmath3 in round @xmath8 is the vector @xmath17 $ ] , normalized such that all entries sum up to one .",
    "[ fig : overview ] c ) .",
    "+   + * analysis of the shift of @xmath1-context distributions during selection . * if a @xmath0-mer forms part of a sequence - structure binding motif , its @xmath1-context distribution is expected to shift towards the context @xmath14 that is preferred for the binding interaction throughout the selection .",
    "in contrast , if a @xmath0-mer is not affected by selection , we expect little to no change in its context distribution over consecutive rounds",
    ". we can capture this dynamics for any @xmath0-mer @xmath3 by its so called @xmath1-context trace @xmath18 $ ] , defined as a vector tracking the @xmath1-context distribution over all @xmath19 selection cycles ( fig [ fig : overview ] d ) .",
    "our method consequently quantifies such shifts in the @xmath1-context distribution using the kullback ",
    "leibler divergence ( relative entropy )  a measure for the difference between two probability distributions . here , for any @xmath0-mer @xmath3 the first distribution corresponds to the @xmath1-context distribution @xmath20 of an earlier round @xmath8 and the second to the @xmath1-context distribution @xmath21 of a later selection cycle @xmath22 .",
    "+ the kl - divergence between two appropriately chosen selection cycles might suffice , at least for some scenarios such as tf - selex , to capture the shifts in @xmath1-context distributions . in practice however , for larger and more complex targets the selection landscape tends to be more complicated with various aptamers achieving peak enrichment at different selection cycles .",
    "thus makes it rather difficult to confidently chose such two presumably most informative cycles while ignoring remaining information .",
    "therefore we compute the cumulative kl - divergence between all pairs of sequenced pools . in summary",

    "the context shifting scores are only calculated for all @xmath0-mers with a count of at least @xmath28 individual occurrences in each pool ( here , @xmath29 ) .",
    "+   + * significance estimation and @xmath2-value computation . *",
    "while the context shifting score establishes a ranking of the @xmath0-mers in order of their overall change in secondary structure context , it does not provide any information over the statistical significance of that shift , i.e. it can not distinguish between changes in response to the true selection pressure and changes associated with background noise such as non - binding species .",
    "these background species however are expected to occur in very low numbers throughout the selection .",
    "we leverage this property by using the context shifting scores of the @xmath0-mers from these low - count aptamers to construct a null distribution that is used to identify the significant context shifting scores for the full data set .",
    "in detail , we include all @xmath0-mer occurrences from aptamers that are not included in the previous generation of the context profiles , i.e. all aptamers below or equal to the user defined threshold @xmath9 .",
    "we note that the resulting null follows a log - normal distribution in our _ in vitro _ experiment as well as for the simulation data presented in this study ( see section [ sec : experimental ] ) .",
    "+ the above described procedure hence allows for the computation of a @xmath2-value for each @xmath1-context trace and we only retain those @xmath1-context traces with @xmath2-value below a user specifiable threshold ( the default value is 0.01 ) ( fig.[fig : overview ] e - g ) . +   + * elucidating sequence - structure motifs and sequence logos . * in the last step , aptatrace  proceeds to extract the final motifs by clustering similar and overlapping @xmath0-mers with correlating , statistically significant structural shifts together ( fig [ fig : overview ] h ) .",
    "this allows to uncover sequence - structure motifs that might extend over the chosen @xmath0-mer size and to build pwms that summarize the motifs .",
    "motif construction is accomplished iteratively . until all @xmath0-mers",
    "have been assigned to a cluster , the most significant @xmath0-mer is first selected as seed , and all similar and highly overlapping @xmath0-mers with a @xmath2-value below the defined threshold and with comparable structural context are aggregated to the cluster .",

    "this data consequently serves as the basis for the challenging task of identifying suitable binding candidates and for deriving their sequence - structure properties that are key for binding affinity and specificity . except for the special case of tf binding aptamers ,",
    "no previous tool addressing this task existed .",
    "the realization that a naive relationship between aptamer frequency and their binding affinity is not universally valid , further complicates this task .",
    "several potential factors during any stage of the selection contribute to this complexity , including polymerase amplification biases , sequencing biases , contamination of foreign sequences , and non - specific binding .",
    "these factors prompted aptamer experts to consider cycle - to - cycle enrichment instead of frequency counts as a predictor for binding affinity . while cycle - to - cycle enrichment did increase the predictive power of these methods , it can not bypass problems related to amplification bias nor can it identify aptamer properties that drive binding affinity and specificity .",
    "+ in contrast , aptatrace  is specifically designed to identify sequence - structure binding motifs in ht - selex data and thus to predict the features behind binding affinity and specificity .",
    "importantly , rather than using quantitative information , it directly leverages the experimental design of the selex protocol and identifies motifs that are under selection through appropriately designed scoring functions . by focusing on local motifs that are selected for",
    ", aptatrace  bypasses global biases such as the pcr bias which is typically related to more universal sequence properties such as the cg content .",
    "in addition , because aptatrace  measures selection towards a given sequence - structure motif by the shift in the distribution of the structural context and not based on abundance , it can uncover statistically significant motifs that are selected for even when these only form a small fraction of the pool .",
    "this is an important property that can ultimately help to shorten the number of cycles needed for selection and thus to reduce the overall cost of the procedure .",
    "+ in testing on simulated data , aptatrace  outperformed other methods , in part because these methods models were not specifically designed to handle these sort of sequences .",
    "furthermore , no competitors exist that could be tested on _ in vitro _ data as none of the current programs scale to the amount of data points produced by ht - selex .",
    "while we currently have no gold standard for experimental data to measure the quality of the identified motifs , it is reassuring that the motifs converge structurally to loop regions , consistent with the accepted view where such binding sites reside .",
    "+ sequence logos provide a convenient visualization of the selected motifs . for tf - binding",
    ", information used to derive these logos can be used to estimate binding energy @xcite .",
    "however , for general ht - selex this connection is less immediate as one has to take into account the energy contribution from the structure component @xcite . perhaps even more importantly ,",
    "aptamers binding to large cell surfaces are likely to be exposed to more binding opportunities than aptamers binding to single receptors and thus the number of resulting motifs can be expressed as a function of interaction probability and binding affinity .",
    "we hypothesize that the here presented @xmath1-context trace will be helpful in untangling some of these contributions .",
    "+ finally , analysis of the @xmath1-context trace indicates that the selection signal can be identified at very early cycles .",
    "this suggests that , with deep enough sequencing , only a limited number of selection cycles might be required .",
    "yet , this analysis also shows that the dynamics of @xmath1-context traces is not the same for all sequence - structure motifs .",
    "while most trends essentially stabilize at a relatively early cycle , some continue to grow .",
    "we hypothesize that this type of information can aid the identification of the most promising binders .",
    "note that while we defined the @xmath1-context shifting score on all pairs of sequenced selection pools , it can also be used to focus the analysis to any part of the selection as long as it includes at least two cycles and hence to center on additional details of the selection dynamics .",
    "other variants of the @xmath1-context shifting score ( e.g. always using the initial pool as background / reference in the summation ) can also prove informative , however full elucidation of this dynamic will require concerted computational and experimental effort .",
    "aptatrace  is not only a powerful method to detect emerging sequence - structure motifs but also , a flexible tool to interrogate such selection dynamics .",

    "<S> selex selects binders through an iterative process that , starting from a pool of random ssdna / rna sequences , amplifies target - affine species through a series of selection cycles . </S>",
    "<S> ht - selex , which combines selex with high throughput sequencing , has recently transformed aptamer development and has opened the field to even more applications . </S>",
    "<S> ht - selex is capable of generating over half a billion data points , challenging computational scientists with the task of identifying aptamer properties such as sequence structure motifs that determine binding . while currently available motif finding approaches suggest partial solutions to this question , none possess the generality or scalability required for ht - selex data , and they do not take advantage of important properties of the experimental procedure . +   + we present aptatrace , a novel approach for the identification of sequence - structure binding motifs in ht - selex derived aptamers . </S>",
    "<S> our approach leverages the experimental design of the selex protocol and identifies sequence - structure motifs that show a signature of selection . because of its unique approach , aptatrace  can uncover motifs even when these are present in only a minuscule fraction of the pool . due to these features , </S>",
    "<S> our method can help to reduce the number of selection cycles required to produce aptamers with the desired properties , thus reducing cost and time of this rather expensive procedure . </S>",
    "<S> the performance of the method on simulated and real data indicates that aptatrace  can detect sequence - structure motifs even in highly challenging data . </S>"
