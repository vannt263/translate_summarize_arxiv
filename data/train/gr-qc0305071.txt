    "the computation of gravitational wave production from the interaction and merger of compact astrophysical objects is a challenge which , when solved , will provide a predictive and analytical resource for the upcoming gravitational wave detectors .",
    "a binary black hole system is expected to be the strongest possible astrophysical gravitational wave source . in particular",
    ", one expects a binary black hole system to progress through a series of quasi - equilibrium states of narrowing circular orbits as it emits gravitational radiation . in the final moments of stellar mass black hole inspiral , the radiation will be detectable in the current ( ligo - class ) detectors .",
    "if the total binary mass is of the order of @xmath0 , the moment of final plunge to coalescence will emit a signal detectable by the current generation of detectors from very distant ( gpc ) sources .",
    "detecting gravitational radiation is also a significant technical challenge .",
    "gravitational waves couple very weakly to matter , and the expected signals are much smaller in amplitude than ambient environmental and thermal noise .",
    "the successful detection of these waves , therefore , requires some knowledge of what to look for . in this regard ,",
    "an orbiting binary black hole system is an ideal candidate for detection since the orbital motion produces regular gravitational radiation patterns .",
    "in such an inspiraling black hole system , the strongest waves are emitted during the last several orbits , as the holes reach the innermost quasi - stable orbit ( here abbreviated isco ) , and as they continue through the final plunge .",
    "the dynamics of the holes during these final orbits , especially the orbital angular velocity , @xmath1 , and separation , @xmath2 , determine the dominant characteristics of the detectable waves .",
    "any knowledge of these parameters is advantageous for detecting radiation from these binary systems .",
    "the proper way to predict gravitational waveforms for orbiting black holes is to set initial data for two widely separated holes , and then solve the evolution equations to follow the inspiral through merger and beyond .",
    "this problem is well beyond the capabilities of current evolution codes .",
    "therefore , to obtain some information about orbiting black holes we , and others  @xcite , turn to the initial value problem .",
    "for an introduction to the literature , see the review by cook  @xcite . given a collection of initial data for black holes in circular orbits with decreasing radius , one tries to identify a sequence of initial data that corresponds to instantaneous images of a time - dependent evolution .",
    "circular orbits are chosen because orbits in the early stages of an inspiral are predicted to become circularized because of the stronger gravitational radiation near periapse  @xcite .",
    "when a suitable sequence of initial data slices has been obtained , they can then be used to determine various orbital parameters .",
    "for example , the change in binding energy with respect to the orbital radius allows one to identify @xmath2 , and a similar analysis of the angular momentum gives @xmath3 .",
    "the difficulty in this approach comes in ensuring that the initial data at one radius correspond to the same physical system as the data for another radius .",
    "this can be done for some systems by using conserved quantities .",
    "for example , in the case of neutron stars , constant baryon number is an unambiguous indicator of the sameness of the stars .",
    "however , in black hole physics it is not available ; it is unclear how to determine that two black hole initial data sets do , in fact , represent the same physical system .",
    "the initial data approach to studying binary black holes is thus not without problems .",
    "these difficulties fall in two broad areas .",
    "first , there is no unambiguous way to set initial data in general relativity .",
    "the current algorithms all require some arbitrary mathematical choices to find a solution .",
    "for instance , the approach we take requires the definition of the topology of a background space and of its metric and the momentum of the metric , followed by solution of four coupled elliptic differential equations for variables that adjust the background fields .",
    "but the choice of the background quantities is arbitrary to a large extent .",
    "the physical meaning of these mathematical choices is not completely clear , but the effect is unmistakable .",
    "data constructed with various algorithms can differ substantially , even when attempting to describe the same physical system  @xcite .",
    "the data sets can be demonstrated in many circumstances to contain the expected newtonian binding energy , as we show below ( i.e. , the binding energy of order @xmath4 agrees with the newtonian result at this order ) . however , the data can differ significantly at @xmath5 .",
    "these differences are attributed to differences in wave content of the data which may reflect possible prior motion or may simply be spurious . at present",
    "it is neither possible to build prior motion into the initial data , nor to specify how radiation is added to the the solution , nor to know how much there is .",
    "it is known that the circular orbits and the isco so determined are in fact method - dependent .",
    "furthermore , the methods need not even agree that a specific dataset represents a circular orbit ; their subsequent evolutions may not agree  @xcite .    a second problem  and the principal physical difficulty with the initial data method for studying black hole binaries  is the lack of unambiguous conserved quantities .",
    "the best candidate for an invariant quantity is the event horizon area , @xmath6 .",
    "this area is unchanging for isentropic processes due to the proportionality of @xmath6 with the black hole entropy .",
    "one can argue that since the quasi - circular orbit is quasi - adiabatic , @xmath6 is nearly invariant over some phase of the inspiral .",
    "but the inspiral can not be completely adiabatic because it can not be made arbitrarily slow ; the black holes will absorb an unknown amount of gravitational radiation while in orbit and will thereby increase in size .",
    "moreover , the event horizon is a global construct of the spacetime , and can not be determined from a single slice of initial data .",
    "therefore , one must use the apparent horizon area , @xmath7 , as an _ ersatz _ invariant for initial data studies  @xcite .",
    "when the hole is approximately stationary , these horizon areas may be nearly equal  @xcite .",
    "in dynamic configurations  as should be appropriate for orbiting holes  these horizon areas may differ substantially  @xcite .",
    "we will investigate physical content of initial data , focusing on kerr - schild spacetimes .",
    "we examine binding energy to leading order , and find that in our method of constructing the superposed kerr - schild data , the background fields contain the newtonian binding energy : the subsequent solution of the elliptic equations yields a only small correction . using numerical solutions we present",
    "orbital configurations with solved initial data .",
    "we give a qualitative discussion of physical effects that may confound any attempt to study inspiral via a sequence of initial data , and which may affect the determination of the location of the isco .",
    "we give some computational examples consistent with these qualitative predictions .",
    "in the computational approach we take a cauchy formulation ( 3 + 1 ) of the adm type , after arnowitt , deser , and misner  @xcite . in such a method",
    "the 3-metric @xmath8 is the fundamental variable .",
    "the 3-metric and its momentum are specified at one initial time on a spacelike hypersurface .",
    "the adm metric is s^2 = -(^2 - _ i ^i)t^2 + 2_i",
    "t x^i + g_ij x^i x^j [ eq : admmetric ] where @xmath9 is the lapse function and @xmath10 is the shift 3-vector .",
    "latin indices run @xmath11 and are lowered and raised by @xmath12 and its 3-dimensional inverse @xmath13 . @xmath9 and @xmath10 are gauge functions that relate the coordinates on each hypersurface to each other .",
    "the extrinsic curvature , @xmath14 , plays the role of momentum conjugate to the metric , and describes the embedding of a @xmath15 hypersurface into the 4-geometry .",
    "the einstein field equations contain both hyperbolic evolution equations , and elliptic constraint equations .",
    "the constraint equations for vacuum in the adm decomposition are : r - k_ijk^ij + k^2 & = & 0 , [ eq : constrainth ] _",
    "j k^ij - g^ijk&= & 0 .",
    "[ eq : constraintk ]    here @xmath16 is the 3-dimensional ricci scalar , and @xmath17 is the 3-dimensional covariant derivative compatible with @xmath12 .",
    "these constraint equations guarantee a kind of transversality of the momentum ( ) .",
    "initial data must satisfy these constraint equations ; one may not freely specify all components of @xmath8 and @xmath14 .",
    "the initial value problem in general relativity thus requires one to consistently identify and separate constrained and freely - specifiable parts of the initial data .",
    "methods for making this separation , and solving the constraints as an elliptic system , include : the _ conformal transverse - traceless decomposition _",
    "@xcite ; the _ physical transverse - traceless decomposition _",
    "@xcite : and the _ conformal thin sandwich decomposition _ which assumes a helical killing vector  @xcite .",
    "these methods all involve arbitrary choices and do not produce equivalent data .",
    "our solution method uses the conformal transverse - traceless decomposition  @xcite .",
    "solutions of the initial value problem have been addressed in the past by several groups  @xcite .",
    "it is the case that until recently , most data have been constructed assuming that the initial 3-space is conformally flat .",
    "the method most commonly used is the approach of bowen and york  @xcite , which chooses maximal spatial hypersurfaces and takes the spatial 3-metric to be conformally flat .",
    "this method has been used to find candidate quasi - circular orbits by cook  @xcite , baumgarte  @xcite , and most recently , pfeiffer _ et al . _",
    "@xcite .",
    "the chief advantage of the maximal spatial hypersurface approach is numerical simplicity , as the choice @xmath18 decouples the hamiltonian constraint from the momentum constraint equations . if , besides @xmath19 , the conformal background is flat euclidean 3-space , there are known @xmath14 that analytically solve the momentum constraint  @xcite .",
    "the constraints then reduce to one elliptic equation for the conformal factor @xmath20 .",
    "however , it has been pointed out by garat and price  @xcite that there are no conformally flat @xmath21 slices of the kerr spacetime .",
    "since we expect astrophysical sources to be rotating , the choice of a conformally flat @xmath21 background will yield data that necessarily contains some quantity of  junk \" gravitational radiation .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite have recently shown by comparison with known solutions that conformally flat data do indeed contain a significant amount of unphysical gravitational field .",
    "another conformally flat @xmath21 method recently used by gourgoulhon , grandclement , and bonazzola  @xcite is a thin sandwich approximation based on the approach of wilson and mathews  @xcite which assumes the presence of an instantaneous rotation killing vector to define the initial extrinsic curvature .",
    "they impose a specific gauge defined by demanding that @xmath22 and the conformal factor remain constant in the rotating frame .",
    "since @xmath20 and @xmath22 are a conjugate pair in the adm approach , this method solves the four initial value equations and one second - order evolution equation .",
    "the assumption of a killing vector suppresses radiation or , perhaps more accurately , imposes a condition of equal ingoing and outgoing radiation .    in this paper",
    "we use kerr - schild data  @xcite to outline some of the difficulties in finding the isco using the initial data technique .",
    "we discuss the extent to which initial data set by means of superposed kerr - schild black holes limits the extraneous radiation in the data sets , and we estimate the accuracy of the extant published isco determinations .",
    "recent works by pfeiffer , cook , and teukolsky also investigate binary black hole systems using kerr - schild initial data  @xcite .",
    "the superposed kerr - schild method for setting black hole initial data , developed by matzner , huq , and shoemaker  @xcite , produces data for black holes of arbitrary masses , boosts , and spins without relying on any underlying symmetries of any particular configuration .",
    "the method proceeds in two parts .",
    "first , a background metric and background extrinsic curvature are constructed by superposing individual kerr - schild black hole solutions",
    ". then the physical data are generated by solving the four coupled constraint equations for corrections to the background .",
    "intuitively , the background solution should be very close to the genuine solution when the black holes are widely separated , and only small adjustments to the gravitational fields are required to solve the constraints .",
    "we show that this is true for large and also for small separations .",
    "this section briefly reviews the superposed kerr - schild method for initial data , then gives some analytic results to justify this contention .",
    "the kerr - schild  @xcite form of a black hole solution describes the spacetime of a single black hole with mass , @xmath23 , and specific angular momentum , @xmath24 , in a coordinate system that is well behaved at the horizon .",

    "each term on the right hand side of this equation is known analytically .",

    "<S> an orbiting black hole binary will generate strong gravitational radiation signatures , making these binaries important candidates for detection in gravitational wave observatories . </S>",

    "<S> we present convergence results for our initial data solutions , and give data from numerical solutions of the constraint equations representing a range of physical configurations . in a first attempt to understand the physical content of the initial data , we find that the newtonian binding energy is contained in the superposed kerr - schild background before the constraints are solved . we examine some deficiencies with the initial data approach to orbiting binaries , especially touching on the effects of prior motion and spin - orbital coupling of the angular momenta . making rough estimates of these effects , </S>",
    "<S> we find that they are not insignificant compared to the binding energy , leaving some doubt of the utility of using initial data to predict isco parameters . in computations of specific initial - data configurations we find spin - specific effects that are consistent with analytical estimates . </S>"
