    "the multipole expansion of the latter involves only the angular part of the wave functions and we shall show results valid for angular - momentum eigenstates irrespective of the radial part .",
    "our method involves some manipulations of spherical harmonics , which may appear tedious , but provide a welcome opportunity to develop skills , which are of use in other applications of quantum mechanics .",

    "of course , the electronic states in a magnetic material are different from the ones bound to free atoms .",

    "these and similar regularities found in table 2 follow from the fact that the l - th order multipole component of the current density operator is an irreducible tensor operator of rank l.      the current density associated with the electron spin for eigenfunctions of the spin operator @xmath40 has been given in reference [ 1 ] as @xmath84 @xmath85 where @xmath86 as in the previous section ( iii.i ) , eq .",

    "this feature is inherent in the expression ( 31 ) , which shows that the spin - current density , unlike the orbital one , eq.(20 ) , can not be written as a single product of an r - dependent and an angle - dependent factor .",
    "the eigenfunctions of the total angular momentum being superpositions of the two eigenfunctions of @xmath40 , the calculation of the expectation values of the current densities involves two - component spinors . as in the previous case , we find that the spin current density is not factorized in radial and angular parts . however , it turns out that the total current density can be written as a single product of @xmath14- and @xmath16-dependent functions .",
