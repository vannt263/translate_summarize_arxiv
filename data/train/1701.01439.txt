    "we this section we evaluate one possible re - acceleration model to investigate the spectral index distribution across the relic .",
    "we first created a radio profile across the width of the relic , using the regions indicated in supplementary fig .",
    "[ fig : radioregion ] .",
    "the resulting radio profiles are displayed in supplementary fig .",
    "[ fig : profilekang ] .    for modeling the spectral change during re - acceleration and the radio profiles in the shock downstream region , we follow the method outlined by@xcite for re - acceleration .",
    "we assume that a spherical shock sweeps through a magnetized gas cloud containing fossil relativistic electrons , while propagating through a density gradient of @xmath85 in the cluster outskirts .",
    "the simulated profiles are convolved to a spatial resolution of 20  kpc .",
    "the post - shock temperature is set to @xmath86  kev , which was determined from the chandra data in the region north of the relic .",
    "the radius of the shock is assumed to be 1.0  mpc .",
    "the geometry of the cloud is the same as described in@xcite .",
    "the pre - shock magnetic field is 1.5  @xmath24gauss , and the magnetic field strength across the shock transition is assumed to increase due to the compression of two perpendicular components .",
    "note that the shock speed and the post - shock magnetic field strength vary in time as the shock slows in the cluster outskirts .",
    "the fossil electrons are assumed to have the energy spectrum , @xmath87 $ ] , where the cutoff lorentz factor is @xmath88 .",
    "the slope of @xmath89 is a typical injection index for agn @xcite , which corresponds to a radio spectral index of @xmath90 ( @xmath91 ) .",
    "the cutoff ( @xmath92 ) at the end of the tail , just before re - acceleration , is set to match the @xmath93 between 0.325 and 3.0  ghz .",
    "the  extension angle \" is @xmath94@xcite .",
    "the best matching model has a sonic mach number of @xmath95 at the time shown in supplementary fig .",
    "[ fig : profilekang ] , where we can reproduce the spectral change from @xmath93 just before re - acceleration to @xmath96 at the relic .",
    "the post - shock magnetic field has a value of 2.9  @xmath24gauss .",
    "we note that the observed profiles are wider than the simulated ones and that the mach number is somewhat higher than the upper limit determined from the x - ray observations . in our modeling , we assumed the relic is seen edge - on with respect to the shock normal .",
    "if this is not the case , the observed profiles would widen .",
    "our mach number estimates are also somewhat uncertain due to the assumptions that were made when fitting the x - ray surface brightness profile .",
    "we also evaluated a model with a flatter injection index of @xmath97 ( @xmath98 ) . in that case",
    ", we find a best matching sonic mach number of @xmath99 . given the uncertainties in the geometry , simplifying assumptions made in the modeling , and unknown distribution of fossil plasma before re - acceleration",
    ", we consider the match with the data reasonable .",
    "it is expected that for a tailed radio galaxy , the shape of the energy spectrum of the fossil electrons changes with distance from the nucleus .",
    "thus the spectral index along the shock front , towards the west , is expected to steepen . however , the observed spectral index along the relic s extent is rather uniform .",
    "we therefore extended our model to investigate what spectral index trend is to be expected , taking into account the predicted spectral steepening along the original tail of fossil plasma .",
    "we first estimate the amount of spectral steepening that is expected along the 150  kpc extent of the relic in the spectral index map . assuming that the distance between the core and the end of the tail ( where @xmath100 ) is about 90  kpc , the mean jet velocity is estimated to be @xmath101  km  s@xmath25 ( for @xmath89 , @xmath102 , and a cooling time of @xmath103  yr ) . the distance from the ne corner to the sw corner of the relic is about 150  kpc .",
    "the cooling or advection time of the jet is estimated to be @xmath104 yr over this 150  kpc . in that case , the cutoff lorentz factor should decrease from @xmath105 to @xmath106 .",
    "this leads to spectral ageing from @xmath107 to @xmath108 along the relic s length .",
    "when then rerun our model , changing the input @xmath109 .",
    "the resulting spectral profiles after re - acceleration are shown in supplementary fig .",
    "[ fig : profilesteeperfossiltrend ] . at the relic s ne corner with @xmath107 ,",
    "re - acceleration changes the spectral index to @xmath110 , the result we obtained before . at the sw corner with @xmath108 ,",
    "re - acceleration changes the spectral index back to @xmath111 .",
    "so we can see that the re - acceleration leads to a relatively uniform spectral index along the relic s extent , even though the original fossil distribution shows considerable change .",
    "while this model does explain the relatively uniform spectral index along this particular relic , it is worth noting that it might have trouble explaining the constant spectral indices for mpc - size relics along their lengths ( unless the shock mach number is higher or the spectral index distribution of the fossil plasma does not show extremely large variations ) .",
    "in addition , there could be other challenges for the `` dsa - type '' re - acceleration model described in this section , see @xcite .",
    "3 ) galaxy spectroscopic redshifts within the cluster redshift range .",
    "the north ( a3411 ) brightest - cluster - galaxy ( bcg ) redshift is indicated by the red arrow , and the southern ( a3412 ) bcg redshift is indicated by the blue arrow . ]      to determine which galaxies are members of the abell 3411 and 3412 subclusters , we utilize both spectroscopic and red sequence cluster member selection methods .",
    "the spectroscopic sample has the advantage of being a purer sample and the precise redshifts are a necessity for many of the following analyses . while the red sequence sample is not as pure ,",
    "it is more complete and it is not subject to the under sampling bias that affects the spectroscopic sample ; thus it is advantageous for some analyses .    for the red sequence sample , we selected cluster members by first separating galaxies from stars using a size - magnitude relation based on the subaru imaging ( note that this separation is much more effective for the subaru imaging than for the int / wfc imaging described in the methods section of the main article ) .",
    "we identified the red sequence in a color - magnitude diagram with @xmath112 as the color and @xmath70 as the magnitude .",
    "we used the spectroscopic survey to inform the red sequence selection ( see supplementary fig .",
    "[ fig : colormagdiag ] ) and estimate the purity of the red sequence selection . for the spectroscopic objects , we find that 196 lie within the red sequence selection bounds . of these",
    "78% are cluster galaxies , 0 are foreground galaxies , 13% are background galaxies , and 9% are stars .",
    "no one subcluster identification method is optimal for all types of subcluster configurations , so we employ three separate complementary methods of subcluster identification .",
    "the first is a projected galaxy number / luminosity over - density analysis , the second is an expectation - maximization gaussian mixture model ( em - gmm ) clustering analysis , and the third is a markov chain monte carlo gaussian mixture model ( mcmc - gmm ) clustering analysis .",
    "we generated red sequence galaxy number density and luminosity density maps and bootstrapped to estimate the projected separation between the peaks of the two subclusters . from fig .  1 ( main article )",
    ", it is clear that there are two dominant subclusters in projected space ( corresponding to a3411 and a3412 ) , but there are also small substructures to the north of a3411 and one northeast of a3412 .",
    "we find that the corresponding spectroscopic cluster galaxy density maps agree well ( see supplementary fig .",
    "[ fig : speczdensity ] ) , except that they do not show the smaller substructures since these lie outside the deimos spectroscopic survey area .    .",

    "we consider mixtures of 1 to 7 multivariate gaussian components with a diagonal ( _ diag _ ) covariance structure , where each gaussian component has an uncorrelated covariance structure .",
    "while this covariance structure prevents angled elliptical halos , we find that the other covariance structures in _ scikit - learn _ s gmm package offer too much flexibility ( e.g. , the _ full _ , where each gaussian component can have a different unstructured covariance , results in unphysical solutions where some subclusters have substantial coherent rotations ) .",
    "for each number of components ( @xmath114 ) , we calculate the bic ( bayesian information criterion ) and use this to infer the optimal number of subclusters .",

    "for convenience of interpretation , we color - code regions of the @xmath117bic plot according to the broad model comparison categories suggested by@xcite .    we find that , of the models considered , the two - component gaussian model is the most favored one ( see supplementary fig .",

    "these translate to a relative line - of - sight ( los ) velocity difference in the frame of the cluster of @xmath121 .",

    "we expect that the velocity dispersion mass estimates of a3411 and a3412 are not significantly biased because they have a projected separation of @xmath131mpc , the dynamics analysis suggests ( see the next paragraph ) that the time - since - collision ( tsc ) is @xmath132gyr , and the angle of the merger axis with respect to the plane - of - the - sky ( @xmath6 ) is @xmath133",

    "<S> radio relics , elongated sources that trace the cr at icm shocks , provide us with rare opportunities to probe this process . while there is substantial evidence that relics trace cr electrons at shocks @xcite </S>",

    "<S> this low efficiency is hard to reconcile with the observed brightness of some radio relics , suggesting a high acceleration efficiency @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , some relics have regions with rather flat radio spectra ( @xmath4 ; @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the spectral index ) , but the corresponding shock mach numbers measured via x - ray observations are low @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this contradicts with the prediction from dsa @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this long - standing problem has so far remained unsolved . </S>",

    "<S> the synchrotron lifetime of relativistic electrons in the icm is relatively short ( @xmath8  yrs ) . </S>",
    "<S> once these electrons have lost most of their energy , they do not radiate within the observable radio band and they thus become invisible to radio telescopes . it has been suggested that these fossil electrons , which have gyr lifetimes , can be efficiently re - accelerated at shocks and are therefore able to create bright radio relics @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> obvious candidates for these fossil electrons are the ( old ) lobes and tails of radio galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> this fossil radio plasma can occupy a significant volume of the icm due to turbulent diffusion , aided by the random galaxy motions throughout the icm and the icm motion itself . indeed , observational evidence has been found that provides support for this model . </S>",

    "<S> this cluster contains a mpc - size radio relic with an irregular shape @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> chandra observations , totaling 211  ks , reveal a cluster with a cometary morphology undergoing a major merger event , with the compact core of one of the subclusters being the `` head '' of the comet ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : mergeroverview ] ) . a dynamical analysis based on keck spectra of 174 cluster members and subaru imaging , </S>",
    "<S> indicates that this is an approximately 1:1 mass ratio merger viewed @xmath10  gyr after core passage , with the merger axis being located close to the plane of the sky . </S>",
    "<S> the two subclusters are both very massive , with individual masses of @xmath11  m@xmath12 . the core of the cluster coming in from the south ( and currently observed in the north ) was compact enough to survive the collision with the other cluster up to the present time , while the gas core of the subcluster that came in from the north was largely disrupted during the core passage .    the giant metrewave radio telescope ( gmrt ) radio images at 610 and 325  mhz show the complex , large radio relic located in the southern outskirts of the merging cluster ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : gmrt610 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> most interestingly , a close inspection of the northeastern component of the radio relic reveals an elongated narrow extension that leads from the relic towards a galaxy ( source  a , figs .  </S>",

    "<S> this galaxy is a spectroscopically confirmed cluster member ( @xmath13 ) . a high - resolution 3  ghz very large array ( vla ) image shows an active galactic nucleus ( agn ; radio core ) at the galaxy s center . from the core , a narrow tail `` feeds '' into the radio relic located @xmath14  kpc to its south . </S>",
    "<S> this reveals a direct connection between the relativistic plasma of an agn and that of a radio relic . </S>",
    "<S> the probability of a chance projection of a tailed radio galaxy with this relic is @xmath15 .    </S>",
    "<S> our radio spectral index measurements , between 0.325 and 3.0  ghz show that the radio spectrum steepens away with distance from the compact nucleus from @xmath16 to @xmath17 ( @xmath18 errors ) , as is expected for synchrotron and inverse compton losses ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : spix]b ) . remarkably , where the radio plasma from the agn connects to the radio relic , the spectrum flattens back to @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> this flattening is strong evidence for the re - acceleration of electrons from the radio tail at a shock . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we find evidence for spectral steepening across the relic in the direction towards the cluster center . </S>",
    "<S> these gradients have routinely been found for other relics and they are explained by electron energy losses in the downstream region of an outwards traveling shock @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we also find the outer edge of the relic is polarized , with a maximum polarization fraction of @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> the emission weighted average polarization fraction is 13% ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : spix]c ) . </S>",
    "<S> the relatively modest spectral flattening at the shock suggests that the shock can not be very strong . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the existence of a downstream spectral index gradient ( see fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : spix]b ) suggests that the relic can not be solely caused by the adiabatic compression of a lobe of fossil radio plasma .    to search for the shock , we extracted a 0.52  kev chandra surface brightness profile in a sector containing the relic and fitted the profile by assuming an underlying broken power - law density model . at large radii , </S>",
    "<S> the density profiles of galaxy clusters are typically described by single power - laws . </S>",
    "<S> however , the profile across the ne part of the relic steepens swiftly near the relic s outer edge and shows a significant departure from a single power - law , indicating a deviation from hydrostatic equilibrium as expected for a shock ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : profile ] ) . from the profile we find that the shock must be rather weak , with @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> this upper limit should be considered an approximate estimate due to the idealized assumptions about the shock geometry and projection effects .    </S>",
    "<S> our observations of ( 1 ) a direct connection between a radio galaxy and the relic , ( 2 ) spectral flattening at the location where the radio tail meets the relic , ( 3 ) the presence of an x - ray surface brightness discontinuity at the relic s outer edge , and ( 4 ) a high polarization fraction at the location of flattest spectral indices provide the best evidence to date that radio galaxies in clusters provide seed electrons that can be re - accelerated and revived by merger shocks . </S>",
    "<S> re - acceleration ( and also adiabatic compression ) alleviates the problem of the low - acceleration efficiency from the thermal pool . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , it provides a natural explanation why some cluster merger shocks have no corresponding radio relics . </S>",
    "<S> those cases may lack a sufficient supply of fossil radio plasma . </S>",
    "<S> finally , re - acceleration also solves the problem of the relatively flat spectral indices observed from relics , which for dsa , requires shocks that have higher mach numbers than observed in x - rays @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> different re - acceleration models have been proposed . in one of these models , </S>",
    "<S> fossil relativistic electrons are re - accelerated by a dsa - like process @xcite in combination with adiabatic compression . in another model </S>",
    "<S> , the re - acceleration happens in the shock downstream region by magneto - hydrodynamical turbulence @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> future work is needed to determine which of these re - acceleration mechanisms operates at radio relics @xcite , and determine whether re - acceleration is required to explain all relics . </S>",
    "<S> we evaluate one of these re - acceleration models in the _ supplementary information _ to investigate what mach number is required to flatten the spectral index by the observed amount and examine the relatively uniform spectral index along the length of the shock front .    the abell  3411 - 3412 cluster contains at least two additional radio galaxies about 2  to the south and 2  to southwest of the one described above ( sources  b and  c ; fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : gmrt610 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> one of the radio galaxies is embedded within the relic emission , for the other , a tail of steep spectrum radio emission extends towards the relic . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that it is therefore likely that the other components of the complex relic in abell  3411 - 3412 also trace revived fossil plasma , either by the process of adiabatic compression or by re - acceleration . </S>",
    "<S> re - acceleration should also operate in other clusters because more examples of radio galaxies near relics have been found ( i.e. , in the coma cluster ) . </S>",
    "<S> our findings imply that pic simulations and laboratory laser experiments@xcite for collisionless shocks should include a relativistic fossil electron distribution in the upstream plasma . </S>",
    "<S> this study also indicates that to understand the non - thermal component of the icm , the presence and distribution of radio galaxies needs to be taken into account , in addition to particle acceleration at shocks . </S>",
    "<S> observations at low radio frequencies , in particular with lofar , will be key to unveiling the connections between relics and agn , because low - frequency observations are sensitive to older , fossil radio plasma .      </S>",

    "<S> the data were reduced with the chav package , following the processing described in@xcite and applying the caldb 4.6.7 calibration files . </S>",
    "<S> this processing includes filtering of bad events by checking for periods of high background , corrections for the time dependence of the charge transfer inefficiency and gain , removal of readout artifacts , background subtraction , and exposure correction . for the background subtraction </S>",
    "<S> , we used standard blank sky background files . </S>",
    "<S> the images of the separate exposures were then combined into a single image , binning with a factor of 4 ( i.e. , 2  pixel@xmath25 ) .      </S>",
    "<S> we fit the x - ray surface brightness profile with an updated version of proffit . </S>",
    "<S> we model the profile using an underlying broken power - law density model @xmath38 the subscripts 1 and 2 refer to the up and downstream regions , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the parameter @xmath39 denotes the location of the jump , @xmath40 is the normalization constant , @xmath41 the shock compression factor , @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the slopes of the power - laws . this density model </S>",
    "<S> is then projected along the line of sight to obtain an x - ray surface brightness profile , assuming prolate spheroidal geometry within the sector . </S>",
    "<S> the emissivity is taken to be proportional to the density squared .    in the case of a shock </S>",
    "<S> , the compression factor can be related to the shock mach number @xmath44^{1/2 }    \\mbox { , } \\label{eq : machne}\\ ] ] where @xmath45 is the adiabatic index of the gas . </S>",
    "<S> we assume @xmath46 for the thermal plasma .    </S>",
    "<S> we fit the surface brightness profile in an elliptical sector that crosses the radio relic ( see the si ) , using the model given in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : densmodel ] . the opening angles ( @xmath47 ) </S>",
    "<S> were chosen after visual inspection of the chandra image ( see the si ) , which indicates a possible surface brightness edge at the relic location and extending @xmath48 further to the west . </S>",
    "<S> for the radial binning of photons , we require a snr of 5 per bin . </S>",
    "<S> we exclude the regions affected by point sources during the fitting . the observed profile and most best fitting model is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : profile ] . </S>",
    "<S> we find a break in the x - ray surface brightness profile at the location of the radio relic . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting density jump is small @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) , with a 90% confidence upper limit of @xmath51 , indicating that the mach number is low @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> the 90% lower confidence limit is @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> the location of the jump is indicated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : spix]b .    </S>",
    "<S> we also extracted a profile in a spherical sector ( see the si ) . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting fitted compression factor is slightly lower with @xmath54 , but consistent with the previous results . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we checked whether the results changed for a smaller opening angle , corresponding to the relic s visible extent in the 610 and 325  mhz images ( i.e. , an opening angle of @xmath55 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this did not result in significant changes for the values of the compression factor or discontinuity location . </S>",
    "<S> we also slightly varied the placement of the sector , again obtaining consistent results . </S>",
    "<S> therefore we conclude that the presence of a jump does not depend on the precise sector placement and shape . for comparison , in the si </S>",
    "<S> we show a model with a density jump of @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) in the elliptical sector , which does not provide a good match to the data .    </S>",
    "<S> a small `` bump '' is visible in the x - ray surface brightness profile at a radial distance of 4.5- 5.0  ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : profile ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the nature of this bump is unclear . ignoring this bump increases the best - fitting compression factor and the 90% confidence upper limit to @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) .    from the x - ray surface brightness profile </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that there is evidence for a deviation from hydrostatic equilibrium as expected if a shock were present . </S>",
    "<S> the location of the discontinuity coincides with the location of the relic , and also agrees with the location found by visual inspection of the chandra image . </S>",
    "<S> the modeling suggests that the underlying density jump must be rather low ( @xmath58 , @xmath59 ) . </S>",
    "<S> some caution is required in interpreting the derived mach number and upper limits , since it depends on the assumptions made in the modeling . </S>",
    "<S> given the extra substructure in this region , as seen in the chandra image , some of the assumptions might be incorrect . </S>",
    "<S> the unknown projection effects and shock geometry typically result in underestimation of the mach number and our derived values should therefore be considered as lower limits .    </S>",
    "<S> another way to constrain the mach number , and rule out the presence of a cold front , is to determine the temperatures on both sides of the discontinuity ( in a small enough region not be affected by other cluster substructure ) . </S>",
    "<S> an advantage of this method is that temperature measurements are less affected by the unknown geometry . </S>",
    "<S> however , the count rate in the region south of the discontinuity is very low , and therefore we are not able to obtain useful constraints on the pre - shock x - ray gas temperature .      the optical spectrum of the agn host galaxy that `` fuels '' the relic ( ra 08@xmath6042@xmath6113@xmath62.73 ; dec @xmath63173112.1 ) was acquired using the goodman spectrograph on the southern astrophysical research telescope ( soar ) telescope . </S>",
    "<S> the observations were conducted on november 19 , 2015 , as part of program so2015b-020 . </S>",
    "<S> the basic setup included the 600  l  mm@xmath64 grating ( blue setting ) , and a 1@xmath6503 slit . </S>",
    "<S> the wavelength range of the observed spectrum was 3500 - 5500 , with a resolving power of @xmath66 and s / n@xmath67  pixel@xmath25 at 4500 . </S>",
    "<S> calibration frames included cu and hgar arc - lamp exposures , quartz - lamp flat - fields , and bias frames . </S>",
    "<S> the data reduction , including spectral extraction and wavelength calibration , were performed using standard iraf routines ( http://iraf.noao.edu ) .    </S>",
    "<S> a soar optical spectrum of the agn host galaxy is shown in the si . from the spectrum </S>",
    "<S> we determine a redshift of @xmath68 , consistent with the galaxy being a cluster member .      </S>",
    "<S> we carried out deep imaging observations of the abell  3411 - 3412 system with subaru suprimecam@xcite on 2014 february 24 in @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 with integrations of 720s , 2880s , and 720s , respectively ( p.i . </S>",
    "<S> d. wittman ) . </S>",
    "<S> we took 4 exposures for @xmath69 and @xmath71 , and 8 exposures for @xmath70 . </S>",
    "<S> we rotated the field between each exposure ( 30  for @xmath69 and @xmath71 , and 15  for @xmath70 ) in order to distribute the bleeding trails and diffraction spikes from bright stars azimuthally and later removed them by median - stacking exposures . </S>",
    "<S> this scheme enables us to maximize the number of detected galaxies , especially considering the number of stars at a3411 - 3412 s low galactic latitude ( + 15 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the average seeing for the images was @xmath72 . </S>",
    "<S> the details of the subaru data reduction are similar to those presented in@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the primary objective for the spectroscopic survey was to maximize the number of cluster member spectroscopic redshifts . </S>",
    "<S> since the suprimecam imaging was unavailable at the time of the spectroscopic survey planning , we took images with the isaac newton telescope wide field camera ( int / wfc ) , on 2013 october 31 in @xmath69 and @xmath71 bands , to determine the approximate red sequence of the cluster and preferentially selected those galaxies followed by potential blue cloud galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> these int / wfc data were reduced with our in - house python - based pipeline@xcite briefly , the sky flats for each filter were median - combined to obtain a ` master - flat ' . </S>",
    "<S> a ` master - bias ' was obtained by median - combining biases . </S>",
    "<S> the individual exposures were then bias - subtracted and sky - flattened . </S>",
    "<S> astrometric solutions were obtained by using scamp@xcite , and images were zero - point calibrated with the fourth united states naval observatory ( usno ) ccd astrograph catalog ( ucac4)@xcite , before being stacked / combined using swarp@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the difficulty of star - galaxy separation is compounded by the 1.5@xmath73 - 2@xmath73 seeing of the int / wfc imaging , which results in many blended pairs of stars passing morphological cuts designed to eliminate point sources . </S>",
    "<S> we observed the abell  3411 - 3412 system with the deimos@xcite instrument on the keck ii 10 m telescope on 2013 , december  3 and  4 . </S>",
    "<S> observations were taken using 1  wide slits with the 1200linemm@xmath25 grating , resulting in a pixel scale of @xmath74pixel@xmath25 and a resolution of @xmath75  ( 50kms@xmath25 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the grating was tilted to a central wavelength of 6650 , resulting in a typical wavelength coverage of 5350  to 7950 , which encompasses the spectral features h@xmath3 , [ o@xmath76 4960 & 5008 , mg@xmath77 ( b ) , fe@xmath77 , na@xmath77 ( d ) , [ o@xmath76 , h@xmath6 , and the [ n@xmath76 doublet for galaxies near the cluster redshift . the actual wavelength coverage may be shifted by @xmath78   depending on where the slit is located along the width of the slitmask . we observed a total of four slit masks with approximately 120 slits per mask . for each mask we took three 900s exposures . </S>",
    "<S> the data reduction followed the same procedure outlined in detail in@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we obtained 484 spectra with deimos . </S>",
    "<S> of these , we obtained reliable redshifts for 447 objects ( 92% ) , leaving 37 spectra that were either too noisy , had ambiguous redshift solutions ( e.g. , those with a single emission line ) , or failed to reduce properly . </S>",
    "<S> of the 447 reliable redshifts , 221 ( 49% ) are stars , indicating the difficulty of star / galaxy discrimination with low - resolution imaging at low galactic latitude . adopting the quality rating system of@xcite , in which only galaxies with secure redshifts ( @xmath79 ) are considered high - quality , the removal of the stars results in 226 high quality deimos galaxy spectra . </S>",
