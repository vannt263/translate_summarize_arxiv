    ", scaledwidth=50.0% ]    as we intend to study the effects of the hadronic rescattering on fluctuation measures as the cumulants of the different net - charge distributions , we first have to discuss some specific relevant difficulties associated with the current state - of - the - art fluid dynamical models . in the usual framework of fluid dynamical models , as well as of the hybrid models such as the one employed in this study ,",
    "the transition from the fluid dynamical fields to a finite and discrete number of particles is done by a monte - carlo sampling of the cooper - frye equation on a specific hypersurface @xmath10 @xmath11    it is important to note that the single particle distribution functions @xmath12 which enter the cooper - frye formula are usually assumed to be the grand canonical fermi or bose distributions for a hadron resonance gas at a given temperature @xmath13 and chemical potential @xmath14 .",
    "these single - particle distribution functions are generally uncorrelated , as expected for a non - interacting hrg , and , since the particle number in a given local computational cell is much smaller than 1 , the particle number distributions locally follow the poisson distribution .",
    "it is therefore obvious that , using this standard method of particlization , one can not obtain a net - charge distribution which is different from a poisson distribution except for effects stemming from the global conservation of net - charges , as enforced by the particle production scheme employed in the urqmd - hybrid model .",
    "thus , the comparison of the ( normalized ) cumulants before and after the hadronic rescattering phase will not lead to new insights as in this case one starts with a poisson distribution .    in the current paper",
    "we will take a different approach to make qualitative and quantitative statements .",
    "we will set - up a time - dependent correlation function to explore the diffusion of conserved charges during the hadronic phase .",
    "following the standard definition of the correlation coefficient this function reads as @xmath15 where @xmath16 denotes the number of a given charge ( or a net - particle number ) in a given rapidity and momentum window at the time @xmath6 in the event number @xmath17 .",

    "it is evident that if the net - charge in a given bin at a given time @xmath6 is perfectly correlated with the net - charge at the end of the evolution , then the value of this correlation function @xmath21 will be equal to 1 whereas if the net - charge number at given time @xmath6 is completely uncorrelated with the final value , then the @xmath21 will be equal to zero .",
    "correlation of the finally observed net - charge , net - kaon , net - proton and net - baryon number in the rapidity interval @xmath9 , at the cooper - frye hypersurface , with the final net - charge density as a function of beam energy.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    in the standard scenario @xcite , which is employed in most comparisons of the ( normalized ) cumulants with the hrg or lattice qcd results one essentially assumes that this correlation is equal to zero before the chemical freeze - out of hadrons and then instantly jumps to one at the chemical freeze - out , a value which does not change until the cumulants are observed by experiment .",
    "this scenario is shown in figure [ f2 ] by a grey dash dotted line for an exemplary freeze - out time of 10 fm / c .",
    "in such a scenario the final value of the cumulants correspond to that at chemical freeze - out , without any information about the qgp phase before freeze - out or about the hadronic rescattering which follows hadronization .",
    "we start by studying the correlation of different net - charges in central ( @xmath22 fm ) collisions of gold nuclei at beam energy of @xmath7 gev , as measured at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) at the brookhaven national laboratory ( bnl ) .",
    "we will investigate the correlation of the net - electric charge , the net - kaon number , the net - baryon number and the net proton number within our model .",
    "for the net - proton and net - baryon number we also apply a cut in transverse momentum of @xmath23  gev , which corresponds approximately to the relevant experimental acceptance window .",
    "all these quantities , except the net - baryon number which is inaccessible with the current detectors , have been studied in experiments at the rhic .",

    "the system remains essentially out of local equilibrium for a long time and , due to the finite cross sections , will retain more information and therefore show a stronger correlation with the early times .",
    "first we focus on the influence of the size of the rapidity acceptance window .",
    "figure [ f2 ] depicts the correlation of the net - baryon number and net - proton number as a function of time for central au+au reactions at @xmath7 gev .",
    "we present the correlation for times @xmath24 fm / c as the net - proton number can not be defined during the deconfined phase which dominates the dynamics at earlier times .",
    "a dependence on the size of the rapidity window is clearly present .",
    "as expected , a larger acceptance window leads to a stronger correlation of the initial and final net - charge number in a single event .",
    "we also observe a stronger correlation of the net - baryon number with the finally observed number than for the net - proton number , which is also expected , as protons can easily exchange iso - spin and become neutrons during the rescattering phase , e.g. through the excitation and decay of a @xmath25 resonance .",
    "figure [ f1 ] shows the dependence of the correlation @xmath21 , for different net - charge and net - particle numbers , as a function of time . unlike in the standard scenario assuming instant freeze - out ,",
    "the correlation function strongly depends on the duration of the rescattering phase for all considered quantities . at very late times",
    "( @xmath26 fm / c ) the correlation function approaches 1 , which is expected as the system has essentially frozen out and interactions have ceased by that time . however , the correlation changes rapidly in the time interval between particle production ( on the cooper - frye hypersurface ) at around 10 fm / c and decoupling of the system at about 25 fm / c . at the time of interest for most studies , namely the particle production time , the correlation is approximately 0.5 for most net - charges .",
    "only the net - baryon number correlation is slightly stronger , as discussed above .",
    "however , the quantity that is measured experimentally , namely the net - proton number , shows a similar correlation as the net - charge , as significant iso - spin changing reactions take place during the rescattering phase .",
    "the net protons in the case of the full cascade urqmd simulation show a larger initial correlation and an even slower increase of the correlation function compared to the hybrid simulation , hinting to a smaller number of scatterings in the early high density phase and an extended emission period .",
    "this is likely due to the smaller radial flow in the cascade simulation due to the lack of scatterings in the early stage of the collision .",
    "there are two crucial points in time at which we want to study the correlation @xmath21 in more detail .",
    "one is the time at which hadrons are produced according to chemical equilibrium distributions . at this point , at the transition between the hadronic and quark phase , the hadrons are sampled from the transition ( hadronization ) hypersurface according to the cooper - frye equation . the second one is an even earlier time at which the fluid dynamical evolution starts .",
    "the second point is of interest because one can identify possible correlations which survive the fluid dynamical evolution .",
    "this can be , for example , correlations which stem from the initial stopping of the participant nucleons and which may have an influence on the final net - charge distributions .",
    "therefore we show in figure [ f3 ] the correlation @xmath27 which is defined as the correlation between the net - particle number going through the cooper - frye hypersurface and the final state particle number .",
    "this correlation apparently shows only a very weak beam energy dependence down to @xmath28 gev .",
    "this means that the importance of the hadronic rescattering does not change much within the beam energy range of the beam energy scan program at rhic .",
    "the results from the standard cascade urqmd simulations show a similar correlation for all considered beam energies at @xmath29  fm / c .    more important",
    "the beam energy dependence of the correlation @xmath30 , defined as the correlation between the net - particle number at the starting time of the fluid dynamical simulation and the final particle number , shows a clear energy dependence in figure [ f4 ] .",
    "it increases with decreasing beam energy . while at the top rhic energy , essentially no information on baryon stopping survives the fluid dynamical phase , at low energies the conservation of the stopped baryon number throughout the fluid dynamical evolution generates a significant correlation .",
    "probability distribution of the change of the net - proton number in the time interval between @xmath29 fm / c ( red line ) , @xmath31 fm / c ( black line ) and the last scattering .",
    "we show results for @xmath32 gev .",
    "the corresponding correlation values @xmath21 are 0.5 for @xmath29 and 0.99 for @xmath31 fm / c .",
    "we also fitted the distribution for @xmath29 fm / c with a gaussian function and obtained a width @xmath33 which is close to the width of the final net - proton distribution @xmath34 .",
    ", scaledwidth=50.0% ]    as a last step we will demonstrate the effect of the decorrelation of the different net - charge and net - particle numbers on their final number distributions . to do",
    "so we look at the distribution of the change of a particular net - particle number ( i.e. the net - proton number ) for different values of @xmath21 as extracted from our simulations .",
    "the change of the net - proton number @xmath35 is defined as the final net - proton number in a single event minus the net - proton number at a given time @xmath6 in that single event .",
    "if at time @xmath6 the event has already its final net - proton number we find , @xmath36 , and the distribution of @xmath35 would be a delta function with a possible shift along the @xmath35-axis .",
    "the smaller the value of @xmath21 becomes , the broader we expect the distribution of the change to be .",
    "figure [ f5 ] shows this distribution function for two different values of @xmath21 , at times @xmath29 fm / c and @xmath31 fm / c , for central collisions at a beam energy of @xmath32 gev .",
    "we observe that already for a small decorrelation @xmath37 , we obtain a distribution which does not closely resemble a delta function but rather a gaussian with finite width , even though the width is very small compared to the mean net - proton number which is 46 .",
    "however , for a correlation of @xmath38 , the change of the net - proton number has a broad distribution .",
    "we were able to fit this distribution with a gaussian of width @xmath33 , which is only slightly smaller than the width of the final net - proton number distribution which is 7.5 .",
    "note that one may use detailed information on the smearing from model studies such as ours , to try to reconstruct the initial cumulants near hadronization .",
    "we have explored the time dependence of the correlation function of conserved charges in au+au reactions at various beam energies .",
    "we found that the hadronic rescattering phase leads to a substantial decorrelation of the conserved charge distributions .",
    "this effect is present for all investigated conserved charges and is mostly energy independent .",
    "this means that the final distribution function , the only one which can be observed , is to a large extent uncorrelated to that of the newly born hadrons which may carry information on the quark phase of qcd .",
    "hence , a naive comparison of the experimentally measured correlations with the values as calculated by lattice qcd , appropriate for a stationary and infinite model system only , can produce unjustified and misleading conclusions on the phase structure of qcd .",
