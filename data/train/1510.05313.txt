    "we will consider such kind of ensembles , which we will indicate by @xmath70 .",
    "a generic input state @xmath73 in these ensembles has the form @xmath100 where the coefficients @xmath101 and satisfy the normalization condition @xmath102 .",
    "the corresponding density matrix is given by @xmath103 where @xmath104      computing the @xmath63 capacity for the channel @xmath39 is a very hard task since one should perform the following maximization : @xmath105 over all quantum ensembles @xmath70 of the form ( [ eq : generic - input - state2 ] , [ eq : diagonal - density - operator2 ] ) .",

    "it is straightforward to show that the resulting density matrix @xmath12 has the form ( [ eq : diagonal - density - operator2 ] ) where @xmath110 the holevo quantity relative to the ensemble @xmath106 is @xmath111 since by construction all the states in the ensemble ( [ eq : generic - input - stateg1 ] ) have the same output entropy , due to the covariance properties of @xmath39 with respect to @xmath48 ( [ eq : ri - cov ] ) and @xmath59 ( [ eq : s - inv2 ] ) exploited above .",

    "the corresponding density operator is @xmath120 which is of the form ( [ eq : diagonal - density - operator2 ] ) .",

    "the entropy @xmath125 does not depend on @xmath126 .",
    "moreover , the output entropy @xmath127 does not depend on @xmath128 .",
    "therefore the lower bound ( [ eq : max_chi_g1 - 2 ] ) for the classical capacity of the channel @xmath39 can be computed as @xmath129 the reason to investigate this lower bound is that the ensemble @xmath119 contains the ensemble which allows to achieve the @xmath63 classical capacity of the full memory channel @xmath34  @xcite , since @xmath130 coincides with @xmath131 .",
    "the two lower bounds ( [ eq : max_chi_g1 - 2 ] ) and ( [ eq : max_chi_g2 ] ) were computed numerically . in the following subsection",
