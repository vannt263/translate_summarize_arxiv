    "the visible parts of galaxies are , in the current paradigm for galaxy formation , concentrations of baryons at the center of much larger dark matter halos , which have assembled through hierarchical merging and gas cooling .",
    "understanding the properties of these dark matter host halos , their virial masses , concentrations , and radial mass profiles , _ vis - a - vis _ the luminous properties of the main galaxy at their center , is crucial for modeling the dynamics of the central galaxy , for connecting observations of galaxies to large - scale cosmological dark matter simulations , and for understanding what fraction of baryons in the halo ended up as stars in the central galaxy . in turn , the extended stellar distributions of galaxies , in particular the stellar halos of nearby galaxies , offer some of the best probes to test generic predictions about the nature of dark matter mass profiles ( navarro et al . 1996 ) .",
    "the milky way and its surrounding halo are of particular interest , as our internal position permits the placement of unique constraints on the galaxy s stellar mass content , on its dark matter profile at large radii , and on the 3-d shape of its dark matter halo .",
    "yet , our location within the galaxy also complicates some measurements , such as the extended rotation curve of gas in its disk . as a result , the dark mass profile for the milky way between @xmath13 kpc and @xmath14 kpc and the halo s virial mass",
    "have not been previously constrained to better than a factor of 2 to 3 . in practice ,",
    "it has proven useful to quantify the halo mass profile by either a circular velocity curve , @xmath15 , or by the escape velocity curve , @xmath16 .    in previous work , the most common tools used to estimate the milky way halo mass are the escape velocity and the velocity dispersion profile of the tracer populations ( i.e. , halo stars , or the milky way s satellite galaxies and globular clusters ) .",
    "the escape velocity provides constraints on the gravitational potential at the relevant position ( little & tremaine 1987 ; zaritsky et al .",
    "1989 ; kulessa & lynden - bell 1992 ; kochanek 1996 ) .",
    "recent work has shown that the total mass of the halo is around @xmath17 .",
    "wilkinson & evans ( 1999 ) used the velocities of 27 satellite galaxies and globular clusters to find a halo mass of @xmath18 by adopting a truncated , flat rotation curve halo model .",
    "sakamoto , chiba & beers ( 2003 ) used a sample including 11 satellite galaxies , 137 globular clusters , and 413 solar neighborhood field horizontal - branch stars , along with a flat rotation curve model , to obtain a total halo mass of @xmath19 or @xmath20 , depending on the inclusion ( or not ) of leo i. recently , smith et al .",

    "the fundamental first step is to begin with high - quality data ( tracers with accurate distances and radial velocities ) , augmented with an efficient method of analysis capable of extracting the maximum amount of information .",
    "for example , wilkinson & evans ( 1999 ) comment that a data set of @xmath23 radial velocities of bhb stars reduces the uncertainty in the mass estimate of the halo to @xmath24% .",
    "this goal has proven elusive , even with data samples twice this size ( e.g. sakamoto et al . 2003 ) , due to the use of a relatively nearby sample of tracers .",
    "however , we also expect a large and distant data set to constrain the gravitational potential at different positions , which is ultimately a more reliable probe of the dark matter halo .",
    "the planned or already - underway kinematically unbiased surveys , such as the european space agency s astrometric mission gaia ( turon et al . 2005 ) , the space interferometry mission ( sim ; unwin et al .",

    "2003 , beers et al .",

    "blue horizontal - branch ( bhb ) stars are excellent tracers of galactic halo dynamics , because they are luminous and have a nearly constant absolute magnitude within a restricted color range ( see , e.g. , sirko et al .",
    "2004 for bhb stars in sdss ) .",
    "sdss and segue specifically targeted bhb stars for spectroscopy ; we employ these stars ( and other serendipitously discovered bhb stars with available spectra , e.g. , mis - identified qsos ) to derive precision constraints on the mass of the milky way s dark matter halo .    in  2",
    "we describe the assembly of a particularly conservative ( i.e. , low contamination ) selection of bhb stars from the spectra of candidate bhbs in sdss dr-6 .",
    "two different cosmological simulations , one of a galaxy resembling the milky way with a @xmath25 halo , and one of a milky - way - like galaxy simulation with a @xmath26 halo , are presented in  3 .",

    "the sdss is an imaging and spectroscopic survey covering more than a quarter of the sky ( york et al .",

    "the sloan digital sky survey uses a ccd camera ( gunn et al .",

    "this work is based on stellar spectra that are part of the sdss dr-6 ( adelman - mccarthy et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "the radial velocities are taken from the sspp , which ( primarily ) uses matches of the observed spectra to a set of @xmath28 elodie template spectra , corrected to the heliocentric standard - of - rest ( hsr ) frame .",
    "note that the sspp automatically corrects for a systematic offset in sdss stellar radial velocities of 7.3 km s@xmath29 ( see lee et al .",
    "2008a , b for derivation of this offset ) .",
    "after this correction is applied , the sdss radial velocities exhibit negligible systematic errors , and have an accuracy between 5 and 20 km @xmath30 , depending on the s / n of the spectrum and the stellar spectral type .",
    "we aim to select as `` pure '' a set of true bhb stars as possible , where the contamination , e.g. , from halo blue - straggler stars , is minimized , even if this selection procedure results in a smaller sample .",
    "we have not made any effort to construct a complete sample of bhb stars .",
    "therefore , we have not simply followed the dr-6 classification procedures , but have employed a very stringent approach combining previously established color cuts with a set of balmer - line profile selection criteria .",
    "our technique is similar to that of sirko et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , but we use slightly different criteria in the adopted color cuts . throughout this paper",
    "all magnitudes are corrected for galactic extinction , and the colors are corrected for reddening , both based on the procedures of schlegel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) .",
    "we start our selection of bhb stars by adopting the color cuts for identification of bhb candidates used in yanny et al .",
    "( 2000 ) :    @xmath31    @xmath32    these color cuts are shown in figure  [ f : f1 ] ; the rectangle is the region of bhb candidates .",
    "this color cut produces @xmath33 bhb photometric candidates with existing spectra , but with a considerable contamination by both blue straggler ( bs ) stars and warm main - sequence stars ( ms ) . the subsequent spectroscopic analysis for bhb candidates",
    "is aimed at eliminating , or at least greatly reducing , contamination from such stars .      in the ranges of effective temperature",
    "considered herein ( roughly 7000  k to 10,000  k ) , bhb stars have lower surface gravities than bs stars and higher temperatures than ( old , halo population ) ms stars .",
    "the balmer - line profiles of warm stars are sensitive to both gravity and temperature ; their analysis provides a powerful method to select bhb stars with confidence .",
    "we analyze the line profiles after normalizing the continuum for all stars , as illustrated in figure  [ f : f2 ] .",
    "then we combine two independent methods to identify non - bhb stars , as described below .    the @xmath34 method ( pier 1983 ; sommer - larsen , christensen 1986 ; arnold & gilmore 1992 ; flynn , sommer - larsen , & christensen 1994 ; kinman , suntzeff , & kraft 1994 ; wilhelm , beers , & gray 1999 ) discriminates bhb stars from bs stars by determining the value of @xmath35 , the width of the balmer line at 20% below the local continuum , and distinguishes bhb stars from ms stars by measuring the value of @xmath36 , the flux relative to the continuum at the line core ( beers et al .",
    "1992 ; sirko et al .",
    "figure  [ f : f3 ] shows how @xmath37 can distinguish a bhb star from a bs star .",
    "a plot of @xmath37 versus @xmath36 of the @xmath38 line for stars brighter than @xmath39 , and passing the initial color cuts , is shown in figure  [ f : f4 ] .",
    "the concentration of stars centered at @xmath40 ) represents the bhb stars ; the stars with larger @xmath37 are bs stars , and the remaining stars are ms stars .",
    "figure  [ f : f4 ] indicates that the sample contamination resulting from the color - selection only is rather severe , on the order of 50% .",
    "the criteria for confirmation of a bhb star , based on the h@xmath41 line analysis , are :    @xmath42    the _ scale width vs. shape _ method ( clewley et al .",
    "2002 ) is based on a srsic profile ( srsic 1968 ) fit to the balmer lines : @xmath43},\\ ] ]    where @xmath44 is the normalized flux density and @xmath45 is assumed to be the nominal wavelength of the balmer line . to account for small radial velocity corrections and the imperfect normalization of spectra",
    ", we fit the normalized extracted spectrum to the srsic profile with five free parameters : @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "@xmath50}\\ ] ]    the set of stars that passed the initial color cuts exhibits a bimodal distribution in the @xmath51 versus @xmath52 plane ( figure  [ f : f5 ] ) , where @xmath53 refers to the h@xmath54 line .",
    "this gap allows one to quite cleanly separate bhb stars from bs stars , according to :    @xmath55    @xmath56    as the color coding of the points in figure  [ f : f5 ] shows , most bhb stars selected by the @xmath57 & @xmath58 method already lie in the appropriate region of the _ scale width vs. shape _ method applied to @xmath59 .",
    "the combination of these two stringent criteria indeed appears to eliminate most stars that are not _ bona - fide _ bhb stars .",
    "the combination of figure  [ f : f4 ] and figure  [ f : f5 ] suggests that the contamination is well below 10% .",
    "note that the two spectroscopic criteria are determined based on the spectra of bright stars ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "because of the high quality spectra available for such stars , the criteria can be identified easily by eye from figure  [ f : f4 ] and figure  [ f : f5 ] . for fainter stars ( @xmath61 )",
    "we adopt the same spectroscopic criteria as for the bright stars .",
    "there are a total of @xmath62 stars that survive the color cuts , and _ both _ of the balmer - line profile cuts described above",
    ". this sample forms the basis of our remaining analysis .",
    "our basic approach is to identify bhb stars from their spectra (  2.1 ) , then estimate their absolute magnitude from photometry alone .",
    "bhb stars have similar , but not identical , absolute magnitudes , as they are affected slightly by temperature and metallicity ( e.g. , wilhelm , beers , & gray 1999 ; sirko et al .",
    "figure  [ f : f6 ] shows five theoretical absolute magnitudes @xmath63 in the @xmath64 plane , taken from sirko et al .",
    "( 2004 ) . for each bhb star in our sample",
    "we define the most probable absolute magnitude associated with its @xmath64 colors by simply finding the absolute magnitude of the point on the theoretical track that is closest to the observed star in this color - color space . ) , and use it instead of picking the `` closest '' model . however , the difference between the two methods is less than the theoretical uncertainties in the derived luminosities . ]",
    "the absolute magnitude error of a given star derived from this method is on the order of 0.2 mag ( sirko et al .",
    "2004 ) , corresponding to a distance accuracy of 10% ; errors in the measured photometry are much smaller than this error .",
    "the distance from the sun , and from the galactic center can then be determined from :    @xmath65    @xmath66    where @xmath67 is the extinction - corrected magnitude in the @xmath67 band , @xmath68 is the absolute magnitude in the @xmath67 band , @xmath69 is the distance to the sun , @xmath70 is the distance from the galactic center , @xmath71 and @xmath72 are the galactic latitude and longitude respectively ; we take @xmath73 , the distance of the sun from the galactic center , to be @xmath74  kpc .      for ease of the subsequent analysis",
    ", we convert the heliocentric radial velocities to the galactic standard of rest ( gsr ) frame by adopting a value of @xmath75 km s@xmath29 for the local standard of rest ( v@xmath76 ) and a solar motion of @xmath77 km s@xmath29 in ( u , v , w ) , which are defined in a right - handed galactic system with u pointing towards the galactic center , v in the direction of rotation , and w towards the north galactic pole ( dehnen & binney 1998 ) .",
    "hereafter , @xmath78 stands for the radial velocity in the gsr frame ( i.e. , the radial velocity component along the star - sun direction , corrected for galactic rotation ) .",
    "if @xmath79 is the heliocentric radial velocity , then :    @xmath80    our sample of @xmath62 bhb stars may contain some thick - disk stars , with @xmath81 , so we impose an additional geometric constraint @xmath82 , which reduces the sample to @xmath0 ( presumed ) _ halo _ bhb stars within 60 kpc , and with radial velocity error less than 30 km @xmath30 .",
    "the spatial distribution of our @xmath0 halo bhb stars is shown in figure  [ f : f7 ] and figure  [ f : f8 ] , with all stars located at least @xmath83  kpc from the galactic disk and at @xmath84  kpc from the galactic center .",
    "figure  [ f : f9 ] ( upper panel ) shows the derived [ fe / h ] estimates for the bhb sample reported by the sspp ( see lee et al . 2008a , b for details ) .",
    "most of our bhb stars are metal - poor ( [ fe / h ] @xmath852 ) , as expected for a sample of halo stars .",
    "this is further testament to the quality of the sdss spectra and the rigor of the sample selection .",
    "the observed distribution of line - of - sight velocities is well - fitted by a gaussian distribution with @xmath86 , as shown in the lower panel of figure  [ f : f9 ] .",
    "the upper panel of figure  [ f : f10 ] shows the distribution of @xmath78 vs. @xmath87 for the _ halo _ bhb stars .",
    "it reveals a nearly equal number of stars with positive and negative @xmath78 at a given radius : the bhb population exhibits very little net rotation , so we will subsequently analyze only @xmath88 .",
    "the lower panel of figure  [ f : f10 ] shows the binned velocity dispersion , @xmath89 , of the sample as a function of radius .",
    "it is well described by @xmath90    where r is the galactocentric radius .",
    "we will use eqn 6 subsequently for jeans equation modeling .",
    "a _ maximum likelihood _ fit to estimate @xmath91 and @xmath92 yields @xmath93 , which is consist with eqn 6 within 1-@xmath94 .",
    "this indicates that the choice of the bins has small effect on the inferred @xmath95 .",
    "we also checked that these values of @xmath96 are insensitive to small changes in the assumed @xmath97 .",
    "the radial number density profile of halo stars in the milky way in the range @xmath98 kpc can be approximated by @xmath99 ( e.g. , bell et al 2007 ) .",
    "accounting for the @xmath100 volume effect , inspection of figure  [ f : f10 ] and figure  [ f : f12 ] reveals that the radial distribution of our bhb sample falls off much more rapidly than this , in particular at large distances .",
    "this is mostly attributable to the sdss spectroscopic target selection .",
    "the chances of a candidate bhb star to be targeted for spectroscopy in the course of sdss and segue is not a simple function of its apparent magnitude , but depends on many ( often operational ) factors , which have also evolved over the course of the survey .",
    "the net result is that only under very favorable circumstances are distant ( hence faint ) bhbs targeted , and have spectra obtained that are of sufficient s / n to pass our quality criteria . as a result , the radial distribution of our sample falls off much more steeply than the parent population of halo bhb stars",
    ". we account for these effects in the subsequent analysis , as described below .",
    "overall , our present sample of distant halo stars with available kinematics is nearly an order of magnitude larger than that of battaglia et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , which has 240 stars . because our tracers are bhb stars , their distances are also known more accurately .",
    "however , the battaglia et al .",
    "sample does extend to larger radii , up to @xmath101  kpc .",
    "we now describe our approach to convert the @xmath102 measurements ( as a function of galactocentric radius , r ) for the @xmath103 bhb stars into estimates of @xmath5 of the milky way halo , and ultimately to estimate @xmath104 for the milky way s halo . with the full line - of - sight velocity data set , sampling radii of @xmath105 kpc , we can obtain both the velocity dispersion , @xmath106 , and identify a set of exceptionally high - velocity stars at various radii that might be suitable to estimate @xmath16 .",
    "some previous work ( e.g. , battaglia et al 2005 ) considered only velocity dispersions , while others focused only on high - velocity stars in the solar neighborhood ( sakamoto et al .",
    "2003 ; smith et al .",
    "we consider the full velocity distribution ; as we shall see later , it is close to a gaussian and hence most of the pertinent information is contained in @xmath107 .    to link the observables , @xmath78 and @xmath87 , to @xmath15 , we must not only account for the particular survey volume , but also need to make at least an implicit assumption about the nature of the halo - star distribution function , in particular its ( an-)isotropy .",
    "in contrast to , e.g. , battaglia et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , we restrict ourselves not only to jeans equation modeling , but choose to account for these issues also by investigation of a comparison with cosmologically motivated galaxy simulations , to make `` mock observations '' within these simulations , and then match test results to the observations .",
    "one can not expect the halo stars in the simulations to have exactly the sample density profile as the actual stars in the halo of the milky way ; we account for such differences as described below .",
    "based on prior estimates of the halo mass , we chose two sph simulations corresponding to the formation of milky way - like haloes , from which `` pseudo - observations '' are constructed for comparison with the data .",
    "both halos were picked from low - resolution cosmological dark matter simulations and were re - simulated at higher resolution , including the effects of gas dynamics , and star formation and stellar feedback .",
    "simulation i was run using the smoothed particle hydrodynamics code grapesph ( steinmetz 1996 ) , and included a moderately efficient stellar feedback model in which the supernova energy was added to the thermal energy of the gas , as described in abadi et al .",

    "we have the @xmath112-d positions and @xmath112-d velocities , the circular velocity , @xmath113 , and the escape velocity , @xmath114 , to the virial radius of the simulation at each given position . because sdss / segue only observed @xmath115 @xmath116 steradians , not the entire sky ( see figure  [ f : f11 ] ) , in order to compare the observations to the simulations we must select simulated star particles in the same region as the sdss footprint .    as a first step",
    ", we specified `` galactic coordinates '' in the simulation by defining the `` galactic plane '' by the net angular momentum of all ( stellar ) particles within 10  kpc of the center . in this coordinate system one",
    "has ( by definition ) @xmath117 kpc ( @xmath118 kpc ) .",
    "we can then calculate the galactocentric radial velocity as seen from the `` sun '' for each simulation particle as :    @xmath119    since the simulated `` observer '' is at rest in the galactocentric coordinate system , no assumptions about the lsr need be made in the simulations .    to create `` pseudo - observations '' , we first remove the satellites in the simulation and then assume 10 positions for the sun that all have @xmath120 and @xmath121 , but different azimuthal angles , @xmath122 .",
    "the corresponding @xmath123 and @xmath124 in this coordinate system can then be used to select the star particles in the same region of the simulation as our observed bhb sample .",
    "the effective flux limit of the bhb sample , @xmath125 , implies a maximum distance from the sun of about @xmath126  kpc , a distance which we impose as a selection limit in the simulations . to select `` halo '' stars",
    ", we also impose that the stars have to be at least @xmath83  kpc above or below the disk plane . finally , we average these 10 samples of simulated halo stars .",
    "figure  [ f : f11 ] shows the distribution of these selected simulated stars and the observed halo bhb stars in @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",

    "we first estimate @xmath5 from the data / simulation comparison in a set of statistically independent radial bins , effectively constructing a circular velocity curve extending to 60 kpc .",
    "we then fit the circular velocity curve with nfw halo ( and bulge+disk ) models , resulting in estimates of m@xmath11 .",
    "it should be noted that the milky way halo s presumed virial radius extends about a factor of four beyond the most distant bhb stars in our observed sample of tracers .",

    "overall , the velocity distributions agree well with one another .    to estimate the statistical uncertainties on these values , we use bootstrap resampling on our bhb sample ( typically 100 times ) , repeat the above procedure , and indicate the resulting 68% ( 1-@xmath94 ) confidence region as error bars .",
    "in a given gravitational potential , more centrally concentrated kinematic tracer populations will exhibit smaller velocity dispersions than more extended ones . in the simple case of a spherical potential , with tracers of @xmath144 and an isotropic velocity dispersion that varies only slowly with radius , the jeans equation , for a given @xmath5 , yields the relative velocity dispersions of the two populations , @xmath145 , where the indices refer to two different hypothetical tracer populations .    in the radial range of 10 - 60  kpc ,",
    "the density profile of halo stars in simulation ii is approximately @xmath146 , while that of simulation i is @xmath147 .",
    "this , however , should not be compared to the radial distribution of the stars for which we actually have velocities , but to the radial profile of halo stars from which they were drawn ( see  2.3 ) .",
    "this requires the reasonable assumption that the measured velocities are uncorrelated with the spectral targeting ",
    "even a more complete sampling of bhb stars at a given radius would have yielded the same velocity distribution . as an estimate for the actual density profile for the milky way s stellar halo at 10 - 60 kpc , we take the estimates ( for main sequence turn - off stars ) of @xmath148 ( bell et al .",

    "figure  [ f : f16 ] and figure  [ f : f17 ] present the main result of our analysis , @xmath5 , an estimate of the circular velocity curve from @xmath98  kpc .",
    "this represents the first time that the circular curve for the galaxy has been estimated to such large distances at this accuracy .",

    ", the circular velocity curve appears to be gently falling to 175 @xmath172 at @xmath2  kpc .",
    "note also that the circular velocity curve is a conceptually more robust estimate than @xmath114 , which depends more sensitively than v@xmath173 on @xmath174 at radii beyond the measurements .    using the functional form for @xmath5 expected for an nfw halo and the stellar component ( see below ) as a means to interpolate the individual circular velocity curve estimates , one obtains @xmath175 km @xmath30 , or m@xmath176m@xmath9 .",
    "this is the largest radius for which the data directly constrain @xmath177 or @xmath178 . yet",
    "this radius is only one - fourth of the expected virial radius of the milky way s halo .",
    "we therefore proceed with a separate step , to use these @xmath5 estimates to constrain parameterized models for the overall dark matter halo .",
    "we assume that the galactic potential is represented by three components , a spherical hernquist ( 1990 ) bulge , an exponential disk for the stellar components , and describe the halo by an nfw profile ( navarro et al .",
    "the total potential can then be simply expressed as    @xmath179    with an assumed potential , presumed to be spherically symmetric , for the disk and bulge of @xmath180 @xmath181 where @xmath182 , @xmath183 kpc , @xmath184 , and @xmath185 kpc ( similar to smith et al .",

    "i @xmath216 with @xmath217 kpc and @xmath218 .    the virial mass calculated by the circular velocity estimates based on simulation ii is @xmath219 with @xmath220 kpc and @xmath221 .",
    "the error bars on @xmath104 and @xmath215 are determined for 1-@xmath94 confidence intervals in a chi - square test , fixing the best - fit value of c , while the error bars on c are determined for 1-@xmath94 confidence intervals in a chi - square test , fixing the best - fit value of @xmath104 .",
    "note that although contracted and uncontracted halo fits differ quite strongly in their ( initial ) concentration , reassuringly the m@xmath222 estimates remain relatively unaffected .",
    "the lower concentrations for the contracted halo fits are still reasonally consistent with the concentration scatter expected from cosmological simulations ( e.g. , nfw 96 ) .",
    "the results here show that the milky way s circular velocity curve must be gently falling to distances of 60 kpc from its value of @xmath223 km / s at the solar radius ; the null hypothesis @xmath224 has a constant value of @xmath225 is rejected by our fits with very high statistical significance ( at a level of 0.01 ) .    a direct comparison with earlier work , at the data or @xmath166 level , is not straightforward to carry out , as each sample has distinct selection effects , such as differing radial distributions .",
    "our estimate of @xmath104 , taken to be the average of the four estimates derived in this section , @xmath226m@xmath9 , falls well within the ( considerably larger ) range of values estimated by battaglia et al .",
    "( 2005 , 2006 ) : @xmath227 .",
    "this value is also reasonably consistent with the recent estimate by li & white ( 2008 ) , based on local group dynamics . in general , however , the new mass estimate presented here lies at the lower limit of most previous estimates .",
    "the method to estimate @xmath5 can also be used to derive the escape velocity curve @xmath228 .",
    "we have carried out an analogous procedure to that described in  3.2 , using @xmath229 , and found lower limits on m@xmath230 , which do not appear to be as stringent as the @xmath5 estimates .",
    "we have constrained the mass distribution of the milky way s dark matter halo , by analyzing the kinematics of nearly @xmath231 bhb stars drawn from sdss dr-6 , which reach to galactocentric distances of @xmath232 kpc . to obtain a `` clean sample '' of bhb stars",
    ", we have re - analyzed all candidate bhb spectra , following the prescription by sirko et al .",
    "2004 , which should result in a contamination fraction ( mostly by bs stars ) of well below 10% .",
    "the metallicity distribution , centered on [ fe / h ] @xmath233  dex , confirms that most sample members must be halo stars .",
    "the distances to the bhb stars are known to @xmath234 .    to account for the complex survey geometry and for plausible orbital distributions of our sample of bhb stars ,",
    "we have compared the observed radial velocities to analogous quantities drawn from the `` star particles '' in galaxy formation simulations that resemble the milky way . in particular , we have placed a virtual `` observer '' at 8.0 kpc from the simulation centers , looking in the actual sdss directions and sampling radial velocities for stars that are more than 4 kpc above and below the disk plane .",
    "we then explored to what mass scale , or @xmath5 , the simulations need to be scaled to in order to match the observed line - of - sight velocity distribution in a set of radial bins . in this analysis",
    ", we adjusted this scaling using the jeans equation , to account for the slight difference in the radial profile of observed halo stars ( @xmath235 ) and simulated halo stars ( @xmath236 ) over this radial range .",
    "this procedure results in direct estimates of @xmath5 from @xmath13 kpc to @xmath2 kpc , the best such estimates to date over this range .",
    "the circular velocity estimate varies slightly with radius , dropping from @xmath237 at 10  kpc to @xmath238 in the most distant two bins . applying this procedure to two independent cosmological simulations ( simulation i and simulation ii , respectively ) results in consistent estimates of @xmath5 .",
    "the mass enclosed within 60  kpc , constrained quite directly by the data , is found to be @xmath239m@xmath9 . as a result of the much more extensive data set provided by sdss , the uncertainties on this estimate are substantially lower than those obtained by previous comparable work . a simple , jeans- equation based modeling approach , assuming ( an-)isotropies of either @xmath240 ( as found for the halo stars in the cosmological simulations ) yields results that are consistent with these values .",
    "although each of the @xmath5 points were estimated independently , the implied overall profile is consistent with both the mass profile in the simulations and with a parameterized mass model that combines a fixed disk and bulge model with an nfw dark matter halo , whose concentration c corresponds to the expected mean value for its virial mass .",
    "we have also explored halo fits with the concentration c as a free parameter , as well as halo profiles that have been modified by adiabatic contraction .",
    "we find that our data can not discriminate well whether adiabatic contraction occurs or not  an uncontracted halo of higher than average concentration and a contracted halo of ( initially ) low concentration fit comparably well .",
    "the resulting virial masses , @xmath241m@xmath9 , are consistent for both fitting approaches .",
    "we have also checked that these results are quite robust with respect to distance errors , modest sample contamination ( @xmath242 ) , and the choice of a different , independent galaxy formation simulation .",
    "the estimate of @xmath104 , which does imply an extrapolation from r@xmath243 kpc to the virial radius of @xmath244 kpc , is consistent with a recent estimate from a much smaller sample of halo stars ( battaglia et al .",
    "2006 ) , but it is lower than previous estimates that also rely on the kinematics of satellite galaxies ( e.g. , kochanek et al .",
    "however , recent results on the lmc ( kallivayalil et al .",
    "2006 ; besla et al .",
    "2007 ) indicate that not even the magellanic clouds may have been bound to the milky way for long , posing a potential conceptual problems for the use of satellite dynamics .",
    "it should be interesting to explore how our new constraint modifies the local group timing argument and its implication for m31 s halo mass ( li & white 2008 ) .",
    "the estimate of @xmath245m@xmath9 , together with an estimated total cold baryonic mass of @xmath246m@xmath9 and a global baryon mass fraction of @xmath247 , implies that nearly 40% of all baryons within the virial radius have cooled to form the milky way s stars and ( cold ) gas , consistent with recent estimates for galaxies of that mass scale , based on statistical arguments ( van den bosh et al . 2007 ; gnedin et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "we note that parts of our analysis have been performed under the assumption that the stellar halo of the galaxy is considered as a single relaxed population , or one that matches the simulations .",
    "our data on the overall dynamics are consistent with that hypothesis .",
    "recent evidence from carollo et al .",
    "( 2007 ) and miceli et al .",
    "( 2007 ) suggest that the halo may well be more complex , and comprise two distinct populations of inner- and outer - halo stars , with ( slightly ) different net rotational velocities and spatial profiles .",

    "<S> this sample enables construction of the full line - of - sight velocity distribution at different galactocentric radii . to interpret these distributions , we compare them to matched mock observations drawn from two different cosmological galaxy formation simulations designed to resemble the milky way , which we presume to have an appropriate orbital distribution of halo stars . specifically , we select simulated halo stars in the same volume as the observations , and derive the distributions @xmath4 of their line - of - sight velocities for different radii , normalized by the simulation s local circular velocity . </S>",
    "<S> we then determine which value of @xmath5 brings the observed distribution into agreement with the corresponding distributions from the simulations . </S>",
    "<S> these values are then adopted as observational estimates for @xmath5 , after a small jeans equation correction is made to account for slight data / simulation differences in the radial density distribution . </S>",
    "<S> this procedure results in an estimate of the milky way s circular velocity curve to @xmath6  kpc , which is found to be slightly falling from the adopted value of @xmath7 at the sun s location , and implies m@xmath8m@xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> the radial dependence of @xmath5 , derived in statistically independent bins , is found to be consistent with the expectations from an nfw dark matter halo with the established stellar mass components at its center . </S>",
    "<S> if we assume an nfw halo profile of characteristic concentration holds , we can use the observations to estimate the virial mass of the milky way s dark matter halo , m@xmath10m@xmath9 , which is lower than many previous estimates . </S>",
    "<S> we have checked that the particulars of the cosmological simulations are unlikely to introduce systematics larger than the statistical uncertainties . </S>",
    "<S> this estimate implies that nearly 40% of the baryons within the virial radius of the milky way s dark matter halo reside in the stellar components of our galaxy . a value for m@xmath11 of only @xmath12m@xmath9 also ( re-)opens the question of whether all of the milky way s satellite galaxies are on bound orbits . </S>"
