    "millimeter , sub - millimeter , and centimeter wavelength observations of star - forming sources known as `` hot cores '' reveal a range of complex organic molecules , through the identification of molecular rotational emission spectra ( herbst & van dishoeck 2009 ) .",
    "many of the molecules detected toward hot cores are highly saturated ( i.e. hydrogen - rich ) , and a significant number also contain oxygen and/or nitrogen ; examples include methanol ( ch@xmath4oh ) , formic acid ( hcooh ) , and the ubiquitous methyl formate ( hcooch@xmath4 ) , as well as the recently detected aminoacetonitrile ( nh@xmath0ch@xmath0cn , belloche et al .",
    "2008 ) , which bears both amine and nitrile groups .",
    "the breadth of functional groups borne by molecules detected toward hot cores ( as well as the large number of unidentified emission lines ) suggests that other , as - yet undetected species may also be present , including biologically - significant molecules such as amino acids  the building blocks of proteins .",
    "the search for the simplest amino acid , glycine ( nh@xmath0ch@xmath0cooh ) , toward interstellar sources has not so far yielded a detection ( snyder et al .",
    "2005 ) ; recent upper limits toward sgr b2(n ) , a spectrally- and chemically - rich hot - core source in the galactic center , are around 10@xmath5  10@xmath6 @xmath7 for beam - averaged values obtained with the mopra telescope ( cunningham et al .",
    "2007 ) and the atca array ( jones et al .",
    "2007 ) for glycine conformer i. upper limits on the higher - energy conformer ii from the same studies are around 10@xmath8  10@xmath5 @xmath7 .",
    "however , numerous amino acids have been found in meteorites , and glycine was recently detected in a sample taken from comet wild 2 ( elsila et al .",
    "2009 ) ; it has indeed been postulated that terrestrial amino acids may have an interstellar origin ( e.g. ehrenfreund & charnley 2000 ) .",
    "it is likely that amino acids and other biologically - relevant species will , in the coming years , provide plausible targets for searches with the alma telescope , which can provide much greater sensitivity and spatial resolution than was previously available .",
    "it is therefore valuable to extend existing astrochemical models to simulate the putative formation of glycine and related species in hot cores , both to make quantitiative predictions and to assess the viability of observational candidate sources .",
    "current models of hot - core chemistry place great emphasis on the formation of organic molecules within or upon dust - grain ice mantles , as well as in the gas phase .",
    "garrod & herbst ( 2006 , hereafter g&h ) showed that typically - observed molecules such as methyl formate , while difficult to form by gas - phase mechanisms , could be produced in appropriate abundances through grain - surface chemistry at intermediate temperatures , prior to the complete sublimation of the dust - grain ices .",
    "the radicals hco and ch@xmath4 were found to become mobile around 20  40 k , reacting with other radicals associated with formaldehyde and methanol destruction , to produce formic acid , dimethyl ether and methyl formate .",
    "cosmic ray - induced photolysis of the molecular ice mantles was found to be the dominant source of these functional - group radicals .",
    "garrod , widicus weaver & herbst ( 2008 , hereafter gwh ) extended the network to include a much larger number of surface radical species , allowing the study of more complex molecules ; methanol was found to be the key molecule for the supply of the constituent functional groups of many such species .",
    "recent experimental work by berg et al .",
    "( 2009a ) has provided direct evidence that a range of complex organic molecules detected in star - forming regions may be readily produced within uv - irradiated organic ices .",

    "their findings indicated that woon s mechanism was consistent with the origins of the nitrogen and central carbon in the glycine molecule , while the origin of the acidic carbon was more consistent with the formation of glycine occurring via a nitrile precursor , i.e. amino acetonitrile ( nh@xmath0ch@xmath0cn ) .",
    "however , a strecker - type formation route was found to be of only minor importance .    in order to investigate the formation of glycine within dust - grain ices under astrophysical conditions , the extension of the chemical networks of g&h and gwh  as well as that of belloche et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , who treated the formation of amino acetonitrile , @xmath9-propyl cyanide , and ethyl formate  is continued with the addition of glycine , its amino aldehyde glycinal , and a collection of related species such as propionic acid and propanal .",
    "the new formation mechanisms for these species follow the general treatments of previous networks , which allowed radicals on the grains , frequently produced by uv photodissociation or chemical abstraction processes , to meet via thermal diffusion and thus form more complex structures .",
    "the mechanism suggested by woon ( 2002 ) is included in the new network , as well as several other likely radical - addition mechanisms .",
    "furthermore , a gas - phase mechanism for glycine production is tested , by the inclusion of reactions between protonated hydroxylamine ( nh@xmath4oh@xmath10 ) and acetic acid ( ch@xmath4cooh ) , followed by dissociative electronic recombination , as suggested by blagojevic et al .",
    "all new species in the network are afforded both formation and destruction mechanisms on the grains and in the gas - phase .",
    "a more comprehensive hydrogen - abstraction reaction set is also included in the network .    to apply this chemical network to hot - core conditions , a new three - phase astrochemical model , _ magickal _ , is used , which includes a fully - active chemistry within the bulk of the ice mantle ( see section 2.1 ) .",
    "the physico - chemical evolution of the core is traced starting from the free - fall collapse of a cloud , using the dust - temperature / visual - extinction relationship given by g&p , through the subsequent warm - up of the dense core from 8  400 k.    in order to simulate the emission from glycine and a selection of other molecules , the results of these models are mapped to existing observationally - determined temperature and density profiles for specific sources .",
    "the equation of radiative transfer is then solved numerically , under the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium , along both on- and off - source lines of sight , allowing a determination of line strengths and emission radii .",
    "this emission is then convolved with telescope beams appropriate to current instruments , allowing the detectability of glycine to be assessed .",
    "the nearby hot - core source ngc 6334 irs1 is specifically considered , due both to the availability of physical profiles and molecular observations in the literature , and to its spectroscopic suitability .",
    "comparison is also made with the recent non - detection of hydroxylamine ( nh@xmath0oh ) in another source ( pulliam et al .",
    "2012 ) , with implications for the putative formation of glycine in the gas phase .",
    "section 2 describes the new chemical and physical models ; the results are presented in section 3 .",
    "the results of the inclusion of gas - phase formation mechanisms for glycine are described in section 4 .",
    "the spectroscopic model and results for various molecules are presented in section 5 .",
    "a broad discussion of the results is presented in section 6 ; a list of general conclusions is provided in section 7 .",
    "to model the hot - core chemistry , a new astrochemical code is employed , named _ magickal _",
    "( model for astrophysical gas and ice chemical kinetics and layering ) .",
    "this code uses a rate - equation / modified rate - equation approach to solve the coupled gas - phase , dust grain - surface and ice - mantle chemistry .",
    "the essential functionality of previous approaches ( garrod & pauly , 2011 ) is retained , while a number of additional features are added , as outlined below .      the three - phase model used here is described in detail by garrod & pauly ( 2011 ) , and is based on the approach of hasegawa & herbst ( 1993 ) .",
    "in contrast to both of those methods , _ magickal _ simulates an active ice - mantle chemistry in addition to that occurring in the surface layer of the ice or on the dust - grain surface .",
    "previous _ two - phase _ hot - core models , such as those of g&h , gwh , and belloche et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , have implicitly assumed a combined surface / mantle chemistry , using surface kinetics to simulate all dust - grain chemical processes , including those within the bulk ice .",
    "although satisfactory results may be obtained through this simplification , it has become clear through experimental means ( e.g. berg et al . , 2009a ) that the promotion of complex - molecule formation within organic ices by uv photolysis involves sub - surface processes , even in relatively thin ices ( on the order of 10 monolayers ) .",
    "in order to simulate chemical kinetics within the ice mantles , it is here assumed that the mobility of chemical reactants in the bulk ice occurs through a barrier - mediated thermal diffusion process .",
    "other authors have assumed a swapping mechanism to be active in laboratory ice experiments ( berg et al . 2009 ; fayolle et al . 2011 ) , which is also implicitly assumed in this model .",
    "the swapping rate is parameterized in the same way as the surface thermal hopping , i.e.    @xmath11\\ ] ]    where @xmath12 is the characteristic vibrational frequency of an harmonic oscillator , @xmath13 is the dust temperature , and @xmath14 is an energy barrier associated with the swapping of species @xmath15 with an adjacent water molecule , in line with the adoption of surface binding energies appropriate to amorphous water ice , following g&h and gwh .",
    "ratios between the surface diffusion barrier and the desorption energy of any particular species bound to an ice or any other surface are poorly constrained , and various authors have used values in the approximate range of 0.3  0.8 .",
    "garrod & pauly ( 2011 ) found that the production of interstellar co@xmath0 ice could be well reproduced by the adoption of ratios @xmath16:@xmath17 ; here a value of 0.35 is used .",
    "thence , a value of @xmath14:@xmath18 is assumed for the swapping barrier , on the simplistic consideration that a bulk - ice molecule is bound to approximately twice the number of binding partners as a surface molecule . in analogy to the surface chemical reaction rates , the rate of reaction between mantle - species a and b is given by :    @xmath19 / n_{\\mathrm{m}}\\ ] ]    where @xmath20 is the population of species @xmath15 in the ice mantle , and @xmath21 is the total population of the ice mantle , including all species .",
    "as discussed by garrod & pauly ( 2011 ) , in the three - phase model , material in the surface layer is transferred to the bulk ice according to the net rate of deposition of material onto the grain from the gas phase , with a similar , alternative transfer occurring in reverse in the case of a net _ desorption _ of mantle species into the gas phase .",
    "these transfers represent the covering or exposure of ice material as the boundary of the ice - surface layer is constantly re - defined within the model , rather than the physical transport of material .",
    "however , the inclusion of bulk diffusion within the ice should allow a true exchange of chemical species between surface and mantle , through the aforementioned swapping mechanism .",
    "this surface ",
    "mantle swapping is a pair - wise process , and therefore requires the construction of rates for each chemical species in the mantle and in the surface layer , which must collectively produce no net transfer between the two phases .",
    "this zero net rate would be assured using an explicit pair - wise coupling of every species in the surface with every species in the grain mantle ; however , such an approach is found to be computationally exhaustive , and requires estimates of the pair - wise positions of the swapped species that a rate - based model can not provide , other than through purely statistical considerations .    instead ,",
    "the swapping rates from mantle to surface are calculated first , with rates analogous to that of equation ( 2 ) . the total rate in this direction is then matched with an identical total transfer rate from surface to mantle , apportioned to all the surface species according to their fractional contribution to the total surface - layer population .",
    "thus :    @xmath22    @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the rate of mantle - to - surface swapping of mantle species @xmath15 , @xmath25 is the rate of surface - to - mantle swapping of surface species @xmath15 , @xmath20 and @xmath26 are the mantle and surface populations , respectively , of species @xmath15 , and @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the total mantle and surface populations . the ratio @xmath29 in equation ( 3 ) is taken as unity when it exceeds this value , representing the case where some surface species reside on the dust - grain surface itself and have no underlying mantle .",
    "because the model does not assign specific positions to each atom or molecule in the mantle , the rate of mantle - to - surface swapping , @xmath24 , is required to be representative not simply of the final diffusion step , but of the entire chain of diffusion steps by which a mantle species at arbitrary distance from the surface layer will reach the surface .",
    "the use of @xmath30 in eq .",
    "( 3 ) as the rate of a typical , or average , step in this process is accurate so long as the final diffusion step from mantle to surface is relatively fast , i.e. that intra - mantle diffusion is the rate - limiting step in the entire journey from mantle to surface . under the assumption that the ice is predominantly water ice ( see above )",
    ", the final surface - to - mantle step will be fast for species whose binding energies are less than or similar to that of water .",
    "for the small minority of species with significantly greater binding energies than this , for which there would thus be an associated endothermicity to the mantle  surface swap with a water molecule ( see e.g. berg et al .",
    "2009b ) , the large absolute size of the swapping barrier would render the rate of mantle - to - surface diffusion negligible compared to other processes , such as the mantle - to - surface transfer associated with net surface desorption .",
    "these rates defined in eqs .",
    "( 3 ) and ( 4 ) are also considered in the loss and gain rates used for the modified - rate calculations of garrod ( 2008 ) , which are applied in this model ( using `` method c '' ) .",
    "garrod et al .",
    "( 2009 ) showed that this method produces a very close approximation to the results of exact monte carlo methods , using a large chemical network under a range of physical conditions .",
    "+      the chemical network used in this model is based on that of gwh and the subsequent additions of belloche et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , which featured a treatment for nitriles , including amino acetonitrile ( nh@xmath0ch@xmath0cn ) .",
    "these networks assumed grain - surface radical  radical formation mechanisms for newly - added complex organic molecules , as well as destruction mechanisms such as grain - surface and gas - phase photodissociation ( by both the ambient and cosmic ray - induced uv fields ) , gas - phase ion - molecule reactions ( including protonation ) and the related electronic recombinations of the products , as well as accretion from the gas - phase onto the grain surfaces , and thermal and non - thermal desorption from the grains .",
    "the initial elemental abundances used are shown in table [ tab - init ] .",
    "@xcite constructed a network of reactions to treat the formation of _",
    "trans_-methyl formate , the higher energy conformer of the commonly observed _",
    "cis_-methyl formate ; however , that study found no significant effect on the abundances of species other than _ trans_-mf , so the omission of the related chemistry is not expected to have any effect on the models presented here .",
    "following the same methodology , formation and destruction processes are included for glycine and a suite of related molecules , including glycinal , propanal and propionic acid .",
    "radical reactions for a selection of these species are shown in table [ tab - surf ] .",
    "whereas in the previous models , a single complex molecule was typically assumed to be the only possible product of the addition of key grain - surface radicals , here alternative product branches are included , for the case where such a reaction could also result in a pair of stable products , and where the reaction is also exothermic .",
    "thus , for the reaction hco + ch@xmath4o @xmath31 hcooch@xmath4 , which was found by gwh to be the predominant formation route for methyl formate , alternative product branches of [ co + ch@xmath4oh ] and [ h@xmath0co + h@xmath0co ] are now also included .",
    "the branching ratios are in general poorly defined , and are likely to be significantly different between the gas- and solid - phase processes ; statistical ratios are therefore adopted ( e.g. 1:1:1 for hco + ch@xmath4o ) .",
    "in addition , the same such two - product reactions are now also included in the gas - phase chemistry , using measured rates  where available ; otherwise , a uniform second - order rate coefficient of @xmath32 @xmath33 s@xmath34 is assumed .",
    "such processes may become important in the late , high - temperature stage of hot - core evolution , during which the evaporation , protonation and subsequent electronic recombination may lead to significant quantities of molecular radicals being present in the gas phase .",
    "however , the single - product branches are omitted from the gas - phase chemistry , because of their negligible rates , due to the absence of a grain surface to carry away excess energy and thereby stabilize the product .",
    "following previous models , grain - surface hydrogen - abstraction reactions are added for reactions between the new complex species and the most significant grain - surface radicals such as h , oh , ch@xmath4 , ch@xmath0oh , ch@xmath4o and nh@xmath0 . table [ tab - act ] shows activation - energy barrier information used in the model , for a selection of ( primarily hydrogen - abstraction ) reactions occurring on the grains . for atomic - hydrogen reactions relating to methanol formation , for which more complex fits to theoretical rates are employed ,",
    "the simpler rectangular - barrier parameter fits are quoted , as for all other barrier - mediated reactions .",
    "the method of hasegawa et al .",
    "( 1992 ) is used to calculate the tunneling and thermal rates associated with these parameters , adopting the faster of the two for any given temperature .",
    "for the majority of reactions , only gas - phase data are available , in which case the activation energy derived from fits to the lowest - temperature data - sets available are adopted for the surface / mantle reactions , assuming a barrier width of 1  . in cases where no data exist ,",
    "the activation energy , @xmath35 , is estimated using the evans - polanyi relationship , which states that the difference in @xmath35 between reactions of a similar type is proportional to the difference between the enthalpy changes associated with each reaction .",
    "parameters for the evans - polanyi relationship are obtained from dean & bozzelli ( 1999 ) , or from fits using similar reactions , indicated in table [ tab - act ] . where the enthalpy change of reaction is unknown , the activation energy of a similar reaction is used directly .",
    "there is evidence that the presence of a surrounding water - ice matrix may alter activation energy barriers for specific product branches ( e.g. goumans 2011 , in the case of formaldehyde - related chemistry ) , or lower the internal barriers to the structural re - arrangement of a product ( e.g. duvernay et al . 2005 , in the case of the isomerization of cyanamide ) .",
    "it is therefore plausible that some of the gas - phase activation energies used in this model over - estimate the barriers in the solid phase ; however , such effects are difficult to quantify without a specific computational or experimental study of each solid - phase reaction and its low - temperature tunneling characteristics .    for self - consistency , all reactions of surface radicals with complex species are now assumed to result in hydrogen abstraction , in contrast to gwh , who included a small selection of alternative substitution reactions for aldehyde group - bearing species .",
    "these reactions typically provided only minor destruction or formation routes for the species involved , and their removal has no significant influence over the glycine chemistry described below .",
    "all processes related to grain - surface chemistry outlined above are likewise incorporated into the chemistry of the bulk ice , with identical activation energies ( where present ) , while their reaction kinetics are instead defined by the bulk - ice diffusion parameters discussed in section 2.1 .",
    "photodissociation of ice mantles is also included to all depths , without attenuation , in line with previous models .",
    "this is a reasonable first - order approximation ; using the photon absorption cross - section of amorphous water ice for the first absorption band measured by mason et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , andersson & van dishoeck ( 2008 ) calculate an absorption probability per photon of 0.007 per monolayer of water ice .",
    "the maximum quantity of water ice formed on the grains in this model corresponds to @xmath1114 monolayers ; this would result in a uv field strength at the deepest ice layer of @xmath145% of the value at the surface .",
    "this corresponds to a mean value of 69% of the assumed field strength , for the ice mantle as a whole .",
    "however , the ices formed on interstellar dust - grain surfaces constitute a mixture of various molecular species , and the absorption cross - sections for many of these are currently unknown or poorly defined .",
    "no desorption processes are allowed from the bulk ice ; thus desorption of these species must proceed via a prior transfer of material from mantle to ice surface .",
    "diffusion competition is also included for reactions mediated by activation - energy barriers ( following g&p ) , for both surface and bulk - ice reactions ; this is perhaps the largest departure from the methods of gwh , as this change can produce reaction efficiencies many orders of magnitude different from the simple arrhenius treatment of previous models .",
    "surface desorption processes included are thermal evaporation ( as defined by the binding / desorption energy , @xmath36 ) , reactive desorption as described by garrod et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , and photo - desorption using measured rates determined by oberg et al .",
    "( 2009c , d ) ; following g&p , all surface species are assumed to photodesorb with an efficiency of @xmath37 , in the case where values are not provided by those authors .    the indirect mechanism for co@xmath0 formation proposed by g&p is also included for reactions both on the surfaces and within the ice mantles .",
    "the reproduction of the high observed abundance ( @xmath1@xmath38 with respect to h@xmath0 ) of methyl formate ( hcooch@xmath4 ) in hot cores has proved somewhat problematic in previous astrochemical models .",
    "garrod & herbst ( 2006 ) showed that grain - surface formation mechanisms could produce adequate quantities of methyl formate ( mf ) to explain observations ; however , in some cases it was found ( garrod et al .",
    "2008 ; belloche et al .",
    "2009 ) that the evaporation of mf at relatively low temperatures could result ( dependent on the warm - up timescale ) in only a small fraction of this material surviving the transition to the gas - phase .",

    "( 2009 ) adopted a higher binding energy for mf ( 5200 k vs. 4100 k ) , citing the importance of hydrogen bonding in the estimation of this value ; they found that this value produced results appropriate to observational abundance values for methyl formate .",

    "table [ tab - bind ] shows a selection of other binding energies used in the present model .      as found by gwh and laas et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , the rates and branching ratios of methanol photodissociation in the ice mantles are crucial to the production rates and ratios of various complex organic molecules detected in hot cores , as the ice - mantle methanol provides a large supply of structurally - complex organic material .",
    "the present model uses the methanol branching ratios derived from the experiments of oberg et al .",
    "( 2009a ) for products [ ch@xmath0oh+h]:[ch@xmath4o+h]:[ch@xmath4+oh ] of 5:1:1 . in the absence of other information , these values are applied to both the direct uv photodissociation by the interstellar radiation field , and to photodissociation by the secondary uv photons produced by cosmic rays , the latter of which is most important at the high visual extinctions of the hot - core phase .",
    "these ratios are applied throughout to the ice and gas phases , although , as found by laas et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , the importance of gas - phase methanol photodissociation to complex molecule production is minimal .    activation - energy treatments for co and h@xmath0co use best - fit expressions to uni - molecular and bi - molecular rates recently acquired through quantum transition state theory ( goumans , priv .",

    "we include a number of new radical - addition reactions relating to glycine and similar species .",
    "each hydrogenation step suggested by woon ( 2002 ) is included , although all but the final addition of nh@xmath0ch@xmath0 + hoco was already present in the network .",

    "reaction ( 5 ) is also complemented by exothermic radical - radical reactions with species ( e.g. hco ) that may donate a hydrogen atom to form two stable molecules , as described in section 2.2 .",
    "reaction ( 5 ) typically follows the photodissociation of , or h - abstraction from , glycine itself ; reactions ( 6)-(8 ) are thus the major potential formation routes .",
    "woon suggests the formation of hoco by the reaction of co and oh .",
    "this process is difficult to model accurately , due to the complex nature of the transition states ; the reaction may also lead to the formation of co@xmath0 + h ( see g&p , and references therein ) , or may dissociate back to co + oh , dependent on the rapidity of energy loss to the surface .",
    "as such , the oh + co reaction is modeled separately for each set of products , assuming an activation energy barrier of 2500 k for the hoco branch , following the approach of gwh . in practice , the formation of hoco in the model is dominated by the photodissociation of or chemical hydrogen abstraction from formic acid ( hcooh ) in the ice , which is formed predominantly by hco + oh additions ( see gwh ) .",
    "also included in the model is a selection of species similar to glycine , but with alternative functional groups .",

    "the inclusion of these other species ensures that the importance of reactions leading to glycine formation is not over - estimated due to the omission of competing reaction pathways .      as for other complex species ,",
    "the chemical network includes gas - phase destruction routes for glycine that consist of uv photodissociation , either by the cosmic ray - induced or standard interstellar radiation field , or by reactions with atomic or simple molecular ions .",

    "2006 ) , it is unclear whether such a high efficiency of ch@xmath0cn production by gas - phase electronic recombination is realistic .",
    "a value of 5 % , as adopted in these models for the recombination of more complex species , would render the earlier formation of aan by purely grain - surface chemistry the dominant mechanism , and would produce abundances close to the values observed toward sgr b2(n ) .",
    "propionaldehyde ( or propanal , c@xmath0h@xmath40cho ) and propionic acid ( or propanoic acid , c@xmath0h@xmath40cooh ) are structurally similar to glycinal and glycine , and neither have been treated in chemical models previously .",

    "production is most rapid at around 30 k , when the evaporation of grain - surface methane ( ch@xmath54 , panel a ) is fastest .",

    "formation on the ice surface at this time is sufficiently rapid that so - called reactive desorption , whereby the energy released from the exothermic formation of a surface molecule results in desorption ( e.g. garrod et al . 2007 ) , produces a gas - phase peak in the abundance of propionaldehyde of approximately @xmath55 @xmath47 .",
    "this period of carbon - rich gas - phase chemistry associated with methane evaporation is often labeled warm carbon - chain chemistry ( wccc ) , and has been identified observationally by sakai et al .",

    "the abundance of methanol in the ices is little affected by the warm - up timescales of each model .",
    "the fall in the gas - phase abundances is more significant , but the apparent differences between each timescale model are mainly due to the longer timescales over which the chemistry of the slower warm - up models is simulated , rather than to a difference in the rate of destruction .",

    "both of the following reactions are added to the network , assuming a rate constant of @xmath32 @xmath33 s@xmath34 for each :    @xmath70    neither of these processes was included in the models already analyzed in section 3 .      with the simple addition of reactions ( 11 ) , the results are unchanged ;",
    "the contribution of the gas - phase processes is never remotely significant compared to those on the dust - grains , in spite of the availability of both reactants at similar times / temperatures .",
    "it is noteworthy that the abundances of nh@xmath0oh acheived in the current models are around 3 orders of magnitude lower than those calculated by gwh ; the reason for this is that the major formation route for nh@xmath0oh on the grains is the addition of surface / ice - mantle nh@xmath0 and oh radicals .",
    "the availability of both these reactants is significantly curtailed in the present model by the inclusion of new hydrogen - abstraction reactions for these species ( see table [ tab - act ] ) and by the more accurate consideration of the kinetics of grain - surface reactions that are mediated by activation energy barriers ( see g&p ) ; each reactant is more readily converted back to h@xmath0o or nh@xmath4 before the oh and nh@xmath0 radicals are able to meet . a recent observational search by pulliam et al .",

    "the authors noted that emission from a region more compact than 5 arcsec would not be detectable with their instrument , while the model suggests that the nh@xmath0oh would be at least as compact as typical hot - core molecules such as methyl formate or ethanol , based on evaporation temperatures .",
    "nevertheless , the new model results for nh@xmath0oh are more in line with the observational data .",
    "however , a recent laboratory study suggests that the formation of nh@xmath0oh by successive grain - surface hydrogenation of no is extremely efficient ( congiu et al .",
    "2012 ) . while hydrogenation of no and hnoh are already present in the network , the reaction of h with hno has until now been assumed to lead to h - abstraction , with a barrier of 1500 k.    to increase the effect of the glycine - forming gas - phase reactions , a parallel branch is added to the surface / ice reaction set : h + hno @xmath31 hnoh .",
    "a barrier of 1500 k is also assumed ; but at low temperatures , the reaction competes effectively with hydrogen diffusion , producing a reaction efficiency that is close to unity . as a result ,",
    "large amounts of nh@xmath0oh are formed , in this case during the cold collapse phase , rather than the warm - up phase .",
    "a total fractional abundance of @xmath72 is present in the ice by the end of collapse , i.e. as the starting point for the warm - up phase ( see table [ tab - ice ] ) .",

    "the large quantities of nh@xmath0oh present in the dust - grain ices alters the fractional abundances of various species in the model by a small degree , although with a negligible direct effect on the production of glycine within the ice .",
    "the abundance of glycine is in fact slightly reduced , as a result of the somewhat lower quantity of acetic acid present in the ice .",
    "the destruction of gas - phase acetic acid is rather faster in this model , due to reaction ( 11a ) .",
    "however , when compared to an identical model with reaction ( 11a ) switched off ( not shown ) , the contribution of the gas - phase reaction to the total glycine formed in this model is around 2 % of the total formed on the grains .",
    "some of the glycine that is formed in the gas phase is re - accreted onto the grains , to evaporate later with the rest , while the remainder is destroyed by ion ",
    "molecule reactions .",
    "the immediate impact on gas - phase glycine abundance by the newly - included mechanisms may be seen in the small bump at around 130 k ; less than @xmath73 is produced .",
    "it may be noted that , if no glycine - production mechanisms of any kind were active in the ices , and all production thus depended on the gas - phase route , two abundance peaks would likely occur , at 130 k and 200 k , corresponding to peak production and peak evaporation , respectively .    on the the basis",
    "that this scenario represents the optimal conditions for gas - phase glycine formation to occur in a hot core ( including the use of a very optimistic reaction rate ) , it appears that the particular gas - phase formation mechanism tested is unlikely to be significant , especially if the mechanisms for formation within the dust - grain ice mantles are in operation as suggested by the model .",
    "the plausibility of such a large hydroxylamine abundance as would be required for significant glycine production is also discussed in section 5.3 .",
    "in order to compare the model results more directly with observations of specific sources , a spectroscopic model is constructed that combines observationally - determined temperature and density profiles with the temperature - dependent chemical outputs of the model , to simulate emission from a selection of key molecules for which observational data exist toward the given source ; this simulated emission is then convolved to allow direct comparison with the observed spectral data .",
    "the warm - up phase of the chemical model produces molecular fractional abundances for pre - defined output times , each corresponding to a temperature .",

    "line - of - sight integrals of the absorption coefficient similarly yield the optical depths .",

    "the predicted intensities between different lines ( within each model ) are very consistent , and peak _ local _ intensities range from around 1 k to 10 k , corresponding to _ fast _ and _ slow _ warm - up timescales , respectively .",
    "it is apparent that even for this very nearby and otherwise favorable hot - core source , the glycine emission strength is predicted to be very moderate ; convolving the emission with a beam appropriate to the jcmt ( @xmath120  22 arcesec ) produces line strengths of no more than 10 mk in the most optimistic model . in the case of",

    "this suggests that one of the strongest glycine emission lines could plausibly be detected toward the given source using this instrument , assuming that the _ slow _ model values are accurate ; a 3-@xmath87 line detection would require a noise level of around 10 mk ( assuming no line blending , which is not modeled here ) .",
    "however , detection assuming either of the other model values would require impractical signal - to - noise values .",
    "in order to make an approximate estimate of the detectability of glycine using alma , the same single - beam convolution method is used , along with two plausible , fixed beam sizes : a generic 1 arcsec beam , and a 0.4 arcsec beam to match the size of the region of strongest glycine emission ( see fig . [ fig - profile ] ) . the reduced beam - dilution produced in these cases results in much greater line strengths , and suggests that the detection of a strong glycine line with alma is very plausible ( line blending and model inaccuracies notwithstanding ) .",
    "the weakest emission predicted for any of the simulated glycine lines , with a beam width of 1 arcsec , is @xmath187 mk , while at 0.4 arcsec the weakest line has a strength of @xmath1350 mk . under the optimistic _ slow _ warm - up model conditions ,",

    "the implication for the models is that the cold - stage conversion of no / hno to nh@xmath0oh on the grains is too efficient , nominally by a factor of 10 .",
    "this would suggest that the gas - phase formation of significant quantities of glycine is also less probable , in all sources .",
    "the apparent over - estimate of hydroxylamine production could be explained by several possibilities ; one is that the chemical network does not include a sufficent number of competing reaction mechanisms for all of the states of hydrogenation between no and nh@xmath0oh .",
    "another possibility is that the determination that the reaction h + hno @xmath31 h@xmath0no has an insignificant barrier , by congiu et al .",
    "( 2012 ) , is dependent on experimental conditions that are inappropriate to these models , such as the ice composition , which is predominantly water in the ism .",
    "alternatively , the hydroxylamine abundance in the ice may be adversely affected either by photo - destruction or hydrogen abstraction processes within the ice , whose rates or barriers may be inaccurately quantified in the models .",
    "the general behavior of complex molecules as simulated in the new models is broadly similar to that seen in the previous models , such as g&h and gwh ; evaporation of grain - surface molecules into the gas - phase occurs around the same temperatures and in similar quantities .",
    "however , the formation temperatures of molecules on the grains are somewhat different , due both to the distinction between surface and ice - mantle populations and to the difference in diffusion rates in each medium ; hco - related species are formed strongly around 25 k , while ch@xmath4-related species are formed around 20 k  both somewhat lower than previous models , though more in line with recent experimental results such as @xcite .",
    "the interaction between the surface and ice - mantle chemistry in the models is complex ; mobile radicals may land on the ice surface from the gas phase or may diffuse out of the mantle , to react to form more complex species , which show a net diffusion back into the mantle as more volatile species move out .",
    "the migration of mantle species to the surface as temperatures increase tends to mitigate the ` trapping ' effect that would be expected using a model in which there were no surface ",
    "mantle diffusion .",
    "much complex chemistry also occurs within the mantles themselves , particularly at elevated temperatures .",
    "the importance of mantle versus surface processes is dependent on the source of the reactants , the mobilities of the reactants , the temperature , and the general composition of the surrounding ice ; no _ general _ statement can therefore be made on this point other than that the diffusion within the ice mantles , and between the surface and the bulk ice , appears to play a major part in hot - core chemistry .",
    "( although the importance for specific , individual molecules is discussed in section 3 ) .    aside from the effects of the differing treatment of the physical structure of the ices employed in this model , the inclusion of a more comprehensive set of hydrogen - abstraction reactions in the ice chemistry also demonstrates the key role of water and oh in producing other free radicals within the ice that may go on to form more complex organic structures .",
    "the oh radical is highly reactive , and may abstract hydrogen from stable molecules with only a small activation energy  typically lower than the barrier to oh diffusion .",
    "thus , hydrogen abstraction by oh may occur with a net rate equal to its rate of diffusion , in the case where the target molecule is less mobile than oh .",
    "the large quantities of water present in the ice makes oh the most commonly produced photodissociation product , caused by the weak , cosmic ray - induced , uv radiation that permeates the hot core .",
    "the complex molecules , such as glycolaldehyde ( ch@xmath0(oh)cho ) , ethanol ( c@xmath0h@xmath40oh ) and methyl formate ( hcooch@xmath4 ) , formed by the addition of hco or ch@xmath4 to the photoproducts of methanol ( ch@xmath4oh ) are produced early , at low temperatures , before oh becomes mobile ( or abundant ) .",
    "their production is therefore reflective of the direct photodissociation of methanol into ch@xmath0oh , ch@xmath4o and ch@xmath4 .    while greater temperatures increase oh mobility , below 40 k its primary destruction route ( and the primary formation route for hco ) is the reaction oh + h@xmath0co @xmath31 hco + h@xmath0o , which is assumed to require no activation energy .",
    "the mobility of h@xmath0co itself drives the reaction , and it is not until h@xmath0co evaporates at around 40 k that oh becomes important in providing radicals other than hco . after this , hco becomes less prevalent in the ices , while ch@xmath4 is still produced in some abundance by methanol photodissociation , resulting in a moderate bias toward methyl - group addition over aldehyde production . at this point , ammonia ( nh@xmath4 ) and methanol , as major constituents of the ice , become the dominant reaction partners for oh , producing nh@xmath0 and ch@xmath0oh ( ch@xmath4o is also produced , but the higher activation energy for this process renders it uncompetitive versus the hydroxymethyl channel ) .",
    "it is therefore at temperatures above @xmath140 k that the formation of amino - organics becomes most active , by addition of nh@xmath0 to methanol products , or to more complex radicals .",
    "however , at even higher temperatures , nh@xmath0 also becomes an important source of radicals in itself , as the barriers to hydrogen abstraction by nh@xmath0 are relatively low compared to its diffusion barrier , as is the case for oh . above around 55 k , the photodissociation of water into oh typically results in the subsequent conversion of ammonia to nh@xmath0 , which becomes the ultimate agent of hydrogen abstraction from organic molecules in the ice .",
    "this continues until ammonia , the source of nh@xmath0 radicals , evaporates at @xmath1120 k.      the inclusion in the model of ice surface / mantle formation mechanisms for glycine indicates that it may be formed in a number of ways , whose degree of influence depends on the timescale of the hot - core evolution .",
    "the abundance of acetic acid ( ch@xmath4cooh ) is perhaps most important in determining which mechanism is most important . in",
    "the _ slow _ warm - up model , acetic acid abundance is relatively high within the ices , and the abstraction of hydrogen by nh@xmath0 , followed by the addition of another amine group , is the most important glycine - formation route .",
    "the same is true , albeit to a lesser extent , for the _ medium _ warm - up timescale model .",
    "the _ fast _ warm - up model produces less acetic acid , and the addition of ch@xmath0nh@xmath0 and hoco  products of oh - induced hydrogen abstraction from methylamine and formic acid , respectively  becomes the major formation route in conjunction with oh addition to the nh@xmath0ch@xmath0co radical , which is formed by abstraction from the amino aldehyde glycinal ( nh@xmath0ch@xmath0cho ) .",
    "it is questionable as to whether the high acetic acid abundances produced by the _ slow _ model are supported by observations , indicating both that glycine abundances may be lower than suggested by that model , and that no single ice surface / mantle process of the three that are tested in this work should be strongly dominant .",
    "it may also be noted that , in the case of the ch@xmath0nh@xmath0 + hoco glycine - formation route , a plausible alternative channel , producing ch@xmath4nh@xmath0 + co@xmath0 , may also be important . in this model",
    "a branching ratio of 1:1 is assumed ; however , the accuracy of this assumption can not be ascertained without experimental or computational data for the solid - phase process ( as opposed to the gas - phase equivalent , in which glycine production would be prohibitively disfavored ) .",
    "the effect of a lower efficiency for glycine production through this method would be strongest in the _ fast _ warm - up scenario , although the availability of alternative routes means that glycine abundance is unlikely to fall by more than a factor of 2 as a result ; conversely , a more favorable branching ratio could increase the glycine production by a similar factor under _ fast _ warm - up conditions .",
    "a gas - phase mechanism for the formation of glycine was also tested in this model , consisting of the addition of protonated hydroxylamine ( nh@xmath4oh@xmath10 ) and acetic acid ( ch@xmath4cooh ) , followed by electronic recombination . even assuming the highest plausible rate , with large quantities of hydroxylamine and acetic acid produced on the grains , the amount of glycine produced is only on the order of @xmath55@xmath47 , or 1% of the amount formed on the dust grains .",
    "the limited comparison of simulated nh@xmath0oh emission with observations suggests that the actual fractional abundance may indeed be lower than assumed in that model .",
    "it is possible that the fraction of dissociative recombination of protonated glycine that produce glycine itself may be somewhat higher than assumed ( 5% ) , but it is unlikely to be underestimated by more than a factor of a few . the combination of favorable conditions and rates that would be required therefore suggest that gas - phase production by this method is unlikely to produce significant quantities of glycine .",
    "the possibility , demonstrated in the models , for significant glycine production to occur through several distinct chemical routes suggests that the formation of glycine within the ice mantles is no less plausible than the formation of more commonly observed complex organic molecules .",
    "the peak gas - phase fractional abundances for glycine of @xmath89 ",
    "@xmath90 produced by the chemical models suggest that this molecule could be reasonably abundant in regions within hot cores .",
    "however , the lte radiative transfer and convolution models suggest that the detection of glycine toward a favorable source may be impossible with single - dish instruments , assuming any but the most optimistic of the chemical models ; this is due largely to the extremely compact emission exhibited by glycine .",
    "the model findings are therefore in agreement with the current lack of a detection of this molecule .",
    "however , it appears that the new alma telescope will have sufficient sensitivity and spatial resolution to easily detect the strongest glycine emission lines , assuming that the emission is not obscured by that from other molecules , and that the source is sufficiently closeby that the highly compact glycine - emission region is well resolved .",
    "detection will likely require the careful choice of sources that are both nearby and that exhibit narrow emission lines .",
    "for this reason , detection toward the well - observed galactic center source sgr b2(n ) may be questionable . while alma should allow the distinction of different structures within that source , which contribute to the considerable line widths ( belloche et al .",
    "2008 ) , it is not clear whether a predicted compact glycine - emission region ( of temperature @xmath91200 k ) could be resolved sufficiently well both to produce high enough line strengths for detection and to filter out contamination from other molecules .",
    "no simulations  such as those produced above for other sources  are possible , due to the absence of _ both _ a temperature and density profile for sgr b2(n ) in the literature .",
    "the most important factor in the detectibility of glycine toward hot cores is likely to be its binding energy , which determines its evaporation temperature , and thus its radius of peak fractional abundance .",
    "the simulations of glycine emission in ngc 6334 irs1 suggest that the strongest glycine emission should emanate from a region @xmath11000 au in diameter within that source .",
    "this putative emission is predicted to be detectable with alma .",
    "the single - dish convolution of the simulated emission shown in section 5.2 , using a beam width of 0.4 arcsec as appropriate to alma , represents a first approximation to the detectibility of glycine at that resolution ; the use of an interferometer would produce spatial filtering such that the more extended emission of other hot - core molecules could be resolved out , lessening the impact of contamination from other lines on the glycine emission .",
    "the combined chemical and spectroscopic models produce a very good match with observed methanol line emission toward ngc 6334 irs1 .",
    "the match for methyl formate is also good , in the case of the two shorter - timescale models ; warm - up timescales of around 1 myr may not therefore be appropriate to hot cores , although the precise binding energy of methyl formate is important to this determination .",
    "the methyl formate results also indicate that , while other mechanisms may plausibly exist for the formation of methyl formate in hot cores , the addition of methanol photo - fragments within the dust - grain ice mantles , as modeled here , appears adequate to explain observed abundances .",
    "meanwhile , the structural isomer of methyl formate , glycolaldehyde , is almost certainly over - produced , although this may be remedied by a more careful consideration of the product branching ratios of the reaction between hco and ch@xmath0oh radicals in the ices .",
    "branching ratios favoring an alternative [ co + ch@xmath4oh ] channel would seem plausible .",
    "all of the radiative transfer calculations presented here are highly dependent on the observationally - determined temperature  density  radius profiles provided by van der tak et al .",
    "while the simulations of methanol and methyl formate emission agree remarkably well with recent observational data , the uncertainty in the profiles naturally increases at smaller radii , and the fidelity of a spherically - symmetric model must inevitably break down where outflows or clumpy structure become important .",
    "nevertheless , in the absence of more precise data , perhaps also to be provided by alma , the simple models used here provide a first quantitative estimate of the behavior and detectability of glycine in star - forming regions .",
    "a more comprehensive assessment would also incorporate the analysis of potential line blending , using spectroscopic models that include all species for which data exist , as well as an explicit treatment to simulate interferometric observations where appropriate .",
    "the main conclusions of this work are summarized below :    1 .",
    "the hot - core chemical models predict peak gas - phase glycine abundances of @xmath1@xmath89 ",
    "@xmath90 @xmath47 ( dependent on warm - up timescale ) .",
    "the peak abundance values are attained at around 200 k , when glycine evaporates from the dust grains .",
    "2 .   glycine is found to form almost exclusively within or upon dust - grain ice mantles , beginning at temperatures of @xmath14050 k , and ending at @xmath1120 k. the three main radical  radical addition mechanisms investigated appear to have approximately equal influence on the resultant gas - phase quantities .",
    "gas - phase glycine formation involving acetic acid ( ch@xmath4cooh ) and protonated hydroxylamine ( nh@xmath4oh@xmath10 ) is insignificant under even the most optimistic conditions .",
    "4 .   related organic species such as propionic acid , propionaldehyde ( propanal ) , and the amino aldehyde glycinal are predicted also to attain significant gas - phase abundances , although their detectibility would be dependent also on their emission radii , via their evaporation temperatures .",
    "the production of glycinal ( nh@xmath0ch@xmath0cho ) and acetic acid ( ch@xmath4cooh )  two key molecules in the formation of glycine in the ice mantles  are strongly dependent on the earlier production of acetaldehyde ( ch@xmath4cho ) .",
    "acetaldehyde and acetic acid could provide observational information on potential glycine abundances in the absence of direct detection .",
    "6 .   the current lack of a detection of glycine toward hot cores may be explained by its high temperature of evaporation , which results in a small emission radius .",
    "glycine is not expected to be detectable with single - dish instruments over realizable integration times toward any hot - core source .",
    "the spectroscopic model suggests glycine may be detectable using alma at sub - arcsecond resolutions toward bright , nearby sources with relatively narrow emission lines , such as ngc 6334 irs1 .",
    ".   observed methyl formate abundances are well reproduced by the two shorter - timescale models , indicating that grain - related formation mechanisms are sufficient ( as suggested by previous models ) , and that ( 8400 k ) warm - up timescales of around 1 myr may be inappropriate for hot cores .",
    "the anomalously high abundance produced by the models for the structural isomer of methyl formate , glyclolaldehyde , may be remedied by the consideration of alternative branches for the hco + ch@xmath0oh reaction in the ice mantles , favoring the formation of co + ch@xmath4oh .",
    "cosmic ray - induced photodissociation of water ice , to produce oh , is crucial to the production of radicals within the bulk ices .",
    "the oh radicals easily abstract hydrogen from other molecules , including ammonia , to produce reactive molecular radicals that may combine to form more complex species . 11 .",
    "nh@xmath0 , formed by hydrogen abstraction from ammonia by oh , also appears to be an important agent of radical propagation within the ice mantles .",
    "this process , and the related production of amino - organics , becomes most significant at temperatures between @xmath140120 k. the observed nitrogen content of hot - core molecules may thus be related to the timescale spent in this temperature range .",
    "much , if not most , of the chemistry that produces complex organic molecules occurs within the ice mantles , while the more rapid diffusion that obtains on the ice surface allows different reaction kinetics to occur concurrently .",
    "thus , the explicit treatment of these two phases , their coupling via thermal diffusion , and the interaction of the dust / ice surface with the gas phase are all essential elements in the chemical model . 13 .",
    "the simple spectroscopic model used here provides a direct comparison between chemical models and observational spectroscopic data for complex molecules in specific sources , an element that has been lacking until now in the study of hot cores .",
    "the author thanks the referee for providing helpful comments , and k. berg for a critical reading of the manuscript and many valuable discussions .",

    "<S> a new chemical model is presented that simulates fully - coupled gas - phase , grain - surface and bulk - ice chemistry in hot cores . </S>",
    "<S> glycine ( nh@xmath0ch@xmath0cooh ) , the simplest amino acid , and related molecules such as glycinal , propionic acid and propanal , are included in the chemical network . </S>",
    "<S> glycine is found to form in moderate abundance within and upon dust - grain ices via three radical - addition mechanisms , with no single mechanism strongly dominant . </S>",
    "<S> glycine production in the ice occurs over temperatures @xmath140120 k. peak gas - phase glycine fractional abundances lie in the range @xmath2@xmath3 , occuring at @xmath1200 k , the evaporation temperature of glycine . a gas - phase mechanism for glycine production is tested and found insignificant , even under optimal conditions . </S>",
    "<S> a new spectroscopic radiative - transfer model is used , allowing the translation and comparison of the chemical - model results with observations of specific sources . </S>",
    "<S> comparison with the nearby hot - core source ngc 6334 irs1 shows excellent agreement with integrated line intensities of observed species , including methyl formate . </S>",
    "<S> the results for glycine are consistent with the current lack of a detection of this molecule toward other sources ; the high evaporation temperature of glycine renders the emission region extremely compact . </S>",
    "<S> glycine detection with alma is predicted to be highly plausible , for bright , nearby sources with narrow emission lines . </S>",
    "<S> photodissociation of water and subsequent hydrogen - abstraction from organic molecules by oh , and nh@xmath0 , are crucial to the build - up of complex organic species in the ice . </S>",
    "<S> the inclusion of alternative branches within the network of radical - addition reactions appears important to the abundances of hot - core molecules ; less favorable branching ratios may remedy the anomalously high abundance of glycolaldehyde predicted by this and previous models . </S>"
