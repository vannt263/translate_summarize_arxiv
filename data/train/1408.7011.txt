    "the kam ( kolmogorov - arnold - moser ) @xcite theorem is one of the most important results in the stability theory of hamiltonian systems .",
    "the theorem asserts that most of the invariant @xmath1-tori of @xmath1 degrees of freedom integrable hamiltonian systems will persist under small hamiltonian perturbations .",
    "arnold proved this theorem under both non - degenerate and degenerate assumptions on the unperturbed hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "moser proved a version of the theorem for the perturbation of two dimensional integrable twist map @xcite ( chapter 3 ; section 32 ) . in both of these cases",
    "the system is defined on an even dimensional manifold and has a symplectic structure .",
    "extension of the kam theorem to odd dimensional systems is a challenging problem , that has many practical applications @xcite .",
    "volume - preserving flows and maps which arise in the context of fluid dynamics and magnetohydrodynamics are of odd dimensions . because of that , these maps and flows have a looser structure than symplectic maps and flows .",
    "the kam - type results have been developed for volume - preserving flows @xcite and for diffeomorphisms which either preserve volume @xcite or satisfy the intersection property , a relaxed version of volume- preservation @xcite .",
    "the result in this paper differs from the above mentioned references in that we prove the kam - type result for the degenerate case of three - dimensional volume preserving maps ( in fact , more generally for action - angle - angle maps with one degenerate angle and satisfying the intersection property ) .",
    "a kam - type result for maps with unequal number of actions and angles and with degeneracy of the same type as that considered by us also appears in @xcite .",
    "however there are some major differences between the kam proof that appears in @xcite and the main results of this paper .",
    "in particular , in @xcite , the kam - type results are proved for the case where the size of the perturbations are assumed to be smaller than the size of the degenerate drift in the angles , whereas in this paper we assume that both the degenerate drift and the perturbations are of same size .",
    "furthermore the proof in the paper @xcite achieves their stated result only when an additional - unstated - assumption on the perturbation is used ( see section [ first ] below ) .",
    "similarly @xcite prove kam type result for the case where the unperturbed system consists of arbitrary number of action and angle variables .",
    "however the set - up does not consider the case of degenerate angle which is the case discussed in our paper .    the degenerate three dimensional volume preserving action - angle - angle map considered in this paper arises in the context of fluid flow problems .",
    "the following example from @xcite , shows how such action - angle - angle maps can arise in three - dimensional incompressible volume - preserving flows , which are invariant under a one - parameter symmetry group .",
    "consider the following flow in cylindrical coordinates .",
    "@xmath2    where @xmath3 is an arbitrary constant .",
    "the system preserves the volume form @xmath4 @xcite . in the fluid - mechanics context",
    ", @xmath5 is the circulation .",
    "the flow ( [ example ] ) is a superposition of the well - known hill s spherical vortex with a line vortex on the @xmath6 axis , which induces the swirl velocity @xmath7 . the system of equation satisfies euler s equation of motion for the an inviscid incompressible fluid everywhere except on the @xmath6 axis , where the swirl velocity becomes infinite . after transforming the first two components into canonical hamiltonian form by letting @xmath8 , the system ( [ example ] ) becomes @xmath9 this system preserves the volume form @xmath10 @xcite and in the @xmath11 components takes the form    @xmath12    where @xmath13 is the hamiltonian . by first introducing action - angle coordinate with respect to form @xmath14 , we transform @xmath15 to action - angle coordinate i.e. , @xmath16 . to obtain action - angle - angle flow , we would need to perform addition transformation on the angle variable @xmath17 to get the second angle variable @xmath18 ( for the details of the derivation refer to @xcite ) .",
    "hence we get , @xmath19 for the case where @xmath3 is very large ( i.e. , @xmath20 or @xmath21 ) , we get the following degenerate action - angle - angle flow equations , after rescaling time @xmath22 and in the limiting case of @xmath23 .",
    "@xmath24    the dynamics of ( [ aaa ] ) evolves on a cylinder torus and consist of periodic orbits ( refer to fig .",
    "[ fig ] for the schematic ) . in this paper , we are interested in time periodic volume preserving perturbations of degenerate action - angle - angle flows as given in ( [ aaa ] ) and the three dimensional maps that arise from it after taking appropriate poincare section .",
    "we study the perturbation of the above discussed hill spherical vortex flow for the case of large swirl in further detail in section [ hill ] .",
    "geometrical structures such as invariant manifolds play an important role in understanding the transport dynamics - specifically mixing and the lack thereof - in such maps . from numerical studies and perturbation method calculations",
    ", no invariant two - dimensional structure persists upon perturbation from an integrable action - angle - angle map with degenerate angle @xcite .",
    "however the numerical studies carried out in @xcite do not consider the class of perturbations for which the main result of this paper is proved and in fact corresponds to class of perturbations that is indicated in @xcite as ones with possibility of having invariant tori .",
    "dynamics related to transport in phase space for action - angle - angle maps with dynamically degenerate angle has been studied systematically in @xcite where it is shown that for a large class of such maps , upon perturbation , most of the invariant surfaces are broken .",
    "the invariant surfaces break where resonance exists and at these locations in phase space , periodic orbits of specific types persist and dominate transport .",
    "this has been named resonance - induced dispersion @xcite .",
    "the result in this paper proves that , for a different class of perturbations , whose structure was also discussed in @xcite , two - dimensional invariant tori indeed exists for the perturbed action - angle - angle maps with degenerate angle satisfying intersection property - a condition that is implied by volume preservation .",
    "this proves the conjecture on such maps stated in @xcite .",
    "the kam type of result for the action - angle - angle maps is analogous to the degenerate hamiltonian case treated by arnold @xcite . in proving this degenerate case of kam ,",
    "we are faced with two important problems .",
    "the first is due to unequal numbers of fast and slow variables . because of",
    "this a drift term is introduced at each step of the coordinate transformations , we solve this problem by using proof techniques similar to the one which appears in @xcite .",
    "the second problem is due to the degenerate nature of the one of the angles .",
    "we solve this problem by introducing an intermediate finite sequence of coordinate transformations .",
    "this finite sequence of coordinate transformations is different from the intermediate coordinate transformations which appear in arnold s proof @xcite of degenerate kam .",
    "the difference arises because of the difficulty with carrying out the moser strategy of solution of the sequence of equations by backward substitution which in this case leads to @xmath25 terms after an iteration step .",
    "thus our proof is different in nature from the degenerate kam proof which appears in @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ form ] , we state the main theorem for the persistence of invariant tori in action - angle - angle maps with a degenerate angle . in section [ outl ] ,",
    "we give an outline of the proof .",
    "simulation results for the hill s spherical vortex example are presented in section [ hill ] followed by conclusions in section [ conc ] .",
