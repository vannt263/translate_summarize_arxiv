    "quite recently , hubbard and schleicher @xcite proved that the multicorns are not path connected , confirming a conjecture of milnor .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to reveal the structure of the boundaries of the hyperbolic components and bifurcation phenomena .",
    "when the period is even , we show that the branched covering property of the multiplier map ( which is real - analytic but not holomorphic ) extends to the boundary as if it were holomorphic .",
    "this implies that bifurcations from the boundary of an even period component always occur at single parabolic parameters .",

    ", we utilize our work on orbit portraits and wake structures to prove a discontinuity of landing points of external dynamical rays , in contrast to the situation for the mandelbrot set .",
    "this phenomenon is reminiscent of the parameter spaces of cubic ( or higher degree ) polynomials .",
    "in section [ no.ofhypcomps ] , we relate the number of hyperbolic components of a given period of the multicorns to the corresponding number for the multibrot sets ( the connectedness loci of @xmath28 , denoted by @xmath29 ) .",

    "as shown in figure [ tricorncover ] , the circle @xmath37 consists of maps with parabolic fixed points , and most parameters on this circle have neighborhoods in which every parameter has an attracting or indifferent fixed point : the open mapping principle for the multiplier map fails in this parametrization !",
    "this is related to a different problem of the parametrization : within the family @xmath38 , each map @xmath5 is conformally conjugate to two other maps ( with parameters @xmath39 and @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is any third root of unity ) .",
    "however , in the family @xmath42 , each map is conjugate to three or two further maps in the same family , depending on whether or not there is an attracting fixed point ( in both cases , the exceptional case @xmath43 respectively  @xmath44 behaves differently ) .",

    "this work was partially supported by a grant from the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft dfg , which we gratefully acknowledge .",

    "we define the degree of @xmath55 as the number of pre - images of any point , so it is always positive ; equivalently , @xmath9 is the degree of the proper holomorphic map @xmath57 which is the complex conjugate of @xmath55 .",
    "there is also an antiholomorphic analog to the straightening theorem ( * ? ? ?",

    ".    moreover , every neighborhood of @xmath60 contains parameters for which all period @xmath24 orbits are repelling .",
    "the idea of the proof is the same as the one for holomorphic polynomials by douady  ( * ? ? ? *",

    "it is easier to prove this result in the family @xmath61 as described in the introduction .",
    "the map @xmath62 is conformally conjugate to @xmath63 with @xmath64 .",

    "the straightening theorem supplies an antiholomorphic polynomial of equal degree with a single critical point in @xmath52 of maximal multiplicity , so it is conformally conjugate to a map @xmath65 for a unique @xmath66 .",
    "the beltrami differential in the straightening theorem can be chosen to be arbitrarily close to zero when the perturbation is small enough , so @xmath67 can be chosen arbitrarily close to @xmath68 .",
    "this shows the result in the family @xmath46 , and it follows in the original family because the mapping @xmath69 is a covering map of degree @xmath17 .",
    "now we prove theorem [ thmevenbif ] which shows the existence of bifurcations at parabolic parameters with even periodic parabolic cycles .",
    "this is subtler to prove than in the holomorphic case : if @xmath62 has an indifferent cycle of period @xmath24 and multiplier @xmath70 with @xmath71 in lowest terms and @xmath72 , then in the holomorphic case it simply follows from the open mapping principle that @xmath60 is on the boundary of a hyperbolic component of period @xmath73 . in the antiholomorphic case",

    "the rest of the proof is as usual : restrict @xmath62 to an anti - polynomial - like map of degree @xmath9 and make @xmath108 small enough so that after perturbation we still get an anti - polynomial - like map of degree @xmath9 ; straightening yields a unicritical antiholomorphic polynomial @xmath116 , and @xmath117 depends continuously on @xmath108 with @xmath118 ( continuity is not in general true for straightening , but our construction assures that the quasiconformal gluing map has dilatation tending to zero as @xmath119 ) .    note that we have @xmath84 choices of the @xmath84-th root in @xmath115 , but the multiplier is independent of this choice ( at least to leading order ) .",
    "all @xmath84 choices of @xmath109 will thus be attracting simultaneously .",
