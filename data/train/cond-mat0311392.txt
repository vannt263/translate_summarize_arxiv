    "impurity effects are at the center of interest in studies of superconducting ( sc ) materials , especially of those with high transition temperature ( htsc ) . in the general theory of disordered systems with disorder due to",
    "diluted impurity centers , the so - called group expansion ( ge ) method was proposed as most consistent for quasiparticle green function ( gf ) @xcite , and it was also formulated for sc systems @xcite .",
    "the ge s of different types ( see below ) are analogous to the classical ursell - mayer group series in the theory of non - ideal gases @xcite , where the particular terms ( the group integrals ) include physical interactions in groups of the given number of particles . in the quantum theory of solids",
    ", ge includes indirect interactions ( dependent on the excitation energy @xmath2 ) between the impurity centers , through the exchange by virtual excitations from ( admittedly renormalized ) band spectrum , so that each term corresponds to summation of certain infinite series of diagrams .",
    "these expansions were elaborated in a detail for various kinds of normal quasiparticle spectra , where they define the interplay between extended and localized states @xcite , however their usage in sc systems encounters considerable technical difficulties due to existence of anomalous gf s .",
    "the present paper is aimed on an efficient algorithm for resolving these difficulties .",
    "we develop the specific algebraic techniques to calculate nambu matrices in various terms of ge for the exemplary case of s - wave symmetry of sc order parameter , permitting to explore the impurity effects in this case beyond the scope of anderson theorem @xcite .",
    "in particular , we find that pair clusters of impurities ( 2nd term of ge ) can not produce finite contribution into the quasiparticle density of states ( dos ) within the s - wave gap , alike the simplest effect of isolated impurities ( 1st ge term ) , but a non - zero contribution into the in - gap dos is already possible for the 3rd ge term ( impurity triples ) .",
    "these results allow also a straightforward extension to the d - wave symmetry characteristic for doped htsc materials ( where the dopants not only supply the charge carriers but also play the role of impurity scatterers ) .",
    "for description of electronic spectra in a sc system with impurities , it is convenient to use the formalism of nambu spinors : the row - spinor @xmath3 and respective column - spinor @xmath4 , writing the hamiltonian in a spinor form @xmath5.\\label{eq:1}\\ ] ] it includes the normal quasiparticle energy @xmath6 , the mean - field gap function @xmath7 , the pauli matrices @xmath8 and the perturbation matrix @xmath9 .",
    "the impurity ( attractive ) perturbation on random sites @xmath10 with concentration @xmath11 is described by the lifshitz parameter @xmath12 .",
    "the energy spectrum of a fermi system is described through the fourier transformed two - time green functions ( gf s ) @xcite : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the quantum statistical average and @xmath15 is the anticommutator of operators in heisenberg representation . for the system ,",
    ". [ eq:1 ] , we define the @xmath16 nambu matrix of gf s @xmath17 the matrix elements in the expanded form of eq .",
    "[ eq:3 ] are the well - known gorkov normal and anomalous functions @xcite . in",
    "what follows , we shall also distinguish between the nambu indices ( n - indices ) and the quasi - momentum indices ( m - indices ) in this matrix .",
    "in absence of impurities , the explicit form of the matrix , eq . [ eq:3 ] , turns : @xmath18 , where the non - perturbed ( m - diagonal ) gf matrix @xmath19 involves the sc quasiparticle energy @xmath20 .",
    "the relevant physical properties of sc state are suitably expressed in terms of these gf s . for instance , the single - particle dos , related to the electronic specific heat , is given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the m - diagonal gf .",
    "now we pass to calculation of gf s in sc systems at finite concentration @xmath23 of impurity centers and analyze explicit structure of corresponding ge s .",
    "we derive ge s for the system defined by the hamiltonian eq .",
    "[ eq:1 ] , starting from the dyson equation of motion for a matrix gf : @xmath24 a routine consists in consecutive iterations of the same equations for the gf s in the `` scattering '' terms of eq .",
    "[ eq:6 ] and separating systematically those already present in the previous iterations @xcite .",
    "thus , for the m - diagonal gf @xmath25 , we first separate the scattering term with the function @xmath25 itself from those with @xmath26 , @xmath27 : @xmath28 then for each @xmath26 , @xmath27 we write down eq .",
    "[ eq:6 ] again and single out the scattering terms with @xmath25 and @xmath26 in its r.h.s : @xmath29 note that among the terms with @xmath25 , the @xmath30 term ( the second in r.h.s . of eq .",
    "[ eq:8 ] ) bears the phase factor @xmath31 , so it is coherent to that already figured in the last sum in eq .",
    "that is why this term is explicitly separated from other , incoherent ones , @xmath32 , @xmath33 ( but there will be no such separation when doing 1st iteration of eq .",
    "[ eq:6 ] for the m - non - diagonal gf @xmath34 itself ) .",

    "the second term of ge , obtained by summation in @xmath35 of the ii)-terms , contains certain interaction matrices @xmath36 generated by the multiply scattered functions @xmath26 , @xmath27 , etc . , ( including their own renormalization ) .",
    "for instance , the iterated equation of motion for a function @xmath34 with @xmath37 in the last term of eq .",

    "there are even more such restrictions in each product of these matrices : @xmath45 , and so on .",
    "this seems to seriously hamper calculation of the sum @xmath46 in eq .",
    "[ eq:11 ] ( not to say about higher ge terms ) .",
    "however , the difficulty is avoided , taking into account the identities for two first terms of its expansion @xcite : @xmath47 and @xmath48 due to the momentum independence of t - matrix , and the fact that the restrictions can be simply ignored in the higher products , like @xmath49 etc .",
    "thus we arrive at the final form for the renormalized ge @xmath50\\label{eq:11a}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath51 and the renormalized local gf matrices @xmath52 and @xmath53 are already free from restrictions .",
    "the two terms , next to unity in the brackets in eq .",
    "[ eq:11a ] , correspond to the excluded double occupancy of the same site by impurities , the sum in @xmath54 describes the averaged contribution of all possible impurity pairs , and the dropped terms are for triples and more of impurities .    an alternative routine for eq .",
    "[ eq:6 ] consists in its iteration for _ all _ the terms @xmath34 and summing the contributions @xmath55 , like the first term in r.h.s . of eq .",

    "ge s generally leads to respective expansions for its observable characteristics .",
    "for instance , the impurity perturbed dos is expected in the form : @xmath62 , related to contributions of pure crystal , isolated impurities , impurity pairs , etc .    however , usage of each type of ge , the renormalized eq .",
    "[ eq:11a ] or the non - renormalized eq .",
    "[ eq:13 ] , is only justified if they are convergent ( at least , asymptotically ) .",
    "since the matrices @xmath63 and @xmath64 are energy dependent , convergence of each type of ge is restricted to certain energy ranges , and these ranges are generally different . for a number of normal systems with impurities , where ge s are constructed of scalar functions @xmath65 , it was shown that the renormalized ge converges within the region of band - like states , well characterized by the wave - vector , and the non - renormalized ge does within the region of localized states @xcite . to get quantitative estimates of convergence and higher order contributions to self - energy , operating with the matrix functions @xmath66 in eqs .",
    "[ eq:11a ] and [ eq:13 ] , a special techniques is necessary that we construct below .",
    "let us explicitly calculate the elements of above defined ge s for the simplest s - wave symmetry of the sc gap function : @xmath67 .",
    "the unperturbed local gf matrix is obtained as an expansion in pauli matrices : @xmath68 where @xmath69 defines the s - wave dos in pure crystal : @xmath70 ( with the fermi dos @xmath71 of normal quasiparticles ) , and the electron - hole asymmetry factor@xmath72 is almost constant and real .",
    "then we readily calculate the non - renormalized t - matrix:@xmath73 with the dimensionless perturbation parameter@xmath74 since the denominator @xmath75 in eq .",
    "[ eq:15 ] can not be zero , the quasiparticle localization on a single impurity center in the considered s - wave superconductor turns impossible @xcite . if the self - energy is approximated by the first term of ge : @xmath76 , then eq . [ eq:15 ] used in eq .",
    "[ eq:12 ] and in eq .",
    "[ eq:5 ] leads to the same dos @xmath77 ( that is , @xmath78 ) with the same gap value @xmath79 as in pure crystal .",
    "this justifies anderson s theorem @xcite within t - matrix approximation for an s - wave sc with point - like impurity perturbations .",
    "however , even if there is no in - gap poles in the single - impurity t - matrix term , they can appear in the following terms of ge , that would describe localized states on impurity clusters @xcite .",
    "thus , the pair contribution : @xmath80\\times\\nonumber \\\\   &   & \\times\\left[1-\\left(\\widehat{a}_{0,\\mathbf{n}}^{0}\\right)^{2}\\right]^{-1}\\widehat{g}_{\\mathbf{k}}^{0}\\widehat{\\tau}_{3},\\label{eq:16}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] should only follow from the poles of @xmath81^{-1}$ ] , since the matrix @xmath82 is real at @xmath83 @xmath84 .    in fact ,",
    "the long distance asymptotics of this matrix ( at @xmath85 ) is:@xmath86 where @xmath87 and the particular forms for the scalar `` envelop '' function @xmath88 and the phase shift @xmath89 depend on the system dimensionality:@xmath90 for 2d , and@xmath91 for 3d , with the energy dependent decay length @xmath92 .",
    "the following analysis is essentially simplified , introducing matrices of the structure:@xmath93 which form a closed algebra with the product rule for the @xmath94 components:@xmath95 in this notation , the interaction matrices , eq . [ eq:17 ] , are presented as@xmath96 and then eq . [ eq:19 ] implies an important formula for their arbitrary product:@xmath97 this formula permits to reduce an arbitrary polynomial of @xmath66 matrices to a single @xmath98-matrix whose arguments are polynomials of @xmath99 functions .",
    "the next important property of @xmath98-matrices is that the determinant:@xmath100=\\left(1-a\\right)^{2}+b^{2}\\label{eq:20}\\ ] ] can be zero only if the components are @xmath101 and @xmath102 simultaneously .",
    "the above developed techniques permit to quantify the effects of impurity clusters in quasiparticle spectrum .",
    "thus , we conclude that the necessary condition for the pair contribution , eq .",
    "[ eq:16 ] : @xmath103=\\nonumber \\\\   &   & = \\det\\left[1-\\widehat{m}\\left(\\mathcal{f}_{0,\\mathbf{n}}^{2}\\cos2\\varphi_{\\mathbf{n}},\\mathcal{f}_{0,\\mathbf{n}}^{2}\\sin2\\varphi_{\\mathbf{n}}\\right)\\right]=0\\label{eq:21}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is only possible if @xmath104 , @xmath105 , and @xmath106 .",
    "but , taking into account the exponential factor @xmath107 in eqs .",
    "[ eq:17a],[eq:17b ] , this requires that:@xmath108 for 2d , or @xmath109 for 3d , which can not be fulfilled at any @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "hence there is no contribution to dos within the s - wave gap from impurity pairs ( @xmath112 ) , the same as from the single - impurity t - matrix , eq .",
    "[ eq:15 ] .",
    "but for the next , triple term of ge , which contains the inverse of the matrix ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite):@xmath113 the conditions by eq .",
    "[ eq:20 ] turn already realizable .",
    "they are explicitly formulated as follows:@xmath114 and @xmath115 the easiest localization of quasiparticles of course is expected at the very edge of the gap : @xmath116 , where @xmath117 .",
    "then , e.g. , for @xmath118 it is achieved with @xmath119 , as shown in fig . 1 , and it can be also reached for close values of @xmath110 by small adjustments of the distances .    once such a pole exists , we can introduce in the configuration space of triangles @xmath120 , in the vicinity of this pole , the effective variables:@xmath121 and a certain @xmath122 , independent of @xmath123 , arriving at the general form for @xmath124 as an integral@xmath125 here the function@xmath126 contains the @xmath98-algebra coefficients @xmath127 related to a certain matrix numerator in the triple ge term ( see its explicit form in ref .",
    "@xcite ) and the jacobian @xmath128 of transition from @xmath129 to the effective variables .",
    "apart from technical details of calculation , this contribution @xmath130 can be routinely obtained .",
    "it should be noted however that the above approach uses the asymptotical form , eq .",
    "[ eq:17 ] , of interaction functions , so it is only justified if the resulting poles , like that in fig .",
    "[ cap:1 ] , are related to long distances @xmath85 .",
    "this is easier achieved if @xmath131 for the host crystal , as is the case for htsc systems , but hardly for common s - wave superconductors . in the latter case",
    ", the finite in - gap dos should result more probably from high enough terms of ge .",
    "another important aspect is the analysis of convergency of matrix ge s , eqs .",
    "[ eq:11a ] , [ eq:13 ] , permitting to distinguish between band - like and localized spectrum areas in the non - uniform sc system .",
    "this can be realized , using the above estimates for the non - renormalized functions @xmath132 and @xmath133 as approximations for the renormalized ones @xmath66 and @xmath63 in the region of band - like states @xmath134 .",
    "a similar algebraic techniques can be also developed for the d - wave sc systems , related in that case to the impurity resonance states .",
    "in this situation , the higher dos corrections @xmath135 to non - zero @xmath136 within the gap can be not so pronounced as for the zero - background case of s - wave system .",
    "nevertheless the important criteria for ge convergence can be obtained , permitting a more consistent validation of t - matrix approximation and demarcation between band - like and localized states , compared to the recently suggested check based on the phenomenological ioffe - regel criterion @xcite .",
