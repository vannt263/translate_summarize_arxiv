    "the success of the rhic program has been based largely on its ability to deduce the properties of the dense medium using various energetic `` hard probes '' , including light quark jets ( @xmath0,@xmath1,@xmath2 ) , gluon jets , heavy quark jets ( @xmath3,@xmath4 ) and photons ( @xmath5 ) , which interact with different strength in the medium .",
    "the interaction of the colored probes , i.e. quarks and gluons , not only leads to the suppression of the probes themselves , it also seems to initiate a medium response that is tightly correlated with original jet direction , e.g. the `` ridge '' and the `` double hump '' phenomena observed in correlation analyses  @xcite .",
    "these experimental findings have inspired many theoretical approaches to understand the medium response to hard probes .",
    "these models include not only the more conventional tools such as hydrodynamical and cascade models , with input from lattice qcd and perturbative qcd energy loss  @xcite , but also more recent developments based on the ads / cft duality  @xcite .",
    "however , existing measurements of hard probes at rhic have not provided sufficient quantitative constraints on the detailed properties of the dense medium .",
    "most measurements are done with leading particle spectra or two particle correlation analyses , rather than a full jet reconstruction .",
    "they thus reflect a convolution of parton distribution functions , energy loss and fragmentation , such that detailed information on energy loss processes can not be extracted cleanly .",
    "furthermore , the mechanisms of medium responses are not well understood , in part due to experimental uncertainties associated with the signal extraction , and primarily due to the lack of clear theoretical constraints from these observables . finally , other hard probes , such as @xmath5-jet correlations , and heavy quark energy loss are limited by the low rate , large background and the lack of direct jet reconstruction .    the lhc , with its center of mass energy 27 times that of rhic , greatly increases the kinematic reach and the rates for jets , heavy flavor jets , and direct photons .",
    "these hard probes can be measured precisely using the large - acceptance , multi - purpose atlas detector .",
    "recently , extensive simulation studies have been performed , focusing on the following four areas as part of the atlas heavy ion physics program :    1 .",
    "`` day-1 '' measurements to probe bulk properties : multiplicity , collective flow , inclusive particle spectra ; 2 .",
    "jet and photon measurements to probe jet quenching and medium response : full jet reconstruction , fragmentation functions and jet profile , di - jet correlations , direct @xmath5 , @xmath5-jet correlations and heavy flavor jets ; 3 .",
    "upsilon and @xmath6 to probe debye screening ; 4 .",
    "low-@xmath7 physics at forward @xmath8 to probe the initial condition : jet , particle spectra , and particle and jet correlations at forward @xmath8 .",
    "of these four topics , jet measurements are a particular strength of the atlas heavy ion program .",
    "the atlas detector  @xcite has been demonstrated to perform excellent measurements of jets , photons , and muons even in a high - multiplicity heavy ion environment .",
    "the atlas detector has multiple layers of electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters covering @xmath9 in azimuth and @xmath10 .",
    "the segmentation of the calorimeters allows full jet reconstruction up to @xmath11 , and direct photon measurement up to @xmath12 .",
    "charged hadrons can be measured in @xmath12 with high efficiency , which can be used to construct jet fragmentation functions . by combining reconstructed tracks with muons",
    ", it is possible to tag heavy flavor jets in @xmath12 .",
    "this paper will thus focus on the capabilities of atlas in jet physics .",
    "[ sec : jet ] the standard jet reconstruction algorithms developed for @xmath13 and @xmath14 collisions need to be modified to account for the large underlying background in pb+pb collisions .",
    "this background needs to be properly estimated and subtracted before jet reconstruction , and any fake jets due to background fluctuations also need to be rejected .",
    "the following steps are used to evaluate the jet performance in pb+pb collisions .",
    "a sample of pythia di - jet events is embedded into a sample of central hijing pb+pb events , which are used to model the expected underlying background .",
    "a @xmath15 gev@xmath16 cut is required for the hijing pb+pb events to suppress hard - scattering processes .",
    "the merged events are then run through a geant4 simulation of the atlas detector and digitized into raw data format , which is subsequently analyzed with the software used for real data .",
    "an @xmath8 and @xmath17 dependent average underlying background is calculated from the merged event , excluding cones around jet seeds , and subtracted from the calorimeter cells .",
    "finally , a seeded - cone jet algorithm with seed energy of 5 gev is run on the background subtracted event to reconstruct jets .",
    "it is found that the jet energy resolution in central pb+pb events ( @xmath18=2700 at mid - rapidity ) is 25% at 50 gev , 15% at 100 gev , and saturates at about 10% above 200 gev .",
    "this can be compared with @xmath14 collisions , for which the jet energy resolution is about 10% at 100 gev and saturates to 7% at large @xmath19 .",
    "interestingly , the energy resolution was found to be almost independent on the pseudo - rapidity in @xmath11 , thanks to the decrease in the background level in forward @xmath8 which almost compensates the worsening of the calorimeter segmentation .",
    "the position resolution of the jet is always better than 0.045 radians at @xmath20 gev even for the most central events .",
    "fake jets are rejected by cutting on @xmath21  @xcite , where the @xmath22 is the 2-d angle between the cell and jet axis .",
    "@xmath23 approximates the width of the jet cell energy , and it shrinks with jet energy for real jets but remains roughly constant for fake jets .",
    "fig.[fig:1](left ) shows the reconstructed jet yields in central pb+pb events , compared to the input distribution . the efficiency , which is around 50% around 70 gev and saturates to 100% above 100 gev , is governed mainly by the seed threshold ( 5 gev ) and the cut used to reject fake jets .",

    "in summary , the atlas detector provides unprecedented capability for probing the dense medium via jets , photons , and heavy quarks .",
    "detailed simulations have been carried out to estimate the physics performance for jets and direct photons .",
    "it is shown that jets can be reconstructed above 50 gev with reasonable resolution , low fake rate and high efficiency .",
    "jet spectra , jet fragmentation functions and jet shapes can be recovered within 20% of the input distribution before applying any corrections . using the highly segmented first layer of the atlas calorimeter , combined with isolation cuts ,",
    "we show that direct photons can be measured with a good s / b ratio up to 200 gev for a nominal lhc year . by tagging on high @xmath19 single muons",
    ", one can obtain a sample of high @xmath19 heavy quark jets .",
    "these capabilities are crucial for understanding the energy loss and medium response mechanisms , and should provide quantitative constraint on the properties of the hot and dense qcd matter .",
    "the large acceptance atlas detector also provides precision measurements of global event characteristics , such as impact parameter , number of participant , number of collisions and reaction plane .",
    "these global observables can be measured independently using various subsystems  @xcite , which help to minimize the systematic errors .",
    "they shall open up the possibility of a detailed study of the dependence of energy loss and medium response on collision geometry .",
