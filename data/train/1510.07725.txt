    "proteins and the nucleic acids , which include deoxyribonucleic acid ( dna ) and ribonucleic acid ( rna ) , are among the most essential biomolecules for all known forms of life . in cells , proteins have a wide variety of important functions , including supporting organism structure , catalyzing reactions involved in transcription and the cell cycle , participating in signal transduction , and working as immune agents .",
    "nucleic acids typically function in association with proteins and play a crucial role in encoding , transmitting and expressing genetic information .",
    "genetic information is stored through the nucleic acid sequence , i.e. , the order of nucleotides within a dna or rna molecule and transmitted via transcription and translation processes .",
    "protein rigidity , flexibility and electrostatics strongly correlate to protein structure and function@xcite .",
    "the impact of biomolecular electrostatics to their structure , function and dynamics has been a subject of intensive study",
    ". however the importance of biomolecular flexibility and rigidity to their structure and function has been overlooked . in general ,",
    "protein rigidity is responsible for protein three - dimensional ( 3d ) equilibrium geometric shapes and structural function in forms of tubulin , collagen , elastin , and keratin , while protein flexibility is an important factor in all other protein functions @xcite .",
    "dna flexibility is an important effect in dna packing .",
    "although the flexibility of biomolecules is often associated with their motion and dynamics , which are their response to the external stimuli and die out at the absolute zero temperature , flexibility is an intrinsic property .",
    "biomolecular flexibility and rigidity can be measured directly or indirectly by many experimental approaches , such as x - ray crystallography , nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) and single - molecule force experiments @xcite . in single - molecule force experiments , including optical tweezers and nanopore force spectroscopy , the intrinsic rupture rate can be a direct measure of the flexibility and rigidity . in the x - ray structure ,",
    "debye - waller factors , also known as b - factors or temperature factors , are computed as the uncertainty for each atom in the least square fitting of between the x - ray diffraction data and the theoretical model .",
    "debye - waller factors are interpreted as atomic mean - square - fluctuations at the given experimental temperature , and are associated with biomolecular flexibility and rigidity .",
    "nmr is known for its ability to analyze biomolecular flexibility and rigidity under physiological conditions , and at various timescales .",
    "the availability of experimental data makes the theoretical study of biomolecular flexibility and rigidity an interesting and important topic , in which quantitative models can be calibrated and validated .",
    "molecular dynamics ( md ) @xcite can be used to elucidate biomolecular collective motion and fluctuation .",
    "md is a powerful technique for the understanding of the conformational landscapes of biomolecules .",
    "however , biomolecular flexibility and rigidity are intrinsic properties that are better measured at the motionless and fluctuation free state . therefore , md is not efficient for biomolecular flexibility and rigidity analysis .",
    "alternative approaches including normal mode analysis ( nma ) @xcite , graph theory @xcite and elastic network model ( enm ) @xcite become the main workhorses for biomolecular flexibility and rigidity analysis during the past two decades .",
    "in analogy to the time - dependent and time - independent schrdinger s equations , these approaches are designed as time - independent counterparts of the corresponding md methods @xcite .",
    "consequently , a diagonalization of the interaction matrix or hamiltonian of a biomolecule is a required procedure to obtain biomolecular eigenmodes and associated eigenvalues , which are further organized to predict the biomolecular temperature factors .",
    "the low order eigenmodes computed from diagonalizing the kirchhoff matrix or the hessian matrix can be interpreted as the slow motions of the biomolecule around the equilibrium state and thus shed light on the long - time behavior of the biomolecular dynamics beyond the reach of md simulations @xcite .",
    "tirion argued that the potential in the nma can be simplified to retain only the harmonic potential for elasticity , which is the dominant term in the md hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "network theory @xcite has had considerable impact in flexibility analysis .",
    "the combination of elasticity and coarse - grained network gives rise to elastic network model ( enm ) @xcite .",
    "many other network based approaches , including gaussian network model ( gnm ) @xcite and anisotropic network model ( anm ) @xcite , have been developed for biomolecular flexibility analysis .    it has been demonstrated by yang et al .",
    "@xcite that gnm is about one order more efficient than most other flexibility approaches .",
    "gnm is also typically more accurate than anm in b - factor prediction @xcite .",
    "applications have been demonstrated in stability @xcite analysis , docking simulation @xcite , viral capsids @xcite and domain motions of hemoglobin @xcite , f1 atpase @xcite , chaperonin groel @xcite and the ribosome @xcite .",
    "more details can be found in a few recent reviews @xcite .",
    "a common feature of the above mentioned time - independent methods is that they resort to the matrix diagonalization procedure .",
    "the computational complexity of the matrix diagonalization is typically of the order of @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the number of elements in the matrix .",
    "such a computational complexity calls for new efficient strategies for the flexibility analysis of large biomolecules .",
    "it is well known that nma and gnm offer poor flexibility analysis for many macromolecules @xcite .",
    "park et al . had studied the performance of nma and gnm methods for three sets of structures @xcite .",
    "they found that both methods fail to work and deliver negative correlation coefficients ( ccs ) for many structures @xcite .",
    "they have shown that mean correlation coefficients ( mccs ) for the nma b - factor prediction of small - sized , medium - sized and large - sized sets of structures are about 0.480 , 0.482 and 0.494 , respectively @xcite .",
    "the gnm is considerably more accurate and delivers mccs of 0.541 , 0.550 and 0.529 for the above test sets @xcite .",
    "indeed , various improvements , including crystal environment , solvent type and co - factors , are proposed @xcite .",
    "additionally , density - cluster rotational - translational blocking has been considered @xcite .",
    "alternative approaches have been proposed for the flexibility analysis of hinges in proteins using bioinformatics @xcite , graph theory @xcite and energetics @xcite .",
    "moreover , low quality experimental data due to collection conditions and structural refinement procedures may also contribute to poor flexibility predictions .",
    "from observation of the relationship between flexibility and local packing density , halle @xcite proposed a much simplified model called local density model ( ldm ) , and bypassed the whole eigenmode analysis for protein b - factor prediction . in this method ,",
    "the inverse of contact density , defined as the number of noncovalent neighbor atoms within a local region , is found to be proportional to atomic mean - square displacements , thus can be directly used to predict the experimental b - factors .",
    "another interesting method is the local contact model ( lcm ) proposed by zhang et al @xcite . in this approach ,",
    "the generalized order parameter of the atom is approximated by the summation of a series of exponential functions of atomic distances .",
    "both ldm and lcm demonstrate great potential for protein flexibility prediction .",
    "based on these approaches , many modifications have been proposed in the literature @xcite . among them ,",
    "the weighted contact number ( wcn ) is able to deliver a better accuracy than gnm using an inverse square distance function @xcite .",
    "recently , we have proposed a few matrix - decomposition - free methods for flexibility analysis , including molecular nonlinear dynamics @xcite , stochastic dynamics @xcite and flexibility - rigidity index ( fri ) @xcite . among them , flexibility - rigidity index ( fri ) has been introduced to evaluate protein flexibility and rigidity , that are further required in a multiscale formalism called continuum elasticity with atomic rigidity ( cewar ) for macromolecular the elasticity analysis @xcite .",
    "the fri method appears to be akin to the `` flexibility index '' proposed independently by von der lieth et al .",
    "@xcite and jacobs et al .",
    "@xcite to describe bond strengths",
    ". however , these flexibility indices have little in common with fri , which does not resort to any protein interaction hamiltonian for predicting protein flexibility and rigidity . instead , the fri is a structure based approach .",
    "the fundamental assumptions of the fri method are as follows .",
    "protein functions , such as flexibility , rigidity , and energy , are fully determined by the structure of the protein and its environment , and the protein structure is in turn determined by the relevant interactions .",
    "therefore , whenever the protein structure is available , there is no need to analyze protein flexibility and rigidity by tracing back to the protein interaction hamiltonian .",
    "consequently , the fri bypasses the @xmath1 matrix diagonalization .",
    "in fact , fri does not even require the 3d geometric information of the protein structure .",
    "it assesses topological connectivity of the protein distance geometry and analyzes the geometric compactness of the protein structure .",
    "it can be regarded as a kernel generalization of the local density model @xcite .",
    "our initial fri @xcite has the computational complexity of of @xmath3 and our fast fri ( ffri ) @xcite based on a cell lists algorithm @xcite is of @xmath0 .",
    "the fri and the ffri have been extensively validated by a set of 365 proteins for parametrization , accuracy and reliability .",
    "the parameter free ffri is about ten percent more accurate than the gnm on the 365 protein test set and is orders of magnitude faster than gnm on a set of 44 proteins .",
    "fri is able to predict the b - factors of an hiv virus capsid ( 313 236 residues ) in less than 30 seconds on a single - core processor , which would require gnm more than 120 years to accomplish if the computer memory is not a problem @xcite .",
    "however , earlier fri methods do not work for many protein structures that nma and gnm are unable to deliver good predictions .",
    "in addition to problems mentioned above , the neglecting of multiple characteristic length scales in protein structures is another drawback of present flexibility analysis .",
    "indeed , biomolecules have many characteristic length scales , ranging from covalent bond scale , hydrogen bond scale , wan der waals bond scale , intraresidue scale , interresidue scale , alpha helix and beta sheet scale , domain scale and protein interaction scale .",
    "when gnm or fri is parametrized at a given cutoff or scale parameter , it captures only a subset of the characteristic length scales but inevitably misses other characteristic length scales of the protein .",
    "consequently , these methods fail to offer accurate b - factor prediction for many multiscale biomolecules .",
    "a multiscale strategy has been proposed to resolve this problem by introducing two or three kernels that are parametrized at relatively small , medium and/or large length scales in the fri formulation @xcite .",
    "we demonstrate that the resulting multiscale fri ( mfri ) works extremely well for many proteins that the gnm method fails to offer accurate flexibility analysis @xcite . based on a set of 364 proteins , mfri is 20% more accurate than gnm .",
    "it is interesting to note that there is no obvious way to incorporate multiple length scales in the aforementioned matrix diagonalization based approaches .",
    "although being developed independently , our fri methods are akin to ldm , lcm and wcn in terms of matrix diagonalization free .",
    "however , our fri methods differ from ldm , lcm and wcn in the following aspects .",
    "first , our original fri methods were motivated from continuum mechanics , the cewar @xcite . as a result ,",
    "our fri methods offer not only discrete flexibility index and discrete rigidity index , but also continuous flexibility function and continuous rigidity function .",
    "the latter is equivalent to volumetric biomolecular density distribution .",
    "consequently , one can use the fri rigidity function to fit electron microscope ( em ) density maps @xcite .",
    "a byproduct of our fri rigidity function is the smooth biomolecular surface extracted by setting an isosurface value , including the gaussian surface as a special case @xcite .",
    "in contrast , ldm , lcd and wcn do not admit any continuum representation . additionally , the discrete fri formulations differ from those of ldm , lcd and wcn by admitting the diagonal term in the summation .",
    "moreover , we have considered the multiscale effects in biomolecules .",
    "our mfri captures biomolcular thermal fluctuations at various length scales and thus substantially improves the accuracy of the original fri method .",
    "finally , we have proposed an anisotropic fri ( afri ) method to describe biomolecular collective motions .",
    "a unique feature of our afri method is that it allows adaptive hessian matrices , from a completely global @xmath4 matrix to completely local @xmath5 matrices .",
    "therefore , one can use afri to pinpoint one s flexibility analysis to a given domain or region .",
    "the objective of the present work is to develop fri methods for the flexibility analysis of protein - nucleic acid complexes .",
    "protein and nucleic acid are dramatically different biomolecules .",
    "amino acid residues and nucleotides have different length scales and interaction characteristics .",
    "therefore , a good model should not only allow residues and/or nucleotides to be treated with different length scales , but also adapt a multiscale description of each residue and/or nucleotide .",
    "unlike elastic network models that are parametrized in only one length scale for each particle , the mfri provides a simultaneous multiscale description .",
    "therefore , the present mfri is able to better capture multiscale collective motions of protein - nucleic acid complexes . additionally , many protein - nucleic acid complexes are very large biomolecules and pose difficulty to conventional mode decomposition based methods . the @xmath0 scaling",
    "fri methods provide an efficient approach to the flexibility analysis of large protein - nucleic acid complexes .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : methods ] is devoted to methods and algorithms . to establish notation and facilitate further discussion ,",
    "the basic fri approach is briefly discussed .",
    "we then present the multikernel based mfri method to improve the accuracy of biomolecular flexibility analysis .",
    "the basic formulation of the afri is discussed . in section [ sec : validation ] , we first analyze the benefit of adding an additional kernel with an appropriate length scale by comparing the performance of the b - factor prediction for a set of 64 protein - nucleic acid complexes introduced by yang et al .",
    "@xcite and a larger database of 203 high resolution protein - nucleic acid structures .",
    "three different coarse - grain representations of protein - nucleic acid complexes introduced by yang et al @xcite are examined .",
    "section [ sec : casestudy ] is devoted to the application of the mfri and afri methods .",
    "we consider a large ribosomeal structure to explore the utility and demonstrate the performance of the proposed mfri .",
    "further , we explore the use of afri for the prediction of collective motions of bridge helix , trigger loop and nucleic acids in an rna polymerase .",
    "in fri , the topological connectivity of a biomolecule is measured by rigidity index and flexibility index .",
    "in particular , the rigidity index represents the protein density profile .",
    "consider an @xmath2-atom representation of a biomolecule .",
    "the coordinates of these atoms are given as @xmath6 .",
    "we denote @xmath7 the euclidean space distance between the @xmath8th atom and the @xmath9th atom .",
    "a general correlation kernel , @xmath10 , is a real - valued monotonically decreasing radial basis function satisfying @xmath11 where @xmath12 is an atomic type dependent scale parameter .",
    "the correlation between the @xmath8th and @xmath9th particles is given by @xmath13 the correlation matrix @xmath14 can be computed to visualize the connectivity among protein particles .",
    "we define a position ( @xmath15 ) dependent ( continuous ) rigidity function or density function @xcite @xmath16 where @xmath17 is an atom type dependent weight . for example",
    ", carbon , nitrogen and phosphorus atoms can have different weights .",
    "equation ( [ eq : rigidity3 ] ) can be understood as a discrete to continuum mapping .",
    "it maps a set of discrete values @xmath18 at @xmath19 to the continuum domain .",
    "although delta sequences of the positive type discussed in an earlier work @xcite are all good choices , generalized exponential functions @xmath20 and generalized lorentz functions @xmath21 have been commonly used in our recent work @xcite .",
    "since the rigidity function can be directly interpreted as a density distribution , it can been used to define the rigidity surface of a biomolecule by taking an isovalue . by taking @xmath22 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : couple_matrix1 ] ) , we result in a formula for a gaussian surface from eq .",
    "( [ eq : rigidity3 ] ) .",
    "similarly , we define a position ( @xmath15 ) dependent ( continuous ) flexibility function @xcite @xmath23 this function is well defined in the computational domain containing the biomolecule .",
    "the flexibility function can be visualized by its projection on a given surface , such as the solvent excluded surface of a biomolecule .",
    "the ( discrete ) rigidity index for the @xmath8th particle is obtained by restricting @xmath15 to a given atomic position @xmath24 @xmath25 here @xmath26 measures the total density or rigidity at the @xmath8th particle . in a similar manner",
    ", we define a set of ( discrete ) flexibility indices by @xmath27 the flexibility index @xmath28 is directly associated with the b - factor of @xmath8th particle @xmath29 where @xmath30 are theoretically predicted b - factors , and @xmath31 and @xmath32 are two constants to be determined by a simple linear regression .",
    "this allows us to use experimental data to validate the fri method . in our earlier work @xcite , we set @xmath33 for the coarse - grained c@xmath34 representation of proteins .",
    "we have also developed parameter free fri ( pffri ) , such as @xmath35 and @xmath36 , to make our fri robust for protein c@xmath34 b - factor prediction .",
    "the basic idea of multiscale fri or multi - kernel fri ( mfri ) is quite simple .",
    "since macromolecules are inherently multiscale in nature , we utilize multiple kernels that are parametrized at multiple length scales to characterize the multiscale thermal fluctuations of macromolecules @xmath37 where @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the corresponding quantities associated with the @xmath41th kernel .",
    "we seek the minimization of the form @xmath42 where @xmath43 are the experimental b - factors . in principle",
    ", all parameters can be optimized . for simplicity and computational efficiency , we only determine @xmath44 and @xmath32 in the above minimization process . for each kernel @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 will be selected according to the type of particles .",
    "specifically , for a simple c@xmath34 network , we can set @xmath48 , @xmath49 and choose a single kernel function parametrized at different scales .",
    "the predicted b - factors can be expressed as @xmath50 the difference between eqs .",
    "( [ eq : flexibility3 ] ) and ( [ eq : flexibility4 ] ) is that , in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : flexibility3 ] ) , both the kernel and the scale can be changed for different @xmath41 .",
    "in contrast , in eq .",
    "( [ eq : flexibility4 ] ) , only the scale is changed .",
    "one can use a given kernel , such as @xmath51 to achieve good multiscale predictions @xcite .      the anisotropic flexibility - rigidity index ( afri )",
    "model was built in a very unique manner .",
    "different from the existing normal mode analysis or anisotropic elastic network models , in which the hessian matrix is always global , our afri model delivers a local and adaptive hessian matrix .",
    "this means that for a molecule with @xmath2 particles , the hessian matrix is always @xmath4 for anm , whereas , our hessian matrix may vary from a set of @xmath2 @xmath52 matrices for a completely local afri to @xmath4 for a complete global afri , depending on the need of a physical problem .",
    "for instance , if one is particularly interested in certain structures like alpha helices , domains , or binding sites of a protein , or certain subunits of a biomolecular complex , one design and an afri for these portions of the molecule .",
    "we partition all the @xmath2 particles in a molecule or a biomolecular complex into a total of @xmath53 clusters @xmath54 .",
    "cluster @xmath55 has @xmath56 particles or atoms so that @xmath57 .",
    "we choose clusters based on our physical interest as mentioned above . in this way",
    ", two very special situations can be found .",
    "the first one corresponds to the completely local situation , i.e. , @xmath2 clusters and each cluster has only one atom .",
    "the other situation contains only one cluster , which is then completely global .",
    "it is straightforward to construct a @xmath4 hessian matrix and analyze the collective motion .",
    "the problem arises when we consider the global motion of a selected cluster , at the same time include the influence from the rest clusters .",
    "the essential idea is to construct a cluster hessian matrix for each cluster individually and then incorporate the information from nearby clusters into its diagonal terms .    for example , if we want to know the thermal fluctuation of a particular cluster @xmath55 with @xmath58 particles or atoms , we need to find @xmath59 eigenvectors for the cluster .",
    "let us keep in mind that each position vector in @xmath60 has three components , i.e. , @xmath61 .",
    "for each given pair of particles @xmath8 and @xmath9 , we can define a local anisotropic matrix @xmath62 as @xmath63 where @xmath64 are defined as @xmath65    due to the inner connection between rigidity and flexibility , we have two different afri algorithms",
    ". the specially designed cluster hessian matrix with a smaller size can incorporate nonlocal geometric impact and predict collective thermal motions of the cluster .",
    "the details are presented below .      in anisotropic rigidity",
    "based afri , a rigidity hessian matrix is needed . for a cluster @xmath55 , if we denote its rigidity hessian matrix as @xmath66 with elements , @xmath67 in this way ,",
    "the rigidity hessian matrix is of @xmath68 dimensions .",
    "more importantly , the information from all other clusters are built into diagonal terms , even if the cluster itself is completely localized , i.e. , @xmath69 .    for b - factor prediction",

    "in this section we briefly explore the applications of the mfri and afri methods to large protein - nucleic acid complexes .",
    "we highlight a few particular examples where mfri improves upon previous fri methods , in particular , for the flexibility prediction of ribosomes .",
    "further , we show how afri is well suited for the study of the dynamics of large macromolecular complexes using the bacterial rna polymerase active site as an example .",
    "some of the largest and most biologically important structures that contain both protein and nucleic acids are ribosomes .",
    "ribosomes are the protein synthesizers of the cell and connect amino acid into polymer chains",
    ". in ribosomes , proteins and rna interact through intermolecular effects , such as electrostatic interactions , hydrogen bonding , hydrophobic interactions , base stacking and base pairing .",
    "rna tertiary structures can significantly influence protein - rna interactions .",
    "ribosomes are primarily composed of rna with many smaller associated proteins as shown in fig .",
    "[ ribosome3 ] .",
    "the top of fig .",
    "[ ribosome3 ] shows the 50s subunit of the ribosome ( pdb i d : 1yij ) with the nucleic acids in a smooth surface representation with the protein subunits bound and shown in a secondary structure representation .",
    "the set of 64 structures used in our tests contains a number of ribosomal subunits . due to their multiscale nature",
    ", these structures also happen to be among those that benefit the most from using multikernel fri over single kernel fri or gnm .",
    "for example , in the case of ribosome 50s subunit structure ( pdb id:1yij ) , b - factor prediction with three - kernel fri yields a cc value of 0.85 , while that of single kernel fri is only around 0.3 .",
    "gnm does not provide a good b - factor prediction for this structure either .",
    "the three - kernel mfri model we used is one exponential kernel ( @xmath74 and @xmath75  ) and two lorentz kernels ( @xmath76 , @xmath77    and @xmath76 , @xmath78 ) .",
    "the comparison between mfri - predicted and experimental b - factors for ribosome 50s subunit structure is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ ribosome3 ] .    by using the fitting coefficients from the above 50s subunit ( 1yij ) flexibility analysis ,",
    "we have obtained flexibility predictions for the entire ribosome ( pdb id:4v4j ) as well as many protein subunits and other rnas that associate with it , see fig .",
    "[ ribosome3 ] . to avoid confusion ,",
    "the b - factors for 4v4j are uniquely determined by using not only the same three - kernel mfri model from the case 1yij , and also its fitting parameters , i.e. , @xmath79 and @xmath32 .",
    "again , the fri values are mapped by color to the smooth surface of the nucleic acids , however , in these bottom figures the protein subunits are omitted to draw attention instead to the various types of rna involved in this structure .",
    "rna polymerase is one of the essential enzymes for all life on earth as we know it today and possibly from the very beginning of life @xcite . despite this importance , the mechanisms for many of the polymerase s functions are still not well understood on the atomic level .",
    "considerable effort has been spent both experimentally and computationally to understand rnap polymerase function in more detail but many questions remain .",
    "the study of rna polymerase experimentally or computationally is difficult and often expensive due to the size of the system and variety of molecules involved .",
    "the minimal required elements for a bacterial or eukaryotic rna polymerase include multiple protein subunits , a double stranded dna molecule , a single stranded rna molecule , free nucleotides , various ions ( mg@xmath80 , zn@xmath80 , na@xmath81 etc . ) and solvent .",
    "a typical setup for this system in all - atom molecular dynamics includes  300,000 atoms when solvated . with this number of atoms and current computer power , it is often not feasible to simulate these molecules on biologically relevant timescales using md .",
    "perhaps the most popular tool for studying long time dynamics of biomolecules is normal mode analysis ( nma ) and its related methods such as the anisotropic network model ( anm ) .",
    "these methods have been successfully used to study protein dynamics for many proteins , however , at their maximum accuracy , their computational complexity is of @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the number of atoms .",
    "this is a problem because many cellular functions involve a large number of macromolecules with many thousands to millions of residues to consider .",
    "therefore , future computational studies of biomolecules beyond the protein scale will require methods with better scaling properties such as fri and afri .",
    "in this example , we use completely local anisotropic fri to examine correlated motions in regions near the active site of bacterial rna polymerase , including the bridge helix , trigger loop and nucleic acid chains .",
    "we examine the relationship between these components motions and their contributions to critical functions such as catalysis and translocation .",
    "we use the anisotropic rigidity form in sec .",
    "[ sec : arfri ] with the lorentz kernel ( @xmath82 and @xmath77  ) .",
    "figure [ rnap_flex]a is a simplified representation of rna polymerase ( pdb i d 2ppb ) that shows these important features which are buried in the core of the largest protein subunits , @xmath83 and @xmath84 . the bridge helix and trigger loop , shown in green and blue respectively , are parts of the protein that have been implicated in most of the essential functions of the polymerase .",
    "mutational studies of these regions result in modulation of the polymerase speed and accuracy , both positively and negatively , indicating the regions are important for normal functioning of the enzyme . how these regions aid these functions and how they interact remains an open question . with this demonstration of local afri analysis",
    "we hope to shed some light on how these essential parts of rna polymerase work together .",
    "local afri , as described in earlier work , is much less computationally costly than global afri or nma and has been shown to have qualitatively similar results for small to large size single proteins . to further validate the local afri method we compare the conclusions from a local afri study of rnap to those of nma based studies .",
    "the rna polymerase elongation complex is a relatively large system but it is still tenable for nma methods .",
    "nma has been applied to both bacterial and eukaryotic rna polymerase in the past @xcite which provides us with a point of comparison for our results .",
    "local afri produces three modes of motion sorted from lowest to highest frequency vibration according to eigenvalue as in nma . in figure [ rnap_flex ]",
    "we present findings from the lowest frequency mode effectively focusing on the most dominant motion of each conformation .",
    "two major conformations of rna polymerase are considered , those with open and closed trigger loop regions ( figures [ rnap_flex]c and [ rnap_flex]d . )",
    "a closed trigger loop is one that is completely folded into two parallel alpha helices while an open trigger loop has a region of disordered loop between two shorter helices and is slightly bent away from the bridge helix .",
    "the closing or folding of the trigger loop into the closed conformation is assumed to follow binding of an ntp in the active site and to precede catalysis .",
    "after catalysis , it is suspected that the trigger loop opens or unfolds to facilitate translocation and permit new ntps to enter the active site .",
    "the results of afri analysis on the effect of trigger loop closing reveal a distinct change in correlated motions in open and closed trigger loop conformations .",
    "these changes involve interactions between the bridge helix , the trigger loop and the nucleic acid regions . in figure [ rnap_flex]b ,",
    "regions of high correlation are color coded which reveals that the bridge helix is composed of two highly self correlated portions suggesting the presence of a hinge in the bridge helix .",
    "in fact , the central portion of the bridge helix has been observed as a kinked or bent helix in a yeast rnap structure@xcite .",
    "additionally , it is observed that a portion of the bridge helix and the n - terminal helix of the trigger loop are highly correlated in the closed trigger loop structure only .",
    "this set of two helices is situated directly next to the active site and could provide stability to aid catalysis after trigger loop closing .    additionally , correlation between nucleic acids and protein shows marked differences from the open trigger loop to closed trigger loop structures .",
    "the motions indicated in figures [ rnap_flex]c and [ rnap_flex]d show that the open trigger loop structure is primed to translocate based on the direction of highly correlated motions of the upstream and downstream nucleic acids . by contrast ,",
    "the closed trigger loop nucleic acid motions are considerably less correlated and not in the direction of translocation .",
    "this is the expected relationship as it matches the results from previous biological and nma studies of rna polymerase .",
    "@xcite    these differences between a closed trigger loop and open trigger loop structure reveal potentially important structural changes that arise as the rna polymerase switches between open and closed trigger loop conformations during the transition between translocation and catalysis . specifically , the results for the closed trigger loop conformation suggest the presence of a stabilized catalytic area which is made of the n - terminal helix of the trigger loop and the bridge helix .",
    "the results for the open trigger loop conformation show no such coordination of the active site helices and instead indicates a less defined hinge and coordinated motion in the direction of translocation .",
    "taken together these results provide a potential explanation for how trigger loop opening and closing is correlated with translocation and catalysis respectively .",
    "protein - nucleic acid complexes are essential to all living organisms .",
    "the function of these complexes depends crucially on their flexibility , an intrinsic property of a macromolecule .",
    "however , for many large protein - nucleic acid complexes , such as ribosomes and rna polymerases , the present flexibility analysis approaches can be problematic due to their computational complexity scaling of @xmath1 and neglecting multiscale effects .",
    "this work introduces the flexibility - rigidity index ( fri ) methods @xcite for the flexibility analysis of protein - nucleic acid structures .",
    "we show that a multiscale fri ( mfri ) realized by multiple kernels parametrized at multiple length scales is able to significantly outperform the gaussian network model ( gnm ) for the b - factor prediction of a set of 64 protein - nucleic acid complexes @xcite .",
    "the fri methods are not only accurate , but also efficient , as their computational complexity scales as @xmath0 .",
    "additionally , anisotropic fri ( afri ) , which has cluster hessian matrices , offers collective motion analysis for any given cluster , i.e , subunit or domain in a biomolecular complex .",
    "we apply fri methods to a large ribosomal subunit ( 1yij ) with multiple subunits .",
    "we note that both original single - scale fri and gnm do not work well for this structure .",
    "it is found that that the multiscale strategy is crucial for the flexibility analysis of multi - subunit structures .",
    "the correlation coefficients between fri predictions and experimental b - factors for 1yij improve from 0.3 for single - scale fri to 0.85 for multiscale fri .",
    "we further use the fitting coefficients obtained from 1yij to predict the flexibility of a entire ribosome , 4v4j .",
    "we found that mfri has an advantage for analyzing large biomolecular complexes due to both higher speeds and accuracy .",
    "we have also demonstrated the utility of the anisotropic fri ( afri ) for analyzing the translocation of an rna polymerase , which involves protein , dna , rna , nucleotide substrates and various ions .",
    "both experimental and computational studies of rna polymerases are difficult and expensive due to the size and complexity of the biomolecular complex .",
    "the molecular mechanism of rna polymerase translocation is an interesting , open research topic .",
    "the present work makes use of localized afri to elucidate the synergistic local motions of a bacterial rna polymerase .",
    "our findings are consistent with those from much more expensive molecular dynamics simulations and normal mode analysis @xcite .",
    "the study of hinges has been an important topic and much research has been done in the past @xcite .",
    "identification of hinge residues is useful for inferring motion and function when molecules are too large for md simulation on relevant timescales .",
    "other methods , such as gnm and nma have been utilized .",
