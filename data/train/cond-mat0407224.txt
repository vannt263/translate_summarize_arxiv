    "in recent years asymmetric simple exclusion processes ( aseps ) have become an important tool of investigation for many processes in chemistry , physics and biology @xcite .",
    "aseps have been applied successfully to understand the kinetics of biopolymerization @xcite , polymer dynamics in dense medium @xcite , diffusion through membrane channels @xcite , gel electrophoresis @xcite , dynamics of motor proteins moving along rigid filaments @xcite , and the kinetics of synthesis of proteins @xcite .",
    "aseps are one - dimensional lattice models where particles interact only with hard - core exclusion potential",
    ". each lattice site can be occupied by a particle or it can be empty . in the simplest totally asymmetric simple exclusion process ( tasep ) , where the particles can only move in one direction , the dynamic rules are the following .",
    "the particle at site @xmath0 can jump forward to the site @xmath1 with the rate 1 if the target site is empty .",
    "the particle can enter the lattice with the rate @xmath2 , provided the first site is unoccupied , and it can also leave the system with the rate @xmath3 .",
    "although these dynamic rules are very simple , they lead to a very rich and complex dynamic phase behavior .",
    "there are non - equilibrium phase transitions between the stationary states of the system , induced by boundary processes , that have no analogs in equilibrium systems @xcite .",
    "the coupling of aseps with different equilibrium and non - equilibrium processes have led to many unusual and unexpected phenomena .",
    "an introduction of a single irreversible detachment process to the bulk of the system have resulted in significant changes in phase diagram @xcite .",
    "the coupling of aseps with equilibrium langmuir kinetics at each site produced unusual phenomena of localized density shocks @xcite .",
    "however , the complexity of phase transitions in aseps can be reasonable well explained and understood by applying a phenomenological domain - wall theory @xcite .",
    "most investigations of aseps concentrate on one - channel systems where particles can only move along one lattice chain . however , the description of many real phenomena would be more adequate if parallel - chain asymmetric exclusion processes are used .",
    "for example , motor proteins kinesins can move along the parallel protofilaments of microtubules , and there are no restrictions for them to jump between these protofilaments @xcite .",
    "parallel - chains aseps have been considered earlier @xcite . however , in these investigations the coupling between different chains was indirect , i.e. , hopping between the chains was forbidden .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to investigate two - chain asymmetric exclusion processes , where particles can move between the lattice channels .",
    "we investigate this system by using a simple approximate model for intermediate couplings and by mapping it to the exactly solved one - channel tasep in the limits of strong coupling and no coupling .",
    "in addition , extensive computer monte carlo simulations are performed in order to validate theoretical predictions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we give a detailed description of the model , discuss known results for one - channel aseps , solve exactly the stationary state properties of the system in the limit of strong coupling , and develop an approximate theory for two - channel asymmetric exclusion processes for intermediate couplings .",
    "then in section 3 we present and discuss monte carlo simulations results .",
    "finally , we summarize and conclude in section 4 .",
    "we consider identical particles moving on two parallel one - dimensional lattices , each lattice has @xmath4 sites , as shown in fig .",
    "every site on both lattices can be either empty or it can be occupied by no more than one particle . in the bulk of the system",
    "the dynamic rules are the following .",
    "a particle at site @xmath0 can hop up or down to the same site @xmath0 on the other lattice chain with the rate @xmath5 , if that site is empty .",
    "the particle can also move from left to right along the same lattice to site @xmath1 , if this site is available .",
    "however , this transition rate depends on occupation of site @xmath0 at neighboring channel . if there is no particle at that site , the rate is equal to @xmath6 , otherwise the particle jumps with the rate 1 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "it means that the full transition rate of leaving site @xmath0 , to go forward or up / down , is always equal to 1 .",
    "particles can also enter the system with the rate @xmath2 if any of the first sites in either channel are empty .",
    "when a particle reaches site @xmath4 , it can exit with the rate @xmath3 , when both last sites are occupied , or with the rate @xmath7 if there is no vertical neighbor at the other lattice chain .    .",
    "the transition rates to move along the channel are @xmath6 , if there is no particle at the same site in another channel , otherwise it is equal to 1 .",
    "entrance and exit rates are @xmath2 and @xmath3 ( or @xmath7 if the last cluster is half - empty ) , respectively , and are the same in both channels . ]    when a vertical transition rate @xmath8 , we have two uncoupled single - channel totally asymmetric simple exclusion processes for which an exact description of phase diagram , density profiles and particle currents is known @xcite . in this case",
    "there are three steady - state phases , determined by the processes at the boundaries or in the bulk of the system . for @xmath9 and @xmath10 ,",
    "the particle dynamics is specified by the processes in the bulk of the system , and we have a maximal - current phase with the following stationary current and bulk density , @xmath11 the entrance into the system determines the overall particle dynamics for @xmath12 and @xmath13 . in this case",
    "the system can be found in a low - density phase with the current and bulk density given by @xmath14 when the exit from the system limits the overall dynamics , which takes place for @xmath15 and @xmath16 , the system exists in a high - density phase . in this case the current and bulk densities are equal to @xmath17    for vertical transition rates @xmath18 , the particle dynamics in both channels depend on each other , and any successful theoretical description should be able to account for this coupling .",
    "let us consider a cluster of two vertical sites @xmath0 .",
    "there are four possible states for this cluster , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2].@xmath19 is defined as a probability to find a cluster with both lattice sites occupied .",
    "then @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the probabilities that only lower or upper channel site is occupied ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "finally , @xmath22 is a probability that both sites in the cluster are empty .",
    "the normalization condition for these probabilities gives us @xmath23    in the bulk of the system at stationary state , it is reasonable to expect that these probabilities are independent of the position of the vertical cluster due to translational symmetry . in what follows ,",
    "we omit the superscript @xmath0 for bulk values of these probabilities since only steady - state processes will be considered .",
    "also , because both channels are equivalent , we expect that @xmath24 .",
    "then the bulk density at each lattice chain , which is also independent of the position on the lattice in stationary state limit , is given by @xmath25 thus the overall dynamics of the system can be fully described in terms of these probabilities .",
    ", @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the corresponding probabilities for each state . ]      in the limit of strong coupling ( @xmath29 ) , the dynamics of the system simplifies significantly , because at large times any vertical cluster can not exist in a configuration , where both sites are empty , i.e. , @xmath30 .",
    "this can be seen from the following arguments . a vertical cluster in state @xmath31",
    "could only be obtained by moving particle along the corresponding lattice chain if the previous state of the same cluster was @xmath32 or @xmath33 .",
    "however , the rate for this transition in the limit of strong coupling is equal to @xmath34 , and the configuration @xmath31 can never be reached for any vertical cluster .",
    "thus , in this system there are only two types of clusters : fully filled and half - filled .",
    "one can think of filled clusters as new effective `` particles '' and half - filled clusters then can be viewed as new effective `` holes . ''",
    "the two - channel tasep in this limit can be mapped into the one - channel totally asymmetric exclusion process with the effective entrance rate @xmath2 and the effective exit rate @xmath35 . in the bulk of the system",
    "an effective new particle jumps to the right with rate 1 , if this move is allowed .",
    "the factor 2 in the effective exit rate is due to the fact that there are two ways of leaving the system from the filled cluster at last site , namely , by moving particles from the upper or lower lattice channels .    the exact density profiles , particle currents and phase diagram for this effective one - channel tasep system are known @xcite , and it allows us to calculate exactly the properties of the original two - channel tasep in the limit of strong coupling .",
    "the steady - state particle current of the effective one - channel model @xmath36 is related to the particle current per channel @xmath37 of the original two - channel model in the following way , @xmath38 while using eq .",
    "[ density ] we obtain the corresponding relation for bulk density profiles in two - channel tasep , @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the effective density for one - channel asymmetric exclusion model .",
    "thus we conclude that there are 3 stationary - state phase for two - channel tasep in the limit of strong coupling .",
    "when @xmath41 and @xmath42 , the system can be found in the low - density phase with the following properties , @xmath43 the conditions @xmath44 and @xmath45 specify the high - density phase . in this case",
    "the steady - state properties are given by @xmath46 in the case when bulk dynamics is rate - limiting , we have the maximal - current phase with the following parameters , @xmath47      for intermediate couplings , @xmath48 , any vertical cluster can exist in all four possible states and we can not map the two - channel tasep into the effective one - channel model . some reasonable approximations are needed in order to calculate the steady - state properties of the system .",
    "assume that a state of a given vertical cluster is independent of states of its neighbors .",
    "it means that the cluster dynamics is considered in a mean - field description .",
    "then the probability of finding the cluster at the position @xmath0 with both sites occupied changes in time as given by @xmath49 where the first term corresponds to the probability density flux from sites @xmath50 , the second term describes the changes at both sites @xmath0 that lead to the formation of the cluster @xmath51 , and two negative terms represent the density flux leaving from sites @xmath0 .",
    "applying the symmetry relation @xmath52 at large times simplifies this expression into @xmath53 this equation , with the help of the normalization condition ( [ norm ] ) , yields @xmath54 such rather complex relation can take a simpler form for two limiting cases - for two - channel tasep without coupling and in the strong - coupling limit . for @xmath8",
    "we obtain @xmath55 while for @xmath29 it transforms into @xmath56 in agreement with exact calculations presented above [ see eqs .",
    "( 8 - 10 ) ] .",
    "the particle current per channel can be written as @xmath57(1-p_{10}-p_{11}).\\ ] ] in this expression the first multiplier gives the probability to find a vertical cluster in configurations , from which the particle can hop to the right , while the second multiplier gives the probability that the site ahead is available . using the relation ( [ p10expression ] ) we can express the particle current only in terms of one variable - the density of vertical clusters @xmath58 , @xmath59 again , simpler relations can be obtained for two limiting cases of zero coupling and strong coupling .",
    "the particle current in the case of @xmath8 is given by @xmath60 while for @xmath29 we conclude that @xmath61 these relations also agree with exact results discussed above .",
    "we expect that , similarly to the case of zero inter - channel coupling or in the strong - coupling limit , there are three possible stationary phases .",
    "the conditions for a maximal - current phase can be specified by computing a maximum of the particle current as a function of density of @xmath51 clusters , i.e. , @xmath62 .",
    "it leads to the following equation , @xmath63}{1-w}=0.\\ ] ] for any value of inter - channel coupling @xmath64 this equation can always be solved exactly numerically , and we can obtain the value of the density of filled vertical clusters in the maximal - current phase . because this equation can have more than one real solution , we should always choose the physically reasonable solution which gives @xmath65 .",
    "utilizing eqs .",
    "( [ density ] ) , ( [ p10expression ] ) and ( [ current1 ] ) , the stationary properties of this phase can be easily determined .",
    "for example , for @xmath66 the calculations show that @xmath67    in the low - density phase the entrance rate @xmath2 limits the overall particle dynamics , and the expression for the current per channel is given by @xmath68 or , using eq .",

    "( [ p10expression ] ) , we derive the expression for the density of @xmath32 clusters , @xmath72 these equations allow us to calculate the bulk density as @xmath73 , and also , substituting eq .",

    "( [ current_ld ] ) , the particle current per channel can be expressed as @xmath74.\\ ] ]    when exit dynamics determines the overall behavior of the system we have a high - density phase .",

    "( [ p10expression ] ) , it transforms into @xmath76 again comparing this expression with the particle current in the bulk , as given by eq.([current1 ] ) , we derive the density of filled vertical clusters , @xmath77 substitution of it into eq .",
    "( [ p10expression ] ) allows us to compute the density of @xmath32 clusters , @xmath78 then the bulk density in each channel is equal to @xmath79 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the bulk density in this phase is always independent of inter - channel coupling and depends only on exit rate , although the densities of filled and half - filled clusters strongly depend on @xmath64 .",
    "the expression for the particle current can be derived from eqs .",
    "( [ current_hd ] ) and ( [ p11 ] ) , @xmath80.\\ ] ]    there are two types of phase transitions in the system .",
    "the boundary between the low - density and high - density phase specifies the first - order phase transition with jumps in bulk densities , while the transition between the maximal - current and low - density or high - density phases is continuous .",
    "the low - density and high - density phases coexist when the particle currents in each phase are equal , i.e. , @xmath81 . from eqs .",
    "( [ current_ld1 ] ) and ( [ current_hd1 ] ) we obtain , @xmath82=\\frac{\\beta}{2}\\left[1 - 2\\beta+\\sqrt{1 - 4w\\beta(1-\\beta)}\\right],\\ ] ] which determines the phase boundary curve in @xmath83 coordinates .",
    "one can observe that , in contrast to the systems with zero coupling or in the limit of strong coupling , the phase boundary here is not a linear function of parameters .",
    "similar arguments can also be used to find the boundaries between the low - density or high - density and the maximal - current phases .",
    "theoretically calculated phase diagrams for different inter - channel couplings are presented in fig .",
    "our approximate theory treats exactly the particle dynamics inside vertical clusters , however , interactions between the clusters are accounted for in an approximate mean - field fashion .",
    "theoretical predictions from this approximate method agree with exact results in the limiting cases of zero inter - channel coupling and strong coupling . to check the overall validity of our approach for intermediate couplings we performed extensive monte carlo computer simulations .",
    "our theoretical arguments are valid only in the thermodynamic limit , i.e. , @xmath84 .",
    "however , in our simulations the lattice of size @xmath85 was used , and we checked that for larger lattices there is no difference with reported results .",
    "the density profiles and particle currents in our simulations were calculated by averaging over @xmath86 monte carlo steps , although first @xmath87 of total number of steps were neglected to ensure that the system has reached the stationary state .",

    "it equals to 1 at small @xmath2 and @xmath3 and slowly decreases for higher values of parameters , as shown in fig .",
