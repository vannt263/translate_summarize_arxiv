    "recent radio observations of the 143  ms pulsar psr  j2032 + 4127  find it to be part of a very eccentric , long orbital period binary system , with the pulsar expected to reach periastron in late 2017 with its high - mass , be star companion @xcite .",
    "the pulsar was discovered by _",
    "lat  @xcite and is associated with tev source tev  j2032 + 4130 @xcite .",
    "these characteristics make the psr  j2032 + 4127  binary system very similar to the previously unique pulsar system psr  b1259@xmath063/ls  2883 ( see , e.g. @xcite , for review ) , and x - ray results reported here support this similarity .",
    "subsequent to its discovery in gamma rays , psr  j2032 + 4127  was detected in radio by @xcite , who also reanalysed a 49  ks _ chandra _  observation taken in 2004 of the field of the cygnus ob2 association ( at a distance @xmath5 ; @xcite ) , to which the pulsar likely belongs .",
    "they confirm an x - ray source at the position of the radio source , which also corresponds to optical source 213 of @xcite , a b0  v star ( hereafter mt91  213 ) .",
    "mt91  213  has a mass of either @xmath6 @xcite or @xmath7 @xcite and bolometric luminosity @xmath8 @xcite , in broad agreement with values appropriate to its spectral and luminosity classification , i.e. @xmath9 and @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "an optical spectrum shows mt91  213  has a h@xmath3 equivalent width ( ) of @xmath11    @xcite , which is typical of be stars and due to a circumstellar disc surrounding the star .",
    "@xcite fit a power - law to the _ chandra _  spectrum and find an unabsorbed 0.510  kev x - ray luminosity @xmath12 .",
    "this x - ray luminosity is compatible with that of either be stars ( see , e.g. @xcite ) or pulsars of age @xmath13 ( see , e.g. @xcite ) , where the pulsar age is taken to be its characteristic spin - down age .",
    "more recent analysis of timing observations of psr  j2032 + 4127  reveals that its timing noise can be removed by considering a timing model in which the pulsar is in an eccentric ( with eccentricity @xmath14 ) , decades - long orbit @xcite .",
    "because of the long orbital period , radio measurements up to that time only cover about 20% of the orbit , and previous observations ( at all wavelengths ) of the pulsar / be - star binary system have been when the pulsar is on the apastron - side of the orbit .",
    "[ fig : orbit ] shows a schematic diagram of the system .",
    "radio and gamma - ray telescopes continue to monitor the pulsar as it moves towards periastron .",
    "these observations will refine the orbital parameters , including eccentricity and mass function , and could , along with vlbi measurements , directly determine distance and orbital inclination @xcite .    many of the above characteristics are typical of be x - ray binary systems , albeit with orbital periods of @xmath15 , which can shine at up to eddington luminosities ( @xmath16 ) when the neutron star nears periastron and accretes matter from the circumstellar disc ( of size a few times the be star radius , and larger for isolated be stars ; @xcite ) of its be star companion @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we are concerned with x - ray ( as well as radio and optical ) emission when the pulsar is far from periastron and not accreting from the circumstellar disc of the be star , which might occur near periastron .",
    "thus the x - ray luminosity is expected to be much lower , as indeed we find , as well as a brightening that seems in accord with the well - studied 3.4  yr orbital period gamma - ray binary that contains psr  b1259@xmath063 .",
    "there are several previous _",
    "_  observations of cygnus  ob2 ( see table  [ tab : obsx ] ) , and although significantly off - axis , some of these contain the pulsar / be - star binary system in the field of view . as discussed above , @xcite describe results for the 2004 observation ( obsid  4501 ) , while @xcite describe results for the 2010 observations ( obsid  10944 , 10945 , 10951 , 10962 ) .    in section  [ sec : radio ] , we report results of an updated timing solution based on monitoring at radio wavelengths , supplemented with _",
    "lat  gamma - ray data . we ( re)analyse all _ chandra _  and _ swift _  x - ray data , as well as our 2016 4.9  ks _ chandra _  target of opportunity observation , and report our results in section  [ sec : xray ] . in section",
    "[ sec : optical ] , we report on recent optical measurements of the h@xmath3  and their implication for the size of the be star circumstellar disc . in section",
    "[ sec : discuss ] , we summarize and briefly discuss our findings , including a few comparisons with psr  b1259@xmath063/ls  2883 .",
    "because of limited orbital phase coverage of observations of the pulsar since its discovery in 2009 , there was strong covariance between several parameters of the orbital configuration reported in @xcite .",
    "radio timing observations with the 76-m lovell telescope at jodrell bank continued during the subsequent two years .",
    "these observations , along with gamma - ray times of arrival ( toas ; see next ) , are all processed using the methodology described in @xcite , which uses the tempo2 @xcite pulsar timing analysis package .",
    "timing data now span a total of nearly 8 years , i.e. modified julian date ( mjd )  5468957538 .",
    "data from _ fermi _ lat  are used to provide gamma - ray profiles and additional toas over the timespan of the radio data .",
    "we select pass 8 lat data , belonging to the ` source ` class as defined under the ` p8r2_source_v6 ` instrument response functions , from the start of the mission ( 2008 august 4 ) to 2016 may 23 ( mjd 5468257527 ) in a circular region of interest ( roi ) centred on the pulsar position and with a @xmath17 radius .",
    "we choose events with energies from 100  mev to 100  gev and require the zenith angle to be @xmath18 .",
    "we restrict time intervals to be when lat was in nominal science operations , data are flagged as good , and there are no corresponding bright solar flares or gamma - ray bursts .",
    "we perform a binned maximum likelihood analysis on a @xmath19 square region , including all sources in the 3fgl catalogue within 25@xmath20 of the roi centre @xcite .",
    "diffuse emission components are modelled using _ gll_iem_v06.fits _ @xcite and _ iso_p8r2_source_v6_v06.txt _ templates .",
    "analysis of spatial and spectral residuals does not reveal the need for any additional components .",
    "following the procedure outlined in @xcite , we model the gamma - ray spectrum of psr  j2032 + 4127  as either a power law , power law with exponential cutoff , or power law with exponential cutoff and free exponential index @xmath21 .",
    "we compare the best - fitting likelihood using each model and find significant curvature ( @xmath22 ) and a preference for the model with @xmath21 being free ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "the best - fitting model has a power law photon index of @xmath24 , cutoff energy of @xmath25 gev , and @xmath26 ; uncertainties are purely statistical errors .",
    "these values do not agree , within uncertainties , with those of @xcite , but we note that their analysis uses three years of p7_v6 data and finds ts@xmath27 and thus uses @xmath28 .",
    "we perform spectral fits in @xmath2930 day bins of 95 flux measurements with only the normalization of psr  j2032 + 4127  free and calculate a value of ts@xmath30 ( as defined in @xcite ) of 109 , which is less than the threshold value of 128.80 and indicates no detectable flux variability [ with a 1100  gev flux of @xmath31 , consistent with that of @xcite ] . using the best - fit model with @xmath21 being free and events within @xmath32 of the roi centre , we calculate spectral weights to enhance sensitivity @xcite .",
    "we then use the weighted events to construct 95  toas ( at @xmath33-day cadence ) as described in @xcite .",
    "the newly extended orbital phase coverage reduces covariance between fitted parameters and allows refinement of the timing model . while we can not yet obtain a unique solution because the orbital period and eccentricity are still highly covariant",
    ", there is a one - dimensional family of tempo2 fits , which are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : radiofits ] , as a function of orbital period .",
    "the rms timing residuals reach an asymptotic minimum at about 0.42  ms for orbital periods approaching 17830  d , the period at which eccentricity is close to 1.0 and the system would be marginally bound .",
    "however , the mass function @xmath34 [ @xmath35 , where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the neutron star and be star masses and @xmath38 is the orbital inclination ] has a maximum value of @xmath39 [ using @xmath40 , @xmath41 ( see sec .  [ sec : intro ] ) , and @xmath42 , and fig .",
    "[ fig : radiofits ] shows that @xmath43 corresponds to a binary period of 17670  d. inspection of timing residuals from the best - fitting long - period models indicates that timing residuals are essentially ` white ' , with little evidence of any systematic departure of toas from the models . for periods shorter than about 16000  d ,",
    "substantial systematic departures are seen , resulting in an observed increase in rms residuals .",
    "any solution with orbital period of @xmath44 days , with corresponding eccentricity of @xmath45 , is likely to be acceptable .",
    "parameters of three models spanning this acceptable range are presented in table  [ tab : spinpars ] . for all such acceptable fits",
    ", the epoch of periastron is becoming well constrained at around mjd  58060(10 ) , i.e. centred on early november 2017 .",
    "figure  [ fig : orbit ] illustrates one possible configuration of the system for @xmath46  d and @xmath47 ( model 2 in table  [ tab : spinpars ] ) . we note that there is no systematic deviation between radio and gamma - ray residuals through the whole data set , indicating that the ephemeris and dispersion measure ( dm ) are correct and that there is no detectable variation in dm yet .",

    "we now expect periastron to occur around the beginning of november 2017 . however , we caution that the pulsar is rather young , with a characteristic age of about 200  kyr , and it may therefore suffer from some rotational timing noise .",

    "the best models show little evidence for any unmodelled timing noise .",
    "furthermore , as the pulsar approaches periastron , rapidly - changing doppler effects are likely to dominate any effects of timing noise .",

    "they were not reported in @xcite , although that study did not cover the h@xmath3 region .",
    "spectra at additional epochs were reported by @xcite under a different name ( cygnus ob2 - 4  b ) for the star : in 2012 september it showed no emission lines , while in 2008 october and 2013 september  october , double - peaked h@xmath3 and h@xmath73 were present .",
    "we estimate the size of the circumstellar disc around mt91  213  using the relation from @xcite , which connects circumstellar disc radius @xmath74 and stellar radius @xmath75 to the h@xmath3 , i.e. @xmath76 our  measurements of mt91  213  indicate that its circumstellar disc has varied in size by more than a factor of two , from @xmath77 to @xmath78 ( see table  [ tab : halpha ] ) . for typical b0  v stars , @xmath79 @xcite , which yields a range of @xmath74 from @xmath80 to @xmath81 .",

    "in this work , we described recent multiwavelength observations of the high - energy binary system containing the 143  ms radio pulsar psr  j2032 + 4127  and the b0  ve companion star mt91  213 .",
    "the orbit is very eccentric ( @xmath45 ) and large ( @xmath82  yr ) , and the pulsar is accelerating rapidly towards periastron passage in 2017 november .",
    "we updated orbital parameters of the system obtained via radio monitoring , combined with _",

    "archival and recent _ chandra _  and _ swift _",
    "observations show that the psr  j2032 + 4127/mt91  213  system has brightened significantly in x - rays , especially within the last year as it approaches periastron .",
    "we can understand the current and past behavior of the psr  j2032 + 4127/mt91  213  system by comparing it to the high - energy binary pulsar system psr  b1259@xmath063/ls  2883 , since the two systems have many similarities .",
    "psr  b1259@xmath063  is a 47.76  ms radio pulsar in an eccentric ( @xmath83 ) 3.4  yr orbit with ls  2883 , which is a 09.5  ve star @xcite .",
    "psr  b1259@xmath063/ls  2883 has been observed across the electromagnetic spectrum during each periastron passage since its discovery ( see , e.g. @xcite , for discussion of the most recent passage in 2014 ) , as well as around apastron ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the resulting studies show that its multiwavelength emission can be understood as shock interaction between the relativistic wind emitted by the pulsar and the circumstellar disc and wind of the companion star @xcite . however , in attempting to extrapolate the observed behavior of psr  b1259@xmath063  to that of psr  j2032 + 4127 , it is important to note that the binary separation at apastron is @xmath84  au in the case of psr  b1259@xmath063 , while psr  j2032 + 4127  has only been observed up to this point at a binary separation @xmath85  au .",
    "at this large distance , the wind from mt91  213  is possibly tenuous , and its collision with the pulsar wind is possibly weak . also ls  2883 is four times more luminous and a different stellar type @xcite ,",
    "so its wind properties are likely different from that of mt91  213 .",
    "for _ chandra _  observations taken in 2002 , 2004 , and around 2010 , psr  j2032 + 4127  was quite distant from mt91  213 , at a binary separation of @xmath86  au ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : orbit ] ) .",
    "thus the observed x - ray emission [ with @xmath87 could be due to what is effectively an isolated be star or an isolated young pulsar . in the former case , bright x - ray emission from powerful wind shocks of o stars is quite common , and spectra are often fit with an optically thin thermal plasma model ( as performed in section  [ sec : chandra ] ) ; the source of x - ray emission from stars of later stellar types is less certain , with a transition around early b stars , like mt91  213 , that have @xmath88 @xcite . using the relation between x - ray and bolometric luminosities , @xmath89 , found for o and bright b stars ( although there is large dispersion at the luminosity of stars similar to mt91  213 ; @xcite )",
    ", we find @xmath90 , which matches the x - ray luminosity of mt91  213  in 2002 .    for isolated pulsars",
    ", x - ray radiation can have non - thermal and thermal contributions .",
    "non - thermal emission can be generated by a relativistic wind , which produces a ratio between x - ray luminosity to rotational energy loss of @xmath91 and a spectrum that is best - fit by a power - law with @xmath92 @xcite . for psr  j2032 + 4127 , @xmath93 , and",
    "the measured power law is @xmath94 ( table  [ tab : spectrafit ] ) .",
    "thus a pulsar wind can easily be the source of observed x - rays .",
    "meanwhile , thermal emission for intermediate age ( @xmath95  yr ) neutron stars gives @xmath96 ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the more recent observations since late 2015 show significant brightening in x - rays ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : j2032lc ] ) , with @xmath97 .",
    "although these luminosities are somewhat lower than the x - ray luminosity seen for psr  b1259@xmath063  at apastron ( @xmath98 ; @xcite ) , the brightening of psr  j2032 + 4127  suggests that the pulsar has entered the regime where the pulsar wind is interacting strongly with the be star wind .",
    "x - ray spectral studies of psr  b1259@xmath063  find that most observations made by _ chandra _ , _ suzaku _ , _ swift _ , and _ xmm - newton _ can be fit with a power law model ( see , e.g. @xcite ) . @xcite and @xcite",
    "show that the value of @xmath99 varies with orbital phase and that @xmath99 changes from 1.8 around apastron to 1.2 right before the pulsar enters the circumstellar disc of ls  2883 at periastron , a decline that is similar to what is found from our limited spectra of psr  j2032 + 4127  ( see table  [ tab : spectrafit ] ) .",
    "the psr  j2032 + 4127/mt91  213  system will continue to be monitored across the electromagnetic spectrum as the pulsar approaches periastron .",
    "when it is near periastron , the system may brighten even more if the pulsar accretes from the circumstellar disc of the be star . psr  j2032 + 4127/mt91  213",
    "will thus serve as an invaluable tool for comparing and contrasting to the very well - studied and previously unique gamma - ray binary psr  b1259@xmath063/ls  2883 .",

    "<S> we analyse archival and recent _ chandra _  and _ swift _  observations and show that psr  j2032 + 4127/mt91  213  is now brighter in x - rays by a factor of @xmath1 since 2002 and @xmath2 since 2010 . </S>",
    "<S> while the pulsar is still far from periastron , this increase in x - rays is possibly due to collisions between pulsar and be star winds . </S>",
