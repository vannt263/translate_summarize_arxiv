    "with more than 70 transiting exoplanets ( teps ) now known , it has been become possible to detect statistically robust correlations between the parameters of teps and their host stars , which in turn yields insights into the processes that are important for determining the physical properties of exoplanet systems .",
    "several correlations have already been noted , including correlations between the masses and orbital periods of teps @xcite , between their surface gravities and orbital periods @xcite , between the inferred core mass of planets and the metallicity of their host stars @xcite , between safronov number and the host star metallicity @xcite , and between the radii of planets and their average equilibrium temperature and host metallicity @xcite .    very recently",
    "* hereafter khi10 ) have demonstrated a correlation between the emission spectra of teps and the chromospheric activity levels of their host stars , as measured from the strength of the emission lines at the ca  ii h and k line cores .",
    "planets with spectra consistent with noninverted temperature models appear to be found around high activity stars , while planets with spectra consistent with temperature inversions are found around low activity stars . in demonstrating",
    "this correlation khi10 also published a catalogue of @xmath0 values for 39 teps .",
    "this new , homogeneous sample enables statistical studies of the relationships between stellar activity and the physical properties of teps .    in this paper",
    "we use the sample of @xmath0 values from khi10 to investigate correlations between stellar activity and other tep parameters .",
    "we find that there is a significant correlation between @xmath0 and the planet surface gravity @xmath1 .",
    "a similar correlation between stellar activity ( as traced by the temporal variation in an index related to @xmath2 ) and the minimum planetary mass @xmath3 was previously noted by @xcite for a sample of 10 rv planets , though the authors deemed the correlation to be only suggestive .",
    "here we demonstrate that the @xmath0-@xmath4 correlation is robust with greater than @xmath5 confidence .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows : in section  [ sec : dataandanal ] we describe the data and conduct the statistical analysis to establish the correlation , in section  [ sec : selecteffect ] we discuss a potential observational bias which might lead to this correlation , and in section  [ sec : discussion ] we speculate on the physical origins of this correlation .",
    "table  [ tab : rhkvslogg ] gives the @xmath6 , and @xmath7 values adopted for planets with both parameters measured , together with the sources from the literature for the surface gravity measurements . in all cases we take @xmath6 from khi10 .",
    "in general we take the surface gravity of planets from studies which calculated it directly from observable parameters ( the transit duration , depth , and impact parameter , together with the rv semiamplitude , eccentricity , and orbital period ; see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in a markov - chain monte carlo simulation , or we calculate it ourselves from the given observable parameters .",
    "figure  [ fig : rhkvslogg ] shows the relation between @xmath8 and @xmath4 ; the existence of a correlation is readily apparent . to determine the statistical significance of this correlation we use the spearman rank - order correlation test",

    "the probability that a random sample of size @xmath10 drawn from an uncorrelated population would have either @xmath11 or @xmath12 is only @xmath13 , so the significance of the correlation is 99.6% .",
    "if we exclude the two hot neptunes gj  436b and hat - p-11b , which one might expect to have atmospheric properties that are different from more massive planets , the two long period planets hd  80606b and hd  17156b , and also exclude planets orbiting stars which have temperatures outside the range over which @xmath14 has been calibrated ( @xmath15 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we find a stronger correlation of @xmath16 , with a false alarm probability of 0.032% .",
    "the sample size in this case is @xmath17 .",
    "we have also searched for correlations between @xmath14 and other parameters such as planetary mass , planetary radius , the radial velocity semi - amplitude , stellar mass , planetary density , the safronov number @xmath18 @xcite , planetary equilibrium temperature ( assuming zero albedo ) , average stellar flux incident on the planet , orbital period , stellar metallicity , and stellar effective temperature . table  [ tab : correlationcoeffs ] summarizes the strength of each correlation for three separate samples :    1 .",

    "no restrictions    in addition to the @xmath22-@xmath4 correlation , positive correlations with @xmath23 confidence are also seen between @xmath22 and @xmath18 , and between @xmath22 and @xmath24 .",
    "all three parameters ( @xmath4 , @xmath18 and @xmath24 ) scale as @xmath25 ( @xmath26 for @xmath18 , @xmath27 for @xmath28 and @xmath29 for @xmath24 ) .",
    "the correlations seen between these parameters and @xmath22 most likely have the same origin .",
    "we focus on @xmath4 here both because the correlation is slightly more significant for this parameter than it is for @xmath18 or @xmath24 , and because for teps @xmath4 can be determined directly from measurable parameters @xcite , while the other two parameters are dependent on stellar models , which could conceivably introduce a bias if there is a systematic error in the stellar models which depends on activity .    by checking several different parameters for correlations with @xmath8",
    ", we have conducted several independent trials , and must therefore increase the false alarm probabilities to account for this .",
    "several of the parameters are strongly correlated ( @xmath30 , @xmath18 and @xmath24 , as well as @xmath31 and @xmath32 , and @xmath33 and @xmath34 ) , so these are not completely independent trials ; we estimate that the total number of independent trials is between @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "the corrected false alarm probability for the @xmath4-@xmath37 correlation is @xmath38 or @xmath39 for @xmath40 and @xmath41 respectively .",

    "the observed correlation between @xmath22 and @xmath1 may potentially be due to observational biases rather than physical effects .",
    "the most obvious relevant observational bias is the relative difficulty of obtaining high - precision rv observations for high - activity stars .",
    "this might introduce a selection whereby lower mass planets are not detectable if they are orbiting high activity stars .",
    "indeed , as seen in table  [ tab : correlationcoeffs ] , much of the @xmath22-@xmath4 correlation can be attributed to a correlation between the rv semiamplitude @xmath31 and @xmath8 , with less contribution from the planet radius .",
    "this is what would be expected for a selection effect of this form .",
    "figure  [ fig : rhkvsk](top ) shows the relation between these two parameters . if this correlation were due only to an observational bias , however , we would expect the correlation to continue to hold when low mass and long period planets are also included ( sample 2 ) .",
    "the fact that the correlation is reduced to @xmath49 with a false alarm probability of @xmath50 in this case is evidence that this relation may not be due to a selection effect .",
    "the lowest @xmath31 planet in this sample , hat - p-11 , was discovered around one of the most active stars in the sample . moreover , while a selection effect might explain the absence of sample 1 planets in the lower right corner of figure  [ fig : rhkvsk](top ) or figure  [ fig : rhkvslogg](bottom ) , it does not explain the absence of sample 1 planets in the upper left corners of these figures , unless high @xmath4 planets are intrinsically less common than low @xmath4 planets _ and _ low @xmath22 hot jupiter host stars are intrinsically less common than high @xmath22 host stars .    as an additional check on whether observational biases against selecting planets with low @xmath31 around high activity stars could be responsible for the @xmath22-@xmath4 correlation , we compare the @xmath22-@xmath31 relation for the teps from sample 1 to the sample of rv planets from the california - carnegie planet search presented by @xcite .",
    "we consider here 84 planets from that sample with @xmath51 index measurements and with @xmath52 .",
    "we use the relations from @xcite to calculate @xmath22 from @xmath53 and @xmath51 for each of these stars .",
    "we also plot the jitter and residual rms from @xcite . while the residual rms increases towards higher stellar activity levels , it is generally well below @xmath54 , and thus well below the lowest @xmath31 systems in sample 1 .",
    "moreover , a significant number of rv planets with @xmath55 have been detected around stars with @xmath56 .",
    "all this suggests that poorer rv precision due to increased stellar activity is unlikely to explain the absence of low surface gravity ( or low @xmath31 ) hot jupiters around active stars .",
    "assuming that the observed correlation between @xmath14 and @xmath4 is not due to an observational bias , it is not obvious what physical processes might give rise to it .",
    "it is well - known that @xmath22 is a decreasing function of age for fgk stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but the @xmath28-age relation implied from the @xmath4-@xmath8 relation is opposite of what is expected  that planets should contract with age , and not expand with age . for example , by interpolating the @xcite models while accounting for the increase in stellar luminosity over time , we find that a coreless @xmath57 planet orbiting a @xmath58 star on a @xmath59 period should decrease in radius from @xmath60 to @xmath61 between 300  myr and 4.5  gyr .",
    "models such as these , however , are known to underpredict the radii of many hot jupiters .",
    "if the effect of insolation on planetary radii is substantially larger than anticipated , so that the inflation due to the increase in stellar luminosity with time is greater than the gravitational contraction of the planet over time , the result would be a positive @xmath4-@xmath22 correlation .",
    "another possibility is that strong stellar uv flux increases the evaporation of hydrogen from the atmospheres of hot jupiters , leading to higher metallicity , more compact planets ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "if this were the case , we might expect to see a correlation between planet radius and stellar activity , and no correlation between planet mass and activity .",
    "the fact that the opposite effect is observed casts doubt on this hypothesis . moreover , since the stellar activity should decrease with age , this hypothesis does not explain how planets could re - inflate when the activity is lowered .",
    "alternatively , the presence of hot jupiters may induce activity on the host star , either by tidally spinning - up the star s convection zone , or via a magnetic star - planet interaction ( see the review by * ? ? ?",
    "in this case stars with high @xmath8 may not necessarily be younger than stars with lower @xmath22 .",
    "evidence that the presence of a hot jupiter is correlated with increased stellar x - ray activity has been presented by @xcite , while @xcite found that hot jupiter host stars may exhibit excess rotation .",
    "other investigations have found evidence of magnetic activity variations correlated with planet properties ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". for both tidal and magnetic star - planet interactions , the strength of the interaction increases with planet mass .",
    "if the @xmath22-@xmath1 correlation is a by - product of a more fundamental @xmath8-@xmath32 correlation , one might wonder why the former is detected with higher significance than the latter .",
    "a possible explanation is that @xmath4 is determined directly from measurable parameters while @xmath32 is directly proportional to the stellar mass @xmath44 , which in turn is dependent on stellar models . as a result @xmath4",
    "is generally determined with better precision , and presumably with better accuracy , than @xmath62 for teps . however , by simulating data sets with the observed @xmath32-@xmath22 correlation and @xmath63 correlations , assuming the scatter about these relations is intrinsic , and assuming the observational errors for @xmath32 and @xmath4 are realistic , we find that there is only a @xmath64 probability of the fap of @xmath4-@xmath14 being less than 0.1% while the fap of @xmath32-@xmath8 is greater than 1% . even if we assume the true observational error on @xmath32 is @xmath65 , the probability is only @xmath66 .",
    "it is therefore unlikely that the @xmath22-@xmath32 relation is driving the @xmath8-@xmath4 relation .    in summary , we have identified a significant positive correlation between stellar activity and planetary surface gravity .",
    "as far as we are aware this correlation is unanticipated , and its cause is unclear .",
