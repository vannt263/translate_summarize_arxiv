    "in a two - particle system , bound - state correlations can be roughly classified as asymptotic ones and short - range ones .",
    "the asymptotic ones are determined principally by the binding energy , while the short - range ones depend on the high - momentum components of the wave function .",
    "this can be seen by examining the manner in which a bound pair appears in the two - body t - matrix , @xmath2 .",
    "the t - matrix satisfies the integral equation @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the two - body interaction and @xmath5 the free two - body propagator . a bound",
    "state appears in the t - matrix as a pole at a negative value of the energy , @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the binding energy of the pair .",
    "we then have @xmath8 with @xmath9 the continuum ( positive energy ) part of the t - matrix and @xmath10 the bound - state vertex function .",
    "substitution of the latter expression into the integral equation immediately yields an equation for the vertex function , @xmath11 the vertex function describes the momentum dependence ( spatial dependence ) of the bound state and is closely related to its wavefunction . by rewriting the equation for the vertex function as @xmath12 we can identify the bound - state wave function as @xmath13 . in this last expression",
    ", we can see the rough division of the correlations into asymptotic ones determined by the singularity of the green s function , @xmath14 , and short - range ones contained in the high momentum components of the vertex function , @xmath10 .",
    "the two - nucleon system in the vacuum has a bound state in the isospin one , @xmath15s@xmath16-@xmath15d@xmath16 channel  the deuteron . in the isospin zero , @xmath0s@xmath1 channel ,",
    "where we will study pairing , the two - nucleon system in the vacuum has no bound state .",
    "it does have a virtual state , however , with @xmath17 @xmath18 and @xmath19 kev , corresponding to a two - nucleon singlet scattering length @xmath20 fm .",
    "an expansion similar to that of eq .",
    "( [ tbnd ] ) can still be performed to extract the contribution to the t - matrix of the virtual state .",
    "because the energy of this state is extremely small , its contribution to the t - matrix dominates the low - energy scattering and essentially determines the short - range correlations in the @xmath0s@xmath1 channel .",
    "the short - range correlations determined by the momentum dependence of the vertex function of the virtual state , @xmath21 , are thus to good approximation given by the momentum dependence of the half - on - shell @xmath0s@xmath1 t - matrix at zero energy , @xmath22 .",
    "we have from the expression analogous to eq .",
    "( [ tbnd ] ) , @xmath23 note that the asymptotic properties of the virtual state also play a role here , by determining the magnitude of the contribution of the virtual state to the t - matrix through the factor @xmath24 .",
    "the short - range correlations contained in the @xmath25-dependence can be extracted unambiguously , however , by normalizing both sides of the equation to their values at @xmath26 .    to look for general two - particle correlations in nuclear matter",

    "( [ tmat ] ) , the propagator @xmath5 is now a many - body operator that , beside describing the two - body propagation , must take into account the effects of pauli blocking and of interaction with the nuclear medium . to look for bound - state correlations ,",
    "one would examine the poles and respective vertex functions of the @xmath27-matrix as advocated years ago by emery@xcite .",
    "such an approach has been used by various authors@xcite .",
    "we will use instead the hfb approximation .",
    "it too has been used to study bound - state correlations in nuclear matter @xcite and to even estimate deuteron production in heavy - ion collisions @xcite .",
    "we can lend force to our use of the hfb approximation to study bound - state correlations by analyzing qualitatively the manner in which the one - body hfb approach takes into account the two - body pairing bound state .",
    "we begin by observing that a bound - state vertex function @xmath10 of the t- or @xmath27-matrix can be considered as an operator that converts a two - body bound state into two single particles .",
    "we could instead consider this a one - body operator by ( 1 ) neglecting the particle number of the bound state and ( 2 ) considering one of the outgoing particles as an entering hole .",
    "the effect of the vertex function would then be the conversion of a hole to a particle .",
    "this is just what the pairing field , @xmath28 , of the hfb approximation does .",
    "analogously , we can associate the adjoint vertex function , @xmath29 , which converts two single particles to the two - body bound state , with the conjugate pairing field , @xmath30 , which converts a particle to a hole .    to obtain a complete one - body description , we must take into account the propagation of particles and holes as well as the conversion of one to the other . a hfb formalism that succeeds in unifying these ingredients simply and",
    "clearly is the gorkov one@xcite .",
    "although infrequently used in non - relativistic studies of pairing , the formalism has served as the basis for various relativistic studies @xcite .",
    "this is due , at least in part , to its natural expression in terms of the propagator language common to field - theoretical approaches .",
    "the gorkov formulation of pairing extends the usual particle propagator @xmath31 to one of the form @xmath32 in which @xmath33 describes the propagation of holes in the medium and the anomalous propagator @xmath34 and its conjugate @xmath35 describe the conversion of holes to particles and particles to holes , respectively . inverting the reasoning that lead us from the vertex function @xmath10 to the pairing field @xmath28",
    ", we can interpret the anomalous propagator and its conjugate as terms describing the overlap between the two - particle bound state and the two single particles .",
    "we thus expect the anomalous propagators to contain information about the relative motion of the two particles in the bound pair .",
    "we sketch here the development of a dirac version of gorkov s self - consistent particle - hole propagator@xcite . to do this ,",
    "we begin with the following ansatz to the effective single - particle lagrangian , @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the usual self - energy , @xmath28 and @xmath30 are the pairing fields and @xmath38 is a chemical potential , which will be used to constrain the average baryon density .    the hole wave function , @xmath39 , is defined as @xmath40 where @xmath41 denotes the transpose of the wave function @xmath42 , and the matrix @xmath43 , in which the pauli matrix @xmath44 acts in the isospin space and @xmath45 is the charge conjugation matrix .",
    "we note that , up to a factor of @xmath46 and a phase , the isospin doublet @xmath39 is the time - reverse of @xmath42 .",

    "we can manipulate the effective one - particle lagrangian into a matrix form , @xmath50 @xmath51 where @xmath52 the extended vector wave function is that of the quasi - particle .",
    "its equation of motion is evident and could be written down immediately .    due to the translational invariance of nuclear matter , the equation in momentum - space is diagonal in the wave number . for the momentum - space representation of the corresponding generalized feynman propagator ,",
    "the equation of motion takes the form @xmath53 we note that the momentum - dependent unitary transformation that diagonalizes the matrix operator is the dirac version of the bogoliubov - valantin transformation .",
    "to make contact between the effective quasi - particle lagrangian and an interacting one , we assume that the meson+interaction terms in the latter have been reduced to four - fermion terms of the following form , @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are vertex functions , @xmath57 is the meson propagator , and @xmath58 and @xmath59 represent any indices necessary for the correct description of the meson propagation and coupling .",
    "we can obtain the mean field contribution of this interaction term by replacing each of the possible pairs of fermion fields by its ground - state expectation value , @xmath60 where , by @xmath61 , we mean the time - ordered ground - state expectation value , @xmath62 .",
    "we note that the first term in this expression is a hartree one and the second a fock exchange one , while the last two , after using the definition of @xmath39 to replace the transposed @xmath42 s , can be recognized as pairing terms . comparing these mean field contributions to those of the effective quasi - particle lagrangian",

    ", the self - energy must be an isoscalar .",
    "the transposition invariance condition of eq .",
    "( [ tran ] ) forces the scalar pairing field to be an isovector .",
    "we have simplified the form of the pairing field by assuming that it can be taken to be real and that the isospin dependence can be isolated in an overall factor of @xmath72 , where the unit vector @xmath73 is arbitary .",
    "the special case @xmath74 corresponds to the standard one of proton - proton and neutron - neutron pairing .",
    "although we have not studied more elaborate isospin dependences , we have examined complex solutions to the pairing equations and found them to differ by only an overall phase from the solutions restrained to be real .    after substituting the simplified expressions for the mean fields into the propagator and the self - consistency equations ,",
    "the latter can be reduced to coupled equations for the components of the mean fields and the chemical potential , @xmath38 .",
    "the self - consistency equations contain contributions from both the negative - energy and the positive - energy states ( from the dirac sea and the fermi sea ) .",

    "we want to emphasize , however , that the momentum dependence of the neutron matter pairing fields is just as independent of the matter density as is the momentum dependence of the pairing fields in the case of nuclear matter .",
    "we would also like the short - range correlations contained in the pairing fields and gap function to be relatively independent of the interaction parameters , at least if we believe that these parameters provide a reasonable description of the actual physical situation .",
    "we can see in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] that , to a certain extent , this is the case .",
    "there we show the normalized momentum dependence of the pairing fields and gap function , obtained for two different values of the momentum cutoff using the @xmath80-@xmath81 model parameters of ref . @xcite and of ref .",
    "we see that the normalized momentum - dependence of the pairing fields and gap function , although similar , is clearly different for the two sets of interaction parameters",
    ". however , the momentum - dependence of the fields depends only weakly on the values of the cutoff , @xmath79 , as is also the case for the other sets of interaction parameters that we have used .    in the limit of zero density , the integral equation for the pairing field , eq .",
    "( [ hfbkp ] ) , reduces to the ladder approximation to the bethe - salpeter equation for a two - particle bound state , in which the the chemical potential is identified with the two - body bound - state energy and antiparticle propagation in the two - nucleon center - of - mass frame has been discarded . for a physically reasonable interaction , this has no nontrivial solution in the @xmath0s@xmath1 channel , as the two - nucleon system has no bound state there .",
    "the @xmath0s@xmath1 virtual state appears as a solution when the equation is analytically extended to the second energy sheet .",
    "as we have already stated , the energy of the virtual @xmath0s@xmath1-state is extremely small , so that its vertex function dominates the short - range correlations in two - nucleon scattering at low energies . as the virtual state and the pair state at low nuclear matter densities",
    "are solutions of essentially the same equation ( and contain essentially the same physics ) , we expect the short - range correlations of the pair state to be similarly dominated by the short - range correlations of the virtual state .",
    "we thus expect the the components of the pairing field to have a momentum dependence similar to that of the components of the vertex function of the virtual state .",
    "we have seen in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] that , at low densities , this is indeed the case .",
    "as the gap function @xmath93 has a momentum dependence similar to that of the non - relativistic vertex function of the virtual state @xmath21 we expect , as discussed above , that it should also have a dependence on the momentum similar to that of the half - on - shell matrix element of the zero - energy non - relativistic @xmath0s@xmath1 t - matrix , @xmath22 .",
    "that is , we expect that @xmath97 in figs .  [ fig3 ] and  [ fig4 ] , we have plotted , together with the normalized pairing fields , the normalized non - relativistic zero - energy half - on - shell @xmath0s@xmath1 t - matrix , for the case of the bonn - b potential@xcite , which includes the exchange of @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 and @xmath101 mesons between nucleons .",

    "we thus conclude that the momentum dependence of the effective interactions that we used does provide a reasonable description of the actual physical situation .",
    "in contrast with the almost unchanging momentum dependence of the pairing fields , we find that their magnitudes depends strongly on the interaction parameters and the value of the cutoff .",
    "this reflects the fact that nuclear pairing is the result of a delicate balance between short - range repulsion and long - range attraction.@xcite changing the interaction parameters or the momentum cutoff changes the point of this balance , modifying the magnitudes of the fields . however , such modifications do not appear in the magnitudes of the pairing fields alone . as we have noted , in the zero density limit , the equation for the pairing field , eq .",
    "( [ hfbkp ] ) , reduces to the ladder approximation to the bethe - salpeter equation for a two - particle bound state in the @xmath0s@xmath1 channel .",
    "for some sets of interaction parameters and momentum cutoff , a bound state can indeed be found . in other cases , where no bound state exists , analytic continuation of the pairing equations to the second energy sheet reveals a virtual state in the @xmath0s@xmath1 channel .",

    "calculations were also performed using a relativistic zero - range interaction , in which the @xmath80 and @xmath81 mesons are taken to be infinitely heavy and the coupling constants are defined so as to yield the correct nuclear - matter saturation point . for each parameter set ,",
    "the momentum cutoff @xmath79 was varied with all other parameters kept fixed . for each value of the momentum cutoff , we determined the pairing gap at @xmath102=0.5 @xmath18 , about 1/8 of the saturation density , and obtained the bound or virtual state energy in the vacuum .",
    "we observe in figs .",
    "[ fig5 ] and  [ fig6 ] that the value of the free two - nucleon bound or virtual state energy essentially determines the magnitudes of the gap function @xmath103 and the pairing fields @xmath87 at @xmath102=0.5 @xmath18 .",
    "the @xmath80-@xmath81 results agree well among themselves , with their values for each of the pairing fields and gap function all lying within a narrow band .",
    "although the inclusion of other mesons increases the size of the bands , their widths still remain small relative to the magnitudes of the fields . in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , we see that even the zero - range model yields results for the gap function in good agreement with those of the other calculations . however , it can not reproduce the values of the components of the pairing field , @xmath87 , obtained with the finite - range models , as is apparent in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] .    the correlations between the components of the pairing field , @xmath87 , and the position of the virtual state , shown in fig .",

    "several of the finite - range points lie between the two lines .",
    "the finite - range calculations that fall close to the zero - range line all correspond to extremely low values of the momentum cutoff , @xmath104 mev / c .",
    "they are thus similar to the momentum - independent zero - range results in the sense that the pairing fields ( but not the gap function ) in these cases vary little as a function of the momentum .",
    "( better said , they have very little room in which to vary . )",
    "this is clear from the leftmost portions of figs .",
    "[ fig3 ] and  [ fig4 ] , in which the momentum dependence expected of the pairing fields for values of the cutoff @xmath104 mev / c is displayed in the range of values @xmath105 @xmath18 .",
    "we can understand better the correlation between the magnitudes of the pairing fields and the location of the virtual state if we examine the coherence length of the pairing fields .",
    "the coherence length @xmath106 of a bound pair is defined as its root mean square radius . in terms of the momentum - space wave function of the pair , @xmath107",

    ", we argue that here we can obtain the ( un - normalized ) pair wave function as the residue of the anomalous propagator @xmath109 at its pole , @xmath110 where we retain only the contribution of the positive - energy pole , to be consistent with the vacuum truncation discussed earlier . in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , we plot the inverse of the coherence length , @xmath111 , at @xmath102=0.5 @xmath18 , as a function of the position of virtual or bound state in the vacuum , just as was done in figs .",
    "[ fig5 ] and  [ fig6 ] . here",
    "too , we observe a similar strong correlation .",
    "what is most important at the moment , however , are the typical values obtained for the coherence length .",
    "we observe that , in the range of calculations shown , these never fall below 3 fm . near the physical position of the virtual state",
    ", the value of the coherence length lies between about 4 to 10 fm .",
    "as will be seen shortly , the fermi momentum at which we have shown the various correlations is close to that for which the coherence length of the pair attains its minimum value .",
    "thus we can claim that the coherence length of the physical bound pair never becomes smaller than about 4 fm .",
    "we can thus justify the correlations observed with the following argument : for the parameter sets of physical interest , the size of a bound pair at low density is much greater than the range of the interaction . as the short - range pair correlations are about the same for all sets of finite - range interaction parameters , it is then a single parameter , the net attraction , that determines the differences in the binding energy of the pair obtained with each of the parameter sets .",
    "it suffices to fix the size ( or energy ) of the pair at one value of the density to obtain its trend over the entire range of values for which the details of the interaction can be neglected .",
    "we choose to fix the net attraction between pairs by fixing the position in the complex momentum plane of the @xmath0s@xmath1 virtual state in the vacuum .",
    "as we have seen , this is equivalent to fixing the two - nucleon singlet scattering length .",
    "we thus fix a momentum cutoff for each parameter set so that it places the @xmath0s@xmath1 virtual state at its physical location of @xmath112 @xmath18 .",
    "this is impossible for the @xmath80-@xmath81 interaction parameters of ref .",
    "@xcite , for which @xmath113 @xmath18 for @xmath114 mev / c . in this case",
    ", we fix the virtual state at @xmath115 @xmath18 , its closest point to the physical location .",
    "the pairing fields that result are then fairly consistent among themselves and with the non - relativistic result of ref .",
    "@xcite for low values of the fermi momentum , as can be seen in fig .",
    "our results are also very similar to those obtained in many other non - relativistic calculations of both nuclear matter and neutron matter ( for which the gap function is from 10% to 20%larger ) , which are not shown here @xcite . although the calculations shown are restricted to those using the @xmath80-@xmath81 parameter sets , the gap functions obtained using the @xmath80-@xmath81-@xmath99-@xmath98 interaction parameters are quite similar .",
    "even the zero - range model can describe the behavior of the fermi - momentum gap - function at low densities , when it used with an appropriate cutoff @xmath79 .",
    "we note that the good agreement between different sets of interaction parameters does not extend up to densities at which the magnitude of the pairing fields begins to decrease .",

    "to which these details are reflected in the short - range correlations , that is to say , in the momentum dependence of the pairing fields , we can compare this momentum dependence with that of the half - on shell singlet t - matrix to choose the most `` physical '' parameter sets .",
    "as we have not performed relativistic calculations of the t - matrix , we have compared the non - relativistic calculations using the bonn potential to our gap functions to conclude that the @xmath116 and @xmath117 parameter sets of ref .",
    "@xcite are equally good and are the most `` physical '' of those we have studied . the half - on - shell singlet t - matrix obtained using the bonn potential and the gap function obtained using the @xmath116 parameters of ref .",
    "@xcite are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] the coherence lengths @xmath106 obtained using the physical values of the momentum cutoff that resulted in the gap functions of fig .  [ fig8 ] .",
    "we observe that the coherence length drops rapidly from infinity , at low densities , to reach a minimum of about 5 fm at about 1/10 the density of saturated nuclear matter .",
    "it rises again rapidly , becoming infinite at the density at which pairing disappears .",
    "the minimum coherence length is fairly independent of the interaction parameters and is about 5 or 6 fm in all cases studied .",
    "the coherence length in neutron matter displays a very similar dependence on the fermi momentum @xmath102 but is about 10% smaller than in nuclear matter of the same fermi momentum .",
    "we conclude by interpreting the spatial form of a bound @xmath0s@xmath1 pair in nuclear matter , when it exists , in terms of the magnitude and form of the pairing field , @xmath118 .",
    "the short - range correlations of the pair , characterized by the form of the pairing field , @xmath95 , are almost independent of model parameters , momentum cutoff and nuclear density , and are almost identical to those of the two - nucleon @xmath0s@xmath1 virtual state in the vacuum .",
    "the asymptotic nature of the pair , is roughly determined by the magnitude of the pairing fields at the fermi momentum , which are strongly varying functions of the nuclear matter density .",
    "based on the variations observed in the pair coherence length , we estimate that a @xmath0s@xmath1 pair in nuclear matter is most tightly bound at about @xmath119 the nuclear saturation density , somewhat below the density for which the pairing fields reach their maximum values . for larger and smaller values of the density , the pair is larger in extent and less bound .",
    "our numerical results indicate that the two principal physical ingredients that fix the form and magnitude of the pairing fields and the gap function are the energy of the nucleon - nucleon virtual state and the momentum dependence of its vertex function or , equivalently , the two - nucleon singlet scattering length and the momentum dependence of the half - on - shell zero - energy singlet t - matrix .",
    "the short - range two - nucleon correlations contained in the momentum dependence of the pairing fields and the virtual state are determined by the interplay between the short - range repulsion and medium - range attraction of the nucleon - nucleon interaction .",
    "if the short - range correlations are held fixed , the magnitude of the pairing fields and the position of the virtual state depend only on the overall strength of the interaction .",
    "pairing is also expected to occur in the @xmath15s@xmath16-@xmath15d@xmath16 deuteron channel .",
    "this possibility has been investigated by two groups @xcite , which both obtained nonrelativistic s - d gap functions that reach values of about 10 mev .",
    "although we have not performed such calculations , we note that the large values obtained for the s - d gap function are not surprising , given the correlation we observed in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] . since the deuteron is a bound pair while the @xmath0s@xmath1 two - nucleon state is virtual , the stronger effective two - nucleon potential in the @xmath15s@xmath16-@xmath15d@xmath16 channel",
    "would also be expected to produce a much larger gap function and pairing fields .",
    "several recent works have pointed out that medium polarization effects result in an important renormalization of the effective ( non - relativistic ) nucleon - nucleon interaction @xcite .",
    "one of the observed effects of this renormalization is a large reduction in the magnitude of the gap function .",
    "such a reduction is consistent with our results if the polarization effects of the medium reduce the attraction of the effective two - nucleon potential .",
    "another recent study has shown that the quark substructure of the nucleons and exchanged mesons is also expected to lead to a less attractive two - nucleon potential@xcite .",
    "we plan to extend our study of pairing to next take into account such effects .",

    "<S> pairing approximations provide a simple means of extending the independent - particle approximation to one which includes the effects of the binding energy and short - range correlations associated with bound pairs of nucleons in the nuclear medium . </S>",
    "<S> the long - range correlations associated with collective phenomena in nuclei are similarly described using the non - relativistic random - phase approximation ( rpa ) .    on the other hand , it is well known that non - relativistic independent - particle approaches using realistic two - body interactions have difficulties in accounting for basic phenomena , such as the spin - orbit part of the nucleon - nucleus interaction and the saturation properties of nuclear matter . </S>",
    "<S> these properties can be fairly easily described in a relativistic formulation , in which effective mesons are exchanged between dirac nucleons . </S>",
    "<S> the success of the relativistic mean field approach , initially developed by walecka and collaborators and later by many others @xcite , invited its extension to approximations that could take into account the residual correlations between nucleons .    </S>",

    "<S> the results obtained in refs . @xcite and @xcite , using a zero - range model and a non - relativistic reduction of the pairing equations , respectively , are generally much larger than those obtained in non - relativistic calculations , although both of the relativistic calculations used interaction parameters that were fit to yield the saturation point of nuclear matter . </S>",
    "<S> such results would indicate that other aspects of the interaction are involved in pairing than those necessary to describe the bulk characteristics of nuclei and of nuclear matter . </S>",

    "<S> the short - range repulsion and medium - range attraction resulting from the exchange of effective mesons provide a description of the short - range correlations in very good agreement with those of the two - nucleon virtual state , deduced from realistic nucleon - nucleon potential models . by requiring that the interactions also reproduce the position of the virtual state pole or , equivalently , the two - nucleon singlet scattering length </S>",
