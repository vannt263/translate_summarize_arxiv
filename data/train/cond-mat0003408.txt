    "in recent years much attention has been devoted to the study of relaxation processes of non - equillibrium charge carriers in strongly localized systems , where transport proceeds via phonon - assisted hopping , like photoexited charge carriers in band tails ( see e.g. @xcite-@xcite ) and anderson insulators ( see e.g.@xcite-@xcite ) . in such systems",
    "particular small relaxation speeds are observed .",
    "often the smallness of the relaxation speed is attributed to interaction effects .",
    "however , also in strongly localized non - interacting electron systems long lasting relaxation processes are known to be the rule , and not the exception @xcite .",
    "the theoretical investigation of such relaxation processes is notoriously difficult , since the system is strongly disordered and always in a transient state . in most problems",
    "one is interested in time scales which are large as compared to the time a single hop needs . for such time",
    "scales all quantities depend strongly on frequency , also for very low frequencies , so that the consideration of dispersive transport is vital . on the other hand in most problems of interest both spatial and energetical disorder exists . due to the latter fact the transitions are inelastic .",
    "the inelastic character of the transitions , the relaxation , leads to a flow of energy from the electron system to the phonon system . due to disorder",
    "this transport of energy is also dispersive .",
    "therefore , dispersive energy transport and relaxation are intimately connected .",
    "the investigation of the relaxation process requires both the consideration of dispersive particle transport _ and _ the consideration of dispersive energy transport .",
    "the intricate physical situation manifests also in the equations , which have to be considered .",
    "since the transport is inelastic already in the simplest approximation the investigation requires to find solutions to integral equations ( see e.g.@xcite- @xcite ) . due to the fact that the particle moves in an energy dependent density of states the kernel of these integral equations does not depend on the difference between the site energies only . the traditional method to handle the situation ,",
    "the percolation theory , is not applicable here .",
    "the effective - medium methods by movaghar and coworkers give , as pointed out by movaghar and coworkers , wrong results for systems at low temperature @xcite @xcite .",
    "furthermore , beyond the markovian approximation the derivation of these integral equations represents itself an intricate problem . to our knowledge , beside the attempts by movaghar and coworkers , numerical investigations",
    "( see e.g. , ) , and physical intuitive considerations ( see e.g. @xcite , ) , mainly markovian equations have been used ( see e.g. ) .",
    "it is the aim of the present paper to fill this gap and to provide a formalism that can be used for studying relaxation phenoma of strongly localized , charge carriers far from equillibrium in the hopping regime taking into account both dispersive particle transport and dispersive energy transport . to this end",
    "we focus , for the sake of definitness , on relaxation of photoxited , non - interacting , non - equillibrium charge carrires in band tails of , e.g. amorphous semiconductors , like amorphous si : h . on the first glance",
    ", this problem seems to be rather special .",
    "if the number of charge carriers exited is small fermi - correlation is negligible , so that one has to cope with linear rate equations .",
    "the linearity of the transport equations is , of course , the basic ingredient in solving the problem",
    ". a closer look on the problems of interest reveals , however , that most of the problems can be formulated in this way . clearly , how to achieve linearization depends on the experiment chosen , but , provided the number of charge carrires exited is small , always the smallness of the particle number can be invoked . in this case , the number of particles at a site is certainly not small as compared to its equillibrium value , but small as compared to unity .",
    "after linearization the structure is , in principle , quite similar as for the case considered here .    below we present the derivation of a framework for the consideration of relaxation phenomena due to phonon - assisted hopping at zero temperature .",
    "we focus on the limit of strong localization , where dispersive effects are expected to be most pronounced . here",
    "the disorder manifests in a strong dependence of the transport coefficients on frequency for very low frequencies .",
    "consequently , in this regime the diffusion propagator can not be calculated from markovian transport equations , like those used e.g. in ref .. to simplify our integral equations we use the concept of quasi - elasticity , the particle changes its energy only by a small amount by one hop .",
    "the method is applied to the study of dispersive energy transport .",
    "we find that always two tendencies are present , if only the density of states not decreases with increasing energy .",
    "first , there is a widening of the packet due to the statistical spreading , the dispersive energy transport .",
    "second , there is narrowing of the packet due to decrease of the density of states with decreasing energy .",
    "the overall evolution is determined by the interplay of these two tendencies .",
    "we have studied both tendencies in two limiting cases , for a particle moving in a constant density of states and for a particle moving in an exponential density of states . in the first case",
    "the impact of the density of states decrease is absent , so that only the statistical spreading is present . here",
    "the packet evolves into a gaussian packet moving with constant drift velocity in energy space .",
    "the packet width increases with time as @xmath0 .",
    "the other result is obtained for exponential density of states .",
    "here both tendencies are present .",
    "we find , that the velocity of the packet is strongly slowing down with time . in that case",
    "the mean square deviation of energy eventually becomes time - independent .",
    "consequently , the motion of the packet in energy space is `` soliton - like '' .",
    "the concrete results on the diffusion propagator , its time dependence and its moments for exponential densities of states are of relevance for photoluminiscense experiments on amorphous si : h .",
    "we consider photoexited , localized charge carriers in band tails at zero temperture .",
    "after exitation the charge carriers lower their energy by phonon - assisted hops between localized states .",
    "since @xmath1 , only hops from higher to lower energy occur .",
    "in this situation the charge carriers are in strong non - equilibrium .",
    "we assume , that the number of excited charge carriers is small , and their energies are far from the fermi level , so that it is very unlikely that an electron jumps to a site already occupied .",
    "consequently , we can neglect fermi - correlation . in this case",
    "the electron transport can be described by the rate equation @xcite .",
    "@xmath2 in calculating the transition probabilities we assume , that the electron - phonon coupling strength is weak , so that only one - phonon processes have to be taken into account .",
    "then , at zero temperature , the transition probabilities are given by @xmath3 where @xmath4 here @xmath5 is the inverse of localized state radius , and @xmath6 is the phonon frequency .",
    "the energy @xmath7 is the upper bound for the energy transfer by one hop .",
    "note , that in the materials of interest @xmath7 can be much smaller as the debye - frequency , since not all phonons can interact with localized electrons equally well .",
    "short wave - length phonons are ineffective since the electron - phonon coupling constant tends to zero for momenta @xmath8 with @xmath9 .",
    "therefore , the effective upper phonon momentum is of the order @xmath10 , and not of the order of the inverse lattice constant of the host material .",
    "furthermore , in disordered systems the high - energetic phonons are localized , and need not contribute to transport by necessity .",
    "the first step function in front of the transition probabilities restricts the transitions to transitions between sites separated by at most @xmath11 in energy space .",
    "thus , it decreases the energy relaxation speed . in impurity conduction , and in nearly all papers on relaxation of charge carriers in band tails , this step function is usually replaced by unity . in impurity conduction",
    "this is quite reasonable , since it is assumed that hops are restricted within narrow stripe near the fermi level , which is small compared to debye energy . in the band - tail problem , however , we can see no reason for neglecting it in advance .    to calculate the transport quantities of interest",
    ", we have to calculate the diffusion propagator . in order to render the analytical calculations feasible",
    "we introduce continuous coordinates .",
    "the change of representation is defined by : @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 . in this representation the rate equation ( [ b1 ] ) takes the form : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is determined by the equations : @xmath17 @xmath18 ,   \\label{b7}\\ ] ] @xmath19 the laplace - transformed equation is given by : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the initial condition .",
    "we will assume that @xmath22 is a function @xmath23 , so that @xmath24 .",
    "equation ( [ b9 ] ) can be solved using the green s function method .",
    "the solution is given by : @xmath25 the green s function satisfies the equation : @xmath26 note , that , due to probability conservation , the green s function @xmath27 and the probability @xmath28 satisfy the relations : @xmath29 @xmath30",
    "in order to calculate the configuration average , we assume , that the sites are distributed homogeneously in space .",
    "the distribution of site energies is supposed to be given by some distribution function @xmath31 .",
    "accordingly , the average of any quantity , depending on the energy and positions of sites , is given by : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the volume of the system .",
    "the application of the averaging procedure to the structural factor @xmath34 serves , in particular , as a definition for the density of states , i.e. @xmath35 products of the structural factor @xmath34 are averaged according to : @xmath36    using these definitions , the configuration average of eq.([b10 ] ) can be calculated diagrammatically @xcite .",
    "the diagrammatic method leads to the following set of equations for the calculation of the configuration average @xmath37 of the electron density @xmath38 @xcite , ( see figs [ fig1][fig4 ] for illustration ) : @xmath39 @xmath40 @xmath41 @xmath42 @xmath43 \\ , .",
    "\\label{c8}\\ ] ] here @xmath44 .",
    "a detailed derivation of the set of integral equations is given in appendix [ ap1 ] .",
    "given the system of integral equations ( [ c5])-([c8 ] ) , the main problem is to find an approximate self - consistent solution to it .",
    "the situation is quite similar to that of the calculation of the equilibrium conductivity in a disordered system @xcite .",
    "there an approximate solution of this system could be found by introducing a proper decomposition of the function @xmath45 , the diffusion propagator , into short- and long - wavelength limit , according to : @xmath46 where @xmath47 was a frequency dependent parameter that could be related to the critical hopping length @xmath48 via the equation : @xmath49 and @xmath50 was an energy dependent function determined by the principle of detailed balance .",
    "this decompostion originated from the notion , that the integrals in the integral equations are governed by products of transition probabilities and diffusion propagators , and , for strongly localized electrons , the latter quantities are short ranged functions as compared to the transition probabilities . using the decomposition ( [ em1 ] ) , the effective medium approximation reduces to the repacement of @xmath45 by @xmath51 in the calculation of the effective transition probability @xmath52 ( eq.([c7 ] ) ) and of the irreducible block @xmath53 ( eq.([c8 ] ) ) .    here in the band - tail problem",
    "we use the same philosophy .",
    "we first decompose the diffusion propagator in two parts , according to : @xmath54 then , to investigate the consequences of this decomposition , we insert eq.([em3 ] ) into eq.([c7 ] ) . performing a partial summation",
    "we obtain : @xmath55 where the renormalized transition probabilities @xmath56 are given by eq.([b7 ] ) , with @xmath57 replaced by : @xmath58 note that the renormalized transition probability depends now on @xmath59 via the function @xmath60 .    at this point",
    "the introduction of the function @xmath60 , the effective medium , still seems to be rather arbitrary .",
    "however , if we now choose the effective medium in such a way , that the integrals over @xmath61 vanish , the renormalized transition probabilities yield the exact solution of the diffusion problem . in that case",
    "the function @xmath53 turns into : @xmath62 so that eq.([c4 ] ) can be cast into the form : @xmath63 therefore the function @xmath64 can be identified with the diffusion propagator .",
    "note , that although the general philosophy is quite the same as in equilibrium , the situation is much more intricate here ,  the principle of detailed balance is absent , since we are dealing with the situation at zero temperature , and so it ca nt determine the energy dependence of the effective medium .",
    "moreover , we expect the critical hopping length to depend somehow on the position of the electron in the tail .",
    "thus , in contrast to equilibrium , @xmath65 is not only a frequency dependent parameter but also an energy dependent function , which has to be determined self - consistently .",
    "for the moment we put aside the question of the determination of the effective medium to elaborate further on the consequences of the renormalization of the transition probabilities . to this end",
    "we focus on the diffusion propagator .    the equation for the diffusion propagator is given by eq.([c1 ] ) .",
    "in effective medium approximation , when calculating the irreducible part @xmath52 , only the lowest order contribution to @xmath52 with respect to @xmath66 is taken into account , so that @xmath67 . in that approximation",
    "the equation for the diffusion propagator in momentum representation reads :    ' '' ''    ' '' ''",
    "@xmath68 of course , as we do nt know how the effective medium looks like so far , and moreover , as the equation is a complicated integral equation , we ca nt find a solution .",
    "the fact , that the effective medium is a function of energy , makes the problem much more complicated .",
    "progress can only by achieved if we can find arguments to simplify the equation considerably . to this end",
    "we focus on the renormalized transition probability .",
    "according to the eqs .",
    "( [ b2 ] ) and ( [ em5 ] ) , it is given by : @xmath69 owing to the step functions in front of the transition probability , the energy integrations are restricted to intervals of length @xmath11 . taking this fact into account the integral equation for the calculation of the diffusion propagator takes the form : @xmath70    further we assume that the diffusion propagator , the transition probability @xmath71 , and the density of states @xmath72 are slowly varying functions on intervals of length @xmath73 , so that the integrand can be expanded with respect to @xmath74 . doing",
    "so we obtain : @xmath75 f\\left ( { \\bf q}|\\varepsilon ^{\\prime } , \\varepsilon \\right ) + \\frac",
    "12% \\omega ^2\\frac \\partial { \\partial \\varepsilon } \\left [ f\\left ( { \\bf q}%     \\label{p4}\\ ] ]    ' '' ''    ' '' ''    2    we terminate the expansion after the first derivative with respect to energy .",
    "this term describes the biased motion of the particle from sites of higher to sites of lower energy . for finite temperatures one would have to replace @xmath76 in the last term with @xmath77 which would describe the energy diffusion current . at zero temperature",
    "there is no input of energy from the phonon - system into the particle .",
    "therefore , we expect the additional term to be rather small , and can be neglected .    to investigate the transport properties ,",
    "we restrict our attention with the long - wavelength limit . in that case",
    "the elastic contribution yields the diffusion coefficient for particle diffusion .",
    "the term , containing the derivative with respect to energy is finite for @xmath78 . if we are interested only in the long - wavelength limit , we can put here @xmath79 , since the remaining terms are of higher order with respect to @xmath8 and @xmath80. since a nonzero momentum in this term couples particle diffusion to energy transport , this approximation corresponds to a decoupling of these two processes .",
    "then , in the long - wavelength limit , we obtain : @xmath81 \\ , ,   \\label{p5}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where : @xmath82 and : @xmath83 eq.([p5 ] ) is easily solved .",
    "it s solution is : @xmath84 \\ , .",
    "\\label{p8}\\ ] ] explicit expressions for the transport coefficients can be found in appendix [ ap2 ] .",
    "now , at this stage , the validity of our quasi - elastic approximation requires , that the second derivative terms are small as compared to terms with first derivatives with respect to energy .",
    "this requirement imposes the following restrictions on the transport coefficients @xmath85 and @xmath86 , the frequency @xmath59 and the momentum @xmath8 : @xmath87 @xmath88 @xmath89 the applicability of the quasi - elastic approximation was also discussed in ref.@xcite .",
    "there it was concluded that this approximation should be inapplicable . to substantiate this statement",
    "numerical calculations were invoked . however , in interpreting these data it has to be taken into account , that they have been obtained using a model , neglecting a weighting of the transition probabilities according to the number of phonons emitted , so that hops between nearly isoenergetic sites were treated as likely as hops from the very top to the very bottom of the tail .",
    "consequently the discussion in ref.@xcite applies only to system with sufficient strong electron - phonon interaction , but not to systems with weak electron - phonon interaction . for extraordinary deep hops to contribute to the diffusion propagator",
    "they should be characteristic for an ensemble of electrons .",
    "this is , however , not expected and in the experimental data , e.g. on amorphous si : h @xcite , not observed . for these reasons the discussion in ref.@xcite does not apply to our model .",
    "before establishing a self - consistency equation , we first elaborate further on the physical content of our diffusion equation . to this end",
    "let us first have a closer look on the coefficients @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "imagine , that we have a particle initially located at ( @xmath92 ) .",
    "then the initial condition is @xmath93 . according to our approximation ,",
    "the motion of the charge carrier is composed of two contributions : particle diffusion between isoenergetic sites , and relaxation in energy space .",
    "characteristics of these two processes are the mean square displacement and the energy relaxation speed .",
    "it turns out , that both can be calculated from the function : @xmath94 \\nonumber \\\\",
    "= \\frac{\\theta \\left ( \\varepsilon _ 0-\\varepsilon \\right ) } { v\\left ( \\varepsilon , s\\right ) } \\exp \\left [ -s\\int\\limits_\\varepsilon ^{\\varepsilon _ 0}\\frac{d\\varepsilon _ 1}{v\\left ( \\varepsilon _ 1,s\\right ) } \\right ] \\ , ,   \\label{pi0}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is just @xmath95 .",
    "we define the mean energy of the particle by : @xmath96 using our diffusion propagator , this equation can be rewritten in the form : @xmath97 and from the diffusion equation we obtain after integration by parts : @xmath98 therefore , in general , the time dependence of the mean energy is given by complicated integrals .",
    "these integrals simplify considerably in two limiting cases : in the absence of dispersive energy transport , and for energy independent @xmath99 . in the absence of dispersive energy transport ,",
    "i.e. in the markovian limit in which the transport coefficients are independent of @xmath59 , the integrals can readly be calculated in time representation . in the latter situation",
    "we simply obtain : @xmath100 where @xmath101 is defined by : @xmath102 therefore we obtain : @xmath103 consequently , @xmath85 is the velocity of energy relaxation , and @xmath104 is the instantenous position of the particle in energy space . in general , however , in disordered systems the coefficient @xmath99 depends on @xmath59 , so that _ energy transport is dispersive_. in that case the integral in eq.([pi11 ] ) can only be calculated easily if @xmath85 is independent of energy .",
    "then , owing to probability conservation , @xmath105 is obtained .",
    "the mean square displacement , defined by : @xmath106 can be obtained from similar arguments . in fourier representation",
    "this equation can be written in the form : @xmath107 the derivative of the diffusion propagator can be calculated using the diffusion equation . doing so , we obtain : @xmath108 again eq.([pi5 ] ) simplifies only in two special cases , in the markovian limit and for energy independent diffusion coefficients .",
    "whereas in the first case @xmath109 is obtained , we have @xmath110 in the latter situation . below",
    "we shall see , that energy independent transport coefficients are obtained for constant density of states only .",
    "so far we have only investigated the consequences of the renormalization . in order to complete the approximation scheme , we still have to calculate the effective medium itself . of course",
    ", we can not calculate the effective medium exactly , since this would amount to find an exact solution to the diffusion problem .",
    "rather we shall try to calculate @xmath60 self - consistently .",
    "the transport coefficients are properties of the green s function @xmath45 , the diffusion propagator .",
    "thus , in order to find an equation for @xmath111 we should relate the transport coefficients to @xmath52 , the irreducible part of the diffusion propagator .",
    "the diffusion coefficient comprises only elastic contributions , however , in the relaxation problem a proper description of inelastic processes is vital .",
    "moreover , as shown in the previuos section , the characteristics for particle and energy transport can already be calculated from the function @xmath112 , the @xmath78 limit of the diffusion propagator .",
    "therefore , in establishing a self - consistency equation we should focus on those characteristics that are important in that limit , that is the energy relaxation speed @xmath85 .",
    "the equation for the diffusion propagator for @xmath79 is given by : @xmath113 if we compare eq.([sc1 ] ) with eq.([p5 ] ) we deduce that @xmath114 now we decompose @xmath85 , as defined in eq.([sc2 ] ) , into two parts , one part that contains only the effective medium approximation of @xmath52 : @xmath115 and a part @xmath116 , that contains the deviations @xmath117 .",
    "self - consistency requires : @xmath118 @xmath119 , as defined by eq.([sc3 ] ) , is in accordance with the definition ( [ p7 ] ) , taking into account eq.([t3 ] ) and the inequality @xmath120 ( eq . ( [ p11 ] ) ) ,",
    "owing to which contributions proportional to this parameter are negligible .",
    "we now focus on the self - consistency equation ( [ sc4 ] ) . while eq.([sc3 ] ) contains only the effective medium contribution to the diffusion propagator , @xmath121 is a functional of the effective medium @xmath65 and the deviation @xmath66 . by construction ,",
    "it is at least linear in @xmath66 .",
    "if this equation could be solved exactly , an exact solution to the diffusion problem could be found within quasi - elastic accuracy . in practise",
    "this is not possible , and , therefore , we depend on further approximations . to simplify this equation ,",
    "we take into account only the lowest order contributions to this equation with respect to @xmath66 , i.e. we linearize @xmath121 with respect to @xmath66 and require that the first order contribution vanishes .",
    "this approach is quite close to the usual cpa - philosophy , in which vanishing of the t - matrix is required in its lowest order approximation . using this procedure",
    "we obtain the following self - consistency equation : @xmath122 where @xmath123 and @xmath124 are simply numbers .",
    "a detailed derivation of this equation is given in appendix [ ap3 ] .",
    "in deriving the self - consistency equations we have imposed further restrictions on the effective transition probabilities , which determine the range of its applicability .",
    "these restrictions can be formulated most conviniently using the dimensionless critical hopping length @xmath125 , related to @xmath111 by ( see appendix [ ap2 ] ) : @xmath126 in terms of @xmath127 , the inequalities ( [ p11 ] ) and ( [ p12 ] ) , used in the derivation , read ( prime is derivative with respect to @xmath128 ) : @xmath129 @xmath130 in addition , when calculating the integrals , @xmath131 was used .    a closed solution to the self - consistency equation",

    "the latter equations can , in principle , be obtained from our leading equation ( [ b11 ] ) by neglecting statistical correlation , so as to average every factor independently .",
    "using our effective - medium method , we have investigated the relaxation of charge carriers in band tails at @xmath1 . according to our results ,",
    "energy relaxation is connected with dispersional transport .",
    "even if we have no real diffusion in the system , since the temperature is zero , we have some spreading of the energy distribution with time . for a constant density of states",
    "the situation is completely equivalent to the one in the problem of the electron s motion in a disordered system , subjected to an electric field @xcite .",
    "the main difference between the above mentioned problem and the energy relaxation is in that , while in the former case the sites are distributed homogeneously in space , in the energy relaxation problem the density of states is a decaying function of energy for most physical systems . in this situation",
    "we arrive at the picture that the particles of a package with lower energies move slower than particles with higher energy .",
    "this leads to the opposite tendency : at first , there is a slowing of the package spreading .",
    "the time dependence of the dispersion , being linear at the first stage of the evolution , is later slowing down . later on ,",
    "different possibilities exist , dependend on the particular type of the energy dependence of the density of states .",
    "we performed a detailed investigation for the exponential density of states for two time regimes .",
    "if the variation of the velocity @xmath85 in the energy space across the distribution is smaller than the velocity itself , that is if @xmath266 , we arrive at the situation of a package , moving steadily down along the energy axis without any deformation .",
    "dispersion becomes time independent ( see eq.([aes7 ] ) ) .",
    "however , since the particles are sinking down this condition becomes violated when time goes by .",
    "the parameter @xmath267 , being small at the first stage of the evolution , is getting large .",
    "when this parameter is larger than one , the steady motion condition becomes violated again .",
    "the package , being of gaussian form before , undergoes some restructuring to another , non - gaussian stable form , with its width lower than before by some numeric factor of the order of 1 ( eq.([dlt6 ] ) ) . in our pictures , figs [ fig7]-[fig10 ] , it is clearly seen , that the package becomes non - gaussian .",
    "this result remains valid until the very moment the quasi - elasticity conditions break down ( @xmath268 ) .    for the exponential density of states",
    "we have found the packet to move as @xmath269 , i.e. , its motion is strongly slowing down with time , the packet becomes , roughly speaking , almost stopped .",
    "this type of behaviour may be called `` glassy '' , because of the overall time scale for the packet evolution ( governed by the exponential function of the large parameter @xmath270 ) , becomes huge .",
    "for example , when @xmath271 , this time scale approaches @xmath272 and more ( see fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] ) !    the main simplification used in our paper is the quasi - elastic approximation .",
    "this approximation relies on the smallness of the upper bound of the energy transfer to the phonon system by one hop . for localized electrons",
    ", this upper bound can be much smaller as the debye energy of the host material , since not all phonons can interact with localized electrons equally well . for localized electrons the electron phonon coupling constant approaches zero , for phonons with wave - vector @xmath273 . thus high energetic phonons are less effective",
    ". only phonons with energies @xmath274 , where @xmath123 is the lattice constant of the host material , are effective .",
    "furthermore , in disordered systems the high energetic acustical phonons are localized , and thus need not contribute to transport by necessity . nevertheless , the question whether the quasi - elastic approximation is applicable depends much on the material of interest .",
    "if , however , we compare our result for the time dependence of the mean energy ( [ aes8 ] ) in an exponential density of states with those existing in the literature @xcite , we also find agreement for @xmath275 , which indicates that our results are , at least qualitatively , of wider validity .",
    "unfortunately , to our knowledge , in the literature there are no further results on the width of the energy distribution available to compare with .",
    "from our point of view the main question remained open is how the results , obtained for the exponential density of states , may be generalized for other types of energy dependencies .",
    "one can imagine , e.g. , that for densities of states decaying with decreasing energy slower than exponential , the dispersion is growing , but under some sublinear law .",
    "also , in the opposite case , in a density of states decaying faster than exponential , we would possibly have a dispersion tending to zero for large times .",
    "it should , however , also be mentioned that it is not completely clear under which situation zero temperature results can be applied to systems at finite temperature . in our approach",
    "we assumed that @xmath1 .",
    "however , in a real system , when the carriers are sinking down , the criterion for the temperature to be treated as zero , is violated at every finite value of @xmath276 at some moment of time , since the contribution of hops to sites with higher energy values becomes more and more comparable with one of downward hops .",
