    "in this note we present an explicit construction of a relative packing .",
    "the subject of symplectic packing was introduced first in the seminal work of gromov @xcite .",
    "gromov showed that looking at symplectic embeddings of a standard ball into a symplectic manifold , one may obtain an upper bound on the radius of a ball which is stronger than the obstruction coming from the volume .",
    "the first theorem in this direction is a non - squeezing theorem from @xcite .",
    "this result has led to the definition of the gromov capacity , which plays an important role in modern symplectic geometry .",
    "later the subject of symplectic packing was treated by biran , karshon , mcduff , polterovich , schlenk , traynor and others , see @xcite .",
    "new obstructions for symplectic packings of various domains were found . on the other hand",
    ", attempts were made to find explicit constructions of certain symplectic embeddings , in order to show that the obstructions , which were found , are tight ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this note is devoted to proving a new result in this direction .",
    "recently , biran and cornea @xcite found new obstructions on the relative symplectic packing in a number of situations , which are stronger than those in the case of a usual packing . in this note",
    "we consider one specific example from @xcite , and show that the corresponding obstruction is sharp .",
    "let us define first the notion of a relative symplectic packing .",
    "consider a symplectic manifold @xmath1 and a closed lagrangian submanifold @xmath2 .",
    "take a standard open ball @xmath3 of radius @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is endowed with coordinates @xmath6 , and set @xmath7 a relative packing of @xmath8 into @xmath9 is by definition a symplectic embedding @xmath10 such that @xmath11 .    in this note",
    "we treat the situation where @xmath12 and @xmath13 is the standard clifford torus in @xmath14 . here , @xmath15 is normalized so that @xmath16 . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that given a relative packing @xmath17 there is an upper bound for the radius of this ball : @xmath18 .",
    "our main result is the following .",
    "[ t : pack example ] for every @xmath19 there exists a relative packing @xmath20    let us mention that in @xcite , the authors also consider relative packings into @xmath21 by more than one ball , and obtain obstructions on their radii .",
    "the case of three balls was treated , and is strongly connected to the properties of the quantum cup - product in floer homology .",
    "the hypothetical upper bound in this case was found , under the assumption of existence of pseudo - holomorphic discs with certain properties . it still remains to show the existence of such discs , and in the case that it will be proved , one can try to find the example which proves the tightness of this upper bound .",
    "the rest of the paper is devoted to proving theorem  [ t : pack example ] . in section  [ s : constrover ]",
    "we show how to reduce theorem  [ t : pack example ] to a two - dimensional problem .",
    "section  [ s : proofs ] contains the proof of theorem  [ t : pack example ] .",
    "it is well - known that the open symplectic manifold @xmath22 is symplectomorphic to the unit ball @xmath23 . identifying @xmath24",
    ", we have a natural action of the torus @xmath25 on @xmath26 .",
    "the moment map of this action is given by @xmath27    the action of @xmath28 , restricted to the complement @xmath29 of the union of the two complex axes is free , and therefore , by a standard procedure , we obtain that @xmath29 is symplectomorphic to @xmath30 . here",
    "we use the notation @xmath31    look now at @xmath32 and its subset @xmath33 , where @xmath34 the above symplectomorphism between @xmath29 and @xmath30 induces a symplectic embedding @xmath35 from now on we will consider @xmath36 as @xmath37 @xmath38 and the symplectic form is @xmath39 the clifford torus lies entirely in @xmath40 , and its pre - image under the map @xmath41 equals to @xmath42 fix @xmath19 and consider @xmath43 the construction is based on finding a certain area - preserving map @xmath44 given such an @xmath45 , we define @xmath46 as @xmath47 our aim is to find @xmath45 such that the image of @xmath48 under the map @xmath49 will be contained in @xmath50 , and also @xmath51",
    "given @xmath19 , we describe a construction of a relative symplectic embedding @xmath52 as it was shown in section  [ s : constrover ] , it is enough to find a symplectic embedding @xmath53 such that its image will be contained in the domain @xmath54          take @xmath66 , and consider the corresponding map @xmath45 .",
    "then for any @xmath67 , such that @xmath68 , define @xmath47 we claim that the resulting map @xmath69 satisfies the desired properties .",
    "first of all , it is clear that the map @xmath49 is a symplectic embedding , and the pre - image of @xmath70 equals @xmath71 .",
    "let us show that , moreover , the image of @xmath49 lies in the domain @xmath72      the presented relative packing construction can be naturally generalized to the corresponding construction of a relative packing of a ball @xmath78 into @xmath79 , for any @xmath80 and radius @xmath81 .",
