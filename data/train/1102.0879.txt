    "thus , it is not expected that the known quark mixing pattern is transmitted to the lepton sector in the exactly same form . nevertheless , a key point inferred from eq .",
    "( [ massratio ] ) is that the mass spectrum of the charged leptons exhibits a similar hierarchical pattern to that of the down - type quarks , unlike that of the up - type quarks which shows a much stronger hierarchical pattern .",

    "then the up - type quark mixing matrix @xmath108 can be approximated as @xmath109 which indicates that the mixing in the up - type quark sector does not affect the leading order contributions in @xmath110 .",
    "it leads to the fact that the cabbibo angle should arise from the mixing between the first and second generations in the down - type quark sector .      the empirical relation ( [ vus ] )",
