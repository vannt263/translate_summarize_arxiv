    "the interaction region between the solar wind and ambient ism has been the subject of hydrodynamic modeling efforts @xcite since around the time of the first _ in situ _ observations of the solar wind by _",
    "mariner  2 _ @xcite and by _ luna  2 _ @xcite . as shown in figure  1 , this interaction results in a large scale structure for the heliosphere that consists of three boundaries : the termination shock ( ts ) , where the solar wind is shocked to subsonic speeds ; the bow shock ( bs ) , where the ism flow is shocked to subsonic speeds ; and in between the two the heliopause ( hp ) , which separates the plasma flows of the fully ionized solar wind and partially ionized ism .",
    "reviews of the history of heliospheric modeling include @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .    _",
    "voyager  1 _ recently encountered the ts at a distance of 94  au from the sun in roughly the upwind direction relative to the ism flow @xcite .",
    "however , the locations of the more distant hp and bs remain observationally uncertain . in general , there are very few observational constraints for the properties of the heliosphere beyond the ts .",
    "one of the few exceptions is heliospheric ly@xmath0 absorption , which is observable in _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) spectra of nearby stars .    unlike the ionized component of the ism",
    ", the neutrals in the ism can penetrate into all regions of the heliosphere .",
    "charge exchange processes involving these neutrals create populations of hot h  i that permeate the heliosphere , and it is these neutrals that produce absorption signatures in stellar ly@xmath0 lines observed by hst . for most lines of sight , the absorption is dominated by h  i in the so - called `` hydrogen wall '' region in between the hp and bs @xcite , but in downwind directions absorption from heliosheath neutrals , created by charge exchange between the ts and hp , can be paramount @xcite .",
    "the heliospheric absorption is only detectable when the ism absorption for the observed line of sight is not too broad to obscure the absorption . in upwind directions",
    "the interstellar h  i column density ( in @xmath4 ) must be @xmath5 to detect heliospheric absorption , but in downwind directions one must have @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "astrospheric absorption from the wind - ism interaction region surrounding the observed star can also sometimes be detected .    starting with @xcite",
    ", there have been many attempts to use the ly@xmath0 absorption observations to test heliospheric models .",
    "the hydrodynamic models are generally quite successful in reproducing the observed amount of absorption , especially in upwind directions where the hydrogen wall accounts for most of it @xcite .",
    "the ly@xmath0 absorption therefore represents a convincing detection of the hydrogen wall , and a validation of the models that predicted it even before it was detected by hst .",
    "however , the exact amount of absorption predicted by the models is dependent on the parameters that are assumed for the local interstellar cloud ( lic ) in which the sun resides @xcite .",
    "some aspects of the ambient ism are known very well , such as the lic flow speed and direction ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but others are not known as precisely .",
    "thus , there has been hope that the ly@xmath0 absorption can help constrain certain properties of the ism .",
    "@xcite , for example , experimented with numerous different models assuming different combinations of ism proton and h  i densities . the absorption predicted by the models does vary with the input parameters , but the absorption diagnostic seems to have only a modest sensitivity to most input parameters of interest , making it difficult to simply define a range of parameters that are consistent with the data .",
    "the dependence of the predicted absorption on the nature of the hydrodynamic code used in the modeling is also a problem @xcite .",
    "the source of this difficulty lies in the complexity of h  i velocity distributions within the heliosphere , which are non - maxwellian ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) and therefore can only be modeled with fully kinetic or complex multi - fluid codes .",
    "all of the models that have been compared with the data in the past have been 2-dimensional , axisymmetric models . recently , 3-dimensional mhd models have become available that are capable of considering the effects of the ism magnetic field on heliospheric structure , while still maintaining a sufficiently sophisticated treatment of the neutrals to properly consider them and the plasma in a self - consistent manner @xcite .",
    "figure  1 presents results of calculations made with a 3d kinetic mhd model of the heliosphere by @xcite .",
    "it shows that the inclusion of even a modest ism field can indeed affect the shape of the global heliosphere .",
    "we will determine here whether this also has significant effects on the ly@xmath0 absorption .",
    "the nature of the magnetic field in the ism immediately outside the heliosphere is poorly known , so we will also assess the sensitivity of the ly@xmath0 absorption to changes in the assumed ism field strength and orientation . in doing so , we consider many more hst - observed lines of sight than have been used in prior data - model comparisons .",
    "the amount of heliospheric ly@xmath0 absorption depends greatly on the direction of the observed line of sight .",
    "the greatest spatial dependence is on the poloidal angle @xmath7 between the line of sight and the upwind direction of the ism flow .",
    "clearly it is advantageous to consider many different lines of sight with a wide variety of @xmath7 s in comparing the heliospheric absorption predicted by models with the data . considering a variety of directions",
    "is even more important when testing 3d mhd models , which can yield heliospheric structures that are not axisymmetric and therefore will have absorption predictions that are dependent on the azimuthal angle as well as being dependent on @xmath7 ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "past data - model comparisons considered no more than six hst - observed lines of sight , which individually have either provided real detections of heliospheric absorption or merely upper limits @xcite .",
    "this is a rather small number of lines of sight even for testing axisymmetric models , let alone the 3d ones .",
    "however , the number of heliospheric absorption detections has recently increased significantly @xcite , so it is well worthwhile to reassess the sample of available hst data to select a larger sample of spectra to test the 3d kinetic mhd models .",
    "@xcite provide a complete list of hst - observed ly@xmath0 spectra that are appropriate for our purposes , all of which have been analyzed to measure ism h  i column densities , to search for evidence of heliospheric / astrospheric absorption , and to measure stellar ly@xmath0 fluxes corrected for the contaminating ism absorption .",
    "figure  2 is a sky map in ecliptic coordinates of lines of sight with a stellar ly@xmath0 line observed by hst .",
    "all these spectra have sufficient spectral resolution to permit a reasonably precise search for heliospheric absorption .",
    "the boxes indicate the 11 lines of sight that actually yield detections of heliospheric absorption .",
    "all the other lines of sight yield nondetections .    many of the detections are clustered around the upwind direction of the ism flow",
    ". the advantageous nature of upwind lines of sight for detecting heliospheric absorption is consistent with model predictions , which suggest that the deceleration of h  i in the hydrogen wall relative to the ism flow should be largest in these directions .",
    "this results in a greater separation of the heliospheric absorption from that of the ism , thereby making it easier to detect heliospheric absorption in upwind lines of sight @xcite .",
    "there is also a cluster of three detections very close to the downwind direction .",
    "initial analysis of these ly@xmath0 spectra did _ not _ yield detections @xcite .",
    "however , we have found that the stellar ly@xmath0 profiles reconstructed for @xmath8 lines of sight are systematically blueshifted from the stellar rest frames , indicating the presence of very broad , shallow absorption on the red side of the ly@xmath0 profiles @xcite .",
    "this is the exactly the sort of absorption signature one expects from heliosheath neutrals ( as opposed to hydrogen wall neutrals ) .",
    "since very downwind lines of sight looking down the tail of the heliosphere will have very long path lengths through the heliosheath , it is in the most downwind lines of sight where one might expect to see this broad absorption .",
    "thus , we now consider these three lines of sight to have detections of heliospheric absorption , though the nature of these detections is rather different from the others .",
    "our goal is to select a sample of hst - observed lines of sight from figure  2 to use for comparing observed and predicted heliospheric ly@xmath0 absorption .",
    "obviously we start by choosing the 11 detections , which actually provide quantitative measurements of the absorption .",
    "we add to these detections nine nondetections ( diamonds in fig .",
    "2 ) that at least provide upper limits for the amount of absorption that might be present in those directions .",
    "these nondetections are chosen to sample parts of the sky not covered by the detections .",
    "another major selection criterion is ism h  i column density .",
    "lines of sight with low ism column densities are preferable since they provide more restrictive upper limits on heliospheric absorption .",
    "data quality ( i.e. , resolution , signal - to - noise ) also plays a role in choosing which nondetections to consider .",
    "numbered symbols in figure  2 indicate the final sample of 20 lines of sight to be used in our data - model comparisons .",
    "the stellar identifications of these lines of sight are indicated in figures  3 and 4 , along with the ly@xmath0 spectra , which are displayed in order of increasing @xmath7 .",
    "we focus only on the red side of the ly@xmath0 absorption profile , where the heliospheric absorption resides .",
    "the fluxes are normalized to the intrinsic stellar ly@xmath0 profile reconstructed in the original analysis of the data .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite and references therein to see the full ly@xmath0 spectra and descriptions of their analysis .",
    "the dotted green lines in the figure show only the ism absorption based on these analyses . for the heliospheric absorption detections ,",
    "there is excess absorption observed beyond that from the ism .",
    "successful heliospheric models should predict the right amount of excess absorption to fit the data for these lines of sight . for the nondetections ,",
    "the ism absorption fits the data reasonably well . in these cases",
    ", successful heliospheric models should predict essentially no significant absorption beyond that from the ism .",
    "the three @xmath8 detections ( # 18#20 in figs .",
    "24 ) are special cases , as mentioned above .",
    "the original reconstructed stellar ly@xmath0 profiles suggest no heliospheric absorption , but the blueshifts of these profiles away from their stellar rest frames implies that these profiles are inaccurate .",
    "we can infer the amount of heliospheric absorption in these directions by constructing a stellar profile forced to be centered on the stellar radial velocity and then seeing how much of the red wing of that profile must be absorbed to yield the original profile .",
    "the shaded regions in figure  3 for these three downwind lines of sight indicate this excess absorption , where the uncertainties are estimated by allowing the stellar radial velocity to be @xmath9 km  s@xmath10 from its measured value . this excess absorption can not be extended to lower velocities closer to the center of the ly@xmath0 line because near line center",
    "stellar ly@xmath0 profiles can not be assumed to be symmetric and centered on the stellar rest frame .",
    "stellar ly@xmath0 profiles often have self - reversals near line center , which are often asymmetric . for details about all of this , see @xcite .",
    "the important thing to note here is that for these three very downwind lines of sight , the absorption predicted by the models should _ not _ fit the data but should instead fall within the shaded regions .    finally , the requirement that the intrinsic stellar ly@xmath0 profile be within @xmath9 km  s@xmath10 of the stellar rest frame allows us to compute upper limits for the amount of broad heliosheath absorption that can be present for lines of sight without detected heliospheric absorption .",
    "thick dashed lines in figure  3 show these upper absorption limits , but only for downwind lines of sight ( @xmath11 ) where the broad heliosheath absorption is potentially prominent .",
    "absorption predictions from the models must lie above these limits to be consistent with the data .",
    "the dashed lines can not be extended to low velocities close to line center for the same reason that the shaded regions of the @xmath8 lines of sight are limited to the wings of the line ( see above ) .",
    "figures 3 and 4 compare the hst ly@xmath0 data with the heliospheric absorption predicted by 3d kinetic mhd models of the heliospheric interface @xcite , assuming various directions and magnitudes for the ism field .",
    "the models used here are of the type initially developed by @xcite , with a fully kinetic treatment of neutral hydrogen within the heliosphere to provide the most precise computations of the velocity distribution functions of the neutrals .",
    "@xcite expanded the 2d axisymmetric baranov & malama code to a fully 3d geometry , and also added the capability of including an interstellar magnetic field in the model .",
    "the code separates all heliospheric h atoms into several populations : 1 .",
    "original interstellar atoms and other atoms originating outside of the bow shock , 2 .",
    "secondary interstellar atoms originating between the bow shock and heliopause , 3 .",
    "atoms originating between the heliopause and termination shock , and 4 .",
    "atoms originating in the supersonic solar wind . we calculate number densities , temperatures , and bulk velocities for these populations along the lines of sight toward the observed stars by taking moments of the velocity distributions .",
    "the heliospheric absorption for each line of sight is computed from these traces of density , temperature , and flow velocity . with this methodology",
    ", we are making the approximation that the velocity distribution functions of the individual populations are locally maxwellian .",
    "the nature of the interstellar magnetic field surrounding the sun is poorly known , though some observational constraints exist .",
    "the global galactic field has a magnitude of @xmath12  @xmath2 g and is directed towards a galactic longitude of @xmath13 , but there is substantial local variability @xcite , meaning that the actual local field could be significantly higher or lower and could be in a completely different direction .    a @xmath14 discrepancy exists between the flow vectors of interstellar he and h within the solar system , and",
    "the most promising explanation for this is that the lic s magnetic field is skewed with respect to the ism flow seen by the sun , which can deflect the flow of interstellar hydrogen atoms in the heliosphere @xcite .",
    "helium atoms are not affected in this manner , since their charge exchange cross sections are much lower than hydrogen and they are therefore effectively blind to the presence of the heliosphere . if correct , this interpretation identifies a plane in which the ism field must lie , which happens to be inconsistent with the orientation of the global galactic field . @xcite",
    "have argued that an ism field that is @xmath15 from the apparent flow direction can potentially explain _",
    "voyager  1 _ and _ 2 _ observations of energetic particles flowing inwards from the ts .",
    "the satellites have both seen these particles , but flowing in opposite directions .",
    "@xcite demonstrate that asymmetries in the heliospheric structure induced by a skewed ism magnetic field can potentially cause this effect , thanks in part to the satellites positions on opposite sides of the ecliptic plane .",
    "a magnetic field much stronger than the global galactic field has been proposed to explain an apparent pressure imbalance between the hot , ionized plasma that dominates the local bubble and the warm , partially neutral clouds that lie within it .",
    "the local bubble , the cavity in which the sun resides @xcite , is believed to account for much of the soft x - ray background radiation ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "these x - rays seem to suggest thermal pressures of @xmath16 @xmath17  k @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the lic and other warm clouds within the local bubble appear to have much lower pressures of @xmath18 @xmath17  k @xcite .",
    "such a large pressure imbalance within the local ism seems unlikely .",
    "one way out of this dilemma is to propose that the lic is supported by a strong magnetic field of order 7  @xmath2 g @xcite .",
    "this would seem to be disallowed by heliospheric models , which imply that such large magnetic pressures would force the termination shock well inside the 94  au distance measured by _",
    "voyager  1 _ @xcite .",
    "the only way to avoid this problem is for the field to be nearly parallel to the ism flow .",
    "however , this would contradict the evidence mentioned above that the lic field is _ not _ parallel to to the lic flow ( i.e. , the discrepant h and he flow vectors within the solar system , and the opposite flow directions of termination shock particles observed by _ voyager  1 _ and _ 2 _ ) .",
    "thus , large fields are still difficult to reconcile with heliospheric observations and models .",
    "an alternative solution to the local bubble pressure problem is that the pressures normally estimated from the soft x - ray emission are too high for various reasons : contamination from heliospheric foreground emission @xcite , contamination from x - ray emission from the walls of the local bubble @xcite , and improper assumption of collisional ionization equilibrium @xcite .",
    "most of our models are computed assuming a modest magnetic field of @xmath19  @xmath2 g , which can compress the ts somewhat depending on the field orientation , but not enough to be inconsistent with the _ voyager  1 _ encounter distance of 94  au ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "we assume that the magnetic field is oriented within the plane suggested by @xcite .",
    "figure  3 shows the absorption predicted by models with different field orientations within this plane , for angles ranging from parallel to the ism flow ( @xmath20 ) to perpendicular to the ism flow ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "table  1 lists the ecliptic and galactic coordinates that correspond to these field directions .",
    "figure  4 shows the absorption predictions for three models with @xmath22 , but with different field strengths of 0 , 1.25 , and 2.5  @xmath2 g .",
    "the ism hydrogen and proton densities assumed in these models are @xmath23 @xmath17 and @xmath24 @xmath17 , the ism flow speed is @xmath25 km  s@xmath10 , and the temperature is @xmath26  k @xcite .",
    "figure  3 shows that in upwind directions , where most of the heliospheric detections lie , the absorption decreases with increasing @xmath0 .",
    "to better illustrate this behavior , figure  5 plots the absorbed ly@xmath0 flux predicted by the figure  3 models versus @xmath0 .",
    "no one model clearly fits the data better than all the others , presumably due to the absorption dependence on @xmath0 being only a modest one .",
    "this also may be indicative of the systematic uncertainties in the estimation of the ism absorption .",
    "the 61  vir line of sight seems particularly discrepant .",
    "this is probably due to difficulties in removing geocoronal emission blended with the red side of the ly@xmath0 absorption line ( see fig .  1 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so this line of sight should be regarded with caution .",
    "the @xmath27 and @xmath21 models underestimate the absorption in all upwind directions ( see figs .  3 and 5 ) , so perhaps these models should be considered inconsistent with the data .",
    "if one ignores the problematic 61  vir line of sight , the @xmath20 model is a worse fit to the data than the @xmath28 for all but the 36  oph line of sight . considering the evidence described above that the ism field is skewed from the flow direction",
    ", @xmath20 seems unlikely anyway .",
    "thus , we consider @xmath28 to represent the most likely field orientations for the local ism , which overlaps the @xmath15 range quoted by @xcite .    these conclusions are based on @xmath19  @xmath2 g models , but figure  4 shows that assuming @xmath29  @xmath2 g does not change the absorption very much .",
    "thus , at least for these low - to - moderate field strengths our conclusions concerning @xmath0 are relatively sound .",
    "however , figure  4 shows that decreasing the field all the way to zero does change the absorption , with the absorption being somewhat higher in upwind directions .",
    "the greater amount of absorption upwind is somewhat surprising considering that the hydrogen wall is narrower for @xmath30 ( see fig .  1 )",
    ". however , the inclusion of even a modest ism field weakens the bow shock and lowers the h  i density in the hydrogen wall , more than offsetting the broader width of the wall .",
    "it should be stated that definitive conclusions are difficult to make at this point since the ly@xmath0 absorption is at least somewhat sensitive to other input parameters , such as the assumed ism densities and temperature that also have observational uncertainties @xcite , though not nearly as large as those involving the magnetic field .",
    "a time - consuming thorough exploration of parameter space would be necessary to fully characterize the constraints on ism properties provided by the ly@xmath0 data .",
    "we have focused so far on comparing the models with data in upwind directions , where absorption from the hydrogen wall is dominant .",
    "any conclusions drawn from downwind directions , where heliosheath absorption is more prominent , will be far more tentative .",
    "the primary reason for this is that the grid used for our current models only extends 500  au from the sun , which is not nearly far enough to capture all of the heliosheath absorption for @xmath31 .",
    "thus , the absorption predictions shown in figures  3 and 4 for these directions will underestimate the amount of absorption that the models would really predict if the grid were extended further downwind .",
    "many of the models seem to predict too much absorption downwind even with the limited grid extent , particularly in the velocity range of @xmath32 km  s@xmath10 .",
    "but there is another potential difficulty with downwind absorption that concerns the treatment of the plasma in the models .",
    "although a fully kinetic treatment is applied to the neutrals , the plasma is assumed to be a single maxwellian fluid throughout the heliosphere",
    ". however , this is clearly a poor approximation , since pickup ions , for example , have non - maxwellian velocity distributions and are not thermalized with the solar wind inside the termination shock ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite have replaced the simple single - fluid plasma treatment in the 2d baranov & malama code with a complex multi - component representation of the plasma .",
    "this more sophisticated plasma treatment does not result in significantly different hydrogen wall absorption in upwind directions , but we have found that is _ does _ result in a significant reduction in heliosheath absorption which can potentially alleviate the problems these models have in predicting too much downwind absorption @xcite .",
    "the most meaningful comparison with the data in downwind directions would therefore require that our 3d models also utilize such a multi - component plasma treatment , as well as having grids that extend far enough downwind to capture all the heliosheath absorption .",
    "we leave such computationally intensive modeling for a future paper .",
    "we note that asymmetries in the heliospheric structure induced by the ism field are evident in the downwind absorption predicted by the models .",
    "for example , there is significant model dependence in the absorption towards dk  uma ( @xmath33 ) , but no significant model dependence towards @xmath34  cet ( @xmath35 ) . since @xmath7 is similar for these stars but their azimuthal angles quite different ( see fig .",
    "2 ) , this difference in behavior must be due to azimuthal variability , which can only be due to magnetic field induced asymmetries ( see  3.3 ) .",
    "finally , we note that @xcite have also developed 3d mhd heliospheric models that treat neutrals in a self - consistent manner with the plasma .",
    "this code uses a less sophisticated 2-fluid treatment for the neutral h velocity distributions , but it includes the effects of the interplanetary magnetic field on heliospheric structure as well as the ism field .",
    "absorption has been computed for a limited number of these models , yielding results qualitatively similar to those reported here , with absorption decreasing with both @xmath0 and the magnetic field strength @xcite .",
    "like @xcite , @xcite demonstrate that the 3d mhd models can potentially reproduce the shift between the h and he flows observed within the solar system @xcite , though they emphasize that the magnitude of the shift depends not only on the strength and orientation of the magnetic field , but also on the ism neutral hydrogen density .",
    "figure  1 illustrates that even a modest ism field can result in a heliospheric structure that is significantly asymmetric , consistent with other models that also predict asymmetries of this sort @xcite . in the bottom half of figure  1 ,",
    "the heliosheath ( between the ts and hp ) is narrower than in the upper half , but the hydrogen wall ( between the hp and bs ) is wider .",
    "one might imagine that this would result in corresponding ly@xmath0 absorption asymmetries .",
    "in other words , the ly@xmath0 absorption should be azimuthally dependent as well as @xmath7 dependent .",
    "some evidence that the models do indeed predict azimuthally dependent absorption in downwind directions is mentioned in  3.2 . however , in order to properly quantify the degree of absorption asymmetry expected based on the models , it is necessary to compare absorption predictions for lines of sight with identical @xmath7 values but different azimuthal angles ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "this can not be easily done with the set of observed directions in figures  34 , which are scattered randomly about the sky .",
    "thus , in figure  6 we show the heliospheric ly@xmath0 absorption predicted by the @xmath19  @xmath2 g , @xmath22 model for various @xmath36 angles , with @xmath7 fixed in the five panels of the figure .",
    "the azimuthal angle is defined such that @xmath37 and @xmath38 are in the plane of the ism magnetic field .",
    "this is the plane in which the heliospheric structure is portrayed in figure  1 .",
    "the @xmath37 direction would be associated with the upper half of figure  1 , and @xmath38 would be associated with the lower half .    in general , the hydrogen wall will be responsible for the steep , saturated absorption edges of the absorption profiles in figure  6 , which are particularly prominent in upwind directions ( e.g. , located at 2030 km  s@xmath10 in the @xmath39 panel ) , while the heliosheath is responsible for the broad , unsaturated absorption wings that extend to high velocities , which become more prominent in downwind directions .",
    "very little @xmath36 dependence is apparent in upwind directions .",
    "this is a bit surprising given the hydrogen wall asymmetries apparent in figure  1 .",
    "however , it turns out that azimuthal density variations in the hydrogen wall offset the azimuthal width dependence .",
    "for example , although the hydrogen wall is narrower for @xmath37 ( corresponding to the upper half of fig .",
    "1 ) than for @xmath38 ( corresponding to the lower half of fig .  1 ) , this is offset by higher hydrogen wall densities in the @xmath37 direction , so integrated h  i column densities are actually not very different .",
    "figure  6 shows that for @xmath40 , the particularly narrow hydrogen wall at @xmath37 results in somewhat less hydrogen wall absorption than other directions , but the difference is so small it would be very difficult to detect in practice .",
    "in contrast , the heliosheath is thicker at @xmath37 and figure  6 shows that this does in fact lead to the broad heliosheath absorption being significantly stronger in this direction than others , though it is only in downwind directions ( @xmath41 ) where this azimuthal dependence becomes potentially detectable . as discussed in  3.2 , actual comparisons with the data",
    "are currently problematic in these directions .",
    "the asymmetries seen for the @xmath42 and @xmath43 surely extend to @xmath44 as well , but figure  6 does not show this due to the limited grid extent of the models . according to figure  6 , the heliosheath absorption is at a minimum in directions normal to the plane of the ism field ( @xmath45 and @xmath46 ) , indicative of magnetic compression of the heliosphere in those directions , leading to shorter distances through the heliosheath for those lines of sight .",
    "we have compared h  i ly@xmath0 absorption profiles predicted by 3d kinetic mhd models of the heliosphere with a large selection of ly@xmath0 lines observed by hst , including many lines of sight with detected heliospheric absorption . the primary purpose of this comparison is to assess the sensitivity of the predicted absorption to changes in the ism magnetic field properties assumed in the model .",
    "our results are as follows :    1 . :",
    ":    we find that the h  i ly@xmath0 absorption has a modest    sensitivity to both the strength and orientation of the ism magnetic    field .",
    "focusing on upwind directions where most of the hst detections    of heliospheric absorption reside , the models presented here with    @xmath1  @xmath2 g and    @xmath3 appear to provide the best fits to    the data , consistent with constraints from other sources ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ;    * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "2 . : :    however , since the ly@xmath0 absorption is sensitive to    other model input parameters , such as the ism h  i density , which have    not been varied here , the region of parameter space that yields    acceptable fits to the data will be complex",
    ". it will be very    difficult , perhaps impossible , for the ly@xmath0    absorption by itself to yield a unique set of model input parameters    that fit the data .",
    "nevertheless , the dependence of the absorption on    many ism parameters means that the absorption does provide one    constraint on heliospheric models that is worthy of consideration in    assessing how precisely the models reproduce reality .",
    "3 . : :    the models show that an ism field that is skewed with respect to the    ism flow vector results in substantial azimuthal asymmetries in the    heliospheric hydrogen wall . surprisingly , these asymmetries do not    result in significant asymmetries in ly@xmath0 absorption    from the hydrogen wall , since densities within the wall vary in such a    way as to cancel out the effects of the spatial asymmetries on    hydrogen wall column densities .",
    ":    the models also show that a skewed ism field results in significant    azimuthal asymmetries in the heliosheath , and unlike the hydrogen wall    these asymmetries _ do _ yield significant azimuthal absorption    dependence , at least in downwind directions where the heliosheath    absorption is prominent .",
    "these directions are clearly the best places    to look for azimuthal dependences in ly@xmath0    absorption , but there are problems with doing this in practice .",
    "one is    simply that we have few downwind detections of heliospheric    ly@xmath0 absorption .",
    "another is that the heliosheath    absorption that dominates in downwind directions should ideally be    modeled using a complex multi - fluid plasma treatment . and",
    "finally , the    model grid must be extended a much longer distance downwind than    present models to capture all the heliosheath absorption in these    directions .",

    "<S> we use newly developed 3d kinetic mhd models of the heliosphere to predict heliospheric h  i ly@xmath0 absorption for various lines of sight . </S>",

    "<S> we find that the absorption predicted by the models is weakly affected by both the magnitude and orientation of the assumed ism magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> models with @xmath1  @xmath2 g and an angle of @xmath3 with respect to the upwind direction of the ism flow generally provide the best fits to the data , but the sensitivity of the ly@xmath0 absorption to many model input parameters makes it difficult to fully characterize the region of parameter space allowed by the data . </S>",
    "<S> we also use the models to assess the degree to which heliospheric asymmetries induced by the ism field should be apparent in ly@xmath0 absorption . an ism field that is skewed with respect to the ism flow vector results in substantial azimuthal asymmetries in both the hydrogen wall and heliosheath , but only the heliosheath asymmetries yield potentially detectable asymmetries in ly@xmath0 absorption ; and then only in downwind directions , where comparison with the data is complicated by few actual absorption detections and an insufficient model grid extent . </S>"
