    "in the last few years @xmath0-wave superconductivity in hole - doped high-@xmath10 cuprates is established.@xcite more recently , tsuei and kirtley and other groups @xcite have shown by means of the phase sensitive tri - crystal geometry and the magnetic penetration depth measurement that the superconductivity in the electron doped cuprates ncco and pcco is also of @xmath0-wave .",
    "this suggests strongly the universality of @xmath0-wave superconductivity for all cuprate superconductors .",
    "further , recent measurements of the magnetic penetration depth in organic superconductor @xmath11-(bedt - ttf)@xmath12cu(n(cn)@xmath12)br indicates this system has also @xmath0-wave superconductivity , @xcite though the phase sensitive experiment is not available for this system .",
    "also uncertain is the nodal directions of the order parameter @xcite in @xmath11-(et)@xmath12 salts in spite of the theoretical suggestion that it belongs to @xmath13-symmetry .",
    "@xcite in this circumstance , the experimental probe which indicates the nodal directions in @xmath0-wave superconductors is of prime importance .",
    "we recall earlier study of the thermal conductivity tensor in the optimally doped ybco in a planar magnetic field indicates clearly the nodal directions of @xmath0-wave superconductors consistent with @xmath14 symmetry .",
    "@xcite    in the meanwhile volovik@xcite made the crucial observation that the thermodynamics of the vortex state in @xmath0-wave superconductors is dominated by the extended quasi - particle states associated with the nodal structure and the effect of the magnetic field is incorporated by the doppler shift in the energy spectrum.@xcite this approach is further developed by barash et al@xcite and kbert et al.@xcite    in particular , those authors consider the supercurrent associated with individual vortices explicitly and then made spatial average of individual vortex contribution over the unit cell of the vortex lattice . indeed ,",
    "kbert et al have succeeded not only to describe the early specific heat data by k. moler et al and b. revaz et al @xcite , but also predicted the thermal conductivity in a magnetic field parallel to the @xmath15-axis in the low temperature limit , which is confirmed by the thermal conductivity measurement by chiao et al .",
    "@xcite more recently , this method has been used to calculate a variety of quantities , which includes the angular dependence of the specific heat of @xmath0-wave superconductivity in a planar magnetic field .",
    "@xcite    the object of this paper is to study both the thermodynamics and the thermal conductivity tensor in a planar magnetic field .",
    "we find the analytic expressions of the density of states and the thermal conductivity tensor in the presence of a magnetic field and impurity .",
    "also , the doppler shift is handled consistently with the layered structure common to both cuprates and @xmath11-(et)@xmath12 salts.@xcite this enables us to analyze these quantities both in the superclean limit ( @xmath1 ) and in the clean limit ( @xmath16 ) , while in [ 16 - 18 ] they are called the clean limit and the dirty limit .",
    "we think the word `` dirty limit '' should not be used to the system where @xmath17 . here",
    "@xmath18 is the upper critical field , @xmath19 the quasi - particle scattering rate , and @xmath20 the order parameter .",
    "we find the angular dependence of both the specific heat and the superfluid density roughly by a factor 4 less than those predicted in [ 23 ] .",
    "also , the longitudinal thermal conductivity increases linearly with @xmath21 in the superclean limit , while @xmath22 in the clean limit .",
    "therefore , our result is similar to [ 18 ] in the clean limit , though it is different from [ 18 ] in the superclean limit . so the thermal conductivity increases with @xmath21 as in [ 18 ] but in contradiction to [ 13 ] .",
    "further the thermal conductivity exhibits a similar @xmath9-dependence as observed in [ 13 ] , but again it has the opposite sign ; @xmath5 takes the minimum value for @xmath23 contrary to [ 13 ] .",
    "perhaps this is due to the fact there is more quasi - particle for @xmath24 than for @xmath23 . on the other hand ,",
    "the transverse thermal conductivity is described by @xmath6 in the both limits .",
    "this dependence appears to describe quite well the data reported in [ 11,12 ] .",
    "for simplicity , we limit our analysis to @xmath25 and @xmath26 and the impurity scattering is treated in the unitarity limit . @xcite",
    "following barash et al,@xcite the impurity - renormalized quasiparticle energy @xmath27 is given by @xmath28 and @xmath29 where @xmath30 = @xmath31 @xmath32 , the doppler - shifted energy due to the circulating supercurrent around the vortex , @xmath33 the distance from the vortex , @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the fermi velocity within the @xmath3-@xmath4 plane and the one parallel to the @xmath15-axis , respectively , where the effect of the layered structure is explicitly considered.@xcite here @xmath36 , @xmath37 is the angle the quasi - particle momentum in the @xmath3-@xmath4 plane makes from the @xmath3-axis , @xmath9 is the angle the magnetic field makes from the @xmath3-axis , and @xmath38 the angular average .",
    "we assume the unitarity limit of the impurity scattering .",
    "the low temperature limit of both the specific heat and the superfluid density is easily obtained from the residual density of states @xcite ( i.e. the density of states on the fermi surface or at @xmath39 ) .",
    "the quasi - particle density of states at @xmath39 in the presence of both impurities and a magnetic field is given by @xmath40 where @xmath41 and we used @xmath42 this set of equation is solved in the following :    for @xmath43 ( i.e.@xmath1 ) , @xmath44 and @xmath45    for @xmath46 ( i.e. @xmath16 ) , @xmath47 and @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the density of states in the @xmath50 case with the unitarity impurity scatterers and is given @xcite @xmath51 we call the former the superclean limit while the latter the clean limit .",
    "these have been obtained essentially in [ 16 ] except for a few typos .",
    "we used the same angular and the spatial average as in barash et al and kbert et al .",
    "@xcite finally , the density of states in the both limits is the following :    for the superclean limit ( @xmath52 ) ; @xmath53\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath54 and @xmath55 where @xmath56 = @xmath57 and @xmath58 is the complete elliptic integral . here ,",
    "instead of average over @xmath59 , we average over @xmath60 ( i.e. over the two nodal directions .",
    "@xcite )    the @xmath9-dependence of @xmath61 and @xmath62 are shown in fig.1 and fig.2 . in fig.1",
    "we compared also the angular dependent obtained in [ 23 ] where the layered structure is ignored . in the present calculation , the angular dependent term is about the 4@xmath63 of the coefficient @xmath64 , while in [ 23 ] it is about 20 @xmath63 .",
    "a recent specific data from stoichiometric yba@xmath12cu@xmath65o@xmath66 crystals @xcite appear to be more consistent with the present analysis .",
    "perhaps we have to point out the angular dependence of @xmath62 appeared since we cut off the the short - range logarithmic divergence at @xmath67 where the uniform order parameter started to be greatly disturbed,@xcite though the exact value @xmath68 in the present case is not so important .    for the clean limit ( @xmath69 ) ;",
    "@xmath70\\ ] ] where @xmath71 \\nonumber \\\\ & \\simeq & 0.147 - 0.082\\,\\cos(4\\theta)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the function @xmath72 is shown in fig.3 .",
    "the residual density of states is most readily accessible to the low temperature limit of the spin susceptibility as in nmr , the specific heat and the superfluid density.@xcite in particular the low temperature specific heat and the superfluid density are given by @xmath73 and @xmath74 also , in the superclean limit and @xmath75 , we obtain @xcite @xmath76 and @xmath77 to conclude this section , we have considered the residual density of states in a planar magnetic field both in the superclean and in the clean limit . in both limits",
    "the residual density of states exhibits the fourfold symmetry , though magnitude of this terms is roughly 4 times smaller than the earlier result.@xcite",
    "making use of ambegaokar - griffin formula @xcite the low temperature thermal conductivity tensor is given by    @xmath78    similarly @xmath79 where @xmath80    first , for the superclean limit ( @xmath81 ) eq.(17 ) and eq.(18 ) reduce to @xmath82 and @xmath83 where @xmath84 , the thermal conductivity in the normal state , and @xmath85 the function @xmath86 is shown in fig.4 together with the approximate form .",
    "we note also that @xmath5 has the same angular dependence as @xmath87 ^ 2 $ ] .",
    "also @xmath8 is proportional to @xmath57 in a good approximation ( see fig.4 and eq.(9 ) ) .    on the other hand , in the clean limit(@xmath88 ) , we obtain @xmath89\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath72 is given in eq.(12 ) .",
    "note that @xmath72 appears from the lower cut - off of @xmath33 as explained after eq.(10 ) . and",
    "@xmath90\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath91 \\nonumber\\\\ & \\simeq & 0.422 \\sin(2\\theta)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the function @xmath92 is shown in fig.5 with the approximate form . here ,",
    "@xmath93 , @xmath94 is the quasiparticle density and @xmath95 the quasiparticle mass .",
    "this form of thermal conductivity , in the absence of magnetic field is derived first by lee .",
    "@xcite in general , however , @xmath20 in @xmath96 depends on both on @xmath19 and @xmath21 . in the superclean limit",
    ", @xmath97 may be approximately given by @xcite @xmath98 in the clean limit ( @xmath99 ) , @xmath100    in both limits , the longitudinal conductivity increases with @xmath21 , linearly in superclean limit and @xmath101 in clean limit , respectively .",
    "( our result agrees with [ 18 ] only in the clean limit , @xmath16 . )",
    "further it exhibits the @xmath9 dependence in both the superclean and the clean limit . in the superclean limit",
    "the @xmath9-dependence comes from that of the density of states , while in the clean limit this arises from the short range cut - off we have introduced after eq.(10 ) .",
    "also this angular dependence is very similar to the one reported in [ 13 ] , but of opposite sign .",
    "but perhaps of particular interest is the transverse thermal conductivity .",
    "the dominant terms in eq.(20 ) and eq.(23 ) , exhibit @xmath57 dependence , which is fully consistent with the early experiment . @xcite",
    "also this @xmath57 dependence is appreciable even when @xmath102.@xcite",
    "we have extended earlier analysis of the thermodynamics and the transport properties in d - wave superconductors in 2 directions .",
    "first , we take account of the layered structure of the underlying superconductors explicitly .",
    "second , we focused on the angular dependence of thermal conductivity tensor , which exhibits clear signs of the nodal structures in d - wave superconductors .",
    "indeed the diagonal thermal conductivity exhibits the fourfold symmetry as observed in [ 13 ] , but of opposite sign . in particular , the present result describes the transverse thermal conductivity ( or righi - leduc effect ) observed in ybco .",
    "@xcite indeed , we have found recently a similar transverse thermal conductivity in p - wave superconductors as sr@xmath12ruo@xmath103 and @xmath104-wave superconductors as in upt@xmath65.@xcite therefore , this @xmath57 dependence in @xmath8 is rather common to most of unconventional superconductors .",
