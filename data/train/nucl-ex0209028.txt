    "the @xmath0 meson is an important probe for studying relativistic heavy ion collisions .",
    "since the mass of the @xmath0 meson is close to twice the kaon mass , any medium modification of its spectral shape ( mass and/or width ) @xcite as chiral symmetry restoration is approached may induce a change in its branching ratio in the kaon channel .",
    "the simultaneous measurement of @xmath0 decay into @xmath7 and @xmath8 is a very powerful tool in the search for such in - medium modifications .",
    "consisting of @xmath9 , the @xmath0 meson is also a sensitive probe of strangeness production @xcite .",
    "the phenix experiment at rhic , with its excellent mass resolution and particle identification capability , ( comparable to or better than the natural width of the @xmath0 meson ) has the unique capability to measure the @xmath0 meson through both @xmath10 and @xmath2 decay channels at mid - rapidity .",
    "we present the preliminary results of the @xmath0 meson measurement made during the 2001 rhic run .",
    "the results presented here were obtained using the two central arms of the phenix spectrometer @xcite . the @xmath11 analysis used the drift chamber ( dc ) , two sets of multiwire proportional chambers with pixel - pad readout ( pc1 and pc3 ) , and the time of flight ( tof ) module of the east arm .",
    "the acceptance is defined by the tof module which covers the pseudorapidity range @xmath12 and an azimuthal range of @xmath13 .",
    "the kaons were identified via reconstructed momentum combined with a tof measurement with a time resolution @xmath14 ps . with a 2@xmath15 momentum dependent cut in",
    "the mass squared distributions , @xmath16 were well separated up to @xmath17 gev / c .",
    "the @xmath18 measurements were performed with the dc , pc1 , pc3 , the ring imaging cerenkov detector ( rich ) and the electromagnetic calorimeter ( emcal ) of both the east and west arm , each one covering @xmath19 and @xmath12 .",
    "electrons were identified primarily by the rich .",
    "further identification was provided by requiring the energy in the emcal to match the measured momentum of the tracks .    charged particle tracks and their momenta were reconstructed using the dc and pc1 .",
    "tracks were confirmed by a matching hit in pc3 and tof in the case of kaons , and in the emcal for electrons .    the beam - beam counters ( bbc ) and",
    "the zero - degree calorimeters ( zdc ) provided the trigger and were used to determine the event centrality .",
    "the bbc were also used to determine the z - coordinate of the collision vertex ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "the analysis used @xmath21 ( for kaons ) and @xmath22 ( for electrons ) minimum bias events with a vertex position within @xmath23 cm .",
    "all identified kaon tracks in a given event were combined to form the invariant mass distributions of the like sign ( @xmath24 , @xmath25 ) and unlike sign pairs .",
    "the large combinatorial background inherent to this procedure was estimated by an event mixing method in which all @xmath26 tracks from one event were combined with @xmath27 tracks of ten other events of the same centrality and vertex class .",
    "the mixed event invariant mass distribution was then normalized to the measured @xmath28 .",
    "the validity of the method was tested by constructing , in a similar way , a combinatorial like - sign spectrum and comparing it to the measured like - sign pair distribution .",
    "finally , the signal was obtained by subtracting the mixed event spectrum from the measured one .",
    "this gives the uncorrected @xmath0-yield ( @xmath29 ) of the @xmath30 decay channel .",
    "an identical procedure was used for the measurement of the @xmath31 decay channel .      in order to obtain the yield @xmath4 from the uncorrected signal , we correct our invariant mass distributions for detector acceptance and reconstruction efficiency .",
    "the correction was determined using monte carlo simulations in two steps . in the first step ,",
    "we generated single @xmath0 mesons with an exponential transverse momentum distribution ( @xmath32 ) , assuming a temperature of _ t _ = 380 mev which is consistent with the measurement by the star experiment at @xmath33 gev @xcite .",
    "the generated @xmath0 s were then propagated through the phenix detector simulation and the pair acceptance and reconstruction efficiency was calculated by : @xmath34 in the second step , the multiplicity dependent efficiencies ( @xmath35 ) were estimated by embedding single tracks into the real data events .",
    "the final corrected yield is given by @xmath36 where br represents the branching ratio for the specific decay channel ( @xmath37 or @xmath38 ) .",
    "1 shows the minimum bias invariant mass distributions for @xmath11 ( panel ( a ) ) and @xmath18 ( panel ( c ) ) .",
    "the kaon channel results for the 40%-80% centrality range are shown in fig .",
    "1(b ) , where we see a considerable improvement in the signal to background ratio compared with minimum bias spectrum . since the combinatorial background increases quadratically with centrality",
    ", this means that the signal increases at a much lower rate with centrality .",

    "phenix has measured the yield of @xmath0 mesons via the @xmath10 and @xmath2 channels .",
