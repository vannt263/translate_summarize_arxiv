    "we consider the basic multiple - access communication problem in a distributed setting . in gallager",
    "s survey paper @xcite , it is pointed out that the multiple - access problem has been studied from a number of different perspectives , each having its own advantages and shortcomings . in the data networking community ,",
    "a well - known distributed multiple access scheme is aloha  @xcite . in aloha",
    ", it is assumed that a  collision \" happens whenever more than one user transmit simultaneously .",
    "those packets involved in a collision are discarded and retransmitted according to some retransmission probability .",
    "the collision channel model , however , does not accurately describe the underlying physical multiple - access channel .",
    "it is well known that there exist coding techniques which can decode multiple users messages when simultaneous transmissions occur .",
    "indeed , more sophisticated models such as signal capture @xcite , spread aloha @xcite , and multi - packet reception @xcite have been developed to enhance aloha .",
    "even these improved schemes , however , are not optimal from the viewpoint of information theory . in the information theory literature , the capacity regions of various multiple - access channel ( mac ) models have been characterized ( see @xcite ) .",
    "rate splitting multiple - access techniques ( or generalized time - sharing ) are presented in @xcite to achieve every point in the gaussian or the discrete memoryless mac capacity region using only single - user codes .",
    "these schemes , however , require a pre - defined decoding order , which makes distributed implementation difficult . finally , in the spread spectrum community , cdma techniques are adopted . here , users are decoded regarding all other users signals as interference .",
    "this , however , is not optimal from the information theoretic viewpoint .    to address some of the shortcomings mentioned above , medard _ et al . _",
    "@xcite use information - theoretic techniques to analyze different notions of capacity for time - slotted aloha systems .",
    "a coding / decoding scheme which combines rate splitting and superposition coding is constructed .",
    "this scheme allows some bits to be reliably received even when collision occurs , and more bits to be reliably received in the absence of collisions .",
    "shamai @xcite proposes a similar scheme to apply a broadcast strategy to multiple - access channel under static fading where the fading coefficients are not available to the transmitters or the receiver . to implement the scheme in  @xcite ,",
    "however , a pre - defined decoding order is required , as in  @xcite . in  @xcite",
    ", cheng proposes a distributed scheme called `` stripping cdma '' for the @xmath1 out of @xmath2 gaussian mac . here , no pre - defined decoding order is required .",
    "it is shown in  @xcite that stripping cdma is asymptotically optimal , although the optimal operating parameters are not specified .    in this paper ,",
    "we investigate distributed multiple - access schemes based on the idea of rate splitting for both the @xmath0-user additive white gaussian noise mac and the @xmath0-user discrete memoryless mac .",
    "we characterize the optimal operating parameters as well as the asymptotic optimality of these schemes from the viewpoint of information theory .",
    "assume that every user has an infinite backlog of bits to send , and that every user knows the total number of users @xmath0 .",
    "we propose a distributed scheme , called _ distributed rate splitting _ ( drs ) , to achieve the optimal communication rates allowed by information theory . in this scheme ,",
    "each real user creates a number of virtual users via a power / rate splitting mechanism in the @xmath0-user gaussian channel or via a random switching mechanism in the @xmath0-user discrete memoryless channel . at the receiver",
    ", all virtual users are successively decoded .",
    "a possible advantage of the drs scheme is that it can be implemented with lower complexity when compared with multiple - access schemes such as joint coding and less coordination when compared with time - sharing and rate splitting .    in sections [ sec : gau ] and [ sec : dmc ] ,",
    "we focus first on symmetric situations where the channel capacity regions are symmetric and every real user creates the same number of virtual users . in this case , the drs scheme entails the following .",
    "each user @xmath3 creates @xmath1 virtual users indexed by @xmath4 , @xmath5 .",
    "the virtual user class @xmath6 consists of users @xmath7 ( i.e. we have altogether @xmath1 virtual user classes and there are @xmath0 virtual users in each class ) . in the @xmath0-user gaussian mac ,",
    "virtual users are created via a power / rate splitting mechanism .",
    "the signal transmitted by a real user is the superposition of all its virtual users signals .",
    "the receiver receives the sum of the virtual users signals plus noise .",
    "all virtual users are then successively decoded in increasing order of their class .",
    "that is , all virtual users in class @xmath6 , @xmath8 , are decoded before any virtual user in @xmath9 , where @xmath10 , is decoded .",
    "in contrast to  @xcite , the optimal operating parameters , such as power and rate , are explicitly specified for any finite @xmath1 . in the @xmath0-user discrete memoryless mac ,",
    "virtual users with the same input distribution as the real users are created , and the transmitted signal of a real user is determined by a random switch .",
    "the receiver successively decodes all virtual users in increasing order of their class given the side information of already decoded virtual users .",
    "the optimal switch is found for any finite @xmath1 for the @xmath11-user case .",
    "finally , it is shown that for both channel models , the rate tuple achieved by the drs scheme converges to the maximum equal rate point allowed by the information - theoretic bound as the number of virtual users per real user tends to infinity .    next , in section  [ sec : variation ] , we consider more general situations where the capacity regions can be asymmetric and real users may generate different numbers of virtual users . for the case of asymmetric capacity regions ,",
    "new operating parameters are specified for any finite number of virtual users per real user .",
    "we show that the drs scheme still can achieve a point on the dominant face as the number of virtual users per real user tends to infinity . for the case of unequal number of virtual users per real user ,",
    "we present a variation of drs which supports differential user rate requirements in a distributed manner . in this new scheme ,",
    "each user  @xmath3 , independently from other users , generates @xmath12 virtual users according to its own rate requirement .",
    "all virtual users are then decoded reliably at the receiver . furthermore",
    ", as each real user generates more virtual users , the rate tuple achieved under this variation of drs converges the maximum equal rate point on the dominant face .",
    "we first examine a gaussian mac with a symmetric capacity region . later in section  [ sec : variation ] , we consider the asymmetric case . consider an @xmath0-user gaussian mac where each transmitter has transmission power @xmath13 and the receiver has noise variance @xmath14 .",

    "@xmath21 is the subset of rate tuples which gives equality in for @xmath22 . for this symmetric",
    "setting , it is easy to see that the maximum common rate that every user can achieve is achievable if for any @xmath23 , there exists an @xmath24 multiple - access code with overall error probability @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the block length . ] is @xmath27 .",
    "it is well - known that rate tuples on the dominant face other than the vertices can not be achieved via standard successive decoding  @xcite .",
    "note that the optimal rate tuple @xmath28 , called the _ maximum equal rate point _",
    ", is such a point .",
    "for the two - user gaussian mac , the maximum equal rate point is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : twogaussian ] .",
    "currently , three methods are known to achieve general points on the dominant face : joint encoding / decoding , time - sharing , and rate - splitting .",
    "joint encoding / decoding is not practical because of its high complexity  @xcite . in time - sharing ,",
    "all @xmath0 users need to coordinate their transmissions .",
    "therefore , some communication overhead is required .",
    "the rate - splitting method in  @xcite achieves every point in @xmath29 via a generalized successive decoding scheme .",
    "for the two - user case , user  @xmath30 creates two virtual users , say @xmath31 and @xmath32 , by splitting its power @xmath13 into @xmath33 and @xmath34 and setting @xmath35 , @xmath36 .",
    "user @xmath11 does not split its power and sets its rate to @xmath37 .",
    "the decoding order is @xmath38 . in order to achieve the maximum equal rate point",
    ", we solve @xmath39 , yielding @xmath40 .",
    "thus , both time - sharing and rate splitting require some coordination among users .    in this paper ,",
    "we focus on _ distributed _ multiple - access communication schemes . in particular , we introduce the _ distributed rate splitting _",
    "( drs ) scheme .",
    "the drs scheme offers the possibility of multiple - access communication with lower complexity when compared with joint coding , and communication with less coordination when compared with the time - sharing or rate splitting method .",
    "moreover , we show that drs can achieve the maximum equal rate point of the mac capacity region asymptotically .",
    "we now formally present the drs scheme . in this scheme ,",
    "each user creates @xmath1 virtual users by splitting its power @xmath13 into @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the power allocated to the @xmath43th virtual user and @xmath44 .",
    "each user then assigns transmission rate @xmath45 to virtual user @xmath43 .",
    "note that the proposed drs scheme is symmetric , i.e. all @xmath0 users split their powers and set their rates in the same way .",
    "the signal transmitted by a user is the superposition of its virtual users signals . as defined in section [ sec : intro ] , virtual user class @xmath6 consists of all virtual users indexed by @xmath43 .",
    "the receiver receives the sum of all virtual users signals plus noise .",
    "all virtual users are then successively decoded in increasing order of their class .    to illustrate the drs scheme ,",
    "consider the case @xmath46 .",
    "each real user splits its power @xmath13 into @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "notice there are two major differences between our scheme and the traditional rate splitting scheme in @xcite .",
    "first , in our scheme , all real users split in the same way , whereas there is at least one user who does not split in the traditional rate splitting scheme .",
    "second , virtual users in the same class , ( i.e. with the same index @xmath43 ) , are allocated the same rate in our scheme , whereas all virtual users have different rates according to the pre - defined decoding order in the traditional rate splitting scheme . is not optimal . later in this section",
    ", we demonstrate the asymptotic optimality of drs by taking @xmath1 to infinity . ]",
    "these differences are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : difference ] .",
    "since we assume the receiver uses successive decoding method , some virtual user must be decoded first . without loss of generality",
    "we assume one of the @xmath33 virtual users is decoded first .",
    "for the case @xmath46 , we show that there is a unique way for a real user to split its power in order to maximize its total throughput .    for @xmath47 and for a fixed @xmath33 ,",
    "each real user s throughput is maximized by setting @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "_ proof : _ the @xmath33 virtual user who is decoded first must have @xmath50 ( i.e. the virtual user regards all other virtual users as interference ) in order to be decoded successfully . due to symmetry , all other @xmath33 virtual users must have the same @xmath51 .",
    "then the problem of maximizing each real user s throughput reduces to @xmath52 , subject to  ( i ) @xmath53 , ( ii ) one of the @xmath33 virtual users is decoded first and ( iii ) @xmath54    note that @xmath55 is maximized when the interference plus noise faced by all the @xmath56 virtual users is minimized , and the only way to minimize the interference plus noise faced by all the @xmath56 virtual users is to decode all the @xmath33 virtual users before decoding any @xmath56 virtual user .",

    "@xmath59 +    using the drs scheme with @xmath47 , each user can strictly increase its throughput relative to the case where users do not split their powers and decode against each other as noise .",
