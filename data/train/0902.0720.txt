    "among isolated neutron stars ( inss ) , a small number of objects , namely the soft gamma repeaters ( sgrs ) and the anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) , share a number of common , peculiar characteristics .",
    "these are the huge spin down rates , @xmath3@xmath4 , absence of radio emission ( up to now only the axps xte j1810 - 197 and 1e 1547.0 - 5408 have been detected in the radio , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , persistent x - ray luminosities in the range @xmath5@xmath6 erg / s and rotational periods @xmath712 s , a very narrow range compared with that of other classes of inss .",
    "though sgrs activity is higher , both groups undergo erratic x/@xmath1-ray bursts with peak luminosities of @xmath8@xmath9 erg / s and typical durations of @xmath101 s. moreover , sgrs exhibit much more energetic events , the so - called giant flares ( gfs ) , in which energies up to @xmath11 erg are released in a timescale of one second ( see , for a recent review , * ? ? ?",
    "thanks to _ integral _ isgri and _ rxte _ hexte , axps and sgrs are now known to be also persistent hard x - ray sources ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . actually , their energy output in the @xmath12200 kev range may amount to as much as 50% of the total flux emitted above @xmath0 kev .",
    "recent , deeper _ integral _ observations have shown that the hard x - ray emission is highly phase - dependent and probably results from the superposition of different spectral components @xcite .    at variance with radio - pulsars ,",
    "the persistent emission of sgrs / axps is @xmath13100 times higher than their rotational energy losses .",
    "this , together with the lack of detected stellar companions , indicates that the persistent emission of these sources is unlikely to be powered by rotation or accretion .",
    "the ( dipolar ) magnetic fields inferred from the spin - down measurements , @xmath14 g , largely in excess of the quantum critical field ( @xmath15 g ) , support the idea that sgrs and axps are ultra - magnetized nss ( or magnetars ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and their ( persistent and bursting ) emission is sustained by the super - strong magnetic field .",
    "although other scenarios , mainly based on accretion from a debris disc left after the supernova event ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , may still be considered , the magnetar model appears capable of explaining in a simple and economical way most of the observed properties of sgrs and axps ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in a magnetar with surface field @xmath16 g the internal field can reach @xmath17 g @xcite . since the poloidal and toroidal components are expected to be in rough equipartition",
    "( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , the huge toroidal field stresses the crust , producing a deformation of the surface layers .",
    "this , in turns , induces a rotation of the external field lines which are anchored to the star crust and leads to the appearance of an external toroidal component .",
    "the properties of such a twisted magnetosphere have been investigated by @xcite by means of a model analogous to that for the solar magnetic field ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , under the assumptions of a static , dipolar , globally twisted field and enforcing , as in the solar models , the force - free condition .",
    "a feature of ( non - potential ) force - free fields is the presence of supporting currents .",
    "as first suggested by @xcite , thermal photons emitted by the star surface can scatter at the cyclotron resonance on the charges flowing in the magnetosphere , and this can drastically alter the primary spectrum .",
    "recent , detailed calculations @xcite of scattering onto mildly relativistic electrons confirmed this picture .",
    "typical synthetic spectra exhibit a high - energy tail , superimposed to a thermal bump and closely resemble the ( empirical ) `` blackbody+power - law '' model which has been routinely used to describe the magnetars quiescent emission in the @xmath1810 kev band ( see again * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for a summary of observational results ) .",
    "this model has been successfully applied to the x - ray spectra of several axps / sgrs by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also @xcite ) , providing direct support to the twisted magnetosphere scenario .    the origin of the high - energy tails discovered with _",
    "integral _ is much less understood .",
    "@xcite analyzed different mechanisms within the magnetar model , and suggested that the hard x - rays may be produced either by thermal bremsstrahlung in the surface layers heated by returning currents , or by synchrotron emission from pairs created higher up in the magnetosphere .",
    "quite interestingly , @xcite and @xcite have recently proposed a further possibility , according to which the soft gamma - rays may also originate from resonant up - scattering of seed photons , if a population of highly relativistic electrons is present in the magnetosphere ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "since the conduction current in a sheared magnetosphere is @xmath19 , the particle density and hence the optical depth to resonant scattering depends on the shear @xcite .",
    "moreover , the global topology of the magnetic field influences scattering even for fixed shear . a globally twisted dipolar field will in general give rise to a different spectrum from that of a globally twisted quadrupolar field with the same twist angle .",
    "because the spatial distribution of charges is not homogeneous @xcite , changes in shear and/or field topology are going to produce differences not only in the spectral shape , but also in the pulse shape of the received radiation . some complicated pulse profiles from sgrs have already been explained by invoking higher order multipoles ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "moreover , recent data both for axps and sgrs seem to point towards the presence of a localized , rather than global , twist ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , no investigation which includes multipolar components or localized twists have been presented up to now .    in this paper",
    "we discuss how globally twisted magnetostatic equilibria can be derived in the case of higher order , axially symmetric multipolar fields .",
    "in particular , explicit ( numerical ) solutions for quadrupolar and octupolar fields are presented .",
    "we use the monte carlo code developed by @xcite to investigate the properties of the emerging spectrum and pulse profiles for higher order multipolar fields .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in  [ sec : dipol - conf - beyond ] we introduce the globally twisted model and derive the solutions for each axially symmetric multipole ; an analytical solution , valid in the case of dipolar and quadrupolar fields for small shear , is presented in appendix [ sec : app ] .",
    "monte carlo spectra and lightcurves obtained with different force - free magnetospheric configurations are discussed in ",
    "[ sec : spectra ] , where a comparison with the timing properties of the hard x - ray emission from the axps 1rxs j1708 - 4009 and 4u 0142 + 6 is also presented .",
    "discussion follows in  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "in this section we present the basic equations that we use to derive globally - twisted magnetospheric models . we follow closely the approach outlined in @xcite and @xcite ( hereafter w95 and tlk , respectively ) , who considered the global twist of a dipolar field .",
    "as we show below , the same approach can be used to compute twisted fields for multipoles of arbitrary order . as in w95 and tlk ,",
    "we restrict to magnetostatic , force - free equilibria . in the case of a low density , static plasma , in fact , in the standard mhd equation @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the plasma density and velocity , the velocity and gravity terms can be neglected . with the further hypothesis that the ( plasma ) pressure force is small with respect to the lorentz force @xmath23 ( where @xmath24 is the current density )",
    ", the equation reduces to @xmath25 .",
    "since we are interested in stationary configurations , the ampre - maxwell equation simplifies to @xmath26 . from the two previous conditions the usual expression for the force - free condition",
    "is recovered @xmath27    our aim is to construct an axisymmetric , force - free field by adding a defined amount of shear to a potential field . in accordance with both tlk and w95",
    ", we choose to use the flux function @xmath28 to express the poloidal component of the field .",
    "axisymmetry is enforced choosing a function independent of the azimuth @xmath29 ( we use a spherical coordinate system with the polar axis along the magnetic moment vector ) .",
    "thus , the general expression for an axisymmetric field is : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the unit vector in the @xmath29 direction .    by inserting the previous expression into the force - free condition ( equation [ [ fff ] ] ) one obtains two independent scalar equations for the flux function , @xmath28 , and the toroidal component of the field , @xmath32 .",
    "the former requires @xmath32 to be a function of @xmath28 only @xcite , thus we can write    @xmath33    where @xmath34 is an arbitrary function . introducing the previous expression into the second scalar equation leads to the grad - schlter - shafranov ( gss ) equation @xmath35 ( here and in the following @xmath36 ) .",
    "the gss equation can be reduced to an ordinary differential equation by making suitable assumptions on the dependence of @xmath28 on the coordinates . following a classical approach to this problem ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* w95 , tlk ) , we assume separation of variables and choose the flux function @xmath28 in the form @xmath37 where @xmath38 is a function of the colatitude @xmath39 , @xmath40 is the stellar radius and @xmath41 , as in tlk .",
    "the requirement that all the components of @xmath42 have the same radial dependence implies that    @xmath43    where , for later convenience , we have expressed the multiplicative constant in terms of a parameter @xmath44 and of the radial exponent @xmath45 . recalling equation ( [ eq:4 ] )",
    ", one can explicitly write the magnetic field as a function of @xmath46    @xmath47\\ ] ]    where a prime denotes derivation with respect to @xmath48 . finally , taking into account equations ( [ ppdep ] ) and ( [ fp ] ) ,",
    "the gss equation becomes for the case at hand    @xmath49    which is a second order ordinary differential equation for the angular part of the flux function .",
    "its solution , once a suitable set of boundary conditions has been supplied ( see   [ bc ] ) , completely specifies the external magnetic field .",
    "besides controlling the radial decay , the parameter @xmath45 also fixes the amount of shear of the field .",
    "in fact , recalling the definition of shear angle ( w95 , tlk ) @xmath50^{1/2 }    \\int_{\\textrm{field line } } \\frac{f^{1/p}}{1-\\mu^2 } { \\mathrm{d}}\\mu \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is immediate to see that different values of @xmath45 correspond to fields with different shear .",
    "actually , as it will be discussed later on , the effect of decreasing @xmath45 is to increase @xmath32 with respect to the other components , and consequently to increase the shear .    as it is apparent from equation ( [ bgen ] ) , the limiting case @xmath51 results in a purely radial field whose field lines are directed either outwards or inwards ( whence the name of split monopole ) . the directions of the field lines divide the sphere ( i.e. the star ) into several zones , and we can imagine field lines of opposite directions connecting at radial infinity ( w95 ) .",
    "split monopole fields obtained for different multipolar orders differ from one another in the number of zones into which the sphere is split .      in order to solve equation ( [ ode ] )",
    "we need to provide a suitable set of boundary conditions . for a dipolar field",
    "there are just two poles and the star is divided into two hemispheres , i.e. the portions of the surface @xmath52 , @xmath53 , respectively , and @xmath54 .",
    "higher order multipoles have in addition degenerate poles , which are loci of constant colatitude , and correspond to circles on the surface ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : magnetic - hemispheres ] ) . for the quadrupole , for example , there are two poles on the magnetic axis and the equator is a degenerate pole . in the case of a generic multipolar field ,",
    "the magnetic hemispheres of the dipole are replaced by a number of regions , each limited by two consecutive values of the colatitude , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , for which the field is purely radial ( the pole ) and has vanishing radial component ( the magnetic `` equator '' ) , i.e. @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "we refer to these zones as to regions of unipolar @xmath59 .    because of the north - south symmetry of unsheared multipolar fields , which is assumed to hold also for their twisted counterparts ,",
    "the integration domain is restricted to @xmath60 . in analogy with the `` composite magnetic fields '' of @xcite ,",
    "integration is performed piecewise , going from one pole to the next one . in each interval ,",
    "the boundary conditions for equation ( [ ode ] ) are determined by the requirements that : i ) @xmath42 is purely radial at each pole , and ii ) the intensity is not modified by the shear . the latter condition can be enforced either by assigning the field strength at one pole , or the magnetic flux out of each region of unipolar @xmath59 ; in both cases the value must not change with the shear . for multipoles of odd order ( dipole , octupole ,  )",
    "the first sub - domain starts at the geometrical equator , @xmath61 , which is not a pole . in these cases",
    "the boundary condition at @xmath61 reflects the n - s symmetry of the field and translates into @xmath62 ( tlk ) .    the magnetic field in the entire interval ( @xmath60 )",
    "is then obtained by assembling the solutions computed in the various sub - domains with the same value of @xmath45 , to ensure that the radial dependence of @xmath42 is the same at all co - latitudes .",
    "since the gss equation is a second order ode , imposing three boundary conditions implies that the parameter @xmath44 is an eigenvalue of the problem and depends on the radial index @xmath45 , @xmath63 .",
    "each multipolar potential term satisfies the gss equation with @xmath64 and is associated to an integer radial index @xmath65 ; it is @xmath66 for the dipole , @xmath67 for the quadrupole and so on . in this particular case , the equation is linear and admits analytical solutions of the form ( w95 )    @xmath68    where @xmath69 is the associated legendre function of the first kind @xcite .",
    "having established a set of boundary conditions , the gss equation can be solved for different values of @xmath45 , building a sequence of models characterized by a varying shear . as shown by @xcite , such a sequence share the same topology , i.e. the same number and position of poles .",
    "the only permitted values of the radial index are @xmath70 .",
    "the generating function of a pure dipole is @xmath71 thus from equation ( [ bgen ] ) it follows that the condition at the pole @xmath72 is @xmath73 , to which the symmetry condition @xmath62 must be added .",
    "the third condition is set either specifying the field strength at one pole , @xmath74 ( as in tlk ) , or requiring a constant flux , @xmath75 ( w95 ) .",
    "the sequence of sheared dipoles has radial index @xmath76",
    ".    sheared dipole fields have been discussed by w95 and tlk .",
    "these investigations , however , used a different boundary condition ( see above ) and we verified that the numerical solution of equation ( [ ode ] ) produces quite different results for @xmath77 and even more diverse eigenvalues @xmath78 in the two cases ( see fig .  [ func_wolf ] ) .",
    "still , one expects the magnetic field to be the same in both cases , since the two boundary conditions are physically equivalent .",
    "actually , a direct comparison of the numerical solutions shows that @xmath79 for each @xmath45 . denoting by @xmath80 this constant ratio , one can write the expression of the field in the two cases using equation ( [ bgen ] )    @xmath81 \\\\    & & \\\\",

    "the two fields have the same topology if and only if @xmath82 we checked that the previous condition is indeed satisfied by our numerical solutions with a relative accuracy @xmath83% for nearly all values of @xmath45   because @xmath84 . the eingevalues and the ratio @xmath85 for different values of @xmath45",

    "the great diversity in the eigenvalues , especially for @xmath92 is in fact balanced by the different behavior of the function @xmath38 . while for constant @xmath89 , it is @xmath93 , in the case of constant flux @xmath94 for any @xmath45 . in the limit @xmath95",
    "the proportionality of the two solutions for @xmath46 can be recovered analytically .",
    "in fact , it can be shown that in the split - monopole limit the generating functions are @xmath96 which gives @xmath97 , in agreement with the numerical result ( see again table [ tab : lambda ] ) .",
    "since equation ( [ ode ] ) is the force - free condition for a generic axisymmetric field ( as given by equation [ [ eq:4 ] ] ) , axisymmetric globally - twisted multipoles can be found solving again equation ( [ ode ] ) , subject to the boundary conditions discussed in  [ bc ] .",

    "the boundary conditions are then @xmath100 the latter two conditions enforce either constant field strength at the pole or constant flux , and , as discussed in the previous section are equivalent .",

    "in this section we use the numerical code described in ( * ? ? ? * ntz in the following ) to explore the effects of different sheared multipolar fields on the emergent spectra and lightcurves of magnetars .",
    "although the external field of a magnetar is unlikely to comprise a single higher order multipole , investigating spectral formation when the field is one ( twisted ) multipole offers the opportunity to explore the effects of magnetospheric currents localized on spatial scales smaller than that implied by the ( twisted ) dipole .",
    "an example is that of a sheared , localized component which appears as a consequence of some form of activity and adds up to a global , ( quasi)potential dipolar field .",
    "the currents responsible for the resonant scatterings are provided only by the sheared field .",
    "the case in which the localized component is modeled in terms of the polar `` lobe(s ) '' of an octupole , is discussed in  [ sec : pulsed ] .",
    "we base our model on the scenario envisaged by tlk ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for more detailed calculations ) , according to which thermal photons originating at the star surface undergo repeated scatterings with the charge carriers ( electrons , ions and possibly pairs ; see also @xcite ) flowing along the field lines .",
    "these investigations were based on non - relativistic computations , and therefore necessarily restricted to the low - energy ( @xmath112 kev ) emission .",
    "furthermore , they were based on the dipolar , globally - twisted magnetosphere of tlk .      in order to gain some insight on the properties in the emitted spectra when the magnetosphere is threaded by twisted , higher order multipoles , we plot in figs .",
    "[ fig : tauquadr ] and [ fig : tauott ] the optical depth @xmath113 to resonant scattering corresponding to quadrupolar and octupolar fields .",
    "this is given by @xmath114^{1/2}\\frac{f^{1/p}}{2+p}\\ ] ] where @xmath115 is the charge velocity and @xmath116 is the angle between the primary photon ( assumed to move radially ) and the magnetic field at the scattering radius ( tlk ) . since @xmath117 , @xmath118 and we make no further distinction between these two quantities . by comparing these curves to those in fig .",
    "[ fig : taudip ] we can clearly see that the optical depth for higher order multipoles is sensibly different from that of a dipolar configuration , implying that the overall spectral properties , and in particular those of the pulse phase emission , may be significantly affected . we remark that the typical radius at which resonant scattering occurs is different for the different multipoles .",
    "assuming that the surface strength is comparable , scattering in higher order multipolar fields takes place closer to the star with respect to the dipole because the field decays faster with radius .",
    "to further investigate this , we calculated a number of synthetic spectra and lightcurves by using the non - relativistic monte carlo code by ntz .    a comparison among spectra produced by a globally twisted dipolar , quadrupolar and octupolar magnetosphere is shown in fig .  [ spettri_tot1 ] .",
    "spectra have been computed for the same values of model parameters ( blackbody temperature @xmath119 kev , temperature and bulk velocity of the magnetospheric electrons @xmath120 kev , @xmath121 , polar magnetic field strength @xmath122 g ) , and for the same shear angle ( @xmath123 rad , which corresponds to @xmath124 for the dipole , the quadrupole and the octupole , respectively ) .",
    "spectra have been computed by collecting photons over the entire observer s sky ( i.e. by angle - averaging over all viewing directions ) . the most prominent feature in fig .",
    "[ spettri_tot1 ] is the higher comptonization degree induced by the quadrupolar ( and dipolar ) field with respect to the octupolar one .",
    "this can be understood in terms of the different spatial distribution of the scattering particles ( see figs .  [",
    "fig : tauquadr ] , [ fig : tauott ] , [ fig : taudip ] ) and of the different efficiency of scatterings , the latter depending on the ( average ) angle between the photon direction and that of the flowing currents .",
    "upscattering is more efficient in regions where the currents move towards the star , i.e. close to the magnetic south pole(s ) , because collisions tend to occur more head - on ( see also ntz ) . for a dipolar field the more favourable situation ( i.e. large optical depth and currents flowing towards the star ) arises for @xmath125 ( compare with the spectra at different viewing angles in fig .",
    "1 of ntz ; the one at @xmath126 is the more comptonized ) .",
    "for the quadrupole returning currents are localized around @xmath127 ( the geographical equator which is a degenerate south pole ) and there are two regions with large optical depth in @xmath60 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : tauquadr ] ) .",
    "the one at @xmath128 is closer to the south pole ( @xmath61 ) than in the case of the dipole , for which it occurs at @xmath125 while the south pole is at @xmath129 .",
    "the reason for which octupolar twisted fields produce less efficient upscattering is that , despite there are two maxima of the optical depth located quite close to the south pole ( at @xmath130 , the south pole is at @xmath131 ) , the relatively large curvature of the field lines makes the angular extent of the region where currents are inflowing narrow . as a consequence most photons scatter with electrons moving at large angles and",
    "this results in steeper spectra .",
    "there is now observational evidence that , at least in some cases , the magnetospheric twist in both sgrs and axps could be localized in restricted regions of the magnetosphere . for instance , @xcite found a certain degree of hysteresis in the long - term evolution of sgr 1806 - 20 prior the emission of the giant flare in december 2004 , with a non trivial correlation between spectral and timing properties that may be interpreted if only a small bundle of magnetic field lines is affected by the shear . a further case is provided by the spectral evolution of the transient axp xte j1810 - 197 @xcite which seems to require a twist concentrated towards the magnetic axis , giving rise to a polar hot region , possibly with a meridional temperature gradient .    motivated by this , we investigated the possibility to model a localized twist , by constructing a solution in which the shear changes with the magnetic colatitude of the field line foot point .",
    "although the configurations presented in the previous sections are globally twisted , the octupolar solution , which requires piecewise integration in two domains ( see  [ sec : mult - solut ] ) , can be used to construct a field with a non - vanishing twist at low magnetic co - latitudes .",
    "this is done by superimposing a sheared octupole for @xmath105 to a potential one in @xmath132 and is equivalent to solve equation ( [ ode ] ) in the entire domain with @xmath133 , where @xmath134 is the heaviside step function and @xmath135 a given constant .",
    "we note that , although not physically self - consistent , such a field is force - free ( see the discussion in  [ sec : conclusions ] ) .    the monte carlo spectra for different viewing angles",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "[ spettro_2lobi ] in the case in which the field has equatorial symmetry , i.e. the shear @xmath136  rad ( @xmath137 ) is applied on both polar lobes while the equatorial zone is permeated by a potential octupole .",
    "the spectra for the more interesting case in which the same shear is confined only around one pole are plotted in fig .",
    "[ spettro_1lobo ] .",
    "spectral models which account for different magnetospheric configurations hold the potential to reproduce not only the gross features of the observed spectra but also the subtler properties which are revealed by the combination of very high - quality spectral and timing data . while a complete application is beyond the scope of this paper ,",
    "here we consider our results in the context of the spectacular phase - dependence which has been recently discovered in the the hard x - ray tails of the two axps 1rxs j1708 - 4009 and 4u 0142 + 61 @xcite .",
    "these deep _ integral _ observations have shown that , in both these sources , there are several different pulse components ( at least three ) with genuinely different spectra .",
    "the hard x - ray spectrum gradually changes with phase from a soft to an hard power law , the latter being significantly detected over a phase interval covering @xmath138 , or more , of the period .    in order to see how these features can ,",
    "at least qualitatively , be explained by our models , let us consider the locally twisted configurations discussed in   [ sec : spectra - locl ] which , among those presented so far , provide the most significant variations of the magnetic topology with the colatitude . let us introduce two angles , @xmath139 and @xmath140 , which give , respectively , the inclination of the los and of the magnetic axis with respect to the star spin axis .",
    "this allows us to take into account for the star rotation and hence derive pulse profiles and phase - resolved spectra .",

    "this is because resonant scattering over a population of ( relativistic ) electrons is then expected to be most efficient in producing a hard tail over the right phase interval , while the decrease of the depth at other phases results in a softening of the spectrum .",
    "a complete exploration of the parameter space aimed at searching for all configurations for which the previous condition is met is beyond the purposes of this paper . just for illustrative purpose ,",
    "let us consider one of those , i.e. an octupolar field with shear @xmath145 . by assuming this value and taking @xmath146 @xmath147 , we then computed phase resolved spectra and energy dependent lightcurves by using our monte carlo code .",
    "since we are dealing with photon energies @xmath148 kev , at which electron recoil and relativistic effects may become important , we performed the runs using a relativistic version of the code ( * ? ? ?",
    "* nobili , turolla & zane , in preparation ) .",
    "results are reported in figs .",
    "[ fig : spectra_phase ] and [ fig : spectra_phase2lobi ] .",
    "again in the spirit of probing the potentialities of our model , rather than a presenting a detailed fit , the parameter values in the monte carlo runs are the same as those adopted in  [ sec : spectra - locl ] , @xmath149 g , @xmath150 , @xmath120  kev and @xmath151  kev .",
    "we remark again that these values are not preferential , and that the results presented below do not critically depend on the model parameters .    as it can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra_phase ] , for a magnetic configuration with the shear concentrated in a single lobe , resonant comptonization gives rise to a hard tail which is quite pronounced at the peak of the pulse while it is depressed by almost an order of magnitude at pulse phases close to the minimum of the hard x - ray lightcurve .",
    "this is similar to what observed in axp 1rxs j1708 - 4009 and axp 4u0142 + 61 @xcite .",
    "this model also predicts a considerable variation of the pulsed fraction with energy , ranging from a few percent below 2  kev , to a few tens of percent from 2 to 10 kev and up to @xmath152 in the harder part of the spectrum .",
    "the comparison between modelled and observed phase - resolved spectra is beyond the scope of the present investigation .    for comparison",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra_phase_dip ] the same results computed by assuming a globally twisted dipolar magnetosphere , with the same shear and taking the same parameters for the viewing geometry and the monte carlo run .",
    "it is clear that the pulse resolved spectra and lightcurves obtained in this case are completely different and can not reproduce those observed from the two axps . in this case , the hard part of the spectrum show very little variation with the rotational phase and the lightcurve dependence on the energy is opposite to that shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra_phase ] , with a larger pulsed fraction expected in the soft band .",
    "spectra and lightcurves obtained with a local twist applied at both polar regions produce results which , again , are not in agreement with observations ( see fig . [",
    "fig : spectra_phase2lobi ] ) .",
    "as first discussed by @xcite , the external magnetic field of a magnetar likely possesses comparable poloidal and toroidal components . twisted magnetospheres around ultra - magnetized neutron stars have been shown to play a crucial role in shaping the emergent spectrum of sgrs / axps quiescent emission through efficient resonant scattering of thermal photons onto the charge carriers flowing along the field lines @xcite .",
    "in this paper we tackled the problem of constructing sheared magnetic equilibria more general than a dipole .",
    "we have show how sheared multipolar fields of arbitrary order can be computed by generalizing previous results by @xcite and @xcite . in order to assess the effects of different external field topologies on the emitted spectrum and pulse profiles we run a number of monte carlo simulations , using the code of @xcite , and compared the results to those of a sheared dipolar field .",
    "not surprisingly , the overall spectral shape does not change in going from a dipole to higher order multipoles and can be always described in terms of a `` blackbody plus power - law '' .",
    "there are , however , quite substantial differences among the multipoles in the spectra viewed at different angles .",
    "these are mainly due to the different particle distribution in the magnetosphere which is directly related to the assumed field topology .",
    "the case of an octupolar field has a special interest because it can be used to mimic a twist localized in a region close to the magnetic pole(s ) , and hence to investigate the properties of spectra produced in locally twisted magnetospheres .",
    "we have computed model spectra and lightcurves for the cases in which the twist is confined to one or both polar regions ( each region has semi - aperture @xmath153 ) , by assuming that only the polar lobes have a non - vanishing shear while the equatorial belt is potential .",
    "quite interestingly , a twist confined to a single lobe is the only configuration , among those we have explored , that is able to reproduce the main features of the high - energy ( @xmath13200 kev ) emission observed with _",
    "integral _ from the axps 1rxs j1708 - 4009 and 4u 0142 + 61 , in particular the large variation in the pulsed fraction at different energy bands @xcite .",
    "all magnetic equilibria we discussed in this paper are globally twisted , axially symmetric multipolar fields .",
    "of course , these configurations are far from being general and , even restricting to axial symmetry , represent only a subset of the solutions of the force - free equation .",
    "the magnetic field of a magnetar is likely to be quite complex . modelling it in terms of single multipolar components",
    "offers a way of gaining insight on the general properties of the magnetosphere but is far from providing a realistic picture of these sources .",
    "a major obstacle in obtaining more complete models for the sheared field is non - linearity of the force - free equation . given two force - free fields , @xmath154 and @xmath155 , the linear combination @xmath156 ( with @xmath157 and @xmath158 two constants ) is itself force - free only if @xmath159 .",
    "this implies that a generic sheared field can not be expressed as an expansion of sheared multipoles , or , conversely , that the superposition of twisted multipoles is not a force - free field .",
    "an obvious case in which the previous condition is satisfied is that of potential fields .",
    "since sheared fields depart smoothly from potential multipoles for @xmath160 , for small enough twists a linear combination of force - free twisted multipoles ( all with the same twist angle ) may provide an approximate force - free field .    despite many efforts",
    "have been devoted to develop techniques for solving the force - free equation , @xmath161 , no general , affordable method has been presented so far .",
    "the case of @xmath162 a constant has been discussed long ago by @xcite and more recently by @xcite , in connection with magnetars . if @xmath162 is a known function of position , @xcite presented an analytical method for solving the force - free equation also in the non - axisymmetric case .",
    "however , this is of little use for the problem of constructing self - consistent force - free magnetospheres since prescribing @xmath162 is tantamount to assign the currents which sustain the field , while for the case at hand the field and the supporting currents depend on each other .",
    "a completely general , analytical technique has been proposed by @xcite .",
    "this is based on a relativistic ( tensor ) description of the electromagnetic field and on the introduction of two scalar potentials which are the analogues of the classical euler potentials .",
    "it has been shown to be workable in the axisymmetric case ( a non - aligned rotator , * ? ? ? * ) and , for the particular case of a non - rotating , aligned magnetosphere , it is possible to verify that equation ( [ ode ] ) is recovered .",
    "further work on this is in progress and will be reported in a subsequent paper ( pavan et al .",
