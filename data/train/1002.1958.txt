    "every 3-manifold has a heegaard splitting .",
    "the minimal genus of the heegaard surface @xmath4 among all heegaard splittings is called the heegaard genus of @xmath0 . in @xcite ,",
    "the author proved the so - called generalized waldhausen conjecture .",
    "[ tli ] a closed orientable irreducible and atoroidal 3-manifold has only finitely many heegaard splittings in each genus , up to isotopy .",
    "an interesting feature in 3-manifold topology is that most decision problems are solvable .",
    "for example the word problem is solvable for 3-manifold groups but unsolvable for higher dimensional manifolds .",
    "one goal in 3-manifold topology is to find algorithms to determine all the geometric and algebraic properties of any given 3-manifold .",
    "however , the proof of theorem  [ tli ] in @xcite is not algorithmic because of a compactness argument on the projective measured lamination space of a branched surface . in this paper",
    ", we give an algorithmic proof of theorem  [ tli ] .",
    "this proof in fact gives us a slightly stronger theorem .",

    "note that theorem  [ tli ] is not true for toroidal manifolds as one may generate infinitely many non - isotopic heegaard splittings by dehn twists along an incompressible torus . in most part of this paper",
    ", we will assume @xmath0 is non - haken and in section  [ shaken ] we will show that the proof can be easily extended to atoroidal haken manifolds . note that the haken case was previously proved by johannson @xcite ,    although theorem  [ tmain ] gives a complete list of heegaard splittings of bounded genus , there may be repetition in the list , i.e. , we do not have an algorithm to determine whether or not two heegaard splittings are isotopic .",
    "nevertheless , theorem  [ tmain ] immediately gives an algorithm to determine the heegaard genus of a 3-manifold and this answers one of a few major decision problems left in 3-manifold topology .",
    "[ cmain ] there is an algorithm to determine the heegaard genus of a closed orientable and atoroidal 3-manifold .",
    "note that if the 3-manifold is toroidal , a theorem of johannson @xcite gives an algorithm to determine the heegaard genus . in corollary  [ cmain ]",
    "we do not have to assume the manifold is irreducible , since the heegaard genus is additive under connected sum .    by a theorem of casson and gordon @xcite , in a non - haken 3-manifold ,",
    "an unstabilized heegaard splitting is strongly irreducible .",
    "so we can assume our heegaard splittings are strongly irreducible . by a theorem of rubinstein @xcite and stocking @xcite ,",
    "every strongly irreducible heegaard surface is isotopic to a normal or an almost normal surface . in this paper , we use branched surfaces to study almost normal heegaard surfaces . in section  [ spre ] ,",
    "we briefly review and prove some properties of 0-efficient triangulations and branched surfaces , which are the basic tools for the proof of the main theorem . from normal surface theory , we know that there is a finite set of fundamental solutions that generate all normal and almost normal surfaces . using a 0-efficient triangulation , we may assume the surfaces in the fundamental solutions have non - positive euler characteristic .",
    "since the genus of our heegaard surface is bounded , one can express the strongly irreducible heegaard surface as a sum @xmath5 where each @xmath6 is a normal torus in the fundamental set of solutions and there are only finitely many choices for @xmath7 .",
    "if the coefficients @xmath8 are all bounded , then there are only finitely many possible such heegaard surfaces and the main theorem follows .",
    "our task is to study the situation that the coefficients @xmath8 are unbounded , and our main tool is branched surface .    in section  [ sd2 ] ,",
    "we perform some isotopies and compressions on a heegaard surface carried by a branched surface to eliminate certain  bubbles \" called @xmath9 regions .",
    "these isotopies are very simple and canonical , but it is surprisingly difficult to prove that the process ends in finitely many steps . to prove this , we have to compress the heegaard surface and recover the original heegaard surface in the end . a key part of the proof of the main theorem is an analysis of the intersection of normal tori carried by a branched surface . in sections [ ssum ] and [ sinter ] ,",
    "we study the intersection of normal tori carried by a branched surface .",
    "we show that either those coefficients @xmath8 above are bounded and hence the main theorem holds , or the normal tori have a nice intersection pattern . in section  [ sengulf ] , we show that in the latter case , the normal tori with nice intersection pattern lie in some nice solid tori .",
    "then we apply a theorem of scharlemann @xcite on the intersection of a solid torus and a strongly irreducible heegaard surface to show that all but finitely many such heegaard surfaces are isotopic .    in @xcite ,",
    "the author proved a much stronger theorem , which says that there are only finitely many irreducible heegaard splittings in a non - haken 3-manifold , without the genus constraint .",
    "the proof in @xcite also uses measured laminations , so one would hope the methods in this paper can be used to give an algorithmic proof of this theorem .    throughout this paper , for any topological space @xmath10 , we use @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 to denote the interior , number of components and closure of @xmath10 respectively . unless specified , we will assume each of our surfaces is embedded and assume the surfaces are in general position if they intersect .",
    "similar to the proof in @xcite , we make extensive use of branched surfaces and 0-efficient triangulations . in this section ,",

    "note that , similar to the discussion at the end of the proof of lemma  [ lfinite ] , after isotopy and setting @xmath1230 to be sufficiently large , we may assume the almost vertical arcs associated to the almost heegaard surface @xmath4 are disjoint from the dehn twist along @xmath67 .",
    "hence we may assume the dehn twist along @xmath67 above does not affect the arcs associated to @xmath4 . in particular , the total length of the almost vertical arcs associated to @xmath4 is not changed by the dehn twist .",

    ", we can algorithmically find a good torus @xmath67 ( as in lemma  [ lgoodone ] ) such that @xmath67 non - trivially intersects @xmath548 and @xmath1236 is a regular set .",
    "let @xmath1210 be as above .",
    "let @xmath548 be a connected component of @xmath1213 and let @xmath1237 be the set of tori in @xmath548 . by lemma  [ lsolid ] , there is a torus @xmath1178 bounding a solid torus that contains @xmath548 .",
    "by lemma  [ lengulf ] , if each @xmath1180 for some constant @xmath132 which depends on @xmath1238 , then @xmath1239 is a union of essential non - meridional curves parallel to the double curves of @xmath548 .",
    "now we algorithmically find the number @xmath132 in lemma  [ lengulf ] and let @xmath1240 be the set of surfaces @xmath1241 where @xmath1235 and each @xmath1242 .",

    "note that the subset @xmath1244 above is also a regular set of tori .",
    "so we can consider the connected components of @xmath1246 and repeat the arguments above .",
    "eventually , we can find a finite set of surfaces @xmath1247 such that the almost strongly irreducible heegaard surface @xmath4 above has the form @xmath1248 , where @xmath7 and @xmath1244 have the following properties :    1 .",
    "@xmath1249 and @xmath1244 is a regular set of tori in @xmath1128 2 .   for each connected component @xmath548 of @xmath1246 , let @xmath1178 denote the torus as in lemma  [ lsolid ] that bounds a solid torus containing @xmath548 , then @xmath1238 ( if not empty ) consists of curves parallel to the double curves of @xmath548 as in lemma  [ lengulf ] , in particular @xmath1238 are essential and non - meridional in @xmath1178 .",
    "each connected component of @xmath1246 lies in a solid torus as above .",
    "we can find a collection of disjoint solid tori that contain @xmath1246 .",
    "let @xmath121 be the union of these solid tori .",
    "our surface @xmath1248 is an almost strongly irreducible heegaard surface .",
    "let @xmath1250 be the almost vertical arcs associated to @xmath4 and by the argument above , we already know an upper bound @xmath1191 of the total length of the arcs in @xmath1250 .",
    "each arc in @xmath1250 is an arc properly embedded in @xmath96 . as @xmath1248",
    ", we may view @xmath1250 as a set of arcs between @xmath7 and these @xmath86 copies of @xmath6 s ( @xmath1251 ) . as the total number of components of @xmath1250 is at most @xmath1190 ( where @xmath1190 is the genus of the heegaard surface ) , if @xmath1252 , at least one copy of @xmath6 in the sum above is not incident to @xmath1250 .",
    "thus after enlarging @xmath1247 to include surfaces of the form @xmath1253 with each @xmath1254 , we may assume , for each summand @xmath1200 in our expression of @xmath4 above , we have @xmath1252 .",
    "so we may assume that , after isotopy , each arc in @xmath1250 lies either totally inside the solid tori @xmath121 or totally outside @xmath121 .",
    "since @xmath1247 is a finite set and @xmath1255 , there are only finitely many possible configurations for @xmath1256 . by listing all the surfaces in @xmath1247",
    ", we can algorithmically list all possible configurations for @xmath4 outside the solid tori @xmath121 .",
    "as the total length of the arcs in @xmath1250 is bounded , using the finite possible configurations of @xmath4 outside @xmath121 , we can use lemma  [ lal ] to algorithmically list all possible almost vertical arcs outside @xmath121 .",
    "thus we can list all possible configurations for the heegaard surface @xmath66 ( derived from @xmath4 ) outside the solid tori @xmath121 .",
    "for any connected component @xmath548 of @xmath1246 , let @xmath1257 be the solid torus containing @xmath548 and with @xmath1258 .",
    "we may assume @xmath1257 is a component of @xmath121 .",
    "by our assumption , @xmath1238 consists of essential and non - meridional curves in @xmath1178 .",
    "so by a theorem of scharlemann ( i.e.  theorem  [ tsch ] above ) , @xmath1259 is standard .",
    "since there are only finitely many possible configuration for a strongly irreducible heegaard surface @xmath66 outside the solid tori @xmath121 , we can use the curves @xmath1238 to list all possible surface types in @xmath1260 .",
    "thus , up to isotopy , @xmath1261 can produce only finitely many different strongly irreducible heegaard surfaces and we can algorithmically produce a list of surfaces containing all of them . as @xmath1247 and the set @xmath1128 are finite , we can use all possible @xmath1249 and all possible subsets @xmath1244 as above to produce a final list of surfaces that contain all strongly irreducible heegaard surfaces of genus at most @xmath1190 .    using haken s algorithm @xcite and the algorithm to recognize a 3-ball @xcite , we can determine whether or not each side of a surface is a handlebody .",
    "so we can determine which surfaces in our list are heegaard surfaces .",
    "although some surfaces in our list may be isotopic , the list is a complete list of all possible strongly irreducible heegaard surfaces of genus at most @xmath1190 . in a non - haken 3-manifold ,",
    "every heegaard splitting is either strongly irreducible or a stabilization of a strongly irreducible heegaard splitting .",
    "so after some stabilizations , we obtain a complete list of heegaard splittings of genus at most @xmath1190 .",
    "in this section , we discuss the case that our manifold @xmath0 is an atoroidal haken 3-manifold .",
    "we still assume @xmath0 is closed , orientable , irreducible and atoroidal .",
    "by @xcite , since @xmath0 is atoroidal , we can assume @xmath0 has a 0-efficient triangulation . by the argument above",
    ", we can produce a finite list of heegaard splittings of genus at most @xmath1190 such that all the strongly irreducible heegaard splittings of genus at most @xmath1190 are in this list . to prove theorem  [ tmain ] for haken atoroidal manifolds , we still need to find all weakly reducible heegaard splittings of genus at most @xmath1190 .",
    "by @xcite , any unstabilized weakly reducible heegaard splitting can be expressed as an amalgamation along a collection of incompressible surfaces in @xmath0 using strongly irreducible heegaard splittings of the submanifolds of @xmath0 bounded by these incompressible surfaces . in particular , the sum of the genera of the incompressible surfaces is at most the genus of the weakly reducible heegaard splitting .",
    "it follows from @xcite that , up to isotopy , an atoroidal 3-manifold has only finitely many incompressible surfaces of each genus .",
    "in fact , in the algorithm above for strongly irreducible heegaard surfaces , one can easily check that all the lemmas remains true if we replace strongly irreducible heegaard surface by incompressible surface ( most cases we considered do not exist for incompressible surfaces ) .",
    "this means that we can algorithmically find all incompressible surfaces in @xmath0 of genus at most @xmath1190 .",
    "note that the algorithm for incompressible surfaces is much simpler , since we can assume the branched surface that fully carries an incompressible surface does not have any monogon , see @xcite .",
    "we can list all possible incompressible surfaces in @xmath0 with genus at most @xmath1190 and consider the strongly irreducible heegaard splittings of a submanifold @xmath68 bounded by these incompressible surfaces .",
    "we may assume the incompressible surface @xmath1262 is a normal surface with respect to the 0-efficient triangulation of @xmath0 .",
    "so @xmath68 has an induced cell decomposition from the 0-efficient triangulation .",
    "by @xcite ( see lemmas 4 and 5 of @xcite ) , we may assume a strongly irreducible heegaard surface of @xmath68 is normal or almost normal with respect to this cell decomposition .",
    "since ( 1 ) each ( induced ) 3-cell in @xmath68 is a block in a tetrahedron bounded by normal disks , ( 2 ) the heegaard surface of @xmath68 is disjoint from @xmath1262 and ( 3 ) the boundary curve of each almost normal piece consists of normal arcs in the 2-skeleton , it is easy to see that any normal disk or almost normal piece ( that is disjoint from @xmath1262 ) of each 3-cell in @xmath68 remains a normal disk or an almost normal piece of the corresponding tetrahedron of @xmath0 .",
    "thus any normal or almost normal surface in @xmath1263 is also a normal or an almost normal surface in @xmath0 . in particular , since @xmath1262 is incompressible in @xmath68 , any normal torus in @xmath1263 must bound a solid torus in @xmath68 .",
    "thus we can consider branched surfaces in @xmath1263 formed by normal disks and at most one almost normal piece and apply our algorithm in section  [ sproof ] to list all strongly irreducible heegaard surfaces of @xmath68 with genus at most @xmath1190 .",
    "therefore , we can list all possible disjoint incompressible surfaces of genus sum at most @xmath1190 and list all possible strongly irreducible heegaard surfaces ( of genus at most @xmath1190 ) in each submanifold bounded by the incompressible surfaces . by amalgamating these heegaard surfaces along incompressible surfaces ,",
    "we obtain a list of heegaard surfaces of @xmath0 which contains all weakly reducible heegaard surfaces of @xmath0 with genus at most @xmath1190 ."
