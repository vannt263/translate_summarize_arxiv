    "the rvs is a slitless spectrograph whose spectral domain is 847 - 874 nm and resolving power @xmath2 .",
    "the expected accuracy is 1 km s@xmath1 for f0 to k0 stars brighter than v@xmath3 , and for k1 to k4 stars brighter than v@xmath4 .",
    "the main scientific objectives of rvs are the chemistry and dynamics of the milky way , the detection and characterisation of multiple systems and variable stars ( for more details , see * ? ? ?",
    "those objectives will be achieved from a spectroscopic survey of :    * radial velocities ( @xmath5 objects , v @xmath6 ) * rotational velocities ( @xmath7 objects , v @xmath8 ) * atmospheric parameters ( @xmath7 objects , v @xmath8 ) * abundances ( @xmath9 objects , v @xmath10 )    each star will be observed @xmath11 times on average by rvs over the 5 years of the mission .",
    "because the rvs has no calibration module on board , the zero point of its radial velocities has to be determined from reference sources .",
    "ground - based observations of a large sample of well - known , stable reference stars as well as of asteroids are thus critical for the calibration of the rvs .",
    "a sample of 1420 candidate standard stars has been established @xcite and has to be validated by high spectral resolution observations .",
    "two measurements per candidate star are being made before gaia is launched ( or one , depending on already available archived data ) .",
    "another measurement will occur during the mission .",
    "the measurements will allow us to check the temporal stability of radial velocities , and to reject any targets with significant rv variation .",
    "the ongoing observations are performed with three high spectral resolution spectrographs :    * sophie on the 1.93-m telescope at observatoire de haute - provence , * narval on the tlescope bernard lyot at observatoire pic - du - midi , * coralie on the euler swiss telescope at la silla .    as of june 2011",
    "we have observed 995 distinct candidates with sophie , coralie and narval .",
    "the detailed observations per instrument are :    * 691 stars ( 1165 velocities ) with sophie * 669 stars ( 945 velocities ) with coralie * 93 stars ( 98 velocities ) with narval    figure  [ chemin : fig1 ] ( left - hand panel ) represents the spatial distribution in the equatorial frame of the sample and the number of measurements per object we have done so far with the three instruments .",
    "in addition to those new observations , we use radial velocity measurements available from the spectroscopic archives of two other high - resolution instruments : elodie , which is a former ohp spectrograph , and harps which is currently observing at the eso la silla 3.6-m telescope .",
    "the archived data allow us to recover 1057 radial velocities for 292 stars ( elodie ) and 1289 velocities for 113 stars ( harps ) .    figure  [ chemin : fig1 ] ( right - hand panel ) summarizes the status of the total number of measurements for the sample of 1420 candidate stars performed with all five instruments .",
    "we have derived the variation of radial velocity of each star for which we have at least two velocity measurements separated by an elapsed time of at least 100 days .",
    "these stars represent a subsample of 1044 among 1420 targets .",
    "the variation is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum velocities , as reported in the frame of the sophie spectrograph .",
    "its distribution is displayed in figure  [ chemin : fig2 ] .",
    "a candidate is considered as a reference star for the rvs calibration when its radial velocity does not vary by more than an adopted threshold of 300 m s@xmath1 .",
    "such a threshold has been defined to satisfy the condition that the variation of the rv of a candidate must be well smaller than the expected rvs accuracy ( 1 km s@xmath1 at best for the brightest stars ) . as a result , we find @xmath12 of the 1044 stars exhibiting a variation larger than 300 m s@xmath1 , as derived from available measurements performed to date .",
    "those variable stars will have to be rejected from the list of standard stars .",
    "note that about 75% of the 1044 stars have very stable rv , at a level of variation smaller than 100 m s@xmath1 .",
    "stability threshold.,width=377 ]",
    "observations of asteroids are very important for the radial velocity calibration .",
    "indeed they will be used to determine the zero - points of the rvs measured with sophie , coralie and narval ( as well as the gaia - rvs zero - point ) .",
    "those goals will be achieved by comparing the spectroscopic rvs of asteroids from ground - based measurements with theoretical kinematical rvs from celestial mechanics .",
    "the theoretical rvs are provided by imcce and are known with an accuracy better than 1 m s@xmath1 .",
    "about 280 measurements of 90 asteroids have been done so far .    as an illustration , figure",
    "[ chemin : fig3 ] ( left - hand panel ) displays the residual velocity ( observed minus computed rvs ) of asteroids observed by the sophie instrument as a function of the observed rvs .",
    "the average residual of asteroids observed with sophie is 30 m s@xmath1 and the scatter is 38 m s@xmath1 .    in figure  [ chemin : fig3 ]",
    "( right - hand panel ) we also show the variation of the residual rvs with time . it nicely shows how stable the rvs are as a function of time .",
    "the residual rvs are relatively constant within the quoted errors .",
    "the error - bars represent the dispersion of all measurements performed at each observational run .",
    "their amplitude is mainly related to the conditions of observations that differ from one session to another ( in particular the moonlight contamination ) .",
    "though significant ( between 10 and 50 m s@xmath1 ) those error - bars remain smaller than our target stability criterion of 300 m s@xmath1 , which will enable us to determine correctly the rv zero point of each instrument .    .",
