    "a subset of supernovae ( sne ) and gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) requires an additional source of energy input over an extended period of time in order to explain the observed evolution of their brightness or light curve .",
    "the magnetar model can provide such an energy and timescale ( see , e.g. @xcite for grbs and @xcite for sne ) , and this model has been used quite successfully ( see , e.g. @xcite for grbs and @xcite for sne ) .",
    "the magnetar model pre - supposes that a rapidly rotating magnetar ( i.e. neutron star with spin period @xmath10 and magnetic field @xmath11 ; see , e.g. @xcite , for review of magnetars ) forms during the sn .",
    "the newborn magnetar supplies extra energy to power the sn or grb light curve via its large rotational energy @xmath12 where @xmath0 @xmath13 and @xmath14 @xmath15 are the magnetar angular spin frequency and moment of inertia , respectively .",
    "this rotational energy is deposited within the sn on the timescale over which the magnetar loses energy via magnetic dipole radiation , i.e. @xmath16 where @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath5 are initial spin frequency and period , respectively , @xmath19 , and we assume a neutron star mass @xmath20 , radius @xmath21 , and @xmath22 hereafter .",
    "magnetic dipole radiation energy loss @xmath23 is the power supplied by the magnetar @xmath24 to the sn and is given by @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the angle between stellar rotation and magnetic axes ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) . for simplicity , we assume an orthogonal rotator , i.e. @xmath27 .",
    "it is also worth noting that while the theoretical minimum spin period is @xmath28 @xcite , the lowest observed radio pulsar spin period is 1.4  ms @xcite .",
    "the millisecond magnetar model for sne and grbs is useful because it provides an easy explanation for the requisite extra energy and timescale .",
    "these last two map directly to the initial magnetar magnetic field and spin period ( see equations  [ eq : erot ] and [ eq : tmag ] ) , with somewhat weaker dependence on other parameters ( see below ) .",
    "however , the effect of emission of gravitational waves ( gws ) merits consideration because gw energy loss @xmath29 scales with spin frequency at a higher power than the scaling of magnetic dipole radiation ( see equation  [ eq : erot ] ) , and thus the assumption and need for rapid rotation can lead to @xmath30 .",
    "gws from a neutron star can be produced in two ways , by a static quadrupolar deformation ( ` mountain ' ) or by a fluid oscillation ( see , e.g. @xcite ) . for a mountain with size @xmath31 ,",
    "the gw energy loss rate and timescale are ( see , e.g. @xcite ) @xmath32 respectively , where @xmath33 and @xmath34 . alternatively ,",
    "if the neutron star has a r - mode oscillation with amplitude @xmath35 @xcite , then the gw energy loss rate and timescale are ( see , e.g. @xcite ) @xmath36 respectively , where @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "note that @xmath39 @xmath40 and @xmath41 @xmath42 are derived using a @xmath43 polytrope with @xmath44 @xcite , whereas we take @xmath21 , but this difference will not change our results qualitatively .",
    "gw emission by the magnetar has a two - fold effect on its ability to provide extra power to a sn or grb : ( 1 ) by causing the neutron star spin rate @xmath0 to decrease faster than by magnetic dipole radiation ( when @xmath45 or @xmath46 ; see below ) , the timescale over which @xmath47 is supplied to the sn / grb is shorter ; ( 2 ) since the energy emitted by gws is not imparted to the sn / grb , the time evolution of the energy supplied to the sn / grb changes , and thus the predicted light curve changes . in section  [ sec",
    ": magnetar ] , we use ( 1 ) and inferred values of initial spin period @xmath5 and magnetic field @xmath4 to obtain the simplest constraint on gw ellipticity @xmath31 and amplitude @xmath35 . in section  [ sec : magnetargw ] , we account for gws within the magnetar model of @xcite in order to evaluate the effect on light curves and compare to the magnetar model without gws .",
    "we summarize and briefly discuss our results in section  [ sec : discuss ] .",
    "we note that several recent works performed similar analysis to that done here .",
    "@xcite compare timescales @xmath48 and @xmath45 in order to constrain @xmath31 for superluminous sne , while @xcite do the same for short grbs ; these works assume that the spin period evolution is determined by _ either _ magnetic dipole radiation or gw emission due to an ellipticity , as is done in section  [ sec : magnetar ] , whereas their combined effects are considered in section  [ sec : magnetargw ] .",
    "@xcite use a somewhat more detailed model compared to that presented in section  [ sec : magnetargw ] in order to evaluate effects of gws ( with @xmath31 due to extreme magnetic fields ) on light curves of superluminous sne ( see also @xcite for grbs ) .",
    "in this section , we consider the simplest gw effect on the magnetar model .",
    "we assume that some sn and grb light curves are well - explained by the magnetar model _ without _ gws . as a result of fits to these light curves ,",
    "the magnetar initial spin period @xmath5 and magnetic field @xmath4 are extracted ( see , e.g. @xcite ) . for the neutron star spin rate to decrease by only magnetic dipole radiation , the timescale for this energy loss must be shorter than that due to gws , i.e. @xmath49 or @xmath50 and @xmath51 or @xmath52 thus the constraint on gw ellipticity @xmath31 and r - mode amplitude @xmath35 are @xmath53 respectively , because otherwise the neutron star spin rate would decrease more quickly than it would in the magnetar model without gws .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : epsilon ] ) is identical to that found in @xcite , and thus our constraints on @xmath31 are the same as theirs .",
    "@xcite derive a nearly identical constraint equation for @xmath31 but include an efficiency factor which leads to constraints about ten times smaller .",
    "our constraints on @xmath31 and @xmath35 are shown in figs  [ fig : ellip ] and [ fig : rmode ] , alongside inferred @xmath5 and @xmath4 compiled by @xcite for sne and @xcite for grbs ; note that these inferred spin period and magnetic field values are derived from fits of observed light curves using a model that assumes no contribution by gw energy loss .",
    "we see that ellipticity is constrained to be @xmath54 and r - mode amplitude is constrained to be @xmath55 for many sne . because of its low inferred magnetic field ( thus weaker magnetic dipole radiation loss ) and fast inferred rotation rate , asassn-15lh has the strongest constraints of @xmath56 and @xmath57 . while sources with lower @xmath4 and/or @xmath5 provide stronger gw constraints , the magnetar contribution to the sn / grb light curve ( i.e. @xmath24 ; see equation  [ eq : lmag ] ) decreases with lower magnetic field , such that shorter spin period is preferred .",

    "note that we neglect evolution of the r - mode amplitude since @xmath35 can reach saturation at @xmath134 or much lower @xcite in @xmath135 @xcite at @xmath136 @xcite and thus its evolution is not relevant for sne but may be relevant for grbs @xcite .",

    "<S> the light curve of many supernovae ( sne ) and gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) can be explained by a sustained injection of extra energy from its possible central engine , a rapidly rotating strongly magnetic neutron star ( i.e. magnetar ) . the magnetic dipole radiation power that the magnetar supplies comes at the expense of the star s rotational energy . however , radiation by gravitational waves ( gws ) can be more efficient than magnetic dipole radiation because of its stronger dependence on neutron star spin rate @xmath0 , i.e. @xmath1 ( for a static ` mountain ' ) or @xmath2 ( for a r - mode fluid oscillation ) versus @xmath3 for magnetic dipole radiation . here , we use the magnetic field @xmath4 and initial spin period @xmath5 inferred from sn and grb observations to obtain simple constraints on the dimensionless amplitude of the mountain of @xmath6 and r - mode oscillation of @xmath7 , the former being similar to that obtained by recent works . </S>",
    "<S> we then include gw emission within the magnetar model . </S>",
    "<S> we show that when @xmath8 or @xmath9 , light curves are strongly affected , with significant decrease in peak luminosity and increase in time to peak luminosity . </S>",
    "<S> thus the gw effects studied here are more pronounced for low @xmath4 and short @xmath5 but are unlikely to be important in modelling sn and grb light curves since the amplitudes needed for noticeable changes are quite large .    </S>",
