    "various methods have been recently developed to estimate the mass of matter contained in giant molecular clouds ( gmc ) using millimetric and far infrared observations @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the mapping of the optical / near  infrared extinction , based on star counts still remain the most straightforward way to estimate the mass in form of dust grains .",
    "these maps can be usefully compared to longer wavelength emission maps in order to derive the essential physical parameters of the interstellar medium such as the gas to dust mass ratio , the clumpiness of the medium or the optical and morphological properties of the dust grains .",
    "the star count method was first proposed by wolf @xcite and has been applied to schmidt plates during several decades .",
    "it consists to count the number of stars by interval of magnitudes ( i.e. between @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) in each cell of a regular rectangular grid in an obscured area and to compare the result with the counts obtained in a supposedly unextinguished region . in order to improve the spatial resolution ,",
    "bok @xcite proposed to make count up to the completeness limiting magnitude ( @xmath6 ) . since the number of stars counted is much larger when compared to counts performed in an interval of 1 magnitude",

    "@xcite using this second method .",
    "even more recently , andreazza and vilas - boas @xcite obtained extinction map of the corona australis and lupus clouds .",
    "counts were done _ visually _ using a @xmath7 magnification microscope . with the digitised schmidt plates the star counts method can be worked out much more easily across much larger fields .",
    "the star count methods have also tremendously evolved thanks to the processing of digital data with high capacity computers .",
    "cambrsy et al .",
    "@xcite , for instance , have developed a counting method , for the denis data in the chamaeleon i cloud , that takes advantage of this new environment .",

    "the star counts method is based on the comparison of local stellar densities .",
    "a drawback of the classical method is that it requests a grid step .",
    "if the step is too small , this may lead to empty cells in highly extinguished regions , and if it is too large , it results in a low spatial resolution .",
    "my new approach consists in fixing the number of counted stars per cell rather than the step of the grid . since uncertainties in star",
    "counts follow a poissonian distribution , they are independent of the local extinction with an adaptive grid where the number of stars in each cell remains constant .",
    "practically , i used a fixed number of 20 stars per cell and a filtering method involving a wavelet decomposition that filters the noise .",
    "this method has been described in more details by cambrsy @xcite .",
    "i have applied the method to 24 gmcs .",
    "counts and filtering are fully automatic . because of the wide field ( @xmath2 square degrees for orion ) , the counts must be corrected for the variation of the background stellar density with galactic latitude .",
    "extinction and stellar density are related by : @xmath8    where @xmath9 is the extinction at the wavelength @xmath10 , @xmath11 is the background stellar density , @xmath12 the density in the reference field ( depending on the galactic latitude @xmath13 ) , and @xmath14 is defined by : @xmath15    where @xmath16 is the magnitude at the wavelength @xmath10 .",
    "assuming an exponential law for the stellar density , @xmath17 , a linear correction with the galactic latitude @xmath13 must be applied to the extinction value given by eq .",
    "( [ extinction ] ) .",
    "the correction consists , therefore , in subtracting @xmath18 = \\log ( d_0 ) - \\alpha |b| \\ , \\log { \\rm ( e)}$ ] to the extinction value @xmath19 .",
    "this operation corrects the slope of @xmath19 which becomes close to zero , and set the zero point of extinction .",

    "@xcite for which @xmath20 and @xmath21 .    here",
    ", the usno - pmm catalogue @xcite is used to derive the extinction map .",
    "it results from the digitisation of poss ( down to @xmath22 in declination ) and eso plates ( @xmath23 ) in blue and red .",
    "internal photometry estimators are believed to be accurate to about 0.15 magnitude but systematic errors can reach 0.25 magnitude in the north and 0.5 magnitude in the south . astrometric error is typically of the order of 0.25 arcsecond .",
    "this accuracy is an important parameter in order to count only once those stars which are detected twice because they are located in the overlap of two adjacent plates .",
    "all the extinction maps presented here have been drawn in greyscale with iso  extinction contours overlaid . on the right side of each map , a scale indicates the correspondence between colours and visual extinction , and the value of the contours .",
    "stars brighter than the @xmath24 visual magnitude @xcite are marked with a filled circle .",
    "bright stars can produce _ artifacts _ in the extinction maps .",
    "a very bright star , actually , produces a large disc on the plates that prevents the detection of the fainter star ( for example , @xmath25 crux in the coalsack or _",
    "antares _ in @xmath0 ophiuchus , in fig .",
    "[ coalsack ] and [ rho_oph ] , respectively ) .",
    "the magnitude of _ antares _ is @xmath26 , and it shows up in the extinction map as a disc of 35  diameter which mimics an extinction of 8 magnitudes",
    ". moreover _ antares _ is accompanied of reflection nebulae that prevent source extraction . in fig .",
    "[ orion ] the well known orion constellation is drawn over the map and the brighter stars appear .",
    "@xmath27 ( _ alnilam _ ) the central star of the constellation , free of any reflection nebula , is represented by a disc of @xmath28 for a magnitude of @xmath29 .",
    "fortunately , these artifacts can be easily identified when the bright star is isolated .",
    "when stars are in the line of sight of the obscured area , the circularity of a small extinguished zone is just an indication , but the only straightforward way to rule out a doubt is to make a direct visual inspection of the schmidt plate .",
    "reflection nebulae are a more difficult problem to identified since they are not always circular .",
    "each time it was possible , i chose the @xmath30 plate because the reflection is much lower in @xmath30 than in @xmath31 .",
    "@xmath31 plates were preferred when @xmath30 plates showed obvious important defaults ( e.g. edge of the plate ) .",
    "extinction estimations suffer from intrinsic and systematic errors .",
    "intrinsic uncertainties result essentially from the star counts itself .",
    "the obtained distribution follows a poisson law for which the parameter is precisely the number of stars counted in each cell , i.e. 20 .",
    "equation ( [ extinction ] ) shows that two multiplicative factors , depending on which colour the star counts is done , are needed to convert the stellar density into visual extinction .",
    "these factors are @xmath14 ( the slope of the luminosity function ( [ lum_funct ] ) ) , and the conversion factor @xmath32 . for @xmath31 and @xmath30 band ,",
    "the derived extinction accuracies are @xmath33 magnitudes and @xmath34 magnitudes , respectively .    also , for highly obscured region , densities are estimated from counts on large surfaces , typically larger than @xmath35 .",
    "it is obvious that , in this case , the true peak of extinction is underestimated since we have only an average value .",
    "the resulting effect on the extinction map is similar to the _ saturation _ produced by bright stars on schmidt plates .",
    "this effect can not be easily estimated and is highly dependant on the cloud ( about @xmath36 magnitudes in @xmath0 ophiuchus , see sect .",
    "[ max_ext ] ) .    moreover , systematic errors due to the determination of the zero point of extinction are also present .",

    "blitz and williams @xcite claim , however , that clouds are no longer fractal since they found a characteristic size scale in the taurus cloud .",
    "they showed that the taurus cloud is not fractal for a size scale of 0.25 - 0.5 pc which may correspond to a transition from a turbulent outer envelope to an inner coherent core .",
    "this is not inconsistent with a fractal representation of the cloud for size scales greater than 0.5 pc .",
    "fractal in physics are defined over a number of decades and have _ always _ a lower limit .",
    "fractal structures in clouds can be characterized by a linear relation between the radius of a circle and the mass that it encompasses in a log - log diagram .",
    "several definitions of fractal exist , and this definition can be written @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the radius of the circle and @xmath11 the fractal dimension of the cloud .",
    "the mass measured is , in fact , contained in a cylinder of base radius @xmath51 and of undefined height @xmath52 ( because the cloud depth is not constant over the surface of the base of the cylinder ) . in our case , we are interested in the relation between the mass and the extinction . since the extinction is related to the size @xmath52 , which represents the depth of the cloud as defined above , we seek for a relation between mass and @xmath53 ( or @xmath52 ) , @xmath51 being now undefined .",
    "the logarithm of the mass is found to vary linearly with the extinction over a range of extinction magnitudes ( fig .",

    "[ mass_spec ] shows the relation between iso  extinction contours and the logarithm of the mass contained inside these contours for the taurus cloud ( see extinction map in fig .",
    "[ taurus ] ) .",
    "the relation is linear for @xmath56 . for higher extinction ,",
    "mass is deficient because the star count leads to underestimating the extinction . indeed , for highly extinguished regions , the low number density of stars requires a larger area to pick up enough stars and estimate the extinction .",
    "the result is therefore an average value over a large area in which the extinction is , in fact , greater . in the taurus cloud",
    ", i found that this turn off occurs for a size of @xmath57 pc . according to blitz and williams @xcite a turn off toward higher masses",
    "should appear for a size scale of @xmath58 pc .",
    "obviously , our value corresponds to a limitation of the star counts method with optical data and not to a real characteristic size scale of the cloud .",
    "it is therefore natural to extrapolate , down to a minimum mass , the linear part of the relation @xmath59 $ ] versus @xmath53 to determine a maximum of extinction .",
    "this maximum is obtained using the regression line ( [ regress ] ) and represents the higher extinction that can be measured , would the cloud be fractal at all size scales . as blitz and williams",
    "@xcite have shown , there is a characteristic size scale above which the density profile becomes steeper .",
    "the extrapolation of the linear relation gives , therefore , a lower limit for the densest core extinction .",
    "derived values of @xmath53 are presented in the @xmath24 column of table [ tab ] and correspond to a minimum mass of @xmath60 .",
    "this minimum mass is a typical stellar mass and , an extrapolation toward lower masses would be meaningless .    except for the carina cloud ,",
    "maxima are found in the range from 5.7 to 25.5 magnitudes of visual extinction with a median value of 10.6 magnitudes .",
    "we stress the point that extinction can be larger . the @xmath0 ophiuchus cloud , for example ,",
    "is known to show extinction peaks of about @xmath61 magnitudes @xcite , whereas we obtain only 25.5 magnitudes .",
    "nevertheless , this value compared to the 9.4 magnitudes effectively measured indicates that we need deeper optical observations or near  infrared data  such as those provided by the denis survey  to investigate more deeply the cloud .",
    "the coalsack and scorpius are the only clouds for which measured and extrapolated extinctions are similar ( see sect . [ remarks ] ) .      assuming a gas to dust ratio , the mass of a cloud can be obtained using the relation @xcite  : @xmath62 where @xmath25 is the angular size of a pixel map , @xmath63 the distance to the cloud , @xmath64 the mean molecular weight corrected for helium abundance , and @xmath65 is a pixel of the extinction map .",
    "uncertainties on the determination of masses come essentially from the distance which is always difficult to evaluate . assuming a correct distance estimation , error resulting from magnitude uncertainties",
    "can be evaluated : an underestimation of 0.5 magnitude of visual extinction implies a reduction of the total mass of a factor @xmath66 . according to savage and mathis @xcite , the gas to dust ratio is @xmath67 where @xmath68 .",
    "kim and martin @xcite show that this value depends on the total to selective extinction ratio @xmath69 . for @xmath70 , the gas to dust ratio",
    "would be divided by a factor 1.2 .",
    "the value of @xmath71 is supposed to be larger in molecular clouds than in the general interstellar medium but the variation with the extinction is not clearly established .",
    "so , i used the general value of 3.1 and the gas to dust ratio of savage and mathis .",
    "mass of the cores of the clouds may , therefore , be overestimated by a factor @xmath72 .    in fig .",
    "[ mass_spec ] , the relation @xmath59 $ ] vs. @xmath53 extrapolated toward the zero extinction gives an estimation of the total mass of the cloud using eq . ( [ regress ] ) .",

    "the median mass is @xmath73 and the range is from 80 to @xmath74 .",
    "using expression ( [ regress ] ) , we also remark that half of the total mass is located outside the iso  extinction curve 1.0 magnitudes .",
    "this value is remarkably stable from cloud to cloud with a standard deviation of 0.3 .",
    "in the vela and the serpens clouds ( fig . [ vela ] and [ serpens ] , respectively ) , there is no linear relation between @xmath59 $ ] and @xmath53 .",
    "extrapolation for the maximum of extinction or for the total mass estimations is not possible .",
    "however , mass lower limits can be obtained using the extinction map directly : @xmath75 and @xmath76 for vela and serpens , respectively .",
    "it is difficult to understand why there is no linear relation for these two clouds , even for low values of extinction .",
    "the study of the carina ( fig . [ carina ] ) presents aberrant values for the slope of the line @xmath59 $ ] ( see table [ tab ] ) .",
    "consequently , the maximum of the extrapolated extinction , 82 magnitudes , can not be trusted .",
    "the important reflection in the carina region is probably responsible for the shape of the extinction map .",
    "stars can not be detected because of the reflection and thus , extinction can not be derived from @xmath30 star counts .",
    "infrared data are requested to eliminate the contribution of the nebulae .",
    "the chamaeleon i has already been mapped with denis star counts in @xmath77 band @xcite and the maximum of extinction was estimated to be @xmath78 magnitudes . using @xmath31 star counts we find here 5.2 magnitudes .",
    "this difference is normal since @xmath77 is less sensitive to extinction than @xmath31 .",
    "the important remark is that the extrapolated value for the extinction derived from @xmath31 star counts is 12.9 , consistent with the value obtained with @xmath77 star counts .",
    "we obtain the same result for the chamaeleon ii cloud for which @xmath77 star counts lead also to a maximum of about @xmath78 magnitudes whereas the extrapolated value from @xmath31 counts is 12.3 magnitudes .",
    "infrared data are definitely necessary to investigate the cores of the clouds .    besides , the shape of the whole musca  chamaeleon extinction and the iras @xmath79 maps are very similar . disregarding the far  infrared gradient produced by the heating by the galactic plane",
    ", there is a good match of the far  infrared emission and extinction contours and filamentary connections .",
    "this region is well adapted to study the correlation between the extinction and the far  infrared emission because there is no massive stars which heat the dust .",
    "the @xmath80 flux can , therefore , be converted in a relatively straightforward way into a column density unit using the @xmath81 colour temperature @xcite .",
    "the extinction map of the coalsack is displayed in fig .",

    "the edge of the cloud contains the brightest star of the southern cross ( @xmath82 ) .",

    "more recently knude and hog @xcite estimate a distance of 100 - 150 pc using hipparcos data .",
    "finally , i adopted an intermediate value of 150 pc to derive the mass of the coalsack .",

    "regions i and ii which correspond to the northern part of the area near @xmath25 crux , are well correlated with the extinction map .",
    "nyman et al .",
    "have defined two other regions which have no obvious counterpart in extinction .",
    "region iii below -64of declination in the western part of the cloud is not seen in the extinction map and this may result of a scanning defect of the plates .",
    "the same problem exists for the region iv which is a filament in the eastern part of the cloud at @xmath83 .",

    "[ rho_oph ] ) . the 120 pc distance used to derive",
    "its mass is the @xmath0 ophiuchus distance @xcite . as for the coalsack cloud , measured and extrapolated extinction are similar : 6.4 and 7.0 , respectively .",
    "but , no evidence of a characteristic size scale can be found .",
    "for both clouds , this result is not surprising since the maximum of measured extinction reaches the extrapolated value .",
    "would dense cores with steeper extinction profile be found , the measured extinction would have been significantly greater than the extrapolated value .",
    "the extinction in this cloud has recently been derived using star counts on @xmath31 plates by andreazza and vilas - boas @xcite .",
    "our methods are very similar and we obtain , therefore , comparable results .",
    "the main difference comes from the most extinguished core .",
    "since they use a regular grid , they can not investigate cores where the mean distance between two stars is greater than their grid step .",
    "consequently , they obtained a plateau where i find 4 distinct cores .",
    "co observations are presented in lada et al . @xcite .",
    "the two eastern cores in the @xmath84co map have only one counterpart in the extinction map because the bright nebula , lynds 424 , prevents the star detections in that region .",
    "lada et al .",
    "@xcite also present an extinction map of a part of the cloud derived from @xmath85 colour excess observations .",
    "this colour is particularly well adapted for such investigations because , in one hand , infrared wavelengths allow deeper studies and , on the other hand , @xmath85 colour has a small dispersion versus the spectral type of stars .",
    "i obtain similar low iso  extinction contours but they reach a much greater maximum of visual extinction of about 20 magnitudes .",
    "new estimations of distance using hipparcos data @xcite have led to locate the lupus complex ( fig . [ lupus ] ) at only 100 pc from the sun .",
    "lupus turns out to be the most nearby star ",
    "forming cloud .",
    "this distance is used to estimate the complex mass but , it is important to remark that evidence of reddening suggests that dust material is present up to a distance of about 170 pc @xcite .",
    "masses could therefore be underestimated by a factor @xmath86 in these regions .",
    "the complex has been first separated into 4 clouds @xcite , and then , a fifth cloud has been recently discovered using @xmath84co survey @xcite .",
    "i have discovered , here , a sixth cloud which happens to be as massive as the lupus i cloud , @xmath87 ( assuming it is also located at 100 pc ) .",
    "the measured extinction for this cloud reaches 4.8 magnitudes .    the comparison between the @xmath84co and the extinction map is striking , especially for the lupus i cloud for which each core detected in the molecular observations has a counterpart in extinction .",
    "mass estimations can be compared on condition that the same field is used for both maps .",
    "moreover , @xmath84co observations are less sensitive than @xmath31 star counts for low extinction .",
    "the lower contour in the @xmath84co map corresponds to a visual extinction of @xmath66 magnitudes . using this iso  extinction contour to define the edge of the cloud and the same distance ( 150 pc ) as tachihara et al .",

    "the 3 large filaments are present in both maps .",
    "even if these regions are complex because several stars heat them , the comparison between the far  infrared emission and the extinction should allow to derive the dust temperature and a 3-dimensional representation of the cloud and of the stars involved in the heating .",
    "unfortunately , uncertainties about the distances for these stars are too large ( about 15% ) and corresponds roughly to the cloud size .",
    "maddalena et al @xcite have published a large scale co map of orion and monoceros r2 .",
    "masses derived from co emission are consistent with those i obtain : @xmath94 and @xmath95 for orion and monoceros r2 , respectively , from co data and @xmath96 and @xmath97 from the extinction maps .",
    "the orion b maps looks very alike .",
    "the orion a maps show a significant difference near the trapezium ( @xmath98 , @xmath99 ) where the young stars pollute the star counts .",
    "the correlation between co and extinction maps for monoceros r2 is less striking , because of the star forming activity .",
    "it is clear that star clusters involve an underestimation of the extinction , but i would like to stress the point that the heating by a star cluster may also destroy the co molecules .",
    "estimation of the column density from star counts and from co observations may , therefore , be substantially underestimated in regions such as the trapezium .",
    "onishi et al .",
    "@xcite have studied the cores in the taurus cloud using a c@xmath100o survey .",
    "all of the 40 cores identified in their survey are also detected in the extinction map .",
    "moreover , abergel et al . @xcite have shown a strong correlation between the far  infrared and the @xmath84co emission in that region . despite the complexity of the taurus structure ( filaments , cores ) ,",
    "it is a region , like the chamaeleon complex , located at high galactic latitude ( @xmath101 ) , without complex stellar radiation field .",
    "this situation is highly favourable to a large scale comparison of co , far  infrared and extinction maps .",
    "star counts technique is used since the beginning of the century and is still a very powerful way to investigate the distribution of solid matter in molecular clouds . now ,",
    "with the development of digital data , this technique become easy to use and can probe much larger areas . for all regions ,",
    "we have assumed that all stars were background stars .",
    "the error resulting from this hypothesis can easily be estimated .",
    "equation ( [ extinction ] ) can be written : @xmath102    where @xmath103 is the surface which contains @xmath104 stars .",
    "if 50% of the stars are foreground stars , the difference between the real extinction and the extinction which assumes all background stars is : @xmath105    that corresponds to @xmath106 or @xmath107 magnitudes of visual extinction whether star counts are done using @xmath31 or @xmath30 band , respectively .",
    "fortunately , most of the clouds are located at small or intermediate distances to the sun ( except the carina at 2500 pc ) and this effect is probably small , at least for low extinction .",
    "the good agreement between mass derived from extinction or from co data argues in that favour .",
    "stars physically associated to the clouds are more problematic because they are located precisely close to the extinction cores .",
    "young objects are generally faint in the optical band so this problem may be neglected for optical counts .",
    "this is no longer true with near  infrared data for which young objects must be removed before the star counts .",
    "we obtain extinction map with a spatial resolution always adapted to the local densities which are typically about @xmath108 for the outer part of cloud and @xmath35 for the most extinguished regions where the stellar density becomes very low , i.e. @xmath109 .",
    "these maps allow the estimation of the total mass of the cloud by extrapolation of the distribution of matter with the extinction .",
    "it appears that mass concentrated in the regions of low extinction represents an important part of the total mass of a cloud ( 1/2 is contained in regions of extinction lower than 1 magnitude ) .",
    "extrapolation of the distribution of matter in highly extinguished areas is more risky .",
    "star counts method give a relation for which masses are underestimated in the cores of the cloud for a well understood reason : estimation of the local density requires to pick up enough stars and thus , to use larger area because of the low number density .",

    "the extrapolated extinction is useful to estimate the _ saturation _ level in the extinction map , but it is important to keep in mind that extinction can be much larger in small cores .    finally , the examination of the relation between mass and extinction is useful to check what we are measuring .",
    "the carina cloud show an aberrant slope ( table [ tab ] ) which is a strong indication that the map can not be directly interpreted as an _ extinction _ map . in that case , the elimination of reflection nebulae is probably a solution and therefore , near - infrared data are requested to investigate the extinction . for the vela and the serpens cloud ,",

    "<S> this paper presents large scale extinction maps of most nearby giant molecular clouds of the galaxy ( lupus , @xmath0 ophiuchus , scorpius , coalsack , taurus , chamaeleon , musca , corona australis , serpens , ic 5146 , vela , orion , monoceros r1 and r2 , rosette , carina ) derived from a star count method using an adaptive grid and a wavelet decomposition applied to the optical data provided by the usno - precision measuring machine . </S>",
    "<S> the distribution of the extinction in the clouds leads to estimate their total individual masses @xmath1 and their maximum of extinction . </S>",
    "<S> i show that the relation between the mass contained within an iso  extinction contour and the extinction is similar from cloud to cloud and allows the extrapolation of the maximum of extinction in the range 5.7 to 25.5 magnitudes . </S>",
    "<S> i found that about half of the mass is contained in regions where the visual extinction is smaller than 1 magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> the star count method used on large scale ( @xmath2 square degrees ) is a powerful and relatively straightforward method to estimate the mass of molecular complexes . a systematic study of the all sky would lead to discover new clouds as i did in the lupus complex for which i found a sixth cloud of about @xmath3 . </S>"
