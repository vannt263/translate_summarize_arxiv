    "the mass density field can be inferred from the peculiar velocities of galaxies , independent of any a priori assumption on the relation or bias between visible and dark matter .",
    "the determination of the peculiar velocity field requires relatively large and uniform galaxy samples with high - fidelity distance measurements independent of the observed redshift .",
    "this can for instance be realized through the tully - fisher relation @xcite",
    ". however , peculiar velocity surveys are hardly feasible in the zoa where the obscuring effects of dust and stars in the milky way prevent the identification of galaxies across @xmath0% of the sky .",
    "while this problem can be circumvented by statistical interpolation of the mass distribution adjacent to the zoa , various papers such as those by @xcite and @xcite suggest that these solutions are inadequate and require unknown mass distributions to satisfactorily explain the peculiar motion of the local group with respect to the cosmic microwave background .",
    "several such dynamically important structures , including the great attractor ( ga ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and local void @xcite are known to reside within the zoa .",
    "the 2mass tully - fisher survey ( 2mtf ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is an ongoing project that aims at measuring tf distances for all bright inclined spirals in the 2mass redshift survey ( 2mrs ; * ? ? ?",
    ". the use of the nir bands will reduce the extinction effects due to the zoa .",
    "together with the new high - fidelity hi  measurements that are being obtained , the 2mtf will provide better statistics for the study of the local peculiar velocity flow field over the whole sky than ever before .",
    "however , there still remains a significant part of the sky that will be excluded by the 2mtf .",
    "we aim to provide tf data for galaxies in the zoa which the 2mtf avoids .",
    "these data will be used to measure , for the _ first time _ , the peculiar velocity flow field _ within _ the southern zoa .",
    "blind hi  surveys have been shown to be most effective at revealing galaxies in the zoa .",
    "the hi  parkes deep zone of avoidance survey , conducted on the @xmath1  m parkes radio telescope , detected over @xmath2 galaxies in the southern zoa . with an exposure time",
    "five times longer than hipass , the average rms noise of the survey was 6  mjy  beam@xmath3 .",
    "it covered a velocity range of @xmath4  kms@xmath3  with a channel spacing of @xmath5  kms@xmath3 .",
    "the survey covered the entire southern zoa visible from parkes : @xmath6 , @xmath7 @xcite ; @xmath8 and @xmath9 , @xmath7 ( northern extension ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; and @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , @xmath13 ( galactic bulge extension ; * ? ? ?",
    "the measurement of tf distances requires accurate hi  linewidths , the fidelity of which depends both on the velocity resolution and @xmath14 ratio of the spectrum .",
    "follow - up hi  line observations were carried out for @xmath15 galaxies with low @xmath14 and/or narrow linewidths in order to provide higher fidelity linewidths for the tf analysis .",
    "we have conducted a dedicated follow - up nir survey of hizoa galaxies within @xmath16  kms@xmath3 .",
    "the survey was conducted with the @xmath17  m irsf telescope using the sirius camera for simultaneous imaging in the @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 bands .",
    "the survey images have an exposure time of @xmath21  min resulting in a limiting magnitude approximately @xmath22 deeper than the 2mass survey .",
    "the deeper images and the superior resolution of the irsf ( @xmath23  pix@xmath3 ) allow for the detection of galaxies to higher levels of galactic extinction and stellar density . moreover , the field - of - view of the irsf ( @xmath24 ) is ideally suited to this survey given the positional accuracy of the hi  sources of @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "the observations for the follow - up survey were started in 2006 and were continued through to 2010 .",
    "unfortunately , a significant amount ( @xmath26% ) of the @xmath27 weeks allocated exclusively to this project was lost due to bad weather and serious problems with the detector cooling system in 2010 .",
    "the data were reduced using the ` sirius ` pipeline in iraf which implements the standard nir data reduction , including dark current subtraction , flat correction , sky determination and subtraction , and frame to frame offset determination and combination .",
    "the output images from the ` sirius ` pipeline were astrometrically and photometrically calibrated using the 2mass point source catalogue ( 2mpsc * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as a standard .",
    "the calibration was done with a combination of iraf and python scripts developed by dr .",
    "n.  matsunaga and modified by @xcite .",
    "possible hi  counterparts were identified in the respective nir images by a visual search of the three - colour images generated from the @xmath20 ( red ) , @xmath19 ( green ) and @xmath18 ( blue ) bands .",
    "their different colour and extended nature allows galaxies to be readily identified by eye .",
    "the increase in stellar density near the galactic plane results in heavy contamination by foreground stars .",
    "star - subtraction via psf - fitting was employed to remove the flux contribution of the foreground stars from the galaxy flux .",
    "the automated psf fitting routine for the norma wall survey developed by dr nagayama was modified to improve the subtraction of stars on edge - on disks and to prevent the removal of sub - structure within the disks of face - on spirals .",
    "figure  [ fig : ihabsub ] shows two examples of where the original star - subtraction routine resulted in residuals on the galaxy .",
