    "since the beginning of 2000 , the dependence of the casimir force acting between real metals on separation and temperature has been hotly debated .",
    "it is well known that van der waals and casimir forces act between closely - spaced macroscopic bodies .",
    "both forces are of the same physical nature and are caused by long wavelength electromagnetic fluctuations @xcite .",
    "the name `` van der waals '' is usually used in a nonrelativistic case when the force and other physical quantities depend on the planck constant @xmath0 , but do not depend on the velocity of light @xmath1 . in the relativistic case , which corresponds to larger separations ,",
    "the name `` casimir '' is commonly used , since he was the first to predict the force acting in vacuum between two parallel uncharged plates made of ideal metals @xcite . during the last few years dispersion forces ( which is the generic name for both kinds of forces caused by fluctuations )",
    "were actively investigated , not only theoretically but also experimentally ( see the monographs [ 35 ] and a review @xcite ) .",
    "this was motivated by many prospective applications of dispersion phenomena in fundamental physics and nanotechnology .",
    "in particular , the problem of an accurate theoretical description of dispersion forces between real bodies ( i.e. , taking into account the realistic conductivity properties , surface roughness and nonzero temperature ) took on great significance .",
    "this paper is devoted to the outstanding problems arising in the case of plates made of real metals and having nonzero temperature .",
    "the free energy of the dispersion interaction between two thick parallel plates ( semispaces ) described by a dielectric permittivity @xmath2 , with a gap of width @xmath3 between them in thermal equilibrium at temperature @xmath4 , was derived by lifshitz @xcite .",

    "the explicit form of these coefficients in the case of real metals is closely connected to the controversies which are the subject of this paper .",

    "the fluctuating electromagnetic field is considered both in the gap and in the interior of the dielectric semispaces with the continuity boundary conditions on their surfaces @xmath14 ( note that we do not consider ferromagnets and set @xmath15@xmath16@xmath17 ) .    of prime importance",

    "the drude model approach predicts 1/2 the magnitude of the casimir free energy and force than between ideal metals .",

    "its predictions are in qualitative agreement with the case of ideal metals .",
    "because of this , the plasma model approach is called `` traditional '' and the drude model approach is called `` alternative '' .",

    "@xcite disregard the fact that spatially nonlocal dielectric permittivities @xmath97 can be rigorously introduced only for an unbounded medium which is uniform in space @xcite . in the theory of the anomalous skin effect ,",
    "such permittivities are sometimes used in the presence of boundaries ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "this is an approximation applicable to the investigation of some bulk effects , when physical phenomena caused by a layer adjacent to the boundary surface are neglected .",
    "( there is another approach to the theory of the anomalous skin effect @xcite which only deals with the leontovich impedance . ) in any case , it is unlikely that the approximate phenomenological approach using nonlocal @xmath97 in the presence of boundaries would be applicable in the theory of casimir force between metal surfaces , where the boundary effects are of prime importance .",
    "it has also been known @xcite that with inclusion of spatial dispersion the free energy of a fluctuating field @xmath104 takes a more general form than is given by the lifshitz formula , i.e. , @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the lifshitz contribution presented in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) , and the general expression for @xmath107 in terms of the thermal green s functions of the electromagnetic field can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite . the use of the lifshitz free energy @xmath108 for systems with spatial dispersion ( as was done , e.g. , in ref .",
    "@xcite where @xmath97 of the hydrodynamic model were substituted into @xmath19 ) is not correct @xcite . as was emphasized in ref .",
    "@xcite , `` for most of condensed matter bodies this is inadmissible '' .",
    "it seems , however , that refs .",
    "@xcite repeat this misuse of the lifshitz formula . at the same time",
    ", it is amply evident that at @xmath84k in the region of infrared optics ( i.e. , at the experimental separations ) or in the region of the normal skin effect ( @xmath109 m ) spatial dispersion does not play any role and can be neglected .",
    "from the above the following conclusions can be formulated :     the thermal casimir force between real metals presents serious problems , and there is presently no fundamental theory which describes it ;     the drude model approach to the thermal casimir force violates the nernst heat theorem in the case of metallic perfect crystal lattices with no impurities and is excluded by experiment ;     the thermal effect in the casimir force has not yet been measured . the traditional approaches to its description based on the plasma model and on the leontovich impedance are consistent with experiment .",
    "computations using the lifshitz formula at @xmath96 and tabulated optical data are also consistent with experiment ;     the measurement of the small thermal effect , as predicted by the traditional approaches , would be of great interest and could help to discriminate between them . in this regard the proposed experiments @xcite are very promising ;     the desired fundamental theory of the thermal casimir force between real materials should be presumably based on a more sophisticated quantization procedure incorporating spatial dispersion and inhomogeneity of space , and may go beyond the scope of the lifshitz theory .",

    "<S> it is well known that , beginning in 2000 , the behavior of the thermal correction to the casimir force between real metals has been hotly debated . as was shown by several research groups , the lifshitz theory , which provides the theoretical foundation for the calculation of both the van der waals and casimir forces , leads to different results depending on the model of metal conductivity used . to resolve these controversies , </S>",
    "<S> the theoretical considerations based on the principles of thermodynamics and new experimental tests were invoked . </S>",
