    "the azimuthal distribution of the produced particles in heavy - ion collisions is expected to be sensitive to the initial geometric overlap of the colliding nuclei , and would result in anisotropic azimuthal distributions with respect to the reaction plane . the standard method to quantify",
    "the azimuthal anisotropy is to expand the particle azimuthal distributions in a fourier series @xmath18 $ ] , where @xmath19 is the azimuthal angle of the produced particle with certain value of p@xmath3 , @xmath20 is the azimuthal angle of the reaction plane , and @xmath21 is the coefficient of the @xmath22 harmonic . the @xmath23 fourier moment ( @xmath24 )",
    "is referred to as the  elliptic flow \" parameter @xmath7 and its differential form is given by @xmath25 where the brackets denote statistical averaging over different events .    while rhic data show large amount of elliptic flow as predicted by the hydrodynamic models at low p@xmath3 , the results at high p@xmath3 deviate strongly from the hydrodynamic predictions as is expected  @xcite .",
    "the medium - induced radiative energy loss of partons ( jet - quenching ) has been proposed as the source for the large observed azimuthal anisotropy at high p@xmath3 , due to the path - length dependence of the parton energy loss  @xcite .",
    "the star results  @xcite show the amount of @xmath7 at high p@xmath3 is larger than the predicted values by pure jet - quenching models .",
    "although recent measurements by phenix  @xcite show the produced @xmath1 s in - plane outnumber those produced out - of - plane which may be consistent with the path - length dependence of energy loss , the reaction plane determination might have remaining bias toward the direction of the produced jets .",
    "star results show insensitivity of the path - length - dependence of energy loss  @xcite at high p@xmath3 through a comparison between @xmath2-charged particles and @xmath1-charged particles azimuthal correlations .    the @xmath7 measurement of direct photons would help to assess any remaining bias in the reaction plane determination leading to a positive @xmath7 signal .",
    "furthermore the @xmath8 would give additional information to help disentangle the various scenarios of direct photon production through the expected opposite contributions to the @xmath7  @xcite , and therefore could help to confirm the observed binary scaling of the direct photon@xmath26 .",
    "the star detector is well suited for measuring azimuthal angular correlations due to the large coverage in pseudorapidity ( @xmath27 ) and full coverage in azimuth ( @xmath28 ) . while the barrel electromagnetic calorimeter ( bemc )  @xcite measures the electromagnetic energy with high resolution , the barrel shower maximum detector ( bsmd ) provides fine spatial resolution and enhances the rejection power for the hadrons . the time projection chamber ( tpc )",
    "@xcite identifies charged - particles , measures its momenta , and allows for a charged - particle veto cut with the bemc matching . using the bemc to select events ( _ i.e. _  trigger \" ) with high-@xmath29 @xmath30 , the star experiment collected an integrated luminosity of 535  @xmath31b@xmath32 of au+au collisions in 2007 . in this analysis ,",
    "events having primary vertex within @xmath33 cm of the center of tpc along the beamline , and with at least one electromagnetic cluster with @xmath34  gev are selected .",
    "more than 97@xmath12 of these clusters have deposited energy greater than 0.5 gev in each layer of the bsmd .",
    "a trigger tower is rejected if it has a track with @xmath35  gev/@xmath11 pointing to it , which reduces the number of the electromagnetic clusters by only @xmath36% .",
    "the @xmath7 is determined using the standard method ( eq .",
    "1 ) , which correlates each particle with the event plane determined from the full event minus the particle of interest .",
    "the event plane is determined by @xmath37 where @xmath38 are the azimuthal angles of all the particles used to define the event plane . in this analysis ,",
    "the charged - track quality criteria are similar to those used in previous star analyses  @xcite .",
    "the event plane is measured twice : 1 ) using all the selected tracks inside the tpc ( full - tpc ) , and 2 ) using the selected tracks in the opposite pseudorapidity side to the particle of interest ( off-@xmath39 ) in order to reduce the ",
    "non - flow \" contributions ( azimuthal correlations not related to the reaction plane ) .",
    "since the event plane is only an approximation to the true reaction plane , the observed correlation is divided by the event plane resolution .",
    "the event plane resolution is estimated using the sub - event method in which the full event is divided up randomly into two sub - events ( for full - tpc and off-@xmath39 separately ) as described in  @xcite .",
    "biases due to the finite acceptance of the detector , which cause the particles to be azimuthally anisotropic in the laboratory system are removed according to the method in  @xcite .",
    "figure 1 ( left panel ) shows the @xmath7 of charged particles ( @xmath40 ) at low p@xmath3 using the event plane method ( off-@xmath39 ) compared to previous star measurements  @xcite , and the @xmath7 of the charged and neutral particles using the full - tpc and off-@xmath39 event plane methods at high p@xmath3 . at low p@xmath3 the @xmath40(off-@xmath39 ) is smaller than the @xmath7 using the full tpc and agrees well with the @xmath7@xmath41 ( 4-particle cumulant ) method , in which the contribution of the non - flow is expected to be small . at high",
    "p@xmath3 the two different methods ( full tpc and off-@xmath39 ) for the reaction plane measurements give similar results ( both for the charged and neutral particles separately ) , which might indicate the dominance of non - flow contributions in @xmath7 measurements .",
    "the @xmath42 of the neutral particles show systematically smaller values than those of charged particles due to the @xmath2 contributions .",
    "a crucial part of the analysis is to discriminate between showers from @xmath2 and two close @xmath30 s from high-@xmath29 @xmath1 symmetric decays . at @xmath43  gev/@xmath11 , the angular separation between the two @xmath30 s resulting from a @xmath1 decay is small , but a @xmath1 shower is generally broader than a single @xmath30 shower .",
    "the bsmd is capable of @xmath44)/@xmath45 separation up to @xmath46  gev/@xmath11 due to its high granularity .",
    "the shower shape is quantified as the cluster energy , measured by the bemc , normalized by the position - weighted energy moment , measured by the bsmd strips  @xcite .",
    "the shower profile cuts were tuned to obtain a nearly @xmath2-free ( @xmath47 ) sample and a sample rich in @xmath2 ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "since the shower - shape analysis is only effective for rejecting two close @xmath30 showers , the @xmath6 sample contains a mixture of direct photons and contamination from fragmentation photons ( @xmath48 ) and photons from asymmetric hadron ( @xmath5 and @xmath39 ) decays .",
    "figure 1 ( right panel ) shows the @xmath7 of @xmath6 sample and @xmath7 of the sample free of direct photons ( @xmath1 ) using the off-@xmath39 event plane method . as expected , the @xmath7 of @xmath6 sample is smaller than that of @xmath1 , while the @xmath17 is similar to @xmath40 which indicates the @xmath1 sample identified by the transverse shower - shape analysis , to be free of @xmath2 .",
    "the @xmath49 is given by : @xmath50 where @xmath51=@xmath52 , and the numbers of @xmath1 and @xmath6 triggers are represented by @xmath53 and @xmath54 respectively .",
    "the value of @xmath51 is measured in  @xcite and found to be @xmath55 in central au+au . in eq .",
    "3 all background sources for @xmath2 are assumed to have the same @xmath7 as @xmath1 .",
    "thus , excepting those @xmath48 that have no near - side yield , all other sources of @xmath2 s background are removed .",
    "figure 2 ( left and right panels ) shows the @xmath8 and @xmath17 compared to @xmath40 at high p@xmath3 using the two different event - plane methods . while the @xmath17 and @xmath40 are similar ( @xmath15 12@xmath12 ) , the @xmath8 is systematically lower than that of hadrons .",
    "the similarity of the @xmath7 results using the full - tpc and off-@xmath39 at high p@xmath3 , along with the non - zero value of @xmath8 , indicate the non - flow contributions to the measured @xmath7 .",
    "the star experiment has reported the first @xmath8 at high - p@xmath3 at rhic .",
    "the non - zero value of @xmath8 is probably due to contributions from non - flow to the standard method of @xmath7 measurements , where the pseudorapidity gap between the particle of interest and the particles used for the reaction plane determination is smaller than two units in pseudorapidity .",
    "the positive value of @xmath8 demonstrates the negligible contribution of jet - medium photons  @xcite and possible contributions of @xmath56  @xcite to the direct photon productions over the covered kinematics range .",
