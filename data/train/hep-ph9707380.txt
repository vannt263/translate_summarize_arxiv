    "some of the major puzzles of particle physics and cosmology concern parameters which are much smaller than their expected  natural \" size [ 1 ] . for example",
    ", the yukawa coupling constant of the electron , @xmath8 , is about @xmath9 .",
    "the qcd  vacuum angle \" , @xmath10 , is experimentally bounded to be less than about @xmath11 .",
    "perhaps the mother of all such small - number puzzles is the cosmological constant problem [ 2 ] .",
    "the cosmological constant , @xmath12 , in natural gravitational units ( _ i.e. _ in units of @xmath13 , where @xmath14 gev is the  planck mass \" ) is known to be less than about @xmath15 .",
    "all of these dimensionless ratios would naturally be expected to be of order unity in the absence of some dynamical mechanism or symmetry principle that determined them to be small .",
    "for some of these small numbers fairly simple conventional particle physics explanations are available .",
    "in particular , viable models exist for explaining the smallness of @xmath10 and @xmath8 .",
    "other small numbers are harder to explain conventionally .",
    "for example , although one can find ways ( involving supersymmetry ) to explain why the cosmological constant is as small as ( 1 tev)@xmath16 ( or @xmath17 in natural units ) , that is still @xmath18 orders of magnitude larger than the observational bound .    in recent work , weinberg has addressed the question of whether the anthropic principle can explain the smallness of the cosmological constant [ 3 ] .",
    "roughly stated , the anthropic principle [ 4 ] says that the parameters of the universe that we observe are governed by the requirement that they must be able to support intelligent life , as otherwise we would not exist to observe our universe . if there is only one single",
    " universe \" , with the same laws and parameters everywhere , this is far from a satisfactory physical explanation .",
    "however , it has been realized that some physical theories can support the existence of separated domains in the universe in which different parameters and even different gauge groups are applicable .",
    "for example , in chaotic inflation [ 5 ] different domains have different higgs vacuum expectation values , selecting different effective particle physics theories .",
    "such domains could be regarded as , effectively , different universes .",
    "this idea that multiple ",
    "universes \" can exist takes the copernican revolution to the ultimate limit  even our universe may not be unique . in a multiple universe theory ,",
    "the anthropic requirement that we live in a universe with viable parameters is as natural as is the good fortune that we happen to live on a planet that has a temperature ideal for life .",
    "discussions of the anthropic principle often end up dangerously close to being non - scientific .",
    "however , weinberg shows how calculations can be done based on mild forms of the the anthropic principle  or perhaps more accurately the multiple universe hypothesis  which allow one to assess whether they are able to explain the smallness of a parameter such as the cosmological constant [ 3 ] weinberg examines the requirement that the evolution of the universe be such that matter clumps into galaxies , and shows that this only occurs for a range of values of the cosmological constant .",
    "he then calculates the mean value of viable @xmath12 s .",
    "if the actual value of @xmath12 in our universe turns out to be very much smaller than this mean value , one would conclude that this form of the anthropic principle does _ not _ provide sufficient explanation for the magnitude of @xmath12 .",
    "unfortunately , the results are not yet conclusive , as neither the mean viable value nor the experimental value of @xmath12 is yet well determined .    the greater part of this paper will be devoted to applying anthropic arguments to a single parameter of the standard model of particle physics , namely @xmath0 , the mass parameter of the higgs potential . like the cosmological constant ,",
    "this parameter is many orders of magnitude smaller than its  natural scale \" and has so far no completely satisfactory conventional particle physics explanation .",
    "its smallness ( about @xmath19 in planck units ) is considered one of the major puzzles in particle physics , and is often called the `` fine tuning problem '' or ( in the context of grand unified theories ) the  gauge hierarchy problem \" [ 6 ] .",
    "we will assume that the standard model is the correct theory of particle interactions in the limit that effects from the planck scale or the unification scale are neglected .",
    "in the next several sections of the paper we will see what the consequences are of varying a single parameter , @xmath0 , of that model [ 7 ] .",
    "in particular we will ask whether for different ranges of @xmath0 complex elements , which are presumably required for the emergence of life , can ( 1 ) exist , and ( 2 ) be actually formed in significant quantities in the evolution of the universe .",
    "it is important that we do not attempt to modify the standard model by adding new physics at low energies .",
    "first , to do so would make the space of possibilities too large to make meaningful anthropic arguments . and , second",
    ", the need for new low - energy physics would be unclear if the magnitude of @xmath0 could be explained without it .    the reasons for focusing particularly on @xmath0",
    "will be explained more fully below , but it is also interesting to look at certain other parameters of the standard model from an anthropic perspective , and this we do in section 6 , where we examine the ratios of the quark masses .",
    "of all the parameters of the standard model , @xmath0 stands out in a number of ways .",
    "first , it is the only one which is dimensionful , and because of that it sets the scale for the masses of all the known elementary particles [ 8 ] .",
    "all the elementary particles of the standard model which have mass  quarks , leptons , @xmath20 , and @xmath21  derive these masses from coupling to the expectation value of the higgs .",
    "this expectation value , which is denoted @xmath22 , is determined by the minimization of the effective potential of the higgs field , @xmath23 . since @xmath24 one has that @xmath25 .",
    "the observed value of @xmath2 is @xmath26 gev .",
    "we will call this value @xmath27 , and henceforth the subscript ` 0 ' will denote the value a parameter takes in our universe .",
    "the masses of the weak - interaction gauge bosons , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are given by @xmath2 times the gauge coupling constants , which are of order @xmath28 .",
    "the masses of the quarks and leptons are given by @xmath2 times yukawa couplings which range from about @xmath29 for the electron to about @xmath30 for the top quark .",
    "the mass of the higgs particle is @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is as yet unknown , but is roughly of order unity [ 9 ] .",
    "the second way in which @xmath0 stands out among the parameters of the standard model is its extreme smallness . as noted above",
    ", it is of order @xmath33 , or about @xmath19 in natural planckian units .",
    "this is to be compared to the next smallest parameters , the electron yukawa coupling , @xmath34 , and the qcd vacuum angle , @xmath35 . in the simplest grand unified models @xmath0 receives contributions of order @xmath36 gev@xmath37 from each of several terms , which must therefore cancel to fantastic accuracy . in such  fine - tuned \" models ,",
    "a very small change in the other parameters would disturb this cancellation and cause @xmath0 to vary over an enormous range .",
    "( this may be another justification for our approach here of only considering variations of @xmath0 and keeping the other parameters essentially fixed . )",
    "finally , @xmath0 stands in contrast to the other parameters of the standard model in that fairly plausible explanations in terms of symmetry principles or other conventional particle physics considerations are available to account for their magnitudes .",
    "for example , it is generally regarded as likely that the relative values of the gauge couplings are the result of unification of the gauge groups at or below the planck scale [ 10 ] .",
    "likewise , there are many ideas for explaining the ratios of quark and lepton masses in terms of grand unification , family symmetries , horizontal interactions , radiative hierarchies , or a combination of these [ 11 ] .",
    "the smallness of the qcd vacuum angle can be explained by the axion mechanism [ 12 ] or by approximate cp invariance [ 13 ] . by comparison ,",
    "the smallness of @xmath0 is very hard to account for in conventional ways .",
    "there have been two main approaches to doing this ,  technicolor \" [ 14 ] and supersymmetry [ 15 ] .",
    "the technicolor approach is fraught with difficulties and has fallen into disfavor .",
    "the supersymmetry approach is more promising , but a completely satisfactory and simple explanation of the smallness of @xmath0 does not yet exist .",
    "it will be assumed , then , that @xmath0 can be of either sign and can vary between @xmath38 and @xmath39 . to understand the behavior of @xmath2 as @xmath0",
    "is varied over this range , one must look at the potential for @xmath40 including the effect of its coupling to the quark - antiquark condensates ( which can ordinarily be neglected ) .",
    "@xmath41    the @xmath42 condensates for light quarks have a value of order @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the strong - interaction chiral - symmetry - breaking scale [ 8 ] .",
    "( @xmath45 mev . ) for @xmath0 negative and much larger in absolute value than @xmath46 , as in our universe , one can ignore the last term in eq.(1 ) and obtain @xmath47 .",
    "as @xmath0 becomes smaller in absolute value than @xmath46 , and of either sign , one can neglect the @xmath0 term and obtain @xmath48 .",
    "finally , when @xmath0 is positive and larger than @xmath46 one can neglect the quartic term and obtain @xmath49 .",
    "note that in the @xmath50 world , the longitudinal components of the weak interaction gauge bosons come from the  pions \" not from the higgs field , and @xmath51 .",
    "in universes with @xmath24 and greater in absolute value than in our universe , one has @xmath52 .",
    "one is dealing , then , with  large @xmath2 \" universes .",
    "we will examine the possibilities for life in this case , our basic assumption being that for life to exist ",
    "complex chemistry \" must be possible . in our universe , protons and neutrons combine to form a variety of nuclei .",
    "these are dressed with electrons to form atoms which may be bound into a variety of simple and complex molecules .",
    "it seems plausible , therefore , that in order for life to develop it is necessary that a variety of nuclei be ( a ) stable , and ( b ) formed in either primordial or stellar nucleosynthesis .",
    "one of the things that can go wrong when @xmath2 becomes larger than @xmath27 is that nuclei , or even the protons and neutrons , can become unstable .",
    "for example , in our universe neutrons can be stable within nuclei ; but , for sufficiently large @xmath2 , as we shall see , the reaction energy for neutron decay , @xmath53 , becomes larger than the binding energy per nucleon in nuclei of about @xmath54 mev .",
    "at that point neutrons even in nuclei will decay and the only stable nuclei will be protons .",
    "we argue that such a ",
    "proton universe \" would be sterile .    to analyze the stability of nucleons and nuclei in large @xmath2 universes",
    ", we must understand how masses and binding energies depend on @xmath2 .",
    "we turn first to this question .",
    "the quark and lepton masses simply scale with @xmath2 ( ignoring the relatively small effect of the logarithmic running of the yukawa couplings ) .",
    "thus , we take @xmath55 mev , @xmath56 mev , and @xmath57 mev .",
    "we model baryon masses by @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the sum of the quark masses in the baryon , @xmath60 is the color energy , and @xmath61 is the electromagnetic energy . since for the neutron and proton the color energy is the same , the neutron - proton mass splitting is given by @xmath62 .",
    "as long as the quark masses are small compared to the qcd scale ( which will be true for @xmath63 less than a few hundred ) the size of nucleons , and therefore the electromagnetic energy , will be relatively insensitive to @xmath2 .",
    "[ the size of a nucleon will scale as @xmath64 .",
    "for the dependence of this on @xmath2 see below . ]",
    "thus we can take @xmath65 to have the same value which it has in our universe , namely about @xmath66 mev .",
    "thus we have that @xmath67 mev , and the @xmath68 value for neutron beta decay , @xmath69 is @xmath70 mev .    for @xmath71",
    "most of the mass of the @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 baryons is due to color energy .",
    "the splitting between the @xmath75 baryons ( @xmath73 and @xmath72 ) and the @xmath76 baryons ( @xmath74 ) is in our universe about @xmath77 mev .",
    "( since the lightest baryons will be made purely of @xmath78 and @xmath79 quarks , we need be concerned only with isospin and not with flavor @xmath80 . )",
    "we will assume that both @xmath81 and @xmath82 are proportional to the qcd scale , @xmath83 .",
    "@xmath83 depends only indirectly and fairly weakly upon @xmath2 .",
    "( this dependence arises because the renormalization group running of the strong coupling ",

    "we find that @xmath85 , where @xmath86 for @xmath87 .",
    "thus we take @xmath88 mev .    of course",
    ", for very large @xmath2 ( larger than a few hundred @xmath27 ) the quark masses will become larger than the color energy , and the proton , neutron , and @xmath74 will become non - relativistic bound states in which the color energy will go as @xmath89 and thus be proportional to @xmath2 .    the dependence of the nuclear force on @xmath2 is a much more complicated matter .",
    "the long - range part of the nucleon - nucleon potential is due primarily to one - pion exchange , and therefore has a range of @xmath90 .",
    "as long as the @xmath78 and @xmath79 masses are small compared to the qcd scale , the mass of the pion is well approximated by @xmath91 .",

    ". we will take @xmath94 to go as @xmath95 , which is adequate for our discussions .",
    "the shorter - range part of the nucleon - nucleon potential comes from multi - pion exchange , the exchange of heavier states , and more complicated effects .",
    "it is difficult to estimate how these will depend on @xmath2 .",
    "however , our qualitative conclusions do not depend upon this issue .    with these general considerations we map out the nature of baryons and nuclei in universes where @xmath52 .",

    "a variety of nuclei will continue to exist , with fewer and fewer stable isotopes surviving as @xmath63 increases .",

    "relevant to this question is the fact that one of the first nuclei to become unstable as @xmath63 increases above 1 will be the deuteron , which even in our universe is very weakly bound .",

    "we varied @xmath108 proportionally to @xmath95 ( we neglect the scaling of @xmath83 ) , but it is not clear how the other meson parameters should vary . the problem is not well defined , as several of the `` mesons '' do not correspond to physical particles but are mockups of the short range exchange of two or more pions in channels with the same quantum numbers .",
    "the masses for these mesons reflect the momentum distribution of the multiple pions as much as the mass of the pion itself .",
    "further , the mass and coupling parameters are arrived at only after fitting , thus to change their relative values in an ad - hoc way can destroy some sensitive cancellation , and is of questionable value .",
    "faced with this problem we chose to vary the pion mass , but kept all other parameters of the obep unchanged .",

    "( 2 ) if , on the other hand , primordially only electron number were produced , and it were negative , then the baryons would end up being clothed exclusively with @xmath184 s  as long as @xmath185 . in any baryonic atom ,",
    "a @xmath172 could replace a @xmath171 , with a gain in binding energy .",
    "the remaining @xmath172s and @xmath171s would bind , albeit more weakly , with electrons .",
    "if the chemistry relevant for life is dominated by lepton @xmath186 , then one simply multiplies the formula for @xmath159 by @xmath187 .",
    "this result is to be compared with the baryon lifetime .",

    "( i ) the decay of baryons .",
    "*    the unification of gauge couplings suggests grand unification at a scale of order @xmath189 gev , and therefore the existence of gauge bosons of that mass whose exchange leads to violation of baryon number . but even if there is no unification at that scale , it is plausible to suppose that at least at the planck scale there will be states whose exchange violates baryon number .",
    "thus we will parametrize the baryon decay rate as @xmath190 , where @xmath191 is assumed to lie between @xmath189gev and @xmath192gev .    as mentioned above , if baryons are not stable the radiation density may be dominated by the energy released in their decay .",
    "we equate the age of the universe , @xmath193 , to the baryon lifetime . at this time",
    "the radiation density is given by the relation @xmath194 , where @xmath195 is a numerical factor that we take to be about @xmath196 [ 17 ] .",
    "this gives @xmath197 .",
    "requiring that this be less than @xmath198 , and using the parametrization of @xmath199 , yields the constraint    @xmath200    thus if @xmath201gev , the constraint that baryons still exist when the universe is cooled down to @xmath157 tells us that @xmath0 must be at least @xmath202 orders of magnitude smaller than the natural scale of @xmath203 .",

    "there are a number of considerations that may actually strengthen the bound on @xmath0 . in the first place ,",
    "we have neglected the possibility that baryons might decay predominantly into channels that are blocked in our universe by the heaviness of the higher generation quarks and leptons .",
    "for example , in some supersymmetric theories the exchange of superheavy colored higgsinos would produce very fast proton decay ( in our universe ) if it were not for the fact that the final states include flavors heavier than the proton .",
    "even more interesting is the possibility that baryons could decay _ via _ sphalerons [ 18 ] . since in @xmath3 universes the weak interactions are broken not at @xmath27 but at @xmath44 , non - perturbative weak baryon decay would not be as strongly suppressed as in our universe .",
    "finally , there is the question of baryogenesis .",
    "if it occurs through standard  drift and decay \" mechanisms [ 19 ] involving grand unified interactions , then one would expect the asymmetry to be essentially independent of @xmath0 .",
    "but if baryogenesis takes place at the weak scale in our universe [ 20 ] , it is probable that in the @xmath207 universes the asymmetry would be very different .    *",
    "( ii ) the structure of the elements *    with the higgs system not generating a vacuum expectation value , the breaking of the standard model occurs through the goldstone bosons of the strong interactions .",
    "the @xmath208 mass is of order 50 mev .",
    "however , the quark masses are very small since they are sensitive only to the higgs vacuum expectation value . with six essentially massless quarks ,",
    "the lightest baryon multiplet will be a 70-plet , with 27 members which are neutral , 27 which have charge + 1 and eight each with charge -1 and charge + 2 .",
    "the lightest meson multiplet starts out with 35 members , but three are  eaten \" to become the longitudinal gauge bosons , leaving 32 pseudoscalar mesons , which are the goldstone bosons of the dynamically broken chiral su(6 ) symmetry .",
    "electroweak interactions will split the multiplets and our estimates for these effects are based on the understanding of electromagnetic mass splittings of the observed hadrons . for the goldstone bosons the mass splittings can be understood using effective lagrangians with chiral symmetry , which in the world under consideration would involve a @xmath209 chiral invariance .",
    "the purely lefthanded interactions of the charged @xmath208 s will not produce masses for the goldstone bosons , since such interactions lead to an effective chiral lagrangian which involves derivatives [ 21 ] , and hence vanishes at @xmath210 .",
    "however vectorial interactions do generate masses , in analogy to the electromagnetic mass shifts of pions and kaons .",
    "the electromagnetic and @xmath21 interactions will have such vectorial effects , and display an @xmath211 invariance for separate rotations of up - type and down - type quarks . by a generalization of dashen s theorem",
    "[ 22 ] , these interactions will leave the 16 neutral goldstone bosons massless , while giving a common mass to all 16 charged mesons . using the observed pion mass",
    "splitting we can estimate that the charged mesons will have a mass of about @xmath212 mev .",
    "the neutral mesons will develop very small masses due to chiral symmetry breaking , @xmath213 .",
    "even for @xmath171 as small as 100 gev , some meson masses will be less than a kev .",
    "the tiny mass of the neutral mesons implies that nucleons will have a long - ranged neutral mesonic cloud , and that the nuclear force will have a correspondingly long - range potential .    the baryon mass splittings are less amenable to an analysis based only on symmetry , and we must include quark model ideas about the effects of electroweak interactions .",
    "the short - distance electroweak effects preserve the quark chirality , which implies that they will not generate quark mass shifts .",
    "the longest range effects of the vectorial interactions will be proportional to the square of the baryon s electric or weak charges . describing these by the electric charge q and the strong isospin t , and ignoring the masses of the @xmath214",
    ", we would expect that the lightest baryons should be the 19 @xmath215 states , a group which contains the neutron .",
    "with splittings of order an mev , the 19 @xmath216 charged baryons ( containing the proton and related states ) could likely be the next grouping .",
    "hyperfine interactions and quark masses could further split the states within these groups .",
    "all of the baryon and meson states which are shifted up in mass are unstable and can decay down to the ground states via weak or electromagnetic interactions , although perhaps with very long lifetimes",
    ".    given these building blocks we outline the nature of nuclei . in our world , consisting of just protons and neutrons , any substantial nucleus has comparable numbers of neutrons and protons , as dictated by a desire to minimize the fermi energy .",
    "there is a tendency to have fewer protons so as to simultaneously lower the coulomb energy . in the @xmath3 worlds , there are many species of neutral and charged nucleons , so the effects of degeneracy energy will only come into play for larger nuclei .",
    "at the same time , for modest size nuclei ( @xmath217 of a few fermi ) the weak bosons are effectively long range , @xmath218 , so the one must take into account weak - interaction energy as well as electromagnetic coulomb energy .",
    "a nucleus consisting of @xmath219 baryons of type @xmath220 and @xmath221 of type @xmath222 will have strong isospin @xmath223 and weak hypercharge @xmath224 .",
    "( since right - handed quarks have vanishing weak isospin , the effective weak isospin of a nucleon is half of its strong isospin , and @xmath225 . )",
    "the coulomb energy will have contributions proportional to @xmath226 . for large @xmath227 we can approximate @xmath228 by @xmath229 .",
    "clearly , this is minimized by making @xmath227 as small as possible , namely @xmath230 .",
    "this allows us to express the coulomb energy in terms of @xmath219 and @xmath221 , and minimizing with respect to @xmath221 subject to the constraint that @xmath231 , one finds easily that @xmath232 this relation holds for intermediate @xmath124 ; for large @xmath124 the range of the weak gauge bosons will saturate and eventually we must include degeneracy effects ( filling fermi levels ) as well as other nucleon states , while for small @xmath124 we must include the nucleon mass differences .",
    "coulomb energy may cause nuclei larger than some critical size to be unstable to spontaneous fission , as in our universe .",
    "however , above the value of @xmath124 for which the weak force saturates ( which we estimate to be on the order of a few hundred ) the ratio @xmath233 is determined predominantly by minimizing electric coulomb energy rather than weak - interaction coulomb energy . this would lead ( in these @xmath50 universes ) to large nuclei having @xmath234 .",
    "the smallness of @xmath233 may well mean that there is no maximum size set to nuclei by spontaneous fission .",
    "the situation is complicated by the longer range of the strong nuclear force and the effects of degeneracy energy with many degrees of freedom .",
    "therefore , we can not say with certainty whether or not there is a maximum nuclear size in the @xmath50 worlds .",
    "similarly , the spectrum of nuclei that result from primordial nucleosynthesis is not certain .",
    "early stages of nucleosynthesis will occur with neutral baryons combining to form light nuclei , but as nuclei grow in size and charge , it is not clear to us whether or not coulomb barriers will result in a termination of nucleosynthesis at small or modest nuclei , or whether nuclear burning will  run away \" to give only very massive nuclei .",
    "the difficulty lies in estimating how screening and thermal contributions to meson masses will affect the long - range nuclear potential in its competition with the coulomb barrier between light nuclei .    with the uncertainty in these issues",
    ", it seems possible that light nuclei with small charge may exist and provide a basis for chemical life .",
    "it is also possible that nucleosythesis will result in a small number of low - charge , superheavy nuclei , which does not seem conducive to the development of chemical life .    *",
    "( iii ) stars burning out . *",
    "even if an interesting mix of elements develops during nucleosynthesis , the time @xmath159 is so large that it is natural to wonder if there would be any stars left by the time biochemistry could take place in the small-@xmath2 universe . on the other hand , with extremely small lepton masses , stellar cooling",
    "may be so obstructed that stars never contract to the nuclear burning phase at all .",
    "we give an overview of these issues .",
    "stars are supported by either gas pressure , radiation pressure , or degeneracy pressure .",
    "if the support is either gas , radiation , or degeneracy of a relativistic species then as the star cools ( loses energy ) it contracts and heats up ( @xmath235 increases ) .",
    "if supported by degeneracy of non - relativistic fermions , then it cools but does not contract . a system of the first kind contracts until it becomes hot enough for nuclear burning to proceed against the coulomb barriers of the nuclei .",
    "once the fuel is gone contraction continues until either another fuel burning stage is reached , the object is supported by non - relativistic degeneracy pressure ( white dwarf or neutron star ) , or the object contracts within its schwarzschild radius and disappears as a black hole .",
    "systems supported by degeneracy pressure before nuclear burning cool into planets .    whether a cloud of gas turns into a star or a planet depends on its initial mass and ( to a lesser extent ) composition .",
    "initially the cloud is non - degenerate and is supported by gas pressure . as it contracts degeneracy pressure increases as @xmath236 while gas or radiation pressure increase as @xmath237 .",
    "when the star reaches a size @xmath238 degeneracy pressure will halt further contraction . from dimensional analysis ,",
    "@xmath239 where @xmath240 , @xmath219 is the number of baryons in the star , and @xmath241 is the mass of the degenerate fermion [ 23 ] .",
    "the temperature at this point is @xmath242 and the fermi momentum of the degenerate fermions is @xmath243 if @xmath244 is greater than the temperature necessary for nuclear burning , @xmath245 1 kev [ 24 ] , then a star is born before degeneracy occurs . in our world , @xmath246 and , after including numerical factors , @xmath247 for @xmath248 .",
    "low mass stars develop , burn , and then turn into white dwarfs . in the @xmath3 world , the lepton may be @xmath249 , @xmath171 , or @xmath172 , but in any case @xmath250 ev .",
    "@xmath244 will therefore be too cool to support nuclear burning .",
    "protostars with @xmath251 turn into planets .",
    "if @xmath252 the leptons become relativistic before they become degenerate , and the collapse can not be halted until nuclear fusion takes place . after a burning phase contraction continues until either another nuclear burning phase occurs or the core contracts inside its schwarzschild radius and a black hole results .",
    "if @xmath253 is not too much greater than 1 , a neutron star may form .",
    "since @xmath252 for nuclear fusion , stellar burning will take place in a plasma of relativistic leptons and anti - leptons .",
    "this plasma is not degenerate : the degeneracy parameter is @xmath254 . as the leptons are relativistic opacities for photons will be large , dominated by the photon - lepton cross - section @xmath255 . on the other hand neutrino interactions are also much larger ,",
    "so neutrinos dominate stellar cooling in the nuclear burning phase .    at temperatures less than @xmath256 cross - sections for neutrino pair production , scattering from leptons or baryons , absorption , etc ,",
    "will be of order @xmath257 . for stars of @xmath258",
    "the density of baryons and thermal leptons will be comparable , but for larger stars thermal particles will dominate , so we may estimate mean free paths and emissivities from thermal pair processes .",
    "mean free paths for weak interactions are @xmath259 cm ; ie , solar type stars are likely to cool by volume emission or have a very deep neutrino sphere .",
    "the energy loss rate per lepton from pair annihilation to neutrinos is @xmath260 gev s@xmath261 ; ie , solar mass stars cool on time scales of roughly a year , and larger stars in much less time .",
    "this is very much less than @xmath159 .",
    "the next issue is star formation .",
    "of particular concern are the cooling rates during collapse , when temperatures are too low for efficient neutrino emmission , and cooling is regulated by the photon opacity either in the interior or at the surface .",
    "opacities are determined by the chemistry of the lightest charged lepton . for us",
    "this is the electron mass , although in some scenarios the active species will in fact be positrons bound in either @xmath171 or @xmath172-onium .    there are two stages in the collapse of a cloud to the point of nuclear ignition . at first ,",
    "temperature gradients are not large and convection provides the energy transport .",
    "the photosphere is essentially held at a fixed temperature @xmath262 at which material is no longer ionized and the opacity drops .",
    "the luminosity is @xmath263 .",
    "cooling is initially very fast but slows as the star shrinks .",
    "eventually , temperature gradients increase to where radiative transport is effective and convection is cut off . at that point the cooling time scale is the kelvin - helmholtz time for photon diffusion to the surface . @xmath264 where @xmath32 is the mean free path and @xmath265 is the cross - section for photon - lepton scattering . to derive the last relation :",
    "note that if @xmath266 then @xmath267 but for higher temperatures @xmath268 , and that @xmath269 is roughly constant during collapse .",
    "the cooling time is dominated by the epoch when @xmath270 , or @xmath271 yr . this is less than @xmath159 ( see eq . ( 5 ) ) , but not by so much that the energy from stellar burning may not be available for life to form .",
    "thus , within this crude treatment of stellar evolution , stars are expected to form slowly , but burn nuclear fuel very quickly .",
    "the actual stage of nuclear burning seems too short to benefit life , but there are other possible energy sources than surface heating of planets by stars .",
    "for example , planets may be volume heated by radioactivity , residual gravitational energy , baryon decay , or even absorption of the background of neutrinos produced by stellar burning .",
    "the energy flow to the surface would in principle be usable for the evolution of life .",
    "we have been discussing theories in which the higgs mass parameter @xmath0 can vary in different regions of the universe , under the assumption that the yukawa couplings do not change from the values that they have in our portion of the universe .",
    "it is possible that the underlying theory also allows the values of the yukawa couplings to vary in different regions of the universe . in this section ,",
    "we discuss some of the possible implications of this situation .",
    "however , we stress that without knowing the details of the fundamental theory we do not know whether these masses are in fact subject to variation or whether they occur in fixed ratios due to some other mechanism . for example , we can see no anthropic argument which would force neutrinos to be as light as they seem to be ( if indeed they have a mass )",
    ". however , a ",
    "see - saw \" mechanism [ 9 ] would make them very light automatically , and we would not need consider anthropic reasoning .",
    "the masses of the quarks and leptons of the second and third generations have very little impact on the particles and reactions which occur naturally in our universe .",
    "therefore anthropic arguments would not place constraints on their masses . in an ensemble of anthropically allowed universes ,",
    "these masses could be randomly distributed . in practice ,",
    "the observed masses appear to be distributed without any obvious pattern , and randomness appears as good an  explanation \" as anything else .",
    "the masses of the light quarks are constrained by the physics which has been discussed above .",
    "in particular , the requirement that the deuteron exist yields an upper bound on the sum of the up and down quark masses ,    @xmath272    if the @xmath79 quark mass was lighter , or the both the masses were small , the proton would be heavier than the neutron , and could decay into it .",
    "hydrogen would then not exist as a stable atom ( at least for small values of the electron mass ) .",
    "however , the complex elements would still exist , and there would seem to be sufficient building blocks for some form of life .",
    "thus , we will use the above inequality as the sole anthropic constraint on the light quark masses .",
    "the anthropic constraints on the electron mass come from other sources .",
    "an electron mass larger that the binding energy of a nucleon , around 10 mev , would lead to the decay of atoms , through the process @xmath273 , with the final neutron ejected from the nucleus .",
    "however , stronger constraints can be obtained in nucleosynthesis .",
    "if the electron mass is higher than the temperature at the time of nucleosynthesis , the electrons will have all disappeared , converting via @xmath273 leaving only neutrons behind .",
    "likewise , the reactions which would burn neutrons , such as @xmath274 which would be the neutron equivalent of the start of the pp cycle , use weak interaction transitions and would be shut off if the electron mass is large .",
    "the precise constraint depends on the neutron and proton masses , but is generically in the range of a few mev .",
    "in a universe with domains which can have different values of some of the underlying parameters , life may only be able to develop in some of those domains .",
    "if this is the case , we would expect that the parameters of our domain should be typical of anthropically allowed range .",
    "if the anthropic principle accommodates such a large range that our values of the parameters are unnaturally small within this range , then the anthropic principle fails to help us understand the sizes of these parameters .",
    "however , we have found that within the overall structure of the standard model there is a relatively small acceptable range for the higgs parameter @xmath0 and the light quark masses .",
    "the physical values of these parameters are quite typical of this range , raising the possibility that the anthropic principle could be an  explanation \" of these magnitudes .",
    "the arguments behind this conclusion are summarized in fig .",
    "1 . for @xmath0",
    "negative , as in our universe , it seems that the whole range of values for the vacuum expectation value from @xmath275 down to about @xmath276 ( or perhaps even down to @xmath277 ) times the value in our universe can be excluded . for most of that range ( down to about @xmath278 ) the universe would consist of sterile , helium - like atoms whose nuclei were @xmath135 .",
    "there would be essentially no reactions either chemical or nuclear .",
    "for the lower part of the excluded range , there would be virtually no nuclei other than protons , and the @xmath279 and @xmath280 processes that are needed for nucleosynthesis would be endothermic as the deuteron would not be stable .    for positive values of @xmath0 the condition that baryons still exist at the time biochemistry becomes possible forces @xmath0 to be many orders of magnitude smaller than the  natural \" planck scale .",
    "our arguments for smaller values of @xmath0 are less certain",
    ". it may be that long range nuclear forces cause all baryons to clump into superheavy nuclei with small charge , which does nt appear to be promising for life .",
    "if these forces are screened in a mesonic plasma , then light nuclei will continue to exist , and can burn in stars , and stars may ignite at sufficiently late times to fuel life .",
    "individual stars , however , will be extremely short lived compared to the cosmological time scales . if life is to develop in such a universe , the energy source is not likely to be the photoluminescence of an individual star .",
    "one can thus plausibly argue that for life to exist the @xmath0 parameter has to be negative and has to be close to the value it has in our universe .",
    "one of the interesting features of this argument is that it explains  as no other approaches do at present  the curious fact that the weak scale is near to the qcd scale . in order for protons and neutrons ( rather than @xmath135 ) to be the lightest baryons",
    ", @xmath281 has to be less than the chromodynamic energy which splits the baryon decuplet from the octet .",
    "for the deuteron to have large enough binding energy to save neutrons from virtual extinction in the early universe and also to allow the @xmath279 reactions to be exothermic , the pion has to have a long compton wavelength compared to the nucleon , and this in turn means that the @xmath78 and @xmath79 masses have to be not only less than but small compared to the qcd energy scale by about the amount seen in nature .",
    "this provides a possible resolution to the `` fine - tuning problem ''  in an ensemble of different domains of the universe , the higgs mass parameter will occasionally fall into the anthropically allowed region without having to be fine - tuned in general . if the cosmological constant is confirmed to have a non - zero value close to present estimates , and no new physics is found in the tev energy region , we may be faced with de - facto evidence for the presence of fine - tuning . in such a situation ,",
    "the anthropic or multiple - universe considerations become highly attractive .",
    "finally , let us comment on the ability of these ideas to be tested . negatively",
    ", we can say that if the weak scale is what it is for anthropic reasons , there would be no need to invoke supersymmetry or technicolor or other structure at the weak scale to make the fine - tuning  natural \" [ 1 ] .",
    "if no such structure is found , then , it would be a point in favor of anthropic explanations ; indeed , in that case there would be few if any alternatives to an anthropic explanation .",
    "positive evidence is harder to come by . of course , we are not able to explore other domains in the universe .",
    "however , theories which generate multiple domains may be testable by other , more conventional means .",
    "for example , the community is hoping to be able to test the details of inflationary theories through cosmological measurements .",
    "likewise , direct physical experimentation has the potential to eventually sort out the correct underlying theory . through standard",
    "means we may be able to learn if the fundamental theory in fact produces multiple domains , in which case anthropic considerations automatically become relevant . until the time that this happens , our conclusion must be modest : the observed values of the mass parameters are reasonably typical of the anthropically allowed ranges .",
    "let us make a simple qualitative estimate of the deuteron binding energy .",
    "a well - known pedagogical model of the deuteron involves a square well of depth @xmath282 mev and range @xmath283 fm , with a hard core of radius @xmath284 .",
    "let us neglect the @xmath285-wave component , so that the @xmath286-wave solutions are    @xmath287    and    @xmath288    with @xmath289 , and @xmath290 .",
    "the boundary condition is therefore    @xmath291    there will be a range , @xmath292 , at which the binding energy goes to zero , _",
    "i.e. _    @xmath293    if we let @xmath294 , we can solve for the present value of @xmath217 _ via _ a taylor series .",
    "to first order in @xmath295 we have    @xmath296    now , the outer range of the potential is determined by the pion mass , @xmath297 .",
    "if we search for the value of the pion mass at which the deuteron becomes unbound , we equate    @xmath298    thus , according to this calculation , only a 20% increase in the pion mass would cause an unbound deuteron . and",
    "since the pion mass and the quark masses very nearly obey the relation    @xmath299    a 20% increase in the pion mass corresponds to a 40% increase in @xmath2 , or a factor of @xmath300 increase in @xmath5 .",
    "we shall parametrize the vacuum expectation value as    @xmath301 { \\rm mev},\\ ] ]    for small @xmath111 , where @xmath116 is some positive constant .",
