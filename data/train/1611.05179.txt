    "while at low energies ( from radio waves to x - rays ) , polarimetry is a powerful tool to gain an insight into understanding the working mechanisms of cosmic sources , this diagnostic is missing for photon energies @xmath6 .",
    "polarimetry would provide information on the magnitude , on the direction and on the structure , in particular on the turbulence , of the magnetic fields in the regions that are emitting high - energy @xmath5 rays , in particular of relativistic jets .",
    "* blazars * , for example , active galactic nuclei in which one jet points at a small angle with respect to our line of sight , show seds ( spectral energy distributions ) that have two broad maxima , both originating from non - thermal emission : the low - energy component is believed to proceed from synchrotron radiation from relativistic electrons , while the origin of the high - energy ( x - ray through @xmath5-ray ) component is still under debate , as both leptonic and hadronic models produce acceptable fits to the seds of most blazars ( a recent review can be found in this discussion of the 2010 flare of 3c 454.3 @xcite ) . in the leptonic model , the high energy component has contributions from synchrotron - self - compton ( ssc ) and from external compton ( ec ) radiation whose seed photons are from direct accretion disk emission and from any other external radiation field and are un - polarized . in the hadronic model , the high - energy emission consists primarily of contributions from proton synchrotron emission and synchrotron emission from secondary pairs produced in cascade processes . in most blazar classes , hadronic and",
    "leptonic models show similar degrees of x - ray polarization which makes polarization a weakly discriminant diagnostic , while in the @xmath5 energy range hadronic models predict still a large polarization fraction ( up to @xmath7 ) , in contrast with leptonic models for which the small polarized ssc `` signal '' is washed out by the huge unpolarized ec emission component : high - energy @xmath5-ray polarimetry will yield the discriminating diagnostic @xcite .",
    "a demonstration that a hadronic mechanism is at work in blazars would make agns the preferred suspect for the long - sought acceleration site of ultra - high - energy cosmic rays ( uherc ) .    for * pulsars * ,",
    "after fermi - lat s study showed that high - altitude emission zones are favored by observations@xcite thereby disfavoring polar - cap models@xcite , one can not cleanly discriminate between the two - pole caustic `` slot gap''@xcite , the outer gap@xcite and the striped wind@xcite models , in particular as the pulsar inclination and viewing angles are nuisance parameters .",
    "in contrast , polarization can provide a handle on the emission model , as the polarization signatures differs for the different models@xcite .",
    "as the polarization of the synchrotron emission is perpendicular to that of curvature radiation and as the transition between synchrotron and curvature radiation is expected to take place in the range 1 - 100mev in crab - like pulsars@xcite , a phase swing is expected to be observed by mev polarimeters , a signature for that transition .",
    "theoretical prediction of the energy - dependent polarization fraction and polarization angle phasograms from optical to high - energy @xmath5-rays will be needed to use these results for model discrimination , see , e.g. , fig.6 of ref.@xcite .",
    "note also the recent quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) treatment of curvature radiation in pulsar magnetospheres after which spin - flip radiation makes an important contribution in ( crab - like ) young pulsars and it even becomes dominant ( with respect to constant - spin ( classical ) emission ) in magnetars , and contrary to constant - spin ( classical ) radiation , radiation is mostly unpolarized@xcite .",
    "we have many reasons to think that the standard model ( sm ) could be the low - energy remnant of a broken high - energy symmetry",
    ". to parametrize this unknown , the standard - model extension ( sme ) has been built@xcite , an effective field theory ( eft ) that contains the standard model , general relativity , and , ordered after their mass dimension @xmath8 , all possible operators that violate lorentz symmetry ( * lorentz invariance violation * , liv ) , operators are absent in a linear theory and @xmath9 operators are gauge - violating , the development includes operators with @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath8-even operators conserve the cpt symmetry , while @xmath8-odd operators violate it@xcite . ]",
    "be it a global @xcite or a local @xcite liv . in the photon sector ,",
    "sme operators produce a number of effects that can be tested experimentally@xcite .",
    "dispersion is the variation of the speed of light with photon energy and is due to @xmath11 operators .",
    "birefringence arises from the fact that the operator parameters for left and right circular polarized photons can have opposite signs : any linear polarization is therefore rotated through an energy - dependent angle as photons propagate , which depolarizes an initially linearly polarized radiation consisting of a range of photon energies .",
    "hence , from the observation of linearly polarized radiation coming from a distant source we obtain upper limits of the operator parameter values .",
    "most birefringence tests are much more sensitive than dispersion tests , so only when no birefringence is present does dispersion provide useful information as is the case for @xmath12 limits , obtained from the non observation of any time - of - flight / energy correlations in agn flares ( of mrk 501 by magic@xcite , of pks 2155 - 304 by hess@xcite ) nor in grb090510 by the fermi / lat@xcite . for @xmath13 , limits are based on cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) polarization studies , while for @xmath14 and @xmath15 , birefringence limits are obtained from measurements of the polarization fraction of the soft-@xmath5-ray emission of grbs ( in the 200325 kev and in the 70 - 300 kev energy ranges for integral / ibis and ikaros , respectively ) @xcite . as none of these soft-@xmath5-ray grb polarimetry measurements , taken alone ,",
    "is found to be statistically significant ( see the review in ref.@xcite ) and as the rotation angle is proportional to the square of the photon energy , @xmath16 , the development of higher - energy polarimeters is eargerly needed .",
    "polarimetry of the radiation emitted by a far away source enables the search for hints of the * axion*@xcite , the putative pseudoscalar pseudo - goldstone boson induced by the breaking of the @xmath17 symmetry devised to solve the qcd cp problem . due to the axion - photon coupling ,",
    "the propagation of the photon through the magnetic field generated by the grb would induce a birefringence , that is a rotation of the direction of polarization , that turns out to depend on the photon energy , so that the effective average polarization fraction after propagation of a photon beam having a sizable energy spread would be diluted .",
    "the observation of a non - zero polarization fraction then translates to an upper limit on the axion - photon coupling @xmath18 .",
    "the limit is grb - model dependent , but it is presently the best limit for an axion mass close to @xmath19@xcite ( compare to the present fig.1 of ref.@xcite ) . as the limit is proportional to @xmath20 ,",
    "extending the polarization measurement to higher energies would lead to an improved value , or even to a detection of a possible axion - like - particle ( alp ) , one of these pseudoscalars that are not bound to the mass - to - coupling - constant relation that axions are subject to , and that may or may not be a component of dark matter .",
    "in contrast with the radio - wave and optical regimes for which polarimetry is performed by the measurement of electric fields or of light intensities , in the x - to-@xmath5-ray regime photons are detected one by one : the polarization information is extracted from a sample of such conversion events , from the distribution of an angle that is a measure of the orientation of the final state particles with respect to the polarization direction of the photon , an azimuthal angle , and that is denoted generically @xmath2 in this paper .",
    "whatever the process at work during conversion , be it photo - electric effect , compton scattering or pair conversion , due to the @xmath21 quantum numbers of the photon , the differential cross section is described by the expression : @xmath22    the modulation factor of the cosine , @xmath23 , is the product of the polarization asymmetry of the conversion process ( here of pair conversion ) , @xmath4 , and of the linear polarization fraction of the incoming radiation , @xmath0 . both @xmath4 and @xmath0",
    "are defined to be in the range @xmath24 $ ] and @xmath25 is the polarization angle of the incoming radiation .",
    "experimental effects affect the measurement of @xmath2 , which leads to an effective asymmetry , @xmath26 that is lower than the qed asymmetry , @xmath4 .",
    "their ratio @xmath27 is named the asymmetry dilution due to the experimental effects , @xmath28 .",
    "measuring @xmath5-ray linear polarization by pair production was first suggested by yang@xcite and the full polarized differential cross section was given by berlin@xcite and may@xcite ( an exhaustive review can be found at ref.@xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately , the * multiple scattering * of the two lepton tracks in the high-@xmath29 material converter plates of the past ( cos - b , egret ) and present ( fermi - lat ) telescopes blurs the azimuthal information , to the extent that the measurement of the azimuthal angle is impossible @xcite , the key point being that the lower multiple scattering undergone by higher - momentum tracks from the conversion of higher - energy photons is compensated for by the fact that higher - energy photons convert to pairs with a smaller average opening angle .    a way out has been sought with * triplet conversions * , in which the target electron recoils at a large polar angle , giving hope that measuring its azimuthal angle would be easier @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the useable fraction of the cross section , that is , the cross section of triplet conversion with the electron recoil momentum large enough that the track can be reconstructed is extremely small ( fig.6 of ref.@xcite ) , even for gas detectors , with the consequence that the sensitivity of a space polarimeter that would use triplet conversion is very low ( section 5.3 and figs .",
    "25 - 26 of ref.@xcite ) .",
    "past theoretical works showed that the asymmetry is larger when the two leptons share the energy equally@xcite , that it varies with the ( azimuthal ) acoplanarity , @xmath30@xcite and that it is larger for small pair opening angles@xcite .",
    "many attempts have been undertaken to increase the effective polarization asymmetry by applying a well - chosen event selection on the collected sample , in the hope that the sensitivity to polarization would be increased @xcite .",
    "actually , even though it is true that the asymmetry increases after selection , the gain is almost entirely lost by the reduction in the statistics of the sample , so that ultimately the gain in precision in the polarization fraction of the incident radiation , if any , is found to be small ( section 4.1 of ref.@xcite ) .",
    "another way out was sought by removing the w converters and using * pure silicon converter / trackers*. for thick wafers ( @xmath31 @xcite ) , the effective polarization asymmetry , and therefore the dilution factor , are still low because multiple scattering remains an issue .",
    "it s only if very thin wafers can be made , held and launched ( @xmath32 @xcite ) that there is some hope of a sizeable sensitivity to polarization ( see figs.5 and6 of ref.@xcite , though ) .",
    "another avenue is the use of a very high - resolution dense homogeneous active target such as an * emulsion detector*@xcite .",
    "graine has demonstrated the detection of a linear polarization signal with pairs in a 0.8 - 2.4gev @xmath5-ray beam at spring8 , at a @xmath33 significance level@xcite but their ability to get below 100mev where most of the statistics lie , remains an issue - ray beam and not for a space polarimeter , in particular since it has an efficiency of only @xmath34@xcite . ] .",
    "being sensitive at low energies is critical to @xmath5-ray polarimetry because the polarization asymmetry increases there and , more importantly , because the product of the conversion cross section and of the typical @xmath35 flux of a cosmic source peaks at @xmath36 ( fig.2 of ref.@xcite ) .",
    "the extreme solution to the multiple scattering hurdle is the use of low density , that is , of * gas detectors*. the harpo project used a time projection chamber ( tpc ) in which the conversion takes place in a fast - electron - drift , low - diffusion argon - based gas to perform the first demonstration of polarimetry with pairs at low energy with an excellent dilution factor@xcite .",
    "it was demonstrated that a @xmath5-ray polarimeter can be triggered and event reconstruction performed down to the lowest @xmath5-ray energy of 1.74mev that the polarized @xmath5-ray beam line bl01 of the newsubaru electron storage ring could provide@xcite .",
    "there is good prospects that the rapid degradation of the tpc gas quality that the egret spark chambers have undergone and that motivated a refill per year , is well under control with tpc proportional gas amplifiers @xcite .",
    "the possibility to perform astronomy , that is , photon - to - source assignment , on a single photon basis , down to so low an energy is uncertain especially due to the huge angular spread induced by the fact that the momentum of the recoiling ion can not be measured ( a parametrization of this contribution to the single - photon angular resolution can be found in section 3.1.2 of ref.@xcite ) .",
    "for grbs though , source assignment and trigger are taken care of globally for the burst , and the low energy @xmath5 rays can be logged , reconstructed and analyzed . for pulsars , measuring the phase difference with respect to the pulsar ephemerides",
    "enables to subtract the non pulsed background .    a similar project , which uses a negative - ion slow - electron - drift gas , is under development@xcite in the hope to get a device with enough amplification gain in the gas later this year@xcite .",
    "the low electron drift velocity ( more than three orders of magnitude lower than that in noble - gas - based mixtures ) and the pile - up of stray tracks from proton cosmic rays and from scattering of low - energy photons might , however , make negative - ion tpcs inappropriate for use in space .",
