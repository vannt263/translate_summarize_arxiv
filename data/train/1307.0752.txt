    "a long outstanding challenge in modern astrophysics is the intriguing observational behavior of the galactic rotation curves , and the mass discrepancy in clusters of galaxies .",
    "both these observations suggest the existence of a ( non or weakly interacting ) form of dark matter at galactic and extra - galactic scales . indeed , according to newton s theory of gravitation , at the boundary of the luminous matter",
    ", the rotation curves of test particles gravitating around galaxies or galaxy clusters should show a keplerian decrease of the tangential rotational speed @xmath1 with the distance @xmath2 , so that @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the dynamical mass within the radius @xmath2 .",
    "however , the observational evidence indicates rather flat rotation curves @xcite .",
    "the tangential rotational velocities @xmath1 increase near the galactic center , as expected , but then intriguingly remain approximately constant at a value of @xmath5 km / s .",
    "therefore , observations provide a general mass profile of the form @xmath6 @xcite",
    ". consequently , the mass around a galaxy increases linearly with the distance from the center , even at large distances , where very little or no luminous matter can be observed .",
    "as mentioned above , the observed behavior of the galactic rotation curves is explained by assuming the existence of some dark ( invisible ) matter , distributed in a spherical halo around the galaxies , and interacting only gravitationally with ordinary matter .",
    "the dark matter is usually described as a pressureless and cold medium .",
    "a recently proposed model considered the possibility that dark matter is a mixture of two non - interacting perfect fluids , with different four - velocities and thermodynamic parameters . the two - fluid model can be described as an effective single anisotropic fluid , with distinct radial and tangential pressures @xcite .",
    "in fact , many possible candidates for non - luminous dark matter have been proposed in the literature ranging from @xmath7 solar mass black holes , running through low mass stars to @xmath8 ev axions , although the most popular being the weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) ( for a review of the particle physics aspects of dark matter see @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , the interaction cross section of wimps with normal baryonic matter , although practically negligible , is expected to be non - zero , and therefore there is a possibility of detecting them directly . nevertheless , despite several decades of intense experimental and observational effort , there is presently still no direct evidence of dark matter particles @xcite .",
    "however , it is important to emphasize that the masses in galaxies and clusters of galaxies are deduced from the observed distances and velocities of the system under consideration .",
    "these relationships are based on newton s laws of dynamics , thus the newtonian dynamical masses of galactic systems are not consistent with the observed masses .",
    "indeed , newton s laws have proven extremely reliable in describing local phenomena , that there is an overwhelming tendency to apply them in the intermediate galactic scales .",
    "note that the mass discrepancy is interpreted as evidence for the existence of a _ missing mass _",
    ", i.e. , dark matter in galactic systems .",
    "therefore , one can not _ a priori _ exclude the possibility that einstein s ( and newtonian ) gravity breaks down at the galactic or extra - galactic scales .",
    "indeed , a very promising way to explain the recent observational data @xcite on the recent acceleration of the universe and on dark matter is to assume that at large scales einstein s general relativity , as well as its newtonian limit , breaks down , and a more general action describes the gravitational field .",
    "several theoretical models , based on a modification of newton s law or of general relativity , including modified newtonian orbital dynamics ( mond ) @xcite , scalar fields or long range coherent fields coupled to gravity @xcite , brane world models @xcite , bose - einstein condensates @xcite , modified gravity with geometry - matter coupling @xcite , non - symmetric theories of gravity @xcite , and eddington - inspired born - infeld gravity @xcite have been used to model galactic `` dark matter '' .    from a theoretical point of view a very attractive possibility is to modify the form of the einstein - hilbert lagrangian , so that such a modification could naturally explain dark matter and dark energy , without resorting to any exotic forms of matter .",
    "the simplest extension of the einstein - hilbert action consists in modifying the geometric part of the action , through the substitution of the ricci scalar with a generic function @xmath0 .",
    "this change in the action introduces higher order terms in the gravitational field action .",
    "the so - called @xmath0 gravitational theories were first proposed in @xcite , and later used to find a non - singular isotropic de sitter type cosmological solution @xcite .",
    "detailed reviews of @xmath0 theories can be found , for instance , in @xcite .",
    "the most serious difficulty of @xmath0 theories is that , in general , these theories can not pass the standard solar system tests @xcite .",
    "however , there exists some classes of theories that can solve this problem @xcite . using phase space analysis of the specific involved gravitational model ,",
    "it was shown that @xmath0 theories , in general , can explain the evolution of the universe , from a matter dominated early epoch up to the present , late - time self accelerating phase @xcite .",
    "@xmath0 type gravity theories can be generalized by including the function @xmath0 in the bulk action of the brane - world theories @xcite .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that this type of generalized brane world theories can describe a universe beginning with a matter - dominated era , and ending in an accelerated expanding phase .",
    "the classical tests of this theory were considered in @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath0 theories have also been studied in the palatini approach , where the metric and the connection are regarded as independent fields @xcite .",
    "in fact , these approaches are certainly equivalent in the context of general relativity , i.e. , in the case of the linear einstein - hilbert action . on the other hand , for a general @xmath0 term in the action",
    ", they seem to provide completely different theories , with very distinct field equations .",
    "the palatini variational approach , for instance , leads to second order differential field equations , while the resulting field equations in the metric approach are fourth order coupled differential equations .",
    "these differences also extend to the observational aspects .",
    "all the palatini @xmath0 models aimed at explaining the cosmic speedup studied so far lead to microscopic matter instabilities , and to unacceptable features in the evolution patterns of cosmological perturbations @xcite .",
    "hence , in order to cure some of the pathologies of the @xmath0 gravity models in both their metric and palatini formulation , a novel approach was recently proposed @xcite , that consists of adding to the einstein - hilbert lagrangian an @xmath0 term constructed within the framework of the palatini formalism . using the respective dynamically equivalent scalar - tensor representation ,",
    "even if the scalar field is very light , the theory can pass the solar system observational constraints .",
    "therefore the long - range scalar field is able to modify the cosmological and galactic dynamics , but leaves the solar system unaffected .",
    "the absence of instabilities in perturbations was also verified , and explicit models , which are consistent with local tests and lead to the late - time cosmic acceleration , were also found . furthermore , the cosmological applications of the hybrid metric - palatini gravitational theory were investigated in @xcite , where specific criteria to obtain the cosmic acceleration were analyzed , and the field equations were formulated as a dynamical system . indeed , several classes of dynamical cosmological solutions , depending on the functional form of the effective scalar field potential , describing both accelerating and decelerating universes , were explicitly obtained .",
    "the cosmological perturbation equations were also derived and applied to uncover the nature of the propagating scalar degree of freedom and the signatures these models predict in the large - scale structure .",
    "the general conditions for wormhole solutions according to the null energy condition violation at the throat in the hybrid metric - palatini gravitational theory were also presented in @xcite .",
    "a new approach to modified gravity which generalizes the hybrid metric - palatini gravity was introduced in @xcite .",
    "the gravitational action is taken to depend on a general function of both the metric and palatini curvature scalars . the dynamical equivalence with a non - minimally coupled bi - scalar field gravitational theory was proved .",
    "the evolution of the cosmological solutions in this model was studied by using dynamical systems techniques . in @xcite",
    "a method was developed to analyse the field content of `` hybrid '' gravity theories whose actions involve both the independent palatini connection and the metric levi - civita connection , and , in particular , to determine whether the propagating degrees of freedom are ghosts or tachyons .",
    "new types of second , fourth and sixth order derivative gravity theories were investigated , and from this analysis it follows that the metric - palatini theory is singled out as a viable class of `` hybrid '' extensions of general relativity .",
    "in addition to this , the stability of the einstein static universe was analysed in @xcite . in the latter , by considering linear homogeneous perturbations , the stability regions of the einstein static universe were parameterized by the first and second derivatives of the scalar potential , and it was explicitly shown that a large class of stable solutions exists in the respective parameter space .",
    "for a brief review of the hybrid metric - palatini theory , we refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "thus , the hybrid metric - palatini theory opens up new possibilities to approach , in the same theoretical framework , the problems of both dark energy and dark matter . in @xcite ,",
    "the generalized virial theorem in the scalar - tensor representation of the hybrid metric - palatini gravity was analysed . more specifically , taking into account the relativistic collisionless boltzmann equation , it was shown that the supplementary geometric terms in the gravitational field equations provide an effective contribution to the gravitational potential energy .",
    "indeed , it was shown that the total virial mass is proportional to the effective mass associated with the new terms generated by the effective scalar field , and the baryonic mass .",
    "this shows that the geometric origin in the generalized virial theorem may account for the well - known virial theorem mass discrepancy in clusters of galaxies .",
    "in addition to this , the astrophysical applications of the model were considered and it was shown that the model predicts that the mass associated to the scalar field and its effects extend beyond the virial radius of the clusters of galaxies . in the context of the galaxy cluster velocity dispersion profiles predicted by the hybrid metric - palatini model , the generalized virial theorem can be an efficient tool in observationally testing the viability of this class of generalized gravity models .",
    "thus , hybrid metric - palatini gravity provides an effective alternative to the dark matter paradigm of present day cosmology and astrophysics .    in this latter context , it is the purpose of the present paper to investigate the possibility that the observed properties of the galactic rotation curves could be explained in the framework of hybrid metric - palatini gravity , without postulating the existence of the hypothetical dark matter . as a first step in this study ,",
    "we obtain the expression of the tangential velocity of test particles in stable circular orbits around galaxies . since we assume that the test particles move on the geodesic lines of the space - time , their tangential velocity is determined only by the radial distance to the galactic center , and the metric , through the derivative of the @xmath9 metric component with respect to the radial coordinate .",
    "the metric in the outer regions of the galaxy is largely shaped by the energy contained in the effective scalar field of the hybrid metric - palatini gravitational theory .",
    "therefore the behavior of the neutral hydrogen gas clouds outside the galaxies , and their flat rotation curves , can be explained by the presence of the scalar field generated in the model . by using the weak field limit of the gravitational field equations in the hybrid metric - palatini model",
    "we obtain the explicit form of the tangential velocity , and show that the existence of a constant velocity region is possible for some specific values of the model parameters .",
    "since the observations on the galactic rotation curves are obtained from the doppler frequency shifts , we generalize the expression of the frequency shifts by including the effect of the scalar field .",
    "we also consider the velocity dispersion of the stars in the galaxy , and obtain the stellar velocity dispersion as a function of the scalar field .",
    "thus , at least in principle , all the basic parameters of the model can be obtained directly from astronomical observations .",
    "the knowledge of the tangential velocity allows the complete determination of the functional form of the scalar field from the observational data .",
    "the basic parameters of the model can be immediately obtained in the flat rotation curves region , which is determined by the derivative of the scalar field potential .",
    "hence the functional form of the scalar field can be obtained exactly , within the weak field limit of the model , for the entire galactic space - time , and tested at the galactic scale .",
    "therefore , all the physical parameters of the hybrid metric - palatini gravitational theory can be either obtained directly , or severely constrained by astronomical observations .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : b ] , the field equations of the hybrid metric - palatini gravity model , as well as the general fluid representation of the stress - energy tensor are presented . in section [ sect3 ] , the tangential velocity of test particles in stable circular",

    "the extra - terms in the gravitational field equations , which can be described as a function of an equivalent scalar field , modify , through the metric tensor components , the equations of motion of test particles , and induce a supplementary gravitational interaction , which can account for the observed behavior of the galactic rotation curves . due to the presence of the scalar field ,",
    "the rotation curves show a constant velocity region , which decay to zero at large distances from the galactic center , a behavior which is perfectly consistent with the observational data @xcite , and is usually attributed to the existence of dark matter . by using the weak field limit of the gravitational field equations ,",
    "the rotation curves can be completely reconstructed as functions of the scalar field , without any supplementary assumption .",
    "if the galactic rotation velocity profiles are known from observations , the galactic metric can be derived theoretically , and the scalar field function can be reconstructed exactly over the entire mass distribution of the galactic halo .    the formalism developed in the present paper could also be extended to the case of the galaxy clusters .",

    "we emphasize that the analysis of the geometric properties of the galaxy clusters can also be done in weak field approximation considered in the present paper .",

    "the nature and dynamics of the cosmological evolution can be investigated by using a variety of cosmological observations .",
    "one of the important methods for the study of the cosmic history relies on extracting the baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) in the high-@xmath44 galaxy power spectrum .",

    "the origin of the bao in the matter power spectrum can be understood as the velocity fluctuation of the baryonic fluid at the decoupling time .",
    "the characteristic scale of the baryon oscillation is determined by the sound speed and horizon at decoupling , which is a function of the total matter and baryon densities @xcite . since this scale can be measured in both the transverse and radial directions , the bao yields both the angular diameter distance , and the hubble parameter at that redshift .",
    "therefore , the precise measurement of the bao scale from the galaxy power spectrum can impose important constraints on the cosmic expansion history",
    ". different expansion histories in modified gravity models shifts the peak positions of oscillations relative to the @xmath203cdm model @xcite .",
    "therefore the predicted shifts in the bao can potentially be used to distinguish between the @xmath204cdm models and modified gravity models .",
    "thus , by using the bao analysis it can be shown that the original dvali - gabadadze - porrati model @xcite is disfavored by observations , unless the matter density parameter exceeds 0.3 @xcite .",
    "the recently released planck satellite data @xcite , as combined with the bao measurements @xcite provide strong constraints on the modified @xmath0 gravity model @xcite . in the @xmath0 modified gravity models the lensing amplitude return to be compatible with @xmath205 at 68% confidence limit ( c.l . )",

    "moreover , in the framework of the considered @xmath0 models the standard value of the lensing amplitude @xmath205 is in agreement with the planck measurements , oppositely to what happens in the @xmath203cdm scenario .",
    "the study of the bao and of the cmb data can provide very powerful and high precision constraints in discriminating between the hybrid metric - palatini gravity model , and alternative gravity models , as well as the standard dark matter model .",
    "weak gravitational lensing , whereby galaxy images are altered due to the gravitational field influence of the mass along the line of sight , is a powerful probe of the dark matter in cosmology , with promising results obtained in recent years @xcite . in standard general relativity",
    ", the weak lensing distortion field provides a direct tracer of the underlying matter distribution .",
    "however , modifications to gravity theory can conceivably alter the way that mass curves spacetime , and thus the way that null geodesics behave in a given matter distribution .",
    "the possibilities of constraining modified gravity theories with weak lensing were considered recently in @xcite . due to its sensitivity to the growth rate of the structure",
    ", weak lensing can be very useful to constrain modified gravity theories , and to distinguish between various modified gravity and standard dark matter models , when combined with cmb observations .",
    "future weak lensing surveys as euclid can constrain modified gravity models , as those predicted by scalar - tensor and @xmath0 theories . since the hybrid metric - palatini gravity model can be formulated in terms of an equivalent scalar - tensor theory ,",
    "the analysis of the future weak lensing observational data , such as those provided by the euclid mission , may provide a powerful method to observationally constrain the free parameters of this theoretical model . even that the effective scalar field of the hybrid metric - palatini gravity model provides a gravitational `` mass '' equivalent to the dark matter , due to the specific functional form and numerical values of the model parameters ,",
    "its imprint on the weak lensing properties on a cosmological scale is different from that of the standard dark matter .    in the present model",
    "all the relevant physical quantities , including the `` dark mass '' associated to the equivalent scalar - tensor description , and which plays the role of dark matter , its corresponding density profile , as well as the scalar field and its potential , are expressed in terms of observable parameters  the tangential velocity , the baryonic ( luminous ) mass , the doppler frequency shifts of test particles moving around the galaxy , and the velocity dispersions of the stars .",
    "therefore , this opens the possibility of directly testing the modified gravitational models with palatini type @xmath11 terms added to the gravitational action by using direct astronomical and astrophysical observations at the galactic or extra - galactic scale . in this paper",

    "<S> generally , the dynamics of test particles around galaxies , as well as the corresponding mass deficit , is explained by postulating the existence of a hypothetical dark matter . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the behavior of the rotation curves shows the existence of a constant velocity region , near the baryonic matter distribution , followed by a quick decay at large distances . in this work </S>",
    "<S> , we consider the possibility that the behavior of the rotational velocities of test particles gravitating around galaxies can be explained within the framework of the recently proposed hybrid metric - palatini gravitational theory . </S>",
    "<S> the latter is constructed by modifying the metric einstein - hilbert action with an @xmath0 term in the palatini formalism . </S>",
    "<S> it was shown that the theory unifies local constraints and the late - time cosmic acceleration , even if the scalar field is very light . in the intermediate galactic scale , we show explicitly that in the hybrid metric - palatini model the tangential velocity can be explicitly obtained as a function of the scalar field of the equivalent scalar - tensor description . the model predictions are compared model with a small sample of rotation curves of low surface brightness galaxies , respectively , and a good agreement between the theoretical rotation curves and the observational data is found . the possibility of constraining the form of the scalar field and the parameters of the model by using the stellar velocity dispersions is also analyzed . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the doppler velocity shifts are also obtained in terms of the scalar field . </S>",
    "<S> all the physical and geometrical quantities and the numerical parameters in the hybrid metric - palatini model can be expressed in terms of observable / measurable parameters , such as the tangential velocity , the baryonic mass of the galaxy , the doppler frequency shifts , and the stellar dispersion velocity , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the obtained results open the possibility of testing the hybrid metric - palatini gravitational models at the galactic or extra - galactic scale by using direct astronomical and astrophysical observations . +   + * keywords * : modified gravity : galactic rotation curves : dark matter : </S>"
