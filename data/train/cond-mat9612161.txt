    "recently , there has been increasing interest in biological materials research @xcite .",
    "the physical properties of colloids , liquid crystals , and macromolecular networks are of prime importance for the structure and function of biological entities such as cells and muscles . on the other hand , biology provides physicists with some of the most pertinent model systems to test their theories of soft matter . among these systems we will concentrate on solutions of semiflexible macromolecules here .",
    "the challenging problems associated with semiflexibility , which have been attacked by numerous groups over many years , have received recent attention .",
    "_ semiflexibility _ has been recognized as a crucial property for the understanding of many peculiar features of dna @xcite and actin @xcite",
    ". this may not be too surprising in the case of actin , which polymerizes into filaments that are rarely much longer than their persistence length .",
    "it is perhaps less obvious for dna molecules , which are typically orders of magnitude longer than their persistence length and thus have an overall flexible appearance .    in this paper",
    "we will concentrate on the _ dynamic _ aspects of semiflexibility .",
    "in contrast to the dynamics of flexible polymers @xcite the dynamic properties of semiflexible polymers are still not very well understood : whereas a simple , analytically tractable basic model for flexible polymers has been known for a long time , we lack such a generally accepted simple model in the case of semiflexible polymers .",
    "it seems worth mentioning the reason for simplicity and complexity in both cases .",
    "the standard model for the statics and dynamics of a flexible polymer is the gaussian chain @xcite , which represents the connection of the monomers by an isotropic harmonic potential characterized by a single parameter , the mean square end - to - end distance of the polymer .",
    "this description reproduces many of the universal large scale properties of flexible polymers , which are purely entropic in origin .",
    "the universality may be understood as a consequence of the central limit theorem .",
    "the harmonic theory allows extensions to nonideal problems by perturbation theory .",
    "the simplicity of the model is due to the fractal structure of the gaussian chain : it looks exactly the same on all scales .",
    "this property is clearly not shared by real polymers .",
    "they are coiled on large scales , but they are rodlike on length scales below their persistence length @xmath0 . a more realistic polymer model than the gaussian chain is the so - called _ `` kratky - porod '' _ model @xcite . in this model",
    "the conformation is derived from an effective free energy @xcite , @xmath7 which takes into account the energy cost of _ bending _ the contour .",
    "this is the contour integral over the square of the local curvature multiplied by the bending modulus @xmath8 .",
    "the conformation resulting from the above free energy together with the rigid constraint @xmath9 of an _ inextensible contour _ is known as the",
    "_ `` wormlike chain '' .",
    "_ it is not a fractal as for the gaussian chain model but a differentiable curve , which is indeed rodlike on short distances and coiled on large scales .",
    "short and long distances are measured with respect to the decay length of the tangent - tangent correlations , the persistence length @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "if one does not look for a description of the specific microscopic details of a macromolecule but wants to understand global universal properties , shared by large classes of molecules , then one need not worry about the microscopic discrepancy between a real polymer and the gaussian chain model in the case of proper flexible polymers with @xmath0 of the order of the lateral diameter @xmath1 . in this case",
    "the local rodlike structure is part of the nonuniversal microscopic details .",
    "however , @xmath11 is somewhat larger than 1 in several important cases , e.g. , for polystyrene , dna , actin etc .",
    "( for actin @xmath12 ) . one may still hope that the intrinsic stiffness is negligible , when the total contour length @xmath13 of the molecules is much larger than @xmath0 , because the large scale properties are then dominated by the coil structure .",
    "as far as the dynamics is concerned , this heuristic argument has one flaw with possibly serious consequences : _ hydrodynamic interactions _ play a crucial role for the dynamic properties of polymers in solution , as they do for any system of brownian particles in hydrodynamic solvents . because the dynamics of the solvent , which mediates these interactions , is usually much faster than the brownian dynamics ,",
    "the hydrodynamic interactions in dilute and semidilute solutions can be subsumed into an ( instantaneous ) mobility matrix , @xmath14 called the _ oseen tensor _ , which is calculated from the navier - stokes equation for the pure solvent @xcite .",
    "multiplied by a force acting at the origin it gives a contribution to the velocity @xmath15 of the solvent at any point in space @xmath16 .",
    "this velocity field has the characteristic feature to decay like @xmath17 in real space , where @xmath18 is the length of the vector @xmath16 ; i.e. , it is both long ranged and singular at the origin . physically speaking , the singularity is a consequence of idealizing a physical particle as a mass point and has to be cut off at about the diameter @xmath1 of the polymer . for a real polymer ,",
    "this short distance divergence has the consequence that its local semiflexible structure , which one would possibly prefer to neglect , may markedly pronounce itself in the dynamic properties , even if the polymer as a whole looks rather flexible .",
    "if one decides to take care of this effect , one immediately runs into a problem : the longitudinal degree of freedom of any contour element of the polymer is suppressed by the presence of its neighboring contour elements .",
    "this rigid constraint of a locally inextensible contour is the source of the difficulty in modeling the dynamics of ( intrinsically ) semiflexible polymers .",
    "it renders awkward any general theory @xcite which tries to represent this property faithfully . on the other hand , models that relax the constraint too much  as e.g. , the so - called harris - hearst - beals model @xcite and its latest descendants @xcite  include artificial stretching modes and find a gaussian distribution for all spatial distances along the contour ; i.e. , the essence of semiflexibility has obviously been lost .",
    "the correct radial distribution function of a semiflexible polymer with @xmath19 is actually very different from a gaussian distribution @xcite .",
    "it is not peaked at the origin and hence can not be approximated by a gaussian form . moreover , these `` gaussian '' models treat the thermal fluctuations to be isotropic . however , as was pointed out by many workers in the field ( see , e.g. , refs.@xcite ) , it is conceptually important to be aware of the _ local anisotropy _ of the bending undulations caused by the rigid constraint of constant contour length",
    ".    there is a special case , where semiflexible dynamics can be treated analytically with moderate expense .",
    "this is the limit of a _ weakly bending rod _ , which also has been addressed previously @xcite .",
    "however , these workers did not arrive at the results given below .",
    "especially the crucial point of the local anisotropy of the undulations , which was recognized in ref .",
    "@xcite but not discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , will be analyzed more closely in this contribution .",
    "we will show that this complication does not necessarily prevent an analytical approach . in a forthcoming publication @xcite we will also give a quantitative comparison of our results for the decay of the structure factor with new experimental data .",
    "below , we will demonstrate how one can incorporate the rather complex hydrodynamic interactions and effects from chemical cross - linking in a semidilute solution into the description on a reasonable level of accuracy . to be specific , for the computation of the dynamic structure factor we require the scale separation @xmath20 to be realized .",
    "here we have introduced the symbol @xmath2 for the mesh size in a semidilute solution and the scattering wavelength @xmath21 .",
    "the latter should be shorter than the mesh size to probe the dynamics of _ single _ polymers .",
    "the conditions in eq .",

    "[ secstr ] we derive the functional form of the decay of the dynamic structure factor for semiflexible polymers in solution .",
    "special attention has to be paid to the rigid constraint of constant contour length and to the hydrodynamic interaction .",
    "we demonstrate how this can be achieved in the case of interest .",
    "we give the exact analytical result for the time decay of the structure factor and show that it can be reduced to a simple stretched exponential law , which is readily applied to determine various parameters of interest from experimental data . in sec .",
    "[ secini ] we calculate the initial slope of the structure factor .",
    "this can be used to measure the microscopic lateral diameter @xmath1 of the polymer by a dynamic scattering experiment with @xmath22 .",
    "we show that the short time dynamics of semiflexible polymers is characterized by a wavelength - dependent dynamic exponent @xmath23 , which is computed explicitly .",
    "what is remarkable about our results compared to other predictions available in the literature @xcite is that they are simple analytical expressions , which at the same time excellently fit experimental data @xcite .",
    "finally , in sec .  [ seccon ] we summarize our findings and outline some possible experimental applications .",
    "for the following we suppose eq .",
    "( [ skatre ] ) holds .",
    "we concentrate on the common case of a semidilute solution , the dilute limit being included as a special case . with the conditions in eq .",
    "( [ skatre ] ) the decay of the structure factor is mainly caused by the local conformational fluctuations , whereas the global structure of the polymer network stays virtually fixed during the characteristic decay time .",
    "this allows for a description of the dynamics purely in terms of the transverse undulations of a weakly bending rod , i.e.  in terms of the langevin equation @xmath24 for the polymer contour @xmath25 . the random force ( per length ) @xmath26",

    "( [ mobmat ] ) accounts for the screening of the hydrodynamic self - interaction of a single molecule by the surrounding network : hydrodynamic interactions over distances longer than the mesh size are largely suppressed because of the larger effective viscosity of the solution as compared to the pure solvent .",
    "a formal derivation of the exponential screening term has been achieved before within a self - consistent approach known as the `` effective medium theory '' @xcite .",
    "one expects the screening length to be roughly equal to the mesh size .",
    "it was indeed shown to obey basically the same scaling law as a function of the concentration @xcite .",
    "simple geometrical considerations @xcite suggest that the mesh size of a semidilute solution of semiflexible polymers with a large ratio @xmath11 obeys to a very good approximation the scaling law @xmath29 until the mesh size becomes considerably larger than the persistence length .    for the following we will neglect the nonlocal nature of the mobility matrix eq .",

    "it is not a critical approximation to neglect the weak wavelength dependence of the mobility in the following considerations .",
    "this will allow for a simple expression for the decay of the structure factor , and at the same time it captures the main effect of the hydrodynamic self - interaction of the single polymers as well as their mutual interaction .",

    "they allow to probe in a quick and reliable experiment the internal dynamics of single polymers with the necessary statistical averaging inherently included .",
