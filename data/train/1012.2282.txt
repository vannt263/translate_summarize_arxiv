    "ever since pauli postulated the neutrino , its influence and significance for particle physics as well as for astrophysics has steadily been growing .",
    "the observation of flavour oscillations of atmospheric and solar neutrinos , as well as of reactor and accelerator neutrinos at long baseline , is a compelling evidence that neutrinos are massive .",
    "due to this fact and owing to their large abundance in the universe , neutrinos are considered as the primary candidate for hot dark matter in cosmology .",
    "thus , they could play an important role for the evolution of large scale structures ( lss ) in the universe . on the other hand ,",
    "the on - going investigations of neutrino properties , their mass hierarchy and especially their rest mass will open a door to the understanding of the origin of mass . here , a precision measurement of the neutrino rest mass can discriminate between different @xmath3-mass models , in particular whether they are of hierarchical type @xmath4 or of quasi - degenerate type @xmath5 . although experiments on neutrino flavour oscillation provide compelling evidence that neutrinos are massive , they can not provide an absolute mass value .",
    "therefore , other methods have to be applied .",
    "cosmological investigations provide very sensitive methods to determine an estimate for the neutrino mass . here , the sum of all neutrino mass eigenstates is being measured , since in cosmological processes the flavour can not be distinguished . using only wmap7 data , an upper limit of 1.2  ev@xmath6",
    "is determined for the sum of neutrino mass eigenstates @xcite .",
    "upcoming data from the planck satellite as well as from lsst and weak lensing surveys have the potential of probing the sum of neutrino masses with 50 mev@xmath6 sensitivity .",
    "however , while cosmologcal studies offer a very sensitive approach , one has to emphasize its generic model dependence , which easily leads to a factor of 2 of uncertainty in the neutrino mass prediction @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is essential to probe the neutrino mass with sub - ev sensitivity in laboratory experiments .",
    "in general , there are two approaches which are complementary in their physics objectives .",
    "one is the search for neutrinoless double @xmath0-decay ( @xmath7 ) , the other is the precise spectroscopy of @xmath0-decay at its kinematic end - point .",
    "the @xmath7 process requires the neutrino to be a majorana particle , thus it appears identical to its anti - particle . from neutrinoless double @xmath0-decay an effective majorana mass @xmath8",
    "is determined , which corresponds to the coherent sum of all mass eigenstates @xmath9 with respect to the pmns mixing matrix @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath11 here , not @xmath12 but @xmath13 appears , hence @xmath14 depends on complex cp - phases with the possibility of cancellations .",
    "this generic fact has to be taken into account in terms of a model - dependence when comparing claims or limits like @xmath15 @xcite to results from single @xmath0-decay experiments .",
    "nevertheless , upcoming @xmath7 experiments like gerda , majorana , sno+ , exo , and cuore have the potential to probe @xmath8 in the 20 - 50 mev/@xmath16 region . in @xcite , and @xcite the experimental and theoretical status of this field as well as the influences by matrix elements are discussed in more detail .",
    "experiments investigating single @xmath0-decay offer a direct and model - independent method to determine the absolute neutrino mass , since they rely only on the relativistic energy - momentum relation and energy conservation @xcite . in single @xmath0-decay the squared neutrino mass @xmath17",
    "is determined as an incoherent sum  in contrast to ( [ doppelbeta ] )  of all mass eigenstates according to the pmns matrix .",
    "@xmath18 currently , the best experimental bounds from single @xmath0-decay ( @xmath19 ) have been determined in the tritium @xmath0-decay experiments in mainz @xcite and troitzk @xcite , which have reached their sensitivity limit . at present new experiments",
    "are being assembled or designed which will increase the experimental precision by two orders of magnitude , thus increasing the sensitivity on @xmath20 by one order of magnitude to 200  mev / c@xmath21 .    the basic principle applied in this model - independent method",
    "is based on kinematics and energy conservation only , with the squared neutrino mass eigenstate @xmath22 appearing in the phase space factor . for a detailed description including",
    "final states and relativistic kinematics refer to @xcite .",
    "@xmath23 since the experimental resolution at present does not allow to resolve individual mass eigenstates , only a combined spectrum can be recorded , according to @xmath24 the electron neutrino mass parameter corresponding to ( [ singlebeta ] ) is derived by analyzing the spectrum close to the end - point , where @xmath25 is small and the mass term @xmath26 becomes significant .",
    "a non - zero neutrino mass will not only shift the end - point , but also change the spectral shape .",
    "the count rate at the end - point is very low and the absolute q - value is not known precisely enough , therefore it is far more important to measure the shape of the spectrum , rather than the end - point shift .",
    "a low end - point @xmath0 source for a large fraction of electrons in the end - point region is a key requirement as well as a high source luminosity and high energy resolution in addition to very low background . for single @xmath0-decay investigations",
    "there are two complementary approaches with different systematics .    1 .   the calorimeter approach , where the source is identical to the detector .",
    "+ here , metallic or dielectric @xmath27re crystal bolometers are used to capture the entire @xmath0-decay energy as differential energy spectrum . with @xmath28",
    "kev @xmath27re has the lowest end - point , but due to its rather long half - life of @xmath29  y the activity is low . since bolometers are modular , their number can be scaled in order to increase the sensitivity .",
    "this approach is being followed in the mare experiment .",
    "the spectrometer approach , where an external tritium source is used .",
    "+ in this case , the kinetic energy of the @xmath0-electrons is analyzed as integral spectrum by an electrostatic spectrometer . here",
    ", the source material is high purity molecular tritium @xmath30 with a low end - point at @xmath31  kev and a short half - life of @xmath32 , providing a high activity .",
    "this approach implies strict scaling laws for the size of the spectrometer and reaches its ultimate size and precision in the katrin experiment .    besides these approaches new ideas have recently come up .",
    "the project 8 proposal @xcite aims to make use of radio - frequency spectroscopy in order to measure the kinetic energy of @xmath0 electrons from a gaseous @xmath30 source . here",
    ", an array of antennas would capture the coherent cyclotron radiation emitted by the @xmath0-decay electrons when moving through a homogenous magnetic field . in @xcite",
    "the authors estimate an ultimate sensitivity of @xmath33  ev for this method . currently , a proof - of - principle experiment is in preparation in order to show that it is feasible to detect electrons and to determine their kinetic energy with this method . for details",
    "please see @xcite .",
    "as outlined above , mare ( microcalorimeter arrays for a rhenium experiment ) uses @xmath27re as @xmath0 emitter .",
    "the long half - life of this isotope is the result of the first order unique forbidden transition @xmath34 .",
    "mare will thus be performed in two phases with increased sensitivity .",
    "it is the successor of the manu and mibeta experiments , which derived an upper limit of @xmath35  ev from @xmath36 @xmath0-decays .",
    "phase i of mare aims to improve the current sensitivity on @xmath37 by one order of magnitude by increasing the statistics to @xmath38 @xmath0-decays .",
    "this will result in a sensitivity comparable to the mainz and troitzk experiments ( @xmath39  ev ) , thus scrutinizing their upper limit .",
    "using calorimeter pixel arrays , it will take three years to reach the intended number of decays .",
    "this time is used in parallel to finish the r&d program in order to improve the sensor technology for the next phase ii .",
    "the goal of mare phase ii is to improve the sensitivity by another order of magnitude with increased statistics of @xmath40 @xmath0-decays . with a sensitivity of @xmath41  ev mare will then be in a position to scrutinize a katrin result with a completely independent method and different systematics . in order to reach the projected sensitivity the operation of 50000 bolometer pixels",
    "is required over a measurement time of at least 5 years .",
    "detailed information about the present status and the progress of both mare phases can be found in @xcite , in addition to a review of the investigation of @xmath42ho as alternative @xmath0 emitter .",
    "the katrin ( karlsruhe tritium neutrino ) experiment @xcite makes use of a molecular gaseous tritium source and an electrostatic energy filter based on the mac - e filter principle @xcite .",
    "an overview of the main beam - line is given in figure [ fig : katrin ] .",
    "the mac - e filter uses magnetic adiabatic collimation in combination with an electrostatic energy filter .",
    "electrons emitted in the source at high magnetic field enter the spectrometer , where the magnetic field drops by several orders of magnitude . maintaining a strictly adiabatic regime with full energy conservation",
    ", the magnetic gradient force transforms the cyclotron energy of the isotropically emitted electrons into the longitudinal component . at the same time",
    ", the increasing potential of the electrostatic filter slows down the electrons by reducing their longitudinal energy .",
    "both effects have to be aligned very carefully for a proper energy analysis .",
    "only electrons which are able to cross the potential in the spectrometer are counted , thus the mac - e filter acts as high - pass filter for electrons .",
    "its relative resolution is defined by the magnetic field ratio between minimum field in the center of the spectrometer and maximum field at the pinch magnet .",
    "this defines the overall electromagnetic design of katrin and the size of its components .",
    "katrin faces challenges in all key technologies which are applied in the experiment . as an example",
    ", about @xmath43 electrons / s are emitted in the source , while at the far detector side a background rate of the order of @xmath44  cps has to be reached .",
    "the source column density , temperature and pressure has to be kept stable at the @xmath45 level .",
    "the transport section has to reduce the tritium gas flow by a huge amount of @xmath40 , in order not to increase the background in the spectrometer section .",
    "in addition the decay electrons have to be transported fully adiabatically on the mev - scale over a distance of about 50  m. in the spectrometer region , carefully designed electromagnetic field conditions have to be implemented with high voltage stability on the @xmath46 scale for operating voltages up to @xmath47  kv . in particular , electromagnetic conditions leading to penning - like trapping conditions have to be avoided in order to reach low background rates .",
    "the following subsection addresses the details of some key components and their present status .",
    "the katrin setup stretches over 70  m. the windowless gaseous tritium source ( wgts ) provides a high activity of @xmath43 @xmath0-decays per second .",
    "the tritium gas is injected in the center part of the source beam - tube and flows to both ends , where it is removed again by pumps .",
    "electrons emitted by the t@xmath48-decay are guided by strong magnetic fields ( @xmath49  t in the source , @xmath50  t in the transport section ) to the transport section and finally to the spectrometer section , while at the same time retaining the gas flow by 14 orders of magnitude .",
    "the pre - spectrometer  which is a mac - e filter operating at moderate resolution of about @xmath51  ev  can be used to transmit only electrons with energies close to the t@xmath48 end - point . in this operation mode",
    ", only electrons of the end - point region would enter the main spectrometer for the precise energy analysis .",
    "the main spectrometer is a mac - e filter and offers a resolution of @xmath52  ev resolution for @xmath31  kev electrons by applying a magnetic field ratio of @xmath53 .",
    "the latter defines the size of the main spectrometer , since the full magnetic flux tube of the source has to be analyzed .      in order to meet its sensitivity goal",
    ", katrin requires a stable source with high luminosity , and low systematic effects .",
    "the design luminosity of @xmath54  bq requires @xmath55 t@xmath48 molecules to be injected per second into the source tube , which adds up to a throughput of 40  g per day .",
    "a unique research facility in europe providing the corresponding tritium technology is tritium laboratory karlsruhe ( tlk ) , located at the kit campus north site .",
    "the tritium purity has to be kept above 95% , the source temperature at @xmath56  k , and the injection pressure at @xmath45  mbar . in order to achieve a stable column density all these parameters have to be stable on the @xmath45 level .    at tlk",
    "a sophisticated @xmath30 loop system has been commissioned for katrin , providing a stable t@xmath48 injection rate and a high purity isotope separation stage @xcite .",
    "being designed for a stability of @xmath45 , test runs showed that the loop system reaches a @xmath57 stability level for over 4 months .",
    "a new concept of temperature stabilization is applied to the wgts beam tube ( @xmath58  m , @xmath59",
    "cm ) in order to achieve a stability of @xmath60 at the source operating temperature .",
    "the inner beam - tube is directly coupled to a two phase ne thermosiphon @xcite .",
    "this novel concept is presently being tested at the wgts demonstrator , which is the inner part of the wgts cryostat without superconducting magnets .",
    "after the demonstrator tests the wgts cryostat will be completed in order to be ready for implementation into the katrin beam - line in 2012 .",
    "adjacent to the wgts the transport section guides the decay electrons to the spectrometer section by strong magnetic fields of @xmath50  t. tritium retention by the factor @xmath40 is achieved in two steps .",
    "first the differential pumping section dps uses active pumping to provide a t@xmath48 retention of @xmath61 .",
    "the dps2-f cryostat is on - site and its commissioning has recently been completed .",
    "the cryogenic pumping section cps uses cryo - sorption to achieve a further retention of @xmath62 . here",
    ", the liquid he cold inner beam - tube is covered with ar frost , providing a large surface to cryo - sorp the t@xmath48 .",
    "the cps concept has been successfully tested in @xcite , the cryostat is expected to be on - site in mid 2011 .",
    "the spectrometer section consists of two mac - e filters .",
    "the pre - spectrometer is a mac - e filter with sufficient resolution to cut the low energy part of the @xmath0 spectrum at about 300  ev below the end - point , if required . at present",
    "it acts as an important test setup , where all major technologies for the main spectrometer have been tested , i.e. the vacuum concept , the electromagnetic design as well as electron transmission properties and the detector concept .",
    "especially the electromagnetic design will have a strong impact on the background reduction .",
    "even tiny @xmath63-sized penning - like traps close to the ground electrode can cause background rates of @xmath64  cps .",
    "based on the advanced katrin field calculation code , the electrode shape has been refined avoiding these traps and resulting in a background level of a few @xmath45  cps .",
    "this rate can not be distinguished from the detector background , hence the pre - spectrometer is considered as quasi background free .",
    "remaining background features have originated from rn decays in the volume , which come from auxiliary components and the seas non - evaporable getter material .",
    "the auxiliary parts involved have been removed and rn from the getter material has been eliminated by ln@xmath48 baffles , for details see @xcite .",
    "the pre - spectrometer will be integrated into the beam - line in 2011 .",
    "the main spectrometer analyses the @xmath0-decay electrons of the end - point region with a resolution of @xmath52  ev and has to operate with a background rate at the @xmath45  cps level .",
    "therefore , background from low - energy electrons created by cosmic muons in the vessel wall have to be rejected . for this purpose not only a magnetic shielding is being relied upon , but also a uhv compatible wire electrode system ( 240 modules , 23000 wires , @xmath65  mm precision ) is currently being installed , see figure [ fig : mainspec ] .",
    "vacuum tank and wire electrode provide the precise retarding potential for the energy filter and are supplied by high - voltage equipment at a precision level of @xmath46 .",
    "this level is of key importance for the @xmath3-mass measurement , thus it will be monitored by ultra - precise high - voltage dividers @xcite and a monitor spectrometer beam - line .",
    "the latter uses the same retarding potential and measures mono - energetic electron sources .",
    "since the electromagnetic properties of the mac - e filter are extremely sensitive to distortions of the magnetic field , an air coil system has been installed .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : mainspec ] it consists of large coils around the vacuum vessel .",
    "the air coil system compensates the earth magnetic field and in addition it is used for the fine tuning of the magnetic flux tube .",
    "the transmitted electrons are counted by a detector based on a monolithic 148 pixel si - pin diode with an energy resolution of about 1  kev , and the ability to detect rates from @xmath45  cps in the end - point region and up to @xmath66  cps during calibration runs , while keeping the background low .",
    "mechanically it is designed like a dartboard with 9  cm diameter and 12 concentric rings with @xmath67 segmentation .",
    "the detector setup including magnets , vacuum components and daq is being delivered for system integration in early 2011 @xcite .",
    "after commissioning and testing , the complete system integration is planned for late 2012 . as soon as the setup is in measurement condition , katrin will take 3 years of data , which corresponds to 5 years real - time .",
    "the statistical uncertainty is estimated to be @xmath68  ev@xmath69 .",
    "likewise , the systematic uncertainty is being restricted to @xmath70  ev@xmath69 in order to minimize the total uncertainty to @xmath71  ev@xmath69 .",
    "this leads to the katrin design sensitivity of @xmath72  ev@xmath6 ( 90% cl ) and the discovery potential of @xmath73  ev@xmath6 with 5@xmath74 significance .",
    "the on - going efforts to measure the absolute mass of neutrinos is well motivated by recent results in particle and astroparticle physics .",
    "the investigation of @xmath0-decay offers a model - independent method for determining the @xmath3-mass .",
    "the re - based mare experiment is going to check the present limits , while at the same time improving the detector technology . in future",
    ", mare will be able to scrutinize a katrin result , after operating 50000 bolometer pixels for at least 5 years .",
    "new concepts for @xmath0-spectroscopy such as projects 8 will open new ways to optain sub - ev sensitivities and should be matured in an r&d phase .",
    "the estimated sensitivity of the tritium - based katrin experiment is @xmath72  ev/@xmath16 ( 90% cl ) .",
    "its construction is proceeding well with several of the major components being already on - site .",
    "the main spectrometer test program will start in 2011 and the complete system integration is planned for 2012 .",
