    "during 1996 - 2000 hera collided electrons or positrons ( @xmath1=27.6  gev ) with protons ( @xmath2 between 820 and 920  gev ) .",
    "open charm ( @xmath3 ) production , which has been extensively studied , occurs in few steps : a ) hard process , e.g. boson - gluon fusion ( bgf ) , where a photon ( @xmath4 ) or z boson emitted from the incoming electron fuses with a gluon ( @xmath5 ) from the proton , producing a @xmath6 pair ; b ) initial / final state parton shower development ; c ) fragmentation of a final - state parton into a hadron .",
    "two kinematic regions have been explored : 1 ) deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) with photon virtuality @xmath7 , where the scattered electron is visible in the main detector ; 2 ) photoproduction ( php ) with @xmath8 , where the virtual photon radiated from the incoming electron is quasi - real .    the large mass of the @xmath3 quark provides a  hard \" scale needed for the comparison of data to qcd predictions . in leading order ( lo ) qcd ,",
    "two types of processes are responsible for charm php : direct photon processes , where the photon interacts as a point - like particle and resolved photon processes , where the photon acts as a source of partons .",
    "bgf is the dominant direct photon process .",
    "charm quarks present in the parton distributions of the photon lead to lo resolved charm excitation processes like @xmath9 .",
    "various nlo calculations exist for comparison with charm hera data : 1 ) fixed - order ( fo ) approach  @xcite , where only u , d , s are active flavours in the photon and proton ; 2 ) resummed ( rs ) approach  @xcite , where a  massless \" @xmath3 quark is also an active flavour ; 3 ) matched ( fonll ) calculation  @xcite , which incorporates mass effects up to nlo and the resummation of @xmath10 logarithms up to next - to - leading logarithm ( nll ) level .",
    "all these approaches are based on the dglap evolution  @xcite .",
    "the cascade  @xcite monte carlo ( mc ) , based on the ccfm evolution  @xcite , is a more recent tool to compare with the data .",
    "charm can be tagged by reconstructing charm mesons via decays such as @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , where charge conjugate states are included , or by measuring semileptonic electrons or muons from charm .",
    "reconstructing charm hadrons via their decay vertices with a silicon tracker significantly reduces the background .",
    "inclusive production of the charm mesons @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 in dis has been studied  @xcite with the h1 detector , using a sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of @xmath19 .",
    "a silicon tracker separates the production and decay vertices of the pseudoscalar mesons .",
    "differential cross sections have been measured for the @xmath18 and @xmath16 mesons and compared with the aroma  @xcite lo mc predictions in the kinematic range @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the electron inelasticity and @xmath25 and @xmath26 are , respectively , the transverse momentum and pseudorapidity of the @xmath27 meson .",
    "@xmath26 is defined to be positive in the proton beam direction .",
    "results for the @xmath18 channel are shown in fig.1 .",
    "the lower shaded bands indicate the aroma beauty contribution , scaled by the excess factor of data over mc , as found in the h1 publication  @xcite .",
    "the distributions are well described by the lo qcd simulation , both in normalisation and shape .",
    "inclusive php of @xmath15 mesons has been measured  @xcite with the zeus detector in the kinematic region @xmath28 , photon - proton centre - of - mass energies @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 , using an integrated luminosity of @xmath32 . the measured differential cross sections were compared with the nlo predictions fo  @xcite , rs  @xcite and fonll  @xcite . in fig.2 the distributions @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 are compared with the fo and rs calculations , where @xmath37 is the fraction of the photon energy carried by the @xmath38 meson in the proton rest frame .",
    "theoretical uncertainties obtained by varying the charm mass and renormalisation scale are large , in particular for the nll predictions .",
    "the central fo predictions are below the data , mainly for @xmath39 and low @xmath40 .",
    "the nll calculations are closer to the data .",
    "in particular nll is better than fo for @xmath36 and for @xmath39 .",
    "a significant resolved contribution is required in the nll predictions , which show some sensitivity to the photon structure function parametrisation .",
    "the precise zeus data enable measurements of double differential cross sections . in fig.3 the @xmath26 distributions for four regions in @xmath10 are compared with fo and fonll predictions .",
    "the data is close to the upper band of the predictions and is significantly above the fo and fonll calculations at medium @xmath10 and positive @xmath26 , where even the upper bounds are below the data .",
    "fonll predictions are close to the fo ones for low @xmath10 , but below fo for large @xmath10 , where fonll should do better .",
    "charm - dijet php events enable the study of the photon structure , in particular it s charm content .",
    "inclusive php of @xmath38-dijet events has been measured  @xcite with the zeus detector in the kinematic region @xmath28 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 , using an integrated luminosity of @xmath48 . here",
    "@xmath49 is the jet - jet effective mass and @xmath50 is the average pseudorapidity of the two jets .",
    "the fraction of the photon momentum producing the two jets is given by : @xmath51 .",
    "this quantity is close to 1 for direct photons and is less than 1 for resolved photons .",
    "a sample of direct- ( resolved-)enriched events is defined as @xmath52 .",
    "the differential cross section @xmath53 is compared in fig.4 with lo predictions of the mc programs pythia  @xcite , herwig  @xcite and cascade  @xcite and with nlo fo predictions  @xcite .",
    "a significant contribution ( @xmath54 ) arises from resolved photons .",
    "there is a good agreement in shape between the data and the lo mcs , except that cascade is too high for the high @xmath55 region .",
    "the low @xmath55 tail of the nlo prediction is below the data .",
    "the angle between the jet - jet axis and the beam axis in the dijet rest frame can be approximated by @xmath56 .",
    "in qcd the differential cross section @xmath57 is sensitive to the spin of the propagator in the hard subprocess .",
    "whenever the propagator in the lo diagram is a quark , the cross section rises slowly as @xmath58 , and when it is a gluon , it rises steeply as @xmath59 .",
    "5 shows @xmath60 separately for the resolved - enriched ( @xmath61 ) and direct - enriched ( @xmath62 ) samples .",
    "the lo mcs pythia and herwig describe the shapes of both data samples .",
    "the direct sample rises slowly with @xmath63 , consistent with the q - exchange bgf up - left diagram of fig.4 .",
    "the resolved sample rises strongly with @xmath63 , indicating a g - exchange signature .",
    "consequently , the lo subprocess @xmath64 ( up - right diagram of fig.4 ) can not dominate the resolved photon charm - dijet process .",
    "this suggests the dominance of the lo charm - excitation process @xmath65 ( down - right diagram of fig.4 ) .",
    "the two jets can be distinguished by associating the @xmath38 meson to the closest jet in @xmath66 space . calling this ",
    "@xmath38 jet \" jet 1 , the @xmath67 rise can be studied separately for the photon and proton directions .",
    "7 shows the differential cross sections as a function of @xmath68 for the resolved- and direct - enriched samples .",
    "the pythia estimation of the resolved process contribution to the direct - enriched sample ( fig.7b ) explains the asymmetric distribution in @xmath69 .",
    "the strong rise in @xmath67 towards the photon direction for the resolved - enriched sample is clear evidence for charm from the photon in the lo picture .",
    "the nlo fo predictions describe the data well for @xmath62 ( fig .",
    "7d ) , but are below the data for @xmath61 ( fig .",
    "7c ) , both for the proton and photon directions .",
    "the data shapes are reproduced .",
    "the cascade predictions exceed the data by @xmath70 , mostly for @xmath62 .",
    "again the shapes are reasonably well reproduced .",
    "charm quark hadronisation into charm mesons is parametrised by fragmentation functions , which exist in many forms with tunable parameters fixed from fits to @xmath0 data .",
    "a direct measurement of the fragmentation function at hera can reduce theoretical uncertainties and test the universality of charm fragmentation .",
    "charm - jet php events have been measured  @xcite with the zeus detector , using an integrated luminosity of @xmath48 , in the kinematic region @xmath28 , @xmath41 .",
    "at least one jet had to satisfy @xmath71 , @xmath43 and a @xmath38 meson with @xmath72 , @xmath73 had to be associated with a jet .",
    "the fraction of jet energy carrried by the @xmath38 was defined as @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the @xmath38 longitudinal momentum relative to the jet axis . the normalised differential cross section in @xmath40",
    "was compared to the pythia lo mc with the peterson fragmentation function  @xcite @xmath76^{-1}$ ] , for various values of the free parameter @xmath77 .",
    "strong sensitivity to the @xmath77 value was found .",
    "a fit to the best value yielded @xmath78 , compared to 0.053 from lo fits to the lep data .",
    "the @xmath40 distribution measured with the zeus data was compared to that from @xmath0 colliders , where @xmath40 was defined as @xmath79 . the comparison with opal and argus results",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "similar shapes are obtained for @xmath80 with precision of the hera data competitive with the lep data .",
    "the low-@xmath40 peak in the opal data is due to gluon splitting to @xmath6 .",
    "the results support the universality of the charm fragmentation function .",
    "the h1 measurements  @xcite of inclusive charm mesons in the dis regime ( section 2 ) were used to deduce preliminary fragmentation fractions of the charm quark to the various mesons .",
    "the results , compared with the @xmath0 world average values ( in brackets ) , are : + @xmath81 + @xmath82 + @xmath83 + @xmath84 + where the first uncertainty is statistical , the second is systematic and the third is from theory .",
    "in addition , the h1 measured cross sections were used to test the isospin invariance of the fragmentation process by calculating the ratio of neutral ( @xmath85 ) to charged ( @xmath86 ) @xmath27-meson production + @xmath87 + and to extract the strangeness suppression factor + @xmath88 and the fraction of @xmath27 mesons produced in a vector state @xmath89 . here",
    "@xmath90 is the @xmath91 branching ratio .",
    "the results , compared with previous values , are : + @xmath92 ( h1 prel . )",
    "+ @xmath93 ( @xmath0 world average ) + @xmath94 ( h1 prel . ) + @xmath95 ( zeus ) + @xmath96 ( @xmath0 world average ) + @xmath97 ( h1 prel . ) + @xmath98 @xmath99 ( zeus prel . ) + @xmath100 ( @xmath0 world average ) . +",
    "all the hera measurements are in good agreement with @xmath0 world average results , indicating again the universality of charm fragmentation .",
