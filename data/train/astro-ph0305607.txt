    "cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) are binary star systems that consist of a white dwarf ( primary ) and a late spectral type m star ( secondary ) that fills its roche lobe , allowing mass to transfer to the white dwarf via the inner lagrangian point .",
    "the actual scenario of mass transfer depends on the magnetic field strength of the primary ( warner 1995 ) .",
    "if the magnetic field is weak ( @xmath4 1 mg ) , then an accretion disc forms , whereas if the magnetic field is @xmath3 1 - 10 mg the inner parts of the accretion disc are truncated where the magnetic pressure dominates .",
    "when the magnetic field strength exceeds @xmath3 20 mg , the accretion disc is totally disrupted and mass flows along the magnetic field lines . as the above descriptions imply , cataclysmic variables come in an assortment of  flavors \" as described by hellier ( 2001 ) and warner ( 1995 ) , with the highest field systems called polars and the intermediate field systems called intermediate polars ( ips ) .",
    "sw sex stars are one subset of cataclysmic variables that are usually found as high inclination systems with orbital periods of 3 - 4 hrs and approximately 20 such systems are known .",
    "there are 58 novalikes ( nls ) in this period regime of which 34% are known to be sw sex stars and 17% are known to be ips ( ritter & kolb 2003 ) .",
    "the sw sex stars show an offset of @xmath3 0.20 between photometric and spectroscopic phases , strong single peaked hei and balmer emission lines , unusually strong heii ( near the strength of h@xmath5 ) and absorption near @xmath6 @xmath3 0.50 in the balmer and hei lines ( honeycutt , schlegel & kaitchuck 1986 ; szkody & pich 1990 ; thorstensen et al .",
    "1991 ; hoard & szkody 1997 ) . although most of the 9 sw sex stars that have been observed show low circular polarization ( from measurements with an accuracy of a few tenths of a percent ; stockman et al .",
    "1992 ) , a few do have observed marginal polarization , ( rodrguez - gil et al . 2001 , 2002 ) indicating that magnetic fields may play a role in these systems and they may indeed all be ips .",

    "the period of 3.28 hrs places sdss j1327 in the regime of sw sex stars and ips ( warner 1995 ) .",
    "the mass transfer rates are usually large in this period range , resulting in prominent accretion discs and low hot spot contribution to the total light .    since the time - resolution of the photometry is only six minutes , it was not possible to detect any structure within the eclipse nor search for any short timescale variations that could be related to a spin period for the white dwarf .",
    "the 43 time - resolved spectra acquired at apo reveal different eclipse depths in the lines and a changing structure within the lines during the orbit .",
    "figure 4 shows a sample of the normalized spectra .",
    "this figure , as well as the equivalent width and flux plots ( figure 5 ) reveal that the heii flux has a deeper eclipse than h@xmath5 .",

    "fwhm values of the individual gaussians of the 60 - 80 km s@xmath15 and the gaussian separations of 1400 - 1800 km s@xmath15 resulted in velocities giving the best fit ( least overall error @xmath16 ) to the sine function @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the systemic velocity , k is the semi - amplitude and @xmath6 is the offset from the photometric eclipse phasing ( inferior conjunction of the secondary ) . the best fit parameters for the lines of h@xmath14 , h@xmath5 and heii are also listed in table 3 and the radial velocity curves are shown in figure 6 .",
    "the phase offset between the photometry and spectroscopy is large ( 0.2 ) and provides further evidence that sdss j1327 is an sw sex star .",
    "system parameters of m@xmath19 , m@xmath20 , q and i can be estimated from the combination of the photometric and spectroscopic data , using equations ( 4 ) , ( 5 ) and ( 7 ) from downes et al .",
    "( 1986 ) and using @xmath5 = 1 ( no deviation from the standard spherical approximation to the roche geometry at small q ) . using the value of @xmath21 = 0.045 ( the orbital phase at which 50% of the eclipsed star s light is reduced ) , k@xmath20 = 163 km s@xmath15 ( from heii ) and the determined period , p = 3.28 hrs , yields :    i = 80@xmath2 + 3@xmath2/@xmath91@xmath2 , + m@xmath19 = 0.4 @xmath11 0.2 m@xmath22 , + m@xmath20 = 0.8 @xmath11 0.2 m@xmath22 , + q = 0.5 @xmath11 0.1 .",

    "these resulting parameters for sdss j1327 are very similar to the values determined for v1315 aql ( downes et al .",
    "1986 ) .",
    "doppler tomograms for h@xmath14 , h@xmath5 and heii were also constructed in order to further locate the origin of the emission lines .",
    "the fourier - filtered back - projection routines of horne ( 1991 ) were used to compute the tomogram , using the systemic velocity for heii for all the lines .",
    "the spectra were binned into 0.04 phase intervals , with eclipse phases 0.95 - 0.05 omitted .",
    "the results are shown in figure 7a - c , along with the roche lobe of the secondary and the trajectory of the transfer stream ( lower curve ) and the keplerian velocities in the disc along the stream trajectory ( upper curve ) plotted for a mass ratio of 2 and the k of heii ( table 2 ) .",
    "these tomograms show a different structure in each of the lines .",
    "the heii ( figure 7a ) shows an emission region close to the white dwarf .",
    "this is consistent with the eclipse of the heii lines as described above .",
    "the h@xmath5 tomogram ( figure 7b ) shows two spots , one near the edge of the mass transfer stream location and the other in the @xmath9v@xmath23 , @xmath9v@xmath24 quadrant .",
    "the h@xmath14 tomogram ( figure 7c ) shows a region of emission primarily on the @xmath9v@xmath23 axis , with some evidence of a ring of emission from the disc .",
    "none of the tomograms show any evidence for irradiation of the secondary .",
    "these tomograms are not like those of typical disc systems ( kaitchuck et al .",
    "1994 ) which show a ring of emission with a prominent hot spot in the @xmath9v@xmath23 , + v@xmath24 quadrant",
    ". however , they are very similar to the tomograms of other sw sex stars ( e.g. bh lyn , uu aqr ; hoard & szkody 1997 , hoard et al . 1998 ) . while many models to explain the sw sex phenomena have been invoked ( see the summary in warner 1995 ) , hoard et al .",
    "( 1998 ) account for the odd location of the emission in tomograms and the differences between systems .",
    "they use a model with a stream impact that is dependent on the mass transfer rate . at high rates ( periods near 4 hrs ) ,",
    "there is an explosive impact of the stream with the disc that produces a bright spot at the impact site and effectively stops the flow . at low mass transfer rates ( periods near 3 hrs )",
    ", the stream overflows the disc and continues downstream , creating absorption near phase 0.5 .",
    "the relatively short period of sdss j1327 should place it near the lower mass transfer systems such as v1315 aql ( dhillon , marsh & jones 1991 ) , so overflow would be expected .",
    "this could be the cause of the slightly displaced emission in the h@xmath14 tomogram and the more prominent displaced emission in the h@xmath5 tomogram .",
    "the spectropolarimetry measurement revealed a circular polarization limit of 0.24% , ruling out the presence of a strong magnetic field in the white dwarf in sdss j1327 .",
    "however , this limit is typical for most ips and sw sex stars ( stockman et al .",
    "1992 ) and only 2 sw sex stars have marginally significant measured polarization at low levels of a few tenths of a percent ( rodrguez - gil et al . 2001 , 2002 ) .",
    "sdss j1327 is a cv discovered in the sloan digital sky survey which shows strong balmer and heii emission lines .",
    "the light curve of sdss j1327 displays deep eclipses , indicating a high inclination system with an orbital period of 3.28 hrs .",
    "an offset of 0.2 phase between the photometric and spectroscopic phases , as well as the presence of absorption within the hei and balmer emission lines indicates that sdss j1327 is an sw sex star .",
    "doppler tomography confirms this picture , showing the heii emission concentrated near the white dwarf and the balmer emission concentrated in phases downstream of the hot spot .",
    "the low limiting value to the circular polarization of 0.24% is also consistent with the available data on sw sex stars . while the emerging picture of this system seems clear , further photometry at better time resolution",
    "is needed to resolve the eclipse structure and search for any short periodicities that could be related to the spin period of the white dwarf .",
