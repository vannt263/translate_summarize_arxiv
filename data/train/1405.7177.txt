    "determination of quark masses is extremely important , for both phenomenological and theoretical applications.@xcite about the importance of the mass of the bottom quark , as a fundamental parameter of the standard model , see also review by el - khadra and luke.@xcite    many spectroscopic quark models , based on two - body interactions , have been developed ( see e.g. ref .   and references therein ) .",
    "these are called `` hyperfine interaction '' ( hfi ) in analogy with the atomic physics .",
    "the simplest hfi is the spin - spin interaction proposed by rujula , georgi and glashow back in 1975,@xcite whichwas a major advance beyond the naive quark model and it is presented in many textbooks . the spin - color or fermi - breit ( fb ) model,@xcite",
    "although it leads to the same massformulas for conventional hadrons and it is still phenomenological , incorporates the hypothesis of color . in paper of glozman and",
    "riska@xcite it was shown that spin - flavor hfi is suitable for light quarks .",
    "they analyze a baryon spectrum in terms of an su(3 ) flavor - symmetric quark - quark interaction that describes chiral pseudoscalar boson exchange . in this paper , the hyperfine interactions ( hfis ) between constituent quarks in mesons and baryons , including those with one @xmath0-quark , are used to investigate how their masses are affected by these interactions and to compare theoretically obtained masses with experimentally measured ones .",
    "the two types of interactions : fermi - breit(fb ) @xcite and glozman - riska ( gr)@xcite ( i.e. color - spin and flavor - spin ) are used to obtain meson and baryon mass formulas .",
    "then we compare our theoretical calculations with known masses of @xmath0-hadrons .",
    "detailed physical justification of the models is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "for example , the models are non - relativistic and they neglect the kinetic energy .",
    "nevertheless , they have several advantages , e.g. they are rather explicit since they yield elementary expressions for the hadron masses , they have few free parameters etc .",
    "any more realistic model necessarilly introduces additional parameters ; even the original rujula - georgi - glashow model contained additonal terms with respect to the fb and gr models used here ( see ref .   or formula ( 7.75 ) in ref .  ) .",
    "moreover , bound states in a realistic two - body potential can only be found numerically so the dependence of theoretical hadron masses on the parameters of the model is not as clear as in the simple models . a model with two additional free parameters",
    " given that few ( statistical ) degrees of freedom would be left  would have to give a very good fit to the observed hadron masses in order to be considered satisfactory .",
    "although fb and gr hfi are well known,@xcite we use these interactions for determining the constituent quark masses ( especially @xmath0 quark mass ) since we were able to find few papers where constituent @xmath0 quark mass is determined.@xcite also , our approach differs from the ones used in those papers .",
    "moreover , the ` consituent ' quark mass as used here is not exactly the same as the ` bottom @xmath1 ' mass often defined ( using bottomonium ) in such determinations , e.g. in ref .  .",
    "we also provide explicit mass formulas for hadrons containing @xmath0 quark using both hfis .    in this paper",
    "we make one of the first attempts to estimate uncertainties of the constituent quark masses .",
    "this estimation was partly motivated by the need to discern between the physically distinct fb and gr hfi because both had yielded satisfactory fits of the hadron masses in some cases.@xcite    one of our goals is to investigate the models that are simple enough to analyze the exotic hadron states  primarily the tetraquarks  because more elaborate models , having far less transparent dependence on model parameters , become quite difficult to analyze ( if not to compute ) in systems with several quark pairs .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] we present the two strong hyperfine interactions , then in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] we give their influence on hadron masses and derive formulas ; the method of our calculation of the constituent quark masses and the coupling constants ( least - square fit ) is given in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] , in sec .",
    "[ sec5 ] the different combinations of hadron mass equations are solved ( clustering of hadron groups ) , and in sec .",
    "[ sec6 ] we discuss the obtained results .",
    "we point out the main conclusions in sec .",
    "the main interaction which binds quarks into groups ( hadrons ) depends on the color and the spin . with no hyperfine interaction",
    "added , there would be degenerate hadrons with different spins . to avoid this spin degeneration ,",
    "hyperfine interaction is included and it depends , among other properties , on the spin too .    strong fermi - breit hyperfine interaction hamiltonian@xcite with su(3 ) flavor symmetry breaking is of the form : @xmath2    where @xmath3 are constituent masses of the interacting quarks , @xmath4 are the pauli spin matrices , @xmath5 are the color gell - mann matrices and @xmath6 is a constant . this interaction is also called color - spin interaction . as explained in the papers@xcite , fermi - breit interaction originates from one gluon exchange between two bodies , in analogy with the photon exchange between charged dirac particles .",
    "the fermi term of this interaction refers to hyperfine splitting of masses , i.e. it depends on inverse product of the quark masses , while breit interaction contains a part which is spin - dependent ( short range gluon interactions ) and another spin - independent part ( forces that keep @xmath7 pairs in color singlets ) . in the case of this interaction ,",
    "we neglect all other potentials in the system , and include only fermi - breit two particle interaction .",
    "the formulas derived from ( [ equ01 ] ) reduce to the simplified rujula - georgi - glashow model as the expectation values of the products @xmath8 can be absorbed into the hfi constants .",
    "however , the models are not equivalent ; not only does @xmath9 include the hypothesis of color explicitly , but it also leads to different mass formulas for exotic hadrons since the products @xmath8 are different for @xmath10 and @xmath11 pairs .",
    "strong glozman - riska hamiltonian@xcite is of the form : @xmath12    where @xmath13 are gell - mann matrices for flavor su(3 ) , @xmath14 are the pauli spin matrices and c@xmath15 is a constant .",
    "this is flavor - spin interaction .",
    "this interaction between constituent quarks describes pseudoscalar boson exchange , i.e. fine structure of the spectrum is based on the interaction mediated by the su(3)@xmath16 octet of pseudoscalar mesons , which are the goldstone bosons .",
    "we employ these schematic color - spin and flavor - spin interactions between quarks and antiquarks which lead to hyperfine interaction contributions to the meson and baryon masses .",
    "the schematic approximation means that we used two - particle interaction : in our calculation of hadron masses , we pay attention only to the short - range forces which arise from one - gluon exchange , i.e. the hadron masses are described in terms of two - body quark - quark forces .",
    "the contribution of hfi to hadron masses would be @xmath17 , where @xmath18 denotes the spin wave function and @xmath19 the flavor wave function while hfi is either fb or gr interaction . for total hadron masses @xmath20 we have @xmath21 , where @xmath22 are masses without influence of hfi",

    "15.4 of ref .  .",
    "the equations for hadron masses are linearized by expansion in taylor series ( up to the first order ) so we obtained the system of linear equations for differences between experimental and theoretical hadron masses .",
    "the unknown variables in these equations are corrections to the parameters ( i.e. corrections to the constituent quark masses and the constant of hyperfine interaction ) , which are obtained by linear least - square fitting .",
    "the uncertainties are estimated during the fitting procedure as square roots of the corresponding diagonal elements of covariance matrix , according to eq .",
    "( 15.4.15 ) of ref .  .",
    "the fitting is performed by minimizing @xmath106 between the theoretical and experimental hadron masses , according to the following procedure :    * first , initial values for the constituent quark masses are assumed and used to calculate the initial values of the theoretical masses of hadrons ( mesons and baryons ) , and @xmath106 between theoretical and experimental hadron masses ; * in the next iteration the corrections to the constituent quark masses and the constant of hyperfine interaction are obtained by least - square fitting , and used to obtain new values of the parameters by adding these corrections to the estimates from the previous iteration .",
    "the new values of the theoretical hadron masses are then obtained from these corrected parameters , as well as a new value of @xmath106 between theoretical and experimental hadron masses .",
    "we repeat this procedure until the fit converges , i.e. while @xmath106 decreases , and finally , * we choose the set of the constituent quark masses and the constant which gives the least @xmath106 .    assuming that the number of fitted hadrons ( mass equations ) is @xmath107 , and the number of unknown parameters ( constituent quark masses and the constant ) is @xmath108 , we used the following expression for reduced @xmath106 : @xmath109    with @xmath110 being the @xmath111-th difference between the measured and theoretical hadron masses , and @xmath4 the @xmath111-th standard deviation : @xmath112    where @xmath113 is an experimental standard deviation given by pdg,@xcite and @xmath114 is a theoretical standard deviation .",
    "we added @xmath114 in quadrature with the experimental errors to avoid having the fit to experiment arbitrarily dominated by the most accurate measurements ( ref .",
    ", see also ref .  ) .",
    "we took @xmath114 to be proportional to the experimental masses ( @xmath115 ) , and chose the constant of proportionality @xmath116 in such a way to yield the reduced @xmath106 as close as possible to 1 .    in brief",
    ", we fitted four parameters : @xmath117 , @xmath118 , @xmath119 , @xmath6 , so that the @xmath106 between measured and theoretical masses is minimized . as we mentioned in ref .",
    ", for every system of equations the fast convergence is achieved , even in the case when initial values of parameters differ much from their final values , which tells about goodness of our theoretical model and the fitting method .    in tables [ tab01 ] and [ tab02 ] we give the results from meson and baryon fits , when hfis are included",

    "the whole set of equations , used in the @xmath106-fitting method , has been divided into a certain number of subsets chosen in such a way to form a minimal system of equations which could be analytically solved .",
    "the mathematica 9.0 software has been used to solve these systems of equations for mesons and baryons .",

    "when three equations are chosen to form the system of equations , like for example equations for @xmath121 , @xmath122 and @xmath86 taken from eqs .",
    "( [ equ11 ] ) and ( [ equ12 ] ) , analytically one can get solutions in @xmath117 , @xmath118 and @xmath98 . in this analysis ,",
    "four systems of equations for mesons and four for baryons have been formed in the case of fb hfi .",
    "the same is done in the case of gr hfi , except for baryons where system of equations formed for @xmath123 , @xmath124 and @xmath125 did not give real solution .",
    "here , one should also notice that in the case of hadrons which contain @xmath0 quark , in order to solve equation it was necessary to include numerical value of @xmath126 previously obtained from systems of light hadrons . that value is obtained as a mean value of @xmath126 calculated separately for mesons and for baryons and for both fb and gr hfi .    as the result , the method described above forms clusters of @xmath127 points as can be seen in fig .  [ fig01 ] .",
    "this clustering shows the way how the constituent quark masses and the strength of the interaction constants appear in different environments : mesons - baryons , light hadrons - heavy hadrons within the two analyzed hyperfine interactions .",
    "the biggest formed clusters are those characterized by approximately the same quark mass for each of three different quark families ( @xmath60 , @xmath0 and @xmath128 ) but with different constants within the given type of interaction . here",
    ", one could note that points from both types of interactions belong to the same cluster for a given quark family .",
    "the only exceptions seen are green open circle and green open square extracted from baryonic equations for @xmath73 and @xmath82 and from equations for @xmath121 , @xmath122 and @xmath86 respectively which gives masses of @xmath60-quarks derived from gr hfi .",
    "the corresponding masses are shifted to the position which belongs to the @xmath128-quarks cluster . within these big clusters ,",
    "one can see smaller clusters which contain points obtained from mesons or from baryons . for the light quarks ,",
    "typically , mesonic clusters have smaller quark masses and bigger interaction constants with respect to baryonic clusters . concerning the masses ,",
    "this observation is clearly seen for the @xmath60-quarks , gets smaller for the @xmath128-quarks and nearly invisible for the @xmath0-quark . on the other hand ,",
    "the difference between the extracted interaction constant in mesonic and baryonic clusters gets slightly larger going from light to heavy quarks .",
    "a similar clustering can also be seen in the case of gr hfi .",
    "the different values of the extracted masses and interaction constants reflect the different enviroment  mesonic or baryonic  and the type of interaction .",
    "the experimental observation is that there are no free quarks but that they only exist bound in hadrons .",
    "this phenomenon is known as confinement .",
    "the constituent quark mass is the effective mass of a quark , which is only defined if the quark is confined and bound in the hadron .",
    "we calculate constituent quark masses using the improved fitting procedure@xcite of groups of mesons and baryons and using method of clustering of some hadron groups .",
    "we give mass formulas for hadrons containing @xmath0 quark using fb and gr hfi .",
    "we also calculate coupling constants of these interactions and showed that they are not equal but are of the same order of magnitude .",
    "we investigate how constituent quark masses , and coupling constants , depend on different hadron environment and how effective these two interactions are .",
    "the obtained results show that quark masses depend on the particular hadron model , and are different for two studied hfis . on average ,",
    "fb interaction gives much better fit : the uncertainties of the constituent quark masses are greater by an order of magnitude for gr hfi than for fb hfi in the case of mesons and by a factor of two in the case of baryons .",
    "we have to stress that fb interaction is working well for heavy - light mesons and baryons if they contain only one heavy quark , while gr hfi in some cases failed for heavy baryons .",
    "gr hfi also fails for @xmath50 meson .    just for comparison with the results from least - square fit , we also calculated clustering for some sets of equations and presented it in tables [ tab05 ] and [ tab06 ] and in fig .",
    "[ fig01 ] .",
    "figure shows masses of constituent quarks confined in different hadrons and the related constants : @xmath129-axes represents quark mass ( in mev ) and @xmath130-axes the hyperfine constant ( in mev@xmath131 ) . for light mesons ( systems ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) in table [ tab05 ] ) , as well as for heavy mesons ( systems ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) ) fb and gr give very similar results for constituent quark masses . for @xmath117 and @xmath118 in heavy meson systems we obtained larger values than in light mesons . for baryons",
    ", we can notice that in case of light baryons ( systems ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) in table [ tab06 ] ) fb and gr hfi results differ which is opposite from case of light mesons : gr interaction gives larger values for @xmath117 and @xmath118 than fb .",
    "when comparing heavy and light baryons ( systems ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) ) we have the greater value for @xmath98 in heavy baryons than in light baryons . in table",
    "[ tab06 ] , we do not have values for gr hfi for the fourth system , because physically realistic values could not be obtained when solving the equations .",
    "we can conclude that fb hfi is more accurate interaction than gr hfi .    according to the clustering procedure , both interactions fb and gr have a similar behavior , but in the case of heavy baryons fb hfi is better because gr hfi did not give good results in some cases ( i.e. system ( 4 ) in table [ tab06 ] ) . from this method",
    ", we can conclude that constituent quark masses are very sensitive to environment of different hadrons , as well as the values of constants .",
    "values of the constants are somewhat higher in hadrons which contain @xmath0-quarks .    in refs .",
    "it was shown that in the constituent quark model , the feynman - hellmann theorem and semi - empirical mass formulas can be applied to give useful information about the masses of mesons and baryons .",
    "we obtained that the feynman - hellmann theorem is working well in case of mesons and baryons with fb hfi , as well as with gr hfi .",
    "in order to determine the constituent quark masses we have used two methods : ( 1 ) least - square fits of both light and open - bottom heavy light hadrons , ( 2 ) clustering of hadron groups .",
    "we improved fitting procedure used in method ( 1).@xcite    in the previous work , least - square fit gave similar results for fb and gr hfi for light mesons.@xcite for heavy light hadrons studied in this paper , we find that fb hfi gives much better fits .",
    "this could have been expected given the su(3)@xmath16 nature of the gr hfi .",
    "more appropriate spin - flavor hfi for light heavy hadrons will be the subject of further investigation .",
    "the fb hfi gives reasonably good fits for all hadrons that we have considered  including the open bottom ones , especially when one takes into account the simplicity of the model .",
    "further improvements are likely to be achievable only in much more elaborate , multiparameter models .    we have confirmed that constituent quark mass depends on the type of the hadron where quarks are confined and on the particular hadron model . we show that , in general , quark mass has a larger value in baryons than in mesons .",
    "also , it depends on particular type of mesons and baryons , i.e. it is not the same in different mesons , but it is more similar than in baryons .",
