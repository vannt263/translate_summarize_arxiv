    "but then the coefficient of @xmath961 necessarily becomes negative , contradicting the definiteness .",
    "hence must be negative definite .",
    "hence we have @xmath962 . then looking the coefficient of the second square",

    "the region defined by is an ellipsoid , which we will denote by @xmath967 .",
    "although the region defined by is disconnected , it becomes connected by adding the last disc @xmath968 , and we will denote this connected region by @xmath969 .",
    "lemma [ lemma - hball ] says that the planes satisfying ( a ) and ( b ) are parameterized by the ellipsoid @xmath967 , for @xmath970 , and by the region @xmath969 for @xmath971 .",
    "if we think of the einstein - weyl space as the space of real hyperplane sections of the minitwistor space , these regions naturally appear for the two semi - free @xmath10-actions , rather than the upper - half space model , as long as we adopt the present coordinates . by (",
    "* theorem 2 ) , an einstein - weyl structure is naturally induced on these regions and it is precisely the hyperbolic structure . using this ,",
    "it is now easy to explicitly write down the three involutions @xmath972 and @xmath345 on the einstein - weyl space @xmath967 ( with respect to @xmath535 ) :    [ lemma - fl2 ] for @xmath973 , we have @xmath974 furthermore , the image of the two isolated fixed points of the @xmath275-action on @xmath339 ( the monopole points ) under the quotient map to @xmath967 are given by @xmath975 .",
    "the images of the two isolated fixed points of the @xmath274-action are given by @xmath976 .      since the @xmath274-action acts by isometries on @xmath967 , the fixed locus of @xmath274 must be a hyperbolic geodesic in @xmath967 .",

    "we first note that the involution @xmath27 induces a diffeomorphism from @xmath284 to itself . to see this , we argue as follows : in the @xmath630 matrix representation , the involution is off - diagonal type .",
    "the middle coordinates @xmath984 in section [ twistor ] can be regarded as a ( homogeneous ) coordinate on the quotient space @xmath985 , while @xmath284 is the space of maximal orbits in the quotient space @xmath986 . by the explicit form of the matrix @xmath27 and the @xmath512-action ( given in ) these involutions map @xmath987-orbits to @xmath987-orbits , which means that the involution is indeed a lift of some diffeomorphism of @xmath284 .    by (",
    "* theorem 9.1 ) , the induced involution on @xmath988 must be a hyperbolic isometry . to see this",

    "( it is possible to write the precise relation between these two coordinates ; but we do not need the explicit form ) . on the other hand ( * ? ? ? * theorem 9.1 ) states that the coordinate @xmath181 can be used as a conformal coordinate on @xmath284 .",
    "this means that any conformal automorphism of poon s metric on @xmath339 ( which is of course a special form of joyce metrics ) induces a conformal map on @xmath284 as long as the automorphism descends to a map on @xmath284 .",
    "since the conformal group of @xmath284 is equal to the isometry group , this implies the involution must be a hyperbolic isometry .",

    "the @xmath519-action on @xmath46 in naturally induces @xmath991-action on @xmath992 , which is explicitly written as @xmath993 this @xmath274-action naturally induces the ( dual ) action on the dual space @xmath994 . if @xmath995 means the dual coordinates as before , the action is concretely given by @xmath996 by putting @xmath997 and using @xmath998 as non - homogeneous coordinates , the action can be written as @xmath999 then recalling @xmath1000 and @xmath1001 on the real locus , we obtain that the @xmath274-action on @xmath967 is given by @xmath1002 then since this must be an isometric @xmath10-action on the hyperbolic space , and since any non - trivial isometric @xmath10-action must be rotations around a geodesic , means that @xmath1003 can be used as a coordinate on the hyperbolic space @xmath1004 .",
