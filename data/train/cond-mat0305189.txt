    "geometrically frustrated quantum magnets ( gfqm ) are a class of magnetic materials with various unusual properties at low temperatures .",
    "the combination of strong frustration and quantum effects makes them potentially a source of new strongly correlated physics .",
    "one common possible consequence of frustration is the macroscopically large degeneracy of the classical ground - states , which makes them very sensitive to even weak thermal and quantum fluctuations .",
    "for example , the phenomenon of order - from - disorder may occur : the fluctuations may lift the initial degeneracy and yield a symmetry broken ground - state .",
    "alternatively , the initial degeneracy may be completely lifted , in which case the result is a spin - liquid state . in the traditional point of view",
    ", the liquid state is a result of fluctuations strong enough to destroy the long - range order of the classical ground - state .",
    "however , in several gfqm , the starting classical ground - state is typically already disordered , so that the liquid state , eventually shaped by the fluctuations , may be of a different kind . in general , one can hope to find various exotic phenomena in these systems .",
    "the most studied gfqm are the kagome and pyrochlore lattices of antiferromagnetically coupled nearest neighbor spins .",
    "they belong to a class of lattices which are composed of corner - sharing units , where every unit is a small frustrated spin system , like a triangle .",
    "other examples include the triangular lattice frustrated by the higher order exchange processes , and the checkerboard lattice .",
    "this paper is concerned with the kagome lattice spin-@xmath0 heisenberg antiferromagnet ( see fig .  [ kdgrid ] ) .",
    "several groups have performed numerical calculations of spectra on finite clusters with up to 36 sites @xcite .",
    "the exact diagonalization @xcite showed that the ground - state of the 36-site kagome lattice has short - ranged spin - spin and some other correlations .",
    "the spin - gap is finite , and the extrapolation to the thermodynamic limit suggests that it remains finite in the infinite lattice .",
    "it is , however , small , estimated around @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the exchange coupling .",
    "remarkably however , at energies below the spin gap there appear to be a large number of _ singlet _ excitations .",
    "the origin and nature of these states is unclear ( see ref.@xcite for some interesting approaches ) .",
    "the number of these states is found to be an exponential function of the sample size : @xmath3 below the spin - gap , for even number of sites @xmath4 , and there is no clear gap that separates them from the ground - state .",
    "there are some indications that these low - energy singlet excitations may also occur in other frustrated quantum paramagnets .",
    "indeed , evidence for such excitations in the multiple - ring exchange triangular lattice spin-@xmath0 quantum antiferromagnet has been reported in ref .",
    "this led to a suggestion that there was a new spin liquid phase characterized by having gapless singlet excitations , which was named the type ii spin liquid in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "there also are interesting experimental results on @xmath5 ( or scgo , a bilayer spin-@xmath6 kagome magnet ) .",
    "absence of long - range order at low temperatures @xcite accompanied however by a large entropy of low - lying excitations @xcite has been reported .",
    "furthermore , the heat capacity is virtually independent of magnetic field , and is not thermally activated @xcite .",
    "these results suggest that the ground - state of scgo is not magnetically ordered , and that the low - energy sector of excited states contains a ( possibly gapless ) band of singlet excitations , while spinful excitations are separated from the ground - state by a finite spin - gap . despite the obvious differences between scgo and the theoretical model of a single spin-@xmath0 kagome layer , the similarities to the picture obtained from exact diagonalization of the latter are striking .",
    "( other unusual phenomena such as spin - glass like behavior in clean samples @xcite and its speculated coexistence with a spin - liquid component @xcite have also been suggested to happen in scgo ) .",
    "-2 mm    these unusual properties of the kagome heisenberg magnet have motivated various theoretical efforts , but our understanding of the underlying physics is still very incomplete .",
    "several controlled limits enable making some definite statements",
    ". one of them is the large-@xmath4 @xmath7 limit explored in @xcite which gives highly degenerate mean - field solutions , and a spin - peierls order as the @xmath8 correction .",
    "the ordered state maximizes the number of fluctuating benzene - like hexagonal clusters , where three singlet bonds sitting on a hexagonal plaquette oscillate between two possible configurations .",
    "however , it remained unknown whether this ordered state would survive higher - order corrections .",
    "another explored limit is the large-@xmath4 @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "this generalization of the spin-1/2 problem retains the `` spin - magnitude '' as an independent parameter . for large spins the ground - state possesses long - range magnetic order ( in a pattern dubbed the @xmath10 structure ) , and the elementary excitations are the spin waves associated with the broken spin rotational symmetry . for small spins , however , the ground - state does not break any symmetries , and the elementary spin carrying excitations are unconfined spin-1/2 bosonic spinons .    an alternative , less controlled , but perhaps more physical approach is to assume that the physics of the paramagnetic ground states of the kagome magnet is described well by the short - ranged valence bonds , which can then be roughly approximated by the quantum dimers on the kagome lattice .",
    "a quantum dimer model resulting from the overlap expansion of the valence - bond states was studied numerically by zeng and elser @xcite .",
    "misguich and colaborators have considered two simple dimer models : one at the rokhsar - kivelson point @xcite , and another offering more similarity to the overlap expansion ( different resonant loops appear with different signs ) @xcite .",
    "the former was exactly solved by mapping to the triangular lattice ising model , and both gave the dimer - liquid ground - states with large zero - temperature entropy . in a broader framework of frustrated quantum magnetism , moessner , sondhi , and various collaborators have studied various related problems on different lattices , and discussed connections between the dimer model and various gauge theories  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we undertake a set of calculations that could potentially provide considerable insight into the low energy singlet excitations of the kagome heisenberg antiferromagnet .",
    "it has been realized for some time @xcite that for a number of quantum antiferromagnets , the nature of the paramagnetic phases is closely related to ( and essentially determined by ) the properties of a much simpler model : the fully frustrated ising model in a transverse field on a lattice that is dual to that of the original spin system .",
    "this connection ( which we briefly review below ) may be established in a number of different approaches .",
    "one is through a slave particle theory of such quantum paramagnets .",
    "the theory of fluctuations about the mean field state in such slave particle theories is a gauge theory which for frustrated magnets @xcite is a 2 gauge theory .",
    "this is then related by duality to the transverse field ising model mentioned above .",
    "another connection is through the quantum dimer description of the paramagnetic phases of the original spin system . as explained in ref .",
    "@xcite , in appropriate limits , the quantum dimer model may be related to the fully frustrated transverse field ising model .",
    "the connection to the transverse field ising model is particularly useful for issues related to the low energy singlet excitations of frustrated quantum paramagnets .",
    "first , by construction , the ising model describes only the _ singlet _ sector of the original spin system , and is best to describe states below the spin gap .",
    "these are precisely the states one wishes to understand .",
    "second , one can exploit the relative simplicity of the ising model to perform calculations that would be extremely difficult for the original spin system .",
    "for instance , the ising model can be simulated by monte carlo without a sign problem , unlike the original frustrated spin model .",
    "this has been nicely demonstrated in the extensive work of moessner , sondhi , and coworkers @xcite on such ising models .",
    "it is therefore of extreme interest to study the particular ising model that one may guess describes the singlet sector of the kagome heisenberg antiferromagnet .",
    "this is a fully frustrated transverse - field ising magnet on the dual lattice ( known as the dice lattice ; see fig .",
    "[ kdgrid]b ) .",
    "this is an interesting model in itself , and appears not to have been examined before . as described in appendix [ lgap ] , a landau - ginzburg analysis ( which has been useful@xcite in analyzing analogous frustrated quantum ising magnets on other lattices ) shows an infinitely degenerate set of zero energy modes in the gaussian approximation .",
    "this renders the landau - ginzburg analysis less useful for this ising model . thus studying",
    "the fully frustrated quantum ising model may also contain lessons of its own for the theory of frustrated quantum systems .",
    "the questions of interest are the following : does this ising model have a zero temperature ordered phase ? we note that the combination of frustration and quantum effects could potentially completely destroy the ordered phase even at zero temperature ( as happens for instance for the transverse field ising antiferromagnet on the kagome lattice @xcite ) .",
    "generally , the ordered states of the ising model describe , in the original heisenberg spin problem , `` confined '' paramagnets where the spin carrying excitations are ( gapped ) spin-@xmath11 magnons .",
    "the disordered states of the ising model describe fractionalized paramagnets where there are ( gapped ) spin-@xmath0 spinons .",
    "whatever the phase diagram of the dice ising model , the nature of the excitations is an extremely appropriate question .",
    "indeed , if this ising model has a large number of low energy excitations , they would possibly correspond to the singlet excitations of the original kagome lattice heisenberg antiferromagnet .    in this paper , we first argue that the fully frustrated transverse - field ising model on the dice lattice supports ( at least ) two distinct phases . as usual , at large transverse fields ( section [ smallh ] ) there is a gapped ising paramagnet .",
    "however , its excitations are peculiar since they are either localized or extremely heavy . at small transverse fields ( section [ largeh ] ) there is also an ordered phase which breaks translational symmetry ( albeit in a rather complicated pattern with a large unit cell ) .",
    "the ordering pattern is best described in the language of the quantum dimer model on the kagome lattice to which the model is equivalent at small transverse fields : the dimers crystallize in a honeycomb structure of benzene - like resonating hexagons .",
    "the elementary excitations have a tendency to be localized ( large effective mass ) , and they have a non - zero finite gap which nevertheless is very small compared to the natural energy scales of the model .",
    "we suggest that this phase is what is actually realized in the original kagome heisenberg magnet ( see fig .",
    "[ dimergnd ] ) , and not a gapless spin - liquid .",
    "we argue that properties of this phase are consistent with results from the numerical studies , which in turn may suffer from serious finite - size effects .",
    "this then provides a qualitative picture of the singlet physics below the spin - gap observed by the exact diagonalization .",
    "we also performed a simple monte - carlo simulation ( section [ mc ] ) to show that the thermal fluctuations do not introduce order from disorder , and do not select the honeycomb structure out of many classically degenerate dimer coverings . in the appendices we provide a discussion of various peripheral matters and details of some calculations .",
    "description of the suggested ground - state of the kagome quantum antiferromagnet .",
    "dimers formally represent the frustrated bonds of the dual dice - lattice ising model , but physically they represent singlet valence bonds .",
    "the translational symmetry is broken by a unit - cell with 36 sites .",
    "dimers on the shaded hexagonal plaquettes resonate between the two possible configurations on the hexagon .",
    "also , the six dimers around the central plaquette of every honeycomb cell resonate in a _",
    "star _ shaped configuration .",
    "the lowest lying excitations are various excited states of the _ stars_.,width=201 ]",
    "we will try to understand the low - energy physics of the heisenberg model on the kagome lattice : @xmath12 where the sum runs over the nearest - neighbor sites . from the numerical exact diagonalization calculations we know that the ground state has no magnetic long range order .",
    "there is a non - zero gap for spin - carrying excitations .",
    "we will therefore focus on possible non - magnetically ordered phases of the model .",
    "a number of different arguments may be provided to relate the properties of such phases to those of the fully frustrated transverse field ising model on the dice lattice .",
    "the quantum dimer model is a popular way to capture some essential physics of quantum paramagnetic ground states of spin systems .",
    "moessner and sondhi  @xcite have established a connection between the standard hard - core dimer model , and the fully frustrated ising model in a ( small ) transverse field on the dual lattice .",
    "the connection is made by noting that in zero transverse field , the ground states of the classical fully frustrated ising model are ( up to a global spin flip ) in one - to - one correspondence with hard - core dimer coverings of the dual lattice .",
    "a small transverse field essentially introduces quantum resonances between dimer configurations , leading to the quantum dimer model .",
    "a closely related earlier approach is through a slave particle mean field theory of the quantum paramagnetic phases of the heisenberg model . as argued in ref .",
    "@xcite , for frustrated lattices the theory of fluctuations about the mean field theory is a 2 gauge theory , where the gauge fields live on the links of the original ( kagome ) lattice . for spin-@xmath0 systems , this gauge theory has non - trivial berry phase terms ( and was hence dubbed the `` odd '' 2 gauge theory in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . under a duality transformation , this odd 2 gauge theory maps onto the fully frustrated ising model in a transverse field on the dual ( dice ) lattice .",
    "finally , as discussed in @xcite , it is possible to directly formulate the heisenberg spin model on any lattice as a theory of fermionic spinons coupled to an odd 2 gauge theory . in the spin - gapped quantum paramagnetic phases , the spinon fields",
    "may formally be integrated out , leaving a pure odd 2 gauge theory as a description of physics below the spin gap . by the duality transformation alluded to above , one again obtains the fully frustrated transverse - field ising model on the dual lattice .",
    "this approach gives a new flavor to it : the lattice does not have to be bipartite , and there is no need to rely on the dimer model from the beginning .",
    "we present a formal derivation and analysis in appendix [ z2ap ] . a rough formal estimate for the relative importance of various coupling constants",
    "is also provided .    with these motivations , the starting point of this paper",
    "is the following frustrated ising model in transverse field : @xmath13 this hamiltonian is defined on the dice lattice , dual to kagome , and the frustration is realized through the @xmath14 factors , satisfying on each plaquette the following relation : @xmath15 the dice lattice , and a possible choice for @xmath16 are shown in the fig .",
    "[ kdgrid]b .",
    "the @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 operators are the pauli matrices of the fluctuating 2 vortex field which corresponds to the singlet degrees of freedom . from now on we will drop all terms denoted by the ellipses , and keep only the lowest order ones involving the isolated 3-coordinated sites @xmath20 , 6-coordinated sites @xmath21 , and the pairs of next - nearest - neighbor 3-coordinated sites @xmath22 .",
    "this theory is an effective theory of the kagome heisenberg magnet , describing the physics below the spin - gap .",
    "in the rest of the paper we study the properties of this model in different parameter regimes .",
    "as we formally argue in appendix [ z2ap ] , when obtained from the original heisenberg model , it is natural to consider the limit of large @xmath23 .",
    "this is also supported by comparison with the results of the numerical studies .",
    "nevertheless we will study the model more generally and not just in the large-@xmath24 limit .",
    "here we analyze the properties of the ground - state and excitation spectrum of the frustrated ising model given by the hamiltonian  ( [ i d ] ) in the @xmath25 limit .",
    "we will build the perturbative expansion for the exact low - energy effective theory .",
    "the unperturbed hamiltonian , with all @xmath26 equal to zero , is a classical ising model on the fully frustrated dice lattice , and every spin configuration is an eigenstate .",
    "the ground - states have the minimal number of frustrated bonds ( the bonds with positive energy : @xmath27 ) . in trying to construct them",
    ", we have to leave at least one bond frustrated on every plaquette : otherwise , the product of four bond energies around a plaquette could not be negative , as required by the frustration condition  ( [ frust ] ) .",
    "it is convenient to return to a dimer representation of these states on the original kagome lattice : we put a dimer on every kagome bond which intersects a frustrated dice bond .",
    "this representation is accurate up to global spin flip of the ising spins .",
    "there will be an odd number of dimers emanating from every kagome site , and the ground - states will be given by the various hard - core dimer coverings .",
    "the perturbations @xmath26 introduce quantum fluctuations between different dimer coverings , and lift degeneracy of the unperturbed ground - states .",
    "the effect of a @xmath28 operator in the dimer picture is to toggle the dimer occupancy on all bonds of the kagome plaquette which corresponds to the dice site @xmath29 .",
    "since we want to construct the effective theory , we need to find the combinations of @xmath28 operators which transform one hard - core dimer covering into another , possibly through some virtual states .",
    "such processes can be described as dimer motion along the _ flippable _ loops , and we will call them the _ loop flips _ ( see fig .",
    "[ flloops0 ] for explanation ) .",
    "it is convenient to introduce the following terminology : if a plaquette carries no dimers on its bonds , we will call it a _ defect _ plaquette , and if it carries a flippable loop on its bonds , we will call it a _ perfect _ plaquette",
    ". a plaquette can be perfect only if it has an even number of bonds . of special interest",
    "are the elementary flippable loops which enclose only one hexagonal plaquette , and they are explained in table [ flloops ] .",
    ".[flloops]the elementary flippable loops : ( a ) flippable hexagon , ( b ) flippable 8-bond loops ( rhombus , arrow and trapeze , from left to right ) , ( c ) the star , ( d ) flippable 10-bond loops .",
    "the elementary flippable loops by definition enclose only one hexagon . for arbitrary dimer covering ,",
    "a unique elementary flippable loop can be found on every hosting hexagonal plaquette : it goes through all the hexagon sites , and includes those surrounding triangles which hold a dimer on a bond that does not belong to the hexagon .",
    "the hexagon in ( a ) is _ perfect _ , while the hexagon in ( c ) is a _ defect _ hexagon .",
    "the length of the elementary loop is directly related to the number of dimers sitting on the hexagon , which is equal to the number of _ defect _ triangles around the hexagon : 3 in ( a ) , 2 in ( b ) , 1 in ( d ) , and none in ( c ) .

    "the quantum fluctuations created by the kinetic term yield the ground states in which the number of resonating perfect hexagons is maximized .",
    "this is an exact statement , since all perfect hexagon flips commute with one another : as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ uwcommute ] , the perfect hexagons can never be nearest neighbors , and therefore can not affect one another . in order to gain more insight about these states ,",
    "we want to recall some observations from references @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the total number of dimers in a hard - core dimer covering on the kagome lattice is @xmath35 , and the number of triangular plaquettes is @xmath36 , so that @xmath37 .",
    "since a triangle can carry at most one dimer , we see that one quarter of all triangles are the _ defects _ in any hard - core dimer covering : @xmath38 .",
    "next , we note that every perfect hexagon has exactly three neighboring _ defect _ triangles , and since no two perfect hexagons can be neighbors , those defect triangles are not shared between them .",
    "it follows from this that the total number of perfect hexagons has an upper bound : @xmath39 .",
    "the maximum possible density of perfect hexagons is one per six hexagonal plaquettes , and it can be achieved in a variety of ways . in fig .",
    "[ honeystripe ] we show two characteristic possibilities , ( a ) the _ honeycomb _ , and ( b ) the _ stripe _ state . in general , these states are constructed by placing the perfect hexagons as close as possible to each other .",
    "the closest they can be is the next nearest neighbors , provided that between them is another hexagonal plaquette , and not a bowtie pair of triangles ( @xmath40 ) , because in the latter case there would have been a site ( the center of the bowtie ) involved in no dimers .",
    "this rule allows one to arrange perfect hexagons in strings which may be straight , bent at an angle of @xmath41 , or forked into two new strings at the @xmath41 angles .",
    "the _ stripe _",

    "if we look at the elementary flippable loops realized on the various hexagonal plaquettes in fig .",
    "[ honeystripe ] , we observe that between every two closest perfect hexagons there is an 8-bond flippable loop , right on the sides of the strings there are only 10-bond flippable loops , and in the case of the _ honeycomb _ state , there is a 12-bond _ star_-shaped flippable loop sitting at the center of every honeycomb cell .",

    "if the lattice becomes finite , this remaining degeneracy will be lifted , and no symmetry will be spontaneously broken .",
    "let us apply the perturbation theory developed in this section to a finite sample with @xmath4 sites .",
    "the 12-fold degenerate ground ( and excited ) states , shaped at the low orders , can be eventually mixed only by high order perturbations , which are essentially just translations . in the dimer language , they correspond to dimer flips on large flippable loops which enclose a finite fraction of all plaquettes of the sample",
    ". therefore , their order scales as @xmath4 , and the energy scale associated with them is exponentially small .",
    "this is enough to completely mix the states with the same energy , but there will be no mixtures of the states with different energies . as a consequence , the spectrum of the finite system will be very similar to that of the infinite system , and just slightly more dispersed .",

    "it takes enclosing at least @xmath77 plaquettes by the translational flippable loops , so that the translational degeneracy is lifted at @xmath78 order .",
    "the exact count of the lowest lying excitations depends on the boundary conditions , but we can still demonstrate that this number is not small .",

    "some basic excited states can be obtained by exciting the star and two perfect hexagons in various combinations ( @xmath79 total , including the ground - state ) , and each is 12-fold `` degenerate '' in the thermodynamic limit .",

    "if @xmath24 vanishes , then all ising spins in  ( [ i d ] ) are aligned with the transverse fields in the @xmath84-direction , making the ground - state completely disordered and uncorrelated in terms of @xmath85 .",
    "an elementary excitation is created when one spin is flipped against the transverse field .",
    "these excitations are 2 vortices , or visons according to  ( [ visonx ] ) , and they are localized and gapped . for finite @xmath24 , the visons can in principle hop between sites and lower their gap by acquiring kinetic energy . however , for small @xmath24 the gap is guarantied to persist , and the ground - state remains disordered , and unique .    in the following",
    "we will assume that @xmath30 and @xmath42 are positive , and we will ignore @xmath31 and other terms for simplicity .",
    "one way to study the properties of the excited states is to consider perturbatively the effective theory for one vison . at the lowest order ,",

    "we try to find an answer by considering the time - ordered green s function in the interaction picture : @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the time - ordering operator , and : @xmath92 @xmath93 the perturbation @xmath94 is the vison - hopping part of  ( [ i d ] ) , while @xmath95 is the vison potential energy .",

    "an example of such a path which appears at the @xmath113 order of the perturbation theory is shown in the fig .",
    "[ dicepaths]d .",
    "the complex paths between the sites further away than the next - nearest - neighbors appear only above the @xmath114 order , so that below this order the green s function between distant sites ( and arbitrary times ) strictly vanishes , and the visons appear strictly localized .    at present",

    "if not , they would have an extremely large inertia in the small-@xmath24 limit , and this would be a novel mechanism for creation of the large quasi - particle effective mass .",
    "the possibility of vison localization is also hinted by the monte carlo calculations presented in the section [ mc ] .",
    "namely , the spatial vison - vison correlations effectively vanish at separations beyond the next - nearest neighbors .",

    "@xcite the vison correlations are short - ranged , but they exhibit a clear exponential decay over a significant range of separations .    finally , we note that the phase obtained here is also the unconfined phase .",

    "in order to gain some more insight into the frustrated transverse field ising model , we attempted to study it numerically using the classical monte carlo technique .",
    "the quantum ising model  ( [ i d ] ) translates to the 3-dimensional classical ising model on the time - stacked dice - lattice layers : the corresponding boltzmann weights are all positive and hence the model can be simulated by monte carlo without a sign problem .",
    "we reliably measured the spin - spin correlations in the disordered phase , and answered the question of whether the thermal fluctuations alone can yield order - from - disorder like the quantum fluctuations .",
    "however , we could not truly explore the complete phase diagram and the nature of the phase transition with this simple classical technique ; for those purposes , a more sophisticated monte carlo technique is needed .",

    "our present method was not able to establish whether the crossover line between these two regimes is actually a phase transition line or not . however , based on our analytical study we expect that this is the phase transition .",
    "since large coupling constants yield the dimerized regime in which all dimer coverings have the same action , the remaining phase properties can be decided only by entropy , which is a manifestation of quantum fluctuations . in the ising language ,",
    "once the action is fixed to its lowest value , the maximum entropy state has the largest number of _ flippable _ clusters of spins ( free to fluctuate without changing the action ) . in the dimer language",

    "once their number is maximized by the entropy , the only other elementary flippable loops which could possibly resonate without action cost are the _ stars _ , and to maximize their number , the perfect hexagons must arrange in the _ honeycomb _ pattern .",
    "unfortunately , our simulation could not reach equilibrium in this regime , at least due to very slow dynamics at large coupling constants .",
    "since the quantum fluctuations are capable of producing the order - from - disorder , it is natural to ask whether the thermal fluctuations are capable too .",
    "if we set the transverse field couplings in  ( [ i d ] ) to zero , we obtain the classical two - dimensional ising model on the fully frustrated dice lattice . in this case",
    ", the monte carlo easily reveals that there are no phase transitions , measured through the `` heat capacity '' , and the model is always in its disordered phase .",
    "therefore , the thermal fluctuations alone can not introduce a long - range order , even when @xmath123 becomes large and the `` dimerized '' regime occurs .",

    "the analysis in the preceding sections has established some properties of the fully frustrated transverse field ising model on the dice lattice . specifically , we analyzed the two limits of small and large transverse fields @xmath26 in  ( [ i d ] ) , and described the two distinct phases that obtain in those limits . in this section",
    ", we consider the lessons for the original kagome heisenberg magnet .",
    "the disordered phase of the ising model ( @xmath127 ) has a unique ground - state and a clear gap in its spectrum .",
    "this will describe spin liquid phases of the original kagome magnet . on the other hand ,",
    "the _ honeycomb _ dimer phase ( @xmath128 ) breaks translational symmetry , but with a very large unit cell .",
    "this phase has a number of interesting properties .",
    "first it clearly describes a valence bond crystal phase of the original kagome magnet with a large unit cell .",
    "the spinful excitations will be gapped spin-@xmath11 magnons",
    ". however , below the spin gap this state has a large number of low - energy excitations with a very small but non - zero gap .",
    "the number of low - lying excitations that we can account for is exponential in the system size .",
    "however , their exact number below the spin - gap is hard to estimate in our approach .",
    "the numerical calculations @xcite on the kagome heisenberg magnet revealed a large number of seemingly gapless singlet excitations in the 36-site sample of the kagome quantum magnet , and a finite - size scaling analysis suggested that in the thermodynamic limit the spectrum could be gapless .",
    "we suggest that the actual ground state in the thermodynamic limit displays the honeycomb dimer ordering present in the dual ising model at small transverse fields .",
    "at the end of section [ largeh ] we argued that our suggestion is consistent with the numerical data .",
    "this ground - state breaks translational symmetry with a unit - cell containing 36 sites , while 36 sites was the largest sample size that could be studied by the exact diagonalizations so far .",
    "therefore , the numerics might suffer from some serious finite - size effects .",
    "in particular , the large unit - cell dimer ordering , if it exists , will be missed in the current numerical calculations , as well as the spinon confinement into magnons . however , some gross features of the low - lying spectrum , namely the presence of a large number of singlet excitations below the spin - gap , are not too sensitive to the finite sample sizes used in the numerical studies .",
    "( whether or not these singlet excitations have a true gap or are gapless in the thermodynamic limit is of course more sensitive to finite size ) .",
    "we emphasize that the specific valence bond crystal state proposed in this paper is in a confined phase where there are no spinon excitations .",
    "this is in contrast to naive expectations based on the apparent translation symmetric ground state obtained in the numerical calculations .",
    "quite generally , we expect that analysis similar to that presented in this paper is applicable to a variety of spin models in paramagnetic phases .",
    "these include the checkerboard lattice , and various other lattices frustrated by the next - nearest neighbor exchange .",
    "then , if we were to generalize our hypothesis to other models with near neighbor exchange interactions , we would expect that the @xmath128 limit always describes the effective theory for singlet excitations .",
    "this theory is a quantum dimer model dominated by the kinetic energy .",
    "a naive guess for the ground - state is that the smallest resonating flippable loops assume the maximum possible density , typically leading to a",
    "_ long range order . indeed ,",
    "such _ plaquette _",
    "phases have been observed in the heisenberg model on the checkerboard lattice @xcite , and the phase diagrams of the quantum dimer model on the square @xcite , and honeycomb @xcite lattices , while a dimer rvb phase was found on the triangular lattice @xcite . in this paper",
    "we demonstrated analytically a plaquette phase in the kagome lattice heisenberg model .",
    "the peculiarity of the kagome lattice is that the maximum density of smallest resonating flippable loops is not sufficient to lift the macroscopic degeneracy of the ground - states .",
    "this is why the singlet gap is extremely small . in other lattices , the checkerboard for example ,",
    "the degeneracy is easily lifted , and the singlet gap is fairly significant .",
    "one of the remaining fundamental questions is whether the spin - liquids with gapless singlet excitations ( type ii ) really exist in the quantum spin models , as suggested in the ref .",
    "@xcite . the only known examples which numerically exhibit such properties are the kagome lattice heisenberg model @xcite , and the triangular lattice antiferromagnet with ring - exchange @xcite . in the latter case ,",
    "a small ring - exchange coupling destroys the neel - order and creates a spin - liquid , while at a slightly larger coupling a singlet - gap is gradually opened .",
    "armed with our experience on the kagome lattice , we speculate that the case of the triangular lattice is also not a type ii spin - liquid with gapless singlet states .",
    "probably this phase will not be found in other quantum spin models either .",
    "another interesting feature that emerged from our calculations is a rather small ( possibly zero ) dispersion of the excitations in either phase on the dice lattice .",
    "the elementary excitations of both the ordered and disordered phases appear dispersionless at least to the sixth order of perturbation theory .",
    "although at present we do nt know whether this persists to all orders , we speculate that it might be the case , at least in the disordered phase . indeed , a simple gaussian landau - ginzburg analysis gives a dispersionless spectrum . in the appendix [ lgap ] we study the @xmath129 generalization of the ising model on the fully frustrated dice lattice , and recover a dispersionless spectrum in the large-@xmath4 limit .",
    "in addition , we show that in this approximation , the model is always in the paramagnetic phase .",
    "it is clear that both the landau - ginzburg approach and the large-@xmath4 approximation have fundamental limitations in this problem .",
    "as we have argued , the correct phase diagram includes an ordered phase , albeit of a somewhat unconventional kind .",
    "in this paper we have studied various aspects of the fully frustrated transverse field ising model on a dice lattice .",
    "this model is useful as a description of the physics of singlet excitations below the spin gap of the quantum kagome heisenberg antiferromagnet .",
    "we argued that this transverse field ising model supports at least two quantum phases : a _ plaquette _ phase where the ground state breaks both global spin flip and translational symmetries , and a disordered phase with short - ranged ( ising ) spin correlations . in terms of the original kagome heisenberg magnet ,",
    "the former describes a state with a _",
    "honeycomb _ pattern of resonating benzene - like arrangements of singlet bonds on the hexagonal plaquettes , with a 36-site unit - cell .",
    "the elementary singlet excitations are gapped with a very small gap and localized inside the cells of the honeycomb structure . based on comparison with the numerical studies",
    ", we suggested that this specific large - unit - cell valence bond crystalline order describes the ground state of the kagome heisenberg quantum magnet .",
    "the elementary spin - carrying excitations are gapped spin-@xmath11 magnons .",
    "we hope that our work stimulates attempts to look for this ordering pattern in future studies of the kagome magnet .",
    "in addition , we argued that due to frustration and unusual geometry the fully frustrated dice lattice transverse field ising model possesses a strong tendency to localize its elementary excitations : they are either completely localized , or they have an extremely large effective mass ( narrow energy bands ) .",

    "here we briefly derive a representation of the kagome heisenberg quantum magnet as a 2 gauge theory . for more in - depth discussion , see references @xcite .",
    "our starting point is the heisenberg model on the kagome lattice : @xmath12 where the sum runs over the nearest - neighbor sites .",
    "the heisenberg model can be viewed as a special limit of another model .",
    "consider a theory of hopping spinons @xmath130 coupled to the 2 gauge field @xmath131 which lives on the bonds of the kagome lattice : @xmath132\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the spinon operators obey fermion anticommutation relations , and the gauge - field operators are pauli matrices .",
    "this theory possesses a local 2 gauge symmetry : if the signs of @xmath130 at a particular site @xmath133 and @xmath134 on all bonds emanating from that site are simultaneously changed , the hamiltonian  ( [ szk ] ) remains invariant .",
    "the appearance of the local symmetry means that the hilbert phase is larger than that of the heisenberg model , and a constraint per site is needed to project back to the physical hilbert space .",
    "this is achieved through a gauge requirement on the physical states : @xmath135 the operators @xmath136 are generators of the local gauge transformations at sites @xmath133 , and the product is over all bonds @xmath137 emanating from the site @xmath133 . in the @xmath138 limit of  ( [ szk ] ) ,",
    "all gauge spins tend to align in the x - direction , so that the gauge requirement  ( [ physgauge ] ) fixes the number of spinons to be one - per - site .",
    "the spinon gauge theory  ( [ szk ] ) then reduces to the heisenberg model at the second order of perturbation theory , with @xmath139 .",
    "the next step assumes that the spin - carrying excitations in the original heisenberg model are gapped .",
    "we rely on the experimental and numerical studies which show such a gap in the spectrum of the kagome magnet .",
    "thus , the spinon degrees of freedom can be `` integrated - out '' in  ( [ szk ] ) , leaving behind a pure @xmath140 effective gauge theory with local terms ( we will come back to this step later ) : @xmath141 the terms involving @xmath142 operators are the sums over all plaquette products .",
    "the elementary plaquettes appear at the lowest order , but in principle , all connected clusters of bond - loops can appear at higher orders .",
    "this form of the effective hamiltonian is required by the 2 gauge symmetry : the sign change of @xmath134 on all bonds emanating from any site @xmath133 must leave the hamiltonian invariant .",
    "the spin - gap results with a local and perturbative nature of  ( [ zk ] ) : the coupling constants @xmath26 of the @xmath45-bond clusters are of the order of @xmath143 , where @xmath144 is some energy scale , and @xmath145 .",
    "the spinon `` integration '' also modifies the gauge requirement  ( [ physgauge ] ) to : @xmath146 the expressions  ( [ zk ] ) and  ( [ physgaugez ] ) define a pure 2 gauge theory on the kagome lattice .",
    "we now express this theory in its dual form .",
    "let @xmath147 be the pauli operators defined on the sites of the lattice dual to kagome , the dice lattice .",
    "their relation to the 2 gauge field of the kagome lattice is the following : @xmath148 in  ( [ visonz ] ) the dual dice bond @xmath149 intersects the kagome bond @xmath150 , while in  ( [ visonx ] ) the dual dice site @xmath29 sits inside the kagome elementary plaquette appearing in the product on the left - hand side .",
    "the numbers @xmath16 are fixed to @xmath151 and @xmath152 in such a way that on every dice elementary plaquette the condition of full frustration holds : @xmath153 this is the consequence of the gauge requirement  ( [ physgaugez ] ) .",
    "one choice of sign - arrangement for @xmath16 is depicted in fig .",
    "[ kdgrid ] .",
    "the pure 2 gauge theory  ( [ zk ] ) can now be rewritten as the transverse field quantum ising model on the fully frustrated dice lattice : @xmath154 the `` kinetic energy '' terms contain in general the products of @xmath28 on various clusters of the dice lattice sites .",
    "the hamiltonian  ( [ id2 ] ) captures only the form of the effective theory below the spin gap .",
    "the coupling constants are not known , because the path - integration of spinons in  ( [ szk ] ) can not be carried out analytically .",
    "however , we can at least attempt to estimate their relative values . for these purposes ,",
    "we express the original heisenberg model in the slave - particle path - integral , as it was done in the reference @xcite .",
    "the action involves the spinon grassmann field @xmath130 living on the sites @xmath133 of the ( 2 + 1)d lattice , and the gauge ising - like field @xmath155 living on the lattice bonds : @xmath156 -    \\sum_i \\overline{f}_{\\alpha i}f_{\\alpha i } + s_b \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the berry s phase @xmath157 , realizing the projection to the physical hilbert space , is given by : @xmath158 the action  ( [ z2action ] ) is an exact rewriting of the heisenberg model in the limit @xmath159 @xcite .",
    "we obtain it upon integrating out @xmath155 , and @xmath160 , where @xmath161 is the imaginary - time lattice spacing used in the path - integral ( of the heisenberg model ) .",
    "we can relate the action coupling constants @xmath162 and @xmath163 to the hamiltonian  ( [ szk ] ) coupling constants , @xmath164 and @xmath165 . in order to simplify notation , from now on we will use one symbol @xmath166 to represent all the couplings in the action , and @xmath167 for all the couplings in the hamiltonian .",
    "the connection is : @xmath168 where @xmath169 .",
    "now we integrate out the spinon field , and obtain a pure 2 gauge theory with the action : @xmath170 the matrix @xmath171 above is the matrix which couples the spinons in  ( [ z2action ] ) . in the expanded form ,",
    "this action must contain various gauge - invariant products of @xmath155 on the closed loops , with the loop - dependent coupling constants @xmath172 .",
    "the very assumption that this expansion is possible and convergent is an essential one , and it requires a large spin - gap ( of the order of @xmath2 ) , determined at a microscopic scale .",
    "a large spin - gap guaranties that the effective theory will have only local terms , and significance of various closed loops in  ( [ purez2action ] ) will rapidly decrease with increasing loop size , making the expansion convergent . at this point we are not providing any formal estimate of the spin - gap .",
    "we simply use some external sources to obtain information about it , for example the numerics .",
    "using the fact that a @xmath155 factor always comes together with a @xmath162 factor in  ( [ z2action ] ) , we can make an estimate for the coupling constants @xmath172 ( to the lowest order ) : @xmath173 and this implies that @xmath172 can be treated as small numbers , scaling as @xmath174 with @xmath45 being the number of spatial links in the loop . in order to formally derive the connection between this action and the hamiltonians  ( [ zk ] ) and  ( [ id2 ] )",
    ", we neglect at this point all the higher order loop terms ( enclosing more than one elementary plaquette ) .",
    "if the action contains only the elementary plaquettes , we can readily construct the _ dual _ theory , as outlined in @xcite .",
    "it takes the form of the ising model on the fully frustrated dual lattice : @xmath175 the ising gauge - field @xmath16 living on the links of the dual lattice is _ frozen _ such that its product over any dual elementary plaquette is @xmath152 .",
    "the only fluctuating field is the vison ising field @xmath176 .",
    "the duality transformation establishes connection between the coupling constants @xmath172 defined for a plaquette and @xmath177 defined for the dual bond piercing that plaquette : @xmath178 for simplicity , assume that there is only one kind of elementary plaquettes .",
    "then , the hamiltonian describing the dual theory has the form : @xmath179 the connection between the action  ( [ dualaction ] ) and hamiltonian above is : @xmath180 now we can estimate the values of the hamiltonian coupling constants .",
    "the temporal elementary plaquettes always have 4 bonds ( two spatial and two temporal ) , while we assume that the spatial elementary plaquettes have @xmath45 bonds .",
    "it follows that : @xmath181 @xmath182 \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] taking the ratio of  ( [ kdt ] ) and  ( [ hdt ] ) , and noting that the heisenberg model exchange coupling is @xmath183 , we obtain : @xmath184 the energy scale of @xmath2 is also a measure of the spin - gap . since the spinons have to be integrated out , the starting path - integral must accurately represent the energy scales above the spin - gap .",
    "the energy cut - off must be much larger than the spin - gap , and hence @xmath185 .",
    "this is also compatible with request @xmath159 , needed for the path - integral with action  ( [ z2action ] ) to reduce to the heisenberg model .",
    "consequently , @xmath186 ( for arbitrary @xmath187 ) .",
    "this simple analysis suggests that the large-@xmath24 limit of  ( [ id2 ] ) is a good effective theory for the singlet physics below the spin - gap .",
    "it also seems natural to expect from  ( [ koverh ] ) that the higher - order loop terms , present in the more accurate effective hamiltonian , have the coupling constants @xmath26 which decay with the loop length @xmath45 as @xmath188 , where @xmath189 .    and",
    "finally , we can ask whether this approach is useful for extensions of the heisenberg model .",
    "the next - nearest and further neighbor exchange interactions are reflected in the action  ( [ z2action ] ) as additional spinon hopping and pairing terms mediated by the 2 gauge field .",
    "the spinons can still be integrated out ( provided that there is a large spin - gap ) , and the pure 2 gauge theory  ( [ purez2action ] ) would effectively live on the more complicated lattice which has bonds between all pairs of sites that host an exchange coupling",
    ". the dual theory would , in general , be more complicated than the frustrated ising model ( the effective lattice may not even be planar ) , but we could still write an effective hamiltonian like  ( [ zk ] ) together with the gauge condition  ( [ physgaugez ] ) , and expect a large-@xmath24 limit to be realized . similarly , the ring exchange interactions can be implemented in the action  ( [ z2action ] ) by explicitly adding the loop products of the gauge field to it .",
    "this would yield larger values for the loop couplings @xmath26 in the pure 2 gauge theory , possibly making them comparable with @xmath24 .",
    "having in mind the results of this paper in the small-@xmath24 limit , this hints that the multiple - spin exchange is a good candidate to yield truly fractionalized spin liquids .",
    "a relatively simple way to gain some first intuition for the quantum ising model on the frustrated dice lattice  ( [ i d ] ) is to generalize it to a limit where the semiclassical approximations become exact .",
    "consider the @xmath129 generalization of spins in the large-@xmath4 limit .",
    "we will demonstrate that this gaussian theory has a dispersionless spectrum , and supports only a disordered phase for all values of the coupling constants .",
    "we write the imaginary time path - integral and impose the spin - magnitude constraint using a field @xmath190 of lagrange multipliers .",
    "the action obtained from  ( [ i d ] ) by keeping only the elementary transverse field terms is : @xmath191 in the saddle - point approximation , the lagrange multiplier field @xmath190 becomes `` homogeneous '' , with only two independent values @xmath192 and @xmath193 corresponding to the 3 and 6-coordinated sites .",
    "this is the consequence of the 2 gauge - invariance , namely the arbitrariness of the choice of @xmath16 , subject to the condition  ( [ frust ] ) . if @xmath16 are chosen to be negative on the thick bonds in the fig .",

    "these requirements are satisfied if : @xmath206 the failure to satisfy these conditions by the saddle - point values of @xmath207 and @xmath208 would signify an instability .",
    "now we vary @xmath203 and @xmath204 to find the minimal action , integrate out the frequency , and obtain the following saddle - point equations : @xmath209 where : @xmath210 the conditions  ( [ conv ] ) directly translate to @xmath211 .",
    "the saddle - point equations are too complicated to be solved exactly . if the solution that meets the conditions  ( [ conv ] ) exists for every finite non - zero @xmath30 , @xmath42 , and @xmath24 , then the system is always in the paramagnetic phase . in order to prove that such solutions always exist",
