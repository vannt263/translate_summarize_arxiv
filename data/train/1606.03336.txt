    "many of the phenomena that arise in the real world can be described by means of nonlinear partial and ordinary differential equations and , in some cases , by integral or differo - integral equations .",
    "however , most of the mathematical methods developed so far , are only capable to solve linear differential equations . in the 1980 s ,",
    "george adomian ( 1923 - 1996 ) introduced a powerful method to solve nonlinear differential equations .",
    "since then , this method is known as the adomian decomposition method ( adm ) @xcite .",
    "the technique is based on a decomposition of a solution of a nonlinear differential equation in a series of functions .",
    "each term of the series is obtained from a polynomial generated by a power series expansion of an analytic function .",
    "the adomian method is very simple in an abstract formulation but the difficulty arises in calculating the polynomials that becomes a non - trivial task .",
    "this method has widely been used to solve equations that come from nonlinear models as well as to solve fractional differential equations @xcite .",
    "the advantage of this method is that , it solves the problem directly without the need of linearization , perturbation , or any other transformation , and also , reduces the massive computation works required by most other methods .",
    "the relativistic nonlinear harmonic oscillator , was studied by first time in the middle of the last century @xcite . in spite of its importance in several models of physics , exact solutions of its equation of motion",
    "have not been obtained . in the present work",
    "we will use the adomian decomposition method in combination with the laplace transform ( ladm ) @xcite to determine the relativistic oscillator solutions .",
    "this equation is a nonlinear ordinary differential equation that , in physics , is used to model a simple one dimensional harmonic oscillator with relativistic velocities .",
    "we will decomposed the nonlinear terms of this equation using the adomian polynomials and then , in combination with the use of the laplace transform , we will obtain an algorithm to solve the problem subject to initial conditions . finally , we will illustrate our procedure and the quality of the obtained algorithm by solving two examples in which the nonlinear differential equation is solved for different initial conditions .    our work is divided in several sections . in `` the adomian decomposition method combined with laplace transform '' section , we present , in a brief and self - contained manner , the ladm .",
    "several references are given to delve deeper into the subject and to study its mathematical foundation that is beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "in `` the relativistic harmonic oscillator '' section , we also give a brief introduction to the model described by the relativistic harmonic oscillator and we compare our results with the previous one obtained in this respect . in `` solution of the relativistic harmonic oscillator equation through ladm '' section , we will establish that ladm can be used to solve this equation in a very simple way . in `` application to the relativistic harmonic oscillator '' section , we will show by means of two examples , the quality and precision of our method , comparing the obtained results with existing approximate solutions available in the literature and obtained by other methods .",

    "the adm is a method to solve ordinary and nonlinear differential equations .",
    "using this method is possible to express analytic solutions in terms of a series @xcite . in a nutshell ,",
    "the method identifies and separates the linear and nonlinear parts of a differential equation .",
    "inverting and applying the highest order differential operator that is contained in the linear part of the equation , it is possible to express the solution in terms of the rest of the equation affected by the inverse operator . at this point ,",
    "the solution is proposed by means of a series with terms that will be determined and that give rise to the adomian polynomials @xcite .",
    "the nonlinear part can also be expressed in terms of these polynomials .",
    "the initial ( or the border conditions ) and the terms that contain the independent variables will be considered as the initial approximation . in this way and by means of a recurrence relations , it is possible to find the terms of the series that give the approximate solution of the differential equation . in the next paragraph",
