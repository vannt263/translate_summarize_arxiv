    "during the past several years , there has been considerable excitement about the possibility of the formation of disoriented chiral condensates ( d@xmath0c ) in heavy ion collisions @xcite .",
    "the basic scenario is as follows : in an ultrarelativistic heavy ion collision some region thermalizes at a temperature above the chiral restoration temperature .",
    "if the system cools sufficiently rapidly back through the transition temperature , the region will remain in a chiral restored phase .",
    "however , this phase is unstable ; small fluctuations in any chiral direction ( @xmath1 ) will grow exponentially .",
    "this can create regions where the pion field has macroscopic occupation . it should be stressed that this scenario is not derivable directly from the underlying theory of qcd and contains a number of untested dynamical assumptions , principally that the cooling is rapid .",
    "thus the failure of the system to form a d@xmath0c can not be used to rule out that the system has reached the chiral restoration temperature . on the other hand , observation of the formation of a d@xmath0c would be clear evidence that the phase transition had been reached .    unfortunately , since the scenario is not derived directly from a well - defined theory , it is difficult to know precisely what constitutes observation of a d@xmath0c .",
    "assuming the system forms a single large domain of d@xmath0c containing a large number of pions there should be clear signatures . in the first place , one expects an excess in the number of low @xmath2 pions produced .",
    "they would be at low @xmath2 since , by hypothesis , the region is large so the characteristic momentum is small ; the excess would be measured relative to a purely statistical thermal distribution .",
    "such a signal has the advantage of working even if multiple regions of d@xmath0c form provided each region is large enough so the characteristic momentum is sufficiently small to provide a discernible signal over the thermal background .",
    "such a signal is not decisive since one could imagine some other collective low energy effects which produce low @xmath2 pions .",
    "a much stronger signal of a single large domain of d@xmath0c has been proposed . since the pions formed in a d@xmath0c",
    "are essentially classical they form a coherent state .",
    "the coherent state has some orientation in isospin space ( or more precisely the system is a quantum superposition of coherent states with different orientations and particular correlations to the isospin of the remainder of the system @xcite ) .",
    "in essence all of the pions in the domain are pointing in the same isospin direction .",
    "provided the total number of pions in the domain is large , this implies that the distribution of the ratio of neutral to total pions in the domain is given by @xcite @xmath3 where r is the ratio of the number of @xmath4 s in the d@xmath0c divided by the total number of pions and @xmath5 is the probability .",
    "the derivation of @xmath5 is quite simple and will be discussed below .",
    "the distribution in eq .",
    "( [ pofr ] ) is qualitatively distinct from a purely statistical distribution in which the emission of charged and neutral pions is uncorrelated .",
    "the distribution from uncorrelated emissions in the infinite particle number limit approaches a delta function at @xmath6 . for finite ( but large )",
    "particle number the statistical distribution is narrowly peaked about 1/3 with a variance , @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the total number of pions . since these two distributions are so radically different one should in principle have a very clear signal if a single region of d@xmath0c where to form in heavy ion reactions and if the pions from the d@xmath0c are kinematically separated from other pions in the system .",
    "the dramatic nature of the preceding signature is based in large measure on the assumption that a single large domain of d@xmath0c is formed . _ a priori _ this seems rather unlikely for the following reason : if a large region of the system starts in a hot chirally restored phase and then rapidly cools through the phase transition , then there will be a large region which is unstable against growth of the pion field .",
    "presumably , this happens as a `` seed '' fluctuation in a small region which rapidly grows .",
    "it takes a time of at least @xmath9 for information about the formation of the domain to propagate a distance @xmath10 .",
    "however during the time this fluctuation is growing out to @xmath10 , the pion field at @xmath10 has been sitting in an unstable situation .",
    "the characteristic time it can remain in this unstable configuration is @xmath11 , the exponential growth time .",
    "if the information about the initial seed does not reach @xmath10 is a time comparable to @xmath11 the region near @xmath10 will likely begin its own exponential growth but in a chiral direction uncorrelated from the initial growth .",
    "thus , one expects domains of characteristic size @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "the effect of multiple domains on the @xmath13 distribution is fairly clear : it will tend to wash out the signal .",
    "if a large number of domains form and the pions emerging from different domains can not be distinguished kinematically it is clear from the central limit theorem that the @xmath13 distribution will approach a normal distribution .",
    "this normal distribution may be distinguished from the normal distribution arising from uncorrelated emission ; the case of multiple domains of d@xmath0c will have a substantially larger variance .",
    "unfortunately , there is an important practical limitation which makes it difficult to exploit the @xmath13 distribution as a signature . even under the most optimistic of scenarios ,",
    "the total number of pions coming from d@xmath0c s will be a small fraction of the total number of pions .",
    "if one includes all pions produced in the reaction , the signal from the pions from the d@xmath0c will presumably be overwhelmed .",
    "thus , it is highly desirable to use kinematic consideration to enhance the contributions coming from the d@xmath0c . in particular , it is sensible to study the @xmath13 distribution for a sample restricted to low @xmath2 pions only . in any scenario where the d@xmath0c is well defined , _",
    "i.e. _ , the occupation number is large is likely to require a moderately large regions of d@xmath0c and the characteristic momentum spread in the d@xmath0c will be fixed by the inverse size of the region .",
    "thus one expects d@xmath0cs to preferentially produce moderately low @xmath2 pions .",
    "( one also should restrict the pions in the distribution to a moderately narrow rapidity window ) .    as an experimental matter",
    ", it should be relatively straightforward to cut on the momentum of the charged pions to select low @xmath2 pions in a given rapidity window .",
    "for neutral pions , however , it is not a simple matter .",
    "the neutral pions will decay in flight and will ultimately be detected as photons . if one is simply interested in the overall @xmath13 distribution , without cuts , and if the detected photons come predominately from @xmath14 decays then one can use the @xmath15 as a surrogate for @xmath16 .",
    "recent experimental searches have exploited this strategy@xcite . however , in order to study the @xmath13 distribution in a limited kinematical region it is necessary to reconstruct the @xmath14 momenta from the observed photons in order to make kinematical cuts on the @xmath14 momenta .",
    "since the number of neutral pions per event is large , the reconstruction of neutral pion momenta is likely to be a formidable task .",
    "this raises the following interesting question : can one find a signature for the presence of regions of d@xmath0c of essentially the same quality as the @xmath13 distribution but which does not require the measurement of neutral pions ? in this article , we will show that the distribution of the number of charged pions ( in a kinematically limited region ) contains essentially the same information about d@xmath0c formation as the the @xmath13 distribution .",
    "this should greatly aid in searches for d@xmath0c formation .",
    "we also discuss additional information that can be inferred if @xmath14 s can be reconstructed .",
    "in particular , we show that the distribution of the total number of pions ( in a limited kinematic region ) provides a means to distinguish d@xmath0c formation from other hypothetical mechanisms for the production of a pion coherent state .",
    "we begin by studying an overly simple model and in subsequent sections we will generalize our results to more realistic scenarios . in this simplified situation",
    "we assume that in every collision a single large domain of d@xmath0c is formed with a large particle number .",
    "moreover , we will assume that the field strength and spatial distribution of this domain do not vary event by event , and that the pions produced in the d@xmath0c are kinematically completely distinguishable from all other pions in the system ( including those pions produced from `` @xmath17 s ''  _",
    "i.e. _ , fluctuations in the @xmath18 directions ) . finally , we will assume that both isospin violating effects and explicit chiral symmetry breaking are negligible .    by hypothesis",
    ", the region of d@xmath0c contains many particles and is essentially classical in nature . to simplify discussion",
    "we will adopt the usual convention of describing the physics in terms of the degrees of freedom in a linear sigma model with o(4 ) symmetry , _ i.e. _ , @xmath17 and @xmath19 rather than directly in terms of the qcd degrees of freedom .",
    "we wish to stress , however , that we are not relying on the detailed dynamics of any particular variant of the @xmath17 model .",
    "being a coherent state , the d@xmath0c can be written in the following form : @xmath20 is the vector of creation operators in the chiral space .",
    "the unit vector @xmath21 denotes the orientation of the d@xmath0c in the chiral space , @xmath22 is the distribution of the d@xmath0c in momentum space , and @xmath23 is the vacuum .",
    "the number operators for neutral and charged pions are @xmath24 and one can easily find their expectation values , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath25 .",
    "it turns out that @xmath26 can be factorized into the following form .",
    "@xmath27 where @xmath28 , and @xmath29 the expectation value @xmath30 measures the total number of @xmath31 s produced by the d@xmath0c if fully oriented in a pionic direction .",
    "the geometrical factors @xmath32 and @xmath33 will be called the neutral and charged proportions respectively , and they take the following forms . @xmath34",
    "note that @xmath30 does not depend on the orientation angles @xmath35 while @xmath36 do not depend on the dynamical variables @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "one can also evaluate the higher moments of @xmath39 , which gives @xmath40 with @xmath41 let s define the _ deviance _ @xmath42 $ ] of a distribution of variable @xmath43 such that @xmath44 ) \\langle x \\rangle^2 , \\qquad \\hbox{or }   \\qquad ( \\delta x)^2 \\equiv \\langle x^2 \\rangle - \\langle x \\rangle^2   = \\delta[x ] \\langle x \\rangle^2.\\ ] ] in this case , @xmath45 = 1/\\langle n \\rangle \\to 0 \\quad \\hbox{when $ \\langle n \\rangle \\to   \\infty$}.\\ ] ] actually it is straightforward to show that @xmath46 is described by a poisson distribution , which always has a small deviance as the variance is proportional to the mean .",
    "the above analysis shows that , _ for each set of orientation angles @xmath35 , _ the distributions of @xmath39 are normal .",
    "however , since the orientation is randomly generated in the process of spontaneous symmetry breaking , one can not predict @xmath35 . on the other hand ,",
    "since we are neglecting explicit chiral symmetry breaking , the system is equally probable to point in any direction in chiral space .",
    "moreover , since by hypothesis we are in a semiclassical situation ( large @xmath30 ) , it is legitimate to work with probabilities rather than amplitudes . using the technology of ref .",
    "@xcite , the probability distribution in the angular variables is given by the unit measure : @xmath47 one can use eq .",
    "( [ defg ] ) to reparametrize the probability distribution ( [ pa ] ) in terms of the neutral and charged proportions @xmath48 , _",
    "i.e. _ , the fraction of neutral or charged pions among all particles produced by the d@xmath0c .",

    "@xmath52 these distribution functions are plotted in fig .  1 in solid curves .",

    "@xmath56 is flat , and @xmath51 is equally likely to assume any value between 0 and @xmath57 .",
    "this is drastically different from pion emission from an uncorrelated source ( the dotted curves in fig .  1 and @xmath58 for neutral and charged pions respectively .",

    "this may sound counter - intuitive , but one must bear in mind that the emissions of neutral and charged pions are not independent and there is no contradiction . also note that @xmath83 is exactly as predicted in ref .",

    "6.e of ref .  @xcite . ) whether the same conclusion holds for @xmath114 is still an open question .",
    "let us recapitulate what we have shown in the previous sections .",
    "we have shown that one can calculate the probability distribution of the number of neutral or charged pions produced as a result of d@xmath0c formation .",
    "the resultant deviances @xmath76 s are not of the order @xmath115 as in an uncorrelated emission , but are instead enhanced by factors @xmath116 s which are of order @xmath30 . seeing such enhancements of deviances would be signatures of coherent pion productions .",
    "one can understand the origin of such enhancements of statistical fluctuations of the number of neutral or charged pions by considering the following analogy .",
    "consider two groups of gamblers playing roulette in a casino : @xmath84 lawyers at $ 100 tables , and @xmath117 physicists at the $ 1 tables , where the odds are the same . if each lawyer and physicist is given @xmath46 chips , of $ 100 and $ 1 , respectively ( so that the total amount given to the lawyers , @xmath118 , is the same as that given to the physicists , @xmath119 ) , and is required to bet all of them , the average loss will be the same for both groups as long as they are following the same betting strategies .",
    "however , it is easy to see that the statistical fluctuation of the loss of the lawyers would be much larger for that of the physicists . in other words ,",
    "the amount of loss , as well as its standard deviation , is `` quantized '' in units of the value of the bets .",
    "the larger the bet , the larger the fluctuation . on the other hand , one can also turn the argument around ; a discerning external observer can deduce , with the knowledge of the gambling strategies , the size of the bets of the lawyers from the statistical fluctuations of the lawyers losses , and do likewise for the physicists as well .    just as the chips in a single bet of a lawyer share the same fate ( either win or lose ) , all the pions in a single d@xmath0c domain share the same orientation in the chiral space . as a result ,",
    "the fluctuation of the number of pions in each direction in the chiral space is enhanced by a factor proportonal to @xmath30 , the number of pions in each d@xmath0c domain . and by reverse argument",
    ", one can deduce whether coherent pion emission is taking place by measuring the fluctuation of the number of emitted pions .",
    "our analysis has assumed that all the pions originate from coherent emissions , and each of these coherent states has @xmath120 . in the real world",
    ", there is contamination from independent pion emissions , and the total numbers of neutral or charged pions are the sums of these two contributions .",
    "@xmath121 where `` c '' and `` inc '' stands for `` coherent '' and `` incoherent '' , respectively .",
    "the variances of the numbers of coherently produced neutral or charged pions are enhanced while those of incoherent production are not .",
    "@xmath122 where @xmath95 are of order @xmath123 ( cf .  eq .  ( [ e1 ] ) , ( [ e2 ] ) )",
    ". then one can calculate the variance of the sum of the two contributions .",
    "@xmath124 with @xmath125 the parameter @xmath0 measures the fraction of pions which are coherently produced : @xmath126 when all the pions are from d@xmath0c , while @xmath127 when all of them are independently emitted .",
    "obviously , the more incoherent pions in the sample , the smaller is the enhancement factor @xmath128 .",
    "while these incoherently emitted pions dilute our signatures for d@xmath0c , they have different momentum spectra from those from d@xmath0c .",
    "d@xmath0c pions , being produced from coherent state , carry low @xmath2 .",
    "the typical @xmath2 is of the order of @xmath129 , where @xmath10 is the size of the domain from which the pion originates .",
    "in contrast incoherently emitted pions can carry high @xmath2 . therefore applying a low @xmath2 cut",
    "can minimize the noise from incoherent pion emissions .",
    "it is also advantageous to measure the rapidity of the pions and count their numbers in narrow rapidity windows .",
    "bear in mind that the rapidities of the pions are , up to small dispersions , equal to that of the original domain . as we have mentioned , it is probable that many domains are formed in a single collision , and all these domains may have different rapidities .",
    "for example , the domains at the surface of the `` fire ball '' are moving with high speed relative to the domains at the center . by binning the pions according to their rapidities , one can partially separate the pions from different domains , and the signals are enhanced as a result .",
    "the above procedure allows us to search for signatures from d@xmath0cs by counting only the charged pions .",
    "this is important as , with our present technology , it is difficult to count the number of @xmath4 s in a momentum bin , which would mean reconstructing all the pions from photons  a formidable task . on the other hand , with great experimental effort",
    ", it may be possible to count the neutral pions as well in the future . in that case",
    ", we will be able to distinguish d@xmath0c formation from other mechanisms of coherent pion productions .",
    "for example , one can count @xmath133 , the number of pions ( both neutral and charged ) in each rapidity window . for d@xmath0c formation , or any other mechanisms of coherent pion productions where",
    "the field is aligned with a random direction in the four - dimensional chiral space @xmath134 , the fluctuation of @xmath133 is large . on the other hand , for mechanisms of coherent pion productions where the field is aligned with a random direction in the three - dimensional isospace @xmath135 but without involving the @xmath17 direction ,",
    "it is straightforward to show that the fluctuation of @xmath133 is small .    in summary",
    ", we have constructed signatures for d@xmath0c formation in heavy ion collisions which do not require counting the number of neutral pions .",
    "instead , we suggest counting the number of charged pions produced , and a large fluctuation would be a signal of d@xmath0c formation .",
    "we believe these new signatures will be useful in searches for d@xmath0c at rhic and lhc .",

    "<S> we show that the variance in the number of charged pions ( in a suitable range of momentum space ) provides a signature for the observation of a disoriented chiral condensate ( d@xmath0c ) </S>",
    "<S> . the signal should be observable even if multiple domains of d@xmath0c form provided the average number of pions per domain is significantly large than unity . </S>",
    "<S> the variance of the number charged pions alone provides a signal which can be used even if the number of neutral pions can not be measured in a given detector . </S>",
    "<S> if the neutrals can be measured , however , the fluctuations in the total number of pions provides a signature which distinguishes disoriented chiral condensates from other hypothetical sources of coherent states of pions . </S>"
