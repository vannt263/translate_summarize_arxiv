    "majorana bound states ( mbss ) at the ends of quantum wires , which represent a solid state realisation of majorana fermions , have been proposed as a fault - tolerant quantum memory in a topological quantum computer @xcite . however , their unambiguous detection is difficult since they are neutral quasiparticles .",

    "most studies focus on conductance properties @xcite or the ac josephson effect @xcite .",
    "however , so far noise properties of systems with a mbs have attracted little attention : the noise has been investigated in systems of coupled vortex cores @xcite and the cross correlation of currents through coupled mbss at the ends of a quantum wire has been used to probe nonlocality @xcite .",
    "furthermore noise properties of an isolated majorana fermion coupled to a normal metal has been discussed in @xcite .",
    "a discussion of noise properties of transport through a mbs in a superconductor at the end of a quantum wire so far is missing but is essential not just for detection but for a complete understanding of the readout schemes for quantum memory that have been developed so far @xcite .",

    "we approach the coupling of the sc to the fm wire in two steps : first , we describe a lateral tunnel contact in order to extract the general gap structure induced in the wire due to the presence of the sc . in a second step",
