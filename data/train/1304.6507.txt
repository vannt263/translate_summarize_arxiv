    "the main applications of surface acoustic wave ( saw ) devices are in the field of wireless communication , where saw components are used to generate and collect high frequency signals . in mobile phones , global positioning systems , or color television sets ,",
    "these components are of course motionless .",
    "there exist however situations where saws propagate over a rotating surface .",
    "for instance , saw sensors were used to monitor the pressure of a tire in a moving automobile ( pohl _ et al .",
    "_ 1997 ) ; an ultrasonic saw - based apparatus was designed to detect flaws on the surface of a rotating member such as a roller bearing ( kawasaki _ et al .",
    "_ 1991 ) ; robust and shock - resistant saw resonator gyroscopes have been miniaturized to a 1 cm @xmath0 1 cm surface ( jose _ et al . _ 2000 ) ; etc . for the theoretical aspect , schoenberg & censor ( 1973 ) seem to have been the first authors to describe rayleigh waves in a rotating , homogeneous , isotropic , linear , elastic medium , for any orientation of the rotation axis with respect to the free surface , and with both the coriolis and the centrifugal accelerations taken into account .",
    "they pointed out that , in contrast to the non - rotating case , bulk and surface waves are dispersive , and that the acoustical tensor is hermitian instead of real symmetric ; they did not however derive the secular equation for surface waves .",
    "clarke & burdess ( 1994 ) obtained this equation for an isotropic half - space rotating about an axis orthogonal to the direction of propagation and to the normal to the half - space .",
    "others ( lao 1980 ; wauer 1999 ; grigorevski _ et al . _ 2000 ; etc . ) considered similar problems but neglected the centrifugal acceleration .",
    "for anisotropic crystals , fang _",
    "et al . _ ( 2000 ) and zhou & jiang ( 2001 ) considered crystals of tetragonal symmetry but did not derive the secular equation explicitly . as pointed out in the latter article ,",
    "the influence of the centrifugal acceleration upon the saw speed is of the same order as that of the coriolis acceleration and should not be overlooked , even at small rotation rates . in this paper , an analytical investigation of the propagation of saws in a rotating orthorhombic crystal",
    "is presented .    in  2 , the crystal considered is at first of general ( triclinic ) anisotropy and rotates at a uniform rate about any axis .",
    "the equations of motion and the boundary conditions are derived .",
    "then the analysis is specialized to crystals with rhombic and higher symmetries .",
    "the material is cut along the plane of symmetry @xmath1 and the wave travels in the @xmath2 direction , where the @xmath3 axes are crystallographic axes .",
    "the semi - infinite body rotates along @xmath2 , @xmath4 , or @xmath5 . in the latter case ,",
    "anti - plane motions and stresses decouple from their in - plane counterparts ; in the other two cases , they do not .",
    "the choice of orthorhombic symmetry is of great importance because , as pointed out by royer & dieulesaint ( 1984 ) , it covers 16 types of symmetries , including tetragonal , hexagonal , cubic , and of course isotropic ; the choice of a rotation axis aligned with the normal to the free plane or to crystallographic axes in this plane is justified from an experimental point of view . in  3 , the secular ( dispersion )",
    "equations are derived explicitly for each rotation , using the method of the polarization vector .",
    "this method was used by currie ( 1979 ) and by taziev ( 1989 ) in order to derive explicit secular equations for saws in non - rotating crystals .",
    "recently , ting ( 2003@xmath6 ) improved upon this method and placed it within the framework of the stroh ( 1958 , 1962 ) formalism . here , the fundamental equations of the method are obtained in a manner which does not rely upon this formalism .",
    "the secular equation is obtained as a quadratic relationship between three determinants ( of @xmath7 matrices for rotation about @xmath5 , of @xmath8 matrices for rotations about @xmath2 or @xmath4 ) , whose elements are given explicitly in terms of the elastic parameters , the wave speed , and @xmath9  the ratio of the rotation rate by the wave frequency .",
    "several secular equations arise in the resolution of the problem but only one is kept ; the others are dismissed on the argument that they do not reduce to the known single cubic secular equation when the rotation rate vanishes .",
    "numerically , the rayleigh wave speed decreases monotonically as @xmath9 increases .",
    "this influence is shown graphically for @xmath10-iodic acid ( hio@xmath11 , rhombic ) .",
    "for this graph , @xmath9 is chosen to vary from 0 to 10 . although it is not realistic to imagine a crystal rotating at a frequency which would be greater , or even close to , the frequency of an ultrasonic surface wave , this wide range is chosen to show numerically that the wave speed tends to zero with increasing @xmath9 without , seemingly , ever reaching it . for silica ( sio@xmath12 , isotropic )",
    ", the calculations are conducted for a smaller range ( @xmath13 ) with and without the contribution of the centrifugal acceleration in order to show its importance .",
    "some theoretical issues are left open such as , the questions of existence and uniqueness of a surface wave in a rotating crystal , or the question of the general behaviour of the wave speed as a function of @xmath9 .",
    "consider a semi - infinite body made of a linearly elastic , anisotropic crystal . for two - dimensional deformations ,",

    ", we have @xmath52 for rotation about the @xmath2 axis , @xmath4 axis , and @xmath5 axis , respectively .",
    "the stroh - barnett - lothe formalism has beautifully addressed and resolved most of the problems arising in linear anisotropic elasticity ( see the textbook by ting ( 1996 ) for a thorough review . ) some researchers have however followed other routes for the study of saws in anisotropic crystals ( see ting ( 2003@xmath53 ) for an exposition of several methods . ) for instance , fu & mielke ( 2002 ) recently proposed a highly efficient numerical scheme to determine the rayleigh wave speed , which is based on a ricatti equation . here the method of the polarization vector ( currie 1979 ; taziev 1989 ; ting 2003@xmath6 ) is presented for rotating orthorhombic crystals . only simple algebraic manipulations and first integrals ( mozhaev 1995 ) are used , so that the derivation should appeal to the reader who is not familiar with the stroh ( 1958 , 1962 ) formalism and with the orthogonality relations ( barnett & lothe 1973 ) .",
    "let us examine the equations of motion closer .",
    "they read : @xmath54 take the scalar product of the first line by @xmath55 and of the second line by @xmath56 ; then add , together with the complex conjugate ; finally , integrate between 0 and @xmath57 to obtain : @xmath58_0^\\infty        = 0,\\ ] ] which , using the boundary conditions , reduces to : @xmath59 , a relation first established by stroh ( 1958 ) in the static , non - rotating case .",

    "<S> the propagation of surface ( rayleigh ) waves over a rotating orthorhombic crystal is studied . </S>",
    "<S> the crystal possesses three crystallographic axes , normal to the symmetry planes : the half - space is cut along a plane normal to one of these axes , the wave travels in the direction of another , and the rotation occurs at a uniform rate about any of the three axes . </S>",
    "<S> the secular equation for the surface wave speed is found explicitly ; in contrast to the non - rotating case , it is dispersive ( frequency - dependent ) . </S>",
    "<S> both coriolis and centrifugal accelerations appear in the equations of motion : none can be neglected in favor of the other , even at small rotation rates .    </S>",
