    "large data sets of crystalline structures are nowadays available in two major contexts . on one hand , databases of materials have been created containing structural information of both experimental and theoretical compounds from high - throughput calculations , which are the basis for data - mining techniques in materials discovery projects  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "ab initio structure predictions  @xcite can produce a huge number of new structures that have either not yet been found experimentally or are metastable  @xcite . in both cases",
    "it is essential to quantify similarities and dissimilarities between structures in the data sets , requiring a configurational distance that satisfies the properties of a metric . databases frequently contain duplicates and insufficiently characterized structures which need to be identified and filtered . in experimental data ,",
    "the representation of identical structures as obtained from different experiments will always slightly differ due to noise in the measurements , such that the configurational distance is never exactly zero .",
    "noise is also present in theoretical calculations where a geometry relaxation is for instance stopped once a certain , possibly insufficient convergence threshold is reached . in ab initio structure prediction",
    "schemes it is typically necessary to maintain some structural diversity which can be quantified as a certain minimal configurational distance .",
    "all these examples clearly show the need for a metric that allows to measure configurational distances and local structures in a reliable and efficient way .",
    "crystalline structures are typically given in a dual representation .",
    "the first part specifies the cell and the second part the atomic positions within the cell .",
    "the former can for instance be given by the three lattice vectors @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , or by their lengths @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , and the intermediate angles @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 . the atomic positions can either be specified by cartesian coordinates or the reduced coordinates with respect to the lattice vectors .",
    "however , such representations are not unique , since any choice of lattice points can serve as cell vectors of the same crystalline structure .",
    "unique and preferably standardized cell parameters are required for comparison and analysis of different crystals  @xcite .",
    "algorithms to transform unit cells to a reduced form are frequently used in crystallography , such as the niggli - reduction  @xcite which produces cells with shortest possible vectors ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "unfortunately , in the presence of noisy lattice vectors , cells can change discontinuously within the niggli - reduction algorithm .",
    "symmetry analysis and the corresponding classification in the 230 crystallographic space groups are another tool to compare crystal structures",
    ". however , the outcome of a symmetry analysis algorithm strongly depends on a tolerance parameter such that the introduction of some noise can change the resulting space group in a discontinuous manner . because of the above described problems it is difficult to quantify similarities based on dual representations .    within the structure prediction community fingerprints that are not based on such a dual representation have been proposed .",
    "oganov et al .",
    "@xcite introduced element resolved radial distribution functions as a crystal fingerprint . for a crystal containing one element only a single function is obtained for the entire system .",
    "the difference between the radial distribution functions of two crystals is then taken as the configurational distance . by definition",
    "the radial distribution function contains only radial information , but no information about the angular distribution of the atoms .",
    "such angular information has been added in the bond characterization matrix ( bcm ) fingerprint  @xcite . in this fingerprint spherical harmonic and exponential functions",
    "are used to set up modified bond - orientational order metrics  @xcite of the entire configuration .",
    "the distance between two configurations can be measured by the euclidean distance between their bcms .",
    "atomic environment descriptors are also needed in the context of machine learning schemes for force fields  @xcite , bonding pattern recognition  @xcite , or to compare vacancy , interstitial and intercalation sites  @xcite .",
    "these descriptors could also be used to measure similarities between structures .",
    "even though they have never been used in this context we will present a comparison with such a descriptor .    when humans decide by visual inspection whether two structures are similar they proceed typically in a different way .",
    "they try to find matching atoms which have the same structural environment .",
    "if all the atoms in one structure can be matched with the atoms of the other structure , the two structures are considered to be identical .",
    "such a matching approach based on the hungarian algorithm  @xcite has already turned out to be useful for the distinction of clusters  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we will present a fingerprint for crystalline structures which is based on such a matching approach .",
    "the environment of each atom is described by an atomic fingerprint which is calculated in real space for an infinite crystal and represents some kind of environmental scattering properties observed from the central atom .",
    "therefore , all the ambiguities of a dual representation do not enter into the fingerprint , allowing an efficient and precise comparison of structures .",
    "recently we have proposed an configurational fingerprint for clusters  @xcite . in this approach",
    "an overlap matrix is calculated for an atom centered gaussian basis set . the vector formed by the eigenvalues of this",
    "matrix forms a global fingerprint that characterizes the entire structure .",
    "the euclidian norm of the difference vector between two structures is the configurational distance between them and satisfies the properties of a metric .",
    "since there is no unique representation of a crystal by a group of atoms ( e.g. the atoms in some unit cell ) we will use atomic fingerprints instead of global fingerprints in the crystalline case .",
    "however , this atomic fingerprint is closely related to our global fingerprint for non - periodic systems . for each atom @xmath10 in a crystal located at @xmath11 we obtain a cluster of atoms by considering only those contained in a sphere centered at @xmath11 . for this cluster",
    "we calculate the overlap matrix elements @xmath12 as described in reference   for a non - periodic system , i.e we put on each atom one or several gaussian type orbitals and calculate the resulting overlap integral .",
    "the orbitals are indexed by the letters @xmath13 and @xmath14 and the index @xmath15 gives the index of the atom on which the gaussian @xmath16 is centered , i.e. @xmath17 in this first step , the amplitudes of the gaussians @xmath18 are chosen such that the gaussians are normalized to one . to avoid that the eigenvalues have discontinuities when an atom enters into or leaves the sphere we construct in a second step another matrix @xmath19 such that @xmath20 the cutoff function @xmath21 smoothly goes to zero on the surface of the sphere with radius @xmath22 @xmath23 in the limit where @xmath24 tends to infinity the cutoff function converges to a gaussian of width @xmath25 .",
    "the characteristic length scale @xmath25 is typically chosen to be the sum of the two largest covalent radii in the system .",
    "the value @xmath24 determines how many derivatives of the cutoff function are continuous on the surface of the sphere , and @xmath26 was used in the following .",
    "one can consider the modified matrix @xmath19 to be the overlap matrix of the cluster where the amplitude of the gaussian at atom @xmath13 is determined by @xmath27 . in this way",
    "atoms close to the surface of the sphere give rise to very small eigenvalues of @xmath19 and are thus weighted less than the atoms closer to the center .",
    "the eigenvalues of this matrix @xmath19 are sorted in descending order and form the atomic fingerprint vector @xmath28 .",
    "since we can not predict exactly how many atoms will be in the sphere we estimate a maximum length for the atomic fingerprint vector .",
    "if the number of atoms is too small to generate enough eigenvalues to fill up the entire vector , the entries at the end of the fingerprint vector are filled up with zeros .",
    "this also guarantees that the fingerprint is a continuous function with respect to the motion of the atoms when atoms might enter or leave the sphere . if an atom enters into the sphere some zeros towards the end of the fingerprint vector are transformed in a continuous way into some very small entries which only contribute little to the overall fingerprint .",
    "the euclidean norm @xmath29 measures the dissimilarity between the atomic environments of atoms @xmath10 and @xmath30",
    ".    the atomic fingerprints @xmath31 and @xmath32 of all the @xmath33 atoms in two crystalline configurations @xmath34 and @xmath35 can now be used to define a configurational distance @xmath36 between the two crystals : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is a permutation function which matches a certain atom @xmath10 in crystal @xmath34 with atom @xmath39 in crystal @xmath35 . the optimal permutation function which minimizes @xmath36",
    "can be found with the hungarian algorithm  @xcite in polynomial time .",
    "if the two crystals @xmath34 and @xmath35 are identical the hungarian algorithm will in this way assign corresponding atoms to each other .",
    "the hungarian algorithm needs as its input only the cost matrix @xmath40 given by @xmath41    in the following it will be shown that @xmath36 satisfies the properties of a metric , namely    * positiveness : @xmath42 * symmetry : @xmath43 * coincidence axiom : @xmath44 if and only if @xmath45 * triangle inequality : @xmath46 .    from the definition ( eq .  [ def ] )",
    "it is obvious that the positiveness and symmetry conditions are fulfilled .",
    "the coincidence theorem is satisfied if the individual atomic fingerprints are unique , i.e if there are not two different atomic environments that give rise to identical atomic fingerprints . in our work on fingerprints for clusters",
    "we have shown that the fingerprints can be considered to be unique if they have a length larger or equal to 3 per atom .",
    "the triangle inequality can be established in this way : @xmath47 where @xmath38 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 are assumed to be the permutations that minimize respectively the euclidean vector norms associated to @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath36 .",
    "since the @xmath11-centered spheres contain typically about 50 atoms , an atomic fingerprint has at least length 50 if only @xmath52-type gaussian orbitals or length 200 if both @xmath52 and @xmath34 orbitals are used . since a configuration is characterized by the ensemble of all the atomic fingerprints of all the atoms in the cell , the amount of data needed to characterize a structure is quite large even though it is certainly manageable for crystals with a small number of atoms per unit cell .",
    "storage requirements might however become too high in certain cases such as large molecular crystals .",
    "we will , therefore , introduce contraction schemes that allow to considerably reduce the amount of data necessary to characterize a crystalline structure .",
    "two such schemes will briefly be discussed below .",
    "let us introduce a function @xmath53 that designates a certain property of the gaussian orbital @xmath13 and encodes it in form of a contiguous integer index . in case of a multicomponent crystal",
    "it can indicate on which kind of chemical element the gaussians are centered and whether the orbital is of @xmath52 or @xmath34 type .",
    "the principal vector is thus chopped into pieces whose elements all carry the same value @xmath53 . in the following presentation of numerical results",
    "we have always considered the central atom to be special , independent of its true chemical type .",
    "having @xmath54 atomic species in the unit cell and using atomic gaussian orbitals with a maximum angular momentum @xmath55 , @xmath53 runs from 1 to @xmath56 .",
    "now we can construct a contracted matrix @xmath57 @xmath58 together with its metric tensor @xmath59 @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the principal vector of the matrix @xmath19 of eq .  [ cutoff ] .",
    "the eigenvalues @xmath62 of the generalized eigenvalue problem @xmath63 form again an atomic fingerprint of length @xmath56 which is much shorter than the non - contracted fingerprint @xmath28 .",
    "the fingerprints described so far can in principle also be used for molecular crystals .",
    "however , the amount of data needed to characterize such crystals can be quite large if the molecules forming the crystal contain many atoms . by creating molecular orbitals in analogy with standard methods in electronic structure calculations the required amount of data",
    "can be considerably reduced .",
    "the eigenvalues arising from the overlap matrix in this molecular basis set will then form a fingerprint for the molecular crystal .",
    "the molecular orbitals can be obtained in the following way : for each molecule @xmath10 in our unit cell we cut out a cluster of molecules within a sphere of a certain radius . for each molecule",
    "@xmath6 in this sphere we set up the overlap matrix by putting gaussian type orbitals on all its constituent atoms .",
    "then we calculate for this matrix the eigenvalues and eigenvectors .",
    "the principal vectors @xmath64 belonging to several of the largest eigenvalues @xmath65 are subsequently used for the contraction : @xmath66 no metric tensor is required since the set of vectors used for the contraction is orthogonal .",
    "the molecular orbitals have characteristic patterns , such that the orbital corresponding to the first principal vector has no nodes , while the orbitals of the following principal vectors have increasing number of nodes .",
    "they are therefore similar to the atomic orbitals of @xmath52 , @xmath34 and higher angular momentum character , which were used for the fingerprints in the ordinary crystals . in fig .",
    "[ orbitals ] these orbitals are shown for the case of the paracetamol molecule .    by multiplying @xmath67 with some cutoff function as in eq .",
    "[ cutoff ] we can then obtain molecule centered overlap matrices in this molecular basis which is free of discontinuities with respect to the motion of the atoms . in the molecular case",
    "the value of the cutoff function depends on some short range pseudo - interaction between the central and the surrounding molecules .",
    "this interaction @xmath68 between the central molecule @xmath10 and another molecule @xmath6 is given by @xmath69 where the sum over @xmath13 runs over all the atoms in the central molecule @xmath10 and the sum over @xmath14 over all the atoms in the surrounding molecule @xmath6 .",
    "@xmath70 is the distance between the atoms @xmath13 and @xmath14 and @xmath71 is the sum of the van der waals radii of the two atoms .",
    "the interaction is taken to vanish beyond its first zero .",
    "because of the short range of the interaction , molecules sharing a large surface will be coupled strongly .",
    "the analytical form of the cutoff function is identical to the one for the atomic case ( eq .  [ fcut ] ) .",
    "however , since a cartesian distance between molecules is ill defined , the argument in eq .",
    "[ fcut ] is modified .",
    "the scaled distance @xmath72 between the atoms is replaced by the normalized interaction between the molecules @xmath73 the eigenvalues of this final overlap matrix form now a fingerprint describing the environment of this molecule @xmath10 with respect to the other molecules . to compare two structures this procedure",
    "is done for all molecules contained in the corresponding unit cell .",
    "a configurational distance is calculated then as in eq .",
    "[ def ] by using the hungarian algorithm  @xcite .",
    "structural data found in various material databases is frequently obtained from measurements at different temperatures which results in thermal expansion .",
    "similarly , measurements at different pressures or low quality x - ray diffraction patterns can lead to slight cell distortions .",
    "obviously our fingerprint distances among such expanded or distorted but otherwise identical structures are different from zero . for these reasons",
    "we have introduced a scheme where the six degrees of freedom associated to the cell are optimized while keeping the reduced atomic coordinates fixed such as to obtain the smallest possible distance to a reference configuration .",
    "the gradient of our fingerprint distance with respect to the lattice vectors can be calculated analytically using the hellmann feynman theorem .",
    "an application of the lattice optimization scheme was applied to a subset of zro@xmath74 structures taken from the open quantum materials database ( oqmd )  @xcite , as will be discussed in further detail later in the following section .",
    "fig .  [ big ] shows all possible pairwise configurational distances obtained with several fingerprints for various data sets .",
    "different fingerprints are plotted along the x and y axis .",
    "lfp stands for the uncontracted long fingerprint and in square parenthesis it is indicated whether only @xmath52 or both @xmath52 and @xmath34 orbitals were used to set up the overlap matrix , sfp[@xmath52 ] stands for the short contracted fingerprint with @xmath52 orbitals only where the properties used for the contraction are central atom and the element type of the neighboring atoms in the sphere . for materials that have only one type of element ( si in our case ) the atomic fingerprint has only length two and the coincidence theorem is not satisfied .",
    "even though there are hyperplanes in the configurational space where different configurations have identical fingerprints , it is very unlikely that different local minima lie on such hyperplanes and the fingerprint can therefore nevertheless well distinguish between identical and distinct structures .",
    "if both @xmath52 and @xmath34 orbitals are used ( sfp[@xmath76 ) the atomic fingerprint has at least length 4 and no problem with the coincidence theorem arise .",
    "in addition we also show the configurational distances arising from the oganov  @xcite and bcm  @xcite fingerprints as well as from a fingerprint based on the amplitudes of symmetry functions  @xcite .",
    "all our data sets contain both the global minimum ( geometric ground state ) as well as local minima ( metastable ) structures , obtained from minima hopping runs  @xcite .",
    "energies and forces were calculated with the dftb+  @xcite method for sic and the molecular crystals , and the lenosky tight - binding scheme was used for si  @xcite . for the cspbi@xmath77 perovskite and the transparent conductive oxide zn@xmath74sno@xmath78 plane wave density functional theory ( dft ) calculations were used as implemented in the quantum espresso code  @xcite .",
    "the first test set consists of clathrate like structures of low density silicon allotropes  @xcite .",
    "low density silicon gives rise to a larger number of low energy crystalline structures than silicon at densities of diamond silicon and thus poses an ideal benchmark system .",
    "in the first line of the figure we show the results of a relatively sloppy local geometry optimization , where the relaxation is stopped once the forces are smaller than 5.e-2  ev /  .",
    "gaps separating identical from distinct structures are hardly visible for all fingerprints .",
    "once a very accurate geometry optimization with a force threshold of 5.e-3  ev / @xmath79 is performed , gaps become visible for all the fingerprints .    the second data set is silicon carbide , a material well known for its large number of polytypes .",
    "our fingerprint gives rise to a small gap whereas the configurational distances based on all other fingerprints do not show any gap at all .",
    "the opening of a gap can again be observed once the geometry optimization is done with high accuracy . for this case",
    "all fingerprints result in a gap , but like for all test sets it is the least pronounced for the bcm fingerprint .",
    "both the oganov and bcm fingerprints are global ones such that information is lost in the averaging process of these fingerprints as the system gets larger .",
    "therefore , it is not surprising that the gap again disappears even for the high quality geometry optimization once one goes to large cells .",
    "the next two test sets consist of an oxide material and a perovskite with their characteristic building blocks of octahedra and tetrahedra which can be arranged in a very large number of different ways .",
    "all our fingerprints give rise to clear gaps separating identical from distinct structures .",
    "the oganov fingerprint also gives rise to clear gaps whereas the bcm fingerprint only weakly indicates some gap .",
    "the behler fingerprint gives a well pronounced gap for zn@xmath74sno@xmath78 but only a blurred gap for cspbi@xmath77 .",
    "the last theoretical test system is a platinum surface . in this case",
    "the energies were calculated with the morse potential  @xcite .",
    "the geometry optimization were done with high accuracy and therefore a big gap is visible in all cases .        fig .",
    "[ energy ] shows the correlation between the energy difference and the fingerprint distance for all the test cases of fig .",
    "[ big ] . except for the very large 256 atoms system there exists always a clear energy gap if the geometry optimization was done with high accuracy .",
    "even though there is of course the possibility of nearly degenerate structures , this seems to happen rarely in practice and energy is thus a rather good and simple descriptor for small unit cells .    to test our molecular fingerprint ,",
    "two test systems were employed , namely crystalline formaldhyde and paracetamol .",
    "the formaldehyde system comprised 240 structures with 8 molecules per cell and the paracetamol system 300 structures with 4 molecules per cell .",
    "the two top panels of fig .  [ molecular ] show the molecular fingerprint distance versus the energy difference of different structures of paracetamol and formaldehyde , respectively .",
    "the two bottom panels show the correlation of the standard fingerprint against the molecular fingerprint for both systems .",
    "the existence of a gap in the pairwise distance distributions clearly indicates that identical and distinct structures can be identified by both fingerprints .",
    "however , the molecular fingerprint vector is considerably shorter because only six principal vectors were used ( shown in fig .",
    "[ orbitals ] ) . since six is the number of degrees of freedom of a rigid rotator it is expected that this fingerprint is long enough to satisfy the coincidence theorem .",
    "top panels : correlation between the energy difference and the molecular fingerprint distance ( mfp ) for formaldehyde ( a ) and paracetamol ( b ) .",
    "bottom panels : correlation between molecular fingerprint distance and standard fingerprint distance ( short contracted fingerprint with s orbitals only , sfp[s ] ) for formaldehyde ( c ) and paracetamol ( d ) . ]     the nodal character of the first six principal vectors for the paracetamol molecule . the atoms are colored according to the sign of the elements of the first six principal vectors @xmath64 . a systematic colour pattern can be observed .",
    "the first principal eigenvector never changes sign and has therefore no nodes ( a ) .",
    "higher principal vectors exhibit more and more nodes ( b - f ) . ]",
    "next we applied our fingerprint to zro@xmath74 structures contained in the oqmd .",
    "115 different entries were available at this composition .",
    "the structures were either based on experimental data retrieved from the inorganic crystal structure database ( icsd ) or on binary structural prototypes .",
    "when the oqmd was initially created , duplicate entries were identified with the structure comparison algorithm as implemented in the materials interface ( mint ) software package  @xcite which employs a 6-level test that includes cell reduction as well as an analysis of the lattice symmetry .",
    "structures classified as identical to an existing entry in oqmd were mapped to that entry without performing a structural relaxation .",
    "therefore , the structural data set contains both dft optimized and experimental structures , resulting in noise on the atomic and cell coordinates arising from the numerical calculations as well as from the different experiments and thermal effects . in fig .",
    "[ zro2]a we show the ordinary and the lattice vector optimized fingerprint distances for all 115 structures from the database .",
    "we can see that the fingerprint distance can be reduced down to about 1.e-7 for many structures .",
    "for some of them the initial fingerprint distances were as large as 0.1 .",
    "this allows to detect some identical structures whose initial large fingerprint distance was only due to thermal expansion .",
    "however , even with lattice vector optimization it was not possible to decide for the whole data set in an inambiguous way which structures are identical and which were not .",
    "therefore , local geometry optimizations were performed at the dft level for all structures using the vasp code  @xcite .",
    "a plane wave cutoff energy of 520  ev was used together with a dense @xmath10-point mesh .",
    "both the atomic and cell variables were relaxed until the maximal force component was less than 2.e-3  ev / @xmath79 and the stress below 1.e-2  gpa .",
    "panel ( b ) of fig .",
    "[ zro2 ] shows the dft energy differences of the relaxed structures against the fingerprint distances , showing a clear gap that allows to distinguish between identical and different structures .",
    "applying the lattice vector optimization scheme on these relaxed structures was not able to further lower the fingerprint distances of identical structures .",
    "the coloring in fig .",
    "[ zro2 ] indicates how the two structures belonging to a fingerprint distance were classified by mint . assuming that there are no different structures with degenerate dft energies",
    ", one can conclude that mint was not able to extract from the non - relaxed data set the information whether structures are identical or not and has erroneously assigned numerous identical structures as distinct , and vice versa to a lesser extent .",
    "since both oganov and bcm methods are global fingerprints that discard crucial information , they can fail to describe structural differences , a problem that becomes especially apparent when considering defect structures in complex materials . as an example",
    ", a @xmath80 supercell was constructed of the cubic perovskite structure of laalo@xmath77  @xcite .",
    "half of the al atoms on the b - sites were replaced by mn .",
    "then , single oxygen vacancies were introduced on symmetrically inequivalent x - sites .",
    "obviously , the structural symmetry was reduced from the initial space group @xmath81 of laalo@xmath77 to the orthorhombic space group @xmath82 of the supercell la(al , mn)o@xmath77 , and the oxygen vacancies resulted in structures with @xmath83 and @xmath84 symmetry .",
    "both mint and our fingerprint confirm that the structures are clearly different , whereas the oganov and bcm fingerprint erronously classify both structures as identical .",
    "atomic fingerprints that describe the scattering properties as obtained from an overlap matrix are well suited to characterize atomic environments .",
    "an ensemble of atomic fingerprints forms a global fingerprint that allows to identify crystalline structures and to define configurational distances satisfying the properties of a metric .",
    "the widely used oganov and bcm fingerprints do not have these properties and do also in practice not allow a reliable way to distinguish identical from distinct structures .",
    "symmetry function based fingerprints are of similar quality as our scattering fingerprints .",
    "however , they are much more costly to calculate .",
    "both fingerprints have a cubic scaling with respect to the number of atoms within the cutoff range , but our prefactor of the matrix diagonalization is much smaller then the prefactor for the 3-body terms required for the calculation of the symmetry functions .",
    "in contrast to ` true'`false ' schemes such as employed in mint which rely on a threshold and affirm that two structures are either identical or distinct , our fingerprint gives a distance between configurations .",
    "the appearance of a gap in the distance distribution indicates that a reliable assignment of identical and distinct structure can be performed .",
    "in addition , strong reductions in the fingerprint distances upon lattice vector optimization can detect and eliminate thermal noise on the data set , rendering our fingerprint ideal to scan for duplicates in large structural databases .",
    "our scheme can easily be extended to molecular crystals by introducing quantities that are analogous to molecular orbitals .",
    "furthermore , the new fingerprint can be used to accurately explore local environments to create atomic and structural attributes for machine learning techniques . in summary",
    ", we have demonstrated that this approach allows to characterize crystalline structures by rather short fingerprint vectors and to decide more reliably whether structures are identical or not than previously proposed methods .",
