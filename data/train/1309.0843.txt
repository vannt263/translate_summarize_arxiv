    "there are liquids in nature that exhibit unexpected thermodynamic or transport properties .",
    "water belongs in this group of anomalous liquids and it is the one with the most puzzling behavior .",
    "it expands upon cooling at fixed pressure ( density anomaly ) , diffuses faster upon compression at fixed temperature ( diffusion anomaly ) and become less ordered upon increasing density at constant temperature ( structural anomaly ) . despite the complexity of its anomalies , simple molecular water models proved to be able to reproduce many of water unusual properties @xcite .",
    "the origin of water s anomalies is related to the competition between open low - density and closed high - density structures , which depend on the thermodynamic state of the liquid @xcite . with the purpose of understanding the nature of these anomalies",
    "several models were proposed in which spherically symmetric particles interact with each other by an isotropic potential @xcite where this competition is described by two preferred interparticle distances .    among these models , the core - softened shoulder potential proposed by oliveira _ _ et .",
    "al.__@xcite reproduces qualitatively some of the most remarkable water s anomalies .",
    "in particular the regions of density anomaly , diffusion anomaly and structural anomaly obey the same hierarchy as found in real water @xcite .",
    "this potential can represent in an effective and orientation - averaged way the interactions between water clusters characterized by the presence of those two structures ( open and closed ) discussed above .",
    "the open structure is favored by low pressures and the closed structure is favored by high pressures , but only becomes accessible at sufficiently high temperatures .",
    "even though core - softened potentials have been mainly used for modeling water @xcite , many other materials present the so called water - like anomaly behavior@xcite and , in principle , could be represented by two length potentials . in this sense , it is reasonable to use core - softened potentials as the building blocks of a broader class of materials which we can classify as anomalous fluids .",
    "the success of these models raise the question of what properties are not well represented by spherical symmetric potentials .    in a recently study we compared the monomeric model proposed by oliveira _ _ et .",
    "al.__@xcite with a model of dimeric molecules linked as rigid dumbbells , interacting with the same potential .",
    "the introduction of anisotropy leads to a much larger region of solid phase in the phase diagram and to the appearance of a liquid crystal phase@xcite .",
    "later we showed that the size of anomalous regions in the pressure temperature phase diagram is dependent on the value of interparticle separation @xmath0 and that the effect of the introduction of a rather small anisotropy due to the dimeric nature of the particle leads to the increase of the size of the regions of anomalies .",
    "nevertheless , the increase of @xmath0 shrinks those regions @xcite .",
    "a possible explanation for this unexpected behavior is that , in conditions of low temperature and pressure , there is a decoupling of translational and rotational degrees of freedom when the interparticle separation is small .",
    "experimental works showed that when approaching the glass transition the translational and rotational dynamics are not equally affected @xcite .",
    "this behavior was also observed in computer simulations @xcite .    in order to test this hypothesis here",
    "we study a dimeric model where each particle in the dimer interacts with the particles in the other dimers through a core - softened potential .",
    "we define translational and non - translational temperatures as tools to evaluate the role of translational and non - translational degrees of freedom .",

    "this result raises questions about the influence of anisotropy on the phase and anomalous behavior . in principle",
    "one could expect that by increasing the anisotropy by enlarging @xmath0 the solid - fluid phase boundary , the tmd line and the diffusion anomalous region would move to higher temperatures . in order to check this assumption we carried out a detailed set of simulations of rigid dumbbells interacting with the potential described above with @xmath46 @xcite .",

    "based on these observation we raised the hypothesis that the shrinking of the region of solid phase is related to a decoupling between translational and non - translational motions .    in order to test our hypothesis",
