    "quasars are luminous , accreting supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) that are thought to reside at the center of almost every massive galaxy ( e.g. , salpeter 1964 ; zeldovich & novikov 1964 ; lynden - bell 1969 ; kormendy & richstone 1995 ; richstone et al.1998 ) . despite their high luminosities and perhaps different bh fuelling mechanism ,",
    "quasars are no different from their low - luminosity counterparts , active galactic nuclei ( agns ) : they both represent stages of building up smbhs , and they interact with the host galaxies in a self - regulated way ( e.g. , silk & rees 1998 ; magorrian et al .",

    "2006 ) . therefore understanding the properties of quasars / agns , such as their abundance ( luminosity function ) , spatial distributions ( clustering ) , physical properties ( spectral energy distributions ; black hole masses , etc . ) and the dependence of these properties on redshift , is crucial to understand galaxy formation and smbh growth within the standard hierarchical structure formation framework .    in this work we focus on the spatial clustering of quasars .",
    "similar to galaxies , quasars can be used to trace the large - scale distribution of the underlying dark matter .",
    "because of their high luminosity , quasars can be seen at redshift @xmath8 in a single survey , allowing them to be used to map the dark matter ( dm ) distribution over this entire redshift range . however , owing to the enormously large spatial volume probed and the fact that the quasar number density is much smaller than that of galaxies , the analysis of quasar clustering has only become practical in recent years , namely after large - scale surveys such as the 2df quasi - stellar object ( qso ) redshift survey ( 2qz , croom et al.2004 ) and the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , york et al .",
    "results on quasar clustering have been reported using the 2qz samples ( e.g. , porciani , magliocchetti & norberg 2004 ; croom et al .",
    "2005 ; da ngela et al . 2005 ; porciani & norberg 2006 ) , the sdss samples ( e.g. , myers et al . 2006 , 2007a , 2007b ; shen et al .",

    "2008 ) sample ( e.g. , da ngela et al . 2008 ) .",
    "complementary to these results , quasar clustering has also been studied through cross - correlations with large galaxy samples ( e.g. , adelberger & steidel 2005 ; coil et al .",
    "2007 ; padmanabhan et al . 2008 ) , and surveys for close quasar pairs ( e.g. , hennawi et al . 2006 ; myers et al . 2008 ) .    while the statistics of quasar clustering are not yet comparable to those of local galaxy clustering , recent measurements of the quasar two - point correlation function ( cf ) already offer valuable information about the physical properties of quasars , such as their host dark matter halo masses and duty cycles .",
    "the amplitude of the quasar correlation function suggests that quasars live in massive dark matter halos , and therefore are biased tracers of the underlying dark matter ( e.g. , kaiser 1984 ; bardeen et al .",
    "1986 ) ; the bias increases with increasing redshift ( e.g. , croom et al . 2005 ; myers et al . 2007a ; shen et al .",
    "2007a ; da ngela et al .",
    "2008 ; ross et al .",
    "2008 ) . by comparing the relative abundance of quasars and host halos",
    ", one can infer the average duty cycles of quasar activity ) , but the fraction of such companion quasars gives a negligible contribution to the quasar luminosity function as revealed in dedicated binary quasar surveys ( e.g. , hennawi et al .",
    "2006 ; myers et al .",
    "therefore no detailed halo occupation distribution modeling is needed to connect the halo abundance to the quasar luminosity function through the duty cycle . on the other hand",
    ", this simple halo model assumes that halo mass is the only parameter that determines the clustering properties of dark matter halos .",
    "recently it has been suggested that halo clustering also depends on the assembly history and recent merger activity ( e.g. , gao et al .",
    "2005 ; wechsler et al .",
    "2006 ; furlanetto & kamionkowski 2006 ; wetzel et al . 2007 ) ; such effects will complicate the interpretation of quasar clustering measurements ( e.g. , wyithe & loeb 2008 ) .",
    "nevertheless we neglect these complications in the current work , since the magnitude of such effects is still quite uncertain at this moment . ]",

    "2008 ; padmanabhan et al .",
    "2008 ) , and the estimated quasar lifetime is between a few myr and @xmath10 yr .",
    "quasar clustering measurements have also facilitated several theoretical investigations on the cosmic evolution of smbhs within the hierarchical structure formation paradigm ( e.g. , hopkins et al .",

    "previous investigations also examined the potential luminosity dependence of quasar clustering .",
    "if quasar luminosity is a good indicator of the host halo mass , then more luminous quasars live in more massive halos , and hence should have stronger clustering .",
    "however , the current observations only show weak luminosity dependence of quasar clustering at @xmath11 ( e.g. , adelberger & steidel 2005 ; croom et al .",
    "2005 ; porciani & norberg 2006 ; myers et al .",
    "2007a ; da ngela et al .",
    "2008 ) , albeit with large error bars and , in most cases , limited dynamical range ( @xmath12 dex in luminosity ) .",
    "if indeed quasar clustering depends only weakly on luminosity , then low luminosity quasars can also live in high mass halos and vice versa , which means there is substantial scatter in the host halo mass  quasar luminosity relation .",
    "this is naturally expected in some evolutionary quasar models , where quasar luminosity also depends on the evolving accretion rate onto the smbh ( e.g. , hopkins et al .",
    "2005 ; hopkins et al . 2006 ; shen et al .",
    "2007b ) . based on numerical simulations of quasar light curves and prescriptions for the relation between quasar peak luminosity and host halo mass , lidz et al .",
    "( 2006 ) were able to show a weak luminosity dependence of quasar clustering at @xmath13 for intermediate luminosity ranges .",
    "they argue that the peak luminosity is a better tracer of the host halo mass than the instantaneous luminosity , although in practice one can only observe the instantaneous luminosity .    an alternative approach is to study quasar clustering as a function of black hole mass , which might better correlate with host halo mass than luminosity ( e.g. , ferrarese 2002 ; baes et al .",
    "unfortunately for most quasars , the only estimates of their bh mass are virial bh masses ( e.g. , mclure & jarvis 2002 ; vestergaard & peterson 2006 ; shen et al .",
    "2008c ) , which are based on broad line widths and continuum luminosities measured from single - epoch spectra .",
    "substantial uncertainties and biases exist for these estimates ( e.g. , shen et al .",
    "2008b ) , and any potential difference in clustering may be washed out by these complications ( see the discussion in  [ subsec : bh_vir_vs_mhalo ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , we will use these virial bh mass estimates to test any dependence of quasar clustering on bh mass , which in turn can offer some insight on the accuracy of these virial mass estimates .",
    "there are also sub - classes of quasars that show characteristic properties different from the `` regular '' quasar population .",
    "quasars have a distribution of colors at a given redshift . using a sample of 4576 uniformly - selected quasars from sdss , richards et al .",
    "( 2003 ) found that at each redshift the @xmath14 color follows an approximate gaussian distribution with a red tail , and they proposed to use the deviation from the median @xmath14 color as a redshift - independent color indicator .",
    "thus quasars can be divided into blue , red and reddened populations ( e.g. , richards et al .",
    "2003 ) , where the reddened population is most likely dust - reddened in the quasar host galaxy ( e.g. , hopkins et al .",
    "there are also significant differences ( at least in the ensemble average ) between the emission line properties for blue and red quasars ( e.g. , richards et al .",
    "moreover , a small fraction ( @xmath15 ) of quasars are radio - loud , although they have similar optical properties to radio - quiet quasars . it will be interesting to study their clustering properties for these quasar sub - classes to see if their large - scale environment is responsible for their different properties .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to investigate various dependences of quasar clustering using a homogeneous spectroscopic sample drawn from the sdss fifth data release ( dr5 , adelman - mccarthy et al .",
    "in particular we focus on the dependences on luminosity , virial bh mass , quasar color and radio loudness .",

    "quasar candidates for spectroscopy are selected from the imaging data using their colors ( richards et al.2002 ) , and are arranged in spectroscopic plates ( blanton et al.2003 ) to be observed and confirmed with a pair of double spectrographs .",
    "the sdss spectroscopy prohibits two targets closer than @xmath26 to be assigned spectroscopic fibers on one plate due to fiber collision . although serendipitous close pairs can be observed on overlap plates ( hennawi et al .",

    "we take the dr5 spectroscopic quasar catalog ( schneider et al . 2007 ) as our parent sample from which we draw our clustering samples .",

    "about half of the quasars in this catalog were selected from a uniform algorithm ( as described in richards et al .",

    "our final clustering sample thus includes all uniformly - selected quasars with limiting magnitude @xmath29 at @xmath37 and @xmath31 at @xmath38 .",
    "this homogeneous clustering sample includes 38,208 quasars covering the redshift range @xmath39 ; the angular coverage of this sample is identical to the high-@xmath35 ( @xmath38 ) quasar sample studied in shen et al .",

    "the sparseness of the sample directly impacts our strategy of measuring the correlation function and estimating its error .",

    "first of all , the underlying cf is not a perfect power - law at all scales ; even if it were , because of the statistical fluctuations of cf data for sparse samples , the best - fit parameters of power - law models would depend on the fitting range .",
    "hence the best - fit parameters should be quoted with fitting ranges . secondly ,",
    "for most of our subsamples the data are of insufficient quality for a flexible power - law - index fit , hence we have fixed the power - law indices to be @xmath87 and @xmath88 , close to the observed values ( e.g. , porciani et al .",
    "2004 ; croom et al . 2005",
    "; shen et al .",
    "thirdly , occasionally some cf data points are negative due to statistical fluctuations or unknown systematics ; including those negative points are necessary , but , because of these outliers and the nature of power - law models , the @xmath82 fit will have high model rejection probability .",
    "hence we perform fits both with and without negative cf data points within the fitting range . for most of the cases the resulting correlation lengths",
    "are consistent within @xmath89 errors , but there are exceptions . given the possibility that some of the negative points might be caused by systematic effects ( i.e. , close to the redshift deserts or at characteristic scales of preferentially losing pairs ) , we believe the actual clustering strength should lie somewhere in between these two limits .",

    "porciani & norberg 2006 ; da ngela et al .",
    "2008 ; ross et al .",
    "2008 ) owing to the uncertainties in the clustering measurements for individual redshift bins , high redshift ( @xmath32 ) sdss quasars have much stronger clustering than their low redshift ( @xmath11 ) counterparts ( shen et al .",
    "2007a ) , reflecting the large bias of their host halos .",
    "we have performed independent clustering measurements using our redshift bins indicated in the left panel of fig . [",

    "we see a slight trend of increasing clustering with redshift at @xmath2 , but the uncertainties are large in each redshift bin .      at each redshift",
    "our sample spans a range in luminosity ( typically @xmath245 magnitudes ) .",
    "hence the next question is whether or not quasar clustering depends on luminosity . on theoretical grounds ,",
    "if quasar luminosity perfectly correlates with host halo mass , we expect that higher - luminosity quasars live in more massive halos and therefore are more strongly clustered",
    ". weak dependence of quasar clustering on luminosity would imply that a quasar s luminosity is not a good tracer of its halo mass  there is substantial scatter in @xmath246 and/or @xmath247 correlations ( e.g. , lidz et al .",
    "observationally an important caveat is that the errors on the clustering measurements must be small enough that any difference caused by varying host halo mass is discernible .",
    "no strong luminosity dependence has yet been reported ( e.g. , adelberger & steidel 2005 ; porciani & norberg 2006 ; myers et al .",
    "2007a ; da ngela et al .",
    "2008 ) ; but most of the studies are for @xmath11 and the error bars are large .",
    "we attack this problem by first examining the @xmath67 samples divided by the median luminosity at each redshift (  [ subsec : sample ] and the top - left panel of fig .",

    "this is somewhat expected since the halo bias factor increases rapidly with mass .",
    "if these brightest quasars live in the rarest and most massive halos , their clustering will be appreciably stronger than the fainter quasars , an effect that is detectable even with our current sample size .",
    "finally we compare the clustering in each luminosity - redshift bin as indicated in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : z_l_bh_div ] , since the luminosity dependence of clustering may evolve with redshift .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lz_fine ] . given the large uncertainties , no appreciable luminosity dependence is observed in any of the redshift bins . the comparison of different luminosity samples becomes increasingly difficult at high redshift , and hence we defer the discussion of the luminosity dependence of clustering at @xmath38 to  [ subsec : ml_cf ] .    for the overall quasar population , one can also compare the clustering amplitudes between our sample and the 2qz/2slaq samples ( e.g , porciani et al .",
    "2004 ; croom et al . 2005 ; porciani & norberg 2006 ; da ngela et al . 2008 ) or the sdss photometric quasar samples ( e.g. , myers et al . 2006 , 2007a ) .",
    "for the same redshift ranges at @xmath11 , all samples have comparable clustering amplitude within the error bars .",
    "the average luminosity is the highest for our sdss spectroscopic quasar sample and the lowest for the 2slaq sample ( differing by a factor of * @xmath249 * ) , which also indicates weak luminosity dependence of quasar clustering at @xmath11 for all but the highest luminosities .",
    "we discuss the implications of this weak luminosity dependence at @xmath250 in  [ sec : diss ] .",
    "we have divided the sample in virial bh masses using the measurements from shen et al .",

    "quasars have a range of eddington ratios at fixed bh mass ( e.g. , kollmeier et al .",

    "if bh mass is a superior tracer of its host halo mass , we might expect a bh mass dependence of quasar clustering .",
    "we test this possibility using virial bh masses measured from single - epoch quasar spectra .",
    "however , we note that virial bh masses are _ not _ true bh masses ( see the extensive discussion in shen et al . 2008b ) . the scatter between virial and true bh masses may also dilute any potential clustering dependence , which we will return to in  [ subsec : bh_vir_vs_mhalo ] .    as in the luminosity dependence case , we show the comparison of our @xmath67 _ high mass _ and _ low mass _ samples in fig .",
    "[ fig : bh_dep ] . while there is some indication that the _ high mass _ sample has a stronger clustering amplitude in redshift space , it is completely consistent with no difference in the projected correlation function ( see table [ table : cf_result ] for the best - fit @xmath251 values ) .",

    "[ fig : bh_dep ] .",
    "the difference in the clustering strength for the cross - correlation of the @xmath68 most massive quasars and the auto - correlation of the remaining @xmath188 is significant at the @xmath248 level ( see table [ table : cf_result ] ) .",

    "[ fig : z_l_bh_div ] ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : bhz_fine ] .",
    "again no appreciable mass dependence is observed , although the s / n is poor in most bins .",
    "quasars have different colors , either intrinsic or dust reddened . as discussed in ",

    "the reddened quasars have similar clustering amplitude .",
    "thus our data indicate there is weak or no dependence of quasar clustering on colors .",

    "using our @xmath67 first - detected and undetected samples as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : radio_div ] , we show their clustering comparison in fig .",
    "[ fig : radio_dep ] , where we use auto - correlation for the first - undetected quasars and cross - correlate them with the first - detected quasars .",
    "the first - detected quasars are appreciably more strongly clustered ( cross correlation length @xmath253 ) than the first - undetected quasars ( @xmath254 ) , which indicates that radio quasars live in more massive dark matter halos .",
    "these first - detected quasars also tend to have systematically larger virial bh masses than those first - undetected quasars by @xmath255 dex ( e.g. , shen et al .",
    "however , the difference in their clustering remains when we consider a radio - undetected quasar sample with virial masses matched to those of the radio sample .",
    "thus more massive host halos , and denser environments may be related to the triggering of radio activity .      at the smallest separations ,",
    "there is only a handful of pairs distributed among the bins , hence binning effects may become important , and the usage of the projected correlation function @xmath80 becomes questionable . here",
    "we design a maximum - likelihood ( ml ) method to use in this situation .",

    "hence we examine different ranges of @xmath279 $ ] for each sample .",
    "we then minimize @xmath280 with respect to @xmath281 and obtain its @xmath89 uncertainty .",
    "again , because of the noisy data we fix @xmath282 in our fitting procedure .    compared with binned cfs , the ml procedure has several drawbacks .",
    "the information from pairs with large separations ( @xmath283 ) is not used , and the merits of the ml method suffer if there is a paucity of pairs due to systematic effects ( see below ) . for these reasons , we only apply this ml method and compare the ml estimates with our binned cf results as a consistency check ( see table [ table : cf_result ] ) .",
    "we start with the two luminosity bins at @xmath141 shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : z_l_bh_div ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig : highz_ldep ] we show the binned cfs for these two luminosity bins . on small scales ( @xmath284mpc ) , an apparent deficit of correlation is seen for the fainter bin with respect to the brighter bin . on larger scales ,",
    "the signal - to - noise ratios of the cfs are too small to distinguish any difference in clustering strength . for the ml approach we choose a comoving volume of a cylinder annulus with half - height @xmath259mpc and @xmath274=[2,15]\\ h^{-1}$]mpc , @xmath110\\ h^{-1}$]mpc , and @xmath151\\ h^{-1}$]mpc .",
    "the best fit ml correlation lengths are listed in table [ table : cf_result ] , which show no detectable correlations at small scales ( @xmath284mpc ) for the fainter bin , consistent with the binned cf results .",
    "the relative paucity of small - separation pairs in the fainter @xmath141 luminosity bin is much stronger than seen in the @xmath285 luminosity bins .",
    "however , we suspect this is at least partly caused by some not well - understood systematic effects in our sample .",
    "the lower redshift cut @xmath286 is close to the redshift desert at @xmath51 where the quasar selection efficiency drops .",
    "the completeness becomes worse close to the magnitude cut @xmath31 at @xmath287 , as seen in our sample ( also see fig .",
    "17 of richards et al .",
    "as we argued above , image quality becomes important in selecting quasars close to the faint magnitude cut , and preferential loss of quasar pairs with similar colors is possible .",
    "therefore we do not claim that the apparent weaker clustering of fainter quasars at @xmath141 and at scales @xmath288mpc is significant . on the other hand ,",
    "our sample is unable to give clear evidence of a dependence of clustering on luminosity at large scales at @xmath289 because of the sample sparseness .",
    "we hope that ongoing and future surveys of high - redshift quasars at the faint luminosity end can help resolve these issues .",
    "we now apply the ml method to several subsamples in different redshift bins , and compare the results with those using binned method in table [ table : cf_result ] .",
    "the ml method yields results consistent with the binned method within error bars .",
    "in fact , the difference in the best - fit values of @xmath290 for various fitting ranges in the ml approach is fully reflected in the binned cf data points , i.e. , we get small values of @xmath290 for fitting ranges where the binned cf data points fall below the power - law fit .",
    "we now discuss the dependences ( or lack thereof ) of quasar clustering on various quantities that we have found .",
    "our clustering measurements of various subsamples are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : bias_compile ] in terms of the bias factor .",
    "the goal is to compare the observed clustering measurements with theoretical predictions ; or alternatively , to use these measurements to constrain theoretical models , i.e. , the form and scatter of various relations , such as relations of true bh mass versus host halo mass , luminosity versus true bh mass / host halo mass , and virial bh mass versus true bh mass , etc .",
    "we assume that halo mass is the only relevant quantity that correlates with clustering strength .",
    "hence the question in any theoretical model is how to populate halos with quasars of various physical properties ( luminosity , bh mass etc ) , given constraints from the halo abundance , the quasar luminosity function and quasar clustering .      in this subsection",

    "generally there will be a malmquist - type bias because of the scatter @xmath294 and the bottom - heavy halo mass function .",
    "but the exact magnitude of this bias as function of luminosity also depends on the halo duty cycle @xmath299 , which itself may well be a function of halo mass and redshift , and is constrained via the quasar luminosity function : @xmath301 therefore given the assumed correlation eqn .",

    "we also must know the linear halo bias factor @xmath303 as function of halo mass in order to make clustering predictions .",
    "this is somewhat problematic , as noted in white et al .",
    "various fitting functions for the halo bias exist in the literature , which differ in both magnitude and shape ( e.g. , mo & white 1996 ; jing 1998 ; sheth & tormen 1999 ; sheth et al .",

    "2005 ; basilakos et al .",

    "one needs a halo bias formula that is tested against large numerical simulation sets at the ranges of halo mass and redshift of interest ( e.g. , see the discussion in shankar et al .",
    "finally the effective bias factor of quasars at fixed luminosity is the average over all the halos that host them : @xmath304 which is to be compared with observations .",
    "the correlation in eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : l_m ] ) is analogous to a light bulb model in which a quasar shines at a more or less fixed luminosity ( i.e. , a fraction of the eddington luminosity of its smbh ) when it is on , with a log - normal scatter @xmath294 in luminosity .",
    "theoretical models predict a scaling @xmath305 or @xmath306 depending on energy conservation ( e.g. , silk & rees 1998 ; wyithe & loeb 2002 ) or momentum conservation ( e.g. , king 2003 ) during self - regulated black hole growth .",

    "uncertainties in the quasar luminosity function , halo bias factor , and halo mass function , which are all needed to make a self - consistent model , further obscure the situation .",
    "since the halo bias factor increases very rapidly with mass , various models are sensitive at the high - luminosity end of quasar clustering .",

    "we then use equation ( [ eqn : mi_lbol ] ) to simulate the @xmath42band absolute magnitudes and impose the sdss magnitude cut ( @xmath29 at @xmath67 ) until we achieve the same redshift distribution of observed virial bh masses as shown in fig .",

    "our clustering measurements of reddened , red and blue quasar populations show consistent results , with differences that are undiscernible given our uncertainty levels .",
    "a weak dependence on color is expected if the color of a quasar is determined by the physical conditions in the host galaxy of the smbh more than by its large - scale environment . also , there is no strong correlation of color with either luminosity or bh mass , indicating that this diversity in quasar color occurs at all mass scales that our sample probes .",

    "( 2003 ) and hopkins et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , and there is a strong connection between dust - reddening and broad absorption line quasars ( balqsos ; e.g. , reichard et al .",

    "the relative bias factor of radio - detected to radio - undetected quasars is @xmath336 , using the correlation length values in table 1 .",

    "accurate determinations of the host halo masses for the radio - loud and radio - quiet populations again require better clustering measurements and robust halo bias factor from simulations .",

    "both studies find that for comparable virial bh masses ( or galaxy properties ) , radio quasars / agns reside in more massive halos than their regular counterparts , indicating that radio quasars / agn may follow a different bh - halo relation from the normal population .",
    "we have performed clustering measurements of quasars from a uniformly selected sample in the fifth data release of sdss , and focussed on the dependences of quasar clustering on luminosity , virial bh mass , quasar color and radio loudness .      1",
    ".   strong luminosity dependence of quasar clustering at @xmath2 is _ not _ detected for typical quasar luminosities .",
    "while this is consistent with several theoretical predictions , we caution that the dynamical range in luminosity probed in our sample is narrow and our current sample size ( especially when split in luminosity / redshift ) is not yet large enough to yield accurate clustering measurements . however , the @xmath68 most luminous quasars in our sample are more strongly clustered , which is likely caused by the fact that halo bias increases rapidly with mass at the high mass end .",
    "the final data release of sdss - ii ( dr7 , abazajian et al . 2008 ) will double the spectroscopic quasar sample size and boost the clustering signal by a factor of @xmath343 , thus providing superior results over the current study .",
    "our measurements show weak or no dependence of quasar clustering on virial bh mass at @xmath2 .",
    "this is at least partly due to the fact that virial masses are scattered around true bh masses , where only the latter are presumably correlated with host halo masses .",
    "the limited dynamical range in bh mass and our limited sample size are other barriers to detecting this mass dependence .",
    "however , even if we have accurate bh mass estimates , the dependence of quasar clustering on bh mass may still be weak if there is substantial scatter around the relation between bh mass and halo mass .",
    "thus the combination of precise bh mass estimates ( i.e. , improved virial or new bh mass estimators ) and high - quality clustering measurements in future surveys can be used to test how smbhs grow in dark matter halos in the hierarchial structure formation framework .",

    "radio - loud quasars are more strongly clustered than are radio - quiet quasars .",
