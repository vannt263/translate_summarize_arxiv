    "the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmb ) plays an essential role in modern cosmology .",
    "improved observations of the structure in the cmb should allow one to distinguish between rival theories of structure formation , and , in the case of the inflationary scenario , to determine the spectrum of primordial scalar ( density ) and tensor ( gravitational wave ) perturbations .",
    "vector perturbations are expected to leave a significant imprint on the cmb only in the presence of active seeds , such as the defect models considered in  @xcite .",
    "the calculation of cmb anisotropies in specific cosmological models is now a large industry . for a representative sample of the literature dealing with the imprint of scalar perturbations , see e.g.  @xcite@xcite ; for tensor perturbations see e.g.  @xcite@xcite .",
    "early calculational schemes were based on linear perturbation theory in the synchronous gauge  @xcite , with legendre expansions of the relativistic distribution functions  @xcite .",
    "some technical improvements in these schemes resulted from the use of gauge - invariant variables  @xcite , and , more recently , from improved normal mode expansions of the distribution functions  @xcite .",
    "adopting gauge - invariant variables frees one from the need to keep track of the implications of any residual gauge freedom in the calculation ( the so called gauge problem ; see e.g.  @xcite ) , while improvements in the normal mode expansions have led to more direct characterisations of the anisotropy in vector and tensor modes , and a simpler form for the anisotropic thomson scattering terms than is possible with the traditional legendre expansion .",
    "recently , the 1 + 3 covariant and gauge - invariant approach to perturbations in cosmology , developed by ellis and coworkers  @xcite from the covariant hydrodynamics of ehlers  @xcite , has been applied to problems in cmb physics  @xcite@xcite .",
    "the 1 + 3 covariant approach provides a very convenient framework within which to study the exact intrinsic dynamics of cosmological models .",
    "the approach is formulated at the level of variables that are covariantly defined in the real universe , and are ( exactly ) gauge - invariant by construction , thus freeing one from many of the limitations of previous methodologies .",
    "furthermore , the approach admits a covariant and gauge - invariant linearisation that allows linearised calculations to be performed in a very direct manner . in",
    "@xcite a general 1 + 3 covariant scheme for the calculation of linearised cmb anisotropies was developed ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "a complete , closed set of equations , that fully describe the linearised evolution of inhomogeneity and anisotropy in an almost - friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) universe with arbitrary spatial curvature , were presented .",
    "these equations were subsequently extended to include non - linear terms in  @xcite , where some qualitative implications of non - linear effects were also noted .",
    "a significant feature of the covariant approach is the unified way in which scalar , vector and tensor perturbations are handled ; the general perturbation equations are formulated without recourse to a decomposition into scalar , vector and tensor modes , although such a decomposition can still be made , if required , at a late stage in the calculation . in",
    "@xcite the detailed equations describing scalar modes were derived from the unified equations , along with the necessary machinery to calculate the power spectrum of the cmb temperature anisotropy from a solution of these equations .",
    "it is our purpose here to report the extension of the 1 + 3 covariant analysis to tensor modes .",
    "we shall see that , in addition to the advantages of gauge - invariance and physical clarity that are evident in the scalar calculation , the tensor calculation highlights further advantages of the covariant approach over more traditional treatments .",
    "namely , in the present approach a normal mode expansion of the radiation distribution function arises naturally that has the virtue of maintaining a direct characterisation of the power in the cmb at a given multipole @xmath0 , and of preserving the simple quadrupolar nature of that part of the thomson scattering source terms that arises from the angular dependence of the thomson cross section .",
    "similar advantages are shared by the recently introduced total angular momentum method  @xcite .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows . in section  [ sec_cov ]",
    "we briefly review the 1 + 3 covariant approach to cosmological perturbations in an almost - frw model , radiative transfer , and the decomposition of the cmb sky in angular multipoles .",
    "section  [ sec_gw ] begins with a discussion of the covariant description of gravitational waves in cosmology , and presents linearised wave equations , valid for a general matter stress - energy tensor , for the electric and magnetic parts of the weyl tensor and the shear .",
    "these equations extend the perfect - fluid equations given in  @xcite . following an expansion in tensor harmonics , in section  [ sec_sol ] we give analytic solutions for the shear and the weyl tensor during matter and radiation domination , extending the solutions given in  @xcite to the case of non - flat spatial sections .",
    "we also provide the integral solutions to the mode - expanded radiation multipole equations in the general case . in section  [ sec_pow ]",
    "we derive the cmb power spectrum in terms of the mode - expanded multipole moments , and present numerical solutions in open cdm models , verifying the results in  @xcite .",
    "we close in section  [ sec_conc ] with our conclusions .",
    "[ appa ] contains useful new results on the symmetric trace - free representation of the tensor harmonics which we use in sections  [ sec_sol ] and  [ sec_pow ] .",

    "round brackets denote symmetrisation on the enclosed indices , square brackets denote antisymmetrisation , and angle brackets denote the projected symmetric trace - free ( pstf ) part .",
    "we use units with @xmath5 throughout , so that the constant in the einstein equation is @xmath6 .",
    "it should be noted that our convention for the metric signature , which coincides with that in our earlier work on cmb anisotropies in the 1 + 3 covariant approach  @xcite , differs from much of the 1 + 3 covariant literature .",
    "it is straightforward to transform from our conventions to those in  @xcite : @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and so @xmath9 .",
    "it follows that @xmath10 , but for the ricci scalar @xmath11 .",
    "the matter stress - energy tensor @xmath12 is unchanged , as is the fundamental velocity ( vector ) field @xmath13 of the cosmological model . raising or lowering an index incurs a sign change when transforming between signatures .",
    "the transformations of other key geometric objects are discussed in the text as they are introduced .",
    "the essence of the 1 + 3 covariant approach is to identify a set of covariant variables which conveniently describe the inhomogeneity and anisotropy of the universe in a physically transparent ( gauge - invariant ) manner .",
    "having chosen such variables , exact equations governing their dynamics can be found from the full field equations . since the variables are chosen to have a direct physical interpretation , the physical content of their dynamical equations is often simple to extract .",
    "if required , the exact equations can be linearised around a chosen background to yield a simple set of perturbation equations that describe the evolution of physically relevant measures of the inhomogeneity and anisotropy of the universe in a very direct fashion .",
    "the approach employs a 1 + 3 decomposition of geometric quantities with respect to a ( fundamental ) timelike velocity field @xmath13 .",
    "we require that , in a general cosmological model , @xmath13 be chosen in a physical manner such that in the frw limit it correctly reduces to the preferred velocity .",
