    "the recent lhc data on hadron production in proton - proton ( @xmath1 ) and nucleus - nucleus ( @xmath2 ) scattering @xcite shows that gluon saturation that follows both from the bfkl pomeron calculus @xcite and from the color glass condensate ( cgc ) approach @xcite , gives an adequate description of the high energy scattering in qcd . the model based on the gluon saturation was able to predict the hadron production at @xmath3 @xcite",
    "( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) and the experimental data both for @xmath1 @xcite and @xmath2 collisions @xcite confirmed the basic qualitative predictions of this approach @xcite .",
    "however , the recently reported data from the alice collaboration @xcite on hadron production in @xmath2 collisions also demonstrated that we are far away from the high precision quantitative description .",
    "for example , the model that predicted @xmath4 data for @xmath1 scatterings and which also describes hera and rhic data , failed to describe the multiplicity in @xmath2 collisions @xcite with the same accuracy .",
    "this fact can not be considered as discouraging since @xmath2 collisions are more complicated qcd problem and moreover the other model calculations , based on the same ideas , were somehow able to describe the data @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , this gives rise to a question that whether despite of considerable progress in theory during the past two decades we are ready to give a reliable prediction in the framework of the high - density qcd .    in practice ,",
    "our theoretical description of hadron - hadron and nucleus - nucleus scatterings is based on two main ingredients : balitsky - kovchegov ( bk ) non - linear equation @xcite and @xmath5 factorization @xcite .",
    "however , the bk equation is not complete since it does not take into account the correct ( non - perturbative ) behaviour at large impact parameters and , because of this , it leads to the violation of the froissart theorem , see ref .",
    "@xcite where this problem discussed in details .",
    "a practical consequence of this is the fact that we may not be able to guarantee the accuracy better than @xmath6 ( if not worse ) @xcite from the application of the bk equation .",
    "having said that , the recent application of the bk equation to the description of hera data looks promising indeed @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath5 factorization is not reliable for dense - dense system scatterings @xcite and , strictly speaking , we can not apply this factorization neither to proton - proton nor to nucleus - nucleus scatterings at midrapidity .",
    "therefore , we are doomed to build models trying to get a feedback from the experimental data for a theoretical breakthrough .    as a first attempt toward understanding of the new lhc data on nucleus - nucleus collisions , one may compare the experimental data with the principal qualitative predictions of the gluon saturation .",
    "the cornerstone of such predictions is the fact that the multiplicity in @xmath1 and @xmath2 collisions are proportional to @xmath7 @xcite , where @xmath8 is the saturation scale , @xmath9 is the center - of - mass energy squared per nucleon pair and @xmath10 is free parameter to be fixed with other experiments like dis at hera .",
    "this indicates that the energy dependence of multiplicity in both @xmath1 and @xmath2 collisions should be the same , assuming that the atomic number or @xmath11 dependence of the saturation scale is factorizable from energy .",
    "this simple property is in accordance with rhic data @xcite .",
    "however , the new alice data shows that multiplicities in @xmath1 and @xmath2 collisions have a different energy power - law behaviour ( see ) .     and non - singlet diffractive @xmath1 collisions .",

    "the saturation curve for the @xmath2 collisions was calculated from having incorporated the effects of gluon - jet angular ordering which is important when the saturation scale @xmath14 gev , see the text for the details .",

    ", we will argue that indeed the recent lhc data on @xmath2 collisions at @xmath0 tev has already opened up a new qcd regime which requires further theoretical understanding than previously thought . here , we shall give a simple explanation of the different energy behaviour of the hadron multiplicity in @xmath2 and @xmath1 data at high energy based on the gluon saturation ( or the cgc ) scenario .    in the cgc approach",
    ", the hadron production goes in two stages : production of gluons and subsequently the decay of gluon - jet ( or mini - jet ) into hadrons .",
    "therefore , the multiplicity of the produced hadrons at pseudo - rapidity @xmath16 can be calculated as a convolution of these two stages ,    [ i1 ] & & n^gluon_h ( e_jet ) , + & & _ s q^2_s n^gluon_h(q_s ) , [ i11]where the first part @xmath17 gives the gluon jet production yield at rapidity @xmath18 ( in @xmath1 or @xmath2 collisions ) computable in the @xmath19 factorization scheme @xcite , and the second term @xmath20 is the average multiplicity of hadrons in the gluon jet with a jet energy @xmath21 ( see secs .",

    "the kinematics looks simpler in the center - of - mass of the produced gluon in which two gluons with the mean transverse momenta of the order of @xmath8 and the fraction of energy @xmath23 collide , producing the gluon which moves in the transverse plane with the value of its momentum of the order of @xmath8 .",

    "notice that the typical transverse momentum in is of the order of the saturation scale @xmath8 .",
    "the crucial ingredient which is essential to explain the different energy dependence of the multiplicity in @xmath1 from @xmath2 collisions originates from the experimental data for jet production in @xmath26 annihilation @xcite , namely @xmath20 is almost constant at energies of the gluon - jet less than about @xmath27 gev but starts to increase with the energy of the gluon - jet larger than @xmath27 gev , see and sec .",
    "for proton - proton collisions , the value of the saturation scale is smaller than @xmath27 gev and consequently @xmath20 does not give an additional energy dependence , while for nucleus - nucleus scatterings at high energies the saturation scale @xmath28 ( @xmath11 is the atomic number ) is larger than @xmath27 gev and @xmath20 increases leading to an additional non - negligible power - law energy dependence . this extra contribution accounts for the gluon - decay effect before hadronization and is missing in the @xmath19 factorization .     and quark @xmath29 jets in @xmath26 annihilation , as a function of the jet energy . for gluon jet",

    "ii , we introduce the missing gluon - decay cascade effect in the @xmath5 factorization . we also show that the observed power - law energy dependence of multiplicity in @xmath1 and @xmath2 collisions at the lhc is fully consistent with the saturation picture by inclusion of the gluon cascade angular - ordering effect . in sec iii",
    ", we generalize the @xmath5 factorization in order to incorporate this effect , and present our numerical results for the charged hadron multiplicity both in @xmath1 and @xmath35 collisions . as a conclusion , in sec .",
    "iv we highlight our main results .",
    "the @xmath19 factorization @xcite includes gluon emissions between the projectile and target , and also gluon radiation in the _ final _ initial - state from the produced gluons .",
    "the @xmath19 factorization accounts for the bfkl type gluon emissions , namely the parent gluon emits a cascade of gluons with their longitudinal momenta @xmath36 being progressively smaller while the transverse momenta @xmath37 of the parent and emitted gluons are the same .",
    "this leads to an angular ordering in the cascade shown in & & p^+>k_1^+>k_2^+> ... >k_n^+ , + & & p_t~k_t1~k_t2 ... ~k_tn , + & & _ 1<_2<_3< ... <_n .",
    "[ bf ] however , the other contribution of the gluon decay , in the final initial - state , before hadronization , stems from the kinematic region outside the bfkl emission regime where both emitted gluons are collinear to the emitter . in this kinematic region ,",
    "the angle between the gluon ( quark ) and the decay gluon @xmath38 is small and the main contribution of gluon - decay has an opposite angular ordering to the bfkl type gluon emissions given in eq .",

    "this angular ordering means that a gluon in a fully developed cascade can only emit inside a cone defined by the momenta of its first two immediate predecessors , similar to the well - known chudakov effect in qed @xcite .",
    "it is well - established fact from jet observables ( especially at small momentum fractions @xmath39 ) that soft and collinear logarithms summed by the modified leading logarithmic approximation ( mlla ) , together with angular ordering reproduces the most important features of qcd cascade @xcite .",
    "this combined with the local parton - hadron duality ( lphd ) also gives quantitative predictions for hadron multiplicity and spectra in @xmath26 and @xmath40 collisions over the whole momentum range down to momenta of a few hundred mev @xcite .",
    "the mlla contains systematically next - to - leading logarithmic corrections and incorporates single and double - logarithmic effects in the development of parton cascades @xcite .",
    "one should note that although the mlla angular - ordering kinematic region is quite important at the gluon ( quark ) decay stage , but it does not lead to the large double log contribution in the total cross - section and it contributes to the self - energy of the quark and , therefore , to the running qcd coupling in the case that we integrate over all produced gluons .",
    "therefore , this kinematic region is not included in the @xmath19 factorization formula and has to be considered separately , namely , summing of these double log for the gluon jet decay leads to the extra term @xmath20 in which can be calculated within the mlla approach . on the other hand ,",
    "the effect of propagation and interaction of the produced jet in the gluonic medium with the bfkl angular - ordering and its saturation effect have been already taken into account in the @xmath19 factorization .",

    "the experimental data are from the star collaboration @xcite .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",width=7,height=302 ]    after our paper , there has been recently an interesting paper by lappi @xcite on the same line .",
    "it is argued by the author of ref .",
    "@xcite that the ratio of @xmath128 in our approach is in conflict with the observed experimental data at rhic . here",
    "we would like to point out that this is not the case indeed .",
    "it is constructive first to recall the argument of ref .",
    "let us assume that based on the lphd picture one gluon produces @xmath129 charged hadrons after fragmentation .",
    "then based on only dimensionality argument we have , [ fff ] p_t & ~ & q_s / n , + & ~ & nq_s^2 , + where @xmath123 is the average transverse momentum and @xmath126 is the overlap area between the colliding nuclei in the transverse plane .",
    "from above we have @xmath130 .",
    "therefore in our approach , the ratio @xmath131 decreases for more central collisions in contrast to the kln type approach @xcite .",
    "first , notice that in our approach we have @xmath132 for @xmath133 gev corresponding to the excess of charged hadron production in the presence of jet - decay effects , see eqs .",
    "( [ i11],[c0 ] ) and . in",
    "( right ) we show the experimental data from the star collaboration @xcite for @xmath134 as a function of centrality .",
    "it is seen from that the ratio @xmath135 at @xmath136 tev au+au collisions decreases for more central collisions .",
    "we expect that based on our model , this ratio should further suppresses at the lhc in the central @xmath2 collisions .",
    "in the kln type approaches @xcite we have @xmath137 where @xmath138 while in our approach we have @xmath139 for the case that the saturation scale is @xmath140 gev .",
    "this follows from the fact we have @xmath141 and @xmath142 at large saturation scale , see eqs .",
    "( [ i11],[eee],[c0 ] ) . in (",
    "left ) we show the average transverse momenta as a function of @xmath143 .",
    "the star collaboration @xcite has found that the experimental data for the charged pion at different centralities can be described by @xmath144 where the constant @xmath145 gev was obtained from a fit and may be interpreted as primordial transverse momentum .",
    "it seems however that the obtained value of @xmath146 is rather large ( and the coefficient behind @xmath51 is abnormally small ) .",
    "such a rather large value for @xmath146 may be in contradiction with the notion of asymptotic deconfinement for a dense system , namely , the confinement radius increases with density @xcite . in , we show that a fit driven by our approach prefers a smaller primordial transverse momentum of about pion mass @xmath147 ( or even @xmath148 ) and it reasonably describes the same data within the error bars .",
    "notice that at small multiplicity for very peripheral collisions our fit and entire saturation formulation is questionable .",
    "finally , we should stress that the jet - decay effects brings rather small extra contribution which requires a more careful analysis than only a naive dimensionality argument .",
    "we showed in this paper , this extra contribution is important when the saturation scale is large and that is in accordance with the existing experimental data in various reactions .",
    "our main concern in this paper was the combine description of proton - proton and nuclear data in a contrast to the kln type approaches that deal mostly with nuclear reactions .",
    "we would like to thank alex kovner for useful discussions .",
