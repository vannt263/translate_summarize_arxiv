    "the problem of strongly correlated fermions is a long - standing opened question .",
    "recently progress in the resolution of the simplest model , namely the hubbard model in @xmath0 by the dynamical mean field approach ( dmf),@xcite @xcite marked a real breakthrough in the field .",
    "nevertheless , the lack of spatial dependence and the difficulties in including the @xmath1 corrections,@xcite and the low dimensionality or the anisotropic character of the experimental systems , justify the ongoing research on more realistic dimensions @xmath2 and 3 . in low dimension , especially @xmath2 ,",
    "one expects a strong @xmath3-dependence of the self - energy that is absent from @xmath0 calculations . in this paper",
    "we study the 3d isotropic hubbard model , using a formalism previously developed in 2d,@xcite@xcite named tpsc for two particle self consistent . in 2d , the tpsc approach has been shown to give reliable results in comparisons with monte carlo calculations for one and two - particle properties , static and dynamical quantities , for a whole range of parameters : for a general band filling , on the whole temperature range accessible to monte carlo simulations ( but probably not at very low temperature at half - filling in @xmath4 ) , from low up to intermediate value of @xmath5 , for the nearest neighbor model as well as for the @xmath6 case.@xcite the strengths of this approach rely on the respect of several benchmark properties : it fulfills the pauli principle and is conserving in the baym and kadanoff sense.@xcite it was shown in 2d to satisfy the mermin - wagner theorem .",
    "furthermore the tpsc approach is appealing due to its simplicity : the vertices retained in the particle - hole channels are static and local .",
    "apart from the 2d case , the highly anisotropic 3d case ( inter - plane hopping much less than in - plane one ) has been studied previously.@xcite it was found that the antiferromagnetic order can be established in the regime of incoherent 3d one - particle motion and the crossover between 2 and 3d was studied in details . in this paper",
    "we want to explore the magnetic properties of the isotropic 3d model , focusing on the paramagnetic phase and on the nel transition approached from the disordered side .",
    "we make comparisons with other approaches , including monte carlo results , and dmf approach for the hypercubic lattice .",
    "we also stress the qualitative difference between isotropic and anisotropic 3d cases , even for a local function as the double occupation factor .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we review the tpsc formalism for the particle - hole properties , namely spin and charge susceptibilities . sec .",
    "iii concerns the nel transition , and sec .",
    "iv is devoted to the temperature dependence of the double occupation factor from which all the magnetic properties follow .",
    "finally we summarize our conclusions in sec . v.",
    "an appendix details the calculation of the double occupation factor for a simple two - site model that enlightens the high - temperature lattice results .",
    "we start from the hubbard hamiltonian ,    @xmath7    where the operator @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) destroys ( creates ) an electron of spin @xmath10 at site @xmath11 , @xmath12 is the density operator , and @xmath13 is the symmetric hopping matrix . the on - site repulsion @xmath14 is the screened coulomb interaction , @xmath15 the chemical potential . for a while",
    "hopping parameters will be kept general .",
    "indeed the two - particle self - consistent formalism ( tpsc ) approach only requires a local interaction but can be applied to a general band structure .",
    "let us sketch the tpsc approach , fully developed in ref .",
    "@xcite and @xcite .",
    "the tpsc can be formulated in a closed form in the functional integral formalism.@xcite here we shall concentrate on the two - particle properties , and obtain the useful relations in the equation of motion approach . in the presence of a time , space and spin varying external field @xmath16 , a generalized green function can be defined:@xcite @xmath17   \\over   tr \\left [ e^{-\\beta h } t_\\tau s(\\beta )    \\right ] } , \\label { greenfun}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 means imaginary time ordering and @xmath19 all the field dependence is in @xmath20 and @xmath21 to obtain the spin and charge susceptibilities , the equation of motion for @xmath22 has to be evaluated",
    ". then in the linear response theory , the functional derivative with respect to @xmath16 is taken at zero field leading to : @xmath23 with the kinetic part @xmath24 all the operators in eqs .",
    "( [ derivee ] ) and ( [ deltac ] ) are at the same time @xmath25 and @xmath26 is a short - hand notation for averaging with @xmath20 as in eq .",
    "( [ greenfun ] ) .",
    "@xmath27 is opposite to @xmath28 , @xmath3 is a wave vector of an @xmath29-site lattice , and @xmath30 is the fourier transform of @xmath13 .",
    "the ansatz of the tpsc approach is to write , for the term proportional to @xmath14 in eq.([derivee ] ) , that the following approximation retains the main correlation effects : @xmath31 with the following definition : @xmath32 eq .",
    "( [ ansatz ] ) is exact when @xmath33 .",
    "the expansion of the functional derivative with respect to @xmath16 leads to @xmath34 since at zero field in the paramagnetic phase , the coefficient of the term proportional to @xmath35 cancels .    to get the spin susceptibility it remains to take @xmath36 , then to time- and site - fourier transform eq.([derivee ] ) , using eqs.([deltac ] ) to ( [ truc ] ) . from the definition",
    "@xmath37 the preceding equations lead to an effective rpa expression for the spin susceptibility @xmath38 with @xmath39 @xmath40 is the time- and site - independent version of eq.([gupdn ] ) .",
    "this @xmath41 and @xmath42 independence follows from the cancellation of the term proportional to @xmath43 which does not depend on the spin index , and disappears by summation on @xmath28 : @xmath44 .",
    "as will be recalled later , @xmath40 can be evaluated in a self - consistent equation dictated by sum rules . for the charge",
    "susceptibilities the term proportional to @xmath45 does nt cancel , and one obtains a @xmath46 and @xmath42-dependent renormalized interaction .",
    "however further simplification consisting in taking a @xmath46 and @xmath42-constant renormalized vertex for charge @xmath47 , where @xmath48 can be self - consistently evaluated using exact sum rules , has been shown to give reasonable results in comparison to monte carlo simulations .",
    "the sum rules to determine self - consistently @xmath49 and @xmath50 follow from the the pauli principle and the fluctuation - dissipation theorem , here expressed in matsubara formalism @xmath51 and @xmath52 where @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 .",
    "the necessity to have two different irreducible vertices for spin and charge is imposed by the pauli principle .",
    "simple rpa for which the spin and charge susceptibilities differ only by a sign in the denominator can not fulfill these previous rules .",
    "although the susceptibilities have an rpa functional form , the physical properties of the theory are very different from rpa because of the self - consistency conditions for determining @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "this approach has been shown@xcite to take into account both the local quantum renormalization effects ( kanamori - brueckner screening ) which reduce the coulomb repulsion , and long - wavelength thermal fluctuations , giving a phase transition only at zero - temperature in two dimensions .",
    "this theory is self - consistent at the two - particle level ( hence its name ) , in contrast with flex@xcite for example , which is self - consistent at the one - particle level .",
    "in this paper we shall concentrate on magnetic properties for the nearest - neighbor model on a 3d - simple cubic lattice with a spacing @xmath56 , for which the dispersion relation reads @xmath57 with a bandwidth @xmath58 .",
    "the numerics only concern the half - filled band case , hence @xmath59 is maximum at @xmath60 due to the perfect nesting .",
    "the calculations are done on a variable mesh for the brillouin zone : @xmath61 on the coarse one , @xmath61 more points near @xmath62 , but as will be detailed below , some integrals are analytically evaluated , and the non - interacting susceptibility is finely evaluated at low temperature .",
    "we also present calculations on finite - size lattice for comparisons with monte carlo results .",
    "hereafter @xmath63 will be the energy unit , and we set @xmath64 .",
    "the tpsc formalism has been shown to give reliable results far from the transition and also in the part of the critical regime that is accessible to monte carlo calculations .",
    "important constraints such as the mermin - wagner theorem are fulfilled by the tpsc approach . indeed in 2d",
    "as the temperature goes down , @xmath49 decreases , thus preventing a finite - temperature magnetic transition .",
    "however deep in the low temperature regime at half - filling in 2d , the relation @xmath65 breaks down : there is no reason to believe that there is no double - occupied site in the ground state.@xcite in the highly anisotropic three - dimensional case with a small inter - plane hopping @xmath66 , a finite - temperature transition can be stabilized . here",
    "we shall concentrate on the isotropic case and make comparisons with other approaches developed for the 3d or for the infinite - dimensional hubbard model .    in 3d , at half filling , the self - consistent eq.([sumspin ] ) from which the magnetic properties will be evaluated , can be rewritten @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the asymptotic form of @xmath69 obtained from a taylor expansion around @xmath62 of the denominator and defined on a domain of radius @xmath70 around @xmath62 .",
    "this enables an analytic evaluation of the diverging part of the susceptibility . defining @xmath71 the mean - field critical value of @xmath14",
    "at which the transition occurs in a rpa treatment , and @xmath72 the small energy scale that measures the proximity to the phase transition in the tpsc approach , the asymptotic form of the spin susceptibility simply reads @xmath73 }   \\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\ ,   ,   \\label{chiasymp}\\ ] ] where @xmath74 is the magnetic correlation length defined in terms of a microscopic length @xmath75 : @xmath76 @xmath77 the nel transition is reached from above when @xmath78 .",
    "the tpsc approach validity is restricted from low up to intermediate value of the ratio @xmath5 .",
    "indeed it has been shown , and will be confirmed below , that @xmath49 saturates at strong coupling while one would expect @xmath49 to have a maximum as a function of @xmath14 , as suggested by rpa at low repulsion and by the heisenberg model limit at strong repulsion .",
    "nevertheless the reliability for @xmath79 in 2d has been established by comparisons with monte carlo calculations , and gives some confidence in 3d for the intermediate coupling regime .",
    "fig.1 presents @xmath80 as a function of @xmath14 in units of the hopping parameter @xmath81 .",
    "tpsc results are presented along with monte carlo,@xcite rpa , dynamical mean field results on an hypercubic lattice,@xcite@xcite spin - fluctuation formalism,@xcite and spin hamiltonian approach.@xcite@xcite the last one is a mapping of the hubbard model onto an heisenberg model with arbitrary - range , u - dependent exchange integrals @xmath82 , treated in an onsager reaction field method .",
    "the dmf results are scaled for comparisons with @xmath83 by @xmath84 ( details will be given in next section ) .",
    "usual rpa predicts an exponential behavior : @xmath85 where @xmath86 , and @xmath87 is the 3d dos at the fermi level . due to the same functional form",
    ", the tpsc formalism also predicts an exponential form for @xmath80 with @xmath14 replaced by @xmath49 .",
    "the saturation for @xmath88 of @xmath49 to the value @xmath89 leads to the saturation of @xmath80 as can be seen in fig.1 .",
    "@xmath90 is not the correct ansatz at large @xmath14 .",
    "recently there have been a few controversies concerning the nel temperature .",
    "one of these concerns the relevance of the rpa at weak coupling.@xcite@xcite a discrepancy was found in an infinite - dimensional approach with @xmath91 corrections in ref.@xcite , and in pure 3d formalism in ref.@xcite . from fig.1",
    "it appears that the tpsc curve merges with rpa results , but only at very small coupling .",
    "the modified stoner criterion used to obtain the nel temperature in ref.@xcite uses a maximally crossed diagram series which was shown to be not reliable close to half - filling in 2d.@xcite up to @xmath92 , tpsc and dmf approaches are very close .",
    "the second controversy @xcite concerns the interpretation of the monte carlo results : hasegawa@xcite has argued that the nel temperature extracted from the monte carlo simulations was overestimated , in fact it would be rather a mean - field temperature than a true @xmath80 .",
    "a indication of this can be seen at large @xmath14 , where the monte carlo is closer to the mean - field result @xmath93 , than to the high temperature series result @xmath94.@xcite however , as pointed out by hirsch @xcite this could be also an indication that the itinerant nature of the hubbard model persists up to large coupling , enhancing the transition temperature .",
    "we can not settle this debate at large @xmath14 , the tpsc being inappropriate in this regime , but even at low interaction , our results are not very close to the monte carlo points .",
    "the @xmath14 dependence of @xmath80 can be traced back using the self - consistency equation ( [ autoco ] ) .",
    "close to the phase transition the most important contribution is taken into account by the asymptotic form of the susceptibility . at @xmath80 @xmath95 , and",
    "@xmath96 simply reads @xmath97 for @xmath41 measured from @xmath62 .",
    "it then follows that the @xmath80 and @xmath14 dependence of eq.([autoco ] ) can be made explicit @xmath98 where @xmath70 is the radius of the sphere centered on @xmath62 where @xmath96 is defined , and @xmath99 is a short - hand notation for all terms which weakly depend on @xmath80 and @xmath14 .",
    "it has been shown@xcite that at low temperature @xmath100 scales as @xmath101 , in the two - dimensional case .",
    "this also holds for the 3d case where @xmath102 with @xmath103 .",
    "this behavior extends over a wide temperature domain including @xmath80 .",
    "it then follows that @xmath104 on the whole range of @xmath80 , the scaling behavior of @xmath105 can not be neglected and is set , for @xmath106 , by @xmath107 where @xmath108 .",
    "equation ( [ saturation ] ) establishes the nel temperature saturation .",
    "the tpsc formalism has been shown in @xmath109 dimensions to be in the same universality class as the berlin - kac spherical model,@xcite i.e. in the same class as the heisenberg n - component model with @xmath110 .",
    "the corresponding critical exponents in @xmath111 are : @xmath112 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 , @xmath115 , @xmath116 , @xmath117 .",
    "furthermore the dynamical exponent has been shown to be @xmath118 .",
    "these exponents were also found in the spin - hamiltonian approach treated in an onsager reaction field theory.@xcite the size of the critical region , i.e. for which @xmath119 , is quite narrow.@xcite well above the critical regime , the behavior of @xmath120 with @xmath121 remains roughly linear on the whole temperature range studied up to @xmath122 , even for small @xmath14 , and does not show any crossover to the rpa regime characterized by @xmath123.@xcite the linear behavior of @xmath120 at high temperature can be ascribed to @xmath75 , ( eqs.([ksi ] ) , ( [ ksi02 ] ) and ( [ xsi0 ] ) ) .",
    "however for high @xmath121 , the temperature behavior of @xmath124 is the mean - field one . indeed , from eq .",
    "( [ suscepsp ] ) , we have @xmath125 at high temperature @xmath126 slowly increases with @xmath121 ( see next section ) , and @xmath127 essentially behaves as @xmath128 .    to conclude this section we show in fig.2 the value of the local moment @xmath129 at @xmath80 as a function of @xmath14 .",
    "tpsc results are compared to dmf results.@xcite@xcite due to the saturation of @xmath49 , the moment does not fully develop at large @xmath14 in contrast with the dmf results and with what is expected from the heisenberg picture .",
    "nevertheless , up to @xmath130 , tpsc gives a very good agreement compared with @xmath0 results .",
    "the central quantity that determines the magnetic properties of the tpsc approach is the local correlation factor : @xmath131 , which is simply related to the fraction of doubly occupied sites and to the local magnetic moment @xmath132 ) .",
    "furthermore , @xmath126 is closely related to the self energy through the following identity @xcite @xmath133 where @xmath134 and @xmath135 are respectively the one - particle green s function and self - energy . from this exact relation , and in spite of the local nature of @xmath126 , one expects a strong dimensional effect due to the influence of the magnetic fluctuations on the self - energy @xmath135 in 2d.@xcite we are primarily interested in the isotropic 3d case , but we will also comment upon the 2 and anisotropic 3d cases .    in fig.3 the temperature dependence of @xmath136 predicted by tpsc for 3d , is displayed for various values of @xmath14 .",
    "as expected , increasing @xmath14 is very effective to reduce the fraction of doubly occupied sites . for @xmath88 , @xmath49 saturates and thus @xmath137 while it should decrease more rapidly with @xmath14 . in this regime",
    "the tpsc approach breaks down . at high temperature @xmath126",
    "slowly increases towards 1 , whereas on the low temperature side , we are limited to @xmath138 .",

    "@xmath126 has been evaluated in the dmf approach .",
    "@xcite , @xcite to make quantitative comparisons between tpsc and dmf results , one needs to use the kinetic energy scale @xmath140 .",
    "indeed , within the infinite - dimensional model on the hypercubic lattice , the hopping amplitude is scaled to keep @xmath141 finite , whereas the bandwidth is infinite.@xcite for a finite dimension d , averaging over the brillouin zone leads to @xmath142 . in the comparisons of the coupling dependence of @xmath126 at two temperatures",
    ", a quantitative agreement is found between the tpsc approach and the dmf results as reported in fig.4 .",
    "the tpsc curves correspond to @xmath143 and @xmath144 , i.e. they surround @xmath139 , whereas the infinite - dimensional results extracted from ref .",
    "@xcite , where @xmath145 , are for @xmath146 , and @xmath147 respectively .",
    "up to half the bandwidth ( @xmath148 in @xmath0 units ) , the numerical values are quite close .    in both dmf and 3d - tpsc approaches , a non - monotonous temperature behavior is observed : for @xmath14 not too strong , @xmath126 first begins to decrease before increasing at higher @xmath121 .",
    "the value of the temperature corresponding to this minimum @xmath139 marked by an arrow in fig.3 , is plotted in fig.5 and compared to the infinite - dimensional results.@xcite,@xcite they are quite compatible , since the error bars in fig.5 for the tpsc results come from the flatness of the curves . for dmf , @xmath149 for @xmath150 , whereas in 3d for @xmath151 , @xmath136 increases monotonously for @xmath138 , and can not be calculated within our approach for @xmath152 . as discussed by georges",
    "et krauth , @xcite the decrease of @xmath153 reflects an incipient localization tendency when the temperature increases .",
    "this type of behavior is made more acute in the mott transition , observed for example for the @xmath154 compound doped with @xmath155 : heating can drive the transition from metal to insulator @xcite ( but the hypothesis of a structural effect was raised @xcite ) .",
    "the same idea is at work in the liquid - solid transition in @xmath156he , in the so - called pomeranchuck effect : the spin entropy contribution is greater in the solid phase , and increasing the temperature can drive a transition to the solid state .    from eq.([self ] ) a strong dimensional effect is expected for @xmath157 , and it becomes interesting to compare the tpsc predictions for 2 , 3 and anisotropic 3d cases to the dmf results . to make comparisons between different finite dimensions d , we used again the energy scale @xmath158 rather than naively @xmath159 , ( we first used @xmath159 and obtained a poor agreement ) .",
    "@xmath158 is a better measure of the kinetic energy : it takes into account not only the bandwidth , but also the particular shape of the density of states .",
    "furthermore , this is the same scaling as the one previously used for comparisons between @xmath111 and @xmath0 . in the anisotropic 3d case ,",
    "the small inter - plane hopping @xmath66 does not strongly affect the kinetic energy , and as for the 2d case one has @xmath160 .    in fig.6",
    ", we show the temperature dependence of @xmath157 for the two , isotropic and anisotropic three - dimensional cases in the tpsc approach .",
    "the units on the figure are the 3d ones .",
    "we first focus on the 2 and isotropic 3d cases .",
    "the values of @xmath157 can not be distinguished for 2 and 3d at high temperature . at a temperature close to the arrows locating the minimum of the isotropic 3d case , the curves separate . at low temperature in 2d ,",
    "@xmath49 goes down when @xmath121 decreases .",
    "this behavior is confirmed by monte carlo calculations for the double occupation factor , @xcite@xcite and is a manifestation of the incipient antiferromagnetic fluctuations , as can be seen by inspection of eq.([sumspin ] ) : the increase of the spin susceptibility integral , leads to a decrease of the double occupation factor .",
    "this behavior is not clearly seen in the 3d case due to the very narrow range of the critical regime , and to the smaller effect of fluctuations in high dimensions .",
    "the temperature at which the 2 and 3d behaviors separate , close to @xmath139 , is higher than the crossover temperature which marks the entering of the critical regime characterized by a large correlation length,@xcite i.e. @xmath74 does not need to be large to see a strong dimensional effect .",
    "the non - monotonous temperature behavior of @xmath126 observed in 3d and @xmath0 cases , is also present but much less important in the 2d case for small interaction values , as revealed by a careful inspection of fig.6 for @xmath161 . in 2d",
    "the strong antiferromagnetic fluctuations prevent a sensible increase of @xmath126 when the temperature decreases .    in the anisotropic 3d case",
    ", a small inter - plane hopping @xmath162 can stabilize the ordered phase , but has no effect on the value of @xmath136 , as shown in fig.6 for @xmath163 , and @xmath164 ( 3d units ) : for @xmath165 the 2d and anisotropic 3d curves can not be distinguished .",
    "this behavior is a manifestation of the fact that for these @xmath14 and @xmath162 values , the nel transition takes place in the incoherent 3d one - particle motion regime : the first fermionic matsubara frequency @xmath166 is much higher than @xmath162 .",
    "the inter - plane hopping having no effect on the one - particle green s function and self - energy , it follows from eq .",
    "( [ self ] ) , that the behavior of @xmath157 is dominated by two - dimensional effects , even if the critical exponents are the same for the isotropic and anisotropic 3d models .    in the high temperature regime ( typically for @xmath167 ) , when the dimension does not have any influence , one can expect that a simple two - site problem may be instructive .",
    "the calculation of @xmath136 in the two - site case is detailed in the appendix , we list here the main results . the two - site problem solved in the grand - canonical ensemble , with a chemical potential fixed to the half - filling value , gives a good quantitative agreement for the double occupation factor in comparisons with the tpsc , at high temperature , for low and moderate interaction values .",
    "the two site results also display a non monotonous temperature behavior for @xmath126 with a @xmath14-dependent minimum .",
    "this minimum is pushed to high temperature when @xmath14 increases , in contrast with what was observed in the tpsc and dmf approaches ( fig.5 ) . however",

    ", it appears that the non - monotonous temperature behavior of @xmath168 is not a purely dimensional effect , nor a strong @xmath14 effect , and that it is overcome by strong antiferromagnetic fluctuations in @xmath2 .",

    "the various results for @xmath177 obtained primarily for 3d , but also compared to 2 and anisotropic 3d hubbard models shed light on the applicability of the dmf approach .",
    "the latter compares very well with the isotropic 3d case for @xmath177 , which is a local quantity that depends on the dimensionality . that may be seen through eq.([self ] ) .",
    "however , due to the strong @xmath3-dependence of @xmath135 , the 2d case , or the anisotropic 3d case for which the nel transition can be reached with a purely two - dimensional self - energy , are out of reach of the @xmath0 model , as long as the @xmath1 corrections are not taken into account in a satisfactory manner .",
    "progress in that direction has been achieved recently.@xcite    finally , let us stress the fact that up to intermediate coupling , the tpsc gives the same agreement in 2 and 3d , and thus is able to capture the essence of two very different physical systems .",
    "this method is not restricted to half - filling , nor to the hypercubic case , in contrast with many other approaches .",

    "table 1 gives a schematic description of the corresponding states and their contribution to @xmath185 .",
    "details of fig.10 .",
    "index refers to the different letters indexing the curves in fig.10 . for each curve",
    "we specify the degeneracy order , and the value of @xmath186 , the number of electrons being the coefficient of @xmath15 .",
    "the last column gives the value of the double occupation operator in each state .",
    "for example the curve c corresponds to 2 three - electron states , with @xmath187 for each , and to 2 one - electron states with no double occupation .    for @xmath188 , the first excited state",
    "is four - fold degenerate and corresponds to charge fluctuations ( the particle number is not the same as in the ground state ) .",
    "two of these four states correspond to a non - zero double occupation . for higher interaction the first excited state",
    "is three - fold degenerate , corresponding to spin fluctuations , and has no double occupation .",
    "thus for @xmath189 the simple 2 site problem predicts a non - monotonous temperature dependence of @xmath190 . in that case",
    "the distance between the first and second excited sates raises with interaction as can be seen in fig.10 .",
    "it follows that the temperature at which the double occupation factor begins to increase , grows with the repulsion .",
    "this contrasts with the behavior observed in @xmath111 or @xmath0 .",
    "nevertheless , the simple 2 sites problem favors charge fluctuations compared with the thermodynamic limit , and interestingly the decrease of @xmath139 with an increase of @xmath14 , is recovered if we freeze charge fluctuations taking 2 sites with precisely 2 electrons . if freezing charge fluctuations gives a qualitative agreement for @xmath139 as a function of @xmath14 , the quantitative agreement for @xmath136 in comparisons with the infinite lattice case is not as good as it was with charge fluctuations allowed .",
