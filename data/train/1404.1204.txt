    "transport properties of graphene and graphene - based microstructures are currently among the most actively investigated topics in graphene physics  @xcite .",
    "aside from fundamental aspects such interest in graphene stems from its potential applications as a high - mobility semiconductor and the experimental ability to tune its properties via gating  @xcite .",
    "investigation of the electron transport includes the consideration of a conductance and shot noise which is characterized by the fano factor @xmath4 being the ratio of the noise power and mean current .",
    "for instance , the fano factor of wide and short graphene sheet equals 1/3  @xcite near the dirac point .",
    "this coincides with the well - known result for diffusive wire  @xcite .",
    "lots of theoretical and experimental works have been devoted to investigations of transmission @xmath5 and conductance @xmath6 through different multibarrier graphene nanostructures and graphene superlattices ( sls )  @xcite which can be fabricated , e.g. , by applying a local top gate voltage .",
    "it has been shown that a one - dimensional periodic potential substantially affects the transport properties of graphene .",
    "for instance , the kronig - penny type electrostatic potential produces strong anisotropy in the carrier group velocity near the dirac point leading to the supercollimation phenomenon  @xcite .",
    "the band structure of an ideal graphene sheet has no energy gap which results , for example , in total transparency of any potential barrier for normally - incident electrons  @xcite ( an analog of the klein paradox  @xcite ) .",
    "it is extremely desirable for electronics applications that graphene structures be gapped .",
    "therefore , much effort of researchers has been focused on producing a gap in the graphene spectrum .",
    "the gap can be created by strain engineering as well as by deposition or adsorption of molecules on a graphene layer .",
    "for instance , a hydrogenated sheet of graphene ( graphane ) is a semiconductor with a gap of the order of a few  ev  @xcite .",
    "other way of producing the gap is to use hexagonal boron nitride ( hbn ) substrate . in this case",
    "the gap value is small enough owing to the lattice mismatch .",
    "however , it can be increased by the applying of a perpendicular electric field  @xcite .",
    "creation of various graphene heterostructures , including sls , with the gap discontinuity is widely discussed now .",
    "one way of generating spatially modulated gap is graphene on a substrate made from different dielectrics  @xcite .",
    "the required gap modulation can also be created by using , e.g. , an inhomogeneously hydrogenated graphene or graphene sheet with nonuniformly deposited cro@xmath7 molecules . in our previous work",
    "@xcite we studied the electronic properties of graphene sl in which the gap and potential profile are piecewise constant functions .",
    "it was found that in such sl up to some critical value @xmath8 of potential allowed subbands are separated by gaps .",

    ", sl becomes gapless .    in this work",
    "we examine in detail ballistic transport through graphene nanostructures , including sl , formed by space - modulated gap and potential . using the transfer - matrix formalism we study the transmission , conductance and the fano factor for systems with arbitrary numbers of barriers .",

    "specifically , for a gapless graphene sheet the fano factor drops from  1/3 at low voltages to  0.125 at high voltages  @xcite .",
