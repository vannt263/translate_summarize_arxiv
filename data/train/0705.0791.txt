    "the standard theory of astrophysical disk accretion was formulated over thirty years ago @xcite . since then , arguably the most important theoretical milestone has been the demonstration via numerical simulations that the removal of angular momentum required for accretion to proceed is mediated by magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) turbulence driven by the weak - field magnetorotational instability ( mri  see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "notwithstanding these groundbreaking developments , it still remains unclear precisely how energy can be channelled from the bulk accretion flow to a diffuse region outside the disk where high - energy processes can operate .",
    "this outstanding issue is inextricably linked with the formation and ubiquity of outflow phenomena associated with accretion disks .",
    "indeed , the formation and nature of relativistic jets remains one of the most formidable theoretical problems in this field .    in this paper",
    ", we highlight some recent theoretical progress made towards understanding vertical transport in accretion disks @xcite . a macroscopic",
    ", mean field approach is adopted for the mhd turbulence .",
    "this allows us to identify the dominant mechanisms responsible for angular momentum transport as well as the main contributions to the global energy budget of the system .",
    "we also demonstrate quantitatively how outflows , both poynting - flux - dominated and mass - flux - dominated , can modify the spectrum of disk emission substantially from that predicted by standard accretion disk theory .",
    "here , we present statistically - averaged equations in a cylindrical @xmath0 coordinate system for a fluid which is time - independent and axisymmetric in the mean ( @xmath1 , where the angle brackets denote ensemble - averaged quantities ) .",
    "we use newtonian physics throughout , with the gravitational potential @xmath2 .",
    "the fluid description is valid down to the innermost marginally stable orbit @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the gravitational radius of a black hole of mass @xmath5 .",
    "the mean - field conservation equations are integrated vertically over an arbitrary disk scaleheight , @xmath6 .",
    "quantities calculated at the disk surface ( @xmath7 ) are denoted by a @xmath8 superscript , @xmath9 , and we assume reflection symmetry about the disk midplane , so that @xmath10 .",
    "midplane values of variables are denoted by @xmath11 .",
    "we assume @xmath12 is much less than the radius ( the `` thin disk '' approximation ) , so that quantities of order @xmath13 and @xmath14 are neglected .",
    "we adopt a mass - weighted statistical averaging approach in which all variables are decomposed into mean and fluctuating parts , with intensive variables such as the velocity mass averaged according to @xmath15 while extensive variables , such as density , pressure and magnetic field , averaged the following way : @xmath16 note that intensive averages are denoted by a tilde , extensive averages are denoted by a bar and fluctuating components are denoted by a prime .",
    "the fluctuating velocity components are restricted to subsonic speeds because the mri is a weak - field instability which drives subsonic turbulence with @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the local sound speed and @xmath19 is the keplerian angular velocity .",
    "the only restriction we place on the mean fluid velocity components is that they satisfy @xmath20 and that @xmath21 and @xmath22 are independent of @xmath23 , simplifying the vertical integration .",
    "the combined magnetic and reynolds stresses are defined by @xmath24    in what follows , we summarize the salient equations for radial and vertical transport of mass , angular momentum and energy .",
    "a full derivation of these equations can be found in our earlier paper @xcite . for clarity ,",
    "we have simplified the presentation of the relevant equations by omitting negligible correlation terms in the energy equation are negligible compared to analogous correlations with the mean fluid velocity @xmath25 . ] and by removing the notation for averaged extensive and intensive quantities .",
    "thus , averaged quantities are implicitly assumed .",
    "vertical integration of the mean - field continuity equation gives @xmath26 we now introduce the usual definitions for the surface mass density , @xmath27 and mass accretion rate , @xmath28 we also introduce an analogous mass outflow rate , @xmath29 associated with a mean vertical velocity @xmath30 at the disk surface , i.e. at the base of a disk wind . in terms of the above definitions , the vertically integrated continuity equation , ( [ e : mass_int ] ) , can be written as @xmath31 implying that @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the total mass flux at the innermost stable orbit , @xmath34 .",

    "it can be equivalently expressed in terms of the flux of angular momentum , @xmath46 , as follows : @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the angular momentum flux of the accreting matter , @xmath49 is the radial flux of angular momentum carried by the @xmath42 stresses and @xmath50 \\ ; { \\rm d}r$ ] is the vertical flux of angular momentum carried by outflowing matter and by the @xmath51 stresses .",
    "thus , both radial and vertical transport contribute to the nett rate at which matter loses angular momentum and moves radially inwards .",
    "in other words , the mass accretion rate , @xmath52 , is determined by the nett rate at which angular momentum is transported radially outwards by mhd stresses acting over the disk height and vertically outwards by a mass outflow as well as by mhd stresses acting over the disk surface .",
    "the most luminous accretion - powered astrophysical sources are inferred to be accreting matter at very high rates .",
    "quasars , for instance , appear to be accreting close to or even exceeding the eddington rate , @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the efficiency with which gravitational binding energy is converted to radiation and @xmath55 is the mass of the central black hole . identifying the dominant mechanisms responsible for such high mass accretion rates is a major challenge confronting accretion disk theory .",
    "it is interesting to compare the rate of angular momentum transport indicated by ( [ e : angmom_int ] ) with that predicted by standard accretion disk theory @xcite . in a standard disk , angular momentum is transported radially outwards only and the stresses responsible for this are parameterized by a dimensionless parameter @xmath56 such that @xmath57 in addition , the stresses are assumed to vanish at @xmath34 and @xmath52 is necessarily constant with @xmath35 ( since there is no mass outflow ) .",
    "thus , the angular momentum conservation equation , ( [ e : angmom_int ] ) , reduces to @xmath58 the parameter @xmath56 lies in the range @xmath59 for stresses resulting from subsonic turbulence .",
    "values of @xmath56 approaching unity are required to account for the high accretion rates inferred in the most powerful sources , such as quasars . however , because the standard @xmath60disk model remains a phenomenological prescription , it is unclear whether values @xmath61 correspond to a physically plausible realization of the actual turbulent stresses in real accretion disks",
    ".    numerical simulations may be uniquely capable of addressing this issue .",
    "simulations of accretion disks have demonstrated conclusively that turbulent mhd stresses can indeed remove angular momentum from matter , thus facilitating the accretion process ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "however , 3d simulations of mri - generated mhd turbulence in accretion disks have so far been unable to produce high mass accretion rates @xcite .",
    "typical values of @xmath56 are @xmath62 . on the other hand ,",
    "high accretion rates are recovered from 3d mhd simulations when a large - scale , open mean magnetic field is explicitly included @xcite .",
    "these simulations and others ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as well as semi - analytic models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , show that at small disk radii , vertical transport of angular momentum by a large - scale magnetic torque is more efficient than radial transport by mhd turbulence .",
    "the numerical results indicate that mhd turbulence , whilst important for the microphysics of accretion disks , can not be solely responsible for the removal of excess angular momentum from accreting matter . as eqn .",
    "( [ e : angmom_int ] ) shows , angular momentum can also be removed by vertical components in the mean fluid and magnetic fields ( i.e. nonzero @xmath63 and @xmath64 components at the disk surface ",
    "see also @xcite ) .",
    "large - scale mhd effects in the form of mass outflows and magnetic torques must therefore be primarily responsible for enhanced angular momentum transport in accretion disks .",
    "the fundamental relationship between angular momentum and energy ( @xmath65 ) then also implies that large - scale mhd effects must also be responsible for the high - energy phenomena associated with accreting sources which must necessary originate outside the disk in a relativistic jet or magnetized corona .    in the following section , we examine the global energy budget of accretion disks in which angular momentum transport is prescribed by the generalized angular momentum conservation equation ( [ e : angmom_int ] ) .",
    "we now consider energy conservation in mhd disk accretion .",
    "again , we refer the reader to our earlier paper @xcite for details of the derivations .",
    "accretion power is the rate at which gravitational binding energy is extracted from the accreting matter .",
    "this energy can be converted into mechanical ( e.g. kinetic , poynting flux ) and non - mechanical ( e.g. radiative ) forms .",
    "the rate at which this occurs is determined by keplerian shear in the bulk flow , @xmath66 , with @xmath67 .",
    "the rate per unit disk surface area at which energy is emitted in the form of electromagnetic radiation is determined by the internal energy equation .",
    "if there are negligible changes in the internal energy and enthalpy of the gas , then the disk radiative flux , @xmath68 , is approximately equal to the rate of stochastic viscous dissipation of the turbulent energy , which occurs on the smallest scales at the end of a turbulent cascade .",
    "if there is negligible transport of turbulent energy from the source region , then turbulent energy is locally dissipated at a rate equivalent to its production rate , @xmath69 ( see   2.5 in @xcite for a discussion on the relative importance of production , transport and dissipation of turbulent energy ) .",
    "the internal energy equation then implies @xmath70 vertically integrating over the disk height yields the following expression for the radiative flux emerging from the disk surface : @xmath71    the level of the turbulent mhd stresses @xmath72 available for internal dissipation depends on how efficient other processes are at converting the extracted accretion energy into other ( mechanical and non - mechanical ) forms . in other words , @xmath72 is specified by the angular momentum conservation relation ( [ e : angmom_int ] ) , which gives @xmath73      \\nonumber \\\\ & - &      \\left ( \\frac{{r_{\\rm i}}}{r } \\right)^2 t_{r\\phi } ( { r_{\\rm i } } )   \\\\ & - & \\frac{1}{2\\pi r^2 } \\int_{{r_{\\rm i}}}^{r } \\left [ \\ ,   v_\\phi r \\frac{{\\rm d}{\\dot m_{\\rm a}}}{{\\rm d}r } - 4 \\pi r^2   \\langle t_{\\phi z}\\rangle^+ \\ ,   \\right ]",

    "the last term on the right hand side of ( [ e : fd ] ) describes the rate at which energy is removed from the disk by outflows involving mass and poynting fluxes .",
    "the result ( [ e : fd ] ) for the radiative flux of an accretion disk corrected for the effects of outflows can be expressed as @xmath75 \\qquad , \\label{e : fd1}\\ ] ] where @xmath76 - \\frac{2\\pi { r_{\\rm i}}^2 t_{r\\phi } ( { r_{\\rm i}})}{{\\dot m_{\\rm a}}(r ) r^2 \\omega } \\label{e : fa}\\ ] ] is the accretion factor and @xmath77 \\ > { \\rm d}r \\label{e : fo}\\ ] ] is the outflow correction factor ( the ` @xmath78 ' subscript denotes wind ) .",

    "if vertical transport of angular momentum dominates , then energy is efficiently removed from the disk before being locally dissipated therein .",
    "it is noteworthy to compare our outflow - modified disk flux with the disk flux predicted by standard accretion disk theory . in the absence of outflows ( that is , when @xmath83 and @xmath84 ) , then @xmath85 , @xmath86 and hence , @xmath87 . in the limit of vanishing",

    "we will henceforth refer to our generalized disk prescription as the outflow - modified multi - colour disk ( ommcd ) model .    before we can calculate the total luminosity and emission spectrum for the ommcd model , it is necessary to define a specific functional form for the outflows .",
    "realistically , of course , whether a disk becomes conducive to outflows and the resulting behaviour of those outflows are determined by several factors , including the degree of field - matter coupling , as well as the field strength and topology , all of which will in general vary with radius across the disk .",
    "indeed , numerical simulations to date have been unable to show whether a nonzero , nett poloidal field can evolve from a stochastic field with zero nett flux .",
    "here , we wish to obtain a simple quantitative measure of how outflows might affect the observable properties of an accretion disk .      a simple phenomenological model for the mass accretion rate is ( see e.g. @xcite for other self - similar models ) @xmath92 where @xmath93 represents a critical wind radius beyond which the mass outflow is negligible .",
    "the wind mass loss rate then satisfies @xmath94 , from the continuity equation ( [ e : mdot ] ) .",

    "this is the nett mass influx at @xmath127 and corresponds to the eddington rate when the radiative efficiency is @xmath128 .",
    "this is strictly only the case for the mcd disk model .",
    "when outflows are important , the radiative efficiency can fall below the nominal @xmath129% predicted by standard theory because the outflows remove energy from the disk ( as well as angular momentum ) , so there is relatively less energy to dissipate and radiate away . for the ommcd models shown in fig .",
    "[ nulnu ] , the disk radiative efficiency is about an order of magnitude lower than that of a standard disk .    as is clearly evident in fig .",
    "[ nulnu ] , outflows can substantially modify the overall spectrum of emission .",
    "the generalized ommcd model predicts a high - energy cut - off in the emission spectrum at lower energies than that predicted by the standard mcd model .",
    "this is a direct results of the importance of outflows at small radii , where the highest - energy emission originates . in the case of stellar - mass black holes ,",
    "the spectrum is most affected at x - ray energies ( around a few kev ) , while for supermassive black holes , it is the extreme ultraviolet region ( @xmath130 ) that is most affected by outflows .",
    "the ommcd model also predicts a broadband region of the disk spectrum ( typically around visual wavelengths ) that is much flatter than the characteristic @xmath131 law predicted by standard theory .    we have used a specific phenomenological model to quantitatively calculate how a disk spectrum can be modified by outflows and a different choice for the functional form of the outflows may result in a somewhat different predicted spectral shape .",
    "nevertheless , the overall effect of outflows on a disk should be largely insensitive to the detailed physical properties of the outflows ; the extraction of angular momentum and binding energy from the disk will inevitably result in an emission spectrum that is dimmer and redder than that predicted by the standard model for the same mass accretion rate .",
    "our results demonstrate that the modifications to a standard disk spectrum as a result of energetic outflow phenomena are clearly not negligible when the outflows are primarily responsible for the removal of angular momentum from accreting matter .",
    "direct observational verification of the predicted ommcd spectrum may be possible for only some types of accreting sources , however , as the outflows will also produce their own characteristic radiative signatures that may overlap in the spectral energy band where we predict the disk to be most strongly modified .",
    "this can confuse our interpretation of the emergent observed spectrum .    in the case of galactic x - ray binaries ( xrbs ) , for instance , the disk spectrum can be substantially modified at x - ray energies ( typically around @xmath132kev ) .",
    "these sources often exhibit a power - law x - ray spectrum above @xmath132kev that is thought to arise in a magnetized , tenuous corona and/or relativistic jet as a result of inverse compton scattering off disk photons ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "existing models for this emission process simply use a standard disk spectrum for the seed photon distribution .",
    "however , this is clearly not a self - consistent calculation since the formation of a corona and/or jet from disk magnetic fields inevitably modifies the disk radial structure and hence , photon spectrum , as we have shown here .",
    "thus , although we would not expect to directly see the modified disk spectrum in xrbs , our model can be indirectly tested by using the underlying ommcd spectrum as the source of seed photons that are upscattered in a disk corona and/or jet . by comparing the predicted x - ray spectrum against the observed spectrum",
    ", we can improve our interpretation of the source characteristics and obtain tighter constraints on key physical parameters such as mass accretion rate .",
    "the above type of calculation has been performed by us for ultra - luminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) @xcite .",
    "these exceptionally luminous xrbs probably involve accretion onto a black hole more massive than those found in galactic xrbs .",
    "they provide an effective test for our modified disk model because some ulxs exhibit a low energy ( @xmath133 ) spectral component that can be interpreted as disk emission .",
    "however , because these sources emit virtually all of their radiative power as hard , power - law x - rays , which must necessarily be produced outside the disk , the accretion disk must be substantially modified and a standard disk model should not be used to fit the soft spectral component . indeed , we show @xcite that the ommcd spectrum can adequately fit the observed soft spectral component , implying a black hole mass @xmath134 .    a similar test can also be performed for quasars and other agn , powered by accretion onto a supermassive ( @xmath135 ) black hole .",
    "the prominent optical / uv continuum feature known as the `` big blue bump '' @xcite is generally interpreted as accretion disk emission @xcite .",
    "however , attempts at fitting accretion disk spectral models to the observed spectra have had mixed success ( see @xcite for a review ) . for agn ,",
    "the disk spectrum will be most strongly modified by outflows at uv wavelengths ( see fig .  [ nulnu ] ) .",
    "although there is less overlap between the modified disk and corona / jet x - ray emission than in the xrb case , the poor transmission of uv radiation through earth s atmosphere means that direct observations of the predicted ommcd spectrum in agn are not straightforward .",

    "consequently , the emergent disk spectrum is fainter in the far - uv , precisely in the bandpass where a break has been detected independently by several instruments .",

    "firstly , the standard model does not take into account the partitioning of accretion energy into disk radiation and other non - radiative forms of energy ( e.g. poynting flux ) .",
    "the second important point is that the two different disk models predict different values for the fundamental physical parameters @xmath5 and @xmath36 .",

    "the standard theory for astrophysical disk accretion has enjoyed remarkable success since its inception over 30 years ago . however , ongoing rapid advances in instrumental technology are placing increasingly tighter observational constraints on interpretational models that utilize the standard theory .",
    "the ubiquity of energetic outflow phenomena in accreting astrophysical sources gives us two important clues to the underlying processes responsible for accretion : ( 1 . ) vertical transport of angular momentum can not be ignored and may indeed be the dominant mode of transport at small radii ; and ( 2 . )",

    "<S> we briefly review recent developments in black hole accretion disk theory , emphasizing the vital role played by magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) stresses in transporting angular momentum . </S>",
    "<S> the apparent universality of accretion - related outflow phenomena is a strong indicator that large - scale mhd torques facilitate vertical transport of angular momentum . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to an enhanced overall rate of angular momentum transport and allows accretion of matter to proceed at an interesting rate . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we argue that when vertical transport is important , the radial structure of the accretion disk is modified at small radii and this affects the disk emission spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> we present a simple model demonstrating how energetic , magnetically - driven outflows modify the emergent disk emission spectrum with respect to that predicted by standard accretion disk theory . </S>",
    "<S> a comparison of the predicted spectra against observations of quasar spectral energy distributions suggests that mass accretion rates inferred using the standard disk model may be severely underestimated . </S>"
