    "<S> wavefront shaping allows for ultimate control of light propagation in multiple - scattering media by adaptive manipulation of incident waves . </S>",
    "<S> we shine two separate wavefront - shaped beams on a layer of dry white paint to create two enhanced output speckle spots of equal intensity . </S>",
    "<S> we experimentally confirm by interference measurements that the output speckle spots are almost correlated like the two outputs of an ideal balanced beam splitter . </S>",
    "<S> the observed deviations from the phase behavior of an ideal beam splitter are analyzed with a transmission matrix model . </S>",
    "<S> our experiments demonstrate that wavefront shaping in multiple - scattering media can be used to approximate the functionality of linear optical devices with multiple inputs and outputs . </S>"
