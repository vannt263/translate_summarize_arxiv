    "transport coefficients are of particular interest to quantify the properties of strongly interacting matter created at relativistic heavy ion collisions ( hic ) and these coefficients can be instrumental to study the critical properties of qcd medium . the fluctuations or external fields cause the system to depart from its equilibrium and a non - equilibrium system has been created for a brief time .",
    "the response of the system to such type of fluctuations or external fields is essentially described by transport coefficients _ eg_. the shear and bulk viscosities , the speed of sound etc . in recent years a somewhat surprising result in the quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) story has occurred when the practitioners in this field tried to satisfy the collective flow data as obtained in collider experiments . in order to get the required collective flow in the framework of viscous hydrodynamics ,",
    "the value of shear viscosity to entropy density ratio ( @xmath0 ) comes out to be very small  @xcite .",
    "the tiny value of @xmath0 indicates the discovery of most perfect fluid ever created in laboratory .",
    "this perfect fluid is described as strongly interacting quark gluon plasma  @xcite .",
    "thus the study of various transport coefficients is a powerful tool to really understand the behaviour of the matter produced in the ultra relativistic heavy ion collision ( urhic ) experiments at rhic and lhc .",
    "+ recently electrical conductivity has gained a lot of interest due to the strong electric field created in the collision zone of urhic experiments  @xcite .",
    "it has been observed that strong electric and magnetic fields are created in peripheral heavy ion collisions whose strength are roughly estimated as @xmath1(where @xmath2 is the mass of the pion ) within proper time @xmath3 fm / c  @xcite .",
    "this large electrical field can significantly affect the behaviour of the medium created in these collisions and the effect depends on the magnitude of electrical conductivity ( @xmath4 ) of the medium .",
    "@xmath4 is responsible for the production of electric current generated by the quarks in the early stage of the collision .",
    "the value of @xmath4 would be of fundamental importance for the strength of chiral magnetic effect  @xcite which is a signature of cp - violation in strong interaction .",
    "further the electrical field in mass asymmetric collisions ( e.g. @xmath5-@xmath6 collisions etc . ) has overall a preferred direction and thus generating a charge asymmetric flow whose strength is directly related to @xmath4  @xcite .",

    "this has important implications for both dynamics and signatures of the qgp .",
    "earlier it has been assumed _ a priori _ in the ideal hydrodynamics that the qgp is completely isotropic .",
    "however , recently dissipative hydrodynamics helps us to understand that the qgp created in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions has different longitudinal and transverse pressure .",
    "it has been shown heuristically in first - order navier stokes viscous hydrodynamics that the ratio of longitudinal pressure over the transverse pressure is : @xmath7 , where @xmath8  @xcite . using the rhic - like initial condition",

    "it has also been shown that there exists an anisotropy in @xmath12 versus @xmath13 in second - order israel - stewart viscous hydrodynamics .",
    "several other groups who study the early - time dynamics of qcd within ads / cft framework have also shown the early - time pressure anisotropies and quote @xmath14 or smaller  @xcite . in colour - glass condensate framework , the practitioners have found that the timescale for isotropization in classical yang - mills simulations is very long  @xcite . from these observations and findings",
    "one can certainly assumes that the momentum anisotropy produced in the medium created in heavy ion collisions lasts for at least @xmath15 .",
    "thus it is crucial to incorporate these momentum - space anisotropies in any phenomenological studies specifically for transport coefficients .",
    "+ in this article our main motivation is to calculate the electrical conductivity of an anisotropic qgp phase using the relativistic boltzmann s kinetic equation . we have used the quasiparticle description to define the basic properties of qgp since earlier we have shown that quasiparticle description provides the proper and realistic thermodynamical and transport behaviour of qgp phase  @xcite .",
    "we want to provide the correct temperature dependence of @xmath4 since it is not yet established .",

    "spatial electric current ( @xmath19 ) is directly proportional to the longitudinal component of the electric field @xmath20 : @xmath21 where the proportionality coefficient is known as electrical conductivity ( @xmath4 ) .",

    "the equilibrium quark distribution function at @xmath41 has the following form : @xmath42 where @xmath43 .",
    "+ since we are interested only in electric field components of @xmath33 , we take only two terms : @xmath44 .",
    "thus the rbt equation ( [ rbt ] ) becomes : @xmath45 where @xmath46 can be solved by using the chain - rule and after differentiation we get the value of @xmath47 as : @xmath48 by substituting @xmath49 in eq .",
    "( [ delj ] ) we obtain the expression for @xmath50 : @xmath51 where the subscript @xmath52 implies summation over the flavors .",
    "here we have taken up , down and strange flavors only .",
    "+ it is important to provide a connection between the calculation of electrical conductivity by thermal field theory and in boltzmann s kinetic approach . in an equilibrated system",
    "having volume @xmath53 and temperature @xmath54 , the zero frequency green - kubo  @xcite formula for the electrical conductivity is given by the current - current autocorrelation @xmath55 where the repeated spatial - indices , @xmath56 do not imply summation .",
