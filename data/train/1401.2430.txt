    "in this suplemental material we provide additional discussions about the efficiency of our method together with comparisons of our method to existing ones and specific calculations concerning the implementation of gates .",
    "our algorithm is conceived to be run in a setup composed of a system undergoing the evolution of interest and an ancillary qubit .",
    "thus , the size of the setup where the algorithm is to be run is always that of the system plus one qubit , regardless of the order of the time correlation .",
    "for instance , if we are considering an @xmath2-qubit system then our method is performed in a setup composed of @xmath136 qubits .    with respect to time - efficiency ,",
    "our algorithm requires the performance of @xmath0 controlled gates @xmath137 and @xmath138 time - evolution operators @xmath139 , @xmath0 being the order of the time - correlation function .",
    "if we assume that @xmath140 gates are needed for the implementation of the system evolution and @xmath141 gates are required per control operation , our algorithm employs @xmath142 gates . as @xmath141 and @xmath140 do not depend on the order of the time correlation we can state that our algorithm needs a number of gates that scales as a first - order polynomial with respect to the order @xmath0 of the time - correlation function .",
    "the scaling of @xmath140 with respect to the system size depends on the specific simulation under study .",
    "however , for most relevant cases it can be shown that this scaling is polynomial .",
    "for instance , in the case of an analogue quantum simulation of unitary dynamics , what it is usually called an always - on simulation , we have @xmath143 . for a model requiring digital techniques @xmath140 will scale polinomially if the number of terms in the hamiltonian grows polinomially with the number of constituents , which is a physically - reasonable assumption  @xcite . in any case",
    ", we want to point out that the way in which @xmath140 scales is a condition inherent to any quantum simulation process , and , hence , it is not an additional overhead introduced by our proposal .    with respect to the number @xmath141 , and as explained in the next section",
    ", this number does not depend on the system size , thus , from the point of view of efficiency it amounts to a constant factor .    in order to provide a complete runtime analysis of our protocol",
    "we study now the number of iterations needed to achieve a certain precision @xmath144 in the measurement of the time correlations . according to berntein s inequality  @xcite we have that @xmath145\\leq2 \\exp \\left ( \\frac{-l \\delta^2}{4 \\sigma_0 ^ 2 } \\right),\\ ] ] where @xmath146 are independent random variables , and @xmath147 is a bound on their variance . interpreting @xmath146 as a single observation of the real or imaginary part of the time - correlation function , we find the number of measurements needed to have a precision @xmath144 .",
    "indeed , we have that @xmath148 with probability @xmath149 , provided that @xmath150 , where we have set @xmath151 , as we always measure pauli observables .",
    "this implies that the number of gates that we need to implement to achieve a precision @xmath144 for the real or the imaginary part of the time - correlation function is @xmath152 $ ] .",
    "again , @xmath153 is a constant factor which does not depend nor on the order of the time correlation neither on the size of the system .",
    "exponentials of tensor products of pauli operators , @xmath154 $ ] , can be systematically constructed , up to local rotations , with a mlmer - srensen gate applied over the @xmath155 qubits , one local gate on one of the qubits , and the inverse mlmer - srensen gate on the whole register .",
    "this can be schematized as follows , @xmath156,\\ ] ] where @xmath157 $ ] , @xmath158 and @xmath159 for odd @xmath155 , where @xmath160 for @xmath161 , and @xmath162 for @xmath163 , with positive integer n. for even @xmath155 , @xmath164 is replaced by @xmath165 , where @xmath166 for @xmath167 , and @xmath168 for @xmath169 , with positive integer @xmath0 .",
    "subsequent local rotations will generate any combination of pauli matrices in the exponential .",
    "the replacement in the previous scheme of the central gate @xmath164 by an interaction containing a coupling with bosonic degrees of freedom , for example @xmath170 $ ] , will directly provide us with @xmath171.\\ ] ]    in order to provide a complete recipe for systems where mlmer - srensen interactions are not directly available , we want to comment that the kind of entangling quantum gates required by our algorithm , see the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ interaction ] ) above , are always decomposable in a polynomial sequence of controlled - z gates  @xcite . for example , in the case of a three - qubit system we have @xmath172 here , @xmath173 is a controlled - z gate between the @xmath174 qubits and @xmath175 is local rotation applied on the first qubit .",
    "this result can be easily extended to @xmath0-qubit systems with the application of @xmath176 controlled operations  @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is demonstrated the polynomial character of our algorithm , and hence its efficiency , even if mlmer - srensen gates are not available in our setup .",
    "two typical approaches for the measurement of correlations in the context of quantum computing are the hadamard and the swap tests .",
    "the hadamard test is performed in a setup consisting of the system of interest and a qubit , and thus in terms of space is as efficient as our algorithm .",
    "the performance of a hadamard gate followed by a controlled unitary evolution , another hadamard gate and the measurement of two ancilla operators will lead to the real and imaginary parts of a correlation of the type @xmath177 , where @xmath178 corresponds to the controlled unitary . while the evolutions of the system of interest are not controlled in our protocol , the hadamard test needs to perform control unitary operations which may not be trivial for many body hamiltonians or hamiltonians depending in time . in this sense",
    "our method supposes a significant step forward in simplicity and a notable reduction in the requirements of our setup .",
    "it is noteworthy to mention that our algorithm could access time correlations of systems that undergo non - unitary dynamics .    in the case of the swap test",
    ", correlations between two states are measured following a similar scheme , in this case a hadamard gate is performed on the ancilla qubit , after that a control swap gate is implemented between the two states of interest and finally a second hadamard gate is performed on the ancillary qubit .",
    "again local measurements on the ancillary qubit will provide real and imaginary parts of the correlation between the two states . while our protocol involves only one ancillary qubit , @xmath136 , the swap test needs two copies of the system and the ancillary qubit which makes a total of @xmath179 qubits , this makes our protocol significantly more space saving .",
