    "at extremely high chemical potential , real qcd ( three - color qcd ) is expected to exhibit interesting phenomena like deconfinement of quarks or a qcd - analog of the superconducting phase of qed , and these may exist in compact stars @xcite .",
    "it is therefore desirable to investigate qcd in this region .",
    "however there is the so - called sign problem for real qcd which disables the use of monte - carlo simulations . at this point two - color qcd ( @xmath0 ) with an even number of flavors ( @xmath1 )",
    "comes to our aid : it turns out that the sign problem disappears for this theory .",
    "this means that we have a tool to attack qcd from first principles at high density , the only problem being that the theory is not physical .",
    "fortunately , at low baryon density two - color qcd still has the properties such as chiral symmetry breaking and confinement .",
    "a nice review of qcd at high density has been given in @xcite .",
    "two - color qcd has been studied by several groups @xcite , and these studies led to a tentative phase diagram of the theory .",
    "figure 1 shows a tentative phase diagram of two - color qcd with @xmath2 taken from @xcite .",
    "the bare lattice parameters are @xmath3 and @xmath4 corresponding to a lattice spacing of @xmath5fm .",
    "the corresponding pion - to - rho meson mass ratio is @xmath6 .",
    "the green area denotes the crossover region .",
    "the area above the crossover region is a quark - gluon plasma . at low temperature and low chemical potential",
    "there is a hadronic phase . for @xmath7 ,",
    "the hadrons of the theory are mesons and baryons , which are equivalent .",
    "the circles and diamonds denote pseudocritical points for superfluid to normal and deconfinement transitions , respectively .",
    "we see that the critical temperature for the superfluid to normal transition does not depend on the chemical potential once the chemical potential is above the onset transition .",
    "the same thing is not true for the deconfinement transition , as the blue curve suggests a decrease in the critical temperature with an increase in the chemical potential .",
    "the action of the theory we consider in this work is @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 denote the two flavor fields , @xmath11 is the wilson fermion matrix and @xmath12 is the charge conjugation operator .",
    "the wilson fermion matrix in the presence of a chemical potential , @xmath13 , and in the absence of diquark source , @xmath14 , in position space is given by : @xmath15.\\ ] ] here @xmath16 is the gauge field , and @xmath17 means that the fermion matrix expression is for the case when there is interaction .",
    "the fourier transform of @xmath18 gives the wilson fermion matrix in the momentum space ( for @xmath19 ) :    @xmath20+\\left[\\mathbf{1}-\\mbox{cos}\\left(\\omega\\right)\\right ] , \\label{eq.3}\\ ] ]    where @xmath21 .",
    "the last two terms in ( [ eq.1 ] ) are introduced in order to calculate the _ diquark condensate _ , which is explained in section 3 .",
    "the factor @xmath22 includes the _ diquark source _ , @xmath23 , which controls these terms and",
    "is sent to zero to obtain the physical limit .",
    "such a calculation is carried out with the parameters @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 fm , and for two different diquark sources , @xmath27 and @xmath28 ( the corresponding pion - to - rho meson mass ratio is @xmath6 ) .",
    "the quark number density is also calculated with the same parameters .",
    "the simulation parameters used to obtain the results for the form factors of the gorkov propagator , which is explained in section 4 , are @xmath4 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 fm and @xmath31 .    in the calculation of the form factors of the quark propagator",
    ", we have fixed the configurations to landau gauge .",
    "in a theory with @xmath32 , quarks and antiquarks live in equivalent representations of the color group .",
    "baryons of this theory are diquarks , and at zero chemical potential there is an exact symmetry between the diquarks and mesons . at zero chemical potential ,",
    "the pseudo - goldstone multiplet consists of the pion isotriplet plus a scalar isoscalar diquark and antidiquark .",
    "when the chemical potential reaches the value of about half the mass of a pion , these diquark baryons are expected to condense .",
    "this is called the diquark condensate , and this condensation gives rise to a superfluid phase .",
    "in real qcd , the analog of such a phase is a superconducting phase because these diquarks are not gauge invariant in the world of three colors .",
    "the order parameter of the transition to this superfluid phase is the diquark condensate :    @xmath33    where @xmath12 is the charge conjugation operator .",
    "figure 2 shows a plot of the diquark condensate calculated in this way , with respect to the chemical potential .",
    "the physical curve here is the curve for @xmath14 , which is linearly extrapolated from the data for @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "the diquark condensation takes place when the chemical potential reaches the value of about half the pion mass , which means that there is enough energy to excite diquarks and give rise to the superfluid phase .",
    "the parameters of the calculation correspond to a value of @xmath34 for the pion mass .",
    "therefore a transition at about @xmath35 is expected , and the curve for @xmath36 is consistent with this expectation .",
    "we note that the extrapolation to @xmath14 is poor in that the curve does not cross zero at @xmath37 .",
    "this is due to the fact that linear extrapolation was used with diquark condensate values corresponding to only two different diquark sources .",
    "we plan to improve this result by adding diquark condensate values for yet another diquark source , @xmath38 .     and",
    "@xmath28 ( @xmath14 extrapolated).,width=476,height=340 ]    figure 3 shows the quark number density with respect to chemical potential for @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "the curve for @xmath14 , is extrapolated using linear extrapolation .",
    "the data are normalized by the continuum non - interacting quark number density , denoted by @xmath39 .",
    "we see a clear plateau in the region @xmath40 , which roughly corresponds to @xmath41 .",
    "this indicates that the system behaves like a non - interacting quark gas in this region .     and @xmath28 ( @xmath14 extrapolated).,width=476,height=340 ]",
    "the action can be written in the compact form @xmath42 where @xmath43 , and @xmath44    @xmath45 is the wilson fermion matrix in the presence of a non - zero diquark source and is known as the _",
    "gorkov matrix_. the inverse of the gorkov matrix is the _ gorkov propagator _ :    @xmath46    the off - diagonal block components @xmath47 and @xmath48 are responsible for the anomalous propagation of quarks , which turns a quark into an antiquark or vice - versa .",
    "the @xmath49 and @xmath47 block components of the gorkov propagator can each be written in terms of four _ form factors _ , which are useful tools to study the propagators :    @xmath50    @xmath51    these expressions are in the continuum and are of the most general form possible which respects all symmetries of the theory @xcite .",
    "for the expressions on the lattice we use the lattice momenta , @xmath52 , see @xcite .",
    "real and imaginary parts of the @xmath53 form factor corresponding to the normal propagation at various chemical potentials are given in figure 4 .",
    "the behaviour of both the real and the imaginary parts of the form factor changes as the chemical potential increases , which we interpret to be due to the normal to superfluid phase transition .",
    "note that @xmath53 is not defined at @xmath54 according to .",
    ".,title=\"fig : \" ] .,title=\"fig : \" ]    real and imaginary parts of the @xmath55 form factor corresponding to the normal propagation at various chemical potentials are given in figure 5 .",
    "this form factor is related to the dynamical mass and is real .",
    "we see that the behavior of the real part of @xmath55 changes with increasing chemical potential , which is due to the change in the behaviour of the chiral condensate , hence , the dynamical mass . the imaginary part for high spatial momenta is consistent with zero , as expected .",
    "but there is a deviation from zero for low spatial momenta . according to , in the absence of a diquark source the form factor @xmath55 for free quarks",
    "is given by @xmath56+\\mathbf{1}-\\mbox{cos}\\left(\\omega\\right)}{\\sum_{j=1}^{3}\\mbox{sin}^{2}\\left(p_{j}\\right)+\\mbox{sin}^{2}\\left(\\omega\\right)+\\left\\ { m_{0}+\\sum_{j=1}^{3}\\left[\\mathbf{1}-\\mbox{cos}\\left(p_{j}\\right)\\right]+\\mathbf{1}-\\mbox{cos}\\left(\\omega\\right)\\right\\ } ^{2}}.\\ ] ] we see that as soon as @xmath13 an imaginary part will appear , which explains this deviation .",
    ".,title=\"fig : \" ] .,title=\"fig : \" ]    real and imaginary parts of the @xmath57 form factor corresponding to the normal propagation at various chemical potentials are given in figure 6 .",
    "for low spatial momenta there is a decrease in the imaginary part with increasing chemical potential , while for high spatial momenta there is an increase .",
    "the location of the zero crossing is an indicator of a fermi surface .",
    ".,title=\"fig : \" ] .,title=\"fig : \" ]    real and imaginary parts of the form factor @xmath58 corresponding to the normal propagation and @xmath59 corresponding to the anomalous propagation have been found to be consistent with zero .",
    "the reason for @xmath58 to be zero is explained in @xcite .",
    "real and imaginary parts of the @xmath60 form factor corresponding to the anomalous propagation at various chemical potentials are given in figure 7 .",
    "the imaginary part is consistent with zero while the real part is not .",
    "this is the form factor most directly associated with the diquark gap , which in most model studies is taken to be dirac scalar .",
    ".,title=\"fig : \" ] .,title=\"fig : \" ]    real and imaginary parts of the @xmath61 form factor corresponding to the anomalous propagation at various chemical potentials are given in figure 8 . while both the real and the imaginary parts are consistent with zero at high spatial momenta , there is a big deviation from zero at low chemical potentials . it might be that even at zero chemical potential , the nonzero diquark source induces diquark condensate , giving rise to this deviation observed .",
    ".,title=\"fig : \" ] .,title=\"fig : \" ]    real and imaginary parts of the @xmath62 form factor corresponding to the anomalous propagation at various chemical potentials are given in figure 9 .",
    "unlike the @xmath58 form factor of the normal propagation , the @xmath62 form factor of the anomalous propagation is not consistent with zero .",
    "this suggests that the anomalous propagation can not be modelled purely a dirac scalar gap , but may also include a tensor component .",
    "note that the argument in @xcite for why @xmath63 does not hold for the anomalous propagator .",
    ".,title=\"fig : \" ] .,title=\"fig : \" ]",
    "we have briefly discussed a tentative phase diagram of two - color qcd .",
    "we presented results for diquark condensate and found that a transition to a superfluid phase is observed at a chemical potential corresponding to half of the pion mass .",
    "this confirms and improves on previous results on coarser lattices .",
    "the @xmath58 form factor for normal propagation was expected to be consistent with zero according to @xcite and we have indeed observed this .",
    "next we want to investigate analytically if the corresponding form factor for the anomalous propagator should be consistent with zero and see if our results from the simulation are reasonable .",
    "we also plan to compute the form factors of the inverse gorkov propagator .",
