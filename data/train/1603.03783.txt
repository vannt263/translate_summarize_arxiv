    "the proposed method first applies a 2d gaussian smoothing filter to remove noise arriving from sensors .",
    "then , the proposed method segments the depth map into regions using morphological watershed segmentation ( mws ) proposed by meyer et al .",
    "let us assume that @xmath3 closed regions and @xmath4 background regions are detected in spatially filtered depth map @xmath5 using mws .",
    "background regions @xmath4 are the ones whose at least @xmath6 boundary points lie on the border of depth map",
    ". some of the closed regions might enclose other closed regions .",
    "we represent enclosed regions as @xmath7 , enclosing regions as @xmath8 , and the remaining closed regions as independent regions @xmath9 such that @xmath10 .",
    "figure [ fig : regioncategory ] shows different possible regions .",
    "region @xmath11 and @xmath12 can be merged and the merging decision is solely dependent upon application .",

    ", we are interested in complete object tracking in contrast to part - based tracking and hence , we merge regions @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "now , the proposed method computes the area @xmath13 of each closed region @xmath3 as : @xmath14 = \\sum \\sum r[i](x , y)$ ] .",
    "noise arising from boundary of objects @xmath1 and holes @xmath2 in depth map @xmath15 will also create regions . though magnitude of @xmath1 and @xmath2 will be higher in comparison to @xmath0 , it has lower magnitude in contrast to actual object size .",

    "figure [ fig : prop ] shows an example of noise suppression in depth map using the proposed method . from figure [ fig : prop ] , it is clear that proposed method is able to remove the noise ( @xmath1 , @xmath0 , and @xmath2 ) effectively .",
    "object traverses a very limited space from time @xmath25 to time @xmath26 .",
    "we use this important clue to map regions between two consecutive frames and identify roi .",
    "let @xmath27 and @xmath28 be the undirected graphs for frame at time @xmath25 and @xmath29 .",
    "displacement between two arbitrary nodes , @xmath30 and @xmath31 , with region @xmath32 $ ] and @xmath33 $ ] respectively is defined as : @xmath34 \\setminus r[i_0]$ ] .",
    "this measure tells us how much a region has traversed from time @xmath25 to @xmath26 .",
    "furthermore , region mapping process is speeded - up by including the threshold @xmath35 .",
    "if @xmath36 , then we map the regions @xmath33 $ ] and @xmath32 $ ] in our experiments is 80 .",
    "besides region mapping , the proposed method simultaneously do temporal tracking of `` mapped regions '' in first @xmath37 depth maps to determine roi .",
    "roi can be either growing region ( region whose area changes , as in case of hand waving ) or shrinking region ( region whose area changes , as in case of zooming out ) or moving region ( region whose position changes , as in case of rolling ball ) or combination of growing , shrinking , and movement ( as in case of box lifting ) .",
    "the proposed method computes @xmath38 from mapped regions of first @xmath37 frames .",
    "if @xmath38 is greater than a particular threshold value ] , then we mark the region @xmath39 $ ] as roi .",
    "as the proposed method is region - based , direction of object movement is an important clue and can help in optimizing the performance of the proposed method while searching the roi in next depth frame .",
    "we use a cardinal system to determine the direction of roi movement .",
    "cardinal system can be 4-point or 8-point or 16-point . in our experiments , we have used 4-point cardinal system , shown in figure [ fig : boundarypointdetection ] . for determining the direction of roi , the proposed method computes difference between the mapped regions of two consecutive depth maps @xmath40 and then decides the direction of region movement using the four point cardinal system .",
    "it is to be noted that the direction is computed with respect to the center of the region of depth frame at time @xmath26 i.e. @xmath33 $ ] .",
    "figure [ fig : framea ] and figure [ fig : frameb ] shows snapshots of two consecutive depth maps where person is waving a hand while the difference between these depth maps is shown in figure [ fig : diffab ] . from figure [ fig : diffab ] , we can see that the direction of hand movement is north - east .",
    "given this information , we can predict that the hand movement in the next depth frame will be either in east or north direction and we do not need to search in south and west direction .",
    "the proposed method starts tracking roi from @xmath41 depth map ( @xmath37 depth maps are required for roi determination ) . in order to track roi , the proposed method creates a weighted graph for each roi .",
    "let @xmath42 and @xmath43 denotes the number of nodes and edges in graph @xmath44 of @xmath41 frame , where each node @xmath45 corresponds to each region in the depth map ( set of elements to be tracked ) and edges @xmath46 corresponding to neighbouring regions .",
    "let us assume that node @xmath47 represents roi .",
    "now , a node table is constructed for node @xmath47 .",
    "node table contains the shortest distance @xmath48 between roi and the remaining regions .",
    "now , the weights are assigned to edge @xmath49 as : @xmath50 figure [ fig : undirgraph ] shows an example of constructing a node table and assigning weights @xmath51 to the edges of a graph @xmath44 . to illustrate ,",
    "let us assume that @xmath52 is the roi ( represented in green color ) .",
    "now , the proposed method computes the distance between node @xmath52 and remaining nodes of graph @xmath44 and constructs a node table , shown in figure [ fig : undirdist ] .",
    "based on the values of node table and eq .",
    "[ eq : weightassign ] , weights are assigned to the edges ( see figure [ fig : undirwt ] ) .",
    "when an object moves , set of attributes ( such as area and perimeter ) of adjoining regions are impacted .",
    "in other words , when any movement occurs in region corresponding to node @xmath52 , attributes of the edges @xmath53 with weight @xmath54 will be affected most .",
    "movement in node @xmath52 will have an impact on the attributes of nodes @xmath55 , @xmath56 ,",
    "@xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 most . since the attributes of nodes @xmath60 and @xmath61 will have the least impact due to any movement in @xmath52 , we do not have to consider these nodes for tracking .",
    "this ultimately helps in reducing the searching area for object tracking . in order to further minimize the searching area ,",
    "the proposed method utilizes predicted direction of the roi . if the roi is moving towards west , for instance , then regions with edges @xmath53 and weight @xmath62 in the west direction are most probable regions for tracking . in our example , nodes @xmath55 and @xmath57 are in west of @xmath52 and hence , we need to search in regions corresponding to these nodes .",
    "objects can appear or disappear in a scene .",
    "the proposed method runs a background thread at a constant frame interval to check if any roi is appearing or disappearing in the scene .",
    "this background thread executes roi detection method discussed in section [ ssec : featuretotrack ] and if there is any change in number of rois , it updates the object tracking thread . in case number of rois",
    "are more than one , the proposed method initiates different foreground thread to track each roi .",
    "value of constant frame interval in our experiments is equal to number of frames required to detect roi i.e. @xmath37 .",
    "multiple objects or rois in a scene can occlude if they are moving towards each other .",
    "occlusion can be detected based on roi s size and the distance between roi s .",
    "let @xmath63 and @xmath64 be two roi s detected and @xmath65 be the euclidean distance between @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "if @xmath66 , then the two roi s are about to occlude .",
    "if the area of @xmath63 is changing drastically while the change in area of @xmath64 is either zero or slight , then we mark roi @xmath63 as _ occludee_.    let us say that there are @xmath67 roi s with level sets @xmath68 .",
    "the euclidean distance @xmath65 between roi @xmath69 and roi @xmath70 can be obtained as : @xmath71 .",
    "now , we compute change in the area of roi @xmath72 as : @xmath73 , where @xmath74 denotes the area of roi @xmath72 at time @xmath25 .",
    "the proposed method then computes the occlusion detection parameter @xmath75 between roi @xmath69 and roi @xmath70 as : @xmath76 .",
    "if @xmath77 , then we say that occlusion occurs where @xmath78 is the threshold parameter for occlusion detection .",
    "we conducted experiments on samples with two or more humans to adjust the value of @xmath78 .",
    "we varied the value of @xmath78 from 0 to 1 in our experiments .",
    "when we set @xmath79 , we were able to detect the occlusion as soon as it occurs .",
    "however , when we set @xmath80 , we were able to detect the occlusion but only when at least 25% of the region of two humans were overlapping .",
    "hence , we set @xmath81 in our experiments .",
    "figure [ fig : occhandle ] shows an occlusion example where two humans occlude each other ( in this sequence , both the humans are in motion ) . before the occlusion , the boundaries of the humans are complete . during occlusion ,",
    "two humans start overlapping each other ( figure [ fig : occhandle](b ) ) and hence , the boundaries are broken . at this point ,",
    "the distance between two humans is very less ( @xmath82 ) .",
    "we evaluated the performance of the proposed method on @xmath83 videos taken from standard datasets ( msr @xcite @xcite , ut austin @xcite , princeton university @xcite , iros @xcite , and rwth @xcite ) .",
    "videos in these datasets differ in terms of pose , background , actions , etc .",
    "we conducted experiments on a computer having intel i5 - 2410 m 2.30 ghz processor and 6 gb ddr3 ram .",
    "since the proposed method uses @xmath37 depth maps for detecting roi , it should be considered as an independent variable to conduct a fair study .",
    "we conducted experiments to adjust the value of @xmath37 and results are shown in figure [ fig : objectaccuracy ] . from figure",
    "[ fig : objectaccuracy ] , we can see that the performance plateaus after @xmath84 .",
    "hence , we used @xmath84 in our experiments .     on object detection accuracy ]",
    "we quantify the performance of the proposed method using two metrics :    * * @xmath85 score for object detection * : we used this metric for determining the accuracy of the proposed object detection method @xcite .",
    "@xmath85 score combines both precision and recall and is defined as : @xmath86 , where @xmath87 and @xmath88 . here",
    ", @xmath89 represents precision , @xmath90 represents recall , @xmath91 represents true negative samples , @xmath92 represents true positive samples , and @xmath93 represents false negative samples . *",
    "* success rate ( sr ) for tracking * : for quantitative evaluation of our tracking algorithm , we employed the criterion used in pascal voc challenge @xcite . if @xmath94 , then frame is tracked successfully . here , @xmath95 denotes the overlap ratio , @xmath96 denotes the tracked region , and @xmath97 denotes the ground truth .    to compare the results with previous methods , we either take the reported best results or carefully select the parameters with the provided source code .",
    "we tested the proposed method on all datasets .",
    "figure [ fig : detectionresultsseta ] shows the snapshots of the object detection while table [ table : perfdataset ] summarizes the accuracy of the proposed method on different datasets . from table [",
    "table : perfdataset ] , we can see that the average accuracy of the proposed method is @xmath98 .",
    "this clearly indicates that the proposed method is able to detect objects ( humans , boxes , etc . ) in most of the cases .",
    "the performance of the proposed method is low in case of iros @xcite , princeton @xcite and rwth@xcite dataset .",
    "since the proposed method detect and track an object by analysing its motion , it is not able to detect the objects which are stationary resulting in low accuracy .",
    ".object detection results on different datasets [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table : trackresults ]    it is worth noting that the accuracy reported for object detection in table [ table : perfdataset ] and object tracking in table [ table : trackresults ] is different .",
    "this is because the proposed method is able to track only the motion part of the object .",
    "for instance , person might walk for sometime then does not move for sometime and then again start moving . in such a case , the proposed method tracks the person when he / she is moving .",
    "an example is shown in figure [ fig : missingtrack ] where two persons enter the scene ( university hall ) .",
    "one of them keeps walking while other goes to atm machine and waits there for some time to complete his work . as we can see in figure",
    "[ fig : missingtrack ] , the proposed method is able to track both the person till they are moving . the proposed method subsequently lose the track of one of them as there is no movement ( see figure [ fig : missingtrackex ] ) .",
    "though we are able to detect both the persons in this scene , we are able to track these persons till they are walking .",
    "such scenarios resulted in low sr .",
    "the proposed method uses direction of object movement and weighted graph for optimizing the search area required for roi detection and tracking . in case of optimization , we use direction of object movement and weighted graph for roi detection and tracking while in case of without optimization , we search the entire frame to detect and track the roi . average execution time",
    "required per frame for noise reduction , roi detection , and roi tracking on different datasets by the proposed method without optimization and with optimization of search area are 888.6 and 540 milliseconds respectively i.e. the proposed optimized method is @xmath99 faster than the unoptimized method . though the proposed optimization method significantly reduces the execution time , we have not seen any difference in the accuracy of the proposed method with and without optimization .",
    "in this paper , we proposed a region graph based method for noise suppression , object detection , and object tracking using depth cameras .",
    "the experimental results show that the proposed method is able to detect and track the objects with and without occlusions .",
    "the proposed approach can be applied in different applications such as human activity recognition .",
    "the advantage of the proposed method can be summarized as : first , the proposed method does not require any training for roi detection and tracking .",
    "second , the proposed method uses direction of object movement and weighted graph for roi detection and tracking .",
    "this helps in optimizing the searching area for detection and tracking .",
    "the limitations of the proposed method are : ( i ) it is not able to do re - identification of objects and ( ii ) object detection and tracking is not in real - time .",
    "rgb - based tracking systems seem to be more robust towards object re - identification , though their overall accuracy for tracking is lower . in future",
