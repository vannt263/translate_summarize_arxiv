    "two of the main questions one might ask in cosmology are :    \\1 ) is the universe eternal or it had a beginning , and in the last case , was this beginning given by an initial singularity ?",
    "\\2 ) why the universe we live in is remarkably homogeneous and isotropic , with very small deviations from this highly symmetric state ?",
    "the answer given by classical general relativity ( gr ) to the first question , indicated by the singularity theorems @xcite , asserts that probably the universe had a singular beginning . as singularities are out of the scope of any physical theory",
    ", this answer invalidates any description of the very beginning of the universe in physical terms .",
    "one might think that gr and/or any other matter field theory must be changed under the extreme situations of very high energy density and curvature near the singularity , rendering the physical assumptions of the singularity theorems invalid near this point .",
    "one good point of view ( which is not the only one ) is to think that quantum gravitational effects become important under these extreme conditions .",
    "we should then construct a quantum theory of gravitation and apply it to cosmology .",
    "for instance , in the euclidean quantum gravity approach @xcite to quantum cosmology , a second answer to the first question comes out : the universe may have had a non - singular birth given by the beginning of time through a change of signature .    in the same way ,",
    "the naive answer of gr and the standard cosmological scenario to the second question is not at all satisfactory : the reason for the universe be highly homogeneous and isotropic is a matter of initial conditions .",
    "however , solutions of einstein s equations with this symmetry are of measure zero ; so , why the universe is not inhomogeneous and/or anisotropic ?",
    "inflation @xcite is an idea that tries to explain this fact .",
    "nevertheless , in order for inflation to happen , some special initial conditions are still necessary , although much more less stringent than in the case without inflation . once again , quantum cosmology can help in this matter by providing the physical reasons for having the initial conditions for inflation .",
    "recently , many papers have been devoted to the application of the bohm - de broglie interpretation of quantum mechanics @xcite to quantum cosmology @xcite .",
    "one of the aims of these papers was to try to give an answer to the first question within a new perspective in quantum cosmology . in the framework of the bohm - de broglie interpretation of quantum mechanics applied to minisuperspace models , it was shown in references @xcite that quantum gravitational effects may indeed become important under extreme situations of very high energy density and curvature , and avoid the initial singularity of the classical models .",
    "the solutions that come out are then non - singular ( eternal ) cosmological models , but with a very hot phase , tending to the usual classical solutions when the energy scales become smaller than the planck scale .",
    "of course this is a much better answer than the one given by classical gr .",
    "the aim of this paper , as a natural sequence of the references cited above , is to address the second question from the point of view of the bohm - de broglie interpretation of quantum cosmology .",
    "we want to investigate if quantum mechanical effects can isotropize an anisotropic cosmological model yielding an alternative mechanism for the isotropization of the universe .",
    "our strategy is to take classical anisotropic models which never isotropizes , quantize them , and examine if quantum effects can at least create isotropic phases .",
    "as we will see , quantum effects can not only create isotropic phases but they can also isotropize the models forever , for a large variety of quantum states .",
    "other authors have also studied this problem , mainly taking bianchi ix models , adopting other interpretations of quantum cosmology , and they arrive at similar results @xcite .",
    "the mathematical models we take are bianchi i models with and without matter . for the case without matter ,",
    "one of the anisotropic degrees of freedom is suppressed and we end with a two - dimensional minisuperspace model .",
    "the classical solutions of this case are all singular and always anisotropic , with the trivial exception of flat space - time . when quantizing this system we find that the solutions of the wheeler - dewitt can be written in terms of superpositions of plane wave solutions .",
    "taking gaussian superpositions we show that there are bohmian trajectories representing universes expanding from an initial singularity and others representing bouncing non - singular universes , both with isotropic phases during the course of their evolutions .",
    "there are also bohmian non - singular periodic solutions with periodic isotropic phases and non - singular bouncing solutions which are never isotropic . for the case with matter",
    ", we take a minimally coupled scalar field with arbitrary coupling constant @xmath0 .",
    "the minisuperspace is four - dimensional .",
    "the classical solutions are again singular , and once they begin anisotropic they continue to be anisotropic forever .",
    "when quantizing the system , we arrive at a wheeler - dewitt equation which corresponds to a massless klein - gordon equation in four dimensions .",
    "we show that there are plenty of spherical wave solutions whose bohmian trajectories represent expanding universes that isotropizes permanently after some period , many of them which are also non - singular .",
    "gaussian superpositions also present this feature .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the next section we present the minisuperspace models which we will investigate and their classical solutions . in section iii",
    "we quantize these models , and obtain their corresponding wheeler - dewitt equations and general quantum solutions . in section",
    "iv we present the results concerning the quantum isotropization of those solutions through the investigation of the bohmian trajectories we obtain from them .",

    "we can see that the only way to obtain isotropy in these solutions is by making @xmath30 and @xmath31 , which yields solutions that are always isotropic , the usual friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) solutions with a scalar field .",
