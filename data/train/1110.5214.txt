    "a limit cycle in physics  @xcite refers to a model independent way to look for a manifestation of a hidden scale , one in which a correlation between physical quantities is geometrically rescaled and replicates itself .",
    "limit cycles are shown to exist even in simple quantum three - boson systems  @xcite , manifested for large two - body scattering lengths , as well as for short - ranged interactions .",
    "they follow the 1970 efimov key prediction  @xcite of geometrically separated weakly - bound three - boson states near the scattering threshold , confirmed by recent experiments in cold - atom traps  @xcite . for a more recent exposition on the experimental status ,",
    "see ref .",
    "the addition of one more particle to the quantum three - body system has long challenged this picture  @xcite .",
    "recent theoretical works  @xcite motivated by cold - atom experiments  @xcite have revived this issue . the actual relevance in identifying simple universal relations in few - body binding laws , with the corresponding experimental possibilities ,",
    "have been discussed by modugno  @xcite in a recent perspective article on this matter .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , we reported a different dimension of this problem by establishing a new universal correlation among the binding energies of two successive tetramer states between two efimov trimers , through precise numerical calculations within a zero - range interaction at the unitary limit ( zero two - body binding ) .",
    "it was shown that such tetramer states are related to an unsuspected new limit cycle not constrained by efimov physics or by three - body properties .",
    "tetramers hitting the atom - trimer threshold , leading to resonant recombination losses in this channel , are signatures of a new limit cycle .",
    "furthermore , other four - boson observables close to the unitary limit can exhibit correlations not constrained by the low - energy two- and three - boson properties .",
    "recombination rates , atom - trimer or dimer - dimer scattering lengths , can move near the feshbach resonance ( fr ) independently of the two and three - body properties .",
    "the appearance of few - body forces in the open channel , due to the coupling with the closed channel , can drive the four - body physics  @xcite .",
    "indeed , there is a recent experimental evidence , reported by nakajima et al .",
    "@xcite , of a three - body force acting in the open channel near the fr in a three - component mixture of a @xmath8li cold gas .",
    "an appropriate way to directly probe the universal properties of a few - boson system at low energy near the unitary limit is to present results in terms of scaling functions correlating pair of observables , within a renormalized zero - range two - body interaction . in this way",
    ", no effect can be claimed to be originated from a particular form of the short - range interaction between the particles , as evidenced by the three - body universal scaling function derived in ref .  @xcite .",
    "as shown in this case , the regularization parameter in the renormalized zero - range approach can be directly associated to a three - boson physical information , in addition to a two - body observable , such as the scattering length .",
    "the concept of scaling functions , which is used to evidence universal properties of three - boson systems close to the unitary limit , is extended to four - boson systems in ref .",
    "@xcite , as well as in the present work . within such purpose , we study the sensitivity of tetramer properties to a four - boson scale , by using the faddeev - yakubovsky ( fy ) formalism  @xcite with zero - range two - body interactions . therefore , independently on the choice of the three - body scale that fixes the trimer properties  @xcite , a four - body regularization parameter ( four - body scale ) is introduced in the fy formalism .",
    "the new short - range scale has indeed effects on four - boson physics , which appears as universal correlations between four - boson low - energy @xmath9wave observables not constrained by the trimer properties .",
    "the four - body quantities change as long as the new scale varies .",
    "previous conclusions for the nonexistence of a proper four - body scale rely on a strong suppression of the short - range physics , beyond that already accounted for in the three - boson system . indeed , by estimating the trace of the kernel of the four - body equation in momentum space , amado and greenwood  @xcite showed that there is no infrared divergence , which led them to conclude against the existence of efimov effect in the case of four or more particles .",
    "however , the momentum integrals should also implicitly have an ultraviolet cutoff ( the four - body one ) to regulate them .",
    "note that according to weinberg s eigenvalue criterion  @xcite the divergence of the trace is a necessary condition for an infinite number of bound states .",
    "however , in the kernel of the fy equation , this criterion can only by applied when considering the trimer in the ground state . more explicitly , in case of ultraviolet divergence of the four - body kernel , by moving a four - body scale in relation to the three - body one",
    ", an infinite number of tetramer states emerges from the threshold , but the number is restricted by the energy interval between trimers ( when the reference trimer is an excited one ) , such that it can be infinite only in case the given trimer is the ground state .",
    "it is also instructive to recall other pioneering four - body calculations that have verified the possibility of efimov - like behavior in four - body systems , such as the works of krger and perne  @xcite and tjon and naus  @xcite .",
    "conclusions drawn within the nuclear physics context are obviously limited , in view of the strong nuclear repulsion of the potential core , such that the possible observation of a four - body scale , independent from the three- and two - body ones , is suppressed .",
    "it explains why the @xmath10he and the triton binding energies are strongly correlated with a fixed slope , as verified by tjon  @xcite . in our understanding of the four - body problem , it is not enough only two parameters , which determines trimer properties , to describe the four - boson system .",
    "our results imply that the correlation between the tetramer and trimer binding energies forms a family of tjon lines with slopes depending on the new four - boson scale . to exemplify",
    "that , we have shown a four - boson universal correlation among the energies of two successive tetramers appearing between two consecutive efimov states  @xcite .",
    "the correlation exhibits a dependence on a new scale not fixed only by the trimer properties . in order to directly address this novel universal behavior ,",
    "we have performed a number of calculations of tetramer properties within a zero - range model to show how the dependence on the new short - range scale is evidenced through their structure in momentum space .",
    "the tetramer energies can be presented in a scaling plot where the behavior of a four - body scale can be easily verified in comparison with other relevant few - body scales  @xcite . the existence of a short - range four - body scale , which is independent of the two- and three - body ones , is expressed in terms of scaling functions or correlation between observables .",
    "once the short - range parameters are eliminated in favor of physical quantities , the renormalized results appear as correlations between the four - body observables with fixed dimer and trimer properties .    in the present work we provide details for the approach that lead us to report  @xcite a universal correlation between the energies of two successive tetramers . as it will be thoroughly presented in the next sections , we establish by our numerical investigations that a new short - range parameter is necessary to fix the properties of the four - boson system in the unitary limit .",
    "our conclusions are supported by precise numerical solutions of the four - boson fy integral equations in momentum space for a zero - range two - body interaction  @xcite , as well as by an analysis of the four - body wave function .",

    "the treatment of four - body problems is quite well known in the quantum scattering theory , following the original faddeev formulation of the three - body systems  @xcite , later on extended to @xmath1particle scattering by yakubovsky  @xcite .",

    "the form - factors of the separable potential are conveniently replaced by point - like interactions , within a renormalized zero - range model where the three- and four - body scales are introduced .      in a four - body ( 4b )",
    "system ( with particles @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 ) there are 18 different coordinate systems , each one associated with a specific two - body partition ( see appendices [ appendix a ] and [ appendix b ] ) . basically , by considering the arrangements of the corresponding two- and three - body sub - systems , two different partitions are possible : @xmath6type ( a+t ) , where a single particle is bound to a three - body subsystem ; and @xmath7type ( d+d ) , where two dimers are bound .",
    "clearly , as we know from the faddeev formalism , each three - body subsystem has also three atom - dimer partitions .",
    "we present below the fy formalism with our notation , which is used along the next sections .",

    "the faddeev components of the wave function @xmath26 are reconstructed through fy components .",
    "every @xmath27 component contains two @xmath6type and one @xmath7type configurations .",
    "therefore , the total wave function @xmath28 contains twelve different @xmath6type chains and six @xmath7type chains , leading to eighteen independent fy components . by considering identical bosons ,",
    "the four - body wave function @xmath28 has to be totally symmetric . as a consequence ,",
    "all twelve @xmath6type components are identical in their functional form with particles permuted .",
    "the same is true for the six @xmath7 type components .",
    "thus , it is sufficient to consider only two independent fy components corresponding to the @xmath6 and @xmath7type partitions , @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the 18 coupled fy equations , for identical bosons , shrink to two coupled homogeneous equations , @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the permutation operator for the pair @xmath33 , with @xmath34 and @xmath35 defined by @xmath36    the symmetry property of @xmath37 under exchange of particles @xmath11 and @xmath12 , and @xmath38 under separate exchanges of particles @xmath39 and @xmath40 guarantee that the full wave function , @xmath41 is totally symmetric . in order to get insight on how the short - range four - body scale is reflected in the bosonic wave function for a zero - range force , we will analyze the momentum structure of the @xmath42 and @xmath43 components . following this strategy",

[ fig : nui_50 ] . note that each of the choices of the vanishing momentum implies in a very long wavelength limit for the fourth particle , indicating the dominance of a three - body cluster configuration within the four - body system .",
    "this configuration carries the four - body scale information , as clearly shown by the plots for the wave - function dependence on the two non - vanishing momentum in units of @xmath242 .",
    "the momentum - space structure of the fy components of weakly - bound tetramers was thoroughly analyzed at the unitary limit using a renormalized zero - range two - body interaction , with three and four - body scales .",
    "our regularization scheme allows to introduce independently these two scales providing general framework to investigate the universal properties of tetramers , which has extended tails in the classically forbidden region .",
    "the step to renormalized results for the observables is found by introducing scaling functions , which are written only in terms of dimensionless physical quantities .",
    "these universal scaling functions achieve numerically a limit cycle .    the universal scaling function correlating two successive tetramer energies attached to one trimer comes from the sensitivity of the four - boson system to a short - range four - body scale .",
    "each excited @xmath1th tetramer energy @xmath2 moves as the short - range four - body scale changes while the trimer properties are kept fixed .",
    "we suggest that the ratio of @xmath164 , which gives the slope of the tjon line , and it is not a constant as thought before , as a parameter measuring the four - body scale . at the unitary limit , the successive @xmath137th tetramer state emerges from the atom plus trimer threshold for a universal ratio @xmath243 , which does not depend on @xmath5 .",
    "the atom - trimer relaxation resonates when the tetramer hits the scattering threshold .",
    "we also find out that other model results obtained at the unitary limit or close to it  @xcite , are quite consistent with our four - boson scaling plot , giving confidence on the universality of our proposed scaling function .",
    "as evidenced by our results , the independent behavior of the four - body scale is verified in particular when a universal excited four - boson state pumps out from the atom - trimer threshold as the four - boson parameter is driven to short distances or to the ultraviolet momentum region . in the case",
    "that both scales are similar , we confirm that our scaling approach is consistent with the results of other model calculations .",
    "we note that the results obtained by other groups appear near the threshold region due to the model assumptions that have been considered , which are much too restrictive when compared to the flexibility of our model and need to be relaxed to allow a wider variation between the four- and three - body properties .",
    "the suggested scaling plot offers a model independent way to view the relation between successive tetramer states , which can be verified by experiments exploring two - body scattering lengths very close to the feshbach resonance , where multi - boson forces are expected to be active  @xcite . a four - boson short - range interaction",
    "can drive the four - body scale independently from the three - body one .",
    "short - range three - body forces accompanied by different off - shell behaviors of the two - body interaction , which kept the low - energy two- and three - body properties unaltered , could provide another possibility to move the four - body scale in practice .",
    "the attent reader should realize the power of the four - body scaling plot in pinning down the independent behavior of a four - body scale ( for a fixed three - body one ) , in a similar way as the three - body scaling plot , given in ref .",
    "@xcite , resumes all the efimov states obtained by changing the three - body scale .",
    "next , we should emphasize that the scaling curve relating two successive tetramer energies is valid not only for the stable tetramers attached to the ground - state trimer , but also for the unstable tetramers between two successive trimers .",
    "for such conclusion we have also performed resonance calculations of tetramers attached to excited trimers , which are under detailed numerical analysis to be included in a future work .",
    "we avoid to present such results in the present work mainly because we have considered other independent and precise calculations supporting our claim of model independence . in this regard ,",
    "the recent calculations performed by deltuva  @xcite are consistent with our results and give confidence on the model independence of the scaling plot relating the energies of two successive tetramers between two successive efimov trimers in the unitary limit .",
    "as we have shown , the effect of scattering length variations is noticeable and shows a universal pattern in agreement with calculations shown in @xcite , performed in the context of effective field theory .",
    "however , range corrections , which were not yet explored within a general study considering the trimer and tetramer interwoven spectra , will certainly have their importance in explaining how results near the unitary limit deviate from the calculated scaling function for a zero - range force . in this respect ,",
    "range corrections , linear in the two - body effective range , have been already addressed within an effective theory treatment of the three - boson problem with subtracted momentum - space integral equations @xcite .",
    "the scaling plot representation exhibiting the dependence on the four - body scale , which is also being confirmed by other models , shows that the model independence is not fortuitous .",
    "the reason for that comes from the fact that the wave function of tetramers are largely dominated by configurations where the bosons are outside the potential range in the classically forbidden region and depend just on two scales at the unitary limit .",
    "the sensitivity to the short - range scales appears in both the @xmath6 and @xmath7channel of the fy decomposition , which present high momentum tails for any degree of the tetramer excitation .",
    "we also found that the @xmath7channel is favored over @xmath6channel at low momentum when the four - body momentum scale largely overcomes the three - body one .",
    "the universal form of the wave function is putted forward at the unitary limit by a scaling plot where the probability momentum densities for different jacobi momenta are shown in units such that the tetramer binding energy is one . we found that the shapes are independent on the scale ratio and excitation .",
    "it only depends on the chosen jacobi momenta . a simple scaling rule giving the ordering @xmath244 , where @xmath214 is the relative momentum of a pair",
    ", @xmath196 is the relative momentum of the third particle to the pair , and @xmath197 is the relative momentum of the fourth particle in respect to the three - body subsystem .    our calculations of tetramer binding energies , with corresponding structure of momentum probability density and wave functions , are supplying strong numerical evidences that universal tetramers can arise from the trimer threshold as the four - body scale is moved .",
    "these results suggest the possibility of resonant atom - trimer recombination process near the unitary limit , i.e. , when @xmath245 .",
    "it is worth noting that the problem of a new scale in the tetramer properties has a long history , which was never clarified before in the physics community to the extend we are doing now .",
    "the four - body scale gives rise to new scalings of tetramer observables which are not determined only by the two and three - body properties .",
    "we present detailed and accurate numerical results for the binding and the structure of tetramer states to support our claim , given conveniently within the framework of scaling functions . as a matter of fact ,",
    "even results obtained near the unitary limit , by authors that are claiming that no four - body scale is necessary , are consistent with the universal scaling plot for the tetramer binding energies .    in our numerical results of four - boson bound states",
    ", we first consider the exact unitary limit ( @xmath161 ) , and we next consider deviations of this limit to bound ( @xmath123 ) and virtual ( @xmath125 ) two - body branches . as shown in figs .",
    "[ e4xe3-e3xe2]-[scaling - section ] , universal tetramers can hit the atom - trimer threshold leading to a resonant relaxation in this channel ; a crucial phenomenon not considered in other cited recent numerical investigations .",
    "in fact , in those analysis , the authors could also have verified the occurrence of tetramer states merging to an atom - trimer threshold , particularly if they had considered the possibility of a four - body independent scaling behavior near a feshbach resonance .",
    "this could be done by including , for example , tunable three or four - body potentials , which would allow an independent change of the three and four - body spectra .",
    "the position of the atom - trimer resonance is not only a function of the atom - atom scattering and the three - body scale , but it also depends on the new four - body scale .",
    "our results do not exclude the resonant dimer - dimer recombination  @xcite but also add the possibility of a resonant atom - trimer recombination .",
    "finally , we remark that the four - boson scale can be driven near the feshbach resonance by induced four - body forces ( coming from the one - channel reduction of the atomic interaction ) @xcite .",
    "therefore , in this case the efimov ratio percolating the tetramer observables is not assured anymore .",
    "other universal scaling functions can be derived correlating properties of tetramers , in particular the one that correlates the binding energies of tetramers attached to different trimers , and as well as by extending our framework to the scattering region .",
    "the possibility that tetramers could be formed and driven in cold - atom laboratories , as have been achieved by radio frequency association techniques applied successfully to measure trimer energies @xcite , will allow to verify experimentally the universal scaling relations between tetramer properties exhibiting a new scale beyond the trimer one .",
