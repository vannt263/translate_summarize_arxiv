    "the spacetime symmetry of local lorentz invariance is a cornerstone of modern physics @xcite , but is not inviolate .",

    "the symmetry has been experimentally verified to extremely high precision @xcite . on the large scales characteristic of the gravitational sector , however , constraints are much less certain . in this letter",
    "we explore the extent to which precision cosmology can constrain a lorentz - violating theory .",
    "the theoretical workhorse for studying violation of lorentz symmetry in gravitation is the einstein - aether theory @xcite , a simple , elegant proposal for dynamically violating lorentz invariance within the framework of a diffeomorphism - invariant theory .",
    "it is a refinement of the gravitationally coupled vector field theories first proposed by will and nordvedt in 1972 @xcite and has been explored in exquisite detail by jacobson , mattingly , foster and collaborators @xcite .",
    "a lorentz - violating vector field , henceforth called the _ aether _ , will affect cosmology : it can lead to a renormalization of the newton constant @xcite , leave an imprint on perturbations in the early universe @xcite , and in more elaborate actions it may even affect the growth rate of stucture @xcite .",
    "preliminary calculations have been done on the affect of the aether on anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background @xcite .",
    "the action for the einstein - aether is : @xmath0 + s_{m}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 is the metric , @xmath2 is the ricci scalar of that metric , @xmath3 is the matter action , and @xmath4 is constructed to be generally covariant and local .",

    "@xmath3 couples only to the metric @xmath1 and not to @xmath6 and @xmath7   , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "we will use the notation @xmath9 .",
    "the gravitational field equations for this model take the form : @xmath10 where the stress - energy tensor for the vector field @xmath11 is given in @xcite and @xmath12 describes the conventional fluids .    a number of constraints on the @xmath13s have been derived .",
    "most notably a parametrized post newtonian ( ppn ) analysis of the theory leads to a reduction in the dimensionality of parameter space such that @xmath14 and @xmath15 can be expressed in terms of the other two parameters : @xmath16 and @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "additionally , the squared speeds of the gravitational and aether waves with respect to the preferred frame must be greater than one so as to prevent the generation of vacuum erenkov radiation by cosmic rays @xcite .",
    "we shall label this space of models as @xmath18 .",
    "a final constraint arises from considering the effects of the aether on the damping rate of binary pulsars .",
    "the rate of energy loss in such systems by gravitational radiation agrees with the prediction of general relativity to one part in @xmath19 .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that , for the einstein - aether theory to agree with general relativity for these systems , we require that @xmath20 and @xmath21 are related by an algebraic constraint ( shown as the dashed line in figure [ fig : ted ] ) @xcite . a more exotic , but viable , subset of the parameter space can be considered in which @xmath22 .",
    "the ppn and pulsar constraints do not apply here and a cosmological analysis is potentially the only way of constraining the values of the coupling constants .",
    "we shall label this alternate space of models as @xmath23 . note that , in what follows , we will write down the equations in a general form and then study the two subspaces @xmath18 and @xmath23 independently .    we now focus on cosmological scales and assume a homogeneous and isotropic background spacetime in which the metric is of the form @xmath24 where @xmath25 is physical time , @xmath26 is the identity matrix , and @xmath27 is the scale factor . throughout this letter , subscripts @xmath28 and @xmath29 will run 1 to 3 . the vector field must respect the spatial homogeneity and isotropy of the system and so",

    "the energy - momentum tensor of the matter will include the standard menagerie : photons , neutrinos , baryons , dark matter , and the cosmological constant .    in this background ,",
    "the t - t component of the aether stress energy tensor is equal to @xmath31 where @xmath32 . for models @xmath18 we have @xmath33 .",
    "the fractional energy densities in the various components are given by @xmath34 and @xmath35 where @xmath36 km s@xmath37mpc@xmath37 is the hubble constant today and @xmath38 is the energy density in the fluid component @xmath28 . in quasistatic spacetimes",
    "the aether exhibits tracking behaviour such that the locally measured value of newton s constant is actually @xmath39 @xcite . for models @xmath18 we have @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "thus , given a value @xmath41 , the actual @xmath42 is related to the value @xmath43 inferred using a locally measured value of @xmath44 as : @xmath45 . hence , explicitly using our expression for @xmath46 ,",
    "the friedmann equation becomes : @xmath47    to fully explore the cosmological consequences of the aether , we must consider linear perturbations around the background .",
    "we will do so in the synchronous gauge and use conformal time coordinates : given @xmath48dx^{i}dx^{j}$ ] , the two scalar potentials @xmath49 and @xmath50 are defined by : @xmath51 .",
    "$ ] the aether field can be written as @xmath52 ; the zeroth component is fixed equal to @xmath53 by the gauge choice and the fixed - norm constraint .",
    "instead of @xmath54 itself , we choose to to use the variable : @xmath55 with which the evolution equations take a particularly instructive form .",
    "the aether equation of motion is : @xmath59\\xi \\\\ \\nonumber & & + ( c_{14}+\\alpha)\\eta'+(c_{14}+\\alpha)\\frac{1}{k^{2}}({\\cal h}^{2}-\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{a''}{a})(h'+6\\eta')\\\\ \\nonumber & & -\\frac{3}{2}\\frac{c_{14}}{k^{2}}\\sigma_{f}',\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath60 is the conformal hubble parameter , primes are derivatives with respect to @xmath61 and @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the traceless component of the fluid stress energy tensor .",

    "it was shown in @xcite that the primordial scalar power spectrum @xmath73 ( where @xmath74 is the trace perturbation to the metric in the conformal newtonian gauge ) is modified relative to that of a universe with no aether , @xmath75 , through @xmath76^{2}$ ] whilst @xmath77 and @xmath78 are driven to a vanishingly small value compared to their values at the onset of inflation .",
    "we will work with the equivalent initial conditions in the synchronous gauge .    to study these effects in detail",
    ", we have modified the boltzmann code _",
    "_ cmbeasy__@xcite by adding a newton - raphson solver for the hubble parameter , and including the aether components in the density and pressure ; the perturbation evolution has been modified by adding @xmath77 and @xmath78 as the integrated components . in figure",
    "[ fig : c ] we show the effect of the aether on the angular power spectrum of anisotropies in the cmb and the power spectrum of galaxies ( we superpose the wmap and sdss data ) for a selection of parameters in class @xmath18 .",
    "the dominant effect for smaller values of @xmath79 is on the large - scale cmb , through the integrated sachs - wolfe effect ; it leads to a supression on large scales ( which curiously enough is favoured by large scale cmb data ) .",
    "as expected , the overall growing mode of matter perturbations is very weakly affected and the change on the power spectrum of galaxies is marginal .",
    "as is usual in cosmological model testing , we compute parameter constraints using a monte - carlo markov chain ( mcmc)@xcite .",
    "we explore a 6 dimensional parameter space consisting of the fractional baryon density , @xmath80 , the fractional matter density , @xmath81 , the hubble constant , @xmath82 , the scalar spectral index , @xmath83 , the optical depth , @xmath84 , the overall amplitude of fluctuations , the bias factor of sdss galaxies and the two aether parameters , @xmath79 and @xmath85 .",
    "we constrain parameters using the wmap 3-year release , the boomerang 03 release and data from acbar and vsa@xcite , as well as the sdss and @xmath86 surveys@xcite .",
    "we also use measurements of the luminosity distance as a function of redshift from supernovae ia measurements @xcite but have found that these data sets have very little ability to constrain this class of models .",
    "the marginalized constraints from the cmb and large - scale structure on the two aethereal parameters in model @xmath18 are shown in figure [ fig : ted ] @xcite .",
    "the best - fit aether model is mildly superior to standard @xmath87 cosmology , at about @xmath88 , at a cost of two extra parameters .",
    "the soft lower limit at @xmath89 comes from a prior on the baryon fraction .",
    "this signals an important characteristic of these models : the strong correlation between the fractional energy density in the aether , @xmath46 , and the other energy components .",
    "this is perhaps the primary result of our analysis and is illustrated in figure [ figure2d ] : the cmb and lss data restrict the background to evolve as in the @xmath90cdm case , which in turn leads to a rescaling of the different energy components in the presence of the aether .",
    "naturally this also affects the constraints on the other cosmological parameters . these constraints , under the @xmath87 and aether models with and without the weak binary pulsar constraint ,",
    "are shown in table [ tab : params ] .",
    "as expected , the largest shift is seen in the @xmath91 .",
    ".mean and @xmath92 error values of the marginalized likelihoods for a range of cosmological parameters .",
    "the left most column is for @xmath87 with no aether , the central column for general class @xmath18 models , and the right hand column for class @xmath18 models with the weak pulsar constraint ( on the dashed line of figure 1 ) . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      as stated above , the cmb and lss play the dominant role in generating these constraints , and interestingly enough this is through the change in the background evolution and its effect on the metric perturbations , and not necessarily through the presence of perturbations in the vector field . indeed , artificially switcing off the perturbations in the aether field has essentially no effect on the power spectrum of lss and a small effect ( of approximately @xmath93 ) on the angular power spectrum of the cmb .",
    "so far we have focused on models in class @xmath18 , where we found that the coupling constants are allowed to vary quite widely . in the case of models in class @xmath23 ,",
    "the cosmological data are far more restrictive .",
    "for example , fixing @xmath94 we find that @xmath95 ( note that in this case @xmath96 ) .",
    "if we allow @xmath14 to be non - zero we find that both @xmath14 and @xmath15 must be in @xmath97 $ ] .",
    "the reason for this constraint is illustrated in figure [ fig : e ] ; at low @xmath98 the integrated sachs - wolfe effect induced by the modified potentials is large enough to disrupt the @xmath99 .",
    "these are the strongest constraints on these parameters that currently exist .    in this letter",
    "we have studied the effect of lorentz violation on cosmology as parametrized by the einstein - aether model .",
    "we have found that lorentz violation in this form is compatible with current cosmological data and , combined with other non - cosmological probes we have found constraints on @xmath79 and @xmath85 .",
    "the data also require the rescaled combination of density parameters , in which the background evolution is unchanged from a @xmath87 universe .",
    "we have also found tight constraints on the other allowed range of parameter space , @xmath100 , which has , until now , been relatively unconstrained by other methods .",
    "collectively these constraints arise from tests on distance scales spanning more than fifteen orders of magnitude .",
    "there are of , course , other possible ways of parameterizing lorentz violation which are not encompassed by the einstein - aether model . in particular one",
    "may relax the fixed - norm constraint on the aether field @xcite or couple it directly to the matter content of the universe @xcite .",
    "such theories tend to have a much stronger effect on the evolution of the background cosmology @xcite or lead to distinct experimental signatures @xcite .",
    "hence the results presented here are currently the most comprehensive ( though conservative ) constraints on the @xmath13s , and thus on lorentz - violating vector theories .",
