    "there are many examples of classical solitary wave solutions to nonlinear field theory equations .",
    "some of these are useful in quantum field theory as a stationary point in the action functional about which one quantizes the field @xcite .",
    "although these solutions are often relegated to model equations in fewer than three space dimensions @xcite , we consider the maxwell - dirac system of equations in 3 + 1 dimensional space - time , a nonlinear system of pde s involving twelve real functions of four variables .",
    "the general solution of this system is certainly well beyond our grasp ; however , we will obtain a class of particular solutions by making simplifying assumptions and utilizing numerical methods .",
    "before we embark on a search for a localized solution it would be wise to consider on what grounds such a solution is plausible .",
    "it is well known that when one considers the dirac equation with an external `` repulsive '' potential the possibility arises to obtain bound state solutions @xcite .",
    "this potential produces bound states with discrete energies that rise from the continuum of free negative energy states in the same way that an `` attractive '' potential produces lower energy states from those of positive energy . for a great enough `` repulsive '' potential",
    "we may even obtain bound states of positive energy .",
    "this interesting phenomenon goes under the name of `` klein s paradox '' and provides our motivation . in our case",
    "the `` repulsive '' potential is provided by the charge feeling its own electric field .",
    "the maxwell - dirac equations are obtained from the lagrangian density @xmath1 in which the c - number fields are the dirac spinor @xmath2 , which can be considered a four component single - column matrix , and we have @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 are the 4@xmath94 matrices @xmath10 in which @xmath11 is the 2@xmath92 identity matrix and @xmath12 represents the pauli matrices @xmath13 the euler - lagrange equations applied to eq .",

    "we now begin making assumptions about the solution we wish to look for .",
    "we require that @xmath17 satisfy the lorentz condition @xmath18 and that @xmath2 is an energy eigenstate , @xmath19 .",
    "equation   ( [ me ] ) now reduces to poisson s equation @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the 4-current @xmath22 and eq .",

    "this gives us two options : we may throw out the magnetic term in the hope that its contribution will be small and solve the resulting one dimensional , spherically symmetric problem , or we may attack the non - spherical problem .",
    "we proceed with the former and save the latter for sec .",
    "[ sec5 ] . by removing @xmath24",
    "we reduce the maxwell - dirac system ( [ mdl ] ) to a massless scalar - dirac system @xmath25 note that , with @xmath26 in the coupling term , our massless scalar - dirac system ( [ sdl ] ) is not lorentz invariant and is therefore only of use in approximating the maxwell - dirac system .",
    "the necessity for a spherical charge distribution restricts our wavefunction to four possible configurations corresponding to total angular momentum up or down , @xmath27 , and the quantum number @xmath28 , @xmath29 in spherical coordinates @xmath30 , where we have chosen to orient the angular momentum along the z - axis .",
    "note that the two @xmath31 configurations have the same angular dependence as the hydrogen ground state .",
    "equations ( [ pe]-[vde ] ) , neglecting @xmath24 , now reduce to the radial equations @xmath32 we symmetrize the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ fgode ] ) by the similarity transformation @xmath33 , and further simplify eqs.([fgode ] ) and ( [ uode ] ) by identifying the fine structure constant @xmath34 and defining the potential @xmath35 , giving us @xmath36 we also restrict our wavefunction by imposing the normalization condition @xmath37 ensuring a total charge of @xmath38 .",
    "note that @xmath39 does not appear in eqs.([wode]-[nrm ] ) ; hence the energy levels are independent of the choice @xmath40 .",
    "we may readily solve our system of o.d.e.s  ( [ wode ] , [ ode ] ) by a variety of means , including power series solution @xcite , pad series approximation @xcite , and numerical methods .",
    "we choose the latter as it seems the most straightforward path to obtaining a solution .",

    "( [ wode ] ) and ( [ ode ] ) using second order finite differences to obtain a standard , linear , symmetric , matrix eigenvalue problem for @xmath41 and @xmath42 coupled nonlinearly to a symmetric , matrix inverse problem for @xmath43 .",
    "we obtain solutions by solving each linear problem independently and iterating to convergence from an initial guess .",
    "this technique is similar to newton s method of solving the nonlinear system but allows for better behavior in solving the eigenvalue problem at the cost of slower convergence .",
    "we use inverse iteration for the eigenvalue problem together with the conjugate gradient method @xcite for the matrix inverses .",
    "although more efficient methods are available for the one dimensional problem @xcite , we have chosen methods which will work equally well for the case of two independent variables discussed in sec .",

    "note that positive energy solutions exist for @xmath51 and that there is a spectrum of large @xmath49 states of energies near negative one for any choice of @xmath46 .",
    "for the solution to our scalar - dirac equations to be a viable approximate solution to the maxwell - dirac equations , we must establish that the inclusion of the magnetic interaction does not significantly alter the solution .",
    "we do this properly in sec .",
    "[ sec5 ] by modeling the larger system  ( [ pe]-[vde ] ) , including the angular dependence ; however , we will use perturbation theory with our spherically symmetric solution to determine the approximate energy shift @xmath52 due to the magnetic interaction and find good agreement with the full maxwell - dirac case .",

    "we may also use our current ( [ jv ] ) to calculate the magnetic moment via @xmath64 note in table [ table1 ] that we obtain the result @xmath65 when we choose @xmath66 .",
    "from our calculations in the previous section we expect that the inclusion of the magnetic interaction will result in the emergence of a small non - trivial angular dependence on the @xmath67 coordinate .",
    "we also expect the solution to maintain its axial symmetry and proceed in cylindrical coordinates @xmath68 , assuming a wavefunction of the form @xmath69 and potentials of the form @xmath70 . equations ( [ pe]-[j4 ] ) now reduce to @xmath71 and the hamiltonian ( [ vde ] ) becomes @xmath72 we symmetrize ( [ cwode ] ) by the substitution @xmath73 , giving us @xmath74 note that our wavefunctions in both cases  ( [ swave ] ) and  ( [ csw ] ) are eigenfunctions of the @xmath75 component of the angular momentum @xmath76 with eigenvalue @xmath40 , where @xmath77 in which @xmath78 and @xmath79 the full system  ( [ code]-[scwode ] ) is once again spin degenerate since the change to @xmath80 produces the same system with the change ( @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 ) .",
    "although our scalar - dirac wavefunctions  ( [ swave ] ) are eigenfunctions of @xmath86 with eigenvalue @xmath87 , our solutions of the non - spherically symmetric case will vary slightly from these eigenfunctions .",
    "figure  [ d2 ] shows a numerical solution to the full system for the same parameter choice as in fig .",
    "note that the angular dependence is virtually indistinguishable from the approximate solution and that the energy agrees reasonably well with the first order perturbation approximation .",
    "we have found a class of solutions to the full maxwell - dirac equations and good approximate solutions via a scalar - dirac equation . in practice ,",
    "the approximate solution is easier to work with and provides better accuracy for most calculations .",
    "the issue of stability has not been directly addressed .",
    "the success of our iterative solution method suggests that each solution is stable in regard to slow collapse or expansion ; however , we suspect that each solution will be unstable via radiative transitions to states of large negative energy , as is any bound state solution to the dirac equation .",
    "the interpretation of our solution is not immediately clear .",
    "several authors have used similar solutions to construct hadrons from interacting quarks @xcite ; however , these solutions were to systems of nonlinear scalar fields interacting with the dirac field and the solutions were essentially a result of the nonlinear scalar self - interaction rather than the coupling term .",
    "as it exists now , we see that our class of solutions to the maxwell - dirac system may not be immediately interpreted as representing the leptons .",
    "this is clear from the large value of @xmath88 and negative value for @xmath42 for @xmath89 as well as from the experimental fact that weak interactions play the starring role in lepton transitions .",
    "it is not inconceivable that our solution could represent the leptons if we rework our analysis to accommodate the weak interaction .",
    "such an undertaking would present an interesting avenue for future work .",
    "i would like to express my appreciation to roger dashen and henry abarbanel for their encouragement and guidance and to the hopgood foundation and the san diego chapter of the arcs foundation for their support .",
