    "the suspicion that the fundamental , short distance description of string theory may not involve strings has existed for a number of years , based on the theory s behavior at high energies and at large orders in perturbation theory ( for a review of these arguments with references , see the final two chapters of polchinski ( 1994 ) ) .",
    "in addition , developments in string duality ( for a recent review and references see hull ( 1995 ) ) have provided a picture of the vacuum structure of string theory which casts some doubts on its status as a fundamental theory . at various extremes of the moduli space of vacua",
    "a given string theory may have a weakly coupled description as a different string theory , as 11-dimensional supergravity , as `` m - theory '' ( schwarz 1995b , c ) , or as some other p - brane theory ( note however that hull ( 1995 ) has suggested that the perturbative states of the supersymmetric effective field theories are always strings or @xmath6-branes ) . furthermore , p - branes wrapped around homology cycles of the compactification manifold sometimes turn into string states when one condenses them , as happens in conifold transitions ( greene , morrison and strominger 1995 ) . wrapped @xmath7-brane states may also be related by duality to string states ( for a recent review and discussion see townsend 1995 ) .",
    "this has led some to suggest there may be a more `` democratic '' theory in which strings are treated on the same footing as other @xmath7-brane excitations ( becker , becker and strominger 1995 ; townsend 1995 ) .",
    "still , there is little indication as to what the underlying theory might be .",
    "m - theory has no definition beyond its being an 11-dimensional theory with supersymmetric 2-branes ; the quantum theory of 11-dimensional supergravity is unknown ; and the analog of the polyakov action for p - branes with @xmath8 is nonrenormalizable , partly due to the coupling to worldvolume gravity ( for a discussion of this point see van nieuwenhuizen 1987 ) .",
    "furthermore , one could argue that these dualities are merely features of the low energy theory , and that one particular object defines the short distance theory . as an analogy",
    ", one may write a theory of strongly coupled electrons in a one - dimensional metal , described by the massive thirring model .",
    "there will be a weakly coupled description in terms of the sine - gordon model ( coleman 1975 ) , but the theory defined at the lattice scale really is a theory of electrons .",
    "so in the case of `` string '' theory there seems to be no reason to privilege any one @xmath7-brane state as fundamental , but there is no obvious reason not to , beyond the high energy and large - genus problems alluded to above .",
    "one possibility for a more fundamental description of string theory is suggested by some recurring hints that the worldsheet might be secretly four dimensional , propagating in a spacetime with more than one timelike signature .",
    "atick and witten ( 1988 ) suggested that the time direction might be complexified , based on an attempt to interpret the high - temperature behavior of string theory .",
    "witten ( 1988 ) suggested that both the worldsheet and spacetime might be secretly complexified .",
    "this was based on a comparison of instantons in an orbifolded topological @xmath9-model with classical configurations dominating high energy string scattering processes ( gross and mende 1987,1988;polchinski 1988 ) .",
    "blencowe and duff ( 1988 ) conjectured that the maximum possible spacetime dimensions for a @xmath7-brane theory were 12 ; this arose from demanding equal bose and fermi degrees of freedom on the worldvolume , while allowing for a spacetime supersymmetry group other than the super - poincar group .",
    "as an example they mentioned a @xmath4 dimensional object in a @xmath5 dimensional spacetime that might be related to the type @xmath10 string by double dimensional reduction .",
    "more recently , hull ( 1995 ) has suggested an @xmath11-dimensional `` y - theory '' in order to explain certain 6-dimensional supergravity theories with exotic soliton spectra .",
    "still more recently , kutasov and martinec ( 1996 ) have found that the bosonic string in 26 dimensions ; the heterotic and type iib strings in 10 dimensions ; a bosonic 27 dimensions ; and a supermembrane in 11 dimensions can all be found as different vacua of the @xmath1 supersymmetric heterotic string constructed by ooguri and vafa ( 1991b ) . the open string and examples involving orbifold and orientifold compactifications of string- and m - theory",
    "have been found found by kutasov , martinec and oloughlin ( 1996 ) . in these constructions",
    "the target space is in fact a @xmath12-dimensional object , with a @xmath4-dimensional worldvolume , living in a flat @xmath5-dimensional ( or @xmath13-dimensional if we give up target space supersymmetry ) ; one or two of these dimensions are gauged away by a left - moving timelike or null @xmath3 current on the worldsheet of the @xmath1 string . which string or membrane theory one gets depends on how one realizes the left - moving @xmath3 and how one performs the @xmath14 projection .",
    "the target space theory has a lot of structure : it seems to be self - dual gravity coupled to self - dual yang - mills fields , in the presence of a covariantly conserved timelike or null killing vector ( ooguri and vafa 1991b ; see also pierce 1996 ) .",
    "this might be enough structure to allow the @xmath12-dimensional object to be quantized directly .",
    "simultaneously , vafa ( 1996 ) has suggested a @xmath5-dimensional `` f - theory '' in order to explain the @xmath15 duality of type iib string theory ( schwarz 1995a ) directly in 10 dimensions ; he also suggested that this was required by gauge fields living on the worldsheets of the d - strings of iib string theory .",
    "the @xmath15 duality suggests a hidden torus whose modular group is precisely this duality group , and the gauge field on the d - string requires an increase of 2 in the critical dimension due to the @xmath3 worldsheet ghosts .",
    "vafa further suggested that a geometrization of the @xmath3 algebra would add an additional two dimensions to the worldsheet , though how this comes about and how these extra two dimensions are mapped into spacetime is unknown .",
    "tseytlin ( 1996 ) also simultaneously proposed a @xmath11 dimensional theory of dirichlet @xmath16-branes ( with a worldvolume signature of @xmath17 ) , based on an interpretation of the gauge fields living on the self - dual @xmath16-brane of type iib string theory .",
    "given this small explosion of suggestions of a theory of 4-dimensional worldvolumes in 12 dimensions , we would like to begin to understand what precisely this theory might be .",
    "the @xmath1 string gives us a solid starting point ; it has all known string theories and @xmath18-theory as different vacua , and it should have a definite target space theory which would describe the dynamics ( whatever this means in the presence of 2 timelike directions ) of these 3-dimensional objects .",
    "however , computations from the point of view of the @xmath19 string worldsheet seem rather unwieldy .",
    "the vertex operators of the underlying string theory describe at best linearized fluctuations of the target worldvolume ; and describing the quantum mechanics of the worldvolume requires the string field theory of the underlying @xmath19 string .    in this paper",
    "we will start to examine the target space theory by understanding the constraints on the @xmath9-model geometry of the @xmath1 string due to the worldsheet supersymmetry and left - moving @xmath3 current algebra .",
    "our attitude is that while the @xmath19 string may be unwieldy for describing the quantum mechanics of the theory , one should use whatever structure is available to gain insight ; in particular , an understanding of which fields the @xmath19 string can couple to should lead to some understanding of the configuration space of the @xmath16-brane theory .",
    "we will take a very small step in this direction , by deriving to @xmath20 the constraints on the target space fields due to the @xmath19 worldsheet supersymmetry and the additional left - moving @xmath3 symmetry .",
    "such constraints have been discussed previously ( hull 1986b , dine and seiberg 1986 , braden 1987 ) ; in all of these discussions , the internal sector of the heterotic string was described by left - moving fermions ( as these have the most natural coupling to the gauge fields ) and the left - moving supersymmetry was imposed at tree level .",
    "these authors thus found that was that the internal fermions did not propagate and the gauge field was forced to be trivial .",
    "however , it is known that supersymmetry may be nontrivially realized on free fermions ; in this case the algebra closes only at one loop ( goddard , nahm and olive 1985 ; goddard , kent and olive 1986 ; windey 1986 ; antoniadis  1986 ; gates , howe and hull 1989 ) .",
    "in order to get the correct coefficients of the current commutators , the internal supersymmetry currents must scale as @xmath21 ; therefore one - loop terms will appear at order @xmath20 in the commutator of the left - moving supersymmetry current @xmath22 with itself .",
    "we will also find that @xmath23 corrections to the internal gauge fields ( equation ) and to the supersymmetry current ( equation ) mix with the internal supersymmetry currents to produce terms in @xmath24 at @xmath20 .",
    "the result is that the internal theory can in fact be nontrivial in the presence of a left - moving superconformal symmetry .",
    "the left - moving fermionic sector of the theory gives a nice geometrical structure ( see also braden ( 1987 ) ) .",
    "one may describe the left - moving fields of the @xmath1 string with 4 bosonic worldvolume coordinates and 28 fermions living in some vector bundle @xmath25 fibered over the worldvolume .",
    "it is only after imposing supersymmetry that 4 of these fermions are associated with the left - moving excitations of the worldvolume coordinates and the gauge curvature in these directions is set equal to the worldvolume curvature .",
    "the identification of the tangent plane of the worldvolume can and will vary fiber by fiber in @xmath25 , as specified by the supersymmetry current ; this identification will split @xmath25 into `` tangent '' and `` normal '' bundles .",
    "furthermore , the fibers of the `` normal '' bundle must live in the adjoint representation of some lie group ( which may be a product group ) ; this group structure is encoded by the left - moving supersymmetry current as well .",
    "thus the supersymmetry current adds some additional structure .",
    "constraints on this structure and on the @xmath9-model geometry are found in equations , , , , , and .",
    "if we interpret the target space theory as describing the imbedding of a @xmath4-dimensional object in some spacetime , @xmath25 should be related ( nontrivially , as we will argue ) to the spacetime .",
    "more structure will arise as the @xmath1 string has a gauged , left - moving @xmath3 supercurrent .",
    "we will find that the piece of the @xmath3 current acting on the internal fermions must scale as @xmath21 , and so as with the supersymmetry algebra we will find that one - loop terms arise at order @xmath20 , and that we will have to add a piece scaling as @xmath26 to the supercurrent ( equation ) in order to maintain consistency .",
    "the constraints on the geometry and the supercurrent to @xmath20 are shown in equations , , , and .",
    "the upshot is that the target space possesses a null or timelike covariantly conserved killing vector ; if it is timelike , there must be an @xmath27 piece of the supercurrent acting on the internal fermions to cancel the anomaly of the target space isometry .",
    "this thesis is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 is a review of known pertinent results .",
    "section 2.1 reviews the properties of @xmath1 strings with a flat target space ; it also reviews the realization of supersymmetry on free fermions .",
    "section 2.2 reviews the general @xmath9-model action for the heterotic string and the constraints arising from @xmath28 supersymmetry as derived by hull and witten ( 1985 ) .",
    "section 3 describes the left - moving supersymmetry and @xmath3 currents ; it also lists the transformations of the fundamental @xmath9-model fields under dirac brackets with these currents .",
    "section 4 contains the derivation of the constraints on the @xmath9-model geometry arising from the left - moving supersymmetry .",
    "section 5 contains the constraints due to the left - moving @xmath3 supercurrent .",
    "section 6 discusses of the physical and geometric interpretation of our results in terms of a 4-dimensional surface living in some spacetime .",
    "section 7 contains conclusions and a discussion of directions for further work .",
    "appendix a contains conventions for worldsheet and target space geometry .",
    "appendix b describes the dirac brackets of the @xmath1 @xmath9-model .",
    "finally , section c contains conventions for the worldsheet green s functions .    a note about nomenclature : in this paper the _",
    "right_-moving sector of the @xmath1 string will be the @xmath29 sector and the _ left_-moving sector will be the @xmath2 sector .",
    "this is the convention used by kutasov and martinec ( 1996 ) and kutasov , martinec and oloughlin ( 1996 ) .",
    "in order to get a feeling for the @xmath1 string we will first review the flat space theory . many features of the @xmath9-model in arbitrary backgrounds will be generalizations of this simple case ; also , the physical massless states of the theory should tell us which backgrounds to turn on .",
    "strings with gauged @xmath30 worldsheet supersymmetry have been studied by ademollo  ( 1976a , b ) ; fradkin and tseytlin ( 1981 , 1985a ) ; dadda and lizzi ( 1987 ) ; green ( 1987 ) ; and mathur and mukhi ( 1987 , 1988 ) .",
    "ooguri and vafa ( 1990 , 1991a ) explored the target space geometry more systematically by exploring the scattering amplitudes for physical states and the target space effective action one could deduce from these amplitudes .",
    "they also constructed heterotic string theories with gauged @xmath28 and @xmath19 supersymmetry ( 1990,1991b ) ; and @xmath19 heterotic string . in both papers",
    "the necessity of the left - moving @xmath3 current was missed , although in the latter a truncation to a 2-dimensional target space was assumed . ]",
    "we will review these constructions here .",
    "the right - moving sector of these theories includes in addition to the reparameterization and supersymmetry ghosts a pair of ghosts corresponding to the @xmath3 piece of the @xmath29 algebra ( the complex structure ) .",
    "the critical dimension of the right - movers is 4 , and @xmath29 susy requires a complex structure ( alvarez - gaum and freedman 1981 ; hull and witten 1985 ) , so we must have either @xmath31 or @xmath32 signature .",
    "we will choose the latter .",
    "the left - moving bosons must then also have two timelike directions ( in particular , if the target space is noncompact ) ; however , the @xmath2 superconformal symmetry will only remove negative - norm states arising from one timelike direction .",
    "unitarity requires an additional left - moving @xmath3 gauge symmetry in order to remove the remaining negative - norm states .",
    "this gauging increases the critical dimension of the left - moving sector by 2 , as there will be faddev - popov ghosts associated with the @xmath3 .",
    "thus the matter sector of the left - movers of the @xmath28 string has @xmath33 ; the matter sector of the left - movers of the @xmath1 string has @xmath34 . for a free chiral superfield , or equivalently for three free majorana- weyl fermions .",
    "]    since the left - moving @xmath3 current is gauged , nilpotency of the brst charge requires that this current must have a vanishing operator product with itself ( ooguri and vafa 1991b ) . in the case of the @xmath35 string in flat space",
    ", the @xmath3 current will have the form @xmath36 where @xmath37 denote both the left - moving target worldvolume coordinates and the chiral scalars of the internal sector .",
    "it is easy to see that the condition for the vanishing ope of this current with itself is @xmath38 .",
    "the internal sector of the @xmath35 string can be represented by 24 chiral scalars which live in the maximal torus of a rank 24 group .",
    "the physical states of the theory depend on the direction of the left - moving @xmath3 , i.e. on whether the vector has any components in the internal direction . with no components of the @xmath3 in the internal direction",
    "the null isometry in @xmath4 dimensions kills off the gravitational dynamics of the target worldvolume gravitational dynamics , so that the only excitations come from the internal sector and correspond to the gauge bosons of the internal gauge group .",
    "scattering amplitudes indicate that the target spacetime theory is the self - dual yang - mills theory in @xmath4 dimensions , reduced to a @xmath39-dimensional theory by the isometry . if the @xmath3 has components in the internal direction , then the spacetime isometry is timelike and so the target spacetime is effectively @xmath12-dimensional . in this case",
    "there is some spacetime boson which is a remnant of the boson describing self - dual gravity in the @xmath40 string ( ooguri and vafa 1990 , 1991a ) .",
    "there are also the internal gauge fields as before ; the gauge symmetry is partly broken by the internal part of the @xmath3 ( ooguri and vafa 1991b ) . in this case",
    "the theory describes some sort of coupling of self - dual yang - mills and self - dual gravity .    for the @xmath1 string ooguri and",
    "vafa represented the internal sector by eight chiral scalars and their fermionic superpartners .",
    "they found that the only massless states correspond to the 8-dimensional ground state of the ramond sector of the internal fermions and to the 8 neveu - schwarz states created by single fermion oscillators acting on the vacuum .",
    "ooguri and vafa therefore claimed that the internal sector has no group structure .",
    "however , one can find other realizations of the internal sector which do contain gauge symmetry .",
    "for example , pierce ( 1996 ) used a free fermion construction of the internal scft , and found that the massless states in the adjoint of a 24-dimensional lie algebra with the fermions living in the adjoint of this group . as we will use the fermionic representation of the @xmath19 @xmath9-model below ,",
    "let us review supersymmetric theories of free majorana - weyl fermions .",
    "given a theory with free left - moving majorana - weyl fermions @xmath41 , one may realize an affine lie algebra with fermion bilinears ( for a review and references see goddard and olive 1986 ) .",
    "if we let the fermions live in the adjoint representation of a lie group @xmath42 , one may realize a worldsheet current algebra corresponding to this group : @xmath43 where the coefficients @xmath44 are the structure constants of the @xmath42 .",
    "there is a well - known @xmath2 supersymmetry in such theories ( goddard , nahm and olive 1985 ; goddard , kent and olive 1986 ; windey 1986 ; antoniadis  1986 ) , where the supersymmetry charge is @xmath45 this realization with fermions living in the adjoint of a group is general .",
    "following windey ( 1986 ) and antoniadis  ( 1986 ) we can realize @xmath2 supersymmetry on a set of free majorana - weyl fermions by splitting them up into fermions living in the adjoint of some group @xmath42 and fermions living in some representation of that group . requiring that the superconformal algebra closes",
    "appropriately means that sum of these spaces is in fact the adjoint representation of some group @xmath46 and that @xmath47 is a homogeneous space .",
    "the level of the current algebra is the dual coxeter number of this group .",
    "ooguri and vafa ( 1991b ) used the vertex operator construction of the current algebra ( halpern 1975 ; frenkel and kac 1980 ; segal 1981 ; gross  1985 , 1986 ) which is a level 1 construction .",
    "if we fermionized this theory we would find that the only current algebra compatible with left - moving supersymmetry at this level is @xmath48 .",
    "if we wish to find which states correspond to gauge bosons and what the gauge structure is , we need to choose an appropriate gso projection compatible with modular invariance .",
    "the spectrum of massless states and its group structure depends on the choice of susy current and on the gso projection ( pierce 1996 ) , just as in the free fermion models of type ii string theories with gauge symmetry ( kawai , llewellyn and tye 1986a , b and 1987a , b ; bluhm , dolan and goddard 1987 ) .",
    "in particular the construction of different string and membrane theories as target spaces of the @xmath19 string relies on the spectra one gets from different gso projections ( kutasov and martinec 1996 ) .",
    "it is also worth recalling the conditions for target space supersymmetry .",
    "since the right - moving part of the theory has gauged @xmath29 supersymmetry , the spectral flow is gauged ; thus the neveu - schwarz and ramond sectors of the right - movers are equivalent ( schwimmer and seiberg 1987 ; ooguri and vafa 1991b ) .",
    "spacetime supersymmetry must arise entirely from the left - movers ; however , a well - known theorem of friedan and shenker ( unpublished ; for a published description and discussion see section 2.4 of dixon , kaplunovsky and vafa ( 1987 ) ) states that target space supersymmetry and non - abelian gauge symmetry can not arise from the same sector .",
    "equivalently , target space supersymmetry exists if and only if the left - moving sector possesses global @xmath29 supersymmetry ( banks  1988 ; banks and dixon 1988 ) .",
    "thus , such a global supersymmetry is also incompatible with non - abelian gauge symmetry .",
    "indeed , the constructions of kutasov and martinec ( 1996 ) and kutasov , martinec and oloughlin ( 1996 ) which possess spacetime supersymmetry have no non - abelian structure .",
    "we are interested in the more general @xmath9-model which one would find upon condensing vertex operators corresponding to the massless bosonic physical states of the @xmath19 string . we know that in general the bosonic sector contains target space gravity and gauge fields .",
    "we will also include an antisymmetric tensor field , as torsion arises naturally in heterotic @xmath9-models : since no antisymmetric tensor field appears in the physical state spectrum this field will merely dress the gauge and gravitational excitations in solutions to the @xmath49-function equations .",
    "we can break up the fields of the @xmath1 sigma model into several pieces : @xmath50 target worldvolume coordinates which we can write as @xmath35 superfields , making the right - moving supersymmetry manifest ( dine and seiberg , 1986 ) ; @xmath50 left - moving majorana - weyl fermions to pair with the left - moving target space bosons ; and a piece describing the internal left - moving conformal field theory .",
    "the internal theory can be written as a set of @xmath51 real , left - moving fermions with indices in some @xmath51-dimensional tangent space , coupled to a background vector potential , as a set of @xmath52 left - moving chiral scalars paired to @xmath52 left - moving real fermions by the @xmath53 susy , or as any other left - moving @xmath54 superconformal field theory ; we will work with the fermionic representation , since the coupling to target space gauge fields is straightforward .",
    "the action for the target space bosons and their right - moving fermionic superpartners may be written in @xmath28 superspace following dine and seiberg ( 1986 ) : @xmath55 \\ . \\label{n2ract}\\ ] ] where we use the notation given in appendix a. the action in component form is ( hull and witten 1985 ) : @xmath56 \\ . \\label{ract}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we will work with this form , dropping the manifestly complex parameterization ; there will be a complex structure tensor @xmath57 with the properties required for @xmath28 supersymmetry , which we will discuss below .",
    "we could write the left - moving fermions in @xmath28 superspace as in dine and seiberg .",
    "this would force a hermitean structure on the vector bundle which the internal fermions live in , as required for off - shell closure of the @xmath29 algebra ( howe and papadopolous 1988 )",
    ". we will worry only about on - shell closure in this paper . in @xmath58",

    "\\label{flferm}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] there will also be a dilaton term appearing appearing in the action at @xmath66 ; in conformal gauge this should couple to the ghosts as described by banks , nemeschansky and sen ( 1986 ) .",
    "one may redefine the ghost fields in such a way that the dilaton does not appear in the action ; this transformation is anomalous , so the brst current picks up a term proportional to the dilaton at order @xmath67 ( for the superstring version of this in superspace , see aldazabal , hussain and zhang ( 1987 ) ) .",
    "this is of too high an order to appear in our @xmath20 calculation .",
    "the fermions live in a vector bundle @xmath25 with connection @xmath68 fibered over the target space ( hull and witten 1985 ) .",
    "we expect the left - moving supersymmetry to relate some 4-plane in each fiber to the tangent space of the worldvolume ; it should also somehow relate the `` tangent '' gauge connection to the spin connection ( indeed , we will find that the curvatures agree ) .",
    "we will not make this identification at the level of the action ; rather , all of the information encoding this identification will lie in the supersymmetry current .",
    "the advantages of this presentation will become clear when we discuss the interpretation of target space theory as a 4-dimensional worldvolume immersed in some spacetime .",
    "the combination of actions and is invariant under the supersymmetry transformation in equation is incorrect .",

    "we will describe the left - moving @xmath2 supersymmetry and @xmath3 via their current algebra . although we will work only to @xmath20 , the supersymmetry",
    "is realized quantum mechanically on the internal fermions and the algebra only closes to this order after including worldsheet loop effects in the commutators .",
    "we begin by building the supersymmetry current out of the most general terms which have dimension @xmath75 and the @xmath3 current out of terms which have dimension @xmath76 .",
    "we then ask that the algebra close properly and that the variation of the action under the classical transformations vanish up to the divergence of the currents , or , integrating by parts , up to terms of the form @xmath77 where @xmath78 parameterizes the variation , @xmath79 .",
    "since we want left - moving currents we also demand that @xmath80 vanish",
    ".    to order @xmath81 the equal - time commutators are usually just the tree - level poisson or dirac brackets of the currents . however , as we have discussed above , supersymmetry is realized nonlinearly and quantum mechanically on the internal fermions .",
    "it is easy to see that the operator product of the supersymmetry current with itself is : @xmath82 where we have explicitly included the @xmath67 factors coming from fermion loops .",
    "this is the correct operator product for the left - moving susy charge of a system with central charge @xmath83 within a multiplicative factor of @xmath67 ( for a discussion of this factor in path integral language see ( gates , howe and hull 1989 ) ) . to get operator product coefficients of the superconformal algebra we must rescale @xmath63",

    "the wavy line denotes a boson propagator .    since the constraints we have found require adding order @xmath23 terms to the action and to the supersymmetry current , the next step would be to check closure of the supersymmetry algebra at order @xmath23 .",

    "the diagram leading to the one - loop term proportional to @xmath181 is shown in figure 3 .",
    "if we evaluate this diagram using the conventions stated in appendix c , we find that the coefficient is @xmath182 .",

    ", the spacetime should be directly related to the configuration space of the target space fields , in analogy to the soliton string constructions of harvey and strominger ( 1995 ) and sen ( 1995 ) ; in these constructions the soliton string is the fundamental string of the dual theory , and the dual spacetime is the moduli space of zero - mode fluctuations around the soliton solution . in the @xmath1 constructions",

    "there are many issues which need to be resolved before we can construct a definitive interpretation of the @xmath19 target space theory .",
    "one problem is that the normal and tangent gauge fields do not seem to have the same status .",
    "the transverse gauge fields have a natural interpretation as coordinates ; the tangent gauge fields , however , seem to be mapped into the spin connection of the 4-volume .",

    "perhaps the @xmath19 @xmath9 model gives some sort of static gauge description of imbedded 4-volumes .",
    "supersymmetry seems to give us geometric constraints on the imbedding of 4-volumes into spacetime ; the classical equations of motion for the target worldvolume are simply be the @xmath49-function equations for the heterotic string ( callan  1985 ; fradkin and tseytlin 1985b ; lovelace 1986 ; sen 1986 ; hull 1986a ; bonneau and valent 1994 ) .",

    "we have clearly taken only a small , if necessary , step towards understanding the classical and quantum dynamics of the target space of @xmath1 strings .",
    "however , we can begin to see what questions to ask .    at present",
    "there is no obvious way to describe the imbedding of these world volumes in a more general , curved spacetime .",
    "one possibility comes from the fact that the self - dual yang - mills equations are equivalent to the classical equations of motion for a four dimensional generalization of the wzw model ( nair and schiff 1990 , 1992 ) .",
    "this model looks like a 4-dimensional @xmath9-model with an extra wess - zumino term , where the @xmath9-model fields live in a group manifold .",
    "there is some belief that this theory exists as a quantum theory and has some current algebra structure similar to the 2-dimensional wzw model ( losev  1995 ) .",
    "if we could understand better if and why this model exists , and how we might couple it to the gravity sector of the @xmath1 target space , we might be able to generalize the wzw@xmath279 model to more general target spaces .",
    "we might also hope to make contact with other recent suggestions of @xmath4-dimensional worldvolumes in @xmath5-dimensional spacetimes .",
    "many results have been obtained by compactifying f - theory on restricted classes of k3 surfaces ( vafa 1996 ) , calabi - yau threefolds ( morrison and vafa 1996 ) , and other manifolds ( witten 1996a , b ) ; one can make statements about the theory in curved space , unlike the theory presented in this paper . on the other hand ,",
    "it is not clear what the `` fundamental '' objects are ; there are only some suggestions , discussed in the introduction , that they might be four dimensional .",
    "furthermore , the principles for constructing f - theory vacua are unknown ; the aforementioned results for compactifications of f - theory come from comparing the moduli space of the compactification manifold with the moduli space of other theories",
    ". it would be nice if there was a direct connection between f - theory and the @xmath19 string , as there are some analogous structures , but how to make this link is not obvious",
    ".    it may be that if and when we successfully define a perturbation theory of sums over 4-volumes , that this theory will break down at high energies and large orders just as string theory seems to .",
    "this is no reason not to go forward ; string theory has done remarkably well in providing hints of its underlying structure , and has even given us enough information ( by constraining the low - energy vacua ) to find some of its nonperturbative physics .",
