    "the standard cosmological model has been successful in describing the early universe , it is supported by a number of important observations : the expansion of the universe , the abundance of the light elements and the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation .",
    "these three measurable signatures strongly support the notion that our universe evolved from a dense , nearly featureless hot gas , just as the big bang model predicts .",
    "however it fails to explain some serious problems like the nature of dark matter and dark energy ; and the dominance of matter over antimatter .    from a theoretical point of view",
    ", there is no justification to assume that the universe started its evolution with a defined baryon asymmetry ; @xmath5 .",
    "the natural assumption is that the universe was initially neutral .",
    "direct observations show that the universe contains no appreciable primordial antimatter .",
    "in addition , the success of big bang nucleosynthesis requires that the ratio of the effective baryon number ( @xmath6 ) to the entropy density should be between @xcite @xmath7 this number has been independently determined to be @xmath8 from precise measurements of the relative heights of the first two microwave background ( @xmath9 ) acoustic peaks by the wmap satellite @xcite .",
    "thus how can one understand the origin of this asymmetry ?",
    "this is what is called the problem of baryogenesis ( for a review see @xcite ) . in 1967 , sakharov forwarded his three conditions for baryogenesis @xcite , which are summarized in the existence of processes which : @xmath10 violate @xmath11 number , @xmath12 violate @xmath13 and @xmath14 symmetries ; and @xmath15 take place out of equilibrium .",
    "one of the most interesting scenarios for baryogenesis is the electroweak baryogenesis ( for a review , see @xcite ) , where the third sakharov condition is realized via a strong first order phase transition at the electroweak scale .    in gauge theories",
    ", a first order phase transition takes place if the vacuum of the theory does not correspond to the global minimum of the potential .",
    "since it is energetically unfavored , the field changes its value to the true vacuum ( i.e. the absolute minimum of the potential ) .",
    "because of the existence of a barrier between the two minima , this mechanism can happen by tunneling or thermal fluctuations via bubble nucleation .",
    "the electroweak baryogenesis scenario is realized when the @xmath11 and @xmath14 violating interactions pass through the bubble wall .",
    "these interactions are very fast outside the bubbles but suppressed inside .",
    "then a net baryon asymmetry results inside the bubbles which are expanding and filling the universe at the end .    in order to compute the net baryon number ,",
    "the rate of @xmath11 violating processes in the broken phase is needed . in the standard model , @xmath11 number",
    "is violated at the quantum level @xcite , where the transition between two topologically distinct @xmath16 ground states is possible .",
    "the transition between two neighboring ground states breaks both lepton and baryon numbers by @xmath17 . to find the rate of @xmath11 violating processes",
    ", one needs to know the sphaleron solution , which is a static field configuration that interpolates between the two distinct ground states .",
    "the sphaleron configuration was found in @xcite for the @xmath16 model .    a model - independent condition in order that the phase transition be strong enough was derived in @xcite : @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the sphaleron energy and the critical temperature , respectively . since it was shown in  @xcite that @xmath21 , ) is valid also for the mssm . ]",

    "is not large enough ; also this leads to an unacceptable upper bound on the higgs mass @xcite @xmath24    the constraint gets even stronger when the two - loops effect and a proper treatment of the top quark are included @xcite .",
    "it is clear that this bound is in contradiction with the lower bound coming from lep @xmath25 @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "but this severe bound can be avoided by adding a complex scalar singlet that couples only to the higgs doublet with an appropriate choice of the theory parameters in a way that the singlet does not develop a vev @xcite .",

    "to find the boundary conditions of ( [ difeq ] ) , one should take into account that the energy functional ( [ enfuncs ] ) should be finite .",
    "it is clear that in order for the contributions of the second and fourth terms in ( [ enfuncs ] ) to be finite , @xmath120 must go to unity at the limit @xmath184 .",
    "according to the sphaleron definition , scalars go to their vacuum at the infinity , i.e. @xmath185 @xmath186 when @xmath184 , which makes the last term contribution to ( enfuncs ) finite .",
    "thus one can write all the functions as @xmath187 , and find the values of @xmath188 and @xmath189by inserting this behavior into the differential equations ( [ difeq ] ) .    in the limit @xmath190 ,",
    "let us assume that the functions @xmath120 , @xmath74 and @xmath191 have the profiles@xmath192where @xmath193 , @xmath194 and @xmath195 are some positive constants",
    ". in this limit , ( [ difeq ] ) can be approximated as@xmath196    from the second equation in ( [ eqappr ] ) , one can easily conclude that @xmath197 or @xmath198 , however the second choice makes the energy functional integral ( [ enfuncs ] ) divergent , thus @xmath199 or @xmath200 . using this result",
    ", one can conclude from first equation in ( [ eqappr ] ) that @xmath120 @xmath201 .",
    "however the situation is different for the last equation ( [ eqappr ] ) , then one can make@xmath202then inserting ( [ profiles ] ) in ( [ expvs ] ) , one finds that the only possibilities are @xmath203 and @xmath204 , where the first choice is excluded in order that the energy functional integral ( [ enfuncs ] ) to be convergent , thus @xmath205 .",
    "therefore at @xmath206 , @xmath121 satisfies the boundary condition of neumann type , while @xmath120 and @xmath74 satisfy those of dirichlet type .",

    "<S> it is widely believed that the existence of singlet scalars in some standard model extensions can easily make the electroweak phase transition strongly first order , which is needed for the electroweak baryogenesis scenario . in this paper </S>",

    "<S> we find that the phase transition is stronger by adding a singlet ; and also that the criterion for a strong phase transition @xmath0 , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) is the singlet vev in the broken ( symmetric ) phase , is not valid for models containing singlets , even though often used in the literature . </S>",
    "<S> the usual condition @xmath4 is more meaningful , and it is satisfied for a large part of the parameter space for physically allowed higgs masses . </S>"
