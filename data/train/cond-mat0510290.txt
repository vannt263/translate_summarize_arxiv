    "nematic phases of matter have been widely studied in many different areas of condensed matter physics @xcite .",
    "for example , consider a system of molecules having some vector quantity ( say a polarization vector @xmath0 ) associated with each of them . since molecules are extended objects , a local coordinate system can be attached to each molecule .",
    "hence , for a molecule at a point @xmath1 , one can define a local nematic order parameter : @xmath2 @xcite . the nematic phase is then defined as the state of the system for which @xmath3 whereas @xmath4 becomes a traceless @xmath5 matrix with eigenvalues @xmath6 $ ] .",
    "such phases are of two types : uniaxial nematic where @xmath7 and biaxial nematic for which @xmath8@xcite . in both these phases ,",
    "the system breaks rotational symmetries while preserving translational invariance .",
    "uniaxial nematic phases occurs more frequently whereas the first experimental observation of biaxial nematic phase in a classical system of molecules has only been recently reported @xcite .",
    "although much more difficult to realize , biaxial nematic phases are of great theoretical interest since they are known to support non - abelian defects @xcite .",
    "uniaxial nematic phases have also been studied in the context of several quantum condensed matter systems such as strongly correlated electron systems @xcite and ultracold spin - one atoms in optical lattice@xcite .",
    "for example , in the case of spin - one boson system , in some parameter regime , the ground state breaks spin - rotational invariance along one of the axes while maintaining translational invariance with no spin - order @xmath9 and with two equal non - zero eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath10 . however , there has been no proposals of realization of biaxial nematic ground states in the context of quantum condensed matter systems using standard local hamiltonians .    in this work ,",
    "we point out that disordered @xmath11 rotor models with quadrupolar interaction in two dimensions ( 2d ) can exhibit biaxial nematic phase in the disordered averaged sense .",
    "such rotor models are described by the hamiltonian @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a unit vector expressed in terms of the rotor angles @xmath14 and @xmath15 , @xmath16 denotes angular momentum of the rotor , @xmath17 denotes sum over nearest neighbor sites , and @xmath18 are dimensionless random couplings between the unit vectors @xmath19 at sites @xmath1 and @xmath20 . in the following we shall consider @xmath21 , and choose @xmath22 to have gaussian distributions with same width @xmath23 and means @xmath24 .",
    "the main result of this work is that in the limit @xmath25 , the model given by eq .",
    "[ model1 ] exhibits a biaxial nematic ground state in the disordered average sense for @xmath26 .",
    "we also show , using a mean - field analysis , that the biaxial phase is stable against quantum fluctuations until @xmath27 is reduced to a critical value @xmath28 .",
    "note that the above - mentioned regime can also be reached for arbitrarily weak disorder : @xmath29 provided that @xmath30 .",
    "this particular feature of the rotor model , as we shall see , makes it easily realizable using ultracold atoms in optical lattices .",
    "the choice of the rotor hamiltonian ( eq .  [ model1 ] ) is not arbitrary , but is motivated by their connection with ultracold spin - one bosons in an optical lattice .",
    "the low energy effective hamiltonian of such bosons systems has been derived in the absence of disorder in refs .  .",
    "it has been shown that the effective theory of the mott phases of such a system can be described , in the limit of large number of bosons per site , by rotor models similar to eq .",
    "[ model1 ] , supplemented by an additional constraint on the number @xmath31 and the total spin @xmath32 of the bosons per site : @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "we generalize this analysis to include disorder and show that in the presence of spin - dependent disordered optical lattices , which can be easily created by using a speckled laser field @xcite , the mott phases of ultracold spin - one bosons is indeed described by eq .",
    "[ model1 ] supplemented by the constraint condition mentioned above .",
    "further , as will be shown later , for @xmath26 , the constraint condition becomes irrelevant and in this limit we expect our analysis of the rotor model to apply for the bosons as well .",
    "this correspondence therefore allows us to suggest experiments on ultracold atoms which can in principle probe such a biaxial nematic phase .",
    "we suggest a straightforward imaging of ultracold atoms using a polarized laser beam which can distinguish the biaxial phase from other spin or uniaxial nematic phases .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ rotor ] , we analyze the rotor model ( eq .  [ model1 ] ) and demonstrate that it exhibits a biaxial nematic ground state .",
    "this is followed by sec .",
    "[ effective ] , where we derive the effective low - energy hamiltonian of spin - one ultracold bosons in a spin - dependent disordered optical lattice and discuss its relation to the rotor model analyzed in sec .  [ rotor ] . in sec.[detection ]",
    ", we suggest an experiment to detect biaxial nematic order .",
    "finally , we conclude in sec.[conclu ] .",
    "in this section , we first present an analysis of the rotor model ( eq .  [ model1 ] ) and demonstrate the presence of biaxial nematicity at @xmath34 .",
    "this is followed by the derivation and analysis of a mean field theory for finite @xmath35 which illustrates the stability of the biaxial phase against small quantum fluctuations .      for @xmath36 , in the absence of quantum fluctuations ,",
    "the hamiltonian ( eq ,  [ model1 ] ) is diagonal in the @xmath37 basis .",
    "this allows us to write @xmath38 where @xmath39 is given by @xmath40 with @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "let us now consider a ground state configuration of the hamiltonian @xmath43 given by @xmath44 where @xmath45 denotes the value of the angles @xmath14 and @xmath15 at the @xmath1th site in the ground state . from eqs .",
    "[ hamu0 ] and [ aij ] , one can immediately see that @xmath46 has an infinite number of degenerate ground states since any local transformation @xmath47 , @xmath48 leaves @xmath43 invariant for any random set of @xmath49 .",
    "it is also easy to see that such a local transformation changes @xmath50 and leaves the local nematic order parameter @xmath51 invariant .",
    "hence for the purpose of computing the nematic order parameter , we can choose any one of these ground state configurations .",
    "the rotor hamiltonian @xmath52 is also invariant under two global transformations .",
    "the first of them @xmath53 is a gauge freedom which allows us to choose the orientation of the global @xmath54 axis . the second transformation @xmath55 leaves the diagonal components of @xmath56 invariant while changing the off - diagonal components .",
    "the ground states @xmath57 ( eq .  [ groundwave1 ] ) and @xmath58 are degenerate .    using the above - mentioned local and global transformation properties",
    ", we can considerably simplify the numerical procedure for obtaining ground states of @xmath46 for a given disorder realization .",
    "first , from eq",
    ".  [ aij ] , we find that any ground - state configuration @xmath57 will always have @xmath59 . using the transformation @xmath60 , we can therefore choose each individual @xmath61 to be either @xmath62 or @xmath63 .",
    "this is a gauge choice and , hence , does not affect any physical quantity .",
    "next instead of using @xmath57 to compute @xmath64 , we find the state @xmath65 , for which @xmath66 at every site .",
    "this can be done since @xmath65 is always a part of the degenerate states which can be reached from @xmath57 by successive application of the above - mentioned local transformation .",
    "using these two facts , we see that for any set of random coefficients @xmath49 , one can compute @xmath67 by finding the ground state configuration of @xmath68 with @xmath69 the ground states of @xmath70 is two - fold degenerate and these two ground states @xmath71 and @xmath72 are related by the global transformation @xmath73 .",
    "the two ground states have opposite signs for off - diagonal elements of @xmath74 in the chosen gauge and therefore after averaging over these ground states , the off - diagonal elements of @xmath74 vanishes .",
    "thus we are finally left with the diagonal components @xmath75 , where @xmath76 , for a given set of random coefficients @xmath49 .",
    "finally , one can numerically average over different realizations @xmath77 to obtain the disorder - averaged nematic order parameter . the biaxial nematic phase is realized when @xmath78 , @xmath79 or @xmath80 .",
    "the ground state of @xmath81 can be obtained numerically using standard minimization procedure for each disorder realization . for the sake of brevity ,",
    "we choose @xmath82 to be a set of random numbers having a gaussian distribution with same standard deviation @xmath23 and different means @xmath24 and average over @xmath83 disorder realizations .",
    "we choose @xmath84 here without loss of generality .",
    "we study finite - size systems with sizes ranging from @xmath85 to @xmath86 with periodic boundary conditions and use standard @xmath87 extrapolation to obtain the infinite system size limit@xcite . a few comments about the numerical procedure",
    "are in order here .",
    "first , for @xmath88 , it is clear that the system energy reaches its minimum at @xmath89 and @xmath90 for all sites and disorder realizations .",
    "consequently , after disorder - averaging , @xmath91 , and the ground state is an uniaxial nematic phase .",
    "second , in the limit @xmath92 , for a given disorder realization , we find that the configuration with minimum energy is part of a group of three possible solutions .",
    "the first corresponds to @xmath93 and @xmath94 for all sites . for a single disorder realization with this solution",
    ", the order parameter then has @xmath95 .",
    "the second solution possibly assumed by the system is @xmath96 and @xmath97 for all sites .",
    "the value of the order parameter corresponding to such a disorder realization is then given by @xmath98 . finally , the third possible solution corresponds to a configuration for which @xmath99 and @xmath100 are neither @xmath62 nor @xmath101 , and are varying in values from site to site .",
    "for such a disorder realization , @xmath102 , @xmath79 or @xmath80 and one has a biaxial nematic .",
    "however , having @xmath102 , @xmath79 or @xmath80 for a single disorder realization does not guarantee that the system is biaxially ordered .",
    "the system can in fact be separated into domains , each domain representing one of the three possible solutions .",
    "for example , the system could be separated into domains representing only the first and second type of solutions and still have @xmath102 , @xmath79 or @xmath80 .",
    "nonetheless , this situation is unlikely ; in most cases where @xmath102 , @xmath79 or @xmath80 we find that the system adopts the third solution .",
    "nevertheless , as mentioned previously , to find the physically meaningful ground state , we need to average over many disorder realizations and by doing so restore the translational invariance of the system .",
    "consequently , @xmath78 , @xmath79 or @xmath80 can be used only after disorder - averaging to determine whether the system is biaxially ordered for certain disorder strength .",
    "the result of the numerical calculation , which corroborates the above discussion , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . after fitting second order polynomial functions to our data and extrapolating the resulting functions to @xmath103 , we find that for @xmath104 , the ground state is biaxial nematic with @xmath105 . for intermediate or larger values of @xmath106 , @xmath91 and",
    "we have an uniaxial nematic ground state .",
    "so this demonstrates that for @xmath36 , the rotor model exhibits a biaxial nematic ground state in the disordered average sense in the limit @xmath107 . in the next subsection",
    ", we study the effect of quantum fluctuations on this state .",
    "a comment about the validity of the @xmath87 extrapolation is in order here .",
    "this procedure definitely leaves open a possibility that a large enough system size has not been reached in our numerics and the biaxial nematic state seen here is an artifact of finite system size .",
    "the resolution of this question , within our numerical procedure , is not straightforward .",
    "however , we can be certain that even if this is the case , with small enough @xmath108 , the biaxial phase will manifest itself over a large window of energy scale at finite temperature , even if the zero temperature ground state turns out to be uniaxial nematic .      to study the effect of quantum fluctuations , it is more convenient to switch to a path integral representation of the rotor hamiltonian ( eq .  [ model1 ] ) . to this end , we first write the partition function of our hamiltonian as @xmath110 \\label{pf1 } \\\\ t & = & u \\sum_i l_i^2 \\label { kin1}\\\\ v & = & -g \\sum_{abcd } \\sum_{\\langle ij\\rangle } d_{ia } d_{jb } \\gamma^{abcd}_{ij } d_{ic } d_{jd } \\label{potential}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have introduced the notation @xmath111 . to obtain the partition function we calculate the trace in ( [ pf1 ] ) by writing it as a path integral over @xmath112 time slices , and then inserting a complete set of coherent states @xmath37 over each slice , so that @xmath113^m   \\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\int { \\mathcal d}\\theta { \\mathcal d}\\phi \\prod_{\\alpha=0}^{m-1 } \\left < \\theta(\\tau_{\\alpha+1});\\phi(\\tau_{\\alpha+1})\\right| \\exp\\left[-\\delta \\tau t\\right ] \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\times \\exp\\left[-\\delta\\tau v\\right ] \\left|\\theta(\\tau_{\\alpha } ) ; \\phi(\\tau_{\\alpha})\\right > \\label{pf2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath114 .",

    "a spin - dependent disordered potential @xmath157 can be generated by superposing a speckled laser field on a sinusoidal spin - dependent lattice potential @xmath170 .",
    "the spin dependence of the sinusoidal potential can be achieved by tuning the laser frequency close to the hyperfine splitting ( but far away from the fine structure splitting ) of the atoms @xcite . in appendix",

    "generation of the disordered potential @xmath172 can be achieved by reflecting a laser at the same frequency but with a much lower intensity off a speckled mirror .",
    "the net lattice potential seen by the atoms at spin state @xmath173 is then @xmath174 . in what follows",
    ", we shall consider the situation where the speckled field laser is weak compared to the one generating the sinusoidal potential such that @xmath175 .    for free ultracold atoms in an optical lattice , the energy eigenstates are bloch wave functions and a superposition of these bloch states yields a set of wannier functions which are well localized on the individual lattice sites for deep lattices @xcite .",
    "the energies involved in the system dynamics being small compared to excitation energies to the second band , we expand the boson field operators in the wannier basis and keep only the lowest states , @xmath176 .",
    "consequently , the many - body hamiltonian ( [ mbh ] ) reduces to @xcite @xmath177 where @xmath178 is the spin - one boson operator at site @xmath1 with spin projection @xmath179 , @xmath180 is the boson density at site @xmath1 , @xmath181 is the spin operator ( @xmath182 being the spin rotation matrices for spin - one bosons ) , @xmath183 is the chemical potential , and @xmath184 are given by @xmath185 so that @xmath186 for @xmath171 .",
    "note that for weak speckled fields , we always have @xmath187 , where @xmath188 and @xmath189 are the standard deviation and average of the hopping coefficient @xmath190 .",

    "as we shall see , this is precisely the regime where one expects to see the biaxial phase .",
    "also we note that due to the on - site disordered potential , the chemical potential @xmath193 should also be site - dependent .",
    "however , @xmath193 has only a power law dependence on disorder by comparison to an exponential dependence for the hopping coefficients .",
    "consequently , the standard deviation of @xmath193 is small and does not influence the nature of the mott states .",
    "so we replaced @xmath193 by its average value @xmath183 in eq .",
    "notice that this approximation is valid only when the potential due to the speckled field is weak compared to the one due to the sinusoidal field .",

    "first , as is customary in most of the experiments in ultracold atoms @xcite , we switch off both the lattice potential and the trap , and let the atoms expand freely . we then probe the expanding cloud by a right - circular ( @xmath217 ) polarized laser beam .",

    "if the laser frequency is too far detuned from hyperfine splitting frequency of the atomic levels , @xmath223 vanishes and the nematic order is not probed . on the other hand ,",
    "if the laser frequency is not detuned enough from the hyperfine splitting frequency , there will be significant absorption which will weaken the intensity of the transmitted light . as shown in ref .",
    ", there indeed exist a window for several spin - one atom species where the imaging can be done .",

    ", the presence of spin order @xmath230 in the atom cloud gives a phase shift to the atoms whereas a nematic order leads to a left - circular ( @xmath231 ) polarized component in the transmitted beam .",
