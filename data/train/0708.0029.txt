    "the two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) in a bilayer quantum hall system has a broken - symmetry ground state at filling factor @xmath0 that can be described as a pseudospin ferromagnet .",
    "this state is characterized by finite interlayer coherence even in the absence of tunneling .",
    "interlayer coherence is maintained if the interlayer separation @xmath11 is lower than a critical separation which is of the order of @xmath12 at zero electrical bias where @xmath13 is the magnetic length .",
    "this state has been extensively studied , both experimentally and theoretically ( for a review , see ref . ) .",
    "its collective excitation@xcite , which has been detected experimentally@xcite , is a pseudospin wave mode in which the pseudospins precess around their equilibrium orientations .    in most studies of the interlayer coherent states at @xmath0 or at other filling factors where states such as wigner crystals , skyrmion crystals or bilayer stripes are predicted ,",
    "it is assumed that the 2deg is spin polarized so that the non - interacting 2deg can be mapped onto a two - level system with bonding and anti - bonding states .",
    "recent experimentskumadaprl , spielmanprl , however , cast some doubt on the validity of this assumption .",
    "to explain these recent experimental findings , it seems that the ground state should be partially spin depolarized .    a previous study@xcite ( which we refer to as paper i  in the rest of this article ) presented various zero - temperature phases of the 2deg in a bilayer quantum hall system when the filling factor is varied around @xmath0 , so that a finite density of charged excitations is introduced in the ground state .",
    "working in the hartree - fock approximation , various symmetry breaking fields were present in the system : tunnelling @xmath14 , zeeman @xmath15 and electrical bias @xmath16 , over a range of experimentally relevant filling factors ( @xmath17 ) and interlayer separations ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "the phase diagram depends sensitively on the interplay of the different symmetry breaking fields as well as filling factor and interlayer separation . in some regions of the phase diagram ,",
    "the 2deg is pseudospin polarized and the charged excitations are skyrmions with real spin texture ( i.e. , spin - skyrmions ) while in regions where the zeeman coupling dominates , the 2deg is spin - polarized and the charged excitations are skyrmions with pseudospin texture ( i.e. , pseudospin skyrmions or bimerons . ) the phase diagram contains also some regions where the charged excitations involve intertwined spin and pseudospin textures .",
    "these complex objects are called @xmath9 skyrmions@xcite .",
    "spin and pseudospin - skyrmions can be viewed as limiting cases of the more general @xmath19 skyrmion excitation .    in the present paper ,",
    "our main goal is to understand the collective mode spectrum of a crystal of @xmath9 skyrmions . to understand the intricate spectrum of excitations in such a crystal ,",
    "we find it helpful to begin our study by calculations of the collective mode spectra of pure spin or pseudospin skyrmion crystals as well as that of the homogeneous ( or liquid ) state at exactly @xmath0 .    for the liquid state ,",
    "an analysis of the collective excitations was presented in ref . , but the analysis was limited to the behavior at long wavelengths .",
    "we provide here the full dispersion relations , calculated in the generalized random - phase approximation ( grpa ) , of the three goldstone modes identified in ref . .",
    "in addition to pseudospin - wave and spin - wave modes , the @xmath9 liquid state also supports a gapless mode involving a spin _ and _ a pseudospin flip .    the collective mode spectrum of a pure spin - skyrmion crystal was first calculated in ref .. in this work we present and discuss both two - component cases :  the spin and pseudospin crystals , and discuss the similarities and differences .",
    "the spin - skyrmion has two goldstone modes at finite zeeman coupling .",
    "one is the phonon mode which is due to the broken translational symmetry , while the second mode is a @xmath20 phase mode arising from a broken orientational symmetry in the spin texture .",
    "indeed , the energy of an isolated spin - skyrmion is invariant with respect to a global change in the azimuthal angle of the spins . in a crystal ,",
    "this angle is fixed and this symmetry is broken .",
    "it is believed@xcite that this mode is responsible for the small nmr relaxation time @xmath21 observed experimentally@xcite around @xmath0 at low temperature .",
    "a particularly interesting situation arises if one considers the limit of vanishing zeeman coupling @xmath22 : each skyrmion breaks up into two merons ( a meron is a vortex - like configuration which can be understood as half a skyrmion ) , and the resulting meron crystal has @xmath23",
    "goldstone modes in addition to the phonon mode which are similar in nature to the @xmath6 phase mode of the spin - skyrmion crystal .    for the analogous bilayer situation , where the two layers in which the electrons may reside play the role of the two allowed spin states , we find that only the phonon mode remains gapless in the pseudospin - skyrmion crystal when the tunneling and layer separation are both non - vanishing .",
    "the absence of a gapless mode analogous to the @xmath8 mode of the spin - skyrmion crystal occurs because the inter - layer interaction is different than the intra - layer interaction , breaking the @xmath8 symmetry . for @xmath24 , the state deforms into a pseudospin meron crystal , which has two ( rather than four ) gapless modes because of the explicit symmetry - breaking in the interaction .",
    "these modes may be identified as a phonon , and a goldstone mode due to the spontaneous interlayer coherence in the limit of zero tunneling and the broken orientational symmetry in the in - plane pseudospin texture .    for the @xmath9 skyrmion crystal ,",
    "we show that , when all symmetry breaking fields @xmath2 , @xmath25 and @xmath4 are finite , the crystal has , in addition to the phonon mode , one gapless phase @xmath26 mode arising from the invariance of the hamiltonian with respect to a rotation of _ all _ the spins in the two layers by the same angle .",
    "we find also that since the @xmath9 skyrmion crystal occurs only at very small value of the tunneling parameter , a second phase mode with a very small gap is present in the spectrum .",
    "our @xmath9 skyrmion crystal is characterized by a set of eight low - energy modes that offer a distinct signature of this entangled spin and pseudospin state , much different from that of a pure spin or pseudospin skyrmion crystal .",
    "our paper is organized in the following way .",

    "we define this bias as @xmath28 where @xmath29 are the electric subband energies in each well ( right and left ) in the absence of magnetic field and tunneling . for simplicity",
    ", we make a narrow well approximation , i.e. we assume that the width @xmath30 of the wells is small ( @xmath31 ) and treat interlayer hopping in a tight - binding approximation .",

    "in addition to this gapless mode , we found a second mode with a very small gap .",
    "we believe that this mode can be associated with the variation of the relative azimuthal angles @xmath427 or with the variation of the azimuthal angle @xmath416 of the total pseudospin vector or to a combination of these angles .    having established the low - energy excitations of the @xmath9 skyrmion crystal and obtained the corresponding response functions , it is now possible to compute the @xmath428 relaxation time @xmath21 and see how it compares with the measured experimental values@xcite in order to see if the formation of a @xmath9 crystal plays a role in these experiments .",
