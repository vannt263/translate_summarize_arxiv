    "with wilson fermions , straightforward calculations of @xmath0 using the 1-loop improved @xmath2 operator fail due to the large mixing with the wrong chirality operators  @xcite .",
    "since this mixing is an artifact of lattice discretization , one hopes that it can be significantly reduced by improving the action . by comparing results obtained using the wilson and the tadpole improved clover action ( @xmath3 ) on the same quenched gauge lattices ( 170 lattices of size @xmath4 at @xmath5 )",
    "we show that this is indeed the case .",
    "[ f : bkw ] shows the wilson and clover data as a function of @xmath6 . for each data",
    "set , @xmath0 is written as the sum of two parts @xmath7 the contribution of the diagonal ( the 1-loop tadpole improved @xmath8 ) operator , and the mixing term which is proportional to @xmath9 .",
    "the general form , ignoring chiral logarithms and terms proportional to @xmath10 , for @xmath11 is  @xcite @xmath12 the coefficients @xmath13 are pure artifacts , therefore their value can be used to quantify improvement . of these @xmath14",
    "is the most serious as it causes @xmath0 to diverge in the chiral limit .",
    "the divergence , in the limit @xmath15 , of the diagonal term due to a non - zero @xmath14 is evident in fig .",
    "[ f : bkw ] for wilson fermions .",
    "this artifact is only partially cancelled by the 1-loop mixing operator .",
    "the situation is considerably improved with clover fermions .",
    "the corresponding values at @xmath16 mev are @xmath17 whereas @xmath18 .",
    "this improvement arises because the two dominant artifacts @xmath19 and @xmath20 are significantly reduced ; @xmath21 versus @xmath22 , and @xmath23 versus @xmath24 .    -0.8 cm",
    "-0.6 cm [ f : bkw ]    as explained in  @xcite , the contributions proportional to @xmath13 can be removed completely by studying the momentum dependence of the matrix elements .",
    "short of calculating the mixing coefficients non - perturbatively , the way to remove the artifacts in @xmath25 is to extrapolate to @xmath26 .",
    "we have done the calculation at @xmath27 only , where our final results are @xmath28 and @xmath29 for wilson and clover formulations respectively .",
    "the benchmark value , including @xmath30 extrapolation , is @xmath31 , as obtained by the jlqcd collaboration  @xcite .",
    "the chiral condensate @xmath32 is not simply related to the trace of the wilson quark propagator @xmath33 .",
    "the breaking of chiral symmetry by the @xmath34 term introduces contact terms that need to be subtracted non - perturbatively from @xmath33  @xcite .",
    "this has not proven practical . instead , the methods of choice are to either evaluate the right hand side of the continuum ward identity @xmath35 or cast the gell - mann , oakes , renner relation @xmath36 in terms of lattice correlation functions  @xcite .",
    "these estimates have errors of both @xmath37 and @xmath38 , and at fixed @xmath39 are therefore expected to agree only in the chiral limit .",
    "a comparison of the efficacy of the two methods is shown in fig .",
    "[ f : xbarx ] .",
    "we find that a reliable extrapolation to the chiral limit can be made using a linear fit , and the two methods give consistent results for both wilson and clover fermions . also , the @xmath38 corrections are significantly smaller for clover fermion .",

    "in ref .  @xcite we presented a detailed analysis of mass - splittings in the baryon octet and decuplet with wilson fermions . we had found a large non - linear dependence on quark mass for the @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 splittings .",
    "extrapolation of the data to the physical masses including these non - linearities gave estimates consistent with observed values . on the other hand we had found a surprisingly good linear fit to the decuplet masses , and the splittings were underestimated by @xmath43 .",
    "the data with clover fermions show the same qualitative features . as an illustration",
    ", we show a comparison of the @xmath44 splitting in fig .",

    "the improvement coefficient for the axial current , @xmath1 , is calculated using the the axial wi  @xcite . if the clover coefficient @xmath45 is tuned to its non - perturbative value @xmath46 at @xmath27  @xcite , the sum @xmath47 of quark masses defined by @xmath48^{(12)}(\\vec{x},t ) j^{(21)}(0 ) \\rangle }   { \\sum_{\\vec{x } } \\langle p^{(12)}(\\vec{x},t )",

    "the explicit breaking of chiral symmetry in wilson - like fermions gives rise to the problem of `` exceptional configurations '' in the quenched theory .",
    "the cause is that the wilson @xmath34 term breaks the anti - hermitian property of the massless dirac operator . as a result ,",
    "zero modes of the dirac operator extend into the physical region @xmath57 .",
    "thus , on a given configuration , as the quark mass is lowered and approaches the first of the unphysical modes , one encounters exceptionally large fluctuations in the correlation functions .",
    "such configurations dominate the ensemble average and as discussed in  @xcite there is no basis for excluding them .",
    "tuning @xmath58 reduces the @xmath37 chiral symmetry breaking artifacts as shown above , however , it does not reduce this problem  @xcite .",
    "we find , by comparing fluctuations in 2-point and 3-point correlation functions between wilson and clover fermions , that the problem , in fact , gets worse . a deeper understanding of the persistence of the zero mode problem even though the chiral behavior is improved is missing .",
