    "lisa ( laser interferometer space antenna ) is a ten years long nasa - esa space mission to detect gravitational waves in the frequency range @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "it consists of three spacecrafts whose mutual distances are about  @xmath8 .",
    "the lisa constellation will orbit around the sun following the same path of the earth , @xmath9 behind @xcite .",
    "the ideal configuration for lisa performances should be a rigid equilater triangle @xcite ; however , the shape of the lisa constellation is subject to significant variations because of the gravitational interaction due to sun and planets @xcite .",
    "much smaller perturbations can be induced by the presence of interplanetary dust @xcite or dark matter in the solar system @xcite .",
    "the perturbations due to each celestial body can be treated , at a first approximation , independently .",
    "the gravitational effects are quite different in intensity ( orders of magnitude ) and/or in behavior ( stationary or time - dependent ) ; the frequencies involved are , in general , not commensurable and so resonance effects are not observed .",
    "the only significative exception is the earth perturbation @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , which gives a resonance because of the 1:1 commensurability between the earth and lisa orbits .",
    "however , such a resonance will not have enough time to grow during the 10 years of lisa mission . in this paper",
    "we focus on the perturbations induced by the em system on lisa at the frequency of the synodic month and its harmonics , which are much higher than @xmath10 and so , in a first order approximation , perturbative effects can be treated independently .",
    "we extend the approach of @xcite to include the time dependent perturbation of the moon .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in",
    "we shortly describe the perturbative approach used to study the em effects .",
    "is devoted to illustrate the em system and the approximations we used to model its gravitational near field . in",
    "we calculate the modulations of the distance between two lisa test masses due to em system . in",
    "we estimate the perturbations induced by venus and jupiter , compared to those due to the em system calculated in the previous sections . in conclusions",
    "are drawn and the future research potential of method for further studies and application to lisa are given .",
    "in order to simplify the notation , we use the astronomical system of units , for length ( au ) , mass ( m@xmath11 ) and time ( days ) .",
    "however , the quantities that affect the relative motion of the lisa spacecrafts will be reconverted in the si units .    by means of a f77 code based on the inverse 15@xmath2-order runge - kutta method @xcite",
    ", we calculate the modulus of the force gradient between 2 lisa spacecrafts due to the main solar system bodies , i.e. sun , venus , earth ( more precisely the em system ) and jupiter ( ) .",
    "the effects are different by orders of magnitude in amplitude and show also different frequencies .    in fact ,",
    "the earth and jupiter tidal effects are @xmath12 and @xmath13 times smaller than the sun contribution , respectively ; after 3 years , sun , earth and jupiter cause arms length changes ( the so - called  arm breathing  ) of @xmath14 , 4.8@xmath15 and 4@xmath16 , respectively @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the venus contribution oscillates in time by two orders of magnitude and it is comparable with earth effects for a short time interval every 584@xmath17 @xcite .",
    "however , as we will show in , this perturbation is negligible with respect to the earth one .",
    "we therefore conclude that the celestial bodies affect the lisa arms length by at most a few percent . as a consequence , at any time the distance of each satellite from the lisa barycenter is @xmath18 , and the distance between the earth and the lisa barycenter is @xmath19 , within a relative fluctuation of few percent .      to study the em system effect , we made use of the hill - clohessy - wiltshire ( hcw ) reference frame @xmath20  @xcite defined as follows ( see ):    1 .",
    "the origin @xmath21 describes a circular orbit on the ecliptic plane at @xmath22 from the solar system barycenter @xmath23 @xcite ; 2 .",
    "the @xmath24 plane coincides with the ecliptic ; 3 .",
    "the @xmath25-axis is perpendicular to the ecliptic plane and parallel to the solar system total angular momentum ; 4 .",
    "the @xmath26-axis is tangent to the orbit and is antiparallel to the origin @xmath21 velocity vector ; 5 .",
    "the @xmath27-axis is directed radially outward .        in this frame",
    "the coordinates of the em system barycenter are @xmath28 . of course",
    ", the lisa spacecrafts can be considered as three proof masses .",
    "their equations of motion in the hcw frame read    @xmath29    where @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 .",
    "being the breathing length @xmath34 , each satellite is located at any time at a distance @xmath35 . since @xmath36 , we expand the acceleration due to the sun in terms of @xmath37 . retaining the first term of the series",
    ", we have the so - called hill - clohessy - wiltshire equations @xcite of relative motion    @xmath38    with general solutions @xcite , @xcite    @xmath39    where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the initial positions and velocities respectively .",
    "since @xmath42 contains a term proportional to @xmath43 , after some time the assumption @xmath44 is no more valid and the above approximation breaks down .",

    "we will show that the higher order terms in the expansions are negligible for calculating the perturbation of the lisa rigid and bounded orbits .",

    ", the order of magnitude of the neglected terms is @xmath54 .",
    "in our model , the em system is constituted by 2 point masses : @xmath55 ( earth ) and @xmath56 ( moon ) located at a constant distance @xmath57 and describing a circular orbit with angular velocity @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the synodic month , around their common barycenter .",
    "we assume that the barycenter of the em system makes a circular orbit with radius @xmath60 around the sun , i.e. we neglect the eccentricity @xmath61 of the earth orbit around the sun .",
    "in addition , we disregard the eccentricity of the moon orbit around the earth ( @xmath62 ) , its inclination to the ecliptic plane ( @xmath63 ) , the motion of the perigee of the moon ( @xmath64 ) and the precession of the moon orbit plane ( @xmath65 ) @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we consider a non rotating reference frame @xmath66 centered on the em system barycenter , with the @xmath67 axis along the line joining earth and moon at @xmath68 , and the @xmath69 axis perpendicular to the ecliptic plane ( see ) .",

    "the size @xmath73 of the em system is small relatively to @xmath72 , @xmath74 .",
    "we therefore expand the total potential in series of @xmath75 .    @xmath76    where @xmath77 are the well known multipole terms .",

    "let us estimate the intensity of the acceleration due to the em system : the most important contribution is given by the monopole term ( @xmath103 ) , and we assume its value at the origin of the coordinates as an indicator of its intensity .",
    "this term is    @xmath104 therefore the em system influence is about the 7% of the contribution of the sun ( ) .    at the first order in the coordinates the monopole term ( normalized to @xmath105 ) is    @xmath106    where @xmath107 are the scaled coordinates .",
    "the most important multipole term is the quadrupole ( @xmath108 ) which is mostly constituted by the zeroth order term of its expansion in spatial coordinates , or equivalently , the force at the origin .",
    "this term is periodic with period @xmath109 , and its mean value is    @xmath110    the monopole force has an identical time - independent polynomial structure as the expansion in coordinates of the sun force .",
    "the difference is that this latter starts with second order terms @xcite , while the em monopole presents also linear terms and a constant term . moreover ,",
    "the monopole force is quite smaller than the sun force .    the multipole force with _ even _ @xmath53 also contains time - independent terms but the largest ones ( corresponding to @xmath108 ) have order of magnitude @xmath111 .",
    "we can separate the total force in a more useful way :    1 .   a component @xmath112 independent of time due to the terms of the sun force ( @xmath113 ) @xcite , plus the em system monopole ( @xmath114 , with @xmath103 ) plus terms contained in the @xmath53-even multipole expansion ( @xmath115 , with @xmath116 ) ; 2 .   a component @xmath117 that depends _ only _ on time due to the em system multipole terms ( @xmath115 , with @xmath118 and @xmath119 ) .",
    "physically this is the force at the origin of the hcw system ; 3 .",
    "a component @xmath120 that depends on both time and coordinates ( all other cases : with @xmath119 and @xmath121 ) .",
    "if we indicate with @xmath122 the unperturbed trajectory of the @xmath123 lisa test mass ( @xmath124 ) and with @xmath125 its small perturbation , the difference between two perturbed trajectories is simply @xmath126    where @xmath127 , @xmath128 .",
    "the perturbation of the relative displacement between the pair @xmath129 of lisa test masses can be written as @xmath130    where @xmath131 is the distance between @xmath132 and @xmath133 test masses in the unperturbed case , and @xmath134 .",
    "we also define the perturbation to the differential distances between each pair of lisa as @xmath135    which represents the variation of @xmath136 due to a small perturbation and relates directly to the lisa sensitivity curve .      at the first order , under the effect of the sun ,",
    "the lisa motion is described by and the em monopole perturbation is contained in the time - independent force per unit mass @xmath137 .",
    "we write the motion of the @xmath138-spacecraft under the effect of @xmath137 in the following form : @xmath139 , where @xmath140 is the unperturbed motion ( , rescaled ) , and @xmath141 and @xmath142 are the perturbations due to the sun force terms @xcite and the em monopole , respectively .",
    "being @xmath143 , to calculate @xmath142 it is not necessary to know @xmath141 , @xcite .",
    "the equations for @xmath144 are @xcite , @xcite and @xcite    @xmath145    where ( @xmath146 ) are evaluated along the trajectory @xmath140 , using .",
    "the solution can be written as    @xmath147    where @xmath148 are constants that depend on the initial conditions and on the geometric parameters ( @xmath149 ) .",
    "the solution contains terms @xmath150 and @xmath151 , moreover there are also _ mixed perturbations _ as @xmath152 , i.e. perturbations increases with time .    in particular , the coefficient of @xmath153",
    ", @xmath154 is positive number and the same for all spacecrafts .",
    "this means that the _ entire _ constellation is  pushed away  by the em system ( @xmath72 increases with time ) .",
    "the variation of the lisa arms length can be calculated using , and and the result is represented in ( right panel ) .",
    "the indefinite increasing of the perturbation is not physical because the perturbative regime would not be valid anymore , after few years .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the force linearization : the terms proportional to @xmath152 and @xmath155 are first - order terms of the real , _ bounded _ , solution for small @xmath156 . using the f77 code @xcite",
    ", we found that the perturbative pulls lead to a complete dismembering of the constellation and a successive recombination will occur after several tens of thousand year . in this scenario ,",
    "the distance of each spacecraft from the hcw frame origin ranges from zero to @xmath157 .",
    "such motion is not a solution of the hcw equations , which are valid only if @xmath44 .",
    "an all - time valid solution to our perturbative problem can be obtained applying the lindstedt - poincar method @xcite . however , as we are interested in the lisa motion during a few complete orbits , the lindstedt - poincar method is not necessary .",
    "the increase of @xmath72 is shown in ( left panel ) , where its time evolution is represented , during the hypothetical first 10 years of the mission .",
    "the perturbation @xmath158 to the relative motion between the pair @xmath129 of lisa test masses due to the monopole perturbation , calculated both analytically ( dashed line ) and via numerical integration @xcite ( solid line ) , is plotted on the right panel of .",
    "it is worth noticing the good agreement during the 10 years of the lisa mission .",
    "we now search for a perturbative solution to the hcw1 equations in presence of @xmath159 multipole terms .",
    "the intensity of this force is of the order of @xmath160 .",
    "we have already shown that the multipole force is composed by a periodic and a polynomial component independent of time .",
    "the polynomial component is not important , as it can be added to the em system monopole expansion and solved .",
    "the solution has the same structure as , with different coefficients ( rescaled of a factor @xmath161 ) , and the motion described in the previous section is therefore a very good approximation of the em system polynomial component influence .      at the zeroth order ( @xmath118 ) the multipole force does not depend on the coordinates .",
    "therefore , for each order @xmath53 we have periodic terms in @xmath164 .",
    "these terms represent the  pure  oscillations of a test mass due to the em system that are not involved with @xmath165 harmonics .",
    "the solutions relative to these frequencies are equal for each test mass , being independent of its position ( we can interpret this as a common motion ) .",
    "since we are interested in the relative motion of the lisa satellites , we know _ a priori _ that these terms are subtracted when one measures the distance between two satellites .",
    "the equations to be solved are    @xmath166\\cr   \\hat y '' + 2 \\hat x ' -3 \\hat y   = \\sum_n \\left [ a_{yn } \\sin n \\hat \\omega_m \\hat t + b_{yn } \\cos n \\hat \\omega_m \\hat t\\ , \\right]\\cr   \\hat z '' + \\hat z               = \\sum_n \\left [ a_{zn } \\sin",

    "being @xmath168 for each @xmath53 , particular solutions can be written as    @xmath169    and the corresponding coefficients are    @xmath170    inserting the numerical values , it comes out that the most important contribution is due to the @xmath171 frequency and it corresponds to an amplitude of about @xmath172 for @xmath173 coordinates , while the coefficients @xmath174 are all equal to zero .    in",
    "we report the coefficients @xmath175 of the fluctuations in meters ( i.e. multiplied by @xmath176 ) , relatively to the first six harmonics of the fundamental frequency @xmath177 .      in we showed that the @xmath180 term corresponds to the particular solutions of and that @xmath180 does not affect @xmath158 being independent of coordinates .    the motion associated with the coordinate ",
    "dependent term @xmath181 , will be different between each pair of test masses , and so the relative displacements @xmath158 will be different from zero .",
    "the most direct approach to solve the equation of motion is to write hcw1 equations with @xmath181 evaluated along the unperturbed trajectories given by .",
    "thus , we have obtained only the amplitudes relative to frequencies @xmath182 , which represent the main effect of @xmath181 . in order to have the complete spectrum @xmath183 we should consider the solutions of hcw with the complete expansion of the sun force per unit mass ( ) .",
    "the solution can be written as sum of sinusoidal terms with frequencies @xmath184 .",
    "in addition , using , a similar relation can be written also for the perturbation @xmath158 that in si units reads    @xmath185\\ , \\ ] ]    where @xmath186 , with @xmath187 and @xmath188 .",
    "the quantity @xmath189 , which can be directly compared with the lisa sensitivity curve , reads    @xmath190\\ , \\ ] ]    where @xmath191 and @xmath192 .",
    "the coefficients of and are reported in and , respectively , relatively to a certain number of frequencies .    in",
    "we plot the @xmath193 amplitudes ( filled circles ) superimposed to two lisa sensitivity curves ( straight lines ) corresponding to integration times of 12 days ( the upper one ) , period below which there should not be disturbances or if present should be removable and 1 year ( the lower one ) , respectively .",
    "the straight lines were obtained by extrapolating the lisa sensitivity curve down to @xmath6 , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "each amplitude is subject to time variations , because i ) the earth and the moon orbits are not circular ; ii ) the orbital plane of the moon is slightly inclined ; and iii ) the lisa constellation is not rigid .",
    "we estimated uncertainties for @xmath194 and @xmath195 by taking into account all these effects ; in particular , we assumed the error relative to @xmath195 equal to the amplitude of the sun induced breathing , i.e. @xmath196% of @xmath195 @xcite .",
    "the resulting relative uncertainties of the @xmath189 amplitudes are @xmath197% .",
    "to make a comparison with the effect on the lisa motion due to em system effect , we have numerically evaluated the effect of venus , jupiter and the em system ( its monopole contribution ) using a f77 code implementing the algorithm described in @xcite . in practice , we independently computed the lisa motion under the effect of sun+venus , sun+jupiter and sun+em system and we subtracted , to each of them , the unperturbed motion due to the sun .",
    "in we plot the @xmath193 perturbations ( in km ) once the modulation due to the sun has been subtracted .",
    "we have found that the monopole contribution of the em system ( solid line ) is much larger than that of venus ( dotted line ) and jupiter ( dashed line ) .",
    "also shows the onset of the resonant effect of the em system monopole after 2 - 3 years .",
    "we calculated the relative motion of lisa test masses due to the effect of the em system monopole and we found @xmath198 after a period of 10 years .",
    "we also found that the jupiter and venus influences are at least 10 times smaller than the em system one .",
    "the perturbations of the differential relative motion of lisa test masses @xmath189 are in the @xmath199 to @xmath200 decade .",
    "this is a very low frequency range in which lisa residual acceleration noise may be much larger than extrapolated on grounds of known effects in @xcite .",
    "however , it might not be completely hopeless to get an interesting sensitivity also at such low frequencies , provided that one will have to face the problem of i ) loss of signal coherence over a time scale of one month ; and ii ) low frequency range calibration .    as discussed in pollack @xcite it is possible to extract a signal from the lisa data , even in presence of disturbances .",
    "these latter arise due to environmental effects , such as cosmic rays induced by solar flares , and the telecommunication antenna which periodically has to be rotated .",
    "pollack showed how these disturbances can be identified and subsequently removed from the data even at low frequencies .",
    "assuming , for instance , that a disturbance appears every 19 days ( see table 6 in @xcite ) the resulting error in the signal frequency of @xmath201 is only @xmath202 .",
    "thus it should not be a problem to extend to such low frequencies the calibration from the verification binaries , and , by using their signals , ensure the continuity of data over time spans of many weeks .",
    "still the signal from the em system , as understood at the level of accuracy given in the present paper , can give a relevant additional crosscheck to such an extension of the calibration .",
    "it thus may help in improving our knowledge of the lisa acceleration noise at very low frequencies and contribute to extend to such low frequencies the capabilities of lisa .",
