    "another possible explanation for the second step - like feature could be heat release during the dynamic switching process in the bulk crystals , which could alter the shape of m(h ) .",
    "we do note that the magnetic and transport measurements are reproducible after the samples remain at low temperatures for long periods of time , and after performing multiple field sweeps at different sweep rates .",

    "qualitatively , this mr field - dependence resembles that for fe@xmath7tas@xmath4.@xcite however , the absolute @xmath37 values are remarkably high in fe@xmath0tas@xmath4 ( full symbols , fig .",

    "furthermore , both @xmath37 and @xmath36 decreased with increasing temperature , and the bow - tie shape of the @xmath37 curves disappears above @xmath17 when @xmath49 becomes nearly linear for the whole measured field range .",
    "it should be noted that @xmath48 is much smaller in bulk ( @xmath14 0.04 t ) than in the exfoliated sample ( @xmath14 0.8 t ) at lower temperatures , and becomes comparable ( @xmath14 0.3 t ) in both as the temperature exceeds 10 k. the broadening of the transition with increasing t in the bulk seems natural , while the opposite effect ( sharpening ) in the exfoliated sample emphasizes the role of the long range interplanar coupling in fe@xmath0tas@xmath4 .",
    "this may imply that long range coupling exists between the fe ions in different layers , which is weakened in the exfoliated sample , even when 100 nm thick .",
    "the observed magnitude of the mr in fe@xmath0tas@xmath1 , comparable to that seen in gmr and tmr systems , is remarkably large for a homogeneous bulk material not going through a phase transition ( as in cmr systems ) .",

    "as previously observed in fe@xmath7tas@xmath4 and fe@xmath0tas@xmath4,@xcite the hall resistance @xmath38 for both bulk and exfoliated samples displays hysteresis below @xmath51 , with jumps at @xmath52 ( fig .",

    "when @xmath46 exceeds @xmath52 , the hall resistivity @xmath38 becomes almost linear in field , a result of the ordinary hall effect contribution . for temperatures above @xmath51 , only the ordinary hall effect is observed , as @xmath53 is again nearly linear in @xmath46 . note that the hall coefficient @xmath54 in fe@xmath0tas@xmath4 does not change sign throughout the ordered state , in contrast to the situation in fe@xmath7tas@xmath4.@xcite converting into the hall conductivity , the change in @xmath55 when passing through @xmath56 at 4  k is close to 200  s / cm , essentially the same as that seen in the @xmath57 compound,@xcite and exceeding the values typically seen in ( ga , mn)as by a factor of five@xcite .",
    "these results imply that the spin - orbit coupling is very strong in this material and is very similar in the @xmath58 and @xmath57 compositions .",
    "we must consider candidate mechanisms to explain the magnetotransport properties of the fe@xmath0tas@xmath4 single crystals , in particular the remarkably large h @xmath16 @xmath35 mr .",

    "generally the difference between the two @xmath63 is positive .",
    "the prior work@xcite on the @xmath57 compound ascribed the small ( a maximum @xmath64 at 1.5  k ) mr for h @xmath16 c to a @xmath65 of + 260@xmath66-cm and a splaying of the spins as @xmath67 by about 0.1@xmath68 .",
    "the large value of @xmath65 is consistent in that case with in - plane mr measurements out to very high fields , showing @xmath69 for h @xmath70 c and @xmath71  t , corresponding to a tilting of @xmath72 away from the @xmath35 axis by around 15@xmath68.@xcite note that in these @xmath57 in - plane measurements at 10  k , an in - plane field of several tesla is able to ca nt @xmath72 suffficiently to produce a measured amr of several percent .        in our @xmath73 compound , it is not unreasonable to assume a similar magnitude of @xmath65 , given the similarity of the spin - orbit coupling ( inferred from the anomalous hall conductivities ) and the switching fields .",
    "our observed magnitude of @xmath74 for @xmath75 would then imply a canting or splaying of the spins by tens of degrees immediately prior to magnetization reversal ( @xmath76 ) .",

    ", one would expect significant canting of the magnetization when @xmath24 if such reorientation of @xmath60 could happen with @xmath46 antialigned to @xmath60 along @xmath35 .",
    "instead , there is almost no detectable magnetoresistive or anomalous hall response for @xmath80 @xmath81 , and the magnetization response along that field direction ( open symbols , fig .",
    "[ magnetization_at_temperatures ] ) is correspondingly weak .",
    "this is in contrast to the @xmath57 case described above .",
    "these observations suggest that the easy axis of magnetization is strongly aligned with the @xmath35-axis , given that an in - plane field of 8 t is insufficient to produce any detectable mr or hall signal .",
    "thus ordinary amr seems incompatible with the full ensemble of data , and amr in the @xmath58 case appears to be quite different than at @xmath57 .",

    "the superstructure unit cell ( small hexagonal cell ) appears rotated by 90@xmath82 from the main structure unit cell ( large hexagonal cell ) . ]",
    "giant magnetoresistance ( gmr)@xcite is another mechanism capable of producing magnetoresistive effects of tens of percent .",
    "gmr results from the interplay between spin - split band structure and the density of states available for each spin species for scattering at the fermi level .",
    "a magnetically inhomogeneous material can exhibit gmr due to current flow between differently aligned magnetic domains.@xcite to be a plausible explanation of our data would require that the magnetic domain structure of the material evolve as @xmath67 so that charge transport is forced to take place across an increasingly large number of boundaries between antialigned domains .",
    "this can be tested through magneto - optic studies of the domain structure ( beyond the scope of the present work ) . however , the micro - scale exfoliated samples have transport properties that look very similar to those of the bulk crystals , including a lack of any step - like features in the mr or anomalous hall data as a function of field .",
    "this suggests that the flipping of discrete domains near @xmath56 and resultant gmr are unlikely to be responsible for the observed large mr .",
    "note further that the domains observed via magneto - optic methods in the @xmath57 composition@xcite are typically tens of @xmath13 m in extent . in the current x = 0.28",
    "exfoliated samples the few-@xmath13 m spacing of the voltage probes combined with the lack of any discrete magnetoresistive or ahe signatures in these devices implies that any domains would have to be much smaller than the @xmath13 m scale - very different than the @xmath57 case , and difficult to image .",
    "conversely , the similarity in the @xmath22 data between this study and previous measurements on fe@xmath7tas@xmath4 suggests that the domain structures are likely very similar .",
    "therefore , domain wall scattering is unlikely the cause of the large observed mr .",
    "we suggest that the mechanism for the extremely large @xmath25 mr and the near - absence of mr when @xmath24 is spin disorder scattering.@xcite the prominant drop in @xmath32 when @xmath23 falls below @xmath51 is readily apparent in fig .",
    "[ magnetization_and_resistivity ] , showing that spin disorder scattering accounts for approximately 50% of the total scattering relevant to the resistivity above @xmath51 . in the case of large spin - orbit coupling",

    "in the presence of strong soc , such spin disorder can be very effective at scattering carriers relative to ordinary potential disorder , since it mixes spin channels and therefore permits greater phase space for scattering .",
    "when electron diffraction measurements are performed on the fe@xmath0tas@xmath4 single crystals ( fig .",
    "[ saed ] ) , two concentric sets of spots are observed in the @xmath81 plane , each with sixfold symmetry .",
    "the bright spots ( large circles ) are due to the main tas@xmath4 phase , while the faint spots ( small circles ) are assumed to result from an ordered fe superstructure .",
    "when compared to the diffraction patterns presented in a recent study by horibe @xmath83,@xcite the present saed pattern appears more similar to that of fe@xmath84tas@xmath4 than that of fe@xmath85tas@xmath4 , with the interior hexagon rotated by 90 in relation to the outer one and the resulting superstructure close to @xmath86 .",
    "the appearance of the superstructure spots in the electron diffraction ( fig .",
    "[ saed ] ) indicates that it may be useful to think about the @xmath73 system as a compound with a commensurate @xmath87 fe structure with additional fe local moments ( @xmath88 ) , or @xmath89 fe structure with missing fe local moments ( @xmath90 ) with very small @xmath91 ( @xmath92 ) . in either case , the moments in a disordered environment , while coupled ferromagnetically to the bulk , would be expected to have weaker exchange interactions@xcite than those on the superstructure sites , and hence easier to antialign with the field as @xmath93 .",
    "the maximum mr for this field orientation is seen at @xmath56 as the spins reverse their orientation , leading to an increase in scattering comparable to the spin - disorder contribution to @xmath43 . in other words , during the mr measurement , the antialignment of a significant fraction of the local moments as the field strength is increased ( antiparallel to the bulk magnetization ) results in enhanced scattering and increased resistance .",
    "once the remaining spins flip to become aligned with the external field , spin disorder scattering is greatly reduced , causing a sharp drop in resistance .",
    "canting of the moments is disfavored by the large magnetic anisotropy , while enhanced scattering ( relative to potential scattering ) is favored due to strong soc and channel mixing .",
    "additional experiments can be used to test this hypothesis .",
    "this explanation assumes a population of weakly - coupled , easier - to - reorient spins due to deviations from the @xmath87 stoichiometry .",
    "one would therefore expect a monotonic increase in the the @xmath94 @xmath35 mr as @xmath5 is increased from @xmath87 to @xmath73 .",
    "the dynamics of the spin reorientation should also be manifested in the mr response in this case , though no field sweep rate dependence has been observed so far .",
