    "<S> we present high angular resolution pdbi images ( beam of @xmath00.33@xmath1 ) of the @xmath2=27@xmath326 line from several vibrational levels ( @xmath4=1 and @xmath5=1 ) of hc@xmath6n toward cepheus a hw2 . </S>",
    "<S> these images reveal the two main heating sources in the cluster : one centered in the disk collimating the hw2 radio jet ( the hw2 disk ) , and the other associated with a hot core 0.3@xmath1 northeast hw2 ( the hc ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is the first time that vibrationally excited emission of hc@xmath6n is spatially resolved in a disk . </S>",
    "<S> the kinematics of this emission shows that the hw2 disk rotates following a keplerian law . </S>",
    "<S> we derive the temperature profiles in the two objects from the excitation of hc@xmath6n along the hw2 disk and the hc . </S>",
    "<S> these profiles reveal that both objects are centrally heated and show temperature gradients . </S>",
    "<S> the inner and hotter regions have temperatures of 350@xmath730@xmath8k and 270@xmath720@xmath8k for the hw2 disk and the hc , respectively . in the cooler and outer regions , </S>",
    "<S> the temperature drops to 250@xmath730@xmath8k in the hw2 disk , and to 220@xmath715@xmath8k in the hc . </S>",
    "<S> the estimated luminosity of the heating source of the hw2 disk is @xmath02.2@xmath910@xmath10@xmath8l@xmath11 , and @xmath03000@xmath8l@xmath11 for the hc . </S>",
    "<S> the most massive protostar in the hw2 region is the powering source of the hw2 radio jet . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the formation of multiple systems in this cluster . </S>",
    "<S> the proximity of the hc to hw2 suggest that these sources likely form a binary system of b stars , explaining the observed precession of the hw2 radio jet . </S>"
