    "the chemical properties of galaxies hide clues about their formation and evolution .",
    "semi - analytic chemical evolution models ( @xcite ; @xcite ) have succeeded in explaining the mean trends of galactic systems by numerically solving a set of equations governing the simplified evolution of the chemical elements as they cycle through gas and stars .",
    "one strength of these models is that they typically have the fewest number of free parameters , making convergence to a smaller set of solutions more likely .",
    "strong constraints can be placed on chemical evolution models only by contrasting them against a comprehensive set of observed properties .",
    "since the most detailed observational data are generally available for the milky way ( e.g. @xcite ) , successful agreement between model predictions and these observed properties has been obtained by several studies in the past , which help us to understand the formation history of the milky way ( mw ) .",
    "some models have focused on the evolution of the chemical abundances both in the solar neighbourhood and in the whole disc , adopting a framework in which the mw has been built - up inside - out by means of a single accretion event ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "others have used an early infall of gas to explain the thick disc formation , followed by a slower infall to form the thin disc ( e.g. chiappini , matteucci & gratton 1997 ) .",
    "several studies have paid particular attention to the chemical evolution of a larger range of elements ( e.g. timmes , woosley & weaver 1995 ; @xcite ; alibs , labay & canal 2001 ) or focused on the features of the metallicity distribution function ( mdf ) in the solar neighbourhood ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , an implicit assumption remains unanswered : _ is the mw a typical spiral ? _",
    "andromeda ( m31 ) is the closest spiral to our mw ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "previous theoretical studies of the chemical evolution of m31 have been done by @xcite and moll , ferrini & diaz ( 1996 ) , both emphasising the evolution of the m31 disc .",
    "they concluded that m31 has a formation history and chemical evolution similar to that of the mw .",
    "more recently , however , there has been considerable observational progress in the study of both galaxies .",
    "a striking difference between m31 and the mw is that the metallicity of the m31 halo ( @xmath2[fe / h]@xmath3)@xmath4 . ]",
    "is significantly higher than its mw analogue ( @xmath2[fe / h]@xmath5 , e.g. @xcite ) , as revealed by many recent studies ( e.g. holland , fahlman & richer 1996 ; durrell , harris , & pritchet 2001 ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "it is therefore timely to attempt the construction of a chemical evolution model for both the mw and m31 , using the same framework . such an attempt may be helpful in highlighting the common features in the chemical evolution of spiral galaxies ( at least in these two spirals ) and those which remain galaxy - dependent .    in section  2",
    "we describe our multi - zone chemical evolution model , and in section  3 we present the results of our mw model . in section  4",
    "we show the results for m31 .",
    "finally , our results are discussed in section  5 .",
    "in this study we use a semi - analytic multi - zone chemical evolution model for a spiral galaxy .",
    "this model is based on ` getool ` ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we follow the chemical evolution of the halo and disc of m31 and the mw under the assumption that both galaxies are formed from two phases of gas infall .",
    "the first infall episode corresponds to the halo build - up , and the second to the inside - out formation of the disc .",
    "similar formalisms have been successful in modeling the chemical evolution of the solar neighbourhood ( e.g. chiappini , matteucci & gratton 1997 ; @xcite ; alib ' es , labay & canal 2001 ) .",
    "we assume that halo stars were born in a burst induced by the collapse of a single proto - galactic cloud ( eggen , lynden - bell & sandage 1962 ) or by the multiple merger of building - blocks ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the disc is assumed to be built - up inside - out by the smooth accretion of gas on a longer timescale .",
    "observations of hi high velocity clouds ( hvcs ) that appear to be currently falling onto the mw ( e.g. @xcite and references therein ) may provide evidence for such gas infall .",
    "recently , hvcs have also been detected in the m31 neighbourhood , though their interpretation as infalling clouds is debated @xcite .",
    "we monitor the face - on projected properties of the halo and disc components . while this geometrical simplification is suitable for approximating the flat disc , it is less appropriate for the halo , whose shape is roughly spherical rather than disc - like .",
    "however , we consider this choice acceptable in a simplified model of the chemical evolution of a spiral galaxy .",
    "we follow the chemical evolution of several independent rings , @xmath6  kpc wide , out to a galactocentric radius @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the disc scale - length .",
    "we also ignore the bulge component , because we are interested in the relatively outer region ( @xmath9  kpc ) .",
    "each ring is a single zone onto which gas falls , without exchange of matter between the rings .",
    "we trace the chemical evolution of each zone individually . in our model , we assume that the age of the galaxy is @xmath10 . the basic equations ( e.g. @xcite ) , in a zone at a radius @xmath11 , for the evolution of the gas surface density @xmath12 of an element @xmath13 are written as follows : @xmath14 here @xmath15 is the mass fraction for the element @xmath13 ; @xmath16 is the star formation rate ( sfr ) ; @xmath17 is the initial mass function ( imf ) with the mass range @xmath18 - @xmath19 ; @xmath20 is the lifetime of a star with mass @xmath21 ; @xmath22 is the stellar yield of the element from a star of mass @xmath21 , age @xmath20 and metallicity @xmath23 .",
    "the first term describes the depletion of the element @xmath13 which is locked - up in newly formed stars .",
    "the second and the fourth terms show the contribution of mass loss from low and intermediate mass stars .",
    "the third term describes the contribution from type ia sne ( sneia ) .",
    "the contribution from sneia is calculated as suggested in @xcite , where @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 are defined .",
    "the fifth term shows the contribution from type ii sne ( sneii ) .",
    "the sixth and the seventh terms represent the infalling halo and disc gas , respectively .    the kroupa , tout & gilmore ( 1993 ) imf is used here .",
    "we have chosen a lower mass limit of @xmath31  m@xmath32 and imposed an upper mass limit of @xmath33  m@xmath32 in order to avoid the overproduction of oxygen and recover the observed trend of @xmath0o / fe@xmath1 $ ] at low metallicity at the solar neighbourhood in the mw .",
    "such imf upper mass limit is currently loosely constrained by stellar formation and evolution models . yet , these stellar models , and the yields they provide , are one of the most important features in galactic chemical evolution , although questions remain concerning the precise composition of stellar ejecta , due to the uncertain role played by processes including mass loss , rotation , fall - back , and the location of the mass cut , which separates the remnant from the ejected material in sne .",
    "the sneii yields are from @xcite .",
    "we have halved the iron yields shown in @xcite , as suggested by @xcite .",
    "the sneia yields are from @xcite .",
    "the metallicity - dependent yields of @xcite have been used for stars in the range 1 - 8  m@xmath32 .",
    "the lifetimes of stars as a function of mass and metallicity have been taken from @xcite .",

    "the result of the m31b model suggests that a stronger halo sf can produce a metal - rich halo . however , applying the higher sfe is not the only way to induce stronger sf .",
    "this can also be achieved by employing a larger reservoir of infalling halo gas , without increasing the sfe . here",
    "we discuss the m31c model , which assumes a much larger present - day halo surface density and a longer ( 6 gyr ) halo phase ( table  1 ) .",
    "again , to explain the observed hydrogen surface density , m31c uses a shorter disc infall time - scale , and a weaker radial dependence , which also leads to a present - day sfr similar to m31b .",
    "fig .  2 .",
    "shows the predicted radial distributions of oxygen and sulfur abundances which are in agreement with the observational data to roughly the same degree of the other models .",
    "the hydrogen surface density profile of the m31c model is consistent with @xcite in the inner region of the disc , @xmath34 kpc .",
    "however , m31c has a broader peak at a larger radius than m31b .",
    "consequently , the model overestimates the surface density in the outer region , @xmath35 kpc .",
    "again , this result might suggest that additional physical mechanisms operate , to explain the observed low hydrogen surface density at the outer radii .",
    "3 shows that m31c also reproduces the observed radial distributions of the metallicity , similarly to m31b .",
    "the metallicity gradient in m31c is flatter than m31b at the inner radii as a consequence of the weaker radial dependence of the disc infall time - scale ( i.e. a smaller @xmath36 ) . in the halo fields",
    ", m31c also has systematically higher metallicity than m31a and a steeper gradient than m31b .",
    "although the gradient is in better agreement with the observations than m31b ( table  2 ) , m31c has lower mean metallicities than observed , especially at the outer radii . in fig .  4 ,",
    "the predicted mdfs at different radii are displayed .",
    "the mdfs of m31c are also in good agreement with those observed , especially in the disc . on the other hand ,",
    "the halo mdfs show a more pronounced metal - poor tail than in m31b .",
    "thus , the m31c model also leads to acceptable results , although m31b is in better agreement with the observations .",
    "the next section discusses the formation history of m31 implied by the m31b and m31c models .",
    "the results in the previous section have shown that the main trends of the chemical evolution history of both the mw and m31 can be described using the same framework .",
    "we have also found that to explain the observations in more detail , different sets of parameter values for the formation history are required for the mw and m31 , respectively . in this section ,",
    "we discuss how these different parameters values relate to different galaxy formation histories .",
    "the previous sections have shown that the main differences between the mw and m31 include the hydrogen surface density in the disc and , more significantly , the halo metallicity .",
    "the smaller hydrogen surface density in m31 can be explained by a combination of the shorter disc infall time - scale and the higher disc sfe .",
    "the most striking difference is that the mean metallicity observed in the m31 halo is about ten times higher than that observed in the mw halo , though both galaxies have similar mass and morphology . _ which is a `` typical '' halo ?",
    "_ metal - rich halos seem more common than metal - poor ones , as pointed out by @xcite who analysed a sample of about 1000 edge - on disc galaxies within the sdss . @xcite",
    "have also shown that the ngc5128 halo mdf closely resembles that in the m31 halo .",
    "this similarity is perhaps suggestive of a common history in the halo formation of both galaxies , despite their different hubble - type .",
    "a straightforward way to obtain a more metal - rich halo would be by requiring homogeneous pre - enrichment of the infalling halo gas with a metallicity @xmath37 .",
    "however , this metallicity seems too high , if such pre - enrichment occurred homogeneously in the whole universe .",
    "for example , although this value is close to the mean metallicity of damped lyman @xmath38 systems ( dlas ) , many dlas have much lower metallicity ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "if dlas are more evolved systems than the infalling halo gas , their metallicity should be higher than that induced by pre - enrichment . therefore , a pre - enrichment of @xmath37 may not be tenable .",
    "we found that the observed metal - rich halo of m31 could be explained by two scenarios without any pre - enrichment : a ) a higher halo sfe ; b ) a larger reservoir of infalling halo gas with a longer halo phase .",
    "scenario  a ) might be explained in a hierarchical clustering regime , where the halo is formed by accretion of building - blocks .",
    "theory predicts that gas removal by supernova - driven winds should be more effective in lower mass systems , leading to a consequent suppression of the sfr and a low sfe ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , observations based on the sdss also suggest that the sfe decreases with decreasing stellar mass in low mass galaxies with a stellar mass m@xmath39  m@xmath32 @xcite .",
    "therefore , higher sfe in the m31 halo phase would be explained if the building - blocks of the m31 halo are systematically higher mass systems than those of the mw halo ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "this result again supports the notion of diversity in the formation of spiral galaxies which are apparently similar in mass and morphology and belong to the same local group .",
    "admittedly , our model does not adhere to the hierarchical - clustering scenario in a self - consistent manner , however , our chemical evolution models can be interpreted as the `` mean '' sf and chemical evolution history of the stars which end up at each radius .    as an observational consequence of our models",
    ", we found that both scenarios a ) and b ) predict a more massive stellar halo in m31 , respectively about 6 and 9 times more massive than in the mw , whose stellar halo mass is @xmath40  m@xmath32 .",
    "this result suggests that there might be a correlation between the halo metallicity and its stellar mass . using dynamical simulations , bekki ,",
    "harris & harris ( 2003 ) show that the stellar halo comes from the outer part of the progenitor discs when the bulge is formed by a major merger of two spiral galaxies .",
    "based on this , they also predict the correlation of the metallicity of the stellar halos and the mass of the bulges which were formed by major mergers , since larger bulges have the larger progenitors , and progenitor spiral galaxies should follow the observed mass - metallicity relation .",
    "although they do not mention a correlation between the masses of the bulge and halo , it would naturally be expected .",
    "thus , a major merger scenario could explain our conclusion .",
    "future observational surveys will better quantify the correlation between the halo metallicity and its stellar mass ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it is possible to distinguish scenarios  a ) and b ) through observation .",
    "first , due to a longer halo phase , scenario  b ) predicts intermediate - age population in the m31 halo .",
    "this picture could explain the recent evidence of intermediate - age population by deep imaging of the m31 halo @xcite .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the metallicity gradient in the stellar halo is sensitive to the assumed stellar halo density profile especially in scenario  b ) ; a steeper density profile leads to a steeper metallicity gradient .",
    "@xcite suggested that the outer halo of m31 can be modeled by a power law surface brightness profile of @xmath41 , which is much steeper than what we assumed ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "we found that such a steep profile rules out scenario  b ) to reproduce the flat metallicity gradient observed in the m31 halo .",
    "however , it is still difficult to accurately measure the halo surface brightness of m31 ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "thus , more observational estimates of the m31 halo surface brightness profile would be an important test for this scenario .",
    "we also found that the higher halo sfe in scenario  a ) leads to about 0.2  dex higher [ o / fe ] when [ fe / h]@xmath43  -1  dex , due to intense halo sf .",
    "although measuring [ o / fe ] is a hard challenge for the current available instruments , this task could be accomplished by the next - generation large - aperture optical telescope .",
    "the framework we have used can explain the main trends in the chemical properties of both the mw and m31 .",
    "however , recent observations of stellar streams both in the mw ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and m31 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) clearly identify inhomogeneities in the chemical and dynamical history of both galaxies , which could suggest that a significant fraction of the halo stars results from later accretion of satellite galaxies . in the light of these recent observations , it will be important to study both the mw and m31 in more detail by employing a self - consistent chemo - dynamical model ( e.g. @xcite ) to trace their interrelated chemical and dynamical histories .",

    "<S> the chemical evolution history of a galaxy hides clues about how it formed and has been changing through time . </S>",
    "<S> we have studied the chemical evolution history of the milky way ( mw ) and andromeda ( m31 ) to find which are common features in the chemical evolution of disc galaxies as well as which are galaxy - dependent . </S>",
    "<S> we use a semi - analytic multi - zone chemical evolution model . </S>",
    "<S> such models have succeeded in explaining the mean trends of the observed chemical properties in these two local group spiral galaxies with similar mass and morphology . </S>",
    "<S> our results suggest that while the evolution of the mw and m31 shares general similarities , differences in the formation history are required to explain the observations in detail . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we found that the observed higher metallicity in the m31 halo can be explained by either a ) a higher halo star formation efficiency or b ) a larger reservoir of infalling halo gas with a longer halo formation phase . </S>",
    "<S> these two different pictures would lead to a ) a higher @xmath0o / fe@xmath1 $ ] at low metallicities or b ) younger stellar populations in the m31 halo , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> both pictures result in a more massive stellar halo in m31 , which suggests a possible correlation between the halo metallicity and its stellar mass .    </S>",
