    "the detection of gravitational waves ( gw ) is one of the greatest goals of today s relativistic astrophysics . because of the great success of einstein s general relativity ( gr ) in explaining the dynamical evolution of the binary pulsar psr 1913 + 16 ; continuously observed over almost 30 years by taylor and hulse @xcite , most researchers in the field are confident that the very first gw signal to be detected must come from coalescing binary neutron star - neutron star or black hole - neutron star ( ns - ns , bh - ns ) systems . ongoing ligo science runs @xcite for the first time have set firm upper limits on the rate of binary coalescences in our galaxy : at the level of a few events per year .",
    "meanwhile the model - dependent estimate of such a rate at cosmic distance scales varies around @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the expectation is enormous as well for an event like the supernova ( sn ) explosion .     in this paper",
    "we focus on the radiation emitted when a pulsar is kicked out from the supernova remnant and is accelerated with very high speed , albeit non ultrarelativistic .",
    "gravitational radiation is emitted whenever the nascent neutron star or pulsar changes its velocity , a condition that is fulfilled by the large thrust given to the nascent pulsar during the sn explosion , and also due to the pulsar dragging against the sn ejecta .",
    "( recall that the gravitational field generated by a motion with constant velocity is nonradiative ) .",
    "we shall show that each individual event of launching a nascent pulsar to drift or run across the galaxy , after a sn explosion , generates a gravitational wave signal that can be detected by current and planned gw interferometers such ligo i , ligo ii , virgo , geo-600 , or tama-300 .",
    "nonetheless , it is stressed from the very beginning that the strain of the gw signal that we estimate below is _ a lower bound_. the reason is that we are not taking into account the contribution to the gw amplitude , @xmath4 , stemming from the effective acceleration that the pulsar receives at the kick at birth , which could be very large .",
    "indeed , the distance over which the rap is dragged against the supernova ejecta could also be astronomically large .    at first glance",
    ", it appears that the detection of the gw signal from the short rise must have an event rate on the order of that for sn events in our galaxy , i. e. @xmath5 1 per 30 - 300 years . in principle",
    "such a rate has to be the same because the flinging of the pulsar could be just the aftermath of most supernova core collapses .",
    "however , in galactic globular clusters , where the frequency of formation and disruption of binary systems harboring compact stars is relatively high , the kick velocity of a pulsar partner at the binary disruption could be of the same magnitude as the one for galactic raps .",
    "indeed , vlemmings et al .",
    "@xcite are pursuing a vlbi astrometry program to perform measurements of pulsar proper motions and parallaxes with spatial resolution of microarsecond . as an illustration of the performance of the high precision pulsar astrometry system they simulated the detection of the disruption of a binary system in the stellar cluster cygnus superbubble .",
    "this is a quite estimulating perspective for pulsar astrometry in the near future .",
    "therefore , there is a potential to detect such a disruption or formation of a binary system through the gw signal emitted by the abrupt acceleration or sudden increase in velocity of a given pulsar .",
    "observations in the range of micro- or nano - astrometry with planned satellites like gaia and other instruments on earth and space may help to identify such a phenomenon .",
    "an advanced technology useful for this purpose is currently operative or under planning ( see ref.@xcite and references therein ) .    0.5truecm",
    "0.5truecm    the physical reason for advocating in favor of this novel possibility for gw detection is based on a number of results on the dynamics and kinematics of galactic raps and also on gr , as is shown next .    *",
    "\\1 ) in a seminal paper , spruit and phinney @xcite demonstrated that regardless of the actual physical engine driving the natal ( instantaneous ) pulsar kicks , that mechanism can only act upon the pulsar over a very restricted time scale , @xmath6 , on the order of @xmath7  s. this is a fundamental piece of the dynamics of observed pulsars that seems to be overlooked by workers in the field .",
    "* \\2 ) as shown in the next section , pulsar surveys have shown that the largest ( @xmath8 ) , smaller ( @xmath9 ) and average ( @xmath10 ) spatial ( 3-d ) velocity of cataloged pulsars are 5000 km s@xmath2 , 84 km  s@xmath2 , and 450 - 500 km  s@xmath2 , respectively @xcite ( see fig.[psr - veloc - dist ] ) .",
    "that is , @xmath11 changes by more than an order of magnitude . *",
    "\\3 ) observations of nss in binary systems have allowed to estimate their masses with very high accuracy .",
    "the current values of this physical property gather around 1.4 m@xmath12 @xcite . *",
    "\\4 ) according to gr the acceleration of a mass ( @xmath13 ) to a relativistic velocity ( @xmath11 ) ; i. e. energy , should generate a gw pulse , the nature of which has a very distinctive imprint : the so - called gravitational wave memory @xcite , which makes the amplitude of this gw signal ( the gw strain ) not to fade away by the end of the traction phase ( the kick ) , but rather leaves it variable in time as much as an energy source remains active in the source .",
    "run away pulsars ( raps ) are observed to drift along the galaxy with velocities ranging from 90 km s@xmath2 to 4000 km s@xmath2 ( australian telescope national facility ( atnf ) catalog @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "since most stars in our galaxy are observed to drift with average velocities of @xmath14 km  s@xmath2 , it has been suggested that such large velocities should be given to the proto - neutron star at its birth .",
    "the kick velocity imparted to a just - born neutron star during the rise time is a fundamental piece for understanding the physics of the core collapse supernovae , to have an insight on the sources of asymmetries during the gravitational collapse and on the emission of gravitational waves during this process .",
    "there seems to be a consensus that the core collapse asymmetry driving the kick velocity of a neutron star at birth may have origin in a variety of mechanisms @xcite .",
    "although the mechanism responsible for the initial impulses has not been properly identified yet , a very strong constraint on the timescale over which it could act on the nascent neutron star ( ns ) was put forward in ref.@xcite .",
    "whichever this thruster engine might be it can not push the star over a timescale longer than @xmath15  s. combining this with the ns mass , which piles - up around 1.4  m @xmath12 @xcite , and the above average velocity , implies that a huge power should be expended by the thruster during the pulsar early acceleration phase , and hereby a gravitational - wave ( gw ) burst with  memory \" ( understood as a steady time variation of the metric perturbation ) must be released during this time , according to general relativity @xcite .",
    "the present velocity distribution ( see figs.[gw - histogram - atnf ] , [ psr - veloc - dist ] ) is constructed based on the analysis of the proper motion of radio pulsars in our galaxy after estimating their distances .",
    "pulsar distances are estimated by using annual parallax , h@xmath16 absorption , or associations with globular clusters or supernova remnants , and from dispersion measures and galactic electron density models .",
    "this astronomy field has become a vivid research enterprise since the pioneer works of lyne and lorimer ( ll94 ) @xcite . however , the current view on the distribution of kick velocities is far from the original one they found through pulsar surveys fifteen years ago .",
    "ll94 showed that pulsars appear to run around the galaxy ( and its halo ) with mean spatial ( 3-d ) velocities @xmath17 km  s@xmath2 @xcite , but freeway ( `` cannon - ball '' ) pulsars with velocities as high as 5000 km  s@xmath2 and slow - down millisecond pulsars with speeds of 80 km s@xmath2 wander also around the galaxy @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , the situation changed dramatically with the pulsar velocity survey performed by arzoumian , chernoff and cordes ( acc02 ) @xcite , who found that such a speed distribution appeared to be bimodal indicating one distribution mode around 90 km s@xmath2 and another near 500 km s@xmath2 .",
    "however , this dynamic research field has shown , through new studies on pulsar proper motions , that the situation is far from having been settled .",
    "for instance , hobbs et al .",
    "@xcite have recently challenged the acc02 findings , and have shown that their studies lead to assert that there is no evidence of a bimodal distribution .",
    "instead they suggest that mean 3-dim pulsar birth velocity is 400@xmath18 km  s@xmath2 , and that the distribution appears to be maxwellian with 1-dim rms @xmath19 km  s@xmath2 , showing also a continuum distribution from low to high ( present ) run away speeds , being the last ones the tail of the velocity distribution .",
    "hence , looking back on the surveys by ll94 , the study by hobbs et al .",
    "@xcite clearly agrees with the mean velocity of 450 @xmath20 km s@xmath2 found by ll94 @xcite .      in the late times",
    "the number of pulsars has increased considerably @xcite .",
    "although various researchers have kept update catalogues , since then ; in general , these have been neither completed nor very accessible .",
    "the atnf database is an effort among an australian scientific community and some foreing partner institutions .",
    "the purpose is to compile the largest amount of information about pulsars , which is subsequently made available to every researcher all over the world .",
    "the atnf catalogue @xcite registers all published rotation - powered pulsars , including those detected only at high energies .",
    "it also records anomalous x - ray pulsars axps and soft gamma - ray repeaters ( sgrs ) for which coherent pulsations have been detected .",
    "however , it excludes accretion - powered pulsars such as her x-1 and the recently discovered x - ray millisecond pulsars , for instance sax j1808.4 - 3658 @xcite .",
    "the atnf catalogue @xcite can be accessed in a number of different ways .",
    "the simplest one is from a web interface allowing listing of the most commonly used pulsar parameters , together with the uncertainties and information on the references .",
    "several options for _ tabular output",
    "_ format are provided .",
    "currently , a total of 67 `` _ predefined parameters _ '' are available .",
    "a tool is provided for plotting of parameter distributions , either as two - dimensional plots or as histograms .",
    "zoom tools and interactive identification of plotted points are provided .",
    "custom parameters can be defined by combining parameters in expressions using mathematical operators and functions and these can be either listed or plotted .",
    "finally , the sample of pulsars listed or plotted can be limited by logical conditions on parameters ( see table-[212-atnf - psrs ] ) , pulsar name ( including wild - card names ) or distance from a nominated position .",
    "these operational tools are described in more detail below and links are provided within the web interface to relevant documentation @xcite .    in this particular case",
    ", we select from atnf , by clicking on the box to the left of the `` parameter label '' to select a couple of pulsar parameters : dist and vtrans ( see fig.[psr - veloc - dist ] ) . the first parameter is the best estimate of the pulsar distance in kpc .",
    "the second parameter is the transverse velocity , given in km s@xmath2 , based on dist estimates . by default",
    "the results will be sorted according to the pulsars j2000 names in ascending alphabetical order .",
    "however , sorting is possible on any parameter by typing the parameter label in the `` _ sort on field text box _ '' and selecting whether the sort should be in ascending ( default ) or descending order .",
    "however , to obtain as much information as possible some careful procedures must be followed .",
    "because of this , we selected the listing fashion `` _ short format without errors _ '' .",
    "the short format is used to provide a condensed summary of the pulsars parameters ( see table-[periodos ] ) . finally , we selected the option `` _ header _ '' , that produces a table with header information at the top and selected the output option `` _ table _ '' ( see table-[212-atnf - psrs ] ) . besides , it is possible to display functions of the pulsar parameters as a graph or as a histogram . for a normal ( x - y ) graph ,",
    "the values to plot are defined as regular expressions into the `` _ x , y - axis text box _ '' , and the axes of the graph can be displayed linearly or logarithmically .",
    "the expressions may also contain custom - defined variables or externally defined variables .",
    "next we discuss the prospective for the short rise fling of galactic raps in a supernova to generate detectable gw signals .",
    "the analysis starts from the observed kinematic state of raps , and goes back to their kicks at birth .",
    "to such an approach we assume that before the kick the star velocity is @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "first , let us notice that one can combine the first three pieces discussed above together with the extremely restrictive character of the thrust timescale ( @xmath6 ) , the magnitude of the largest velocity ( @xmath8 ) , and the instantaneous nature of the kick ( @xmath22 ) . in so doing , one can then conclude that whichever the driving engine might be , it should transfer to the star at the kick at birth an energy as large as @xmath23  erg .",
    "( recall that the ns masses are piled - up around 1.4  m@xmath12 ) .",
    "besides , keep in mind that according to newton s second law : @xmath24 , the star s inertia depends directly on its rest mass @xmath13 .",
    "thus , putting together these ingredients one can conclude that the effective acceleration , @xmath25 , at the kick at birth of each rap should be the same .",
    "in other words , because pulsar velocities vary by more than an order of magnitude , whilst the inertia ( mass ) of each neutron star is essentially the same ( within an uncertainty no greater then a factor of 2 ) , one concludes that the acceleration at the kick at birth for each of the pulsars has definitely to be the same . in all our analysis below we will use this key feature .",
    "further , as the kick is an `` instantaneous action '' , then the newtonian kinematics states that the largest velocity should be attained after the longest acceleration phase .",
    "that is ; over the longest traction time @xmath26 .",
    "therefore , the rap kinematics during the short rise fling follows the law    @xmath27    where @xmath28 defines the final ( at the end of the kick ) velocity of a given rap , which is reached after a total impulsion time @xmath29 .",
    "consequently , if one assumes for the sake of simplicity that the rap transit through the interstellar space does not modify its starting state of drifting , then one concludes that the largest ( presently observed velocity @xmath30 km  s@xmath2 ) must have been reached after the elapsing of the longest timescale permitted by the kick mechanism : @xmath31  s @xcite .",
    "thus , after collecting all the pieces on the raps physics described above one can infer the characteristic acceleration received by a typical rap . to this goal on can take the largest present velocity given by refs .",
    "@xcite ( see fig.-[psr - veloc - dist ] ) , and the constraint on the maximum traction timescale for the kick at birth@xcite .",
    "that acceleration then reads    @xmath32      the above analysis suggests that the overall time scale for acceleration of any given rap to its present velocity ( under the assumption stated above ) depends exclusively on the total energy with which it was thrusted .",
    "the actual amount of energy expended to thrust the star certainly has something to do with the nature of the driving mechanism .",
    "hence , the gw dynamics to be discussed below , combined with observations of galactic raps , may help to enlighten the path to unravel the actual thruster .",
    "next we provide order of magnitude estimates for both gw amplitude and frequency based on parameters of raps currently cataloged .",
    "( in the next section a rigurous derivation of these gw characteristics for the rap kick at birth is presented ) .      from eqs.([max - veloc])-([accel ] ) one can see that the traction time scale for any given pulsar is strictly directly proportional to its present spatial velocity .",
    "this is a conclusion of basic importance .",
    "that is , the rap current kinematics must retain information about what happened during its short rise fling in the supernova .",
    "thus , the frequency of the gw burst emitted during the early impulsion of a pulsar in a supernova explosion can be assumed , in a very simplified picture , as being inversely related to the total acceleration time @xcite , that is ,    @xmath35    as an example , let us take the values quoted above for @xmath8 , @xmath10 , and @xmath9",
    ". in these cases , one obtains the gw frequencies @xmath36  hz , @xmath37  hz , and @xmath38  hz , respectively .",
    "it is illustrative to compare these frequencies with those provided in figs.-([l2efficiency - a6 ] , [ l2efficiency ] , [ l1efficiency - a4 ] , [ eff = calib - ligo - i ] ) below .",
    "as shown next , the last ones would be detectable by present - day laser - beam interferometers whenever their associate strains ( computed below ) are large enough ( see fig.[approximate - sinal ] for the estimates of @xmath4 and @xmath34 for the 212 atnf raps sample ) .",
    "1.0truecm   and @xmath39 characteristics of the gw signal produced by each of the 212 pulsars calibrated with respect to ligo advanced ( green squares ) , and the same sample without calibration ( blue triangles ) .",
    "the effect of the calibration procedure is evident.,title=\"fig:\",width=288,height=288 ]      to have an order of magnitude estimate of the gw amplitude , @xmath4 , from the present kinematic state of a galactic rap one can use the general relativistic quadrupole formula    @xmath40    where @xmath41 is the pulsar distance as provided by the atnf catalog , and @xmath42 is the rap kinetic energy",
    ".    therefore , if one combines the theoretical prediction provided by eq.([frecuencia ] ) with this approximate gw amplitude , one obtains the plot presented in fig.([approximate - sinal ] ) .",
    "the estimates were performed for a sample of 212 pulsares selected from the australian telescope national facility ( atnf ) catalog @xcite . , distances , @xmath43 and orientations @xmath44 angles with respect to the line of sight . ]",
    "notice that eq.([amplitude - approx ] ) states that whenever the rap velocity is time - varying the signals , whose representative points appear above the strain sensitivity limit of advanced ligo , would be detectable by this observatory . for a rap with no time - varying velocity , the signal would be a direct - current - like ( dc ) signal that no detector might observe .",
    "( regarding the above estimates , keep in mind that at least the pulsar motion around the galactic center ( the bulge ) should be centripetally accelerated ) .    in fig.-[approximate - sinal ] blue triangles represent gw signals computed following this back - of - the - envelope technique .",
    "green squares are the obtained after calibrating the approximated signals against the strain sensitivity of advanced ligo .",
    "clearly only a few raps would be detectable if their gw signals were described in such an approximate fashion .",
    "moreover , this graph gives us a clear hint at the proper characteristics of the gw signal that would be emitted by a run away pulsar during its short rise fling in the supernova that makes it to drift across the galaxy .",
    "these order of magnitude estimates suggest that a rap that was kicked out from the supernova ejecta with higher speed and acceleration would produce a clearly detectable gw signal .",
    "this perspective motivated us to study the problem using a more rigurous physical description : the theory for the emission of gravitational wave signals by ultrarelativistic sources , a gw signal which has memory .",
    "this is done in the next section .",

    "although a galactic rap can not be considered an ultrarelativistic source , the pulsar rise fling during the supernova can kick it out with very high speed .",
    "that is why in the discussion below we analyze the gravitational radiation emitted during the kick at birth of raps within the framework of ref.@xcite . besides",
    ", it is also of worth to keep in mind that such an approach can be applied to the early raps dynamics because in this case the limit @xmath0 applies .",

    "the main different in between is related to the detailed description of the angular distribution of the gravitational radiation emitted in each of the cases that those authors analyzed .",
    "the formula indicates that the gw strain depends on the lorentz factor , pulsar speed and distance to the observer , and also on the strong beaming effect in the case of grbs , as indicated by the factors @xmath75 , and @xmath76 , appearing in the denominator of the equation .",
    "these effects are no so much important in the case of galactic raps , as is evident from the pulsar speed and angular size .",
    "this result , shown in fig.[gw - psr - grb - signal ] , states that the gw space - time perturbation is not strongly beamed in the forward direction @xmath58 , as opposed to the case of the electromagnetic radiation in gamma - ray bursts ( also shown in the same figure ) .",
    "instead , the metric perturbation at the ultra - relativistic limit ( not applicable to raps ) has a directional dependence scaling as @xmath77 .",
    "in such a case , because of the strong beaming effect , as in gamma - ray bursts ; for instance , the electromagnetic radiation emitted by the source over the same time interval is visible only inside the very small solid angle @xmath78 , whereas the gw signal is observable within a wider solid angle ; almost @xmath79 radians ( see fig.[gw - psr - grb - signal ] ) . besides , the observed gw frequency is doppler blueshifted in the forward direction , and therefore the energy flux carried by the gws is beamed in the forward direction , too . quite noticeable , in the case of raps the gw signal will have its maximum for viewing angles @xmath80 , that is ; for pulsar motions purely in the plane of the sky , as shown in fig .",
    "[ gw - psr - grb - signal ] .",

    "( we refer to this procedure as _ calibration _ ) . in order to do that we need first to compute the frequency at which the largest part of the gw emission is expected to take place .",
    "this is the so - called characteristic frequency @xmath103 , which is dependent on the detector design properties .",
    "should the detector have a power spectral density @xmath104 , have the characteristic frequency to be obtained from the frequency first moment of the time - dependent gw amplitude @xmath105 , i. e. ,    @xmath106^{-1 } , \\ ] ]    where @xmath107 is the fourier transform of @xmath105 , ] and the symbol @xmath92 stands for an average over randomly distributed angles of @xmath108 , and it can be approximated as @xmath109 .",
    "the characteristic frequency @xmath103 is strictly related to the characteristic amplitude @xmath33 , which is the physical quantity associated to the gw pulse @xmath105 to be detected by a given instrument .",
    "it can be computed as    @xmath110    in this way we take @xmath111 in the following form ( see ref.@xcite )    @xmath112     here @xmath113 defines the rise time of the memory of the signal .",
    "this equation is obtained from the eq.([hmax ] ) given above .",
    "thus , eq.([10a ] ) is the fourier transform of the gw waveform , where @xmath114 is given by ( after average over angles in eq.([hmax ] ) )    @xmath115    with @xmath116 the universal constant of gravitation , @xmath70 lorentz factor , @xmath117 star mass , @xmath118 distance to earth , and @xmath119 is now computed using the relation    @xmath120     where @xmath121^{1/2}$ ] is the average amplitude of the interferometer spectral noise at the characteristic frequency",
    ".    guided by table-[sn - ejecta ] , this allows us to compute the characteristic amplitude of the gw burst released during the short rise time of acceleration of each rap for which those parameters are estimated . since we are using only the transversal velocity of the pulsars , then we set @xmath122 in our calculations below .",
    "our main results are presented in figs.([k = t ] , [ k = u ] , [ k = v ] ) .",
    "those figures compare the gw signals from individual raps with the expected sensitivities of ligo i , its projected advanced configuration ligo ii , virgo , geo-600 , and tama-300 observatories .    at this stage , a note of caution to the attentive reader is needed .",
    "it regards with the appearance of the noise curves of tama , geo and virgo gw observatories in figures from 4 through 9 , in addition to the noise curves for ligo i and ligo advanced , despite that the calibration of the expected signals in those figures ( symbol : triangles , circles , etc . )",
    "is performed exclusively with respect to ligo i and ligo advanced , independently .",
    "first , the reader must keep in mind that the position of those points in the diagram h@xmath81 vs. f@xmath81 will change when the calibration of the expect gw strain is performed with respect to the noise curve of a different detector , say tama , virgo , etc .. for instance , compare fig.4(a ) and fig.5(a ) which are calibrated for ligo advanced and ligo i , respectively .",
    "second , thinking on the benefit of the scientific community operating observatories like tama , geo and virgo , those noise curves are included having in mind the expectation that such detectors might gain more sensitivity in both frequency band and amplitude so as to be able to catch the gw signals produced by milky way raps .",
    "finally , but not to the end , a direct interpretation of all the h@xmath81 vs. f@xmath81 diagrams in figures from 4 through 9 is that , exception done for the tama-300 gw detector , the signals ( points ) plotted in those figures appear to be not very much sensitive to the noise curves of the instruments ligo i , ligo advanced , virgo and geo-600 .",
    "this feature justifies to include those noise curves in such figures",
    ".    0.5 truecm",
    "we can start with by recalling both the inertia ( which is large for a neutron star progenitor ) and linear momentum conservation laws , which should dominate the physics of the sn explosion that gives the kick to the neutron star .",
    "thus , one can write      where m@xmath124 , m@xmath125 , and m@xmath126 are the sn , neutron star , and ejected material mass , respectively . be aware of the role of the `` @xmath127 '' signal in front of the term for the ejected material .",
    "it is responsible for a correct description of the physics at the explosion . without it ,",
    "one would obtain immaginary values for the searched parameter @xmath128 .",
    "now , by assuming parameters of a typical progenitor star m@xmath129 m@xmath130 , @xmath131 km s@xmath2 , m@xmath132 m@xmath130 for a canonical neutron star , and for the material in the ejected envelope m@xmath133 , and expansion velocity @xmath134 km s@xmath2 ( see table-[sn - ejecta ] ) , one obtains that the kick at birth velocity reads : @xmath135 km s@xmath2 ( compare to velocities taken from atnf in fig.[psr - veloc - dist ] ) .",
    "the discrepancy between them will be briefly discussed below .",
    "we first consider that the whole energy obtained from the conservation law discussed above goes into the pulsar kick , imparting to it no rotation at all .",
    "this is a very idealistic situation .",
    "nonetheless , it gives us an idea on the potential detectability of those gw signals from the flinging of a pulsar out of the sn cocoon .",
    "in other words , in this first approach we assume that the efficiency , @xmath138 , that relates the effective rap velocity @xmath139 ( which enters the calculation of @xmath33 ) and the kick speed @xmath140 is @xmath137 ! ( in the other cases analyzed below these velocities will be related through the expression : @xmath141 .",

    "<S> determination of pulsar parallaxes and proper motions addresses fundamental astrophysical open issues . here , </S>",
    "<S> after scrutinizing the atnf catalog searching for pulsar distances and proper motions , we verify that for an atnf sample of 212 galactic run away pulsars ( raps ) , which currently run across the galaxy at very high speed and undergo large displacements , some gravitational - wave ( gw ) signals produced by such present accelerations appear to be detectable after calibration against the advanced ligo ( ligo ii ) . </S>",
    "<S> motivated by this insight , we address the issue of the pulsar kick at birth , or _ short rise fling _ from a supernova explosion , by adapting the theory for emission of gw by ultrarelativistic sources to this case in which lorentz factor is @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we show that during the short rise fling each run away pulsar ( rap ) generates a gw signal with characteristic amplitude and frequency that makes it detectable by current gw interferometers . for a realistic analysis , </S>",
    "<S> an efficiency parameter is introduced to quantify the expenditure of the rise fling kinetic energy , which is estimated from the linear momentum conservation law applied to the supernova explosion that kicks out the pulsar . </S>",
    "<S> the remaining energy is supposed to be used to make the star to spin . </S>",
    "<S> thus , a comparison with the spin of atnf pulsars having velocity in the interval @xmath1 km s@xmath2 is performed . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting difference suggests that other mechanisms ( like differential rotation , magnetic breaking or magneto - rotational instability ) should dissipate part of that energy to produce the observed pulsar spin periods . </S>",
    "<S> meanwhile , the kick phenomenon may also occur in globular and open star clusters at the formation or disruption of very short period compact binary systems wherein abrupt velocity and acceleration similar to those given to raps during the short rise fling can be imparted to each orbital partner . </S>",
    "<S> to better analyzing these cases , pulsar astrometry from micro- to nano - arsec scales might be of much help . in case of a supernova </S>",
    "<S> , the rap gw signal could be a benchmark for the gw signal from the core collapse . </S>"
