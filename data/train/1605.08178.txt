    "entanglement in spin models is one of the central topics in modern condensed matter theory @xcite .",
    "it is frequently accompanied by frustration of exchange interactions @xcite",
    ". however , frustration alone is not sufficient to generate entanglement but in many cases it triggers entangled excited or ground states .",
    "some models without entanglement are exactly solvable in two dimensions , as for instance the fully frustrated two - dimensional ( 2d ) ising model of villain @xcite with the reversed sign of exchange interaction along every second column with respect to the unfrustrated square lattice , and its generalization with periodically distributed frustrated bonds along more distant columns @xcite .    in contrast , the 2d compass model @xcite , with competing @xmath6 and @xmath7 interactions between @xmath8 pseudospins ( @xmath9 and @xmath10 are pauli matrices ) along horizontal and vertical bonds in the square lattice , is quantum and has intrinsic entanglement which can be reliably treated only by advanced many - body methods @xcite , including quantum monte carlo @xcite , multi - configurational entanglement renormalization ansatz @xcite , or tensor networks at finite temperature @xcite .",
    "the latter approach allowed to confirm that long - range order develops in the 2d quantum compass model at finite temperature , in analogy to the 2d classical ising model , without or with frustrated interactions @xcite .",
    "moreover , the symmetry properties of the 2d compass model are responsible for certain relations between the correlations functions which may be viewed as hidden order @xcite .",
    "recent interest in the compass models is motivated by several developments : ( i ) investigating quantum phase transitions @xcite ; ( ii ) its relation to @xmath11 superconductivity @xcite ; ( iii ) recently confirmed prospect of topological quantum computing @xcite  it could be realized in nanoscopic systems where perturbing heisenberg interactions do not destroy the nematic order in the lowest energy excited states @xcite while the ground state remains ordered also at finite temperature @xcite ; ( iv ) order and excitations in case of compass interactions on a frustrated checkerboard lattice @xcite ; ( v ) spin - orbital physics in transition metal oxides with active orbital degrees of freedom @xcite ; ( vi ) its realization in iridates with strong spin - orbit coupling @xcite , leading to the compass interactions on the triangular lattice @xcite or to the exactly solvable kitaev model on the honeycomb lattice @xcite , and ( vii )  its experimental realizations in optical lattices @xcite . in case of ferromagnetic ( fm ) spin - orbital systems entanglement",
    "is absent @xcite and one finds here quantum orbital models @xcite .",
    "the 2d compass model is their generic representation and its interactions stand for directional orbital interactions between @xmath12 or @xmath13 orbitals on the 2d square or on three - dimensional ( 3d ) cubic lattice . while both @xmath12 and @xmath13 orbital models are distinct , none of them reduces to the compass model @xcite which is more universal and stands for the paradigm of directional interactions in the orbital physics @xcite .    in spite of their conceptual simplicity ,",
    "only very few quantum orbital models are exactly solvable . among them the kitaev model on the honeycomb lattice is the most prominent one as it describes a spin liquid with only nearest neighbor ( nn ) spin correlations @xcite . recently considerable attention attracted also the one - dimensional ( 1d ) compass model which is exactly solvable by the mapping on the transverse ising model @xcite . as the 2d compass model ,",
    "it includes only two spin components and the ground state is highly degenerate .",
    "this triggers various phase transitions when the interactions are tuned @xcite . by investigating the block entanglement entropy in the four ground - state phases it has been found that the changes of entanglement signal the second - order rather than the first - order transitions @xcite .",
    "further insights into the mechanism of quantum phase transitions were obtained by matrix product state approach @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the exact solution was generalized to the case with a finite transverse field @xcite which destabilizes the orbital - liquid ground state with macroscopic degeneracy and rather peculiar specific heat and polarization behavior of the 1d compass model follows from highly frustrated interactions @xcite .",
    "another exactly solvable case is the compass model on a ladder with leg and rung interactions satisfying the same directional pattern as in the 2d model @xcite . in contrast , the 1d plaquette orbital model with a topology of a ladder introduced recently @xcite is not exactly solvable but transforms to an effective 1d spin model in a magnetic field , with spin dimers that replace plaquettes and are coupled along the chain by three - spin interactions .",
    "this model is motivated by the 2d plaquette orbital model @xcite and has very interesting properties as the quantum effects are of purely short - range nature which makes it possible to estimate the ground state energy in the thermodynamic limit from the exact diagonalization of finite clusters .    in the present paper",
    "we investigate a generalization of the 1d plaquette compass model @xcite with the diagonal pseudospin interactions added within each plaquette .",
    "we present the phase diagrams obtained by exact diagonalization for finite systems with periodic boundary conditions ( pbcs ) which contain generic phases that are expected to appear for any system size .",
    "this model interpolates between two 1d compass models in absence of rung interactions .",
    "as we show below , the nematic phase found in this frustrated plaquette orbital model is similar to the one established for the 2d case @xcite which indicates that the present model realizes the paradigm of dimensional crossover within the class of compass models .",

    "the block diagonal hamiltonian has the following form : @xmath60 from the computational point of view it is worth to notice that thanks to the symmetries we reduce the number of quantum degrees of freedom by half , i.e. , instead of four initial pauli operators @xmath61 and their anticommuting partners per each plaquette ( see fig . [",
    "fig : plaqlad ] ) , we now have only two of them , @xmath62 , with anticommuting partners and two good quantum numbers @xmath63 taking values @xmath47 . thus instead of plaquettes with internal site index",
    "@xmath27 we now deal with dimers with @xmath64 . from the fundamental point of view",
    "the specific pattern of the @xmath65 ising spins is an important characterization of model s ground state at given values of the interactions , as we shall see further on .",
    "note that in the absence of diagonal interaction , i.e. , at @xmath29 , the model is equivalent to the 1d xy model in the external xy field . to see it clearly one can redefine the pauli operators to get rid of @xmath64 indices and gauge away the @xmath41 and @xmath66 phase from the interaction term (",
    "strictly speaking this can be done completely only for an open chain so we neglect here the closing @xmath67 bond ) .",
    "to do this we use a following transformation : @xmath68 and @xmath69 to get @xmath70 with @xmath71 here the chain has open boundary conditions ( obc ) . clearly the interaction part is the xy model that can be solved by a jordan - wigner transformation to get a solution in terms of free fermions with cosine dispersion . on the other hand ,",
    "the linear part makes the model unsolvable as it becomes nonlocal and of infinite order in the thermodynamic limit after the transformation .",
    "nevertheless , we find the @xmath14@xmath15 model written in this form simpler than in the original form introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite  see the appendix [ sec : appa ] for the transformation linking these two forms .",
    "another interesting limit is when @xmath72 and either @xmath73 or @xmath29 .",
    "looking at fig .",
    "[ fig : plaqlad ] one can easily see that in this limit the system splits into two independent subsystems and each of them is described by the so - called 1d compass model @xcite , with xx and zz interactions alternating on even / odd bonds .",
    "away from these points the two 1d compass models start to interact in a very complex way .",
    "apart from the local parities which are the symmetries of the model for any choice of its exchange parameters @xmath74 s , there is a special line in the parameter space , namely @xmath75 where the model has extra symmetries .",
    "these are interchanges of the two spins located at every rung of the ladder in fig .",

    "such interchange for a @xmath76 rung can be realized by a spin - interchange operator known from the so - called kumar model @xcite , i.e. , @xmath77 where @xmath78 .",

    "note that in analogy to the previous section we mapped a ladder hamiltonian onto a model of dimerized chain but here the building blocks are @xmath5 or @xmath87 spins .",

    "equivalently one can take a symmetric or antisymmetric combination of singlet and triplet and then for every rung @xmath76 we can choose between states @xmath104 and @xmath105 and for every rung @xmath80 we can have either @xmath106 or @xmath107 .",

    "we have investigated the consequences of frustration in the 1d plaquette compass @xmath14@xmath15 model with additional frustration due to finite antiferromagnetic exchange on plaquette diagonals .",
    "we have used a systematic approach based on the symmetry properties and demonstrated that different possible ground states of this model are characterized by the eigenvalues of the local parity operators being the symmetries of the model .",
    "a similar approach was used before for the 2d compass model @xcite and the 1d plaquette @xmath14@xmath15 compass model @xcite , but in these cases the ground state was always found in the simplest possible subspace where all the symmetry eigenvalues ( parities ) are positive .",
    "here we have seen that due to frustration caused by next nearest neighbor compass interactions along diagonal bonds in the ladder , there is a window in the parameter space @xmath278 where such a highly symmetric ground state , called here fmu , becomes unstable and one finds instead more exotic phase patterns containing negative parities .",
    "examples of such phases are an anti - fmu configuration , namely fmd where all the parities are negative , or various configurations where the parities alternate .",
    "furthermore , we have shown that some of these states can be stable for arbitrary system size whereas others are strongly related to small system sizes , i.e. , ladders of @xmath3 or @xmath20 plaquettes .",
    "we argue that the window of exotic phases stems from the frustration that one already finds for a single plaquette with zz interactions only .",
    "especially , the window for perfectly balanced xx and zz bonds never goes above @xmath188 , which is a value predicted by a single plaquette study , and its shoulders cover the phase transition lines encountered for a single plaquette .",
    "we have shown , however , that it can become broader ( exceeding @xmath188 ) when the anisotropy between xx and zz bonds is introduced .",
    "we note that in any case the window of exotic phases in the phase diagram connects two points in the phase diagram where the model is equivalent to the 1d compass model , namely @xmath72 and @xmath279 , with @xmath112 given by eq .",
    "( [ unit ] ) .",
    "it suggests that these phases are a continuation of the degenerate manifold of ground states of this peculiar 1d model @xcite .",
    "one could expect that the ground states always respect the symmetries of the initial ladder : ( i ) translational ones and ( ii ) the @xmath165 interchange invariance .",
    "however , we have observed that for ladders of up to @xmath4 plaquettes , the ground states exhibit lower symmetry than that of the initial ladder in the highly frustrated window in the phase diagram , and this manifests itself by ordered states with a longer period , i.e. , spontaneous multimerization . in particular , we have obtained four phases that seem to be stable for any even @xmath16 , two of them ( fmu and fmd ) preserve full translational invariance while one ( fmdu ) is dimerized and one ( fmd - af ) is tetramerized .",
    "we note that a similar dimerization due to purely quantum fluctuations was recently found in the kumar - heisenberg model @xcite , but in contrast to it here the transition to the dimerized state is discontinuous .",
    "in addition , we have found that for a system size @xmath16 being a multiplicity of three ( and even ) , two other configurations can be stabilized , one with a unit cell of three  fr3  and for the cell of six sites  fmd - fr3",
    ". these are examples of trimerized and hexamerized ground states .",
    "we argue that the trimmers are compatible with the three - site interactions in the effective hamiltonian that stem from the diagonal bonds .",
    "apart from these rather regular phases we have also found configurations that we called quantum disordered in the sense that their periodicity was equal to the system length @xmath280 .",
    "these phases were different for @xmath3 and @xmath20 , and we suggest that they occur only in so small systems while they are gradually destabilized by ordered phases with longer periods when the system size increases .    finally , for high enough @xmath110 , here @xmath281 , and maximal frustration of leg and diagonal interactions , i.e. , @xmath189 , we have observed a nematic phase from @xmath3 to @xmath4 and in the anisotropic ladder of @xmath3 plaquettes as well .",
    "nematicity here means that the state is an eigenstate of all rung bonds of the ladder optimizing their energies but in the same time it is an eigenstate with zero energy of the ladder hamiltonian without rungs .",
    "this means that effectively only the rung bonds contribute to the ground - state energy .",
    "we note that this state is similar to the nematic state of the 2d compass model @xcite .",
    "this observation together with the 1d compass points found in the phase diagrams makes us claim that the present ladder model realizes indeed the paradigm of dimensional crossover within the class of compass models .",
    "quite surprisingly , the vertical onset of the nematic phase is always well within the window of exotic phases , below the classical boarder of @xmath188 where the window typically closes . in this area of the phase diagram",
    "there is clearly a very subtle competition of several energy scales that results in what we call bubble phases being attached to the line of nematic phase .",
    "these bubbles seem to be generic as they are present for @xmath3 , 6 , and 8 , as well as in the anisotropic ladder of @xmath3 plaquettes . in absence of anisotropy",
    "these are pieces of the fmd phase which is typically stable in the wedges touching the compass points .",
    "the nematic phase is characterized by a macroscopic degeneracy of @xmath99 related to the fact that the values of local parity operators do not affect the energy here and there are @xmath280 of them .",
    "but in contrast to the compass model on the checkerboard lattice @xcite , the high degeneracy in the nematic phase and at the compass points is not removed by quantum fluctuations .",
    "the nematic phase appears as a highly singular part of the plaquette model where the continuum of states is squeezed to one point . by a perturbative expansion around the nematic phase we have demonstrated a competition between fmu and fmdu phases .",
    "fmu ( fmdu ) phase wins in the large ( small ) @xmath110 limit . in all phase diagrams",
    "we have identified a special point of 1d @xmath5 compass model which gives a gapped and unique disordered ground state at @xmath282 and @xmath283 .    as stated before ,",
    "we argue that the window of exotic phases connecting the two compass points in the phase diagram is an evolution of the manifold of compass ground states for finite @xmath110 .",
    "quite remarkably , this evolution seems to preserve the entanglement that manifests itself by a high mutual information of the neighboring dimers in the effective block - diagonal hamiltonian or , equivalently , high mutual information of the neighboring plaquettes in the original ladder hamiltonian .",
    "the mutual information seems to be the highest at the compass points whereas it is low in the most prolific fmu phase ( including the ground state of the @xmath14@xmath15 model @xcite ) .",
    "however , in the window of exotic phases the entanglement is typically high and comparable to the compass points .",
    "we argue that this high entanglement originates from high frustration that can be , to some extent , understood in terms of a single - plaquette study .    summarizing",
    ", we would like to emphasize that the results presented for larger systems of @xmath19 and @xmath4 plaquettes provide enough information to anticipate the possible phases for any @xmath16 .",
    "we have shown that phases fmd , fmu , fmdu appear always , as well as fmd - fr(@xmath208 ) for @xmath16 divisible by 4 , while in other cases when @xmath16 is divisible by 3 phases fr3 and fmd - fr3 appear instead , together with a similar qd1 phase .",
    "we have observed that quantum disordered phases appear usually when the system size @xmath16 is not compatible with the actual unit cell of an ordered phase , favored otherwise in a given range of parameters .",
    "we suggest that the obtained phase diagram for @xmath4 plaguettes is already quite close to the ultimate phase diagram in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the presented analysis of so complex phase diagrams proves that the model is challenging enough to address the relevant phases by carrying out an extensive density matrix renormalization group study for relatively large system size @xmath16 at the level of the original ladder hamiltonian , as probing of all @xmath144 configurations is too demanding beyond the system sizes considered here .",
