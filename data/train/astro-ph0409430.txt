    "in cosmological theories of structure formation , non  linear objects form when overdense dark matter perturbations turn around , collapse , and settle into virial equilibrium ( e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "gas initially collapses together with the dark matter , but eventually encounters nearly stationary material that had already collapsed .",
    "since the gas is falling in at supersonic velocities , it is slowed down by hydrodynamical shocks , and these shocks are thought to heat the gas to the virial temperature of the dark matter halo .    in spherically symmetric models , and in the absence of dissipation ,",
    "a single strong gaseous shock occurs at approximately half of the turn  around radius @xcite , coinciding with the `` virial radius '' of the dark matter halo .",
    "more realistically , the behavior of the post  shock gas depends sensitively on its cooling time @xcite . on galactic scales ( @xmath5 ) and below , and increasingly toward high redshifts ( @xmath6 ) , the gas can cool rapidly and loose its pressure support , and hence continue its infall . on these scales , the existence of large ",
    "scale shocks have been recently called into question by models in which the bulk of the infalling gas remains cold , and reaches the central regions of the dark halo before encountering shocks @xcite . on larger scales , however , where cooling times are long , such as for galaxy clusters , the existence of virial shocks remains an unambiguous prediction of cosmological structure formation theories .",
    " dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of cluster formation ( e.g. @xcite ) have confirmed the existence of virial shocks , with strong discontinuities in gas density and temperature . these and subsequent simulations have also revealed that the infall is anisotropic , with gas falling in to the cluster potential along cosmic filaments . as a result ,",
    "the radial location and strength of the shocks varies along different directions .",
    "the virial shocks are a fundamental ingredient of cosmic structure formation , and may be responsible for diverse phenomenae , such as generating large  scale cosmic magnetic fields @xcite and accelerating electrons to contribute to the diffuse cosmic gamma  ray background @xcite . the radial location of the shocks , in principle",
    ", also contains information on the cosmological parameters @xcite . despite their importance",
    ", direct evidence for the existence of such shocks does not yet exist .",
    "the major difficulty in observing the virial shock is that it is expected to lie several mpc ( and several arcminutes ) away from the cluster center , a location at which signals such as the x  ray surface brightness @xcite , or galaxy number density / peculiar velocities ( which could reveal density caustics , @xcite ) diminish rapidly .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the detectability of virial shocks in future observations of galaxy clusters through the sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) effect .",
    "the thermal sz effect is a secondary distortion of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) spectrum caused by the hot intra ",
    "cluster gas along the line of sight to the surface of last scattering ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the cool cmb photons undergo inverse compton scattering on the hot electrons , gaining on average a small amount of energy in the process , creating an intensity decrement at low frequencies ( @xmath7 ) and an increment at high frequencies .",
    "the sz effect is the dominant source of cmb anisotropy at small angular scales .",
    "the sz effect has recently become a valuable observational tool @xcite .",
    "several programs have begun to map out massive clusters of galaxies , study the intracluster medium ( icm ) , and constrain cosmological parameters .",
    "current instruments are now detecting and imaging clusters at high signal - to - noise , and the next generation of instruments should be capable of mapping significant portions of the sky as a means of finding clusters of galaxies ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "several studies have predicted the number of clusters that could be detected in future sz surveys @xcite .",
    "the survey yields are quite impressive .",
    "next generation instruments , such as the atacama cosmology telescope ( act ) , south pole telescope ( spt ) , and the _ planck _ satellite , are expected to detect several clusters per day ; the large resulting samples can be used to select the most massive and most regular clusters that will be best suited for the studies proposed here .",
    "the sz effect is ideally suited to study the `` outskirts '' of clusters , because the sz temperature decrement profile is relatively flat ( e.g. @xmath8 , whereas the x  ray emission is proportional to the square of the local density ; @xcite ) .",
    "although our main focus is to assess the significance at which the shocks can be detected , we also consider the more general problem of constraining the cluster gas distribution , as well as the structure of the dark matter halos themselves .",
    "the detection of sharp features , such as the virial shocks , calls for high sensitivity , high  resolution maps of the sz surface brightness profile of the most massive clusters . for this reason",
    ", we here focus on predictions appropriate for the atacama large millimeter array ( alma ) , a telescope array expected to be operational in 2012 and deliver @xmath9arcsecond resolution , high  sensitivity imaging of clusters .",
    "our results can be scaled to apply to other instruments with different parameters .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in   [ sec : alma ] , we summarize the relevant characteristics of alma . in   [ sec : rhoprofiles ] , we describe our models for the structure of galaxy clusters .",
    "these models are based on standard descriptions of gas in hydrostatic equilibrium with a dark matter halo , except that we introduce additional free parameters that allow us to vary the location and sharpness of the virial shock . in   [ sec : szprofiles ] , we compute and contrast the sz surface brightness profiles in models with different virial shocks . in   [ sec : noise ] , we discuss the sources of noise in the sz surface brightness maps . in   [ sec : edgedetection ] , we present simple estimates to argue that , in the face of noise , smooth cluster profiles can be distinguished at high significance from profiles that include a virial shock . in   [ sec : parameters ] , we go one step further , and compute the statistical accuracy at which the location and sharpness of the shock fronts , as well as other parameters describing the cluster profile , can be determined from future sz maps . finally , in   [ sec : conclusions ] we summarize our conclusions and discuss the implications of this work .",
    "several technical points , related to our statistical analysis , are discussed in the appendices .    throughout this paper",
    "we assume a standard cold  dark matter cosmology ( @xmath10cdm ) , with ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 ) = ( 0.7 , 0.3 , 0.045 , 70 km s@xmath15 mpc@xmath15 ) , consistent with the recent results from _ wmap _ @xcite .",
    "the three crucial characteristics of any instrument for the detection of the virial shocks are angular resolution ( needed since the features caused by the shocks are sharp ) , angular coverage ( needed since the features can extend coherently over arcminute scales ) , and sensitivity ( the surface brightness change across the shock  front is as small as a few @xmath16k ) .",
    "alma has an ideal combination of these three qualities , and is well suited to studying the gas density cutoff .",
    "alma will be comprised of sixty four 12-meter sub - millimeter quality antennae , with baselines extending from 150 m up to 10 km .",
    "its receivers will cover the range from @xmath17 to @xmath18 ghz .",
    "anticipated sz temperature sensitivity for a @xmath19 integration period is between @xmath20 and @xmath21mk for the compact configuration depending on the frequency of the detection .",

    "the second and third columns show the beam diameter and the sensitivity at a fixed integration time of 60s . in the fourth and fifth columns",

    "inevitable astrophysical contaminants include radio point sources , bright foreground ( and background ) clusters along the line of sight , and the primary and secondary cmb anisotropies .    as pointed out in ",
    "[ sec : alma ] above , the atmospheric and detector uncertainties will not be crucial at moderate frequencies , as the alma system can reduce its noise level below @xmath1 for a @xmath139 beam at @xmath140 in an integration time of @xmath141 .",
    "similarly , bright extragalactic foregrounds will not pose a great barrier against the observation of virial shocks .",
    "the radio point sources cover only a negligible portion of the set of relevant pixels , and their removal reduces the efficiency of a high resolution detection by a negligible amount . the flux of the brightest clusters identified in separate wide  field x - ray and sz surveys can also be subtracted from the image .",
    "moreover , uncertainties from the imprecision of this information can be minimized by choosing galaxy clusters with no obvious overlapping foreground clusters .",
    "the magnitude of uncertainties from primary and secondary cmb anisotropies can be assessed by the analysis of the corresponding angular power spectra .",
    "the primary cmb anisotropy supplies the dominant power on large - scales , but is exponentially suppressed well below @xmath1 for scales under @xmath142 .",
    "the angular radius of the clusters decreases below this scale at @xmath143 for @xmath125 and @xmath144 for @xmath145 ( eq . [ eq : theta ] ) .",
    "we shall restrict our calculations to larger redshifts , where secondary cmb anisotropies will likely dominate .",

    "the ov contribution can be approximated by a flat band power contribution of @xmath146 @xcite . according to both theoretical and numerical studies @xcite , the rms power of the unresolved thermal sze contamination is between @xmath147 and @xmath148 on arcminute scales . for low ",
    "mass clusters this noise background is strongly non - gaussian , and there is a significant amount of uncertainty in the small - scale power spectrum , due to non - gravitational effects such as gas cooling and feedback from star formation . for a conservative estimate , we shall assume that the fluctuations around the sz profile are given by white gaussian noise with amplitude @xmath149 .",
    "in this section , we consider the detectability of virial shocks in galaxy clusters .",
    "the basic input to this analysis is a ( mock ) sz surface brightness map of the cluster .",
    "we compute the sz profile @xmath150 according to equation  ( [ eq : t(x ) ] ) in a mock `` fiducial '' model , in which the cluster is assumed to be spherically symmetric with a well  defined edge , at the position of the virial shock .",
    "this fiducial model is uniquely described by five parameters , specifying the global properties of the cluster @xmath151 and the location and sharpness of the virial shock @xmath152 . for concreteness , in the numerical calculations",
    ", we use a single , fixed measurement frequency of @xmath153 .",
    "this value was chosen to minimize the integration time needed for alma , while keeping the total sz decrement around its maximum in the nonrelativistic regime .",
    "our basic task is to evaluate the significance , given the @xmath35k noise , at which @xmath154 can be distinguished from a different model profile @xmath155 , computed in a test model that does not include a shock .",
    "this task immediately raises the question : what should the no  edge benchmark model be for this comparison ?",
    "the simplest approach would be to choose the underlying density profile to be identical to that in the fiducial model within @xmath156 . in the absence of a virial shock , however , the smooth density profile would extend to some large radius .",
    "this could be expressed by choosing the same parameters @xmath157 as in the fiducial model , but replacing the location of the virial shock by @xmath158 .",
    "however , a complication is that our procedure to self ",
    "consistently normalize the density profile ( eq.[eq : rho_gas0 ] ) would then fail , due to the divergence of the mass integral ( eq .",
    "[ eq : m(x ) ] ) . to resolve this ambiguity",

    "equivalently , the central decrements @xmath119 are assumed to be the same for the two hypotheses .",

    "the location of the virial shock @xmath160 is chosen to equal the radius at which the cluster gas density equals the background baryon density .",
    "this value is between @xmath163 for typical clusters with virial mass @xmath164 , at any redshift and @xmath47 ( either 1 or 1.5 ) .",
    "the gas density normalization is calculated self  consistently , using equation  ( [ eq : rho_gas0 ] ) . the profile outside @xmath160 is truncated with @xmath89 .",
    "note that the temperature decrement scale @xmath119 and the central temperature decrement @xmath123 of this model are both different from the fiducial model ( by @xmath165 for @xmath166 for @xmath167 ) .",
    "model ii has the advantage of a closed and self  consistent theoretical description , where @xmath66 and thus @xmath168 is derived directly from a set of underlying assumptions .",
    "however , we note that the sz brightness profile in this model differs from the fiducial model because of the `` renormalized '' value of the temperature decrement @xmath119 .",
    "hence , the distinguishability of test model ii from the fiducial model will have an additional indirect dependence on the presence of the virial shock , through the effect of the virial shock on the overall normalization of the density profile .",
    "this inference will then be model ",
    "dependent ( i.e. on our particular assumption about the relationship between the location of the virial shock and the normalization of the gas density ) , and also subject to uncertainties due to physical effects ( i.e. preheating ; @xcite ) that can significantly modify the inner density profile .",
    "nevertheless , we find in our calculations below that the change in the temperature due to its renormalization is relatively small , and changes in the sz brightness profile are only significant in the inner regions .",
    "overall , the temperature change adds nearly negligibly to the detectability of the virial shock .",
    "hence , in practice , model ii is a useful alternative to model i. the latter , by construction , isolates the effect on the surface brightness profile of a sharp discontinuity itself .",
    "the expected sz profile of a cluster with or without a cutoff can be calculated from equation  ( [ eq : t(x ) ] ) in the fiducial model , and compared to the profile in either test model . in the next two subsections , we quantify the significance for detecting the difference between these pairs of models .    in these estimates",
    ", we will assume that the interferometer has fully synthesized an aperture , yielding a narrow ( @xmath169 ) effective point response function ( prf ) .",
    "as discussed above , this assumption is realistic for @xmath3hr interferometric observations with alma .",

    "dish technique of estimating @xmath170 , in which the image of the extended source can be thought of as being composed of @xmath171 independent pixels ( where each pixel covers a solid angle of @xmath172 square arcseconds ) .",
    "finally , as stated above , in the simplest estimates , we fix the parameters @xmath173 in model i , and the parameters @xmath151 in model ii , to be the same as in the fiducial model .",
    "while @xmath41 and @xmath79 can be independently estimated from gravitational lensing , x  ray , and optical data , the decrement normalization @xmath119 of the fiducial model will not be known a  priori .",

    "+    in conclusion , the estimates in this section indicate that the temperature decrement difference across a virial shock front causes a difference of approximately @xmath233k in the sz surface brightness maps .",
    "this is a small difference , approximately at the level of the expected noise .",
    "hence , in single neighboring pixels , the shock fronts will not stand out to be detectable .",

    "the main deficiency of the signal  to  noise ratio analysis in the previous subsection is that at least some of the parameters of the test model will not be known a priori .",
    "this , in general , will make the cluster s virial shock more difficult to detect , since one may be able to adjust the variable parameters of the no  edge test model to better mimic the fiducial model that includes the shock .",
    "the mass @xmath41 and redshift @xmath79 of the cluster can be independently estimated ( e.g. from gravitational lensing , x  ray , and optical data ) , and the inner density profile slope @xmath47 has a relatively small impact on our conclusions .",
    "hence , we still fix the values of these parameters in this section .",

    "in addition , the concentration parameter of the cluster @xmath44 , which , in principle , can be ultimately derived from simulations , is still somewhat uncertain .",
    "therefore , we allow @xmath238 to be the second of our two free parameters of the test model in this section .",

    "a different complication is that our analysis relies on mock data , rather than actual data .",

    "we find that this is the case , for example , for @xmath264 and @xmath265 , where the local minimum near the fiducial values is not global , and the global minimum @xmath266 instead lies at a much larger sz temperature and a much smaller concentration .",
    "this behavior follows from the fact that decreasing @xmath44 , while fixing all other parameters , produces a steeper @xmath267 profile on log - log scale in the outer regions , a better approximation of the fiducial model with a virial shock . on the other hand ,",
    "the decrease in @xmath44 also slightly decreases the sz temperature in the inner regions , which can be compensated by increasing @xmath119 .",

    "we then compare the temperature decrement in the fiducial model , @xmath269 , to two different sets of test models .",

    "these two cases are analogous to the test models i and ii in the previous sections .",
    "in the first case ( model i ) , we consider a set of four unknowns @xmath119 , @xmath44 , @xmath67 , and @xmath88 . in the second case ( model ii )",

    "tables  [ tab : parameter variance2 ] and [ tab : parameter variance1 ] show the 68% and 95% significance uncertainties for models i and ii , as calculated from the fisher matrix .",
    "generally , increasing the number of free variables can increase the uncertainty of the original variables , since a model with additional free parameters can better mimic the fiducial model for a given mock observation .",
    "however , our calculations indicate that this is not the case in our case : the uncertainties on @xmath67 and @xmath88 are nearly the same in models i and ii . this is perhaps unsurprising , since one would not expect that a change in @xmath44 or @xmath119 ( the additional free parameters in model i ) can mimic changes in either @xmath67 and @xmath88 .",
