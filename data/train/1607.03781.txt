    "<S> our main result is that the rescaled residual atomic population @xmath67 is a universal function of the rescaled parameters @xmath68 and @xmath69  @xcite . to confirm this prediction , we solve the dynamics for different @xmath45 and calculate the residual atomic population for a set of values of @xmath53 and @xmath11 leading to a fixed value of @xmath70 </S>",

    "<S> the graphs no longer collapse onto the theoretically predicted universal function . </S>",
    "<S> this comes from the fact that the long evolution time @xmath141 required for the adiabatic condition is much larger than the coherence time of the ion , which is about @xmath142 . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , however , the asymptotic behavior of @xmath27 for @xmath32 still follows the predicted power - law of @xmath133 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , our simulation shows that one can quantitatively measure the finite - frequency scaling exponent of @xmath25 of the ground state , even in the presence of the noises . </S>",
    "<S> the measurement of the finite - frequency scaling exponent could serve as an experimental confirmation of the quantum phase transition of the rabi model  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , we find that the non - equilibrium universal function @xmath99 is much more robust to the effect of noise . as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:3 ] ( b ) , the rescaled data points collapse into a single universal curve . </S>",
    "<S> although there is a slight deviation from the ideal case , the universality in the dynamics still remains intact . </S>",
    "<S> the robustness of the non - equilibrium universal function to noises stems from the relatively short evolution time @xmath45 compared to the coherence time . </S>",
    "<S> while the small spectral gap near the critical point necessitates a very large @xmath45 for the adiabatic preparation of the ground state , the nearly adiabatic dynamics considered here requires the adiabaticity only away from the critical point where the energy gap does not vanish , which makes its experimental observation more favorable than the equilibrium case .    _ </S>",
    "<S> conclusion. _ we have demonstrated that the rabi qpt and its universal dynamics can be observed in a trapped - ion setup with a single ion using the equilibrium and non - equilibrium universal functions as a probe thus opening the doors for the experimental exploration of the properties of second - order quantum phase transitions with trapped ions .    _ </S>",
