    "an experimental search for variation in the fine structure constant , @xmath2 , is strongly motivated by many modern theories .",
    "in particular , theories attempting to unify gravitation with the other fundamental interactions , such as superstring theory , often require the existence of extra , ` compactified ' , spatial dimensions .",
    "the scale size of the extra dimensions is related to the values of the fundamental constants in our observable 4dimensional subspace .",
    "thus , evolution of these scale sizes with cosmology leads to time variation of the fundamental constants , such as @xmath0 ( e.g. forgcs & horvth 1979 ; marciano 1984 ; barrow 1987 ; damour & polyakov 1994 ) .",
    "currently , it seems that there is no theoretical mechanism for keeping the extra dimensions constant in size ( li & gott 1998 ) and so such theories naturally predict variation of @xmath0 .",
    "quasar ( qso ) absorption line studies provide a powerful probe of such variation .",
    "savedoff ( 1956 ) first analysed doublet separations seen in galaxy emission spectra to obtain constraints on variation of @xmath0 .",
    "absorption lines in intervening clouds along the line of sight to qsos are substantially narrower than intrinsic emission lines and therefore provide a more precise probe of @xmath0 .",
    "bahcall , sargent & schmidt ( 1967 ) first used alkali doublet ( ad ) spacings of gas seen in absorption which seemed to be intrinsic to the qso .",
    "they obtained the constraint @xmath3 at a redshift @xmath4 .",
    "here , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the values of @xmath0 at the absorption redshift , @xmath7 , and in the laboratory respectively .",
    "since then , several authors ( e.g. cowie & songaila 1995 ; varshalovich , panchuk & ivanchik 1996 ) have applied the ad method to doublets of several species ( e.g. civ , siii , , mgii , aliii etc . ) arising from intervening absorption clouds at significantly lower redshift than the background qso .",
    "the most recent and stringent constraint using the ad method was obtained by varshalovich , potekhin & ivanchik ( 2000 , hereafter vpi00 ) using the @xmath81393/1402 doublet .",
    "a change in @xmath0 will lead to a change in the doublet separation given by ( vpi00 , correcting a typographical error ) @xmath9\\,.\\ ] ] here , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the relative doublet separations in the absorption cloud ( at redshift @xmath7 ) and in the laboratory respectively and @xmath12 is a constant taking into account higher order relativistic corrections . from 16 absorption systems ( towards 6 qsos ) they obtained a mean @xmath13 using a line fitting method .",
    "the error quoted here is statistical only .",
    "vpi00 augment this with an additional systematic error term , @xmath14 , due to uncertainties in the laboratory doublet separation , @xmath11 , assumed in their analysis ( see table [ tab : wls ] ) .",
    "this estimate of the potential systematic error seems optimistic considering that the error in the laboratory wavelength separation was previously quoted at @xmath15 ( ivanchik , potekhin & varshalovich 1999 ) . from equation [ eq : varsh ] ,",
    "the corresponding systematic error in @xmath16 is @xmath17 which is more consistent with the value reported by ivanchik et al .",
    "( 1999 ) ( @xmath18 ) than by vpi00 .",
    "there are three ways in which the above constraints can be significantly improved without the need for a much larger sample :    1",
    ".   improved spectral resolution : many of the spectra used by vpi00 have fwhm @xmath19 ( e.g. petitjean , rauch & carswell 1994 ; varshalovich et al .",
    "1996 ) while many absorption systems are known to contain  lines with @xmath20-parameters ( i.e. doppler widths ) @xmath21 ( e.g. outram , chaffee & carswell 1999 ) .",
    "fwhm @xmath22 is now routinely used for qso observations with , for example , the keck / hires and the vlt / uves .",
    "therefore , such spectra offer the opportunity to significantly improve constraints on @xmath16 .",
    "improved signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) : many of the spectra used by vpi00 have snr @xmath23 per pixel . with the advent of 810 m telescopes , significantly greater",
    "snr can be achieved ( e.g. prochaska & wolfe 1996 , 1997 , 1999 ) .",
    "3 .   improved laboratory wavelength measurements : griesmann & kling ( 2000 ) have increased the absolute precision of the laboratory wavelengths of @xmath81393 and 1402 by more than two orders of magnitude .",
    "we compare the new values with those used by vpi00 ( kelly 1987 ; morton 1991 , 1992 ) in table 1 .",
    "note that even our conservative estimate of the systematic error on @xmath16 in equation [ eq : daerr ] is too small .",
    "the new measurements imply that the vpi00 result in equation [ eq : varsh ] should be corrected by @xmath24 to @xmath25 .",
    "if the error in the difference between the doublet wavelengths is equal to the absolute uncertainty ( i.e. @xmath26 ) then a precision limit of @xmath27 can now be reached .",
    "this should be true of griesmann & kling s measurement since statistical errors in the line positions dominated their error budget ( ulf griesmann , private communication ) .",
    "+ [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      there may have been weak , interloping , unresolved lines which , if the interloping species were in the same absorption cloud , could have produced a shift in the fitted line wavelengths of all velocity components of one or both  transitions .",
    "we distinguish between _ random _ blends and _ systematic _ blends .",
    "_ random _ blends may occur if many absorption clouds at different redshifts intersect the line of sight to a single qso .",
    "systematic _ blend will occur when two species are in the same cloud and have absorption lines with similar rest - wavelengths .",
    "such an effect could mimic a systematic shift in @xmath0 .",
    "we have searched atomic line databases ( moore 1971 ; the vienna atomic line database ( vald )  piskunov et al . 1995 and kupka et al . 1999 ) for transitions of any species which may blend with @xmath81393 or 1402 . the search was restricted to transitions from the ground state with rest wavelengths @xmath8 such that @xmath28 .",
    "this is a conservative upper limit adopted from simulations of typical blends in m01b .",
    "we did not identify any potential blends with @xmath81402 satisfying this criteria .",
    "for @xmath81393 we found one potential interloper : bei@xmath81393 at @xmath29 ( vald ) .",
    "this transition has an oscillator strength of @xmath30 .",
    "the bei@xmath82349 transition is nearly three orders of magnitude stronger than this ( @xmath31 ) and , to our knowledge , has never been detected in qso absorption spectra .",
    "this safely rules out bei@xmath81393 as a candidate interloper .    in summary",
    ", we have found no known atomic transitions which may blend with either of the  doublet lines .",
    "we have not considered molecular transitions as potential interlopers but consider this possibility to be unlikely ( see m01b for discussion ) .",
    "si has three naturally occurring isotopes , @xmath32si , @xmath33si and @xmath34si , with terrestrial abundances in the ratio 92.23:4.68:3.09 ( rosman & taylor 1998 ) .",
    "thus , each absorption line will be a composite of absorption lines from all three isotopes .",
    "we are not aware of any experimental determinations of the spectral separations between the isotopic components .",
    "thus , the values of @xmath35 in table [ tab : wls ] ( griesmann & kling 2000 ) are _ composite _ wavenumbers only .",
    "these wavenumbers will only strictly be applicable in the optically thin regime ( linear part of the curve of growth ) .",
    "as the column density increases , the strongest isotopic component begins to saturate and the line centroid will shift according to the natural abundances ( cf . section [ sec : isovar ] ) of the other isotopes .",
    "estimates of the isotopic separations for the  doublet have been made by w. r. johnson ( private communication ) and these are summarised in table [ tab : iso ] . from these separations",
    "we have estimated the absolute isotopic wavenumbers ( @xmath35 in table [ tab : iso ] ) such that the abundance - weighted mean of the isotopic wavenumbers equals the composite values in table [ tab : wls ] .",
    "the error in these results is @xmath36 and comes from errors in the isotopic separations .",
    "if we consider a  doublet with a single velocity component then , as the @xmath81393 line begins to saturate , the line centroid will shift bluewards .",
    "the effective doublet separation will continue to increase but this increase will eventually slow and reverse as the @xmath81402 transition begins to saturate .",
    "it is clear that this is a potentially important systematic effect for the  doublet .",
    "therefore , we have used the values of @xmath35 in table [ tab : iso ] to re - calculate @xmath16 for our sample of  absorbers .",
    "only 5 systems clearly contain saturated components and @xmath16 in these systems displays the expected behaviour : @xmath16 becomes more negative when the isotopic structures are included .",
    "overall , the weighted mean for our sample becomes @xmath37 .",
    "timmes & clayton ( 1996 ) suggest that the abundance of @xmath33si and @xmath34si should decrease with decreasing metallicity . in general ,",
    "damped lyman-@xmath0 systems ( dlas ) , which some of our  doublets are associated with , are thought to have metallicities @xmath38 at high redshift ( e.g. prochaska & wolfe 2000 ) . if the isotopic abundances of si at redshifts @xmath393 differ substantially from their terrestrial values then this may mimic a shift in @xmath0 .",
    "the dominant component of the isotopic shift is the mass shift : @xmath40 for @xmath41 the atomic mass .",
    "thus , for a single ion , the mass shift is degenerate with the redshift parameter fitted to the velocity components of an absorption system .",
    "that is , it will have no affect on our values of @xmath16 .",
    "the specific isotopic shifts for the  doublet have been calculated by w. r. johnson ( private communication ) and are given in table [ tab : iso ] .",
    "we also show the volume isotopic shift for @xmath34  as calculated by v. a. dzuba ( private communication ) and these are clearly negligibly small",
    ". the specific shift is not degenerate with redshift but only at a negligible level .",
    "thus , even if the isotopic ratios of @xmath33si and @xmath34si are much smaller in our  absorbers , this will have a negligible affect on @xmath16 .",
    "hyperfine splitting can lead to saturation effects similar to the isotopic saturation effects discussed in section [ sec : diffiso ] .",
    "the transitions of the @xmath33si isotope will experience hyperfine splitting since the neutron number is odd . as with the isotopic structure",
    ", the magnitude of hyperfine splitting has not been measured .",
    "however , v. a. dzuba ( private communication ) has estimated the splitting and finds it to be a factor of @xmath422 times smaller than the isotopic splitting .",
    "this may also be estimated by comparison with the hyperfine structure of @xmath43 mg since the  and mgii doublets have similar ground and excited state wavefunctions and the magnetic moments of mg and si are similar .",
    "drullinger , wineland & bergquist ( 1980 ) have measured the hyperfine splitting of the @xmath43mgii@xmath82796 transition : the hyperfine splitting is @xmath422 times smaller than the isotopic separations .",
    "it is therefore clear that saturation effects will be negligible .      as discussed in m01a , 5 of our absorption systems",
    "were observed without the use of an image rotator ( i.e. they were observed before august 1996 when a rotator was installed on hires ) .",
    "the qso light is dispersed across the spectrograph slit by the atmosphere and , if the slit is not maintained perpendicular to the horizon by an image rotator , light of different wavelengths will enter the spectrograph at slightly different angles .",
    "in m01b we discussed two effects resulting from this : ( i ) a bulk stretching of the spectra relative to the thar calibration frames and ( ii ) a distortion of the psf due to truncation of the dispersed seeing disc on either side of the slit jaws .",
    "we do not consider ( ii ) any further since the effect on @xmath16 found in m01b was small and since the distortion should be very similar at both  doublet wavelengths .",
    "we consider effect ( i ) below .",
    "the optical design of hires at the time at which our affected data was taken was such that @xmath44 for @xmath45 the angle of the slit to the vertical and @xmath46 the zenith angle of the object ( tom bida , steve vogt , personal communications ) .",
    "consider two wavelengths , @xmath47 and @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) , falling across the spectrograph slit .",
    "if we were to measure the spectral separation between these two wavelengths on the ccd , @xmath50 , we would find that @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the ccd pixel size in ngstroms , @xmath53 is the projected slit width in arc seconds per pixel ( for hires , @xmath54 per pixel ) and @xmath55 is the angular separation ( in arc seconds ) of @xmath47 and @xmath48 at the slit .",
    "@xmath55 is a function of the atmospheric conditions along the line of sight to the object and can be approximated using the refractive index of air at the observer and the zenith distance of the object ( e.g. filippenko 1982 ) .",
    "note that equation [ eq : angsep ] is only valid if the seeing and tracking error are zero .",
    "these two effects will reduce the measured @xmath50 .    for the  doublet ,",
    "a typical value for @xmath55 is only @xmath56 ( using atmospheric conditions typical of mauna kea , an absorption redshift @xmath57 and @xmath58 , which is typical of our sample , see m01b ) .",
    "this implies @xmath59 with @xmath60 per pixel and will mimic a shift in @xmath0 , @xmath61 .",
    "the sign of this correction is such that removing the stretching implied by equation [ eq : angsep ] from our data will result in a more negative @xmath16 .",
    "the correction is substantial for an individual system so we have applied it to the 5 affected systems to obtain an upper limit on the overall affect on @xmath16 .",
    "our weighted mean value of @xmath16 for the entire sample becomes @xmath62 .",
    "we have increased the precision of @xmath16 as measured with the ad method by at least a factor of 3.3 over that of vpi00 . the increase in precision ( and accuracy )",
    "is due to improved data quality ( higher spectral resolution and snr ) and greatly improved laboratory wavelength measurements ( griesmann & kling 2000 ) .    despite this increase in precision",
    ", the mm method can provide a further increase of up to an order of magnitude with similar quality data .",
    "the mm method was first proposed by dzuba , flambaum & webb ( 1999a , b ) and webb et al .",
    "( 1999 ) ( see also dzuba et al .",
    "it is based on equation [ eq : omega ] and the use of many transitions , from many different multiplets in different ions .",
    "the @xmath63 coefficients of transitions in heavy ( @xmath64 ) ions are typically an order of magnitude larger than those for light ions ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "depending on the nature of the ground and excited state wavefunctions , the @xmath63 coefficients for some transitions may also be of opposite sign , even for transitions of the same ion .",
    "therefore , the mm method has the following advantages over the ad method :    * the mm method allows us to probe an effect @xmath4210 times larger since we can compare total relativistic corrections ( not just the spin orbit coupling probed by the ad method ) . * in principle , all transitions appearing in the qso spectra may be used and so the number of constraints on @xmath16 is increased . * in practice , having a larger number of transitions leads to much better constraints on the velocity structure of the absorbing clouds .",
    "* comparison of transitions with positive and negative @xmath63 coefficients minimizes the systematic effects in section [ sec : systematics ] .",
    "webb et al . ( 1999 ) demonstrated the mm method and found tentative evidence for a smaller @xmath0 at redshifts @xmath66 : @xmath67 .",
    "we have extended that work in m01a and webb et al .",
    "2001 , analysing 21 high redshift dlas and re - analysing 28 lower redshift mg / fe systems from the webb et al .",
    "( 1999 ) data set .",
    "we confirmed the webb et al .",
    "result and found similar results for the dlas in murphy et al .",
    "( 2001a ) and webb et al .",
    "for the entire sample ( @xmath68 ) , @xmath69 .",
    "we analysed potential systematic errors in m01b and found that atmospheric dispersion effects and isotopic abundance variation may have led us to find a @xmath16 that was too positive ( i.e. once these two effects are removed from our data , we find a more negative @xmath16 ) .",
    "the results of m01a and m01b indicate possible variation in @xmath0 .",
    "even if these results are considered to be an upper limit on @xmath16 , they are by far the most restrictive limits at high redshift .",
    "our present result of @xmath1 is consistent with these results .",
    "we review constraints on @xmath16 at other redshifts in m01a .",
    "if the ad method were to be used to reach a similar precision as reached in m01a , a @xmath70 in @xmath4250 systems would be required . in section [ sec : systematics ] we found that systematic errors important for the ad method can correspond to @xmath71 which is of similar magnitude to the effect of systematic errors in the mm method ( m01b ) .",
    "therefore , once these systematic errors are understood and can be reliably removed from qso absorption data , the mm method is clearly the preferred method for probing @xmath16 at high redshift .    despite this ,",
    "a modest increase in precision could easily be achieved with our present data if the civ@xmath81548/1550 doublet laboratory wavelengths were known to high enough precision .",
    "griesmann & kling ( 2000 ) have increased the laboratory precision by an order of magnitude but the statistical uncertainty in the wavelengths is still @xmath72 .",
    "if the laboratory precision can be increased by another order of magnitude , the  and civ doublet can be analysed simultaneously to obtain tighter constraints on @xmath16 ( i.e. the mm method could be used ) .",
    "we are very grateful to tom bida and steven vogt who provided much detailed information about keck / hires and to ulf griesmann and rainer kling for conducting laboratory wavelength measurements specifically for the present work .",
    "we were also motivated by the superb laboratory measurements of , and many useful discussions with , juliet pickering and anne thorne .",
    "we thank bob carswell , fred chaffee and phil outram for providing their qso data , vladimir dzuba and walter johnson for calculation of the isotopic and hyperfine structure of the  doublet and alexander ivanchik for a useful communication .",
