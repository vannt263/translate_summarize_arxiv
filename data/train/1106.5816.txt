    "very recently , bulk heterojunction organic solar cells @xcite using conjugated polymers blended with other inorganic nanostructured materials have achieved a particularly refined level of process versatility , cost - effectiveness and high efficiency @xcite .",
    "furthermore this field has given the intriguing perception of a wide room available for further progresses .",
    "poly(3-hexylthiophene ) ( p3ht ) is an important photo - conductive polymer for photovoltaic applications .",
    "the reason is mainly because of its high drift mobility .",
    "furthermore flexible side alkyl chains improve greatly the solubility , promoting solution processibility and preserving @xmath0 electronic structure @xcite .",
    "for this reason , many efforts to maximize the efficiency of organic solar devices started from this polymer and aimed , on one side , to lower the semiconductor polymer band gap @xcite , on the other side , to improve crystallinity by thermal @xcite or solvent annealing treatments @xcite .",
    "it is well known that crystallization was able to considerably increase the photons harvesting and hole mobility in the polymer as demonstrated in standard drop cast or spin coated films .",
    "more recently , attempts to optimally match the nanometer - scale morphology resulting from novel growth techniques and the basic microscopic processes in the device @xcite have been proposed .",
    "advances in growth techniques of thin active films is a key issue to this progress for a twofold reason .",
    "on one side , looking forward to future applications , mainly to flexible substrates and in general for large scale implementations , novel deposition procedures have been proposed like inkjet @xcite or doctor blading @xcite , which are easily scalable to roll - to - roll production .",
    "in particular the spray coating @xcite is broadly employed to reduce the fluid waste to minimal amounts , while the combination of shadow masking and the control in the growth allows easy patterning and composite multilayered films fabrication to further improve efficiency . on the other side",
    ", the search for valid alternatives to the few active materials in use today , like the polythiophene - fullerene blends , suggests to try different paths in the device fabrication and to implements new processes .",
    "the present study was focussed on the electro - spray deposition ( esd ) technique @xcite in order to explore its potentiality in the growth of thin films with properties possibly at variance from those of the p3ht obtained from other well assessed techniques like spin - coating .",
    "in particular in recent works implementations of the electro - spray technique to the fabrication of photovoltaic bulk heterojunction devices were showed @xcite .",
    "intrinsic drawbacks of the esd technique like roughness and the thickness profile , should be carefully considered and discussed to comply with a successful device implementation . as recently discussed by wong and coworkers @xcite spray methods giving rise to highly rough films with lower charge carrier mobility ,",
    "can be safely cured after growth by post - solvent vapor annealing .    in the past , the esd technique was variously applied to several kinds of solutions of biomacromolecules and/or synthetic polymers under strong electric fields giving rise to nano - sized particles and fibers , which accumulated and adhered on a substrate in ambient conditions @xcite , as well as in ultra high vacuum @xcite .",
    "this transformation was brought about by the application of a high voltage to the capillary through which the liquid flowed .",
    "an important advantage of the technique @xcite , was the control that can be achieved on the particle size , ranging from the micron to the nano scales keeping an almost monodispersed distribution , affecting differently the final device properties .",
    "furthermore , the resulting particles isolated from the solvent were supposed to experience different aggregation mechanisms from those observed in presence of solvent ; such mechanisms could possibly be exploited to improve the efficiency of devices , and more importantly to widen the choice of possible blend components .",
    "for this reason , in this study we presented results from a low temperature boiling point solvent like chloroform , that will enhance the electro - spray peculiarity of reducing at the best the interaction of solvent and deposited films .",
    "another possible advantage of the present technique will be the contribution of the esd technique to fabricate devices with complex heterostuctures by using different materials and/or solvents , or differently aggregated phase of the same active material .",
    "typical examples are the optimized device architectures of a solar cell or of a field effect transistor , taking advantage of the anisotropy in mobility resulting from a different @xmath1 stacking arrangement . in general , sensors and other devices",
    "would receive a sizeable impulse from a supramolecular organization of the characteristic two - dimensional @xmath0 states system of conjugated polymers @xcite .    in brief , the present study will regard the peculiar physical properties of as - grown thin films obtained from the esd methods applied to p3ht - chloroform solution at various electric fields , solution concentrations and deposition rates , while postgrowth treatments or solvent choice effects will be the subject of future studies .",
    "microscopic investigations were performed by atomic force microscopy ( afm ) and grazing incidence x - ray diffraction ( gixrd ) , respectively for the morphology and the structure of the crystalline part of the polymer structure .",
    "the optical and electronic properties were investigated by means of optical absorption in the visible range and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy ( ups ) . finally , we observed the resulting conductivity obtained for such films by i - v curves at room temperature ( rt ) , including illumination conditions and its wavelength dependence by photoconductivity ( pc ) .",
    "thin p3ht films with thickness ranging between 100 and 200 nm , as measured by afm after scratching the samples , were obtained from chloroform solution of commercial electronic grade regioregular ( @xmath2 ) powders ( sigma ) , average molecular weight in excess to 50kd without further purification .",

    "the tip was centered to the pin - hole in the grounded skimmer with high accuracy .",
    "distance between tip and skimmer was 2 - 3 mm .",
    "when finely tuned @xmath4 gas over - pressurized the solution container , a controlled flow of solution could reach the spray tip , and electro - ionization occurred ( so called taylor cone ) .",
    "extracted from the grounded skimmer , the molecules were driven to the substrate using a differentially pumped system ( the first stage at 1 torr and the second stage at @xmath5 torr ) by a system of few millimeters diameter pin - holes one acting as a skimmer the other one before the sample holder .",
    "the sample holder allows heating during the growth or during post - growth annealing .",
    "the solution flow rate was measured by the time required to move a fixed amount of solution volume in the tube .",
    "it was found that the optimally applied positive voltage to the tip was in the range of 1 - 3kv , depending on the present design of the reaction chamber ( distance of tip from the grounded skimmer and the pumping system ) .",
    "below such a range , the solvent was not removed efficiently from the solution and the flux inside the tip tended to be blocked .",
    "furthermore , concentrated solution at low rate led to discontinuous flow with dark spots observed on the samples indicating polymer agglomeration . in the present study this effect was observed at 2 kv voltage and 1.3 @xmath6 rate in the case of 0.5 mg /ml solution .",
    "on the other hand , above a voltage of 3kv , carbonization effects in the films looking dark and dusty were identified by the help of photoemission .",
    "the films were deposited on several substrates , namely , corning glass , indium tin oxide ( ito ) and on pedot : pss / ito substrates at two different solution concentrations of 0.1mg / ml and 0.5 mg / ml , hereafter referred as type i and type ii samples respectively .",
    "after the preparation , thin films obtained from a fresh solution resulted to be stable if properly preserved in dark and controlled ambient temperature .",
    "the morphology of the p3ht films was analyzed by afm both in contact and non - contact mode .",
    "afm quantitative morphological analysis was performed using gwyddion software .",
    "absorption spectra were obtained by using a lock - in amplifier and an optical chopper .",

    "absorption measurements were carried out by measuring the normalized transmitted light intensity using a silicon pin detector .    grazing incidence x - ray diffraction ( gixrd )",
    "was collected by means of a d8 advance bruker diffractometer keeping fixed the incidence angle at @xmath7 during the detector scanning in the plane of incidence .",
    "ups spectra were acquired at pressure of @xmath8 torr using a he discharge lamp providing hei ( 21.2 ev ) and heii ( 40.8 ev ) lines impinging at @xmath9 with respect to the detection direction of a hemispherical electron analyzer vg - clam4 or by rotating the polar angle of a three axes sample manipulator .",
    "heii line allowed to collect spectra with reduced influence of the secondary electron emission .",
    "the photoconductive signal was measured over the load resistance of @xmath10 under an electric field of @xmath11 .",
    "the incoming light power was derived from the standard photoresponse of the silicon detector to normalize the photo - response spectra of the samples .",
    "finally , the electrical characterization was carried out in dark and illumination conditions ( ambient light ) by a keithley 617 electrometer , in the v / i mode , using aluminium stripes evaporated onto 7059 corning glass substrates after film deposition .",

    "neither scattering vector was parallel to the surface normal , nor its orientation remained constant during measurement , then contribution was made by lattice planes that made a non - zero angle with the substrate . in this manner , applying a very low angle of incidence the technique was more sensitive to crystallites with scattering vector whose angle was lower than @xmath18 ( direction of the surface normal ) .",

    "a clear diffraction intensity ( the ( 020 ) peak ) was observed at @xmath26 during low solution concentration/ low speed growth .",
    "the ( h00 ) peak was missing because the scattering vector of the ( 100 ) reflection was perpendicular to the substrate . using a more concentrated solution , a clear indication of a planar thiophene ring was obtained . in this latter case ,",
    "the diffraction of ( h00 ) orders was observed due to parallel arrangement of molecular layers spaced by alkyl chains , but the peak at about @xmath26 was also observed at higher flow rate ( fig.[gixrd]-e ) , maybe due to the increase in misorientation .",

    "in particular , the vibronic structure at 596 nm , and the feature due to conjugation length at 549 nm were enhanced with respect to type i samples .",

    "the spectral width of fig.[abs]-b ) increased indicating a sizeable amount of torsion and inhomogeneous conjugation in larger solution concentration and flow rate samples @xcite .",
    "in the work of park et al . @xcite the ordering transition ( with substantially the same effects seen here in the gixrd and optical absorption ) was associated with thermal annealing above the melting point of the film .",
    "we exclude that those effects could derive from temperature annealing experienced during the spray mainly because higher flow rates means a less exposure to the high electric field , and because recent experiments of annealed p3ht above the glass transition temperature , reported only an increment in the absorption with a preserved shape of the absorption spectrum @xcite .",

    "following a recent study by tao and coworkers @xcite , such a behavior might be a prove that in type i samples , alkyl chains shielded the photoemission from the thiophene rings by protruding towards the vacuum , indicating an edge - on geometry of the p3ht backbone . on the other side , unshielded photoemission from the flat and exposed @xmath0 system occurred in the case of type ii samples .    a second more quantitative evidence came from the angular study of the localized @xmath0 states at 3.8 ev be as a function of the grazing angle of incidence ( @xmath35 ) of the he ii photons , as reported in fig.[ups ] panel b ) .",

    "was found .",
    "features from 0.5 to 3.75 ev which are due to delocalized and localized cpz and spz states perpendicular to the polymer backbone were fitted with voigt functions after the subtraction of the linear background and properly normalized to avoid thickness effects .",
    "the intensities of the areas at different incidence angle @xmath38 were plotted against @xmath39 . a linear trend was observed in case of type ii esd films .",
    "the linear fit was used to extrapolate intensities at 0 and @xmath18 incidence , which were then used to calculate the figure - of - merit r = ( i(90 ) - i(0))/(i(90 ) + i(0 ) ) yielding a value of -0.15 .",
    "this indicated that high concentration esd film had a tendency to form a major face - on configuration , while a purely face - on structure gave a value of -1 @xcite .",
    "however , the linear trend was not observed in case of low concentration esd films , with a minimum at @xmath40 , an indication that the film structure was showing a mixed configuration without either face - on or edge - on dominant phases but quite far from having an isotropic configuration that would have led to a constant contribution .",
    "similar mixed population was found by x - ray absorption in a recent work by delongchamp and coworkers @xcite and put in relation to the presence of tilted section of polymer chains @xcite .",
    "the transport properties were studied by planar and sandwiched geometries .",

    "[ diode ]    as it can be seen a clear diode - like behavior in the type ii samples ( fig.[diode ] panel b ) was found , while a less rectifying behavior was observed in fig.[diode ] panel a ) , for the type i samples .",
    "probably the reason for the latter one was the lower shunt resistance @xcite because of the peculiar morphology and/or because of the high series resistance .",
    "a complementary information came from the planar conductivity in a different structure with in - plane electrodes . at high electric fields of the order of @xmath41 ,",

    "the structure of a p3ht films consists of a crystalline packaging of main conjugated polymer chains well oriented along the @xmath0 stacking direction . in such systems",
    "the formation of tilted or rotated structures has been found to reduce the total energy of about 0.4 ev / monomer @xcite , at the expense of the crystalline mobility by increasing the effective electron mass .",
    "in fact , high in - plane mobility in p3ht films was reached in `` edge - on '' conformations of the polymer chains with thiophene rings perpendicular with respect to the substrate @xcite . such a conductivity",
    "was found about three orders of magnitude larger than the conductivity in films with `` flat - on '' oriented chains .",
    "the difference was given by the hopping through @xmath30 orbitals along the stacking direction oriented towards the conduction channel .",
    "this was the condition obtained in the case of low molecular weight polymer films grown by casting or in some cases by spin coating .",
    "actually , if the regioregularity was reduced and/or the molecular weight increased , a flat - on growth was obtained with reduced crystallinity . nevertheless a general loss of crystallinity is not always detrimental to the overall conductivity .",
    "in fact , a better connectivity is obtained by means of enhanced conjugation length and the complexity of the structure overcomes the limitation posed by the grain boundaries @xcite responsibles of the poor overall conductivity in low molecular weight p3ht fibrils .    in the present work we found that the electro - spray growth is regulated by both the solution concentration and",
    "the flow rate indicating that the electric field applied to each molecule is an important parameter for the growth , able to tune the final characteristics of the film .    by the present study we found that the samples grown by a lower concentration solution and lower rates showed clear indications of different conformation from samples obtained by more concentrated solutions and larger flow rates .",
    "these two cases represent the two extremes of the highest and lowest electric field perturbation that can be applied to the solute , within the range of operation of the present tool , depending largely on the mechanical design and the pumping system .",
    "while at lower concentration solution we evidenced a non - planar orientation or edge - on ring conformation , at higher concentration the self - assembly of the molecules was pointing to a more planar orientation with a more isotropic continuous growth mode character .",
    "in fact , when the solution was less concentrated , self - assembly could be initiated by a stronger electric field experienced by the polymer with possible effects on the polymers alignement and conjugation length .    on the contrary when the flow speed was increased and the solution more concentrated the effect of the ionization induced by the field was reduced accordingly , and molecules interacted giving rise more rapidly to packaged films .",
    "several observations supporting this view were presented in all the reported experimental characterizations like the morphology dependence seen by afm or the orientation of the crystalline planes observed by gixrd .",
    "similarly , the peculiar behavior of the optical absorption with enhanced vibronic features @xcite , in the case of high concentration solutions and high flow rate samples , or the angular anisotropy of the localized valence band @xmath0 states are supporting this view .    in the conductivity measured in `` sandwich '' configuration , perpendicular transport through the @xmath0 stacking orientation",
    "was observed with a schottky barrier characteristics in high concentration and flow rate solution samples .",
    "in planar structures , conductivity measurements showed again the predominance of the higher solution concentration samples in spite of the unfavored packaging direction of the @xmath0 stacking , probably because of the longer conjugation length and of the reduced crystalline grain boundaries of a more isotropic and continuous film . nevertheless a more intense photoconductivity effect was observed for low concentration solution films , indicating that of a more efficient photoabsorption was occurring because of the mutual orientation of the molecular orbitals and the incident electric field .    in conclusion , we showed a way to vary efficiently the properties of self - assembling of a conductive polymer by finely tuning the speed of the growth and the solution concentration during electro - spray deposition of conductive polymers .",
    "in fact , we observed a rapid transition from a prevalent edge - on building block of the polymer to a flat - on configuration .",
    "this fact could in some way remind the well known behavior of low / high regio - regular assembling of spin coated or drop casting samples reported by sirringhaus and coworkers @xcite , but in this case such a trend was obtained from the same organic material .",
    "theoretical study of the atomistic process is now necessary to understand how the details of the self - assembling are influenced by the various parameters ."
