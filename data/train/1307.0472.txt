    "the cumulative history of metal enrichment in disk - dominated galaxies can be gleaned from the abundances of @xmath5 elements of their ionized nebulae and young stars .",
    "tactically , ionized nebulae are particularly advantageous since their lines of the lighter @xmath5 elements ( notably oxygen , neon , argon , and sulfur ) elements are luminous over a wide range of @xmath5-element abundances ( up to 10% of the central star s total luminosity ) and their emission - line fluxes are concentrated in narrow lines .",
    "absorption lines of b - type stars and cepheids can also be used to estimate @xmath5-element abundances and their radial gradients in nearby spirals , though the observations are more challenging , especially when the metal abundances are small .    until recently most studies of the @xmath5 elements and their spatial distributions have been confined to the milky way . see @xcite and kwitter & henry ( 2012 , `` kh12 '' ) for a detailed review of the elemental abundances and their gradients measured in the milky way and its companion galaxies .",
    "however , the milky way presents several practical challenges .",
    "interstellar absorption and extinction limit the spatial range and spectral coverage of such studies to a few kpc near the sun ( except towards the galactic anticenter ) .",
    "moreover , distances  and hence the galactic locations  of many nebulae are poorly determined .    for these reasons",
    "most recent studies of the distributions of the @xmath5-element abundances have focused on nearby galaxies , with emphasis on those in the local group .",
    "although the emission - line luminosities of h  ii regions are much larger then those in planetary nebulae ( `` pne '' ) , compact pne offer several important strategic and tactical advantages for studies of metal enrichment in galaxies out to distances of @xmath6 mpc : ( 1 ) unlike h  ii regions and early - type stars pne can be found in all types of galaxies and stellar environments ; ( 2 ) pne can be traced to much larger radii than h  ii regions in disk - dominated galaxies ; ( 3 ) pne are not constrained to spiral arms where local and foreground extinction hinder observations of important ultraviolet lines ; and ( 4 ) the surface brightnesses of the most luminous pne are far higher than those of h  ii regions , which enables flux - limited observations of faint emission lines using the small entrance apertures generally needed for spectroscopy .",
    "most nebular emission - line studies use o / h as a proxy for the @xmath5 elements in the ism since like other light @xmath5 elements , oxygen is not altered by the central stars of h  ii regions and pne .",
    "thus the observed @xmath5-element abundances characterize the ism from which the stars formed . in practice ,",
    "the o / h ratio is the best determined of the light @xmath5 elements owing to its prominent lines of o@xmath7 and o@xmath8 as well as to the reliability of measuring the nebular temperature and correcting for unseen higher ionization states .",
    "observations of pne allow the radial distribution of o / h to be traced throughout large galaxies , including their innermost and outermost regions ( bulges and halos ) where star formation has long ceased .",

    "all of these galaxies show a systematically negative slope of the radial o / h gradient .",
    "this is expected since oxygen enrichment is much stronger in the inner spiral - arm - dominated regions of disks where massive stars have been forming and expelling light @xmath5 elements at the ends of their brief lives .    until recently systematic studies of the o / h distribution of m31 were based on spectroscopy of its prominent h  ii regions .",

    "1a shows , the luminous pne inside the 40-kpc ellipse have disk - like angular distribution .",
    "that strongly suggests a direct association of these pne with the disk .",
    "moreover , taken as a group , the set of 16 pne studied initially shares the same kinematic patterns ( and statistical deviations ) as nearby disk stars ( @xcite , fig .  5 and @xcite , fig .",

    "such large scatter is characteristic of the thick disk of m31 @xcite and the disks of spiral galaxies that have been disrupted by impacts with smaller galaxies @xcite .",
    "this all but eliminates the hypothesis that most of all of the sixteen pne are or have been members of the metal - poor and kinematically inhomogeneous halo .",
    "thus we now explore whether m174 and m2496 are members of the same dynamical group as the other luminous pne within the r@xmath3 = 40 kpc ellipse of fig .",
    "obviously their locations reveal little about their membership since m174 and m2496 were selected to lie along the minor axis .",
    "the heliocentric doppler motions of m174 and m2496 are -209 and -324 km s@xmath18 , respectively .",
    "these differ somewhat from those expected of ideal disk members in circular orbits ( @xmath29 km s@xmath18)but not by more than the other 16 pne . although the spatial and kinematic evidence is inconclusive , the uniformly unusual metallicities of all 18 pne allow us to presume that m174 , m2496 , and the remaining sixteen pne are a physical group that might share a common history .",
    "thus we place both pne in the extended disk of m31 ( section 1 ) at deprojected distances r@xmath30 kpc from its center ( table  1 ) .    to further explore possible pn  stellar - population membership we exploit the abundance studies of rbg stars in the same general vicinity as the ensemble of pne by chapman et al .",

    "in other words , pne in ngc  300 are enhancing their oxygen , in contradiction to many common models of nucleosynthesis ( next section ) and the studies of m31 , m81 , and the milky way cited in  1 .",
    "the science goal of this section is to uncover  or at least to illuminate  the origins of the highly enriched pne in this study .",
    "there are some hard constraints : the anomalously high o / h ratio and flat radial gradient of all eighteen pne in m31 suggests that an that a common explanation of their solar - like o / h abundances is necessary .",
    "moreover , we seek an explanation of the abundance pattern of pne of our m31 ensemble that is not characteristic of other spiral galaxies whose radial o / h abundance gradient is steeper .",
    "thus we seek a scenario that connects our results to a particular history for m31 s outer regions .",
    "in particular , we are looking for some sort of a ongoing mechanism that transports the metal - rich stars or ism in the inner disk into the outer extended disk after nuclear burning processes had a chance to enrich the metals .",
    "this may take the form of an event that deposited stars or gas with @xmath5 elements with approximately solar abundances in the other disk .",
    "it is instructive to identify and eliminate some common enrichment scenarios that do nt seem to apply to m31 .",
    "for example , we have just seen that not only the pne , but also many nearby rgb stars share similar metallicities , so it seems unlikely that pne in m31 have undergone self - enrichment of oxygen .",
    "in addition , the process of radial migration ( @xcite ) has been suggested as a means to transport stars and gas radially outward from inner metal - rich parts of the disk . however , migration acts gradually and only where the gravitational perturbations of the arms are prominent .",
    "this mechanism is nt likely to account for the flat o / h gradient or patchy groups of metal - rich stars found far beyond the inner disk .",
    "moreover , @xcite found that the migration hypothesis was inapplicable to the pne in the disk galaxy ngc  300 .",
    "finally , the process is incapable of producing the positive [ fe / h ] gradient observed in the disk component of rgb stars studied by ch06 .",
    "further , radial migration is likely to operate similarly in all comparable spirals ( esp .",
    "m33 and m81 in which the spiral arms are more prominent than in m31 ) , contrary to the differences of o / h gradients in other spirals noted in section 4 .",
    "local ism enrichment by core - collapse supernovae is implausible and never observed in the outer parts of large spiral galaxies . a gaseous transport process known as the `` fountain effect '' can redistribute enriched disk gas using the momentum of supernova blast waves as a transport mechanism .",
    "however , @xcite concluded that fountains in the inner disk of m31 could only mix gas locally ( @xmath231 kpc ) .",
    "metal - rich stars and gas can be transported outward by external mechanisms ; to wit , galaxy - galaxy encounters .",
    "the outer regions of m31 are marbled with stellar streams and other structures that are generally assumed to be the result of numerous past encounters with dwarf galaxies .",
    "the `` splashes '' following their impacts can also disrupt the ambient ism of the inner disk @xcite .",
    "however , random bombardments by dwarf galaxies only eject and disperse small amounts of ism to high galactic latitudes  like stones thrown in a lake . even many encounters with dwarf galaxies are not likely to account for the high metal content of all of the pne in the ensemble or the many metal - rich stars far from the inner disk .",
    "so we seek some sort of rare , major , recognizable and probably fairly recent event that led to a major disruption of the ambient metal - enhanced gas and the possibly the stars in the inner disk .",
    "we now review the evidence  of which there is a growing body  for an encounter between m31 and a gas - rich galaxy that triggered a starburst from which the ensemble of pne in this paper evolved .",
    "our aim is to find a `` smoking gun '' : an event identified by its age and degree of disruption of both galaxies involved in the encounter .",
    "this can be inferred from a plausible model of the interaction combined with estimates of the ages of the pne and the metal - rich stars .",
    "@xcite modeled the plausible consequences of a future collision of m31 and the milky way .",
    "they stated :  eventually , after the merger has completed , the sun is most likely to be scattered to the outer halo and reside at much larger radii ( @xmath36 kpc ) \" .",
    "similarly the formation of a starburst in m31 that could lead to the production of a generation of metal - rich group of pne might have resulted from a comparable encounter with another large galaxy in the past .",
    "the obvious candidate is the spiral galaxy m33 presently located about 14@xmath37 ( @xmath38 kpc ) southeast of m31 .",

    "( 2009 , `` mc09 '' ) obtained very deep tiled images of a 220 square degrees in an extended field containing both m31 and m33 as well as a three - color image overlay around m31 .",
    "they found a bridge of rgb stars that includes a prominent stellar stream joining the two galaxies . in an m31m33 analogue of cox & loeb s models",
    ", mc09 ran a `` soft - particle hydrodynamical '' model ( `` sph '' ) which demonstrated that an encounter of m31 and m33 about 2.6 gy ago ( pericenter @xmath39 kpc ) could account for the morphologies of the warp in the inner disk of m31 and some of its stellar streams ( the sph simulations do not track the ejected gas or the origins of starbursts ) .",
    "the model of the interaction shows that stars from the disk can be disrupted to the outer regions of m31 that were discussed in  4 .",
    "@xcite and @xcite have found a corresponding bridge of h  i that spatially and kinematically connects m31 and m33 .",
    "the ages of stellar populations can be untangled from high - quality cmds .",
    "@xcite interpreted existing cmds from the literature and the morphologies of stellar streams outside of m31 s extended disk to suggest similarly , that a merger with a 3:1 mass ratio at a pericenter of 25 kpc unfolded between 5.5 and 9 gy ago .",
    "the predominant ages of metal - rich stars ( [ fe / h ] @xmath40 ) , in the outer disk found by @xcite , 5  8 gy , serve as evidence of a post - encounter starburst .",
    "@xcite argue that stars in the field ec1 on the northwest side of m31 ( near many of the pne in our sample ) were stripped from the progenitor galaxy of the giant stream that extends 50% of the way to m33 .",
    "their relatively low values of [ fe / h ] ( -0.8 ) suggest that these stars migrated from an old stellar population the outer disk , possibly during an encounter .",
    "more recently , bfb12 found that a high - quality cmd of a field at the outer edge of the disk in m33 ( originally published by @xcite ) contains a metal - rich , @xmath232 gy - old stellar population  much the same as that found from their deep cmd in their warp field of m31 .",
    "these unusual findings are best explained by a common origin ",
    "the m31m33 encounter modeled by mc09and establish that the starburst occurred from a highly metal - enriched ism .",
    "the recent m31m33 encounter scenario is also corroborated indirectly .",
    "on the observational side , even though the h - band flux of m33 is 15 times fainter than that of m31 ( ned ) , m33 has a current global rate of star formation that is 4.6 times higher @xcite .",
    "this supports the notion that a massive starburst in m33 has been triggered by a recent global disruption .",
    "also , @xcite found that the stellar population of m33 shows that the [ fe / h ] gradient flattens abruptly beyond the spiral arms ( r@xmath41 9 kpc ) .",
    "this is an expected outcome of the numerical model of the m31m33 encounter by mc09 .",
    "h  ii regions of other disrupted disk galaxies have been found to show a pattern of flat o / h gradients . @xcite",
    "measured the o / h ratios of h  ii regions throughout 13 galaxies from the `` rogues h  i survey . ''",
    "the target galaxies were selected for their unusually extended h  i disks and/or peculiar h  i features indicative of recent galaxy encounters @xcite .",
    "werk et al .",
    "found that the h  ii regions in the rogues sample show emission - line spectra indicating higher - than - expected o / h at large r@xmath3 .",
    "they suggested that the ionizing stars formed from metal - rich material that was transported to larger galactic radii by the encounter that disturbed the h  i out to the regions where the present h  ii regions formed .",
    "although they employed somewhat unreliable `` strong - line '' methods for deriving the absolute value of o / h ( ) , the finding of a flat o / h gradient in their target galaxies is almost certainly a secure conclusion since it is based on a single methodology .",
    "however , as shown by @xcite , the application of various strong - line methods to the same set of data yields disparate results for o / h . accordingly , and in light of the considerable scatter in the o / h values for h  ii regions compiled in fig .",
    "1b for m31 , we have not performed a comparative analysis of the o / h abundance measurements between pne and h  ii regions .",
    "the next question is whether the ages of pne connect their progenitor stars to either of the encounter events @xmath42 or @xmath43 gy in the past .",
    "the method for estimating the ages of the progenitors was described in paper  i. in summary , it relies on stellar evolution models that predict the evolving ultraviolet luminosities and stellar temperatures of post agb stars that shed and later ionize the nebular gas .",
    "models by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ( and others ) predict the evolving agb mass yields as a function of the initial mass of the progenitor star .",
    "other models such as those of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite predict the evolving properties and related observables of the nebula .",
    "these observables can used to locate the central stars of pne on an h ",
    "r diagram and , hence , to determine their initial masses and ages from evolutionary tracks .    following this procedure",
    "we find that the characteristic initial masses of the central stars are on the order of 1.5 m@xmath44 and their corresponding evolutionary ages are @xmath45 gy .",
    "this is the same age derived by other authors who selected their targets from the pne with highest l@xmath46}$ ] , including mag09 , stang10 , and stas13 .",
    "the ages of these pne are sufficiently short that their @xmath5-element abundances must be very close to those of the current ism .    therefore , taken at face value ,",
    "associating the ensemble of pne with the m31m33 encounter of 2.6 gy ago ( mc09 ) and post - encounter metal - rich starburst of 2 gy ago ( bfb12 ) is straightforward .",
    "although the evidence , such as it is , is largely circumstantial , the puzzle pieces fit without mishap .",
    "if the @xmath4-gy ages of the pne are appropriately estimated then the ensemble of pne can not be attributed to any earlier starburst in m31 .",
    "the veracity of this or any other pn age estimate method can be challenged owing to the universality of the bright - end cutoff of the pnlf .",
    "specifically , the form of the pnlf has been found to be independent of the size and stellar content of the underlying galaxy , including some early - type galaxies in which star formation has been dormant for cosmic time scales .",
    "( see @xcite and @xcite for a much deeper discussion of the challenges this poses to current understanding of stellar evolution . ) in other words , pne selected for their high [ oiii ] luminosities , such as those in this study , have indeterminate ages .",
    "while their o / h enrichment might be explainable by metal - enriched gas transported to the outer disk by a past encounter , their formation can not be directly tied to any particular event .    despite their common abundances and kinematics",
    ", this age indeterminacy may well apply to pne in m31 .",
    "m06 found that the radial distribution of pne follows the distribution of r - band light out to a radius of 2@xmath37 along m31 s major axis ( 6 disk scale lengths = 0.9 r@xmath13 ) .",
    "this and the similarity of r , i , j , and k surface brightnesses along m31 s major axis ( cour11 ) suggest that pne are associated with a very old stellar population of m31 .",
    "m06 also found that the shape of the pnlf was invariant with deprojected disk radius , r@xmath3 , within their densely sampled zones along the entire major axis of the inner disk of m31 .",
    "while the present sample of pne mostly lie beyond this radius , and while their numbers are too small to check the shape of the pnlf , we have no reason to argue that the pnlf of the outer disk of m31 is anything but ordinary .    until the enigma of the universal pnlf is resolved",
    " that is , why otherwise successful theories of agb and post - agb evolution can not be used to predict the progenitor mass  we can only conclude that all eighteen o - rich pne in m31 seem to have had a common origin , and one that is most likely the result of a past starburst event within a metal - rich environment .",

    "the spectra of both m174 and m2496 show broad emission features that can be attributed to central stars of wolf - rayet ( wr ) type ( fig .",

    "the line ratios and fwhm , shown in table  b1 , indicate that both stars are type [ wc4 ] according to the scheme of @xcite .",
    "this type corresponds to stellar temperature between 50,000 k and 90,000 k , consistent with the modeled values around 70,000 k.    pn2496 , only 0.2 mag from the bright cutoff of the m31 [ o  iii ] pnlf , is one of the brightest pne in m31 ( m06 ) .",
    "pn174 is also bright in [ o  iii ] , 0.7 mag from the cutoff . in this respect , finding that their central stars are of wr type comes as a surprise .",
    "according to the most recent attempts to model the pnlf @xcite , pne with he burning central stars are not expected at its bright end .",
    "this conclusion is based on the limited information available for he burners [ e.g. @xcite ] , according to which these central stars are less luminous than hydrogen - burning models when they reach high temperatures , and evolve more slowly , thereby favoring the development of optically thin ( i.e. less luminous ) nebulae .",
    "our detection of wr features indicates that , on the contrary , he burners also manage to have a combined stellar and nebular evolution so as to reach the large [ o  iii ] luminosities near the pnlf cutoff .",
    "it is unlikely that a very late thermal pulse ( vltp ) is at the origin of the wr nature of the central stars of pn174 and pn2496 , as the nebulae have high density , i.e. , are presumably young , and are hydrogen - rich .",
    "a final thermal pulse when the progenitor is about to leave the agb ( aftp ) , or a late thermal pulse ( ltp ) early in the post - agb track , is favored instead .",
    "these pne are not the first in m31 in which wc lines have been observed .",
    "@xcite found typical wc6 emission lines in their pn fjchp 57 .",
    "although this pn is located near the edge of the m31 s disk , its discordant doppler shift suggests it is a member of the halo .",
    "@xcite also found that pn039 in m33 shows wc stellar lines .",
    "note that @xcite found that pne with wr central stars are among the brightest ones in the galactic bulge , and so are some wr pne in the large magellanic cloud [ see e.g. , @xcite ] . together with pn174 and pn2496 in m31 , the occurrence of pne with wr - type central stars in the most luminous pne suggests that the general evolution of he burners and their nebulae are not yet adequately understood .",
