    "lamno@xmath0 is the progenitor of a family of manganese oxides that exhibit a multitude of electronic phases and unusual electronic properties such as  colossal \" magnetoresistance .",
    "the compound crystallizes in the orthorhombically distorted perovskite structure ( space group @xmath18 ) , in which every mn ion ( with valence state 3 + and high - spin configuration @xmath19 ) is surrounded by an octahedron of six oxygen ligands .",
    "it is well recognized that a strong jahn - teller ( jt ) instability of the singly occupied @xmath15 orbitals ( @xmath20 and @xmath21 ) gives rise to cooperative distortions of the oxygen octahedra , which induce orbital ordering at @xmath22 k @xcite and may be responsible for the insulating behavior of lamno@xmath0.@xcite below @xmath23 k , the mn spins exhibit @xmath8-type antiferromagnetic order ( _ i.e. _ , ferromagnetic layers in the @xmath24 plane of the orthorhombic lattice , which are antiferromagnetically stacked along the @xmath4-axis ) .",
    "in addition to the jt interactions , the phase behavior of lamno@xmath0 is determined by superexchange ( se ) interactions , which are mediated by @xmath25 charge excitations along a bond @xmath26 between mn@xmath27 ions and involve both spin and orbital degrees of freedom .",
    "@xcite while the magnetic order is stabilized by superexchange , the origin of orbital order in lamno@xmath0 is a more subtle issue .",
    "currently , one of the most intriguing questions in the field of orbital physics of manganites is the role of superexchange interactions ( whose magnitude is determined by the on - site coulomb repulsion @xmath28 of the mn @xmath29 electrons ) in the onset of the orbital order and their interplay with the jt electron - phonon interactions .",
    "@xcite depending on the value of @xmath28 , the insulating gap is either of charge - transfer ( ct ) type ( _ i.e. _ , the chemical potential is between the o @xmath12 band and the mn @xmath15 band ) , or of mott - hubbard type ( _ i.e. _ , the chemical potential is in a gap within the mn @xmath15 manifold generated by electron - electron and jt electron - phonon interactions).@xcite the corresponding optical transitions across the gap are then either @xmath30 or @xmath17 transitions .",
    "a comprehensive description of the nature of the insulating gap and the low - energy optical excitations in lamno@xmath0 @xcite is important as a starting point for models of the unconventional phenomena that develop under hole doping , such as colossal magnetoresistance.@xcite    orbital and magnetic ordering phenomena in transition metal oxides are associated with the emergence of anisotropy in the orbital and spin degrees of freedom , and can induce pronounced rearrangements of the optical spectral weight ( sw ) near the critical temperatures .",
    "@xcite therefore the polarization and temperature dependencies of the optical sw can be instrumental in elucidating the nature of the mechanisms underlying these phenomena.@xcite the optical sw of the intersite @xmath17 transitions , which is determined by se interactions , is very sensitive to the temperature - dependent spin correlations , because the spin alignment controls the transfer of electrons between neighboring mn sites via the pauli principle .",
    "these transitions can thus be singled out by monitoring the evolution of the optical response through the onset of the magnetic order .",
    "in contrast to the intersite @xmath17 transitions , the @xmath30 transitions and the on - site @xmath17 transitions should not be affected by the correlations between neighboring mn spins .",
    "the main body of the optical data for insulating lamno@xmath31 has been obtained from reflectivity measurements on twinned single crystals .",
    "contrary to theoretical predictions,@xcite critical sw shifts at the nel temperature were not clearly resolved in these experiments .",
    "@xcite    following up on a short report,@xcite we present here the results of a comprehensive set of spectral ellipsometry experiments in which the complex dielectric function of a nearly stoichiometric , untwinned lamno@xmath31 crystal in the spectral range 1.25.6 ev was accurately monitored as a function of temperature in the range 20 k @xmath2 300  k. the dielectric response , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , along the @xmath3 and @xmath4 axes ( _ i.e. _ , along and perpendicular to the ferromagnetic @xmath24 plane ) was found to be highly anisotropic , confirming thereby that our crystal is detwinned to a substantial degree .",
    "in addition to the anisotropic temperature dependence of the lowest - energy optical band at @xmath16 2 ev,@xcite strongly temperature dependent optical bands are also observed in the range @xmath16 45 ev , appearing on a broad background due to the strongly dipole - allowed o @xmath12 ",
    "mn @xmath13 transition at the @xmath30 charge - transfer energy @xmath32 @xmath33 4.7 ev . based on a marked redistribution of",
    "the optical sw observed below the nel temperature , these bands can be assigned to intersite @xmath14 transitions .",
    "inspection of the spin - dependent selection rules in the magnetically ordered state then yields an assignment of the low- and high - energy @xmath17 bands to transitions into the high - spin ( hs , @xmath34 ) and low - spin ( ls , @xmath35 ) configurations of the mn@xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) ion , respectively . a self - consistent dispersion analysis of the complex dielectric function enables a reliable separation of the temperature - dependent low- and high - energy counterparts and an estimation their optical sws .",
    "we also report a detailed quantitative analysis , based on an effective superexchange model , of the optical sw transfer between the hs and ls optical bands induced by antiferromagnetic spin correlations . from the anisotropic temperature behavior of the low - energy hs optical band we estimate the effective  orbital angle \" of @xmath15 orbitals resulting from the lattice driven jt effect and the spin - orbital se interactions .",
    "the value of the orbital angle , @xmath38 , established independently in a prior structural study @xcite is within the limits of our estimate in the framework of the effective superexchange model in the present study .",
    "this strongly supports our assignment of the lowest - energy band around 2 ev to the hs intersite @xmath17 transition .",
    "we also analyze the multiplet structure of the ls intersite @xmath17 transitions and find a consistent interpretation of the optical spectra using their assignments .",
    "our analysis implies that lamno@xmath0 is in the regime of a mott - hubbard rather than ct insulator according to the original classification of zaanen , sawatzky and allen.@xcite    the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we present details of the experimental studies and sample preparation in sec .",
    "ii . in sec . iii a we describe the analysis of the ellipsometry data and present the optical sws obtained from the dispersion analysis for the two nonequivalent crystallographic directions .",
    "the observed anisotropy and temperature dependence of the optical sws are interpreted using the superexchange model in sec .",
    "iii b. implications for the se parameters in the context of prior neutron scattering data are discussed in sec .",
    "iii c. sec .",
    "iv contains a summary of the main conclusion and a discussion of some open questions .",
    "single crystals of lamno@xmath0 were grown by the crucible - free floating zone method using an image furnace equipped with an arc - lamp @xcite and a four - mirror type image furnace ( csi , japan ) equipped with halogen lamps .",
    "the as - grown crystals were characterized by energy dispersive x - ray analysis , x - ray diffraction , and magnetic susceptibility measurements .",
    "the as - grown lamno@xmath0 single crystals are phase - pure and exhibit the orthorhombic @xmath5 structure at room temperature .    in the @xmath5 structure",
    ", the @xmath4-axis direction can be associated with any of the @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 directions of the high - temperature pseudocubic perovskite @xmath42 phase . provided the @xmath43 and @xmath3 axes",
    "are arbitrarily chosen in the diagonal directions of the perpendicular plane ( see fig .",
    "1(a ) ) , up to six types of orientational domains can exist below the orbital ordering temperature , t@xmath44 @xmath45 780 k. therefore , as - grown single crystals of lamno@xmath0 always exhibit heavily twinned domain structures . the particular pattern and the sizes of the domains depend on local temperature gradients and mechanical stresses during the growth procedure .",
    "we were able to remove the twins in the essential volume fraction of our sample following the procedure described below .",
    "the as - grown single crystal,@xcite with the orthorhombic @xmath4 axis coaxial with the axis of growth , was first aligned using x - ray laue patterns , assuming tentatively the cubic perovskite structure .",
    "then , a slice of thickness @xmath10 mm was cut parallel to the plane formed by the orthorhombic @xmath4 axis and the cubic @xmath46 direction . from this slice we cut out our sample with dimensions @xmath47 3 mm@xmath48 .",
    "removal of the twins was carried out by heating the sample above t@xmath44 @xmath45 780 k under normal atmosphere conditions , without applying external stress , and subsequent cooling down to room temperature .",
    "the domain pattern was visually controlled @xmath49 by using a high - temperature optical microscope with crossed optical polarizers . the room temperature polarized optical image of a part of the crystal of 200 @xmath50 length showed initially heavily twinned structure of the lamno@xmath0 sample ( with an average domain width of 5 @xmath51 m ) , where four types of different contrasts could be distinguishable ( see fig .",
    "1(c ) ) . on heating the sample",
    "the polarized optical images showed decreased color contrast , and close to the temperature of t@xmath44 , most of the crystal surface acquired a bright uniform color , and the twinned structure suddenly disappeared .",
    "subsequent cooling down to room temperature was carried out under @xmath49 control , with manually optimized parameters . a polarized image of the same part of the crystal after cooling down to room temperature",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "one can notice that the fine domain structure still persisted in the sample .",
    "the orthorhombic @xmath43 direction was identified perpendicular to the crystal surface by single - crystal x - ray diffraction analysis .",
    "this analysis also confirmed that the crystal was essentially detwinned : at some points of the crystal surface the percentage of detwinning was as high as 95 % ( as follows from the laue diagram shown in fig .",
    "1(b ) ) , and over the entire surface it was not worse than 80 % .",
    "the sample was further characterized by magnetometry , using a superconducting quantum interference device .",
    "we determine the antiferromagnetic transition temperature at t@xmath52 @xmath33 139.6 k , which is characteristic for a nearly oxygen - stoichiometric lamno@xmath0 crystal .",
    "the technique of ellipsometry provides significant advantages over conventional reflection methods in that ( i ) it is self - normalizing and does not require reference measurements and ( ii ) @xmath53 and @xmath54 are obtained directly without a kramers - kronig transformation .",
    "the measurements in the frequency range of 4000 - 48000 @xmath55 ( 0.5 - 6.0 ev ) were performed with a home - built ellipsometer of rotating - analyzer type,@xcite where the angle of incidence is 70.0@xmath56 . for optical measurements",
    "the surfaces were polished to optical grade .",
    "the sample was mounted on the cold finger of a helium flow uhv cryostat in which the temperature could be varied between 10 and 300 k. to avoid contamination of the sample surface with ice , we evacuated the cryostat to a base pressure of about @xmath57 torr at room temperature . with only a single angle of incidence ,",
    "the raw experimental data are represented by real values of the ellipsometric angles , @xmath58 and @xmath32 , for any wave number .",
    "these values are defined through the complex fresnel reflection coefficients for light polarized parallel ( @xmath59 ) and perpendicular ( @xmath60 ) to the plane of incidence @xmath61 to determine the complex dielectric response @xmath62 and @xmath63 of the lamno@xmath0 crystal , we have measured ellipsometric spectra with @xmath3 or @xmath4 axes aligned perpendicular to the plane of incidence of the light , respectively . in the following , we present the complex dielectric response",
    "@xmath64 extracted from the raw ellipsometry spectra , @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "figures 2 and 3 show temperature dependencies of the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric function , @xmath67 = @xmath68 , in @xmath3-axis and @xmath4-axis polarization , respectively , extracted from our ellipsometric data .",
    "one can notice strong anisotropy in the complex dielectric function spectra , @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "the anisotropy in the optical spectra appears in the orbitally - ordered state below t@xmath44 @xmath33 780 k.@xcite the strong optical anisotropy of our spectra thus confirms that our crystal has been detwinned to a substantial degree .    from figs . 2 and 3",
    "one can see that the spectra @xmath71 and @xmath72 are dominated by two broad optical bands : at low energies around 2 ev and at high energies around 5 ev . superimposed",
    "are a number of smaller spectral features .",
    "in particular , one can clearly see in the room temperature @xmath71 spectrum that the low - energy optical band consists of three distinct bands that are reliably resolved owing to the accuracy of the ellipsometric data . at room temperature ,",
    "the anisotropy is most pronounced in the low - energy optical band around 2 ev .",
    "this band is noticeably suppressed in @xmath4-axis polarization . with decreasing temperature , the anisotropy between @xmath69 and @xmath70 increases and becomes strongly enhanced below @xmath73 140 k.    figures 4 and 5 display the evolution of the difference between the low - temperature complex dielectric function spectra measured at 20 k and the corresponding @xmath74-dependent spectra , @xmath75 , in the @xmath3-axis and @xmath4-axis polarization , respectively . in accordance with the earlier optical study on a detwinned lamno@xmath0 crystal by tobe",
    "et al._,@xcite these data clearly demonstrate opposite trends in the temperature behavior of the low - energy optical band around 2 ev in the @xmath3-axis and @xmath4-axis polarization .",
    "however , our present ellipsometry study in an extended spectral range up to 6 ev shows that there are obvious counterparts for the low - energy changes in the @xmath3-axis and @xmath4-axis polarization , appearing at higher energies .",
    "further , by using a classical dispersion analysis of the @xmath74-dependent dielectric function spectra , we determine more accurately which optical bands are involved in the process of the spectral redistribution .      analyzing the data shown in figs . 4 and 5 , we estimate the associated sw changes , @xmath76 , and follow their evolution with temperature .",
    "these data are presented in figs .",
    "6(a ) and ( b ) for the @xmath3-axis and @xmath4-axis polarization , respectively , expressed in terms of the effective number of charge carriers , @xmath77 , where @xmath78 and @xmath79 are the free - electron mass and charge , and @xmath80  @xmath81 is the density of mn atoms .",
    "one can notice from fig .",
    "6(a ) that the @xmath3-axis low - energy sw increases upon cooling .",
    "this trend persists up to @xmath82 ev and can be associated with a sw @xmath83 of the low - energy optical band around 2 ev with decreasing temperature . at higher energies ,",
    "we observe a corresponding sw @xmath84 .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "6(b ) , the opposite trend holds for the @xmath4-axis sw changes , however , the low - energy sw decreases here up to 3.8 ev .",
    "we evaluate the sw changes associated with the high - energy optical bands as an amplitude value between the onset of the contribution from the high - energy optical bands and the high - energy limits , where the sw changes are nearly saturated , as explicitly indicated in figs .",
    "6(a ) and ( b ) . in fig .",
    "7(a ) and ( b ) we plot the temperature dependencies of these sw changes , which can be associated with the @xmath85 sw @xmath83 or @xmath84 of the low - energy and high - energy optical bands in the @xmath3-axis and @xmath4-axis polarization , respectively .",
    "this estimates the @xmath85 sw shifts between the low- and high- energy optical bands .",
    "the temperature - dependent profiles exhibit clear kinks around the magnetic ordering temperature t@xmath52 @xmath33 140 k , which highlights the influence of spin correlations on the sw shifts in the anisotropic dielectric response of lamno@xmath0 .",
    "to separate contributions from the low- and high - energy optical bands and estimate the associated @xmath86 sws , we performed a classical dispersion analysis . using a dielectric function of the form @xmath87 ,",
    "where @xmath88 , @xmath89 , and @xmath90 are the peak energy , width , and dimensionless oscillator strength of the @xmath91th oscillator , and @xmath92 is the core contribution from the dielectric function , we fit a set of lorentzian oscillators simultaneously to @xmath93 and @xmath94 . to obtain an accurate description of the anisotropic complex dielectric functions , @xmath95 and @xmath96 , which are presented in figs . 2 and 3 , we need to introduce a minimum set of six oscillators : three for the low - energy three - band feature , and three more for the high - energy optical features which can be recognized by the imaginary resonance part and the corresponding real antiresonance part at around 4 , 4.5 - 5 ev , and near 6 ev . in our analysis",
    "we assume that the sw of the optical bands above the investigated energy range remains @xmath74-independent .",
    "for the sake of definiteness we introduce only one high - energy optical band peaking at 8.7 ev , with the parameters @xmath97 = 1.87 and @xmath98 = 5.0 ev that have been estimated from the reflectivity study on a twinned lamno@xmath0 crystal by arima _ _",
    "et al.__@xcite figures 8 and 9 summarize the results of our dispersion analysis of the complex dielectric response at 20 and 300 k in the @xmath3-axis and @xmath4-axis polarization , respectively .",
    "one can notice from the figures that the constituent optical bands from the low- and high - energy sides are strongly superimposed , and therefore can not be unequivocally separated .",
    "the corresponding @xmath74-dependencies of the peak energies @xmath99 of the optical bands in @xmath71 and @xmath72 are detailed in fig . 10 . to check the robustness of our fit",
    ", we have performed the dispersion analysis on two data sets generated by cycling the temperature from 20 to 300 k and from 300 to 20 k. as one can notice from this figure , the accuracy in the determination of the peak energy of the optical band at around 6 ev is limited , which can be naturally explained by the uncertainties at higher energies , beyond the investigated spectral range . however , the fit is quite robust at low energies , so that the peak energies of the constituent optical bands can be accurately determined .    for an individual lorentz oscillator",
    "the associated sw can be estimated as @xmath100 = @xmath101 .",
    "we evaluate the @xmath86 sw of the low - energy optical band as the sum of the contributions of the three separate lorentz oscillators peaking at low temperatures at around @xmath102 ev , @xmath103 ev , and @xmath104 ev . the @xmath74-dependencies of the @xmath86 sw of the low - energy optical band in the @xmath3-axis and @xmath4-axis polarization are shown in fig . 11 .",
    "one can see that the @xmath86 sw of the low - energy optical band at around 2 ev shows pronounced changes over the entire investigated temperature range in the @xmath3-axis response , with a discernible kink near t@xmath52 @xmath33 140 k , while the corresponding changes along the @xmath4-axis are strongly suppressed .",
    "in contrast to the low - energy optical bands , their @xmath74-dependent counterparts at high energies appear on a background of a strongly pronounced optical band at @xmath16 4.7 ev . based on a comparison to optica data on other transition metal oxides and to a variety of theoretical calculations,@xcite this band can be assigned to the strongly dipole - allowed @xmath30 transition .",
    "the high - energy optical bands experiencing changes around t@xmath52 appear in the spectra above 3 ev , and among them we are able to distinguish the optical bands peaking at low temperatures at around 3.9@xmath1050.1 ev , 4.4@xmath1050.1 ev , 4.8@xmath1050.1 ev , and 5.7@xmath1050.5 ev . using the results of the present dispersion analysis , we evaluate the @xmath74-dependent shifts of the @xmath86 sw of the high - energy optical bands as @xmath106 .",
    "superexchange interactions between mn@xmath27 ions originate from various charge excitations @xmath107 , which arise from a transition of either a @xmath15 or a @xmath108 single electron between two ions , leading to different excited states at the resulting mn@xmath36 @xmath109 ) ion .",
    "here we use an effective model @xcite for the superexchange between mn@xmath27 ions , where all the excitation processes going via intermediate oxygen o(@xmath110 ) orbitals are absorbed in the effective hopping element @xmath111 which plays the role of an effective @xmath112 hopping element.@xcite    in order to parameterize the intersite @xmath113 optical excitations we introduce the following two parameters : an effective coulomb element @xmath28 and hund s exchange between two @xmath15 electrons @xmath114 , see e.g. ref . .",
    "while @xmath114 is only a somewhat screened atomic value , the parameter @xmath28 is not simply a single - ion property but should include both the renormalization by the nearest - neighbor coulomb interaction @xmath115 , and the polarization contribution @xmath116.@xcite therefore , its relation to the intraorbital coulomb repulsion @xmath117 is : @xmath118 , where @xmath119 is the number of neighbors .",
    "fortunately , the same intersite @xmath17 charge excitations are measured in the optical spectroscopy and determine the superexchange by virtual @xmath120 transitions , so a single effective parameter @xmath28 suffices to describe both the optical sws and the magnetic exchange constants .",

    "( 2 ) that the low - temperature ( lt ) limit of the sw of the ls - state optical excitations vanishes in the ferromagnetic @xmath24 plane.@xcite for the high - temperature ( ht ) limit @xmath176 , @xmath191 , and using the corresponding averages for the orbital projection operators in the @xmath24 polarization one finds the combined sw @xmath192 ( with the contributions from the individual ls - state excitations ( ii ) 0.0193 , ( iii ) 0.0128 , ( iv ) 0.0302 , and ( v ) 0.0090 ) . for the lt limit @xmath172 in the @xmath4 polarization , @xmath193 , and one can get an estimate for the combined sw @xmath194 ( with the following individual contributions : ( ii ) 0.0212 , ( iii ) 0.0186 , ( iv ) 0.0331 , and ( v ) 0.0131 ) .",
    "then , the sw variation between the lt and ht limits is @xmath195 in @xmath4-polarization .    a comparison between the theoretical and the experimental temperature - dependent sws follows from the suggested assignments for the hs and ls optical bands ( figs",

    "6 , and the @xmath86 sw resulting from the dispersion analysis described in section iii.a.3 ( which includes tails of the constituent optical bands ) .",
    "one can notice from fig .",
    "13 that the @xmath85 sw of the 2 ev optical band , in contrast to its @xmath86 sw , does not show clear critical behavior around the nel temperature @xmath148 in the @xmath3-axis polarization",
    ". this could be the reason why tobe _",
    "et al._@xcite did not recognize the critical behavior in the temperature dependence of the @xmath85 sw of the 2 ev optical band around @xmath148 in their study , and as a result concluded that @xmath30 transitions determine the character of this low - energy excitation .",
    "as one can notice from [ fig13 ] and [ fig14 ] , between the low - temperature limit and @xmath148 , the anisotropic temperature dependencies of the experimental @xmath86 sw of the low - energy 2 ev optical band and the high - energy optical bands of ls character are , in general , well reproduced by the @xmath86 sw resulting from the @xmath196 se hamiltonian ( eq .",
    "however , in the analysis of the _ partial _ and _ total _ anisotropic sw of the ls states , the uncertainties due to the contribution from the high - energy ls - state transition ( v ) at @xmath197 ev and additional contributions from the @xmath198 and @xmath199 transitions , as discussed below , may result in the larger error bars .",
    "moreover , the deviation of the ls - state optical sw above @xmath148 can be attributed to high - temperature anharmonicity effect of the dominating background , represented by the strongly dipole - allowed @xmath30 transition at @xmath16 4.7 ev .    in the @xmath4-axis response",
    "we observe the optical band at @xmath16 3.8 ev , which clearly exhibits the hs character , and becomes most pronounced at 300 k , simultaneously with the hs low - energy optical band at 2 ev ( see figs . 3 and 5 ) . due to the presence of this extra hs - state optical excitation the isosbestic point in the @xmath4-axis polarization",
    "is shifted to the higher energy , and , therefore , the low - energy sw decreases here until the energy of @xmath200 ev , as one can notice from fig .",
    "6(b ) . in our previous study ,",
    "@xcite we assigned the band at around 3.8 ev , pronounced in the @xmath7 and @xmath201 ( see figs . 3 , 5 and 9 ) , to the intersite @xmath202 hs - state excitation .",
    "in agreement with the assignment of the 2 ev optical band to the @xmath203 hs transition , this transition could be observed at the energies shifted up by the crystal field splitting @xmath204 ev .",
    "the polarization dependence of the band at @xmath16 3.8 ev can be then naturally explained by the @xmath129-type ordering of the unoccupied @xmath15 orbitals . in the @xmath4 axis ,",
    "the sw _ loss _ between 20 k and 300 k , corresponding to the extra hs contribution of the 3.8 ev optical band in the spectral range between 3 and 3.8 ev , is about @xmath205 , as follows from fig .",
    "then , the cumulative sw variation of the 2 and 3.8 ev optical bands between the low- and high - temperature limits in the @xmath4-axis polarization will amount to @xmath206 . in the @xmath3-axis polarization",
    "the sw changes of the 3.8 ev optical band between the low- and high - temperature limits can be estimated as the missing sw in the balance of the 2 ev hs band and the higher energy ls bands . in accordance with the analysis presented above ,",
    "this amounts to @xmath207 .",
    "then , the cumulative sw variation of the 2 and 3.8 ev optical bands between the low- and high - temperature limits in the @xmath3-axis polarization is @xmath208 ev .",
    "the calculated temperature variations of the spectral weights of the closely spaced ls excitations ( ii )  ( iv ) , in combination with the data of fig . 5 ,",
    "allow us to put further constraints on the structure of the level spectrum and the model parameter @xmath153 ( which controls the energy of level ( iii ) relative to those of ( ii ) and ( iv ) ) .",
    "to this end , we have numerically computed the complex dielectric response along the @xmath4-axis for different values of @xmath153 in the range 0  1 ev , using the spectral weights calculated from the se model . since the calculated @xmath209 of excitation ( iv ) is approximately twice as large as the ones of excitations ( ii ) and ( iii ) , the narrow , symmetric lineshape of the 4.4 ev feature in the temperature - difference spectrum @xmath210 in fig .",
    "5(b ) is best reproduced if @xmath153 is chosen such that @xmath211 , and this doublet and level @xmath212 are grouped around the peak energy @xmath213 ev .",
    "this is the case for @xmath214 mev , yielding @xmath215 ev , @xmath216 ev , and @xmath217 ev . level ( v ) is therefore expected to be outside the measured energy range , which explains why it is not observed experimentally .",
    "we have verified that asymmetric profiles of @xmath210 inconsistent with our data are generated if @xmath153 is chosen outside the quoted uncertainty limits .",
    "the constraint @xmath218 discussed above then yields @xmath157 ev for the effective intra - atomic coulomb repulsion .",
    "we emphasize that @xmath114 and the sum @xmath219 can be inferred from the positions of the temperature - dependent optical bands at 2 and 4.4 ev alone , whereas the separate determination of @xmath28 and @xmath153 relies on a spectral - weight analysis of three excitations that are not resolved experimentally .",
    "the latter determination should thus be regarded as more tentative . however , the main conclusions of our paper do not rely on the numerical values of these parameters .",
    "finally , we consider the magnetic exchange constants , @xmath220 and @xmath221 , to verify whether the presented interpretation is consistent also with the magnetic properties of lamno@xmath0 . from the effective se hamiltonian , eq .",
    "( 2 ) , one finds , @xmath222 where @xmath220 and @xmath221 are determined by the @xmath15 and @xmath108 contributions as follows@xcite @xmath223 here the @xmath15 part is obtained from the se hamiltonian given by eq .",
    "( 2 ) and is anisotropic in the state with orbital order .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath108 contribution , represented by @xmath224 , is orbital independent and isotropic .",
    "it follows from charge excitations by @xmath108 electrons , @xcite @xmath225 excitations along a bond @xmath226 , which involve @xmath227 and @xmath228 configurations at both mn@xmath36 and mn@xmath229 ions .",
    "the @xmath108 part of the se is antiferromagnetic , with the excitation energies ( estimated from our parameters @xmath230 ev and @xmath231 ev):@xcite @xmath232 ( @xmath16 3.85 ev ) , @xmath233 ( @xmath16 4.45 ev ) , @xmath234 ( @xmath16 4.75 ev ) , and @xmath235 ( @xmath16 5.35 ev ) .",
    "the @xmath108 excitations are all ls ( @xmath97 = 3/2 ) and could be partly superimposed with the ls part of the @xmath15 excitations at the specified energies . while the first three of them might be difficult to separate from the @xmath15 contributions , we do not find any evidence on the highest energy contribution at energy around @xmath236 ev which suggests rather low intensity of this excitation .",
    "moreover , the good qualitative agreement between the superexchange @xmath15 model and the _ total _ optical spectral weight confirms that the leading term in the hs and ls part in the @xmath3-axis and @xmath4-axis polarization comes from the @xmath15 optical excitations , while the @xmath108 excitations contribute with a relatively small sw .",
    "this is also consistent with theoretical expectations according to which the optical spectral weights due to the @xmath108 excitations are proportional to the respective superexchange terms .",
    "they arise from processes via o(@xmath237 ) orbitals with the hopping @xmath238 , and are therefore lower than those following from @xmath15 excitations by @xmath239 , i.e. roughly by one order of magnitude ; see also ref . .",
    "nevertheless , these excitations provide an important contribution to the magnetic exchange constants as all the terms have the same sign , unlike for the @xmath15 part .    the experimental values of the anisotropic magnetic exchange constants for the @xmath8-type antiferromagnetic phase of lamno@xmath0 , @xmath240 mev and @xmath241 mev,@xcite are reproduced for the orbital angle @xmath242 when the present effective parameters @xmath243 are used to determine the excitation energies @xmath244 in eqs .",
    "( 12 ) and ( 13 ) . in fig .",
    "14 we show the dependencies of both exchange constants , @xmath220 and @xmath221 , on the orbital angle @xmath164 , calculated for the parameters deduced from the experiment ( all in ev ) : @xmath245 , @xmath246 , @xmath247 , and @xmath248 . in addition , the value of @xmath249 mev was chosen to reproduce the experimental values of @xmath220 and @xmath221 .",
    "this value is consistent with original estimate of @xmath250 mev deduced in ref . from the nel temperature of camno@xmath0 , and fits remarkably well to a later estimate , @xcite @xmath251 mev . in view of uncertainties associated with @xmath224 and the optical excitation",
    "energies @xmath252  @xmath253 entering eqs . ( 12 ) and ( 13 ) , as well as the error associated with the experimentally determined magnetic exchange parameters , @xcite the agreement between the orbital angle determined in this analysis and the one extracted from the optical spectral weight above should be regarded as quite satisfactory .",
    "we further note that an additional contribution to the superexchange could be associated with the @xmath254 charge excitations , which would also affect the above estimate of the orbital angle @xmath164 .",
    "indeed , according to the tanabe - sugano diagram@xcite for the high - spin @xmath37 complexes , in the case of a weak ligand field ( @xmath255 ev ) , the ls transitions to @xmath227 and @xmath228 states lie at slightly lower energies than the ls @xmath203 @xmath136 transition . according to our assignment the ( ii )",
    "@xmath136 transition appears at @xmath16 4.4 ev .",
    "then , provided it is scaled following the @xmath37 tanabe - sugano diagram , the @xmath227 transition should appear at @xmath256 ev .",
    "figures 2 and 4 show temperature changes of ls character in the @xmath3-axis spectra @xmath6 and @xmath257 around 3.8 ev , which could be associated with the @xmath258 @xmath227 ( and close to it @xmath228 ) ls states . in the @xmath3-axis response the optical band at around 3.8 ev is the first high - energy ls excitation , adjacent to the hs ( i ) @xmath134 low - energy excitation at 2 ev .",
    "therefore , the isosbestic point , namely the crossing point for the different temperature scans , which balances the sw transfer between the hs and ls states , appears at @xmath82 ev in the @xmath3-axis response .",
    "several contributions can be distinguished in the optical response of lamno@xmath0 crystals in the investigated spectral range : ( i ) charge - transfer @xmath30 transitions from the occupied o @xmath12 band into the partially occupied mn @xmath13 levels , ( ii ) _ intrasite _ @xmath17 transitions between the jahn - teller splitted @xmath15 levels and from the occupied @xmath108 levels into the empty @xmath15 levels , and ( iii ) _ intersite _ @xmath113 transitions @xmath259 ( along a bond @xmath159 ) within the @xmath15 and @xmath108 manifolds and between the @xmath108 and @xmath15 local states . based on a comparison to optical data on other transition metal oxides and to a variety of theoretical calculations,@xcite the pronounced optical band at 4.7 ev",
    "can be assigned to a strongly dipole - allowed o @xmath260 mn @xmath13 transition .",
    "an assignment of the low - energy band at 2 ev has , however , been controversial in the literature , where different possibilities from ( i)-(iii ) are considered .    the present ellipsometry study on the untwinned lamno@xmath0 crystal clearly demonstrates that the anisotropic optical sws in the energy window covered by our experiment are strongly influenced by the onset of long - range antiferromagnetic order at @xmath148 . since both ( i ) the charge - transfer excitations between the o @xmath12 and mn @xmath13 orbitals and ( ii ) the intrasite @xmath17 transitions should not be affected by the relative orientation of neighboring mn spins ( near the magnetic transition ) , we associate strongly @xmath74-dependent bands with ( iii ) the intersite @xmath113 transitions .",
    "we discovered that the onset of long - range antiferromagnetic order causes critical sw redistribution around the nel temperature @xmath148 between the low- and high - energy counterparts , located around 2 and 5 ev , which we associate with parallel ( hs ) and antiparallel ( ls ) spin transfer between the neighboring ions .",
    "the experimentally determined temperature variations of the anisotropic optical sw of the low - energy optical band at 2 ev ( hs part ) are in a good quantitative agreement with the superexchange model that attributes them to the temperature - dependent spin correlations between mn spins .",
    "this interpretation was possible as the energy scales of spin and orbital interactions are well separated from each other in lamno@xmath0 , i.e. @xmath261 , and therefore only the onset of the spin order influences the distribution of sws in the relevant regime of temperature , while the orbital order is practically unchanged.@xcite    from the anisotropy ratio of the low- and high - temperature sw of the 2 ev hs - state excitation we obtain a reasonable estimate for the orbital angle @xmath164 , consistent with the structural data.@xcite the ls higher - energy counterpart appears in our spectra on a broad - band background of the strongly dipole - allowed o @xmath262 mn@xmath13 charge - transfer transition located at around @xmath263 4.7 ev . nonetheless , using a careful study of the temperature dependencies in combination with a dispersion analysis , we were able to separate ls - state transitions .",
    "the description of the multiplet structure in the framework of the intersite @xmath264 transitions by the @xmath15 electrons , based on the @xmath37 tanabe - sugano diagram,@xcite allowed us to evaluate the effective parameters : @xmath230 ev , @xmath231 ev , and @xmath265 ev , while the value of @xmath266 ev was deduced from the overall redistribution of the sw due to the onset of the magnetic order .    finally , we emphasize that the overall consistent picture of the optical spectra and magnetic properties deduced from the present study confirms that the lowest - energy optical excitation at around 2 ev has the @xmath113 origin and is associated with mott - hubbard excitations , while the strongly - dipole allowed @xmath30 ct transition emerges at a higher energy around 4.7 ev .",
    "the latter observation is in reasonable agreement with the optical excitation energy of the ct transition mn@xmath27+o@xmath267 @xmath268 mn@xmath36+o@xmath269 calculated at @xmath270 ev in the shell model approximation , @xcite which takes into account environmental factors ( covalency , polarization , _ etc . _ ) , important in many oxide systems@xcite .",
    "as we discussed , such effects are responsible for the considerable reduction of the local coulomb interaction from the respective bare value .",
    "however , we note that the 2 ev peak , assigned to the @xmath113 transition in this study , is observed at a lower energy than that estimated in ref . for the energy of the intersite transition mn@xmath27+mn@xmath27 @xmath268 mn@xmath36+mn@xmath229 at @xmath271 ev . more elaborate theoretical and experimental study is required to elucidate the origin of this discrepancy , to understand the three - subband structure of the lowest - energy optical band , and to verify the value of the on - site coulomb interaction @xmath28 .",
    "summarizing , the above analysis implies that lamno@xmath0 is in the regime of a mott - hubbard rather than charge transfer system according to the original classification of zaanen , sawatzky and allen .",
    "whether the insulating ground state of lamno@xmath0 follows primarily from strong electronic correlations , or is due to strong lattice distortions , is still under debate at present .",
