    "in recent years it has been shown that low mass planets ( @xmath2\\mathrm{m_{\\earth}}$ ] ) can migrate outwards in discs with non - isothermal effects @xcite .",
    "precisely , the migration in the inner part of a radiative disc can be directed outwards , while it remains directed inwards in the outer disc @xcite .",
    "this establishes the existence of a critical radius where migration vanishes , towards which planetary cores migrate from both the inner and the outer part of the disc .",
    "therefore , the zero migration location acts as a planet trap at which proto - planets can accumulate in resonances , collide and eventually form bigger objects . @xcite .    in all",
    "these works the heating is provided by viscous friction and the cooling by radiative diffusion ( in 3d discs ) or by a local cooling rate ( in 2d discs ) .",
    "more recently , @xcite , have shown the importance of stellar irradiation on the disc structure and the consequences for planetary migration .",
    "the main result is that when considering stellar irradiation the outer disc changes from a shadowed to a flared disc .",
    "nonetheless , opacity transitions ( e.g. the iceline ) create bumps in the aspect ratio and hence shadowed regions . in the flared part of the disc the migration turns out to be inwards and planets",
    "can migrate outwards only in shadowed regions of the disc , where the radial gradient of entropy is much steeper than in the flared part of the disc .",
    "these results were obtained in equilibrium discs with uniform viscosity featuring a zero radial mass flux @xcite and extended to the case of accretion discs with an alpha prescription for the viscosity @xcite in @xcite .",
    "this second case is of particular interest , since a given mass - flow ( @xmath3 ) rate corresponds to a specific disc age @xcite so that , investigating the disc structure for different values of @xmath4 , is equivalent to studying the disc structure as a function of the disc evolution @xcite .    in @xcite the planet migrations maps have been obtained applying the torque formula of @xcite using the disc properties obtained in the simulations . the formula , although very complex , is based on the fact that the torque exerted by the protoplanetary disc onto the planet has two main contributions : i ) the so - called lindblad torque due to the spiral arms launched by the planet in the disc , which is not affected by the equation of state , , with @xmath5 given in eq.[gamma0 ] . ] and",
    "ii ) the co - orbital corotation torque caused by material librating in the horseshoe region . when considering radiative effects the corotation torque contribution can be positive and possibly dominate over the negative lindblad torque , leading to outwards migration .",

    "formula was calibrated with a 2d hydrodynamical model for low mass planets ( @xmath6 ) .    with a specific disc setting not accounting for stellar irradiation ,",
    "@xcite found positive total torque for planetary masses in the range @xmath7 $ ] earth masses .",
    "the influence of the disc s mass on the migration was studied in @xcite and its application to earth sized planets was addressed by @xcite who found the contribution of a new torque not accounted for by the formula .",
    "this new negative torque is due to the formation of an asymmetric cold and dense finger of gas driven by circulation and libration streamlines .",
    "the aim of this paper is to investigate numerically the total torque acting on planets kept on fixed orbits in 3d stellar irradiated discs and provide quantitative comparisons with the @xcite formula .",
    "we use the explicit / implicit hydrodynamical code fargoca @xcite that includes a two - temperature solver for radiative transfer in the flux - limited approximation .    in principle stellar heating only changes the structure of the disc and does not act on the mechanism responsible for outwards migration directly .",
    "nevertheless the analytical formula has been calibrated on 2d discs so that a quantitative test on the validity of that formula for realistic 3d discs is needed . moreover",
    ", a constant mass flow @xmath3 through the disc @xcite might have an influence on the torque acting on planets and , to our knowledge , this case has never been tested before in 3d discs with a non - isothermal eos .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : the physical modelling is presented in section 2 , in section 3 we describe the migration maps obtained from the analytic formula applied to our 2d unperturbed discs .",
    "plane ] in sections 4 and 5 we provide results of 3d simulations done respectively on a constant viscosity stellar irradiated equilibrium disc and on an @xmath8-viscosity accretion disc . in section 6",
    "we go beyond the simple comparisons of the net torques predicted analytically and measured numerically , focusing on a key ingredient of the analytic formula : the size of the corotation zone , which governs the corotation torque and the torque saturation .",
    "the conclusions are provided in section 7 .",
    "the protoplanetary disc is treated as a three dimensional non self - gravitating gas whose motion is described by the navier - stokes equations .",
    "we use spherical coordinates @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the radial distance from the star , i.e from the origin , @xmath11 the polar angle measured from the @xmath12-axis ( the colatitude ) and @xmath13 is the azimuthal coordinate starting from the @xmath14-axis .",
    "the midplane of the disc is at the equator @xmath15 .",

    ", we will also consider the case of a radiative equilibrium disc with uniform viscosity ( @xmath54 ) and @xmath48 , were the only source of heating is viscous heating ( set red hereafter ) .",
    "this setup of the red disc has been previously studied in @xcite and in @xcite for planetary masses up to @xmath55 .    before placing the planet in a 3d disc ,",
    "we bring the disc to radiative equilibrium .",

    "we have checked that this formula can still be used as a guideline for the choice of the resolution for non isothermal 3d discs with and without stellar irradiation .",
    "however , eq.[xhs ] is based on the equivalence of the linear corotation torque and the horseshoe drag in 2d discs . in @xcite",
    "it has been shown that nonlinearities appear on the flow for mass ratios @xmath65 . for these planetary masses",
    "the horseshoe region is larger than the linear prediction resulting in a boost of the corotation torque .",
    "it is therefore important to check whether also in 3d hydrodynamical simulations the horseshoe width increases for @xmath66 and what is the corresponding impact in the corotation torque .",
    "section 6 is devoted to this topic .",
    "the values of the masses and resolutions @xmath67 for the sed disc are shown in table [ table : tab1 ] .",
    "in @xcite we have shown that a resolution of 4 grid cells in the half width of the horseshoe region matched the requirement of having resolution independent results within reasonable cpu times for masses up to @xmath68 . here",
    "we use 4 grid cells in the half width of the horseshoe region also for planets with masses larger than @xmath69 ; we have tested that results are stable when increasing the resolution to 5 grid cells in some test cases .    concerning the calculation of the gravitational torque acting on the planet we recall that it is common to exclude the inner part of the hill sphere of the planet .",
    "this is obtained by applying a tapering function ( named hill cut in the following ) which in our case reads @xcite : @xmath70^{-1}. \\label{hcut}\\ ] ] the value of @xmath71 is zero at the planet location and increases to 1 at distances @xmath22 from the planet larger than the hill radius @xmath72 .",

    "we use @xmath74 @xcite .",
    "this procedure allows to exclude the part of the disc that is gravitationally bound to planets that form a circum - planetary disc .",
    "however , this prescription is not justified for small mass planets that do not have a circum - planetary disc . for small planets we mean planets having a bondi radius ( @xmath75 ) smaller than their hill radius . from the definition of the bondi and hill radius one obtains @xmath76 for @xmath77 . @xcite . ] in the following we show the total torque computed with hill cut , and , for planetary masses satisfying @xmath77 , we also show the total torque computed without hill cut .",
    "the change in the disc structure due to stellar irradiation has important consequences for the migration of embedded bodies @xcite .",
    "one can estimate the torque acting on planets using the formula provided by @xcite .",
    "the migration maps obtained from the formula are shown on fig.[map ] for respectively set sed ( top panel ) , set sad with @xmath57 ( middle panel ) and set red ( bottom panel ) .",

    "we do not enter here in the details of the torque formula provided by @xcite we just recall that outwards migration is a delicate process depending on the dynamical properties of the corotation region as well as on the viscosity of the disc and of its cooling properties .",
    "different timescales are at play ( see @xcite ) , in order to detect a positive corotation torque contribution which possibly dominates over the negative lindblad torque .",
    "we remark that the formula has been obtained for planets that do not perturb the disc significantly ( @xmath81 , i.e. linear regime ) while the maps shown in fig.[map ] consider also intermediate mass planets ( @xmath82 ) .",
    "the torque saturation , which determines the upper limit in planet mass for outwards migration , depends on the viscous timescale defined by : @xmath83 were @xmath84 is the adiabatic index , @xmath85 in our simulations .",
    "the width of the horseshoe region is @xmath86 in order to take adiabatic effects into account @xcite .",
    "however , for intermediate mass planets , the actual width of the horseshoe region can be different from @xmath87 of eq.[xhs ] @xcite and this difference can have an impact on torque saturation .    in the migration map of the sad case ( fig.[map],top )",
    "we see that , using @xmath86 , torque saturation is supposed to occur for quite large planetary masses and outwards migration is expected for planets up to @xmath88 ( this upper limit can moderately change by changing the smoothing length @xmath31 ) .",
    "it is interesting to check this result with 3d numerical simulations , because outward migration of intermediate mass planets has important impacts for formation models of giant planets .",
    "in fact giant planet precursors could be prevented from migrating into the inner disk before they reach a mass that allows gap opening and therefore slower inward migration in the type - ii migration regime .    in order to test the validity of the formula we have considered planets of different masses held on fixed orbits in each of the three considered discs and",

    "here we focus on the size of the corotation zone , which is a key parameter for the estimate of the corotation torque and of the torque saturation .    according to @xcite eq.[xhs ] , obtained for 2d discs , is valid only for planet to star mass ratio @xmath187 .",

    "this is a manifestation of the flow nonlinearity turning out in a boost of the corotation torque ( @xcite ) .    in this section ,",

    "since differences with respect to eq.[xhs ] can come from 3d effects as well as from radiative effects we will proceed in 2 steps : i ) we determine the difference between the horseshoe width in 2d and 3d simulations in an isothermal setting , ii ) we compare isothermal 3d to fully radiative 3d .",
    "for the two dimensional case we used the fargo code ( @xcite ) .",
    "we recall that in 2d a softening length @xmath23 is applied to the planet potential through : @xmath192 in 2 dimensional models , eq.[pot2d ] allows to mimic the average influence that the planet would have on the vertical gas column .",

    "now a larger horseshoe region causes saturation earlier .",
    "we discuss this point in section 6.4 .",
    "in the isothermal case the transition between the two regimes is associated to a boost in the corotation torque @xcite and a small softening length is required to detect it .",
    "therefore , we can wonder if we have missed some effects in the torque computation by using a softening length of @xmath200 .",
    "in the case of 3d isothermal simulations simulations it has been shown @xcite that a decrease in the softening length for a planet of @xmath214 corresponds to a drastic change in the density structure in the planet vicinity which has an important impact on the corotation torque .",
    "precisely , the authors found a torque excess in agreement with @xcite .",
    "the situation changes when taking into account thermal effects . in this case",
    "a deeper potential corresponds to an increase of temperature near the planet so that the density distribution close to the planet is not drastically changed . in @xcite ( their fig.14 , top ) changing the smoothing length from @xmath215 and @xmath216 in a fully radiative setting acts in increasing the torque of about @xmath217 , with respect to @xmath130 of increase in the corresponding isothermal case .",
    "we have extended the discussion of @xcite concerning the dependence of the torque on the softening length by computing the width of the horseshoe region and the total torque acting on fixed planets in the range @xmath218m_{\\earth}$ ] for the red set with @xmath219 .",
    "in fig.[xsred ] it appears clearly that the width of the horseshoe region is almost not affected by the change in the softening length .",
    "( fig.[hr ] ) . to be compared to data having @xmath199 a rescaling by @xmath210 is applied . ]",
    "the measured torque is also almost not affected by the change in the softening length .",
    "we observe that in the @xmath190 regime the horseshoe region is nicely fitted by the law used in the paardekooper formula ( fig.[xsred ] ) .",
    "however , although the measured width of the horseshoe region perfectly matches the law used in the formula up to @xmath220 the measured torque fits only qualitatively the one provided by the formula as explained in section 4.2 .",
    "this is not surprising since many other parameters enter in the formula and can possibly be different in realistic 3d discs .    in isothermal discs",
    "a torque excess is correlated to the departure from the linear regime @xcite while in all our radiative discs we do not observe the same phenomenon .",
    "taking into account thermal effects , the transition from the linear to the nonlinear regime , even considering a small softening length ( fig.[xsred ] ) , is smoother in radiative discs ( fig.[xhs3d ] and fig.[xsred ] ) with respect the isothermal case with small softening length ( fig.[xhs2d ] ) .",
    "moreover , the mass at which we observe a departure from the linear regime in fig.[xhs3d ] and fig.[xsred ] corresponds to the onset of torque saturation in fig.[compass],[compamnras ] and [ compamd ] , middle panel .    ) for 3d simulations of red set , for respectively @xmath221 and @xmath222 .",
    "the lines show the fits in @xmath190 and @xmath189 obtained for the stellar irradiated discs ( fig.[xhs3d ] ) .",
    "the law for the horseshoe region used in the paardekooper formula , @xmath212 , is also shown . ]",
    "the width of the horseshoe region is of crucial importance for the saturation of the torque acting on more massive planets .",
    "a larger width of the horseshoe region increases the viscous timescale ( eq . [ taunu ] ) making torque saturation easier .",
    "as demonstrated in fig.[xhs3d ] and fig.[xsred ] , the width of the horseshoe region increases for more massive planets and does not follow the simple law of @xmath223 , which is only valid for low mass planets .    in fig.[maplarge ] we show the migration map of the sad disc , where we used the width of the horseshoe region measured by our simulations ( fig.[xhs3d ] ) instead of @xmath223 .",
    "when comparing to fig.[map],top panel we see that for planetary masses of up to @xmath224 the migration map remains unchanged while for larger planetary masses , we observe that the transition of the torque from positive to negative occurs in the interval @xmath225 .",
    "the transition occurs in the interval @xmath226 in fig.[map],top panel .",
    "this is caused by a larger width of the horseshoe region , which makes saturation of the corotation torque easier . hence the total torque transitions into negative values at smaller planetary masses .",
    "adapting the width of the horseshoe region to our measured values in the torque formula therefore over predicts the transition to inward migration compared to our simulations .",
    "the difference between our simulations and the torque predicted by the formula is therefore not only caused by a different width of the horseshoe region .",
    "the cooling process plays also an important role and the vertical cooling in 2d disc is treated like blackbody radiation , while our 3d disc features vertical heat diffusion .",
    "therefore we think that the quantitative agreement between the torque formula of @xcite and simulations for planetary masses @xmath227 is a coincidence and the formula should be updated with results of 3d simulations . however , this is beyond the scope of this paper and left for future work .",
    "obtained using the width of the horseshoe region measured by our simulations ( fig.[xhs3d ] ) instead of @xmath223 . ]",
    "using 3d hydrodynamical simulations including stellar and viscous heating as well as radiative cooling we have computed the torque acting on planets of various masses kept on fixed circular orbits in both equilibrium and accretional protoplanetary disks .",
    "we confirm the results previously obtained on constant viscosity equilibrium discs , where the only source of heating was provided by viscous friction .",
    "the comparison between the total torque obtained with numerical simulations and the one predicted by semi - empirical formula @xcite is in quantitatively good agreement for large masses ( @xmath228 ) . in particular",
    ", the formula predicts well the maximum planet mass at which inwards migration is prevented by the action of the entropy - driven corotation torque .    instead ,",
    "although our results remain similar to those expected by the paardekooper formula , we observe quantitative differences as large as a factor of @xmath229 concerning : ( i ) the value of the maximum positive torque as a function of the planet s mass , ( ii ) the value of the planet mass at which the torque is maximal and ( iii ) the minimum planet mass allowing outwards migration .",
    "the last difference is due to the presence of a `` cold finger effect '' already discussed extensively in @xcite .",
    "the differences concerning the items ( i ) and ( ii ) have already been pointed out by @xcite as caused by differences between 2d and 3d effects .",
    "moreover , by measuring the width of the horseshoe region we have observed that the value of the planet mass at which the torque is maximal is correlated to the departure from the linear regime . for large planetary masses",
    "the quantitatively good agreement between the numerical results and the prediction of the analytic formula was unexpected since the formula is based on unperturbed discs while planets with masses larger than @xmath230 start opening a partial gap .",
    "precisely , torque saturation has the same behavior in the torque formula and in simulations though saturations effects appear for larger planetary masses with respect to the torque formula . from the measure of the width of the horseshoe region ,",
    "we have found that the onset of saturation is correlated to the onset of the nonlinear regime not taken into account by the formula . plugging the measured horseshoe width in the formula",
    "gives a worse comparison .",
    "therefore , we think that the quantitative agreement on large masses is a coincidence , and future works is needed to provide a more accurate torque expression .     at the present state of the art , though there are some differences between the torque formula and 3d simulations , the zero torque location at the transition from outwards to inwards migration at large planetary masses is reproduced surprisingly well , making the formula applicable to the study of planetary migration properties from the unperturbed disc structure .",
    "we thank an anonymous referee for raising important points on the relation between the width of horseshoe region and the corotation torque .",
