    "various systems of interacting elements can be represented by networks that consist of a set of nodes and links that connect pairs of nodes .",
    "the structure of networks affects various dynamics occurring on the networks @xcite.in particular , many dynamics on networks are controlled by a few extremal eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix and the laplacian matrix of the network ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : methods ] for the definition of the laplacian matrix ) .",
    "the values of these eigenvalues provide concise and useful information about the dynamics on the networks .    in this study ,",
    "we focus on the second smallest eigenvalue of the laplacian matrix ; it is called the spectral gap and is denoted by @xmath0 in this paper .",
    "we examine @xmath0 because it characterizes a wide class of dynamics on networks as follows .",
    "first , a network with a large value of @xmath0 decreases the threshold of coupling strength for synchronization for both linear dynamics and some nonlinear dynamics including coupled oscillators on networks @xcite .",
    "such a family of nonlinear dynamics is called the class ii @xcite or type ii @xcite dynamics .",
    "note that the largest laplacian eigenvalue as well as @xmath0 is an important determinant of the synchronizability in the so - called class iii @xcite or type i @xcite dynamics .",
    "however , we are not concerned with class iii or type i dynamics in this paper .",
    "second , when @xmath0 is large , synchronization in these dynamics @xcite and consensus dynamics @xcite occur rapidly in certain types of networks .",
    "third , @xmath0 characterizes the convergence speed of the markov chain on the network to the stationary density @xcite .",
    "fourth , the first - passage time of the random walk is characterized by @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "fifth , the duality between the coalescing random walk and the voter model @xciteimplies that @xmath0 also determines the consensus time of the stochastic voter dynamics .",
    "this is in agreement with the results obtained for the majority - vote spin dynamics on networks @xcite .",
    "in addition to these dynamical properties of networks , various graph - theoretical structural properties of networks are characterized by @xmath0 @xcite .    in these applications ,",
    "a large value of @xmath0 is usually preferred because it indicates , for example , enhanced synchronizability and fast convergence .",
    "consequently , the enhancement of @xmath0 has been explored in the framework of designing of networks @xcite and numerical optimization via the rewiring of links @xcite . in practice , however , rewiring links , constructing optimized networks from scratch , and adding nodes or links are likely to cost more than the removal of nodes or links of a given network .",
    "the effects of removal of nodes or links have been investigated in the context of the cascading failure @xcite and the influence on extreme eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix @xcite . with regard to laplacian eigenvalues",
    ", the removal of links always decreases @xmath0 and makes the network less likely to synchronize @xcite .",
    "however , to the best of our knowledge , whether or not careful removal of nodes may increase @xmath0 has not yet been examined .",
    "we treat this problem in the present paper .",
    "although removal of nodes generally decreases the magnitude of activities , stabilizing synchronization at the expense of the magnitude is valuable in some applications .",
    "the treatment of cardiac arrhythmia is one of the examples .",
    "the heart consists of a large number of cardiac cells that show nonlinear dynamics @xcite .",
    "synchronized dynamics of cardiac cells create physiological heart beats @xcite .",
    "cardiac arrhythmia is considered to be caused by malfunction of synchronization .",
    "the catheter ablation aims at restoring synchrony of the entire heart by electrically deactivating some cardiac cells that prevent synchronization @xcite . as another example",
    ", proper operations of power plant networks also critically require that the frequency of voltage among power plants is synchronized @xcite .",
    "loss of the synchronization may induce a blackout in the entire network .",
    "therefore , it is likely that stable synchrony at the expense of some total power supply serves steady supplying of electricity to the entire network @xcite .",
    "we compare various strategies for maximizing @xmath0 by sequential node removal on various model and real networks .",
    "in particular , we develop a perturbative strategy that is applicable to relatively large networks in terms of the computational cost .",
    "we show that the performance of the perturbative strategy is comparable to that of the computationally costly optimal sequential strategy and is generally better than that of heuristic strategies .",
    "in addition , in many examined examples , @xmath0 continues to increase until we remove a fairly large fraction of nodes ( @xmath1 50% ) sequentially according to the perturbative strategy .",
    "we consider undirected and unweighted connected networks with @xmath2 nodes .",
    "the laplacian matrix @xmath3 is defined as follows .",
    "@xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) is equal to @xmath6 if node @xmath7 and @xmath8 are connected and 0 otherwise ; @xmath3 is a symmetric matrix .",
    "the diagonal is given by @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the degree of node @xmath7 .",
    "note that @xmath11 for each @xmath7",
    ". @xmath3 has @xmath2 ( real ) nonnegative eigenvalues @xmath12 .",
    "we seek to maximize @xmath0 upon sequential removal of nodes .",
    "we compare the effectiveness of the following node removal strategies by applying them to model and real networks .    * _ degree - based strategy _ : in each step , we remove the node with the smallest degree in the remaining network .",
    "the rationale behind this strategy is that the smallest degree controls @xmath0 , with a useful bound being @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the smallest degree in the network @xcite . if there exist multiple nodes having the same smallest degree , we select one of them with an equal probability . + in intentional attacks on networks , where the aim is to fragment",
    "the network into disjoint components with a small number of removed nodes , removing nodes with the largest degree is an effective strategy @xcite .",
    "we implemented this strategy but obtained poor results for our purpose , and therefore we do not mention it in the following . * _ betweenness - based strategy _ : in each step , we remove the node with the smallest betweenness centrality .",
    "the betweenness centrality of node @xmath7 is defined as follows .",
    "denote by @xmath15 the number of the shortest paths between nodes @xmath16 and @xmath17 , and by @xmath18 the number of the shortest paths between them that pass through node @xmath7 .",
    "we set @xmath19 .",
    "the betweenness centrality of node @xmath7 is proportional to @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "sequentially removing nodes with the largest betweenness centrality yielded poor results , and therefore we do not mention it in the following . *",
    "_ optimal sequential strategy _ : we calculate the change in @xmath0 induced by the removal of each node by direct numerical simulations .",
    "then , we select the node whose removal increases @xmath0 by the largest amount . note that this strategy is computationally costly because it requires the calculation of @xmath0 for @xmath2 different networks , each having @xmath21 nodes . calculating @xmath0 for a single network",
    "requires @xmath22 time .",
    "therefore , carrying out a single step of the optimal sequential strategy requires @xmath23 time . * _ perturbative strategy _ : to avoid the computational cost of the optimal sequential strategy , we develop an approximate perturbative strategy defined as follows .",
    "related perturbative calculations are treated in @xcite .",
    "+ let us represent the eigen equation for @xmath0 as @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the @xmath2-dimensional eigenvector of @xmath3 corresponding to @xmath0 .",
    "the eigenvector @xmath25 is normalized such that @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the @xmath7th element of @xmath25 .",
    "the eigen equation after the removal of node @xmath7 is given by @xmath28 where the changes in @xmath3 , @xmath0 , and @xmath25 induced by the removal of node @xmath7 are denoted by @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 , respectively . because @xmath3 is symmetric , the displacement matrix @xmath29 is given by @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 . because the @xmath7th component of @xmath35 is equal to zero , we write @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the unit vector for the @xmath7th component and @xmath38 is an @xmath2-dimensional vector . by multiplying the normalized left eigenvalue @xmath39",
    "( @xmath40 denotes the transpose ) from the left of eq .  , we obtain @xmath41 we assume that the absolute value of each element of @xmath38 is smaller than that of @xmath42 .",
    "then , by ignoring @xmath43 in eq .   and substituting the expression for @xmath29 in eq .  , we obtain @xmath44 where @xmath45 indicates the neighborhood of node @xmath7 .",
    "+ in the perturbative strategy , we remove node @xmath7 that maximizes @xmath30 given by eq .  .",
    "note that carrying out one step of the perturbative strategy requires solving the eigen equation just once .",
    "therefore , the computation cost is @xmath22 , which is @xmath2 times smaller than that for the optimal sequential strategy . in the following numerical simulations ,",
    "the networks are connected during sequential node removal for all the networks and strategies .",
    "in this section , we apply the node - removal strategies introduced in sec .  [",
    "sec : methods ] to various model and real networks .",
    "first , we apply different strategies to the following types of model networks .",
    "* erds - rnyi ( er ) random graph with mean degree @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the probability that a link exists between a pair of nodes . * watts - strogatz ( ws ) model @xcite , where each node is connected to @xmath48 closest nodes on each side along the ring and a fraction , 0.3 , of links are rewired randomly .",
    "* barabsi - albert ( ba ) model @xcite , a representative growing scale - free network model .",
    "we start the growth of the network from the complete graph of @xmath49 nodes and add a node with @xmath49 links one - by - one according to the preferential attachment .",
    "we obtain @xmath50 , degree distribution @xmath51 , and low clustering .",
    "* holme - kim ( hk ) model @xcite , a growing scale - free network model .",
    "the algorithm of the hk model is similar to that of the ba model .",
    "the difference is that , when a node is added , the preferential attachment is used with a certain probability , which we set as 0.5 . with the remaining probability ( _ i.e. _ , 0.5 )",
    ", we use the so - called triad formulation rule to enhance clustering .",
    "we obtain @xmath50 , degree distribution @xmath51 , and high clustering .",
    "* goh model @xcite , a nongrowing scale - free network model .",
    "we assign the weight @xmath52 to each node @xmath7 .",
    "then , we select a pair of nodes with the probability proportional to @xmath53 and connect them .",
    "we repeat this procedure until we obtain the desired mean degree @xmath54 .",
    "we obtain @xmath51 .    for each network model , we assume two values of @xmath54 . for each case",
    ", we carry out sequential node removal according to different strategies .",
    "because , in stepwise node removal , the optimal sequential strategy is usually an efficient way , we will mainly evaluate the effectiveness of the other strategies using the performance of the optimal sequential strategy as a baseline .",
    "the numerical results obtained for the networks with @xmath55 averaged over 10 trials are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "figures  [ fig:1](a)(1 ) and 1(a)(2 ) show the values of @xmath0 after removing a fraction of nodes for two er random graphs with different values of @xmath54 .",
    "the fraction of the removed nodes is denoted by @xmath56 . for each strategy , @xmath0 increases slightly in the early stages ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath57 ) .",
    "then , @xmath0 starts to decrease even for the optimal sequential and perturbative strategies , which are designed to maximize @xmath0 .",
    "surprisingly , in the network with larger @xmath54 ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1](a)(2 ) ) , the optimal sequential strategy is not as efficient as the other strategies as @xmath56 increases .",
    "this is possible because the optimal sequential strategy finds the stepwise best strategy and does not take into account the performance after multiple nodes are removed . the perturbative strategy remains more efficient or as efficient as the optimal sequential strategy when @xmath56 is large .    for the ws model with different mean degrees ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1](b)(1 ) and 1(b)(2 ) ) , the optimal sequential and perturbative strategies outperform the heuristic degree - based and betweenness - based strategies . as in the case of the er random graph ,",
    "the perturbative strategy is as efficient as the optimal sequential strategy .",
    "the performances of the perturbative strategies are also good among the competitive strategies for different scale - free network models ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1](c)(1 ) , 1(c)(2 ) , 1(d)(1 ) , and 1(d)(2 ) ) . in goh model(fig .",
    "[ fig:1](e)(1 ) and 1(e)(2 ) ) , thought it is not better than the degree - based strategy , the perturbative strategy is better than the optimal sequential strategy except for in the early stage ( _ i.e. _ @xmath58 ) in the goh model with the smaller degree ( fig .  [ fig:1](e)(1 ) ) .",
    "note that for the three scale - free network models , @xmath0 continues to increase even until half the nodes are removed .",
    "changes in @xmath54 and the standard deviation of the degree with node removal according to the perturbative strategy are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1](a)(3 ) , 1(a)(4 ) , 1(b)(3 ) , 1(b)(4 ) , 1(c)(3 ) , 1(c)(4 ) , 1(d)(3 ) , 1(d)(4 ) , 1(e)(3 ) , and 1(e)(4 ) .",
    "the direction of changes in @xmath54 and that of the standard deviation of the degree depend on the network model .",
    "for example , in the goh model , nodes with small degree are preferentially removed in general , especially for small @xmath56 ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1](e)(3 ) ) .",
    "however , the removed nodes are not generally those with the smallest degrees ; the degree - based strategy performs relatively poorly ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1](b)(1 ) , 1(b)(2 ) , 1(c)(1 ) , 1(c)(2 ) , 1(d)(1 ) , 1(d)(2 ) , 1(e)(1 ) , and 1(e)(2 ) ) .",
    "in contrast , in the er , ws , ba , and hk models , the perturbative strategy removes nodes with appropriately large degree ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1](a)(3 ) , 1(b)(3 ) , 1(c)(3 ) , and 1(d)(3 ) ) .",
    "similarly , the perturbative strategy increases @xmath0 by increasing the heterogeneity of degree in the ws model ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1](b)(4 ) ) and by decreasing the same heterogeneity in the other four network models ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1](a)(4 ) , 1(c)(4 ) , 1(d)(4 ) , and 1(e)(4 ) ) .",
    "these show that the perturbative strategy adapts itself for each network .",
    "next , we compare the efficiency of different strategies on larger networks ( @xmath59 ) . we exclude the optimal sequential strategy because the large @xmath2 hinders its implementation . in this set of numerical simulations , we are mainly concerned with the performance of the perturbative strategy .",
    "the numerical results obtained on the basis of 5 realizations of each network are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] .",
    "these results are qualitatively the same as those obtained for the smaller networks shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "the perturbative strategy enhances @xmath0 more efficiently than the other heuristic strategies except in er models .",
    "in addition , the behavior of the perturbative strategy can not be simply captured by the changes in @xmath54 or the standard deviation of the degree , which is again qualitatively the same as the results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "we apply the proposed strategies to the largest connected component of the following real networks : the _ c.  elegans _ neural network @xcite , _",
    "e.  coli _ metabolic network @xcite , e - mail social network @xcite , and macaque cortical network @xcite .",
    "we ignore the direction of links in the _ c.  elegans _ neural network and the macaque cortical network , both of which are originally directed networks . in the _ c.  elegans _ neural network , two neurons are regarded to be connected when they are connected by at least one chemical synapse or gap junction .    the efficiency of different strategies on these real networks is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] .",
    "the perturbative strategy enhances @xmath0 more efficiently in all the tested real networks than the degree - based and betweenness - based strategies . except in the case of the _ e.  coli _ metabolic network , which is too large for the optimal sequential strategy ,",
    "the results for the optimal sequential strategy are shown as well ( fig .",
    "[ fig:3](a ) , [ fig:3](c ) , and [ fig:3](d ) ) .",
    "the perturbative strategy performs roughly as well as the optimal sequential strategy in these networks .",
    "one can alternatively enhance @xmath0 by rewiring links @xcite . in the rewiring strategy",
    ", we sequentially rewire links to increase @xmath0 . in each step",
    ", we examine the increase in @xmath0 for all the possible patterns of single - link rewiring and adopt the one that increases @xmath0 by the largest amount . to compare the performance of the node removal and the rewiring , we carry out numerical simulations using the er and ba models with @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "we simulate the rewiring process just once for each network because the rewiring strategy is computationally costly .    the change in @xmath0 relative to the initial value during the rewiring process is shown in fig .  [ fig:4](a ) .",
    "@xmath0 is enhanced up to about 1.7 fold for both networks .",
    "the corresponding results for the sequential node removal according to the perturbative strategy are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:4](b ) . roughly speaking ,",
    "the performance of the perturbative strategy is comparable to that of the rewiring strategy .",
    "the perturbative strategy is superior to the rewiring strategy for the er model and vice versa for the ba model .",
    "because the rewiring strategy is computationally costly and may be too demanding to be implemented in some real applications , the node removal according to the perturbative strategy seems to be a feasible choice for enhancing @xmath0 .",
    "when deriving the perturbative strategy , we crucially assumed that @xmath38 is negligible as compared to @xmath62 .",
    "we justify this assumption as follows .",
    "a node that is removed according to the perturbative strategy tends to have large @xmath30 and a small degree .",
    "if the removed node has a small degree , the number of the nonzero entries of the corresponding @xmath63 is relatively small .",
    "therefore , a relatively small number of the entries of @xmath25 would be directly affected by the node removal , and we would obtain a small @xmath38 .",
    "to probe the validity of this assumption and quantify the error in estimating @xmath64 , we measure two kinds of relative estimation error during the course of sequential node removal according to the perturbative strategy .",
    "the first quantity is the average of @xmath65 over node @xmath8 ( @xmath66 , @xmath67 ) , where @xmath7 is the index of the removed node .",
    "the second quantity is the difference between @xmath64 obtained from the perturbative strategy and the actual @xmath64 , which is normalized by the actual @xmath64 .",
    "we take averages of these quantities over 200 generated networks having @xmath55 .    for the five network models , @xmath65 for @xmath68 and @xmath69",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:5](a ) and [ fig:5](b ) , respectively .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath38 relative to that of @xmath70 is sufficiently small .",
    "the relative estimation error in @xmath64 for the removed nodes is shown for @xmath68 and @xmath69 in fig .  [ fig:5](c ) and [ fig:5](d ) , respectively . as expected , the relative estimation error in @xmath64 is generally small . we conclude that , up to our numerical efforts , the perturbative strategy does not suffer from a crucially large error .",
    "we explored efficient strategies to sequentially remove nodes of networks in order to increase or maintain a large value of the spectral gap ( _ i.e. _ , second smallest eigenvalue of the laplacian matrix ) of the undirected and unweighted network .",
    "we introduced a perturbative strategy among others . for a variety of networks ,",
    "this strategy generally performed well as compared to heuristic strategies in which we sequentially remove the nodes with the smallest degree or the smallest betweenness centrality . in most of our numerical results , the spectral gap increased until the removal of a fairly large fraction of nodes ( @xmath1 50% ) . occasionally , the perturbative strategy is even more efficient than the optimal sequential strategy , despite its decreased computational cost .",
    "although we focused on unweighted networks , the extension of the perturbative strategy to the case of weighted networks is straightforward .    in chaotic dynamical systems on networks ,",
    "synchronization is often facilitated by a small value of @xmath71 , where @xmath0 and @xmath72 are the second smallest eigenvalue and the largest eigenvalue of the laplacian matrix , respectively .",
    "dynamics whose synchronizability is determined by @xmath73 belongs to the class iii @xcite ( also termed type i @xcite ) . in contrast , we have been concerned with the synchronization of the class ii @xcite ( also termed type ii @xcite ) dynamics in which synchronization is facilitated in networks with large @xmath0 . to address class iii or type i synchronizability , we developed the perturbative strategy for minimizing @xmath73 upon the removal of nodes and assessed its efficiency on some model networks .",
    "however , the results were generally poor ( results not shown ) .",
    "the perturbative strategy failed mainly because it does not accurately estimate the change in @xmath72 .",
    "the applicability of our results is limited to class ii or type ii dynamics .",
