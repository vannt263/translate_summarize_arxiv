    "figures * 7 * and * 8 * show similar behavior as obtained for standard scalar field during logamediate era , i.e. , increasing @xmath99 leads to decreasing @xmath65 trajectories . in this case ,",
    "the red curve in both graphs matches ( i.e. , for @xmath117 ) which is not physical value of @xmath112 according to wmap7 data .",
    "we conclude that the inflationary universe model remains incompatible with wmap7 data for standard and tachyon scalar fields both in intermediate and logamediate scenarios .",
    "thus accelerating expansion of the universe can not be achieved by using gccg inflationary universe model in both intermediate and logamediate regimes .",
    "it is worth mentioning here that all the results for intermediate regime with standard and tachyon scalar fields reduce to @xcite . our results for this model support the results of @xcite that this model is less effective as compared to mcg and other de models .",
