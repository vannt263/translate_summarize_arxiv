    "an attractive hypothesis for the fundamental nature of dark energy is quintessence  a scalar field evolving in a non - zero potential energy @xcite .",
    "such modelling has proven highly successful in implementing inflation models in the early universe .",
    "it has however met with much less success in the present universe , primarily due to the difficulty of obtaining equations of state close enough to the cosmological constant value @xmath0 to satisfy observational bounds @xcite .",
    "one strategy is to ensure that the quintessence energy density starts at such a low value that the field only begins evolving close to the present , but such tuning is hardly more satisfactory than a cosmological constant .",
    "the alternative is for the field to evolve significantly , ideally exploiting a ` tracker ' behaviour rendering the late - time evolution almost independent of initial conditions .",
    "unfortunately however this is viable only for very particular potentials : amongst monotonic potentials , exponentials do not give acceleration and power - laws can give negative enough @xmath1 only for exponents well below 2 . among the potentials regarded as giving satisfactory phenomenology ,",
    "many in fact feature a minimum tuned to match the observed value of the cosmological constant .    in this paper",
    "we investigate whether this situation might be alleviated by allowing the quintessence to arise from several fields , which we assume to have the same potential energies .",
    "while our interest is primarily phenomenological , we note that such situations may arise from higher - dimensional theories ; in fact there are many dynamical modulus fields in string theory corresponding to the size of compactified dimensions . in the context of early universe inflation ,",
    "such a set of fields has been shown to give the phenomenon of _ assisted inflation _",
    "@xcite , whereby they may collectively drive inflation even if each individual field has too steep a potential to do so on its own , i.e.  yielding an effective equation of state closer to @xmath2 .",
    "it is therefore worth considering the possibility of assisted quintessence behaviour , in order to see whether it may be better able to match observations .",
    "assisted quintessence is particularly attractive in the context of tracking models , as each field will separately converge onto the tracking solution making it entirely natural that they all play a dynamical role .",
    "in this paper we will investigate some aspects of assisted quintessence , mostly restricting ourselves to the simplest case where each field has the same potential and always assuming there are no interactions between fields .",
    "the most closely - related paper is that of blais and polarski @xcite , who analyzed several multi - field quintessence models both analytically and numerically , though with a different focus directed mainly at attempting to realize models where the acceleration is a transient phenomenon .",
    "we will primarily study the exponential and inverse power - law cases in detail , in the former case considering different exponents for the two potentials as already extensively analyzed by coley and van den hoogen @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will also provide an algorithm for relating assisted quintessence to an equivalent single - field model under more general circumstances .",
    "our scenario is distinct from two types of scenario already extensively investigated in the literature .",
    "one is the double exponential potential models of refs .",
    "@xcite , where there was only a single field ( ref .",
    "@xcite briefly mentioned a multiple - field case but not with uncoupled fields ) .",
    "another is the two - field models of dark energy which have received some attention recently as a way of crossing the cosmological constant boundary ( @xmath2 ) to give rise to a phantom behaviour at late times @xcite . unlike our case",
    ", at least one of those fields must have a negative kinetic energy .",
    "if one accepts the possibility of multiple fields , particularly sharing the same form of potential @xmath3 , then the idea of assisted quintessence emerges very naturally provided the potentials have tracker solutions for at least some values of the fields .",
    "tracker solutions arise when the fields are initially sub - dominant as compared to a perfect fluid , the field contribution to the friedmann equation then being neglected to give equations of the form @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the hubble rate , @xmath6 is the planck mass and a dot denotes the derivative with respect to a cosmic time @xmath7 . here the fluid density @xmath8 might for instance be broken up into matter and radiation components @xmath9 and @xmath10 . in this set - up",
    ", the scalar fields are completely unaware of each other s existence ( their normal channel of communication being via the friedmann equation ) , and hence separately evolve onto the tracker solution in response to the fluid . at sufficiently - late times",
    "one would therefore have all the @xmath11 equal to each other , and hence of equal potential energy .",
    "for an individual field @xmath12 with potential @xmath13 , whether or not there is tracking behaviour can be determined from the value of the function @xmath14 where a prime represents the derivative in terms of @xmath12 .",
    "solutions converge to a tracker provided that it satisfies @xmath15 where the equation of state is @xmath16 , the interesting case however being @xmath17 which is required for the field energy density to grow relative to the fluid allowing eventual domination @xcite .",
    "the convergence of different fields to the same tracking solution does not in itself amount to assisted quintessence , as the fields are not generating any gravitational effect on the background evolution .",
    "the convergence does however set up the initial conditions for such a behaviour .",
    "what is mainly of interest is what happens once the energy density of the fields , all evolving together , is no longer subdominant , and that is the situation addressed in the rest of this paper .",

    "the stable late - time attractor is either scalar - field dominated ( case 3 or 5 ) or a scaling solution ( case 4 or 6 ) depending on the relative values of @xmath80 and @xmath28 @xcite . once a second field is added , the new degrees of freedom always render those solutions unstable .",

    "field 1 is in solid and field 2 dashed .",

    "as the universe evolves , more and more fields would join the assisted quintessence attractor , reducing @xmath93 .",
    "eventually , this could switch the attractor from the scaling regime @xmath86 into the regime of late - time scalar field dominance @xmath94 @xcite .",

    "in fact , if we compare the two - field scenarios with a single - field scenario in which an accelerated expansion occurs at late times ( @xmath106 ) , we find that typically the two - field models give a larger present value of @xmath1 ( here @xmath1 is the equation of state of scalar fields including the contribution of both @xmath107 and @xmath108 )",
    ". figure  [ fig2 ] compares a two - field model with @xmath109 and @xmath101 against a single - field model with @xmath102 , in both cases with the field with slope 1 starting with a low value and coming to dominate only at the present epoch ( the ` thawing ' regime as according to ref .",
    "we see that the equation of state of the thawing field alone is indeed closer to @xmath110 at the present ( identified as when the matter density is 0.3 of critical ) than in the single - field case , but the combined @xmath1 of the two fields is larger .",
    "we now consider the inverse - power law case @xmath111 , where we will take the same exponent and normalization for each field . here",
    "one might hope that the assisted phenomenon would give rise to an effective @xmath112 which is smaller than the individual @xmath113 , so that observationally - viable models can be achieved in steeper potentials than the single - field case .",
    "unfortunately that turns out not to be true , as we now see .",
    "these potentials are favoured because they exhibit tracker solutions , and it is therefore legitimate to suppose that after some early time we can take @xmath114 .",
    "the friedmann and scalar wave equations become @xmath115 where @xmath116 is the number of fields .",
    "this is not yet equivalent to a single - field model , but can be made so ( loosely following the method of ref .",
    "@xcite ) by the redefinitions @xmath117 which then gives the equations of a single - field model with potential @xmath118 .",
    "this rescaling indicates that the assisted behaviour renormalizes the amplitude of the potential in this case , but does _ not _ renormalize its exponent . in such models",
    "the amplitude has to be adjusted in order to give the present - day value of the matter density @xmath119 , and having done that the multi - field system then has identical dynamics to the single - field model , in particular predicting the same present - day value of the equation of state @xmath1 .",
    "we end with a more general construction for analyzing assisted quintessence , extending the analysis of the previous section to the case where the potential is arbitrary , but the same for all fields .",
    "again we assume tracking behaviour so that we can take @xmath120 , giving @xmath121 \\,,\\\\ \\ddot{\\phi } & = & - 3 h \\dot{\\phi } - \\frac{{{\\rm d}}v}{{{\\rm d}}\\phi } \\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] to find an equivalent single - field system , we first note that the kinetic term in the friedmann equation forces the correspondence @xmath122 the equations can then be transformed into single - field form with potential @xmath123 which obviously has the desired effect in the friedmann equation , but which also renders the fluid equation into single - field form .",
    "this formula therefore represents an algorithm for finding a single - field potential @xmath124 which will generate the same evolution as multiple fields evolving together in the potential @xmath125 .    for simplicity",
    ", we henceforth consider the two - field case , though the generalization is straightforward .",
    "the correspondence then is @xmath126 this allows us to ask what condition would have to be satisfied in order to have no assisted behaviour , i.e.  for @xmath124 and @xmath125 have the same functional form apart from an overall constant .",
    "this happens for potentials obeying the condition @xmath127 for all @xmath128 , where @xmath129 is a constant .",
    "the general solution to this equation is @xmath130 where @xmath131 is any function periodic in @xmath132 with period @xmath133 ( i.e.  a fourier series with this periodicity ) .",
    "while this can be any of an infinite class of potentials , having such a periodicity is clearly artificial .",
    "the only interesting case therefore is @xmath131 equals a constant , giving the power - law potential .",
    "this proves that the inverse power - law potentials are the unique monotonic potentials which do _ not _ exhibit assisted quintessence behaviour . in all other cases ,",
    "the equivalent single - field potential has a different functional form . in the exponential case",
    "this algorithm correctly reproduces eq .",
    "( [ lameff ] ) for the case @xmath134 .    as a final point ,",
    "we note that under the correspondence eq .",
    "( [ e : alg ] ) , the tracking parameter @xmath135 is equal to @xmath136 ( the primes here being derivatives wrt the arguments @xmath128 and @xmath12 respectively ) .",
    "as one would expect , the tracking conditions on the multi - field model and its single - field dynamical equivalent are the same .",
    "we have studied various aspects of assisted quintessence dynamics .",
    "such dynamics arises naturally if there are several fields with the same potential , provided the potential exhibits tracking behaviour for at least some stage of its early evolution .",
    "our most powerful result is eq .",
    "( [ e : alg ] ) , which provides a general algorithm for finding a single - field model which mimics the dynamics of a multi - field assisted quintessence model . applied to inverse power - law models , it shows that they are the unique ( monotonic ) potentials for which there is no assisted behaviour , the collection of fields behaving as a single field in the same potential ( up to overall normalization ) .",
    "all other potentials will exhibit assisted behaviour , the exponential potential being an explicit example .",
    "it should be possible to extend our analysis to the case of more general dark energy models in which the lagrangian includes non - canonical kinematic terms , such as the tachyon , k - essence and ghost condensate . for theories",
    "whose lagrangian @xmath137 is a function of the field @xmath12 and @xmath138 , the existence of scaling solutions restricts the form of lagrangian to be @xmath139 , where @xmath140 is an arbitrary function and @xmath80 is a constant @xcite",
    ". it would be certainly of interest to investigate whether the assisted behaviour we found for the canonical scalar field with an exponential potential persists in such general dark energy models .",
    "it is interesting that the multi - field system can be analyzed so simply .",
    "regrettably , however , we have not uncovered any scenarios where the assisted quintessence phenomenon appears to improve the situation with regard to the observations .",
    "in fact our results show the contrary ; in potentially the most interesting scenario of the inverse power - law it turns out that there is no assisted quintessence effect .",
