    "implementing quantum information processing devices requires precise knowledge of quantum open systems .",
    "the detailed study of quantum open systems are often prevented by a limitation of analytical or numerical resources to probe systems with large degrees of freedom . the first principle calculation of open quantum systems based on projection operators@xcite or influence functionals@xcite has been developed and applied to numerous problems@xcite . reduced dynamics obtained by these methods",
    "follows non - markovian evolution carrying the memory of environment .",
    "solving the equations of motion obtained by these method directly is generally difficult to deal with as they are given by integro - differential equations .",
    "various approximation schemes have been used to simplify the exact evolution to study open system evolution .",
    "most commonly used approximation is born approximation in which the system - bath interaction is treated perturbatively .",
    "however , naive born approximation applied to quantum open systems does not guarantee the positivity of the density matrix and requires a caution particularly when evaluating quantities sensitive to this aspect such as quantum entanglement .    for a weak system - bath interaction , bath",
    "is disturbed by the interaction only in a small amount and tends to reset to the original state in a short time compared to the system time scale .",
    "the correlation among the bath variables may become negligible compared to the system time scale . in a born - markov approximation , the bath correlation is ignored . at sufficiently low temperature , however , the bath memory can persist for a long time and this approximation is expected to break down .",
    "regardless of the temperature , the noise with long range correlation such as 1/f noise can not be treated under this approximation .",
    "1/f noise is ubiquitous causing a problem in implementing a quantum circuit using electronic instruments in solid state , ion trap , or hybrid molecular devices .",
    "decoherence in a nonequilibrium bath@xcite also shows a peculiar behavior which is significantly different from the one under markov approximation .",
    "further approximation such as rotating - wave approximation is commonly used with born - markov approximation . there",
    "we assume weak system - bath interaction such that a coupling becomes only among near resonant modes .",
    "we further ignore counter rotating terms since they are expected to be averaged out during a sufficiently long observation time .",
    "the rotating - wave approximation is thus not suitable for describing short time dynamics in a strong coupling regime",
    ".    quantum entanglement , manifestation of intrinsic nonlocality in quantum mechanics@xcite , now became one of the most active research topics in quantum information science .",
    "it also has been a long historical issue as the discrepancy between quantum and classical mechanics is a serious obstacle to understand macroscopic classical and quantum mechanics from the view of microscopic quantum dynamics@xcite .",
    "conversely but for the same reason , to manipulate quantum systems in order to be useful in the macroscopic world is a formidable task .",
    "recent progress in this direction is motivated by rapid progress in quantum technology , where there is a demand for a precise control of small quantum devices .",
    "quantum entanglement is considered to be a valuable resource for practical applications such as quantum computation and communication@xcite .",
    "many works have been devoted to clarify the rigorous criteria for entanglement . for continuous variables ,",
    "the necessary and sufficient criteria for entanglement can be given in terms of peres - horodecki criteria@xcite , negativity@xcite , and entanglement of formation@xcite .",
    "most of these works are devoted to study the static properties of general pure and mixed states . in light of information processing , it is also desirable to study the dynamical properties based on the realistic models in an open system setting .",
    "quantized harmonic oscillators have been playing an important role in a history of quantum mechanics .",
    "realization of quantum protocols based on continuous variables such as quantum teleportation@xcite and quantum key distribution@xcite show that they also play the similar crucial role in quantum information science .",
    "realization of the similar protocols based on solid state devices is a highly formidable task since the disturbance from environment in solid state systems is much stronger than in optical systems .",
    "so far the studies of continuous variables for open systems are based on the master equation under born - markov rotating wave approximation such as lindblad equations@xcite or the phenomenological model with high temperature markovian bath@xcite .",
    "applications of these methods are limited to the high temperature regime or slow dynamics with ohmic noise , while actual solid state implementation operates at low temperatures manipulated with fast pulses and often suffers from 1/f noise .",
    "most of the solid state implementation of quantum information devices operate in a ultra - cold temperature in order to maintain quantum coherence . for instance , typical superconducting qubits operate less than @xmath0$]@xcite . at ultra - cold temperatures , the memory effect in the environment variables",
    "is no longer negligible .",
    "the system - environment interaction in solid state devices is typically much stronger than those qubits based on atom - optical devices .",
    "these conditions are opposite to those where the born - markov approximation is applicable .",
    "thus we need to develop the method to probe the regime beyond the conventional born - markov approximation .    born and rotating wave approximations are limited to weak coupling regime and do not guarantee the positivity of the density matrix evolution . since separability criteria is based on the positivity of the density matrix , a caution is required to study entanglement under these approximations .    in the present paper ,",
    "we study the precise mechanism of open system entanglement dynamics based on a brownian oscillator model@xcite , where both system and environment consist of harmonic oscillators .",
    "since our model is formally exactly solvable , it makes us possible to probe the precise dynamics of entanglement without conventional approximations .",

    "it also has a nice property as an entanglement monotone such that it does not increase under local operations and classical communications . the logarithmic negativity @xmath135 defined as @xmath136 also has the similar property . since diagonalization of @xmath94 brings the original state into the thermal state , the partial transposed density matrix after the same transformation also has the thermal form that can be written as a function of the symplectic invariants @xmath137 as @xmath138 for separable states , @xmath139 .",
    "thus @xmath140 and @xmath141 follows . for entangled states , @xmath142 but @xmath143 .",

    "this disentanglement time scale @xmath151 measured this way is the same as the time when the uncertainty relation for the partial transposed state recovers ( the lower curve in fig .",
