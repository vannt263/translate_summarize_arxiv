    "the standard model(sm ) of electromagnetic and strong interactions has been well established through precision measurements of a large variety of observables in high - energy experiments@xcite .",
    "however , there is still one missing part of the sm to be confirmed by experiments , i.e. the higgs boson . in order to search for those missing parts and also for direct signals beyond the sm ,",
    "the lhc experiments@xcite are under construction at cern .",
    "though lhc has employed a proton - proton colliding machine due to a view of the discovery potential for new ( heavy ) particles , a capability for precision measurements must also be seriously considered . for extracting physically meaningful information from a large amount of experimental data , including huge qcd backgrounds ,",
    "a deep understanding of the behavior of qcd backgrounds is essentially important .",
    "the prediction power of a lowest calculation of qcd processes is very limited due to a large coupling constant of the strong interaction and an ambiguity of the energy scale .",
    "predictions based on the nlo ( or more ) matrix elements combined with some all - order summation is desirable .",
    "much effort to calculate nnlo corrections@xcite is being made for lhc experiments .",
    "moreover , in order to match with the experimental requirements for precision measurements , a simple correction factor ( so - called @xmath0-factor ) for the lowest calculation is clearly not sufficient",
    ". one must construct event generators including nlo matrix elements with higher order re - summation even for processes with multi - particle final states .",
    "when one tries to do this task , one may encounter the following difficulties :    * the number of diagrams contributing to processes with many particles in a final state is very large , * any numerical instability in the treatment of a collinear singularity must be taken care of , * a careful treatment of matching between matrix elements and the re - summation part must be required to avoid double counting , and * any negative weight of events in some part of phase space is not avoidable .    in order to overcome these difficulties , lots of work",
    "has already been done@xcite . in this report",
    ", we propose a new method to construct event - generators with next - to - leading order qcd matrix - elements and leading - logarithmic parton showers .",
    "our solution for the above problems , except for the last one , will be given in this report .",
    "a treatment of the negative weight will be presented elsewhere .",
    "a calculation of the matrix elements of hard - scattering processes is not such a simple task when multiple partons are produced . at the tree level , the grace system@xcite , which is an automatic system for generating feynman diagrams and a fortran source - code to evaluate the amplitude , is established .",
    "the system can in principle treat any number of external particles , and has been used for up to six fermions@xcite in the final state within a practical cpu time . in the grace system ,",
    "matrix elements are calculated numerically using a chanel@xcite library based on a helicity amplitude .",
    "chanel contains routines to evaluate such things as : wave - functions / spinors at external states , interaction vertices , and particle propagator .    for the loop amplitude ,",
    "effective vertices of two- and three - point functions have been prepared@xcite and implemented in the system . here ,",
    "we employed the @xmath1 scheme@xcite for renormalization and dimensional regularization@xcite for treating soft / collinear singularities . for more than three - point diagrams , an extended chanel is prepared .",
    "it can evaluate a fermion current including any number of gamma matrices .",
    "an amplitude of loop diagrams will be numerated based on the fermion current connected by boson propagators .",
    "when a fermion loop is included in the diagram , numeration will be performed after taking its trace .",
    "a bosonic loop can also be treated by the chanel .    for a loop integral of four - point functions , general formulae of the tensor integral",
    "are prepared and implemented in a library . for more than four - point functions ,",
    "a reduction formula@xcite is used in the system .",
    "the calculations of cross sections for proton-(anti ) proton collisions are usually performed as follows@xcite :    1 .",
    "matrix elements of a given process at a parton level are prepared , 2 .",
    "a probability to observe a parton in a proton at given energy scale and momentum fraction is obtained from some parton distribution function(pdf)@xcite , 3 .",
    "a numerical integration is performed in phase - space with some initial energy distribution in the pdf , 4 .   for initial - state partons , a ( backward )",
    "parton shower@xcite is applied from the given ( high ) energy scale to a low energy - scale of partons , 5 .   for final - state partons ,",
    "a parton shower is also applied from a given energy scale to close to the hadron energy - scale , 6 .",
    "some non - perturbative effects according to string fragmentation or color clustering are taken into account , and 7 .",
    "physical hadrons are formed based on some hadronization model .    in this method , the parton shower(ps )",
    "is used in a supplementary way , just for generating multi - partons with a finite transverse momentum .",
    "the parton shower is a method to solve a dglap evolution equation@xcite using a monte carlo method .",
    "the pdf s are also obtained by solving the dglap equation with experimental data - fitting . when an initial distribution of partons is given at some energy scale ,",
    "the ps can reproduce a consistent result as the pdf",
    ".    the pdf can give the weight of partons when the momentum fraction ( @xmath2 ) and the energy scale are given by the users .",
    "on the other hand , in the forward evolution scheme of the ps , the momentum fraction of a parton ( @xmath2 ) is determined only after evolution takes place .",
    "this method is very inefficient , for instance , for a narrow - resonance production . in order to cure this inefficiency ,",
    "we have developed an @xmath2-deterministic ps . in a monte - carlo procedure in the ps ,",
    "the @xmath3 evolution is controlled by the sudakov form - factor , which gives a non - branching probability of partons , and the @xmath2 determination is done independently according to a splitting function .",
    "it is not necessary to determine the @xmath2 value at each branching .",
    "after preforming all branching procedures using the sudakov form - factor , the @xmath2 value at each branching is determined to give a total @xmath2 , being a given value from outside of the ps . in this ps , each event has a different weight according to the splitting functions and initial distribution of the pdf .",
    "however , if we employ an appropriate transformation of the input random numbers , we can expect a sufficient efficiency with a weight close to unity .    for singlet partons",
    ", we employ an evolution scheme based on momentum distributions rather than those on particle - number distributions .",
    "this scheme has been proposed by tanaka and munehisa@xcite and shows numerically stable results with high efficiency .",
    "a numerical test of the @xmath2-deterministic ps is done by comparing results with the pdf , cteq5l@xcite .",
    "the initial distributions of partons are taken from cteq5l at the energy scale of the @xmath4-quark mass . then , after evolution to an energy scale of 100 gev , the @xmath2 distributions from the ps are compared to those in cteq5l .",
    "one can see in fig.[qcdps ] the ps reproduced @xmath2 distributions in cteq5l for both of singlet and non - singlet partons .",
    "our procedure to generate qcd events involves the following three steps ,    :    1 .",
    "numerical integration is performed in the phase - space including @xmath2 integration , 2 .",
    "the probability for the existence of each parton in the proton at some low - energy scale is obtained from the pdf , and 3 .",
    "the @xmath2-deterministic ps performs evolution from a low energy scale to the energy scale of a hard scattering while generating multi - partons with a finite transverse momentum ,    instead of steps 2 , 3 , and 4 in the conventional procedure .",
    "at first , the conventional method of phase - space slicing is used to treat soft and collinear singularities .",
    "it is explained for the case of an initial - state radiation in this report .",
    "the final - state radiation can be treated in a similar way .",
    "let s consider two colored partons , whose momenta are @xmath5 and @xmath6 , scattered into the @xmath7-body final state of colorless particles as a born process .",
    "for the radiative correction of this process , we must treat processes with one additional colored parton , whose momentum is @xmath8 , emitted in addition to the born process .",
    "the matrix elements of the real emission processes must be integrated in ( @xmath7 + 1)-body phase - space , @xmath9 , in a @xmath10-dimensional space - time .",
    "the space - time dimension is set to be @xmath11 in this report . a collinear region in the ( @xmath12)-body phase - space of the final particles in the @xmath10-dimensional space - time",
    "is defined as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is some cut - off value .",
    "it must be sufficiently small so as not to be observed experimentally .",
    "a final result must be independent of this value . in the collinear region ,",
    "matrix elements can be approximated as @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a splitting function for a given parton splitting at a leading - logarithmic order , and @xmath17 is the transverse momentum of the radiated parton and @xmath18 the energy scale of the splitting .",
    "the cm - energy of the born process is @xmath19 , where @xmath20 . here",
    ", we can set @xmath10 to be four in the matrix element of the born process , since it has no ir singularity . in the same approximation ,",

    "the ir - divergent terms in the collinear cross section can be canceled out after summing up terms from virtual corrections . even after combining with virtual corrections , there still exists the ir - divergent term , @xmath30 .",
    "this term is thrown away by hand , since it is counted in the pdf or ps on the initial partons .",
    "the collinear remnant in the visible region ( @xmath31 ) gives large * negative * values when the threshold energy ( @xmath32 ) is sufficiently small .",
    "this large negative number will be compensated by the large * positive * cross section of real - emission processes .",
    "we propose to combine @xmath31 with exact matrix elements of the real emission processes before the phase - scape integration .",
    "it will be discussed later in this report .",
    "the last part of the nlo cross - section calculation is a real emission of the additional parton into the visible region with exact matrix elements .",
    "those matrix elements of ( @xmath7 + 1)-parton production at the final state in four - dimensional space - time can be automatically generated using the grace system .",
    "cross sections are obtained by integrating those matrix elements under the four - dimensional phase - space as @xmath33 the space - time dimension is set to be four ( @xmath34 ) hereafter , since there is no ir - divergence in @xmath23 . when the threshold energy ( @xmath32 ) is set to be sufficiently small",
    ", this cross section can be larger than the born cross section due to the largeness of the coupling constant ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "a parton - level calculation has no problem , except for this largeness of the higher order correction .",
    "however , if one tries to calculate the cross sections of a proton ( anti-)proton collision , one has to combine the matrix elements with the pdf or ps to construct a proton from partons .",
    "the pdf and ps include leading - log(ll ) terms of the initial - state parton emission .",
    "if one combines the matrix element with the pdf or ps very naively , one can not avoid double - counting of these ll - terms . our proposal to solve",

    "\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the second term of the integrand is the ll - approximation of the real - emission matrix - elements under the collinear condition . there is nothing but @xmath31 in the last subsection .",
    "this ll subtraction method can cure not only the double - counting of ll - terms in the real - emission part , but also any large cancellation between the collinear remnant and the real - emission correction . when the threshold value is set to be sufficiently small",
    ", the integrand in @xmath37 is very close to zero , because the ll - approximation is very precise around the collinear region .",
    "then , the result of integration in @xmath37 is independent of the threshold value of @xmath32",
    ".    this subtraction may distort the experimental observables of additional jet distributions .",
    "however , a subtracted ll - part will be recovered after adding the ps applied in the born process .",
    "the exact matrix element of real - radiation processes gives only non - logarithmic terms to the visible distributions in the ll - subtraction method .",
    "the relation between the ps and the ll - subtraction method is as follows .",
    "the ll - approximation cross section in @xmath37 is @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the maximum value of the transverse momentum .",
    "@xmath40 is just the first term of the all - order re - summation of the leading logarithmic terms in the ps .",

    ", this integration is performed up to the energy scale determined by the born process .",
    "then , if @xmath43 is subtracted in the full phase space of the ( @xmath7 + 1)-particle final state , some part of the ll cross section can not be recovered from the born cross - section with the ps . then , an appropriate restriction on the phase - space integration must be applied , such as @xmath44 ,   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath45 is the energy scale of the born process",
    "the ll - subtraction method is numerically tested for a process of @xmath46 in proton - anti proton collision at the cm energy of 2 tev . here only non - singlet @xmath47-quark is used in this test this test to avoid an additional complexity .",
    "matrix elements of the born process and the real radiation process ( @xmath48 ) are generated by grace .",
    "numerical integration is done using a bases@xcite system .",
    "a non - singlet @xmath47-quark distribution at the energy scale of 4.6 gev is taken from cteq5l . the parton evolution from this energy scale to that of hard - scattering ,",
    "i.e. an invariant mass of the muon - pair ( @xmath49 ) , is done using the @xmath2-deterministic ps for both of the born and radiative processes .",
    "an additional cut of @xmath50 gev is also applied .",
    "the distributions of transverse momenta of gluons are shown in figure  2 .",
    "for the born process , the largest @xmath17 from the ps is filled to histograms if it has a @xmath17 greater than 1 gev . for the radiative process , that from matrix elements is filled when it has passed the same cut as mentioned above . if one does not take care of double - counting of the ll - terms in the matrix elements and the ps , the distributions of @xmath51 show larger values compared with the ps in the born process , as shown in the left histogram of figure  2 . in order to avoid double - counting",
    ", we required that @xmath17 of the matrix elements be greater than those of any gluons from the ps in the radiative process .",
    "this double - counting rejection has a good agreement of the @xmath17 distribution around the low-@xmath17 region , as shown in the middle histogram .",
