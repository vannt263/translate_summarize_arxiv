    "+ although the transport properties have been intensively investigated both theoretical and experimentally , the persistent current problem remains less understood . in 1983 bttiker , imry and landauer , following earlier work by byers and yang on superconducting rings @xcite , proposed the existence of such currents in one dimensional mesoscopic loops in the presence of weak magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "these equilibrium currents are a consequence of the nature of the eigenfunctions and their flux sensitivity , which is strictly of the aharonov - bohm type .",
    "the current is a periodic function of the magnetic flux with fundamental period @xmath0 . in ideal clean rings at 0 k ( * ballistic regime * )",
    "the current is proportional to @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the fermi velocity and @xmath3 is the length of the loop . on the other hand , in the diffusive regime ( when impurities are present and the elastic mean free path _",

    "the problem of persistent currents did not deserve much attention until recent years when experimental measurements have been performed on metallic rings in the diffusive regime @xcite and in a few - channel mesoscopic semiconductor ring @xcite .",
    "for the metallic systems , the experimental value of the current is @xmath5 , 1 or 2 orders of magnitude greater than the theoretical predictions consistent with diffusive motion , that is with no apparent corrections due to disorder .",
    "the value of the current reported by mailly and collaborators on the mesoscopic ring , is also of the order of @xmath6 , but in their experiment @xmath7 .",
    "+ owing to the discrepancies between the observed and predicted values of the current , much of the theoretical efforts were put to find a mechanism which could compensate the effect of impurities .",

    "the existence of many channels implies that , opposite to what happens for 1d geometries , crossings between levels of different channels occur for @xmath98 .",
    "+ employing the expansion given by eq.([fiteo ] ) , the total current for the @xmath8 electrons system can be written as : @xmath99 where the coefficients @xmath100 , and the coefficients @xmath101 have alternated signs .",
    "the sum extends to all the filled levels @xmath8 .",
    "the total current has two contributions , the first term which has an explicit linear dependence on @xmath42 and the second one without explicit dependence on the flux .",

    "[ figure3 ] shows the total current which looks like a sawtooth . between two succesive crossings the curve is a linear function with the same positive slope in each interval .",
    "the negative jumps in @xmath83 are for values of the flux * @xmath102 * where crossings between states occurs .",
    "this qualitative behavior can be understood as follows .",
    "let us suppose that a given state is occupied before a crossing and empty after it .",
    "this corresponds to replace in the eq.([ct ] ) one value of @xmath103 by another one . as @xmath104 , the last replacement gives essentially the same slope .",
    "on the other hand , the second term is strongly affected because a positive value of @xmath105 is replaced by a negative one , and this produces a significative * negative * change in the value of the non homogeneous term of @xmath83 .",
    "let us remark that between two adjacent @xmath102 s there is another crossing at @xmath106 that is irrelevant for @xmath83 .",
    "we denote @xmath107 the total number of crossings at the positions @xmath108 . as it will be clarified in the following sections , the features of the crossings between levels are strongly related to the shape and the magnitude of the total and typical currents .",
    "we devote this section to establish some relevant properties of the crossings between states for integrable hamiltonian systems that depend on a single parameter . following the semiclassical expansion for the density of states developed by berry and tabor for integrable systems @xcite",
    ", we have started writting the density of crossings per unit of energy and flux ( for a given value of the parameter @xmath51 ) as @xmath109 @xmath110 is the average density of crossings ( where the average is taken over energy and flux ) and @xmath111 is the fluctuating part .",
    "we have demonstrated that @xmath112 and is independent of @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "therefore the average number of crossings that a given level @xmath50 has between @xmath98 is @xmath113 .",
    "moreover , @xmath114 fig .",
    "[ figure4 ] shows @xmath115 vs. @xmath50 , @xmath115 being the number of crossings of the level @xmath50 , for @xmath52 and @xmath116 , together with the ensemble average @xmath117 taken on a range @xmath118 .",
    "the best power fit to @xmath117 is @xmath119 with @xmath120 , in strong agreement with our theoretical prediction .",
    "it is interesting to note that while the number of channels scales as @xmath121 ( see eq.([efs ] ) ) , the mean number of crossings for the highest occupied level is proportional to @xmath84 .",
    "that means that on average , the last occupied level experiments as many crossings as there are channels present in the system .",
    "the higher fluctuations observed in the fig .",
    "[ figure4 ] correspond to the apparition of a state with @xmath122 ( at @xmath123 ) in the energy region considered . +",
    "another important result concerns the way in which the crossings for a given level @xmath50 are distributed in the interval @xmath124 .",
    "we define the normalized nearest neighbour spacing as @xmath125 , where @xmath126 denotes the position of the crossing @xmath80 .",
    "[ figure5 ] shows the nearest neighbour spacing distribution @xmath127 , obtained after an exhaustive numerical computation .",
    "this results in a poisson distribution as can be checked in the mentioned figure , where the numerical result is displayed along with the exact poisson distribution .",
    "in other words , for a given level @xmath50 with @xmath115 crossings , the corresponding @xmath128 can be seen as a sample of @xmath115 uncorrelated random variables in the interval @xmath124 .",

    "such distributions of the spacings determine the fluctuations of the typical current , as we will show in the forthcoming section . +",
    "at this point we have all the ingredients to quantify the way in which the distribution of crossings determines the scaling of the typical current with the number of particles present in the system @xmath8 .",

    "<S> in the present article we perform analytical and numerical calculations related to persistent currents in 2d isolated mesoscopic annular cavities threaded by a magnetic flux . </S>",
    "<S> the system considered has a high number of open channels and therefore the single particle spectrum exhibits many level crossings as the flux varies . </S>",
    "<S> we determine the effect of the distribution of level crossings in the typical persistent current .     </S>"
