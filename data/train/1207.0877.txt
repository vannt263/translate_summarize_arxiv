    "in wireless networks , it is always beneficial for the nodes to know the global knowledge of channel state information ( csi ) , e.g. , channel gain or link loss probability , since global information can greatly ease the network optimization and improve the performance .",
    "generally , such csi on a connected link can be regarded as a local information and known between two connected nodes ( e.g. , node @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) . however , for a _ third - party _ node , e.g. , the node @xmath2 , the channel information of link @xmath3 is unknown to it . in some network design ,",
    "such third - party information communication @xcite is often necessary .",
    "recently , cooperative data exchange among the users @xcite becomes one of the most promising approaches in designing efficient data communications .",
    "in cooperative data exchange , each client initially holds a subset of packets , which are broadcast from the server or locally generated by itself .",
    "the objective is to guarantee that all the clients finally obtain the whole packets by cooperatively exchanging the data .",
    "recent works showed that network coding @xcite can reduce the number of transmissions or delay required for cooperative data exchange .",
    "however , finding the optimal solution with network coding to minimize the number of transmissions @xcite or the transmission cost @xcite is non - trivial for general cooperative data exchange problem .    the work in @xcite designs a coded cooperative data exchange scheme to minimize the number of transmissions for third - party information exchange . compared with general cooperative data exchange problem , in third - party information exchange",
    ", each client initially has the local csi to all other connected clients , and wants to know all csi knowledge that is unknown to it .",
    "the work in @xcite showed an optimal transmission scheme to minimize the total number of transmissions for exchanging third - party information .",
    "although the work in @xcite gives the optimal solution to minimize the total number of transmissions required for third - party information exchange , it does not consider the case where each client is associated with a transmission cost , as studied in @xcite .",
    "consider a three - client network as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.thirdparty ] , where @xmath4 denotes the csi between client @xmath0 and client @xmath1 .",
    "it is assumed that the links are symmetric , i.e. , @xmath5 .",
    "initially , client @xmath0 knows only the local information @xmath4 for @xmath6 . without considering the cost , client @xmath7 and client @xmath8 may be selected to transmit the encoded packets @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively , to complete the data exchange process . however ,",
    "if we consider the cost given as @xmath11 , selecting client @xmath8 and @xmath12 as the transmitters is a better choice than the former solution in terms of the total transmission cost .        in this paper",
    ", we design an algorithm to determine the number of packets that each client should send and how the packets should be encoded for each transmission , so as to minimize the total transmission cost required for the third - party information exchange problem .",
    "similar to the previous works @xcite , we consider there is a common control channel which allows reliable broadcast by any client to all the other clients . the main contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows :    * we derive a necessary and sufficient condition for a feasible transmission scheme such that there exists a code design for every client to successfully decode all the packets from other clients . * based on the necessary and sufficient condition for feasible transmission , we formulate the problem of minimizing the total transmission cost as an integer linear programming . *",
    "our analysis shows that the clients with lower transmission costs should send more packets than the clients with higher transmission costs .",
    "* we analyze the probability that every client can decode all other packets when random linear network coding is locally performed at each client .",
    "the rest of the papers are organized as follows .",
    "the problem is formulated in section  [ sec.assumption ] .",
    "section  [ sec.solution ] derives the necessary and sufficient condition for a feasible transmission scheme . in section  [ sec.cost ] ,",
    "we give the optimal solution with the minimum transmission cost and analyze the performance with random network coding .",
    "we conclude the paper in section  [ sec.conclusion ] .",
    "consider a network with @xmath13 clients in @xmath14 , where each client @xmath15 is associated with a transmission cost @xmath11 for sending a single packet .",
    "suppose that @xmath4 is the csi ( e.g. , channel gain or link loss probability ) of the link between client @xmath16 and client @xmath17 .",
    "initially , each client @xmath16 only knows the local csi , i.e. , client @xmath16 only holds the packets in @xmath18 .",
    "we assume that the links are symmetric , i.e. , @xmath5 for @xmath19 .",
    "in other words , for every two clients @xmath16 and @xmath20 , they hold one common packet @xmath4 .",
    "thus , the set of all the packets is @xmath21 .",
    "suppose that @xmath22 is the total number of the packets in the network , i.e. , @xmath23 .",
    "there is a lossless broadcast channel for clients to send or receive the packets @xcite .",
    "each transmitted packet is encoded over the packets initially held by the sender .",
    "let @xmath24 be the number of packets required to be transmitted by client @xmath16 .",
    "the total transmission cost can thus be written as @xmath25 in this paper , our goal is to find a network coded transmission scheme that satisfies the following two conditions :    * each client @xmath15 can finally decode all the packets in @xmath26 from the packets sent by other clients via broadcast channel . * the total transmission cost @xmath27 defined in eq .",
    "( [ objective.cost ] ) is minimum among all the transmission schemes that satisfy the first condition .    without loss of generality",
    ", we use @xmath28 to denote the set of  wanted \" packets by client @xmath15 , i.e. , @xmath29 .",
    "we also assume that the clients in @xmath30 are ordered with the non - decreasing order of the transmission cost , i.e. , @xmath31 .",
    "although the work in @xcite already proposed a feasible transmission scheme , which can complete the third - party information exchange process with minimum transmissions , it is a special case of our problem , where it does not consider the transmission cost . in this section , we aim to derive a necessary and sufficient condition for a feasible transmission scheme , such that there exists a feasible code design for every client to successfully decode its  wanted \" packets",
    ". then , based on the derived condition , we can give the transmission scheme to minimize the total transmission cost in section  [ sec.cost ] .",
    "in this section , we define the encoding matrix of the transmitted packets . before sending the packets , each client first generates a linear encoded packet based on the packets it initially has over a finite field .",
    "then , the @xmath32-th encoded packet sent by client @xmath16 can be written as a linear combination of packets in @xmath33 , i.e. , @xmath34where @xmath35 is the coefficient selected for packet @xmath4 by the @xmath32-th encoded packet of @xmath16 over finite field @xmath36 .",
    "the encoding vectors sent by all the clients can then be written as follows .",
    "@xmath37 in the above encoding matrix @xmath38 , each column vector denotes the encoding vector of a transmitted packet , and each row vector represents how a native packet is encoded in the transmitted packets .",
    "for example , the first column vector denotes the encoding vector of packet @xmath39 sent by client @xmath7 , while in the first row vector , if the element is non - zero , it means the packet @xmath40 is participated in the encoded packet represented by that column . let @xmath41 be the encoding vector of the packet @xmath42 , which is of size @xmath43 .",
    "for example , @xmath44 .",
    "thus , @xmath45^t$ ] .    without loss of generality , for each client , we define a local receiving matrix as follows .    the local _ receiving matrix _ of client @xmath0 , named @xmath46 , is defined as the sub - matrix of @xmath38 , which includes almost all the rows and columns of @xmath38 except the followings :    * the rows , which represent the encoding status of native packets in @xmath33 ; * the columns , which represent the encoding vectors of packets sent by client @xmath0 .",
    "thus , a row vector of @xmath46 denotes how a  wanted \" packet of client @xmath0 is encoded in the received packets .",
    "for example , @xmath47 does not include the first @xmath48 rows of @xmath38 , as the first @xmath48 rows represent how the native packets in @xmath49 participate in the received packets , and does not include the first @xmath50 columns of @xmath38 , as these @xmath50 columns denotes the packets sent by client @xmath7 .",
    "thus , @xmath46 is a @xmath51 matrix including the encoding vectors received by client @xmath16 .",
    "we use @xmath52 to denote the @xmath53-th row vector of local receiving matrix @xmath46 .",
    "we first investigate the condition , under which there exists a code design for a receiving matrix with full row rank .",
    "we define _ coefficient element _ as the element in a row encoding vector @xmath54 , which is non - zero and is selected over @xmath36 .",

    "let @xmath57 be a general @xmath58 receiving matrix , where @xmath59 and @xmath60 is the @xmath0-th row vector of @xmath61 .",
    "we then give the necessary and sufficient condition that there exists a code design to ensure the rank of @xmath62 is @xmath63 as follows .",
    "[ lemma_matrix ] there exists a code design such that the rank of the receiving matrix @xmath64 is @xmath63 , if and only if for any @xmath65 row vectors in @xmath66 , the size of @xmath67 is at least @xmath65 , where @xmath68 .",
    "we first prove the necessary condition , where we assume that there exists a code design such that the rank of the local receiving matrix @xmath64 is @xmath63 .    according to this assumption , for a matrix @xmath61 ,",
    "we can find at least a set of @xmath63 coefficient elements which are selected from different rows and different columns .",
    "in other words , for @xmath63 rows , the size of @xmath69 is @xmath63 .",
    "in addition , as the number of rows of matrix @xmath61 is @xmath63 and the rank of @xmath61 is @xmath63 , each row vector should be linear independent with each other .",
    "hence , it means for each sub - matrix of @xmath61 with @xmath65 rows , its rank is the number of rows it includes , i.e. , @xmath65 .",
    "so , in any @xmath65 rows @xmath70 , we can find at least a set of @xmath65 coefficient elements which are selected from @xmath65 different rows and @xmath65 different columns , i.e. , @xmath71 .",
    "thus , the necessary condition is proved .",

    "then , considering the second row vector of @xmath61 , there must be at least a coefficient element , whose column number is not @xmath74 , since @xmath75 .",
    "we then select such a column @xmath76 in @xmath77 , where @xmath78 .",

    "we can then design the feasible code as follows .",
    "considering the elements in the @xmath32-th row vector of @xmath82 , only the coefficient element located in the @xmath83-th column is assigned with non - zero , while the other coefficient elements that are in other columns of row @xmath32 are assigned with zero .    according to the above coefficient assignment",
    ", the determinant of matrix @xmath82 can be expressed as the product of @xmath63 non - zero elements from different rows and different columns , e.g. , in the @xmath32-th row , the non - zero element located in column @xmath83 is selected . since the determinant of matrix @xmath82 is non - zero , the rank of @xmath82 is thus @xmath63 . correspondingly , the rank of @xmath61 is also @xmath63 .",

    "we can easily obtain that more than @xmath93 clients involve in the defined set .",
    "this is because , for any @xmath93 clients , the number of packets held by them , but not held by any other client is at most @xmath94 .",
    "thus , for @xmath92 packets , we still need at least another one client to include the extra packet . in other words , at least @xmath32 clients are needed , i.e. , @xmath95 .    we then consider @xmath96 . as in the above case , more than @xmath93 clients involve in the defined set .",
    "the worst case is that @xmath65 packets are only held by @xmath32 clients but not held by any other clients , e.g. , packets in @xmath97 are only held by clients in @xmath98 . in this case , only @xmath32 clients can involve these @xmath65 packets in their encoded packets , i.e. , @xmath99 .",
    "when @xmath100 , we can also similarly prove that at least @xmath32 clients are needed , by just considering @xmath65 packets in @xmath97 .",
