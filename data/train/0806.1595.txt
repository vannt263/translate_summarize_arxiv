    "an electron traversing a path enclosing magnetic flux acquires an additional phase by the magnetic vector potential .",
    "this additional phase causes the aharonov - bohm ( ab ) oscillation of the electronic magnetoconductance@xcite with the period of @xmath3 .",
    "the ab oscillation in solid state devices was first observed by webb _ et al._@xcite and timp _ et al._@xcite in metal and semiconductor ab rings , respectively .",
    "especially , ab rings fabricated on the two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) layer formed in a semiconductor heterojunction structure like gaas / algaas have been studied intensively , because the electron phase coherence in this system extends much longer than the size of an ab ring .",
    "for instance , a structure of a quantum dot embedded in one arm of an ab ring was employed recently for accurate measurements of the phase change of traversing electrons through a quantum dot .",
    "_ et al.__@xcite first demonstrated that the electron transport through a quantum dot embedded in a closed - loop ab interferometer was phase coherent .",
    "however , the phase rigidity , imposed by the onsager relation in the two - terminal geometry of an ab ring , hampered measurements of the genuine phase variation through the quantum dot.@xcite later on , schuster _ _ et al.__@xcite measured the phase evolution via a resonant level of a quantum dot embedded in an open - loop ab interferometer , which allowed multi - terminal conductance measurements , while breaking the time - reversal symmetry of the system . many other phase measurements through various quantum structures",
    "were followed by using the open - loop ab interferometer.@xcite although open - loop ab interferometers are more useful for measuring the phase of the embedded quantum structures , closed - loop ab interferometers are still in often use because of a simpler theoretical interpretation of the results .",
    "detailed studies on closed - loop interferometers , however , often revealed beats in its ab magnetoconductance oscillation .",
    "@xcite beats were first explained in terms of mixing of different multiple transverse sub - band modes arising from a finite width of a ring.@xcite the transverse sub - band modes , with the conductance of @xmath4 per mode , are the quantum states defined by the transverse potential in the interferometer , which can be tuned by the voltages applied to the gates , _",
    "i.e. _ , quantum point contacts .",
    "this model , however , failed to explain the appearance of beats in the conductance with a single transverse sub - band ( stsb ) mode , which was observed by the same group.@xcite later , tan _ et al._@xcite pointed out that the clockwise and the counterclockwise moving electron states in an stsb mode may generate different ab - oscillation frequencies , producing the beats reported in refs .",
    "8 and 10 . in the meantime",
    ", similar beating effect was observed in the ab interferometry using two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) [ two - dimensional hole gas ( 2dhg ) ] systems based on strong spin - orbit interaction ( soi ) materials such as inas and ingaas [ gaas ] heterojunctions.@xcite it was interpreted as the evidence for the revelation of the berry phase @xcite caused by the strong soi . in this case , the fourier spectrum of the beat pattern showed multiple splitting of the @xmath3 peak .",
    "et al._@xcite and meijer _",
    "et al._@xcite showed clear splitting of the @xmath3 peak into multiple peaks in the ensemble - averaged fourier spectrum over several measurements for a fixed and varied gate voltage(s ) , respectively .",
    "they attributed the splitting to the berry - phase @xcite pickup by the traversing electrons due to the soi .",
    "et al._@xcite and yang _",
    "et al._@xcite also observed the multiple splitting of a single fourier - spectrum peak and the evolution of the spectrum for varying magnetic fields .",
    "based on the numerical simulation , the authors also attributed them to the result of the berry - phase pickup .",
    "all these works , however , did not consider the effect of possible mixing of multiple conducting channels .    in this study , we investigated the behavior of the magnetoconductance from a closed - loop ab interferometer fabricated on a gaas / al@xmath0ga@xmath1as heterostructure 2deg , with a very weak soi .",
    "the magnetoconductance always revealed clear beats of ab oscillations .",
    "the corresponding fourier spectrum exhibited multiple peaks closely spaced around the field value where the @xmath3 peak was expected .",
    "the patterns were very similar to those observed previously from the ab rings fabricated on strong soi materials . to interpret our observation of the beats in our system with a very weak soi , we simulated two - dimensional ( 2d ) ab ring using the method adopted by tan _",
    "_ et al.__@xcite in the simulation , even in a fixed transverse sub - band mode , additional eigen - modes existed to contribute to the electron transport as a function of the fermi level and a magnetic field .",
    "for the remainder of this paper these modes will be referred as longitudinal modes .",
    "these modes were found to evolve in different ways depending on the geometry and thus induce beats of ab oscillations in a 2d interferometer .",
    "we were able to explain all our results in terms of the formation of the 2d multiple longitudinal modes in an stsb without resorting to the strong - soi effect .",
    "in fact , measurements of the weak localization ( wl ) and the shubnikov - de haas ( sdh ) oscillation in our system revealed that the soi was almost negligible . in our observation",
    "the @xmath2 periodicity was noticeable only around the nodes of the beats .",
    "in addition , the nodes of the beats formed a parabolic distribution for varied voltages applied to one of the loop - forming side gates , which was not observed in the previous studies.@xcite these two general features of our data were in accordance with the prediction of the 2d multiple - longitudinal - modes effect in an stsb .",
    "figure 1 shows a gate - defined closed - loop ab interferometer , fabricated on a wafer of gaas / al@xmath0ga@xmath1as heterostructure 2deg .",
    "the electron density of the 2deg was about @xmath5 @xmath6 with the mobilities higher than @xmath7 @xmath8 v@xmath9s@xmath9 at 4.2 k. the 2deg layer resided 70 nm below the surface of the wafer .",
    "the interferometer was defined by an island gate , four side gates , and two quantum - dot gates as shown in the figure .",
    "the shape of this structure is similar to the one reported previously.@xcite the electron path inside the interferometer was defined by tuning negative voltages to these gates . unlike a closed - loop interferometer defined by the mesa formation ,",
    "@xcite the number of transverse conducting channels ( sub - bands ) in each ( left or right ) arm could be fine - tuned by the six side gates .",
    "this was a big advantage over mesa - defined ab rings , where the existence of multiple transverse sub - bands was inevitable in practice . in our study , the number of transverse sub - bands for each path was kept close to or below one to avoid any possible interference among electrons from different transverse sub - bands .",
    "the quantum dot embedded in the interferometer in fig .",
    "1 was not formed during measurements of beats , despite the physical presence of the gates to form it in the sample .",
    "all the measurements were made at the base temperature of 10 mk in a dilution fridge . the corresponding electron temperature estimated from measurements of the coulomb blockade in the quantum dot @xcite was around 140 mk .",
    "the standard phase - sensitive lock - in technique was employed to improve the signal to noise ratio .",
    "the ab magnetoconductance oscillations were taken by observing the current between the two ends ( the source and the drain ) of the ab ring in an excitation voltage of 10 @xmath10v rms . for measurements of the wl and the sdh oscillation ,",
    "a four - probe configuration was employed , where a 15-na rms current was applied between the source and the drain while monitoring the corresponding voltage difference .",
    "the magnetoconductance of the interferometer at various voltages of side - gate 1 ( @xmath11 ) was measured by applying a 10-@xmath10v - rms excitation voltage to the interferometer , while monitoring the source - drain current .",
    "the magnetic field was swept in the range between -1500 g and 1500 g , while the @xmath11 was varied from -271.35 mv to -291.15 mv at intervals of 1.65 mv . since the conductance for any @xmath11 was lower than",
    "@xmath4 it was assumed that less than an stsb @xcite was open for each path of the interferometer .",
    "since the visibility of the ab oscillation was about 2% the background current level was subtracted for clarity . as shown in fig .",
    "2(a ) the field dependence of the conductance exhibits clear beats of ab oscillations for any values of @xmath11 .",
    "in addition , the phase evolved discontinuously in the variation range of @xmath11 .",
    "this phenomenon of the rigid phase has been observed by others@xcite and interpreted by the onsager relation in a two - terminal closed - loop interferometer.@xcite the relation stipulates that the electronic conductance through a closed - loop interferometer should be symmetric with respect to the @xmath12=0 axis , allowing only 0 or @xmath13 phase . as a result , the phase change occurs only by @xmath13 via a double - frequency ( @xmath2 period ) ab oscillation regime.@xcite the expected phase change in a one - dimensional ( 1d ) closed - loop interferometer , with an stsb per path without considering finite width of the electron path , is shown in fig .",
    "2(b ) . as in the figure",
    ", the phase stays unaltered for the variation of the fermi energy ( @xmath14 ) in the leads until it suddenly changes by @xmath13 .",
    "the simulation also suggests that the frequency of the ab oscillation doubles with @xmath2 periodicity between the transition of the two phase states . for a 1d closed - loop interferometer , with an stsb in each arm",
    ", this transition should occur at the same @xmath14 in all magnetic fields .",
    "in other words , as in fig .",
    "2(b ) , the transition region should be in parallel with the @xmath12-field axis . in our measurements",
    ", however , the transition region distributes rather parabolically in the @xmath11-vs-@xmath12-field plot [ fig .",
    "these features were reproducible even after thermal recycling .",
    "10 and 14 report the existence of @xmath2 period in the beats of ab oscillations , but without this parabolic distribution .",
    "similar behavior was observed with the variation of the source - drain bias voltage .",
    "a parabolic distribution of the transition regions was also observed when the voltage of the island gate was varied , while fixing the voltages for all the other gates used to form the interferometer .",
    "such a beating effect without the parabolic distribution of the @xmath2 transition region mentioned above has been observed in various systems like metallic ab rings,@xcite gaas / algaas 2deg ab rings,@xcite gaas / algaas 2dhg rings,@xcite inas - based@xcite and ingaas - based@xcite 2deg rings .",
    "although the beating features are similar to each other , interpretations of the origin of the beats are varied .",
    "two main models suggested to explain the beats are based on picking up the berry phase induced by the soi and mixing of multiple conducting channels caused by the finite width of an ab ring involved .",
    "the berry - phase - related interpretation of the beats is favored for the ab rings formed on the relatively strong soi systems like gaas / algaas - based 2dhg , and inas - based and ingaas - based 2deg s .",
    "in contrast , the model of mixed multiple conducting channels is favored for ab rings in metallic films and gaas / algaas - based 2deg s with relatively small soi.@xcite    to estimate the strength of the soi in our system , both the wl and the sdh oscillation were measured on an identical sample that was used to measure the beats .",
    "fitting the anti - localization dip in the magnetoresistance for strong soi materials leads to resolving the soi strength.@xcite by contrast , the soi gives two different frequencies for the sdh oscillation .",
    "it results in beats in the sdh oscillation , allowing one to estimate the soi strength .",
    "@xcite figs .",
    "3(a ) and 3(b ) illustrate the magnetoresistances of the wl and the sdh oscillation , respectively , measured in a hall - bar geometry formed on our sample .",
    "all the gates in the interferometer were grounded during the measurements .",
    "3(a ) shows the magnetoresistance averaged over 37 measurements with the field resolution of 0.2 g , which exhibits no discernible anti - localization dips .",
    "3(b ) shows the measured sdh oscillation , without any beats , either .",
    "these results strongly imply that the soi was very weak or almost negligible in the gaas / al@xmath0ga@xmath1as heterostructure 2deg of our interferometer .",
    "although it is known that metallic gates may enhance the strength of the soi , the enhancement is usually less than 30@xmath15 of the original value.@xcite we thus expect that the soi caused little effect on our magnetoconductance measurements .      in our measurements , only an stsb was set to open in each arm .",
    "the beats of ab oscillation for the stsb conduction were experimentally observed previously,@xcite where the beats were theoretically interpreted in terms of mixing of clockwise and counterclockwise moving states of electrons with different frequencies @xcite in an stsb mode .",
    "we employed the model as used in ref . 9 to simulate the beats and the evolution of their transition region as a function of @xmath11 .",
    "the result indicates that the multiple longitudinal modes existing in an stsb mode generate the ab oscillations .",
    "however , the multiple longitudinal modes give more than two oscillation frequencies , with the number of the oscillation frequencies varying with the magnetic field , due to the finite width of the electron path inside the interferometer .",
    "the magnetic field dependence will be discussed in the next section in more detail .",
    "we adopted the same form of shrdinger equation as used in ref .",
    "9 , but with varied parameter values to fit our experimental conditions .",
    "the eigenvalues are    @xmath16    where @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath10 is the effective mass of the electron , @xmath20 is the transverse confinement strength of the gates defining the electron path , and @xmath21 is the average radius of the interferometer . here ,",
    "the quantum number @xmath22 is the transverse sub - band index and @xmath23 is related with the longitudinal motion.@xcite in our measurements , we tuned the interferometer to have an stsb , corresponding to @xmath22=0 . in fig .",
    "4(a ) , the energy band @xmath24 is shown for an stsb mode with @xmath25 and @xmath2630 .    as shown in fig .",
    "4(a ) , several conducting modes exist even for an stsb mode because of the existence of multiple longitudinal modes .",
    "the corresponding energy eigenvalues depend on @xmath23 as well as @xmath22 . for this dependence ,",
    "the dispersion of the bands is asymmetric about the band minima .",
    "the minima shift to higher energies for nonzero magnetic fields,@xcite which result in breaking of the discrete symmetry under the translation along @xmath12-axis .",
    "as indicated by filled ( open ) circles in the figure , this makes band crossing ( splitting ) points respond nonlinearly to the applied magnetic field .",
    "4(b ) is an expanded band diagram of the region in the dashed box in fig .",
    "the band - splitting points show a clear downturn curvature as represented by open circles , the shape of which is very similar to that of the conductance with the @xmath2 period in fig .",
    "the conductance for a given fermi energy @xmath14 in the dashed - box region in fig .",
    "4(a ) was calculated using the landauer - bttiker formula@xcite    @xmath27 ^ 2 + { \\gamma}^2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where only @xmath25 is taken into account and the transmission probability via an eigen mode is given by the breit - wigner formula at zero temperature . here , @xmath28 is the coupling constant between the emitter ( or the collector ) and the ab ring .",
    "the @xmath28 was set at 3% of @xmath29 , which corresponds to a weak coupling regime of the system .",
    "the calculated results are shown in fig .",
    "the conductance shows a clear beat pattern with a variation of the envelope as a function of @xmath14 .",
    "5(b ) shows similar behavior observed experimentally for varied @xmath11 .",
    "the figures indicate that the @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) oscillation predominates in the nodes ( antinodes ) of the beats .",
    "the region of dominant @xmath2 oscillation appears in different magnetic fields as @xmath14 is varied .",
    "a grey - scale plot of the calculated conductance is shown in fig 6 . the @xmath14 was set to the range in the dashed square box in fig .",
    "the band shown in fig .",
    "4(b ) is overlapped on the grey - scale plot by white solid lines .",
    "contrary to the results calculated for an stsb in a 1d interferometer as in fig .",
    "2(b ) , the region where the nodes of the beats appear shows an @xmath2 oscillation and distributes parabolically in an @xmath14-vs-@xmath12-field plot .",
    "this result is in qualitative agreement with our observation shown in fig .",
    "clearer revelation of the double frequency region in the simulation may be from smaller @xmath28 value and higher visibility of ab oscillations than those in the measurement .",
    "the parabolic evolution of the node region can be naively understood with the band diagram shown in fig .",
    "4 . according to eq .",
    "( 2 ) the overall conductance through an ab ring is determined mainly by the bands located close to @xmath14 .",
    "hence , if @xmath14 is at a crossing point of two bands ( marked by a filled circle in the figure ) the @xmath3 oscillation becomes predominant .",
    "by contrast , the @xmath2 oscillation predominates if @xmath14 is at a band splitting point marked by an open circle in the figure .",
    "the conductance itself is bigger for @xmath3 oscillation , since two longitudinal modes simultaneously contribute to the conductance , while a single longitudinal mode contributes to the conductance for @xmath2 oscillation .",
    "this is the reason why @xmath3 ( @xmath2 ) oscillation is dominant in the antinodes ( nodes ) . since these band crossing ( splitting )",
    "points evolve parabolically as a function of @xmath14 and @xmath12 , the antinodes ( nodes ) also evolve in the same fashion .",
    "it should be emphasized that the finite width of the electron path in an ab interferometer is responsible for the parabolic evolution of the band crossing points . according to our simulation , however , a parabolic evolution with an upturn curvature is also possible in different regions of @xmath14 ( not shown ) .",
    "similar experimental result was also observed in a different region of the gate voltages .    the beat feature similar to fig .",
    "5 was reported in mesa - defined closed - loop ab interferometers,@xcite with the results interpreted in terms of 2d multiple - longitudinal - modes effect@xcite in an stsb . in these works , however , no parabolic evolution of the beat pattern was reported .",
    "the parabolic evolution gives an additional confirmation of the validity of the model and better understanding of the 2d multiple - longitudinal - modes effect in an stsb .",
    "observing the smooth evolution of the node region was possible in our study , because the number of transverse sub - bands was fine - controlled by the six individual gates , rather than by a single gate covering the whole mesa - defined ab ring as used in the other measurements .",
    "we tuned all the gates individually to leave an stsb open .",
    "only one gate was then slightly modified to observe such an evolution .",
    "the fourier transform analysis is a very effective way to analyze the beating of ab oscillation induced both by the multiple - conducting - channel effect@xcite and the soi effect.@xcite the fourier spectrum gives the information on different conducting channels ( or modes ) inside an interferometer with very small frequency differences . in this section",
    ", we present the fourier spectrum of two representative beats , which show the antinodes and the nodes at @xmath12 = 0 .",
    "the zero - padding technique@xcite , that was used to analyze the beats induced by the soi effect,@xcite was adopted for our fourier transform analysis .",
    "the magnetoconductance data taken in the range between -1500 g and 1500 g were used for the analysis , because sdh oscillation started to appear at around @xmath30 2000 g due to the high mobility of electrons in the sample .",
    "within this range , four different widths of the hamming window@xcite ( @xmath30500 g , @xmath30900 g , @xmath301200 g and @xmath301500 g ) were used .",
    "this allowed a close examination of any field - dependent effect .",
    "the left ( right ) panel of fig .",
    "7(a ) is the fourier spectrum for the antinode ( node ) at @xmath12=0 .",
    "these two cases show different features , but their magnetic field dependencies are similar to each other . when the antinode is at @xmath12=0 , the fourier spectrum shows a main center peak and a trace of small side peaks in a low magnetic field range . with increasing magnetic field ,",
    "the main center peak starts to split , while the side peaks become clearer .",
    "when the node is at @xmath12=0 , however , the amplitudes of the main center peak and symmetric side peaks are comparable even in a low - magnetic - field range . with increasing magnetic field in this case , the center peak starts to split , while the amplitudes of the side peaks increase .",
    "7(b ) is the fourier spectrum of the calculated magnetoconductance when an antinode and a node are at @xmath12=0 .",
    "the features are similar to those of the experimental fourier spectrum .",
    "the evolution of the fourier spectrum as a function of the magnetic field can be naively explained as follows .",
    "first , the band crossing points marked by filled circles in the figure 4(a ) give a fourier - transform peak ( the center peak ) .",
    "second , open circles marked in the figure give two fourier - transform peaks ( the side peaks ) , where one is slightly lower and another is slightly higher than the peak given by the band crossing points .",
    "these are major three peaks shown in the spectrum .",
    "the frequency difference and the field dependence of the peaks are caused by the breaking of the discrete symmetry under the translation along the @xmath12 axis .",
    "even with many energy bands around @xmath14 , the conductance is mainly determined by the bands close to @xmath14 .",
    "thus , if the data showing an antinode at @xmath31 are taken for the fourier spectrum analysis with a very narrow magnetic - field window only a center peak appears in the spectrum . as the width of the magnetic field window increases ,",
    "the nodal part is included in the analysis to produce the side peaks in the spectrum . by the same analogy ,",
    "if the data showing node at @xmath31 are taken for the analysis with a narrow magnetic field window only the side peaks appear in the spectrum . as the antinodal part",
    "is included in the analysis by enlarging the magnetic field window the center peak appears in the spectrum .",
    "these features are illustrated in fig .",
    "however , the experimental data given in the right panel of fig .",
    "7(a ) show three peaks ( a center peak and two side peaks ) even in a low - magnetic - field range .",
    "that is because the magnetic field window is wide enough to contain the antinodes as well as the node as shown in fig .",
    ".    similar evolution of fourier - spectrum peaks as a function of magnetic field was also reported in refs .",
    "13 and 14 . those were interpreted as evidences for the berry phase pickup by the soi , although the interpretation in ref .",
    "13 has been controversial.@xcite we believe that the evolution of peaks observed in the fourier spectrum as a function of magnetic fields are not a conclusive evidence of the spin - orbit coupling,@xcite since the same effect is also observable in systems with negligible spin - orbit coupling .",
    "the beats in this case can be explained by the 2d effects inside the interferometer as clearly demonstrated in our study , both in experiment and in simulation .",
    "meanwhile , the center - peak splitting and the side peaks were also observed in other magnetoconductance measurements using ab rings fabricated on strong soi materials.@xcite in these works , the splitting of the center peak was focused and regarded as an evidence for the berry - phase pickup by the soi .",
    "it was pointed out , however , that the splitting was too large to be explained by the berry phase pickup only . in the works ,",
    "the existence of the side peaks was not clearly explained , either .",
    "as shown in our data , the splitting of the center peaks in fig .",
    "7(a ) is around 0.001 g@xmath9 , which is comparable to those in refs .",
    "11 and 12 .",
    "even with almost negligible soi in our system , the features of the fourier spectrum of the measured magnetoconductance show a similarity to those found in strong - soi systems.@xcite our study demonstrates that the features in the fourier spectrum can be generated irrespective of the berry - phase pickup .",
    "the beats of ab oscillations in a closed - loop interferometer fabricated on gaas / al@xmath0ga@xmath1as 2deg were observed . unlike mesa - defined interferometers , in our measurements ,",
    "the electron path in each arm of the interferometer was kept less than a single transverse sub - band ( stsb ) by the fine control of six individual path - forming side gates .",
    "this enabled us to study the effect of the two - dimensional longitudinal modes developing in an stsb induced by the external magnetic field .",
    "our simulation indicates that the experimentally observed beats of ab oscillations resulted from the multiple oscillation frequencies induced by finite width of the interferometer even with an stsb mode .",
    "the @xmath2 ab oscillations , imposed by the onsager relation in our closed - loop two terminal geometry , appeared in the nodes of beats , while usual @xmath3 ab oscillations appeared in the antinodes , which was in agreement with our simulation results .",
    "it was also found that nodes of the beats distributed parabolically with varying the voltages of the side gates .",
    "we confirm that the phenomena can be explained by the 2d multiple - longitudinal - modes effect in the presence of an stsb , even without resorting to the strong spin - orbit interaction .",
