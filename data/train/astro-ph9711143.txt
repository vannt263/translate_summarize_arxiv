    "shortly after the discovery of quasars , it was found that the flux shortward of the redshifted ly@xmath0  emission at ( 1+z ) 1216   is depressed .",

    "optical spectroscopy at improved spectral resolution ( lynds 1971 ; sargent et al .",
    "1980 ) found that the absorption arises from numerous narrow features referred to as `` the ly@xmath0  forest '' .",
    "the lack of a smooth depression in flux ( the gunn - peterson  effect , see steidel & sargent 1987 and references therein ) has led to the conclusion that the igm is highly ionized by a metagalactic uv radiation field in the early universe ( fields 1972 ; bechtold et al .",

    "the evolution of the universe leads to density fluctuations on all scales .",
    "evolving structures produce absorption features with a column - density distribution similar to that observed in the ly@xmath0  forest .",
    "the features of the lowest column density arise in underdense portions of the igm and contribute most to the he  ii  opacity . in conventional terms , forest lines are referred to as those that can be identified with optical spectroscopy .",
    "most of them have column densities of @xmath8  or higher , and the keck hires spectra have identified absorption features as weak as @xmath9  ( hu et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "if the uv background radiation is derived mainly from quasar radiation , its euv photons are able to ionize he@xmath1 , and hence the intergalactic helium is likely to be primarily in the form of he@xmath10 ( madau 1992 ) . however , because of the high ionization level for he@xmath1 , the he@xmath1population in the igm would be significantly higher than that of h@xmath2 and may hence be more easily detected .",
    "he  ii  ly@xmath0 absorption is within the spectroscopic capability of the hubble space telescope ( _ hst _ ) for quasars with @xmath11 and of the hopkins ultraviolet telescope ( hut ) for quasars of @xmath12 .    reported a cutoff in flux shortward of redshifted he  ii  ly@xmath0  emission in the _ hst _ faint object camera ( foc ) prism spectrum of the quasar q0302 - 003 ( @xmath13 ) , with optical depth @xmath14 at 90% confidence level .",

    "the spectrum of the quasar hs1700 + 64 ( @xmath17 ) obtained with hut had previously provided a measurement of the average optical depth @xmath18 at @xmath19 ( davidsen , kriss , & zheng 1996 ) .",

    "neither of these observations , however , can resolve he  ii  ly@xmath0  forest lines , hence the observed opacity in the spectral region shortward of 304(1+z )  is a blend of absorption features arising from regions of various density .",
    "the regions with very small - scale fluctuations in the igm produce absorption features that are below the observational limit , i.e. they have with the neutral hydrogen column density @xmath20 ( @xmath21 hereafter ) . by precisely modeling the expected contribution of",
    "the observed he  ii  ly@xmath0  forest features based on measurements of the h  i  ly@xmath0forest , one can hope to disentangle the contributions of the different regions of the igm above and below the threshold column density @xmath22 .",
    "several techniques have been used to estimate the likely contribution of the observed forest lines to the he  ii  opacity .",
    "jakobsen et  al .",
    "( 1994 ) , madau & meiksin ( 1994 ) , and giroux , fardal , & shull ( 1995 ) all used the formula @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the number of lines per unit redshift and @xmath25 is the mean rest - frame equivalent width of he  ii  ly@xmath0  lines averaged over the assumed distribution in column density ( mller & jakobsen 1990 ) .",
    "this in turn is based on the optical depth for a random distribution of absorbing clouds as described by paresce , mckee , & bowyer ( 1980 ) .",
    "jakobsen et  al .",
    "( 1994 ) concluded that the he  ii  forest may not account for the observed he  ii  opacity in their spectrum of q0302 - 003 unless there is a significant population of clouds with @xmath26  .",
    "madau & meiksin ( 1994 ) and giroux et  al .",
    "( 1995 ) explored further how the forest opacity is influenced by the helium to hydrogen velocity - dispersion ratio ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "starting from a relatively high estimate of the h  i  opacity in the ly@xmath0  forest toward q0302 - 003 , they found that all the observed opacity can be attributed to forest lines with @xmath28  . a key assumption in the method upon which all these studies are based , however , is that the absorption at any wavelength is due to only a single cloud .",
    "when the minimum column density is extended much below @xmath29 , observed lines begin to overlap significantly , and this approximation breaks down .",
    "songaila , hu , & cowie ( 1995 ) used two different approaches .",
    "the first directly used their high resolution , high s / n ratio spectrum of the ly@xmath0  forest in q0302 - 003 . for a normalized spectrum of the h  i  forest with intensity given by @xmath30 , the normalized spectrum of the he",
    "ii  forest is given by @xmath31^{\\eta \\over 4}$ ] , where @xmath32 is the population ratio of he@xmath1  to h@xmath2 .",
    "the principle drawback of this elegant and rather straightforward method is that it is extremely sensitive to the s / n level and to the fitted continuum level .",
    "even at s / n = 50 , noise in the data is amplified into features in the he  ii  forest with optical depth @xmath33 if @xmath34 . with this approach , metal - line systems in the h  i  forest",
    "are also incorrectly incorporated into the predicted he  ii  opacity .",
    "their second approach used the formula developed by miralda - escud  ( 1993 ) to describe the relative opacities in the h  i  and he  ii  forest : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the power law index of the ly@xmath0  forest column density distribution .",
    "this formula is only valid , however , if the distribution includes lines that are optically thin for he  ii  as well as h  i. as we will show below , this assumption holds only if the power law distribution of the h  i  forest column densities extends to @xmath37  .",
    "previous work either claim that it can not be determined whether the observed he  ii  opacity is due to the known forest lines ( jakobsen 1996 ) , or it can entirely be attributed to them ( songaila et al .",
    "1995 ) . in this paper",
    "we present improved calculations of the line opacity produced by the he  ii  ly@xmath0  forest . to overcome the limitations of previous work",
    ", we use a monte - carlo technique to simulate the absorption spectrum of he  ii  forest .",
    "while the forest - line interpretation may not describe the physical nature of the igm , we use it to compare with the published results . under this scenario ,",
    "we explore how variations in the minimum column density , in the he@xmath1  to h@xmath2  population ratio ( @xmath32 ) and in the ratio of helium to hydrogen velocity dispersion ( @xmath38 ) affect the contribution of the known forest components to the total he  ii  opacity .",
    "our calculations yield he  ii  opacities smaller than previously estimated , and we conclude that forest lines with @xmath39  _ can not _ account for the observed he  ii  opacity with the parameters commonly assumed .",
    "to evaluate the opacity in single lines we use the standard curve - of - growth method with a voigt profile ( see press & rybicki 1993 ) .",
    "although deviations from voigt profiles are expected in recent models due to the spatial extension of the igm fluctuation , the effect is not significant for most lines .",
    "a typical physical size of such a structure is about @xmath40 mpc ( bi & davidsen 1997 ) , equivalent to 14 @xmath41  in the velocity space .",
    "this is smaller than the characteristic velocity of @xmath42 @xmath41  ( press & rybicki 1993 ) .",
    "the contributions from density wings at @xmath43  @xmath41  may become noticeable only for lines with @xmath44  .",
    "line blending due to thermal and/or turbulence velocity affect all models , and therefore voigt profiles are a fair match at the first order .",
    "the most important factor governing the he  ii  opacity is @xmath32 .",
    "for very tenuous gas ( @xmath45 ) , the he  iiabsorption decrement is proportional to the optical opacity , but it is not the case for most forest lines , due to saturation effects . for ly@xmath0  lines of equivalent width @xmath46   , the he  ii  to h  i  opacity ratio for a single feature changes very slowly with @xmath32 as both he  ii  and h  i  lines are saturated and their equivalent widths depend only weakly on the column density .    the h  i  and he  ii  curves are similar , as he@xmath1  ions are hydrogenic .",
    "the doppler parameter for helium depends on @xmath38 , which lies between 0.5 and 1.0 , depending on the nature of the line broadening .",
    "observations by cowie et al .",
    "( 1995 ) suggest @xmath47 .",
    "we will use this value in most of our calculations as the results can be scaled to suit other @xmath38 values .",
    "assuming @xmath48 , we show in fig .  1 the he  ii  to h  i  decrement ratio of a single absorption feature as a function of column density for three values of the doppler parameter @xmath49 : 20 , 30 , and 50 @xmath41 .",
    "for a typical value of @xmath50  @xmath41 , this ratio is near unity for @xmath51  . at higher densities",
    ", it increases as the damping wings contribute appreciably to the he  iily@xmath0  absorption . at lower densities",
    ", the ratio becomes high as the h  i  absorption lies on the linear part of the curve and decreases . from fig .",
    "1 we can immediately infer that the opacity of the he  ii  forest will depend strongly on the minimum column density chosen for the ly@xmath0forest .    to calculate the wavelength - averaged opacity of the he  ii  ly@xmath0  forest , we start with the standard empirical description of the h  i  ly@xmath0  forest population . the number of ly@xmath0  forest absorption features , @xmath52 , in quasar spectra may be described by @xmath53 ( ) .",
    "we adopt @xmath54 and @xmath55 from miralda - escud  & ostriker ( 1990 ) .",
    "the normalization factor @xmath56 affects the forest opacity appreciably , and it can vary depending on the particular line of sight .",
    "we choose @xmath56 to be consistent with the number of lines and the measured h  i  forest opacity for the particular quasar under study .",
    "the doppler parameter @xmath57 is assumed to follow a @xmath58-function distribution : @xmath59 where @xmath60  @xmath41  and @xmath61  @xmath41  ( press & rybicki 1993 ) .",
    "our monte - carlo method randomly generates centroid wavelengths , column densities and doppler parameters for each line in the h  i  forest according to eq .",
    "3 ( for a given minimum column density ) and the doppler - parameter distribution of eq .  4 .",
    "the voigt profiles of the selected lines are then calculated in the quasar rest frame with a spacing of 0.01    ( @xmath62 @xmath41 ) .",
    "the product of these profiles gives the total transmission of the h  iforest .",
    "the effect of line blending is naturally taken into consideration in this treatment .",
    "given the transmission of the h  i  forest we calculate the decrement @xmath63 and express the wavelength - averaged forest optical depth as @xmath64 .",
    "individual realizations of the forest opacity in this method show fluctuations of @xmath65 due to the random line blending . for each set of parameters we run 10 simulations and average the results to obtain the final opacity values .",
    "the corresponding he  ii  forest is constructed by changing the column density of each simulated line from @xmath21 to @xmath66 , and the doppler parameter from @xmath57 to @xmath67 .",
    "the average decrement for he  ii , @xmath68 , is calculated , and the wavelength - averaged optical depth is given again by @xmath69 .",
    "to illustrate our results , we present calculations for a quasar redshift @xmath70 for comparison to the hut observations of hs1700 + 64 ( davidsen et  al .",
    "we normalize the column - density distribution using @xmath71 to match the line number density measured for this quasar by rodrguez - pascual et  al .",
    "( 1995 ) and zheng et al .",
    "we use the 10501170    wavelength range ( in the rest frame ) to calculate the h  i  opacity and rest - frame wavelengths 262 - 292    for the he  ii  opacity .",
    "these wavelength ranges , free of confusion from the proximity effect and ly@xmath36 lines , has often been used to calculate the average absorption decrement @xmath72 ( jenkins & ostriker 1991 ; press , rybicki , & schneider 1993 ) .",
    "2 displays the average he  ii  forest optical depth as a function of the minimum column density for two values of redshift . the effect of changing @xmath32",
    "is shown by several curves in the upper panels of the figure .",
    "the lower panels show the sensitivity of the results to the assumed value of @xmath38 with @xmath32 held fixed at 100 .    the behavior of the he  ii  forest opacity shown in fig .",
    "2 can be qualitatively understood in terms of the he  ii  to h  i  decrement ratios illustrated in fig .",
    "the total h  i  opacity increases as the minimum column density is lowered , but it levels out at @xmath73  .",
    "this is because at low column densities h  i  absorption is proportional to the column density and becomes insignificant as lines move off the saturated portion of the curve of growth .",
    "the he  ii  opacity , on the other hand , continues to increase significantly as the minimum column density is lowered toward @xmath74  .",
    "this is because he  ii  absorption is still in the flat part of the curve of growth .",
    "the opacity ratio @xmath75 therefore becomes higher when more weak forest lines are included .",
    "note that strong lines ( @xmath76  ) produce nearly the same amount of absorption for he  ii  and h  i , but they contribute only @xmath77 of the total he  ii  opacity for @xmath78 .",
    "weak lines ( @xmath79  ) contribute @xmath80 of the total he  ii  opacity , compared with only @xmath81 for h  i.    we expect the forest opacity to increase with redshift in proportion to the number of h  i  forest clouds within the wavelength interval of interest . since @xmath82 , and @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is the rest frame wavelength interval , the he  ii  forest opacity should have a redshift - dependence of @xmath85 .",
    "to verify this we have also made calculations applicable to the quasar q0302 - 003 . to match the wavelength range used by hogan et  al .",
    "( 1997 ) to measure the he  ii  opacity in their ghrs spectrum , we use the rest - frame wavelength ranges of 1157 - 1195    and 289 - 299   for the h  i  and he  ii  forest , respectively .",
    "we normalize the column density distribution to give a total h  i  forest opacity of 0.21 ( see below ) .",
    "these results are shown in fig .",
    "2@xmath57 .    given opacities for both the he  ii  and h  i  ly@xmath0  forest , we can calculate the ratio of their average opacities , @xmath75 , as a function of the minimum column density .",
    "this ratio is shown in fig .  3 for @xmath86 .",
    "( a comparison to @xmath75 calculated for @xmath87 indicates that the behavior of @xmath75 is virtually independent of redshift over this range . )",
    "qualitatively this is to be expected , following the derivation of @xmath75 in the optically thin limit in eq .",
    "however , this relation assumes that the decrement produced by an absorption line is proportional to its central optical depth .",
    "this is only correct for optically thin lines ( i.e. , a centroid optical depth not significantly greater than unity ) and hence may not be applied to strong forest lines , which account for @xmath88 of the h  i  optical opacity . at column densities",
    "@xmath89  , for example , the value of @xmath75 is nearly unity even for @xmath90 . as shown in fig .",
    "3 , only at column densities @xmath91  does @xmath75 approach the value predicted by eq .  2 ( assuming a reasonably high value of @xmath92 ) .",
    "3 also shows that applying eq .",
    "2 at @xmath93  leads to a considerable overestimation of the he  ii  forest opacity .",
    "for comparison to previous work on the quasar q0302 - 003 , we refer to the he  ii  opacities shown in fig .",
    "2@xmath57 . for parameters typical of those used by jakobsen",

    "their calculated opacities are , approximately , 0.9 , 1.3 and 1.1 , respectively .",
    "these values are larger than ours by @xmath97 .",
    "a difference at a level of @xmath65 is due to line blending .",
    "weak lines , when blended with strong ones , do not decrease the transmission appreciably in already blank regions of the spectrum .",
    "we estimate that , at @xmath98 , @xmath65 of the spectral region is virtually blank due to the high opacity of strong lines , implying that at least @xmath65 of the he  ii  opacity from weak lines would not be realized .",
    "the rest of the discrepancy may be attributed to the normalization chosen for the distribution of h  i  ly@xmath0  forest lines ( eq .  3 ) .",

    "however , the keck spectrum of hs1700 + 64 ( zheng et  al .  1997@xmath57 ) suggests that , at @xmath132 , the number of lines with @xmath26  is considerably smaller than the extrapolation of a power law predicts .",
    "this trend is qualitatively consistent with the cold - dark - matter models ( miralda - escud  et al .",
    "1996 ; bi & davidsen 1997 ) that the distribution of forest lines flattens at lower column densities .",
    "previous work overestimated the contribution from known forest lines . assuming a column - density distribution for the h  i  forest with a power - law index @xmath54 , a he@xmath1  to h@xmath2  population ratio @xmath94 and velocity dispersion ratio @xmath48",
    ", we calculate a he  ii  opacity produced by the observed forest lines that is @xmath133 the h  i  opacity . this can account for about half of the",
    "observed he  ii  opacity along the sight line to the quasars hs1700 + 64 . for q0302 - 003 ,",
    "the lower limit to the he  ii  opacity set by the observation is at least @xmath134 the h  iopacity , making it more difficult to explain in terms of forest lines .",
    "our results show that about 50% of the he",
    "ii  opacity at @xmath135 is produced by the most tenuous part of the igm with column density @xmath136  .",
    "the detection of he  ii  absorption concludes a long pursuit and opens a new window to the early universe . because @xmath137 and @xmath138 , he  ii  absorption spectra are sensitive to the underdense region where the early seeds of density fluctuations develop . with future far - uv spectroscopy at higher resolution and sensitivity , we will be able to resolve individual structures along the full paths to the early universe , measure the ionization state , the density , and distribution of baryonic matter in intergalactic space .",
