    "scheduling has always been an indispensable part of resource allocation in wireless networks . the seminal work of tassiulas _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , and later @xcite , @xcite considered the case where both channel states and queue lengths are fully available to the scheduler .",
    "it was shown that the maxweight algorithm , which serves the longest connected queue , is throughput - optimal .",
    "subsequently , the maxweight algorithm was found to be throughput - optimal in many other settings as well ( @xcite-@xcite and the references therein ) using tools from lyapunov optimization . some other works ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) also approach the scheduling problem using convex optimization and dual decomposition techniques . @xcite",
    "even considers the role of imperfect queue length information on network throughput , showing that the stability region does not reduce .",
    "but , in all these cases , accurate information about channel - state is assumed as a modeling simplification .    in a real - life network , _",
    "e.g. _ , long term evolution ( lte ) @xcite or ieee 802.16e wimax , the channel - state information fed back to the transmitter can have uncertainty . the primary reason being that although resource - allocation is done at the _ finer granularity _ of a physical resource block ( prb ) , channel - state information is still fed back at the _ coarser granularity _ of a subband , which is a group of prbs .",
    "this is done to reduce the feedback traffic from the users to the base station ( bs ) .",
    "however , this _ averaging _ causes information loss and hence , the resulting uncertainty at the scheduler . moreover , uncertainty might be present in the channel - estimates because of the very process of estimation",
    "some recent works have , hence , tried to model this uncertainty in the channel - estimate .",
    "in @xcite , the authors show that infrequent channel - state measurement , unlike infrequent queue length measurement , reduces the maximum attainable throughput .",
    "@xcite considers the effect of inaccuracy of channel estimation on throughput , but does so assuming a specific probability distribution of the channel - state and does not study the stability of the data queues either .",
    "@xcite attempts at modeling channel- and queue - state uncertainty by considering the case where only heterogeneously delayed information is available at the scheduler .",
    "they however assume knowledge of the channel - state transition probabilities . in @xcite , the authors study scheduling with rate adaptation in a single - hop network with a single channel under channel uncertainty .",
    "they consider cases when the channel estimates are inaccurate but complete or incomplete knowledge of the channel - estimator joint statistics is available at the scheduler .",
    "the authors , however , assume that the channel - estimates are independent across the channels for each user .",
    "delay performance of various wireless systems has also been investigated by many researchers recently . among previous work in the area ,",
    "the authors in @xcite study the problem of opportunistic scheduling of a wireless channel while also trying to minimize the mean delay .",
    "neely @xcite has given a @xmath0 delay bound in the case of on / off channels and a @xmath1 bound for multi - rate channels for the classical maxweight algorithm for a network of size @xmath2 and any traffic input - rate vector within a @xmath3-scaled version of the stability region ( where @xmath4 ) .",
    "subsequent work in @xcite established @xmath0 and @xmath1 delay bounds for the case of single - hop and multi - hop networks , respectively , for on / off channels and under both _",
    "i.i.d . _ and markov modulated arrival traffic scenarios .",
    "@xcite derives lower and upper bounds on the delay in a wireless system with single - hop traffic and general interference constraints .",
    "our contributions of this paper are as follows :    * firstly , we model the channel - estimate inaccuracy and characterize the network stability region . compared to @xcite , we allow the channel estimates to have dependence among themselves , which is a more realistic situation in a modern lte or wimax network . besides , we study a multi - channel setup whereas they consider a single channel . *",
    "secondly , we propose two simple maxweight based scheduling schemes that achieve any rate in the interior of the stability region . * thirdly , we derive an @xmath1 delay bound for our system under one of the throughput - optimal policies we propose . *",
    "lastly , we propose a throughput - optimal policy for the network under traffic with heterogeneous quality of service ( qos ) constraints and present some numerical results studying its performance .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we describe the system model and the assumptions made on the arrival and channel processes .",
    "section iii provides the network stability region .",
    "we also discuss an example that illustrates that partial channel information may lead to a loss of throughput . in section iv , we propose two throughput - optimal policies for the network and prove their optimality .",
    "we also present some simulation results in this section studying their performance .",
    "section v provides a bound on the mean packet delay in the network .",
    "section vi gives a throughput - optimal policy for the network under qos constraints and studies its performance .",
    "we conclude with section vii .",
    "consider a multi - user cellular downlink system with @xmath2 users and @xmath5 _ orthogonal _ channels .",
    "the system operates with fixed - size data packets and in synchronized time slots denoted by @xmath6 .",
    "it may , for example , be a cellular downlink orthogonal frequency - division multiple access ( ofdma ) system .",
    "each user has a separate queue for its data and @xmath7 denotes the queue - length ( in terms of packets ) for user @xmath8 in slot @xmath9 where @xmath10 .",
    "we assume an infinite buffer at each queue . @xmath11 denotes the number of exogenous packet arrivals for user @xmath8 in slot @xmath9 .",
    "it is assumed that @xmath12 is _ i.i.d . _ from slot to slot with @xmath13 and with @xmath14 for all @xmath8 .",
    "however , in a particular slot @xmath9 , @xmath11 may be dependent among themselves .",
    "the channel - state for user @xmath8 and channel @xmath15 in slot @xmath9 is denoted by @xmath16 .",
    "we assume that @xmath16 is _ i.i.d . _ from slot to slot and independent across users .",
    "such an assumption holds , for example , in a wireless system like lte where our _ channel _ corresponds to a prb in the lte system .",
    "a prb has 180 khz bandwidth which is close to the coherence bandwidth of the channel for a typical delay spread of 4 - 5 @xmath17s ( sec .",
    "5.3.2 in @xcite ) .",
    "we define channel - state as the maximum number of packets that can be sent over the channel successfully without suffering an outage .",
    "we assume that @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a discrete state - space and @xmath20 .",
    "the scheduler has access to only estimates @xmath21 of the channel - state in slot @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath22 .",
    "these estimates are used by the scheduler to schedule different channels to the users in slot @xmath9 .",
    "the estimates for a particular user may be dependent on each other . this can be used to model the effect of _ averaging _ ( or even calculating any deterministic function , for that matter ) of the channel - gains as done in lte systems which are sent by the users to the bs to reduce the feedback traffic .",
    "the only constraint we impose on @xmath21 is that @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is a discrete set , and that it is _ i.i.d . _ from slot to slot . as a shorthand ,",
    "we shall use @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 to denote the queue - length vector , arrival vector and channel - estimate matrix , respectively , at slot @xmath9 .",
    "we use @xmath28 to denote the probability mass function of the random variable @xmath29 .",
    "we also assume that the channel / estimator statistics given by the set of probabilities @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 is available at the scheduler .",
    "this can be achieved , possibly , using a mechanism that learns the statistics _ on - the - fly_. we assume that a channel can be allocated to at most one user in a particular slot .",
    "we use the notation @xmath33 and @xmath34 , @xmath22 to denote the user scheduled on channel @xmath15 and the corresponding rate allocated to it , respectively , in the slot @xmath9 .",
    "we can then write the queue evolution equation as : @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 in this equation , we have assumed that the packets sent on channel @xmath15 are received successfully if and only if @xmath38 , _",
    "i.e. _ , probability of error is _ _ negligible _ _ with any arbitrarily small probability of error ( provided @xmath16 is less than the shannon capacity ) assuming the physical - layer coding scheme supports it .",
    "for example , we can use an appropriate turbo code or ldpc code for our purpose . ] if @xmath8 transmits at a rate less than or equal to @xmath16 on channel @xmath15 . under these conditions",
    ", @xmath39 is a countable state markov chain . for simplicity",
    ", we will assume it to be irreducible .",
    "but the general case can be easily handled .",
    "we will use the following notation : @xmath40 $ ] is the convex hull and @xmath41 $ ] is the interior of set @xmath42 , @xmath43 is the @xmath44 coordinate vector and @xmath45 and @xmath46 denote @xmath2-dimensional vectors of zeroes and ones , respectively .",
    "let @xmath47 be a lyapunov function .",
    "we define one - slot conditional lyapunov drift as @xmath48 in the following , we provide an upper bound on @xmath49 which will be used later on .    for the quadratic lyapunov function @xmath50 , @xmath51 where @xmath52 further ,",
    "if @xmath53 and @xmath20 for each @xmath8 and @xmath15 , there exists @xmath54 such that @xmath55",
    "we first define the notion of stability we use in the paper .    a queue @xmath7 is _ strongly stable _ if @xmath56 the network of queues is _ strongly stable _ if each individual queue is strongly stable .",

    "_ implies positive recurrence of the markov chain @xmath39 . in general , it is a stronger notion than positive recurrence . throughout the paper",

    "strong stability_. we characterize the network stability region of the system now .",
    "consider the set of stationary policies g that base their scheduling decisions at time @xmath9 only on @xmath57 , @xmath58 and the channel - estimator statistics .",

    "proof * the proof goes along the lines of the proof of proposition 1 in @xcite .",
    "we have included it in appendix a for the sake of completeness .",
    "we illustrate the loss in throughput caused by partial channel information using a simple example .",
    "we show that scheduling schemes that naively trust the channel - estimate fed back as the _ true _ channel - state may perform much worse than the policies that do nt .",
    "consider a system with @xmath62 user and @xmath63 channels .",
    "the @xmath63 channel are assumed independent .",
    "also , @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "suppose we can only observe the arithmetic average of the two channel states and not the individual states .",
    "so , @xmath66 , for @xmath67 .",
    "now , if we take the @xmath29 value to be the true channel - state , it can be easily shown that the mean service provided will be @xmath68 packets per slot . however , due to the special choice of the support set , the @xmath29 values give us complete information about the channel - state of both the channels .",
    "then , it is easy to see that we can provide mean service of @xmath69 packets per slot .",
    "we note that a careful scheduling decision can even double the mean service rate as shown in the example . though the example may appear a bit contrived , numerical studies in the next",
    "section show that performance gains due to _ clever _ scheduling may indeed be substantial in many realistic situations .",
    "in this section , we describe two throughput - optimal policies and also prove their optimality .",
    "even though the _ stat _ policy described in the proof of theorem 1 is throughput - optimal , we require knowledge of the arrival rates @xmath70 for _ stat _ to be able to perform the channel - allocation .",
    "the throughput - optimal policies described here , in contrast , just require the arrival rate vector to _ lie within _ the stability region ( without knowing @xmath70 ) and need only knowledge of the current queue - lengths .",
    "this will be available to a downlink scheduler used at a bs .",
    "both , of course , require knowledge of the channel - estimator statistics .",
    "moreover , as will be seen later in the section , scheduling schemes that naively trust the channel - estimate fed back perform worse than the policies in this section . for notational simplicity",
    ", we shall drop all the slot indices in this section .",
    "lyapunov drift analysis techniques are used to prove the throughput - optimality of the policies in this section .",
    "we consider the maxweight ( mw ) type policy described below .    at each slot @xmath9 ,",
    "the channel - estimate @xmath71 is observed , and the decisions @xmath72 and @xmath73 are computed separately , for each @xmath15 , as follows :    1 .   to each user @xmath8 , assign rate @xmath74 such that , @xmath75 2 .",
    "schedule the user @xmath72 that maximizes the _ rate - backlog - success - probability product _ : @xmath76    for the sake of completeness , we assume that all ties here are broken lexicographically .",
    "the maxweight policy is throughput - optimal .",
    "* proof * see appendix b.      we now analyses an iterative version of the above maxweight policy .",

    "@xmath78 is defined to be @xmath79 .",

    "we also simulated asymmetric systems and a similar behavior of the corresponding stability regions was observed .",

    "we only had to ensure that all the queues were stable . in this section ,",
