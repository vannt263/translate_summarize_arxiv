    "molecular beam epitaxy ( mbe ) has become an important tool to prepare ultrathin films and nanostructures in nonequilibrium , frozen - in states that show novel properties distinctly different from the equilibrium bulk phases .",
    "theoretically , an important question is how to relate the structural characteristics of the growing material to the incoming flux , substrate temperature , adatom diffusion coefficients and adatom interactions .",
    "successive stages of growth , nucleation and island formation in the submonolayer regime,@xcite second layer nucleation,@xcite growth of three - dimensional clusters and emerging film morphologies , are fairly well understood for the one - component case , i.e.  for deposition of only one species of atoms.@xcite by contrast , nonequilibrium alloy nanostructures produced by codeposition of two or more atomic species can display a variety of additional new phenomena that are only partly understood up to now . from the viewpoint of theoretical modelling ,",
    "this is true in particular for metallic nanoalloys , which recently became of great interest from the experimental and technological viewpoint.@xcite    in many mbe experiments the substrate temperature is chosen sufficiently low so that atomic configurations in the interior of a growing cluster or film can be considered as frozen .",
    "structural relaxation then takes place only among lower - coordinated atoms within the growth zone .",
    "specific to binary systems are the following questions :    * suppose that one atomic species tends to segregate at the surface .",
    "what is the emerging bulk structure upon further deposition burying a segregated surface layer ? * how large is a possible anisotropy in the frozen short - range order , i.e.  a difference in the alloy structure between the lateral and the perpendicular ( growth ) direction ?",
    "* to what extent can diffusion processes limited to the near - surface region give rise to long - range order in the bulk of an ordering alloy at temperatures below the equilibrium order - disorder transition point ? * in the case of magnetic alloys , what are the magnetic properties associated with the non - equilibrium short or long - range order ?",
    "this question is central in the ongoing search for materials that display a stable perpendicular magnetic anisotropy ( pma ) , which is useful for the development of high - density magnetic storage media . under this viewpoint fcc - alloy systems of co - pt,@xcite fe - pt@xcite or fe - co@xcite",
    "draw great attention in current investigations",
    ".    here we report on answers related to these problems , based on kinetic monte carlo ( kmc ) simulations of a statistical model for binary fcc alloys of composition ab@xmath0 , with emphasis on copt@xmath0 alloys .",
    "mbe - grown nanoclusters of copt@xmath0 on a van der waals wse@xmath1 substrate were found recently to exhibit pma at room temperature and below the onset of l1@xmath1-ordering.@xcite the origin of pma is thought to lie in a structural anisotropy induced by the growth process , strong enough to overcome the dipolar form anisotropy favoring in - plane magnetization .",
    "the model we use is based on effective chemical interaction and kinetic parameters extracted , respectively , from known equilibrium properties of copt@xmath0@xcite and from separate diffusion measurements.@xcite the dependence of the magnetic anisotropy on the local structure is represented by a sum over bond contributions , with nearest neighbor co - pt bonds as the dominant part .",
    "the associated bond anisotropy parameter is deduced from magnetic measurements on co - pt multilayer systems.@xcite within this model it was shown that pt surface segregation and cluster shape effects can explain the occurence of pma in some temperature window , followed by the evolution of l1@xmath1-order at higher temperatures.@xcite in this paper we present further details on cluster structures and extend our previous investigations to homogeneous films .    in section  [ sec : model ] we introduce our kinetic model , based on random deposition and subsequent hopping moves of a and b atoms to neighboring sites of an fcc lattice .",
    "hopping rates are derived from the energetics in the specific environment of each atom . to our knowledge ,",
    "most prior kmc simulations of three - dimensional growth of binary systems were in the framework of solid on solid ( sos ) models,@xcite which are not well suitable to describe cluster shapes and facetting in a realistic way .",
    "in very recent work the growth of copt@xmath0 films was simulated , using a more realistic tight binding , second moment approximation to the interatomic interaction potential.@xcite segregation of co - atoms to step edges on the growing surface was predicted , which leads to in - plane co - clustering.@xcite by this the authors were able to explain pma in disordered films , known from previous measurements@xcite to occur at elevated temperatures ( @xmath2k ) .",
    "our model , based on effective nearest neighbor couplings , allows for fully three - dimensional kinetics , a feature which is important in simulations of cluster growth and l1@xmath1 ordering .",
    "it yields cluster facets in agreement with those observed in experiments and consistently accounts for mass transport along the cluster side and top facets .",
    "both height and lateral growth largely relies on interlayer diffusion that starts from adatoms on the substrate , reaching higher layers along side facets .",
    "the present model automatically entails step edge barriers , dissociation from the surface and the possibility of vacancy diffusion in the bulk .",
    "it is less comprehensive than recent simulations of island formation in compound semiconductors , which are based on extensive electronic density functional calculations for energy barriers of the processes involved .",
    "these calculations , however , were so far limited to the submonolayer regime.@xcite section  [ sec : magnetic ] also describes a phenomenological relationship between the local contributions to the magnetic anisotropy and atomic short range order within a bond picture .    the anisotropic short range order and associated magnetic properties of clusters up to 4000 atoms are presented in section  [ sec : clusters ] , and are discussed in detail in terms of surface segregation and cluster shape .",
    "the same algorithm is applied in section  [ sec : films ] to thin films .",
    "in addition to surface -induced pma a bulk contribution is identified which , however , is too small to account for the measured pma in thick films .",
    "further conclusions are drawn in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "our model starts from a reference fcc lattice with nearest neighbor distance @xmath3 in a cubic simulation box @xmath4 where sites can be occupied by an atom of type a ( co ) , b ( pt ) , or by a vacancy v. in contrast to models with a small concentration of vacancies and fixed shape of the sample , most of the simulation box considered here consists of vacancies representing the free space in the vicinity of the cluster .",
    "this allows for an unconstrained evolution of the cluster morphology .",
    "effective interactions between a and b atoms are restricted to nearest neighbor pairs .",
    "this simplified description already captures essential statistical properties of ordering fcc alloys , including the phase diagram which displays l1@xmath1 and l1@xmath5 ordered structures in the vicinity of the ab@xmath0 and ab - composition , respectively.@xcite    bond energies between the different atomic species are denoted by @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the linear combinations @xmath8 , @xmath9 which acts as a surface field , and @xmath10 control the bulk order - disorder transition temperature , the degree of surface segregation of b - atoms , and the average bond energy in the l1@xmath1 ordered state .",
    "parameter values are adjusted to reproduce equilibrium properties of copt@xmath0 : ( i ) the transition from the disordered to the l1@xmath1-structure occurs at @xmath11k,@xcite which is related to @xmath12 by @xmath13.@xcite setting @xmath14 , our energy unit becomes @xmath15mev , corresponding to 523@xmath16k .",
    "( ii ) the observed pt surface segregation of nearly 100%,@xcite caused by the larger size of pt relative to co , is compatible with @xmath17 ; here we choose @xmath18 in most of our calculations .",
    "( iii ) at temperatures of interest , the mobility of atoms is effectively restricted to the film or cluster surface so that their typical coordination is between 3 ( for an adatom on top of a terrace ) and 7 ( for an atom attached to a step edge ) .",
    "parameters for a variety of corresponding processes were calculated for pt within electronic density functional theory ( dft).@xcite different processes were classified according to the number of broken bonds , and the average bond energy yielded @xmath19 , which we use here .",
    "clearly , these bond energies are to be understood as effective energies since real interactions can extend to several neighbors.@xcite    experiments for nanoclusters of copt@xmath0 were performed on a wse@xmath1 ( 0001 ) substrate surface,@xcite which is of the van der waals type .",
    "the interaction with the substrate is modelled by a weak attractive potential , represented by an additional energy @xmath20 for atoms in the first layer . in the cluster simulations we choose @xmath21 .",
    "compared to an fcc pt ( 111 ) surface with three bonds of typical strength @xmath22 , this amounts to about 1/3 of the energy of a single pt - pt bond .",
    "the total flux @xmath23 of incoming atoms is taken as @xmath24 monolayers / s .",
    "additional parameters needed to describe the kinetics of the system are the transition state energy @xmath25 and the attempt frequency @xmath26 for atomic moves .",
    "these values are known from diffusion experiments@xcite of pt on pt ( 111 ) surfaces as @xmath27 s@xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "the resulting diffusion coefficient is @xmath30 for moves without change in energy .    the rate for an elementary hopping process with a final energy @xmath31 and initial energy @xmath32 is chosen to be @xmath33 which fulfills the condition of detailed balance .",
    "as long as the general kinetics are concerned , characterized by the tendency of the system to approach thermal equilibrium , the specific form ( [ eq : hopping_rate ] ) of the hopping rates should not be of crucial importance .    in many cases,@xcite including co deposited on pt(111 ) , adatoms on the top of a terrace or at step edges can exchange positions with an atom underneath in one concerted move . in comparison to single atom moves considered so far ,",
    "a larger binding energy has to be overcome in order to effect such a simultaneous move of two particles .",
    "however , at the same time the transition state energy can be reduced because of the higher coordination in the transition state configuration .",
    "direct exchange processes are found for co deposited on pt(111 ) over a wide temperature range 250520@xmath16k.@xcite they are especially frequent for low - coordinated atoms on top of terraces ( with coordination 3 ) or at step edges ( with coordinations 4 or 5 ) .",
    "we therefore include direct exchange processes between unlike atoms in the simulation .",
    "the corresponding rate involves an exchange barrier @xmath34 that adds to the migration barrier @xmath25 , while initial and final energies are taken into account as before .",
    "these exchange processes , however , are allowed only if one atom has a coordination in the range 3  5 and the other one in the range 8  10 .",
    "let us remark that the activation energy for exchange diffusion of pt on pt ( 100 ) is just 470@xmath16mv,@xcite which is almost the same as the total barrier @xmath35 when @xmath36 , as used in most of our computations described below .",
    "the time evolution in our simulation is determined by a rejectionless continuous time mc - algorithm that generates realizations of the master equation describing the growth kinetics .",
    "each simulation step consists of : ( i ) incrementing the time by an interval @xmath37 drawn from an exponential distribution with mean @xmath38 , ( ii ) executing a process @xmath39 with probability proportional to its rate @xmath40 , ( iii ) updating of rates of processes affected by the moving atom .    , @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "pt atoms are marked in blue and co atoms are marked in different colors depending on the number of nearest neighbor pt atoms : if more ( less ) pt atoms are found out of plane than in plane the atom is marked in green ( yellow ) ; otherwise it is marked in red .",
    "facets with sixfold \\{111 } and fourfold \\{100 } symmetry can be clearly distinguished.,width=275 ]    the simulation box consists of 15 layers with 1440 lattice sites each . to generate an isolated cluster attached to the weakly binding substrate , we start from a seed with 5 atoms on the surface . for the deposition rate @xmath43  ml",
    "/ s used in most simulations and temperatures @xmath44 , the distance between clusters , which would be observed by self - organized nucleation , exceeds the box size .",
    "this could be effectively accounted for by increasing the deposition rate at the boundary of the box to match the extra flux of atoms deposited within the typical capture zone of an island .",
    "however , in order to reduce the number of parameters , we deliberately kept the deposition rate constant for all temperatures .",
    "an example of a typical cluster with @xmath45 atoms obtained in the kmc simulations is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cluster - shape ] .",
    "the top facet has ( 111 ) orientation as expected for the ( 111 ) substrate , and side facets are of ( 111 ) and ( 100 ) type .",
    "the surface shows strong pt segregation .",
    "similar to the experiments,@xcite the aspect ratio of lateral to height dimension of the cluster is about 3:1 . at the temperature @xmath46 , the ratio @xmath47 , and the realization of the growth process implied @xmath48 elementary processes . a simple mc algorithm which generates equivalent dynamics , but",
    "is not rejection free , can be estimated to require about @xmath49 trials for elementary moves , i.e.  about 2000 times more than the algorithm used here .",
    "this ratio increases further at lower temperatures , since bond breaking processes will acquire lower rates and consequently contribute to larger time increments @xmath37 .",
    "subsequent equilibration of the clusters under zero flux during a multiple of the deposition time did not induce significant changes in the cluster configurations and will therefore be ignored in the following .    to generate homogeneous films ( where the width of the interfacial growth zone is much smaller than the average film thickness ) , discussed in section  [ sec : films ] , we choose a stronger surface potential @xmath50 which guarantees complete wetting in the first layer in the temperature range considered .",

    "note that for saturated magnetization a nearest neighbor contribution to the anisotropic part of dipole - dipole interactions has exactly the same form , so that this contribution is included already in the coefficients @xmath64 .",
    "the isotropic part of the exchange interactions only leads to a small renormalization of chemical interactions .",
    "equation  ( [ ha ] ) provides a relationship between a given atomic structure , to be obtained from simulations , and the magnetic anisotropy energy .",
    "magnetic anisotropies for disordered alloys , including co - pt alloys , have been obtained by microscopic calculations based on the kkr - cpa method.@xcite although less accurate in principle , the local expression ( [ ha ] ) here allows us to relate effects in the atomic short range order to the anisotropy energy in a direct way .",
    "note that 2nd order contributions of the anisotropy in the direction cosines as in eq .",
    "( [ ha ] ) do not yield a magneto - crystalline anisotropy in an fcc lattice occupied by a single species .",

    "the anisotropy within the substrate plane turns out to be negligibly small because of the approximate 3-fold symmetry of cluster shapes .",

    "the reason is that the clusters are relatively flat and that surface segregation of pt is weak because of kinetic suppression . as a consequence , in the surface of a cluster there exist more co - pt bonds in - plane than out - of - plane , while atoms in the inner part of the cluster give essentially no contribution to @xmath94 .",
    "the flat cluster shape , on the other hand , would favor pma if strong pt segregation as realized at equilibrium could build up .",
    "indeed , when including exchange processes , pt segregation gets enhanced considerably and @xmath94 can become positive . actually , the cluster displayed in fig .",

    "[ fig : segregation ] , again for a flux @xmath24 ml / s and three values of @xmath34 .",
    "as discussed above , the observed degree of pt surface segregation is generally smaller than in the equilibrium case because of kinetic hindrance : during growth , the time for attaining equilibrium through exchange and diffusion processes is limited due to continuous incorporation of newly deposited atoms .",
    "[ fig : segregation ] reveals that both direct exchange processes and an increasing temperature act towards restoring equilibrium , i.e.  they facilitate pt surface segregation .    clearly , a large @xmath103 in the topmost layer leads to an enrichment of co - atoms in the layer underneath .",
    "therefore , for oblate cluster shapes with more surface area oriented in the [ 111 ] direction than in directions perpendicular to [ 111 ] , a sufficiently strong segregation of pt to the surface will induce a positive sign of @xmath88 .",
    "this favors pma , even for a disordered structure within the cluster interior .",
    "furthermore , the weakly binding van der waals substrate also allows for segregation towards the substrate during growth , effectively doubling the available surface with favorable orientation .",
    "it should be noted that segregation of the majority atoms ( pt ) can be observed even when the parameter @xmath104 controlling segregation is zero .",
    "this can be understood from a mean - field argument that counts bonds in a slab with a free ( 111 ) surface : for a random fcc alloy structure , the exchange of a co - atom at the surface with a pt - atom in the bulk allows the system to lower its energy on average by 3@xmath12 , so that the surface concentration @xmath103 will exceed the stoichiometric concentration , see fig  [ fig : segregation ] .",
    "by contrast , for a fully l1@xmath1 ordered alloy the stoichiometric composition at the surface yields the lowest energy .    in order to give a more quantitative estimate of segregation",
    ", we consider a mean field model that consists of three completely filled ( 111 ) layers of atoms .",

    "the degree of agreement with experiment must be regarded as satisfactory in view of the uncertainties in the analysis of experiments and the simplifying assumptions in our model .",

    "another effect to be mentioned is that larger spin - orbit couplings are known to occur for co - atoms with low coordination on terraces or along steps on pt - surfaces.@xcite such an effect in principle can further enhance pma in nanoclusters because of the flat cluster shape .",

    "the inclusion of exchange processes ( @xmath166 ) diminishes @xmath149 due to reduced ordering through segregation effects .",
    "this can be understood from the large energy a co adatom gains when it is incorporated by an exchange process into deeper layers of the cluster irrespective of its contribution to ordering .    in the presence of exchange processes we notice from the figures that ordering sets in at temperatures near @xmath167 to 1 ( 420  523@xmath16k ) . in experiments ,",

    "[ fig : cluster - layer - growth ] the layer - resolved evolution of one cluster .",
    "one can see pronounced incubation periods , before a nucleation event on top of the last layer takes place .",

    "the slope in the atom numbers of the top layer immediately after nucleation is much higher than one .",
    "this means that most of the atoms incorporated in a new layer during its completion arrive through mass transport along the side facets , leading to a transient lateral shrinkage of all the layers below the growing top layer .",
    "this is seen in the figure by the small dips in all curves occurring simultaneously during the short time intervals when the top layer is filled .",
    "the nucleation events on top can be described by a theory originally devised for second layer nucleation.@xcite this theory describes nucleation in a confined geometry with an influx of particles through deposition and loss of particles over a step edge .",
    "an essential parameter is the schwoebel barrier that atoms have to surmount when crossing the step edge . in our simulations",

    "surface segregation therefore appears to impede the development of long range order .",
    "in order to study growth kinetics of binary alloys we developed a lattice model based on nearest neighbor bonds with bond energies chosen to match equilibrium properties of copt@xmath0 .",

    "this temperature range is bounded towards low temperatures by frozen - in surface kinetics .",
    "the disappearance of pma at higher temperatures is explained by the interplay of pt surface segregation facilitated by direct exchange processes , and a transition from oblate to spherical cluster shapes .",
    "our analysis suggests that the transition is not caused by l1@xmath1 ordering . yet , in our simulations the onset of l1@xmath1 ordering is detected in the same temperature range where pma disappears , in qualitative agreement with the measurements .",
    "it should be noted that up to @xmath185 long range order is induced solely by surface processes , as the bulk kinetics remain still frozen .",
    "the structural anisotropy responsible for the magnetic anisotropy is characterized in our model primarily by a difference in the numbers of co - pt bonds out - of - plane and in - plane . within a bond picture",
    "each co - pt bond provides a local contribution to the magnetic anisotropy , which tends to align the co - moment parallel to the bond .",
    "an associated magnetic bond energy , deduced from experiments on co - pt multilayers , can reasonably reproduce the magnitude of pma measured for nanoclusters in the appropriate temperature range .",
    "pma is predicted to be a surface effect , a feature which could be tested experimentally .",
    "dipolar interactions tend to turn the easy axis of magnetization into the plane .",
    "the two competing effects , bond anisotropy ( surface term ) and dipolar interactions ( volume term ) , lead to an optimum cluster size where the anisotropy energy of a cluster is largest , and a second characteristic size where pma disappears .    the importance of cluster shape effects revealed by our computations is also corroborated by experiment , where a rotation of the easy magnetization axis into the film plane and an associated change in the aspect ratio from oblate to prolate was found in separate measurements on cluster assemblies at higher coverages.@xcite in our simulations , we observed clusters to become more spherical in shape and to develop an excess of in - plane co - pt bonds with increasing temperature .",
    "application of the same methodology to growing continuous films yields a bulk structural anisotropy favoring in - plane magnetization for most of the parameters studied .",
    "however , it can yield a positive bulk contribution to @xmath88 in a certain temperature range provided direct exchange processes are sufficiently fast .",
    "the associated pma , however , is quite small and disappears for @xmath168 . at these higher temperatures",
    "a different mechanism has been proposed recently to describe pma in thick films in terms of in - plane co clustering.@xcite    finally , we like to draw attention to the question of growth of magnetic clusters or films in strong external magnetic fields that saturates the magnetization in the growth direction . the magnetic anisotropy energy should then induce an anisotropy in the probabilities for atomic hopping such that out - of - plane co - pt bonding and pma become favored . in fact , simulation results for growth in a magnetic field suggest that this effect might become detectable in the co - pt system . in particular , for l1@xmath5 ordered alloys estimates based on landau theory suggest that this additional field - induced pma becomes stronger.@xcite                                                                              the value for @xmath69 can be afflicted with uncertainty arising from measurements of films with varying interface quality through different preparation methods . in a previous work@xcite we estimated this parameter based on experiments with values @xmath186 falling in the range@xcite of 0.271.15  mj / m@xmath66 .",
    "the model can also describe the major contribution of the anisotropy resulting from alternating pt and co atomic layers in the ordered l1@xmath5-phase of copt , where the lattice distortion ( tetragonalization ) is only responsible for about 20% of the observed anisotropy.@xcite                an alternative determination of @xmath176 where the outermost two layers at the top and bottom are excluded yields comparable results .",
