    "the decays of @xmath3 are dominated by strong and electromagnetic interactions via @xmath7 annihilating into intermediate gluons and photon at s - channel . by contrast , the weak decays , due to smallness of the strength of weak interaction , are rare processes . under the spectator approximation ,",
    "one of the charm quark or anti - charm quark in @xmath3 decays into light quarks , and the decay rate of a charm quark ( anti - quark ) is proportional to @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the fermi coupling constant .",
    "numerically the total branching ratio of weak decays was estimated to at the order of @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "recently , due to remarkable improvements of experimental instruments and techniques people turn their interests onto these rare processes from both experiment @xcite and theory @xcite sides .",
    "the forthcoming upgraded besiii will be able to accumulate more than @xmath11 @xmath3 per year @xcite , which makes it possible to marginally measure such weak decays in near future .",
    "more important , such rare processes are also particularly interesting from the viewpoint of theory . on the one hand , it may provide further accurate examination of the mechanism which is responsible for the hadronic transition and fully governed by non - perturbative qcd effects .",
    "one can also expect that such decays may offer a unique opportunity to probe new physics beyond the standard model @xcite , including the minimal supersymmetric standard model , the extra dimension model , the two - higgs doublet , topcolor - assisted technicolor model etc , in the weak decay of vector mesons .",
    "the reason is that in such rare decays , weak coupling is rather weak and new physics may have a chance to show up .    in a previous study",
    ", we presented a detailed analysis of the semi - leptonic decays of @xmath3 @xcite , where the branching ratios for such channels were estimated to be at order of @xmath12 and hence is almost impossible to be observed at besiii .",
    "the fundamental ingredients involved in the semi - leptonic processes are the transition form factors of @xmath0 , which are evaluated in terms of the three - point qcd sum rules ( qcdsr ) @xcite in that work .",
    "obviously , even though while deriving the form factors our goal was to estimate the branching ratios of semi - leptonic decays , under the factorization approximation , they can be applied to study the non - leptonic decays .",
    "thus , we will take a step forward to investigate the exclusive non - leptonic decays with focusing on two - body processes .    in this study",
    ", we will explore the non - leptonic decays @xmath1 , where the final states contain a single charmed meson and a light meson @xmath2 , such as @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 etc .. these weak decays are realized via the spectator mechanism that one of the charm quark ( anti - charm quark ) acts as a spectator . in the standard model , at the quark level",
    ", the feynman diagrams for charm quark decay are depicted in fig .",
    "the anti - charm quark decay can be obtained analogously by exchanging @xmath17 . the effective theory for hadronic weak decays",
    "have been well formulated @xcite .",
    "the most difficult work is to calculate the hadronic matrix elements which are governed by the non - perturbative qcd dynamics .",
    "the non - relativistic qcd can simplify the picture by phenomenologically handling some non - perturbative qcd effects and has been widely applied to study some decay modes where heavy quarkonium are involved .",
    "however , it does not help much for the heavy - light mesons where relativistic effects may be significant .",
    "the first order approximation for the derivation is the factorization hypothesis , where the hadronic matrix element is factorized into a product of two matrix elements of single currents @xcite . in this scheme",
    ", one element can be written in terms of the decay constant of the concerned meson while the other is expressed by a few form factors according to the lorentz structure of the current and meson ( a pseudoscalar or vector , for example ) .",
    "the non - factorizable effects are incorporated into the effective coefficients which are usually assumed to be universal and determined by experiment ( only in some cases , they are pertubartively calculable . in reality , these coefficients depend on the concrete processes and differ case by case , but the variation may be not very drastic . ) . for the weak decays of heavy mesons",
    ", such factorization approach is verified to work very well for the color - allowed sub - processes .",
    "it is reasonable to believe that this conjecture would be valid for @xmath3 , at least for the processes where the color - allowed sub - processes dominate .",
    "thus , the study on two - body non - leptonic decays offer an ideal ground to testify the factorization hypothesis in the heavy quarkonium system and this test may be more appealing than in decays of @xmath18 because @xmath3 contains two heavy constituents .",
    "moreover , they are of great importance to discriminate various theoretical tools for the evaluations of transition form factors .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii , the factorization approach for the non - leptonic decays is introduced and the formulations are given . in section iii , after displaying the inputs involved in this work explicitly , the numbers of branching fractions for various @xmath19 modes are presented and comparisons of our numerical results with that estimated in other theoretical models are also investigated at length in this section .",
    "the final section is devoted to the discussions and conclusions .",
    "it is noted that since most of the form factors applied in this work were obtained in our previous work , we generally refer the readers to it for some details of the derivation and how to achieve the numerical values .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     furthermore , we group the decay rates for dominant channels of @xmath20 in table   [ t3 ] , from which we can observe that @xmath21 is as large as @xmath22 and stands as the most promising mode to be measured at besiii .",
    "such finding presents a striking contrast to the argument given by the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite where the authors claimed that a specific non - leptonic decay channel like @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) is hardly to be detected owing to the tiny branching factions for these processes .",
    "in addition , it is also helpful to define the following two ratios @xmath25 which characterize the relative size of branching fractions to distinguish the final states with vector and pseudoscalar ones respectively in the non - leptonic two - body weak decays of @xmath3 .",
    "the numbers of @xmath26 and @xmath27 are evaluated as @xmath28 and @xmath29 in the qcd sum rules , while they are determined as @xmath30 and @xmath31 respectively with the isgw model in the framework of heavy quark spin symmetry @xcite .",
    "such discrepancies can be attributed to the different values of form factors employed in the numerical calculations .",
    "moreover , we also mention that @xmath32 should be equal to @xmath33 in the heavy quark limit .",
    "however , this ratio is estimated as @xmath34 in the qcd sum rules owing to a serious suppression factor from the phase space for the decay of @xmath35 for the limited charm quark mass .    combining the table  [ t1 ] , [ t2 ] and [ t3 ] , we find that the branching ratio for inclusive weak decay of @xmath3 can be as large as @xmath4 , which is also in remarkable agreement with the naive estimation @xmath36",
    "since @xmath3 mainly decays via strong and electromagnetic interactions , its weak decays usually take small fractions which can not be measured by available experimental apparatus . on other aspect ,",
    "however , because @xmath3 contains two heavy constituents , its weak decay may possess a unique character .",
    "indeed weak decays of @xmath3 may offer an ideal platform to examine the mechanism which governs the hadronization process , without possible contamination from the light spectator as well as one may determine its fundamental parameters such as the ckm matrix which can be a complementary test to the values obtained in @xmath37 decays .",
    "it is lucky for high energy physicists that a tremendous database on @xmath3 will be available in the forthcoming besiii and the measurements on the weak decays of @xmath3 may become possible .    as is well known , the essential challenge in the theoretical calculations on the rates of weak decays of @xmath3 is to disentangle the underlying weak - interaction transitions from the notorious effects owing to strong interactions reasonably @xcite . in our previous paper @xcite ,",
    "the transition form factors in the semi - leptonic weak decays of @xmath3 have been investigated to the leading order of @xmath38 based on qcd sum rules , where the non - perturbative qcd dynamics is characterized by a few universal parameters .",
    "the branching ratios for dominant exclusive processes are evaluated and their order of magnitude is typically at @xmath12 .",
    "obviously based on the factorization assumption , the form factors obtained for the semi - leptonic decays can be applied to study the non - leptonic decays .",
    "this paper can be viewed as a continuation of our earlier work @xcite .",
    "we present a comprehensive study of non - leptonic decays of @xmath39 based on the factorization assumption and apply the transition form factors calculated in the qcd sum rules .",
    "it is observed that the sum of the branching fractions for the dominant non - leptonic decays of @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 as well as their charge conjugate channels can reach as large as @xmath44 , a special decay mode @xmath45 can even arrive at @xmath46 , which is hopefully to be marginally detected in the @xmath47 colliders in view of the large database of the besiii .",
    "our results are in agreement with the finding in ref.@xcite that @xmath3 decays to vector charmed meson @xmath48 more favorably than to the pseudoscalar one , however , the ratios of these two channels calculated in this work is twice or three times larger than that given by ref.@xcite , where heavy quark spin symmetry and the non - recoil approximation were adopted and the isgw model was employed to compute the single form factor @xmath49 .    as there is a light to see a possibility of measuring weak decays of @xmath3 which have obvious advantages for getting insight to the physics picture",
    ", we strongly urge our experimental colleagues to search for vector charmed mesons productions in @xmath3 decays at besiii @xcite .",
    "moreover , from the theoretical side , it should be emphasized that coulomb - type corrections for the heavy quarkonium system @xcite are not included in the computations of form factors in the qcd sum rues , which could induce additional uncertainties to the evaluation of the branching fractions for non - leptonic two body decays of @xmath3 .",
    "however , one can still trust the order of magnitude gained in this work , since while calculating the form factors which need to deal with the three - point correlations , most uncertainties originating from coulomb - like corrections are canceled by that in the two - point correlations for evaluating the decay constant of @xmath3 .",
    "apart from weak decays of @xmath3 presented in this paper , weak decays of @xmath50 are suggested to be explored seriously in a complementary fashion from both the theoretical and experimental point of view .",
