    "amazingly enough , however , these merger rates are fundamentally flawed . as we show below",
    ", the extended - press - schechter ( eps ) formulae for merger rates are mathematically self - inconsistent , providing _ two _ different results for the same merger rate .",
    "the two different merger rates are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : psprob ] .",
    "they are equal for equal - mass mergers but increasingly discrepant for larger mass ratios",
    ". this ambiguity will be particularly important for , e.g. , understanding galactic substructure and for smbh - merger rates .",
    "even the smaller numerical inconsistency for mergers of nearly equal mass may be exponentially enhanced during repeated application of the formula while constructing merger trees to high redshift . moreover ,",
    "the ambiguity calls into question the entire formalism , even when the two possibilities seem to give similar answers quantitatively .    in this paper",
    ", we discuss the mathematical requirements of a self - consistent theory of halo mergers .",
    "as recognised already @xcite , the merger process is described by the smoluchowski coagulation equation .",
    "this equation simply says that the rate at which the abundance of halos of a given mass changes is determined by the difference between the rate for creation of such halos by mergers of lower - mass halos and the rate for destruction of such halos by mergers with other halos .",
    "the correct expression for the merger rate must be one that yields the correct rate of evolution of the halo abundance when inserted into the coagulation equation the problem is thus to find a merger rate , or `` kernel , '' that is consistent with the evolution of the halo abundance , either the press - schechter abundance or one of its more recent n - body  inspired variants @xcite .",
    "the apparent simplicity of the mathematical problem , which appears in equation ( [ eq : smoluchowski ] ) below , is in fact quite deceptive .",
    "the smoluchowski coagulation equation is in fact an infinite set of coupled nonlinear differential equations .",
    "the equation appears in a variety of areas of science  e.g .",
    ", aerosol physics , phase separation in liquid mixtures , polymerization , star - formation theory @xcite , planetesimals @xcite , chemical engineering , biology , and population genetics ",
    "so there is a vast but untidy literature on the subject ( although see for an illuminating review ) .",
    "it has been studied a little by pure and applied mathematicians @xcite .",
    "still , solutions to the coagulation equation are poorly understood .",
    "furthermore , there is virtually no literature on the problem we face : i.e. , how to find a merger kernel that , when inserted into the coagulation equation , yields the desired halo mass distribution and its evolution as a solution .    in this paper , we present a numerical technique to find a merger kernel that yields the correct evolution of a specified halo mass distribution .",
    "we demonstrate this technique by applying it to press - schechter distributions for power - law power spectra .",
    "we regret that at this point we still do not have results that can be applied to astrophysical merger rates ( e.g. those valid for cdm power spectra ) , although our techniques can easily be extended to more realistic cases .",
    "moreover , although we have indeed found merger rates that are mathematically consistent with the desired halo distributions , our inversion of the smoluchowski equation is not necessarily unique .",
    "as we discuss below , there may be other merger kernels that also yield the same halo mass distribution .",
    "more work must be done to determine how to insure that the numerical inversion yields the merger kernel that in fact describes the process of mergers from gravitational clustering of mass with an initial gaussian distribution .",
    "nevertheless , the work presented here may be a first step in this direction .",

    "the problem with this merger rate is immediately apparent .",

    "this can be seen clearly in fig .",
    "[ fig : psprob ] where we plot the merger kernels @xmath28 and @xmath33 for a specific case .",

    "for example , the merger rate for a mass ratio of @xmath35 is uncertain by a factor of @xmath36 .",
    "this could significantly affect the predicted number of dwarf galaxies expected to be found within clusters .",
    "it is very problematic for predictions of black - hole mergers detectable with lisa , as many of the detectable signals may arise from mergers of very unequal masses for which the numerical ambiguity is particularly pronounced .",
    "furthermore , even for mergers of nearly equal masses , where the two predictions agree more closely , repeated application of the merger - rate formula ( as occurs in the construction of merger trees ) will lead to a growing divergence between the two predictions .",
    "the extended - press - schechter merger rate is in fact only a symmetric function of its arguments in two special cases .",
    "the first , trivial , case is when @xmath37 .",
    "the second is for the case of a distribution of primordial densities described by a white - noise power spectrum , @xmath38 with @xmath39 . in this case",
    "the merger kernel reduces to @xmath40    our aim is to find kernels @xmath28 which ( a ) are symmetric in their arguments and ( b ) yield the correct evolution of the halo distribution @xmath41 when inserted into the coagulation equation .",
    "the kernel should also ( c ) satisfy the known statistics of dark - matter  halo merger rates .",
    "below , we will illustrate a numerical algorithm that can accomplish conditions ( a ) and ( b ) ; we discuss the third condition later .",
    "during the process of hierarchical clustering , halos of mass @xmath5 will be created via mergers of pairs of halos of masses @xmath42 and @xmath43 , and they will be destroyed via mergers with halos of any other mass , @xmath42 . the rate at which the abundance of halos of mass @xmath5 changes is therefore @xmath44 where the dot denotes a derivative with respect to time , the first term on the right - hand side describes halo formation , and the second describes halo destruction .",
    "note that we have suppressed the explicit dependence of @xmath45 on time and the possible dependence of @xmath28 on time in equation  ( [ eq : smoluchowski ] ) .",
    "this equation is known as the smoluchowski coagulation equation @xcite .",
    "it appears in a variety of areas in science in which coagulation processes occur .",
    "one astrophysical example is the theory of planetesimal growth , in which small objects merge to form larger objects . in almost all prior applications ,",
    "the merger kernel @xmath46 is specified by ( micro)physical processes ( note that it has units of cross section times velocity ) and the equations are then integrated forward from some initial mass distribution @xmath47 to determine the mass distribution at some later time .    in our case ,",
    "however , we know the `` answer , '' the mass distribution @xmath48 ( either a press - schechter distribution , an improved version such as the sheth - tormen distribution , or some other similar distribution determined from simulations ) . we need to find the merger kernel @xmath28 that yields the desired evolution of this mass distribution when inserted into the smoluchowski equation .",
    "this , as far as we know , is an unsolved mathematical problem . in principle",
    ", some variant of the derivation used by that imposes the symmetry constraint @xmath49 might be used to determine this merger kernel .",
    "it is in fact easy to impose the symmetry constraint with some _ ansatz _ , such as an arithmetic or geometric mean of the two lacey  cole results .",
    "however , the merger kernel must also be consistent , within the dictates of the coagulation equation , with the evolution of the press - schechter halo distribution , and we have not yet been able to satisfy this constraint with any analytic approach .    in the absence of an analytic solution ,",
    "we attempt to find a numerical solution to the problem : i.e. , can we numerically find a merger kernel @xmath28 that when inserted into the coagulation equation yields the evolution of the ps distribution ?",
    "the answer , as we discuss below , is yes . to illustrate the technique ,",
    "we restrict our attention to the press - schechter mass distribution because of the simplicity of the analytic expressions .",
    "moreover , we restrict our attention to power - law power spectra , @xmath38 , again for simplicity .",
    "this has the additional advantage that for the case @xmath39 we have an analytic solution to the smoluchowski equation .",
    "however , our technique can be applied equally well to more accurate distributions such as the sheth - tormen distribution and to other power spectra .",
    "the press - schechter rate of change of halo abundance is found by differentiating equation  ( [ eqn : psabundance ] ) and is given by @xmath50 { \\dot{\\delta}_{\\rm       c}\\over \\delta_{\\rm c } } \\left[{\\delta_{\\rm c}^2 \\over       \\sigma_1 ^ 2}-1\\right].\\ ] ] shifting to a time variable @xmath51 and dimensionless mass variable @xmath52 [ where @xmath53 is the characteristic nonlinear mass scale defined through the relation @xmath54 this becomes @xmath55 \\left[{\\delta_{\\rm c}^2 \\over \\sigma_1 ^ 2}-1\\right].\\ ] ] where @xmath56 . for power - law power spectra , @xmath57",

    "clearly the solution must be proportional to @xmath63 .",
    "we therefore choose a system of units such that @xmath64 to simplify the calculation .",
    "this choice of units removes the explicit time dependence from our merger rate , allowing us to find a function @xmath65 valid at all times .",
    "the time dependence of the merger rate is absorbed into a time - dependent system of units instead .    before discussing our numerical algorithm , we first point out that , for the mass functions we are considering , there are divergences in the creation and destruction terms in the coagulation equation that cancel . as @xmath66 , the mass function @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is between 2 and 1 for @xmath69 . thus ,",
    "if @xmath65 does not vanish as one of the arguments approaches zero ( which is the case for @xmath39 , and as we argue below , should also be the case more generally ) , then there is a non - integrable singularity at the lower and upper limits of the creation term in equation  ( [ eq : rewritten ] ) , and one at the lower limit of the destruction term .",
    "these divergences cancel , however , if we impose an infinitesimal lower mass to the limits of integration .",
    "physically , halos of some given ( scaled ) mass @xmath70 are being created very rapidly by merging of halos of infinitesimally smaller mass with halos of infinitesimal mass , but they are also being destroyed at the same rate by merging with infinitesimal - mass objects .",
    "appendix [ ap : alternate ] derives an alternative expression for the coagulation equation that makes the cancellation explicit .",
    "as we will see below , these divergences complicate the numerical inversion , as the matrix to be inverted will have elements of vastly differing magnitudes .",
    "to numerically invert the coagulation equation , we deal with a discretized version . we divide @xmath70 into @xmath71 intervals of size @xmath72 , running from @xmath6 to @xmath73 , labeled by an index @xmath74 .",
    "thus , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 .",

    "is exactly correct for the @xmath39 case , where @xmath84 is everywhere linear .",

    "unfortunately , it is simple to see that the equation is ill - determined .",
    "we have @xmath71 linear equations , but @xmath91 unknowns to determine ( since @xmath92 is symmetric ) . as such",
    ", there will be an infinite number of possible solutions .",
    "we are looking therefore not just for any solution , but a sensible one .",
    "since the above equation does not uniquely define @xmath81 we have to apply regularization conditions in order to find a physically reasonable @xmath92 .",
    "our goal is to minimize the quantity @xmath93 and instead seek to minimize @xmath94 and @xmath95 simultaneously .",
    "this regularization condition should encapsulate the desired physical properties of the solution sought .",
    "specifically , we will require that the solution be a smooth function of its arguments , which seems reasonable for any physically - plausible solution , and that @xmath96 everywhere , as a negative merger rate has no physical meaning .",
    "our first regularization condition is therefore @xmath97 ^ 2 + [ \\partial^2 q/\\partial z_2 ^ 2]^2 { \\rm d } z_1 { \\rm d } z_2 \\right ] \\right/ \\sigma_{r_1}^2 , \\label{eq : reg}\\ ] ] where @xmath98 is an adjustable parameter .",

    "we choose @xmath102 to give equal fractional weight to each element in the summation .",
    "we find that , once the values of @xmath71 and @xmath90 have been chosen to suit the power spectrum under consideration , the minimization of @xmath103 leads to almost no further improvement in the solution . as such",

    "however , our algorithm was unable to find a consistent and smooth merger kernel with this constraint .",
    "this leads us to believe that the eps merger rate is invalid , even for equal - mass mergers where the two eps results agree .",

    "we found that we were able to implement this algorithm and recover the merger kernel for the @xmath39 power spectrum ( for which the merger kernel is indeed homogeneous ) .",
    "we then speculated that for more general power - law power spectra , the merger kernel would also be homogeneous .",
    "however , we were unable to get the muralidar - ramkrishna algorithm to return smooth kernels for these power spectra",
    ". indeed , our numerically recovered merger kernels are _ not _ homogeneous for these more general power spectra .",
    "below we attempt to answer several questions which frequently arise in connection with this work .    _",
    "what about three - body encounters ? _ the assumption that halos grow through binary mergers , which is implicit in the smoluchowski equation , could be questioned .",
    "since the halo abundance diverges at low masses it is possible that a halo will experience an infinite number of mergers per unit time with halos of vanishingly small mass .",
    "however , as shown in appendix  [ ap : alternate ] , the creation and destruction rates due to these halos cancel exactly .",
    "therefore , we can truncate the halo mass function at some low mass and obtain a good approximation to the true merging history .",
    "put another way , if the mass distribution is described by discrete objects , as in an n - body simulation , rather than a continuum mass distribution , then there are no three - body mergers . in such a simulation , there could easily be three or more halos that merge within a finite time interval .",
    "however , one can always find a sufficiently small time step so that any apparent three - body merger will in fact be a rapid sequence of two - body mergers ( somewhat like the triple - alpha reaction in stellar nucleosynthesis , which is in fact a rapid series of two - body reactions ) .",
    "_ what can we learn from n - body simulations ? _ in principle , the merger kernel can be determined from n - body simulations . in practice , though , this will be challenging .",
    "if we have @xmath71 mass bins , then there will be @xmath91 entries in the merger kernel , and we must have a sufficiently large simulation to provide a statistically significant number of mergers in each of these bins .",
    "such a simulation will also require a very large dynamic range so that a huge number of halos of widely varying masses will be resolved .",
    "however , there may be a simpler avenue .",
    "if we carry out a constrained realization of a single large halo ( see , for example , ) , then the accretion of smaller halos by this single large halo can be used to determine the merger kernel @xmath124 for a single large @xmath20 as a function of @xmath21 for @xmath125 .",
    "such a numerical calculation may be helpful in checking the numerical inversion we have carried out here , and perhaps in shedding light on the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath124 for @xmath126 .",
    "we plan to pursue such n - body calculations in future work ",
    "initial investigations using simulations with cdm power spectra suggest that our numerical results may better match the n - body merger rates than the predictions of extended press - schechter theory .    _ what about fragmentation ? _ in a realistic n - body simulation , some of the mass in halos might be ejected ( e.g. , by an analog of the `` slingshot '' effect ) .",
    "if so , then the coagulation equation should include fragmentation terms .",
    "we believe , however , that the fraction of mass ejected will be small , and that the inexorable trend in hierarchical structure formation is to larger masses ; this is also mathematically realized in the press - schechter and extended press - schechter theories .",
    "we therefore idealize the situation by neglecting any such fragmentation and attempt to find a solution to the pure coagulation problem first .    _ what about `` smooth '' accretion ? _",
    "some authors have noted that merger trees assembled with the extended - press - schechter merger rates do not produce press - schechter distributions , as they should , and have thus attempted to account for this discrepancy by the supposition that halos can gain mass by accreting diffuse matter from the smooth intergalactic medium , as well as by mergers with other halos . in our formalism , what others would call `` smooth accretion '' is described by mergers with very low - mass halos .",
    "in other words , every mass element is contained in a halo of some size ( as in standard press - schechter theory ) , and smooth accretion is taken into account by mergers with halos of extremely low mass .",
    "_ is the numerically determined merger rate unique ? _ given our choice of regularization condition  namely that the function be as smooth as possible and everywhere positive  we do indeed find a unique solution .",
    "however , we could imagine other regularization criteria , perhaps in addition to smoothness and positivity , which would lead to different answers .",
    "not all such criteria may allow a solution to be found .",
    "for example , we find that requiring our recovered merger rate to coincide with the extended press - schechter merger rate for the case of equal mass mergers prevents us from finding a merger rate which accurately solves the smoluchowski equation .",
    "_ can the merger kernel be determined by looking at the properties ( e.g. , size ) of the physical halos ? _ in most applications of the coagulation equation ( e.g. , in planetesimal theory ) , the merger kernel is determined by the physical cross section and relative velocity of the merging objects ; i.e. , by the `` micro''-physics . in our case , however , such a kinetic - theory description will not apply , as the system of halos is `` cold '' and halos are more likely to merge with those that form nearby , rather than a halo drawn at random from the field . in other words ,",
    "the merger history is determined by the clustering properties of the halos ( as encapsulated by the power spectrum ) rather than by any intrinsic property , such as their size .    _",
    "what about other algorithms for generating merger trees ?",
    "_ the fact that the eps binary merger rates , when used to construct merger trees , do not yield press - schechter distributions is well known .",
    "there have been algorithms developed that mitigate the shortcomings of eps by correcting the eps merger rates with , e.g. , three - body mergers or `` smooth '' accretion ( e.g. ) .",
    "there is no unique algorithm for constructing a merger tree ( explore many of the possibilities ) , but some are more successful than others at reproducing the distribution of progenitors of dark - matter halos as predicted by the extended press - schechter theory",
    ". it should be noted , however , that the merger rates used in these merger trees are not necessarily correct , even if the algorithm does ultimately reproduce the correct mass function .",
    "it should be further noted that all of these algorithms rely on the extended press - schechter merger rates for major mergers which , as we have shown , are very likely incorrect . as such , these algorithms",
    "do not address the problem we consider here .",
    "in fact , with our self - consistent merger rates , merger trees can be constructed without resorting to three - body mergers , smooth accretion , or other kluges .",
    "we have described an approach to find physically reasonable estimates of dark - matter - halo merger rates . we describe techniques for finding numerical solutions to the smoluchowski coagulation equation which we use to describe the hierarchical formation of dark - matter halos . while the extended press - schechter theory contains an intrinsic inconsistency in its predictions for halo merger rates ( namely that the merger rate of halos of mass @xmath20 with those of mass @xmath21 is not the same as that of halos of mass @xmath21 with halos of mass @xmath20 ) our approach is guaranteed to always produce self - consistent merger rates .",
    "we have presented symmetric , smooth solutions to the smoluchowski equation for the case of dark - matter  halo growth through gravitational clustering .",
    "these solutions can now be checked against the results of numerical simulations .",
    "the same techniques can also be applied to non - power law power spectra ( although in general the solution will be somewhat more complex as the merger rate may depend explicitly on time for such power spectra and may contain characteristic mass scales ) , and also to halo - abundance evolution rates derived from fitting functions designed to reproduce the halo mass functions found in n - body simulations .",
    "a number of questions still remain before we have reliable astrophysical merger rates .",
    "first and foremost among these is how to insure that the numerically recovered solution is in fact _ the _ solution that correctly describes mergers due to gravitational amplification of an initially gaussian distribution of perturbations .",
    "the fact that our numerical results are highly insensitive to the details of our smoothing constraint leads us to believe that our algorithm is indeed converging to a unique physical result , but we can not demonstrate this rigorously .",
    "perhaps future analytic work inspired by extended - press - schechter  like considerations or n - body simulations may provide insight into constraints , boundary conditions , and/or asymptotic limits that will allow us to confidently zero in on the correct solution . beyond that",
    ", the technique will then need to be applied to obtain a merger kernel for a cdm power spectrum , rather than the scale - invariant power spectra we have considered here . and",
    "finally , the merger kernel will ultimately have to be consistent with a sheth - tormen or jenkins et al .",
    "mass function , or whatever other mass function is determined to be the `` correct '' one . with these self - consistent kernels ,",
    "the well - known problems with eps formation - redshift distributions ( i.e. , that they are not positive definite ) will be corrected , and merger trees will be easily constructed .",
    "we plan to address these issues in future work .",
    "the hierarchical formation of dark - matter halos is a fundamental component of a large fraction of current studies in the fields of cosmology and galaxy formation .",
    "a mathematically self - consistent and quantitatively accurate knowledge of halo merger rates is therefore extremely valuable .",
    "we believe that the techniques developed in this work may provide a first step for developing such knowledge .",
