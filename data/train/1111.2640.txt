    "scarcity of available vacant spectrum is limiting the growth of wireless products and services @xcite .",
    "traditional spectrum licensing policy forbids unlicensed users to transmit in order to avoid unfavorable interference at the cost of spectral utilization efficiency .",
    "this led to the idea of cognitive radio ( cr ) technology , originally introduced by j. mitola @xcite , which holds tremendous promise to dramatically improve the efficiency of spectral utilization .",
    "+ the key idea behind cr is that an unlicensed / secondary user ( su ) is allowed to communicate over a frequency band originally licensed to a primary user ( pu ) , as long as the transmission of su does not generate unfavorable impact on the operation of pu in that band .",
    "effectively , three categories of cr network paradigms have been proposed : interweave , overlay , and underlay @xcite . in the underlay systems ,",
    "also known as spectrum sharing model , which is the focus of this paper , the su can transmit even when the pu is present , but the transmitted power of su should be controlled properly so as to ensure that the resulting interference does not degrade the received signal quality of pu to an undesirable level @xcite by imposing the so called interference temperature @xcite constraints at pu ( average or peak interference power ( aip / pip ) constraint ) and as well as to enhance the performance of su transmitter ( su - tx ) to su receiver ( su - rx ) link .",
    "+ various notions of capacity for wireless channels include ergodic capacity ( for delay - insensitive services ) , delay - limited capacity and outage probability ( for real - time applications ) .",
    "these information theoretic capacity notions constitute important performance measures in analyzing the performance limits of cr systems . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors investigated the ergodic capacity of such a dynamic narrowband spectrum sharing model under either aip or pip constraint at pu receiver ( pu - rx ) in various fading environments .",
    "the authors of @xcite extended the work in @xcite to asymmetric fading environments . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors studied optimum power allocation for three different capacity notions under both aip and pip constraints . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors also considered the transmit power constraint at the su - tx and investigated the optimal power allocation strategies to achieve the ergodic capacity and outage capacity of su under various combinations of secondary transmit ( peak / average ) power constraints and interference ( peak / average ) constraints .",
    "+ achieving the optimal system performance requires the su - tx to acquire full channel state information ( csi ) including the channel information from su - tx to pu - rx and the channel information from su - tx to su - rx .",
    "most of the above results assume perfect knowledge or full csi , which is very difficult to implement in practice , especially the channel information from su - tx to pu - rx without pu s cooperation .",
    "a few recent papers have emerged that address this concern by investigating performance analysis with various forms of partial csi at su - tx , such as noisy csi and quantized csi . with assumption of perfect knowledge of the csi from su - tx to su - rx channel",
    ", @xcite studied the effect of imperfect channel information of the su - tx to pu - rx channel under aip or pip constraint by considering the channel information from su - tx to the pu - rx as a noisy estimate of the true csi and employing the so - called tifr transmission policy .",
    "another recent work @xcite also considered imperfect csi of the su - tx to pu - rx channel in the form of noisy channel estimate ( a range from near - perfect to seriously flawed estimates ) and studied the effect of using a midrise uniformly quantized csi of the su - tx to pu - rx channel , while also assumed the su - tx had full knowledge of the csi from su - tx to su - rx channel .",
    "recently , @xcite has proposed a practical design paradigm for cognitive beamforming based on finite - rate cooperative feedback from the pu - rx to the su - tx and cooperative feedforward from the su - tx to the pu - rx .",
    "a robust cognitive beamforming scheme was also analyzed in @xcite , where full channel information on su - tx to su - rx channel was assumed , and the imperfect channel information on the su - tx to pu - rx channel was modelled using an uncertainty set .",
    "finally , @xcite studied the issue of channel quantization for resource allocation via the framework of utility maximization in ofdma based cr networks , but did not investigate the joint channel partitioning and rate / power codebook design problem .",
    "the absence of a rigorous and systematic design methodology for quantized resource allocation algorithms in the context of cognitive radio networks motivated our earlier work @xcite , where we addressed an su ergodic capacity maximization problem in a wideband spectrum sharing scenario with quantized information about the vector channel space involving the su - tx to su - rx channel and the su - tx to pu - rx channel over all bands , under an average transmit power constraint at the su - tx and an average interference constraint at the pu - rx .",
    "a slightly different approach was taken in @xcite where the su overheard the pu feedback link information and used this to obtain information about whether or not the pu is in outage and how the su - tx should control its power to minimize interference on the pu - rx .",
    "+ in this paper , we address the problem of minimizing the su outage probability under an average transmit power ( atp ) constraint at the su - tx and an average interference power ( aip ) constraint at the pu - rx .",
    "similar to @xcite , we consider an infrastructure - based narrowband spectrum sharing scenario where a su communicates to its base station ( su - bs ) on a narrowband channel shared with a pu communicating to its receiver pu - rx contained within the primary base station ( pu - bs ) .",
    "the key problem is the jointly designing the optimal partition regions of the vector channel space ( consisting of the su - tx to su - rx channel ( denoted by power gain @xmath0 ) and the interfering channel between the su - tx and pu - rx ( denoted by power gain @xmath1 ) ) and the corresponding optimal power codebook , and is solved offline at a central controller called the cr network manager as in @xcite , based on the channel statistics .",
    "the cr network manager is assumed to be able to obtain the full csi information of the vector channel space @xmath2 in real - time from the su - bs and pu - bs , respectively , possibly via wired links ( similar to backhaul links in multicell mimo networks connecting multiple base stations ) .",
    "this real - time channel realization is then assigned to the optimal channel partition and the corresponding partition index is sent to the su - tx ( and to the su - rx for decoding purposes ) via a finite - rate feedback link .",
    "the su - tx then uses the power codebook element associated with this index for data transmission .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that without the presence of the cr network manager , and thus without the ability to jointly quantize the combined channel space , the su capacity performance is significantly degraded if one carries out separate quantization of @xmath0 and @xmath1 . even if such a cr network manager can not be implemented in practical cognitive radio networks due to resource constraints",
    ", the results derived in this paper will serve as a valuable benchmark . under these networking assumptions ,",
    "we prove a stepwise structure of the optimal channel partition regions , which helps us explicitly formulate the outage minimization problem and solve it using the corresponding karush - kuhn - tucker ( kkt ) necessary optimality conditions .",
    "as the number of feedback bits go to infinity , we show that the power level for the last region approaches zero , allowing us to derive a useful low - complexity suboptimal quantized power allocation algorithm called zpiora for high rate quantization .",
    "we also derive some other useful properties related to the channel quantizer structure as the number of feedback bits approaches infinity : ( a ) under an active aip constraint , the length of interval between any two adjacent quantization thresholds on @xmath1 axis is asymptotically the same , and ( b ) while when the aip is inactive , the ratio between any two adjacent quantization thresholds on @xmath0 axis asymptotically becomes identical .",
    "finally , with these properties , we derive explicit expressions for asymptotic ( as the number of feedback bits increase ) behavior of the su outage probability with quantized power allocation for large resolution quantization .",
    "numerical studies illustrate that with only 6 bits of feedback , the designed optimal algorithms provide secondary outage probability very close to that achieved by full csi . with 2 - 4 bits of feedback",
    ", zpiora provides a comparable performance , thus making it an attractive choice for large number of feedback bits case .",
    "numerical studies also show that zpiora performs better than two other suboptimal algorithms constructed using existing approximations in the literature .",
    "finally , it is also shown that the derived asymptotic outage behavior approximates the optimal outage extremely well as the number of feedback bits becomes large .",

    "section [ us2 ] presents the joint design of the optimal channel partition regions and an optimal power codebook algorithm .",
    "a low - complexity suboptimal quantized power allocation strategy is also derived using novel interesting properties of the quantizer structure and optimal quantized power codebooks . in section [ us3 ] , the asymptotic behavior of su outage probability for high resolution quantization is investigated .",

    "under such a network modelling assumption , given b bits of feedback , a power codebook @xmath30@xmath31 of cardinality @xmath32 , is designed offline purely on the basis of the statistics of @xmath1 and @xmath0 information at the cr network manager .",
    "this codebook is also known _ a priori _ by both su - tx and su - rx for decoding purposes .",
    "given a channel realization @xmath33 , the cr network manager employs a deterministic mapping from the current instantaneous @xmath29 information to one of @xmath34 integer indices ( let @xmath35 denote the mapping , which partitions the vector space of @xmath29 into @xmath34 regions @xmath36@xmath37@xmath36@xmath38 , defined as @xmath39 ) , and then sends the corresponding index @xmath40 to the su - tx ( and the su - rx ) via the feedback link .",

    "[ f2 ] illustrates the outage performance of su with optimal qpa strategy versus @xmath19 with feedback bits @xmath199 , under @xmath187 db and @xmath188 db respectively , and studies the effect of increasing the number of feedback bits on the outage performance .",
    "for comparison , we also plot the corresponding su outage performance with full csi case .",
    "since zpiora is an efficient suboptimal method for large number of feedback bits , we employ zpiora to obtain the outage performance instead of using optimal qpa for @xmath200 bits .",
    "first , it can be easily observed that all the outage curves decrease gradually as @xmath19 increases until @xmath19 reaches a certain threshold , when the outage probability attains a floor .",
    "this is due to the fact that in the high @xmath19 regime , the aip constraint dominates .",
    "for a fixed number of feedback bits , the higher @xmath16 is , the smaller the resultant outage probability is , since higher @xmath16 means pu can tolerate more interference .",
    "[ f2 ] also illustrates that for fixed @xmath16 , introducing one extra bit of feedback substantially reduces the outage gap between qpa and the perfect csi case .",
    "to be specific , for @xmath188 db and @xmath191 db , with @xmath201 bits , @xmath202 bits and @xmath203 bits of feedback , the outage gaps with the full csi case are approximately @xmath204 , @xmath205 and @xmath206 respectively . and for any @xmath16 , only 6 bits of feedback seem to result in an su outage performance very close to that with full csi case .",
    "+ figure [ f3 ] compares the asymptotic outage performance derived in theorem [ ut1 ] and the optimal qpa performance @xmath207 under @xmath208 db .",
    "it is clearly observed that increasing number of feedback bits substantially shrinks the outage performance gap between the asymptotic outage approximation and the corresponding optimal qpa performance .",
    "for instance , with 4 , 6 , 8 bits of feedback at @xmath191 db , the outage gap between the asymptotic outage approximation and the corresponding optimal qpa are around @xmath209 , @xmath210 , @xmath211 respectively .",
    "these results confirm that the derived asymptotic outage expressions in theorem [ ut1 ] are highly accurate for @xmath212 bits of feedback .",
    "in addition , figure [ f4 ] depicts the asymptotic outage probability behavior of su versus the number of quantization level @xmath34 at @xmath188 db , @xmath191 db , and compares the result with the corresponding full csi performance .",
    "it can be seen from figure [ f4 ] that the outage decreases as the number of quantization level @xmath34 increases , however , as @xmath34 increases beyond a certain number ( @xmath213 , i.e , @xmath212 bits ) , the outage probability curve starts to saturate and approaches the full csi performance .",
    "this further confirms that only a small number of feedback bits is enough to obtain an outage performance close to the perfect csi - based performance .",
    "in this paper , we designed optimal power allocation algorithms for secondary outage probability minimization with quantized csi information for a narrowband spectrum sharing cognitive radio framework under an atp constraint at su - tx and an aip constraint at pu - rx .",
    "we prove that the optimal channel partition structure has a  stepwise \" pattern based on which an efficient optimal power codebook design algorithm is provided . in the case of a large number of feedback bits ,",
    "we derive a novel low - complexity suboptimal algorithm zpiora which is seen to outperform alternative suboptimal algorithms based on approximations used in the existing literature .",
    "we also derive explicit expressions for asymptotic behavior of the su outage probability for a large number of feedback bits .",
    "although the presented optimal power codebook design methods result in locally optimal solutions ( due to the non - convexity of the quantized power allocation problem ) , numerical results illustrate that only 6 bits of feedback result in su outage performance very close to that obtained with full csi at the su transmitter .",
    "future work will involve extending the results to more complex wideband spectrum sharing scenario along with consideration of other types of interference constraints at the pu receiver .",
    "we use an analysis method similar to @xcite to prove our problem s optimal quantizer structure .",
