    "the nature of the dark matter  ( dm ) in the universe is one of the most fascinating mysteries of modern cosmology .",
    "unfortunately , we know little about the properties of the dark matter apart from having a very good measurement of the relic density today , @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "thanks to the efforts of the experimental community we also have several bounds from direct and indirect detection experiments , which are very important to constrain dark matter models .    the simplest dark matter model was proposed 30 years ago by silveira and zee  @xcite . in this context",
    "the dark matter candidate is a real scalar field which is stabilized by a discrete symmetry .",
    "this simple model can be considered as a toy model which allows to predict all the properties of the dark matter candidate once the relic density constraints are imposed .",
    "see refs .",
    "@xcite for previous studies of this model .",
    "recently , a possible gamma - ray excess coming from the center of our galaxy has been reported , and many studies by several groups lead to the general consensus that there is such an excess  @xcite .",
    "a recent analysis by the fermi - lat collaboration  @xcite confirms a residual emission from the galactic center .",
    "one explanation for this excess could be dark matter annihilation .",
    "this possibility has been investigated by many groups , discussing the allowed region for the dark matter mass and the annihilation cross section needed to explain the excess .",
    "see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite for recent analyses .",
    "if these results are verified by current or future experiments one could reveal some of the properties of the dark matter in our galaxy .    in this letter",
    "we investigate the possibility to account for the gamma - ray excess in the context of the simplest dark matter model .",
    "this possibility has been mentioned in previous studies where the authors concluded that it is not possible to explain the excess , see for example ref .",
    "the study in ref .",
    "@xcite was done using only dark matter masses @xmath1{gev}$ ] and assuming annihilation into two bottom quarks , since at that time this was thought to be the only allowed mass region for the excess .    given the uncertainty in the background model  @xcite , of course no conclusive statement on the origin of the excess",
    "can be made . while the apparent excess might have some astrophysical origin",
    "not properly accounted for in the background model , the uncertainties also result in a wider range of dm masses and models being able to fit the excess .",
    "this has been explicitly discussed in , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite and it is therefore worthwile to reconsider the scalar singlet dm model in some detail and check whether this simple model can provide an explanation for the excess .    in this letter we show that it is possible to account for the galactic center excess and the excess in reticulum  ii  @xcite in two regions of parameter space in this minimal model : in the low mass region very close to the standard model  ( sm ) higgs resonance where the dark matter annihilates mainly into bottom quarks and in the high mass region where the main annihilation channel is into two @xmath2 gauge bosons .",
    "we discuss the correlation between the gamma - ray excesses and the predictions for direct detection experiments and the gamma - ray lines in both mass regions .",
    "the minimal dark matter model  @xcite is the simplest extension of the standard model , since one adds only a real scalar field , @xmath3 , to the standard model particle content . in this model",
    "the higgs portal coupling defines both the relic density and the predictions for direct and indirect dark matter detection .",
    "the lagrangian of this model reads as @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the sm higgs and @xmath6 is the usual sm lagrangian .",
    "notice that this model has only two relevant parameters for our study , the higgs portal coupling @xmath7 and the physical dark matter mass @xmath8 .",
    "here @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the vacuum expectation value of the sm higgs .",
    "a discrete @xmath11 symmetry is imposed to guarantee the stability of the dark matter candidate .",

    "[ fig : visibilitylow ] one can appreciate that this gamma - ray line could be easily seen because the final state radiation is suppressed by the small bottom yukawa coupling . since the prediction for the cross section for this gamma - ray line is close to fermi - lat limit one can test this scenario in the near future .",

    "[ fig : visibilityhigh ] we show the gamma - ray spectrum for the heavy mass scenario , for @xmath29{gev}$ ] .",
    "the main contribution to final state radiation in this case is due to the dark matter annihilation into @xmath30 .",
    "as one can see , in this scenario one could see both lines , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , due to the fact that there is a large difference between the continuum and the lines .",
    "unfortunately , in this case the annihilation cross sections to gamma - ray lines are quite below the current fermi - lat limit  @xcite .",
    "recently , a possible gamma - ray excess has been reported in the dwarf galaxy reticulum ii  @xcite ; see also refs .",
    "the energy and intensity of the excess is such that it can be possibly related to the excess from the galactic center .",

    "[ fig : reticulumlow ] and [ fig : reticulumhigh ] we show the allowed values for the @xmath33-factor if this gamma - ray excess is explained by dark matter annihilation . in the low mass region the annihilation is predominantly to @xmath17 and in the high mass region to @xmath21 .",
    "the values for the @xmath33-factor we obtain are around @xmath34{gev^2 cm^{-5}}$ ] in both cases .",

    "thus , there is a strong pull by the data from reticulum ii towards mass values in which the annihilation signal to gamma gamma is strong , see fig .",
    "[ fig : predictionsgammalines ] .",
    "therefore , with this example we illustrate the possibility to explain both the gamma - ray excess in reticulum  ii and the excess in the galactic center in the context of the minimal dark matter model .     for the high mass region .",
    "in this letter we have shown that in the context of the minimal dark matter model one can have two consistent scenarios where one can explain the gamma - ray excess in the galactic center , in agreement with all other experimental constraints .    in the low mass region the dark matter mass",
    "is very close to half the standard model higgs mass and through the resonance one can explain the relic density . in this case the main annihilation is @xmath12 and the predictions for the cross section @xmath19 are very close to the experimental limits . in the heavy mass region , for @xmath20{gev}$ ] , the dark matter candidate annihilates mainly into two @xmath2 gauge bosons .",
    "the interesting feature of this region is that the predictions for the spin - independent nucleon  dm cross section are in the region that can be tested by the xenon1 t experiment .",
    "we have also shown the allowed values for the @xmath33-factor for reticulum ii in order to understand the correlation between the gamma - ray excess in the center of the galaxy and the excess in reticulum ii .",
    "our main conclusion is that both gamma - ray excesses can be explained within the minimal model for dark matter and there is no need to do model building to accommodate these signals .",
