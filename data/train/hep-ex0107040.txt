    "charm baryon lifetime measurements provide insight into the dynamics of non - perturbative heavy quark decays .",
    "the theoretical situation is rich with possibilities . unlike the case of charm mesons",
    "the exchange mechanism is not helicity suppressed and therefore can be comparable in magnitude to the spectator diagram .",
    "in addition , color suppression is only active for particular decay channels",
    ". thus spectator decays alone can not account for the hadronic width in charm baryon decay .",
    "the hadronic width is modified by at least three effects : ( a ) destructive interference between external and internal spectator diagrams , ( b ) constructive interference between internal spectator diagrams , and ( c ) @xmath30-exchange diagrams .",
    "effects ( a ) and ( b ) are expected to be operative in the decay of the @xmath0 , while ( a ) and ( c ) play a role in @xmath31 decay . while several models  @xcite can account for the apparent lifetime hierarchy , @xmath32 , a detailed understanding of the various contributions to the hadronic width requires input from experiment .    the lifetimes of the charm baryons are not measured as precisely as the charm mesons ( @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 ) which are measured , by individual experiments  @xcite , to a precision of @xmath361 - 3% .",
    "the @xmath31 s lifetime is the most precisely measured of the charm baryons .",
    "recently , cleo and selex measured this lifetime to a precision of 5%  @xcite . other charm baryon lifetimes ( @xmath0 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 )",
    "are measured to @xmath39 20% uncertainty  @xcite .",
    "this paper presents cleo s preliminary measurement of the @xmath0 lifetime , the first measurement of this lifetime from an @xmath2 colliding beam experiment .",
    "this analysis uses an integrated luminosity of 9.0 fb@xmath1 of @xmath2 annihilation data taken with the cleo ii.v detector at the cornell electron storage ring ( cesr ) .",
    "the data were taken at energies at and below the @xmath40(4s ) resonance ( @xmath41 = 10.58 gev ) and include @xmath36 11@xmath42 events .",
    "this analysis relies heavily on the charged particle tracking capabilities of the cleo ii.v detector  @xcite .",
    "the precise location of both primary and secondary vertices is greatly aided by a small - radius , low - mass beam pipe surrounded by a three - layer double - sided silicon strip tracker  @xcite .",
    "the trajectories of charged particles are reconstructed using two drift chamber systems in addition to the silicon strip tracker . for this data set the main drift chamber uses a 60:40 mixture of helium propane gas in place of its standard 50:50 argon - ethane mix .",
    "this change in gas improves both the hit efficiency and specific ionization resolution while at the same time decreases the effects of multiple scattering .",
    "a kalman filter track reconstruction algorithm  @xcite is used to reconstruct the three dimensional trajectories of charged particles .",
    "the response of the detector to both signal and background events is modeled in detail using the geant  @xcite monte carlo package .",
    "the @xmath0 is reconstructed from the decay @xmath43 .",
    "each @xmath44 is reconstructed using the @xmath45 mode while @xmath46 s are reconstructed from @xmath47 ( the charge conjugate mode is implied throughout this paper ) . for this analysis",
    "we assume that the @xmath0 is produced at the primary event vertex and is not a decay product of another long lived weakly decaying particle .",
    "each @xmath0 candidate s proper time , @xmath48 , and proper time uncertainty , @xmath49 , is determined from @xmath50 and @xmath51 in the above equations the @xmath0 mass , @xmath52 , is set to the pdg  @xcite value of 2466.3@xmath53 mev/@xmath54 .",
    "a best - fit decay vertex of the @xmath44 pseudo - track and the two @xmath55 s determines @xmath56 and its uncertainty , @xmath57 .",
    "the production point of a @xmath0 can not be well measured on an event - by - event basis .",
    "instead we use a combination of the known cesr beam profile and a measurement of the beam centroid to provide the estimate of the @xmath0 production point . in the cleo environment the dimensions ( @xmath58 ) of the beam profile are 1 cm along the beam line , @xmath59 , 350 @xmath60 m along the horizontal direction perpendicular to the beam line , @xmath61 , and 7 @xmath60 m ( @xmath62 ) along the vertical direction , @xmath63 . since the typical decay length of a @xmath0 ( @xmath64 @xmath60",
    "m ) is significantly less than the beam extent in @xmath59 and @xmath61 essentially all useful decay length information comes from the @xmath63-coordinate . a run - averaged collision point of the @xmath65 and @xmath66 beams , @xmath67 , is used to estimate @xmath68",
    ". the uncertainty in @xmath69 , @xmath70 , is also calculated run - by - run .",
    "the @xmath0 s component of momentum in the @xmath63 direction , @xmath71 , is calculated from the momentum of its decay products .",
    "while much of the @xmath0 selection criteria are similar to that of previous cleo charm baryon analyses  @xcite some additional requirements suited for a lifetime measurement are imposed . to select high momentum candidates and reduce @xmath72-meson related backgrounds we require the @xmath0 s momentum fraction , @xmath73 , to be larger than 0.5 . for each candidate",
    "we impose @xmath74 1.5 ps . a minimum @xmath43 vertex probability of 0.001 ( based on the vertex @xmath75 ) is required to obtain a sample of well - defined decay lengths . to ensure that only one @xmath0 candidate per event is used",
    ", the candidate with the smallest vertex @xmath75 is chosen in the events where multiple candidates pass all other selection criteria ( @xmath36 7% of events ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : ximass ] shows the @xmath46 , @xmath44 , and @xmath0 reconstructed mass distributions for candidates used in the lifetime analysis .",
    "a fit of the @xmath0 mass distribution using one gaussian for the signal and a linear function for the background yields @xmath76 reconstructed @xmath0 s and a gaussian @xmath58 of 4.3 mev / c@xmath77 .",
    "the fraction of background within @xmath78 of the fitted @xmath0 mass is 12.8% .",
    "the average flight path in the @xmath63 direction of the @xmath0 s used in this analysis is 100  @xmath60 m .",
    "the efficiency of the selection cuts for detecting signal monte carlo events , including ( not including ) acceptance , is 7.6% ( 17% ) .",
    "events within @xmath7940 mev/@xmath54 of the mean reconstructed @xmath0 mass ( 2468 mev/@xmath54 ) , as shown in figure  [ fig : ximass ] , are used in the determination of the @xmath0 lifetime .",
    "this wide mass region is used to estimate the non-@xmath0 contribution to the lifetime .",
    "the @xmath0 lifetime is obtained from an unbinned maximum likelihood fit to the proper time distribution .",
    "the likelihood function is @xmath80 \\nonumber \\\\      &     &     \\times \\left [      \\underbrace{(1-f_{\\rm mis}-f_{\\rm flat})g(t_{\\rm i}-t^\\prime|s \\sigma_{\\rm t , i})}_{\\rm      proper\\ time\\      resolution } +         \\underbrace{f_{\\rm mis}g(t_{\\rm i}-t^\\prime|\\sigma_{\\rm      mis})}_{\\rm mis - measured\\ frac . } +         \\underbrace{f_{\\rm flat}g(t_{\\rm i}-t^\\prime|\\sigma_{\\rm      flat})}_{\\rm flat\\ frac . }",

    "there are three inputs to the fit for each @xmath0 candidate : the measured proper time , @xmath83 , the estimated uncertainty in the proper time , @xmath84 , and a mass dependent signal probability , @xmath85 .",
    "the signal probability distribution is obtained from a fit to the @xmath0 mass distribution .",
    "the proper time distribution is parameterized as consisting of signal events with lifetime , @xmath86 , a fraction , @xmath87 , of background events with non - zero lifetime , @xmath88 , from charm backgrounds , and the remaining background events with zero lifetime .",
    "the likelihood function allows for a global scale factor , @xmath89 , for the proper time uncertainties .",
    "the likelihood function also accounts for events in which the proper time uncertainty is underestimated by fitting for a @xmath90 and fraction , @xmath91 ( caused by non - gaussian multiple scattering , for instance ) and also a fraction , @xmath92 of events with a fixed @xmath93 = 8 ps to account for proper time outliers .",
    "the unbinned maximum likelihood fit yields a signal lifetime , @xmath94 fs . the proper time distribution and the unbinned maximum likelihood fit",
    "are shown in figure  [ fig : xicpropertimedist ] .    in order to check the consistency of this lifetime",
    "result the analysis procedure is repeated as a function of @xmath0 charge , azimuthal angle , polar angle , momentum , silicon detector hit criteria , and data taking period . in all cases",
    "the lifetimes are statistically consistent .",
    "the contributions to the systematic error are given in table  [ tab : mlsystematic ] and discussed below .",
    ".contributions to the systematic error of the @xmath0 lifetime . [ cols=\"<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the uncertainty of the @xmath0 mass could be a source of bias in the lifetime measurement as this mass is used to determine the proper time .",
    "the pdg  @xcite uncertainty of the @xmath0 mass of @xmath95 yields a systematic error contribution of @xmath96 fs .",
    "the systematic bias of the @xmath0 momentum from an incorrect magnetic field could yield a systematic shift in the reconstructed masses .",
    "such a shift would then cause a bias in the lifetime measurement .",
    "we estimate this systematic error contribution to be @xmath97 fs .    the global detector size and beam pipe geometry",
    "is studied to understand their contribution to the systematic error in the lifetime .",
    "the results of the study yield a lifetime uncertainty of 0.1% resulting in a systematic error contribution of @xmath790.5 fs .",
    "the potential bias in the decay length measurement is determined by measuring the average decay length of a `` zero - lifetime '' sample of @xmath98 events .",
    "we measure an average decay length of @xmath990.9 @xmath60 m and use the uncertainty in this measurement to calculate the contribution to the total systematic error .",
    "the average of the quotient of 0.9 @xmath100 and the @xmath101 for each @xmath0 candidate is 2.5 fs .",
    "we take this to be the estimate of the @xmath0 proper time bias due to a decay length bias .",
    "adding these two systematic errors in quadrature yields 2.5 fs .",
    "the signal probability , @xmath85 , contribution to the systematic error is obtained from differences in the fitted lifetime values when the signal probability is varied by @xmath102 .",
    "this study yields a systematic error of @xmath103 fs .",
    "the proper time outlier contribution is obtained from the maximal difference of lifetimes from the following three methods of accounting for outliers : a ) a @xmath93 = 8 ps contribution in the likelihood function ( this is the nominal method of accounting for proper time outliers ) , b ) a @xmath93 = 16 ps contribution in the likelihood function , and c ) a proper time cut ( absolute value ) of less than 4 ps and no @xmath93 contribution to the likelihood function .",
    "the maximal difference between these three methods is 3.3 fs which is taken as the proper time outlier systematic error .    the @xmath63 beam position systematic error estimates the variation in the lifetime when the @xmath63 beam position is shifted from its true position .",
    "shifting the beam spot location subsequently shifts decay length and proper time measurements . for an infinite data sample in a perfectly isotropic detector , a shift in the @xmath63 beam position would not affect a lifetime measurement as it would average out to zero .",
    "a possible lifetime bias can be estimated by measuring the lifetime after shifting the @xmath63 beam spot location .",
    "the beam spot location is shifted by various amounts , and in the vicinity of zero shift , the slope of the change in lifetime vs. the change in beam position location is 3.5 fs/@xmath100 . multiplying this slope by @xmath79@xmath104 , the uncertainty in the @xmath63 beam position , yields a systematic error of @xmath797 fs .",
    "there is a correlation between the measured proper time and reconstructed mass of a charm meson or baryon .",
    "this correlation is due to the mis - measurement of the opening angle(s ) between the daughter tracks in a short - lived decay .",
    "an overestimate of the opening angle(s ) tends to bias the measured proper time and mass to larger values of these quantities . in fig .",
    "[ fig : mcdatatauvsivm ] the average lifetime vs. invariant mass correlation is shown for case of the @xmath0 using both data and monte carlo events . there is good agreement in the rate of change in lifetime vs. invariant mass for the two samples .",
    "the proper time vs. mass contribution to the systematic error is obtained by multiplying the slope of the lifetime vs. measured @xmath105 reconstructed mass by the @xmath58 of the central mass value .",
    "this contribution to the systematic uncertainty is @xmath797.2 fs .    in order to check for other sources that could bias the lifetime measurement , e.g. event selection and likelihood function parameterization ,",
    "a sample consisting of background events extracted from cleo ii.v data and simulated @xmath0 events is studied .",
    "the relative amount of signal and background component in the sample is arranged to be the same as that of the full cleo ii.v data set .",
    "this data set is run through the full analysis and the @xmath0 lifetime extracted from the maximum likelihood fit is compared with the input lifetime ( 449.0 fs ) .",
    "this procedure yields a @xmath0 lifetime of 443.2 @xmath79 9.2 fs , 5.8 fs lower than the input monte carlo signal lifetime . the statistical uncertainty in this measurement , 9.2 fs , is included as a component of the total systematic error ( `` monte carlo statistics '' ) in table  [ tab : mlsystematic ] .",
    "the 5.8 fs difference between the input and output signal monte carlo lifetime is applied as a correction to the @xmath0 lifetime value from the cleo ii.v data .    to estimate the systematic error due to the mass range used in the maximum likelihood fit ( @xmath7940 mev / c@xmath77 ) a study",
    "is performed where the mass interval is varied and the lifetime recalculated .",
    "a variety of mass intervals are used in the study including narrower intervals ( e.g. @xmath7920 mev / c@xmath77 ) , wider intervals ( e.g. @xmath7960 mev / c@xmath77 ) and asymmetric intervals ( e.g. @xmath10660,+40 mev / c@xmath77 ) . from the results of this study a systematic error of @xmath7910 fs is assigned due to the mass region used in the maximum likelihood fit .",
    "the final measured @xmath0 lifetime value ( without systematic error ) is @xmath107 fs . the total systematic uncertainty of @xmath7918 fs is obtained by adding all the contributions listed in table  [ tab : mlsystematic ] in quadrature .",
    "a new measurement of the @xmath0 lifetime , @xmath108 fs , has been made using the cleo ii.v detector and 9.0 fb@xmath1 of integrated luminosity .",
    "this is the first @xmath0 lifetime measurement from an @xmath2 experiment .",
    "many of the contributions to the systematic error in this measurement are different from those of fixed - target experiments .",
