    "optimizing pinning in superconductors ( sc ) is a problem that is interesting both experimentally and theoretically since pinning is the main viable mechanism for superconductivity in the presence of external magnetic field .",
    "many tools and mechanisms for pinning has already been studied , in particular the use of crystal defects such as holes , non - magnetic impurities and both linear and screw dislocations .",
    "pinning using structural defects suffers from many drawbacks , the most important is that the pins are randomly distributed which results in a low critical current . in recent years",
    ", it was claimed that pinning could be optimized if we employ ferromagnetic ( fm ) nano textures to pin superconducting vortices ( sv ) .",
    "@xcite-@xcite    the main obstacles of using ferromagnetic textures to pin superconducting vortices are the proximity effects which destroy superconductivity .",
    "lyuksyutov and pokrovsky noticed that proximity effects could be suppressed if a thin layer of insulator oxide is sandwiched between the fm and the sc.@xcite due to this separation between the fm and sc , the interaction between them is mediated via their magnetic fields .",
    "if the magnetization of the fm structure exceeds a threshold value @xmath1 , the interaction between the fm and sc makes the spontaneous creation of superconducting vortices energy favorable .",
    "the interaction between the fm and sc increases as the temperature reaches the superconducting transition temperature @xmath2 from below .",
    "et.al._@xcite considered a system consisting of a thin ferromagnetic dot embedded in a superconducting thin film .",
    "both the superconductor and the ferromagnet are assumed to lie in the @xmath3-plane and the dot is magnetized along @xmath4-axis . by numerically solving the nonlinear ginzburg - landau equation , they were able to show that a vortex appears in the superconductor when the magnetization of the dot exceeds a critical value .",
    "they also showed that increasing the dot s magnetization leads to a giant vortex state with multiple flux quanta .    in ref .",
    ", erdin _ et.al .",
    "_ used london s theory of superconductors to solve the general problem of the interaction between vortices in superconducting thin film with a generic two - dimensional ferromagnetic structure .",
    "they applied their results to the cases when the fm structure is a circular dot whose magnetization is either parallel or perpendicular to the plane of the superconductor .",
    "they calculated the threshold value for the dot s magnetization at which vortices are spontaneously created in the superconductor .",
    "they showed that by increasing the magnetization of the dot a series of phase transitions between phases with different number of vortices take place .    , length @xmath5 and magnetization @xmath6.,width=288 ]    all these studies focused on cases in which the ferromagnet is either a point - like dipole or an infinitely thin two - dimensional texture whose plane is parallel to the plane of the superconductor .",
    "the problem of interaction between vortices in superconducting thin film with a ferromagnetic columnar defect ( fcd ) has not been studied yet .",
    "this case is both theoretically and experimentally interesting for the following reason .",
    "the magnetic field of the vortex in a superconducting thin film is not confined to the plane of the film but it also exist outside of it .",
    "if the ferromagnet extends in space outside the film and its close proximity then the vortex will be bound more strongly to the ferromagnet due to the interaction of its magnetic field with the magnetization of the ferromagnet .",
    "this enhances vortex pinning and consequently the critical current of the superconductor .",
    "it is also important to note that ferromagnetic columnar defects makes the superconductor has a multiply connected topology which is another source of pinning .",
    "therefore , it would be interesting both theoretically and experimentally to study the statical and dynamical properties of a superconducting thin film pierced by ferromagnetic columnar defects .    in this article",

    "i calculate the total energy of a system of a superconducting vortex coupled to the magnetic defect .",
    "i generalize these results to the case of a superconducting thin film pierced by a square array of magnetic columnar defects in section four then i summarize the results of this work in section five .",
    "i consider a superconducting thin film in the @xmath3-plane pierced by a finite ferromagnetic nano rod whose radius is @xmath0 and length is @xmath7 as shown in fig .",
    "i also assume that the fcd is uniformly magnetized along its symmetry axis then its magnetization distribution is written as    @xmath8    where @xmath9 is the unit vector along the @xmath4-axis .",
    "the magnetic field produced by the fcd penetrates the superconductor and changes the distribution of the screening current . in the london approximation",
    "the fcd - sc system is described by london - maxwell equation @xmath10 the total current @xmath11 is the sum of the supercurrent @xmath12 and the magnetization current @xmath13 .",

    "note that in the case of a single columnar defect , the antivortex is repelled ( pushed far away ) from the fcd ; therefore , it was not taken into account in the calculations .",

    "i calculated the magnetic field of the fcd in the presence of the sc and the distribution of screening currents in the superconductor .",
    "if the magnetization of the fcd exceeds a critical value , then the fcd interaction with the vortex will overcome the vortex self energy leading to the spontaneous creation of vortices in the superconductor .",
    "i showed that vortex pinning is strongly enhanced due to the contribution from the interaction between the magnetic field of vortices and the magnetization of the fcd outside the plane of the sc and its close proximity .",
    "this extra contribution to vortex pinning is a major difference between this study and other studies in the literature which focused on dipole - like or two - dimensional ferromagnetic structures .",
