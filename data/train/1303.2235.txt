    "realization of efficient multi - mode quantum memory ( qm ) is a topical problem of quantum optics and quantum information science .",
    "there are a number of proposals which have provided a large progress in the last decade @xcite , however a simultaneous realization of main requirements such as almost ideal quantum efficiency and fidelity , long - lived and multi - mode capacity of qm is still the subject of intensive investigations @xcite .",
    "photon echo based qm @xcite is one of the promising techniques where most successful experimental results have demonstrated for the efficient quantum storage of multi - mode light fields in a free propagation scheme with controlled reversible inhomogeneous broadening ( crib ) realized via switching of the external electric ( or magnetic ) field gradients @xcite ( known as a gradient echo memory ( gem ) .",
    "however the potentially acceptable properties of this technique have their limitations in a maximum value of controlled inhomogeneous broadening ( ib ) and in the realization of ultimately narrow homogeneous broadening and therefore these two factors confine the multi - mode capacity , atomic decoherence and optical depth on the resonant atomic transition . in order to resolve these problems ,",
    "the new approaches have been proposed later such as the photon echo technique qm on the ib line composed of the periodic atomic frequency combs ( afc - protocol ) @xcite which has been successfully demonstrated for the broadband @xcite and multi - mode storage @xcite ( see also the modified afc scheme @xcite providing theoretically almost 100 % quantum efficiency for the broadband light fields and new scheme of qm based on broadband slow light in afc - media @xcite ) .",
    "however , a sufficiently high quantum efficiency can be realized only for rather narrow afcs which remains a serious experimental problem .",
    "there are other proposals of the photon / spin echo based qms , in particular using the natural ibs @xcite .",
    "however so far all the approaches still have physical problems in experimental realizations of the practically significant physical properties .",
    "recently we have proposed a photon echo qm in the optimal resonant cavity with crib technique for rephasing of atomic coherence and demonstrated its effective integration into the quantum computer scheme @xcite .",
    "the qed cavity approach provides a perfect time reversal retrieval of the multi - mode light fields for optically thin atomic system if an ideal crib procedure @xcite can be successfully realized .",
    "similarly the afc protocol has been proposed for qed cavity @xcite , meanwhile it can not provide a time reversal dynamics .",
    "the recent experiment @xcite has confirmed the possibility of photon echo qm with optically thin media . perfect crib procedure in gem technique",
    "can be implemented on the atomic ensembles provided that resonant linewidth is reduced to narrow homogeneous broadening for strong elimination of the atomic decoherence but it decreases the effective optical depth and can lead to some experimental difficulties . for example , realization of crib procedure in qed cavity can disturb the cavity tuning and resonant interaction of the cavity mode with atomic ensemble .",
    "thus it is highly desirable to find a simpler experimental solution to overcome the physical problems related to the rephasing of macroscopic coherence in ib atomic systems . in this paper",
    "we propose a new simple scheme for highly efficient multi - mode optical qm which resolves basic problems by using well - known experimental technique . for this purpose",
    "we combine the specific advantages of the photon echo qm in optical qed - cavity with off - resonant raman type of atomic transition @xcite in one scheme .",
    "thus the proposed scheme almost ideally works with natural ib line characterized by ultra - narrow homogeneous isochromatic components .",
    "also the used optical qed - cavity opens a convenient way for delicate rephasing of the atomic coherence excited in ib system without significant excitation of the additional quantum noises and other undesirable negative effects with respect to the control laser fields and the predetermined atomic evolution .",
    "below we describe a basic model and main physical properties of the proposed qm scheme . then we summarize the critical physical requirements and outline the possible experimental realizations .",
    "we analyze interaction of three - level multi - atomic system with a single mode of qed cavity coupled with external signal field modes .",

    ", we have a quite weaker demand even for the raman scheme of atomic transition .",
    "we rewrite the condition for absorption coefficient @xmath152 which can be easily realized in experiments with optical qed cavities . to give an example let us assume @xmath153 and @xmath154 cm ( or @xmath59 cm )",
    ", we get @xmath155 ( or @xmath156 ) . by assuming also @xmath157 and @xmath158 we get the matching condition for the optical absorption coefficient @xmath159 independent of @xmath143 .",
    "usually @xmath160 lays in the range @xmath161 for rare - earth ions in the inorganic crystals @xcite where @xmath162 sec@xmath163 .",
    "thus the matching condition clearly indicates a possiblilty of using the atomic systems with a quite small optical absorption coefficients @xmath164 and even @xmath165 that means a lower density of the resonant atoms and weaker interatomic dipole - dipole interactions , respectively , that also promises a larger lifetime of the atomic coherence @xmath166 .",
    "we also note that we can vary ib linewidth @xmath89 in external constant electrical or magnetic fields without using crib procedure for perfect retrieval .",
    "it is worth noting off resonant raman interaction facilitates an experimental realization of the impedance matching condition due to the possible tuning of rabi frequency @xmath29 and spectral detuning @xmath167 : @xmath168 which is important for the atomic media with arbitrary number n of effective three - level atoms .",
    "another well - known important advantage of the raman scheme is a direct mapping of the input light fields on the long - lived atomic transition @xmath169 so the transition can be completely forbidden for realization of spontaneous coherent atomic irradiation on this transition and this atomic transition will suppress many relaxation processes providing a large @xmath166 for long - lived storage of the input signal fields .    the second condition 2 ) called _ optimal spectral matching condition _",
    "@xcite demonstrates an optimal coupling of the spectral shapes related to the atomic ib and qed cavity window transparency which provides an effective quantum storage for broadened spectral range of input signal fields where the ss - function @xmath170 .",
    "the excited atomic systems is characterized by completely dephased coherence ( [ coher - st ] ) on the transition @xmath169 and the light field retrieval requires a perfect rephasing of the atomic coherence for subsequent irradiation of the echo field .",
    "let us now consider the retrieval stage .",
    "retrieval still remains the most critical stage in the photon echo qms .",
    "here we propose an efficient solution of this problem by using the specific advantages of raman based techniques for the atomic coherent control in optical qed - cavity .",

    "to @xmath59 cm .",
    "we also assume the input laser pulses parameters provide a perfect quantum transition @xmath46 characterized by the pulse area equal to @xmath176 .",
    "also we can implement the excited transient optical coherences @xmath181 and @xmath182 are not coupled with any qed - cavity modes since the carrier frequencies of the laser pulses @xmath183 and @xmath184 can be shifted from the resonant frequencies of the qed - cavity modes as depicted in fig.[rammfig4 ] .    in comparison with the properties of usual photon echo qm schemes , we show the control intensive light fields will propagate through medium in our scheme without significant backward influence of the atomic medium , i.e. the atomic system can be characterized by negligibly small optical depth for the control laser fields . in order to clarify the noted key scheme advantages we examine the light - atoms dynamics for the case of short control light pulses and then we characterize the optimal atomic parameters . similarly to the storage stage we assume a sufficiently large optical detuning @xmath185 ( see fig .

    "thus a new scheme of photon echo quantum memory based on the raman atomic transition in qed cavity has been proposed .",
    "the scheme involves a number of unique advantages which all are critical for realization of fine robust coherent control of the interaction between the ib atomic systems and weak single photon fields .",
    "this scheme makes it possible to use the optically thin atomic systems with natural ib on the raman transition which can be characterized by arbitrary narrow homogeneous isochromatic groups of atoms as it occurs for the forbidden transition for rare - earth ions in inorganic crystals @xcite , nv - centers in diamond @xcite and in other solid state systems @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the used optical qed cavity provides a fine control of the atomic ensembles by external laser fields propagating without any losses along transverse path to the qed cavity mode while a strong enhancement of the atomic interaction with the cavity mode field offers an easer experimental method for highly efficient quantum storage of rather arbitrary multi - mode light fields in the optical thin medium .",
    "thus the scheme provides a number of experimental tools immune to many typical decoherent processes for a robust implementation of the practically realizable qm . the proposed optical qm can be easily implemented with well - known optical technique on various atomic ensembles in a broad spectral range of the light fields . in particular it",
    "can be also realized on the planar superconducting resonators with transverse coherent laser control of resonant atomic ( spin ) ensembles .",
    "this scheme is promising for the quantum repeaters based on the light - atom interface coupling microwave and optical photons and for the quantum ram in superconducting quantum computer .",
    "all the mentioned properties indicate a great potential for using this technique in quantum repeaters and in quantum random access memory for quantum computers .",
