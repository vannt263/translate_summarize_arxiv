    "the cluster galaxy population has evolved rapidly over the last 4 gyr ( butcher & oemler @xcite ) . while distant clusters are dominated , particularly at faint magnitudes , by blue spiral galaxies , often with signs of disturbed morphologies and evidence of multiple recent star - formation events ( dressler et al .",
    "@xcite ) , local clusters are completely dominated by passive early - type galaxies .    recent observational studies on the luminosity , colours , morphology and spectral properties of galaxies have pointed out that the physical mechanisms which produce the transformation in galaxies affecting both the structure and the star formation are naturally driven by and related to the environment ( e.g. , treu et al .",
    "these processes are linked in various ways to the local density and the properties of the intra - cluster medium ( icm ) .",
    "in fact , galaxy - icm interactions , such as ram - pressure stripping and suffocation , require a dense icm and take place principally in the central cluster regions .",
    "the high density regions are also characterized by a steep cluster potential , and we can expect that galaxy - cluster gravitational interactions such as tidal stripping and tidal triggering are also dominant . on the contrary , in low - density environment galaxies",
    "have never been through the cluster centre and therefore have never experienced the effects of tidal stripping and tidal triggering of star formation , so the dominant mechanisms are galaxy - galaxy interactions , in terms of both low - speed interactions between galaxies of similar mass ( mergers ) and high - speed interactions between galaxies in the potential of the cluster ( harassment ) .",
    "the above mentioned mechanisms affect differently the observed morphology and/or the star formation properties of galaxies .",
    "in particular , galaxy harassment and ram pressure stripping cause a partial loss of gas mass and , depending on the fraction of gas removed and its rate , ram - pressure stripping can lead either to a rapid quenching of star formation or to a slow decrease in the star formation rate ( larson , tinsley , & caldwell @xcite ; balogh et al .",
    "@xcite ; diaferio et al .",

    "@xcite ) . successive high - speed encounters between galaxies ( galaxy harassment )",
    "lead to gas inflow and strong star formation activity ( fujita @xcite ) .    with the aim to investigate the effects of the environment on the galaxy population",
    ", we have undertaken an optical study of the shapley supercluster ( ssc ) core , one of the densest structures in the nearby universe .",
    "the study of this region , selected because of its physical peculiarity in terms of density and complexity , but also for the availability of multiwavelength observations , will take advantage of deep optical photometry from the eso archive covering an area of 2 deg@xmath1 .",
    "the shapley optical survey ( sos ) in b and r bands provides a galaxy sample complete and reliable up to 22.5 mag and 22.0 mag in b and r bands , respectively .",
    "we plan to use the excellent sos dataset to study , with respect to the supercluster environment , the distribution of galaxy populations both in luminosity and colour and the galaxy structural properties comparing the observations with theoretical predictions . in the present paper",
    "we will present the dataset , the catalogues and the galaxy luminosity functions in b and r bands as function of the ssc environment .",
    "the galaxy luminosity function ( lf ) , which describes the number of galaxies per unit volume as function of luminosity , is a powerful tool to constrain galaxy transformations , since it is directly related to the galaxy mass function .",
    "moreover , the effect of environment on the observed galaxy lf could provide a powerful discriminator among the proposed mechanisms for the transformations of galaxies .",
    "the effects of galaxy merging and suffocation on the cluster galaxy population have been studied through combining high - resolution n - body simulations with semi - analytic models for galaxy evolution ( e.g. , springel et al .",
    "@xcite ; kang et al .",
    "these show that while galaxy merging is important for producing the most luminous cluster galaxies , the resultant lf can always be well described by a schechter ( schechter @xcite ) function , although both m@xmath3 and the faint - end slope can show mild trends with environment .",
    "galaxy mergers are also inhibited once the relative encounter velocities become much greater than the internal velocity dispersion of galaxies , and so are rare in rich clusters ( ghigna et al .",
    "@xcite ) . in contrast",
    ", galaxy harassment and ram - pressure stripping may change the lf shape as galaxies lose mass in interactions with other galaxies , the cluster s tidal field , and the icm .",
    "in particular @xcite ( @xcite ) showed that harassment has virtually no effect on a system as dense as a giant elliptical galaxy or a spiral bulge and only purely disk galaxies can be turned into spheroidals , so these mechanisms produces a cutoff for sd - im galaxies . since the luminosity function is strongly type specific , and those for sc and sd / im galaxies can be described by narrow ( @xmath10 mag ) gaussian distributions centred at @xmath0 m@xmath111 and @xmath0 m@xmath12 ( de lapparent @xcite ) , the effects of galaxy harassment could be characterized by a dip in the lf at these magnitudes .    in order to further investigate and to assess the relative importance of the processes that may be responsible for the galaxy transformations , we have performed a photometric study of the ssc core , examining in particular the effect of the environment through the comparison of luminosity functions in regions with different local densities .",
    "the ssc was observed by raychaudhury ( @xcite ) and the lf was firstly derived by metcalfe , godwin & peach ( @xcite ; hereafter mgp94 ) . by using photographic data",
    ", they investigate a region of 4.69 deg@xmath1 around the cluster a3558 considering a sample of 4599 galaxies complete and uncontamiminated by stars ( to 2@xmath13 level ) for @xmath14 .",
    "the derived lf for the central region of 1.35 deg@xmath1 showed a broad peak in the number of galaxies at @xmath15 which can not be well fitted by a schechter function .",
    "moreover , mgp94 found a deficit of blue galaxies in the a3558 core suggesting morphological segregation .",
    "however , their study is limited to bright magnitudes , preventing the determination of the faint - end slope while taking advantage of deeper photometry and larger sample of galaxies distributed in larger ssc area , we can provide clear evidence on the lf shape thus quantifying the environmental effect on the lf properties .",

    "the shapley core ( fig .  [ fig1 ] ) is constituted by three abell clusters : a3558 ( z=0.048 , melnick & quintana @xcite ; metcalfe , godwin & spenser @xcite ; abell richness r=4 , abell , corwin & olowin @xcite ) , a3562 ( z=0.049 , @xcite @xcite , r=2 , abell et al .",

    "a major study of the dynamical properties of the supercluster core was performed by bardelli et al .",
    "( @xcite and reference therein ) .",
    "they showed that the supercluster core has a complex , highly elongated structure , and identified 21 significant 3-dimensional subclumps , including eight in the a3558 cluster alone .",
    "the x - ray observations show that the supercluster has a flattened and elongated morphology where clusters outside the dense core are preferentially located in hot gas filaments ( bardelli , zucca , & malizia @xcite ; kull & b@xmath28hringer @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ) . moreover , finoguenov et al .",

    "( @xcite ) suggested that this halo is connected with the head - on radio galaxy of a3562 .",
    "bardelli et al .",
    "( @xcite ) suggested that the a3558 complex is undergoing a strong dynamical evolution through major merging seen just after the first core - core encounter , and so the merging event has already been able to induce modifications in the galaxy properties .",
    "very recently , miller ( @xcite ) , with a radio survey of a 7 deg@xmath1 region of ssc , found a dramatic increase in the probability for galaxies in the vicinity of a3562 and sc1329 - 313 to be associated with radio emission .",
    "he interpreted this fact as a young starburst related to the recent merger of sc1329 - 31 with a3562 .",
    "the sos data obtained from the eso archive ( 68.a-0084 , p.i .",

    "the total exposure times for each field are 1500 s ( 300 s @xmath29 5 ) in b band and 1200 s ( 240 s @xmath29 5 ) in r band , reaching the r=25 ( b=25.5 ) at 5@xmath8 .",

    "the number of stars and galaxies become equal at @xmath34 . beyond @xmath33 the fraction of stars misclassified as galaxies increases dramatically mainly due to the blending of the sources . moreover , further stellar contamination is due to the high number density of both stars and galaxies in this field ( the galactic latitude of the field is @xmath35 ) which increases the frequency of star - star and star - galaxy blends that can be misclassified as single galaxies .",
    "the estimates of completeness and reliability for the r band are shown in table  [ completeness ] .",
    "analogous results were obtained for the b band .",
    "we adopted the conservative limits @xmath33 and @xmath36 as the magnitudes below which stellar contamination can be modelled and accounted for in the galaxy lf determination .",
    "to study the effect of the environment on galaxies in the ssc core , the local density of galaxies , @xmath37 , was determined across the wfi mosaic .",
    "this was achieved using an adaptive kernel estimator ( pisani @xcite ; @xcite ) , in which each galaxy @xmath38 is represented by a gaussian kernel , @xmath39 , whose width @xmath40 is proportional to @xmath41 thus matching the resolution locally to the density of information available . for this study , we considered the surface number density of r@xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) galaxies , with an additional colour cut applied to reject those galaxies more than 0.2 mag redder in b - r than the observed red sequence ( eq .  [ cm ] ) to minimize background contamination .",
    "as there are no known structures in the foreground of the ssc core ( 90% of r@xmath44 galaxies have redshifts confirming that they belong to the supercluster ) , any substructure identified in the density map is likely to be real and belonging to the supercluster .",

    "we fitted the observed galaxy counts with a single schechter ( s ) function .",
    "however , since the lfs were generally poorly fitted by using such a model , the fits were also computed with the sum of gaussian and schechter ( g+s ) functions ( sect .  [ sec:62 ] and sect .

    "however , it is difficult to reconcile the dramatic deviations from the s function observed for intermediate- and low - density regions with the transformation of field galaxies being due to just merging or suffocation , neither of which should alter the shape of lf , whilst they can be explained more easily by a scenario involving mass loss of low - luminosity galaxies .",
    "one such mechanism is galaxy harassment ( moore et al .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) , whereby repeated close ( @xmath6650kpc ) high - velocity ( @xmath21000kms@xmath18 ) encounters with bright galaxies and the cluster s tidal field cause impulsive gravitational shocks that damage the fragile disks of late - type spirals .",
    "the cumulative effect of these shocks is the transformation of late - type spirals to spheroidal galaxies over a period of several gyr .",
    "an important aspect of galaxy harassment is that it has virtually no effect on systems as dense as giant elliptical or spiral bulges , and hence only pure disk systems ( sc or later ) are affected . while these galaxies make up the vast majority of the faint ( m@xmath2m@xmath3 + 2 ) cluster galaxy population at @xmath67 , they become rarer exponentially at brighter magnitudes .",
    "the encounters can drive the bulk of the dark matter and 2075% of the stars over the tidal radius of the harassed galaxy , whereas in contrast the bulk of the gas collapses inward , and is consumed in a nuclear starburst .",
    "the combined results of these effects is a dimming of the harassed galaxy by @xmath68 magnitudes due to mass loss and passive aging of the remaining stars .",
    "these remnants are apparent in present day clusters as dwarf spheroids which often show blue cores suggesting nuclear star - formation , as well as remnant disk and bar components ( graham , jerjen & guzman @xcite ) , and signs of rotational support ( de rijcke et al .",
    "@xcite ) .    in agreement with the recent work by popesso et al .",
    "( @xcite ) we suggest that the observed dip at @xmath69 as well as the strong dependence on environment shown by the faint - end slope in the cluster galaxy luminosity can be explained naturally as the consequence of galaxy harassment .",
    "alternative mechanisms such as ram - pressure stripping by the icm or tidal stripping can effect the galaxy population only in the cluster cores , which appears inconsistent with our observation that the dip is greatest in the low - density regions 12mpc from the nearest cluster .",
    "however , given the high infall velocities , any galaxy encountering the icm is likely to be stripped rapidly of their gas , bringing star - formation to a swift halt . given the high infall velocities , and the typical highly eccentric orbits of cluster galaxies , the low- and intermediate - density regions are likely to contain a significant fraction of galaxies that have already encountered the dense icm . in high - density regions , high - velocity dispersions inhibit merging processes ( e.g. , mihos @xcite ) , hence it is unlikely that dwarf galaxies merge to produce bigger galaxies at the cluster centres .",
    "the most likely explanation for the lack of dwarf galaxies near the centre is tidal or collisional disruption of the dwarf galaxies .",
    "this interpretation is also confirmed when analysing separately red sequence galaxies .",
    "in fact the red galaxy counts exhibit a behaviour similar to those of the lfs obtained with a statistical background subtraction , confirming the excess of dwarf early type galaxies .",
    "moreover , differently from red sequence galaxies , the blue galaxy lfs are well described by a s function with a slope @xmath70 -1.50 and do not vary with density .",
    "this slope is consistent with those recently derived by blanton et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and madgwick et al .",
    "( @xcite ) for field sdss and 2df galaxies respectively .",
    "this suggest that the observed blue galaxy population is characterized by infalling galaxies that have not yet interacted with the super cluster environment and transformed by the harassment mechanism .    in a forthcoming paper ( haines et al .",
    "@xcite ) we will investigate in detail the distribution of red and blue galaxies in the ssc environment .",
