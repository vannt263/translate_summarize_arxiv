    "during last two decades the problem of existence of so - called semimagic numbers of nucleons is widely discussed ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite , where one can find a bibliography on this problem ) .",
    "the existence of semimagic numbers is considered as a result of the appearance of a new gap in the single - nucleon level scheme by adding a pair of neutrons ( or protons ) and its disappearance by adding another pair .",
    "such an effect is believed to be caused by the interaction between valence protons and neutrons .",
    "for the first time the surmise about importance of the @xmath0-interaction was made by a.de shalit and m.goldhaber @xcite in the shell model in connection with the appearance of nuclear deformation .",
    "p.federman and s.pittel @xcite showed that the interaction between neutrons and protons with strongly overlapped orbits may lead to the appearance of nuclear deformation . at the same time",
    "they have shown that this interaction may essentially change the single - nucleon level scheme .",
    "this interaction becomes important when interacting neutron and proton have big radial or big and close orbital quantum numbers .",
    "therefore semimagic quantum numbers are less steady than `` classical '' ones .    as to methods of finding semimagic quantum numbers of nucleons it seems that shell model calculations taking into account the @xmath0-interaction of valence nucleons can not be regarded as reliable because the form and intensity of this interaction seem to be rather uncertain",
    ". therefore semimagic numbers can be found by indirect ways , namely using a comparative analysis of some properties of neighboring nuclei , such as biding energies of nucleons , spectroscopic data ( _ e.g. _ _ g_-factor values , change of the sign for the coefficient of _",
    "e2-m1 _ mixture in electromagnetic transitions @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 of even - even nuclei _ etc _ ) .    in the next section",
    "we show that the analysis of inelastic scattering cross sections of low - energy neutrons on even - even nuclei gives a reliable method for finding semimagic numbers of nucleons .",
    "section 3 presents some examples of the concrete application of this method .",
    "and section 4 contains some conclusive remarks .",
    "low - energy neutron data for even - even nuclei with @xmath4 were successfully described @xcite by the authors of this paper in terms of the coupled channel optical model ( ccom ) .",
    "these data , taken for neutron energies @xmath5mev , included total and elastic scattering cross sections , cross sections of inelastic scattering corresponding to the excitation of @xmath6 level , angular distributions for elastic and inelastic scattering .",
    "we used two - phonon ( five - channel ) approximation of ccom for spherical nuclei , and three - channel rotational approximation for nonspherical ones .",
    "details of ccom are described by e.s.konobeevsky , i.v.surkova _ et al _ @xcite .    in our calculation",
    "we used nonspherical optical potential with the real part of woods - saxon s form .",
    "the real part included the spin - orbital term and the symmetry potential .",
    "radial dependance of the absorptive part was taken as the derivative of the real part of the form - factor since namely the nuclear surface is responsible for absorption of low - energy neutrons .",
    "geometrical parameters of the potential were the same for real and imaginary parts : the potential radius was fixed as @xmath7 with @xmath8fm , the nuclear diffuseness parameter was initially chosen to be equal to 0.65fm , but for some nuclei ( see below ) it was somewhat changed .",
    "the spin - orbit interaction parameter @xmath9 was equal to 8mev .",
    "the real part of our potential included the isotopical term proportional to @xmath10 , so that the depth of the real part of the potential had the following form :    @xmath11    where @xmath12mev .",
    "the depths @xmath13 ( of real part ) and @xmath14 ( of imaginary part ) were two free parameters to fit .",
    "the values of the quadrupole deformation parameter @xmath15 were taken from compillation @xcite .",
    "the optimal description of all the totality of low - energy neutron data for even - even nuclei under consideration was achieved using practically the same values of model parameters @xmath13 and @xmath14 , namely , @xmath16mev and @xmath17mev . as to diffuseness parameter @xmath18 , in order to get a good description of all the nuclei under consideration ( including nonspherical ones ) with the same values of @xmath13 and @xmath14 , we had to change the diffuseness parameter for nonspherical nuclei from the initial value of 0.65fm up to 0.70  0.75fm .",
    "for the same reason we slightly diminished the value of @xmath18 for some spherical nuclei which were found to be magic or semimagic , taking @xmath190.55 ",
    "0.60fm for magic and semimagic nuclei and @xmath20fm for double - magic ones .",
    "these alterations in numerical values of @xmath18 seem to be consistent ( at least , qualitatively ) with the experimental data and theoretical view on the thickness of nuclear surface lay ; on the other hand , they are important for finding semimagic numbers of nucleons ( see below ) .    note , that using ccom with these parameter values we also obtained a good description @xcite of the experimental data on @xmath21- , @xmath22- and @xmath23-neutron strength functions and potential scattering lengths for nuclei under consideration .",
    "the analysis of inelastic neutron cross sections led us to so - called @xmath24-systematics @xcite : we showed that the inelastic cross section with the @xmath6 level excitation , taken at the energy equal to 300kev over the threshold and averaged over the energy range of 100kev , seems to be a smooth function of @xmath24  the product of valence proton and neutron numbers ( or their holes ) .",
    "the curve , presenting this function @xmath25 and shown with experimental points in those publications , was obtained using the least square method . the corrected and more precise version of this plot is given by fig.1 of this paper .",
    "note , that the curve presenting a function @xmath26 may also be well described as @xmath27 with @xmath280.5b and @xmath290.14b .",
    "emphasize , that this approximation is not good for big ( @xmath30 ) values of @xmath31 .",
    "kev over threshold _ vs. _ the @xmath24-product , width=302 ]",
    "since the @xmath24-product depends on the beginning and the end of the upper shells of the nucleus , the @xmath31-systematics combined with ccom - calculations may serve as a method of finding semimagic numbers of nucleons .",
    "the main scheme of this method is as follows .",
    "if the cross section of neutron inelastic scattering for an even - even nucleus is essentially less than for neighboring even - even nuclei ( usually it is near by 0.5b ) and therefore the corresponding experimental point on the plot of fig.1 deviates from the curve @xmath25 , we change the beginning ( or the end ) of valence shell in order `` to restore the agreement '' . as a result of this operation",
    ", we obtain a new value of the valence nucleon product and thereby  a new number of nucleons corresponding to the beginning ( or the end ) of valence shell , _",
    "i.e. _ a new magic number .",
    "this result may be considered as preliminary one ; to confirm it we can see what is the result of the ccom - description of this nucleus , namely , what is the value of diffuseness parameter : if the value of the diffuseness parameter is essentially less than 0.65fm ( 0.50  0.60fm ) it means that the preliminary result is confirmed and a new semimagic number is found , if not  it is necessary to use another method to confirm or to reject the preliminary result .",
    "such an important role of the diffuseness parameter in our method is based on the high sensitivity of the ccom - calculation results to the diffusion parameter value .",
    "thus , our method is expected to be efficient if neutron inelastic cross sections for the considered nucleus and for its `` neighbors '' are known with an appropriate accuracy .",
    "as we will show , in absence of such data it is also possible to obtain some results , but , may be , not so certain as in the main scheme of the method .",
    "next section is devoted to practical applications of the method proposed here .",
    "here , using the method described in the previous section , we prove the existence of neutron semimagic numbers @xmath3238 , 56 , 64 , and proton semimagic numbers @xmath33 40 , 58 , 64 .",
    "we also consider possibilities of existence of some other semimagic numbers .",
    "the case of @xmath35 seems to be the best illustration of our method application @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the neutron inelastic cross sections for neighboring isotopes @xmath36ge and @xmath37ge differ by factor 1.7 .",
    "so , following our scheme we have to assume that the @xmath24-values for these isotopes are equal 0 and 40 respectively .",
    "but it means that in @xmath36ge the neutron state @xmath38 is shifted up , so that a considerable energy gap appears between it and low - lying state @xmath39 ; this gap disappears by adding a pair of neutrons , _ i.e. _ in @xmath37ge . in other words , @xmath40=38 is a semimagic number .",
    "calculation of diffuseness parameter @xmath18 for @xmath36ge confirms this conclusion ( the value @xmath41 presented in @xcite does not take into account `` the correction '' of @xmath13 and @xmath14 ; taking into account this effect gives @xmath42 ) .    as to @xmath43",
    "it seems that in distinction from @xmath44 the proton state @xmath38 is not shifted up , and the energy gap appears between this state and the state @xmath45 ( which is higher than @xmath38 ) . by adding a new pair of proton this gap disappears as a result of the interaction between valence protons and neutrons in states @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "thus , for protons we obtain @xmath47=40 .",
    "the standard ( for our method ) analysis of the low - energy neutron interaction with isotopes of sr , zr and mo confirms this conclusion .",
    "note , that the conclusion about @xmath40 and @xmath47 follows immediately from the investigation by p.federman and s.pittel @xcite .",
    "later on many authors presented arguments in favor of _ a possibility of existence _ of semimagic numbers @xmath44 and @xmath43 ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .",
    "but in distinction from those arguments our method gives evidence for _ the existence _ of these semimagic numbers .",
    "to some extent the situation with semimagic numbers 56 and 58 is similar to the case of numbers 38 and 40 .",
    "the standard analysis of the experimental data on the interaction of low - energy neutrons with even - even isotopes of sr , zr and mo @xcite leads to the conclusion that for the isotopes with 56 neutrons the energy level of the neutron state @xmath48 is shifted down and the level of @xmath49-state is shifted up , so that a gap appears between these states and disappears by adding two more neutrons .",
    "in other words , @xmath50 is a semimagic number .",
    "one of the first conclusion about a possibility of the existence of @xmath51 was made by v.a.morozov @xcite , who showed that at @xmath50 the coefficient of mixture of @xmath52 and @xmath53 in electromagnetic transitions @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 changes the sign .",
    "and since such a change normally is treated as the presence of a filled subshell , he assumed that the existence of a semimagic number @xmath50 is quite possible . our result",
    "( being more definite ) confirmed this assumption .    in this connection",
    "we should mention recent works by moscow university group @xcite in which it was in particularly shown that the energy gap between neutron subshells in @xmath54zr may achieve @xmath55mev . as a result the authors assumed _",
    "a possibility of existence _ of the semimagic neutron number @xmath56 . this calculation may be regarded as an additional confirmation for our result .    as to a semimagic number of protons @xmath47=58 or 56 some authors ( see _",
    "e.g. _ [ 1 ] ) assumed that such a number may exist .",
    "this assumption was confirmed in the framework of our approach . trying to describe neutron data for nd we discovered that neutron inelastic cross sections for some isotopes do not enter the @xmath24-systematics .",
    "for instance , from the point of view of this systematics the @xmath24-value for the isotope @xmath57nd must be not equal to 40 ( if its proton shell would start at @xmath58=51 ) , but 8 or 4 , and these values correspond to @xmath47=58 or 56 ( see fig.2 ) .",
    "nd requires the @xmath24-product to be equal not to 40 , but to 4 or 8 which correspond to existence of semimagic numbers @xmath58=58 or 56,width=302 ]    considering isotopes of ce ( @xmath58=58 ) and ba ( @xmath58=56 ) shows that inelastic cross sections at the energy 300kev above the threshold are somewhat lower for isotopes of ce than for isotopes of ba .",
    "for instance , for @xmath59ce this cross section is equal to 0.60b but for @xmath60ba  0.66b .",
    "diffuseness parameter @xmath18 calculated by use of ccom for isotopes of ce is equal to 0.57  0.60fm , but for isotopes of ba  somewhat bigger ( 0.60  0.65fm ) .",
    "thus , our results confirm the assumption about existence of the semimagic number @xmath47=58(56 ) . at the same time",
    "they show that @xmath47=58 is more preferable than @xmath47=56 .      in distinction from the semimagic numbers considered above",
    ", the assumption about existence of the semimagic number 64 leads to the conclusion that some nuclei ( namely @xmath61sn and @xmath57gd ) must be double magic .    in 1953",
    "j.o.rasmussen with colaborators @xcite payed attention to anomalies in energies of @xmath62-decay of nuclei with @xmath58=64 at @xmath63 82 and thus assumed that @xmath58 = 64 is a semimagic number .",
    "later on it was assumed @xcite that the subshell @xmath58=64 exists in the region of rearearth nuclei and disappears in consequence of the @xmath64-interaction between @xmath65- and @xmath66-states .",
    "many authors ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) , considering the question about @xmath47 , brought different arguments in favor of existence of such a semimagical number .",
    "in particular , the description of the neutron inelastic scattering for the isotopes of sm in the framework of ccom is possible only under assumption of the disappearance of the shell ( @xmath49 and @xmath48 ) gap at @xmath67 and @xmath68 @xcite .",
    "at the same time the value of diffuseness parameter @xmath18 at the optimal description of the neutron cross sections for @xmath57gd is equal to 0.50fm , while for neighboring nuclei @xmath18=0.55  0.60fm .",
    "such values of @xmath18 give an evidence that @xmath57gd is a double magic nucleus , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath58=64 is a semimagic number .",
    "the situation with @xmath40=64 is similar to that with @xmath69=64 .",
    "many authors @xcite concluded that the existence of this semimagic number is quite possible .",
    "the analysis of neutron inelastic scattering on the isotopes of cd in the framework of the @xmath24-systematics confirmed that conclusion ( just like such an analysis for sm confirmed the existence of @xmath47=64 ) .",
    "the value of the diffusion parameter for @xmath61sn ( @xmath18=0.50fm ) gives an argument in favor of the conclusion that @xmath61sn is a double magic nucleus ( just like @xmath57gd ) .",
    "thus , we may conclude that the existence of semimagic numbers @xmath70 is firmly proved .",
    "besides the semimagic numbers of nucleons considered above there are some `` candidates '' for joining the `` semimagic community '' .",
    "unfortunately , the method described here can not give so far any certain answer about their existence because in most cases the accuracy of necessary experimental data is insufficient .",
    "nevertheless , the use of it can lead to some conclusions ( at least , on the level of assumption ) .    as the first example of such a `` candidate ''",
    "we consider @xmath69=76 @xcite .",
    "values of the neutron inelastic cross section for isotopes of os ( @xmath71 ) are essentially bigger than 0,5b and the diffuseness parameter values ( corresponding to the best description of low - energy neutron data ) are equal to 0.65 . all that testifies against the existence of this semimagic number .",
    "it seems to be interesting to investigate the region of heavy ( @xmath72 ) nuclei in connection with existence of semimagic nucleon numbers .",
    "but since for such nuclei the inelastic cross sections of low - energy neutron scattering are not known , it is impossible to use the main scheme of our method .",
    "however , one can try to draw some plausible assumptions ( or at least some hints ) from available data on inelastic neutron scattering on @xmath73th . as a matter of fact there exist two sets of the experimental data on neutron inelastic scattering for this nucleus .",
    "these cross section values corresponding to @xmath6 level excitation for the neutron energy 300kev over the threshold ( after averaging over the energy range of 100kev ) are equal to 1.13@xmath740.21b and 1.22@xmath740.22b @xcite .",
    "both of these values ( corresponding to @xmath75 ) are essentially less than the value required by the @xmath76systematics .",
    "if we ( ignoring the experimental errors ) assume that the true value of the cross section considered here is situated between 1.13 and 1.22b , we obtain that the @xmath77-product must be equal to 48 ( instead of 128 ) .",
    "such a change may be correct only if some new semimagic numbers exist .",
    "we will try to find them .",
    "generally speaking , the value of the @xmath24-product equal to 48 may leads to 6 possible pairs of valence nucleon numbers @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "but it is necessary that between the new and the old values of these number the following relations were fulfilled : @xmath80 the breach of one of these requirements would lead to drastic changes in the nucleon level schemes , in particular , to the removal of classical magic numbers .",
    "( in principle , such a reconstruction of the nucleon scheme is possible .",
    "but there is no reason for it so far . )",
    ". therefore only three pairs @xmath81 ( where @xmath82 ) , namely , ( 8,6 ) , ( 6,8 ) , ( 4,12 ) have to be taken into consideration . for each pair",
    "it is easy to get the nucleon numbers @xmath83 and @xmath84 from which one has to count the values of relevant valence nucleon numbers : @xmath85    eqs.([d ] ) contain 12 numbers @xmath83 and @xmath86 .",
    "using these numbers one can form 12 pairs ( @xmath83 , @xmath84 ) , and if both numbers of a pair are semimagic ones a necessary value of the @xmath24-product ( in our case it is 48 ) will be guaranteed .",
    "it remains to prove that at least there is one such a pair among the pairs considered here . in this connection",
    "note that one of the @xmath87-values is equal to 82 which is a classical magic number , so that in this case it is only necessary to prove that one of 136 or 148 is a neutron semimagic number .",
    "unfortunately , it seems impossible to find a `` semimagic pair '' among those 12 ones for lack of necessary experimental data .",
    "nevertheless , we shall try to draw some conclusions from available data ( at least on the level of assumptions ) .",
    "let us consider 12 nuclei consist of @xmath83 protons and @xmath86 neutrons ( @xmath83 and @xmath86 belong to the same pair ) .",
    "10 of these nuclei are not interesting for us because some of them are exotic ones ( like @xmath88pb ) and for others nothing is known about their interaction with low - energy neutrons .",
    "remaining two nuclei , namely @xmath89cf@xmath90 and @xmath91cm@xmath92 could be interesting from the point of view of our method .",
    "but we do not know anything about interaction of the isotopes of cf with low - energy neutrons .",
    "so , only @xmath93 cm remains to be considered . for this and some other isotopes of cm",
    "the neutron strength functions are known experimentally .",
    "the strength function @xmath94 of @xmath21-neutrons for @xmath93 cm is equal to 0.45@xmath950.15 while for neighboring isotopes @xmath96 cm and @xmath97 cm @xmath94=1.00@xmath980.20 and 1.10@xmath740.12 @xcite .",
    "such a big difference between the @xmath94-values for @xmath93 cm and its neighboring even - even isotopes may be considered as an argument in favor of the assumption that @xmath99=150 is a semimagic number .",
    "the difference between the @xmath94-values for @xmath93 cm and @xmath96pu is of the same order of magnitude , but we can not say anything about the other `` neighbor on the @xmath58-line '' , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath97cf because its interaction with low - energy neutrons is not known .",
    "so , we can only say that such a situation may be considered not as an argument , but only as a `` hint in favor '' of the assumption that @xmath58=96 is also a semimagic number .",
    "generally speaking , almost all the @xmath94-values in the ( pu  cm)-region are equal to @xmath1001 @xcite .",
    "the only exception is @xmath93 cm ( @xmath101 ) .",
    "such a situation provokes us to assume that @xmath93 cm is a double magic ( or double semimagic ) nucleus .",
    "in other words , both @xmath102 and @xmath103 are semimagic numbers .",
    "emphasize , that this is only a statement about the possibility of existence of two new semimagic numbers and needs more rigorous proof .",
    "unfortunately , the diffusion parameter value taken from our calculation of @xmath94 can not help because such calculations are less sensitive to the diffusion parameter value than calculations of cross sections .",
    "the efficiency of the method for finding new semimagic numbers of nucleon , based on the analysis of low - energy neutron data , was demonstrated here by different examples of its application . using this method we obtained some already known results about existence of some semimagic numbers , confirmed assumptions about other semimags , for the first time proved the existence of the semimagic number @xmath47=58 . using scarce experimental data we first pointed on the possibility of existence of semimagic @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "thus , this method seems to be rather efficient .",
    "it is necessary to emphasize that the most important part of the method described here is the @xmath24-systematics , _ i.e. _ , smooth dependence of neutron inelastic cross section on the @xmath24-product .",
    "this dependence itself is out of any doubt : there is no one serious contradiction with it .",
    "therefore this method becomes less efficient in cases when one can not address the @xmath24-systematics , _ i.e. _ when neutron inelastic cross sections are not known or their accuracy is poor .    also we mention another essential element of our method having auxiliary character , namely the diffusion parameter value obtained from the requirement of optimal description of neutron data in framework of the coupled channel optical model .",
    "but this auxiliary element is efficient only if corresponding calculations are sensitive to this value . for instance",
    ", it works well for the cross section calculations , but does not work for calculations of strength functions ( as it was mentioned above ) . nevertheless , even in such cases our method permits to obtain some results .",
