    "the advantages of moving the population i calibration of the classical cepheid period - luminosity relation ( the leavitt law ) from the optical to the infrared were outlined some three decades ago by mcgonegal et al .",
    "( 1983 ) , and they have been borne out repeatedly over the years , as reviewed and elaborated upon by freedman & madore ( 2010 ) . but only now is it possible to extend these same advantages to the parallel path offered by the population ii variable stars ( the short - period rr  lyrae variables and their longer - period siblings the w  virginis stars ) .",
    "two impressive accomplishments have made this possible : ( 1 ) the completion of the wise mission ( wright et al .",
    "2010 ) and the release of its sky survey of point sources measured in the mid - infrared in four bands ranging from 3.4 to 22  @xmath0 m , and then ( 2 ) the innovative application of the _ hst _ fine - guidance sensor ( _ fgs _ )  cameras to the determination of trigonometric parallaxes to four field rr lyrae variables by benedict et al .",
    "( 2011 ) .    the many ,",
    "now well - known , advantages of calibrating and using period - luminosity relations in the mid - ir include the following : ( 1 ) the effects of line - of - sight extinction are reduced with respect to optical observations by at least an order of magnitude for even the shortest wavelength ( [ w1 ] at 3.4  @xmath0 m ) observations , ( 2 ) concerns about the systematic impact of the possible non - universality of the reddening law are similarly reduced by going away from the optical and into the mid - ir , ( 3 ) the total amplitude of the light variation of the target star during its pulsation cycle is greatly reduced because of the largely diminished contribution of temperature variation to the change in surface brightness , in comparison to the much smaller ( but essentially irreducible ) wavelength - independent radius / areal variations , ( 4 ) the corresponding collapse in the width ( i.e. , intrinsic scatter ) of the period - luminosity relations , again because of the reduced sensitivity of infrared luminosities to temperature variations ( across the instability strip ) , combined with the intrinsic narrowness of the residual period - radius relations . and",
    "finally , ( 5 ) at mid - infrared wavelengths , for the temperatures and surface gravities encountered in population i & ii cepheids and rr lyrae stars , there are so few metallic line or molecular transitions in those parts of the spectrum that atmospheric metallicity effects are expected to have minimal impact on the calibration.m has been noted for long - period cepheids , where a co molecular bandhead appears at temperatures below 4000k ; see marengo et al .",
    "2010 , scowcroft et al .",
    "2011 , and monson et al . 2012",
    "; however , the temperatures of the rr lyrae variables , are so high in comparison to the long - period ( classical ) cepheids , where this effect was discovered , that we expect no contribution of co to the light or color curves of the rr lyrae variables studied here .",
    "the w virginis stars may be affected , and still need to be examined .",
    "] this is especially true for the rr  lyrae stars which are significantly hotter than their longer - period ( cooler ) cepheid counterparts .    as described in freedman et al .",
    "( 2012 ) , the _ carnegie hubble program _ ( chp ) is designed to minimize and/or eliminate the remaining known systematics in the measurement of the hubble constant using mid - infrared data from nasa s _ spitzer space telescope_. here we broaden the base in two distinct ways : ( a ) the incorporation of wise mid - infrared data and ( b ) the preliminary calibration of the population ii rr  lyrae variables as mid - infrared distance indicators .",
    "this new initiative is known as the _ carnegie rr  lyrae program _ ( crrp ) .",
    "wise conducted an all - sky survey at four mid - infrared wavelengths , 3.4 , 4.6 , 12 and 22  @xmath0 m ( w1 , w2 , w3 and w4 , hereafter ) . as such all of the rr  lyrae variables having trigonometric parallaxes ( benedict et al .",
    "2011 ) were also observed by the satellite . by design ,",
    "the slowly precessing orbit of wise , allowed the satellite to scan across every object on the sky at least 12 times ( with progressively more coverage at higher ecliptic latitudes ) .",
    "these successive observations were obtained within a relatively narrow window of time ( over about 18 hours for those fields nearest the ecliptic equator ) with each observation being separated by about 90 minutes ( the orbital period of the satellite ) . fortuitously rr  lyrae stars have periods that are generally less than 16 hours , meaning that even the sparsest of these multiple mid - infrared observations covered at least one full pulsational cycle of these particular variable stars .",
    "the light curves based on the time - resolved wise observations of our calibrating stars are shown in figures 1 & 2 for the four rr  lyrae variables , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , & @xmath7 .",
    "these stars were observed by wise 51 , 23 , 24 and 23 times , respectively .",
    "data were retrieved from the wise all - sky single exposure ( l1b ) source table , which is available at the infrared science archive ( http://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/missions/wise.html ) .",
    "the source positions were queried with a 2.5 arcsec cone search radius , ignoring observations flagged as contaminated by artifacts .",
    "the observations are very uniformly distributed around the cycle and the resulting light curves are exceedingly well defined .",
    "all three of the shortest - wavelength light curves show convergence in their properties , exemplified by their mutual phases , shapes and amplitudes . as expected these light curves closely track the anticipated light variations due to surface - area variations of the star , where at these wavelengths the sensitivity of the surface brightness to a temperature variation is much diminished as compared to its sensitivity at optical wavelengths .",
    "this then fully accounts for the mutual phasing ( tracking the radius variations , and not the off - set temperature variations ) , the shape ( the cycloid - like radius variation , in contrast to the highly asymmetric color / temperature variation ) and the low amplitude ( around 0.3  mag , peak - to - peak , in line with the small , radius - induced cyclical change in surface area of these stars ) .",
    "the non - parametric fitting methodology , gloess was used to derive intensity - averaged magnitudes and amplitudes , as given in table  1 ( see persson et al .",
    "2004 for a description and an early application of this fitting technique ) .",
    "table 1 contains the parameters needed to compute absolute mean magnitudes .",
    "the parallaxes , e(b - v ) reddenings , and lutz - kelker - hanson ( lkh ; lutz and kelker 1973 ; hanson 1979 ) corrections as taken from benedict et al 2011 , are listed for convenience .",
    "we have converted the a@xmath8 extinctions listed by benedict et al .",
    "( 2011 ) to those in the w1 and w2 bands using the yuan et al .",
    "( 2011 ) compilation of a@xmath9/e(b - v ) results with a@xmath8/e(b - v ) = 3.1 .",

    "( 2005 ) agree well . neither the yuan et al .",
    "( 2011 ) nor indebetouw et al .",
    "( 2005 ) results extend to the w3 band , and here we have referred to fitzpatrick ( 1999 ) for an approximate value .",
    "the extinctions for the four stars are so small as to make no difference to the absolute magnitude values and we take @xmath13/a@xmath8 to be 0.01 . the adopted mid - ir extinctions a@xmath9/a@xmath8 we adopt are 0.065 , 0.052 , and 0.01 for w1 , w2 , and w3 , respectively .",
    "the adopted mid - ir extinctions a@xmath9/e(b - v ) are also given in table 1 .",
    "the above parameters and our observed mean magnitudes lead to the w1 , w2 , and w3 absolute magnitudes in table 1 . and",
    "the period - luminosity relations for rr  lyrae variables follow :    @xmath1 } = -2.44 ~(\\pm 0.95 ) \\times log(p ) -1.26 ~(\\pm0.25)~~ \\sigma = 0.10\\ ] ] @xmath2 } = -2.55 ~(\\pm 0.89 ) \\times log(p ) -1.29 ~(\\pm0.23)~~ \\sigma = 0.10\\ ] ] @xmath3 } = -2.58 ~(\\pm 0.97 ) \\times",
    "log(p ) -1.32 ~(\\pm0.25)~~ \\sigma = 0.10\\ ] ]    the absolute magnitude values and the respective fits to the first two wise bands and as well as k - band data ( from benedict et al . 2011 and dallora et al .",
    "2004 , respectively ) are shown in figure 3 . despite the very small ( less than a factor of two ) range in period covered by rr  lyrae stars ,",
    "the pl relations are well defined , largely because of their intrinsically small scatter .",
    "the intrinsic scatter is especially well illustrated by the k - band pl relation , where we also show the rr  lyrae data of dallora et al .",
    "for 21 fundamental - mode rr  lyrae stars in the well - populated lmc globular cluster , reticulum ( shifted by 18.47  mag ) .",
    "a comparison of these two datasets is very illuminating .",
    "the slope of the adopted pl relation at k and the total width of it , as defined by the two samples , are for all intents and purposes , identical .",
    "the very good agreement in these two independently - determined slopes and the small dispersion in each of the datasets suggest that the means of the milky way variables are already well constrained even though the galactic calibrating sample itself is currently very small .",
    "on the other hand , we note that the small ( observed ) scatter of the milky way rr  lyrae variables around each of the adopted pl relations is apparently at variance with the individually quoted error bars for each of the calibrating variables .",
    "that is , the formal scatter of @xmath14  mag in the wise pl relations is to be compared with the quoted parallax errors on the individual distance moduli of @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18  mag for xz  cyg , uv  oct , su  dra and rr  lyr , respectively .",
    "the average scatter for the variables ( @xmath19  mag ) is then about two time larger that their observed scatter around the pl fit .",
    "this suggests that the published errors may be somewhat overestimated .",
    "there are independent data that support this assertion .",
    "the 10 galactic cepheids for which benedict et al .",
    "( 2010 ) obtained parallaxes , using the same instrument , telescope and reduction methodology have individually quoted internal errors in their true distance moduli ranging from @xmath20 to @xmath21  mag .",
    "their average uncertainty is @xmath22  mag , and yet , once again , as with the rr  lyrae variables the pl fit to these data yields a formal dispersion of only @xmath14  mag . in both cases the observed dispersions , for the galactic samples , are in total agreement with independently determined dispersions for the much more robustly determined dispersions for the lmc samples .",
    "we suggest therefore that the random errors reported for the _ hst _ parallaxes for both the cepheids and for the rr  lyrae variables may have been over - estimated .",
    "this is not simply of academic interest .",
    "if the observed scatter is used to calculate the systematic uncertainty in the calibration of the rr  lyrae pl relation that uncertainty would be @xmath23  mag , a 2 - 3% error in the population  ii distance scale .",
    "however , if the quoted errors on the individual distance moduli are used , then the uncertainty rises to @xmath24  mag , a 5% error .",
    "similar conclusions would also apply to the base uncertainty in the cepheid distance scale using the benedict sample ; is the uncertainty in the galactic cepheid zero point 1.6% in distance , or is it 3.0% ?",
    "it is therefore important to note that in their first paper discussing the use of _ fgs _ on _ hst _ , benedict et al .",
    "( 2002 ) state that the `` standard deviations of the _ hst _ and _ hipparcos _ data points may have been overstated by a factor of @xmath251.5 . '' and since the _ hipparcos _ errors had been subjected to many confirming tests `` ... that it is likely that the _ hst _ errors are overstated . ''",
    "parallaxes from gaia are anxiously awaited ; they will improve the number of calibrators by orders of magnitude and convincingly set the zero point .    in figure 3",
    "we show , using thick vertical lines , the full magnitude of the lkh corrections as published by benedict et al ( 2011 ) and applied to the true distance moduli used here .",
    "it is noteworthy that , if these corrections had not been applied , the dispersion in the data points around the fit would have exceeded the independently determined dispersion from the reticulum data , and the slope of the milky way solution would have been more shallow than the lmc slope .",
    "we take the final agreement of both the slopes and the dispersions to suggest that the individually determined and independently - applied lkh corrections are appropriate .",
    "finally , it needs to be noted that klein et al .",
    "( 2011 ) have published slopes that are much shallower than the ones derived here ( e.g. , -1.7 compared to our -2.6 ) .",
    "this is because in their bayesian analysis they chose to leave the overtone pulsators in the global solution , without correcting them to their equivalent fundamental periods .",
    "we have recomputed the slopes from their data after applying the appropriate period shift to the overtones , and those pl slopes are plotted in figure 4 .",
    "their slopes and ours now agree well within the errors , but they are still systematically somewhat shallower than our solutions .",
    "for cepheids it is well known that the slope of the pl relation is a monotonically increasing function of wavelength . in figure 4",
    "we show that the same overall trend is now made explicit for the first time for the rr  lyrae variables as well , and for the same physical reasons .",
    "as one moves from shorter to longer wavelengths one is moving from pl relations where the slope is dominated by the trend of decreasing temperature ( i.e. , decreasing surface brightness ) with period , to relations that are dominated by the opposing run of increasing mean radius with period .",
    "the plotted slopes of the optical and near - infrared pl relations are representative of a variety of published studies ( e.g , catelan , pritzl & smith 2004 , benedict et al .",
    "2011 , dallora et al . 2004 ) while the mid - ir slopes are from this study . as the relative contribution from the temperature - sensitive surface brightness drops off with wavelength ,",
    "the observed slope is expected to asymptotically approach the wavelength - independent ( geometric ) slope of the period - area relation . that behavior is indeed seen in figure 4 .",
    "moreover the level at which the plateau is occurring would suggest that the period - radius relation of burki & meylan ( 1986 ) ( giving a slope of -2.60 , based on baade - wesselink studies ) is marginally preferred over the period - radius ( slope = -3.25 ) and period - radius - metallicity ( slope = -2.90 ) solutions given by marconi et al .",
    "( 2005 ) scuti , rr  lyrae and type  ii ( w virginis ) stars '' , and that `` there is is no solid reason why the quoted pulsators should obey the same pr relation . '' at the same time , he / she notes that `` the period - radius relation provided by marconi et al .",
    "( 2005 ) is based on a set of rr  lyrae models that cover more than two dex in metal abundance ... and they also account for , at fixed metal abundance , possible evolutionary effects . '' ]    from a practical point of view it is not immediately clear what advantage the increased slope of the long - wavelength pl relations would have to offer applications to the distance scale , until it is realized that increased slope in the pl relation is causally and physically connected to decreased width ( i.e. , decreased intrinsic scatter and therefore increased precision ) in the pl relation as proven in the general case by madore & freedman ( 2012 ) .",
    "this effect can be seen for the rr  lyrae variables in figure 2 of catelan , pritzl & smith ( 2004 ) , and it is apparent here in figure 3 where the scatter has already reached a minimum in the k - band where simultaneously the plateau in slope ( seen in figure 4 ) is very nearly complete .",
    "in figure 5 we plot the measured magnitude residuals from the [ w1 ] 3.4  @xmath0 m pl relation versus the published metallicities of the four rr  lyrae stars in our sample , as given in table 1 of benedict et al . ( 2011 ) .",
    "the rr  lyrae stars only sample a 0.4  dex range in [ fe / h ] so the test is not a strong one , but there is clearly no significant dependence of the already small magnitude residuals on metallicity .",
    "as can be dramatically seen in the study of catelan , pritzl & smith ( 2008 , especially their figure 2 ) operating anywhere in the near to mid - infrared , from h = 1.6  @xmath0 m ( accessible to _ hst _ ) to 3.6  @xmath0 m",
    "( accessible to spitzer now , and with jwst in the near future ) will each accrue the benefits of low scatter and ever decreasing sensitivity ( with wavelength ) to line - of - sight extinction .",
    "collecting power , availability and spatial resolution will determine which of these instruments will be used at any given time . but suffice it to say that the population  ii rr  lyrae variables are proving themselves to be a powerful means of establishing an independent , highly precise and accurate distance scale that is completely decoupled in its systematics from the population  i cepheid path to the extragalactic distance scale and the hubble constant .",
    "this work is based in part on observations made with the _ wide - field infrared survey explorer _ ( wise ) , which was is operated by the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology under a contract with nasa .",
    "support for this work was provided by nasa through an award issued by jpl / caltech .",
    "this research also made use of the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) and the nasa/ ipac infrared science archive ( irsa ) , both of which are operated by the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology , under contract with the national aeronautics and space administration .",
