    "31 and 32 represent the portaits phase of this system respectively exactly the superharmonic and subharmonic resonances .",
    "the analysis of figures 26 shows that for given values of the parameters of the system except for the excitation frequency , the amplitude of the exciting force and the natural frequency of the system which have been selected from the slightly near resonance box , chaotic behavior is not the same .",
    "the system is less chaotic in the superharmonic case ( see fig . 30 ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) ) than in the subharmonic case ( see fig . 30 ( d ) ) .",
    "these figures also show the influence of the exciting force on the intensity of the chaotic behavior of the system .",
    "figures ( a ) and ( b ) for the plotted values of frequencies and amplitudes of the exciting force at the resonance taken strictly superharmonic order - two and order - three , respectively show that the system is quasi - periodic but chaotic in the case of figures ( a ) and ( b ) obtained under the conditions corresponding to the subharmonic resonance of order - two and order - three respectively .",
    "we note that the quasi - periodicity is less enhanced in the case of order - two in the case of order - three for superharmonic resonance and the system is less chaotic in the case of order - two in the case of order - three for the subharmonic resonance .",

    "33 ( ( a ) and ( b ) ) confirm that the system is quasi - periodic and is less enhanced in the case of order - two in the case of order - three for this resonance . indeed by looking at their corresponding time series , one can observe a quasi - periodic and chaotic states as shown in fig .",
    "34 - 35 . finally , the system is less chaotic in the case of the superharmonic resonance in the case subharmonic resonance and in subharmonic and superharmonic case but not too close to the resonance region the system is the very chaotic in thes two cases .",
    "we notice that the chaotic behavior and the intensity of the chaotic behavior of forced modified rayleigh - duffing oscillator depends of the differents parameters of the system which influence the differents resonances region .",

    "in this paper , superharmonic , subharmonic and primary resonant sates have been studied . using the method of multiple scales",
    ", we obtained the primary resonance and the order - two and order - three for each type of other resonance .",
    "we found also in each case the maximum value of the amplitude of the oscillations for the system .",
    "we noted that in the case of two - order superharmonic or subharmonic resonance , this maximum value depends on all the parameters of the system but in the case of order three , only the coefficients of the terms cubic parameters affect the maximum amplitude of the resonance .",
    "it should be noted that from the simulation of different equations of the resonance curve , the amplitude of the response is higher in the case of all subharmonic resonance in the superharmonic . by fixing all the parameters of the system and varying only the amplitude of the parametric excitation above the critical value",
    ", the increasing amplitude of the parametric excitation provokes a rapid changes in the amplitude of the response to the resonances .",
    "we obtained the jump and hysteresis phenomenon in the system behaviors .",
    "the chaotic behavior have study at superharmonic and subharmonic resonances and also subharmonic and superharmonic case but not too close to the resonances regions .",
    "we found the differents regions where the systems which modelled by the forced modified rayleigh - duffing oscillator ( el ni@xmath4o southern oscillation ( enso ) coupled tropical ocean - atmosphere weather phenomenon , mems device consisting of a @xmath5 diameter silicon disk which can be made to vibrate by heating it with a laser beam resulting in a hopf bifurcation , the modified selkov equations , modified abstract trimolecular chemical reaction etc . ) are quasi - periodic and chaotic .",
