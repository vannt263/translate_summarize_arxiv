    "information theory has been successfully extended to the quantum domain , where information processing is implemented with systems ruled by the laws of quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "most theoretical work focuses on distinguishable particles , namely particles that can be unambiguously identified at any moment .",
    "however , quantum mechanics predicts that identical particles can not be in general distinguished @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", many experiments and proposals actually employ identical particles @xcite , implementing protocols derived for distinguishable particles .",
    "the usual method is to fix some degrees of freedom , e.g. position values , to unambiguously label and characterize each particle @xcite .",
    "these degrees of freedom can not be further manipulated , whereas additional degrees of freedom must carry the relevant information to be processed .",
    "nevertheless , if one aims to build an integrated architecture , it can be required to exploit all the manipulable degrees of freedom , in order to encode the desired processing , with no way to label and distinguish particles .",
    "for instance , if identical particles are distinguished and labelled by means of spatial localization , only the other degrees of freedom , such as spin , polarization or hyperfine levels , are accessible within the framework of distinguishable particles .",
    "it is however hard to localize particles in small systems , an the exploitation of all the degrees of freedom , including the spatial one , is convenient to increase the computing power of a device without increasing its size . for these reasons ,",
    "we start a careful analysis of quantum information protocols , focusing on the generalization of quantum teleportation @xcite , based on identical particles",
    ".    key resources for teleportation and other quantum protocols are entangled states .",
    "the latter are quantum states that exhibit correlations between subsystems , which can not be explained by a classical probability theory .",
    "since identical particles can not be individually addressed in general , it is not meaningful to define correlations between particles .",
    "instead , we apply the approach developed in @xcite , where entanglement is defined via non - classical correlations between commuting subalgebras of observables , i.e. partitions of all the observables in groups that are physically addressable without mutual disturbance .",
    "thus , correlations are defined by means of the possibility to write expectation values of physically accessible observables in terms of a classical probability distribution .",
    "this is a very general and powerful approach that recovers the standard definition of entanglement for distinguishable particles , and suitably generalizes the concept of entanglement to identical particles .",
    "we shall focus on massive particles at non - relativistic energies , like atoms and constituents of condensed matter systems , which satisfy the conservation of the total number of particles , mathematically described by a superselection rule @xcite .",
    "based on this property , entanglement of identical particles was proven to exhibit markedly different features from those of photons and distinguishable particles , such as much simpler detectability @xcite , a higher robustness against noise @xcite , and the geometry of entangled states drawn in the whole space of quantum states @xcite .",
    "the properties of entanglement have been studied in fermionic superconducting systems @xcite , electrons in low - dimensional semiconductors @xcite , and bosonic ultracold gases @xcite , and exploited in several applications , such as quantum data hiding @xcite , teleportation @xcite , bell s inequalities @xcite , dense coding @xcite , and quantum metrology @xcite . since quantum teleportation is a primitive for scalable quantum computers @xcite , and plays a fundamental role in measurement - based quantum computation @xcite , we will focus on this special topic hereafter .    in the original teleportation protocol",
    "@xcite one agent , alice , wants to teleport an arbitrary , perhaps unknown , state to another agent , bob .",
    "alice owns the state to be teleported and a share of a resource state , and bob owns the remaining part of the resource state .",
    "the algorithm of the standard teleportation is the following : _",
    "i ) _ alice performs a projective measurement onto the basis of maximally entangled states of her states ; _ ii ) _ alice sends bob the result of the measurement ; _ iii ) _ bob performs a suitable operation on his state , conditioned on the message he got from alice . in the setting of distinguishable particles , if the shared state is a pure , maximally entangled state , bob ends up with a state identical to the initial state to be teleported , while the initial state has been transformed by the measurement .",
    "the teleportation can also be applied to a part of an entangled state . in this case",
    ", alice teleports the state of a system entangled with another one , and the initial entanglement is perfectly swapped with bob at the end of the protocol .",
    "this application is called entanglement swapping , and can be useful for sharing entanglement at long distances .    in @xcite",
    ", we developed a teleportation protocol implementable with identical massive particles .",
    "we discussed its performances with some physically interesting resource states : non - entangled states , maximally entangled states , @xmath0 ( or atomic ) coherent states , and ground states of the double well potential with two - body interactions .",
    "these two latter resource states are of particular interest , since they can be experimentally prepared with nowadays technology .",
    "we observed that our protocol can not perfectly teleport any general quantum state .",
    "furthermore , we proved that this is a general feature for any teleportation protocol with identical massive particles which is implemented by local operations and classical communication between the agents .",
    "nevertheless , perfect teleportation can be achieved when the number of particles in the resource state increases to infinity . in the present paper ,",
    "we study the convergence of teleportation performances in this limit .",
    "we also apply our analysis to physically relevant resource states and to the robustness of teleportation performances in the presence of noise .",
    "we will present the basic definition of entanglement in section [ entanglement ] and the aforementioned teleportation protocol in section [ protocol ] . in section [ perf ] , we shall show that the efficiency grows with the number of particles in the resource state . from a detailed analysis of the resource state",
    ", we shall give simple sufficient conditions for the resource state to provide perfect teleportation when the number of particles goes to infinity .",
    "these conditions recover and generalize the resource states studied in @xcite . in section",
    "[ robustness ] , we shall discuss the robustness of the teleportation performances , when the resource state is affected by noise .",
    "we shall sum up our conclusions in section [ discussions ] .",
    "before discussing the teleportation protocol , we introduce the algebraic formalism on which the notion of entanglement is based .",
    "this formalism generalizes that of distinguishable particles and can be applied unambiguously to identical particles @xcite .",
    "physical observables are self - adjoint elements of a @xmath1-algebra , that can be represented as the algebra @xmath2 of bounded operators on a hilbert space @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "a state of the system is a positive functional on @xmath4 , namely a linear map @xmath5 with @xmath6 and with the normalization @xmath7 .",
    "we now identify two subsystems by means of two commuting subalgebras of operators .    an _ algebraic bipartition _ of @xmath2 is any pair @xmath8 of commuting subalgebras , @xmath9 .",
    "any element of @xmath10 commutes with any element of @xmath11 , @xmath12=0 $ ] .",
    "the notion of locality lies in the commutativity of the subalgebras , ensuring that the results of a joined measurement of an observable in @xmath10 and of an observables in @xmath11 do not depend on the ordering .",
    "therefore , subsystems are defined via observables that are individually and unambiguously addressable .",
    "an operator is said to be _ local _ with respect to the bipartition @xmath8 , if it is the product @xmath13 of an operator @xmath14 of @xmath10 and another @xmath15 in @xmath11 .",
    "we are now ready to define quantum correlated states with respect to a given algebraic bipartition .",
    "a state @xmath16 is said to be _",
    "separable _ with respect to the bipartition @xmath8 if the expectation of any local operator @xmath13 can be decomposed into a linear convex combination of products of local expectations :    @xmath17    with @xmath18 and @xmath19 being _ bona fide _ states of the system .",
    "otherwise , the state is _ entangled_.    we now specialize these definitions to @xmath20 bosons whose single particle hilbert space has finite dimension @xmath21 .",
    "any state @xmath16 can be represented by a positive operation @xmath22 @xcite , such that    @xmath23    _ pure states _",
    "@xmath24 are projectors , isomorphic to elements in @xmath3 , while states @xmath25 are called",
    "_ mixed_.",
    "subalgebras of single particle observables in the above definition covers the usual definition of entanglement of distinguishable particles @xcite . at this point indistinguishability",
    "comes into play : in systems of identical particles , there is no subalgebras of physical observables acting on an individual particle .",
    "thus , our approach provides the required generalisation .",
    "the formalism of second quantization is more convenient for identical particles .",
    "let us introduce creation and annihilation operators @xmath26 , @xmath27 , of @xmath21 modes , that satisfy the bosonic commutation relations , @xmath28=\\delta_{jl}$ ] .",
    "the many - body hilbert space @xmath29 of the system is spanned by the fock states ,    @xmath30 is called _ vacuum state _ , and the integer @xmath31 is the occupation number of the @xmath32-th mode , such that @xmath33 . fixing the number of particles",
    "constrains the hilbert space to @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the fock space , spanned by the unconstrained fock states ( [ fock.states ] ) , and @xmath36 is the projector on the eigenspace with @xmath20 particles .",
    "this is a constraint to the linearity of the hilbert space , formalized by a superselection rule @xcite , where superpositions of different total number of particles are forbidden .",
    "the physical motivation of the superselection rule stems from the impossibility to create massive particles at non - relativistic energies .",
    "we use the notation of tensor products , to express mode - partitions : e.g. @xmath37 .",
    "we have to keep in mind that this tensor product structure is constrained by the conservation of the number of particles .",
    "the norm - closure of the set of polynomials in all creation and annihilation operators , @xmath38 , @xmath39 is the algebra @xmath40 .. is generated by differentiation of the so - called weyl operators .",
    "any function of the creation and annihilation operators is obtained by a proper differentiation of the weyl operators @xcite .",
    "] we define the bipartition of this algebra by splitting the set of creation and annihilation operators into two disjoint sets @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "the norm - closure of all polynomials in the creation and annihilation operators of the first ( second ) set is the subalgebra @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "according to the previous definition , a pure state is @xmath43-separable if and only if    @xmath44    and mixed @xmath43-separable states are convex combinations of pure @xmath43-separable states .",
    "see @xcite for a detailed analysis .    beyond its definition , entanglement can be quantified by means of measures of information carried by the subsystems .",
    "minimal axioms fulfilled by these measures are @xcite : they are positive and vanish for all separable states , they are invariant under local unitary operations on the state , they do not increase under local operations and classical communication .",
    "the most easily computable measure of entanglement for mixed states is the so - called negativity @xcite , based on the partial transposition operation , denoted by @xmath45 @xcite ,    @xmath46    in general , negativity can be zero for some entangled states",
    ". nevertheless , the set of entangled states of identical massive bosons that are not detected by the negativity has measure zero , and is the null set in the special case of two - mode states where @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "previous proposals for implementing quantum teleportation @xcite and general qip @xcite with identical particles are based on states of identical particles that can be distinguished by the consumption of some degrees of freedom , as mentioned in the introduction . in the following , we analyse performances of a teleportation protocol that uses states of many - particles with a single two - mode degree of freedom .",
    "thus , it will not be possible to distinguish identical particles .",
    "in this section , we describe the teleportation protocol @xcite . in the standard protocol with distinguishable particles ,",
    "each agent owns one particle .",
    "when teleportation is implemented with identical particles , each agent owns addressable subsystems which are not particles but rather modes @xcite .",
    "we aim to teleport the state of one mode of a two - mode state @xmath48 , with the help of a two - mode shared resource state @xmath49 .",
    "the labels @xmath50 number the modes .",
    "the initial global state is @xmath51 , where    latexmath:[\\[\\label{initial.state }     and @xmath49 is a general state of @xmath53 two - mode particles    @xmath54    first , alice performs a complete projective measurement on the second and the third mode .",
    "this means that when alice measures the system , the latter is projected onto a state that depends on the measurement outcome @xmath55 .",
    "moreover , the sum of all the projectors is the identity matrix .",
    "the projectors are @xmath56 , where    @xmath57",
    "notice that each state ( [ states.meas ] ) has a fixed number of particles , in accordance with the conservation of the total particle number , but that different @xmath58 do not have all the same amount of entanglement .",
    "in particular , states ( [ states.meas ] ) with @xmath59 have the same amount of entanglement as the maximally entangled states of @xmath20 two - mode particles , in terms of the entanglement measures discussed in @xcite . states ( [ states.meas ] ) with other values of @xmath60 have less entanglement . notice also that it is not possible to write a complete projective measurement with states that preserve the total number of particles and have all the same entanglement @xcite .    if alice measures the outcome @xmath55 , the state changes into    @xmath61    where @xmath62 is the identity operator on the @xmath32-th mode .",

    "on the other hand , the evolved state ( [ sol.deph ] ) outperforms the fidelity of separable states if and only if @xmath272 .",
    "therefore , there are values of @xmath273 such that the initial state does better than the teleportation fidelity provided by separable states , but the evolved state at finite times does not .",
    "however , the resource states whose entries @xmath274 with @xmath275 are non - negative preserve their capability to outperform separable states at any finite time , when they are affected by dephasing .",
    "this class of states includes the states discussed in @xcite .",
    "indeed , the positivity of the entries @xmath276 with @xmath275 ensures that the additional contribution to the fidelity ( [ fidelity ] ) with respect to separable states is positive .",

    "these assumptions generalize the two- and @xmath286-particle losses @xmath287 discussed in @xcite .",
    "the solution of ( [ loss ] ) reads @xcite    @xmath288    where @xmath289 are matrices which operate on the subspace of @xmath290 particles .",
    "each operator @xmath291 is diagonal in the fock basis , thus the solution ( [ sol.loss ] ) has the explicit form    @xmath292    where we adopted the convention that @xmath293 if @xmath294 , and similarly for @xmath295 .",
    "we notice that the components @xmath296 of the noisy resource state do not contribute to the fidelity",
    ". indeed , the fidelity is the overlap between the state to be teleported and the average teleported state .",
    "the state which is teleported by means of the component @xmath296 has @xmath297 particles , and thus has vanishing overlap with the initial state which has @xmath20 particles . however , these components contribute to the average final entanglement , if @xmath298 .",
    "since only the component of the mixture ( [ sol.loss ] ) with @xmath53 particles contributes to the fidelity , the fidelity is damped by its weight @xmath299 .",
    "the fidelity of the evolved resource state is    @xmath300    where @xmath301 is the fidelity provided by the normalized state    @xmath302    in particular , estimating all the rates @xmath303 , and due to the linearity of the fidelity , one gets the inequality    @xmath304    where @xmath305 is the fidelity provided by the resource state at time zero .",
    "if    @xmath306    the evolved resource state preserves the capability to outperform the separable states . furthermore , the off - diagonal entries and , hence , the entanglement of the resource state , are exponentially damped , but vanish only asymptotically in time @xcite .",
    "thus , the average final entanglement is positive at any finite time , since the expression ( [ av.ent ] ) involves only the modulus of the entries of the resource state .",
    "let us now investigate whether the noisy resource state preserves the property to achieve asymptotically perfect teleportation as @xmath94 .",
    "the presence of non - negligible @xmath296 prevents asymptotically perfect teleportation , because these matrix elements do not contribute to the fidelity .",
    "thus , a necessary condition for the asymptotically perfect teleportation is the vanishing of @xmath296 when @xmath94 .",
    "these contributions are weighted with the probability    @xmath307    where we used the property that the state @xmath308 has trace one .",
    "since the initial state is positive and normalized , @xmath309 , the weight @xmath310 goes to zero if and only if time and the decay rates scale with @xmath53 such that @xmath311 , for all @xmath312 . as a concrete example",
    ", we consider two - particle losses : @xmath313 .",
    "the decay rates in ( [ sol.loss ] ) are    @xmath314    the exponential damping @xmath315 in ( [ sol.loss2 ] ) factorizes in a product of an exponential function depending only on @xmath316 , and the exponential @xmath317 .",
    "thus , for the initial state ( [ res.ex ] ) , the evolved state has the same form with the substitution @xmath318 .",
    "moreover , given an initial state that provides asymptotically perfect teleportation , namely @xmath278 and @xmath279 , the above necessary conditions @xmath319 to preserve the asymptotic teleportation performances turn out to be sufficient as well .",
    "we extended the generalization of quantum teleportation to identical massive particles .",
    "we first reviewed how the notion of entanglement and the teleportation protocol change in the presence of identical particles .",
    "since particles can not be individually addressed , we have to identify subsystems with subalgebras of observables that can be experimentally manipulated . therefore , local parties do not own particles but rather orthogonal modes , such as in optical lattices with wells which can be split into groups .",
    "the aim of the teleportation protocol is to send the state of one mode to a mode owned by a receiver , by means of local operations , classical communication , and the aid of an entangled shared state .",
    "if the mode to be teleported is entangled with another mode , teleportation is also called entanglement swapping .",
    "one can divide a very long distance into segments , such that the noise within each segment is controllable . swapping the entanglement across each segment",
    ", it is possible to share entanglement at distances along which the noise is not directly controllable .",
    "thus , entanglement swapping can be used to share long - distance entanglement , as required for quantum networks @xcite , without the need to physically gather the subsystems in the same place .",
    "perfect teleportation with identical particles is possible only when the number of particles in the resource state tends to infinity .",
    "therefore , we derived sufficient conditions for the resource state to provide asymptotically perfect teleportation , in the above limit .",
    "these results generalize the examples explicitly discussed in @xcite .",
    "moreover , they can be used to establish asymptotic teleportation performances even with only partial knowledge of the resource state .",
    "this situation was exemplified with the ground states of the double - well potential with two - body interactions , which can be prepared with available techniques , i.e. magnetic traps and evaporative cooling @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we studied the robustness of teleportation performances against noise , in connection with the robustness of entanglement of the resource state . in order to model the noise , we considered the mixture of the resource state with undesired states , and the open system dynamics describing dephasing and particle losses .",
    "the capability to outperform separable states is preserved for any mixture with separable states and with almost all entangled states .",
