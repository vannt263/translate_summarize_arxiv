    "it is a longstanding problem to uncover the phase structure of dense nuclear and quark matter in the low temperature and high baryon density region because of its complexity . from the academic point of view",
    ", our curiosity urges us to imagine what an extreme state of cold quark matter at asymptotic high density is like .",
    "in fact , at density far larger than the strange quark mass @xmath5 but still smaller than the charm , bottom , and top quark masses , there has been established a consensus that quark matter takes on color superconductivity in a color - flavor locked ( cfl ) manner  @xcite .",
    "then , what comes next as the density goes down ? this is an important question because , if quark matter appeared in neutron star cores , its state would be strongly affected by @xmath5 .",
    "one plausible candidate was considered to be a gapless color superconducting phase  @xcite , which is a qcd version of the sarma phase  @xcite partially stabilized by neutrality constraints .",
    "specifically the gapless cfl ( gcfl ) phase  @xcite was expected in quark matter in the intermediate density region .",
    "it turns out , however , that the gapless phase is unlikely to exist in such quark matter because of the chromomagnetic instability that develops at sufficiently low temperatures  @xcite . at higher temperatures , a @xmath6-quark superconducting ( usc ) phase",
    "is predicted to occur as a remnant of the gapless phase  @xcite , and the existence of the doubly critical point facing both the usc phase and a @xmath7-quark superconducting ( dsc ) phase  @xcite seems robust  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the chromomagnetic instability in the gapless phase tends toward spontaneous generation of a total momentum @xmath8 carried by each cooper pair  @xcite .",
    "[ in addition to the chromomagnetic instability , an instability appears with respect to inhomogeneous fluctuations in the gap magnitude , leading the gapless state to a bcs - normal phase separation or a bcs - normal mixed phase  @xcite .",
    "see also ref .",
    "@xcite . ] in general , an inhomogeneous superconducting phase characterized by pairing with nonvanishing @xmath8 is referred to as the loff phase named after larkin - ovchinnikov  @xcite and fulde - ferrell  @xcite . in the present context , it is possible to describe a state resulting from the same instability in several different ways : a state with current generation of collective excitations  @xcite , a state with gluon condensation  @xcite , and a colored loff state  @xcite .",
    "they are all equivalent algebraically . in terms of the colored loff state ,",
    "the chromomagnetic instability is to be regarded as an instability with respect to the spatially oscillating phase factor , @xmath9 with the gell - mann matrices @xmath10 , of the pairing gap matrix in color space . in the present paper which focuses on a two - color theory ,",
    "we shall generalize the notion of chromomagnetic instability to a _ phase instability _ that makes sense not only in a charged superconductor but also in a neutral superfluid .    in the loff phase",
    "the translational and rotational symmetries are spontaneously broken by @xmath11 .",
    "the single plane - wave loff phase is only the simplest etude and in general a complicated crystal structure should emerge . in the context of qcd physics  @xcite",
    ", the plane - wave loff phase , crystal structure , stability , and its physical property have been examined mainly by means of the high - density effective theory ( hdet ) and the ginzburg - landau ( gl ) expansion in terms of the pairing gap  @xcite . for the moment",
    "it is an urgent problem to clarify the energetically favorable structure of the three - flavor loff phase .",
    "whereas the phase instability guarantees existence of the loff phase with a lower energy than the gcfl phase even within the single plane - wave ansatz , the hdet and gl approximations do not allow us to identify the most favorable loff phase in full details .",
    "we shall here revisit the loff phase in two - color and two - flavor qcd in the presence of both the quark chemical potential @xmath0 and the isospin chemical potential @xmath1 .",
    "it was pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite that the interval of @xmath1 in which the loff phase occurs exists in such a system at least in weak coupling , while it is nontrivial whether the loff window should survive or not at stronger coupling with a finite quark mass introduced .",
    "we will make use of a mean - field model to address this issue by following a line of argument of ref .",
    "@xcite , which looks successful in reproducing the numerical results of lattice two - color qcd  @xcite .",
    "although it is beyond our current scope , we expect that the lattice two - color qcd could observe a signature of the loff phase numerically .",
    "we adopt two sets of the model parameters , one of which is relevant to currently available lattice simulations in which the diquark condensate has been measured at @xmath12 but @xmath13 .",
    "this work is a first step toward identifying the loff state on lattice .",
    "we can also mention that it is instructive to shed light on two - color qcd as a mimic of real qcd in which the loff state is a natural consequence of the phase instability in the gapless state . in the context of real qcd , we know the direction in which the unstable gapless state goes and consider the loff state as a natural replacement of the unstable state , but it remains to be surveyed how one gives way to the other . at this point , it is advantageous to switch to two - color qcd .",
    "in fact , simplicity inherent in two - color qcd enables us to picture the energy landscape including various states . by doing so",
    ", we can get a feeling that we are heading for the right way dictated by real qcd .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : setup ] we mention unique features of two - color qcd , our mean - field model , approximations to be made , and the twofold parameter choice at weak and intermediate coupling .",
    "section  [ sec : result ] is composed of four subsections presenting numerical results from the mean - field model for the isotropic superfluid phase , the unstable gapless phase , the loff phase , and the energy landscape , respectively .",
    "our main results are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : loff_phase_w ] for weak coupling with massless quarks and in fig .",
    "[ fig : loff_phase_s ] for intermediate coupling accessible in the lattice setting .",
    "we also plot the free energy in the space of the diquark condensate and the pair momentum in figs .",
    "[ fig : energy ] and [ fig : contour ] for the intermediate coupling case .",
    "section  [ sec : conclusion ] is devoted to our conclusions and future perspectives .",
    "in this section , we will briefly summarize a chiral symmetry breaking pattern inherent in two - color qcd , discuss the absence of the fermion sign problem , and then describe a model for two - color matter with nonzero @xmath0 and @xmath1 along with some approximations in calculating the thermodynamic potential .",
    "we will emphasize the benefit from two - color nature that the model prediction is more robust than in three - color case .",
    "two - color qcd has a peculiar feature of chiral symmetry .",
    "when quarks are massless and the chemical potential is zero , chiral symmetry in two - color and two - flavor qcd is augmented from the standard one @xmath14 to @xmath15 .",
    "this is because a doublet and an anti - doublet of the su(2 ) group are indistinguishable , which makes left - handed quarks and right - handed antiquarks belong to the same group multiplet and hence doubles the basis .",
    "in fact this extra symmetry , which is often referred to as the pauli - grsey symmetry  @xcite , amounts to rotational symmetry among the chiral and diquark condensates .",
    "the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking pattern is thus @xmath16 in the presence of diquark condensation .",
    "once a nonzero quark chemical potential sets in , i.e. , @xmath12 , the extended symmetry is reduced to standard global symmetry as @xmath17 .",
    "if quarks are massive , the remaining symmetry is as usual @xmath18 , which spontaneously breaks down to @xmath19 once the quark chemical potential exceeds the mass of the lowest - lying excitations carrying nontrivial baryon number .",
    "because the @xmath20 symmetry is spontaneously broken by the diquark condensation , the system is a superfluid accompanied by massless nambu - goldstone bosons .",
    "the gauge symmetry is intact since the diquark condensate is gauge invariant in this case .",
    "it is obvious that no chromomagnetic instability can happen in any kind of superfluid state of this system because no finite meissner screening mass arises without color symmetry breaking . in other words ,",
    "if we interpret it as the phase instability as we mentioned above , the color singlet diquark condensate can not have any spatially oscillating phase in color space and thus can not lead to any instability involving color degrees of freedom . in terms of the phase instability ,",
    "on the other hand , we can understand that fluctuations in the @xmath20 phase in the gapless superfluid state could result in instability .",
    "it should be mentioned that the modes in the @xmath20 phase itself in a superfluid correspond to the massless nambu - goldstone bosons , and the instability would not emerge in the phase factor @xmath21 but in the wave - vector @xmath11 of the phase , i.e. , the current of the nambu - goldstone boson in a physics language ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for details ) .      in this subsection",
    ", we briefly summarize the sign problem of the fermion determinant  @xcite and make sure that two - color qcd escapes from it for _ any _ number of quark flavors .",
    "the dirac operator in question reads @xmath22 per one quark flavor in euclidean space , where @xmath23 denotes the covariant derivative containing gauge fields . in the presence of the isospin chemical potential @xmath1 with @xmath6 and @xmath7 flavors ,",
    "the dirac operator is then a direct sum of two flavor sectors : @xmath24 . for the moment",
    "we shall focus on the one - flavor @xmath25 to discuss the sign problem , since @xmath26 is sufficient to claim @xmath27 = \\det\\mathcal{m}(\\mu_u)\\cdot\\det\\mathcal{m}(\\mu_d)\\ge0 $ ] .    because the euclidean gamma matrices @xmath28 s are hermitian by convention , the eigenvalue @xmath29 of anti - hermitian @xmath30 , i.e. , @xmath31 is pure imaginary .",
    "the eigenstate @xmath32 has an eigenvalue @xmath33 , which in turn equals to @xmath34 .",
    "the dirac determinant is , therefore , a product of all the paired eigenvalues @xmath35 and @xmath36 , which is non - negative because @xmath37 .    when @xmath0 is nonzero , @xmath38 is hermitian and thus the eigenvalue @xmath29 defined by @xmath39 is no longer pure imaginary but complex . here",
    "again , @xmath32 has an eigenvalue @xmath33 , but it is different from @xmath34 in this case .",
    "therefore , the dirac determinant , given by @xmath40 , is not necessarily non - negative , and when it is negative for some gauge configurations , the sign problem occurs .",
    "two - color qcd is unique in the sense that one can find another eigenstate @xmath41 with an eigenvalue @xmath34 , where @xmath42 is the second pauli matrix in color space and @xmath43 represents the charge conjugation .",
    "obviously , the eigenstate multiplied by @xmath44 has an eigenvalue @xmath45 .",
    "consequently , the eigenvalues of the dirac operator always constitute a quartet : @xmath35 , @xmath46 , @xmath36 , and @xmath47 , leading to non - negative dirac determinant through the relation @xmath48 .",
    "we note that our argument holds even with odd number of quark flavors , although in this case the sign problem was supposed to occur  @xcite .",
    "we can thus conclude that _ two - color qcd has no sign problem at finite density regardless of the number of quark flavors .",
    "this implies that the monte - carlo simulation for two - color qcd with two flavors is feasible in the presence of both @xmath0 and @xmath1 , which would help us elucidate the phase structure .",
    "we turn to a model for two - color and two - flavor quark matter within the bcs ansatz that two particles with opposite momenta @xmath49 and @xmath50 pair with a short - range interaction .",
    "we may then assume that only two mean - fields , namely , the chiral and diquark condensates , @xmath51 are predominant in the region @xmath52 .",
    "we denote the color and flavor indices by @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 , @xmath56 , respectively . here , @xmath57 represents the transposition in the dirac index , and @xmath43 is the charge conjugate matrix to make the diquark condensate lorentz invariant .",
    "the dimensional coefficient @xmath58 , which controls the strength of the four - fermi coupling constant , is common to the chiral and diquark condensates by virtue of the pauli - grsey symmetry . in a rough but intuitively more understandable notation , @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "note that when @xmath61 , the predominant diquark condensate @xmath62 gives way to @xmath63 .",
    "in this work , however , we limit our discussion solely to the region @xmath52 .    in the loff phase where a @xmath6-quark with the momentum @xmath64 and a @xmath7-quark with the momentum @xmath65 form a cooper pair with the total momentum @xmath8 , the diquark condensate has a spatially oscillating phase as @xmath66 it should be noted that we neglect any spin - one condensate such as @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and @xmath69 entirely in this work .",
    "it generally coexists with the spin - zero condensate @xmath62 in the loff state , but is known to be smaller by one order of magnitude than the spin - zero one  @xcite .",
    "we remark that the spin - one condensates could be relevant for even larger fermi surface separation between @xmath6 and @xmath7 quarks  @xcite .",
    "then , the thermodynamic potential with the mean - field condensates @xmath2 and @xmath3 and the pair momentum @xmath11 can be expressed as @xmath70\\biggr\\ } \\notag\\\\   & \\qquad + \\frac{\\sigma^2+\\delta^2}{2 g } \\;. \\label{eq : potential}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath71 is the cut - off parameter and @xmath72 is the current quark mass .",
    "after the @xmath49-integration , the thermodynamic potential no longer depends on the direction of the three - vector @xmath11 but becomes a function of its magnitude @xmath73 alone .",
    "expression  ( [ eq : potential ] ) contains the sum of the quasi - quark energies @xmath74 , which correspond to the 32 eigenvalues of the @xmath75 quark hamiltonian matrix with two colors , two flavors , two spins , quark - antiquark , and nambu - gorkov doubling .",
    "the remaining part is the energy shift associated with the mean - field approximation .",
    "the condensates , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , share the same coupling @xmath58 as implied by the pauli - grsey symmetry ; in the chiral limit @xmath76 at @xmath77 , the thermodynamic potential @xmath78 should be reduced to be a function of @xmath79 .",
    "this feature exemplifies a great advantage of two - color qcd over various model studies of real qcd in which quantities affected by chiral dynamics strongly depend on the model parameters .    when @xmath80 , all quarks have the same constituent mass , @xmath81 , leading to the quark and antiquark energies , @xmath82 with @xmath83 .",
    "the effect of nonzero @xmath1 is to shift @xmath0 by @xmath84 and @xmath85 for @xmath6 and @xmath7 quarks , that is , @xmath86 which results in crossing of the energy levels . in the presence of the diquark condensate @xmath3 ,",
    "the crossing energy levels mix together and a level repulsion occurs .",
    "we will simply approximate the energy levels by mixing between the @xmath6-quark energy @xmath87 and the @xmath7-quark energy @xmath88 .",
    "of course we can also swap @xmath64 and @xmath65 but the integration over @xmath49 washes out the difference eventually .",

    "we should remark that these energy dispersion relations are slightly different from those used in ref .",
    "@xcite because the gap energy @xmath3 is constant in our approximation instead of depending on the relative angle of @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "it is straightforward to introduce any @xmath11 dependence in @xmath3 .",
    "we will , however , stick to a constant @xmath3 , partly because we will confirm later that a constant @xmath3 is enough to reproduce results quantitatively consistent with ref .",
    "@xcite and partly because no reliable ansatz is in hand a priori except when @xmath95 is zero .    as for the antiquark contribution ,",
    "dropping @xmath3 is a good approximation as long as @xmath96 .",
    "such an approximation , however , would apparently ruin the pauli - grsey symmetry which should be present in the limit of @xmath97 . hence , we shall keep @xmath3 as well as @xmath2 also for the antiquark energy levels by adopting the same form of the energy dispersion relations as the quark contribution with @xmath98 replaced by @xmath99 : @xmath100 ^ 2    + \\delta^2}\\biggr|\\ ] ] with eightfold degeneracies again , although difference of @xmath101 from @xmath102 and @xmath103 is merely negligible .",
    "we do not consider the mixing between quarks and antiquarks which would take place with nonvanishing @xmath63 when @xmath61 .    using the thermodynamic potential as specified above",

    "we can confirm that @xmath113 as it should .",
    "the non - monotonic behavior of @xmath3 at @xmath114 is caused by the _ saturation _ effect : the density can not grow unboundedly because the phase space is limited by the presence of @xmath71 , which is observed in lattice simulations as well as in model studies  @xcite .",
    "we remark that our @xmath115 and @xmath116 are to be compared with the results given in figs .",
    "1 and 2 of ref .  @xcite .",
    "the isospin chemical potential @xmath1 plays a role in exerting stress onto quarks to tear the cooper pair apart .",
    "as long as @xmath117 , the isotropic superfluid phase is rigid against such stress .",
    "this can be easily understood from eq .",

    "in contrast to the g2sc case , we do not impose neutrality on the present system . in principle , we can consider electric neutrality by turning the electromagnetic interaction on and putting electrons into the system .",
    "we will not do so , however , partly because the resultant stability of the gapless state with respect to homogeneous change in the gap amplitude as seen in the g2sc case would not be of interest here , and partly because we intend to keep an interesting resemblance of the present system with electric charge turned off and @xmath1 introduced to atomic fermi gases with population imbalance created in low temperature experiments .",

    "that calculations are performed at intermediate coupling.,width=283 ]    the first - order transition from the superfluid to the normal phase occurs above the upper bound of the loff solution for @xmath162 .",
    "this means that the loff window shuts there and the superfluid phase remains the ground state even for @xmath163 until normal quark matter appears .",
    "this behavior , which is a contrast to the case with parameter  i , is caused by stronger coupling rather than by heavier @xmath72 .",
    "in fact , the chiral condensate is much smaller than the diquark condensate at @xmath164 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cond ] .",
    "the loff window opens at @xmath165 where we find the same tendency as the weak coupling case that the loff window widens by the saturation effect . at @xmath166 , for instance , the bounds of the loff window are given by @xmath167 where @xmath168 at @xmath166 .",
    "we note that our plane - wave loff ansatz  ( [ eq : loffansatz ] ) is only the simplest one . if we consider more general three - dimensional crystalline structure , the loff favored region has to be even wider .",
    "we would stress that our results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : loff_phase_s ] strongly support the possibility of probing the generic crystalline color superconducting phase , along with the isotropic superfluid phase , with numerical approach on lattice .",
    "in fact , the values of @xmath1 at which the loff phase occurs are less than a half of @xmath0 , while being larger than the inverse of a typical lattice size .",
    "possible simulation to detect the loff phase would not require weaker coupling , finer lattice , or larger lattice .      we will take a further look at the loff phase found at intermediate coupling .",
    "let us pick up a point of @xmath166 and @xmath169 inside the loff favored region illustrated in fig .",

    "a darker colored region has a smaller energy .",
    "the loff phase is the global minimum of the energy.,width=377 ]    it is obvious from fig .",
    "[ fig : energy ] that the loff phase sits certainly at the global minimum of the potential energy landscape .",
    "the local minimum at @xmath171 is normal quark matter , another local minimum at @xmath172 and @xmath149 is the metastable superfluid phase , and the in - between local maximum along the @xmath3-axis corresponds to the unstable gapless phase . the gapless phase is unstable with respect to fluctuations in any direction in the space of @xmath11 and @xmath3 .",
    "specifically , the instability along the @xmath3 direction is the sarma instability originally noticed in ref .  @xcite .",
    "in the g2sc or gcfl phase , the remedy against the sarma instability comes from the electric and color neutrality conditions . even with neutrality imposed , however , the instability in the @xmath105 direction is still a problem , which is nothing but the chromomagnetic instability in the g2sc or gcfl phase . for a neutral superfluid of interest here ,",
    "it is the phase instability .    , which indicate two minima corresponding to the metastable superfluid phase and the ground state of the loff phase and one maximum corresponding to the unstable gapless phase.,width=328 ]    figure  [ fig : contour ] is the contour density plot of the numerical data in fig .",
    "[ fig : energy ] , which allows us to describe graphically what we mentioned above .",
    "the gapless phase has instabilities leading to normal quark matter , the isotropic superfluid phase , and the loff phase , among which the loff phase has the lowest energy .",
    "this contour plot presumably captures the essence of the instability problem and its implications for qcd quark matter .",
    "we would anticipate that the energy landscape around the g2sc phase is more or less similar to fig .",
    "[ fig : contour ] except that the gapless phase is stabilized against fluctuations in @xmath3 , that is , the gapless state is a saddle point on the energy landscape .",
    "it is hard , however , to imagine what would happen in the case of the gcfl phase with three flavors , because there are three predominant diquark condensates . in large dimensional space spanned by more variational parameters ,",
    "it is not straightforward to see whether the instability in the gapless phase is directly connected to the loff phase .",
    "there could be several distinct loff solutions as conjectured in ref .",
    "it would be a challenging problem to draw the energy landscape in the three - flavor case and to confirm that the instability is responsible for the loff phase , as we have done successfully in two - color and two - flavor qcd in this work .",
    "we investigated the loff favored window of @xmath1 for two - color and two - flavor qcd using a mean - field model .",
    "first , we satisfactorily reproduced the known results at weak coupling .",
    "we then performed our calculation for a set of the model parameters in which the coupling strength is intermediate and thus relevant to currently available lattice simulations .",
    "we found out a nonzero interval of @xmath1 where the single plane - wave loff phase is energetically more favorable than the isotropic superfluid phase and normal quark matter .",
    "for intermediate coupling , we took a close look at the energy landscape to see the relation of the sarma and phase instabilities associated with the gapless solution of the gap equations with the loff phase .    in this work",
    "we do not take account of any possibility of the mixed phase or the phase separation for a nonzero range of @xmath0 as discussed in ref .",
