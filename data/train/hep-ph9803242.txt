    "<S> we develop a coupled channel unitary approach describing the behavior at higher energies of systems whose low - energy dynamics is given by effective @xmath0 and @xmath1 chiral lagrangians . </S>",
    "<S> our free parameters are those of the @xmath1 lagrangian . </S>",
    "<S> when applied to the meson - meson interaction , it yields a remarkable agreement with data up to @xmath2 , dynamically generating the @xmath3 and @xmath4 resonances . </S>",
    "<S> further applications are also proposed .    </S>",
    "<S> = 0.5pt    .5 cm    the effective chiral lagrangian formalism has become a widespread tool to address the problem of the interaction of goldstone bosons @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the most significant example is chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath5pt ) @xcite , which successfully describes the low - energy behavior of the meson - meson interaction . </S>",
    "<S> to lowest order , @xmath0 , the parameters of the chiral lagrangian are basically masses and decay constants . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath1 contains several free parameters ; for instance , in @xmath5pt , 12 chiral parameters are needed to describe the meson - meson interaction . in the case of the standard model strongly interacting symmetry breaking sector ( sisbs ) , one needs 13 parameters </S>",
    "<S> . the limitations of the perturbative chiral approach are obvious since one can not attempt to obtain resonances and it is constrained to low energies . therefore non - perturbative schemes become necessary . </S>",
    "<S> this is the case when describing the meson - meson interaction up to about 1.2 gev , where one finds the @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 in the scalar sector and the @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 in the vector channels . </S>",
    "<S> the same happens if one tries to study the expected resonance spectrum of the sisbs at the large hadron collider .    </S>",
    "<S> an attempt to extend the ideas of chiral symmetry to the non - perturbative regime , constructing a unitary t - matrix , was done in ref.@xcite using the inverse amplitude method ( iam ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this approach proved efficient in reproducing low energy data and produced poles in the amplitudes associated to the @xmath12 and @xmath4 in the vector channel as well as the @xmath6 in the scalar channel . </S>",
    "<S> it has also been applied to study the sisbs resonances that could appear at lhc @xcite . since </S>",
    "<S> only elastic unitarity was imposed in the iam , multichannel problems could not be addressed . as a consequence , neither the @xmath13 and @xmath14 resonances , nor the inelasticities could be obtained . a similar problem with coupled channels </S>",
    "<S> could also appear in the sisbs if the top quark couples strongly to longitudinal gauge bosons .    </S>",
    "<S> the treatment of coupled channels has proved to be crucial in order to reproduce the basic features of the @xmath13 and @xmath14 resonances @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> another non - perturbative method , using coupled channel lippmann - schwinger ( ls ) equations was done in ref.@xcite , using the @xmath0 @xmath5pt amplitudes , @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> a similar work in the @xmath16 system was carried out in ref.@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the ls equations used in @xcite read , in matrix form ,    @xmath17    where @xmath15 and @xmath18 are @xmath19 matrices . </S>",
    "<S> the channels of the mesonic scalar sector in that work are @xmath20 , @xmath21 for isospin @xmath22 as well as @xmath23 , @xmath24 for @xmath25 . in eq.([prim ] ) @xmath26 is given by    @xmath27    with @xmath28 the four - momentum of the initial mesons and @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> an important point realized in ref.@xcite is that if @xmath30 is separated in an on - shell part plus a residual term then the latter , when used in the loops of eq.([vgt ] ) , does not have to be calculated , since it only leads to coupling and mass renormalization . </S>",
    "<S> this allows the on - shell factorization of @xmath15 and @xmath18 from eq.([vgt ] ) reducing the ls equations to pure algebraic relations :    @xmath31    thus , we obtain @xmath32^{-1 } \\cdot t_2 \\label{ls}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 is a diagonal matrix given by    @xmath34    a cut - off , @xmath35 , in the integral over @xmath36 in eq.([gii ] ) was adopted as a regularization method and @xmath35 was adjusted to data . with a value of @xmath37 </S>",
    "<S> gev a remarkable agreement was obtained for @xmath38 , in the @xmath39 channels . </S>",
    "<S> however , a simple extrapolation of the model to the @xmath40 channel fails to reproduce the @xmath12 and @xmath41 resonances , which however are nicely reproduced in the scheme of ref.@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> it seems clear that there is important dynamics in the @xmath1 chiral lagrangian , particularly related to vector mesons , which can not be generated by the ls resummation . </S>",
    "<S> in fact the resonance saturation hypothesis @xcite assumes that the @xmath1 terms are generated through the exchange of resonances .    </S>",
    "<S> we propose here a simple and rather general unitary scheme in coupled channels which combines elements of the works in refs.@xcite and @xcite , that can be now obtained as particular cases . </S>",
    "<S> when applied to the meson - meson interaction , this method describes simultaneously all the channels and reproduces the resonances below @xmath42 gev .    </S>",
    "<S> with @xmath43 coupled channels , and for a given @xmath44 , unitarity imposes ( recall that @xmath45 ) @xmath46 where @xmath6 is an @xmath43-diagonal matrix accounting for the phase space in each channel . with the normalization of @xcite , that we adopt in the following , @xmath47 of eq.([gii ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus , eq.([tsigmat ] ) can be cast as @xmath48    which is more conveniently rewritten as @xmath49^{-1}{\\nonumber}\\\\ & = & t_2 \\cdot [ t_2\\cdot { \\hbox{re}\\,}t^{-1 } \\cdot t_2- i t_2\\cdot   { \\hbox{im}\\,}g\\cdot t_2]^{-1}\\cdot t_2 \\label{method}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the next step is to realize that , although @xmath18 is certainly a poorly convergent function in the chiral expansion ( above @xmath50 mev for mesons ) , and particularly close to poles , the function @xmath51 may converge much faster . </S>",
    "<S> the results we obtain , seem to support this conjecture . </S>",
    "<S> ( intuitively one can imagine a function such as @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 , expanded around @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> this expansion of @xmath18 for values of @xmath56 around @xmath57 , where @xmath18 has a pole , is very poorly convergent , whereas @xmath58 converges very fast ) .    </S>",
    "<S> expanding @xmath18 within the chiral formalism up to @xmath1 , we have    @xmath59    where @xmath60 is the pure @xmath1 @xmath5pt amplitude . therefore @xmath61 the above derivation is formal since @xmath15 and @xmath18 may not be invertible . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , that happens for the @xmath62 channel . </S>",
    "<S> that is the reason why we write @xmath18 as in eq.([method ] ) . in that way </S>",
    "<S> , we only need the expansion of @xmath63 , which can be obtained by continuity and , as it can be seen in eq.([vrv ] ) , is well behaved . finally , from eqs.([method ] ) and ( [ vrv ] ) , we arrive at @xmath64^{-1}\\cdot t_2 \\label{iamgen}\\ ] ] this , by itself , is an interesting result since , at @xmath1 , it is the coupled channel generalization of the iam @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> apart from that , this method has other advantages . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , as it is well known @xcite , the iam with a single channel has problems around the adler zeros in the scalar sector . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , eq.([iamgen ] ) with just one channel yields a double zero . the problem is actually more serious since the expansion of @xmath65 in eqs.([expansions],[vrv ] ) is meaningless if @xmath66 or @xmath67 . </S>",
    "<S> however , the expansion of @xmath65 in eq.([expansions ] ) holds as a matrix relation even if one of the matrix elements of @xmath15 vanishes or is smaller than the corresponding one of @xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the adler zeros appear as single zeros with the coupled channel method .    </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , eq.([iamgen ] ) requires the complete evaluation of the whole @xmath60 matrix , including loops , which is rather involved . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , at present , there are only @xmath1 calculations of meson - meson scattering for @xmath20 and @xmath68 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , inspired in the ls equations , we will obtain a good approximation to eq.([iamgen ] ) , without the complete @xmath1 calculation .    </S>",
    "<S> let us then first reinterpret the ls equations discussed above using eqs.([method ] ) and ( [ vrv ] ) : it is enough to take @xmath33 as in eq.([gii ] ) , with an appropriate cut - off such that @xmath69 and we recover eq.([ls ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> note that in this way , we are accounting for the s - channel one - loop diagram responsible for the unitarity logarithms . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the freedom in the cut - off allows one to reproduce the relevant counterterm contribution in the meson scalar sector , as shown in @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> however , such approximations can not hold in all meson - meson channels , since other @xmath1 counterterms become essential . therefore , in the present work , we are also considering the polynomial coming from the @xmath1 tree level contributions , that we denote by @xmath70 , and we write    @xmath71    the coefficients of @xmath70 are combinations of the @xmath1 chiral parameters ( which are usually denoted @xmath72 within @xmath5pt and @xmath73 or @xmath74 in the sisbs ) .    note </S>",
    "<S> that @xmath75 is not just a vehicle for free parameters . </S>",
    "<S> it also ensures that we are considering the most general @xmath1 polynomial structure compatible with chiral symmetry and its breaking . </S>",
    "<S> once we have this chiral structure , the cut - off regularization can be now substituted by any other scheme .    in eq.([appreat4 ] ) one is explicitely neglecting the crossed - channel loop contributions . </S>",
    "<S> although these loops do not yield an imaginary part in the s - channel , they do contribute to the real part . </S>",
    "<S> however , in the s - channel these contributions have a smooth dependence on the energy and can be effectively reabsorbed in the @xmath72 coefficients .    concerning tadpoles , in the equal mass limit </S>",
    "<S> , their finite contributions can be absorbed in the chiral parameters . when considering different masses , it is possible to add and subtract a finite tadpole - like term with an `` average '' mass . </S>",
    "<S> the added part is absorbed in the chiral parameters . </S>",
    "<S> the part not absorbed is thus of the order of the difference between physical masses and the `` average '' mass , whose value is such that these contributions are minimized .    </S>",
    "<S> then , using eqs.([iamgen ] ) and ( [ appreat4 ] ) we can write our final formula : @xmath76^{-1}\\cdot t_2\\ ] ]    our purpose now is to illustrate how well the method that we have developed works in practice . </S>",
    "<S> to that aim , we will use it in a fit to meson - meson data , and we will denote the resulting parameters by @xmath77 ( see table i ) . </S>",
    "<S> the reasons for changing their name are that , first , as we have already commented , part of the effect of crossed channels terms and tadpoles will be reabsorbed in @xmath77 and , second , that we have chosen a cut - off regularization .    in fig.1 </S>",
    "<S> we show the results of our approach , represented by phase shifts of the @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 reactions plus a mass distribution for the @xmath14 resonance in the @xmath81 channel . </S>",
    "<S> the curves have been obtained with the fitted parameters given in table 1 . </S>",
    "<S> the figure shows that the @xmath82 and @xmath4 resonances are very well reproduced and the phase shifts agree remarkably well with data from threshold up to about @xmath83 , where the influence of multi - meson channels should start to be more relevant . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath6 meson , around 500 mev and with a large width , as found in @xcite and @xcite is also reproduced here .    in summary , </S>",
    "<S> we have proposed a unitary scheme in coupled channels that allows us to extend the applicability range of the chiral lagrangian formalism . </S>",
    "<S> we have shown how it can be implemented to @xmath1 using the coefficients of the second order lagrangian as free parameters . when applied to meson - meson interactions , </S>",
    "<S> the scheme is remarkably successful and reproduces the different resonances and data up to about 1.2 gev .    </S>",
    "<S> further applications that we can suggest are @xmath84 @xcite , form factors , decay of particles with a pair of mesons in the final state , meson - nucleon interactions , etc ... within the sisbs it can also be very useful to study the coupling of longitudinal gauge bosons to transversal gauge bosons or top quarks </S>",
    "<S> . it also seems likely that , with a proper generalization , it could also be applied to non - relativistic solid - state systems , as high-@xmath85 superconductors , whose effective lagrangian formulation is also raising a great interest @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the potential of the method to extend the usefulness and advantages of the effective chiral lagrangian formalism to regions otherwise inaccessible is certainly enormous . </S>"
