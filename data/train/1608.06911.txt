    "the axion , a pseudoscalar particle originally associated with a solution of the strong @xmath1 problem in qcd @xcite , has been analyzed in a variety of astrophysical contexts , particularly in cosmological evolution @xcite and as a candidate for dark matter @xcite .",
    "axions can condense into gravitationally bound objects , either in the early universe through large - scale overdensities in a coherent axion field ( called `` miniclusters '' ) , or through gravitational cooling and collapse ( called `` axion stars '' ) @xcite .",
    "the masses of weakly bound axion stars have been computed previously @xcite , and they are bounded above by gravitational stability @xcite .",
    "axion stars which exceed this maximum mass @xmath2 have a fate which remains an open question .",
    "some authors @xcite suggest that such configurations collapse to a compact , very dense state .",
    "recently , the author of @xcite examined the collapse of a boson star with an attractive self - interaction which has @xmath3 , using a dynamical equation derived from a gaussian ansatz for its wavefunction .",
    "the author found that , as its potential is unbounded from below , a star of this kind collapses all the way to its schwarzschild radius and forms a black hole .",
    "indeed , the leading axion self - interaction is attractive ; axionic or other bosonic objects with repulsive interactions have been considered by @xcite .",
    "however , the axion potential contains additional terms which become increasingly important as the axion density becomes large .",
    "it is thus plausible to ask whether these higher - order terms , some of which give rise to repulsive self - interactions , can stabilize the collapsing axion star prior to its formation of a black hole state . in this note",
    ", we will consider the consequences of including the full self - interacting axion potential in the collapse of heavy , weakly bound axion stars .    in section [ secexpansion ] , we review the nonrelativistic limit of axion field theory in the description of axion stars ; then in section [ secvariation ] , we outline the variational method used to find energetically stable bound states , and the computation of the total collapse time for large mass solutions .",

    "in this section we outline the proof that the contribution of the self - interaction potential to the total energy is finite in the @xmath72 limit , and consequently that the kinetic energy @xmath82 is dominant .",
    "the self - interaction term , coming from eq .",
    "( [ energygausint ] ) for the gaussian ansatz is of the form @xmath202dx   { \\nonumber}\\\\      & = \\frac{4\\pi}{n\\,\\delta}\\int_0^z\\rho^3\\sqrt{2\\,\\ln\\frac{z}{u } }            \\big[1-j_0(u)-\\frac{u^2}{4}\\big]\\frac{du}{u } { \\nonumber}\\\\      & = \\frac{4\\pi}{n\\,\\delta}\\,\\mathcal{i } \\label{intsi }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where in the second step we defined @xmath203 with @xmath204 .",
    "we are interested in the case of @xmath72 , corresponding to @xmath205 .",
    "we proceed with the estimation of the integral @xmath206 in the limit @xmath72 in the following way .",
    "break up the integral into two parts : ( 1 ) @xmath207 , integrated over the interval @xmath208 , where @xmath209 , and ( 2 ) @xmath210 , integrated over the remaining @xmath211 . consider first @xmath207 : at @xmath212 , the integrand is dominated by the expression @xmath213\\frac{1}{u }      & \\approx \\rho^3\\sqrt{\\ln\\frac{1}{u}}\\big[-\\frac{u^4}{64}\\big]\\frac{1}{u } { \\nonumber}\\\\       & = -\\frac{\\rho^3}{64}u^3\\sqrt{\\ln\\frac{1}{u } } { \\nonumber}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which goes quickly to @xmath158 as @xmath214 . at larger values @xmath215 , on the other hand , @xmath207 is dominated by the term @xmath216\\frac{du}{u }         \\sim \\rho^3 \\sqrt{\\ln z},\\ ] ] and consequently , @xmath217    for @xmath210 , we consider large @xmath218 , since @xmath219 .",
    "then the bracket in eq .",
    "( [ intsi ] ) dominated by the quadratic term @xmath220 , since @xmath221 .",
    "thus , @xmath222 making the change of variables @xmath223 , we can write it in the form @xmath224 { \\nonumber}\\\\        & = -\\frac{n\\,\\delta}{8\\pi}\\big[\\text{erf}\\big(\\sqrt{2\\ln\\frac{z}{\\nu}}\\big )          - \\frac{4\\,\\nu^2}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}}\\frac{\\sqrt{\\ln\\frac{z}{\\nu}}}{z^2}\\big)\\big ] .   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the limit @xmath205 , the first term in the brackets @xmath225 , while the second term vanishes .",
    "thus , @xmath226    finally , since @xmath207 , given by eq .",
    "( [ i1eq ] ) , vanishes as @xmath72 , the self - interaction energy approaches a constant in the limit @xmath72 : @xmath227 because this result is finite , we are led to conclude that the kinetic energy , which diverges as @xmath73 , provides the dominant contribution to the energy at @xmath72 .",
    "the gravitational interaction , which diverges as @xmath228 , is also negligible in this region .",
    "thus the axion star energy is always bounded from below . though we have here only proved this for the gaussian ansatz ,",
