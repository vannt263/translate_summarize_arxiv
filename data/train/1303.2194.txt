    "the parafermions are thought of as abelian anyons which acquire a phase of @xmath187 when exchanged counterclockwise .",
    "we must then pay attention to the paths the anyons hop along . hopping processes that go above or below the chain correspond , in general , to _ different _ operators .",
    "e.g. , motion above the chain , and then motion back below the chain , corresponds to an anyon moving in a closed circle , and should therefore give a phase that depends on the total anyonic charge enclosed by the path .",
    "we define the operator @xmath188 to describe hopping between sites @xmath189 and @xmath22 in the first chain , such that the anyons move _ below _ the chain . similarly , @xmath190 and @xmath191 describe hopping processes between sites in the @xmath192 and @xmath193 chains that occur below the chains . after combining the two chains , however , we must consider the fact that the hopping process between @xmath194 sites follows a trajectory that passes the @xmath192 sites from  _ above _ [ see fig .",

    "the operator @xmath200 describes a process in which a particle hops below the combined chain .",
    "the fact that hopping between former @xmath194 sites passes the @xmath192 sites from above is implemented by next hopping back below each @xmath192 site which was passed , and then hopping forward again , this time above the @xmath192 site .",
    "this operation leads to a phase factor of @xmath201 to the power of the number of parafermions at the @xmath192 site .",

    "note that this issue does not arise in majorana chains ( @xmath119 ) where a phase of either @xmath202 or @xmath203 appears when hopping below or above the chain , respectively , so the additional phase factor always squares to unity .",
    "following the same logic , hopping processes within the @xmath192 chain do not need to be modified when mapping them to the combined chain :    @xmath204    a similar rule holds for @xmath192 sites with even indices .",
