    "the heisenberg uncertainty principle assures that no function of the canonically conjugated pair @xmath4 can be defined in a way to be interpreted as a genuine probability density in phase - space . despite this fact",
    ", many phase - space representations of quantum mechanics have been developed and demonstrated to be powerfull tools in different fields , such as semiclassical limit @xcite and quantum optics @xcite .    in 1932",
    "wigner @xcite introduced his famous _ quasi - probability _ function @xmath0 , so named for its possible negativity in some regions of phase - space . for a pure ensemble with density operator @xmath5 , @xmath0 is usually presented as an integral in configuration space : @xmath6 among other appealing properties , the above function yields the correct marginal probabilities : integration of @xmath0 in the variable @xmath7 gives the position probability density , and conversely , integration in the @xmath8-axis leads to the probability density in momentum space .",
    "the wigner function contains all the information on the ensemble , providing an alternative formalism for quantum mechanics . in the case of mixed ensembles",
    "it enables the calculation of quantum averages in a classical way .    considering that the simplest way to address quantum mechanics in phase - space is , arguably , by employing coherent states , it is natural to ask how the wigner function is related to this representation .",
    "not surprisingly , this connection has been partially studied by cahill and glauber @xcite , and wnsche @xcite , on very formal grounds .",
    "we shall be concerned with the slightly different , but equivalent question of how the wigner function is related to the analytical representation associated to the coherent states ( the so - called bargmann representation @xcite ) .",
    "our purpose in this work is , firstly , to use the fact that coherent states are maximally localized structures in phase - space to give a simple derivation of the bargmann integral representation of wigner function ( section iii ) .",
    "we believe the method we use to obtain this result is simpler than the previous ones @xcite .",
    "it provides more physical insight and leads to the non - integral representation given in section iv in a natural way .",
    "these discrete representations have been often used in numerical evaluations of wigner function in theoretical @xcite and experimental situations , e. g. , in the reconstruction of motional states of trapped atoms and ions @xcite . in section",
    "v we discuss a relation involving the geometry of wigner function and the spacial uncertainty of the coherent state basis we use to represent it .",
    "our final comments are outlined in section vi .",
    "canonical coherent states @xcite are defined in terms of number states associated to quantum harmonic oscillators : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is a complex label , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the mean values of the related quantum operators in the state @xmath13 , and @xmath14 is a positive arbitrary constant .",
    "such states constitute an over - complete basis @xcite of the hilbert space , and therefore , can be used to express the resolution of unit : @xmath15 where @xmath16 .",
    "we recall that in the position representation we have @xmath17 from which it is clear that the parameter @xmath14 is related to the uncertainty in position of the state @xmath13 ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "this constant can be freely chosen .",
    "note , however , that the minimum uncertainty relation @xmath19 must be satisfied ( implying @xmath20 ) .",
    "in order to define the wigner function as a phase - space integral we start by conveniently inserting coherent - state unit operators in expression ( [ wig0 ] ) @xmath21 since @xmath22 is a gaussian function of @xmath23 ( see equation ( [ gauss ] ) ) the integration in this variable readily gives @xmath24 in order to better explore the properties of coherent - states we change variables as follows : @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "since the jacobian determinant is unitary one gets @xmath27 note that , due to the minimum uncertainty character of coherent states , the integration in @xmath28 and @xmath29 involving @xmath30 , with @xmath31 being a @xmath32 function , falls - off in a gaussian - like way for @xmath33 .",
    "therefore , it is safe to make an expansion around this point .",
    "however , before proceding to such an expansion , we recall that @xmath34 is not an analytical function of @xmath35 , since there is a ( trivial ) dependence on @xmath36 , so that @xmath37",
    ". thus , the referred expansion , in the coherent state representation , amounts for a two variable taylor series .",
    "this unnecessary complication can be avoided in the bargmann representation , defined as @xmath38 , which provides a description based on entire functions @xcite .",
    "re - writing the wigner function in this formalism we get @xmath39 since @xmath40 is an analytic function of its argument one can proceed a single variable taylor expansion : @xmath41 .",
    "we obtain @xmath42 the integral in @xmath43 and @xmath44 is given by @xmath45 thus @xmath46 by writing @xmath47 we have @xmath48 , where we used the fact that @xmath49 for @xmath50 to extend the second sum in @xmath51 from @xmath52 to @xmath53 .",
    "this leads to @xmath54 where we used the binomial expansion .",
    "we finally get @xmath55 which can be written in a more symmetrical way as : @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "this expression is the phase - space analogous of equation ( [ wig0 ] ) .",
    "it is clear that in the case of a mixed ensemble of states @xmath59 with statistical weights @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) we have @xmath62 , where each @xmath63 is given by equation ( [ wigsim ] )",
    "it is well - known that integrals over phase - space are , in some situations , not suitable for numerical evaluations of wigner functions @xcite . in this section",
    "we obtain a non - integral representation of @xmath0 , in terms of derivatives of bargmann functions , from expansions around @xmath64 . the same argumentation used in the previous section is valid here : @xmath65 falls - off in a gaussian - like way for @xmath66 .",
    "let us write @xmath67^*=\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}\\frac{1}{n ! } \\frac{{\\rm",
    "d}^n f^*}{{\\rm d } { z^*}^n}\\ ; \\left ( \\frac{w^*}{2}\\right)^n\\ ; , \\ ; \\ ; f(z - w/2)=\\sum_{j=0}^{\\infty}\\frac{1}{j ! }",
    "\\frac{{\\rm d}^j f}{{\\rm d } { z}^j}\\ ; \\left ( -\\frac{w}{2}\\right)^j\\ ; .\\ ] ] substituting in ( [ wigsim ] ) we have @xmath68 where @xmath69 the integration gives @xmath70 where , again , the summation in @xmath71 may be extended to @xmath72 by means of the already referred property of the gamma function and , @xmath73 denotes the confluent hypergeometric function of second kind @xcite .",
    "going back to ( [ wigsim2 ] ) we obtain the compact expression @xmath74 as a simple application we take a harmonic oscillator eigenstate @xmath75 .",
    "we then have @xmath76 , leading to @xmath77 summation in @xmath78 and @xmath79 readily gives the expected result @xmath80 where @xmath81 denotes the laguerre polynomial of degree @xmath82 .",
    "we note that equation ( [ wighy ] ) can be written more elegantly as the quadratic form @xmath83 with the vector @xmath3 and the hermitian matrix @xmath2 given by @xmath84 where we have suppressed the third argument @xmath85 in the matrix elements .",
    "although expression ( [ wigmatrix ] ) does not seem to be particularly usefull in simple analytical calculations , it has potential value from both , formal and computational points of view . equation ( [ wigmatrix ] ) may be suitable for numerical evaluations of @xmath0 in situations where the bargmann function and its derivatives are easier to obtain than the equivalent integrations in phase space or configuration space ( which seems to be usually true ) .",
    "the matrix @xmath2 is built with tabulated functions and the vector @xmath3 has a simple recursive nature , namely @xmath86 .",
    "the diagonal elements of @xmath2 can be put in a simpler form : @xmath87 , which makes clear that the previous definitions of @xmath2 and @xmath3 are less effective in regions of large @xmath88 . the alternative definitions @xmath89 and @xmath90 ( orthogonal matrix ) with @xmath91 may be more convenient , depending on the system under study , for regions of large @xmath88 , where the entries of @xmath92 and the derivatives of the bargmann function are both small .",
    "a final note on the use of variables @xmath93 and @xmath94 to express @xmath0 is in order . since in the original definition ( [ wig0 ] )",
    "there is no mention to the parameter @xmath14 , @xmath0 must not depend on it regardless the variables we are using to cover the phase - space .",
    "thus , we have d@xmath95d@xmath96 , which leads to @xmath97 where we have used d@xmath98d@xmath99 and d@xmath100d@xmath101 .",
    "it is clear that some explicit dependence on @xmath14 is required in order to compensate the implicit dependence contained in @xmath93 and @xmath94 , so that @xmath102 . as we shall see , the above relation contains a piece of geometrical information . by writing @xmath103",
    "it is easy to show that both sides of equation ( [ geom1 ] ) are independent of b. we obtain @xmath104 this relation can be put in a more suggestive form : @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the unit vector in phase - space parallel to @xmath107 and @xmath108 is the gradient operator in phase - space .",
    "we see , therefore , that @xmath109 is proportional to the component of the gradient of the wigner function in the direction @xmath107 , i. e. , to the variation of @xmath0 in the @xmath106 direction ( see figure 1 ) .    as an illustration",
    "let us assume that @xmath110 is itself a coherent state @xmath111 , with @xmath112 . by using ( [ wigsim ] ) ( note that @xmath14 and @xmath113 not necessarily coincide ) it is easy to obtain @xmath114 it is clear from the corresponding expression in the @xmath4 variables , @xmath115 , that @xmath0 is independent of @xmath14 . in this particular case ,",
    "relation ( [ geom3 ] ) estates that @xmath116=(q ,- p)\\ , .",
    "\\ , { \\bf grad}\\ , w$ ] , for any @xmath14 .",
    "in this work we presented a simple and intuitive derivation of the bargmann integral representation of wigner function along with a non - integral representation . we hope that expression ( [ wigmatrix ] ) will be of use in numerical computations for a class of theoretical and experimental problems in which the derivatives of the bargmann functions are readily accessible or , at least , easier to calculate than the integrations in configuration space , equation ( [ wig0 ] ) , or phase - space , equation ( [ wigsim ] ) .",
    "finally we call attention to the fact that , despite the fact that @xmath0 does not have an overall dependence on the parameter @xmath14 , its explicit dependence has a simple geometrical meaning ."
