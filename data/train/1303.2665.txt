    "in massive electrodynamics , a charged star collapsing into a black hole must lose its electric field  the black hole must discharge . for a small photon mass @xmath0 , the rate of discharge can be estimated as follows .",
    "one treats the mass term @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the electrostatic potential , as the density of the screening charge @xmath3 .",
    "one further assumes that the screening charge moves into the black hole at the speed of light .",
    "then @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the schwarzschild radius .",
    "this gives an exponential discharge , @xmath6 , with the decay rate @xmath7 . in ",
    "[ photon ] we show that this estimate correctly describes the ( intermediate asymptotic ) decay of the electric field near the black hole in the limit of small photon mass .",
    "now consider a black hole in massive gravity .",
    "the gravitational field of the black hole is screened by a negative energy density @xmath8 , where @xmath0 is the graviton mass and @xmath9 is the planck mass .",
    "we argue in  [ disappear ] that this negative energy must be accreted onto the black hole .",
    "assuming , like we did in massive electrodynamics , that the screening energy accretes onto the black hole at the speed of light , we get a decreasing black hole mass : @xmath10 . thus , the black hole loses mass and gradually disappears .",
    "the black hole disappearance is a weird prediction of massive gravity , as it seems to make possible the following scenario : ( i ) there was a star in an asymptotically minkowski space - time , ( ii ) the star collapses into a black hole , ( iii ) the black hole disappeares leaving behind just the minkowski space - time .    to be clear , our results are inconsequential for real astrophysical black holes .",
    "if we live in an asymptotically flat universe with a massive graviton , the graviton mass must be smaller than the hubble constant and the disappearance time much longer than the hubble time .",
    "in fact , the phenomenological continuity of @xmath11 limit is a quite satisfactory outcome .",
    "but the very possibility of disappearance ( from the asymptotically minkowski , eternal universe ) seems to be a badness of the massive gravity .",
    "what makes the above scenario impossible in general relativity is the conservation of the asymptotically defined adm mass . in massive gravity",
    "the adm mass vanishes  this is the characteristic property of the theory . and while an alternative globally conserved quantity can be defined in massive gravity (  [ adm ] ) , global charges are not conserved in the presence of black holes . of the second",
    "metric vanishes , the gravitational radius with respect to this metric is always zero , leading to the full disappearance of black holes in massive gravity . for any finite @xmath12 , we expect the `` mass discharge '' of black holes in bimetric gravity to continue until the gravitational radii with respect to the two metrics coincide , at which point the time - dependent black hole solutions settle to the regular static solutions . ]",
    "in this section , we first formulate the einstein - proca theory and argue that charged black holes must discharge (  [ ep ] ) .",
    "we next study the decay of the electric field and define the discharge mode (  [ discharge ] ) . finally , we find quasi - stationary time - dependent solutions in the limit of small photon mass and identify the discharge mode (  [ approx_discharge ] ) .",
    "our massive gravity calculation will closely follow the calculation of  [ approx_discharge ] .",
    "the field of charged stars and black holes in massive electrodynamics is governed by the proca equation [ proca ] & _ ( g^g^f_)+m^2a^=4 j^ , where @xmath13 , and @xmath14 is the electric current .",
    "the einstein equation is [ einstein ] g_=_+t_^(m ) , where @xmath15 is the sress - energy tensor of matter and @xmath16 is the stress - energy tensor of the proca field t^(m)_=t^(0)_+m^2(a_a_-g_g^a_a _ ) , where @xmath17 is the stress tensor of the maxwell theory . for black holes and outside stars @xmath18 , @xmath19 . here , we only consider the spherically symmetric case where the metric is diagonal in @xmath20 coordinates .",
    "the spherical symmetry also implies that the only non - vanishing component of @xmath21 is @xmath22 .    for static solutions ,",
    "the only non - zero component of the proca field is @xmath23 .",
    "the @xmath24 component vanishes , because the @xmath25 component of equation reads [ dt ] _",
    "t(g^ttg^rrf_tr)+m^2g^rra_r= 4 j^r , which forces @xmath26 when @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "the @xmath29 component of then becomes [ proca0 ] _",
    "r(g^rrg^tt_r a_t)+m^2g^tta_t= 4 j^t , and gives @xmath23 .",
    "solutions vanishing at spatial infinity have the expected yukawa behavior at large @xmath30 : [ yukawa ] a_trr_g . defining the electric charge via the gauss s law",
    ", this shows that localized sources are screened by the opposite charge density @xmath31 , carried by the proca field .",
    "this is how one can calculate the electric field of a charged star .",
    "but static charged black holes do not exist , as they would be singular at horizon . to demonstrate this ,",
    "consider the invariant product @xmath32 , which is an observable in proca theory .",
    "the product diverges at horizon because it reduces to @xmath33 and @xmath34 at horizon ( if @xmath23 were to vanish both at horizon and at infinity , eq .",
    "would give @xmath35 , corresponding to an uncharged black hole ) .",
    "the horizon singularity of the static solution indicates that newly formed charged black holes would get rid of their electric field hair .",
    "the corresponding time - dependent solutions will be studied in the next section .      for simplicity ,",
    "we assume that the charge is small",
    ". then we can use the schwarzschild metric [ sch0 ] ds^2=(1-r_gr)dt^2-(1-r_gr)^-1dr^2-r^2d^2 . the vacuum proca equation for spherically symmetrical field",
    "can be transformed to an equation for the physical electric field @xmath36 ( the field is , of course , radial ) [ proca3 ] _",
    "t^2e-(1-r_gr)_r((1-r_gr)1r^2_r(r^2e))+m^2(1-r_gr)e=0 , which can be brought to another useful form : [ proca4 ] ( _ t^2-_^2+v)=0 , where @xmath37 , @xmath38 is the tortoise coordinate , and the effective potential is v=(1-r_gr)(2r^2 - 3r_gr^3+m^2 )",
    ".    one can now set up an initial value problem by specifying the initial @xmath39 and @xmath40 and integrate eq . forward in time . since @xmath41 is non - singular for all @xmath42 , an initially non - singular @xmath39 will remain so at all later times .",
    "numerical experiments with various initial conditions confirm the anticipated decay of any initial electric field .",
    "moreover , for small photon mass the decaying solutions asymptote to a mode that is best described by the intuitive picture of a quasi - stationary accretion of the screening charges onto the black hole : the _ discharge mode_.    we formally define the discharge mode by postulating the exponential in time decay of the field @xmath43 .",
    "the field is in - going at horizon and decreasing at spatial infinity : [ dmode ] ( -(dd)^2+^2+v)=0 , = - ,  - , 0 ,  + .",
    "this eigenvalue problem is solved numerically in appendix a , where we also show that our previous estimate of the discharge rate happens to be asymptotically exact : @xmath44 in the limit @xmath45 .",
    "we emphasize that the discharge mode is not a true long - time asymptote . for @xmath46 ,",
    "the electric field will become oscillatory with an algebraic decay @xmath47 , as shown in @xcite . nor does the discharge mode uniquely describe the time evolution of the electric field outside a charged star which collapses into a black hole .",
    "the evolution will depend on how exactly the collapse occurs , and the electric field will be given by a linear superposition of the decaying initial field and the field emitted by the charges moving into the black hole .",
    "if the charges move into the black hole fast enough , it seems reasonable to assume that the radiation will be mostly beamed into the black hole .",
    "the outside field is then probably dominated by the discharge mode .",
    "but in any case , the decay of the electric field can not occur faster than the decay of the discharge mode .",
    "so to be precise , for small @xmath0 , the intermediate - asymptotic decay of the near - hole electric field occurs in the discharge mode .      in the limit of small @xmath48 , the quasi - stationary character of",
    "the discharge mode becomes sharper . in this section",
    "we show that there exists a two - parameter family of quasi - stationary solutions characterized by the initial charge of the black hole @xmath49 and the discharge rate @xmath50 .",
    "the previously defined discharge mode corresponds to the unique @xmath51 ratio for which the horizon is non - singular .",
    "the approximate method used in this section helps us extract analogous quasi - stationary solutions in massive gravity , where on the one hand , time - dependent simulations seem impossible , and on the other , @xmath52 is a reasonable assumption .",
    "let us return to the vacuum einstein - proca equations ( [ proca],[einstein ] ) .",
    "the first observation to make is that when @xmath52 , the expected discharge rate @xmath53 is so small that the induced time - dependence of the electric field and the metric are negligibly small as compared to the @xmath30-dependence .",
    "the only effect of time - dependence is to allow @xmath54 .",
    "this can be seen from the expression for the screening charge current @xmath55 , which gives [ qdot ] .q",
    "= m^2g^rra_r|_r = r_g .",
    "the second observation is that in the near - hole region we have @xmath56 , and as long as the fields are regular , the terms proportional to @xmath0 in eqs . and are negligible .",
    "we therefore recover the time - independent einstein - maxwell theory , but now with an additional ` gauge ' condition on @xmath57 [ proca1 ] _ ( g^a_)=0 , which is obtained by taking the divergence of eq .. this equation happens to be independent of @xmath0 , and in our approximation it becomes an equation for @xmath24 [ ar ] _",
    "this is just the condition of stationary flow on @xmath58 .    assuming the schwarzschild metric",
    ", we solve a_r= , where @xmath59 is a new integration constant related through eq . to the discharge rate @xmath60 . as for @xmath23",
    ", we can use the einstein - maxwell result @xmath61 .",
    "thus , we have a two - parameter family of quasi - stationary solutions characterized by the charge @xmath49 and the discharge rate @xmath50 .",
    "requiring the horizon to be regular uniquely fixes the discharge rate .",
    "for instance , the regularity of the norm squared @xmath62 gives [ dotq ] q = m^2 r_g q , which agrees with the previous calculation of the discharge mode in the limit @xmath63 .",
    "the sign is undetermined by our equations , which are invariant under the time - reversal , but physical considerations select the negative sign . in will be replaced by @xmath64 , the radius of the outer horizon . ]",
    "in this section , we first introduce fierz - pauli massive gravity , its nonlinear completions , and some of their relevant properties (  [ secfp ] ) .",
    "we next consider asymptotically flat spacetimes and argue that black holes must disappear (  [ theorem ] ) . in ",
    "[ time - dep ] , we find quasi - stationary solutions , and show that unlike massive electrodynamics there is no unique disappearance rate .",
    "we next examine the implications of our findings in the actual problem of star collapse (  [ fate ] ) . finally in  [ adm ] , we discuss the concept of global energy in massive gravity , and its failure in the presence of black holes .      by fierz - pauli massive gravity ( fp )",
    ", we denote a class of theories described by the einstein - hilbert action plus the ( non - linear version of ) fierz - pauli action : [ s ] & s = s_eh+s_fp , & + & s_eh=-12d^4xr , & + [ fp ] & s_fp = m^2d^4xu . & here we have set @xmath65 , and @xmath66 is a lorentz - invariant potential defined using a flat reference metric @xmath67 . for small @xmath68 it reduces to the fierz - pauli mass term @xcite [ fp1 ] u^(2)= ( h^2-h_ab^2 ) . where @xmath69 .",
    "the lorentz - invariance of @xmath66 can be enforced by requiring that @xmath66 be a symmetric function of the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath70 .",
    "the fierz - pauli term is special because it is the unique quadratic expression that is linear in the perturbations of the adm lapse function @xmath71 .",
    "so as in general relativity , @xmath72 remains a lagrange multiplier and the theory describes five dynamical degrees of freedom at quadratic level .",
    "rather obviously in the hindsight , this will no longer be the case beyond the quadratic level for a generic @xmath66 , as boulware and deser pointed out @xcite .",
    "this results in a sixth degree of freedom which they showed to be a ghost .",
    "this problem has been solved by de rham , gabadadze , and tolley @xcite who found a particular two - parameter family of potentials which propagates just five degrees of freedom at all orders . a concise representation of the family is @xcite [ fp2 ] u=_a_b+_2_a_b_c+_3_0_1_2_3 , where the sums are over all all - distinct pairs and triples of indices , and @xmath73 are the four eigenvalues of the matrix [ 1-h ] ^a_b - .",
    "it is easy to understand why this two - parameter family , which we henceforth refer to as fp2 , is special . restricting to metrics with zero shift vector , the lapse appears only in @xmath74 .",
    "apparently , the expression is the only symmetric combination of @xmath75 , such that @xmath76 has zero cosmological constant , and is linear in @xmath72 .",
    "the full proof of the absence of boulware - deser ghost is given by hassan and rosen @xcite ( see also @xcite for a different approach ) .",
    "as formulated above , the fp theory is not generally covariant .",
    "however , it can be made so by introducing 4 non - canonical scalar fields @xcite to write @xmath77 as [ h ] h^a_b=_bcg^_^a_^c .",
    "in the so - called unitary gauge , one uses these scalar fields as coordinates , @xmath78 , and recovers the original formulation of the fp theory . in the unitary gauge , the theory is still invariant under simultaneous reparametrization of @xmath79 and @xmath67 . for our purposes  studying spherically symmetrical stars and black holes  we transform to spherical coordinates",

    "the linearized field of a point source is known ( and shown in  [ lin ] ) to exhibit the yukawa decay @xmath107 in massive gravity .",
    "it follows that the invariant adm mass of any localized system is zero .",
    "therefore , the mass term , taken to the right hand side of the einstein equation , can be thought of as the stress tensor of screening matter with negative energy that surrounds and degravitates gravitational sources . when a black hole forms , the screening matter flows inside and diminishes the black hole mass .",
    "the rate of this process is estimated by requiring the near horizon energy density @xmath108 accrete with the speed of light through an area of order @xmath109 : [ rgdot ] r_g~-m^2r_g^2 , where for a mass @xmath110 black hole @xmath111 in our unites .",
    "note that when @xmath112 the associated scale @xmath113 is much longer than other length scales in the problem .",
    "we will use this fact to find approximate time - dependent solutions in the next section .    assuming that the time - dependence is mild , of order",

    "next replace @xmath115 by @xmath86 via the einstein equation , as we did to find the constraint , and use the same arguments to find g_01(t_00-g_00)~m^2 r_g^2/r^2 .",
    "since @xmath91 as @xmath116 and @xmath117 , we get @xmath118 .",

    "this expectation will be confirmed by the calculation of the next section .",
    "it is relatively easy to find exact time - dependent solutions in the linear regime , but this is not the case at non - linear level .",
    "we therefore break the problem into three parts : first , we find the exact linear solutions and show that they are characterized by two parameters , the mass @xmath5 and the disappearance rate @xmath119 .",

    "the analogous case of the accretion of superluminal fluids and possible explanations of this result are discussed in the following section  [ fate ] .      to study the linearized system , we parametrize the metric as ds^2= ( 1+c)dt^2 - 2d dt dr -(1+a ) dr^2 - ( 1+b ) r^2 d^2 , where @xmath120 are infinitesimal functions of @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",

    "we see that , apart from allowing small non - zero @xmath114 , the time - dependence is inconsequential in the long - distance linear field .. to lose its hair , the black hole must actually lose its entire mass , which is done only very slowly .",

    "similar to massive electrodynamics , we can develop an approximate method to find the short distance ( @xmath135 ) quasi - stationary solutions in the limit @xmath112 .",
    "this approximation is in fact a generalization of the vainshtein s original idea @xcite , which we now review and extend to our case .",
    "aiming for a static solution , vainshtein started from a diagonal metric ansatz [ unit ] ds^2=c dt^2-a dr^2 -br^2 d^2 , where @xmath136 are functions of @xmath81 , and are determined using the einstein equations [ einstein1 ] g^_=t^_. he noticed that @xmath137 is proportional to @xmath138 and therefore can be ignored at short radii , as long as the metric coefficients remain finite .",
    "therefore , the mass - less einstein theory of gravity is recovered in this limit , implying that the metric must be a reparametrization of the schwarzschild metric [ sch ] ds^2=(1-)dt^2-(1-)^-1dr^2-r^2 d^2 .",
    "the reparametrization is determined from the covariant divergence of eq .",
    ": [ dt1 ] _",
    "t^_=0 , which can be thought of as a gauge condition on the metric .",
    "note that @xmath0 drops out of this equation , so it is a non - trivial constraint even in the zero - graviton - mass limit .",
    "requirement of asymptotic flatness ( @xmath139 as @xmath93 ) then fixes @xmath140 , and the only non - trivial component of eq .",
    "( the @xmath141 component ) serves as an equation for @xmath142 , in terms of which @xmath136 are given by c=1-,a = 1/(cr^2),b = r^2/r^2 .",
    "vainshtein realized that while there is no such reparametrization of the schwarzschild metric at the linearized level ( the well - known vdvz discontinuity ) , linearization becomes inadequate at @xmath143 .",
    "he showed that at the non - linear level there exists a finite solution valid for @xmath144 , which a posteriori justifies neglecting @xmath137 from the einstein equation .",
    "one still needs to check whether this solution matches the vdvz solution for @xmath145 , where the mass term can not be ignored anymore .",
    "this is a non - trivial check , but there exists a sub - family of fp2 for which the answer is positive @xcite ( see @xcite for earlier works , and @xcite for a related discussion ) .",
    "returning to the time - dependent problem , we expect that , as in massive electrodynamics where for small @xmath48 the only relevant effect of the time - dependence was to excite @xmath24 , here the time - dependence excites @xmath114 .",
    "once this is taken into account by using the metric ansatz [ u_metric ] ds^2=c dt^2 - 2d dt dr -a dr^2 - b r^2 d^2 , we can ignore time derivatives ( quasi - stationary approximation ) and repeat vainshtein s procedure .",
    "neglecting the stress tensor of the fp action from the einstein equation implies that the metric is a special reparametrization of the schwarzschild metric which satisfies the gauge condition @xmath146 .    in the quasi - stationary approximation ,",
    "the metric can be diagonalized and expressed in terms of @xmath82 and @xmath30 by the coordinate transformations r&=&b^-1/2r , + [ t ] t&=&t+dr , where @xmath147 . in this coordinate system",
    "the metric looks like ds^2 = c dt^2 -^2(a+d^2/c)dr^2-r^2d^2 . requiring this to match the schwarzschild metric gives [ ca ] c=1-r_g / r , a = c^-1(^-2-d^2 ) . hence , there are two unknowns @xmath148 and @xmath149 , characterizing the gauge transformation from the unitary frame to the schwarzschild frame .",
    "the task is to solve for them using the @xmath150 components of @xmath146 on a fixed schwarzschild geometry , and subject to appropriate boundary conditions .",
    "the resulting quasi - stationary solutions are expected to be parametrized by the mass @xmath5 and the disappearance rate @xmath151 ( which will be the integration constant of the @xmath152 equation ) .",
    "one must then ask for what values of @xmath131 the solution is regular at horizon.in the language of footnote [ t ] , one seeks solutions on which @xmath153 interpolates between @xmath105 at @xmath154 and @xmath155 at @xmath156 @xcite . ]    note that the above procedure is equivalent to solving the equations of motion for the scalar fields @xmath157 on a fixed schwarzschild background ( as one usually treats accretion problems @xcite ) . by spherical symmetry @xmath158 , and",
    "the stationary approximation corresponds to looking for solutions of the form @xmath159 [ which is related to @xmath149 and @xmath148 by eq . ] .",
    "this is why there are only two non - trivial equations ; they are related to the stress - energy conservation via the bianchi identity _",
    "t_^=-_^a , which is particularly simple in the unitary gauge where @xmath160 . neglecting the back - reaction on geometry",
    "is justified for small graviton mass if we find a regular solution .",
    "the details of the calculation for fp2 is given in appendix [ app - near ] .",
    "in summary , we obtain an algebraic equation for @xmath161 : [ b0 ] ( 1-)+(c_2+c_3_2)(1+(1-_2)c)=(c+)^1/2(1+c_2_2 + 2(c_2+c_3_2 ) ) , where @xmath162 are related to the parameters of fp2 action , and @xmath163 is a positive function when @xmath164 , the range where stable numerical time - independent solutions exist .",
    "given @xmath131 and @xmath5 , eq . is solved for @xmath165 , using which @xmath148 is given by and @xmath119 are fixed is a sign of the absence of boulware - deser ghost in fp2 . among the five degrees of freedom of a massive graviton",
    "only the scalar mode is dynamical in the spherically symmetric problem , and can participate in the accretion ( analogous to the longitudinal polarization of the massive photon and the sound mode of fluids ) .",
    "after the large-@xmath30 asymptotic condition is fixed by the mass @xmath5 ( charge @xmath49 for photon , asymptotic density for fluids ) , only one additional integration constant is needed to fully parametrize the stationary accretion . in generic fp ,",
    "on the other hand , the analogue of equation for @xmath149 is of the second order , which requires two extra integration constants .",
    "these correspond to the emergence of a second scalar degree of freedom , which is the boulware - deser ghost . ] [ d0 ] d=(^-1+c)(c+)^-1/2 .",
    "now we can estimate how much the time - dependent solutions deviate from the static solution .",
    "assuming @xmath166 , equation gives a small off - diagonal metric component at @xmath167 : d , and eq .",
    "reduces to its static @xmath168 limit , giving @xmath169 . therefore , as anticipated in  [ theorem ] the effects of time - dependence are felt merely within a distant of a few @xmath5 from the horizon , beyond which the static solution of @xcite remains accurate .",
    "in particular , matching to the linearized solution ( studied in appendix [ trans ] ) does not impose any constraint .",
    "this should not be very surprising in view of the fluid accretion problem . the critical radius that determines the accretion rate for fluids is close to the horizon for relativistic fluids .",
    "this is also what one expects from the example of massive electrodynamics where regularity of the horizon itself determines the accretion rate .",
    "what is the actual rate of accretion @xmath119 ? in massive electrodynamics , the discharge solution has been selected from the two - parametric @xmath170 family of quasi - stationary solutions by the horizon non - singularity .",
    "if massive gravity was fully analogous to electrodynamics , the rate @xmath119 would also be uniquely determined by the horizon non - singularity .",
    "but this does not actually happen . for @xmath171 ( and @xmath172 ) , eq .",
    "gives d=^-1+c(1-),= , and upon substitution in gives @xmath173 , which is regular at black hole horizon for any positive @xmath131 ( see footnote [ phi0 ] ) .",
    ", then negative values of @xmath131 are also admissible . in that case ,",
    "the black hole excretes negative energy ` aether ' and grows .",
    "] so in contrast to massive electrodynamics , any non - zero rate seems to result in a regular solution in massive gravity .",
    "this behavior , though peculiar , is not unprecedented .",
    "it is known @xcite ( and reviewed in appendix [ fluid ] ) that the accretion rate of fluids with superluminal speed of sound onto black holes is not unique . in the next section ,",
    "we examine the implications of this finding for the actual process of star collapse , where we argue that the rate is determined by the history of collapse .      in classical physics ,",
    "an outside observer never sees a fully formed black hole ",
    "collapsing stars are stuck forever at their gravitational radius with redshift increasing at their surface . in this section , we study black hole accretion from this perspective which , besides being more realistic , provides a useful thought laboratory to examine our analytic results .",
    "we first consider the accretion of fluids onto collapsing stars .",
    "we then give a related interpretation of black hole discharge in massive electrodynamics , and finally , turn to the problem of collapsing stars in massive gravity .",
    "ideal fluids are characterized by their density , pressure , and velocity fields , respectively @xmath174 , and @xmath175 , and a certain equation of state that relates @xmath176 and @xmath177 . the fluid stress - energy tensor is _",
    "= ( + p)u_u_- p g_. consider a spherically symmetric static solution on the schwarzschild metric ( we ignore the fluid back - reaction on geometry ) .",
    "the @xmath178 component of the stress - energy conservation , @xmath179 , gives p=(+p ) .",
    "assuming a simple @xmath180 equation of state , we get the density field [ density ] = _ 0 ( 1-)^-(1+c_s^-2)/2 , where @xmath181 is the density at spatial infinity .",
    "we see that for subluminal and superluminal fluids alike the density and pressure diverge at @xmath156 , reflecting the fact that an infinite force is needed to hold a test particle at rest above the horizon .",
    "however the two cases , subluminal and superluminal , are known to be very different when one consideres the black hole accretion . the rate of accretion is uniquely determined by the critical bondi solution in the subluminal case , @xmath182 , because accreting solutions with slower rates are singular at horizon , while solutions with faster rates do not exist . on the other hand , in the superluminal case ,",
    "when @xmath183 , the critical accretion rate does not exist and all accreting solutions are regular at horizon ( see appendix [ fluid ] ) .",
    "this difference is ultimately due to the different amounts of _ static _ fluid mass which can be stored near the black hole horizon .",
    "on schwarzschild metric , there is a well - defined notion of fluid mass since the @xmath184 component of the stress - energy conservation becomes @xmath185 and implies the conservation of [ m ] m = d^3x ^0_0 . at spatial infinity where the fluid is at rest and",
    "the metric is flat this reduces to @xmath186 .",
    "hence , @xmath110 is the fluid energy as measured by asymptotic observers .",
    "now consider a high redshift star of radius @xmath187 as a model for the black hole .",
    "using the static solution , it is easy to see that when @xmath188 the fluid mass near the star surface diverges as @xmath189 , while it remains finite for @xmath183 ( figure [ stat ] ) .",
    "imagine next initiating the fluid accretion by contracting the star ( classically , @xmath187 will pass the horizon only at @xmath190 , no matter how fast the contraction takes place , so the accretion problem can be fully addressed in this framework ) .",
    "when @xmath188 , the above - mentioned divergence of near - horizon fluid mass makes it possible to sustain an infinitesimal rate of steady accretion by adiabatically contracting the star . the pressure and density in this regime",
    "are then approximately given by the singular static solution .",
    "this explains the singularity of those sub - critical accreting solutions .",
    "in contrast , because of the finiteness of near - horizon @xmath110 in the @xmath183 case , it is impossible to sustain any steady accretion by adiabatic contraction of the star .",
    "consequently , the accreting solutions of superluminal fluids can never be approximated by the singular static solution near the horizon .    without an explicit calculation of fluid accretion",
    "we can not proceed much further .",
    "so in the following , besides filling in some of the details of the above picture , we use the results of appendix [ fluid ] to provide a more comprehensive description .",
    "let us define @xmath191 in terms of which the @xmath192 part of the near - horizon schwarzschild geometry is given by the rindler metric : ds^2=r_g^-1x dt^2-r_g x^-1dx^2 .",
    "for a radially moving time - like curve near the horizon , we have x^2=r_g^-2x^2(1-r_g^-1x e^-2 ) , where the overdot denotes @xmath82-derivative , and @xmath193 is the energy per unit rest mass as measured from infinity .",
    "@xmath194 is constant for free - falling observers , but it vanishes as @xmath195 for static ones .",
    "thus , the maximal value of @xmath196 near the horizon is @xmath197 .    as a function of the position of the star surface @xmath198 , the mass of static fluid with density that resides near the surface scales as x_0^(1-c_s^-2)/2 .",
    "when @xmath199 , this diverges in the limit @xmath200 and , as explained above , infinitesimal rates of steady accretion can be obtained by adiabatically decreasing @xmath201 : [ mdot ] m= -4r_g^2 x_0 , with @xmath176 given by . as @xmath202",
    "is increased to the point that this rate exceeds the critical bondi rate , the fluid dynamics decouples from the motion of the surface and settles to the regular bondi solution .    on the other hand ,",
    "when @xmath183 substituting the maximal value @xmath203 in eq .",
    "gives zero as @xmath200 .",
    "thus , similar adiabatic contractions do not correspond to any steady accretion for superluminal fluids .",
    "this result may seem rather counterintuitive as it suggests that steady accretion is impossible when @xmath183 .",
    "this is of course not the case .",
    "consider again the near horizon contribution to @xmath110 for a possibly moving fluid : m(x_0)~4r_g^2_x_0 dx[(+p)r_g e^2x^-1-p ] , where the expression in the square brackets is @xmath204 for a fluid with @xmath205 .",
    "substituting the infinitely redshifted @xmath195 for a static fluid , we see that the density of superluminal fluids is not singular enough and the integral converges as @xmath200 .",
    "however , if the same fluid is allowed to fall in , with @xmath206 at @xmath207 , even with a finite @xmath176 and @xmath177 an infinite amount of mass can be deposited near the horizon . the flux ^1_0=(+p)r_g",
    "e^2 x^-1 x , would then be non - zero .",
    "the explicit solution of appendix [ fluid ] shows that any non - zero accretion rate of superluminal fluids can indeed be obtained by a specific choice of @xmath194 at horizon .",
    "so different free - fall ( @xmath208 ) motions of the star surface at horizon lead to different rates of accretion , implying that unlike subluminal fluids the accretion of a superluminal fluid never decouples from the star collapse .",
    "moreover , since even for infinitesimal accretion rates the fluid is free - falling at horizon , it is expected that the pressure remains finite there .",
    "given that at any finite @xmath82 all of the accreted matter is still above the horizon , one may wonder what happens if the contraction of the star is paused after a long period @xmath209 of steady accretion .",
    "clearly the static solution must be recovered since the star surface is at a finite redshift .",
    "the finiteness of the near horizon static fluid mass when @xmath183 then implies that , for large enough @xmath209 , the star must excrete most of the fluid that has been accumulated near the surface back to larger radii .    finally , when @xmath210 the total mass of static fluid adjacent to the surface diverges logarithmically with @xmath201 .",
    "therefore , in the adiabatic approximation even infinitesimal rates require very fast motion ( @xmath211 , although with @xmath212 ) which makes this approximation unreliable .",
    "a more detailed analysis is needed to show the singularity of sub - critical accreting solutions in this case .",
    "now let us interpret the black hole discharge in massive electrodynamics by considering a charged shell of radius @xmath187 approaching its gravitational radius @xmath5 .",
    "we first need to determine the relation between the asymptotic field @xmath213 and the actual charge @xmath214 on the shell as a function of @xmath187 .",
    "this can be obtained from the discontinuity of the electric field at the surface in the following way ( a more detailed analysis can be found in @xcite ) :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ ignoring back - reaction on geometry , and substituting @xmath215 in the source - free proca equation , we get for @xmath216  = m^2(1-)^-1 . for small @xmath48 ,",

    "this is due to the divergence of the total amount of screening charge both inside and outside of the shell , respectively as @xmath222 and @xmath223 . in the realistic problem , as a star of fixed charge @xmath214 contracts to smaller radii , its asymptotic field diminishes since the surrounding screening charges accrete into the now deeper potential well around and inside the star .    as in the case of subluminal fluids",
    "the divergence of total static charge in the limit @xmath200 allows us to reproduce small rates of accretion by slowly contracting the shell : q = - x_0q m^2 r_g^5/2 x_0 ^ -3/2x_0 .",
    "however , here the screening charges do penetrate inside the shell and the slow motion of the surface does not imply that of the charges .",
    "in fact , the logarithmic divergence of charge density outside the shell makes this case analogous to fluids with @xmath224 , and a detailed analysis is needed to show why discharge rates of less than @xmath225 lead to a singular horizon .",
    "as the shell collapses faster , the outside field eventually decouples from the motion of the shell and decays via the discharge mode .      for static black holes in massive gravity ,",
    "we show in appendix [ stress ] that while pressure usually diverges at the horizon , the energy density always remains finite in fp2 , and so does the total amount of static energy that can be stored outside the horizon . therefore , as in the case of superluminal fluids",
    ", to have any non - zero rate of accretion the surrounding screening matter should freely fall at horizon and hence the pressure is expected to remain finite .",
    "this seems to be the reason for the non - uniqueness of the disappearance rate .",
    "the rate will then depend on the motion of the collapsing star according to one of the following scenarios :    \\i ) if the total amount of negative energy inside static stars diverges with their redshift ( similar to the divergence of total screening charge in the interior of the charged shell in massive electrodynamics ) , then by slowly contracting the star to higher redshifts we obtain arbitrary rates of accretion .",
    "this implies that the gravitational radius @xmath5 ( which is approximately the actual radius of the star ) shrinks as the redshift increases , and the perceived mass of the star decreases . in this case",
    "if the process of collapse is paused at some point the result will be a static star of smaller gravitational radius .",
    "\\ii ) otherwise , as in the case of impenetrable stars surrounded by superluminal fluids , non - zero accretion rates are obtained when the surface freely falls which allows for the accumulation of an arbitrary amount of free - falling screening matter .",
    "as before , the gravitational radius ( and the real radius ) of the system shrinks in this process .",
    "however , if we decide to pause the collapse , the excess of screening matter must return to larger radii , resulting in an excreting star with ever increasing surface redshift .",
    "we were unable to find high redshift static star solutions in fp2 to decide between the two scenarios .",
    "nevertheless , in both cases as the star shrinks to very small radii the quantum mechanical effects become important and the above description in terms of stars breaks down .",
    "the resulting small mass black hole will probably evaporate via hawking radiation .",
    "let us conclude by a discussion of global energy in asymptotically flat solutions of massive gravity .",
    "we have already seen that the invariant adm mass of a localized system trivially vanishes in massive gravity because of the yukawa screening .",
    "equivalently , if one defines an ordinarily conserved pseudo - tensor of stress and energy , say @xmath226 , the conserved total energy - momentum four - vector of the system which is obtained by integrating @xmath227 over the whole space is always zero . intuitively , the negative contribution of @xmath87 cancels the energy and momentum of the ` matter content ' , by which we mean everything except @xmath87 .",
    "of course , on a curved space - time these different contributions are not separately conserved , and seemingly , nothing forbids the growth or disappearance of the matter content at the expense of the growth and disappearance of the fp content .",
    "however , there exist four noether charges , associated with four global symmetries of the fierz - pauli theory , which as we will see are closely related to the negative energy - momentum of @xmath87 . as such , they are also a well - defined measure of the matter - content of the theory .",
    "the conservation of these charges , then , constrain processes that involve stars , but they can be violated in the presence of black holes .    the prescription to make @xmath87 covariant , also introduces four global symmetries under constant shifts of the scalar fields @xmath157 . therefore , there are four conserved noether currents obtained by varying @xmath87 with respect to @xmath228 j^_a= , and associated to them , there will be four conserved charges @xmath229 .",

    "we will show that the integral on the left coincides with the volume integral of @xmath355 in the same region of space , which is what one expects if @xmath236 is a good characterization of the energy of @xmath87 :    since for @xmath167 the unitary - gauge metric is approximately diagonal ( even if there is time - dependence ) , we have @xmath356 and @xmath357 , so @xmath355 and @xmath358 can be replaced with the unitary - gauge expressions @xmath359 and @xmath298 . from we have ( after redefining @xmath360 ) j^0_0= t^0_0-u , and the above requirement on @xmath236 implies [ intu ] ^_r_1r_gdr r^2 u r_g .",

    "moreover , in this region @xmath369 , and the expression for @xmath286 can be approximated as [ approxl1 ] _1(_2r) , while @xmath370 and its derivatives can be neglected .",

    "r^2 u = r^3(u - r_2)|_r_1^r_2 .",
    "but @xmath338 is in the linear regime where @xmath371 , and hence the right hand side which is quadratic in @xmath372 is negligible at the upper limit . at the lower limit , since @xmath373 , @xmath374 , and @xmath375 , we get the desired relation .    for a star of finite redshift all eigenvalues @xmath372 remain finite and",
    "the contribution of the region @xmath376 to @xmath236 , which is of order @xmath377 , is much less than @xmath5 .",

    "_ = 2 p_x _ _ -g _ p , where @xmath381 .",
    "we can therefore identify the fluid pressure @xmath177 , energy density @xmath176 , and velocity @xmath382 as p = p , = 2 p_x x -p , u_=_/. the @xmath180 equation of state , therefore , corresponds to p = x^n , n=.      for static spherically symmetric fluids with asymptotic density @xmath181 , we have @xmath383 , with @xmath384 , which on schwarzschild geometry gives the singular at horizon solution . to have an accreting solution we take @xmath385 .",
