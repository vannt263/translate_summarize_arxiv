    "<S> in this paper we investigate the nature of quantum phase transitions between 2d dirac semimetals and @xmath0-ordered phases ( e.g. kekule valence - bond solid ) , where cubic terms of the order parameter are allowed in the quantum landau - ginzberg theory and the transitions are putatively first - order . from large-@xmath1 rg analysis , we find that fermion - induced quantum critical points ( fiqcps ) , which are type - ii landau - forbidden transitions introduced in arxiv:1512.07908 , occur when @xmath1 ( the number of flavors of 4-component dirac fermions ) is larger than a critical value @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , from the knowledge of spacetime supersymmetry , we obtain an _ exact _ lower bound for @xmath2 , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ , @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> ( here `` 1/2 '' flavor of 4-component dirac fermions is equivalent to one flavor of 4-component majorana fermions ) . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we show that the emergence of two length scales is a typical phenomenon of fiqcp and obtain two different critical exponents , e.g. @xmath4@xmath5@xmath6 , by large-@xmath1 rg calculations . we further give a brief discussion on possible experimental realizations of fiqcp . </S>"
