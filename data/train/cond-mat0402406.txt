    "there is a surprisingly large number of systems that exhibit macroscopic textures arising from microscopic interactions .",
    "@xcite to be concrete , i will take as a case of study that of patterns in magnetic systems ( magnetic garnets@xcite or ferrofluids@xcite ) , but many of the conclusions obtained can be directly applied to other systems , as for instance , the mixed state of type i superconductors of slab geometry,@xcite and langmuir monolayers.@xcite the phenomenology of these systems is qualitatively understood as appearing from the competition of two effects : a short range rigidity , and a long range ( dipolar ) interaction between the local magnetization at different spatial positions .",
    "calculations suggest @xcite that the ground state of the system consists of ( i ) a state of uniform magnetization , ( ii ) a hexagonal lattice of bubbles in a background with opposite magnetization , or ( iii ) a phase with alternating , parallel stripes of opposite magnetization .",
    "the parameter controlling which of these three is actually the ground state is the external magnetic field .",
    "however , in experiments , upon variation of the external field , different ( typically metastable ) flux configuration develop that originate in instabilities of the bubbles or the stripes .",
    "most noticeable , these metastable configurations include labyrinthine phases of interpenetrating domains , and polygonal - like patterns.@xcite    model hamiltonians that take into account the two relevant energy scales have been used to reproduce most of the elemental instabilities observed in experiments , in particular : the elongation and ` fingering ' instability of bubbles,@xcite and the undulation instability of stripes.@xcite however , the much richer behavior of the full system , appearing from complex interaction effects in rather large spatial regions has not been studied in detail with this kind of models .",
    "in fact , it is not known if these simple models contain all necessary ingredients to produce realistic magnetization patterns over large spatial scales .",
    "the main motivation of the present work is to present large scale simulations using a model hamiltonian to see whether it can account for the full phenomenology and the variety of morphologies observed .",
    "i claim that the answer is positive .",
    "the simulations are able to reproduce , in particular , two phenomena that have been observed in these systems and have remained largely as puzzles , namely , the so called ` memory effect'@xcite of some magnetic patterns , and the ` topological melting'@xcite of an ordered lattice of bubbles .",
    "the model i will use is not at all new ( see [ 1 ] , [ 11 ] and references therein ) . i will consider a scalar field @xmath0 defined over the @xmath1-@xmath2 plane .",
    "this variable will represent the magnetization in the system , that in experiments is typically constrained ( because of structural properties ) to point perpendicularly to the @xmath1-@xmath2 plane .",
    "then , experimentally , the magnetization @xmath3 has a preference to take two different values , that without loose of generality i will assume to be @xmath4",
    ". it will be convenient for the simulations to consider @xmath3 as a continuum variable and include in the hamiltonian a local term @xmath5 that favors the values @xmath6 .",
    "this term will be of the form @xmath7 and represents the simplest continuum field description of an ising variable .",
    "note that a term describing the effect of an external magnetic field @xmath8 has been already included .",
    "the other terms that will be included in the hamiltonian are the following .",
    "first , there is a rigidity term @xmath9 of the form @xmath10 this term ( with positive @xmath11 ) discourages spatial variations of @xmath3 , and can be called ` attractive ' , in the sense that two regions with a value of @xmath3 of plus ( or minus ) one , in a background of the opposite sign , tend to merge into a single one to reduce the value of this term ( in fact , in a description in terms of an ising variable on a lattice , this term maps onto a ferromagnetic interaction between nearest neighbor sites ) .",
    "the fact that our fundamental variable @xmath3 is continuous rather than discrete , and the existence of the gradient term , imply in particular the existence of a natural width ( of the order of @xmath12 ) for the interface between domains with positive and negative magnetization . choosing the parameters in such a way that this width is a few times the discretization distance in the simulation , allows to obtain a smooth interface between domains , which turns out to be very weakly pinned by the underlying numerical mesh , and",
    "whose energy is almost independent of its spatial orientation .",
    "these two facts are crucial for a realistic simulation , and can not be easily achieved using a ising variable that takes only two values ( see for instances the attempts in [ 12]).@xcite    secondly , there is a term @xmath13 that models the dipolar interactions , of the form @xmath14 where @xmath15 at long distances . at short distances",
    "however , the @xmath16 behavior has to be cut off to avoid divergences ( in experiments , the cut off distance is given roughly by the thickness of the film ) .",
    "however , we can see that the way in which the cut off is done is not crucial for the results .",
    "in fact , we will take advantage of the fact that the two terms ( [ atrac ] ) and ( [ repul ] ) can be compactly written in fourier space as    @xmath17    where @xmath18 is the fourier transform of @xmath19 .",
    "thus , it is the combination @xmath20 that will mostly determine the behavior of the system .",
    "note that the short distance behavior of @xmath21 in real space is masked in fourier space at large @xmath22 by the @xmath23 term , and then is irrelevant . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath16 behavior at long distances transforms into a @xmath22 dependence of the form @xmath24 the constants can be exactly evaluated to be @xmath25 the finite value @xmath26 of @xmath18 at @xmath27 reflects the fact that the interaction in real space is integrable ( in spite of being sometimes called ` long range ' ) .",
    "also note that @xmath28 is independent of the short distance behavior of @xmath29 .",
    "the main features of the interaction in fourier space are the maximum with finite derivative at @xmath30 , and the minimum at a finite wave number @xmath31 .",
    "this minimum exists for any non - zero @xmath32 , indicating that the effect of the dipolar interactions on large distances can never be neglected .    we have defined the energy function of the system , and now the dynamics has to be introduced .",
    "since in magnetic systems the magnetization is a non - conserved order parameter , i will use the allen - cahn@xcite dynamical equations , namely    @xmath33    that represents an overdamped dynamics in which the system reduces its energy by a steepest descendant evolution . to efficiently implement these equations on the computer , and in order to avoid the direct evaluation of the integral in the last term of ( [ ecreal ] )",
    ", a pseudo - spectral method@xcite is used .",
    "i write the previous equation in fourier space , namely @xmath34 \\label{ecfourier}\\ ] ] in this way , the last term is now algebraic .",
    "the complication has been translated to the first term , that involves the evaluation of the fourier transform of @xmath35 . however , this can be done very efficiently by the use of standard fast - fourier - transform techniques .    in the simulations below ,",
    "the function @xmath21 is defined in real space to be @xmath36 for any two points of the numerical mesh such that @xmath37 , whereas @xmath38 . then the cut off distance is the lattice discretization .",
    "the fourier transform of this expression on the square lattice gives for the relevant terms of @xmath18 the form of eq .",
    "( [ gdek ] ) with @xmath39 , @xmath40 . once the value of @xmath26 is fixed ( and since the value of @xmath28 is universal ) ,",
    "there are four independent coefficients in ( [ ecfourier ] ) .",
    "two of them can be fixed by rescaling the spatial and temporal coordinates .",
    "in fact , if we define a new field @xmath41 ( and then @xmath42 ) , and in case we choose @xmath43 to be @xmath44 the new field satisfies equations of motion that in fourier space can be written as ( the tilde in the new field has been eliminated for simplicity ) :    @xmath45    with @xmath46 and where @xmath18 is ( up to the linear terms that are relevant for our analysis ) the same function as before , namely @xmath47 with the same @xmath26 and @xmath28 .",
    "this renormalization can be used to fix two parameters in the new non - dimensional equations ( [ ecfourier2 ] ) . in the simulation presented below",
    "i have fixed @xmath48 , @xmath49 and took the spatial discretization to be the unit of length ( this choice was convenient when implementing the equations on the numerical mesh , and have no other particular meaning ) .",
    "therefore , we see that in addition to the external control parameter @xmath50 , a single internal control parameter @xmath51 remains .",
    "this parameter regulates the possibility of the field @xmath3 to take values others than the most convenient ones , namely @xmath6 .",
    "we will see below the different morphologies that appear for different values of @xmath51 .",
    "from now on i will always refer to the non - dimensional form ( [ ecfourier2 ] ) of the equations of motion .",
    "starting from an arbitrary initial condition , eq .",
    "( [ ecfourier2 ] ) describes an evolution in which the total energy of the system @xmath52 is steadily reduced until it reaches a minimum , in which @xmath53 is identically zero .",
    "we will see that typically the true minimum of the system is not reached , but instead one of many possible metastable states is obtained .",
    "the simulations presented below were done on a 512 @xmath54 512 mesh using periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the time - integration of the equations is done using a semi - implicit first order method , in which the @xmath23 term in eq .",
    "( [ ecfourier2 ] ) is evaluated in the new time value .",
    "concretely , i use an iteration scheme based on the following discretized form of ( [ ecfourier2 ] ) @xmath55 this treatment of the diffusive term is standard to improve the stability of the algorithm.@xcite in all cases below the time interval used is @xmath56 .",
    "the initial condition for the variable @xmath3 is taken to be locally random in the interval @xmath57 , and the system is evolved during an equilibration time @xmath58 in the presence of a fixed applied external field @xmath59 .",
    "if @xmath59 is too large , the configuration obtained turns out to be a state of uniform magnetization .",

    "summarizing , in the previous section i have shown how the model equations ( [ ecfourier2 ] ) can be efficiently simulated in systems of reasonably large size . in this way , we have seen emerging most of the phenomenology of two dimensional magnetic patterns and other similar systems .",
    "the success of the present numerical simulations are due to a combination of reasons , mainly : the use of a continuum variable instead of a discrete one to obtain smooth domain walls between regions with opposite values of @xmath3 , and the use of pseudo - spectral techniques to evaluate efficiently the ` long - range ' dipolar force .",
    "these facts combine to allow a realistic simulation of domain patterns that show many of the features observed in experimental realizations .",
    "in particular , the _ memory effect_@xcite and the _",
    "topological melting_@xcite of the system are very well reproduced .",
    "i want to emphasize that in all cases i have studied , the evaluation of the total energy of the system is compatible with the fact that the only patterns truly corresponding to the ground state of the system are : ( i ) a pattern with uniform magnetization if the field is strong enough , ( ii ) a regular bubble phase for intermediate fields , and ( iii ) a regular stripe phase for low ( including zero ) field .",
    "although this is not a demonstration that they are the only possible ground states , it points in this direction , and it is in agreement with the results of theoretical studies.@xcite the other patterns observed ( labyrinthine , polygonal , etc . )",
    "are seen to be metastable , and they are originated in the particular cycling of the field ( and in the initial conditions ) to which the sample is subjected .",
    "a recent experimental study@xcite has shown in fact how the labyrinthine patterns converge to parallel stripes upon relaxation .",
    "very different morphologies have been observed when the parameter @xmath51 in eq .",
    "( [ ecfourier2 ] ) is changed .",
    "[ f5 ] , [ f5b ] , and [ memory ] ( corresponding to the largest values of @xmath51 ) compare very well with the patterns observed in magnetic garnets and ferrofluids ( see [ 1 ] , [ 10 ] , and [ 11 ] ) .",
    "the results for lower @xmath51 ( in particular , figs .",
    "[ f1 ] and [ f2 ] ) are more akin to langmuir monolayers@xcite and flux structures in type i superconductors.@xcite this suggests that in real systems the possibility of the order parameter to take values different than the two preferred ones can influence noticeable the physical properties .",
    "i want to mention here that the present model can be also efficiently used to study the effect of quenched disorder in the system , and the effect of thermal fluctuations .",
    "preliminar results indicate that the model generates hysteresis curves and magnetization patterns that , as a function of the amount of disorder , compare very well with experimental ones@xcite .",
    "these results will be published separately .",
    "we have seen that in the present model the dynamics is controlled by an interaction function in @xmath22 space that has a maximum with finite derivative at @xmath30 and a minimum at a finite @xmath83 value .",
    "it is worth comparing this case with respect to other possibilities .",
    "one is the case in which the field @xmath3 is considered to be charged , instead of carrying a dipole .",
    "two cases can be considered .",
    "one is that of true three dimensional charges ( @xmath84 ) and the other is the case of two dimensional charges ( @xmath85 ) . in both cases , the interaction in @xmath22 space",
    "gets a divergence at low @xmath22 .",
    "this model has been studied in detail in [ 17 ] ( see the references in there for realizations of this case ) .",
    "there , instabilities of a single bubble have been found which are similar to those i find in the dipolar system .",
    "it remains to be seen if the other effects described here are also present in coulombic systems .",
    "another case to compare with is that of interactions decaying in real space more rapidly than @xmath16 . in this case , a @xmath22 space interaction with a quadratic maximum at @xmath27 is obtained . if this maximum dominates over the quadratic minimum coming from the @xmath86 term in eq .",
    "( [ ecreal ] ) , then the effective interaction has a quadratic maximum at the origin and a minimum at some finite @xmath83 .",
    "this case corresponds qualitatively to the interaction considered in the swift - hohenberg equation.@xcite for this interaction , and controlling the same parameter @xmath51 as i did here , i have obtained basically all the effects and morphologies described in the previous section .",
    "on one hand this tells that the singularity at @xmath27 of the dipolar interaction is not crucial in obtaining these effects , a quadratic maximum suffices . on the other hand",
    "it is a bit surprising that in the wide literature related to the swift - hohenberg equation these effects have not been described previously .",
    "this might be due to the fact that the swift - hohenberg equation is usually considered in the absence of a ` magnetic - field - like ' term that favors one of the two orientations , and this term is crucial to obtain the metastable patterns .",
    "it is then likely that the much studied relaxation to equilibrium properties of the patterns seen in the swift - hohenberg equation and the coarsening properties of the magnetic patterns ( studied for instance in [ 9 ] ) can be put under the same framework .",
    "i hope the present work encourages some studies in this direction .",
