    "the role of vacuum energy in cosmology has acquired a renewed importance , with current observations pointing to the existence of a negative - pressure component in the cosmic fluid .",
    "this has reinforced the cosmological constant problem @xcite , whose origin can be understood if we write the energy density associated to vacuum quantum fluctuations . in the case of a massless scalar field",
    ", it is given by the divergent integral @xmath3    this integral can be regularized by imposing a cutoff @xmath4 in the superior limit of integration , leading to @xmath5 .",
    "the same result can be derived by introducing a bosonic distribution function in ( [ lambdanua ] ) , @xmath6 which is equivalent to consider the vacuum fluctuations thermally distributed , at a characteristic energy @xmath4 .    for a cutoff of the order of the planck mass ,",
    "this leads to a vacuum density @xmath7 orders of magnitude above the currently observed dark energy density .",
    "one may argue that @xmath4 should in fact be much smaller , because vacuum fluctuations above the energy scale of the qcd phase transition - the latest cosmological vacuum transition - would lead to quark deconfinement .",
    "however , even with this value for @xmath4 , we obtain a vacuum density @xmath8 orders of magnitude above the observed value .",
    "the cosmological constant problem may be alleviated by the following reasoning .",
    "the above energy density is obtained in a flat spacetime , but in such a background the energy - momentum tensor in einstein equations should be zero .",
    "therefore , by consistence , the above vacuum density must be exactly canceled by a bare cosmological constant .",
    "if we now derive the vacuum contribution in a curved spacetime , we should expect , after the subtraction of the bare cosmological constant , a renormalized , curvature - dependent vacuum energy density .",
    "for instance , in the case of an expanding , spatially isotropic and homogeneous spacetime , filled with vacuum and matter components , the renormalized @xmath2 should be time dependent , being very high at early times , but decreasing to zero or nearly zero as the universe expands @xcite .    to have an idea of what a varying cosmological term may be ,",
    "let us initially consider the case of a de sitter spacetime .",
    "it is generally believed that the de sitter cosmological horizon has an associated temperature given by @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the hubble parameter @xcite .",
    "therefore , a phenomenological expression for the effective vacuum density in this case may be derived by substituting @xmath11 for the energy scale @xmath4 in ( [ lambdareg ] ) , with a subsequent subtraction of @xmath12 . in this way",
    "we obtain @xmath13    in the limit @xmath14 , this leads to the cutoff - independent result @xmath15 .",
    "since , in a de sitter spacetime , @xmath16 , this implies that @xmath0 , that is , this limit necessarily describes a de sitter universe with horizon radius of the order of the planck length . on the other hand , in the limit @xmath17 we have @xmath18 . using again @xmath16",
    ", we obtain @xmath19 , or @xmath20 .",
    "if , as discussed above , we choose @xmath4 as the energy scale of the qcd vacuum phase transition ( of the order of the pion mass ) , the first result is an expression of dirac s large number coincidence @xcite , while the last one gives approximately the current observed value of @xmath2 @xcite .    the above discussion concerns stationary spacetimes , for which @xmath1 and @xmath2 are truly constants .",
    "nevertheless , it suggests the possibility of a universe evolving from an initial , asymptotically de sitter phase , with @xmath21 , to a final , asymptotically de sitter phase with @xmath22 , with @xmath2 decreasing with time according to ( [ lambda ] ) . before verifying such a possibility in the following sections ,",
    "let us briefly discuss the energy conservation in this context .",
    "there is a common belief about the impossibility of a varying cosmological term , because of the bianchi identities and the covariant conservation of the energy - momentum of matter .",
    "indeed , the bianchi identities @xmath23 ( @xmath24 is the einstein tensor ) imply , via einstein s equations , the conservation of the total energy - momentum tensor , @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the energy - momentum tensor of matter .",
    "if one assumes the independent conservation of matter , i.e. , @xmath27 , it follows that @xmath28 , that is , @xmath2 is a constant .",
    "however , if matter is not independently conserved , @xmath2 may vary with time @xcite . in the realm of a frw spacetime",
    ", the conservation of the total energy - momentum tensor reduces to the form @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the total energy density and pressure , respectively . by using @xmath32 and @xmath33 (",
    "@xmath34 and @xmath35 refer to the corresponding matter quantities ) , we have @xmath36 in other words , the vacuum decay is concomitant with a process of matter production , in order to preserve the covariant conservation of the total energy .",
    "in the spatially flat case , the friedmann equations give @xmath37 . in the limit of very early times we can take @xmath14 , and ( [ lambda ] ) reduces to @xmath38 , where the factor @xmath39 is not important and was chosen for mathematical convenience . using for matter the equation of state of radiation , @xmath40 ,",
    "the conservation equation ( [ continuidade2 ] ) then leads to the evolution equation @xmath41    for @xmath42 , the solution of ( [ evolucao ] ) is given by @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the cosmological time , and an integration constant was conveniently chosen .",
    "this solution is plotted in figure 1 , with @xmath44 and @xmath1 expressed in planck units .",
    "we can see that this universe has no initial singularity , existing since an infinite past , when it approaches asymptotically a de sitter state with @xmath45 . during an infinitely long period we have a quasi - de sitter universe , with @xmath46 .",
    "however , at a given time ( arbitrarily chosen around @xmath47 ) , the expansion undertakes a fast and huge phase transition , with @xmath1 and @xmath2 decreasing to nearly zero in a few planck times ) .",
    "note , however , that it takes place a definite time before the present time . in this sense , we can attribute an age for the subsequent universe , which will be determined below . ] .    from @xmath48",
    "we can obtain @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the relative density of matter .",
    "its time variation is plotted in figure 2 .",
    "one can see that @xmath51 changes suddenly during the phase transition , from nearly zero , in the quasi - de sitter phase , to nearly @xmath52 at the end of the transition . in this way",
    ", the present solution has some attributes of an inflationary universe , with an infinitely long period of inflation ending in a fast transition during which the vacuum decays , releasing a huge amount of energy in form of radiation and relativistic matter .",
    "after the transition we have a radiation - dominated frw universe , whose subsequent evolution , as we will see , is similar to the standard @xmath2cdm recipe .",
    "in the opposite limit we can take @xmath17 , and ( [ lambda ] ) reduces to @xmath53 .",
    "let us write it as @xmath54 , with @xmath55 , and let us introduce the equation of state of matter , @xmath56 . from ( [ continuidade2 ] )",
    "we now have @xmath57    for @xmath58 and @xmath59 , one has the solution @xcite @xmath60^{\\frac{2}{3\\gamma}},\\ ] ] where @xmath61 is an integration constant , and a second one was conveniently chosen .    from it",
    "we can derive @xmath62 and , with the help of @xmath63 , we obtain @xmath64,\\ ] ] @xmath65.\\ ] ]      in the radiation phase , doing @xmath66 and taking the limit @xmath67 , we have @xmath68 @xmath69 and @xmath70    the two first results are the same we obtain in the standard model .",
    "the third one shows that , in this limit , @xmath2 is sub - dominant compared to @xmath34 , and , therefore , the matter production can be neglected .",
    "this is the reason why radiation is conserved , with an energy density scaling with @xmath71 .",
    "equations ( [ asmall ] ) and ( [ rhosmall ] ) guarantee that physical processes taking place during the radiation phase are not affected by the vacuum decay .",
    "for example , the primordial nucleosynthesis remains unchanged , since the expansion and reaction rates are the same as in the standard context .      in the case of a matter fluid dominated by dust , taking @xmath72 we obtain , from ( [ a ] ) , @xmath73^{2/3}.\\ ] ]    in the limit @xmath67 , it reduces to @xmath74 that is , the scale factor evolves as in a dust - dominated einstein - de sitter universe .    on the other hand , for @xmath75 we have @xmath76 i.e. , our solution tends asymptotically to a de sitter universe , with @xmath77 .    for the matter and vacuum energy densities ,",
    "we obtain , from ( [ rhoa ] ) and ( [ lambdaa ] ) , @xmath78 @xmath79    it is not difficult to interpret these results .",
    "the first terms in these equations are the standard expressions for the scaling of matter and the cosmological term , valid if there is no matter production .",
    "the first term of ( [ rhodust ] ) is dominant in the limit @xmath80 , when @xmath81 scales as in ( [ adustsmall ] ) .",
    "the first term of ( [ lambdadust ] ) , on the other hand , is dominant for @xmath82 , acting as a genuine cosmological constant .",
    "the second terms in ( [ rhodust ] ) and ( [ lambdadust ] ) are related to the vacuum decay . for large times",
    "the matter density decreases slower then in the @xmath2cdm model , because of the matter production .",
    "as we have seen , the cosmological scenario presented here is similar , on a qualitative level , to the standard scenario of cosmic evolution .",
    "nevertheless , the vacuum decay constitutes a substantial difference at late times , and we should verify its consequences for the quantitative determination of cosmological parameters like the relative density of matter and the universe age , for example . for this purpose , the analysis of the redshift - distance relation for supernovas ia is of particular importance @xcite .    from ( [ adust ] ) , it is easy to derive the hubble parameter as a function of the redshift @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is the present value of the scale factor .",
    "one obtains @xmath85,\\ ] ] where @xmath86 and @xmath51 are the present values of the hubble parameter and of the relative density of matter , respectively .",
    "one can see that , as in the @xmath2cdm model , we have two parameters to be adjusted by fitting the supernova data .",
    "in order to do it , we have used ( [ hz ] ) to fit the data of the supernova legacy survey ( snls ) collaboration @xcite .",
    "the result is shown in figure 3 , where we have plotted our theoretical redshift - distance relation for three different values of @xmath51 , together with the theoretical relation predicted by the spatially flat @xmath2cdm model with @xmath87 . in all cases",
    "we have used @xmath88 ( km / s)/mpc .",
    "the best fit obtained with ( [ hz ] ) is given by @xmath89 and @xmath88 ( km / s)/mpc , with @xmath90 . with @xmath91 of confidence level , we have @xmath92 and @xmath93 ( @xmath94 .    with these results we can estimate the universe age in this model . from ( [ adust ] )",
    "we can derive an age parameter given by @xmath95 by using the obtained values of @xmath86 and @xmath51 , one has @xmath96 gyr , corresponding to an age parameter @xmath97 .",
    "it is also possible to obtain from ( [ adust ] ) the present deceleration parameter , whose best value is @xmath98 .",
    "the redshift of transition between the decelerated phase and the accelerated one is @xmath99 @xcite , showing that we have a decelerated phase long enough to permit structure formation .",
    "we have described , on the basis of a macroscopic approach to vacuum dynamics , a non - singular cosmological scenario in agreement with our general standard view about the universe evolution .",
    "we have an initially empty , inflationary spacetime , which is driven to a radiation - dominated phase through a fast phase transition during which a huge amount of energy is released at the expenses of the vacuum decay .",
    "the radiation phase is indistinguishable from the standard one , and it is followed by a matter - dominated era , which evolves to a final de sitter phase , with vacuum dominating again .",
    "this scenario is also consistent with a quantitative analysis of the observed hubble diagram for supernovas of high redshifts , leading to cosmological parameters in accordance with other - non - cosmological - estimations .",
    "in particular , the matter density and age parameters are in the intervals imposed , respectively , by dynamical estimations of dark matter @xcite and globular clusters observations @xcite .    the reader may object that our matter density parameter is above the values estimated on the basis of current observations of the cosmic background radiation @xcite and barion acoustic oscillations @xcite - despite the superposition of the intervals of allowed values .",
    "nevertheless , it must be emphasized that such estimations are dependent on the adopted cosmological model , and should be redone in our case . in particular , the production of matter modifies the standard relations between the dynamic parameters at the time of last scattering and the present matter density .",
    "an analysis of such observations in the context of the present model is in progress .",
    "another point to be analyzed is the evolution of density perturbations , which could be modified by the matter production .",
    "a preliminary investigation has shown no important difference in the growing of the density contrast in the matter era , while in the radiation phase the matter production is irrelevant , as discussed above .",
