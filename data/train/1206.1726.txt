    "quantum spin chains have been extensively studied in the context of quantum statistical mechanics , with special interest directed at phase transitions at zero temperature , which represent a purely quantum effect.@xcite during last years , the behavior of entanglement around quantum critical points in various systems has become a huge subject of investigation.@xcite even if quantum phase transitions take place in the termodynamical limit , where superselection rules force the system to spontaneously break its symmetry , a finite - size analysis can be used to foresee the existence of quantum critical points .",
    "another interesting property of quantum spin chains is the existence of a special value of the external field , located within the ordered symmetry - broken phase , such that the ground state turns out to be factorized .",
    "while around the factorizing field there is no change of symmetry , it separates two regions where symmetry breaking takes place due to two different mechanisms.@xcite    on the other side , the interest toward quantum correlations different from entanglement has been stimulated by the possibility of achieving quantum speed - up using separable ( unentangled ) states .",
    "a remarkable example is represented by the so - called deterministic quantum computation with one qubit ( dqc1 ) protocol.@xcite quantum discord is especially important given that it is able to capture quantum correlations in states that are not entangled.@xcite it has been shown that it is present in almost all quantum states,@xcite and the relation between discord and entanglement has been discussed.@xcite in contrast to entanglement , discord can be generated using local noise,@xcite and it is not monogamous.@xcite beyond the conjectured role in computational speed - up , quantum discord has other operational interpretations , since it quantifies the amount of unlockable classical correlations@xcite and accompanies the emergence of quantum synchronization.@xcite    the generalization of quantum discord to multipartite systems has followed different routes.@xcite in ref .  , it was proposed to use the relative entropy to quantify the amount of genuine quantum and classical correlations , that is , the amount of correlations that can not be accounted for by considering any of the possible sub - partitions of the whole system .    the analysis of quantum correlations beyond entanglement in quantum spin chains has been discussed for instance , in refs .  . in this original paper",

    "the following hamiltonian describes a chain of @xmath0 coupled spins ( xy chain ) in the presence of a homogeneous external field : @xmath1- h \\sum_{n=1}^{n } \\sigma_n^z,\\ ] ] where @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) are the usual pauli matrices , @xmath4 quantifies the anisotropy in the @xmath5 plane , @xmath6 is the transverse magnetic field , and boundary conditions are imposed by defining @xmath7 . in the following , we will assume @xmath8 and use it as an energy scale .",
    "the analytical solution of the model can be obtained using the jordan - wigner transformation,@xcite which maps spins into spinless fermions .",
    "the above hamiltonian is invariant under the @xmath9 group of the rotations by @xmath10 about the @xmath11 axis , given that it commutes with the parity operator @xmath12 . as a consequence , eigenstates of @xmath13 are classified depending on the parity eigenvalue .",
    "this system undergoes a quantum phase transition at the critical point @xmath14.@xcite below this value , in the thermodynamic limit , the odd and the even lowest eigenstates become degenerate , the hamiltonian symmetry is spontaneously broken , and spontaneous magnetization along the @xmath15 axis appears . on the other hand , for @xmath16 , due to the existence of a non vanishing energy gap , the ground state keeps its parity ( even ) .    as pointed out in ref .",
    ", below the critical point , two different symmetry breaking mechanisms take place .",
    "for @xmath17 ( where @xmath18 is defined through @xmath19 ) two - body correlation functions oscillate as a function of the spin distance , while for @xmath20 , they decrease monotonically . for @xmath21 , the ground state factorizes,@xcite i.e. it can be written as @xmath22 where @xmath23 .",
    "an explanation for the two different symmetry breaking mechanisms can be found by analyzing the finite - size solution of the problem .",
    "looking at the lowest odd and even eigenvalues of @xmath13 in the symmetry broken region for finite @xmath0 as a function of the transverse field , a series of level crossings for @xmath24 can be observed.@xcite the number of such level crossing is equal to @xmath25 for @xmath0 even and to @xmath26 for @xmath0 odd ( in this latter case , there is always degeneracy in @xmath27 ) . at each @xmath28",
    "the ground state changes its symmetry , and , in the thermodynamic limit , this kind of structure implies two different symmetry breaking mechanisms . for @xmath29 , as @xmath30 , the set @xmath31 of the degeneracy points becomes a denumerable infinity , while for @xmath32 there is the usual symmetry breaking due to the vanishing of the gap .",
    "ref .   has pointed out that the two regions are characterized by two qualitatively different kinds of bipartite entanglement : for @xmath33 , there is antiparallel entanglement ( the main contribution comes from the antiparallel bell states ) , while for @xmath34 , there is parallel entanglement ( parallel bell states are predominant ) .",
    "in ref .  , modi _ et al .",
    "_ proposed to measure a property of a state as the distance between the state itself and its closest state without that property . following this principle ,",
    "total , classical , and quantum correlations in a state @xmath35 can be measured by means of the relative entropy , defined as @xmath36 , between @xmath37 and the closest relevant states @xmath38 . in ref .  , it was suggested to use the relative entropy as an indicator of genuine correlations .    the total information ( or correlation information ) of a @xmath0-partite state @xmath39 is given by @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the reduced density matrix of subsystem @xmath42 and @xmath43 is the von neumann entropy .",
    "@xmath44 is equal to the relative entropy between @xmath39 and its closest product state ( which does not contain any correlation ) @xmath45:@xcite @xmath46 @xmath47 , the genuine part of @xmath44 , that is , the part of correlations that contains all the contributions that can not be accounted for by considering any of the possible subsystems separately , is measured by the relative entropy between @xmath39 and the closest state without @xmath0-partite correlations , i.e. the closest state which is factorized at least along a bipartite cut.@xcite then , the bipartite cut along which the closest state is found divides the system into two partitions ( let us call them @xmath48 and @xmath49 ) . as shown in ref .  , the minimum distance occurs when @xmath50 and @xmath51 are given by the marginals of the total state @xmath39 , that is , when @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "then , @xmath54 the reduction of the problem of finding genuine correlations in multipartite systems to an effective bipartite problem offers a double advantage . from one side ,",
    "genuine classical and quantum correlations can be defined simply extending the definitions ( involving minimization procedures ) given in bipartite systems;@xcite from the other side , genuine total correlations are a usual bipartite mutual information and are then very easy to compute .",
    "we now present the behavior of total genuine correlations for short xy chains , where finite - size effects are more evident . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , we plot @xmath47 as a function of the transverse field @xmath6 for chains of four , six , and seven sites and for very low temperatures , where the thermal state is very close to the ground state .",
    "as we can see , @xmath47 shows four minima for seven sites , three minima for six sites , and two minima for a chain of four spins .",
    "it can actually shown that these minima fall in the level crossing @xmath24 between the lowest odd and even eigenvalues of @xmath13 and the last level crossing is the factorizing field .",
    "therefore , the symmetry change of the ground state deeply influences the way in which total genuine correlations act in response of the external field .",
    "and the anisotropy parameter is @xmath55 .",
    "this value of @xmath4 implies that the factorizing field is @xmath56 .",
    "this corresponds to the last minimum of @xmath47.,width=377 ]    while the results we are presenting refer to total correlations , in the case of zero temperature , where the system is found in its ground state , genuine classical ( @xmath57 ) and quantum ( @xmath58 ) correlations display the same behavior , given that , in such case , @xmath59.@xcite the calculation of @xmath57 and @xmath58 for finite temperatures would require a numerical minimization over the set of all possible measurements.@xcite nevertheless , for relatively small temperatures , we expect the same qualitative behavior as @xmath47",
    ". a peculiar behavior of ( bipartite ) quantum discord around @xmath60 has been also observed in ref .  .",
    "spin - spin quantum discord turns out to be independent of the distance between the spins .    on the other hand , by increasing the temperature the system state becomes highly mixed , and the effect described before is rapidly washed out . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , we plot @xmath47 as a fuction of the transverse field for three different temperatures ( @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 ) . in the last case , there is no evidence of the dependence of @xmath47 on the ground state level crossing .",
    ", the orange line refers to @xmath62 , while the green line corresponds to @xmath63 .",
    "the anisotropy parameter is @xmath55 .",
    ", width=377 ]    we stress that , since we are considering finite - size systems , the symmetry is not spontaneously broken and the plots presented here refer to symmetric states . while for the symmetry - broken factorized state the absence of correlations is obvious , the fact that , around @xmath60 , correlations in symmetric states have a minimum is not an intuitive result .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied the behavior of genuine correlations for finite - size xy chains in a transverse external field .",
    "we have found that , for zero temperature , genuine correlations exhibit minima for values of the external field where the odd and even ground states are degenerate .",
    "then , the change of symmetry sector of the ground state reflects itself in the behavior of genuine quantum and classical correlations .",
    "a special role is played by the factorizing field , which turns out to be the last minimum observed . on the other hand , at least from the finite - size analysis , at the critical point genuine correlations do not display any distinctive feature .",
