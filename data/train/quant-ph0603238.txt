    "the standard formulation of quantum mechanics requires physical observables to be mathematically given in terms of hermitian operators . in recent years theories with a non - hermitian hamiltonian have been receiving an increasing interest sparked by work in the field of pt - symmetric quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "pt - symmetric hamiltonians are complex but nevertheless possess a real spectrum .",
    "the structure of pt - symmetric theories , initially suggested to hinge on the existence of a charge conjugation operator @xcite has been clarified by showing @xcite that the non - hermitian hamiltonians could be mapped to hermitian ones , and therefore be fitted within the better - known framework of quasi - hermitian operators @xcite .",
    "the relevance of the non - hermitian formulation for the description of physical systems is still being debated @xcite .    in the present work",
    "we show that the effective hamiltonians appearing in certain theories dealing with bound state scattering by a short - range potential are non - hermitian . in this case",
    "the hamiltonians are real and their non - hermitian character stems from the boundary conditions obeyed by the eigenstates : on the one hand there is no physical asymptotic freedom ( since the states are bound ) and on the other the scattering solutions inside the short - range potential region do not exist .",
    "however contrarily to the situation in pt - symmetric problems , there is in principle an underlying hermitian hamiltonian , whose solutions are unknown in practice but whose existence may provide guiding rules when undertaking practical computations",
    ". we will see that the unambiguous formulation of bound state scattering sheds some light on issues regarding the physical relevance of non - hermitian formulations of quantum mechanics .",
    "let us mention that in the overwhelming majority of applications of the bound state scattering formalism to nuclear , atomic or molecular physics non - hermitian issues have been downright ignored ; this is unproblematic when non - hermiticity is small ( as is generally the case ) , but we will give an illustration in which ignoring the non - hermitian nature of the scattering hamiltonian brings in errors that can be directly attributed to the ( inappropriate ) use of the standard inner product .",
    "we will first introduce bound state scattering theory and show why the scattering hamiltonian is non - hermitian in the physical hilbert space @xmath0 ( sec 2 ) .",
    "the quasi - hermitian hamiltonian will then be described by an expansion in terms of a biorthogonal basis , leading naturally to the definition of a new inner product and its associated hilbert space @xmath1 ( sec3 ) . in line with previous works on quasi - hemitian operators",
    ", we will examine the relationship between the two hilbert spaces @xmath0 and @xmath1 in terms of the metric operator and further discuss the computation of physical results in @xmath1 and @xmath0 . in sec 4",
    ", the formalism will be illustrated by carrying out the numerical calculation of an experimentally observable quantity ( the autocorrelation function ) in the particular case of short - range scattering in a coulomb field .",
    "our concluding remarks will be given in sec  5 .",
    "let @xmath2 be the exact hamiltonian of the 2-particle scattering problem ( in the center of mass ; the physical situation most often considered is that of a light particle colliding on a massive compound target ) .",
    "we assume @xmath3 can be split as@xmath4where @xmath5 contains all the _ short range _ interactions between the particles .",
    "we further assume @xmath6 is spherically symmetric ( in terms of the relative coordinate ) and that short - range means that@xmath7ie @xmath5 vanishes outside some small radius @xmath8 ( @xmath9 is the step function ) .",
    "therefore @xmath6 contains not only the kinetic and internal terms of the non - interacting particles , but also any long - range interaction between them .",
    "let @xmath10 be the total energy ; allowing for inelastic scattering @xmath10 is partitioned as@xmath11where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the internal and the kinetic energy respectively ( in the case of a massive target @xmath12 depends on the internal states of the target whereas @xmath13 is the collision energy of the light particle ) .",
    "the eigenstates of @xmath6 are given by @xmath14@xmath15 is the eigenfunction of the radial part of @xmath6 whereas the target state @xmath16 includes all the other degrees of freedom , including the non - radial ones of the colliding particle ( a handy notation given that the angular momenta of the particles are usually coupled ) .",
    "the target states are orthogonal , @xmath17 .",
    "since we are dealing with bound states , @xmath18 vanishes at @xmath19 and @xmath20 ( whenever @xmath10 is an eigenvalue of @xmath6 ) .",
    "the label @xmath21 defines the scattering channel . in each channel",
    "the standing - wave solutions are given by the lippmann - schwinger equations of scattering theory as @xmath22where @xmath23 is the principal - value green s function and @xmath24 the reaction ( scattering ) operator for standing waves linked to the familiar @xmath25 matrix by a cayley transform @xcite .",
    "the difference here with standard scattering theory is that the bound channels are included explicitly @xcite.the consequences are that ( _ i _ ) @xmath23 has no poles  it is modified @xcite relative to the usual resolvent by including a term ( solution of the homogeneous equation ) that has poles at the eigenvalues of @xmath26 so that overall @xmath23 has no poles ( but diverges radially ) ; becomes the standard green s function . ]",
    "( _ ii _ ) there is no asymptotic freedom : both @xmath27 and @xmath28 diverge at @xmath29 for an arbitrary value of @xmath10 ; ( _ iii _ ) an eigenstate of @xmath2 can not be given by a single channel solution of the form ( [ z50 ] ) but requires a superposition@xmath30where the expansion coefficients @xmath31 are determined by the asymptotic ( @xmath32 ) boundary conditions such that at the eigenvalues @xmath33 vanishes at infinity .    formally @xmath34 is satisfied as well as the usual properties for eigenstates of hermitian operators , such as their orthonormality@xmath35or the spectral decomposition theorem .",
    "however in practice the expansion of @xmath36 over the eigenstates of @xmath6 is intractable . instead",
    "the radial part of @xmath36 is separated and the expansion over the energies reduced to the closed form @xmath37 ; @xmath38 is a solution of the radial part of @xmath6 irregular at the origin ( for arbitrary bound energies , both @xmath39 and @xmath40 exponentially diverge in the limit @xmath41 ) .",
    "hence the closed form of the radial green s function only makes sense for @xmath42 ( where @xmath5 vanishes ) .",
    "this is of course consistent with the scattering point of view : when @xmath43 we are inside the reaction zone and there is no scattering solution , whatever happens within the reaction zone being encoded in the phase - shifts .",
    "the wavefunction ( [ z52 ] ) outside the reaction zone becomes@xmath44 \\qquad r > r_{0 }   \\label{e20}\\]]where @xmath45 are the on - shell elements of the scattering matrix , which are assumed to be known .",
    "it is important to note that the scattering eigenstate ( [ e20 ] ) is the part for @xmath42 of the exact solution @xmath46 , and not an approximation to it .",
    "but within the scattering fomulation the inner part of @xmath46 for @xmath43 does not exist : all meaningful quantities are defined radially on @xmath47 .",
    "indeed let us write@xmath48and let @xmath49be the restriction of @xmath2 to the outer region @xmath42 .",
    "@xmath50 is the only operator directly known from the solutions of the scattering problem .",
    "we have the following properties : @xmath51that @xmath50 is hermitian relative to the standard product can be seen to follow from its definition ( [ a25 ] ) .",
    "( [ e23b ] ) tells us first that the @xmath52 are normalized to 1 like the @xmath53 which might appear surprising in view of ( [ a20 ] ) but follows by showing normalization does not depend on the inner radial part of the wavefunction ( this is done by expressing the normalization integral in terms of radial wronskians , see sec 5.7 of @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath54eq ( [ e23b ] ) also indicates that the scattering eigenstates @xmath55 are not orthogonal since the scalar product of two disitinct eigenstates is given by @xmath56 .",
    "this may be shown by rearranging eq ( [ e20 ] ) in the form@xmath57where the overall contribution in a given scattering channel @xmath21 is grouped together . as a consequence the radial channel functions @xmath58 must vanish as @xmath41 for each @xmath21",
    "( the scattering information is now contained in the @xmath59 functions and in the new coefficients @xmath60 that both depend on @xmath24).recalling the target states are orthogonal , the scalar product ( [ e23b ] ) is seen to depend solely on the radial overlaps between identical channel radial functions at different energies , given by@xmath61_{r_{0}}}{% \\epsilon _ { 2}-\\epsilon _ { 1 } } ,   \\label{e25}\\]]where @xmath62 is the wronskian taken at @xmath8 .",
    "this equality follows from computing @xmath63 ( integrate by parts and recall that the scalar product is defined in @xmath64 $ ] ) .",
    "this gives rise to nonzero boundary terms at @xmath8 , impliying that @xmath65 is not hermitian on @xmath64 $ ] . on bounded intervals with arbitrary boundary conditions",
    "is of course trivial . in the context of scattering theory ,",
    "this fact was pointed out in particular by bloch @xcite who introduced a singular surface operator to cancel the boundary terms when defining quantities on @xmath66 $ ] .",
    "however the non - hermitian character of the scattering eigenstates on @xmath67 $ ] is irrelevant in standard scattering theory because the solutions of @xmath2 and @xmath6 are both ( improperly ) normalized by the same asymptotic condition , hinging on the isometry of the wave operators . ]    because the @xmath68 are not orthogonal , they can not be eigenstates of the hermitian operator @xmath50 [ eq ( [ e23c ] ) ] but are eigenvectors of a non - hermitian hamiltonian denoted @xmath69 . from eqs ( [ 1 ] ) and ( [ 3 ] ) we see that @xmath70 is formally given by @xmath6 redefined by restricting it radially to the interval @xmath71 $ ] and supplementing it by specific boundary conditions on the surface @xmath72 . it is precisely this fact , combined with the lack of asymptotic completeness , that leads to non - hermiticity .",
    "this completes our brief discussion on the non - hermitian character of the bound state scattering problem ; we now analyze the structure of the non - hermitian theory and further examine the implications of this non - hermiticity in practical problems .",
    "here we forget about the existence of an underlying exact hamiltonian and we take the practical scattering viewpoint : the phase - shifts are given numbers ( obtained from a symmetric @xmath24 matrix ) and the physical states are represented by vectors in @xmath0 , which is essentially the hilbert space of standard quantum mechanics : it is endowed with the standard scalar product except that radially the integral is defined on @xmath64 $ ] .",
    "this slight modification of the radial integral does not cause any difference since the states of interest in scattering phenomena ( such as gaussian states ) have negligible probability amplitude in the inner zone . in this sense the @xmath52 belong to  @xmath0 .",
    "since @xmath70 is non - hermitian on @xmath0 , we have@xmath73we are thus naturally lead to introduce a biorthogonal set @xmath74 @xcite , where we denote by @xmath75 the eigenstates of @xmath76 .",
    "the following properties are satisfied:@xmath77from which it follows that we can write the following expansions:@xmath78@xmath69 and @xmath76 are further linked by@xmath79where @xmath80 is a hermitian operator given by@xmath81 we will take for granted the completeness of the biorthogonal basis , although it is by no means obvious .  in particular the difficulties that arise when @xmath0 is of infinite dimensions have been pointed out recently @xcite .",
    "completeness of the biorthogonal basis implies that the canonical metric basis ( in the sense of @xcite ) , consisting of the eigenvectors of the metric operator , is also complete .",
    "from there we deduce that an arbitrary state of @xmath0 can in principle be expanded in terms of the @xmath82 , ie the eigenstates of @xmath69 span the entire hilbert space of admissible physical states even if they do not form an orthogonal basis in @xmath0 .",
    "the relations ( [ eep])([e42 ] ) have become familiar lately in the context of pt - symmetric quantum mechanics and more largely in works dealing with quasi - hermitian operators ( see in particular @xcite ) .",
    "eq ( [ e40 ] ) is the defining relation of quasi - hermiticity @xcite provided @xmath80 is invertible ( @xmath83 then being its inverse , since by ( [ e33 ] ) @xmath84 is a representation of the unit operator in @xmath1 ) and positive - definite . we will not attempt to prove these properties here .",
    "we note however that if the @xmath68 ( and hence the @xmath85 ) form a basis of @xmath86 , as we have assumed to be the case , then @xmath80 has no null eigenvalue and is thus invertible .",
    "it is of course a working hypothesis in scattering theory that any meaningful physical state can be expanded in terms of the @xmath87 ( but this may not be true mathematically for a given arbitrary vector ) .",
    "the positive - definiteness of @xmath80 follows heuristically by remarking that in the mixed representation @xmath88simply becomes ( [ e23b ] ) , so that @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the identity matrix , @xmath91 is the special matrix with elements @xmath92 and @xmath56 a small ( @xmath93 ) real number .",
    "the positive - definiteness of @xmath94 ensures that @xmath80 is positive definite too .",
    "the positive - definitiness of @xmath80 is important to define a positive norm in @xmath1 @xcite . since from eq ( [ e42 ] )",
    "@xmath95the inner product is defined through @xmath96 @xmath80 is thus seen to be ( the positive definite ) metric . by eq ( e40 ) it is immediate to verify that @xmath69 is hermitian relative to this new inner product .",
    "let @xmath1 be the hilbert space endowed with the inner product defined by ( [ e45 ] ) .",
    "calculations are simple to perform in @xmath1 because the new scalar product reestablishes orthogonality .",
    "indeed  let @xmath97 and @xmath98 be two vectors in @xmath1 .",
    "then it follows from eq ( [ e45 ] ) that@xmath99with the obvious notation@xmath100we further see that quantities involving the expansions of the non - hermitian hamiltonian , such as the time evolution operator , can not be directly determined in @xmath0 , precisely because of the non - hermiticity of @xmath69 in @xmath0 .",
    "but in @xmath1 the evolution operator is given by@xmath101hence for example if we take an initial state as @xmath102 , the state evolves according to @xmath103operating in effect in @xmath1 as we would in @xmath0 with a hermitian operator .",
    "however , in scattering problems , the physical states are known in @xmath0 , not in @xmath1 .",
    "let @xmath104 and @xmath105 be two vectors in @xmath86 and assume they can be expanded over the @xmath55 as @xmath106 .",
    "they are normalized relative to the standard scalar product,@xmath107since the basis is nonorthogonal in @xmath108 @xmath109 . on the other hand operators involving the hamiltonian , such as the evolution operator ( [ e50 ] )",
    "are known on @xmath110 but not on @xmath0 .",
    "the transformation between the two hilbert spaces can be done both ways , @xmath111 for the operators or @xmath112 for the states .  indeed if an operator @xmath113 is hermitian in @xmath1 then @xmath114is hermitian in @xmath0 .",
    "this follows directly from the general version of eq ( [ e40]),@xmath115this transformation defines a linear map @xcite that leaves the inner product invariant:@xmath116where we have defined@xmath117therefore @xmath118 and @xmath119 represent the _ same _ physical state but relative to different hilbert spaces : @xmath118 in @xmath120 and @xmath121 in @xmath1 .",
    "of course as vectors we may as well have for instance @xmath122 but then @xmath119 does not describe the same physical state as it does in @xmath1 . it is interesting to note that the functions @xmath123 defined on @xmath0 ( with @xmath124 $ ] ) represent the _ exact _ eigenstates of the underlying hamiltonian .",

    "finally , we briefly describe how to undertake practical calculations . recalling that scattering solutions as well as the hamiltonian @xmath130",
    "are defined in @xmath131 and comparing eqs ( [ e53 ] ) and ( [ e57 ] ) , it appears that it is computationally simpler to transform the physical states from @xmath0 to @xmath1 rather than transform the operators to @xmath0 .",
    "nevertheless in both cases it is necessary to determine the metric @xmath80 . in general",
    "( as in the illustration given below ) @xmath80 is a matrix of infinite rank=. @xmath80 is therefore truncated around the energy interval of interest .",
    "the matrix elements are determined in the mixed representation given by eq ( [ e43 ] ) , which simply amounts to determine the overlaps@xmath132where @xmath10 and @xmath133 span the ( truncated ) finite interval .",

    "the degree of non - hermiticity is assessed through the metric in the mixed representation ( [ ezz1 ] ) : if the hamiltonian is hermitian relative to the standard inner product , @xmath80 becomes the identity matrix.as non - hermiticity becomes important , the off - diagonal elements of the metric increase . to assess the degree of non - hermiticity we introduce a non - hermiticity index @xmath137 that we define somewhat arbitarily by the average of the @xmath138 largest absolute values of @xmath139  ( ie the @xmath138 largest off - diagonal terms of the metric ) where @xmath138 is the dimension of the chunk of @xmath80 under study .",

    "this situation is widely employed in atomic physics to study the highly excited ( rydberg ) states of atoms with a single excited electron .",
    "more specifically we will compute the autocorrelation function @xmath142 in two ways : by taking into account the non - hermitian character of the hamiltonian on the one hand , and by downright ignoring hermiticity related issues on the other hand .",

    "the metric was constructed from the numerical calculation of the exact eigenstates of @xmath69 in a restricted energy interval of interest .",
    "the interesting insight gained by the existence of an underlying exact hamiltonian @xmath2 is that for scattering states , the physical hilbert space @xmath0 is essentially the same as the hilbert space of the exact problem .",

    "actually the expansion in terms of the eigenstates of the exact hamiltonian in @xmath0 is identical to the expansion in terms of the eigenstates of @xmath69 in @xmath1 .",
    "these remarks suggest that as far as the scattering eigenstates are concerned , @xmath1 is more physical than @xmath0 , where these eigenstates become @xmath185 . from a more general standpoint it appears that quantum mechanics requires above all a hilbert space @xmath1 on which the operators are self - adjoint relative to a given inner product ,",
    "whatever this inner product may be . in this work",
    "the hilbert space @xmath0 defined with the standard inner product ( the @xmath186 inner product ) only entered the problem because in bound state scattering arbitrary physical states and operators are already known in this space .",
    "in general however it is possible to envisage the case in which the standard inner product would not play a special rle , although such a situation will probably lead to intricate interpretational issues regarding the physical significance of computed quantities ."

    "<S> we give a numerical example involving scattering by a short - range potential in a coulomb field for which it is seen that even for a small but non - negligible non - hermiticity index the non - hermitian character of the problem must be taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> the computation of physical quantities in the relevant hilbert spaces is also discussed . </S>"
