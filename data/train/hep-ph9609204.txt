    "the discovery of the top quark at fermilab fulfilled the three - family quark picture in the standard electroweak model .",
    "up to now , some knowledge on the mass spectra of @xmath2 and @xmath3 quarks has been accumulated through both experimental and theoretical ( or phenomenological ) attempts @xcite .",
    "the ratios of quark mass eigenvalues are obtainable after one renormalizes them to a common reference scale , e.g. , @xmath4 gev or @xmath5 .",
    "there exists a clear mass hierarchy in each quark sector : @xmath6 in comparison , the masses of three charged leptons manifest a similar hierarchical pattern @xcite .",
    "quark mass eigenstates are related to quark weak ( flavor ) eigenstates by the kobayashi - maskawa ( km ) matrix @xmath7 @xcite , which provides a quite natural description of flavor mixings and @xmath1 violation in the standard model . to date , many experimental constraints on the magnitudes of the km matrix elements have been achieved .",
    "the unitarity of @xmath7 together with current data requires a unique hierarchy among the nine matrix elements @xcite : @xmath8 here @xmath9 is a necessary condition for the presence of @xmath1 violation in the km matrix .    how to understand the hierarchies of quark masses and flavor mixings is an important but unsolved problem in particle physics .",
    "a natural approach to the final solution of this problem is to look for the most favorable pattern of quark mass matrices ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) , which can account for all low - energy phenomena of quark mixings and @xmath1 violation .",
    "the relevant symmetries hidden in such phenomenological schemes are possible to provide useful hints toward the dynamical details of fermion mass generation .",
    "it has been speculated by some authors that the realistic fermion mass matrices could arise from the flavor permutation symmetry and its spontaneous or explicit breaking @xcite . under exact @xmath10 symmetry the mass spectrum for either up or down quark sector",
    "consists of only two levels : one is of 2-fold degeneracy with vanishing mass eigenvalues , and the other is nondegenerate ( massive ) .",
    "an appropriate breakdown of the above symmetry may lead to the observed mass hierarchy and flavor mixings .",
    "although the way to introduce the minimum number of free parameters for permutation symmetry breaking is technically trivial , its consequences on quark mixings and @xmath1 violation may be physically instructive and may even shed some light on the proper relations between the km matrix elements and quark mass ratios .",
    "indeed there has not been a satisfactory symmetry breaking pattern with enough predictive power in the literature .    in this work",
    "we first stress that some observed properties of the km matrix can be interpreted by the quark mass hierarchy without the assumption of specific mass matrices . in the quark mass limits such as @xmath11 , @xmath12 or @xmath13",
    ", we find that simple but instructive relations between the km matrix elements and quark mass ratios are suggestible from current experimental data .",
    "then we present a new quark mass _ ansatz _ through the explicit breakdown of flavor permutation symmetry at the weak scale ( @xmath14 gev ) .",
    "this _ ansatz _ contains seven free parameters , thus it can give rise to three predictions for the phenomena of quark mixings and @xmath1 violation .",
    "the typical results are @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 in the leading order approximation .",
    "prescribing the same _ ansatz _ at the supersymmetric grand unified theory ( gut ) scale ( @xmath18 gev ) , we derive the renormalized quark mass matrices at @xmath5 for small @xmath19 ( the ratio of higgs vacuum expectation values in the minimal supersymmetric model ) .",
    "we also renormalize some relations between the km matrix elements and quark mass ratios at @xmath5 for arbitrary @xmath19 , and find that the relevant results are in good agreement with experimental data .",
    "the scale - independent predictions of our _ ansatz _ for the characteristic measurables of @xmath1 asymmetries in weak @xmath20 decays , i.e. , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , can be tested at the forthcoming kek and slac @xmath20-meson factories .",
    "the remaining part of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "some qualitative implications of the quark mass hierarchy on the km matrix elements , which are almost independent of the specific forms of quark mass matrices , are discussed in section 2 . in section 3",
    "we suggest a new quark mass _ ansatz _ from the flavor permutation symmetry breaking at the weak scale , and study its various consequences on flavor mixings and @xmath1 violation .",
    "the same _ ansatz _ is prescribed at the supersymmetric gut scale in section 4 . by use of the one - loop renormalization group equations , we run the mass matrices from @xmath24 to @xmath5 and then discuss the renormalized relations between the km matrix elements and quark mass ratios . section 5",
    "is devoted to a brief summary of this work .",
    "without loss of any generality , the up and down quark mass matrices ( denoted by @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively ) can be chosen to be hermitian .",
    "after the diagonalization of @xmath25 and @xmath26 through the unitary transformations @xmath27 one obtains the km matrix @xmath28 , which describes quark flavor mixings in the charged current . explicitly , the km matrix elements read @xmath29 depending upon the quark mass ratios @xmath30 , @xmath31 ( from @xmath32 ) and @xmath33 , @xmath34 ( from @xmath35 ) as well as other parameters of @xmath25 and @xmath26 ( e.g. , the non - trivial phase shifts between @xmath25 and @xmath26 ) . in view of the distinctive mass hierarchy in eq .",

    "we conclude that the presence of @xmath64 in the quark mass _ ansatz _ above is crucial for correct reproduction of @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
