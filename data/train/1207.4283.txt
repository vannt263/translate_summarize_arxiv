    "m - theory is expected to unify all of our understandings on the nonperturbative effects of string theory . despite its importance , many aspects on this interesting theory await to be understood .",
    "one of the most mysterious facts on m - theory is the degrees of freedom of the branes . from the ads / cft correspondence , it is known @xcite that @xmath5 coincident m2-branes ( or m5-branes )",
    "have the degrees of freedom of order @xmath6 ( or @xmath7 , respectively ) . in the case of d",
    "- branes in string theory , the worldvolume theory can be described by the super yang - mills theory , which has the degrees of freedom @xmath8 .",
    "compared with such a case , the field theoretical realization on the branes in m - theory is still unclear .",
    "recently , there is a breakthrough @xcite ( along with its extension with fractional branes @xcite ) in understanding branes in m - theory , where it was proposed that the worldvolume theory of m2-branes is described by the supersymmetric extension of the chern - simons theory . concretely speaking ,",
    "the proposal states that @xmath5 coincident m2-branes on the geometry @xmath9 is described by the @xmath10 chern - simons theory with gauge groups @xmath11 and bifundamental matters @xmath12 forming the superpotential @xmath13 where the coupling constant is given by @xmath14 .",
    "the geometry @xmath9 in a special case with @xmath2 is nothing but the flat space , hence it is natural to expect that the supersymmetry is enhanced to @xmath15 in that case .",
    "it was then proposed that assuming the existence of the monopole operator we can construct the @xmath15 supersymmetry algebra when @xmath16 @xcite .    subsequently , it was shown in @xcite that the localization technique @xcite , which reduces the partition function defined by infinite - dimensional path integral to a finite - dimensional matrix model , is applicable to supersymmetric chern - simons theories .",
    "this matrix model has the measure of the chern - simons type and many techniques from the chern - simons matrix model such as @xcite was utilized @xcite to obtain not only the @xmath6 behavior of the free energy in the planar limit but also the shift of t hooft coupling @xmath17 as expected from the euler coupling in the gravity dual @xcite .    besides",
    ", it was also noticed that this matrix model is closely related to the topological string theory on a local calabi - yau over the hirzebruch surface @xmath18 . using this relation",
    ", we can study the higher genus contribution by borrowing a celebrated recursive relation , the holomorphic anomaly equation @xcite , from the topological string theory .",
    "following interesting observations by @xcite , it was found in @xcite that we obtain the airy function after summing up the contributions from all genus .",
    "this result on the airy function suggests some interesting relations to previous understanding on m - theory . in @xcite",
    "it was noticed that the airy function also appears in other context of m - theory as the wave - function of the universe .",
    "further , the integral expression of the airy function @xmath19 , which is a contour integral of an exponentiated cubic term , looks similar to the partition function @xmath20)$ ] of the cubic chern - simons action @xmath21 $ ] .",
    "therefore , we are led to expect a deep relation among m - theory , the chern - simons theory and the airy function .",
    "another expectation from this result is its implication in understanding some of hidden structures in the membrane theory .",
    "string theory originates from the veneziano amplitude in the dual resonance model , out of which the string worldsheet conformal symmetry was realized .",
    "similarly , one might expect to find some hidden symmetry out of this airy function and realize some structure for m - theory .",
    "an interesting hidden structure of this airy function was beautifully realized by @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the partition function of m2-branes ( as well as its generalization with @xmath22 supersymmetry ) can be rewritten exactly into the partition function of a fermi gas system with the density matrix ( related to hamiltonian by @xmath23 ) @xmath24 and , with the standard analysis of the statistical mechanics , we can reproduce the behavior of @xmath6 and airy function easily . very recently",
    ", it was further proposed in @xcite that we can generalize this formalism to the @xmath25 case by introducing interactions to the fermi particles and in @xcite that we can extend to the cases with wilson loops .",
    "this simple rederivation of the airy function implies the importance of this fermi gas formulation . since we have already a good control on the perturbative terms using the statistical mechanical method , as a next step , we would like to proceed to the study of this quantum mechanics extensively beyond the perturbation theory and to obtain some non - perturbative information out of it .    aside from its possible important message on m - theory , the mathematical structure in this maximally supersymmetric theory seems very interesting .",
    "the supergravity analysis @xcite suggests the bps condition is expressed by a continuous toda equation and the hamiltonian of this fermi gas system takes the form similar to the relativistic toda theory @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is natural to expect some kind of the exactly solvable structure in this theory",
    ". some of the exact results was found in @xcite .",
    "we would like to make a first step towards the goal to compute the exact partition function of the abjm theory for arbitrary @xmath5 and arbitrary chern - simons level @xmath26 , and to solve the eigenvalue equation of the corresponding fermi gas system . heading for this goal",
    ", we have found some interesting exact results on this theory as we will report in this paper .",
    "as we will see in the next section , the ( grand ) partition function of this fermi gas system is computed by the trace of the power of the density matrix .",
    "the main difficulty resides in the computation of convoluting the matrix element successively , @xmath27 following the previous work on the thermodynamic bethe ansatz ( tba ) equations @xcite , here we are able to express the matrix elements in terms of more basic vector quantities and reducing the computation of convoluting matrices into that of convoluting vectors .",
    "in addition , we have also attempted to reduce the integration by commuting the coordinate @xmath28 and the momentum @xmath29 .",
    "we have found that , although the naive commutation relation is anomalous , interestingly the additional term to the naive commutation relation can be expressed in terms of a projection operator @xmath30 . using this relation",
    ", we can express @xmath31 for odd @xmath32 by some combinations of @xmath33 .",
    "for even @xmath32 , we have found an interesting novel relation which separates the density matrix into two parities .",
    "we will mostly restrict ourselves to the maximally supersymmetric case @xmath2 .",
    "most of our following analysis goes straightforwardly to other values of @xmath26 though a key relation will only look simple for @xmath2 .",
    "the case @xmath2 is particularly interesting from the viewpoint of holography since the abjm theory at @xmath2 is conjectured to be dual to the m - theory on @xmath34 which is in the truly m - theoretic regime .",
    "the study of the abjm matrix model in the large @xmath5 , finite @xmath26 regime was initiated by @xcite and further studied in @xcite from the fermi gas approach .",
    "however , the approach of @xcite is restricted to the perturbation around @xmath35 .",
    "we would like to study the @xmath2 case exactly .",
    "as a result , we have computed the exact partition function @xmath0 up to @xmath1 .",
    "we shall summarize our results in the following , @xmath36 surprisingly , all of these results are written in terms of polynomials of @xmath3 with rational coefficients .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we present our general procedure to compute the grand partition function . applying the lemma of tracy - widom @xcite",
    ", we first show that the power of density matrix @xmath37 is written in terms of a set of functions of one variable .",
    "we also show that the eigenvalue problem of @xmath38 is reduced to the diagonalization of a certain hankel matrix . in section 3",
    ", we find that the commutation relation of @xmath39 and @xmath40 appearing in @xmath38 contains an anomalous term , which can be expressed by a insertion of projection operator .",
    "then we show that such anomalous commutation relation leads to a nontrivial relation of the grand partition function . in section 4 ,",
    "using our general method , we compute exactly the first few terms of the taylor expansion of the grand partition function at @xmath2 .",
    "these are nothing but the partition functions @xmath0 . along the way",
    ", we find a non - trivial equation relating the even part and odd part of density matrix . in section 5 , some numerical results are given .",
    "we consider the tba - type integral equation proposed in @xcite to compute @xmath31 .",
    "these integral equations are powerful in the numerical analysis .",
    "we also study the numerical solutions of the eigenvalue problem of the fermi gas system . in section 6",
    ", we compare our results with the known perturbative results of the abjm matrix model and find a good agreement with the airy function even for small @xmath5 .",
    "we study the non - perturbative corrections to the free energy , and find numerical evidence that the leading correction scales as @xmath41 .",
    "we also consider the expectation value of @xmath5 in the grand canonical ensemble .",
    "we find that the numerical computation using tba - like equations smoothly interpolates our exact results and the perturbative results .",
    "finally , we conclude in section 7 with discussions and future directions . appendices",
    "a , b and c contain some details of the computations skipped in the text .",
    "the aim of this section is to present a general prescription which is helpful for computing the grand partition function of the abjm theory .",
    "the concrete computation based on the method given here will be presented in section [ sec : exact ] .",
    "let us start by reviewing the fermi gas formalism developed in @xcite . by using the localization ,",
    "the partition function of the abjm theory on @xmath42 is written as the matrix integral @xmath43 ^ 2 [ 2\\sinh(\\frac{\\nu_i-\\nu_j}{2})]^2 } { \\prod_{i , j } [ 2\\cosh(\\frac{\\mu_i-\\nu_j}{2})]^2 } \\exp\\left[\\frac{ik}{4\\pi}\\sum_{i=1}^n(\\mu_i^2-\\nu_i^2)\\right ] .",
    "\\label{eq : z_abjm}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] applying the cauchy identity to the measure factor and performing the gaussian integral over @xmath44 , this partition function is recast into the `` mirror '' expression @xcite @xmath45 the key idea of @xcite is to rewrite it as the partition function of an ideal fermi gas @xmath46 where @xmath47 is understood as the density matrix of this fermi gas system . since the sum over permutations in can be also written as a sum over conjugacy classes of the permutation group , it is convenient to consider the grand partition function @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the fugacity and @xmath50 is the chemical potential . in our analysis , it is important to notice that the grand partition function has the following form @xmath51 , \\label{eq : gpf}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 is defined by @xmath52 it is easy to see that @xmath53 can be expressed as the fredholm determinant of the kernel @xmath38 @xmath54 once the grand partition function is known , one can obtain the partition function by performing the contour integral @xmath55    for later analysis , it is convenient to divide the density matrix into two parts . since the density matrix @xmath56 is parity - preserving : @xmath57 , we decompose it into the parity even and odd parts @xmath58 by definition , @xmath59 , and thus all the matrix elements of the product @xmath60 vanish : @xmath61 this means that @xmath31 splits into two parts , @xmath62 and the grand partition function is factorized into @xmath63 where @xmath64 as we will see later , such a decomposition of the density matrix plays an important role in the analysis of the grand partition function .",
    "now let us consider the computation of the grand partition function .",
    "as can be seen from , we can compute the grand partition function if we know @xmath31 . to compute the partition function @xmath0 , in particular , we need @xmath31 ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "however it is technically difficult to directly compute @xmath31 ( or the matrix element @xmath66 ) because it is given by the multi - variable integral as in ( or ) . to overcome this difficulty",
    ", we here use the technique proposed in @xcite , which enables us to compute @xmath66 from a series of functions of one variable .",
    "this technique can be applicable to a wide class of the kernels with the form @xmath67 here we apply it to the kernels @xmath68 .",
    "below we concentrate our attention to @xmath2 for simplicity .",
    "it is straightforward to generalize the method here to general @xmath69 .",
    "the important point is that two matrices @xmath70 have the following forms ] itself is also of this class . ]",
    "@xmath71 where @xmath72 we can apply lemma 1 in @xcite to .",
    "it is shown that ( the generating functions of ) the density matrices are given by @xmath73 ( q_1,q_2 ) = \\frac{q_\\pm(q_1)q_\\pm(q_2)-p_\\pm(q_1)p_\\pm(q_2 ) } { \\cosh q_1+\\cosh q_2 } , \\label{eq : rpm}\\\\ \\biggl[\\frac{z^2 \\rho_\\pm^2}{1-z^2 \\rho_\\pm^2}\\biggr ] ( q_1,q_2 ) = \\frac{q_\\pm(q_1)p_\\pm(q_2)-p_\\pm(q_1)q_\\pm(q_2 ) } { \\cosh q_1-\\cosh q_2 } , \\label{eq : spm}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath74 ( q , q ' ) \\sqrt{z}e_{\\pm}(q'),\\quad q_\\pm(q)=\\int \\ ! \\frac{dq'}{2\\pi } \\biggl[\\frac{1}{1-z^2 \\rho_\\pm^2}\\biggr ] ( q , q ' ) \\sqrt{z}e_{\\pm}(q').\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if we expand @xmath75 and @xmath76 as @xmath77 where @xmath78 then and indicate that the density matrices are given by @xmath79 these are the key relations in our analysis later .",
    "these results show that the matrix elements @xmath80 are determined algebraically by the functions @xmath81 ( @xmath82 ) of one variable respectively",
