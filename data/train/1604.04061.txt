    "hawking radiation refers to the theoretically predicted black hole emission of thermal radiation with a temperature of @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the mass of the black hole and @xmath5 is the gravitational constant @xcite .",
    "the detection of hawking radiation is extremely difficult because the hawking temperature of a black hole with solar mass @xmath6 [ kg ] is of the order of @xmath7 [ k ] , which is much smaller than the temperature of the cosmic microwave background @xmath8 [ k ] .",
    "the unruh effect refers to the prediction that a uniformly accelerated observer sees the minkowski vacuum as a thermal bath with a temperature of @xmath9 , where @xmath1 is the acceleration of the observer @xcite .",
    "the unruh effect is related to the hawking radiation via the principle of equivalence .",
    "therefore , any experimental verification of the unruh effect will be useful as an analogy of the hawking radiation .",
    "p. chen and t. tajima pointed out the possibility of testing the unruh effect using an extremely intense laser @xcite .",
    "an electron accelerated by the laser will see the minkowski vacuum as a thermal bath ; then , radiation might be produced via the unruh effect , which is referred to as unruh radiation . using a laser with an intensity of the order of @xmath10 [ w/@xmath11 @xcite , the unruh temperature reaches @xmath12 [ k ] , which is much higher than room temperature . thus ,",
    "unruh radiation is interesting as evidence of the unruh effect .",
    "possible signatures of unruh radiation have been theoretically investigated by several authors .",
    "the authors in refs . investigated the unruh radiation produced by scattering between an accelerated electron and the rindler particle of the thermal bath originating from the unruh effect .",
    "however , the importance of quantum interference in predicting the unruh radiation has been pointed out @xcite ; we take this interference into account in our theoretical investigation of the signature of the unruh radiation @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we review our results in ref .. adopting a model consisting of a charged particle and an electromagnetic field , we calculate the energy flux while taking the quantum interference term into account . in sec .",
    "iii , we show that the results in sec .",
    "ii are consistent with the first - order quantum correction to the larmor radiation , which was previously obtained using a different approach in refs ..",
    "we adopt a model consisting of a point particle ( with a mass @xmath2 and a charge @xmath13 ) and an electromagnetic field @xmath14 , which are coupled to each other .",
    "the action of the model is given by @xmath15 with @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the field strength and @xmath20 is the metric of the minkowski spacetime , for which we follow the convention @xmath21 .",
    "the equations of motion are derived from the action as follows : @xmath22 @xmath23 where we introduce the external force @xmath24 that accelerates the particle with acceleration @xmath1 using a uniform electromagnetic field @xmath25 .",
    "the solution of eq .",
    "( [ 032301 ] ) is given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 satisfies @xmath28 , and @xmath29 represents the retarded green s function that satisfies @xmath30 .",
    "note that the background part of the electromagnetic field @xmath31 does not contribute to the radiation energy flux , but instead , simply uniformly accelerates the particle .",
    "we introduce the inhomogeneous solution of the electromagnetic field @xmath32 as follows @xmath33 decomposing the trajectory of the particle @xmath34 into two parts @xmath35 and substituting ( [ 032303 ] ) into ( [ 032302 ] ) , we obtain the linearized equation of ( [ 032302 ] ) , @xmath36 in the following discussion , we omit the third - order time derivative term of the radiation reaction force @xmath37 in ( [ mddotz ] ) , because the contribution of this term to the perturbation @xmath38 is of the order of @xmath39 , so as to avoid the boiling vacuum that is due to the schwinger effect . therefore , @xmath0 is much smaller than unity .",
    "] as mentioned in the paper by s. zhang @xcite",
    ". moreover , this term corresponds to the effect caused by the short - distance dynamics , whose scale is of the order of @xmath40 , which is much smaller than the compton length @xmath41 .    to obtain the energy flux of the unruh radiation ,",
    "we first calculate the two - point correlation function , @xmath42 where @xmath43 represents the wightman function for vacuum fluctuations of the field and @xmath44 does not contribute to the energy flux ; therefore , we subtracted it from the two - point function .",
    "the inhomogeneous solution is written as @xmath45 with @xmath46 , where @xmath47 satisfies the relation @xmath48 and the trajectory @xmath49 is in the r - region ( see the left panel of fig .",

    ", we obtain @xmath50 , where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are defined as @xmath53 and @xmath54 , respectively .",
