    "the material under consideraion here is build from picene and fluorinated tcnq molecules forming molecular crystals or films with an 1:1 composition which can be synthesized by co - evaporation @xcite .",
    "the main building block in the crystal is a dimer like structure of picene and tcnq with flat orientation with respect to each other .",
    "therefore , we start our discussion with a short comparison of the electronic structure of the free picene-@xmath0 -dimer and anthraquinone derivate based on density functional theory ( dft ) calculations .     electronic structure close to the fermi level as obtained from density functional theory calculations for ( a ) the anthraquinone derivate and ( b ) the picene-@xmath0 -dimer . ]    the electronic structure of the anthraquinone derivate as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : elevels ] a ) has already been discussed in detail elsewhere @xcite .",
    "it shows the typical properties of a @xmath3-conjugated molecular material ( semiconductor ) having a homo - lumo gap of about @xmath4 and an almost symmetric level arrangement .",
    "the homo and homo-1 levels are delocalized and span the whole molecule including the thiol anchor units .",
    "the sprawling side structures guarantee that electron withdrawing or pushing effects of the anchor units modify only slightly the underlying electronic structure of the anthraquinone core .",
    "the electronic structure of the picene-@xmath0 system on the other hand is determined by the occurrence of hybrid orbitals which are formed between the @xmath3-conjugated picene and the @xmath0 acceptor .",
    "the homo-1 and lumo orbital of picene-@xmath0 are formed from states of the free picene and @xmath0 .",
    "this hybridization induces a charge transfer of about @xmath5 from the picene to the @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "based on the electronic structure calculations the transport properties have been obtained using the non - equilibrium green function formalism ( negf ) .",
    "both molecular systems are sandwiched between two au(111 ) leads .",
    "[ negf_iv_curves ] shows the i - v curves without gate voltage ( black lines ) for the a ) anthraquinone and b ) picene-@xmath0 system .",
    "both curves show typical details which are expected from the i - v - characteristics of a molecular junction . due to the weak coupling of both molecular systems to the au(111 ) leads both systems show features which can be attributed to distinct molecular orbitals .    in a very simplified picture",
    "if bias voltage is rising then more orbitals will contribute to the conduction through the junction and the current increases .",
    "peaks or regions of negative differential resistance ( ndr ) occur if distinct levels contribute to the conduction on low bias and do not contribute in the case of high bias voltages due to e.g.  the lowering of the coupling strength between the molecular orbital and the lead @xcite .",
    "such a situation can be seen for example in the anthraquinone system at @xmath6 and @xmath7 bias voltage and for the picene-@xmath0 system at @xmath8 .",
    "the effect of increasing bias voltage on the electron transmission spectra of the two molecular junctions is depicted in fig .",
    "[ negf_iv_curves ] c ) and d ) respectively . in the zero bias transmission function",
    "the picene-@xmath0 -system ( solid line ) has a prominent feature at @xmath9 above the fermi level @xmath10 which can be attributed to the lumo level of the dimer .",
    "the features right below @xmath11 are therefore linked to the homo , homo-1 etc .",
    "dimer orbitals . above @xmath12 picene-@xmath0",
    "exhibits no features relevant to transport .",
    "the main effects of an applied bias voltage to a molecular junction are ( i ) shifting the transmission spectra with respect to @xmath13 , ( ii ) strengthening and dampening of transmission features due to the bias induced changes in the molecule - lead coupling and ( iii ) widening of the energy window in which transmission peaks contribute to the current . therefore if we apply a positive bias to the picene-@xmath0 junction we are shifting transmission features which correspond to occupied homo - n orbitals into the energy window relevant for conduction . for negative bias",
    "the transmission peaks originating from the homo and lumo are shifted out of that window and due to the large energy gap between the lumo and lumo+n levels ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : elevels]b ) there are no additional levels which can contribute to the conduction . only in the case of very high bias voltages @xmath14 additional transmission features can appear and the current starts to rise also for negative bias .",
    "for the anthraquinone junction the situation is completely different .",
    "we observe a somewhat lower density of transmission peaks for energies above @xmath11 ( see fig .",
    "[ negf_iv_curves]c ) .",
    "the changes in the bias voltage do not significantly change the overall density of transmission peaks in the energy window around @xmath11 contributing to the conduction .",
    "hence the absolute value of the current through the junction is approximately the same whether we apply a negative or positive bias voltage .",
    "our results are in good agreement with other theoretical estimates @xcite . in the picene-@xmath0 junction ( fig .",
    "[ negf_iv_curves]b ) the current for the negative bias case stays almost at zero up to an @xmath15 . for anthraquinone junction ( fig .",
    "[ negf_iv_curves]a ) the current rises more or less symmetrical in case of forward and reverse bias .",
    "this asymmetric behavior gives rise to large current rectification for the picene-@xmath0 system .",
    "the rectification ratio can be estimated by @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "we show a comparison of @xmath17 for the two systems in the voltage range of interest in fig .",
    "[ negf_ampl]b .",
    "the highest @xmath17 are achievable for very low values of @xmath18 however for real applications voltages between @xmath19 seem to be more manageable whereas higher bias voltages may lead to rapid degradation in the organic material @xcite . from our calculation",
    "we obtain rectification rations for @xmath20 which is much higher than the achievable maximum values for @xmath21 .",
    "moreover for the anthraquinone system we find a steep decrease of the rectification up to @xmath22 whereas the picene-@xmath0 systems shows only a weak dependence in the considered bias range . with its large",
    "rectification values the picene-@xmath0 -system also outweighs already reported maximum values for other charge transfer and molecular materials by a at least one order of magnitude @xcite .",
    "the low variability of @xmath23 over a wide bias range seems more appropriate for real world applications . in consequence",
    "we propose the picene-@xmath0 system as an molecular material to fabricate organic diodes due to its advantagoues forward and reverse bias properties .",
    "further , a required key element for implementing real molecular circuits is electrical switching .",
    "for that reason we compared the response of the two molecular systems to the application of an external gate voltage @xmath24 as schematically drawn in the insets of fig .",
    "[ negf_iv_curves ] .",
    "the i - v curves corresponding to a @xmath25 for the respective junctions are also shown as red lines in fig .",
    "[ negf_iv_curves]a and b. both systems show a rather strong response to the application of an external gate field . for better quantification of the effect",
    "the change of the current due to the applied gate voltage @xmath26 normalized to current without gate @xmath27 for both systems is presented in fig .",
    "[ negf_ampl]a .    for the anthraquinone junction",
    "we find a constant increase of the current for @xmath28 between a factor two and three .",
    "other authors report very large on / off ratios for anthraquinone junctions of @xmath29 .",
    "however these ratios are achieved by chemical modification of the molecule itself and are potentially irreversible in contrast to the electrical switching presented here .",
    "additionally the already mentioned theoretical @xcite as well as recently measured data @xcite on anthraquinone systems all show almost symmetrical behavior of the i - v characteristics .",
    "the additional gate field in the junction induces two main effects .",
    "first the gate voltage shifts the molecular energy levels with respect to the energy window in which molecular orbitals contribute to the conduction ( see @xcite ) . in the present case the positive gate voltage results in higher number of occupied molecular levels contributing and hence the current increases .",
    "the second effect of the gate field is the induction of changes of the electronic structure of the molecule itself .",
    "dft calculations on the anthraquinone molecule with an applied electric field equal to the gate field in the transport calculations indicate that for example the homo - lumo gap of the molecule is reduced and the molecular level alignment changes as well . in fig .",
    "[ negf_ampl]a one can see that the amplification of the current due to the gate field for the anthraquinone junction is almost symmetrical with respect to the bias voltage .",
    "the same effects of a gate field also occur in case of the picene junction .",
    "however , due to the asymmetric character of the molecular orbitals around the fermi level the impact on the i - v characteristics is much larger . under forward bias",
    "the current is barely affected by the gate voltage .",
    "in fact the current shows even a small decrease . for the reverse bias case",
    "however we see a large increase of the current due to gate voltage .",
    "we achieve an maximum current increase by about @xmath30 at @xmath31 . in fig .",
    "[ negf_ampl]c we additionally show the dependence of the reverse bias current of the picene-@xmath0 junction as a function of the applied gate voltage .",
    "as mentioned before the large energy distance between the lumo and lumo+1 leads to almost no transmission for reverse bias . as the gate field shifts the molecular levels we see of course an current increase .",
    "however this level shifting alone does not explain the quantity of the observed effect . here",
    "a further mechanism comes into play for the picene-@xmath0 system .",
    "as discussed in the beginning the picene-@xmath0 is a weakly bonded dimer with charge transfer of @xmath32 electrons from the picene to @xmath0 .",
    "our dft calculations on the picene-@xmath0 dimer with an electric field applied perpendicular to the stacking direction (= transport direction ) reveal that the hybridization of the dimer itself depends strongly on the applied field .",
    "the applied electric field allows to tune the hybridization between the dimer components .",
    "this allows to lower the lumo - lumo+n distance drastically .",
    "the result is , that in the reverse bias case with the gate field switched on , the number of levels which account to the conduction is increased .",
    "this explains the very large switching ratios of @xmath30 .",
    "in addition we wish to point out , that this behavior corresponds perfectly to the arguments given by ratner and coworkers @xcite for achieving molecular rectification .",
    "local weak links in a molecule , given in our case through the hybridization in the picene-@xmath0 dimer , can result in large rectification ratios whereas strong bonding suppresses the effect . by direct modification of the hybrid levels using a gate field",
    "one can reach effective current switching .",
    "we believe that this mechanism is quite general for charge transfer systems and should be applicable to other dimer systems as well @xcite .",
    "to summarize , the negf+dft studies of the anthraquinone - au(111 ) and picene-@xmath0 -au(111 ) systems have shown that the respective systems exhibit fundamentally different i - v characteristics .",
    "the anthraquinone system shows an approximately ohmic behavior for low bias voltages and the application of an external gate field results in an increase of the overall current through the junction which is almost symmetric for positive and negative bias voltages .",
    "due to hybrid dimer states close to the fermi level the picene-@xmath0 i - v curve is very asymmetric with a pronounced diode - like forward / reverse current behavior .",
    "in contrast to the anthraquinone system the effect of an applied gate voltage is about two orders of magnitude larger in the reverse bias than in the forward bias case .",
    "further , we have shown that the anthraquinone system can also be seen as a electrically controllable switch . however , in terms of achieving maximum switching ratios the picene-@xmath0 junction shows a clear benefit and can be seen as an molecular transistor in terms of classical circuit elements .",
    "the anthraquinone system on the other hand offers almost symmetric and linear i - v characteristics in the @xmath33 range and may be better utilized as operational amplifier .",
    "consequently , we propose to use the pure organic interface between picene and @xmath0 as a straightforward way to manufacture a molecular switch with very large switching ratio or a molecular transistor / amplifier .",

    "we especially thank the zih dresden for providing extensive computational resources and support .",
    "the ground state electronic structure of the molecules was investigated using the all - electron density functional theory ( dft ) nrlmol program package which achieves a high level of numerical accuracy ( see @xcite and references therein ) . for the exchange correlation gga / pbe @xcite was used and in all calculations dispersion correction utilizing the dft - d2 method @xcite was included .",

    "is obtained by dft calculations using the common approach of constructing a model device where the molecule of interest together with additional electrode atoms ( scattering region ) are sandwiched between two semi - infinite ( metallic ) electrodes . in our case",
    "we used at least three additional au(111 ) layers on each side of the molecule to construct the scattering region followed by a further geometry optimization step of the system where the topmost two gold layers together with the attached molecules were allowed to relax . for the scattering region as well as for the leads a localized double-@xmath35 polarized basis set was used .",
