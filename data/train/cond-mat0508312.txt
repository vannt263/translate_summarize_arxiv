    "the sudden change of the group velocity , so - called  kink \" , of the dispersing peak in angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) spectra is widely reported in the high - temperature superconducting cuprates.@xcite nevertheless , the interpretations of the kink have been controversial . in previous works , electronic coupling to a bosonic mode such as phonons@xcite or magnetic excitations@xcite has been discussed as its origin .",
    "recently , we have found a similar kink of the layered strontium ruthenates,@xcite meaning that the kink is not peculiar to the cuprates .",
    "the layered ruthenates are isostructural to the cuprates , while the electronic and magnetic properties are quite different .",
    "the electronic structure close to the fermi level ( @xmath5 ) of the layered ruthenates is derived not only from the in - plane ru @xmath2@xmath6o @xmath7 band but also from the out - of - plane ru 4@xmath8@xmath6o 2@xmath9 ones , while for the cuprates the single in - plane cu 3@xmath10@xmath6o 2@xmath9 band plays a crucial role .",
    "therefore , arpes study on the layered ruthenates is expected to provide insight into the origin of the kink in transition - metal oxides .",
    "the monolayer ruthenate sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 have attracted significant attention since the spin - triplet superconductivity was discovered below @xmath11=1.5 k.@xcite the electronic bands near @xmath5 are derived mainly from the ru @xmath12 orbitals ; the band near @xmath5 due to the in - plane ru @xmath2 orbital exhibits two - dimensional ( 2d ) character with a large energy dispersion , while the bands due to the out - of - plane ru 4@xmath13 and 4@xmath14 orbitals exhibit nearly 1d character with a small energy dispersion .",
    "previous arpes and de haas - van alphen ( dhva ) studies showed the fermi surface ( fs ) exhibiting one hole sheet ( @xmath15 ) and two electron sheets ( @xmath16 and @xmath17),@xcite qualitatively consistent with the band - structure calculation based on the local density approximation ( lda).@xcite it should be noted that except for the vicinity of the high symmetry line @xmath18 , the @xmath15 and @xmath16 sheets are derived from the ru @xmath3 and @xmath4 orbitals , while the remaining @xmath17 sheet is from the ru @xmath2 orbital . moreover , along the @xmath18 line , it is difficult to assign the orbital character to each sheet because those bands approach one another towards @xmath5 and the hybridization among the different orbitals becomes significant ( see fig .",
    "the experimental geometry in our previous work was this,@xcite and hence we could not observe any conclusive relationship between the kink and the orbital , although such information should provide a key to elucidate the origin of the kink . in this paper , we present detailed band dispersion of sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 not along the @xmath18 line but the @xmath19 and @xmath20 lines , determined by high - resolution arpes , to elucidate the orbital selectivity of the kink . the spectral intensity of the band near the @xmath21 point along the @xmath19 line is drastically reduced with increasing the angle of the incidence of the light , indicating that the band has the in - plane @xmath2 orbital character . a kink in the dispersion is clearly shown for this _ xy _ band , while not for the @xmath22 and @xmath23 ones .",

    "[ fs ] shows the fss of sr@xmath24ruo@xmath25 , recorded at a high - resolution and high - flux undulator beamline ( bl-28 ) of the photon factory .",
    "since the fss are consistent with the lda band - structure calculation@xcite ( white lines ) and the previous arpes result,@xcite the quality of our samples should be high enough to investigate detailed band dispersions .",

    "the spectral feature in the vicinity of the @xmath21 point becomes obscure as @xmath44 is increased .",

    "[ fig4 ] ( d ) and ( e ) ] . in our previous study along the @xmath18",
    "line,@xcite the kink was observed in the @xmath15 and/or @xmath17 fs sheets derived from the out - of - plane ru @xmath3 and @xmath4 orbitals , which seems to be contrary to the present case . except for near the @xmath18 line , however , we confirmed by the fs mapping that the kink is clearly observed for @xmath17 fs sheet derived from the in - plane @xmath2 orbital , while not for @xmath15 and @xmath16 fs sheets derived from the out - of - plane ru @xmath3 and @xmath4 orbitals.@xcite hence , we believe that the kink essentially exists only in @xmath17 fs sheet out of the three fs sheets . here , we estimate the mass enhancement with respect to the band theory of the @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 fs sheets to be 2.0 , 2.0 and 3.7 , respectively .",
    "these values are qualitatively consistent with the cyclotron mass in the previous dhva studies.@xcite consequently , the effective mass of the @xmath17 fs sheet , which shows the kink , is substantially enhanced in contrast to those of the @xmath15 and @xmath16 fs sheets .",
    "as an origin of the observed mass enhancement , one can first raise the on - site ru _ d - d _ coulomb interaction @xmath51 .",
    "previous photoemission studies have estimated @xmath51 to be 1.3@xmath261.5 ev.@xcite on the other hand , the band theory predicts a roughly 3.5 ev wide in - plane _ xy _ band , and a narrow ( 1.4 ev width ) out - of - plane _ yz _ and _ zx _ bands near @xmath5.@xcite therefore , a larger mass enhancement should be expected for the _ zx _ band due to the substantial influence of the coulomb correlations , rather than for the _ xy _ band , contrary to the arpes results . according to the perturbation theory and quantum monte carlo calculations for a multiband hamiltonian,@xcite the narrow _ yz _ and _ zx _ bands are more strongly distorted by the coulomb correlations than the wide _ xy _ band .",
    "the charge is , then , partially transferred from the _ yz _ and _ zx _ bands to the _ xy _ band , leading that the van hove singularity of the _ xy _ band at the @xmath21 point shifts toward @xmath5 .",
    "based on this picture , it seems reasonable to suppose that the effective mass for the _ xy _ band is enhanced from the lda band mass due to the charge transfer .",
    "however , this should be accompanied by a shift of @xmath43 for the _ xy _ band , which is not the case in the arpes spectra .",
    "thus the mass enhancement for the _ xy _ band is probably caused not by the coulomb correlations but by the kink as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig4 ] ( b ) and ( c ) .",
    "then what is the origin of the kink of the _ xy _ band ? in recent works on the cuprates , the kink was related to bosonic modes such as phonons@xcite or magnetic excitations.@xcite manske , eremin , and bennemann@xcite predicted a kink of sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 due to incommensurate antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations at @xmath52 based on the nesting properties of the quasi-1d @xmath15 and @xmath16 bands.@xcite according to this prediction , the quasiparticles should be strongly renormalized due to coupling with the spin fluctuations for the @xmath15 and @xmath16 bands .",
    "however , the observed kink was not in the @xmath15 nor @xmath16 bands but in the @xmath17 band .",
    "recent neutron experiments revealed another weak and broadened magnetic structure around @xmath53 , attributed to the excitation from the @xmath17 band , in addition to the magnetic fluctuations at @xmath54.@xcite currently , we have no definite information on the relationship between the magnetic fluctuations at @xmath55 and the electronic structure presented here .",
    "on the other hand , matzdorf _ et al .",
    "_ suggested the strong coupling between the phonon mode corresponding to the in - plane octahedron rotation with the @xmath56 symmetry , which was shown by neutron experiments,@xcite and ferromagnetic ( fm ) spin fluctuations.@xcite it is possible that the @xmath56 phonon mode couples strongly with the ru 4@xmath49 orbital but not with the ru 4@xmath13 and 4@xmath14 orbitals , because the kink appears only in the _ xy _ band in our result .    assuming the strong coupling between the electronic structure and the phonons , which is clearly indicated by the oxygen isotope effect on @xmath11 of sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1,@xcite we discuss the origin of the kink shortly.@xcite in a previous raman study , the electron - phonon interaction for the apical oxygen vibration modes was observed.@xcite however , it may be difficult to consider that the kink is caused by the effective coupling between the zone - center apical oxygen phonon modes and the in - plane _ xy _ band with the kink . directly relating to the in - plane ru 4@xmath49",
    "orbital , there are four in - plane oxygen phonon modes at the zone - center for the tetragonal k@xmath0nif@xmath1 structure ; @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and two @xmath59 .",
    "the @xmath57 and @xmath58 modes are the out - of - plane out - of - phase and out - of - plane in - phase vibrations of in - plane oxygen atoms , respectively .",
    "the remaining two @xmath59 modes are related with the zone boundary in - plane oxygen - stretching longitudinal optical phonon , observed in the cuprates,@xcite and the zone - boundary in - plane oxygen - rotation phonon@xcite due to the fm fluctuations as mentioned above.@xcite on the other hand , devereaux _ et al . _",
    "recently suggested for the bilayer cuprate bi2212 that the out - of - plane , out - of - phase oxygen buckling mode ( @xmath60 ) couples strongly with the electronic states near the ( @xmath35,0 ) point,@xcite in agreement with arpes spectra.@xcite this @xmath60 mode for the bilayer cuprate corresponds to the @xmath57 mode for the monolayer sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 . in order to estimate the energy of the @xmath57 mode , which is silent in raman scattering ,",
    "we calculated the phonon dispersion relation using the simple constant force model and the optical spectra.@xcite the obtained energy ( @xmath2640 mev ) is comparable with the binding energy of the kink of the _ xy _ band in figs .",
    "[ fig4 ] ( b ) and ( c ) .",
    "hence , we believe that the @xmath59 and @xmath57 modes are strong candidates to explain the kink , although more detailed studies on the phonon modes are needed .",
    "in summary , we have found orbital selectivity of the kink in the dispersion of sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 by arpes measurements along the @xmath19 and @xmath20 lines .",
    "the kink is clearly observed for @xmath17 fs sheet derived from the in - plane ru @xmath2 orbital , while not for @xmath15 and @xmath16 fs sheets derived from the out - of - plane ru @xmath3 and @xmath4 orbitals , respectively .",
