    "the study of absorption line systems in the spectra of quasars ( qsos ) has been useful in detecting distant normal field galaxies situated close to the lines of sight of qsos .",
    "conventionally , all such absorbers with velocity @xmath5 @xmath6  relative to the background qso are believed to be associated to the qso itself ( ` associated systems ' ) while those at larger velocity offset are believed to be entirely independent of background qso .",
    "this general belief was questioned recently by the puzzling results on the abundance of strong absorber having equivalent width ( @xmath7 ) more than 1.0   : ( i ) by @xcite where they found @xmath8 time excess of strong absorber towards the @xmath9 ray burst ( grb ) sources relative to qso sight lines ( see also ) , and ( ii ) by , where they found similar excess by a factor of about 2 ( 3 @xmath10 confidence ) towards 45 blazar sight lines .",
    "these counter - intuitive results , have inspired many alternative explanations , such as dust extinction towards qso sight lines which can lower the apparent incidence rate of absorbers , or gravitational lensing which can increase it toward grbs / blazars , but none have been found to explain the above discrepancies .",
    "however the blazars , as a class , are believed to have relativistic jet pointed close to our line of sight . speculated that such powerful jets in the blazars are capable of sweeping sufficiently large column densities of gas ( up to @xmath11 ) and accelerating such clouds to velocities of order @xmath12 , thereby possibly accounting for the excess of absorption systems towards blazars in comparison with qsos .",
    "however , such an excess in number of absorbers per unit redshift ( @xmath13 ) was not confirmed in the analysis of flat - spectrum radio quasars ( fsrqs ) by @xcite , though fsrqs also possess powerful jets similar to blazars , which they reconciled with the above hypothesis of relativistically ejected absorbing clouds , by suggesting that perhaps due to larger angle from the line of sight ( unlike blazars with smaller angle ) , these accelerated clouds might not intersect the line - of - sight in the case of fsrqs . using a larger sample size of 95 grb ( including 12 grb from @xcite ) , @xcite did not confirm the original enhancement found in the case of grb by @xcite , though a signature of mild excess of about 1.5 times was noticed for strong absorption systems , albeit with only a low confidence level of 90% .",
    "the firm conclusion for jet based above excess still await the realistic numerical modelling of jet - ambient gas interaction especially for the excess seen towards blazars ( about a factor of 2 ) and cdqs ( about 10% ) @xcite vis - a - vis normal qsos .",
    "however an alternative scenario , which could be more plausible , is the dust or radiation driven outflows ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "for instance , if there is some contribution to @xmath13 of strong absorber from these outflows , then one will expect that agn luminosity should have statistical correlation with the velocity offset of the strong absorber relative to the background agn , which is usually defined by , @xmath14 where @xmath0 , @xmath15 is the emission redshift of the qso and @xmath16 is the absorption redshift of the system .    in this letter",
    "we report a correlation between the @xmath2 of strong absorbers and the bolometric luminosity ( @xmath1 ) of qsos , using the strong absorber catalogue by .",
    "we also propose an explanation for this correlation which draws upon radiation driven outflow models . in ",
    "2 we describe the sample of strong absorbers and our selection criteria . in ",
    "3 we present our results and a theoretical model of radiation driven outflows . in ",
    "4 we study the fractional number counts of absorbers , and discuss our results in  5 .",
    "we consider a sample of 10367 strong absorbers with equivalent width @xmath17  belonging to 9144 qsos , from the recent compilation by based on 105783 qsos of sdss dr7 @xcite .",
    "however , the range of @xmath2 varies with @xmath15 , and the observed wavelength range of the spectrum .",
    "therefore , in order to make the sample unbiased , firstly , we have considered a sdss spectral range from 4000 - 9000  which is a little narrower ( by about 100  ) than the actual one .",
    "we then applied the following four selection filters .    1 .",
    "we removed 773 broad absorption line ( bal ) qsos from our above sample to avoid any contamination in our analysis by bal features which has resulted in the removal of corresponding 931 strong absorbers .",
    "2 .   for all the quasars having @xmath18",
    ", the emission line will fall above 9000  , which is our conservative upper limit on wavelength of sdss spectrum . as a result , sdss spectra for such sources will not allow any detection of strong doublet falling in the redshift range between 2.21024 up to @xmath15 . therefore to avoid this observational bias , we excluded all sources having @xmath19 from our sample , which resulted in the removal of 43 qsos having 52 strong mg ii absorbers .",
    "3 .   another filter was applied to avoid the observational bias which might result from the lower wavelength limit , viz 4000  , in the sdss spectra . in our analysis",
    "we aim to see any correlation of luminosity with velocity offset up to about 0.4c .",
    "however for 4000   considered as the conservative starting wavelength of our spectra , @xmath20 will be the minimum redshift , which allows us to detect absorber ( if any ) at least up to a velocity offset of @xmath21 .",
    "therefore , we have removed 1461 sightlines with @xmath22 having 1544 strong absorbers in their spectra .",
    "4 .   after applying the above mentioned redshift cuts , we are left with the systems with @xmath23 . in these intermediate redshift systems ,",
    "the @xmath2 value can be larger than @xmath24 , which in principle may give rise to a bias of higher @xmath2 with increasing @xmath15 .",
    "hence we also remove all the absorbers with @xmath25 from the remaining sample which amounts to exclusion of 1523 absorbers along 1439 sightlines .",
    "one should note that @xmath26 is chosen because if we keep @xmath2 value less or greater than this , then the sample is significantly reduced .",
    "another motivation as will be clear in the coming sections , is that @xmath27 is an upper limit for the radiation ( dust ) driven outflows .    finally ,",
    "we are left with 6317 strong systems along 5682 qsos in the selected redshift range .",
    "bolometric luminosities for the qsos in sdss dr7 are calculated in a recent study by @xcite .",
    "we cross matched the qsos in our sample , with the catalogue described in shen s paper to obtain the bolometric luminosity .",
    "we then removed two more absorbers whose qso luminosities were @xmath28 erg s@xmath29 .",
    "our final bias free sample consists of 6315 strong systems with luminosity range @xmath30 erg s@xmath29 , with redshift range @xmath31 , and with the velocity offset range of @xmath32 . in figure 1",
    ", the blue dashed line represents the distribution of strong mg ii absorbers in sdss - dr7 , compiled by , and the black solid line is the final sample selected for this study .     of the samples of strong absorbers in sdss - dr7 .",
    "the blue dashed line is for 10367 strong absorbers compiled by .",
    "the black solid line represents the sample used in this work . ]",
    "in order to test the dependence of @xmath2 on luminosity , we divide the sample in bins of bolometric luminosity .",
    "most of the absorbers ( 5651 out of 6315 ) belong to qso sightlines having a luminosity range @xmath34 erg s@xmath29 .",
    "we divide these 5651 systems into four bins of bolometric luminosity .",
    "we also have two more bins , one for @xmath35 erg s@xmath29 , and another with @xmath36 erg s@xmath29 , the first having 27 systems and the second with 637 systems .",
    "consider the case of the absorbers being distributed uniformly in the allowed range of @xmath16 ( which in turn is determined from the allowed range of @xmath2 ) , then the median value of @xmath2 should be independent of @xmath15 ( see appendix a for a proof ) .",
    "hence , irrespective of the distribution of @xmath15 in a luminosity bin , the median value of beta should be same in all luminosity bins . to test this hypothesis",
    ", we estimate the median , the lower 25 percentile and the upper 25 percentile of data in each of the above mentioned six luminosity bins .",
    "we plot the median with circles , and the upper and lower percentiles as the end points of vertical dotted bars in figure 2 .     of absorber .",
    "the circles represent the median of data in a particular luminosity bin .",
    "the upper and lower extreme of the dotted vertical lines give the location of upper and lower 25 percentile , respectively .",
    "sizes of the luminosity bins are shown by the horizontal bars .",
    "the solid , dotted and dash - dotted line represent the theoretical model discussed in  3.1 . ]",
    "interestingly , we find that the median is not constant .",
    "the data shows a correlation of @xmath2 with the @xmath1 .",
    "the 5651 absorbers systems with @xmath37 erg s@xmath29 , which form the mainstay of the sample show a power law increase of @xmath2 with @xmath1 , with a slope of @xmath38 .",
    "increase of median value of @xmath2 with the bolometric luminosity , proves that the distribution in each bin is not uniform random .",
    "this fact is also hinted in the evolution of @xmath13 with @xmath16 @xcite . using the evolution in @xmath13 for our sample",
    ", we evaluated the expected relation between the median value of @xmath2 and @xmath15 from equation ( [ app_med ] ) .",
    "we then converted it to the corresponding relation between @xmath2 and luminosity by using the best fit relation between @xmath15 and luminosity , a characteristic of magnitude limited survey such as sdss .",
    "we have shown this relation using a dashed curve in figure 2 .",
    "although the dashed curve does show some evolution , but it is clear that it can not fully explain the observed @xmath39 correlation",
    ".    which physical processes can give rise to non - uniformity of absorber distribution ?",
    "the evolution in @xmath13 has been attributed to the evolution in global star formation rate @xcite , although without any concrete evidence .",
    "also , observations of intervening galaxies show a small covering fraction ( @xmath40 ) for strong absorbers ( @xmath41  ) @xcite . here",
    "we explore an alternate based on outflows associated with qsos , which can give rise to non - uniformity of incidence of absorbers . as we explore in next section ,",
    "the relation @xmath42 , is a natural consequence of qso radiation driven outflows .",
    "radiation driven outflows have been invoked repeatedly in literature to explain the co - evolution of black hole and bulge , to explain the accretion disc winds ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and galactic winds ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we consider here the radiation driven outflows , where the photons scatter the dust grains and impart their momentum to dust .",
    "the dust in turn is collisionally coupled to the gas , and the momentum is uniformly distributed to the dust and gas mixture . in this scenario , the motion of dust and gas mixture surrounding the qso is governed by the following equation , @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the mass of the black bole and @xmath45 is the dark matter halo potential .",
    "@xmath46 is the integrated uv luminosity and for qsos where the main emission is in high frequency bands , luminosity over uv and euv bands is roughly half of the bolometric luminosity ( @xmath47)@xcite .",
    "@xmath48 is the frequency averaged opacity for the scattering and absorption of uv photons by dust grains . for wavelength of photon @xmath49 m",
    ", the @xmath48 for a dust and gas mixture ranges from 200 to as large as 1000 @xmath50g@xmath29 @xcite .",
    "we take a value @xmath51 @xmath50g@xmath29 , which roughly serves as an average effective value of opacity .",
    "we can integrate equation ( [ eq_diff ] ) to obtain the following expression for velocity @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the launching radius of the outflow . in the case of radiation pressure on dust grains ,",
    "the opacity is generally quite high and hence the radiation force is many times larger than the gravity , therefore the gravitational force can be neglected . at a large distance",
    "the velocity attains the following terminal value @xmath54 the base radius ( @xmath53 ) for launching these outflows is an important factor and it should be the minimum distance at which the dust grains can survive . studies on dust survival yield following relation between the sublimation radius of the dust grains and the luminosity of the agn @xcite , @xmath55 the value of @xmath56 is @xmath57 pc for graphite grains and @xmath58 pc for the silicate grains . substituting equation ( [ eq_mor ] ) into ( [ wind_easy ] ) , we obtain the following expression for wind terminal speed , @xmath59 we note that this mechanism has previously been discussed in the context of agn outflows by @xcite .",
    "these authors also arrived at similar terminal speed for a radiation driven outflow .",
    "we plot this scaling to compare with the observed correlation of @xmath2 and @xmath1 in figure 2 .",
    "the dash - dotted , solid and dotted line in figure 2 correspond to @xmath60 pc respectively .",
    "we find that this simple theoretical model fits the observed correlation pretty well , which indicates that the absorber systems are likely to be radiation(dust ) driven outflows .",
    "one is then tempted to ask as to how these outflows fit in the unification schemes of agn .",
    "we find that the launching radius of the outflows is the dust sublimation radius , which is also the inner radius of the dusty torus . inside the torus , the uv photons",
    "are quickly reprocessed into ir .",
    "although the ir photons can also drive outflows @xcite , however the speeds would not be large , as the ir to dust scattering cross section is more than an order of magnitude smaller than in uv .",
    "one possible way to reconcile this is the following .",
    "let us suppose that the outflows do not plough through the main body of the torus , but consist of material lifted from the outer surface of the torus . in that case , as the torus material is dilute and highly porous at its periphery , the uv photons can in principle travel a large distance without being attenuated and impart their momentum to gas and dust mixture lifted from the outer surface of the torus .",
    "more specifically , in the picture presented in @xcite , the region which we are considering should take place between the bal envelope and the torus .",
    "we note that , this scenario not only gives rise to large velocity outflows , but it may also account for the small fraction ( @xmath61 ) of the qsos which show these absorbers owing to the fact that the region allowed for the outflows ( periphery of the torus ) occupies a very small fraction of the viewing angle .",
    "next we study the dependence of fractional number counts of absorbers as a function of qso luminosity .",
    "we define the fractional number count as below , @xmath62 again , we limit our analysis to the spectral region with @xmath63 . from our sample , as described in  2 , we can easily estimate the  number of absorbers found \" in a given luminosity bin , having @xmath63 .",
    "however to find the corresponding  number of qsos searched in a bin \" , we also need to count those qsos in the parent sample of sdss - dr7 from which the qsos with absorbers are selected .",
    "we use the parent catalogue from @xcite of which the sample used in this work is a subset .",
    "therefore , we estimate the  number of qsos searched in a bin \" by using non - bal qsos from shen et al ( 2012 ) catalogue , which satisfy the redshift criteria @xmath64 , to ensure the absence of any observational biases ( see  2 ) .    we plot the fractional number count as a function of luminosity ( @xmath1 ) in figure 3 .",
    "the values are shown by filled diamonds whose x - coordinate is the centre of each luminosity bin .",
    "we also show the overall average of the sample using a horizontal line , whose value is @xmath65 .",
    "we find that the fraction increases steeply with increasing qso luminosity and reaches a maximum roughly for @xmath66 erg s@xmath29 .",
    "for @xmath67 erg s@xmath29 there is a mild decrease with luminosity , however this decrease is uncertain as in this bin , we have many apparently faint high redshift quasars , for which the signal to noise criterion removes large chunks of spectra and the corresponding absorbers ( d. lawther pvt . comm . ) .",
    "we note that the fractional number of absorbers has a contribution from outflowing and intervening systems , which we can not separate here .",
    "we would like to emphasize an important point in connection with our result .",
    "there is a general consensus in the literature , which goes along the line that the absorbers which have @xmath68 ( @xmath69 km s@xmath29 ) , are associated with the qso and with @xmath2 higher than this represent the intervening media .",
    "we stress here that this criterion is not adequate to denote the associated systems , and the true associated systems can also have @xmath70 , e.g. the qso driven high velocity outflows considered here .",
    "to illustrate this , we plot in figure 4 , the ratio of absorbers with @xmath68 to the total number of absorbers in a particular luminosity bin as a function of bolometric luminosity .",
    "one can clearly see that lower @xmath2 are possible for only lower luminosity , and vice versa .",
    "firstly , the figure once again confirms that the velocity offset @xmath2 is correlated with luminosity , because low @xmath2 absorbers appear along the sightlines of low luminosity qsos .",
    "secondly , this plot , in conjunction with the correlation of @xmath2 with @xmath1 , shows that the systems which are really ` _ associated _ ' with the qsos are spread all the way from @xmath71 to @xmath24 .",
    "our results call for a study to separate out the truly associated ( outflowing ) systems and the intervening ones .",
    "of course , one tedious way to do this is to locate the intervening galaxies in each quasar sightline , however yet another way can be through the detailed study of line shapes and features arising from outflows and intervening material .",
    "we look forward to such a study in the future .     to the total number of quasars in a particular luminosity bin",
    "is plotted against the bolometric luminosity .",
    "the horizontal bar represents the size of the luminosity bin .",
    "]    there is another implication of the observed dependence of fractional number count of absorbers on qso luminosity .",
    "if one considers a sample of a particular type of qsos that covers a restricted luminosity range , then the relative number of absorbers may differ for different samples , and be different from the overall average .",
    "if we consider the right side of figure 3 , corresponding to @xmath72 erg / s , there the fractional number counts are roughly double of the overall average value of @xmath73 .",
    "we note that recent observations of @xmath74 blazars report an excess of absorbers relative to that in qsos .",
    "we speculate here that this excess may also arise from the fact that the blazar sample is small , and it may be possible that it is biased towards higher luminosity , where the fractional number count is larger .",
    "it is possible that if the analysis is repeated with a larger sample of blazars then the excess may fade away .",
    "in fact , a similar conclusion has been reached for a sample of fsrqs and @xmath75 lobe and core dominated qsos where in both cases one finds only a mild excess @xcite . in this",
    "regard we bring a recent paper by @xcite to the attention of the reader , regarding the excess seen towards grbs , where with a large sample of grbs the puzzle of incidence rate indeed disappears , and one does not find any excess .    in summary",
    ", we have found a correlation between the velocity offset of strong absorbers and the luminosity of qsos .",
    "the velocity offset ( @xmath76 ) has been found to increase with the luminosity with a power law index @xmath3 .",
    "we have found that radiation driven outflows from qsos can give rise to such a dependence of @xmath2 on @xmath1 .",
    "these findings lead us to conclude that a significant fraction of strong absorbers ( even with @xmath77 @xmath6  ) along qso sightlines may be the agn driven outflows .",
    "we are grateful to d. lawther for supplying the redshift path data .",
    "we thank an anonymous referee for insightful comments .",
    "from equation ( 1 ) , we know that @xmath2 mainly depends on the difference of @xmath78 and @xmath79 . here",
    "we address the question whether or not the median value of @xmath2 which we have computed over its fixed range varying from @xmath80 , depends on the value of @xmath15 . for maximum value of @xmath81 , the lower limit of @xmath16 , using equation ( 1 )",
    "is given by @xmath82 where @xmath83 is a constant whose value is 0.65 for @xmath84 .",
    "the median value of absorber redshift ( @xmath85 ) is the solution of following equation , @xmath86 where @xmath13 is the number of absorbers per unit redshift .",
    "if the absorbers are distributed uniformly and the quantity @xmath13 is constant , then from equation ( [ app_med ] ) we get , @xmath87 using equation ( 1 ) we find the corresponding median value of @xmath2 , which is @xmath88 independent of @xmath15 .",
    "however , the observed @xmath89 evolves with luminosity ( and @xmath15 ) , which indicates that absorbers are not distributed uniformly ."
