    "the proper euclidean geometry has been constructed by euclid many years ago .",
    "the euclidean geometry was created as a logical construction , describing the mutual disposition of geometrical objects in the space .",
    "the main object of the euclidean geometry is the point , i.e. the geometrical object , which has no size .",
    "the straight is the geometrical object which is a continuous set of points .",
    "the straight has a length , but it has no thickness . the plane is a continuous set of parallel straights .",
    "the complicated geometrical objects are combinations of more simple geometrical objects . the simplest geometrical objects ( points , straights , planes , etc . )",
    "are called elementary geometrical objects ( ego ) .",
    "the euclidean geometry is homogeneous and isotropic , and all identical egos have identical properties in all places of the space .",
    "properties of elementary geometrical objects ( ego ) are postulated , and properties of more complicated geometrical objects are obtained by logical reasonings from the axioms , describing properties of egos .",
    "the distance between two points @xmath5 and @xmath6 in the euclidean geometry is introduced as a number , describing the relation between the straight intercept @xmath7 and some universal scale intercept @xmath8 . in the euclidean presentation of the euclidean geometry",
    "the distance is a derivative numerical quantity , which is not used at the euclidean geometry construction .    on the one hand ,",
    "the euclidean geometry is a logical construction , on the other hand , it is a science on the mutual disposition of geometrical objects .",
    "thus , there are two aspects of the euclidean geometry .",
    "any other geometry is obtained as the euclidean geometry generalization .",
    "one can generalize the euclidean geometry , considering it as a logical structure . in this case",
    "we change properties of egos , i.e. change axioms of the euclidean geometry . as a result",
    "we obtain another homogeneous geometries ( affine geometry , projective geometry , symplectic geometry , etc . ) . in general , any logical construction , which contains concepts of point and straight , can be considered to be a geometry .",
    "we shall refer to such a geometry as the mathematical geometry , because such geometries are interesting mainly for mathematicians , which train their mathematical and logical capacities , creating and investigating such geometries .",
    "the geometry as a science on mutual disposition of geometrical objects is interesting mainly for physicists , which use it , describing physical phenomena in the space and in the space - time .",
    "such a geometry will be referred to as a physical geometry .",
    "the main characteristic of the physical geometry is the distance between two arbitrary points of the space .",
    "a generalization of the euclidean geometry is obtained as a result of a deformation of the euclidean space . at such a deformation the distance between points is changed .",
    "the identical egos in different places becomes to be various and the obtained generalized geometry becomes inhomogeneous .",
    "in such a geometry one can not use axioms , because the identical egos become various after inhomogeneous deformation .",
    "the generalization of the euclidean geometry can not be produced in the same way , as it is produced in the mathematical geometry .",
    "well known mathematician felix klein @xcite believed that only the homogeneous geometry deserves to be called a geometry .",
    "it is his opinion that the riemannian geometry ( in general , inhomogeneous geometry ) should be qualified as a riemannian geography , or a riemannian topography . in other words , felix klein considered a geometry mainly as a logical construction .",
    "we seem that the qualification of the riemannian geometry as a physical geometry is more appropriate , than the riemannian topography , although this point is not essential .",
    "it is much more important that the physical geometry and the mathematical geometry are quite different buildings , because their construction is founded on different principles .    in this paper",
    "we shall consider only physical geometry , where the mutual position of geometrical objects is the principal object of investigation .",
    "the mutual position of geometrical objects can be described by distance @xmath2 , which is given for all pairs of points @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the set of all points of the space . usually instead of the distance @xmath2",
    "one considers the quantity @xmath11 , known as the world function @xcite . the world function is real even in the space - time geometry , where @xmath2 may be imaginary .",
    "it is very important that the world function of the euclidean geometry is the unique quantity , which is necessary for description of the proper euclidean geometry . in other words , _ the proper euclidean geometry can be described completely in terms and only in terms of the world function _ @xmath4 of the euclidean space .",
    "this statement is a very important theorem of the euclidean geometry , which can be proved in the framework of the euclidean geometry .",
    "this theorem is a foundation for construction of all physical geometries .",
    "the property of a physical geometry of being described completely by means of the world function will be referred to as the @xmath0-immanence property of this geometry .",
    "we formulate this important theorem on the @xmath0-immanence of the euclidean geometry below , as soon as the necessary technique will be developed . here",
    "we do note that the proper euclidean geometry can be constructed as a mathematical geometry without a reference to the concept of the distance , or of the world function .",
    "the world function @xmath4 of the euclidean space may be introduced , when the proper euclidean geometry has been already constructed .",
    "thus we do not need the world function for the proper euclidean geometry construction .",
    "the @xmath0-immanence property of the euclidean geometry was discovered rather recently @xcite .",
    "it has been proved that the euclidean geometry can be presented in terms and only in terms of the function @xmath12 , provided the function @xmath4 satisfies a series of constraints , written in terms of @xmath4 . by definition , _",
    "any geometry is a totality of all geometric objects _",
    "@xmath13 _ _  and of all relations _ _ @xmath14 _ _  between them__. the @xmath0-immanence of the proper euclidean geometry means that any geometric object @xmath15 and any relation @xmath16 of the euclidean geometry @xmath17 can be presented in terms of the euclidean world function @xmath4 in the form @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "let us suppose that any physical geometry @xmath3 has the property of the @xmath0-immanence .",
    "then the geometry @xmath3 may be constructed as a result of a deformation of the proper euclidean geometry @xmath17 .",
    "indeed , the proper euclidean geometry @xmath20 is the totality of geometrical objects @xmath21 and relations @xmath22 .",
    "we produce the change    @xmath23    then totality of geometrical objects @xmath24 , relations @xmath25 and the world function @xmath0 form the physical geometry @xmath3 .",
    "for instance , let the geometrical object @xmath21 be a sphere @xmath26 , passing through the point @xmath6 and with the center at the point @xmath27 .",
    "we have in the proper euclidean geometry @xmath28 the geometrical object @xmath29 @xmath30 is the sphere @xmath31 in the physical geometry @xmath3 .",
    "let @xmath19 be the scalar product @xmath32 of two vectors @xmath33 , @xmath34 in @xmath17 .",
    "it can be written in the @xmath0-immanent form ( i.e. in terms of the world function @xmath4 ) @xmath35where index e shows that the quantity relates to the euclidean geometry .",
    "it is easy to see that ( [ h1.3 ] ) is a corollary of the euclidean relations @xmath36@xmath37    according to ( [ h1.2 ] ) in the physical geometry @xmath3 we obtain instead of ( [ h1.3 ] ) @xmath38    such a way of the physical geometry construction is very simple .",
    "it does not use any logical reasonings .",
    "it is founded on the supposition that _ any physical geometry has the _",
    "@xmath0__-immanence property__. it uses essentially the fact that the proper euclidean geometry has been already constructed , and all necessary logical reasonings has been already produced in the proper euclidean geometry .    the application of the replacement ( [ h1.2 ] ) to the construction of a physical geometry will be referred to as the deformation principle .",
    "any change of distance @xmath2 , or the world function @xmath0 between the points of the space @xmath10 means a deformation of this space .",
    "we construe the concept of deformation in a broad sense .",
    "the deformation may transform a point into a surface and a surface into a point .",
    "the deformation may remove some points of the euclidean space , violating its continuity , or decreasing its dimension . the deformation may add supplemental points to the euclidean space , increasing its dimension .",
    "we may interpret any @xmath0-immanent generalization of the euclidean geometry as its deformation .",
    "in other words , the deformation principle is a very general method of the generalized geometry construction .",
    "the physical geometry constructed on the basis of the deformation principle will be referred to as the tubular geometry ( t - geometry ) @xcite .",
    "such a name is used , because in the t - geometry the straight lines have , in general , a shape of hallow tubes , which in some t - geometries may degenerate into one - dimensional curves . at this point",
    "the t - geometry distinguishes from the riemannian geometry , where the straight line ( geodesic ) is one - dimensional by its construction .",
    "construction of a nonhomogeneous geometry on the axiomatic basis is impossible practically , because there is a lot of different nonhomogeneous geometries .",
    "it is very difficult to invent axiomatics for a nonhomogeneous geometry , where identical objects have different properties in various places . besides",
    ", one can not invent axiomatics for each of these geometries .",
    "thus , in reality there is no alternative to application of the deformation principle at the construction of the physical geometry .",
    "the real problem consists in the sequential application of the deformation principle .",
    "as far as the _ deformation principle alone is sufficient for the construction of the physical geometry _ , one may not use additional means of the geometry construction . at the physical geometry construction",
    "we do not use coordinate system and other means of descriptions .",
    "usually a construction of the riemannian geometry is carried out in some coordinate system .",
    "the riemannian geometry is obtained from the euclidean one by means of the deformation principle , i.e. by the change infinitesimal euclidean distance @xmath39 by means of the riemannian one @xmath40 .",
    "properties of the riemannian geometry are determined by the form of the metric tensor @xmath41 .",
    "but the form of the metric tensor depends on the choice of the coordinate system .",
    "if we use different coordinate systems , we obtain formally different description of the same riemannian geometry . to separate the essential part of description , which relates to the geometry in itself , we are forced to consider description in all possible coordinate systems .",
    "the common part of descriptions in all coordinate systems ( invariants of the group of the coordinate transformations ) forms the description of the geometry in itself .",
    "unfortunately , we can not use all possible coordinate systems .",
    "practically we use only continuous coordinates .",
    "the number of coordinates is fixed , and coincides with the dimension of the riemannian geometry .",
    "we can not solve definitely , whether the continuity is a property of the considered geometry , or maybe , it is a property of the coordinate description . as a result , most geometers believe that the continuity is the inherent property of the geometry .",
    "they admit that the discrete geometry may be constructed , but they do not know , how to do this , because one can not use discrete coordinates for description of discrete geometries .",
    "mathematicians provide physicists with their geometrical construction , and physicists believe that the space - time is continuous .",
    "continuity of the space - time can not be tested experimentally , and the only reason of the space - time continuity is the fact that mathematicians are able to construct only continuous geometries , whereas they fail to construct discrete geometries .",
    "we have the same situation with the space dimension .",
    "geometers consider the dimension to be an inherent property of any geometry .",
    "they can imagine the @xmath42-dimensional riemannian geometry , but they can not imagine a geometry without a dimension , or a geometry of an indefinite dimension .",
    "the reason of these belief is the fact that the dimension of the manifold and its continuity are the starting points of the riemannian geometry construction , and at this point one can not separate the properties of the geometry from the properties of the manifold .    in the t - geometry",
    "we deal only with the geometry in itself , because it does not use any means of the description . as a result",
    "the t - geometry is insensitive to continuity or discreteness of the space , as well as to its dimension .",
    "application of additional means of description can lead to inconsistency and to a restriction of the list of possible physical geometries .",
    "any generalization of the proper euclidean geometry is founded on some property of the euclidean geometry ( or its objects ) .",
    "this property is conserved in all generalized geometries , whereas other properties of the euclidean geometry are varied .",
    "character and properties of the obtained generalized geometry depend essentially on the choice of the conserved property of the basic euclidean geometry .",
    "for instance , the riemannian geometry is such a generalization of the euclidean one , where the one - dimensionality and continuity of the euclidean straight line are conserved , whereas its curvature and torsion are varied .",
    "the straight line is considered to be the principal geometric object of the euclidean geometry , and one supposes that such properties of the euclidean straight line as continuity and one - dimensionality ( absence of thickness ) are to be conserved at the generalization .",
    "it means that the continuity and one - dimensionality of the straight line are to be the principal concepts of the generalized geometry ( the riemannian geometry ) . in accordance with such a choice of the conserved geometrical object one",
    "introduces the concept of the curve @xmath43 as a continuous mapping of a segment of the real axis onto the space @xmath10@xmath44 \\rightarrow \\omega   \\label{g1.1}\\ ] ] to introduce the concept of the continuity , which is a basic concept of the generalization , one introduces the topological space , the dimension of the space @xmath10 and other basic concepts of the riemannian geometry , which are necessary for construction of the riemannian generalization of the euclidean geometry .",
    "the @xmath0-immanence of the euclidean geometry is a property of the whole euclidean geometry . using the @xmath0-immanence for generalization",
    ", we do not impose any constraints on the single geometric objects of the euclidean geometry . as a result",
    "the @xmath0-immanent generalization appears to be a very powerful generalization . besides , from the common point of view the application of the whole geometry property for the generalization seems to be more reasonable , than a use of the properties of a single geometric object .",
    "thus , using the property of the whole euclidean geometry , the @xmath0-immanent generalization seems to be more reasonable , than the riemannian generalization , using the properties of the euclidean straight line .",
    "now we list the most attractive features of the @xmath0-immanent generalization of the euclidean geometry :    1 .",
    "it uses for the generalization the @xmath0-immanence , which is a property of the euclidean geometry as a whole ( but not a property of a single geometric object as it takes place at the riemannian generalization ) .",
    "2 .   the @xmath0-immanent generalization does not use any logical construction , and the @xmath0-immanent generalization is automatically as consistent , as the euclidean geometry , whose axiomatics is used implicitly . in particular",
    ", the t - geometry does not contain any theorems . as a result",
    "the main problem of the t - geometry is a correct @xmath0-immanent description of geometrical objects and relations of the euclidean geometry .",
    "there are some subtleties in such a @xmath0-immanent description , which are discussed below .",
    "the @xmath0-immanent generalization is a very powerful generalization .",
    "it varies practically all properties of the euclidean geometry , including such ones as the continuity and the parallelism transitivity , which are conserved at the riemannian generalization .",
    "4 .   the @xmath0-immanent generalization allows one to use the coordinateless description and ignore the problems , connected with the coordinate transformations as well as with the transformation of other means of description .",
    "5 .   the t - geometry may be used as the space - time geometry . in this case",
    "the tubular character of straights explains freely the stochastic world lines of quantum microparticles .",
    "considering the quantum constant @xmath45 as an attribute of the space - time geometry , one can obtain the quantum description as the statistical description of the stochastic world lines @xcite .",
    "such a space - time geometry can not be obtained in the framework of the riemannian generalization of the euclidean geometry .    in the paper",
    "we discuss the interplay between the riemannian generalization of the euclidean geometry and the @xmath0-immanent one .",
    "the fact is that the world function @xmath0 has been introduced at first in the riemannian geometry @xcite .",
    "the world function @xmath0 plays an important , but not crucial role in the description of the riemannian geometry , whereas in the t - geometry the world function @xmath0 is the only quantity , which is necessary for its construction and description .",
    "let us consider two generalization of the euclidean geometry @xmath17 with the same world function @xmath0 .",
    "let one of the generalization be the riemannian geometry @xmath46 and the other one be a @xmath0-immanent generalization @xmath47 .",
    "do the generalizations @xmath46 and @xmath47 coincide ?",
    "many important details of both generalizations coincide , but other details of the geometrical description are different . in general , the geometries @xmath46 and @xmath47 are different , although both geometries @xmath46 and @xmath47 are described by the same world function @xmath0 . the geometry @xmath47 is determined by the world function @xmath48 uniquely without any logical constructions .",
    "it means that the @xmath0-immanent generalization @xmath47 can not be inconsistent , because the basic geometry @xmath17 is consistent h30 . as to the riemannian generalization @xmath46 , it may be inconsistent , because it uses additional means of description ( manifold , topology ) , which are not necessary for construction of the @xmath0-immanent generalization of the euclidean geometry .",
    "one should investigate to what extent the additional means of description are compatible between themselves and with the given world function @xmath0 , which is alone sufficient for the construction of the consistent @xmath0-immanent generalization @xmath47 .",
    "application of additional means of description leads to an overdetermination of the problem of the euclidean geometry generalization .",
    "some inconsistencies of the riemannian generalization are corollaries of this overdetermination .",
    "the @xmath0-space @xmath50 is the set @xmath10 of points @xmath5 with the given world function @xmath0 @xmath51    let the proper euclidean geometry be given on the set @xmath10 , and the quantity @xmath52be the euclidean distance between the points @xmath53 .",

    "producing the change @xmath91 in the statement @xmath89 , we obtain corresponding statement @xmath92 of another t - geometry @xmath3 , described by the world function @xmath0 .",
    "in the t - geometry the geometric object @xmath13 is described by means of the skeleton - envelope method @xcite .",
    "it means that any geometric object @xmath13 is considered to be a set of intersections and joins of elementary geometric objects ( ego ) .",

    "each of arguments @xmath105 is a @xmath0-function of two arguments @xmath106 , either belonging to skeleton @xmath97 , or coinciding with the running point @xmath107 .",
    "thus , any elementary geometric object @xmath98 is determined by its skeleton and its envelope function as the set of zeros of the envelope function @xmath108    for instance , the cylinder @xmath109 with the points @xmath53 on the cylinder axis and the point @xmath6 on its surface is determined by the relation @xmath110 @xmath111 here @xmath112 is the area of the parallelogram , constructed on the vectors @xmath33 and @xmath113 * *  * * and @xmath114 is the area of triangle with vertices at the points @xmath115 .",
    "the equality @xmath116 means that the distance between the point @xmath6 and the axis , determined by the vector @xmath33 is equal to the distance between @xmath107 and the axis .",
    "the elementary geometrical object @xmath98 is determined in all physical geometries at once .",
    "in particular , it is determined in the proper euclidean geometry , where we can obtain its meaning .",
    "we interpret the elementary geometrical object @xmath98 , using our knowledge of the proper euclidean geometry .",
    "thus , the proper euclidean geometry is used as a sample geometry for interpretation of any physical geometry . in particular , the cylinder ( [ g3.1 ] )",
    "is determined uniquely in any t - geometry with any world function @xmath117    in the euclidean geometry the points @xmath27 and @xmath55 determine the cylinder axis .",

    "thereafter we deform them , replacing the euclidean world function @xmath4 by the world function @xmath0 of the geometry in question . in practice the construction of the elementary geometric object",
