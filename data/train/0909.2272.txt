    "the classic works of @xcite and @xcite demonstrated that , in a linearized theory of massive gravity , the tensor gravitons of general relativity ( gr ) , which couple to @xmath4 , the stress - energy tensor , are supplemented by a scalar graviton , which couples to @xmath5 , the trace of the stress - energy tensor . in the open limit as @xmath6",
    ", the gravitational forces between non - relativistic masses can be accomodated simply by increasing the gravitational constant @xmath7 by the factor @xmath8 @xcite ; whereas for @xmath9 , there is no scalar graviton hence @xmath7 is not increased to compensate for the discontinuity .",

    "have been suggested ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in the present paper",
    "we follow the approach of @xcite and @xcite by sidestepping the theoretical question of whether and how a theory of massive gravitons can be formulated , and focusing instead on observational data .",

    "the hubble constant was determined by a weighted least - squares adjustment of the model to the data . for @xmath11 , @xmath59 , and for @xmath9 , @xmath60 . because the number of degrees of freedom @xmath61 is large ,",

    "however , their milne fit s @xmath80 is also less than ours ; yet they fit the einstein - de sitter model , with @xmath81 , which is close to our @xmath82 .",
    "our calculations differed somewhat from theirs , and we could discern no pattern to the offsets , so we recalculated their @xmath57cdm model fit , and found @xmath80 , and @xmath83 .",
    "our fits to the @xmath57cdm , einstein - de sitter , and milne models are summarized in table 1 .",

    "the results are independent of the two fitting technique we used - marginalization and conventional weighted least - squares .",
    "our @xmath74 estimates are valid only if there are no systematic uncertainties , including that of the sn ia absolute magnitude . as an example of the sensitivity , a systematic uncertainty of @xmath85 mag @xcite would cause @xmath74 to be offset by @xmath86 .",
    "even so , the systematic uncertainties affect only the @xmath74 estimates , but not the @xmath75 results .",
    "if the criterion for the better fit is having the lower @xmath75 , then the @xmath57cdm model ( @xmath80 ) clearly edges the milne model ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "however , if we give full credence to the observation variances ( that is , if we assume that they are not exaggerated ) , then the criterion for the better fit is having the higher likelihood .",
    "the maximum likelihood is at the peak of the @xmath76 normal distribution , @xmath87 , so then the milne model ( @xmath88 ) edges the @xmath57cdm model ( @xmath83 ) , but this comparison is for solutions that minimize @xmath75 rather than minimize @xmath76 . in both cases @xmath89 , so by varying the solution parameters from the least - squares determinations , @xmath76 will increase from its minimum , and there will be non - unique solutions for which @xmath87 .",
    "for example , the only parameter for the @xmath1 model is @xmath74 , and the two roots to @xmath90 are @xmath91 and @xmath92 . with three independent parameters ( @xmath93 ) ,",
    "the @xmath57cdm model is more complicated because it involves a hypersurface rather than a curve . by varying each parameter , one at a time , from the @xmath75 minimum ,",
    "six solutions for @xmath87 can ( in principle ) be found ; but if they are all allowed to vary together , then there will be a continuum of solutions .",
    "the relative plausibility of these two models can not be definitively settled by statistics .",
    "we prefer instead to invoke occam s razor : ( 1 ) the @xmath57cdm model requires cosmological attractions by vast amounts of dark matter that are largely countered by cosmological repulsions by vast amounts of dark energy , whereas ( 2 ) the @xmath1 model merely requires that the graviton not be massless .",
    "occam s razor favors the second .",
    "moreover , by not requiring a @xmath57 term , we avoid conceptual difficulties , such as those described by @xcite , who considers a non - zero @xmath57 to be exceedingly problematic , but who also concedes that denying its existence in face of gr and existing data is even more problematic .",
    "the massive graviton alternative has the additional advantage that it is not sensitive to the graviton mass , provided only that @xmath0 is not identically zero .",
    "finally , if there are no massless gravitons , then there is no critical density below which the universe is open ; the universe is necessarily open .",
    "although the results in fig . 1 are insensitive to the specific value of @xmath0 provided that @xmath94 , it is interesting to consider the limits on @xmath0 that do exist .",
    "following @xcite we assume that in the absence of other long range forces , the effect of a massive graviton is to replace the newtonian gravitational potential @xmath95 of a point mass @xmath96 by the yukawa potential @xmath97 .",
    "hence any system of characteristic size @xmath98 whose behavior is correctly described by newtonian gravity implies a limit @xmath99 .",
    "several authors @xcite have analyzed data for various astrophysical systems to set limits on @xmath39 . using solar system data from @xcite",
    ", will finds @xmath100 km , and from galaxy supercluster data one can infer @xmath101 km @xcite . other lower limits on @xmath39 are summarized in @xcite . utilizing the previous arguments we can infer an upper limit for @xmath39 .",
    "suppose that there is an immense volume of uniform density matter whose extent is many skin depths ( @xmath39 s ) . on a point mass that is several skin depths inside the outer surface of the volume , the specific force due to",
    "the yukawa potential is zero , since the source appears the same in all directions .",
    "suppose next that this volume is divided into two parts : one is a sphere of radius @xmath102 @xmath39 , and the other part is the remainder of the volume with the sphere removed .",
    "the sphere is the source of a force directed toward its center ( which can easily be quantified ) , so the remainder of the volume is the source of a force of an identical magnitude , but directed away from the center of the sphere . hence if there exists a vast uniform density volume , and somewhere deep inside it",
    "there is a density perturbation that makes the local density smaller than the mean density , then the lower density matter will be accelerated outward . at the outer boundary of the volume matter",
    "will , of course , be accelerated inwards .",
    "the volume will transform toward being a hollow bubble until the thickness of the higher density bubble matter is just a few skin depths .",
    "there are some additional considerations : conservation of angular momentum places a constraint on how far the inward moving matter can progress although it does not , by itself , constrain how far the outward moving matter can go . according to @xcite ,  clusters of galaxies form surfaces with a thickness of about 10 - 20 mpc surrounding empty regions with characteristic size of 100 - 200 mpc . \"",
    "with the estimate @xmath103 the gravitational force is significant for galaxy superclusters and also between neighboring superclusters that form a  surface , \" but negligible in the vast empty regions between the surfaces .",
    "a skin depth @xmath104 mpc @xmath105 km corresponds to @xmath106  ev@xmath3 ; hence we conjecture that @xmath107 ev@xmath3 .",
    "it is then conceivable that there could be heavier gravitons in addition to this lightest graviton , with masses somewhere in the range @xmath108 which corresponds to @xmath109 the laser interferometer space antenna ( lisa ) gravitational wave detector would not be able to detect the @xmath107 ev@xmath3 mass , but it might be sensitive to the more massive gravitons in the range of eq .",

    "if @xmath1 , the dynamics of a baryon fluid at the epoch of recombination differ substantially from those of conventional models which tacitly assume that the graviton is massless . in section  [ gm ]",
    ", we explained why a massive body with dimensions that are large compared with @xmath39 would not be stable , but instead would tend to separate into smaller bodies with dimensions that are of the order of a few skin depths or less - that is , to the the scale of galaxy superclusters .",
    "we hypothesize that this instability is the principal cause of cmb power spectrum anisotropies .",
    "on recombination , massive bodies with breadths larger than , say , @xmath110 ( that is , with radii exceeding two skin depths if the bodies are spheres ) would divide into lesser sized bodies separated from each other by the distance of approximately @xmath111 .",
    "because the universe has expanded , the nominal separation distance of observed radiation peaks from the last scattering surface , with redshift @xmath112 , is @xmath113 ; and the nominal angular separation of peaks on the celestial sphere for @xmath114 is ( see eq .",

    "gravity pulls the clusters in a supercluster together , but it does not pull distinct superclusters together .",
