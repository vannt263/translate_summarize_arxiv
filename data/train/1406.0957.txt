    "the ultimate theory for gravity is an open question .",
    "general relativity has been repeatedly tested in the weak gravitational field @xcite .",
    "however , the properties of the strong gravitational field have not yet been fully verified . as for modifications in the strong gravitational field , the possibilities of various gravity theories still remain .",
    "one of the most promising alternative gravity theories is dynamical chern - simons ( cs ) modified gravity ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "this theory can be derived both from an effective theory of superstring theory @xcite and from that of loop quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the cs modified gravity is derived from an effective field theory for inflation @xcite .",
    "such a theory contains corrections consisting of higher - order derivative terms . thus high curvature ,",
    "namely , strong field regime such as the vicinity of a black hole is inevitably modified .",
    "the cs modified gravity was originally formulated in a non - dynamical theory @xcite , in which a presumed , non - dynamical scalar field is coupled to the gravitational field .",
    "however , the non - dynamical theory has several problems : ( i ) curvature singularities appear on the rotational axis for a rotating black hole @xcite ( see also @xcite for the comprehensive study of a rotating black hole ) , ( ii ) a wide class of black hole oscillation modes is suppressed @xcite , and ( iii ) ghost appears in general @xcite . hence many authors @xcite have come to discuss the dynamical cs modified gravity , in which the kinetic term for the scalar field is taken into account , to pursue self - consistency for the theory . in the dynamical theory , the first two problems mentioned above do not occur @xcite , and the last problem does not also appear at least in a certain situation @xcite . therefore , the dynamical cs modified gravity has attract much attention in recent years .",
    "the most remarkable feature of the dynamical cs modified gravity is that the schwarzschild spacetime is the unique solution for a static and asymptotically flat black hole @xcite ( see also @xcite for the case of a charged black hole ) .",
    "similarly , the spacetime outside a static and spherically symmetric star becomes the schwarzschild spacetime ( see e.g. @xcite ) when we assume asymptotically flat spacetime again , because cs corrections exactly vanishes in that case .",
    "thus the dynamical cs modified gravity gives the same result as that in general relativity for the leading term at the post - newtonian order .",
    "hence , this theory passes the classical tests for general relativity .",
    "once the assumption of a static state is broken , spacetimes in the dynamical cs modified gravity could deviate from those in general relativity . as an example for such spacetimes , we can consider a stationary spacetime around a rotating black hole .",
    "the deviation from general relativity becomes large when we approach strong field regime such as the vicinity of a rotating black hole .",
    "in weak field regime , we could merely derive small deviation from general relativity .",
    "in fact , the experimental results of gravity probe b and the lageos satellites around the earth give a rather weak constraint for a cs coupling constant @xmath0 such that @xmath1 $ ] @xcite ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : csg ] for the definition of the coupling constant ) .",
    "nevertheless , this is the most stringent constraint ever obtained .",
    "therefore , we need to investigate the strong field regime without assuming a static state to test the validity of the dynamical cs modified gravity .    in this paper , we consider a stationary spacetime around a rapidly rotating black hole . in the previous works @xcite , both slow rotation and weak cs coupling",
    "are assumed for discussing rotating black holes . however , the former assumption is insufficient for extracting distinctive features of the dynamical cs modified gravity thoroughly",
    ". thus we do not rely on the slow rotation approximation in the present work . as mentioned above",
    ", we can regard the dynamical cs modified gravity as an effective theory of more fundamental theories .",
    "thus , the assumption of weak cs coupling would still be valid , and we can treat cs corrections in the framework of the perturbation theory . to deal with a rapidly rotating black hole , we adopt the kerr spacetime as the background .",
    "as explained below , the cs scalar field and the cs gravitational correction are determined alternately in a bootstrapping scheme .",
    "therefore , we investigate the cs scalar field around a rapidly rotating black hole as the first step for the cs corrections to the stationary spacetime .    this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : csg ] , we briefly review the framework of the dynamical cs modified gravity . in sec .",
    "[ sec : cs - c ] , we discuss cs corrections to a rapidly rotating black hole based on the perturbation theory . we obtain the formal solution for the cs scalar field around the black hole , assuming a stationary and axisymmetric configuration . in particular , we obtain the analytic solution for the leading term in the legendre expansion of the scalar field with respect to the polar angle . in sec .",

    ", we adopted the perturbative approach assuming cs coupling to be weak .",
    "furthermore , we took the kerr spacetime to be the background to deal with rapid rotation of a black hole . in this approach , the cs scalar field and the cs gravitational correction",
    "are determined alternately in the bootstrapping scheme based on the perturbation theory .",
    "as the first step to the cs corrections , we obtained the solution for the scalar field analytically and numerically . in the derivation , we assumed a stationary and axisymmetric configuration and adopted the boundary condition that the scalar field is regular on the outer horizon of the kerr black hole and vanishes at infinity .",
    "in particular , we could find the analytic solution for the leading term in the legendre expansion of the scalar field with respect to the polar angle .",
    "the scalar field is a well - behaved function outside the outer horizon .",
    "however , the cs scalar field inevitably diverges on the inner horizon of the kerr spacetime .",
    "thus the scalar field becomes problematic when we approach the inner horizon .",
    "the readers might have a question : why should we care about the region inside the outer horizon ?",
    "if the scalar field had no effects on the spacetime , the behavior of the scalar field inside the horizon can not be observed at all .",
    "however , the scalar field , in fact , affects the structure of the spacetime via the stress - energy tensor .",
    "note that the stress - energy tensor @xmath30 is composed of the scalar field and its derivative .",
    "therefore , the stress - energy tensor for the scalar field also diverges on the inner horizon .",
    "after all , ill - defined spacetime region increases in the dynamical cs modified gravity in comparison with general relativity .",
    "the treatment for such a problematic region , which might require quantum treatments , would be awaited in future works .",
