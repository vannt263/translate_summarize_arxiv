    "from extensive investigations on stochastic resonance  , it is now widely accepted that noise can play a constructive role .",

    "this is what is generally called a _ time - scale matching condition _ in studies of stochastic resonance .",

    "the reason for this _",
    "double _ stochastic resonance is that the intrinsic time scale of the system diverges in both the sides , whether @xmath19 approaches @xmath0 from above or from below , so that the matching with the external frequency can occur on either side .",
    "recently , the similar mechanism of time - scale matching in quantum kinetic ising model is shown to be responsible for the double resonance peaks in quantum stochastic resonance  @xcite .",
