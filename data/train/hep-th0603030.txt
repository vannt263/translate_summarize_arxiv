    "current indirect proofs of existence of the supersymmetry in the standard model make the problem of calculation of quantum corrections in supersymmetric theories especially urgent . due to the supersymmetry the ultraviolet behavior of field theory models is essentially improved . for example even in theories with unextended supersymmetry it is possible to suggest the form of the @xmath2-function exactly to all orders of the perturbation theory . in the case of @xmath0 supersymmetric electrodynamics , which will be considered in this paper ,",

    "<S> a method of feynman diagrams summation , based on using schwinger - dyson equations and ward identities , is verified by calculating some four - loop diagrams in @xmath0 supersymmetric electrodynamics , regularized by higher derivatives . in particular , for the considered diagrams correctness of an additional identity for green functions , which is not reduced to the gauge ward identity , is proved .    </S>",
