    "granular gas - a system of inelastically colliding hard spheres - is a minimalistic model of granular flow that has received much recent attention @xcite . in particular",
    ", this model captures _ clustering _ , a generic and fascinating phenomenon in rapid granular flows resulting from the collisional loss of the kinetic energy of random motion of particles .",
    "the formation and structure of granular clusters have been investigated in many works , both in the context of a freely `` cooling '' granular gas @xcite and for driven granular gases @xcite .",
    "the basic physics of clustering can often be described in a hydrodynamic language , in terms of a collective condensation mode driven by bulk losses of energy .",
    "similar condensation processes , driven by _",
    "radiative _ energy losses in gases and plasmas , have been known for a long time @xcite .",
    "a complete understanding of the properties of granular gas ( a system intrinsically far from equilibrium ) is still lacking .",
    "one important open question is the exact criteria for the validity of kinetic theory and navier - stokes hydrodynamics , developed in the 80-ies @xcite .",
    "_ driven _ granular gas has the advantage that a steady state is achievable : the energy supplied into the system can be balanced by the collisional energy losses .",
    "we have focused in this work on a simple model : inelastic smooth hard spheres confined in a rectangular box and driven by two opposite  thermal \" walls at zero gravity .",
    "prototypical granular systems of this type were considered by many workers . in the early work , theoretical  @xcite and experimental  @xcite ,",
    "the  stripe state \" : a denser and  colder \" stripe - like cluster of particles , away from the driving wall(s ) , was documented .",
    "the formation of the stripe state has a simple explanation . due to the inelastic particle collisions ,",
    "the granular temperature goes down with an increase of the distance from the thermal wall(s ) . to maintain the steady - state pressure balance , the particle density should increase with this distance . for a large density contrast ,",
    "the stripe state is observed .    it has been found more recently that the stripe state is only one , trivial state of this system . in a certain region of parameters",
    "the stripe state becomes either unstable or metastable and undergoes a spontaneous symmetry breaking and phase separation . as the result , a higher - density `` phase '' coexists with a lower - density phase in the direction _",
    "parallel _ to the driving wall(s )  @xcite .",
    "a fascinating phenomenology of this far - from - equilibrium phase separation , and analogy with van der waals gas  @xcite put this system into a list of pattern - forming systems far from equilibrium .    in this work",
    "we report a new and very different symmetry - breaking instability in the same system . like the phase separation instability ,",
    "the new instability occurs when the inelasticity @xmath0 exceeds a critical value depending on the rest of the parameters of the system ( here @xmath1 is the coefficient of normal restitution of the particle collisions ) .",
    "in contrast to the phase separation instability , this is an instability in the direction _",
    "normal _ to the driving wall(s ) , and it is oscillatory .",
    "as it develops , the stripe - shaped cluster in the middle of the system exhibits large irregular oscillations with a single dominating frequency .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , we formulate a hydrodynamic model and briefly describe the static stripe state .",
    "then we present a linear hydrodynamic stability analysis of the stripe state that predicts oscillatory instability .",
    "the instability is then observed in molecular dynamic ( md ) simulations .",
    "finally , we briefly discuss our results .",
    "let @xmath2 identical smooth hard disks with diameter @xmath3 and mass @xmath4 move and inelastically collide inside a two - dimensional rectangular box with width @xmath5 and height @xmath6 .",
    "there is no gravity in the model .",
    "the system is driven by two thermal walls , with the same temperature @xmath7 , located at @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "we assume nearly elastic particle collisions , @xmath10 , and moderate granular densities : @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the local number density of the particles , and @xmath13 is the hexagonal dense packing density .",
    "these assumptions enable us to employ a standard version of navier - stokes granular hydrodynamics  @xcite .",
    "hydrodynamics is expected to be valid when the mean free path of the particles is much smaller than any length scale ( and the mean time between two consecutive collisions is much smaller than any time scale ) described hydrodynamically .",
    "let us measure the distance in the units of @xmath5 , the time in the units of @xmath14 , the density @xmath15 in the units of @xmath16 , the granular temperature @xmath17 in the units of @xmath7 , and the mean velocity @xmath18 in the units of @xmath19 .",
    "then the hydrodynamic equations  @xcite become dimensionless : @xmath20 @xmath21 here @xmath22 { \\mathbf i } + \\epsilon\\ , f_2 t^{1/2}\\ , \\hat{{\\mathbf d } } \\,$ ] is the stress tensor , @xmath23 is the equation of state , @xmath24 $ ] is the rate of deformation tensor , @xmath25 is the deviatoric part of @xmath26 , and @xmath27 is the identity tensor .",
    "the functions @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the following : @xmath30 \\;\\;\\ ; \\mbox{and } \\;\\;\\ ; f_2=ng\\left[1+\\frac{\\pi}{8}\\left(1+\\frac{1}{g}\\right)^2\\right]\\,,\\nonumber \\label{e}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 the two scaled parameters entering eqs .",
    "( [ hydroeqns ] ) are the small parameter @xmath32 and the parameter @xmath33 that shows the relative role of the collisional heat loss and heat conduction . the boundary conditions for the temperature become @xmath34 . for the velocity we demand zero normal components and slip ( no stress ) conditions at all boundaries .",
    "we assume that @xmath6 is small enough , so that no symmetry breaking can occur in the @xmath35-direction @xcite .",
    "therefore , the hydrodynamic variables are independent of @xmath35 , while the mean flow , if any , is directed along the @xmath36-axis .",
    "the conservation of the total number of particles yields @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the average area fraction of the grains , an additional scaled parameter of the problem .",
    "the static stripe state is described by the equations @xmath39^{\\prime}=0 \\;\\;\\ ; \\mbox{and } \\;\\;\\ ; ( t_s^{1/2 } j_1 t_s^{\\prime})^{\\prime}=r\\ , n_s g_s\\,t_s^{3/2 } , \\label{steadystate}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and the primes denote the @xmath36-derivatives .",
    "figure [ hydr]a shows an example of the temperature and density profiles of this state .",
    "notice that , despite the presence of relatively large temperature and density gradients in the stripe state , the mean free path of the particles remains , at @xmath10 , much smaller than the characteristic length scale of these gradients @xcite .",
    "therefore , hydrodynamics remains valid .",

    "the instability has a hydrodynamic character and can therefore be interpreted in terms of the collective modes of the system .",
    "there are three such modes , coupled due to the inhomogeneity of the unperturbed state of the system .",
    "two of the modes are oscillatory acoustic modes , the third one is a non - oscillatory entropy mode ( the fourth , shear mode , is suppressed because of the very small aspect ratio of the box ) .",
