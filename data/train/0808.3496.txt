    "the kondo effect in quantum dots has been studied in various kinds of systems in recent years , and the triple quantum dots with a triangular configuration is one of the interesting systems @xcite .",
    "specifically , the closed path along the triangle causes a high - spin ground state with the nagaoka mechanism @xcite , and also an su(4 ) kondo effect , depending on the gate voltage . in this report",
    "we study the triangular triple dot connected to two noninteracting leads , and present the results of the scattering phase shifts obtained with the numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) .",
    "we also calculate the temperature dependence of the entropy and spin susceptibility @xcite , which show clearly the two - stage screening process of the high - spin nagaoka state and also the feature of the kondo screening in the su(4 ) case at half - filling .",
    "we consider a three - site hubbard model on a triangle , which is connected to two non - interacting leads on the left ( @xmath1 ) and right ( @xmath2 ) , at @xmath3 and @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) , respectively , as shown in fig .",

    "the circular motion along the triangle forms a single orbital at @xmath18 and two degenerate orbitals at @xmath19 .",

    "it changes directly from @xmath47 to @xmath48 at @xmath49 without taking the step for @xmath50 .",
    "this is caused by a property of the triangle : the ground state becomes degenerate for the three charge states @xmath51 , and @xmath46 at @xmath49 in the isolated limit @xmath52 .",
    "the coulomb repulsion lifts partly the degeneracy due to the orbitals with the energy @xmath53 . specifically at the filling @xmath54 ,",
    "a high - spin @xmath0 state becomes the ground state for @xmath55 by the nagaoka mechanism for the ferromagnetism . for finite @xmath56 , the conduction electrons tunneling from the two leads screen the @xmath0 moment at low temperatures to form a kondo singlet .",

    "it implies that in this region the electrons occupy mainly the orbital of @xmath65 that has an even parity , although generally each phase shift does not necessary correspond to the occupancy of the eigenstates with the same parity .",
    "nevertheless we have confirmed , by calculating directly the occupation number of the each the partial waves @xmath66 and @xmath67 which satisfies @xmath68 , that an approximate relation @xmath69 holds well for each partial wave in the two regions , @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "however , such a separation of the friedel sum rule does not hold for the intermediate region @xmath72 : while each phase shift takes a constant value @xmath73 and @xmath74 , the occupation calculated directly has a different constant @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "these values suggest that , after two electrons occupy the orbital of the energy @xmath65 , the third electron occupies the degenerate orbitals of the energy @xmath53 in equal weights .",
    "although the coupling with the two leads breaks the full triangular symmetry of the point group , it seems as if the charge distribution recovers effectively the degeneracy at @xmath77 . during the sudden change of the phase shifts at @xmath78 , the sum @xmath79 and",
    "the parallel conductance @xmath80 change their values very little .",
    "on the other hand , the phase difference @xmath81 , varies rapidly from @xmath82 to @xmath83 .",
    "this rapid and continuous change of @xmath81 causes the narrow dip observed for the series conductance @xmath23 at @xmath78 in the middle of the conductance plateau . the dip is also related to the su(4 ) symmetry .",
    "in contrast , the conductance at @xmath84 is caused by the usual su(2 ) kondo effect due to @xmath85 moment .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : s_tchi ] ( a ) the temperature dependence of the entropy @xmath86 and @xmath87 , which are obtained at @xmath88 in the middle of the charge step for @xmath54 , is plotted as a function of @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is the half - width of the conduction bands .",
    "the results clearly show that the screening of the spin @xmath0 local moment due to the nagaoka mechanism occurs via two separate stages at @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "we see that the entropy takes the value @xmath93 at high temperatures for @xmath94 , and it means that the @xmath0 moment is free .",
    "then , at intermediate temperature @xmath95 , the entropy becomes @xmath96 .",
    "it shows that the half of the moment is screened by the conduction electrons from one of the channel degrees , and the local moment is still in an under - screened state .",
    "the full screening is completed finally at very low temperatures @xmath97 , as we can seen also in the behavior of @xmath98 .",
    "similarly , the entropy and the spin susceptibility for @xmath99 , just at the dip of @xmath23 for @xmath100 , are plotted in fig .",
