    "this behavior reflects its weak interatomic potential and the relatively large zero - point energy ( because of the small mass ) .",
    "the common helium isotope @xmath0he has two electrons , two protons and two neutrons and thus acts like a boson under exchange of two such atoms . below a characteristic temperature @xmath4",

    "superfluid @xmath0he has remarkable hydrodynamic properties .",
    "it can flow through fine channels with no pressure drop , which suggests that it has zero viscosity , yet a direct measurement of the viscosity through torque on a rotating cylinder yields a value comparable with that for the normal phase above @xmath5 .",
    "this seemingly contradictory behavior was explained phenomenologically by a two - fluid model , in which the low - temperature phase has two interpenetrating components : ( 1 ) a superfluid with zero viscosity and irrotational flow velocity @xmath6 with @xmath7 and ( 2 ) a normal ( viscous ) fluid with general velocity @xmath8 .",
    "each component has its own temperature - dependent mass density @xmath9 and @xmath10 , with @xmath11 ( the total mass density ) .",
    "the superfluid component has @xmath12 at @xmath5 and @xmath13 at @xmath3 k. the normal density @xmath10 has been measured by the viscous drag on a set of oscillating disks that respond only to the normal component ; the superfluid density is then given by @xmath14 .",
    "superfluid @xmath0he can exhibit persistent currents in a multiply connected geometry like a torus or in a porous random medium such as a compacted powder .",
    "if the container and fluid rotate above @xmath5 and are then cooled below @xmath5 the superfluid will continue to rotate at essentially the original angular velocity @xmath15 . if the container is slowly brought to rest , in many cases , the superfluid continues to rotate ( in contrast to the behavior of a classical viscous fluid that would eventually come to rest ) .",
    "such persistent currents typify both superfluid @xmath0he and superconductors ( where the charge makes the detection of such electrical currents relatively easy ) .",
    "there is a critical velocity @xmath16 for superfluid flow that is set by the energy of the lowest excited state ; @xmath16 gives an upper limit to the magnitude of persistent currents in confined geometries . for a channel of lateral dimension @xmath17 ,",
    "the typical observed critical velocity is of order @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the atomic mass .      for low flow velocity ,",
    "liquid @xmath0he is effectively incompressible with @xmath20 .",

    "subsequently feynman  @xcite suggested that rotating superfluid @xmath0he has a uniform array of quantized vortex lines with singular vorticity @xmath28 at the center of each line .",
    "the velocity potential for a single vortex line is proportional to the azimuthal angle @xmath29 , which ensures that the quantum - mechanical wave function is single - valued and reproduces onsager s quantized circulation .",
    "feynman also chose the areal vortex density @xmath30 to mimic solid - body rotation @xmath31 , yielding @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the external angular velocity .",
    "landau  @xcite introduced a quasiparticle model to describe the normal component ( for more accessible accounts , see  @xcite ) .",
    "specifically the elementary excitations act like phonons at long wavelengths with a dispersion relation @xmath34 , where @xmath35 m / s is the speed of compressional sound . for shorter wavelengths comparable with the interparticle spacing in liquid @xmath0he , the dispersion relation has a local minimum associated with what are called rotons @xmath36 where @xmath37 k is the roton gap , @xmath38 m@xmath39 , and @xmath40 for @xmath41 .",
    "this model of independent phonons and rotons allows a straightforward calculation of the temperature - dependent normal - fluid density @xmath10 .",
    "more importantly , it also predicts a critical velocity as follows .",
    "imagine a macroscopic object moving through the superfluid at @xmath3 k. conservation of energy and momentum indicates that this object can not lose energy by creating a quasiparticle unless its speed exceeds a critical velocity @xmath16 given by the minimum value of @xmath42 : @xmath43 for superfluid @xmath0he , rotons determine this value as @xmath44 m / s .",

    "much of the experimental data relating to bose - einstein condensation in trapped gases has been obtained from images of the density distribution of an atomic cloud after the trap has been switched off . indeed such time - of - flight expansion of an ultracold gas released from a harmonic trap provided some of the first evidence of bose einstein condensation @xcite . in a series of observations taken a fixed time after release the measured size of the expanded cloud decreases abruptly as the temperature is reduced through the phase transition .",
