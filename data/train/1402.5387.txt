    "the vortex point system is a classical playground which originates from fluid mechanics and goes back to helmholtz , kirchoff , routh , and lin .",
    "it appeared as a idealized model where the vorticity of an ideal incompressible two - dimensional fluid is concentrated in a finite number of points .",
    "despite the fact that it does not constitute a solution of the euler equations in the sense of distributions , it is now well - known that point vortices can be viewed as limits of concentrated smooth vortices which evolve according to the euler equations . in the case of a single vortex moving in a bounded and simply - connected domain",
    "this was proved by turkington in @xcite .",
    "an extension to the case of several vortices was given by marchioro and pulvirenti , see @xcite .",
    "recently gallay has proven in @xcite that the vortex point system can also be obtained as vanishing viscosity limits of concentrated smooth vortices evolving according to the incompressible navier - stokes equations .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to prove that the vortex point system can also be viewed as the limit of the dynamics of a solid , shrinking into a pointwise massless particle with fixed circulation , in free motion in an irrotational fluid .",
    "actually our analysis also allows to cover another asymptotic regime corresponding to the shrinking of a solid with fixed mass and circulation . in this case",
    "we obtain at the limit a second - order differential equation involving a kutta - joukowski - type lift force , which extends the result of @xcite to the case where the solid - fluid system is bounded .",
    "indeed this second case is way easier to tackle and we will therefore present it first in the sequel as a warm up before the difficulties appearing in the massless case .",
    "we will consider the same setting than turkington in @xcite , that is we assume that the fluid is ideal , confined in a two - dimensional bounded domain and we consider the motion of a single solid immersed in it .",
    "moreover the flow is supposed to be irrotational .",
    "we are interested in determining the limit of the dynamics of the solid when its size goes to 0 , distinguishing two cases :    * case ( i ) : when the mass of the solid is fixed ( and then the solid tends to a mass pointwise particle ) , and * case ( ii ) : when the mass tends to 0 along with the size ( and then the solid tends to a massless pointwise particle ) .",
    "this encompasses the case of fixed density .      to begin with ,",
    "let us recall the dynamics of a solid with fixed size and mass .",
    "we denote by @xmath0 the bounded open regular connected and simply connected domain of @xmath1 occupied by the system fluid - solid .",
    "we assume without loss of generality that @xmath2 and that the logarithmic capacity @xmath3 of @xmath4 satisfies @xmath5 using translation and dilatation of the coordinates system if necessary .",
    "at the initial time , the domain of the solid is a non - empty closed regular connected and simply connected set @xmath6 and @xmath7 is the domain of the fluid .",
    "observe that the monotony property of the logarithmic capacity entails that @xmath8 .",
    "there is no loss of generality in assuming that the center of mass of the solid coincides at the initial time with the origin .",
    "the rigid motion of the solid is described at every moment by a rotation matrix @xmath9 describing the rotation of the solid with respect to its original position and a vector @xmath10 describing the position of the center of mass .",
    "the domain of the solid at every time @xmath11 is therefore @xmath12 while the domain of the fluid is @xmath13 the fluid - solid system is governed by the following set of coupled equations :    [ sys_full_system ] @xmath14    above @xmath15 and @xmath16 denote the velocity and pressure fields in the fluid , @xmath17 and @xmath18 denote respectively the mass and the moment of inertia of the body while the fluid is supposed to be homogeneous of density @xmath19 , to simplify the notations .",
    "when @xmath20 the notation @xmath21 stands for @xmath22 , @xmath23 denotes the unit normal vector pointing outside the fluid , @xmath24 is the velocity of the center of mass @xmath25 of the body and @xmath26 denotes the angular velocity of the rigid body at time @xmath27 .",
    "let us also emphasize that we will use @xmath28 as surface element without any distinction on @xmath29 , @xmath30 and on @xmath31 .",
    "let us recall that if the flow is irrotational at the initial time , that is if @xmath32 in @xmath33 , it will remain irrotational for every time , that is @xmath34 according to helmholtz s third theorem .",
    "on the other hand the circulation around the body is constant in time : @xmath35 with @xmath36 according to kelvin s theorem . here",
    "@xmath37 denotes the unit counterclockwise tangential vector so that @xmath38 .",
    "let us mention here that we will also use the notation @xmath37 on @xmath29 such that @xmath39 so that it is clockwise .       in the irrotational case",
    ", the system can be recast as an ode whose unknowns are the degrees of freedom of the solid , namely @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "in particular the motion of the fluid is completely determined by the solid position and velocity . in order to state this ,",
    "let us introduce the variables @xmath42 and their time derivatives @xmath43 since the domains @xmath44 and @xmath45 depend on @xmath46 only , we shall rather denote them @xmath47 and @xmath48 in the rest of the paper . since throughout this paper we will not consider any collision , we introduce : @xmath49 where @xmath50 denotes for two sets @xmath51 and @xmath52 in the plane @xmath53 above and all along the paper we will use the notation @xmath54 for the euclidean norm in @xmath55 . since @xmath56 is a closed subset in the open set @xmath57 the initial position @xmath58 of the solid belongs to @xmath59 .",
