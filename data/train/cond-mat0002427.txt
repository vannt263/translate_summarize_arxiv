    "the wetting properties of a fiber in liquid matrices ( e.g. , dye mixtures , polymer melts , or molten resins ) play an important role in the textile industry and in the fabrication of high - performance , fiber - reinforced composite materials . since contact angles of liquid droplets on solid substrates provide a valuable characterization of such wetting properties there are numerous experimental and theoretical studies of the shape and the spreading of droplets deposited on a cylindrical substrate ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "the morphology of liquid drops on a fiber is particularly interesting insofar as on a planar substrate there is only one , spherical caplike droplet shape , whereas on a cylindrical substrate droplets may exhibit two , topologically different shapes , a `` clamshell''- and a `` barrel''-type one , depending on the droplet volume , the contact angle , and the cylinder radius  @xcite",
    ". the aforementioned studies deal with thick fibers and large drops , i.e. , the length scales are @xmath0 m and larger . in this range",
    "the fluid structures are determined by macroscopic properties alone , i.e. , volume of the liquid , surface tension @xmath1 of the liquid vapor interface , young s contact angle @xmath2 , and radius @xmath3 of the cylinder .",
    "however , with the discovery of nanotubes the interest in such fluid structures has shifted to much smaller scales .",
    "there are several applications for which these small solid - fluid structures are very important .",
    "( i ) for fabricating valuable composite materials involving nanotubes their wetting by the liquid host matrix is necessary to couple the inherent strength of the nanotubes to the matrix , reinforcing materials or fillers for plastics and ceramics  @xcite .",
    "( ii ) nanotubes can be used as supports for heterogeneous catalysis or as templates for creating small wires or tubular structures by coating them with metals or metal oxides in the liquid state  @xcite or by attaching inorganic and organic moieties to the nanotube surfaces  @xcite .",
    "( iii ) in order to use nanotubes as `` nanostraws '' potential candidates for exploiting such capillarity must be screened by first seeing if the liquid wets the _ outside _ of nanotubes  @xcite .",
    "the performance of the nanotubes as catalysts , adsorbants , and deodorants can vary depending on whether they are composed of carbon , boron nitride , or oxides ( sio@xmath4 , al@xmath4o@xmath5 , v@xmath4o@xmath6 , moo@xmath5 , tio@xmath4 )  @xcite .",
    "this variety demonstrates , that the substrate potential of these tubes can be regarded as a tunable parameter .",
    "( iv ) by using nanotubes as nanotweezers  @xcite it might be possible to grab and manipulate small liquid drops . for this application",
    "the substrate must be nonwettable .",
    "these small scales are comparable with the range of the substrate potential of the cylinders and of the molecular forces between the fluid particles adsorbing on them .",
    "thus the droplets form under the action of the so - called effective interface potential @xmath7 which accounts for the net effect of the competition between the forces among the fluid particles and the substrate potential  @xcite .",
    "accordingly the calculation of the corresponding deformed droplet shapes requires a more detailed theoretical description which takes the effective interface potential into account . to our knowledge",
    "there is only one , recent publication in which this effect of @xmath7 on the droplet shape on fibers has been analyzed  @xcite .",
    "it is the purpose of our study here to refine and to extend this analysis in various directions .",
    "if the radius @xmath3 of the fiber reduces to a few nm , as it is the case for nanotubes , the effective interface potential itself will depend on @xmath3 and thus deviate from that of the corresponding semi - infinite planar substrate used in ref .",
    "accordingly we present a systematic analysis of the dependence of the shape of the droplets and their suitably defined contact angles on both @xmath3 and the droplet volume .",
    "this enables us to describe systematically the crossover in shape and contact angle between those of droplets on a cylinder and on the limiting case @xmath8 of a planar substrate .",
    "we remark on how the structure of the effective interface potential , depending on whether it leads to first - order or continuous wetting transitions , influences the morphology of the droplets .",
    "we confine our analysis to barrel - type droplets and estimate their metastability against roll - up to the clamshell configuration .",
    "finally we study two types of line tensions .",
    "the first one concerns the line tension of three - phase contact between liquid , vapor , and substrate emerging at the ends of macroscopicly large drops on fibers which reduces to the familiar line tension of the straight three - phase contact line on a planar substrate .",
    "the second excess free energy concerns the effective line tension associated with the circular shape of the three - phase contact line on a planar substrate as function of the droplet volume .",
    "these results are relevant for understanding how to extract line tensions from contact angle measurements .",
    "we are encouraged to present our refined analyses by recent experimental advances to determine droplet shapes such as microscopic interferometry  @xcite , ellipsometric microscopy  @xcite , scanning polarization force microscopy  @xcite , and tapping - mode scanning force microscopy  @xcite .",
    "these techniques allow one to resolve drop profiles on the submicrometer scale  @xcite down to the nanometer scale  @xcite , both vertically and laterally . in view of the numerous important applications mentioned above it would be rather rewarding to extend the application of these techniques to nonplanar substrate geometries in order to resolve experimentally the shape of droplets on fibers and tubes as presented in the following sections .",
    "in cylindrical coordinates the droplet surface is described by a function @xmath9 or @xmath10 of the coordinate @xmath11 along the symmetry axis of the cylinder ( fig .  [",
    "f : system](a ) ) .",
    "we define @xmath9 and @xmath10 such that @xmath9 is the local separation between the liquid - vapor interface and the symmetry axis of the cylinder and @xmath12 is the local separation between the cylinder surface and the liquid - vapor interface , i.e. , the liquid layer thickness .",
    "the droplet is also symmetric with respect to a reflection at the plane @xmath13 . for large values of @xmath14 ,",
    "i.e. , at large distances from the droplet center at @xmath13 , the liquid forms a thin wetting layer of thickness @xmath15 around the cylinder . for reasons of simplicity @xmath9",
    "is henceforth assumed to be a unique function of @xmath11 , i.e. , we do not consider contact angles @xmath16 .",
    "the shape of the liquid - vapor interface enclosing the droplet is determined by the interplay of three physical quantitites : the laplace pressure  @xcite @xmath17 generated by the mean curvature @xmath18 of the interface with surface tension @xmath1 , the capillary pressure  @xcite induced by the finite droplet volume , and the disjoining pressure or , equivalently , the effective interface potential @xmath19 acting on the liquid - vapor interface  @xcite ; @xmath20 is the cost in free energy per surface area to maintain a homogeneous wetting layer of prescribed thickness @xmath21 covering the cylinder surface and can be expressed in terms of the underlying forces of the substrate and between the fluid particles  @xcite . in the absence of the effective interface potential , i.e. , for large droplets the liquid - vapor interface is a minimal surface under the constraint of a prescribed volume , i.e. , it exhibits a constant mean curvature .",
    "the influence of the effective interface potential is most pronounced near the cylinder surface within the range of the substrate potential and leads to a deviation of the actual profile @xmath9 from the shape which is determined by the aforementioned constant mean curvature condition . on the other hand , in the limit of large separation from the cylinder surface the mean",
