    "in the presence of @xmath1 massless flavours , the qcd lagrangian exhibits the chiral symmetry @xmath2 .",
    "two theoretical facts can be inferred from first principles .",
    "if @xmath3 , and provided quarks are confined ( no coloured physical states ) , the chiral symmetry @xmath2 is necessarily broken down to its diagonal subgroup @xmath4 generated by vector currents .",
    "this theorem follows from the analysis of constraints imposed by anomalous ward identities on the spectrum of massless physical states @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and from some non - trivial properties of vector - like gauge theories , such as the so called `` persistent mass condition '' @xcite : a bound state can be massless only if all its constituents are massless @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the proof of theorem 1 gives a hint about the actual content of the statement of spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry @xmath5 : the statement merely concerns the existence of massless goldstone boson states ( pions ) coupled to conserved axial currents : @xmath6 one proves that in qcd with @xmath7 and no coloured states , it would be impossible to satisfy all anomalous ward identities if @xmath8 would have to vanish .",
    "this brings us to the second theoretical fact .",
    "a necessary and sufficient criterion of @xmath9 is a non - zero value of the left - right correlation function @xmath10 where @xmath11 are noether currents generating the left and right chiral rotations respectively .",
    "the correlator [ limi ] encompasses both essential features of @xmath9 . *",
    "i ) * the asymmetry of the vacuum : if the vacuum would be symmetric , @xmath12 should vanish .",
    "* ii ) * the existence of massless goldstone bosons : the limit [ limi ] is nonvanishing if and only if the correlator [ limi ] contains a massless pion - pole .",
    "@xmath12 is an * order parameter * , whose non - zero value is necessary and sufficient for @xmath9 and goldstone bosons to occur .",
    "there are , of course , many other order parameters , such as local quark condensates @xmath13 a non - zero value of each of them by itself implies @xmath9 , but the converse is not true .",
    "@xmath9 can take place ( i.e. @xmath14 ) , even if * some * of these condensates vanishes . in particular , there is no proof available as in the case of @xmath12 , showing that @xmath15 is a necessary consequence of @xmath9 .",
    "the @xmath16 condensate plays an analogous role as the spontaneous magnetization @xmath17 of spin systems with broken rotation symmetry .",
    "although there is no symmetry reason for the latter to vanish , its actual value depends on the nature of the magnetic order in the ground state : @xmath18 for a ferromagnet , whereas @xmath19 for an antiferromagnet .    in the next section",
    ", i shall briefly illustrate how @xmath9 without @xmath0 condensation could naturally arise in qcd .",
    "the existence of such a theoretical possibility means that one should remain open - minded and precautious concerning the value of @xmath0 , especially , since the latter is not yet under an experimental control .",
    "i shall mainly review the pattern of light quark masses as they would look like if the condensate was considerably smaller than usually believed , adding some comments on the constraints imposed on quark masses and condensates by qcd - sum rules .",
    "finally , i shall briefly mention few forthcoming experimental tests .",
    "some of them are discussed in details in other contributions to this workshop @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .      upon evaluating non - perturbative quantities such as the correlator [ limi ] or the @xmath0 condensate , it is useful to consider the theory in an euclidean space - time box @xmath20 with periodic boundary conditions and to integrate over quark fields first .",
    "this leads to a quantum mechanical problem of a single quark in a random gluonic background @xmath21 , which is defined by the hermitean hamiltonian @xmath22 the result of this integration over quarks may be formally expressed in terms of eigenvalues @xmath23 and of ( orthonormal ) eigenvectors @xmath24 of the dirac hamiltonian @xmath25 .",
    "the spectrum is symmetric around 0 : @xmath26,@xmath27 .",
    "subsequently , the resulting expression has to be averaged over all gluon configurations : @xmath28>>=\\int       d[g]\\exp(-s_{ym}[g])\\prod_{\\lambda_{n}>0}(m^{2}+\\lambda^{2}_{n})^{n_{f}}x[g]\\ .",

    ".    for the chiral condensate one gets @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the quark mass .",
    "similarly , the correlator [ limi ] is given by the formula @xmath31 where @xmath32 it is seen that both order parameters [ qqbar ] and [ f02 ] are merely sensitive to the infrared end of the dirac spectrum , @xmath33 .",
    "consider now the dirac hamiltonian [ h1 ] as a generator of evolution in a fictitious time t added to the 4 euclidean space - coordinates @xmath34 .",
    "in this 4 + 1 dimensional space - time one may switch on a homogenous color singlet electric field , adding to @xmath25 a time dependent perturbation @xmath35 with @xmath36 constant .",
    "@xmath37 is then proportional to the @xmath38 transition probability triggered by the perturbation [ deh ] with @xmath39 .",
    "this suggests that from the point of view of the fictitious 4 + 1 dimensional space - time , there is an analogy between @xmath9 and the electrically induced transport properties of massless quarks in a random medium which is characterized by a coloured magnetic type ( static ) disorder @xmath21 with a probability distribution given by eq .",

    "quark condensation is an exclusive affair of the density of states .",

    "consequently , @xmath16 pairs condense if and only if @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "the case @xmath55 represents a too strong infrared singularity , which can be excluded : @xmath0 can not explode @xcite . on the other hand , @xmath9 , i.e. a non - zero value of @xmath56 given by eq .",
    "[ pi2 ] can be shown to require @xmath57 . hence ,",
    "one is faced to two extreme alternatives of @xmath9 :    * i ) * @xmath58 : the density of states and @xmath0 vanish as @xmath44 , but still @xmath59 , i.e. @xmath9 takes place and goldstone bosons are formed , due to a large mobility of `` low - energy '' quarks , @xmath60 .",
    "this behavior occurs naturally provided quark states are delocalized .    *",
    "ii ) * @xmath54 : the density of states remains non - zero as @xmath61 , i.e.@xmath15 , whereas the mobility @xmath62 must be suppressed by a factor @xmath63 .",
    "such a suppression of mobility could be naturally understood if the euclidean quark states were in a sense localized .",
    "the intermediate case @xmath64 can not be excluded on general grounds .",
    "one can show , however , that an effective low energy theory characterized by an effective lagrangian analytic in quark masses can only exist , provided @xmath65 integer .",
    "this , together with the condition @xmath57 , selects the cases @xmath58 and @xmath54 as two distinct possibilities of realizing @xmath9 in qcd .    in nature , both types of states belonging to the @xmath58 and @xmath54 bands can coexist and contribute to the @xmath9 .",
    "since only the @xmath54 band contributes to the chiral condensate , the actual value of @xmath0 can hardly be guessed in advance .",
    "what matters in practice , is the size of the parameter @xmath66 one will have to distinguish on phenomenological grounds between a * large condensate * , typically @xmath67 ( 1 gev ) @xmath68 2 gev which seems to be suggested by lattice simulations and a * small condensate * , say @xmath69 100 mev resulting from an attempt to variationally extend the qcd perturbation theory @xcite and to calculate non - perturbative quantities such as @xmath8 and @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "we consider the 3 light quark masses @xmath70 and @xmath71 renormalized in the @xmath72 scheme at the running scale @xmath53 . in this section",
    "we will be mostly concerned with the relation between the two quark - mass ratios @xmath73 and the masses of unmixed goldstone bosons @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",

    "none of the conclusions [ rr2 ] , [ rd ] , [ rr1 ] or [ mumd ] holds if @xmath83 , in particular , if @xmath84 .",
    "@xmath83 does not mean that the expansion of @xmath85 in powers of @xmath86 breaks down .",

    "they are dominated by exchanges of bound states of mass @xmath94 1 gev and this fact allows one to roughly estimate their order of magnitude @xcite : @xmath95 the coefficients @xmath93 are genuine qcd quantities independent of the goldstone boson sector of the theory and the estimate [ an ] should hold independently of the size of the chiral condensate . on the other hand ,",
