    "a standard solar model ( ssm ) may be defined as a description of the solar interior which reproduces the observed properties of the sun within observational errors , by adopting a set of physical and chemical inputs chosen within the range of their uncertainties .    from the point of view of stellar evolution ,",
    "the sun is a well known structure .",
    "confidence in ssms rests on the success of stellar evolution theory to describe many , and more complex , evolutionary phases in good agreement with observational data . before the advent of helioseismology , however , a solar model had three ( essentially ) free parameters  the initial helium and heavier elements abundances , y and z , and the mixing length parameter @xmath10  for producing three observables : the present radius , luminosity and heavy elements content of the photosphere . from this point of view , the success of ssms to reproduce these observables may look as a not too big accomplishment .",
    "the solar neutrino puzzle ( see e.g. @xcite ) , i.e. the disagreement between the ssm predictions and the results of the four solar neutrino experiments@xcite , originated many discussions about the validity of the ssms and prompted many attempts to build alternative solar models , none however capable of solving the discrepancy .    in recent years helioseismology",
    "has added important information on the solar structure .",
    "a ssm has now to account for these additional data .",
    "helioseismology ( see @xcite for an introduction and @xcite for extensive reviews ) provides severe constraints and tests of solar model calculations .",
    "for instance , from inversion ( deconvolution ) of helioseismological data one can infer the photospheric helium abundance y@xmath11 @xcite and the depth of the convective zone @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "the helium mass fraction , which was used as an essentially free parameter to match the observed solar luminosity , is now strongly constrained .",
    "still one can adjust @xmath10 in order to get the proper solar radius , @xmath13 ; however there is no parameter which can be tuned to get @xmath12 .",
    "the comparison between the theoretically predicted value of @xmath12 and the value inferrred from helioseismology is a test of the model .",
    "helioseismology can tell a lot about the solar interior , however , it can not replace ssms . as an example , helioseismology determines the sound speed down to the solar core to high accuracy , but it can not give the temperature profile in the energy production region . in order to calculate the several neutrino luminosities ( pp , @xmath14be , cno , @xmath15b ... ) , which crucially depend on this profile ,",
    "ssms are needed .    for people interested in solar neutrinos ,",
    "the basic question is thus :    * which solar models  if any  are acceptable , i.e. consistent with helioseismology ?    before addressing this question , one has to provide a quantitative answer to the following one :    * how accurate are the helioseimological determinations of quantities characterizing the solar interior ?    the present paper is essentially devoted to this issue : we perform a systematic and possibly exhaustive investigation of the uncertainties of the helioseismological approach , in order to estimate the global error to be assigned to helioseismological determinations of the solar properties . with this spirit , we analyse the helioseismological determinations of several physical quantities @xmath16 characterizing the solar structure .",
    "concerning the outer part of the sun , we discuss y@xmath11 , @xmath12 , the sound speed @xmath17 and density @xmath18 at the bottom of the convective zone .",
    "then we consider the  intermediate \" solar interior ( @xmath19=@xmath20 ) , analysing the behaviour of the squared isothermal sound speed , = @xmath6 .",
    "finally we investigate the inner region ( @xmath21 ) , where nuclear energy and neutrinos are produced .    for each quantity",
    "@xmath16 we determine the partial errors corresponding to each uncertainties of the helioseismological method .",
    "this approach  which will be better elucidated in sections [ inver ] and [ error ]  is needed since helioseismology measures _ only _ the frequencies \\{@xmath22 } of solar p - modes , and quantities characterizing the solar structure are indirectly inferred from the \\{@xmath22 } s , through an inversion method .",
    "schematically , the procedure is the following :    a)one starts with a solar model , giving values @xmath23 and predicting a set \\{@xmath24 } of frequencies",
    ". these will be somehow different from the measured frequencies , @xmath25    b)one then searches for the corrections @xmath26 to the solar model which are needed in order to match the corresponding frequencies \\{@xmath27 } with the observed frequencies \\{@xmath28}. expression for @xmath29 are derived by using perturbation theory , where the starting model is used as a zero - th order approximation .",
    "the corrections factor @xmath26 are then computed , assuming some regularity properties , so that the problem is mathematically well defined and/or unphysical solutions are avoided .",
    "c)the `` helioseismological value '' @xmath30 is thus determined by adding the starting value and the correction : @xmath31    there are three independent sources of uncertainties in this process :    i)errors on the measured frequencies , which  for a given inversion procedure ",
    "propagate on the value of @xmath30 .",
    "ii)residual dependence on the starting model : the resulting @xmath30 is slightly different if one starts with different solar models .",
    "this introduces an additional uncertainty , which can be evaluated by comparing the results of several calculations .",
    "iii)uncertainty in the regularization procedure .",
    "essentially this is a problem of extrapolation / parametrization .",
    "different methods , equally acceptable in principle , yield ( slightly ) different values of @xmath30 .",
    "it has to be remarked that , in view of the extreme precision of the measured frequencies , @xmath32 @xcite , uncertainties corresponding to ii ) and iii ) are extremely important .",
    "we consider all these uncertainties , as well as the possible ways of combining them to estimate the global error .",
    "all this will provide a framework for a quantitative comparison between solar models and helioseismology . in the final part of the paper we test the predictions of a few recent ( standard ) solar model calculations .",
    "we feel that similar test should be performed , when alternative solar models are proposed .",
    "the paper is organized as follows :    a short review of the inversion methods is given in section [ inver ] , where we also define the free parameters and determine their allowed ranges .",
    "the individual uncertainties mentioned above are operationally defined in section [ error ] , where possible definitions of the global errors are also discussed . in section [ outer ] the properties of the outer sun ( photospheric helium abundance and quantities characterizing the bottom of the convective zone )",
    "are examined , and results are compared with previous analyses .",
    "section [ inter ] is devoted to the intermediate region ( @xmath33 ) whereas section [ energy ] concerns the energy production region . in section [ model ] the results of a few recent solar models",
    "are compared with the available helioseismological constraints / tests .",

    "\\a ) + the helioseismic data that have been used for probing the solar interior structure are frequencies of acoustic oscillations ( p - modes ) corresponding to @xmath34 spherical harmonics , with the degrees @xmath35 ranging from 0 to some 150 . at low degrees",
    "there are typically 15 modes corresponding to rather high radial degrees , @xmath36 .",
    "the total number of modes which has been used in structural inversions exceeds two thousands , which is only a small fraction of the total number of modes with measured frequencies .",
    "the latter number is higher by two orders of magnitude .",
    "however , modes corresponding to @xmath37 are not really useful for probing the structure of the sun s interior , because they propagate only in the shallow outermost layers and also because the accuracy of the corresponding frequencies is much worse .",
    "tesseral ( @xmath38 ) mode frequencies yield an information about the sun s internal rotation and magnetic field . in the present application ,",
    "the only relevance of these data is to justify ignoring effects of the centrifugal and lorentz forces on the radial structure .",
    "the most exploited helioseismic data set is one from measurements at the big bear solar observatory in 1986 ( bbso86 @xcite ) .",
    "this set contains no data for modes with @xmath39 and has been supplemented with data on @xmath403 modes from various sources .",
    "the most extensive data on such modes is from the network of automatic telescopes operated by the group of birmingham university ( bison @xcite ) .",

    "+ b ) + the basic assumptions made in seismic probings of the sun s interior structure include hydrostatic equilibrium and adiabaticity of oscillations . in early inversions an asymptotic approximation for the radial eigenfunctions was used leading to a simple integral equation connecting the adiabatic sound speed , @xmath41 , to oscillation frequencies @xmath42 . however",
    ", this approximation is inadequate , especially for probing the deep interior and in most of the subsequent works numerical solutions have been adopted .",
    "the price is a need to use a ssm as a starting model about which the hydrostatic equations are linearized .",
    "there is an implicit assumption that the model provides a sufficently close description of the sun s structure . with this assumption",
    ", the variational principle following from the equation for the adiabatic oscillations , leads to an integral equation connecting the differences between the solar and the model functions describing radial structure ( e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) to the corresponding differences in mode frequencies .",
    "the equation , however , can not be directly applied to infer the difference in the structural functions because the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium of the mean structure as well as that of adiabaticity of oscillations break down near the surface . to account for these departures an _ ad hoc _ term of the form @xmath43 , where @xmath22 is the frequency an @xmath44 is a suitable moment of inertia , must be added .",
    "such a form follows from the fact that there the radial eigenfunctions are nearly @xmath35-indepedent .",
    "the resulting formula may be written in the following form , @xmath45 where @xmath46 identifies the mode , @xmath47 is a structural function , @xmath48= ( @xmath49logp/@xmath49log@xmath50 is the adiabatic exponent , @xmath51 and : @xmath52 there is freedom in choosing @xmath16 .",
    "it could be density @xmath53 , pressure @xmath54 , or any combination of these quantities and their derivatives .",

    "one may eliminate one of the functions by making use of a thermodynamical relation @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the fractional he abundance , and of two , well justified simplifications , which are :    \\(1 ) y = y@xmath11 in the convective envelope , and    \\(2 ) = 0 in the radiative interior .    with these additional constraints the unknown function",
    "is related with the unknown number y@xmath59 .",

    "one advantage of this formulation of the inverse problem is that one obtains directly the surface abundance of he .",
    "we follow this approach here .",

    "+ c ) + one way of making use of the assumption about the slow variability of  and @xmath56 is a discretization in terms of known functions . following @xcite ,",
    "we use cubic splines in the first case and legendre polynomials in the second case .",
    "the coefficients in these two representations together with   are determined by the least - squares method .",
    "a simple - minded application of this method results in a solution for   which exhibits artificial oscillations .",
    "a cure to this problem is regularization ( see e.g. @xcite ) which consists in adding to the usual @xmath64 an additional term .",
    "here we minimize @xmath65 where j is the total number of the frequency data , @xmath66 are the errors on the measured frequencies and @xmath67 is a control parameter .",
    "this form of regularization is referred to as the second derivative smoothing .",
    "alternative forms of regularization and influence of the choice of @xmath67 were investigated in @xcite .",
    "the regularization parameter @xmath67 was chosen to be the minimum value that still suppresses the oscillations .",
    "numerical experiments were conducted in which attempt was made to reproduce known differences in @xmath68 between two solar models from differences in p - mode frequencies .",
    "the set of modes was the same as in the observational data with weights determined by the observational errors .",
    "the conclusion from these experiments was that for @xmath69 it is possible to reproduce @xmath68 very accurately and independently of the choice of the type of the regularization .",
    "the results are also insensitive to @xmath67 in a wide range of values .",
    "however in the inner core ( @xmath70 ) a regularization needed to avoid the oscillatory behaviour always flattened the real steep increase in .",
    "it became clear that the method is not applicable for probing this part of the sun .",
    "the reason is that only a small fraction of modes in the data sets exibits any measurable sensitivity to the sound speed changes in the inner core and the effect of regularization dominates over the data .",
    "uncertainities on  and @xmath68 , as well as on other indirectly determined structure functions , following from observational errors , are best estimated by random number simulation having normal distribution with the half - width given by @xmath66 .",
    "there is an uncertainty following from the freedom in : choice of the regularization parameter @xmath67 , number of bins , @xmath71 , and number of the legendre polynomials , _ f. this has been discussed in @xcite .",
    "changes in @xmath71 may always be compensated by changes in @xmath67 and will not be discussed here .",

    "an increase in @xmath67 , as seen in eq .",
    "( [ x2 ] ) , causes an increase in @xmath72 , the same effect being caused by the decrease of _ f. specifying the maximum departure from the minimum value @xmath73 we can set an upper bound for @xmath67 and a lower bound for _",
    "f. concerning @xmath67 , one adds the requirement of avoiding artificial oscillations . dealing with the real data we may still distinguish the artificial oscillations from features implied by data .",
    "the former have the half - wavelength equal to the bin length and their amplitude increases sharply with the decrease of @xmath67 .",

    "concerning the density , we find :    @xmath142    also in this case , a large fraction of the error comes from the starting model .",
    "the essential output of helioseismology is the reconstruction of the sound speed profile .",
    "our discussion is in terms of the related quantity @xmath79 ; as well known , c@xmath143=@xmath144 and below the convective zone @xmath48 = 5/3 with an accuracy of 10@xmath145 or better .    by using the rls method , it is possible to derive directly the profile of @xmath79 as a function of the radial coordinate throughout all the sun , except for the inner region ( @xmath70 ) .",
    "the results ( values of @xmath79 , partial uncertaintes and global errors ) , are shown in table [ tavolona ] and fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] and are summarized in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "it is convenient to consider an intermediate solar region : @xmath146 .",
    "the upper limit is established by requiring that it is well below the transition to the convective zone , which we discussed above .",
    "the lower limit is chosen so as to exclude the region of energy production ( see next section ) .",
    "for this region the following comments are relevant :    a)each of the individual uncertainties nowhere exceeds 2  .",
    "b)uncertainties from the accuracy on the measured frequencies are of minor relevance with respect to the residual model dependence and to the sensitivity to the inversion parameters .",
    "c)all in all , even with the most conservative estimates , the helioseismological determination is extremely accurate : @xmath147 throughout the explored region .",
    "as well known , most of the energy and of solar neutrinos originate from the innermost part of the sun . according to ssm calculations , see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite , about 94% of the solar luminosity and 93% of the pp neutrinos are produced within @xmath148 , the region which we analyse in this section .",
    "our results , summarized in fig . [ fig1 ] and table [ tab1 ] , deserve the following comments : + i ) in the region 0.1@xmath1490.2 , where the rls method holds , the error intrinsic to the inversion method is dominant , and the global uncertainty , which worsens as one is going deeper into the sun , reaches @xmath150 1% .",
    "+ ii)at even smaller radii , where the hybrid method is used to determine the function @xmath107 , a large fraction of the error comes from the choice of @xmath108 and of @xmath80 , whereas the residual dependence on @xmath67 and @xmath9 is rather weak .",
    "the result is also essentially unsensitive to the starting model . on the other hand , errors on frequencies",
    "become important .",
    "this obviously corresponds to the fact that p - modes do not penetrate in the solar core , and consequently the information one can extract from available experimental results is limited .",
    "+ iii)we remind that the production of @xmath14be neutrinos is limited to a small region close to the solar center , the maximal production occurring at : @xmath151 according to @xcite .",
    "the @xmath15b neutrinos are generated even closer to the center , the maximal production being at @xcite : @xmath152 ( the exact locations of these maxima are somehow model dependent : for instance , in the solar model with helium and metal diffusion of ref .",
    "@xcite , hearafter referred to as bp95 , one has @xmath153",
    "@xmath154 0.055 and @xmath155 @xmath154 0.045 ) .",
    "one sees from table [ tab1 ] that @xmath156 ) and @xmath157 ) , as derived from the hybrid method , are globally known with an accuracy of about 2% .",
    "the average values around @xmath153 and @xmath158 given by the sola method are in agreement , within the quoted errors , with the results of the hybrid method .",
    "a few recent solar models will now be compared with the helioseismological information derived in the previous sections .    in this respect ,",
    "the predicted vs. observed properties of the convective envelope are particularly interesting , see table [ tab2 ] and fig .",
    "all solar models neglecting diffusion can not account for y@xmath11 and for the properties of the bottom of the convective zone ( @xmath12 and @xmath18 ) .",
    "models with diffusion of helium and heavier elements are much closer to the helioseismological determinations . among these ,",
    "bp95 and jcd yield values of y@xmath11 , r@xmath137 and @xmath18 in good agreement with helioseismological predictions .",
    "for understanding what is going on , let us concentrate on our own solar calculations .",
    "@xcite is our most recent solar model , including diffusion of he and heavier elements and using the livermore eos and the new livermore opacities for 19 elements @xcite according to the composition of @xcite .",
    "if diffusion is switched off , the resulting model ( franec96-nd ) is grossly inconsistent with helioseismology .",
    "franec96 looks much better in this respect .",
    "hovewer it slightly underestimates the depth of the convective zone ; as this is too shallow , the density at the bottom is too small ( and correspondingly the sound speed is somehow underestimated ) .",
    "if we use the older livermore opacities calculated for 12 elements , the resulting model ( franec96-old ) is in good agreement with helioseismology .    in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we show the difference between @xmath79 as predicted by selected solar models and the helioseismological determination , normalized to this latter .",
    "we remark that bp95 and jcd model are in agreement with helioseismology everywhere .",
    "sun24 , the model without diffusion of ref .",
    "@xcite yields a good profile of @xmath107 .",
    "we remind , hovewer , that it fails in predicting the properties of the convective envelope .",
    "this shows that the two approaches ( profile of @xmath79 and properties of the convective envelope ) are complementary and both important .",
    "franec96 underestimates @xmath79 by about 1% near the transition between the convective and radiative region , as already discussed . on the other hand , franec96-old ,",
    "as well as other models using older versions of the livermore opacities ( bp95 , jcd and sun24 ) look better .",
    "this does not imply some deficiency of the latest opacities .",
    "the important point , however , is that helioseismology can discriminate between models based on opacities which differ just by a few percent .",
    "this is best seen in fig.[fig5 ] where the profile of @xmath79 according to franec96 and franec96-old are compared , together with the relative differences @xmath159 between opacities , these latter being calculated at any point @xmath19 for the same value of @xmath53 , t and chemical composition ( given by franec96-old ) .    in conclusion",
    ", it seems to us that all these models with diffusion essentially pass the helioseimological tests .",
    "similar conclusions have been recently reached in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the inconsistency of mixed solar models with helioseismology is also discussed .",
    "we summarize here the main points of this paper :    * an extensive an possibly exhaustive investigation of uncertainties in helioseismic determinations of solar properties has been performed . * the accuracy on quantities characterizing the convective envelope ( y@xmath11 ,",
    "@xmath12 and @xmath18 ) has been studied , see table [ tab1 ] , as well as that on the squared isothermal sound speed , @xmath60 , along the solar profile , see fig .",
