    "ribosome is one of the largest and most complex intracellular cyclic molecular machines @xcite and it plays a crucial role in gene expression @xcite .",
    "it synthesizes a protein molecule , which is a hetero polymer of amino acid subunits , using a messenger rna ( mrna ) as the corresponding template ; this process is called _ translation _ ( of the genetic message ) .",
    "monomeric subunits of rna are nucleotides and triplets of nucleotides constitute a codon .",
    "the dictionary of translation relates each type of possible codon with one species of amino acid .",
    "thus , the sequence of amino acids on a protein is dictated by the sequence of codons on the corresponding template mrna .",
    "the polymerization of protein takes places in three stages which are identified as _ initiation _ ,",
    "_ elongation _ ( of the protein ) and _ termination_. in this paper we focus almost exclusively on the elongation stage .    a ribosome is often treated as a molecular motor for which the mrna template also serves as a track . in each step",
    "it moves forward on its track by one codon by consuming chemical fuel [ e.g. , two guanosine tri - phosphate(gtp ) molecules ] .",
    "simultaneously , in each step , it also elongates the protein by adding an amino acid ; the correct sequence of the amino acids required for polymerizing a protein is dictated by the codon sequence on the mrna template .",
    "therefore , it may be more appropriate to regard a ribosome as a mobile workshop that provides a platform for operation of several tools in a well coordinated manner .",
    "our main aim is to predict the effects of the mechano - chemical cycle of individual ribosomes , in the elongation stage , on their experimentally measurable physical properties .",
    "we first focus on the single - ribosome properties which characterize their stochastic movement on the track in the absence of inter - ribosome interactions .",
    "then we consider the additional effects of the steric interactions of the ribosomes and those of the rates of initiation and termination of translation on the collective spatio - temporal organization of the ribosomes on a track .",
    "the stochastic forward movement of a ribosome is characterized by an alternating sequence of pause and translocation .",
    "the sum of the durations of a pause and the following translocation defines the time of a dwell at the corresponding codon .",
    "recently , using an ingenious method , the distribution @xmath0 of the dwell times of a ribosome has been measured @xcite .",
    "we present a systematic derivation of this distribution from a detailed kinetic theory of translation which incorporates the mechano - chemical cycle of individual ribosomes .",
    "the _ exact _ analytical expression for @xmath0 which we derive here is , in general , a superposition of several exponentials . on the other hand ,",
    "it has been claimed @xcite that difference of two exponentials fit the experimentally measured @xmath0 very well .",
    "we reconcile these two observations by identifying the parameter regime where our theoretically derived @xmath0 is , indeed , well approximated by difference of two exponentials @xcite .",
    "moreover , we show that @xmath1 , inverse of the mean dwell time , satisfies a _ michaelis - menten - like equation _ @xcite .",
    "the reason for this feature of the mean dwell time is traced to the close formal similarity between the mechanochemical cycle of a ribosome and the catalytic cycle in the michaelis - menten theory of enzymes @xcite .",
    "the elongation of the growing protein by one amino acid is coupled to the translocation of the ribosome by one codon . therefore , @xmath1 is also the average velocity @xmath2 of a ribosome on the mrna track .",
    "an analytical expression for the average velocity of a molecular motor , whose mechano - chemical cycle is unbranched , was derived by fisher and kolomeisky @xcite in the context of motors involved in intracellular transport of cargoes @xcite .",
    "the mechano - chemical cycle of the ribosome in our model is , at least formally , a special case of the cycle in the fisher - kolomeisky model . in this special case",
    ", the fisher - kolomeisky formula for the average velocity of the molecular motor , indeed , reduces to the expression for @xmath1 in our model of ribosome .",
    "the average velocity of a ribosome can be reduced also by applying an external force ( called a load force ) that opposes the natural movement of the ribosome on its track .",
    "the force - velocity relation @xmath3 ( i.e. , the variation of the average velocity @xmath2 of a motor with increasing load force @xmath4 ) is one of the most important characteristics of a molecular motor . inspired by the recent progress in the single - ribosome imaging and manipulation techniques @xcite",
    ", we extend the formula for @xmath1 appropriately to derive @xmath3 for single ribosomes . the smallest load force",
    "which is just adequate to stall a molecular motor on its track is called the stall force @xmath5 .",
    "we also predict the dependence of @xmath5 on the availability of the amino acid monomers and the concentration of gtp molecules .",
    "our theoretical predictions for @xmath0 , @xmath3 and @xmath5 show explicitly how these quantities depend on various experimentally controllable parameters .",
    "deep understanding of these dependences will also help in controlling various features of @xmath0 , @xmath3 and @xmath5 . in principle",
    ", the validity and accuracy of our theoretical predictions can be tested by repeating _ in - vitro _ experiments of ref.@xcite for several different concentrations of the amino acid monomers and gtp molecules .",
    "often many ribosomes simultaneously move on the same mrna track , while each synthesizes separately a copy of the same protein .",
    "we refer to such collective movement of ribosomes on a mrna strand as ribosome traffic because of its superficial similarity with vehicular traffic @xcite . in most of the earlier theoretical studies of ribosome traffic",
    ", individual ribosomes have been modelled as hard rods and their steric interactions have been captured by mutual exclusion @xcite .",
    "thus , all those models may be regarded as totally asymmetric simple exclusion process ( tasep ) for hard rods @xcite . in some recent works @xcite",
    "we have extended these tasep - type models of ribosome traffic by capturing the essential steps of the mechano - chemical cycle of individual ribosomes .",
    "we have also reported the variation of the average rate of protein synthesis with increasing population density of the ribosomes on the track . in this work we present the phase diagrams of the model of ribosome traffic .    in the earlier tasep - type models of ribosome traffic @xcite ,",
    "the phase diagrams were plotted in a two - dimensional plane spanned by @xmath6 and @xmath7 , which determine the rates of initiation and termination . in this paper",
    "we plot the three - dimensional phase diagrams of our model of ribosome traffic @xcite in spaces spanned by three parameters which , for different diagrams , are selected from @xmath6 , @xmath7 , the availability of amino acid monomers and the rate of gtp hydrolysis .",
    "compared to the two - dimensional phase diagram of the tasep - type models of ribosome traffic , these three - dimensional phase diagrams provide deeper insight into the interplay of single ribosome - mechanochemistry and their collective spatio - temporal organization .",
    "traffic - like collective movements of ribosomes on a mrna track during translation of a gene was demonstrated many years ago by electron microscopy @xcite .",
    "however , to our knowledge , no attempt has been made so far to study the phase diagram of ribosome traffic by systematic quantitative measurements .",
    "but , in contrast to most of the earlier works , we have used experimentally controllable parameters to plot the phase diagrams .",
    "therefore , we hope , this paper will stimulate experimental studies of the phase diagrams by systematically varying the supply of amino acids ( monomeric subunits of protein ) and gtp molecules ( fuel of ribosomes ) in the solution .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ model ] we introduce the model of the mechano - chemical cycle of individual ribosomes .",
    "the exact dwell time distribution is calculated in section [ dwell ] , while the mean dwell time and the physical interpretations of the michaelis - menten - like equation are presented in section [ meandwell ] .",
    "the connection between the mean dwell time and average velocity of a ribosome are pointed out in section [ fvrel ] , where we also show the trends of variation of the force - velocity relation with variation of some key parameters of the model .",
    "the variance of the dwell time distribution and the diffusion constant of a ribosome are quantitative measures of fluctuations ; the analytical expressions of these quantities are presented in section [ fluc ] where their relationships are pointed out . the distribution of the run times of the ribosomes on their track and the relation of its first two moments with the corresponding moments of the dwell time distribution are discussed in section [ run ] .",
    "the effects of steric interactions among the ribosomes during their traffic - like collective movement on a single mrna track are studied in section [ interaction ] ; the overall rate of protein synthesis are presented in subsection [ flux ] while in subsection [ phase ] we plot the 3d phase diagrams of the model and also depict 2d projections to compare with the corresponding 2d phase diagrams of the tasep .",
    "finally , the results are summarized and main conclusions are drawn in section [ summary ] .",
    "\\(a ) +   + ( b ) +    the fig.[fig - fullcycle ] depicts the mechano - chemical cycle of each ribosome in the stage of elongation of the protein where the integer index @xmath8 labels the codons on the mrna track .",
    "the amino acid monomers are supplied to the ribosome in a form in which they form a complex with an adapter molecule called trna ; the complex is called aminoacyl - trna ( aatrna ) .",
    "each `` charged '' aatrna , bound to another protein called ef - tu , arrives at the ribosome from the surrounding medium .",
    "the arrival of the correct aatrna - ef - tu , as dictated by the mrna template , and its recognition by the ribosome located at the site @xmath8 triggers transition from the chemical state 1 to 2 in the same location with a transition rate @xmath9 .",
    "however , if the aatrna does not belong to the correct species , it is rejected , thereby causing the reverse transition from state 2 to state 1 with transition rate @xmath10 .",
    "hydrolysis of gtp drives the transition from state 2 to state 3 with the corresponding rate @xmath11 .",
    "release of the phosphate group , a product of the gtp hydrolysis , is responsible for the transition from state 3 to state 4 ; the corresponding rate constant is @xmath12 .",
    "the peptide bond formation between the newly arrived amino acid monomer and the growing protein , which leads to the elongation of the protein by one amino acid monomer , ( and some associated biochemical processes , including the arrival of the protein ef - g ) , is captured by the next transition to the state 5 with transition rate @xmath13 .",
    "all the subsequent processes , including the forward translocation of the ribosome by one codon , driven by the hydrolysis of another gtp molecule , and the exit of a naked trna from the ribosome complex are captured by a single effective transition from state 5 at site @xmath8 to the state @xmath14 at the site @xmath15 with the transition rate @xmath16 .",
    "the esssential processes of the cycle are summarized in the simplified figure [ fig - model ] .",
    "more detailed explanations of the states and the transitions are given in ref.@xcite .",
    "because of recent improvements in experimental techniques , it has become possible to image and manipulate single ribosomes @xcite . in the recent experiments on single - ribosome manipulation @xcite ,",
    "the distribution of the dwell times of a single ribosome at a codon was measured .",
    "it was also shown that the experimental data fit best to a difference of two exponentials .",
    "more recently , we @xcite have demonstrated that the numerical data obtained from computer simulations of our model can also be fitted to a difference of two exponentials . in this section",
    "we derive an exact analytical formula for the dwell time distribution in our model and compare it with the corresponding numerical data obtained from computer simulations .",
    "this analytical formula shows how the distribution of the dwell times can be controlled by tuning the rates of the various sub - steps of a mechanochemical cycle of the ribosome .",
    "this is a new prediction which , in principle , can be tested by repeating the _ in - vitro _ single ribosome experiments @xcite for different concentrations of gtp and aa - trna molecules .    for every ribosome , the dwell time is measured by an imaginary `` stopwatch '' which is reset to zero whenever the ribosome reaches the chemical state @xmath14 , _ for the first time _ , after arriving at a new codon ( say , @xmath15-th codon from the @xmath8-th codon ) . for the convenience of mathematical formulation , and for later comparison with the corresponding results of single molecule enzymatic kinetics",
    ", we make the following assumption : a ribosome finds itself in an excited state @xmath17 following the transition from the state @xmath18 to @xmath19 and , then , relaxes to its normal state @xmath20 with a rate constant @xmath21 .",
    "if the ribosome relaxes very rapidly from the state @xmath17 to the state @xmath14 , we can set @xmath22 at the end of the calculation .",
    "let @xmath23 be the probability of finding a ribosome at site @xmath8 , in the chemical state @xmath24 at time @xmath25 . for our calculations in this section",
    ", we do not need to write the site index @xmath8 explicitly .",

    "moreover , similar trend is observed also in the variation of the most probable dwell time with the decrease of @xmath16 .",
    "the trend of variation of the width of the distribution will be discussed later in section[fluc ] of this paper .      in the special case @xmath55 , @xmath56 where",

    "the form of the expression ( [ eq - ftwp0 ] ) of @xmath0 makes the underlying physics very transparent- @xmath0 is a superposition of five different terms each of which decays exponentially with one of the five rate constants .",

    "one can envisage several different possible situations where two or more rate constants have identical numerical values @xcite . in order to demonstrate that the form of @xmath0 can get modified under such special conditions , in this subsection we consider a very special case where @xmath62 and all the nonvanishing rate constants are equal , i.e. , @xmath63 . in this case",
    "the master equations become much simpler and the expression for @xmath0 simplifies to the gamma distribution @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the gamma function with @xmath66 .",

    "then , the eqn .",

    "the mm equation is derived for the enzymatic cycle shown in fig.[fig - mmreac ] where the enzyme @xmath76 enhances the rate of the reaction that converts the substrates @xmath77 into the product @xmath78 . in that case",
    "the maximum rate of the reaction is given by @xmath79 while the michaelis constant is @xmath80 .",
    "the steps of the mechano - chemical cycle of an individual ribosome , as re - drawn in fig.[fig - ribomm ] , are very similar to those of the generalized mm - like enzymatic cycle shown in fig.[fig - mmreac](b ) .",
    "the fact that the mean dwell time for the ribosomes follows a mm - like equation is consistent with the experimental observations in recent years @xcite that the average rate of an enzymatic reaction catalyzed by a single enzyme molecule is , most often , given by the same mm equation .    for our model",
    ", we can interpret @xmath81 as the average rate at which a protein is synthesized by a ribosome , where aatrna plays the role of the substrate and the protein elongated by one amino acid is the product . in the limit of effectively infinite supply of trna molecules , on the average",
    ", time required to complete one cycle would be the sum of the times required to complete the remaining steps of the cycle each of which has been assumed to be completely irreversible .",
    "this intuitive expectation for the maximum speed of protein synthesis is consistent with the analytical form ( [ eq - vmax ] ) of @xmath82 .",
    "furthermore , in the expression ( [ eq - km ] ) for the michaelis constant the effective rate constants @xmath83 and @xmath84 are the counterparts of @xmath85 and @xmath86 , respectively , of fig.[fig - mmreac](a ) .",
    "therefore , so far as the average speed is concerned , the actual mechano - cycle , shown in fig.[fig - ribomm ] , for a single ribosome can be replaced by the simpler mm - like cycle shown in fig.[fig - riboeffmm ] where @xmath87 is the counterpart of @xmath88 , in the limit @xmath89 , the mechano - chemical cycle of a ribosome in our model reduces to the enzymatic cycle shown in fig.[fig - mmreac](a ) . in this limit , @xmath90 and ,",
    "hence , the expressions ( [ eq - vmax ] ) and ( [ eq - km ] ) reduce to the corresponding expressions for @xmath82 and @xmath91 in the mm equation for enzymes .    in reality , however , a ribosome itself is a ribonucleoprotein complex that is not an enzyme , but provides a platform where several distinct catalysts catalyze the respective specific reactions .",
    "for example , the gtpases enhance hydrolysis of gtp molecules while the peptidyl transferase catalyzes the formation of the peptide bond between the incoming amino acid monomer and the growing polypeptide .",
    "our derivation of the mm - like equation is different from the derivation of mm - like equation for cytoskeletal motors reported in ref .",

    "jackson et al.@xcite modelled the process of translation as an enzymatic reaction . however , there are crucial differences between their formulation of translation and our interpretation of the mechano - chemical cycle in our model . in their formulation ,",
    "jackson et al.@xcite treated the completely synthesized protein as the product of the enzymatic reaction , i.e. , the run of a single ribosome from the initiation site to the termination site was treated as a single enzymatic reaction .",

    "<S> synthesis of protein molecules in a cell are carried out by ribosomes . </S>",
    "<S> a ribosome can be regarded as a molecular motor which utilizes the input chemical energy to move on a messenger rna ( mrna ) track that also serves as a template for the polymerization of the corresponding protein . </S>",
    "<S> the forward movement , however , is characterized by an alternating sequence of translocation and pause . using a quantitative model , which captures the mechanochemical cycle of an individual ribosome </S>",
    "<S> , we derive an _ </S>",
    "<S> exact _ analytical expression for the distribution of its dwell times at the successive positions on the mrna track . </S>",
    "<S> inverse of the average dwell time satisfies a `` michaelis - menten - like '' equation and is consistent with the general formula for the average velocity of a molecular motor with an unbranched mechano - chemical cycle . extending this formula appropriately </S>",
    "<S> , we also derive the exact force - velocity relation for a ribosome . </S>",
    "<S> often many ribosomes simultaneously move on the same mrna track , while each synthesizes a copy of the same protein . </S>",
    "<S> we extend the model of a single ribosome by incorporating steric exclusion of different individuals on the same track . </S>",
    "<S> we draw the phase diagram of this model of ribosome traffic in 3-dimensional spaces spanned by experimentally controllable parameters . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest new experimental tests of our theoretical predictions . </S>"
