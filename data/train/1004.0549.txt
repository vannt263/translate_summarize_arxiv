    "the electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) mechanism remains an open question in spite of the success of the standard model ( sm ) compared with the precision measurement data . with the advent of the new collider technique ,",
    "high energy and high intensity photon beams can be obtained by using compton laser photons scattering off the colliding electron and positron beams @xcite .",
    "the collisions of high energy photons produced at the linear collider provide a comprehensive laboratory for testing the sm and probing new physics beyond the sm @xcite .",
    "as we know , the initial technicolor ( tc ) @xcite , as a theory of dynamical ewsb , is one of the important candidates for new physics beyond the sm , especially the topcolor assisted technicolor ( tc2 ) model proposed by c. t. hill @xcite .",
    "this combines technicolor with topcolor , with the former mainly responsible for ewsb and the latter for generating a major part of the top quark mass . since this model could provide rational answers to some of the questions , it is of significant interest",
    "this model predicts three top - pions ( @xmath8 ) and one top - higgs ( @xmath6 ) with large yukawa couplings to the third generation quarks , so these new particles can be regarded as a typical feature of the model .",
    "many signals of the model have already been studied in the work environment of linear colliders and hadron hadron colliders @xcite , but much of the attention was focused on the neutral and charged top pions and new gauge bosons . here",
    "we wish to discuss the prospects of neutral top - higgs .    in the sm ,",

    "@xcite , the authors have calculated the associated production of neutral top - pion with a heavy - quark pair in @xmath0 collisions . in this paper , we will study the associated production of a neutral top - higgs with a heavy - quark pair in @xmath14 collisions at the international linear collider ( ilc ) .",
    "as a rough estimate , we only consider the process @xmath16 @xmath17 at the tree level .",

    "@xmath43 vanishes for @xmath44 . in order to avoid the creation of @xmath13 pairs by the interaction of the incident and backscattered photons , we require @xmath45 , which implies",
    "@xmath46 @xcite . for the choice @xmath47",

    "energies of the ilc , we choose @xmath55 according to the ilc reference design report @xcite .    according to the idea of tc2 , the masses of the first and second generation quarks are all generated by the extended tc ( etc ) interactions .",
    "then , the difference between @xmath56 and @xmath57 for , respectively , the coupling coefficients techniquark to up- and down - type quarks reflects the mass difference between the charm and strange quarks @xcite .",
    "so we have @xmath58 , where @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the top- and bottom - quark masses generated by etc interactions , respectively .",

    "are all model - dependent .",
    "we select them as free parameters , @xmath63 and @xmath64 , to estimate the total cross section of @xmath15 associated production in the high energy photon collisions at the ilc .",
    "the final numerical results are summarized in figs .",

    "energy @xmath68 is too low to produce it , we only consider the case of @xmath69 . from this figure , we can see that : ( i ) the cross section decreases rapidly as @xmath66 increases .",
    "this is natural since the phase space is depressed strongly by large @xmath66 ; ( ii ) the decrease in the cross section is slight , with @xmath62 from @xmath70 , @xmath71 to @xmath72 ; and ( iii ) the maximum of the cross section reaches the level of a few @xmath2 when @xmath73 .     the total cross section of @xmath74 versus @xmath66 with @xmath69 for @xmath75 ( solid ) , @xmath71 ( dashed ) and @xmath72 ( dot - dashed ) . ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : eps3 ] ( a ) and ( b ) , we plot the distributions of the transverse momenta of the final states ( @xmath76 and @xmath77 ) for the process @xmath78 at the ilc . because of the @xmath79 conservation , the distributions of the transverse momentum of anti - top quark , @xmath80 , should be the same as that of @xmath81 shown in fig .",
    "3 ( a ) . from these two diagrams , we can find that , ( i ) when @xmath82 gev , the signs of associated production @xmath83 in the regions around @xmath84 gev and @xmath85 gev are more significant than in other regions , ( i ) when @xmath86 gev , the significant regions of associated production @xmath83 are around @xmath87 gev and @xmath88 gev .",
    "however , their widths are rather large but their values are quite small .     the distributions of the transverse momenta of the final states ( @xmath76 and @xmath77 ) for the process @xmath78 at the ilc with @xmath69 .",

    "[ fig : eps4 ] gives the results of another associated production @xmath90 in @xmath0 collisions .",
    "we find that the cross section of @xmath90 production is much smaller than that of @xmath1 production and is only of the order of @xmath91 .",
    "therefore , it is difficult to detect indirectly @xmath6 via the process @xmath92 at the ilc .     the curve of @xmath93 vs. @xmath66 for @xmath68 ( solid ) , @xmath94 ( dashed ) . ]    we know that the ilc is the important next generation linear collider . according to the ilc reference design report @xcite , the ilc is determined to run with @xmath95 gev ( upgradeable to @xmath96 gev ) , and the total luminosity required is @xmath97 for the first four - year operation and @xmath98 during the first phase of operation with @xmath95 gev .",
    "it means that hundreds of to thousands of @xmath6 per year can be produced in high energy photon collisions at the ilc .",
    "the cross section of the higgs boson in the sm associated production with a pair of top quarks in the high energy photon collisions is at the level of a few @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the study of the process @xmath9 @xmath10 in the mssm shows that the associated @xmath99 production is dominant when @xmath100 is not too large , with the cross section of @xmath101 or higher for the favorable parameters @xcite .",
    "for the effects of the little higgs models on @xmath11 production via @xmath0 collision at linear colliders , the authors of ref .",

    "its cross section is basically consistent with the results of the cross section of @xmath4 in the sm and the cross section of @xmath5 in the mssm at the level of a few @xmath2 .",
    "therefore , if the ilc experiment could detect a scalar particle , we need to affirm which model it is from , and it will further require more experimental data and theoretical analysis .    in summary , we have studied the associated production processes of a neutral top - higgs in the tc2 model with a pair of heavy quarks in @xmath0 collisions at the ilc .",
