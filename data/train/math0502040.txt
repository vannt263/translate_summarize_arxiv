    "the shapiro conjecture for grassmannians  @xcite has driven progress in enumerative real algebraic geometry  @xcite , which is the study of real solutions to geometric problems .",
    "it conjectures that a ( zero - dimensional ) intersection of schubert subvarieties of a grassmannian consists entirely of real points  if the schubert subvarieties are given by flags osculating a real rational normal curve .",
    "this particular geometric problem can be interpreted in terms of real linear series on @xmath0 with prescribed ( real ) ramification  @xcite , real rational curves in @xmath1 with real flexes  @xcite , linear systems theory  @xcite , and the bethe ansatz and fuchsian equations  @xcite .",
    "the shapiro conjecture has implications for all these areas .",
    "massive computational evidence  @xcite as well as its proof by eremenko and gabrielov for grassmannians of codimension 2 subspaces  @xcite give compelling evidence for its validity . a local version , that it holds when the schubert varieties are special ( a technical term ) and when the points of osculation are sufficiently clustered  @xcite , showed that the special schubert calculus is fully real ( such geometric problems can have all their solutions real ) .",
    "that result was generalized by vakil  @xcite ( using other methods ) to show that the general schubert calculus on the grassmannian is fully real .",
    "the original shapiro conjecture was that such an intersection of schubert varieties in a would consist entirely of real points .",
    "unfortunately , this fails for the first non - trivial enumerative problem on a non - grassmannian flag manifold ( see section  [ s : f124 ] ) , but in a very interesting way .",
    "this failure was first noted in  @xcite and a more symmetric counterexample was found in  @xcite , where computer experimentation suggested that the conjecture would hold if the points where the flags osculated the rational normal curve satisfied a certain non - crossing condition .",
    "further experimentation led to a precise formulation of this refined non - crossing conjecture in  @xcite .",
    "that conjecture was only valid for two- and three- step flag manifolds , and the further experimentation reported here leads to a version ( conjecture  [ c : main ] ) for all flag manifolds in which the points of osculation satisfy a monotonicity property .",
    "we systematically investigate the shapiro conjecture for flag manifolds to gain a deeper understanding both of its failure and of our refinement .",
    "our investigation includes 12 gigahertz - years of computer experimentation and theorems relating our monotone conjecture for different enumerative problems .",
    "recently , our conjecture was proven by eremenko , gabrielov , shapiro , and vainshtein  @xcite for manifolds of flags consisting of a codimension 2 plane lying on a hyperplane .",

    "if the order of @xmath12 and @xmath13 were switched , then the evaluation would not be monotone .",
    "we computed 100,000 instances of this polynomial system at different ordered parameter values , and each had 12 real solutions .",
    "in contrast , we found non - monotone evaluations for which not all solutions were real , and the minimum number of real solutions that we observed depended on the combinatorics of the evaluation .",

    "one unusual problem we looked at was on the flag manifold @xmath187 and it involved four identical , but non - grassmannian conditions , @xmath188 .",
    "it always had real solutions , and by using some geometric reasoning we can prove that is always the case .",
    "another interesting feature of this problem is that its galois group  @xcite is not the full symmetric group @xmath192 , but rather the symmetric group @xmath193 .",
    "this is the smallest known example of an enumerative geometric problem in the schubert calculus whose galois group is not the full symmetric group , and it is strikingly small .    a final phenomena that we discovered is a schubert problem which is not transverse , when it involves flags osculating a rational normal curve .",
