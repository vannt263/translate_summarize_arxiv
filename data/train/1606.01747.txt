    "the measurement of the electric dipole moment ( edm ) of elementary particles is a crucial issue to particle physics .",
    "this is because for a non - degenerate system , as a nucleus or an elementary particle , an edm is possible only if the symmetries under @xmath1 and @xmath2 are violated . on one hand , in the standard model ( sm ) framework",
    "the only source of @xmath1 and @xmath2 violation is the phase @xmath3 in the ckm mixing matrix . on the other hand ,",
    "the sm prediction for the neutron electric dipole moment ( edm ) is @xmath4 cm @xcite , six orders of magnitude below the actual experimental limit of @xmath5 or an upper limit of @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "hence , we see that in the context of the standard model the kobayashi - maskawa phase is not enough for explaining an edm with a value near the experimental limit for both electron and neutron . if the latter case is confirmed in future experiments , it certainly means the discovery of new physics with new @xmath2 violation sources .",
    "moreover , cosmology also hints that the sm may not be a complete description and that new @xmath0 violating phases must exist in models beyond the sm in order to explain the observed matter ",
    "anti - matter asymmetry of the universe  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we are led to explore alternatives to the sm , in our case we consider the minimal 3 - 3 - 1 model ( m331 for short ) with a heavy sextet  @xcite . however , in this work we will only be concerned with the edm issue .    the 3 - 3 - 1 models are interesting extensions of the standard model which can give some insight in the issue of the number of generations and the value of @xmath7 .",
    "moreover , some of these models having vector - quarks with exotic electric charge and at least one neutral scalar coupling with the exotic quarks can explain the 750 gev resonance observed at lhc .",
    "see for instance @xcite , and references therein .",
    "although this resonance has not been confirmed by recent atlas  @xcite and cms  @xcite data , it is clear that if resonances around 1 - 2 tev are discovered in the near future , this model certainly will be able to give it an explanation .",
    "the edm of electron and neutron in the context of the 3 - 3 - 1 model with heavy leptons ( 331hl for short ) has been considered in refs .",
    "the representation content in the quark sector is the same as in the minimal 3 - 3 - 1 model , but the number of the scalar multiplets in the former are larger and include a scalar sextet , under the @xmath8 it transforms as @xmath9 , which is needed to give the correct mass to the charged leptons .",
    "however , the degrees of freedom of the sextet decouple when its fields @xmath10 are heavy , inducing nonrenormalizable interactions between the triplets giving mass to the charged leptons , while the neutrino masses are obtained if we also add right - handed neutrinos transforming trivially under the gauge symmetry of the model and using the type i seesaw mechanism .",

    "the electric charge operator is given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the electron charge , @xmath13 ( being @xmath14 the gell - mann matrices ) and @xmath15 is the hypercharge operator associated to the @xmath16 group . in the following subsections we present the field content of the model , with its charges associated to each group on the parentheses , in the form ( @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath16 ) .      in this , as in other 3 - 3 - 1 models , there are many phases in the mixing matrices .",
    "even if the phases in the ckm mixing matrix are absorbed in the quark fields , they appear in the interactions of the fermions with heavy vector and scalar bosons  @xcite . here",
    "we will consider that the only source of @xmath2 violation phases are in the scalar sector and one of its trilinear couplings .",

    "we will consider only @xmath19 to be complex .",
    "hence , we begin with the following phases ( the notation is @xmath21 ) : @xmath22 and @xmath23 of @xmath24 and @xmath19 , respectively .",
