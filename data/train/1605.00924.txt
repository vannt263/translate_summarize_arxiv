    "black saturn is an interesting black object in higher dimensions , where a black hole is surrounded by a black ring @xcite .",
    "the black ring and the black hole are in thermodynamic equilibrium with each other @xcite .",
    "this thermodynamic equilibrium is obtained because of the rotation of the black ring .",
    "however , it is also possible to obtain thermodynamically stable black saturn solutions with a static black ring @xcite . in this case ,",
    "the black hole remains in thermodynamic equilibrium with the static black ring because of an external magnetic field .",
    "it may be noted that conditions for meta - stability of a black saturn have also been studied @xcite .",
    "it has been demonstrated that the black saturn is causal stably on the closure of the domain of outer communications @xcite .",
    "it has been possible to obtain a relation between the black saturn and myers - perry black holes @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the thermodynamics of charged black rings and a dilatonic black saturn has been analyzed using einstein - maxwell - dilaton theory in five dimensions .",
    "@xcite . in this paper",
    ", we will analyze the effects of thermal fluctuations on the thermodynamics of this charged dilatonic black saturn . + it is possible to study the thermodynamics of black saturn as an entropy is associated with all black objects .",
    "this is needed to prevent the violation of the second law of thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "this is because the entropy of the universe would spontaneous reduce when an object would crosses the horizon of any black object , if we do not associate an entropy with that black object .",
    "so , in order to prevent the violation of second law of thermodynamics for all black objects , an entropy is associated with them .",
    "in fact , black holes have more entropy than any other object with the same volume @xcite .",
    "this maximum entropy which is associated with a black holes is proportional to the area of the horizon @xcite .",
    "the fact that this entropy scales with the area and not the volume of the black holes has lead to the development of the holographic principle @xcite .",
    "according to the holographic principle the degrees of freedom in a region of space are equal to the degrees of freedom on the boundary surrounding that region of space .",
    "it is expected that this holographic principle will get modified near planck scale @xcite . +",
    "it is generally expected that any thermodynamical system will undergo thermal fluctuations .",
    "these thermal fluctuations will lead to corrections in the thermodynamics of that system . as black holes are also thermodynamic systems",
    ", they will also be effected by thermal fluctuations .",
    "in fact , the effect of such thermal fluctuations on the entropy of the black holes has been analyzed @xcite .",
    "these thermal fluctuations modify the entropy - area law of the black holes .",
    "this is an interesting result as in jacobson formalism , that the einstein s equation can be derived from the first law of thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "this is done by requiring that the clausius relation holds for all the local rindler causal horizons through each space - time point . as there exists a relation between the geometry of black holes and thermodynamics",
    ", we expect that thermal fluctuations will also give rise to the fluctuations of the metric in jacobson thermodynamic formalism .",
    "hence , we can expect that these thermal fluctuations in the thermodynamic of black holes to occur because of quantum fluctuations in the geometry of space - time .",
    "we can neglect such fluctuations for large black holes .",
    "however , as the black holes reduce in size due to hawking radiation , the effect of quantum fluctuations on the geometry of the black holes can not be neglected .",
    "thus , at this stage , the effect of thermal fluctuations on the thermodynamics of black holes also can not be neglected . + it is interesting to note that the thermal fluctuations correct the entropy of the black holes by a logarithmic terms @xcite .",
    "this is because such logarithmic corrections also occur in various different approaches to quantum gravity .",
    "in fact , non - perturbative quantum general relativity has been used for calculating the corrections to the thermodynamics of black holes @xcite . in this approach ,",
    "the leading order corrections to the entropy of a black hole are logarithmic corrections .",
    "these logarithmic corrections have been calculated from the density of states of a black hole .",
    "this density of states are calculated using the conformal blocks of a well defined conformal field theory .",
    "such logarithmic correction have also been calculated using the cardy formula @xcite .",
    "the logarithmic correction for a btz have been obtained using an exact partition function @xcite .",
    "such corrections terms have also been obtained by analyze the effect of matter fields surrounding a black hole @xcite .",
    "+ the string theory considerations have also lead to logarithmic corrections in the entropy of black holes @xcite .",
    "in fact , such corrections terms have been also obtained for dilatonic black holes @xcite .",
    "the studies done on the partition function of a black hole have also lead to such logarithmic correction @xcite .",
    "the generalized uncertainty principle has also been used for calculating the corrections to the thermodynamics of a black hole @xcite .",
    "the entropy of a black hole gets modified by the generalized uncertainty principle .",
    "the correction terms obtained this way can be expressed as logarithmic functions of the area of the horizon . +",
    "it may be noted that quantum fluctuations become important for all black geometries , when the size of the such geometries is sufficiently reduced .",
    "so , at such small scales the thermal fluctuations also become important for all black geometries .",
    "the effect of thermal fluctuations on the thermodynamics of an ads charged black hole has already been analyzed @xcite .",
    "this was done by relating the fluctuations in the entropy of this black hole to a conformal field theory .",
    "furthermore , the effect of thermal fluctuations on the thermodynamics of a black saturn has also been studied @xcite .",
    "this was done by relating the fluctuations in the entropy of the black saturn to the fluctuations in its energy .",
    "however , so far no work has been done on the effect of thermal fluctuations on the thermodynamics of a charged dilatonic black saturn .",
    "so , in this paper , we will analyze the effects of thermal fluctuations on the thermodynamics of a charged dilatonic black saturn .",
    "we will first analyze the thermal fluctuations of the charged dilatonic black saturn by relating the fluctuations in the entropy of the charged dilatonic black saturn to the fluctuations in its energy .",
    "then we will use the relation between the fluctuations in the entropy and a conformal field theory to analyze the effect of such thermal fluctuations .",
    "we will demonstrate that both these approaches lead to the same physical effects for the charged dilatonic black saturn .",
    "in this section , we review some basic properties of charged dilatonic black saturn @xcite .",
    "the metric for black saturn can be written as @xcite @xmath0^{2}\\nonumber\\\\ & + & v_{\\beta}(\\rho , z)^{-\\frac{1}{3}}h_{x}\\left[k^{2}p(d\\rho^{2}+dz^{2})+\\frac{g_{y}}{h_{y}}d\\psi^{2}+\\frac{g_{x}}{h_{x}}d\\varphi^{2}\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are constants , and @xmath3 is related to the charge of the black saturn .",
    "furthermore , we also have @xmath4 and @xmath5 here , we have used @xmath6 and @xmath7 here @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) are real constant parameters which satisfy @xmath10 the non - zero components of the vector potential are given by , @xmath11 and the dilaton function is given by , @xmath12 furthermore , we also have @xmath13,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are real constants , and @xmath16 with @xmath17 here @xmath18 is expressed as @xmath19,\\ ] ] where @xmath20 and @xmath21 given by the relation ( [ b4 ] ) .",
    "free parameters of this model are fixed as @xcite , @xmath22 and @xmath23 we also have @xmath24 and @xmath25 where , @xmath26 with @xmath27 .",
    "here we have @xmath28 the variable @xmath1 can be written as @xmath29 thus , all the thermodynamics quantities can be written in terms of @xmath8 with @xmath30 .",
    "+ the hawking temperatures for the charged dilatonic black saturn is given by @xcite , @xmath31 where @xmath32 here we have used @xmath33 .",
    "it may be noted that @xmath34 gives a naked singularity .",
    "the entropy of the charged dilatonic black saturn , in absence of thermal fluctuations , is given by @xmath35 the adm mass of the charged dilatonic black saturn is given by , @xmath36c^{2}\\right)}{4k_{3}(1+k_{2}c)^{2}},\\ ] ] which can interpreted as enthalpy @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "the results for the ordinary black saturn are recovered when @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "now if @xmath8 are depend to each other , then one can express @xmath8 in terms of @xmath39 .",
    "so , all the thermodynamical relation can express in terms of @xmath39 .",
    "it is possible to write @xmath40 such that the condition ( [ b5 ] ) is satisfied . even though this is a special choice , and we can show that , for any other choice of @xmath41 ( @xmath42 and @xmath43 ) , we will get similar results .",

    ", we give plots of @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 in terms of @xmath39 .",
    "surprisingly , we can see that @xmath48 behaves like @xmath47 , so we can write @xmath49 .",

    "so , we obtain simple expressions for the temperature and the entropy of this black saturn . in the fig .",

    "@xmath56 and @xmath57 can be expressed using simple functions . as it illustrated by solid red lines of the fig .",

    "the thermal fluctuations correct the thermodynamics of all black objects .",
    "this happens because they correct the partition function for these black objects .",
    "thus , various different thermodynamical quantities get corrected because of these thermal fluctuations .",
    "it is interesting to note that the entropy of these black objects get corrected by a logarithmic term .",
    "so , if @xmath77 is the temperature for the system close to equilibrium , and @xmath78 is the equilibrium temperature of the system , then we have @xmath79 where @xmath80 . by using the fact that this second derivative of the entropy can be expressed in terms of the fluctuation of energy near the equilibrium",
    ", this expression for the total entropy can be written as @xcite , @xmath81 where @xmath82 or @xmath83 .",
    "furthermore , almost all different approaches to quantum gravity generate the logarithmic correction term , but the coefficient of this term varies between different approaches , it is useful to keep this analysis general and introduce a general parameter @xmath84 . here",

    "so , we can express the specific heat as @xmath142 the specific heat obtained here is similar to the specific heat obtained before in ( [ tf12 - 1 ] ) .",
