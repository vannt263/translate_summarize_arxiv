    "in high - energy heavy - ion experiments @xcite like those now performed at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) , the collisions are often categorized according to their centrality aiming to separate the central head - on collisions from the peripheral ones in which only the edges of the nuclei collide .",
    "this has been generally realized by sorting the events according to the amount of particles or energy deposited in specific parts of the detector , details varying from one experiment to another @xcite . in its simplicity",
    ", the idea is that in increasingly central collisions the colliding nuclei disintegrate more completely thereby producing more particles . in nucleus - nucleus collisions , an existence of a correspondence between the intuitive geometrical notion of centrality and its experimental determination",
    "is supported by the systematics of azimuthal anisotropies @xcite in the spectra of low - transverse - momentum ( low-@xmath0 ) particles @xcite which , in models based on classical collective dynamics @xcite are readily interpreted as reflecting the initial geometry of the collision zone .",
    "similar experimental procedures in proton - nucleus collisions at the lhc have revealed much stronger centrality dependence of hard - process observables , like high-@xmath0 jets @xcite , than what was anticipated e.g. from models for impact - parameter dependent nuclear effects in parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) @xcite . at the same time , however , the minimum - bias versions of the same jet observables  obtained by `` integrating out '' the variable used for the centrality classification  are in good agreement @xcite with the predictions based on collinearly factorized quantum chromo dynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "this appears to indicate that the current experimental methods to realize the centrality classification seriously interfere @xcite with the hard processes and , among other proposals @xcite , it has been argued @xcite that even the standard energy - momentum conservation plays a significant role . on top of this , the presence of event - by - event fluctuations in the initial profile of nucleons inside nucleus can further distort the multiplicity - based experimental centrality classification . in the aggregate ,",
    "the way that the centrality - selected measurements in proton - nucleus collisions should be interpreted has turned out largely ambiguous . in nucleus - nucleus collisions interferences between the hard processes and the centrality categorization",
    "are of less importance as the multiplicity of low-@xmath0 particles used in the events centrality classification is much larger and the correlations get diluted .    in this letter",
    ", we will discuss a centrality - dependent effect ( in its geometric meaning ) which stems from the fact that in spherical , neutron - rich nuclei the concentration of neutrons is known to increase towards the nuclear surface @xcite .",
    "we demonstrate how this causes effects in electroweak processes that should be large enough to be measured at the lhc and could thereby help in resolving open issues concerning the relationship between theoretical concept of centrality and its experimental counterpart .",
    "the density of nucleons @xmath1 in a spherical nucleus @xmath2 is often parametrized using the two - parameter fermi ( 2pf ) distribution as @xmath3 where the half - density parameter @xmath4 controls size of the nuclear core and @xmath5 the thickness of the nuclear surface .",
    "the saturation densities @xmath6 are determined by requiring the total amount of protons and neutrons to remain constant ( we consider only @xmath7pb nucleus in this paper ) , @xmath8 it is an experimental fact @xcite that in neutron - rich spherical nuclei the relative amount of neutrons in comparison to protons increases near the surface of the nucleus .",
    "this is usually referred to as neutron - skin effect : in short , the coulomb barrier that builds up from the positively charged protons limits the extent that the proton density can stretch out whereas , being blind to the coulomb interaction , the neutrons can be found further away @xcite .",
    "the most recent measurement of this phenomenon @xcite for @xmath7pb nucleus indicates that the neutron skin does not , unlike its name suggests , have a sharp edge but rather a `` halo - like '' character .",
    "as shown in the left - hand panel of figure  [ fig : densityratio ] , the proton - to - neutron ratio , @xmath9 , does not drop abruptly but the fall - off towards the edge of the nucleus is gradual . in this plot ( and throughout the rest of this paper ) we have used the parameter values @xmath10 , @xmath11 for protons , and @xmath12 , @xmath13 for neutrons , taken from ref .",

    "the nucleon - nucleon hard - process cross sections @xmath31 can , in general , depend on the size of the nuclei ( via nuclear shadowing or equivalent @xcite ) and even on the spatial location of the nucleons inside the nuclei @xcite .",

    ". it turns out that for symmetric a+a collisions ( for the centrality categories considered here ) , @xmath35 and we can visualize a given centrality class @xmath25 as simply containing events from collisions of two nuclei with effective number of protons @xmath36 and neutrons @xmath37 defined as @xmath38 the case of proton - nucleus collisions can be obtained by replacing the 2pf - distribution for the projectile proton by a delta function @xmath39 . as a result ,",
    "the hard - scattering cross section becomes @xmath40 with @xmath41 and the effective nucleus which the projectile proton `` sees '' consists of @xmath42 protons and neutrons , respectively . to evaluate the effective number of nucleons in each case , we have used @xmath43 ( for pb+pb ) , and @xmath44 ( for p+pb ) for the inelastic nucleon - nucleon cross sections @xcite .",

    "( [ eq : npaa ] ) , the effect of neutron skin in lead - lead starts to be visible in more central collision than in the case of proton - lead .",
    "this observation also hints that our assumption of a point - like proton makes the centrality - dependent effects slightly weaker than what would be obtained by assigning the proton with a finite size .",
    "to make the variations in proton - to - neutron ratio visible , an observable for which @xmath49 is required . as the only significant difference between the protons and neutrons is their @xmath50 and @xmath51 valence - quark content ,",

    "( [ eq : xs ] ) we see that this happens towards negative values of @xmath57 ( the `` backward '' direction ) .",

    "since the main contributions to the cross sections come from the @xmath90 and @xmath91 partonic channels @xcite and the sea - quark distributions at small @xmath87 and large factorization scale @xmath92 are approximately flavor independent , @xmath93 , we can approximate @xmath94 f_{u_{\\rm v}}^{\\rm p,{\\mathcal{c}_k}}(\\xi_2 ^ -,q^2 ) + f_{d_{\\rm v}}^{\\rm p,{\\mathcal{c}_k}}(\\xi_2 ^ -,q^2 ) }        { \\left [ z_{\\rm eff}^{{\\rm ppb}}({\\mathcal{c}_k})/n_{\\rm eff}^{{\\rm ppb}}({\\mathcal{c}_k } ) \\right ] f_{d_{\\rm v}}^{\\rm p,{\\mathcal{c}_k}}(\\xi_2 ^ -,q^2 ) + f_{u_{\\rm v}}^{\\rm p,{\\mathcal{c}_k}}(\\xi_2 ^ -,q^2)}. \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as @xmath95 , the derivative of this expression with respect to @xmath96 is positive and , in line with figure  [ fig : ppb_central_to_pheri ] , the ratio @xmath97 decreases towards more peripheral collisions ( since @xmath96 decreases ) . towards positive values of @xmath57 ( the `` forward '' direction )",

    "we have discussed the generic effects that mutually different spatial distributions of protons and neutrons in heavy nuclei are expected to induce in production of w@xmath117 bosons at the lhc .",
    "the proton density is known to fall off more rapidly than that of neutrons towards the surface of neutron - rich nuclei like @xmath7pb which , as we have demonstrated , correlates with the sign of the produced w@xmath117 boson .",

    "we stress that in this paper we have considered the centrality from a purely geometric viewpoint neglecting e.g. possible smearing of the effect that could be caused by event - by - event fluctuations .",
    "therefore , our results should be taken as first , rough estimates of the expected systematics if a given experimental centrality - selection method truly reflects the collision geometry .",
    "the effects caused by neutron skin are , of course , not limited to w@xmath117 production but related phenomena are to be expected e.g. in the case of high-@xmath0 photons and charged hadrons which can also be measured at lower center - of - mass energies like those available at the relativistic heavy - ion collider ( rhic ) . in the case of lepton - nucleus deeply - inelastic scattering ,",
    "the neutron skin should affect differently the neutral- and charged - current reactions .",
    "thus , the neutron - skin effect could serve as a handle to study the centrality also at planned deeply - inelastic scattering experiments like the electron - ion collider @xcite or lhec @xcite .",

    "<S> the concept of centrality in high - energy nuclear collisions has recently become a subject of an active debate . in particular , the experimental methods to determine the centrality that have given reasonable results for many observables in high - energy lead - lead collisions at the lhc </S>",
    "<S> have led to surprising behaviour in the case of proton - lead collisions . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , we discuss the possibility to calibrate the experimental determination of centrality by asymmetries caused by mutually different spatial distributions of protons and neutrons inside the nuclei  a well - known phenomenon in nuclear physics known as the neutron - skin effect . </S>"
