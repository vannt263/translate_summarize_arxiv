    "the diffusion of adatoms and molecules on surfaces is recently attracting much attention , in order to understand many properties of technological interest , such as thin film growth , catalysis and dissociation  @xcite .",
    "useful experimental techniques for probing the surface diffusion of molecular adsorbates have been developed .",
    "these allow to follow the dynamical details of surface diffusion , using scanning tunneling microscopy  @xcite , and to image physisorbed atoms and clusters , using field ion microscopy  @xcite .",
    "most theoretical works have focussed on the determination of energy barriers for diffusion in different systems  @xcite , usually on the basis of energy arguments and neglecting the role of internal degrees of freedom .",
    "however , it is often suggested that diffusion dynamics can be strongly affected by the presence of intramolecular motion  @xcite .",
    "here we address this problem for the simple but important case of a dimer physisorbed on a periodic substrate , trying to link the macroscopic diffusive behaviour to microscopic degrees of freedom .",
    "our theoretical model contains the salient features of a diatomic molecule physisorbed on a periodic substrate .",
    "however , our work does not aim to probe diffusion in a specific molecule - surface system , but to understand diffusion mechanisms expected for systems of this kind .    in sec .",

    "we consider a monomer ( adatom ) and a dimer ( diatomic molecule ) moving on a periodic one - dimensional substrate at finite temperature .",
    "the particle - substrate interaction is modelled by a periodic function @xmath3 .",
    "specifically , for the monomer @xmath4 and for the dimer @xmath5 where @xmath6 represents the spatial coordinate and @xmath7 , @xmath8 being the lattice constant of the substrate .    for the dimer",
    "the interparticle interaction is taken to be harmonic : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the spring equilibrium length . in order to take into account the finite temperature @xmath0 of the substrate",
    ", we adopt the langevin approach . in this framework the motion of the sliding object is described exactly , while the substrate is treated as a thermal bath .",
    "the equations of motion of the monomer and the dimer are respectively @xmath11 and @xmath12 where an explicit damping term @xmath13 modelling energy dissipation has been introduced ( @xmath14 is the phenomenological friction coefficient ) , and the effect of finite temperature @xmath0 is taken into account by the stochastically fluctuating forces @xmath15 .",
    "these two terms are related by the dissipation - fluctuation theorem : @xmath16 it is convenient to rewrite the equation of motion in adimensional units by introducing a characteristic time @xmath17 and defining @xmath18 @xmath19 for typical values @xmath20 , @xmath21k , @xmath22 , we have @xmath23 . in this way eqs .",

    ", we can rely on the results of kramers transition state theory ( tst )  @xcite , yielding analytical results for certain regimes of friction and for relatively high values of the diffusion barrier @xmath32 .",
    "we present in fig .",
    "[ vfmon.eps ] the results obtained with our simulation for @xmath33 and @xmath34 , which we will use as reference in discussing the behaviour of the dimer . fig .",

    "increasing @xmath31 adiabatically the velocity remains zero until a critical force @xmath35 is reached , since the system has to overcome a finite static friction force in order to get out of the potential well . then the particle slides with constant velocity @xmath36 on the substrate , resulting in a linear relation between @xmath36 and @xmath31 for high values of the driving force : @xmath37    if we decrease the force adiabatically a hysteresis effect is observed , since the mobility is different from zero also when @xmath38 and vanishes at @xmath39 .",
    "this corresponds to a bistability between the locked and the running solution , which is present when the friction coefficient @xmath14 is not very large , @xmath40  @xcite . in the case",
    "@xmath2 this bistability disappears , at least for intermediate - large values of @xmath14 .",
    "the system has always the chance to get untrapped because of thermal fluctuations . as a consequence",

    "the behaviour of the mobility for large @xmath31 , where the particle performs a drift motion with a small contribution of the noise term can be shown to be  @xcite @xmath46 in particular , if @xmath31 is very large compared to @xmath45 the term in parenthesis tends to one and the characteristic curve becomes linear : @xmath47 now we consider the driven dimer described by eq .",
    "( [ e.dimadim ] ) . in this case",
    ", the presence of the interparticle interaction renders the problem more complex , giving rise to a richer dynamical behaviour .",
    "we have analyzed the characteristic curves for different values of the intramolecular spacing @xmath10 , namely @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the golden mean , both for @xmath1 and @xmath2 ( see fig .",
    "[ vfdim.eps ] ) , and compared them to the monomer characteristics ( see fig .  [ vfmon-dim.eps ] ) .",
    "note that we have chosen @xmath50 because it is a prototypical example of an incommensurate length ratio .",
    "for the dimer it is convenient to rewrite the equation of motion using the centre of mass ( cm ) and relative coordinates , defined by @xmath52 from eq .",
    "( [ e.dimadim ] ) we obtain @xmath53 in our md simulations we choose the initial configuration which minimizes the total potential energy . as for the monomer a critical force @xmath54 , which depends on the value of @xmath10 , is needed to achieve motion for @xmath1",
    ". then for larger values of @xmath31 the velocity increases as a function of the external force , but at a certain value of the force @xmath55 another plateau appears in the @xmath56 plane ( @xmath57 being the cm mean velocity ) , signalling a dynamical crossover in the system . finally , keeping on increasing the force ,",
    "the linear regime is recovered ( fig .",
    "[ vfdim.eps](a ) ) . in the cm frame ,",
    "the external potential leads , for a drift motion @xmath58 , to a time - periodic force acting on the particles , with `` washboard '' frequency given by @xmath57 .",
    "the force @xmath55 , where the second plateau appears , physically corresponds to the point where the washboard frequency is in resonance with the stretching frequency of the dimer @xmath59 , exciting the internal degrees of freedom .",
    "this resonance mechanism was also found in the frenkel - kontorova model in the low friction limit  @xcite .",
    "for the dimer two regions of bistability can be observed , corresponding to the two plateaus in the characteristic curve ; thus , when @xmath31 is decreased a first hysteresis occurs in proximity of @xmath60 , giving a critical value @xmath61 , where the characteristic curve has a discontinuous derivative , while a second hysteresis is found when @xmath31 is decreased further from @xmath54 and another critical value @xmath62 , where @xmath63 , is obtained as for the monomer ( these hysteresis curves are shown only for the @xmath50 dimer in fig .",
    "[ vfdim.eps ] ) . for",
    "a closer comparison between the monomer and the dimer at @xmath1 see fig .",
    "[ vfmon-dim.eps](a ) .",
    "we note that the qualitative behaviour is the same for different @xmath10 but the values of @xmath64 and @xmath65 can differ significantly as a function of @xmath10 .",
    "this is due to energetic reasons : the dimer with @xmath49 is energetically favourite since , on average , it has to overcome a lower barrier , while for @xmath48 the two particles tend to be pinned in the minima and to behave like a monomer ( in fact the characteristic curve of the @xmath48 dimer is practically superimposed on that of the monomer ) .",
    "the resonance frequency is highlighted in fig .",
    "[ vfdim.eps](b ) by plotting @xmath66 as a function of @xmath57 : a clear peak of the characteristic curves at @xmath60 is visible when @xmath67 .    in order to understand better the resonance mechanisms we consider the case @xmath48 at @xmath1 . assuming a cm drift motion , @xmath68 , and linearizing the equation of motion  ( [ e.xcmyr ] ) for @xmath48 we obtain the following equation for @xmath69 : @xmath70 this is the equation of a parametric oscillator , for which an exponential increase of the amplitude is expected for @xmath71 within a given instability window , which we estimate to be @xmath72 .",
    "we note that indeed the amplitude of @xmath69 increases exponentially in a certain range of @xmath31 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ yrdetl1.eps ] , but it saturates at long times .",
    "this is due to the fact that eq .",
    "( [ e.parametric ] ) assumes a constant cm velocity . actually , in the full system eq .",
    "( [ e.xcmyr ] ) @xmath73 is coupled to @xmath69 , so that @xmath57 decreases slightly during the dynamics as shown in fig .",
    "[ yrdetl1.eps](d ) .",
    "this is enough to shift @xmath57 out of the instability window , thus stopping the increase of @xmath69 .",
    "this shows how intramolecular vibrations can be resonantly excited due to the sliding on a periodic substrate and that the details of the resulting relative motion are non trivial .",
    "for instance , whether this could represent a mechanism for dissociation depends on the maximum excursion from the equilibrium distance .",
    "moreover , the very nature of parametric resonances makes the temporal behaviour very much dependent on the initial values of the interatomic spacing which is in turn related to vibrational energy and temperature .",
    "the behaviour outlined for @xmath1 smears out at finite temperatures . although a hysteretic behaviour has been found for long periodic chains in the low friction limit  @xcite , no bistabilities and hysteresis are present in our case , as shown in fig .",
    "[ vfdim.eps](c ) .",
    "the static friction force vanishes and the mobility is sensitive to the value of @xmath10 .",
    "in particular the dimer with @xmath48 has the lowest mobility .",
    "note that the curves for different @xmath10 still cross at @xmath60 .",
    "this crossover of the mobility can be observed also comparing the monomer and the dimer ( fig .",
    "[ vfmon-dim.eps](b ) ) . moreover , as it can be seen from fig .",
    "[ vfdim.eps](d ) , plotting @xmath66 vs. @xmath57 , the resonance peak at @xmath60 still survives for @xmath67 . for @xmath48 the peak",
    "is shifted to a smaller value of @xmath57 .",
    "this is due to the fact that in the commensurate case , even though the static friction force found at @xmath1 vanishes , a larger force is needed to reach the sliding state and this corresponds to the point of highest curvature in the characteristic plotted in fig .",
    "[ vfdim.eps](c ) . to a certain extent",
    "this resembles the monomer case , where a very similar behaviour is found .",
    "next we examine the pure thermal diffusion , i.e. we study the motion of the monomer and the dimer with @xmath30 .",
    "this problem is computationally more time consuming , since the motion is completely random and an averaging over many md realizations is needed .",
    "we extract information about the diffusive behaviour of the particles by computing the mean square displacement ( msd ) @xmath74 , where @xmath75 denotes the average over the realizations .",
    "the diffusion coefficient @xmath76 is defined by @xmath77 usually it is assumed that the dependence of @xmath76 on temperature should follow the arrhenius law : @xmath78 where @xmath79 is a prefactor and @xmath80 is the activation energy for diffusion , scaled to @xmath81 . in eq .",
    "( [ e.diffusion ] ) both @xmath79 and @xmath80 are assumed to be @xmath0 independent .",
    "however , some recent studies have already shown that there may be deviations from the arrhenius behaviour  @xcite .",
    "[ diffus.eps ] shows the diffusion coefficient @xmath76 as a function of the single - particle energy barrier @xmath82 ( scaled to @xmath81 ) for the monomer and the dimer for different values of @xmath10 and two values of @xmath83 .",
    "we note that while the monomer has a uniquely defined activation energy @xmath84 , a clear deviation from the arrhenius law is observed in the dimer case , except for the case @xmath48 , where it is less evident ( as explained in sec .",
    "[ sec : driven ] the commensurate dimer dynamics is similar to that of the monomer ) .",
    "the @xmath49 dimer diffuses faster than the monomer ( at least for @xmath85 ) due to the most favourable energy configuration ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "note that the crossover point in the diffusion behaviour can depend on the force constant @xmath83 , as it can be seen by comparing the two curves for @xmath50 with @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "the dependence of the activation energy on temperature ( or equivalently on the energy barrier ) can be attributed to a temperature dependent intramolecular length , which affects the diffusion behaviour especially in the high temperature regime ( low @xmath88 ) .",
    "a similar mechanism was also proposed in a model of heteroepitaxial island diffusion  @xcite .",
    "since we are considering small values of @xmath88 ( rigorously eq .",
    "( [ e.diffusion ] ) should be valid for @xmath89 ) , finite - barrier effects are also important , as illustrated in ref .  @xcite .",
    "we are currently trying to unravel the latter from the effects due to vibrations .",
    "our results suggest that the role of intramolecular vibrations is relevant for the diffusion dynamics .",
    "the possibility to excite internal degrees of freedom , even for a simple diatomic molecule , can affect the temperature dependence of the activation energy  @xcite and determine a complex diffusion behaviour which can depend on the lattice commensurability and on the interatomic spacing .",
    "we plan to address this issue more extensively in a future work .",
    "we have presented a simplified model to study the driven and undriven motion of monomers and dimers on a periodic substrate .",
    "we have pointed out the peculiar effects of the substrate on the cm and relative motion of the dimer , such as nonlinear mobility , bistabilities and resonance processes . in this respect ,",
    "the coupling between the internal degrees of freedom is crucial . in particular ,",
    "the diffusion dynamics reveals strikingly complex features determined both by energetic mechanisms and by the role of intramolecular motion",
    ". it would be worthwhile to explore further this issue going from the simple @xmath90 model to a more realistic approach , considering for example the motion and the orientation of large molecules on a @xmath91 surface and the diffusion of long chains .",
