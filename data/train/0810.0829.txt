    "the serpens molecular cloud has received considerable attention over the past decade . because it is an actively star - forming complex containing a substantial mass of molecular gas and young stars within both clustered and diffuse environments ,",
    "it has become one of our main laboratories for testing theories of low - mass star formation ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the serpens cloud is one of the five clouds selected as part of the spitzer legacy program `` from molecular cores to planet - forming disks '' ( c2d ; @xcite ) , providing images in the 3  70 @xmath8 m range . the wide wavelength coverage and high sensitivity in the infrared ( ir ) of spitzer make it possible to easily identify a new , complete , flux limited ( down to luminosities below 0.01 @xmath9 ) young stellar population .",
    "this population has been found to be distributed over almost the entire area surveyed , offering an opportunity to determine the stellar content in different regions of the cloud , the distributions of the youngest stars and substellar objects , and the properties of their circumstellar envelopes and disks .",
    "the c2d program has mapped a 0.89 deg@xmath10 portion out of the more than 10 deg@xmath10 area @xcite of the serpens molecular cloud . assuming a distance of 259 @xmath11 37 pc @xcite , this corresponds to a covered area of about 2.5 @xmath12 9 pc .",
    "this region was discovered to be very rich in young stars ( @xcite ) , some of them previously identified with iso data ( @xcite ) .",
    "this poorly known cluster of young stars , cluster b , and the previously unknown star - forming region around it , is located about half a degree southwest of the well - known serpens cloud core , containing cluster a @xcite .",
    "it has a high density of young stars , making it an unique target region for obtaining a full and consistent picture of clustered low - mass star formation and compare this with young stars in the surrounding field .",
    "we are currently carrying out a multi - wavelength survey of this region , from x - ray to millimeter wavelengths , in order to create a `` template '' sample for the study of the evolution of circumstellar disks around stars younger than @xmath13 myr , within a single , small and well defined region .",
    "this work provides the necessary information for anchoring the study of protoplanetary disks to their parent population by means of the optical spectroscopic classification of the central stars .",
    "precise stellar properties are needed to perform an accurate study of the evolutionary stages of the young stellar objects and their disks .",
    "most spectroscopic studies of protoplanetary disk evolution refer to samples of young stars scattered across the sky or to sources in large star - forming clouds like taurus , making it difficult to separate intrinsic evolutionary effects from those caused by external influences such as environment or star formation history .",
    "in this paper we report on our optical spectroscopic survey designed to confirm the youth and determine spectral types of the newly discovered young stellar object ( yso ) candidates in the serpens region with spitzer .",
    "these spectra will also be used to estimate mass accretion rates using the strength of the h@xmath1 emission line ( @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ) , and the extinction toward each object .",
    "the paper is constructed as follows :   [ ssample ] describes the selection criteria for our sample , and in   [ sobs ] we describe the observations and data reduction . in   [ sspectype ]",
    "we discuss our spectral classification methods , along with its results for this sample and derive effective temperatures . in",
    "  [ sextin ] , we present our extinction studies based on the spitzer photometry and on our optical spectra . in ",
    "[ shrd ] we derive luminosities for the objects .",
    "this allows us to place each object in an hertzsprung - russell ( hr ) diagram , and derive its age and mass from comparison with evolutionary models .",
    "the h@xmath1 line and accretion rates are discussed in   [ sacret ] . finally , in   [ scon ] we present our conclusions .",
    "from the c2d catalog , @xcite plotted spectral energy distributions ( assuming a k7 spectral type for all the sources ) and identified 235 yso candidates  objects with ir excess , interpreted as due to disks or envelopes .",
    "these authors discuss the problem that background galaxies and bright background post - agb stars may show the same color distribution as that of young stellar objects .",
    "particularly , the post - agb stars could contaminate the bright end of the luminosity distribution .    to this original sample of 235 objects , a flux threshold of 3mjy at 8@xmath8",
    "m was applied , resulting in 150 sources bright enough to be observed in follow - up observations with the infrared spectrograph ( irs ) , onboard spitzer .",
    "the irs observations , carried out to study the evolution of dust in protoplanetary disks of a complete , flux limited sample will be presented in a future paper @xcite . here",
    ", we present optical spectroscopy of 78 stars bright enough to obtain optical spectroscopy with a 4m - class telescope .",
    "the remaining objects are too extincted in the optical to be detected , and are being classified in an ongoing near - ir spectroscopic survey .",
    "the resulting sample contains objects which span a range in evolutionary stages from embedded class i ( i.e. , spectral slope @xmath14 0.3 ) sources to young stars with protoplanetary disks ( class ii sources , -1.6 @xmath15 0.3 ) and stars with photospheric fluxes in the irac bands and excess in the mips bands ( also called `` cold disks '' , e.g. @xcite ) .",

    "after bias subtraction and flat - fielding , the spectra were extracted and wavelength calibrated with the arc ne comparison lamp data , to a precision of @xmath170.5  .",
    "the quality of the optical spectra is limited by the accuracy of the sky subtraction , especially for faint stars . as opposed to long - slit spectroscopy , where an adequate sky removal can be performed using the sky background on opposite sides very close to the object spectrum , a precise sky subtraction in multi - object fibre spectroscopy is complicated by the lack of a sky spectrum close to the object spectrum both in position and in time ( e.g. ,",
    "see @xcite ) .",
    "in general , the sky background depends mainly on the local sky conditions at the observatory during the time of observations .",
    "however , in the case of a molecular cloud , the `` sky '' may also have a significant contribution from extended continuum and line emission from the cloud itself .",
    "we used the fibres placed on `` empty '' positions in the field to measure the contribution from the sky .",
    "the sky spectra were reduced and extracted in an identical manner to the science data .",
    "the sky spectra were visually inspected and a few of bad quality were discarded .",
    "none of them showed diffuse h@xmath1 in emission from the cloud . to reach optimum results , even for the faintest sources , a single master sky spectrum , built with an average of 12  15 sky spectra ,",
    "was computed for each configuration . during the sky subtraction of each star",
    ", we applied small scalings to the master sky spectrum to take into account the fact that the throughput of different fibres shows slight variations .",
    "the scalings were typically in the range 0.951.05 , and chosen to optimize the sky subtraction .",
    "in several cases , the sky subtraction proved imperfect with residuals being most notable at @xmath217700 .",
    "these residuals are very common in low to intermediate @xmath0 fibre spectra due to the strong oh sky lines beyond 6700  .",
    "it is very difficult to remove these oh features because the sky lines are usually not well resolved , and also due to the non - linear variations in throughput and dispersion for different fibres .",

    "the low resolution of these instruments , combined with low s / n for most faint objects , did not allow us to detect or put meaningful upper limits on the li i ( 6707  ) line .",

    "the objects were classified following the spectral classification scheme of @xcite optimized to classify early type stars ( up to early g ) . for stars with spectral type later than g , the scheme was extended by incorporating spectral indices for the ranges g0-k5 and k5-m6 ( @xcite , @xcitehernandj / sptclass / sptclass.html ] ) .",

    "one one hand , for young stars embedded in their parent envelopes , an extra extinction compared to the local average in the cloud is naturally expected .",
    "such embedded sources , however , are also expected to show a strong infrared excess . on the other hand , stars at distances much larger than that of the cloud are also likely to have an enhanced extinction . we argue that this is the dominant category of sources in the shaded area of figure [ extinction ] , though confirmation through another method is needed .    indeed , none of the objects in the shaded area was found to have a strong infrared excess , as evidenced by the low spitzer - derived slope ( @xmath32 ) values , shown in table [ t_id ] .",

    "given the spectral type , therefore effective temperature ( derived in   [ steff ] ) , and luminosity of a source , individual age and mass can be estimated by comparing its position in the hertzsprung - russell ( hr ) diagram with evolutionary tracks .",

    "the main uncertainty is caused by the uncertainty in extinction : higher ( lower ) extinction values by 2 mag can shift the @xcite median age by a factor of two to younger ( older ) ages .",
    "it is also important to stress that this is not a complete imf study  we observe a bias towards a larger mean age due to the bias in the selection of the sources ( i.e. lack of very young , deeply embedded , class 0 objects ) .",
    "nevertheless , given that some of the stellar ages are clearly larger than the theoretical median age of a molecular cloud @xcite , we can not rule out from the current age distribution that several star - forming events have taken place in the observed serpens cloud .",

    "stars with values of ew[h@xmath1 ] below these levels are not necessarily wttss , for which confirmation depends upon the li abundance or other youth indicators , such as variability .",
    "we have determined the equivalent width of h@xmath1 with the usual fitting of gaussian profiles to the lines and the results are given in table [ t_alpha ] .",
    "the h@xmath1 feature lies near the 6567   tio band head , a strong feature in mid- and late - m stars . in low resolution spectra ,",
    "the edge of this band becomes blended with the h@xmath1 emission feature , leading to an underestimate of the continuum on the redward side and thus an overestimate of the ew[h@xmath1 ] .",
    "also , self - absorption is missed in these unresolved data .",
    "for these reasons , our ew[h@xmath1 ] values are likely somewhat overestimated .",
    "nonetheless , we identify 35 stars with large ew[h@xmath1 ] to be classified as cttss .",
    "the remaining four stars present marginal detections .      due to the uncertainties in the determination of ew[h@xmath1 ] in low resolution spectra , @xcite proposed the full width of h@xmath1 at 10% of the peak intensity ( h@xmath1[10% ] ) as an alternative to distinguish cttss from wttss .",
    "they found that stars with h@xmath1[10% ] greater than 270 km s@xmath7 are cttss , independent of spectral types .",
    "we fitted gaussian profiles to the h@xmath1 lines ( shown in figure [ ha_ac ] ) in order to determine the h@xmath1[10% ] .",
    "the errors were calculated by propagating the error on the spectral resolution and the error of the gaussian fit to the h@xmath1 line .",
    "the measured fwhm of each profile was deconvolved assuming a gaussian instrumental profile .",
    "because of the low resolution of our spectra ( 183.6 km s@xmath7 for _ wyffos _ , 126 km s@xmath7 for _ dolores _ , and 100 km s@xmath7 for _ cafos _ ) , very narrow profiles ( e.g. objects 106 and 150 ) are unresolved .    in spite of the low resolution ,",
    "the h@xmath1 profiles found are broad enough in most cases to allow the extraction of velocity information , although with low accuracy .",
    "these results are shown in table [ t_alpha ] . according to this criterion , 33 objects",
    "are cttss , while the remaining four stars are consistent with being cttss , given their uncertainties , showing a good agreement between both methods described .",

    "they found an empirical relationship between the mass accretion rate , @xmath39 ( from h@xmath1 profile model fittings or veiling measurements ) and h@xmath1[10% ] from high resolution spectra ( figure 3 in their paper ) :    @xmath40\\ ] ]    where h@xmath1[10% ] is in km s@xmath7 and @xmath39 is in m@xmath36yr@xmath7 .",

    "near - ir spectroscopy will be used to classify the remaining objects in the sample @xcite .",
    "* comparison of extinction values determined from our optical spectra with those calculated from the contribution of the cloud at each point ( averaged over a 5@xmath29 radius ) is a powerful method for identifying candidate background sources with infrared excess from spitzer selected samples of yso candidates .",
    "the effectiveness of this method has been confirmed for two objects by follow - up irs spectra . *",
    "effective temperatures and luminosities were derived and the objects were placed in a h - r diagram , compared with theoretical isochrones and mass tracks from models of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "20 objects are too luminous to be at the distance of serpens .",
    "these objects have a nearly one - to - one correspondence with those identified by the extinction method and are therefore very likely background objects .",
    "they amount to 25% of the detected sample , a relatively large amount likely due to the position of the serpens molecular cloud at very low galactic latitude .",
    "two of these background sources were confirmed to be post - agb stars through irs spectra . * the theoretical models by @xcite and @xcite",
    "imply a population of ysos concentrated in the age range between 1 and 15 myr , strongly peaked at 2  6 myr .",

    "the optical spectra cover the h@xmath1 line , an important indicator of accretion .",
    "we explored this relationship through two different approaches : qualitatively , the accreting nature of low - mass objects has been determined by either the equivalent width of h@xmath1 , or its full width at 10% of h@xmath1 peak intensity .",
    "this confirms 37 objects ( or 55% of the yso sample ) to be actively accreting objects classified as new classical t tauri stars in serpens .",

    "<S> we report on the results of an optical spectroscopic survey designed to confirm the youth and determine the spectral types among a sample of young stellar object ( yso ) candidates in the serpens molecular cloud . </S>",
    "<S> we observed 150 infrared excess objects , previously discovered by the spitzer legacy program `` from molecular cores to planet - forming disks '' ( c2d ) , bright enough for subsequent spitzer / irs spectroscopy . </S>",
    "<S> we obtained 78 optical spectra of sufficient @xmath0 for analysis . </S>",
    "<S> extinctions , effective temperatures and luminosities are estimated for this sample , and used to construct h - r diagrams for the population . </S>",
    "<S> we identified 20 background giants contaminating the sample , based on their relatively high extinction , position in the h - r diagram , the lack of h@xmath1 emission and relatively low infrared excess . </S>",
    "<S> such strong background contamination ( 25% ) is consistent with the location of serpens being close to the galactic plane ( @xmath2 galactic latitude ) . </S>",
    "<S> the remaining 58 stars ( 75% ) were all confirmed to be young , mostly k and m - type stars that are presumed to belong to the cloud . </S>",
    "<S> individual ages and masses for the ysos are inferred based on theoretical evolutionary models . </S>",
    "<S> the models indicate a spread in stellar ages from 1 to 15 myr , peaking at 2  6 myr , and a mass distribution of 0.2 to 1.2 @xmath3 with median value around 0.8 @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> strong h@xmath1 emission lines ( ew[h@xmath1 ] @xmath5 3  ) have been detected in more than half of the sample ( 35 stars ) . </S>",
    "<S> the mass accretion rates as derived from the h@xmath1 line widths span a broad distribution over 4 orders of magnitude with median accretion rate of @xmath6 @xmath3 yr@xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis shows that the majority of the infrared excess objects detected in serpens are actively accreting , young t - tauri stars . </S>"
