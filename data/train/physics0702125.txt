    "it is known that turbulence enhances mixing ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . however , numerical simulations , laboratory experiments and observations in the atmospheric turbulence revealed formation of long - living inhomogeneities in spatial distribution of aerosols and droplets in turbulent fluid flows ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the origin of these inhomogeneities is not always clear but their influence on the mixing can be hardly overestimated .",
    "it is hypothesized that the atmospheric turbulence enhances the rate of droplet collisions ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in particular , the turbulence causes formation of small - scale droplet inhomogeneities , and it also increases the relative droplet velocity .",
    "in addition , the turbulence affects the hydrodynamic droplet interaction .",
    "the latter increases the rate of droplet collisions .",
    "these effects are of a great importance for understanding of rain formation in atmospheric clouds . in particular",
    ", these effects can cause the droplet spectrum broadening and acceleration of raindrop formation @xcite",
    ". note that clouds are known as zones of enhanced turbulence .",
    "the preferential concentration of inertial particles ( particle clustering ) was recently studied in numerical simulations in @xcite .",
    "the formation of network - like regions of high particle number density was found in @xcite in high resolution direct numerical simulations of inertial particles in a two - dimensional turbulence .",
    "the goal of this study is to analyze the particle - fluid interaction leading to the formation of strong inhomogeneities of aerosol distribution due to a _ particle clustering instability_. the particle clustering instability is a consequence of a spontaneous breakdown of their homogeneous space distribution . as a result , at the nonlinear stage of the clustering instability ,",
    "the local density of aerosols may rise by orders of magnitude and strongly increase the probability of particle - particle collisions .",
    "it was suggested in @xcite that the main cause of the particle clustering instability is their inertia : the particles inside the turbulent eddies are carried out to the boundary regions between the eddies by the inertial forces .",
    "this mechanism of the preferential concentration acts in all scales of turbulence , increasing toward small scales .",
    "later , this was contested in @xcite using the so - called `` kraichnan model '' @xcite of turbulent advection by the delta - correlated in time random velocity field , whereby the clustering instability did not occur .    however , it was shown in @xcite that accounting for a finite correlation time of the fluid velocity field results in the clustering instability of inertial particles .",
    "note that the particle inertia results in the compressibility of particle velocity field .",
    "the effects of compressibility of the velocity field on formation of small - scale inhomogeneities in spatial distribution of particles were first discussed in @xcite . in this study a theoretical approach proposed in @xcite is further developed and applied to investigate the mechanisms of formation of small - scale aerosol inhomogeneities in the atmospheric turbulent flow .",
    "in particular , we extended the theory of particle clustering instability to the case when the particle stokes time is larger than the kolmogorov time scale , but is much smaller than the correlation time at the integral scale of turbulence .",
    "remarkably , the particle inertia also results in formation of the large - scale inhomogeneities in the vicinity of the temperature inversion layers due to excitation of the large - scale instability ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this effect is caused by additional non - diffusive turbulent flux of particles in the vicinity of the temperature inversion ( phenomenon of turbulent thermal diffusion ) .",
    "the characteristic time of excitation of the large - scale instability of concentration distribution of aerosols varies in the range from 0.3 to 3 hours depending on the particle size and parameters of the atmospheric turbulent boundary layer and the temperature inversion layer .",
