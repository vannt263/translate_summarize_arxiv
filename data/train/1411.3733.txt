    "the discovery of the topological insulators ( tis),@xcite which are insulating ( theoretically ) in the bulk but have metallic surface states present due to their topologically nontrivial electronic structure , have attracted great scientific interest .",
    "these materials can be categorized by the symmetry by which their surface states are protected .",
    "for example , the `` topological crystalline insulators '' ( tcis)@xcite have surface states protected by certain crystal point group symmetries rather than by time - reversal symmetry invariance ( tri - tis),@xcite as observed in other compounds .    the studies of tri - tis and tcis have stimulated the search for an even more exotic state of matter , the topological superconductor ( ts ) , whose surface states are predicted to be majorana fermions.@xcite one candidate is cu@xmath3bi@xmath4se@xmath5 , a superconductor arising from cu - doping of the tri - ti bi@xmath4se@xmath5.@xcite the most important evidence for ( or against ) the existence of ts in particular compounds has come from the presence ( or absence ) of a zero - bias conductance peak ( zbcp ) in point - contact spectra .",
    "such a peak may be indicative of unconventional superconductivity , and calculations have shown that every possible unconventional pairing symmetry for cu@xmath3bi@xmath4se@xmath5 should be topologically nontrivial @xcite .",
    "some groups have reported such a peak in cu@xmath3bi@xmath4se@xmath5@xcite , though other groups have raised doubts on these measurements @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the diamagnetic shielding fraction in cu@xmath3bi@xmath4se@xmath5 varies significantly and is usually very low@xcite , limiting possible studies .",
    "another system of interest is based on snte .",
    "pure snte has been proposed@xcite and demonstrated@xcite to be a topological crystalline insulator ; furthermore , it has a ferroelectric phase at low temperature@xcite and intriguing thermoelectric properties at high temperature.@xcite more relevant to the present study is that sn@xmath6te is superconducting at temperature well below 1  k.@xcite substitution of a small amount of in for sn drives the ferroelectric instability to zero , while increasing the superconducting @xmath7.@xcite more recent studies have shown that @xmath7 grows linearly with in concentration , reaching @xmath8  k for sn@xmath9in@xmath10te.@xcite    the superconductivity in sn@xmath6te was originally explained by electron - phonon coupling involving the scattering of carriers between equivalent conduction band - valleys.@xcite it has been noted more recently that the hybridization between valence and conduction bands that leads to band inversion and topological effects also leads to enhanced van hove singularities , and that this increased density of states might be helpful to superconductivity.@xcite when @xmath7 was raised by substitution of in , erickson _ et al._@xcite considered the possibility of pairing enhancement via negative @xmath11 centers associated with in .",
    "et al._@xcite observed a zero - bias conduction peak in a point - contact measurement on sn@xmath12in@xmath13te with @xmath14 , arguing that this is evidence for an odd - parity superconducting state .",
    "in contrast , saghir _",
    "et al._@xcite have measured the temperature dependence of the magnetic penetration depth by muon spin rotation spectroscopy and find that it is consistent with an @xmath15-wave gap .",
    "they also find evidence for strong coupling , which may be necessary given the large magnitude of the normal - state resistivity found in in - doped snte crystals.@xcite clearly , resolving the character of the superconducting state in this system is of considerable current interest .    in this paper , we report low - energy neutron scattering measurements on a superconducting single - crystal of sn@xmath1in@xmath2te with @xmath16  k. finding no evidence for any structural instability at low temperature , we have characterized longitudinal and transverse acoustic phonon dispersions in this sample below and above @xmath7 .",
    "the phonon dispersion relations in the superconducting sample are consistent with these results in the parent compound snte.@xcite for a superconductor in which pairing is due to electron - phonon coupling , one expects to see characteristic changes in the phonon self energy for phonon energies comparable to @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the energy of the superconducting gap.@xcite we find instead a surprisingly large energy width for phonon energy @xmath19 , with no significant change across @xmath7 .",
    "we discuss possible causes of this large self energy .",
    "the single - crystal sample used in this experiment was grown by a modified floating - zone method  @xcite at brookhaven national laboratory .",

    "we used horizontal beam collimations of guide-@xmath21-s-@xmath21-@xmath22 ( s = sample ) with a fixed final energy of 5 mev on spins together with a cooled be filter after the sample to reduce higher - order neutrons .",
    "we used a fixed final energy of 5.1 mev , with beo filters after the sample and a pg filter before the sample , and horizontal collimations of open - pg - open - s-@xmath23-beo - open on macs .",
    "the inelastic neutron scattering measurements have been performed in the @xmath24 scattering plane .",
    "the lattice constants for this sample are @xmath25   .",
    "the data are described in reciprocal lattice units ( r.l.u . ) of @xmath26 .",

    "the relatively low intensity of the ( 1,1,1 ) peak and the absence of bragg peaks at ( 1,1,0 ) or ( 0,0,1 ) are consistent with the rocksalt cubic structure .",
    "@xcite there is no evidence of any superlattice or diffuse scattering that might indicate a structural instability .",
    "hence , we focus our studies on the transverse ( ta ) and longitudinal ( la ) acoustic phonons around the strong ( 0,0,2 ) peak as shown in fig .",

    "the dispersion relations of both the ta and la modes are in good agreement with previously reported data as well as recent neutron scattering measurements on the parent compound snte,@xcite suggesting that a 20% in doping does not significantly modify the low - energy lattice dynamics in this material .    in the parent snte and a similar compound pbte ,",
    "a soft transverse optic ( to ) mode has been observed , that condenses into a column type intensity near zone - center at low temperatures .",

    "this mode , associated with the ferroelectric instability , is screened by free carriers@xcite , so that it is possible that the large in concentration in our sample has stiffened the to mode sufficiently that it is not present in our energy window .",

    "for the la phonon mode , we see one high point for @xmath37 , while the product remains almost constant for all other @xmath36 values .",
    "this high point at small @xmath36 could be a possible result of the anomalously broad soft to phonon mode near zone center  @xcite observed in pbte and snte at low temperatures .",
    "the measured phonon energies and momentum widths are shown in the lower panels of fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] .",

    "based on previous studies of the change in phonon self energy due to superconducting order,@xcite we expect to see the largest effects near the energy @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the superconducting gap . on cooling below @xmath7 ,",
    "one expects to see an increase in the line width for @xmath41 and a decrease for @xmath42 the recent work of saghir _",
    "et al._@xcite indicates strong coupling , with @xmath43 , which yields an estimate of @xmath44  mev for our crystal with @xmath16  k. this is roughly consistent with a point - contact measurement on a sample of sn@xmath12in@xmath13te with @xmath45 @xmath46  k which observed @xmath47  mev.@xcite the lowest phonon energy we can measure is limited by the instrumental resolution ( @xmath48 0.35 mev for spins , @xmath49 0.5 mev for macs at @xmath39=0 mev ) is around @xmath50  mev , close to the estimated value of @xmath17 .",
    "the effective energy resolution for the ta mode depends on how the anisotropic resolution function matches up with the dispersion ; this is the focusing effect , which is discussed in ref . .",
    "for most of the wave vectors covered , the velocity is relatively constant , and we calculate an effective energy width of @xmath51  mev , taking into account the sample mosaic .",
    "this is quite close to the measured widths for @xmath52 and 0.4 , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:4](c ) , so those measurements appear to be resolution limited .",
    "the effective resolution width at the zone boundary rises because of flattening of the dispersion .",

    "the phonon energy in this region is close to @xmath17 ; however , we see no significant change in the energy width between the superconducting and normal states .",
    "while the width changes due to superconducting order are expected to be small,@xcite the large , temperature - independent contribution certainly makes their detection more challenging .    what could be the cause of this large energy width at small @xmath36 ?",
    "one possibility is that is due to interactions with the soft to mode .",
    "another possibility is that these low-@xmath36 phonons are involved in scattering electrons within a small pocket at the fermi surface .",
    "according to allen and cohen,@xcite such interactions contribute little to electron pairing ; the main contribution comes from scattering between different pockets , which involves phonons at large @xmath36 .",
