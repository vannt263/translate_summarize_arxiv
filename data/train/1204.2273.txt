    "since usually a variable star is observed in two or three not necessarily consecutive pawprints , we first calculated a weighted average of the pawprints @xmath0 magnitudes to obtain the `` tile '' @xmath0 , which then represented one epoch of data . during this process",

    "see next section ) . the predominance of fo ( 8) with respect to f ( 4 ) pulsators , as well as the lack of cepheids with periods longer than 4 d in the sep field are both remarkable .",

    "the longest period classical cepheids analyzed in the present paper has a variability period of 23 day .",

    "a comparison between tables  [ tab1 ] and  [ comparison ] reveals that for the @xmath49 relation of the f - mode pulsators , there is general agreement within the errors between our results and @xcite ( only slope for the latter because the zero point is given in absolute magnitude ) .",
    "only marginal agreement is found instead with @xcite , whose results are based on the @xcite sample complemented at shorter periods by cepheids belonging to the lmc clusters ngc1866 and ngc2031 .",
    "this is likely due to the significantly larger sample , both at short and medium periods , presented in the present paper . as for the comparison with theory",

    "the errors in the coefficients of our @xmath49 relation are shorter than in previous studies .",
    "this is a result of the large range in period spanned by the cepheids in our sample , including for the first time a significant number of objects with nir photometry and periods shorter than 5 day , and the very good sampling of our multi - epoch @xmath0 light curves . in the case of the fo",
    "pulsators the agreement with @xcite is less satisfactory than for the f - mode cepheids .",
    "this may be due to the advantage of the deeper magnitude limit achieved by the vmc survey , which allowed us to reach the fainter fo cepheids populating the short - period tail of the @xmath49 relation , along with the much better sampling of our @xmath0 light curves .",
    "the @xcite relations rely in fact on 2mass and denis single epoch nir data , thus the cepheid s mean magnitude is , in principle , less well determined increasing , in turn , the r.m.s . of the @xmath49 relation .",
    "this is a natural consequence of studying cepheids in the nir using only single epoch data .",
    "+ since there are no empirical @xmath4 and @xmath5 relations in @xmath0 available in the literature we can only compare our relations with the theoretical results by @xcite .",
    "the slope of our @xmath50 relation is in agreement with the theoretical value , while a significant discrepancy is found in the case of the @xmath5 relation ( see table  [ comparison ] ) .",
    "this discrepancy could be due , at least in part , to uncertainties affecting the @xmath7-temperature transformations that might overestimate the coefficient of the predicted colour term and , in turn , the linear regression of the corrected magnitude versus period .",
    "this effect is expected to be mitigated in the wesenheit approach thanks to the adoption of the same colour coefficient ( in the empirical and theoretical relations ) set by cardelli s law . + finally",
    ", we note that no statistically significant evidence is found for the @xmath3 discontinuity around 10 day claimed by several authors .",
    "@xcite performed a statistical study of the lmc cepheid sample obtained from the macho database and found that the observed behaviour in the period - magnitude diagrams is best reproduced by two linear relations , with a break at 10 day .",
    "a similar deviation from linearity is predicted by nonlinear convective pulsation models ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which also suggest a quadratic form of the @xmath3 relations , particularly in the optical bands .",

    "* ) , as we confirm with the present study .",
