    "thus , class  0 sources are ideal objects to investigate the physical and chemical conditions during the earliest phases of the star - forming process , to test theoretical models of cloud core collapse ( e.g. , shu 1977 ; terebey , shu , & cassen 1984 ; fiedler & mouschovias 1992 ; boss 1993 ) , and to study the influence of the bipolar outflow on the structure and chemistry of the envelope .",

    "the smm 14 sources stand out as the brightest of these cores , and represent a second , more recent phase of star formation in the serpens cloud compared to the near - infrared sources .",
    "their spectral energy distributions are well fit by single blackbodies with temperatures of 2027 k , characteristic of class  0 ysos ( hurt & barsony 1996a ) .",
    "observations of @xmath16co , hco@xmath9 , and h@xmath10co lines indicate the presence of warm ( @xmath35190 k ) and dense ( @xmath36 @xmath27 ) gas associated with bipolar outflows , as evidenced by broad line wings ( white , casali , & eiroa 1995 ; hurt , barsony , & wootten 1996b ) .    near - infrared observations also reveal evidence for outflows .",

    ", all of which indicate a larger distance . one of these stars , r16 , has a derived distance of 628 pc , but is included by chiar because its image on the poss plate suggests it is an embedded object associated with the serpens cloud . excluding this star lowers the distance estimate to 390 pc . here",

    "lower limits to the stellar masses follow from the assumption that all luminosity is due to accretion at a rate of @xmath43 @xmath3  yr@xmath15 , while upper limits are the stellar masses which produce the same luminosity on the zero - age main sequence .",

    "the interferometer data were edited in the usual manner by flagging a small number of data points with clearly deviating amplitudes and phases .",
    "the quality of the continuum data at 3.42.7 mm allowed self - calibration of the visibility phases , which was subsequently applied to the line data , decreasing the noise level by a small amount .",

    "the interferometer dirty beam has strong n  s side lobes because of the @xmath50 declination of serpens . in many cases",
    "the position of the initial clean - components had to be constrained to a @xmath51 box around the source position to ensure proper deconvolution .",
    "an additional complication for cleaning of the molecular - line data toward smm  3 was the presence of strong emission from smm  4 approximately one primary beam ( @xmath52 ) to the south .",

    "part of this discrepancy may be explained by a steeper frequency dependency of the dust emissivity than the @xmath104 of the adopted model ( ossenkopf & henning 1994 ) .",
    "it may also indicate that warm material is distributed over larger scales than assumed in the model , in which it is confined to the inner few hundred au .",

    "this indicates that any circumstellar disk makes a much smaller relative contribution to the total flux of class  0 sources than for class  i objects , especially since a sizeable fraction of this point - source emission may also be attributable to the warm , inner 100 au of the envelope .",
    "no limits on disk masses can therefore be obtained for the serpens class  0 sources from the present data .",
    "significant , resolved emission around the taurus class  i sources was only detected toward l1551  irs  5 and l1527  irs .",
    "the visibility fluxes of the latter source , which is sometimes referred to as a class  0 source , closely resemble those of the serpens class  0 ysos , but its total envelope mass is only 0.03 @xmath3 , and the signal - to - noise is insufficient to fit an envelope model as in  4.2 .",
    "the envelopes around all taurus class  i sources , including l1527  irs , contain less than 50% of the estimated stellar mass , consistent with their higher age .",
    "because of their lower masses , these envelopes of class  i sources are much better traced by molecular lines than by continuum emission .",
    "hco@xmath9 10 ,",
    "32 , and 43 single - dish observations of the taurus class  i sources showed that their envelopes are well described by a power - law density structure , similar to that derived here for the serpens class  0 objects . from the integrated intensities observed by hogerheijde et  al .",
    "( 1997 ) , the power - law slope is constrained to lie between @xmath91 and @xmath166 .",
    "these values are consistent with predicted values of @xmath91 to @xmath92 for a collapsing cloud ( shu 1977 ) , and with the values for the class  0 sources found here . by including the complete observed line profile in the model",
    "fit , much more accurate constraints on age and envelope density structure can be obtained , which will allow tests of other collapse models ( cf .",
    "zhou 1992 , 1995 ; zhou et  al .",
    "1993 ; walker , narayanan , & boss 1994 ; choi et  al .",
    "1995 ; hogerheijde 1998 ; hogerheijde & van der tak 1998 ) .    the serpens ysos studied in this paper have formed within a projected distance of 25,000 au of each other .",
    "the detection of widespread emission from moderate @xmath167 lines of co with broad profiles ( white et  al .",
    "1995 ) indicates that material throughout the serpens cloud is influenced by the outflows .",
    "it is therefore remarkable that our data , which probe the 16,000 au diameter envelopes on 1000 au scales , are consistent with the density structure predicted for the formation of an isolated star ( shu 1977 ;  4.2 ) .",
    "this suggests that the influence of the outflows on the cloud structure is largely confined to lower density material , leaving the dense cores mostly unaffected .",
    "alternatively , their envelopes may reflect the original , relatively isolated state if all three ysos have formed within an interval shorter than the dynamic time scale of the outflows of @xmath168 yr as estimated from the @xmath16co 21 data of white et  al .",
    "( 1995 ) . however , the projected location of smm  3 at the edge of the outflow driven by smm  4 , and the small age suggested by the highly collimated nature of smm  3 s outflow as traced by hcn 10 , may indicate induced star formation .",
    "single - dish mapping of the entire cloud on @xmath14@xmath169 scales , which are well matched to the interferometer observations , are required to further investigate the influence of star formation on the cloud structure .",
    "such observations may also shed further light on the nature of the apparently starless core smm  2 and the @xmath141 low - mass cores identified recently by testi & sargent ( 1998 ) from an extensive interferometric survey of the serpens cloud core .",
    "the model results of  5.3 indicate that co is depleted by factors of 210 in the cold regions of the envelopes where @xmath152 k , its sublimation temperature , but not in the warmer inner regions of the envelope .",
    "such a level of depletion is small compared to the value of 1020 inferred for the bulk of the envelope of two other class  0 ysos , ngc 1333 iras 4a and b ( blake et  al.1995 ) .",
    "submillimeter observations of the latter sources indicate envelope masses of 9 and 4 @xmath3 in a @xmath31 beam , adopting a distance of 350 pc , comparable to or larger than those of the serpens sources . based on a detailed excitation analysis , blake et  al .",
    "conclude that the abundances of all molecules including co are depleted by a factor of 1020 when the dust emission is used as a reference to determine the total column density .",
    "blake et  al.used a value for the dust emissivity which was smaller by a factor of 2 than the value adopted by us .",
    "if the same value had been assumed , their derived depletion would be even larger , increasing the difference with the depletion we find toward the serpens sources .",
    "this highlights the difficulty in deriving and interpreting molecular depletion ( cf .",
    "mundy & mcmullin 1997 ) .",
    "the large difference in molecular depletion between class  0 ysos which are otherwise very similar suggests that the quiescent evolutionary phase characterized by heavily depleted abundances may be relatively short - lived .",
    "in addition , the local star - formation density may be important .",
    "the largest levels of co depletion are inferred for the relatively isolated ngc  1333 iras  4 object ; lower values are found toward smm  1 , which is located in the northwest of the serpens region , while the lowest values are inferred for smm  3 and 4 , at the very center of the densely star forming cloud .",
    "possibly the high density of star formation activity inhibits co depletion , suggesting that the chemistry may be more sensitive to the environment than the physical structure of the envelopes ( cf .",
    "previous section ) .",
    "the line profile shapes toward ngc  1333 iras 4a and b resemble those of the serpens sources .",
    "blake et  al .",
    "conclude that the hcn 43 profile , which is significantly broader than , e.g. , hco@xmath9 43 , indicates that hcn may be enhanced in the outflow .",
    "our hcn 43 spectra show this same trend . in the interferometer beam , h@xmath7cn 10 peaks toward the northern outflow lobe of smm  3 , supporting the interpretation of larger abundances in the outflow .",
    "enhanced abundances of volatile species like h@xmath10co and ch@xmath39oh toward ngc  1333 iras 4a and b are attributed by blake et  al .  to grain - grain collisions in the velocity - shear zones surrounding the outflow .",
    "these collisions heat the dust grains transiently and evaporate the ice mantles .",
    "thus , the dynamic interaction of the outflow with the surrounding envelope could explain the bright emission of some species outlining the walls of the outflow cavities of ysos .",
    "continuum and molecular - line emission from four protostellar candidates in the serpens molecular cloud ( smm  1 = firs  1 , smm  2 , smm  3 , and smm  4 ) has been used the provide the first comprehensive picture of the physical and chemical structure on 100010,000 au scales in a clustered region .",
    "we confirm the nature of smm  1 , 3 , and 4 as deeply embedded , class  0 ysos with more than 50% of their total mass still in a circumstellar envelope . the density in these envelopes is well described by a power - law with slope @xmath2 .",
    "this agrees with theoretical predictions for an isolated cloud core , even though the smm  1 , 3 , and 4 are in close proximity of each other , and outflowing gas permeates the whole serpens core .",
    "the characteristics of , at least , the early phases of star formation therefore do not seem to be very different between isolated and more clustered environments .",
    "large degrees of molecular depletion by freezing - out of molecules onto grains have been inferred for some class  0 ysos , but the low levels of depletion found toward the serpens sources suggests this phase may be short - lived and/or influenced by the surrounding star - forming activity .",
    "smm  2 is most likely a warm cloud condensation without a central object since it shows no compact continuum or molecular line emission .",
    "the main conclusions of this paper can be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "the interferometric observations of smm  1 , 3 , and 4 in 3.41.4 mm dust continuum emission are excellent tools to derive the structure of the envelopes surrounding these class  0 sources .",
    "they are characterized by intense , resolved ( @xmath0 au ) emission which can be described by a density distribution that follows a radial power law with index @xmath2 .",
    "such a density distribution agrees well with model predictions for the earliest phases of protostellar collapse ( e.g. , shu 1977 ) .",
    "the temperature distribution is based on self - consistent model results , and fits to the millimeter and far - infrared sed . at a representative radius of 1000 au , dust temperatures of 27",
    "k ( smm  1 ) , 24 k ( smm  3 ) , and 20 k ( smm  4 ) are found .",
    "the mass contained within the envelopes is constrained to 8.7 @xmath3 for smm  1 , 3.0 @xmath3 for smm  3 , and 5.3 @xmath3 for smm  4 . to fit the flux on long baselines , a point source with 20%30% of the total flux",
    "is required , corresponding to emission originating from radii @xmath170 au .",
    "observations at higher spatial resolution are required to investigate how much of this flux is due to a circumstellar disk and how much to the dense inner 100  au of the power - law envelope .",
    "such observations for other class  0 ysos suggests the envelope dominates the emission even on small scales .    2 .",
    "the aperture - synthesis molecular line observations reveal @xmath13@xmath14 ( 20004000 au ) diameter cores around smm  1 , 3 , and 4 in c@xmath8o , @xmath7co , h@xmath7co@xmath9 , and h@xmath7cn .",
    "the hco@xmath9 and hcn emission traces the walls of the outflow cavities , while sio and so emission originates from material shocked by the outflows .",
    "molecular species and transitions are thus identified which selectively probe different physical regions of the envelope , offering diagnostic tools for future studies of the protostellar environment .",
    "higher excitation single - dish lines show broad outflow wings and deep , narrow self - absorption features , in addition to gaussian line cores of 23 km  s@xmath15 fwhm .",
    "monte - carlo calculations of the molecular excitation and line transfer show that the envelope model derived from the dust emission can successfully reproduce the observed single - dish and interferometric line intensities , except for the @xmath34 of warm material traced in the @xmath16co , @xmath7co 65 , and some of the h@xmath10co lines .",
    "the co abundance appears to be decreased by a factor of 26 in the regions of the envelope where the gas temperature is 20 k or less ( @xmath171 au ) , owing perhaps to freezing - out onto grains .",
    "the derived molecular abundances in the warmer gas ( @xmath18 k ) are comparable to those found toward other class  0 ysos , but some species may be enhanced toward smm  1 . the model predicts interferometric line fluxes which are within a factor of a few of the observed values , indicating that there are no large abundance variations on 3004000 au scales .",
    "however , a more realistic treatment of the velocity field and possible deviations from spherical symmetry have to be included before firmer limits can be placed on the abundances .",
