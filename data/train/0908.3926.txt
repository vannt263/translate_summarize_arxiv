    "as a quantum system of interest interacts with its environment which is also considered being made up of a large number of the quantum particles , solving the dynamics of the total system is in fact an impossible task by now .",
    "however , in many cases we are only interested in the dynamics of the quantum system of interest , thus we can investigate the reduced system by using the phenomenological environment as proposed by caldeira and leggett @xcite .",
    "usually , in this method the environment is modelled by a bath of harmonic oscillators ( or other quantum particles ) and the influence of the bath on the quantum system is fully enclosed in the so - called spectral density function @xmath0 according to the characteristic of the environment one can choose the @xmath1 ohmic , sub - ohmic , super - ohmic forms and so on .",
    "thus , the reduced dynamics of the quantum systems can be investigated in detail .",
    "many such problems have been treated extensively and some significative results have been obtained in the field in past years @xcite .",
    "the spectral density functions @xmath1 obtained from the microcosmic dynamical model plus its phenomenological environment ( mdmppe ) is in good agreement with that obtained from quasi - classical equations of motion satisfied by the system of interest .",
    "we can obtain the effective spectral density function ( esdf ) following leggett as follows . setting @xmath2 taking cut - off frequency of the bath modes infinity , and supposing the spectral density function @xmath1 a continuous function",
    ", we can obtain the esdf with @xmath3im@xmath4 $ ] ( see ref.@xcite ) , where @xmath5 represents the effects of arbitrary linear dissipative and/or reactive elements .",
    "usually , @xmath5 can be obtained from the equation of motion of the system in fourier - transformed form , namely , @xmath6\\left(\\omega\\right),$ ] where @xmath7 is a conservative potential .",
    "this equation can be obtained from the scheme of mdmppe .",
    "the esdfs from infinite cut - off frequency of baths for many models are obtained @xcite .",
    "this method is in fact a universal one .",
    "when the temperature of the systems are low enough , we can imagine that the dynamics of the quantum systems of interest obtained from the mdmppe should have some difference with that from quasi - classical equations of motions . in this case , the high - frequency modes of the bath are in fact suppressed , so the cut - off frequency may be not very large and it may be comparable to the characteristic frequency of the quantum system of interest .",
    "so there are at least two differences between the dynamics of normal and low temperature for the quantum systems of interest .",
    "the first is that the esdfs obtained from the mdmppe at low temperature should not be in accordance with the spectral density functions from quasi - classical equations of motion , and the second is that the system at low temperature must go through a non - markovian process @xcite other than the markovian one .    with the progress of technique many quantum systems have been designed and manufactured . in particular , many qubit models for making quantum computers in future",
    "are proposed in recent years .",
    "most of these quantum systems should work in very low temperature @xcite .",
    "the non - markovian effects of baths in the systems have been considered recently @xcite .",
    "it is reported that in many chemical and biologic systems , the non - markovian effects may also be important @xcite . at very low temperature",
    ", the cut - off frequencies of the bath should be finite . taking a finite cut - off frequency of the bath rather than the infinite one , we shall obtain another kind of the spectral density function . in the following",
    "we denote the esdfs from infinite , and from finite cut - off frequencies of the bath for model @xmath8 by @xmath9 ( from infinite cut - off frequencies ) and @xmath10 ( from finite cut - off frequencies ) , where @xmath8 denotes the physical models .",
    "a somewhat similar discussion on the problem in completely classical framework has been given in refs @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we shall investigate the esdfs of four models by using the scheme of mdmppe at infinite and finite cut - off frequencies of baths . through the two sets of esdfs @xmath11 and @xmath12 we shall investigate the reduced dynamics of qubits in some practical physical models .",
    "they are a quantum system in a bath ( model a ) ; a quantum system coupled to an intermediate harmonic oscillator ( iho ) and only the latter coupled to a bath ( model b ) ; a quantum system coupled to an iho and both of them coupled to their independent baths ( model c ) and a common bath ( model d ) .",
    "in this section , we shall obtain two kinds of esdfs for the models a , b , c , and d when they are reduced to the original spin - boson form .",
    "one kind of them are obtained from taking finite cut - off frequencies of baths and the other is gotten by setting the cut - off frequencies of baths infinity . after obtaining the spectral density functions we shall solve the reduced dynamics for the quantum systems of interest when they are set as the qubits .",
    "the reduced dynamics governed by the two kinds of esdfs for the qubits will be compared .    in order to compare the dynamics of the qubit governed by the different effective spectral functions in each model , we choose a same starting point @xmath13 for all of the models . in another word",
    ", we always reduce them to the original spin - boson model with the same iho transformation and set @xmath14 in our derivations . because the model a is just the original spin - boson model ,",
    "our work for reducing this model is just reducing it to itself .",
    "so in the assumption of infinite cut - off frequency , the obtained esdf of the model should be equal to the @xmath15 , which will be shown in the following subsection a. models b , c , and d are different from the original spin - boson model , so when they are reduced to the original spin - boson form , the esdfs should be different from the starting function @xmath13 .",
    "we have calculated the dynamics of the quantum system of interest governed by @xmath16 and @xmath12 with the same values of @xmath17 in each models of the paper , and they are certainly different .",
    "however , even for the same model , the different esdfs @xmath16 and @xmath12 , may provide different damping for the same @xmath17 in the function @xmath18 , which will affect the dynamics of the quantum system of interest . do the different kinds esdfs affect the dynamics of quantum system of interest mainly through resulting in different damping or through their different forms ? to answer this problem , we introduce an effective coupling strength @xmath19 to calculate the dynamics as ref.@xcite .",
    "the effective coupling constant is introduced from the physical deduce that the modes which has the same frequency as the characteristic frequency of the system @xmath20 has the major contribution to the system - bath interaction .",
    "thus , by using the effective coupling constant we can obtain that , if the reduced dynamics governed by @xmath16 and @xmath12 are different , we can safely attribute the different forms of the @xmath16 and @xmath12 . for lack of space , in the following , we only plot the evolutions of elements of reduced density matrix in the same effective coupling strength @xmath21 for each models .",
    "a quantum system embeds in a bath ( model a ) and a quantum system interacts with an iho which is coupled to a bath ( model b ) , are two basic models and many complicated models are developed from them .",
    "so in this subsection , we use them to show the leggett s method for obtaining the esdfs @xmath22 , and @xmath23 .",
    "then from the two sets of esdfs we investigate the reduced dynamics of qubits in the two models .    model a : because the physical quantities of the quantum system of interest is not included in the esdf , we can deduce the esdfs of the model a with the hamiltonian as @xcite @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the momentum conjugate to coordinate @xmath26 . defining @xmath27 and using the dots for the time derivatives ,",
    "we can obtain the classical equations of the motion as@xmath28 using the fourier transforms , we can write eqs.([1 - 2 - 1 ] ) and ( [ 1 - 2 - 2 ] ) as@xmath29 from eq.([1 - 3 - 2 ] ) we have@xmath30 insetting eq.([1 - 4 ] ) into eq.([1 - 3 - 1 ] ) , we have@xmath31q(\\omega)=-u_{\\omega}^{\\prime}(q\\left (   t\\right )   ) .",
    "\\label{1 - 5}\\ ] ] setting@xmath32 and @xmath33 we then have@xmath34 where ( see appendix)@xmath35 the expression of @xmath36 is given in the appendix . substituting eq.([1 - 9 ] ) into eq.([1 - 5 ] ) we have@xmath37q\\left(\\omega\\right)\\nonumber\\\\ &   = -u_{\\omega}^{\\prime}\\left(q\\right).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if taking @xmath38 be infinite , we can easily obtain the spectral density function as @xmath39 this is the conventional ohmic spectral density function of bath in the original spin - boson model and it has been widely used in quantum dissipative systems . here",
    ", we have only shown that , starting from @xmath13 , an esdf @xmath40 can be obtained .",
    "the @xmath41 and @xmath40 are the same for the bath in the original spin - boson model .",
    "the result shows that the leggett s method give a consistent result for the model .",
    "if the model is not the original spin - boson model ( as following models b , c , and d ) , it can also be reduced to the original spin - boson model but the esdfs should not be equal to the @xmath15 even we start from the same @xmath13 .    if taking @xmath38 be finite , we then obtain the esdf as @xmath42 here , @xmath43 the other forms of the spectral density functions , such as sub - ohmic and super - ohmic forms can be obtained similarly .",
    "it shows that when the cut - off frequency is finite , we should add the term @xmath44 $ ] in the spectral density function as eq.([1 - 12 ] ) .",
    "it is interesting that how does the added term influence the spectral density function ?",
    "in fig.1 we plot @xmath45 $ ] in different cut - off frequencies of the bath .",
    "it shows that the absolute values of the @xmath45 $ ] decreases with the increase of @xmath38 .",
    "when @xmath46 , the @xmath47\\rightarrow0 $ ] .",
    "however , when the cut - off frequency of the bath is not big enough , the influence of @xmath45 $ ] should not be neglected in the description of the environment .    in above derivation of the esdfs , the physical quantities for the quantum system of interest have not been involved , so the @xmath48 can control the dynamics of not only the harmonic oscillator as in eq.([1 - 1 ] ) but also other quantum systems . in order to check the differences of the influences that above two different esdfs @xmath49 and @xmath50 impose on the dynamics for the systems of interest",
    ", we firstly investigate a simple quantum system , qubit . for the open qubit",
    "the total harmiltonian reads @xmath51 this is one of the simplest open models of quantum system but its reduced dynamics can still not be solved exactly , and some approximations must be appealed to .",
    "many investigations on this topic have been made in recent years @xcite . as we stressed that when the cut - off frequency is not too large to compare to the characteristic frequency of the qubit , the non - markovian effect is non - negligible .",
    "the well established iterative tensor multiplication ( itm ) algorithm based on the quasiadiabatic propagator path integral ( quapi ) scheme is a good tool for solving the reduced dynamics of quantum system of interest .",
    "the itm algorithm is a numerically exact one and is successfully tested and adopted in various problems of open quantum systems @xcite . for details of the scheme , we refer readers to previous works @xcite . to make the calculations converge we use the time step @xmath52 which is shorter than the correlation time of the bath and the characteristic time of the qubit . in order to include as much non - markovian effect of the bath as we can , and avoid the heavy calculation load we choose @xmath53 . here , @xmath54 is the memory times being included in the calculations . in this paper",
    "we set @xmath55 k , and the initial state of the bath be the thermal equilibrium state , namely , @xmath56tr@xmath57 .",
    "here , @xmath58 , @xmath59 is the boltzman constant .",
    "as we calculate the evolutions of diagonal elements of the reduced density matrix @xmath60 , we set @xmath61 hz , @xmath62 , and the initial state of the qubit be @xmath63 .",

    "it is shown that in the model a the qubit has shorter decoherence and relaxation times governed by the @xmath72 than by @xmath73 .",
    "model b : there is another basic model that the quantum system of interest is not coupled to any bath but coupled to an iho which is coupled to a bath .",

    "it is contrary to the case of model a , here the qubit has longer decoherence and relaxation times governed by the @xmath94 than by @xmath95 .    as the cut - off frequency of the bath is not very large , the @xmath40 results in shorter decoherence and relaxation times for the qubit in the models a than the @xmath96 does .",
    "however , in model b , to compare to the @xmath97 , the @xmath98 causes longer decoherence and relaxation times of the qubit , as the cut - off frequency of the bath is not very large .",
    "when the cut - off frequency of the bath increases to 5 times ( for the model a ) and 25 times ( for the model b ) of the characteristic frequency of the qubit , the @xmath23 and the @xmath99 will lead to almost the same reduced dynamics of the qubit for the respective models .      in this section",
    "we investigate the other two models c and d. these two models are developed from above two basic models a and b.    model c : the hamiltonian of the model c reads@xmath100 here , the quantum system of interest interacts with the iho and both of them are coupled to their independent baths .",

    "it is shown that the qubit in the model d has longer decoherence and relaxation times than it has in the model c at the same finite cut - off frequency of the baths .",
    "the spectral density function is in fact a bridge to connect the microcosmic and macroscopical physical quantities in dissipative quantum theory . at low temperature ,",
    "the excitations of the bath modes with high frequencies are suppressed .",
    "so the spectral density function derived from infinite cut - off frequency of the bath will be out - of - true . in this paper",
    "we investigate the esdfs @xmath132 for models ( @xmath133a , b , c , d ) at infinite and finite cut - off frequencies of baths from the microcosmic dynamical models by using the method initiated by leggett et .",
    "as the cut - off frequency of the bath is comparable to the characteristic frequency of the quantum system of interest , the non - markovian effects may also be important . in this case",
    ", it is improper to use any markovian approximations to investigate the the reduced dynamics of quantum system .",
    "so we used a numerically exact itm algorithm based on the quapi scheme solving the reduced dynamics of qubits .    in order to clearly compare the difference of the dynamics of quantum systems resulting from different esdfs @xmath134 and @xmath135",
    ", we used the effective coupling constants calculating the dynamics of the qubit in each models and fixed other parameters such as the tempurature is set @xmath136k .",
    "it is shown that a qubit ( the quantum system of interest ) in these models has different dynamics when they are governed by the spectral density functions @xmath134 and @xmath12 as the cut - off frequencies are not too large . the difference increase with the decrease of the cut - off frequency .",
    "when the cut - off frequencies of the baths are larger about 5 times ( for the models based on model a ) and 25 times ( for the models based on model b ) than the characteristic frequency of the qubit , the two kinds of spectral density functions result in almost the same reduced dynamics .",
    "in addition , we obtain that a qubit will have longer relaxation and decoherence times when it is coupled to an iho and both of them are coupled to a common bath rather than to their respective baths .",

    "in the appendix we give a proof of eq.([1 - 9 ] ) , namely prove equation @xmath137 setting@xmath138 and from fig.5 we see that there is not any singular point in the loop of @xmath139 .",
