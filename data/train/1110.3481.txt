    "diluted magnetic semiconductors ( dmss ) , where transition - metal ( tm ) ions are doped into the zno hosts , are currently receiving intense attention due to the possibility of utilizing both charge and spin degrees of freedom in the same materials , allowing us to design new generation spin electronic devices @xcite .",
    "ferromagnetic zno - based dmss have been predicted to have curie temperature ( t@xmath5 ) above room temperature ( rt ) @xcite , making spintronics applications of zno promising .",
    "however , a recent work @xcite has suggested that structurally perfect zno - based dmss do not exhibit ferromagnetic order , but that not only the magnetic dopants themselves but also vacancies are necessary for ferromagnetism .",
    "recently , cu - doped zno ( zno : cu ) dms has attracted much attention because of the observations of rt ferromagnetism @xcite .",
    "a recent x - ray magnetic circular dichroism ( xmcd ) study @xcite on zno : cu films has suggested a microscopic indirect double - exchange model , in which the alignment of localized moments of cu@xmath3 in the vicinity of an oxygen vacancy is mediated by the large - sized vacancy orbitals through cu@xmath6-cu@xmath3 ferromagnetic interaction .",
    "although this experimental work @xcite suggests ferromagnetic interaction between the doped cu ions via oxygen vacancies and the importance of electron doping for ferromagnetism in zno : cu , a recent first - principle calculation @xcite has indicated that @xmath7-type zno : cu shows ferromagnetism but @xmath8-type zno : cu would not have local magnetic moment . also , an xmcd study by thakur @xmath0 @xmath1 .",
    "@xcite has shown that cu@xmath3 and cu@xmath2 ions in zno : cu dms are magnetically active . if the divalent cu ions are converted from divalent to trivalent due to zn vacancies as pointed by ganguli @xmath0 @xmath1 .",
    "@xcite , thakur s work @xcite may imply hole - mediated ferromagnetism in zno : cu . also , experimental results @xcite using scanning electron microscopy ( sem ) and transmission electron microscopy ( tem ) suggest that structural imperfections due to cu diffusion yield a greater overall volume occupied by bound magnetic polarons ( bmps ) , promoting the creation and percolation of ferromagnetic regions .",
    "thus , no consensus on the origin of the ferromagnetism in zno : cu has been achieved from the electronic structure point of view . in order to clarify the issue , fundamental understanding the electronic structure of doped cu ions in ferromagnetic zno : cu is essential .    in the present work",
    ", we have performed x - ray photoemission spectroscopy ( xps ) , x - ray absorption spectroscpy ( xas ) and xmcd measurements on zno : cu nanowires ( nws ) .",
    "the electronic configuration of the doped cu ions has been determined by xps and xas .",
    "note that the line shape and the peak energies of the cu 2@xmath7 xps spectrum are sensitive to the electronic configuration of the cu ion @xcite .",
    "ferromagnetic interaction between cu ions has been studied by the combination of surface- and bulk - sensitive cu 2@xmath7 - 3@xmath9 xmcd measurements .",
    "details of the sample preparation of zno : cu nws were described in ref .",
    "the zno nws were grown by vapor phase transport inside a horizontal quartz tube furnace ( lindberg / blue mini - mite ) . to obtain the sample zno : cu ( cu@xmath42.2% )",
    "nws , a 2 nm layer of cu was sputtered onto the surface of the vertically aligned nanowires , followed by a thermal treatment in air at temperatures between 600 and 800 @xmath10c for 8 h. structural characterization was carried out by x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) , sem and tem , demonstrating a clear nw phase with no secondary phase @xcite .",
    "the zno : cu nw is a column - shaped crystal ( not a hollow pillar ) , and the diameter and length were 120 - 400 nm and 4 @xmath11 m , respectively .",
    "we refer to the surface layer of @xmath45 nm thickness of the nw as the surface region .",
    "note that a secondary ion mass spectroscopy study revealed inhomogeneous distribution of cu atoms in this sample .",
    "xas and xmcd measurements were performed at the dragon beamline bl-11a of national synchrotron radiation research center ( nsrrc ) , taiwan .",
    "the spectra were taken both in the total - electron - yield ( tey : probing depth @xmath4 5 nm ) and the total - fluorescene - yield ( tfy : probing depth @xmath4 100 nm ) modes .",
    "the monochromator resolution was @xmath12/@xmath13@xmath12@xmath1410000 and the circular polarization of x - rays was @xmath4 60% .",
    "xps measurements were performed using the photon energy of @xmath15@xmath16 = 1253.6 ev ( mg - k@xmath17 ) .",
    "photoelectrons were collected using a scienta ses-100 electron - energy analyzer .",
    "the energy resolution was about @xmath4 800 mev .",
    "figure 1 shows the cu 2@xmath7 xps spectra of zno : cu and various copper oxides cu@xmath18o @xcite , cuo @xcite , and nacuo@xmath18 @xcite . for zno",
    ": cu , one can see a small satellite feature around 945 ev , reflecting the ionic character of doped cu atoms . by comparing the xps line shape of zno : cu with those of the other oxides , it is likely that the electronic structure of the doped cu ions is similar to that of cu ions in nacuo@xmath18 .",
    "thus , we assigned the main peak and the satellite feature of zno : cu to 2@xmath193@xmath9@xmath20@xmath21@xmath22 ( @xmath19 = cu 2@xmath7 hole , @xmath21 = ligand hole ) and 2@xmath193@xmath9@xmath23@xmath21 final states , respectively .",
    "although nacuo@xmath18 is known as a formally cu@xmath2 insulator , we note that the notation cu@xmath2 does not necessary imply the pure 3@xmath24 configuration but includes strong influence of cu 3@xmath9@xmath25o 2@xmath7 covalency @xcite . in cu@xmath2 oxides , in fact , the wave function of the cu ion fundamental state is a linear combination of the 3@xmath24 , 3@xmath9@xmath26@xmath21 and 3@xmath9@xmath20@xmath21@xmath22 configurations . from xps results , we suggest that , within the probing depth region of xps measurement ( @xmath45 - 10 nm ) , the doped cu ions in zno : cu nws are cu@xmath2 dominated by 3@xmath9@xmath26@xmath21 and 3@xmath9@xmath20@xmath21@xmath22 .     xps spectra of the zno : cu nws and other copper oxides cu@xmath18o @xcite , cuo @xcite , and nacuo@xmath18 @xcite.,width=264 ]    @xmath273@xmath9 xas spectra of the zno : cu nws and other copper oxides cu@xmath18o , cuo @xcite , nacuo@xmath18",

    "the weak feature around 931 ev in the spectrum of nacuo@xmath18 is an extrinsic signal due to the 3@xmath9@xmath26 ground state of cu@xmath3 impurities @xcite .",

    ": cu , although the cu 2@xmath7@xmath31 main peak position of the xas spectra taken both in the surface - sensitive tey and bulk - sensitive tfy modes is same , the line shape is different .",
    "this reflects differences in the electronic structure between the bulk and surface regions of the zno : cu nws .",
    "now , we discuss differences in the electronic structure between the surface and bulk regions of the zno : cu nws . by comparing the peak position and line shape of the xas spectrum of zno : cu taken in the tey mode with those of the cu oxides , we find that , in the spectrum of zno : cu , the main peak a originates from the 2@xmath193@xmath9@xmath20@xmath21 final state due to the 3@xmath9@xmath26@xmath21 ground state because main peak a is located at the same energy position with the main peak position of nacuo@xmath18 and la@xmath18li@xmath28cu@xmath28o@xmath29 .",
    "the finding that the doped cu ions in the surface region ( @xmath4 5 nm ) are cu@xmath2 , i.e. , cu@xmath3 states plus oxygen @xmath7 holes , is consistent with the xps results . on the other hand , in the spectrum taken in the tfy mode",
    ", the satellite structure b around 940 ev and the feature a in the leading - edge of the cu 2@xmath7@xmath31 main peak were observed in addition to the main peak a. we find that feature a is located at the same energy position with the main peak position of cuo @xcite and that the feature originates from the @xmath32 states , that is , cu@xmath3 .",
    "this indicates the presence of cu@xmath3 states in the bulk region of zno : cu .",
    "in addition to this , the satellite structure b due to @xmath33 are observed only in the spectrum of zno : cu taken in the tfy mode .",
    "this means that cu 3@xmath9-o 2@xmath7 covalency in the surface region is stronger than that in the bulk region . from the xas results",
    ", we suggest that the surface electronic structure of the surface region differs from the bulk one and that the electronic structures of the doped cu atoms in the surface and bulk regions of zno : cu are predominantly cu@xmath2 and cu@xmath3/cu@xmath2 , respectively .",

    "3(b ) , the xmcd signal is normalized to the xas intensity . note that the xmcd strength is free from the diamagnetism of the substrate . the xmcd signal taken in the tey mode is weak or negligible , indicating that the cu@xmath2 states in the surface region ( @xmath4 5 nm ) are magnetically inactive . on the other hand ,",

    "the cu 2@xmath7@xmath273@xmath9 xmcd intensity is about @xmath41.3% , indicating that a small amount of the cu@xmath3/cu@xmath2 states in the bulk region is magnetically active in the zno : cu nws .",
    "the fact that the cu@xmath3/cu@xmath2 states are magnetically active is consistent with thakur s work @xcite .",
    "however , the facts that cu@xmath2 states mainly exist in the surface region ( @xmath4 5 nm ) and that clear cu 2@xmath7@xmath273@xmath9 xmcd signals were not observed when taken in the tey mode disagree with thakur s work .",
    "it is likely that the inconsistency can be attributed to the different samples ( films @xmath36 nws ) .",
    "figures 3(c ) and ( d ) show magnetic field and temperature dependences of the cu 2@xmath7@xmath273@xmath9 xmcd intensity , respectively , taken in the tfy mode . following a previous xmcd study of dms @xcite",
    ", we confirmed the presence of ferromagnetism by linear extrapolation of the xmcd intensity to zero field [ see fig .",
    "3(c ) ] . based on the xmcd intensities taken in the tfy mode",
    ", we suggest that only a small portion ( @xmath4 1% ) of cu ions in the bulk region are ferromagnetic ( fm ) . on the other hand",
    ", we could not observe a clear paramagnetic ( pm ) component due to the remaining ( @xmath4 99% ) cu ions , because the intensities of the xmcd signals , taken in the tfy mode , were unchanged with magnetic field .",
    "therefore , as shown in fig .",
    "4 , we conclude that the fm interaction of zno : cu nws comes from the cu@xmath3 and cu@xmath2 states in the bulk region and not in the surface region . also , it is likely that , in the bulk region , fm and antiferromagnetic ( afm ) interactions coexist and that most of the doped cu ions in the bulk region are antiferromagnetically coupled with each other .",
    "our result suggests that the coexistence of the cu@xmath2 states , which are mainly due to the 3@xmath9@xmath26@xmath21 ground states , i.e. , cu@xmath3 states plus oxygen @xmath7 holes , and the cu@xmath3 states triggers the ferromagnetism in zno : cu nws .",
    "we have performed xps , xas and xmcd measurements on zno : cu nws . from the cu 2@xmath7 xps and cu 2@xmath7@xmath273@xmath9 xas results , we suggest that the electronic structures of the doped cu atoms in the surface ( @xmath4 5 nm ) and bulk ( @xmath4 100 nm ) regions of zno : cu are predominantly  cu@xmath2 \" and cu@xmath3/cu@xmath2 \" , respectively .",
    "xmcd signals due to ferromagnetism were observed at the cu 2@xmath7 absorption edge taken in the tfy mode . from the magnetic field and temperature dependences of the xmcd intensity , we conclude that the fm interaction of zno : cu nws comes from the cu@xmath3 and  cu@xmath2 \" states in the bulk region and that most of the doped cu ions are magnetically inactive probably because they are antiferromagnetically coupled with each other .",
