    "bulk water presents a peculiar complexity on its properties . while in most materials",
    "the decrease of the temperature results in a monotonic increase of the density , the water , at ambient pressure , has a maximum in its density at @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , for usual liquids the response functions increase with the increase of temperature , while water exhibits an anomalous increase of compressibility  @xcite between @xmath1 mpa and @xmath2 mpa and , at atmospheric pressure , an increase of isobaric heat capacity upon cooling  @xcite .",
    "the anomalous behavior of water are not only related with thermodynamic functions , the diffusion coefficient for water has a maximum at @xmath0 for @xmath3  @xcite , whereas for normal liquids it increases with the decrease of pressure .",
    "the anomalies have been explained in the framework of the existence of a liquid - liquid phase transition ending in a second critical point .",
    "this critical point is , however , hidden in a region of the pressure - temperature phase diagram where homogeneous nucleation takes place , and the two liquid phases do not equilibrate  @xcite .",
    "the difficulty of finding the liquid - liquid critical point has been circumvent by experiments performed in confined systems . in these systems",
    "the presence of criticality in the bulk has been associated with a dynamic transition between liquids of different viscosities  @xcite .",
    "the study of water in confined geometries is , however , important not only to understand its anomalous properties but also to learn about essential processes to the existence of life , like enzymatic activity of proteins  @xcite .",
    "confined water plays an important role in many other areas like chemistry , engineering and geology . for these systems",
    "is very important to understand the effect in the pressure - temperature phase diagram of the size of the confinement and the hydrophobicity of the wall .",
    "experiments with water in confined geometries employing nmr  @xcite and x - ray diffraction  @xcite show two complementary important findings .",
    "first , the pore size has important influence on the freezing and melting temperature .",
    "next , the freezing in these systems is not uniform .",
    "water form layers inside the pores  @xcite that do not freeze at the same temperature  @xcite but the middle layers crystallize before the wall layers  @xcite .",
    "less clear than the pore size effect is the water - wall interaction effect on the melting temperature .",
    "experimental studies show contradictory results . while akcakayiran et al .",
    "@xcite using calorimetry studies of water in pores with phosphonic , sulfonic and carboxylic acids show that the melting temperature is not affected by the change of surface , deschamps et al .",
    "@xcite and jelassi et al .",
    "@xcite show that for water confined in hydrophobic nanopores the liquid states persists to temperatures lower than in bulk and in hydrophilic confinement .",
    "these observations are confirmed by x - ray and neutron diffraction  @xcite .",
    "simulations agree with the experiments in two points .",
    "first , the melting temperature of confined water decreases as the system becomes more restrict by decreasing the pore size or distance between plates  @xcite .",
    "second , the system forms layers  @xcite where not all the confined water crystallizes  @xcite . the crystallized layer along the wall is in contact with a pre - wetting liquid layer and some systems present the formation of layers where water just crystallizes partially  @xcite",
    ".    simulations also show controversial results for the effect of hydrophobicity in the melting temperature .",
    "while results for spc / e water show that the melting temperature for hydrophobic plates is lower than the bulk and higher than for hydrophilic walls , for mw model no difference between the melting temperature due to the hydrophobicity  @xcite is found .",
    "in addition to the melting line , other thermodynamic properties have been explored by simulations . in confined systems",
    "the tmd occurs at lower temperatures for hydrophobic confinement  @xcite and at higher temperatures for hydrophilic confinement  @xcite when compared with the bulk .",
    "the diffusion coefficient , @xmath4 , in the direction parallel to the plates exhibit an anomalous behavior as observed in bulk water .",
    "however the temperatures of the the maximum and minimum of @xmath4 are lower than in bulk water  @xcite . in the direction perpendicular to the plates , no diffusion anomalous behavior is observed  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we propose that many of the properties described above can be explained in the framework of the competition between the particle - particle interaction and the particle - plate interaction potentials .",
    "for that purpose , we study a core - softened fluid  @xcite confined between parallel plates @xcite .",
    "the particle - plate interaction is then varied from a very hydrophobic to hydrophilic interaction . the pressure and temperature location of the anomalies , melting and layering",
    "are compared with the bulk system for the different particle - plate interactions .",
