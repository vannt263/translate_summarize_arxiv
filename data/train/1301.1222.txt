    "the current design for the future international linear collider ( ilc ) includes a positron source based on a superconducting helical undulator which is placed at the end of main linear accelerator . due to the helical undulator",

    "the degree of polarization is determined by the undulator and electron beam parameters .",
    "a prototype of a helical undulator for the ilc positron source has been developed and tested at daresbury @xcite . according to the ilc requirements @xcite , the yield of the source should have 50% safety margin in a wide energy range of drive beam energy ( between 100gev and 250gev ) .",
    "that means the positron yield at the injection point into the dumping ring ( dr ) has to be 1.5 positrons per electron going through the undulator . a center - of - mass energy of 1tev is considered as upgrade option .    figure[fyieldpolulength - vs - e ] shows the positron yield depending on the electron beam ( drive ) energy for a source with a fixed undulator length of @xmath3 m , an undulator period @xmath4 mm and @xmath5 . the source with these undulator parameters ( rdr undulator ) can generate much more positrons than required , therefore , there are two ways to keep the yield at 1.5 e@xmath6/e@xmath7 , either to reduce the undulator length by switching - off unnecessary modules ( see the right plot in fig.[fyieldpolulength - vs - e ] ) or to reduce the magnetic field of the undulator .    /e@xmath7",

    "these parameters have been kept in all our calculations presented in this report .",
    "the simulations have been performed by a geant4-based tool that was specially developed for polarized positron source simulations ( pps - sim ) @xcite .",
    "figure[fcerdr - vs - e ] shows the capture efficiency of the source with rdr undulator .",
    "the capture efficiency is the ratio of the number of positrons at the end of the source ( the positron beam has to fit dr acceptance ) to the number of positrons after the target .",
    "the maximum of capture efficiency is about 27% at 250gev . for a 500gev e@xmath7 beam",
    "the capture efficiency is falling down to 21% .",
    "figure[fyieldpolulength - vs - e ] shows the dependence of polarization on the @xmath9 energy ( see the red curve on the left plot ) . the higher @xmath9 energy results in lower polarization .",
    "5% polarization at 500gev is too low to get any advantages for physics of using such low polarized positron beams .",
    "the opening angle of undulator radiation ( as well as the radius of photon spot size on target ) is inversely proportional to the electron energy .",
    "for instance , doubled e@xmath7 energy results in four times higher energy deposition density in a stationary target . with lower @xmath0 values higher polarization can be achieved",
    "however , lowering the undulator @xmath10 field will additionally reduce the photon spot size .",
    "therefore , for the 1tev upgrade of the ilc , another undulator with higher period has been proposed in @xcite .    in this report ,",

    "an undulator with higher @xmath0 value yields lower energy of the fundamental harmonic but larger contribution of higher harmonics . as result",
    "the average energy over the whole photon spectrum is growing with increasing field of undulator .",

    "one possibility to get the polarization above 25% is a further reduction of the undulator field . in this case",
    "the undulator has to be longer then 231meters .",

    "for instance , a flux concentrator with higher field improves both yield and polarization .",

    "figure[fpol - vs - k - woc ] shows that even for the moderate 3.2 t peak field of fc , the source needs 121 meters undulator with strength @xmath17 ; such choice of source parameters results in 20% positron polarization .",
    "only three undulator modules ( 33 meters of total active undulator length ) are needed to get the required intensity of the positron beam at @xmath1 .",
    "hence , there is a big reserve in undulator length in case of using a high @xmath0 undulator .",
    "one possible way to increase the polarization is applying photon collimator  @xcite .",
    "the absorption of photons in the collimator and the reduction of the @xmath15 yield can be compensated by lengthening the undulator .",
    "figure[fpol - vs - k - withc ] summarizes the dependence of maximal achievable positron polarization on different undulator @xmath0 values .",
    "in addition to the e@xmath6 polarization , also the aperture sizes of photon collimators and the required ( for 1.5 e@xmath6/e@xmath7 ) undulator lengths are shown as red and blue numbers respectively . 54% polarization can be reached with a photon collimator having 0.9 mm aperture radius and @xmath1 .",
    "the source with @xmath17 requires a lower collimator aperture ( @xmath18 mm ) and the e@xmath6 polarization is about 41% .     for a source with collimator .",

    "to get 54% polarization while keeping the yield at 1.5 e@xmath6/e@xmath7 for a source with @xmath1 , the undulator length has to be increased from 33 meters ( fig.[fpol - vs - k - woc ] ) to 176 meters ( fig.[fpol - vs - k - withc ] ) . in spite of the major part of photon power",

    "the maximal rise of temperature after one pulse is about 125@xmath25c .",
    "the fast increase of target temperature induces thermal stress .",
    "the stress distribution in the target shortly after the bunch train passed ( 82 ns delay ) is shown in fig.[ftempstress - k25withcrot ] ( right ) .",

    "such stress values ( without taking into account the stress due to centrifugal forces of rotating wheel and without accumulating / superposition effects of multiple pulses ) can be considered as safe .",
