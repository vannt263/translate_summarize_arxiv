    "resonant cavities have been frequently used to test lorentz invariance in photons .",
    "these cavity experiments can be classified into two types , depending on the parity of the cavity used .",
    "even - parity experiments have put limits on even - parity light speed anisotropy to the @xmath1 level@xcite .",
    "our experiment is one of the few odd - parity experiments .",
    "we look for a nonzero resonant frequency difference between two counterpropagating directions of an asymmetric optical ring cavity by making use of a double - pass configuration . we have put limits on odd - parity anisotropy to the @xmath0 level@xcite , which is an order of magnitude improvement over previous results from cavity experiments@xcite , and is comparable with a result from a compton scattering experiment@xcite .",
    "a simple way to express the odd - parity lorentz violation is to express the speed of light with @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the direction of the light propagation with respect to the preferred frame and @xmath4 is an anisotropy parameter that is zero when there is no violation . from this expression , the resonant frequency shift ( @xmath5 ) of a cavity due to the anisotropy",
    "is calculated as @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the refractive index through the path , and the integral is taken over the round - trip path of the cavity .",
    "@xmath5 will be nonzero if @xmath7 changes asymmetrically .",
    "also , since the signs of @xmath5 will be opposite between the round - trip integral taken clockwise and counterclockwise , measuring the resonant frequency difference between two counterpropagating directions gives us a null measurement of the anisotropy parameter @xmath4 .",
    "this differential measurement is highly insensitive to environmental disturbances because the effects of cavity length fluctuations are common to both resonances .    our ring cavity , shown in fig .",
    "[ michi : fig1](a ) and ( b ) , is a triangular cavity constructed from three half - inch mirrors .",
    "these mirrors are mechanically fixed on a spacer made of super invar .",
    "the spacer has through holes for the optical path .",
    "the radius of the holes are @xmath8 and the beam radius inside the cavity is @xmath9 at maximum .",
    "the spacer also has a hole for placing a silicon piece along one side of the triangle .",
    "this silicon piece is rectangular , and its size is @xmath10 . also , this silicon piece is antireflection coated ( @xmath11/surface ) , and the incident beam to this piece is slightly angled ( @xmath12 ) in order to avoid the cross coupling between the counterpropagating beams .",
    "silicon has high transmittance and a large refractive index ( measured value @xmath13 ) at wavelength @xmath14 .",
    "the round - trip length of our cavity is @xmath15 and the finesse is about 120 for p - polarized light , with the silicon piece inside the cavity .",
    "we use a double - pass configuration for comparing the resonant frequencies between the counterpropagating directions@xcite [ see fig .  [",
    "michi : fig1](c ) ] .",
    "we use a single - frequency laser source with a wavelength of @xmath16 ( koheras adjustik c15 ) . measured relative frequency noise and relative intensity noise without any external stabilization servo was @xmath17 and @xmath18 at @xmath19 respectively .",
    "no external intensity stabilization was employed .",
    "the laser beam is fed into the ring cavity in the counterclockwise direction via a polarization maintaining fiber .",
    "a collimator ( thorlabs paf - x-5-c ) was used to align and mode - match the incident beam to the ring cavity . the incident beam power to the ring cavity is about 1 mw .    the frequency of the laser beam is stabilized to the counterclockwise resonance using a piezoelectric actuator attached on the laser cavity .",
    "we used the hnsh - coulillaud method  @xcite to obtain the error signal for the laser frequency servo . by taking the differential of two pd outputs to obtain an error signal ,",
    "we reduce the effect of laser intensity fluctuation .    the transmitted light of the counterclockwise beam is then reflected back into the cavity in the clockwise direction by a reflection mirror ( rm ) .",
    "we obtain the second error signal , which is proportional to the resonant frequency difference , and in this signal we search for the lorentz violation . measured relative frequency noise of the second error signal was @xmath20 at @xmath19 . to obtain the second error signal",
    ", we again used the hnsch - couillaud method .",
    "we did not use pound - drever - hall method because we did not want to introduce spatial mode distortion of the beam from phase modulation .",
    "this double - pass configuration enables a null measurement of the resonant frequency difference with a fairly simple setup . another way to measure",
    "the resonant frequency difference is to inject the laser beam from both directions , stabilize the frequency of each beam to each resonance , and compare the frequency of counterpropagating beams  @xcite .",
    "however , this configuration needs additional actuation ( e.g. , acousto - optic modulator ) and servo , which could introduce additional noise . also , stabilizing the frequencies of two counterpropagating beams of a ring cavity has the possibility of lock - in behavior  @xcite , which is a common effect in ring laser gyroscope .",
    "all the optics are placed in a @xmath21 vacuum enclosure ( @xmath22 ) to realize a stable operation .",
    "this enclosure is fixed on a turntable together with the laser source , and rotated with a direct drive servo motor ( nikki denso nmr - cauia2a-151a ) .",
    "positive and reverse rotations of @xmath23 are repeated alternately in order to avoid twist of the electrical cables .",
    "we used thin cables ( @xmath24 ) for reducing vibrations introduced through the cables .",
    "the rotational speed is @xmath25/sec ( @xmath26 hz ) , and s - curve acceleration and deceleration was used when flipping the sign of the rotations in order to avoid sudden rotational speed change . for data analysis , we only used an interval of @xmath27 in the middle of each rotation where the rotational speed is constant .",
    "measured rotational speed fluctuation was less than @xmath28 at @xmath19 .",
    "since august 2012 , we are continuing the lorentz violation search . figure  [ michi :",
    "fig1](d ) shows recent results from the data taken for 232 days between august 2012 to april 2013 .",
    "six sidereal modulation amplitudes defined in ref .   are plotted .",
    "standard errors of each averaged amplitude are @xmath29 , which is factor of @xmath30 improvement over our previous results  @xcite .",
    "no deviation from zero by more than @xmath31 was found .",
    "this means that there is no significant evidence for anisotropy in the speed of light in a sidereal frame at the level of @xmath0 .",
    "we are expecting to achieve a year - long run in august 2013 . by using the year - long data",
    ", we are planning to put first limits on odd - parity higher - order coefficients in sme  @xcite .",
    "we thank matthew mewes for useful discussions . this work was supported by grant - in - aid for jsps fellows number 25@xmath3210386 ."
