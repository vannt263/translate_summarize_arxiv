    "this conspicuous structure , known as local cavity ( lc ) or local bubble , consists of a very irregular , low density volume ( @xmath3 @xmath4 ) of the interstellar medium ( ism ) , whose borders extend from @xmath5 to @xmath2pc , depending on the direction to which we observe it @xcite .",
    "this cavity is surrounded by several other interstellar bubbles that are sometimes associated to strong star - forming activity , and are frequently believed to have been generated by supernovae ( sn ) explosions and very intense stellar winds from massive ob stars @xcite .",
    "several efforts have been made to build a tridimensional view of the lc , mainly by using na i observations in the direction of nearby stars , which is a suitable tracer of the neutral gas @xcite .",

    "the overall shape of the lc suggests that it is being compressed due to the expansion of the neighboring bubbles , with a narrower dimension along the galactic plane ( gp ) , and probably opened in the direction of the galactic halo .",
    "furthermore , this ",
    "chimney \" structure is slightly tilted relative to the gp ( @xmath6 ) , and perpendicular to the gould s belt , a large complex of young massive ob stars surrounding the local ism @xcite .    in the direction of the galactic center",
    ", we find a particularly interesting structure known as the loop i superbubble , which is centered at the scorpio - centaurus ob association ( sco - cen , @xmath7 ) , and probably created due to its intense stellar activity @xcite .",
    "this neighboring interstellar bubble , located at @xmath8pc and defined by a large sky - projected diameter ( @xmath9 ) , has been better revealed by radio continuum observations , which show several arc - shaped shells of interstellar material @xcite .",
    "the proximity between the local and loop i bubbles led some authors to believe that some kind of interaction could be taking place between them @xcite .",
    "in fact , by analyzing shadowing effects at the wide - angle soft x - ray survey from rosat ( @xmath10kev ) , @xcite proposed that the collision between both bubbles led to the formation of a wall of neutral gas surrounded by a dense interstellar ring feature at the interaction zone .",
    "this conclusion was inspired by collisional models of spherical shock fronts , which revealed that a dense interacting wall would arise , encompassed by an even denser annular feature , if at least one of the interacting shells have reached the radiative stage before the collision occurred @xcite .",
    "this idea was supported by an anticorrelation between the shadows from the soft x - ray maps and the neutral hydrogen ( hi ) emission from the local ism @xcite .    up to date",
    ", several attempts have been made to determine the distance to the supposed interacting region , leading to widely different results .",
    "@xcite suggested a distance of @xmath11 pc , from the analysis of ultraviolet spectra to eight stars at the region defined by @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "@xcite used hi column densities data from @xcite to determine a distance of @xmath14 pc , defined by a jump in @xmath15 from @xmath16 @xmath17 to @xmath18 @xmath17 at this distance .    using @xmath19 color excess data and high resolution spectroscopy in the direction of the southern coalsack , chamaeleon , and musca dark clouds",
    "@xcite suggested that the interaction zone is twisted and folded , located at @xmath20 pc along this line - of - sight .",
    "as previously pointed out by @xcite , several dark clouds ( @xmath21 oph , lupus , r cra , g317 - 4 , southern coalsack , chamaeleon , and musca ) are located at the same mean distance of @xmath22 pc , in the direction of loop i. however , @xcite identified the presence of an interstellar cloud in the direction of @xmath23 , at approximately @xmath24 pc from the sun , suggesting that this could be part of the interface between the local and loop i bubbles .",
    "recently , @xcite used a larger sample of @xmath19 color excess data distributed along the entire interface region to map the interstellar dust distribution .",
    "the analysis led to the conclusion that the expected transition from nearly @xmath25 to @xmath26 ( which corresponds to the ring s density , as proposed by * ? ? ? * ) , occurs at the western ( left ) side at @xmath27pc while the eastern ( right side ) transition can not be clearly defined before @xmath28 pc .",
    "moreover , the structure of the interstellar magnetic field along the borders of the lc have been previously studied by several polarimetric surveys @xcite .",
    "it is known that the local ism is filled by an irregular , large - scale magnetic flux of average intensity @xmath29 g @xcite .",
    "although no final conclusion has been reached in relation to the dominant physical mechanism responsible for the alignment of the interstellar dust particles , it is generally accepted that in the majority of cases , grain alignment occurs with the grain s major axis perpendicular to the magnetic field direction @xcite .",
    "this configuration of dust grains gives rise to an anisotropic extinction which results in a partially polarized transmitted light beam from a distant star , with position angle in the same direction as the field @xmath30 .",
    "therefore , there is a strong correlation between the direction of the plane - of - sky projected component of @xmath30 and the polarization vectors , which can be used as a powerful tool to map the galactic magnetic field , as well as to probe the nature of the interstellar dust particles .",
    "all - sky polarization surveys exhibit a large - scale vectors distribution pattern which is generally correlated to the direction of the local interstellar structures .",
    "specifically , it is frequently found that polarization vectors may be aligned roughly perpendicular or parallel to the interstellar filaments , depending on several physical and geometrical factors , including projection effects @xcite . particularly along the galactic plane",
    "it is noted an overall distribution of polarization angles which is mainly horizontal ( i.e. , parallel to the plane ) .",
    "such trend reflects the morphology of the local magnetic field , directed mainly along the local spiral arm .",
    "in fact , this predominant orientation along the galactic plane vanishes when the local magnetic field is viewed face - on along its  poles \" at @xmath31 , which is roughly coincident with the direction of the local spiral arm .",
    "large - scale mappings of the magnetic field structure in other spiral galaxies show that the orientation parallel to the galactic plane is a general trend which may be attributed to differential rotation of the galactic disk and magnetic flux freezing with the interstellar matter @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we present an optical polarimetric survey in the direction of the interface between the lc and loop i. section [ obsdata ] provides a description of the observational data , as well as the reduction process .",
    "the results and analysis of the correlation between polarimetric and color excess data , as well as of the spatial distribution of the polarimetric vectors and polarization degree as a function of distance are shown on sections [ correlation_p_colourexcess ] , [ polvec ] and [ poldist ] . discussion of the results is carried out on section [ discussion ] and the conclusions are shown on section [ conclusions ] .",
    "the polarimetric data used in this work were collected at opd ( observatrio pico dos dias , lna / mct , brazil ) during @xmath32 nights distributed between 2007 august and 2009 february .",
    "we have used both the @xmath33 cm and @xmath34 m telescopes , equipped with an imaging polarimeter attached to a specially adapted ccd camera .",
    "the polarimeter consists of a rotating half - wave retarder , a fixed analyzer , and a filter wheel .",
    "the half - wave retarder is allowed to rotate in discrete steps of @xmath35 , so that 16 steps corresponds to a complete rotation ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "its effect on the incident stellar light is to cause a rotation of the polarization plane of the linearly polarized component .",
    "for instance , if the stellar initial polarization angle ( relative to the north celestial pole - ncp ) is @xmath37 , and @xmath38 is the angle between the retarder s optical axis and the ncp , the outcome is a light beam with polarization angle of @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "the analyzer was a savart plate , i.e. , a birefringent double calcite prism which subdivides the incoming light beam into two orthogonally plane - polarized beams .",
    "thereafter , both beams pass through a filter , and are simultaneously detected by the ccd , which registers the individual beams intensities at each position of the half - wave retarder ( for a complete description of this instrument , see * ? ? ?",
    "thus , the q and u stokes parameters are obtained by fitting a 4-cosine modulation amplitude curve @xcite , so that the polarization degree ( @xmath40 ) and the polarization angle ( @xmath37 ) may be calculated , respectively , by    @xmath41    ( @xmath42 represents the intensity of the incident light beam ) .",
    "the simultaneous observation of both light beams allows a differential calculation of the polarization parameters , i.e. , independent of the atmospheric variations .    , colored in red at the electronic version )",
    "represent objects observed at opd / lna and open circles ( @xmath43 ) represent the data acquired from @xcite catalogue .",
    "the thick contour indicates the position of the annular feature proposed by @xcite , and the boxes roughly delimit the position of the indicated dark clouds .",

    "large polarization values ( @xmath44 ) are seen in the direction of several dark clouds distributed along the interface area .",
    "when analyzing the distances to these interstellar structures , we notice a difference in positions of clouds from the left side ( r cra , @xmath21 oph ; at @xmath45 pc ) when compared to the right side ( southern coalsack , chamaeleon and musca complex ; at @xmath46 pc ) .",
    "this may indicate that the interface is tilted with respect to the sun .",
    "figure [ vecpol_integrated ] show that inside the contour the polarized vectors orientation is mainly parallel to the gp .",
    "however , along the left side ( particularly along the r cra dark cloud ) , vectors are oriented perpendicularly to the gp . according to @xcite , an expanding shell from the upper centaurus - lupus ( ucl ) sco - cen sub - group",
    "would have collided with the r cra dark cloud a few million years ago , creating the cloud s cometary shape and triggering star formation . in this direction ,",
    "polarized vectors are oriented parallel to the  head - tail \" direction of the cloud , and therefore perpendicular to the gp .",
    "this could be a local effect of the distortion of magnetic field lines due to the passage of the expanding shell .    along the contour of the ring",
    ", a coherent alignment of polarization vectors appears toward the left - northern side ( areas a1 , a2 , a3 and a4 ) , tracing a loop - shaped structure of magnetic field lines .",
    "the distance to this structure is evident from a rise in polarization values at @xmath47 pc . the serpens - aquila molecular cloud ( @xmath48 , which is positioned toward the a1 area , is probably located at @xmath49 pc , according to @xcite . in fact , the a1 diagram shows a second polarization rise at @xmath50 pc , which could correspond to this interstellar structure .",
    "however , the first rise to @xmath51 at @xmath52 pc ( also detected at the photometric survey ) suggests the presence of nearer interstellar material in front of the denser molecular cloud .    along the right side of the ring ,",
    "the first rise to low polarization values @xmath53 occurs only after @xmath49 pc .",
    "furthermore , the vectors orientation is mainly uncorrelated to the contour of the ring .",
    "further discussion of vectors orientation along the ring will be presented in section [ disc_polvec_ring ]    outside the contour of the ring the most conspicuous structure is the north polar spur ( along e1 and e2 areas ) , located at approximately @xmath54 pc . in this direction",
    "polarized vectors are oriented in a loop pattern parallel to the radio filament .",
    "the results presented in section [ poldist ] are in agreement with a similar analysis made by @xcite using @xmath19 color excesses as a function of distance to several rectangular areas located along the interface region .",
    "particularly , the above mentioned work revealed that the expected transition to @xmath55 , corresponding to the ring s column density , occurs on the left side of the ring at @xmath56 pc , while the right side transition is not clearly seen before @xmath57 pc .",
    "accordingly , our data show that the left side rise to @xmath58 occurs at @xmath59 pc , while the right side regions exhibit the same transition only beyond @xmath60 pc .",
    "the results of both surveys also match for areas inside and outside the ring region . when comparing the polarimetric and photometric analysis along each line - of - sight , the increase in polarization and @xmath19 always occur at the same distances .",
    "for example , if we compare figures 9 , 10 and 11 from @xcite with our figures [ pdist_exterior ] , [ pdist_ring ] and [ pdist_interior ] , we note that : in the direction of a2 , a rise both in polarization and @xmath19 is seen at approximately @xmath61 pc ; toward the sccm clouds ( i5 area ) , both @xmath40 and @xmath19 increases sharply at @xmath46 pc .",
    "such correlations may be noted throughout several other areas and may be explained by the good association between color excesses and polarization values , as presented on section [ correlation_p_colourexcess ] .    despite the correlation between @xmath40 and @xmath19 , polarization efficiency variations along the ring",
    "possibly could exist locally , toward specific areas , particularly in the direction of star - forming regions , where the radiation field is more intense @xcite .",
    "however , given the largely correlated distances obtained from the polarimetric analysis when compared to the photometric survey @xcite , _ local _ variations of @xmath62 does not affect our _ global _ conclusions on the positions of the several interstellar structures .",
    "comparing the polarization properties between the interfaces s left and right sides , it is worth noting that the gradual decrease in the highest polarization values observed in the right side ( @xmath63 ) relative to the left ones ( @xmath64 ) may be due to a greater proximity of the right side with the  magnetic pole \" associated to the large - scale structure of the galactic magnetic field at the solar neighborhood , which is mainly directed along the local spiral arm of the galaxy . according to @xcite and @xcite the magnetic pole is located toward @xmath65 , and can be viewed face - on in this direction .",
    "this is revealed by a greater dispersion in polarization angles and lower polarization degree values toward this line - of - sight , which traces only the sky - projected component of the magnetic field . however",
    ", this fact does nt impair our analysis of polarization as a function of distance toward the right side regions , since the same results are observed with the color excess analysis ( which does not depend on the magnetic field configuration ) , revealing similar distances to the interstellar structures .",
    "these evidence confirm the distorted nature of the large - scale interface of the interstellar medium in the direction of loop i. besides , by analyzing specifically the a5 and a11 areas along the ring , we note a lower dust column density along these lines - of - sight ( see figures [ vecpol_integrated ] and [ pdist_ring ] ) which may be an indication of fragmentation of the suggested large - scale ring structure , or simply that such ring feature may not exist .",
    "the analysis of the polarization vectors orientation for different distance bands ( figure [ vecpol_intervals ] ) , reveals that on the @xmath66 pc and @xmath67 pc diagrams the polarization vectors along the right side direction do not present correlation with the ring contour orientation , in contrast to the situation observed at the left side , where the vectors run parallel to the ring contour . this relation between polarization vectors mean direction and the direction of the ring contour",
    "is further investigated on figure [ hist_ring ] , where we show histograms of the polarization angle ( @xmath68 ) to the same previously studied rectangular areas .",
    "these histograms only account for the polarized stars , i.e. , with @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "the dashed lines on the histograms indicate the direction of the ring contour along each studied area .    .",
    "the dashed lines on the histograms roughly indicate the direction of the contour along each specific area .",
    "polarization vectors are also plotted along the interface region at the center , as in figure [ vecpol_integrated ] .",
    "note that left and northern areas ( e.g. , a1 , a2 , a3 , and a4 ) show predominant vectors orientation parallel to the ring contour ( dashed lines ) , while at the right side and southern areas ( e.g. , a6 , a7 , a8 , and a9 ) the main vectors directions show no relation to the ring contour direction .",
    ", scaledwidth=80.0% ]    in fact , the histograms associated to the left - northern areas ( e.g. , a1-a4 ) show a good correlation between the ring contour direction and the main values of polarization direction , as indicated by the coincidence of the histogram peak and the dashed line , that indicates the ring contour orientation .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite pointed out that these lines - of - sight intercept several spherical  shells \" of interstellar material which are centered on the sub - groups of sco - cen and are most probably generated by stellar wind and sn explosion from these massive stars .",
    "furthermore , by analyzing the radio continuum maps ( @xmath71mhz ) by @xcite and the relation between the shells direction and the polarization vectors , @xcite proposed that this configuration could be created due to the distortion of the local magnetic field along constant  longitude \" lines on the surface of the expanding shells .",
    "in contrast , histograms related to the right side areas ( e.g. , a6 and a7 ) show that the predominant polarization direction is mainly uncorrelated to the ring contour direction , as indicated by the different position of the dashed line and the peak of the histogram .",
    "furthermore , the southern areas ( a8 , a9 , and a10 ) show a large polarization vectors dispersion , as suggested by the flat shape of the histogram .",
    "this could be related to the low polarization sky - projected component of the local magnetic field ( being viewed face - on ) or perhaps due to the presence of several interstellar sub - structures .",
    "in fact , @xcite reported the existence of a diffuse interstellar filament located in the direction of the a8 area at @xmath72 pc . a more detailed analysis of the polarization vectors in the direction of this filament suggest a clear relation with the morphology of such feature , with the polarization vectors positioned perpendicular to the direction of the filament .",
    "these results show that the behavior of the magnetic field direction in relation to the direction of the ring contour is markedly different between the left and right side regions .",
    "the existence ( or not ) of the interaction ring is closely related to the true nature of the lc .",
    "several models attempting to explain the origin of the lc have been proposed , and have been divided here in three main classes , as discussed below .",
    "on one side , the first class claims that the lc may have been created due to one or more sn explosions at the solar neighborhood a few million years ago , which would have swept the local neutral material and heated the interstellar gas up to @xmath73k @xcite . the hot gas would have generated a local component on the all - sky observed soft x - ray emission ( corresponding to the  hot local bubble \" ) .",
    "in fact , using data from the rosat survey ( @xmath10kev ) and assuming a constant emissivity of the plasma , @xcite and @xcite attempted to produce tridimensional maps of the hot local bubble .    on the other side ,",
    "a second class of models suggest that the lc would be a part of the nearby loop i superbubble , in a sense that different star forming epochs from the sco - cen ob association would have created different shock fronts , which expanded asymmetrically in the direction of the sun , i.e. , a low density region between the galaxy s spiral arms @xcite .",
    "@xcite argues further that this model is consistent with the view that two separate synchrotron emitting interstellar shells centered on different parts over the sco - cen association can reproduce large - scale structures revealed by recent radio polarization surveys , as proposed by @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the existence of a global flux of interstellar material at the solar neighborhood toward the opposite direction of loop i @xcite , i.e. , toward @xmath74 , supports the idea that some recent event may have caused the large - scale movement of the interstellar material driven away from sco - cen .",
    "a third class of models propose that the local cavity is not really a bubble in a sense that its origin is not associated to sn explosions , being actually an ordinary cavity ( the  local void \" ) in the local interstellar medium @xcite .",
    "the local cavity would be a low - density volume of space defined by several interacting shells , like loops i , ii , iii , and iv , the gum nebula , the orion - eridanus superbubble , among others .",
    "if the interaction ring really exists , the first class of models provides a suitable scenario , since the collisional models by @xcite would require both bubbles ( local and loop i ) to be expanding , and in addition , at least one of them should have reached the radiative stage of evolution prior to the interaction in order to generate the proposed annular dense region , as pointed out by @xcite .",
    "however , some issues have been recently presented regarding the idea that the lc would have been created by such supernovae explosions .",
    "specifically , recent studies revealed that a major part of the observed soft x - ray emission could be related to a much closer component , associated to the solar wind charge exchange effect at the heliosphere , which have not been properly accounted on the previous analysis @xcite .",
    "our data demonstrates that the classical concept of a unique bounding ring at the interaction area is misleading , in view of the largely discrepant distances between the different parts of the annular area , and also due to the widely different behavior of the magnetic field lines along the structure , which suggest that the left and right sides of the proposed ring are possibly uncorrelated .",
    "figure 3 from the work by @xcite shows a conceptual representation of the classical model attributed to the interaction ring .    instead of the scenario proposed by @xcite ,",
    "our data suggest that this structure is quite distorted and fragmented , unlike one would expect from a unique feature .",
    "however , this evidence does not refute the first class of models , it simply adds a new constraint to computational simulations which attempts to reproduce the characteristics of the lc and loop i through sn energy input . therefore , these models should account for the shape of the magnetic field lines , and reproduce the observed distortion along the interface area .    on the other hand , the second and third types of model do not require the existence of an interaction ring , since the occurrence of sn explosions inside the lc are not considered .",
    "particularly , the model provided by @xcite allow the shape of magnetic field lines to be tested by using polarimetric data , similar to what has been accomplished by @xcite . according to this scenery , loop",
    "i is conceived as consisting of two synchrotron - emitting shells ( namely s1 and s2 ) , that reproduces the large - scale magnetic field structure as revealed by polarimetric radio continuum surveys . as an illustration of this model , figure [ fig_wolleben ] shows the projected positions of both shells along with the optical polarimetric data distribution from this work .        from the point of view of our results ,",
    "the advantage of such model is that it does nt require the existence of an interaction ring between the lc and loop i. however , it is important to point out that , referring to figure [ fig_wolleben ] , it is possibly misleading to perform a direct comparison of the shells _ positions _ with the vectors direction . instead , a valid analysis would demand a rigorous comparison between the polarization vectors and the _ summed projected magnetic field lines _ , derived by @xcite , along all distances and directions .",
    "this means that the interweaving magnetic field lines related to the s1 and s2 shells should be projected in the plane - of - sky and thereafter vectorially summed along each line - of - sight , similar to what has been discussed at the appendix from @xcite ( where the integrated q and u stokes parameters were computed based on the magnetic field structure ) .",
    "although there exist some correlations of the polarization vectors direction with respect to the shells positions ( especially toward e1 and e2 areas @xmath75 the north polar spur @xmath75 when compared to the left side of the s2 shell ) , such effect may be possible only when the projected magnetic field follows the direction of the shell s border , which is not true in general , considering the projections and the combined effect of both shells .",
    "therefore , it is soon to assert if this is an adequate model , and it would also be expected to reproduce the observed gas and dust column densities in the lines - of - sight of the loop i shells .",
    "we have carried out a polarimetric survey of @xmath0 hipparcos stars in the general direction of the loop i superbubble s interface with the lc .",
    "our sample was complemented with the data from @xcite catalogue .",
    "the main results of the analysis are summarized below :    * along the ring structure proposed by @xcite , the left side rise from @xmath76 to @xmath58 , which correspond to the ring s column density , occurs at @xmath59 pc , while at the right side regions the same transition occurs only beyond @xmath60 pc .",
    "this trend corroborates the color excess analysis by @xcite ; * a gradual decrease in the polarization values is observed in the left - right direction along the contour of the interaction ring ; * the analysis of the polarization vectors direction along the interface revealed that along the right side the predominant direction of the vectors do not present correlation with the direction of the ring contour , in contrast to the situation observed at the left side , where the vectors run parallel to the ring structure .",
    "altogether , these evidence confirm the distorted nature of the interstellar interface between the lc and loop i. the low polarization values toward some areas along the interaction ring suggest that , if it really exists , it is probably highly fragmented and twisted . however , the configuration of the sky - projected component of magnetic field in relation to the direction of the ring contour reveals markedly different behavior in the left and right sides .",
    "this fact casts some doubt on the existence of the ring - like structure as a unique large - scale feature .",
    "our methods were mainly the analysis based on the distances to the interstellar structures and the shape of magnetic field lines along the interface .",
    "these studies were used in a qualitative comparison with the existent models for the local interstellar medium . the existence ( or not ) of the ring is closely related to the true nature and associated origin models of the local cavity , and shall deserve a particularly special attention .",
    "the authors are grateful to the anonymous referee for the enlightening suggestions which greatly improved the paper .",
    "the authors are also thankful to fapemig ( grant apq 00154/08 ) and cnpq ( 131925/2007 - 5 ) , which provided financial support to the accomplishment of this research .",
