    "the primary hard x - ray continuum in seyfert galaxies arises from repeated compton up - scattering of uv / soft x - ray accretion disk photons in a hot , trans - relativistic plasma .",
    "this process results in a power - law spectrum extending to energies determined by the electron temperature in the hot `` corona '' ( for a detailed discussion , see @xcite ) .",
    "the power - law index is a function of the plasma temperature , @xmath7 , and optical depth , @xmath8 .",
    "this scenario describes the hard x - ray / soft @xmath9-ray spectra of bright seyferts reasonably well ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "there are few physical constraints on the nature of the corona .",
    "broad - band uv / x - ray spectra require that it not fully cover the disk , and suggest it is probably patchy @xcite .",

    "eclipses of the x - ray source have also placed constraints on the size of the hard x - ray emitting region(s ) : @xmath13 ( e.g. , @xcite )",
    ".    however , the coronal temperature and optical depth remain poorly constrained due to the lack of high - quality x - ray measurements extending above @xmath14 . complex spectral components , including reflection from the accretion disk as well as from distant matter , contribute to the @xmath15 spectrum , and constraints from previous observations suggest typical cutoff energies are @xmath16 , requiring spectra extending above @xmath17 for good constraints .",
    "the _ nustar _ high energy focusing x - ray telescope @xcite , which covers the band from @xmath2 with unprecedented sensitivity , provides the capability to measure both the compton reflection component from neutral material and to constrain the continuum cutoffs in bright systems .",
    "the nearby seyfert galaxy ic  4329a ( @xmath18 , @xcite ; galactic @xmath19 , @xcite ; @xmath20 , @xcite ) is a good candidate for such measurements . with a @xmath21 flux range of @xmath22 @xcite ,",
    "ic  4329a is one of the brightest seyferts . in the hard x - ray / soft @xmath9-ray band it appears similar to an average radio - quiet seyfert ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "a compton reflection component and strong fe k@xmath23 line @xcite are both present .",

    "_ @xcite , which placed rough constraints on the high - energy coronal cutoff at @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively . combining _",
    "integral _ and _ xmm - newton _ data further constrained the cutoff energy to @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "the soft x - ray spectrum is absorbed by a combination of neutral and partially ionized gas , with a total column of @xmath28 @xcite , comparable to the host galaxy s ism column density @xcite .",
    "after accounting for the reflection component , the intrinsic spectral variability is modest @xcite .",
    "we report here on the _ nustar _ portion of our simultaneous _",
    "nustar+suzaku _ observation of ic  4329a . the combined _",
    "nustar+suzaku _ analysis will be described in a forthcoming paper ( brenneman , in prep . ) . in  2 , we report on the _ nustar _ observations .",
    "our spectral analysis follows in  3 , with a discussion of the coronal properties and their implications in  4 .",
    "ic  4329a was observed by _ nustar _ quasi - continuously from august 12 - 16 , 2012 . after eliminating earth occultations , passages through the south atlantic anomaly ( saa ) and other periods of high background , the _ nustar _",
    "observation totaled @xmath29 of on - source time for focal plane module a ( fpma ) and @xmath30 for fpmb .",
    "the total counts after background subtraction in the @xmath2 band were @xmath31 and @xmath32 for each instrument , yielding signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratios of @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively .",
    "the _ nustar _ data were collected with the fpma and fpmb optical axes placed roughly @xmath35 arcmin from the nucleus of ic  4329a .",
    "we reduced the data using the _ nustar _ data analysis software ( nustardas ) and calibration version 1.1.1 .",
    "we filtered the event files and applied the default depth correction using the nupipeline task .",
    "we used circular extraction regions @xmath36 arcsec in radius for the source and background , with the source region centered on ic  4329a and the background taken from the corner of the same detector , as close as possible to the source without being contaminated by the psf wings .",
    "spectra , images and light curves were extracted and response files were generated using the nuproducts task . in order to minimize systematic effects , we have not combined responses or spectra from fpma and fpmb , but instead fit them simultaneously .",
    "we allow the absolute normalization for both modules to vary , and we find a cross - calibration factor of @xmath37 for fpmb relative to fpma .    for all the analysis we used xspec version 12.8.1 , along with other ftools packages within heasoft 6.14 .",
    "all errors in the text are 1@xmath38 confidence within the text unless otherwise specified , while the final parameter values and their uncertainties are quoted in table  [ tab : tab1 ] at @xmath39 confidence .",
    "ic  4329a demonstrated a modest , secular flux evolution during our observation , increasing by @xmath40 over the first @xmath41 of the observation ( using clock time ) , plateauing at maximum flux for @xmath42 then decreasing by @xmath43 over the remainder of the observation . on average ,",
    "the flux we measure , @xmath44 , is within its historical range of values . given the lack of short term variability and modest flux evolution we use the time - averaged spectrum for all spectral analysis (  [ sec : spectral ] ) .",
    "the focus of this paper is the characterization of the primary high - energy continuum in ic  4329a , and we therefore restrict our analysis to @xmath45 to avoid the effects of low - energy absorption which are poorly constrained by _ nustar _ alone .",
    "we assess the contributions of distant reflection from the outer disk and/or torus , although we defer a detailed discussion of the distant and inner disk reflection to a forthcoming paper ( brenneman , in prep . ) .",
    "we first consider a phenomenological model for the _ nustar _ spectra to generally investigate the prominence of the high - energy cutoff .",
    "we begin by evaluating the @xmath45 data against the pexmon model @xcite , which incorporates both primary emission ( in the form of a power - law with an exponential cutoff ) and distant reflection .",
    "pexmon is based on the pexrav model of @xcite , but in addition to the reprocessed continuum emission it also includes the fluorescent emission lines expected to accompany the compton reflection ( fe k@xmath23 , fe k@xmath46 , ni k@xmath23 and the fe k@xmath23 compton shoulder ) .",
    "fitting the @xmath45 data using pexmon with no exponential cutoff or reflection ( @xmath47 and @xmath48 ) yields a goodness - of - fit of @xmath49 , with clear residuals remaining in the fe k band ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] , top ) .",
    "the power - law has a slope of @xmath50 .",
    "the spectrum has a pronounced convex shape characteristic of both compton reflection and a high - energy cutoff above @xmath51 .    allowing the reflection component to fit freely ,",
    "we get @xmath52 ( negative because of the way reflection is parameterized within the model ; the absolute value is the real reflection fraction ) with @xmath53 , for @xmath54 .",
    "clear residual curvature above @xmath55 remains ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] , middle ) . also freeing the cutoff energy of the primary continuum yields @xmath56 with @xmath57 and @xmath58 with @xmath59 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] , bottom ) .",
    "it is clear that both compton reflection and a high - energy cutoff are required : the improvement in fit of @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) upon addition of a high - energy cutoff is highly significant .    freeing the iron abundance ( while keeping the abundances of other elements fixed to their solar values ) improves the fit only slightly to @xmath62 , with fe / solar@xmath63 , though the uncertainties on the other parameters increase slightly as a result . allowing the inclination angle of the reflector to fit freely yields no constraints on the parameter and no further improvement in fit , so we have elected to keep it fixed at @xmath64 .",
    "we note that when the pexmon component is replaced with the more common model of pexrav plus gaussian emission lines , the fit yields similar values of @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67",
    ".    residuals still remain in the fe k band , suggesting the presence of an underlying broad component of the fe k@xmath23 line .",
    "when this feature is modeled with a gaussian ( @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 ) , the goodness - of - fit improves to @xmath71 . including this component also lowers the iron abundance to fe / solar@xmath72 .",

    "we employ the compps model of @xcite , which produces the continuum through inverse compton scattering of thermal disk photons off of relativistic electrons situated above the disk in a choice of geometries .",
    "the disk photons and coronal plasma are each parametrized by a single temperature .",
    "it then reflects the continuum x - rays off of a slab of gas ( the disk or torus ) to produce reprocessed continuum emission self - consistently by internally linking with the pexrav model .",
    "reprocessed line emission is not included .",
    "we fix the energy of the thermal disk photons to @xmath73 , appropriate for a black hole of @xmath74 @xcite .",
    "we initially fix the geometry of the hot electrons to be spherical with a maxwellian distribution , the former choice being based on the coronal compactness measurements cited in  1 ( e.g. , @xcite ) , although we also compare the results with a slab geometry .",
    "we fit for the electron energy ( @xmath75 ) and coronal optical depth ( @xmath8 ) , as well as for the reflection fraction ( @xmath66 ) of the reprocessing gas , and model normalization ( @xmath76 ) .",
    "we add in separate gaussian components to represent the fe k@xmath23 ( narrow and broad ) and k@xmath46 line emission resulting from reflection in order to maintain consistency with the pexmon model employed in  [ sec : phenom ] above .",
    "this approach yields approximately the same global goodness - of - fit as model  1 : @xmath77 , with parameter values of @xmath78 ( assuming that @xmath79 , as per @xcite , this is equivalent to a cutoff energy of approximately @xmath80 , consistent with that measured in model  1 ) , @xmath81 and @xmath82 , assuming a distant , neutral reflector inclined at @xmath83 to the line of sight .",
    "we note that the iron abundance is not constrained by the model .",
    "the narrow gaussian components representing narrow fe k@xmath23 and k@xmath46 have equivalent widths of @xmath84 and @xmath85 , respectively .",
    "the addition of these components improves the global goodness - of - fit by @xmath86 and @xmath87 , respectively , each for three additional degrees of freedom .",
    "we also note that consistent results are achieved ( within errors ) when we fit for the compton - y parameter rather than the optical depth , as per the approach taken in @xcite : @xmath88 and @xmath89 , resulting in @xmath90 .",
    "in addition to having larger parameter uncertainties , however , this approach also results in an unconstrained reflection fraction .",
    "consistent results are obtained when we fix the reflection fraction at @xmath91 ( as described in the previous paragraph ) and fe / solar@xmath92 : @xmath93 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 . however , in light of the importance of probing the reflection as a free parameter , we have elected to fit for the optical depth explicitly in the model .",
    "we consider a slab geometry for the corona as well , again with a maxwellian electron distribution .",
    "this results in no significant improvement to the fit : @xmath96 , with @xmath97 ( equivalent to a cutoff energy of @xmath98 , also consistent with that  measured in model  1 ) , @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "this model is also insensitive to the fe abundance .",
    "the equivalent widths of the gaussian lines are the same as for the spherical geometry , within errors .",
    "for both geometries the electron plasma temperature is constant within errors , while the optical depth is pushing the upper limit of its sensible parameter space .",
    "we therefore check the compps results using the comptt model @xcite , which assumes a simpler thermal electron distribution and does not self - consistently include the compton reflection continuum . we add in reflection from distant matter using the pexmon model .",
    "we assume an incident power - law photon index of @xmath101 ( fixed ) , as found in model  1 , and tie the normalization of the reflected emission to that of the comptonized component , such that the contribution of the reflector relative to the comptonization is entirely determined by @xmath66 and the iron abundance .",
    "we checked the models to ensure a tight match between the shapes of a power - law of this index and the shape of the comptt component .",
    "we also fix the cutoff energy of the incident power - law at @xmath102 . the spherical geometry comptt component model and the same model with a slab geometry",
    "are referred to hereafter as models  2 - 3 , respectively .",
    "we find values for the coronal temperature consistent within errors with those of compps for both the spherical and slab geometries : @xmath103 and @xmath104 , respectively .",
    "the coronal optical depth in the slab geometry is slightly smaller with comptt vs. compps , though consistent within errors : @xmath105 . for the spherical geometry , @xmath106 , also consistent with its compps analog within errors .",
    "the reflection fraction measured with this model ( defined in the same way for both geometries ) is comparable to that determined by compps : @xmath107 for the sphere and @xmath108 for the slab .",
    "the iron abundance is comparable that that found in model  1 : fe / solar@xmath109 ( sphere ) and fe / solar@xmath110 ( slab ) .",

    "prior measurements provided constraints on the cutoff energy of the power - law at @xmath122 @xcite , @xmath123 @xcite and @xmath26 @xcite , though @xcite did achieve a more precise constraint of @xmath124 using _ xmm _ in tandem with _ integral_. the two datasets were not taken simultaneously , however , and the s / n achieved by the _ nustar _",

    "the models parametrize the temperature , and optical depth of the electron plasma for two coronal geometries ; a sphere and a slab .",
    "both geometries fit the data equally well , though we note that the sphere model provides tighter constraints on its parameters .",
    "both models also produce consistent values for the electron temperature within errors .",
    "however , they result in slightly different values for the optical depth : @xmath3 with @xmath4 for the slab geometry , compared with @xmath5 with @xmath6 for the spherical geometry ( both at @xmath39 confidence ) .",
    "this discrepancy in optical depth is due primarily to the way that the value is calculated for a given geometry within the comptonization models we employ ( e.g. , @xcite ) : the optical depth for a slab geometry is taken vertically , whereas that for a sphere is taken radially and thus incorporates an extra factor of @xmath125 . taking this extra factor into account , the optical depth of the spherical case can be translated into the slab geometry for ease of comparison : @xmath126 for the sphere vs. @xmath4 for the slab .",
    "though these values do not formally agree within their @xmath39 confidence errors , they are compatible at the @xmath127 level .",
    "the derived electron temperatures for the sphere and slab coronal geometries are low compared to @xmath128 , but are not far off from @xmath129 , which is consistent with the corona having significant optical depth ( i.e. , @xmath130 ) , modulo uncertainties in geometry , seed photons , outflows , anisotropy , etc . which we are not able to probe even with our high - s / n data .",
    "due to an inherent modeling degeneracy between the optical depth and temperature of the electron plasma in each geometry , there is a small , linearly correlated range of values for these parameters which demonstrate approximately equal statistical fit quality , as can be seen in figs .",
    "[ fig : fig3]-[fig : fig4 ] . nonetheless , we constrain both parameters precisely and accurately with the best data ever achieved over this energy band",
    ". the data quality and goodness - of - fit of the comptonization models gives us confidence in the temperatures and optical depths we have measured .",
    "we note , however , that without high - s / n data at energies @xmath131 we are unable to discriminate between a thermal and non - thermal population of coronal electrons ( e.g. , with a model such as eqpair , @xcite ) .",
    "a significant non - thermal contribution could change the temperatures and optical depths that we measure .    with our robust determination of the continuum shape over the broad energy range",
    ", we estimate that the power dissipated in the corona , in the form of the power - law continuum , is @xmath132 of the total luminosity of the entire system from @xmath45 ( the power - law has a luminosity of @xmath133 ) .",
    "this represents @xmath134 of the bolometric luminosity of the source ( @xmath135 ; @xcite ) .",
    "given that ic  4329a is a radio - quiet agn ( total 10 mhz - 100 ghz @xmath136 ; @xcite ) , we do not expect a significant portion of the x - rays to come from a jet component , so we may infer that the remaining @xmath137 of the @xmath45 emission represents the contribution from reflection .",
    "our spectral fitting results are broadly consistent with the signatures expected from dynamic , outflowing coronae as defined by @xcite and @xcite : a hard spectral index and relatively weak reflection . if the corona is really powered by compact magnetic flares that are dominated by @xmath138 pairs , the resulting plasma is subject to radiation pressure from the photons moving outwards from the disk .",
    "the bulk velocity at which the plasma should be outflowing from the disk , given our model  1 photon index of @xmath101 , is @xmath139 , according to @xcite .",
    "our measured reflection fraction of @xmath140 is also consistent with that predicted by @xcite for a comptonizing plasma with these parameters .",
