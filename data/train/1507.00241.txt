    "according to the ability to conduct electric currents , materials can usually be classified into insulators and metals .",
    "recently , researchers discovered a new class of materials , of which their interior can not conduct electric currents , similar to insulators , but their surfaces have conducting channels .",
    "although the surface states can also exist in ordinary insulators , the uniqueness of this class of materials lies in the fact that the existence of surface states is related to its bulk property , which can be described by the mathematical theory , topology .",
    "thus , these materials are dubbed `` topological insulators ( tis ) '' @xcite .",
    "the quantum hall effect @xcite , discovered in 1980 , can be viewed as the first example of topologically non - trivial states . under a strong magnetic field ,",
    "two - dimensional ( 2d ) electron gases form landau levels and get localized , while at the edge , there are gapless conducting modes propagating along one direction , known as the `` chiral edge state . ''",
    "a recent progress in this field is the discovery of time - reversal ( tr ) invariant tis @xcite , of which the gapless edge / surface states are protected by tr symmetry .",
    "different from the chiral edge states in the quantum hall effect , the edge / surface states of tr invariant tis contain two counter - propagating modes with opposite spins , thus dubbed `` helical edge / surface states . ''",
    "two branches of helical edge / surface states are related to each other by tr symmetry , forming the kramers pairs . according to the kramers theorem",
    ", the energy of one branch at the momentum @xmath16 must be the same as that of the other branch at @xmath17 .",
    "therefore , at the momenta invariant under tr , such as @xmath18 , two branches of surface states are degenerate and form a dirac - cone - like energy dispersion .",
    "tr invariant tis have been confirmed in various materials , such as hgte quantum wells @xcite , bisb @xcite , bi@xmath19se@xmath20 family of materials @xcite , etc.@xcite , by different experimental methods , including angular - resolved photon emission spectroscopy ( arpes ) @xcite , scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) @xcite , and transport measurements @xcite .",
    "since the topologically non - trivial edge / surface states require the protection from tr symmetry , these systems are also regarded as symmetry - protected topological states @xcite in free - fermions systems .",
    "based on the above discussion , we can see that degeneracy due to symmetry plays an essential role in topological states of free - fermion systems that are protected by symmetry .",
    "it is well known that in crystals , there are different types of degeneracy , including accidental degeneracy and essential degeneracy .",
    "the essential degeneracy arises from the presence of certain symmetries and is related to the representation theory of symmetry groups .",
    "therefore , one may ask the following questions : ( 1 ) whether or not the concept of tr invariant tis can be generalized to other types of symmetries , leading to new classes of topological states ; and ( 2 ) if one can use representation theory to classify topological states that are protected by other types of symmetries .",
    "it was recently realized that crystalline symmetry can indeed protect new types of topological states , which are dubbed `` topological crystalline insulators ( tcis ) '' @xcite . in particular ,",
    "snte systems are found to be a mirror - symmetry - protected topological state , which has recently been confirmed by the arpes measurement @xcite .",
    "various physical properties , including mass acquisition @xcite , unconventional orbital texture @xcite , spin - filtered edge states @xcite , quasi - particle interference @xcite , and interface superconductivity @xcite , have been considered .    in this paper , we will systematically study different types of tcis based on the representation theory of crystalline symmetry groups . instead of directly studying three - dimensional ( 3d ) bulk system",
    ", we consider a 3d semi - infinite system with one surface and investigate non - trivial gapless surface states which can not be gapped once the crystalline symmetry is preserved .",
    "since a 3d semi - infinite crystal is classified by 2d space group , this approach allows us to classify different types of non - trivial surface states based on the representation theory of 2d space group . after classifying 2d topologically non - trivial surface states , we can further investigate topological property of the 3d bulk system and identify the corresponding 3d bulk topological invariants .",
    "the details of our approach will be discussed in the following , but we would like first to illustrate our main results .",
    "our main results are summarized in table  [ tab1 ] for 17 2d space groups .",
    "the first column of the table is the group name and the second column gives the shape of 2d surface brillouin zone ( bz ) , in which `` re '' is for rectanglar , `` h '' for hexagonal , `` rh '' for rhombic , and `` s '' for square .",
    "different 2d surface bzs are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "the next two columns list high symmetry momentum points ( hsps ) and high symmetry momentum lines ( hsls ) , which are essential for determining topologically non - trivial surface states .",
    "topological classifications of tcis for the spinless and spinful cases are shown in the last two columns . here",
    "the symbols @xmath9 and @xmath21 indicate whether the space of ground states for the insulating phases are partitioned into topological sectors labeled by an integer or a @xmath21 quantity , respectively .",
    "@xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) means that we can define @xmath24 different integer topological invariants .",
    "we would like to emphasize that for several space groups , including @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath14 , @xmath7 and @xmath15 , the classification depends on which irreducible representations ( irreps ) of the states near the band gap belong to .",
    "therefore , for these cases , we list the required condition of irreps in the bracket after the classification .",
    "below , we will discuss our results of tcis for 17 2d space groups in several categories .",
    "\\(1 ) for the groups @xmath0 , @xmath11 and @xmath10 ( sec .",
    "[ sec : pm ] ) , we have integer number of copies of topologically non - trivial surface states , which are characterized by mirror chern numbers ( mcns ) , belonging to a @xmath9 classification , for both the spinless and spinful cases .",
    "two independent mcns ( @xmath8 ) can be defined for the @xmath0 group , but only one can be defined for the @xmath11 and @xmath10 groups .",
    "\\(2 ) for the groups @xmath1 and @xmath12 ( sec .",
    "[ sec : pmm ] ) , mcns are not allowed for the spinless case .",
    "in contrast , four ( two ) independent mcns can be defined for the spinful case of @xmath1 ( @xmath12 ) group , leading to a @xmath13 ( @xmath8 ) classification .",
    "\\(4 ) for the @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 ( sec .",
    "[ sec : p4 m ] ) , the classification depends on the irreps of the states near the fermi energy , and we need to illustrate the classification for each group separately . for the spinless case of the @xmath3 group , when all the states at @xmath25 and @xmath26 belong to the doublet ( or 2d ) irrep ,",
    "we can define two integer topological invariants ( halved mirror chirality ( hmc ) ) , giving rise to @xmath8 classification .",
    "however , if any state at @xmath25 or @xmath26 belongs to one - dimensional ( 1d ) irreps , no topological invariant can be defined . for the spinful case of the @xmath3 group ,",
    "three topological invariants of hmc type ( @xmath27 ) can be defined , irrespective of any condition . for the @xmath4 group ,",
    "there are three hsps @xmath25 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 with the point group @xmath30 and three hsls with mirror symmetry .",
    "when the states at @xmath24 hsps ( @xmath31 ) belong to doublet irreps , the topological classification is @xmath22 with @xmath24 distinct hmcs for both the spinful and spinless cases .",
    "if there is only one hsp or no hsp with the states in doublet irreps , one mcn ( @xmath9 ) can be defined .",
    "for the @xmath5 group , we also have three hsps , in which @xmath25 belongs to the @xmath32 group , @xmath28 to the @xmath30 group , and @xmath26 to the @xmath33 group , and also three hsls with mirror symmetry . for the spinless case , there are two doublet irreps at @xmath25 and one doublet irrep at @xmath28 .",
    "one hmc ( @xmath9 classification ) can be defined when all the states at @xmath25 and @xmath28 belong to doublet irreps .",
    "the @xmath33 group at @xmath26 has four 1d irreps @xmath34 and @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "please refer to table .",
    "[ tab:2 ] for the definition of @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the characters of the mirror symmetry @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the same in irreps @xmath34 , while opposite in irreps @xmath35 .",
    "the topological classification on @xmath25-@xmath26-@xmath28 depends on the irreps of the bands near the fermi surface at @xmath26 .",
    "if all the states at @xmath26 belong to @xmath34 ( or @xmath35 ) , another hmc can be defined on @xmath25-@xmath26-@xmath28 . a detailed discussion about representation dependent classification is given in section .",
    "[ sec : pmg ] . for the spinful case ,",
    "all the states at @xmath25 and @xmath26 belong to the doublet irrep , while both doublet and singlet irreps are possible for the states at @xmath28 .",
    "thus , three independent hmcs ( @xmath27 ) can be defined on @xmath25-@xmath28 , @xmath28-@xmath26 , and @xmath26-@xmath25 if the states at @xmath28 belong to doublet irreps . otherwise , there are two hmcs that can be defined on @xmath25-@xmath26 and @xmath25-@xmath28-@xmath26 .",
    "\\(5 ) for three non - symmorphic symmetry groups @xmath7 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 ( sec .  [ sec : pmg ] ) , the classification also depends on irreps at the hsps @xmath25 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath26 . for the spinless case of the @xmath14 group ,",
    "all the states at @xmath39 and @xmath40 are doubly degenerate ( doublet irreps ) .",
    "the classification depends on 1d irreps at @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "there are four types of different 1d irreps at @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) , denoted as @xmath34 and @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "if all the states at @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) belong to the @xmath34 or @xmath35 irreps , one integer topological invariant ( @xmath9 classification ) , dubbed halved glide chirality ( hgc ) , in analogy to hmc , can be defined along the hsl @xmath39-@xmath25-@xmath40 ( @xmath39-@xmath26-@xmath40 ) . if both the @xmath34 and @xmath35 states exist at @xmath25 and @xmath26 near the band gap , one can no longer define hgc along these momentum lines .",
    "however , a @xmath21 topological invariant can still be defined .",
    "for the spinful case , the classification is similar to that of the spinless case .",
    "the only difference is that now all the states at @xmath25 and @xmath26 are doubly degenerate and it depends on the 1d irreps at @xmath39 and @xmath40 if a @xmath21 or @xmath9 topological invariant can be defined along the momentum line @xmath25-@xmath39-@xmath26 ( @xmath25-@xmath40-@xmath26 ) . for the @xmath7 group , all the states at @xmath39 and @xmath26 are doubly degenerate , and thus a hmc",
