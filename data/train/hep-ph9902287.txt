    "as shown in @xcite , in order to calculate the higgs boson mass up to the next - to - leading logarithm approximation , we must consider the one - loop ep improved by two - loop rge for the @xmath3 and @xmath4 functions of the running coupling constants , masses and the @xmath5 field for the higgs boson @xcite .",

    "in addition , @xmath16 and @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a fixed scale .",
    "starting with the above expression for the sm(3,4 ) ep , one may follow the analysis in @xcite and obtain the expression for the higgs boson mass :    @xmath19    where the three generation case is obtained by simply letting the fourth generation yukawa couplings go to zero .    following the method similar of kodaira et al .",

    "@xmath22 is found to satisify : @xmath24 we then evaluate the first and second derivatives of the ep at the scale @xmath22 where @xmath25 . in the above relation satisfied by @xmath22 , @xmath26 is a fixed , constant mass scale . in the mssm theories , we will take @xmath26 to be @xmath27 or 10 tev , while the sm lower bounds will be derived after choosing @xmath28 gev .",
    "we define the running higgs mass as : @xmath29 the physical , pole masses are related to the running masses via the following equations : @xmath30 m_{i}(m_{i})\\ ] ] @xmath31 where @xmath32 = 0 for i = ( n , e ) and = 1 for i = ( t , t , b ) .",
    "@xmath33 is the renormalized electroweak self - energy of the higgs boson .",
    "the method of solving the rge and the appropriate boundary conditions for the couplings is explained in @xcite . in this update ,",
    "we use @xmath34 gev and @xmath35 .",
    "let us first discuss the procedure for determining a lower bound on the higgs boson mass in the sm @xcite working with the two - loop rge requires the imposition of one - loop boundary conditions on the running parameters . as pointed out by casas et al .",
    "@xcite , the necessary condition for vacuum stability is derived from requiring that the effective coupling @xmath36 0 rather than @xmath37 for @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the cut - off beyond which the sm is no longer valid .",

    "gev increases the lower bound on @xmath0 to @xmath45 150 gev .    to compute the mssm upper bound on @xmath0 , we assume that all of the sparticles have masses @xmath47 or greater and that of the two higgs isodoublets of the mssm , one linear combination is massive , also with a mass of @xmath47 or greater , while the other linear combination , orthogonal to the first , has a mass of the order of weak - scale symmetry breaking . with these two assumptions ,",
    "it is clear that below the supersymmetry breaking scale @xmath48 , the effective theory is the sm .",
    "this fact enables us to use the sm effective potential for the higgs boson when we treat the lightest higgs boson in the mssm .    in the mssm(3,4 ) , the boundary condition for @xmath1 at @xmath48 is @xmath49\\cos^{2}(2\\beta)+\\frac{\\kappa_{i}h_{i}^{4}(m_{susy})}{16 \\pi^{2}}\\left ( 2\\frac{x_{i}}{m_{susy}^{2}}-\\frac{x_{i}^{4}}{6 m_{susy}^{4 } } \\right)\\ ] ] where @xmath50 = 3 for @xmath11 and @xmath50 = 1 for @xmath13 and @xmath51 is the supersymmetric mixing parameter for the ith fermion .",

    "( 1 ) we present our numerical two - loop results for the lightest higgs boson mass bounds in the sm and the mssm3 as a function of the supersymmetric parameter @xmath53 .",
    "the bottom two curves correspond to the mssm3 upper bound for the two cases @xmath43 gev and the slightly greater upper bound that results when @xmath46 = 179 gev and with no threshold corrections .",
    "when the case of maximum threshold corrections is considered , these two curves are translated upwards by @xmath45 55 gev - 60 gev , illustrating the strong dependence of the upper bound on the precise value of the threshold corrections .",
    "yet even with such a dramatic increase in the upper bounds with increasing threshold corrections , we observe that the sm lower bound exceeds the mssm upper bound for @xmath43 gev and @xmath54 for all values of the threshold correction contribution . similarly , for @xmath55 gev , the troublesome situation is only exacerbated , as the sm lower bound exceeds the mssm upper bound for @xmath56 independent of the threshold corrections .",
    "in fig.(2 ) we present the problem more clearly . taking into account the present experimental lower limit on @xmath0 of @xmath45 90 gev at 95@xmath57 cl",
    ", we find the value of the threshold correction that gives a smallest upper bound consistent with the experimental lower limit .",
    "clearly , for this phenomenologically determined lower limit of the threshold contributions , there is a large area in @xmath58 space that is inconsistent with both the sm and the mssm . for @xmath43 gev , the region 92 gev",
    "@xmath59 134 gev invalidates both theories independent of @xmath53 , while for @xmath55 gev , the range of mutual invalidiation is 92 gev @xmath59 150 gev .",
    "to resolve the above conundrum , one would like to either raise the mssm upper bounds , lower the sm lower bounds , or both . adding more massive fermions to the theory only increases both bounds , so it is readily apparent that the way out of the area of inconsistency is to consider the mssm4 and see if the additional matter of the mssm4 results in mssm4 upper bounds that exceed the sm3 lower bounds .",
    "we now discuss restrictions on the possible fourth generation fermion masses @xcite . the close agreement betweeen the direct measurements of the top quark at the tevatron and its indirect determination from the global fits of precision electroweak data including radiative corrections within the framework of the sm",
    "imply that there is no significant violation of the isospin symmetry for the extra generation .",
    "thus the masses of the fourth generation isopartners must be very close to degenerate @xcite ; i.e. @xmath60 recently , the limit on the masses of the extra neutral and charged lepton masses , @xmath61 and @xmath62 , has been improved by lep1.5 to @xmath63 gev and @xmath64 gev .",
    "also , cdf has yielded a lower bound on @xmath65 of @xmath45 140 gev .    in our previous work",
    ", we considered a completely degenerate fourth generation of fermions with mass @xmath66 .",
    "we derived an upper bound on @xmath66 in the mssm4 by demanding pertubative validity of all the couplings out to the gut scale @xcite .",
    "this constraint led to an upper bound on @xmath66 of @xmath45 110 gev .",
    "the above experimental lower limit on @xmath65 naturally forces us to now a consider a fourth generation where degeneracy only holds among the isodoublets seperately .",
    "we therefore consider a fourth generation with masses @xmath2 and @xmath67 .    in fig.(3 )",
    ", we present the sm lower bound , the mssm4 upper bound with the fourth generation masses at their experimental lower limits and with fourth generation masses large enough to remove the problem area for all values of @xmath53 .",
    "the mssm bounds were calculated with no threshold corrections , and @xmath46 is fixed at 172 gev .",
    "fig.(4 ) shows the same information for @xmath46 = 179 gev .",
    "the mssm4 upper bounds are much more sensitive to @xmath67 than they are to @xmath2 .",
    "this qualitative behaviour is readily understood from inspection of the equation for @xmath68 .",
    "for this reason , it is necessary to increase @xmath67 appropriately in order to generate a mssm4 upper bound that is greater than the sm lower bound for all values of @xmath53 . in fact , keeping @xmath67 at 146 gev and allowing @xmath2 to be 110 gev does not resolve the problem . but increasing both @xmath67 and @xmath2 as indicated in the figures does remove the problem . because all of the bounds increase as @xmath2 and @xmath67 increase , and because the upper bounds on @xmath66 from the previous work are saturated when the masses of the fourth generation reach some critical values from below , we can conclude that @xmath2 must still be @xmath69 gev .",
    "this conclusion follows because it is @xmath70 that violates pertubative validity , so in the non - degenerate case , it is @xmath2 that must still respect this upper bound if gauge coupling unification is still to be achieved in the mssm4 .",
