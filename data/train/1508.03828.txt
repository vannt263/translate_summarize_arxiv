    "a data set consisting of @xmath0 univariate points is usually ranked in ascending or descending order .",
    "univariate order statistics ( i.e. , the ` @xmath1th smallest value out of @xmath0 ' ) and derived quantities have been studied extensively .",
    "the median is defined as the order statistic of rank @xmath2 when @xmath0 is odd , and as the average of the order statistics of ranks @xmath3 and @xmath4 when @xmath0 is even .",
    "the median and any other order statistic of a univariate data set can be computed in @xmath5 time .",
    "generalization to higher dimensions is , however , not straightforward .",
    "alternatively , univariate points may be ranked from the outside inward by assigning the most extreme data points depth 1 , the second smallest and second largest data points depth 2 , etc .",
    "the deepest point then equals the usual median of the sample .",
    "the advantage of this type of ranking is that it can be extended to higher dimensions more easily .",
    "this section gives an overview of several possible generalizations of depth and the median to multivariate settings .",
    "surveys of statistical applications of multivariate data depth may be found in  @xcite , @xcite , and  @xcite .",
    "let @xmath6 be a finite set of data points in @xmath7 .",
    "the _ tukey depth _ or _ halfspace depth _ ( introduced by  @xcite and further developed by  @xcite ) of any point @xmath8 in @xmath7 ( not necessarily a data point ) determines how central the point is inside the data cloud .",
    "the halfspace depth of @xmath8 is defined as the minimal number of data points in any closed halfspace determined by a hyperplane through @xmath8 : @xmath9 thus , a point lying outside the convex hull of @xmath10 has depth @xmath11 , and any data point has depth at least 1 .",
    "figure  [ fig : ldep ] illustrates this definition for @xmath12 .",
    "( which is not a data point itself ) has depth 1 because the halfspace determined by @xmath13 contains only one data point.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    the set of all points with depth @xmath14 is called the @xmath1th depth region @xmath15 .",
    "the halfspace depth regions form a sequence of nested polyhedra .",
    "each @xmath15 is the intersection of all halfspaces containing at least @xmath16 data points .",
    "moreover , every data point must be a vertex of one or more depth regions .",
    "the point with maximal halfspace depth is called the _",
    "tukey median_. when the innermost depth region is larger than a singleton , the tukey median is defined as its centroid .",
    "this makes the tukey median unique by construction .",
    "note that the depth regions give an indication of the shape of the data cloud . based on this idea",
    "one can construct the _ bagplot _ @xcite , a bivariate version of the univariate boxplot .",
    "figure  [ fig : bag ] shows such a bagplot .",
    "the cross in the white disk is the tukey median .",
    "the dark area is an interpolation between two subsequent depth regions , and contains 50% of the data .",
    "this area ( the `` bag '' ) gives an idea of the shape of the majority of the data cloud .",
    "inflating the bag by a factor of 3 relative to the tukey median yields the `` fence '' ( not shown ) , and data points outside the fence are called outliers and marked by stars .",
    "finally , the light gray area is the convex hull of the non - outlying data points .",
    "more generally , in the multivariate case one can define the _ bagdistance _",
    "@xcite of a point @xmath17 relative to the tukey median and the bag .",
    "assume that the tukey median lies in the interior of the bag , not on its boundary ( this excludes degenerate cases ) .",
    "then the bagdistance is the smallest real number @xmath18 such that the bag inflated ( or deflated ) by @xmath18 around the tukey median contains the point @xmath17 .",
    "when the tukey median equals @xmath19 , it is shown in  @xcite that the bagdistance satisfies all axioms of a norm except that @xmath20 only needs to hold when @xmath21 .",
    "the bagdistance is used for outlier detection  @xcite and statistical classification  @xcite .    an often used criterion to judge the robustness of an estimator is its _",
    "breakdown value_. the breakdown value is the smallest fraction of data points that we need to replace in order to move the estimator of the contaminated data set arbitrarily far away .",
    "the classical mean of a data set has breakdown value zero since we can move it anywhere by moving one observation .",
    "note that for any estimator which is equivariant for translation ( which is required to call it a location estimator ) the breakdown value can be at most 1/2 .",
    "( if we replace half of the points by a far - away translation image of the remaining half , the estimator can not distinguish which were the original data . )    the tukey depth and the corresponding median have good statistical properties .",
    "the tukey median @xmath22 is a location estimator with breakdown value @xmath23 @xmath24 for any data set in general position .",
    "this means that it remains in a predetermined bounded region unless @xmath25 or more data points are moved . at an elliptically symmetric distribution",
    "the breakdown value becomes 1/3 for large @xmath0 , irrespective of @xmath26 .",
    "moreover , the halfspace depth is invariant under all nonsingular affine transformations of the data , making the tukey median affine equivariant .",
    "since data transformations such as rotation and rescaling are very common in statistics , this is an important property .",
    "the statistical asymptotics of the tukey median have been studied in  @xcite .",
    "the need for fast algorithms for the halfspace depth has only grown over the years , since it is currently being applied to a variety of settings such as nonparametric classification  @xcite .",
    "a related development is the fast growing field of functional data analysis , where the data are functions on a univariate interval ( e.g.  time or wavelength ) or on a rectangle ( e.g.  surfaces , images ) .",
    "often the function values are themselves multivariate .",
    "one can then define the depth of a curve ( surface ) by integrating the depth over all points as in  @xcite .",
    "this functional depth can again be used for outlier detection and classification  @xcite , but it requires computing depths in many multivariate data sets instead of just one .    * remark : centerpoints .",
    "* there is a close relationship between the tukey depth and centerpoints , which have been long studied in computational geometry .",
    "in fact , tukey depth extends the notion of centerpoint .",
    "centerpoint _ is any point with halfspace depth @xmath27 .",
    "a consequence of helly s theorem is that there always exists at least one centerpoint , so the depth of the tukey median can not be less than @xmath28 .",
    "1 .   simplicial depth ( @xcite ) .",

    "3 .   projection depth .",
    "we first define the _ outlyingness _ ( @xcite ) of any point @xmath8 relative to the data set @xmath10 as @xmath33 where the median absolute deviation ( mad ) of a univariate data set@xmath34 is the statistic @xmath35 .",
    "the outlyingness is small for centrally located points and increases if we move toward the boundary of the data cloud . instead of the median and",
    "the mad , also another pair @xmath36 of a location and scatter estimate may be chosen .",
    "this leads to different notions of projection depth , all defined as @xmath37 general projection depth is studied in  @xcite .",
    "when using the median and the mad , the projection depth has breakdown value 1/2 and is affine equivariant .",
    "its depth regions are convex .",
    "4 .   spatial depth ( @xcite ) .",
    "spatial depth is related to multivariate quantiles proposed in @xcite : @xmath38 the spatial median is also called the @xmath39 median ( @xcite ) .",
    "it has breakdown value 1/2 , but is not affine equivariant ( it is only equivariant with respect to translations , multiplication by a scalar factor , and orthogonal transformations ) .",
    "for a recent survey on the computation of the spatial median see  @xcite .",
    "a comparison of the main properties of the different location depth medians is given in table  [ tab : prop ] .",

    "a point @xmath8 is said to have zero arrangement depth if there exists a ray @xmath45 that does not cross any of the hyperplanes @xmath46 in the arrangement .",
    "( a hyperplane parallel to the ray is counted as intersecting at infinity . )",
    "the arrangement depth of any point @xmath8 is defined as the minimum number of hyperplanes intersected by any ray from @xmath8 .",
    "figure  [ fig : rdepd1 ] shows an arrangement of lines . in this plot , the points @xmath8 and @xmath47 have arrangement depth 0 and the point @xmath48 has arrangement depth 2 .",
    "the arrangement depth is always constant on open cells and on cell edges .",
    "it was shown ( @xcite ) that any arrangement of lines in the plane encloses a point with arrangement depth at least @xmath49 , giving rise to a new type of `` centerpoints . ''",
    "this notion of depth was originally defined ( @xcite ) in the dual , as the depth of a regression hyperplane @xmath50 relative to a point configuration of the form @xmath51 in @xmath52 .",
    "regression depth ranks hyperplanes according to how well they fit the data in a regression model , with @xmath17 containing the predictor variables and @xmath53 the response .",
    "a vertical hyperplane ( given by @xmath54 constant ) , which can not be used to predict future response values , is called a `` nonfit '' and assigned regression depth 0 .",
    "the regression depth of a general hyperplane @xmath50 is found by rotating @xmath50 in a continuous movement until it becomes vertical .",
    "the minimum number of data points that is passed in such a rotation is called the regression depth of @xmath50 .",
    "figure  [ fig : rdepd2 ] is the dual representation of figure  [ fig : rdepd1 ] .",
    "( for instance , the line @xmath8 has slope @xmath55 and intercept @xmath56 and corresponds to the point @xmath57 in figure  [ fig : rdepd1 ] . )",
    "the lines @xmath8 and @xmath47 have regression depth 0 , whereas the line @xmath48 has regression depth 2 .    in statistics",
    "one is interested in the _ deepest fit _ or regression depth median , because this is a line ( hyperplane ) about which the data are well - balanced .",
    "the statistical properties of regression depth and the deepest fit are very similar to those of the tukey depth and median .",
    "the bounds on the maximal depth are almost the same . moreover , for both depth notions the value of the maximal depth can be used to characterize the symmetry of the distribution ( @xcite ) .",
    "the breakdown value of the deepest fit is at least @xmath40 and under linearity of the conditional median of @xmath53 given @xmath17 it converges to 1/3 . in the next section",
    ", we will see that the optimal complexities for computing the depth and the median are also comparable to those for halfspace depth . for a detailed comparison of the properties of halfspace and regression depth , see  @xcite .",
    "the arrangement depth region @xmath15 is defined in the primal , as the set of points with arrangement depth at least @xmath1 .",
    "contrary to the tukey depth , these depth regions need not be convex .",
    "but nevertheless it was proved that there always exists a point with arrangement depth at least @xmath28 ( @xcite ) .",
    "an analysis - based proof was given in  @xcite .",
    "* remark : arrangement levels .",
    "* arrangement depth is undirected ( isotropic ) in the sense that it is defined as a minimum over all possible directions .",
    "if we restrict ourselves to vertical directions @xmath13 ( i.e. , up or down ) , we obtain the usual levels of the arrangement known in combinatorial geometry .",
    "the absence of preferential directions makes arrangement depth invariant under affine transformations .",
    "although the definitions of depth are intuitive , the computational aspects can be quite challenging .",
    "the calculation of depth regions and medians is computationally intensive , especially for large data sets in higher dimensions . in statistical practice",
    "such data are quite common , and therefore reliable and efficient algorithms are needed . for the bivariate case",
    "several algorithms have been developed early on .",
    "the computational aspects of depth in higher dimensions are currently being explored .",
    "algorithms for depth - related measures are often more complex for data sets which are not in general position than for data sets in general position . for example , the boundaries of subsequent halfspace depth regions are always disjoint when the data are in general position , but this does not hold for nongeneral position .",
    "preferably , algorithms should be able to handle both the general position case and the nongeneral position case directly . as a quick fix , algorithms which were made for general position",
    "can also be applied in the other case if one first adds small random errors to the data points . for large data sets",
    ", this ` dithering ' will have a limited effect on the results .",
    "table  [ tab : ldep ] gives an overview of algorithms , each of which has been implemented , to compute the depth in a given point @xmath8 in @xmath58 .",
    "these algorithms are time - optimal , since the problem of computing these bivariate depths has an @xmath59 lower bound ( @xcite , @xcite ) .    the algorithms for halfspace and simplicial depth are based on the same technique .",
    "first , data points are radially sorted around @xmath8 . then a line through @xmath8 is rotated .",
    "the depth is calculated by counting the number of points that are passed by the rotating line in a specific manner .",
    "the planar arrangement depth algorithm is easiest to visualize in the regression setting . to compute the depth of a hyperplane @xmath50 with coefficients @xmath8 , the data are first sorted along the @xmath60-axis . a vertical line @xmath61 is then moved from left to right and each time a data point is passed , the number of points above and below @xmath50 on both sides of @xmath61 is updated .    in general ,",
    "computing a median is harder than computing the depth in a point , because typically there are many candidate points .",
    "for instance , for the bivariate simplicial median the currently best algorithm requires @xmath62 time , whereas its corresponding depth needs only @xmath63 .",
    "the simplicial median seems difficult to compute because there are @xmath62 candidate points ( namely , all intersections of lines passing through two data points ) and the simplicial depth regions have irregular shapes , but of course a faster algorithm may yet be found .",
    "fortunately , in several important cases the median can be computed without computing the depth of individual points . a linear - time algorithm to compute a bivariate centerpoint",
    "was described in  @xcite .",
    "table  [ tab : lmed ] gives an overview of algorithms to compute bivariate depth - based medians .",
    "for the bivariate tukey median the lower bound @xmath59 was proved in @xcite , and the currently fastest algorithm takes @xmath64 time ( @xcite ) .",
    "the lower bound @xmath59 also holds for the median of arrangement ( regression ) depth as shown by  @xcite .",
    "fast algorithms were devised by  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "the computation of bivariate halfspace depth regions has also been studied .",
    "the first algorithm  @xcite required @xmath65 time per depth region .",
    "an algorithm to compute all regions in @xmath66 time is constructed and implemented in  @xcite .",
    "this algorithm thus also yields the tukey median .",
    "it is based on the dual arrangement of lines where topological sweep is applied .",
    "a completely different approach is implemented in  @xcite .",
    "they make direct use of the graphics hardware to approximate the depth regions of a set of points in @xmath67 time , where the pixel grid is of dimension @xmath68 .",
    "recently , @xcite constructed an algorithm to update halfspace depth and its regions when points are added to the data set .",
    "the first algorithms to compute the halfspace and regression depth of a given point in @xmath7 with @xmath69 were constructed in  @xcite and require @xmath70 time .",
    "the main idea was to use projections onto a lower - dimensional space .",
    "this reduces the problem to computing bivariate depths , for which the existing algorithms have optimal time complexity . in  @xcite theoretical output - sensitive algorithms for the halfspace depth",
    "are proposed .",
    "an interesting computational connection between halfspace depth and multivariate quantiles was provided in  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "more recently , @xcite provided a generalized version of the algorithm of  @xcite together with c++ code .",

    "see  @xcite . the simplicial depth of a point in @xmath71 can be computed in @xmath66 time , and in @xmath72 the fastest algorithm needs @xmath62 time  @xcite . for higher dimensions",
