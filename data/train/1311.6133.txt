    "quantum simulation is an exciting and rapidly evolving field of research , a key aim of which is to engineer evolution and interactions in well - defined and well - understood quantum systems so as to generate dynamics described by specific models of interest in specific parameter regimes @xcite .",
    "these dynamics are typically not able to be realized naturally in such `` clean '' form , and may offer exotic and useful physical behaviors and properties , as well as potential insights into more fundamental phenomena to which they may be relevant .",
    "engineered systems may also enable generalizations of an original target model that simply have no parallel in conventional , `` naturally occurring '' systems , and thereby open up possibilities for novel or unforeseen behavior .",
    "in recent work @xcite , we proposed a scheme based on interactions in optical cavity quantum electrodynamics ( cavity qed ) for the simulation of qubit - oscillator dynamics in the ultrastrong - coupling regime ; that is , for the realization of a system described by the rabi hamiltonian ( @xmath0 ) , @xmath1 operating in a regime where the effective qubit and oscillator frequencies , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively , are comparable in magnitude to , or even less than , the coupling strength , @xmath4 . here ,",
    "@xmath5 are two - state ( pauli ) operators for the qubit , and @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) is the annihilation ( creation ) operator for the quantized oscillator . in the proposed scheme ,",
    "the qubit states are two stable ( hyperfine ) ground states of an atom , while the oscillator is simply the cavity field mode .",
    "raman transitions between the atomic states are driven by the cavity mode and auxiliary laser fields , such that @xmath4 is given by a raman transition rate , while dispersive energy shifts due to the laser fields and atom - cavity dipole coupling determine the effective frequencies @xmath2 and @xmath3 . in this way",
    ", @xmath8 can be brought to the same magnitude .",
    "however , the scheme of @xcite also gives rise to a nonlinear coupling of the form @xmath9 where the coupling strength @xmath10 is also determined by a dispersive energy shift due to the atom - cavity dipole coupling and can in practice be chosen to match or even exceed the magnitudes of @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the form ( [ eq : h_nl ] ) is normally recognized as an effective hamiltonian for the dispersive limit of ( [ eq : h_rabi ] ) ; i.e. , if @xmath11 , then the atom - cavity interaction of ( [ eq : h_rabi ] ) can effectively be reduced to ( [ eq : h_nl ] ) ( with @xmath12 and hence @xmath13 ) .",
    "the scheme of @xcite allows @xmath14 and @xmath15 to exist _ simultaneously _ and on an _ equal footing _ in the description of the cavity qed system .",
    "we therefore have an example of an engineered quantum system that has no direct parallel in the conventional description of atom - cavity interactions .    that this can give rise to very interesting and novel behavior was illustrated briefly in @xcite , where the regime @xmath16 with @xmath17 was considered with the addition of cavity dissipation . in particular , critical - type behavior was observed in the mean photon number @xmath18 , atomic inversion @xmath19 , and intensity correlation function @xmath20 around the values @xmath21 .",
    "the significance of these two values follows straightforwardly from the form that the total hamiltonian , @xmath22 , takes at these values , i.e. , @xmath23 in the limit @xmath24 , the eigenstates of this hamiltonian are the bare states @xmath25 and @xmath26 , where @xmath27 denotes the cavity photon number and @xmath28 the atomic state .",
    "more importantly , at @xmath29 the eigenstates @xmath25 ( @xmath30 ) are degenerate , with energy @xmath31 , while at @xmath32 the eigenstates @xmath26 ( @xmath30 ) are degenerate , with energy @xmath33 . for finite @xmath4 , this ( infinite )",
    "degeneracy results in pronounced excitation of the system at @xmath21 , mitigated however by cavity dissipation to give a finite , dynamical steady state .    in this paper , however , we focus instead on the behavior around @xmath34 , with comparatively small @xmath3 . for this choice of @xmath10",
    ", the qubit states are effectively `` flipped '' between the zero- and single - photon subspaces , i.e. , @xmath35 the significance of this exchange is illustrated in fig .",

    "one sees distinct resonances in the photon number centered at @xmath34 , while the atomic inversion undergoes a sharp `` flip '' around this point and attains a maximum ( minimum ) value close to @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) at @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) for the parameters chosen .",
    "perhaps most notably though , a broad region of strong photon antibunching , @xmath45 , occurs about these values , with a minimum in @xmath36 at @xmath34 .",
    "the minimum value of @xmath36 decreases rapidly as the ratio @xmath37 increases .",
    "strong photon bunching is still observed around the values @xmath21 , as seen in @xcite , but otherwise the dominant features in the operator expectation values are those associated with the degeneracies at @xmath46 .",

    "briefly , this behavior is related to degeneracies occurring ( for @xmath24 ) at @xmath46 . in particular , at @xmath44 the states @xmath52 and @xmath53 have the same energy , @xmath33 , while at @xmath43 the states @xmath54 and @xmath55 both have energy @xmath31 .",
    "as we will see , these degeneracies ( or near - degeneracies , as is the case for @xmath34 with @xmath56 and @xmath57 ) together with the linear atom - field coupling and cavity photon emissions enable a novel closed cycle within the zero- and single - photon subspaces , while excitation of higher - photon - number states is far off resonance and thereby suppressed , the obvious result of which is strong photon antibunching .",
    "this mechanism for producing antibunched light is novel in the way that it derives from the energy level structure imposed by the nonlinear coupling , @xmath15 , and from the form of the atom - field coupling in the rabi hamiltonian , @xmath14 , i.e. , it depends equally on the `` rotating '' ( @xmath58 ) and `` counter - rotating '' ( @xmath59 ) terms .",
    "it complements so - called `` photon blockade '' mechanisms based upon the nonlinear structure of the jaynes - cummings model with strong coupling and resonant ( laser ) excitation of a vacuum rabi resonance @xcite or upon dynamical regulation conditioned on the state of a two - level atom @xcite .",
    "photon antibunching in the ultrastrong coupling regime of cavity qed has recently also been studied in @xcite .",
    "however , in that work , a system described by ( [ eq : h_rabi ] ) was subjected to an additional coherent driving field , and coupled to a reservoir with a different structure than we consider here .",
    "no non - linear coupling of the form ( [ eq : h_nl ] ) was present , and the mechanism for antibunching was fundamentally the same as in @xcite .",
    "their modeling of the reservoir is relevant to recent experimental realizations of systems in the ultrastrong coupling regime based upon circuit qed or semiconductor microcavities @xcite , whereas we consider a `` conventional '' treatment of the reservoir , relevant to cavity qed realizations such as that considered in @xcite .",
    "for small @xmath4 the cavity mode is only weakly excited ( as evidenced by the small photon numbers in fig .",
    "[ fig : ada_sz_g2 ] ) , suggesting that an expansion of the system state in terms of just the lowest few fock states of the cavity mode should suffice .",
    "furthermore , one can assume that at any particular the state of the system is essentially pure , and that collapses of the state due to , in our case , photon emissions from the cavity mode are infrequent . for our particular system ,",
    "as described by ( [ eq : me ] ) , one finds that there are in fact two orthogonal manifolds of states that the system may occupy at a given time ; in particular , in between photon emissions the approximate state of the system may be described by one or other of the following two forms :    @xmath60    where it is assumed that @xmath61 ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "note that a photon emission ( corresponding to a state collapse described by @xmath63 ) switches the system state from one manifold to the other , and that the probability of a photon emission in the time interval @xmath64 is given by @xmath65 .",
    "the evolution of the state in between collapses is given by @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the non - hermitian effective hamiltonian @xmath68 the equations of motion for the amplitudes in the pure state expansion are then ( setting @xmath69 ) @xmath70 and @xmath71 which yield , to leading order in @xmath4 , the ( quasi-)steady state values @xmath72 and @xmath73    @xmath74 where @xmath75 and @xmath76 this ratio simply reflects the relative stability of the two manifolds with respect to photon emission .",
