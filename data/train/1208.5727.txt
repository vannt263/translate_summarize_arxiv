    "dislocations occupy a central position in discussions of the permanent deformation of metals because of their role as the main carriers of plastic deformation .",
    "therefore it is necessary to incorporate their presence , or the main effect of their presence , in a plasticity model that aims for a predictive power .",
    "however , since the typical number of dislocations even in a small sample of the material is very high , formulating a model that keeps track of every single dislocation is out of reach except for very small - scale problems .",
    "this explains the interest in describing the collective behaviour of dislocations in terms of a continuum quantity : the dislocation density .",
    "the challenge in this scale transition consists in describing the time evolution of the dislocation density in a physically - driven way , by performing a rigorous upscaling from the dislocation scale to the dislocation density scale ( also called _ meso - scale _ ) .",
    "this task has been mainly pursued phenomenologically or by means of a statistical mechanics approach and has produced a number of competing models ( e.g.  @xcite ) . in the case of",
    "parallel , straight dislocations , the evolution of the dislocation density @xmath1 ( here we assume , for simplicity , that all the dislocations have the same burgers vector ) is described in terms of a continuity equation of the following form : @xmath2 where the velocity @xmath3 driving the evolution is of the form @xmath4 with @xmath5 denoting the burgers vector , @xmath6 a linear drag coefficient , @xmath7 an externally applied shear stress ( constant , for simplicity ) and @xmath8 an internal stress accounting for the net effect of the interactions among dislocations .",
    "the different models available in the engineering literature differ in the expressions of the internal stress that they propose ; the range of validity of the proposed theories is typically unclear , as well as the conditions under which one of them is to be preferred over another one .",
    "in fact most of the models have been derived phenomenologically , often starting from an _ ad hoc _ ansatz , or assumptions have been made in the derivation that are not always justified .",
    "here comes the essential difference of our approach : we obtain a continuum model for the dislocation density from a more fundamental discrete dislocation model using a rigorous mathematical approach ( @xmath9-convergence ) . as a consequence",
    ", we obtain an exact classification of limiting behaviour for the system that we study , which unifies existing , independently derived descriptions into a coherent framework , and identifies new regimes that have not yet been studied .    in order to make each step in the derivation",
    "completely justified and rigorous , our starting point has to be an idealised dislocation configuration .",
    "more precisely , we consider the discrete model of an idealised pile - up of dislocations studied in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "this model describes the equilibrium positions of @xmath0 dislocation walls under the influence of an applied stress @xmath7 that pushes the walls towards an impenetrable barrier ; the barrier is modelled as a wall of pinned dislocations at @xmath10 ( see section [ prob - statement ] for the detailed description ) .",
    "the discrete equilibrium equations for the positions of the @xmath0 walls can be written in the general form @xmath11 where the discrete internal stress for the @xmath12-th wall is the sum of the contributions due to the interactions with the other walls ( see ( [ eq:1 ] ) for the detailed expression of the equations ) .",
    "therefore the system ( [ discretesigma ] ) is nothing but @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the velocity of the @xmath12-th wall . at this point",
    "one can intuitively imagine that passing to the ( continuum ) limit in the discrete equation ( [ discretesigma ] ) should give a continuum analog of ( [ form : v ] ) for @xmath15 , and consequently an expression for a continuum version of the internal stress .",
    "this is exactly the object we want to characterise .",
    "our approach is different from the upscaling procedure followed in the quoted papers that considered the same pile - up configuration . in @xcite the convergence of stationary states",
    "is proved using formal methods , in a special case of our analysis . moreover , while @xcite perform a two - step discrete - to - continuum upscaling by smearing out the dislocations first in the slip plane and then in the in - wall direction , we upscale in the two directions simultaneously .",
    "we stress that the continuum model we derive is in perfect agreement with our starting discrete model .",
    "we recall that in @xcite , as the authors point out , the resulting continuum model has to be corrected to incorporate the missing interaction .",
    "an interesting novelty in our result is that the mesoscopic internal stress we obtain does not depend on the dislocation density ( and its gradient ) only , but it also contains some more _ local _ information about the discrete arrangement of the dislocations , that the density alone would fail to capture . to be more precise ,",
    "consider the two arrangements in figure [ densitypattern ] .",
    "they correspond to the same density , i.e. , to the same number of dislocations per unit volume .",
    "but the dislocation patterns in the two cases are different and this will result in different expressions for the upscaled internal stress describing the overall interactions in the two cases .",
    "@xmath16{density1 } & \\hspace{2.3 cm } \\includegraphics[width=1.8in]{density2 } \\end{array}$ ]    this additional _ local _ information on the arrangement of the dislocations can be expressed in terms of an aspect ratio @xmath17 , defined as the ratio between the typical distance @xmath18 between two consecutive dislocations in the same row ( slip plane ) and the distance @xmath19 between two consecutive dislocations in the same wall . in figure [ densitypattern ]",
    "the first arrangement corresponds to @xmath20 , the second one to @xmath21 .",
    "the upscaling procedure we adopt for the micro - to - meso upscaling is based on a variational convergence called @xmath9-convergence , which is well - known in the mathematical community and has been successfully applied to a variety of problems in materials science , from fracture mechanics to homogenization , from magnetomechanics to dimension reduction .",
    "our approach focusses on the discrete energy of the system of dislocations ( minimisers of the energy are exactly the solutions to ( [ discretesigma ] ) ) .",
    "the discrete - to - continuum upscaling is done by letting the number of dislocations @xmath0 become infinitely large . according to the different asymptotic behaviour of the aspect ratio @xmath17 ( i.e. , according to the _ local _ distribution of the dislocations ) , five different expressions for the continuum energy can be derived ( we refer to @xcite for the details of the mathematical procedure ) ; and , accordingly , five different expressions for the upscaled internal stress .    the results we obtain show that the simplified discrete model taken as a starting point is not _",
    "too simple_. in fact the internal stresses resulting from our derivation are more general than many well - known models proposed in the engineering literature ( see @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "more precisely , our result contains as a special case the internal stresses proposed in the quoted papers , explaining their range of validity",
    ". the comparison with previous models will be the subject of section [ comparison ] .",
    "the key advantage of our rigorous approach to upscaling compared to other methods is that it is exact .",
    "this means that once a discrete model is chosen ( with its simplifications and limitations ) the corresponding upscaled continuum model obtained by following our method is uniquely determined .",
    "moreover , the fact that no simplifying assumptions are made during the derivation ( but only at the level of the discrete model ) explains why such a rich variety of continuum models can be obtained , even from a relatively simple model .",
    "this is not the case for other upscaling methods , where the starting point can be more general , but a number of restrictions and simplifications are typically made in the derivation , affecting the generality of the upscaled models and their range of validity .",

    "section [ conclusion ] contains a short conclusion .",
    "the problem we are considering is the equilibrium of a system of @xmath0 walls of straight edge dislocations ( all with the same burgers vector ) under the action of an externally applied shear stress that pushes the walls towards an impenetrable barrier .",
    "consecutive dislocations within the same wall are assumed to be equidistant , at distance @xmath22 , and we assume there are infinitely many dislocations in each wall . the impenetrable barrier is modeled as an infinite wall of pinned dislocations ( the plane @xmath23 ) .",

    "it is clearly a simplification and we are aware of the fact that a complete analysis of a fully 3d - dislocation model would be preferable . on the other hand , this idealised configuration allows us to carry out a rigorous analysis , whereas more random configurations would require a statistical approach .",
    "such a statistical approach , however , would typically require some additional assumptions in the derivation , and therefore it might well result in a limit model that is less general than the one rigorously derived from a more idealised setting",
    ".    moreover , although the discrete model we consider is highly idealised , it has a number of properties that make it both interesting and not unrealistic .",
    "the fact that multiple dislocations move along exactly the same slip plane is natural , because of the way they are generated from _ frank - read sources _ ( e.g.  ( * ? ? ?",
    "also , although the assumption of an arrangement in equispaced vertical walls is clearly an idealisation , it is on the other hand not unrealistic since equispaced vertical walls are minimal - energy configurations .",
    "walls of edge dislocations are locally stable , in the sense that if one of the dislocations deviates from its wall position , either horizontally or vertically , it experiences a restoring force from the other dislocations that pushes it back .",
    "finally , the vertical organization in walls is also justified by correlation functions calculated from numerical simulations  ( e.g.  @xcite ) .    for these reasons",
    "we believe that our simplified discrete system is not too simple and that it is worth exploring it . moreover , the mesoscopic models we obtain are general enough to contain as a special case several well - known models in the engineering literature , including some models derived by statistical arguments .",
    "the equilibrium positions of the dislocation walls are obtained by solving the following equations for every wall @xmath30 :    @xmath31    where @xmath32 is the ( globally repulsive ) stress governing the wall - wall interactions , @xmath33 is the constant applied shear stress , @xmath5 is the length of the burgers vector , @xmath34 is the poisson s ratio and @xmath35 is the shear modulus . setting @xmath36 we can rewrite ( [ eq:1 ] ) as @xmath37    solving the equations ( [ eq:1r ] ) numerically gives a vector @xmath38 ; the @xmath12-th component of the vector represents the equilibrium position of the @xmath12-th dislocation wall . defining the discrete dislocation density as @xmath39 we can plot the discrete density as a function of the equilibrium positions , obtaining the plots in figure [ ddensities ] for different values of the applied stress @xmath7 .    at 180 -15 at 570 -15 at 950 -15    @xmath40{initial1 } & \\includegraphics[width=1.6in]{initial2 } & \\includegraphics[width=1.6in]{initial3 } \\end{array}$ ]    from figure [ ddensities ] we can clearly see that the solution highly depends on the values of the problem parameters .",
    "in particular , for large values of the applied stress @xmath7 the peak of the dislocation density close to zero seems to be dominating , while for smaller values of the stress a rather linear behaviour of the density is prominent at first , and then a decay .",
    "this suggests that depending on the problem parameters , some behaviour of the density seems to be dominant in the bulk ( sufficiently far from the boundary of the pile - up region , where the occurrence of _ boundary layers _ is expected ) .",
    "this key observation is already present in the recent paper @xcite , where a careful numerical analysis of the behaviour of the dislocation density in a pile - up is performed , and three different parameter regimes are identified . in particular , the linear dependence of the dislocation density with respect to the positions of the dislocations was observed there .",
    "however , a discrete numerical approach has some drawbacks .",
    "first of all , it is computationally expensive when the number @xmath0 of dislocation walls is large .",
    "but the main drawback is that it is too detailed : knowing the position of each dislocation is definitely not necessary , i.e. , an average mesoscopic information in terms of e.g.  a continuum dislocation density should be preferred .",
    "despite its simple formulation , computing the continuum limit of the equilibrium equations  ( [ eq:1r ] ) turns out to be a rather involved problem .",
    "the complexity of the problem is illustrated in figure  [ ddensities ] , where the optimal discrete dislocation density ( obtained numerically ) is plotted for different values of the problem parameters .",
    "the aim of this paper is to derive a continuum description from the discrete system by rigorous mathematical upscaling . we do this by exploiting the variational structure of the equilibrium equations ( [ eq:1r ] ) ; hence we write down the discrete energy whose minimisers satisfy the equilibrium equations ( [ eq:1r ] ) .",
    "the upscaling procedure will then be carried out on the discrete energy rather than on the discrete equations , and will produce a continuum energy functional .",
    "the method used to perform the discrete - to - continuum upscaling is @xmath9-convergence and the details of the rigorous mathematical derivation can be found in @xcite . the equilibrium equation associated with the upscaled limit",

    "this paper unravels the mechanical response of a system of walls of parallel edge dislocations that move along equidistant parallel slip planes . by implementing a rigorous mathematical limit procedure ,",
    "we have identified five different parameter regimes , as the number @xmath0 of walls tends to infinity .",
    "these regimes are characterized by the asymptotic behaviour of a single dimensionless parameter .",
    "for each of these regimes we have identified the limiting internal stress that is generated by the dislocation density , and the structure of a pile - up of walls against a hard obstacle . for two of the regimes the expressions that we obtain were known in the literature , and our results provide new insight by clearly delineating the conditions under which these expressions are valid .",
    "the three other cases are new , and the corresponding behaviour has not been studied before .",
    "although the analysed wall configuration is highly simplified , the rigorous nature of this work implies that these results can be considered as a benchmark : any ( possibly more general ) model that describes the behaviour of large numbers of dislocations should reproduce at least the behaviour given by the results of this paper when applied to the corresponding idealised situation .",
