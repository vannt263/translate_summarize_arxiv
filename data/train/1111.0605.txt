    "the density of the universe is dominated at present by a cosmological constant ( @xmath11 ) and cold dark matter ( cdm ) , corresponding respectively to roughly 70% and 25% of the total density , with the remaining @xmath12 in baryons .",
    "the present - day radiation content of the universe is negligible in comparison , but this radiation was the dominant component at early times .    while the cosmological observations are generally consistent with this standard model , there are a few unresolved issues .",
    "one of these involves the total radiation content of the universe .",
    "the energy density of the cmb is a simple function of the cmb temperature and is known to high accuracy .",
    "similarly , given the observed number of light neutrinos ( @xmath13 ) , one can calculate the neutrino energy density .",
    "( in fact , the  effective \" number of neutrinos , @xmath2 is slightly greater than 3 due to partial heating of the neutrinos in the early universe by electron - positron annihilation . including these effects yields @xmath14 @xcite ) .",

    "recent calculations of the relic helium abundance by izotov and thuan @xcite and by aver , olive , and skillman @xcite have reached opposite conclusions , with the former arguing for an additional dark radiation component and the latter concluding that the standard number of neutrinos suffices .",

    "@xcite .    given these hints of new physics , a number of models",
    "have been proposed to account for additional dark radiation . the simplest way to achieve",
    "this is to add additional relativistic relic particles , as suggested by , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite . in this case",

    "additional relativistic energy density can also be provided by a neutrino chemical potential , as in the models discussed in refs .",

    "alternately , if one wishes to produce an increase in @xmath2 in the cmb , but retain the standard - model value for @xmath2 in bbn , then an obvious possibility is the production of relativistic , non - electromagnetically - interacting particles from the decay of a massive relic particle after bbn .",
    "such a scenario for the dark radiation was considered by ichikawa et al .",
    "@xcite , and further elaborated by fischler and meyers @xcite and hasenkamp @xcite .",
    "if we let @xmath21 denote the value of @xmath2 as measured by bbn , and @xmath22 be the value determined from the cmb and other low - redshift measurements , then these decaying particle models predict @xmath23 , while additional stable relativistic degrees of freedom give @xmath24 .    in this paper",
    ", we fill in the gap between these two regimes by examining decaying particle scenarios in which the particle decays during bbn .",
    "such models produce a relation between @xmath21 and @xmath22 that varies from @xmath24 at short particle lifetimes ( when the particle decays before the onset of bbn ) to @xmath23 when the particle decays after the conclusion of bbn .",
    "in the next section , we give a detailed discussion of our calculation and present our results for @xmath21 and @xmath22 as a function of the decaying particle abundance and lifetime .",

    "we assume a standard flat friedman - robertson - walker model with the expansion rate given by : @xmath25 where r is the scale factor and @xmath26 is the energy density . to this standard cosmological model",
    "we add a nonrelativistic particle @xmath27 , which is unstable and decays with lifetime @xmath0 . by assumption",

    "@xcite was the constraint from bbn that could be placed on these decaying particles , while in this paper , we will be interested in using such models to provide dark radiation , and to determine the relation between @xmath21 and @xmath22 as a function of the model parameters .",

    "@xcite and parametrize the density of the decaying particle in terms of its number density relative to the entropy density , @xmath28 , prior to decay ( @xmath29 ) : @xmath30 where @xmath28 is given by @xmath31 in eq .",

    "the important useful property of this parametrization is that @xmath38 remains constant through the epoch of @xmath39 annihilation , which occurs during the middle of bbn . during the bbn epoch",

    "( [ drhoxdt])-([drhodecdt ] ) that @xmath45 , and thus , the increase in @xmath2 , depends only on @xmath48 and @xmath0 .    evolving these equations to calculate @xmath44 and @xmath45 , and converting @xmath45 into an effective number of neutrinos , we derive @xmath3 , the change in @xmath2 as measured by the cmb , as a function of @xmath48 and @xmath0 , where we confine our attention to the case where the @xmath27 particle fully decays before last scattering . a contour plot of @xmath3 as a function of @xmath48 and @xmath0",
    "is given in fig .",
    "1 .    in the limit where the decaying particles themselves never dominate the expansion",
    ", one can calculate @xmath3 as a function of @xmath48 and @xmath0 , as in ref .",
    "@xcite . rewriting the results of ref .",
    "@xcite in terms of our parameters , we find @xmath49 a comparison of eq .",
    "( [ ncmb ] ) with the results displayed in fig .",
    "1 shows that eq .",
    "( [ ncmb ] ) is accurate to within @xmath50 for the curves displayed in fig .",
    "1 . note that our analytic expression for @xmath3 differs significantly from that derived in ref .",
    "@xcite , as the latter used the  sudden decay approximation , \" in which all of the energy density of the decaying particle is taken to be converted into relativistic decay products at @xmath51 .",
    "adding additional energy density during bbn affects all of the element abundances , but the effect is largest ( relative to the accuracy with which the primordial abundances can be estimated ) for @xmath6he . additional energy density ( either relativistic or nonrelativistic ) increases the expansion rate , resulting in a larger relic neutron abundance , and increased @xmath6he production @xcite .",
    "thus , the @xmath6he abundance has long been used to constrain any additional relativistic energy density , such as that produced by additional neutrinos @xcite .",
    "we use the kawano @xcite version of the wagoner @xcite big bang nucleosynthesis code to calculate the change in the primordial @xmath6he abundance with the addition of @xmath44 and @xmath45 as given by eqs .",
    "( [ drhoxdt ] ) and ( [ drhodecdt ] ) , taking a baryon - photon ratio of @xmath52 .",
    "( note that since we are presenting the _ change _ in the @xmath6he abundance produced by the decaying particle , rather than the absolute helium abundance itself , our results are quite insensitive to the assumed value of @xmath53 ; see , e.g. , fig .",
    "we determine the change in the number of relativistic neutrinos that gives exactly the same change in the @xmath6he abundance as a decaying particle with a given abundance and lifetime .",
    "thus , for any pair of values for @xmath48 and @xmath0 , we have a corresponding change @xmath4 that produces the same effect on bbn .",
    "( the change in the other element abundances can be ignored here ) . in fig .",
    "2 , we give a contour plot of @xmath4 as a function of @xmath48 and @xmath0 .",
    "in comparing figs . 1 and 2 , we see that for @xmath7 sec , @xmath54 . in this short - lifetime limit ,",
    "all of the decaying particle energy density is converted into dark radiation before bbn begins , so both bbn and the cmb  see \" the same @xmath2 .    in the opposite limit , @xmath9 sec , the contours in fig .",
    "2 become horizontal lines . in this long - lifetime limit ,",
    "all of the @xmath27 particles decay after bbn , and the increase in the expansion rate that alters the @xmath6he abundance is due entirely to the energy density of the nonrelativistic particles before they decay .",
    "thus , in this limit , @xmath4 becomes a function only of @xmath48 and is independent of @xmath0 .",
    "note that @xmath4 never goes to zero in the long lifetime limit precisely because of this contribution to the expansion rate from the nonrelativistc particles .",
    "however , by increasing @xmath0 , one can make @xmath55 arbitrarily small .    the interesting transitional regime , then",
    ", is precisely the one we have explored : 0.1 @xmath56 sec",
    ". this would be the regime of interest if more precise measurements of @xmath2 from the cmb and bbn yielded nonzero values for both @xmath3 and @xmath4 with @xmath57 .",
    "it this case , it is possible to simply read off , from figs . 1 - 2 , values of @xmath48 and @xmath0 that give the desired values for @xmath4 and @xmath3 .",
    "note , however , that one always has @xmath10 in this scenario , so this model can be falsified by observations contradicting this inequality .    as an example",
    ", we show , in fig .",
    "3 , the limits on @xmath48 and @xmath0 using the upper and lower bounds on @xmath3 from ref . @xcite and the upper bound on @xmath4 from ref . @xcite .",
    "as expected , the upper bound on @xmath4 cuts into the region favored by @xmath3 at short lifetimes , but current bounds are not sufficiently restrictive for this to be a major effect . tighter bounds from future observational data will , of course , shrink this allowed region .",
    "our results can be generalized to more complicated scenarios , such as a particle that decays into both dark radiation and electromagnetically - interacting particles .",
    "even a small branching ratio into the latter can produce a markedly different effect on bbn if the decay products are energetic enough to photofission the primordial nuclei ( see , e.g. , refs . @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "these effects , however , tend to be minimal for the lifetimes ( @xmath58 sec ) considered here , since the electromagnetically - interacting particles thermalize rapidly at high temperatures . even in this case , however , the electromagnetically - interacting decay products can heat the photons relative to the neutrino background , potentially decreasing @xmath2 instead of increasing it @xcite .",
