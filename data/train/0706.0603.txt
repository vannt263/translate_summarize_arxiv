    "in a recent paper @xcite we embarked on a quantitative study of causal diamonds , or alexandrov open sets , which are beginning to play an increasingly important role in quantum gravity , for example in the approach via casual sets @xcite , in discussions of holography , and also of the probability of various observations in eternal inflation models ( see @xcite for a recent example and references to earlier work ) .",
    "the calculations in @xcite were concerned with small causal diamonds , that is causal diamonds @xmath0 whose duration @xmath8 is small compared with the ambient curvature scale .",
    "the present paper was motivated by inflationary cosmology and the observations showing that the scale factor @xmath9 of our present universe is accelerating .",
    "indeed , it is given to a good approximation by assuming that the spatial geometry is flat and setting the = 1 so that a()= ^ 2 3 ( t ) , [ scale]where @xmath10 is the cosmological constant .",
    "the jerk is a dimensionless measure of the rate of change of acceleration .",
    "it is easily seen to be unity if and only if we have @xmath11 model with a cosmological constant and pressure free matter @xcite . the physical reason why the jerk of the observed universe is unity is unclear .",
    "equation ( [ scale ] ) then solves einstein s equations with a cosmological term coupled to a pressure free fluid .",
    "the questions we are interested in concern the observations made by a hypothetical observer moving along a timelike world line @xmath12 , in metric which is not exactly but only asymptotically de - sitter , in the limit that his / her own proper time @xmath13 . in particular we shall study the volume @xmath14 of the causal diamond @xmath0 where @xmath15 and @xmath2 lie on @xmath12 in the limit when both @xmath16 while @xmath17 is kept fixed . thus both points @xmath15 and @xmath2 tend to future spacelike infinity @xmath3 while the duration of the diamond @xmath4 is kept fixed .",
    "the entire diamond is in the asymptotic region and the volume of the diamond depends on the asymptotic geometry which we wish to explore .",
    "the volume ( at fixed @xmath4 ) remains finite in this limit and is given by the universal formula @xmath18 plus corrections ( which are given by a series in @xmath6 ) which begin at order @xmath7 .",
    "this behaviour will be shown to be consistent with the no - hair property of cosmological event horizons and with calculations of de - sitter quasinormal modes in the literature .    before describing our calculations",
    ", we shall give a brief review of the geometry of asymptotically de - sitter spacetimes .",
    "> from now on we adopt units in which @xmath19 and hence @xmath20 .",
    "the metric on de - sitter space may be cast in friedmann - lemaitre form in three different ways ( i ) & & k=+1,a(t ) = t , + ( ii ) & & k= 0 , a(t)= t , + ( iii ) & & k=-1 , a(t ) = t . of these",
    "only the first is global , that is covers the full geodesically complete spacetime .",
    "another local chart , valid only inside an observer dependent cosmological horizon , is the locally static form ds ^2 = -(1-r^2 ) dt^2 + dr ^2 1-r^2 + r^2 ( d ^2 + ^2 d ^2 ) .",
    "[ static ] it was conjectured in @xcite , before the theory of inflation , that perturbations of de - sitter should settle down inside the the cosmological event horizon ( @xmath21 ) to the exact static form .",
    "how this no hair mechanism works in practice was later elucidated in the context of inflation in @xcite who pointed out that while scalar and gravitational perturbations of de - sitter spacetime described using any of the friedmann - lemaitre coordinates do not decay , but rather freeze in to constant values at late times , restricted to interior the event horizon of any given inertial observer , the perturbations decay exponentially .",
    "one way of understanding this is to note @xcite that the general asymptotic form of the metric at late times expressed in quasi - friedmann - lemaitre , geodesic or gaussian coordinates takes the form ds ^2 = -dt ^2 + e^2 t g_ij ( x ) dx^i dx ^j +  [ late ] where @xmath22 is an _",
    "arbitrary _ three - metric .",
    "thus _ globally _ the metric does not settle down to the de - sitter form .",
    "however _ locally _ that is within the event horizon of any given observer it does . that is because as time goes on , such an observer can access an exponentially smaller and smaller proportion of the spatial hypersurface @xmath23 .",
    "now provided that the @xmath24 is smooth , no matter what metric it is given , any local patch when examined with sufficient magnification will appear flat .",
    "exact solutions of the einstein equations describing this process are rather rare , but there are some : the biaxial taub - nut metrics , and that exhibits this mechanism rather clearly @xcite . for a recent astrophyisical perspective on the eschatology of an asymptotically",
    "de - sitter universes see @xcite .    in a",
    "later , and completely independent , development fefferman and graham @xcite examined asymptotically hyperbolic riemannian ( i.e positive definite ) einstein metrics with negative scalar curvature near their conformal boundary .",
    "it is clear that the asymptotic expansions they obtained are identical in structure to those discussed by starobinsky earlier @xcite for a lorentzian einstein metrics with positive scalar curvature near its spacelike conformal boundary .",
    "they are also identical in structure to the asymptotical anti - de - sitter metrics near their timelike boundary @xcite . in what follows",
    "we shall make use of these expansions .",
    "for more work on the de - sitter case see @xcite .",
    "we consider a ( @xmath25-dimensional space - time which solves the einstein equations r_-12g_r = g _ with negative cosmological constant @xmath26 , @xmath27 is the de - sitter radius .",
    "we look at the solution to these equations close to the spacelike infinity @xmath3 in the form ds^2=-l^2d^22 ^ 2 + 1g_ij(x,)dx^idx^j where @xmath28 is a timelike coordinate such that @xmath29 at @xmath30 .",
    "coordinates @xmath31 are the coordinates on the spacelike surface @xmath3 . inserting this metric into the einstein equations one obtains a system of equations [ 2 g^ - 2 g^g^-1 g^+ ( g^-1 g^ ) g^ ] + l^2ric ( g ) - ( d - 2 ) g^- ( g^-1 g^ ) g = 0 _ i ( g^-1 g^ ) -",

    "notice that we could have considered the einstein equations with negative cosmological constant @xmath35 .",
    "the analytic continuation between two cases is a simple replacement @xmath36 both in the metric ( [ 2 ] ) and in equations ( [ 3 ] ) .",
    "the analytic continuation between two spacetimes was considered in detail in the appendix of @xcite .",
    "coordinate @xmath28 then becomes a radial coordinate , @xmath29 is the timelike infinity of the asymptotically anti - de - sitter space - time .",
    "the solution of the equations ( [ 3 ] ) in this case is well known in the form of the asymptotic expansion g_ij(x,)=g^(0)_ij(x)+g^(2)_ij(x)+ .. +g^(d)_ij(x)^d/2+h^(d)_ij(x)^d/2 + .. where @xmath37 is the metric on the timelike boundary of the anti - de - sitter space - time .",
    "the coefficients @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 are uniquely determined by the metric @xmath37 while for @xmath41 only the trace and the covariant divergence are determined by @xmath37 .",
    "@xmath41 thus encodes the stress energy tensor of the boundary dual theory .",
    "coefficient @xmath40 is non - vanishing only if @xmath42 is even , it has some interesting conformal properties and mathematicians call it the obstruction tensor .",
    "in the asymptotically de - sitter case one can use same expansion ( [ 4 ] ) taking into account that @xmath28 is now a time - like coordinate and metric @xmath37 is now the metric on the spacelike future infinity @xmath3 .",
    "moreover , all expressions for the coefficients @xmath38 and @xmath40 as determined by @xmath37 take exactly same form as in the asymptotically anti - de - sitter case provided the substitution @xmath36 is applied . in particular",
    "we find for the first few coefficients @xcite , @xcite , & & g^(2)_ij(x)=l^2(d-2)(r_ij-12(d-1)rg^(0)_ij ) , + & & g^(4)_ij = ( _ i _ j r - _ k ^k r_ij . & & + _ k ^k r g^(0)_ij - r^kl r_ikjl & & + r_i^k r_kj + r r_ij & & .",

    "the expressions for @xmath43 are singular when @xmath44 . in this case",
    "@xmath45 is not uniquely determined by metric @xmath46 .",
    "the einstein equations impose certain constraints on the trace and covariant divergence of coefficient @xmath47 .",
    "in the rest of the paper we will be interested in a four - dimensional asymptotically de - sitter space - time so that @xmath48 . since @xmath42 is odd no obstruction tensor appears in the expansion ( [ 4 ] ) . from now on we use units in which @xmath49 .    _",

    "the coordinate @xmath50 is convenient for measuring the geodesic distance ( the proper time ) along a timelike geodesic .",

    "notice that expansion in @xmath93 is also expansion in the curvature ( and its derivatives ) of @xmath3 .",

    "this is due to the fact that in the expansion ( [ 6 ] ) one has that @xmath95 and due to the property @xmath96 the other possible source for a @xmath97 term is the @xmath85 modification in ( [ s23 ] ) .",
    "the analysis however shows that this modification shows up in the volume in the form of even powers of @xmath85 , i.e. it may first appear in term @xmath98 .    so that the next non - vanishing term in expansion ( [ 16 ] ) is @xmath7",
    ". it would be interesting to see whether all odd powers of @xmath6 vanish in expansion ( [ 16 ] ) of the volume .",
    "we note that the volume has finite limit when @xmath99 so no regularization is needed . at first sight , this is surprising since taking that the volume of a bulk region is typically divergent when the boundary of the region approaches infinity ( spacelike in anti - de - sitter and timelike in de - sitter space - time , see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "however in maximally symmetric spacetime like de - sitter , it is clear that all causal diamonds with the same duration @xmath4 are equivalent , no matter how close to future infinity @xmath100 they may be , and they must therefore have the same volume @xmath101 given in fact by the universal formula for @xmath102 in ( [ jj ] ) . the same universal formula was obtained in a different way in @xcite ( see ( 21 ) of that reference ) .",
    "we emphasize that the first term in the expansion ( [ 16 ] ) comes from the metric ds^2=-dt^2+e^2t(dr^2+r^2(d^2+^2 ) ) of de - sitter spacetime with flat constant @xmath50 slices .",
    "this is the only contribution in the limit of @xmath13 .",
    "the curvature of the spacelike surface @xmath3 shows up in the @xmath103 correction terms .",
    "thus the information on the curvature of @xmath3 which is encoded in the volume of the causal diamond is exponentially suppressed . when the diamond as a whole moves closer to the future infinity the geometry inside the diamond becomes more and more accurately de - sitter .",
    "this is of course consistent with results of @xcite .",
    "there is a nice universality : no matter what is the local geometry in the bulk the geometry inside the diamond becomes de - sitter when it approaches the future infinity .    at fixed duration @xmath4",
    "the volume of causal diamond in pure de sitter space - time becomes a function of the cosmological constant @xmath10 , v_ds(,)=4 ^ 2(2(6)-^2(6 ) ) .    in models of eternal inflation @xmath104",
    "is taken as a measure of probability of an observer of duration @xmath4 .",
    "thus , we can see how this probability depends on cosmological constant @xmath10 .",
    "as is seen in figure 1 the volume is monotonically decreasing with @xmath10 taking the maximal value at vanishing @xmath10 .",
    "there is an alternative way of looking at the time evolution of the geometry inside the causal diamond . in the limit @xmath105",
    "the diamond is close to the corner formed by cosmological event horizon @xmath106 of the observer that follows the timelike geodesic @xmath12 . inside this corner",
    "one can always take the de - sitter metric in static coordinate system as a background and consider deviations from the de - sitter space as perturbations .",
    "a perturbation is described by a wave equation and takes the form @xmath107 , where @xmath108 satisfies an effective radial shrdinger type equation .",
    "inside the diamond these perturbations tend to escape through the boundaries of the diamond . in a bigger picture",
    "the perturbations dissipate through the event horizon @xmath106 .",
    "the concrete mechanism of the dissipation is given by the quasi - normal modes which are solutions to the gravitational equations for the perturbations subject to condition that they are out - going at the horizon and regular at the origin .",
    "this condition can be satisfied only for a discrete complex set of frequencies @xmath109 . for de - sitter space - time",
    "the gravitational quasi - normal modes have been studied for instance in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "an interesting peculiarity of de - sitter spacetime as compared to a black hole spacetime is that the quasi - normal frequencies are purely imaginary so that they describe the exponential decay only while generically there could be also oscillations is an integer and spacetime is pure de - sitter . on the other hand , as was noted in @xcite the presence of an arbitrary small ( but non - vanishing ) black hole mass prevents @xmath110 from being an integer and leads to a negligible correction to the quasi - normal modes . ] . in d spacetime dimensions",
    "there are two sets of the quasi - normal modes @xcite _ n =- i(l+d-1-q+2n ) ,  _",
    "n =- i(l+q+2n ) ,   where @xmath111 ;  @xmath27 is the angular momentum of the perturbation and the value of @xmath2 depends on the type of the perturbation : @xmath112 for tensor , @xmath113 for vector and @xmath114 for scalar perturbations .",
    "the perturbation of the volume of the causal diamond v=_12g^h _ is determined by a scalar type gravitational perturbation . moreover , since the integration in ( [ 21 ] ) includes integration over spherical angles then only @xmath115 may contribute to the time evolution of the volume .",
    "let us now compare the two sets ( for @xmath116 ) of frequencies ( [ 20 ] ) with our direct calculation ( [ 16 ] ) .",
    "doing this one should keep in mind the relation between global and static coordinate systems .",
    "one has that @xmath117 , where @xmath118 is time coordinate in static coordinate system and @xmath50 is time coordinate in the global coordinate system . inside the diamond @xmath79 changes in the finite limits .",
    "therefore , for large times @xmath119 .",
    "we see that the set in ( [ 20 ] ) in which @xmath110 is an odd number does not show up in the evolution of the volume .",
    "at least this is true for the few lowest frequencies . on the other hand , the second set ,",
    "in which @xmath110 is even number , indeed appears in the evolution of the volume .",
    "we have repeated the calculation in the previous section for arbitrary @xmath120 .",
    "then the lowest decaying ( and , possibly , non - vanishing ) term in the volume ( [ 16 ] ) is of order @xmath93 .",
    "this is again consistent with the second set of quasi - normal frequencies in ( [ 20 ] ) .",
