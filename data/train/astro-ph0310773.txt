    "the cluster @xmath3 centauri ( ngc 5139 ) has many unique characteristics amongst galactic globular clusters ( ggcs ) .",
    "it is the most luminous and massive cluster in the galaxy ( harris 1996 ; meylan et al .",
    "1995 ) , and one of the most flattened clusters ( meylan 1987 ; white & shawl 1987 ) which must have resulted from its significant rotation ( meylan & mayor 1986 ; mayor et al . 1997 ; merrit , meylan , & mayor 1997 ) .",
    "the most intriguing and peculiar feature of @xmath3 cen is the wide spread of metallicity .",
    "the majority of ggcs show homogeneity in iron - peak elements , while often exhibiting large variations in the lighter elements such as cno , na , mg , and al ( suntzeff 1993 ; kraft 1994 ) .",
    "however , unlike other gcs , @xmath3 cen shows star - to - star abundance variations of the iron - peak elements .",
    "dickens & woolley ( 1967 ) first noted the chemical inhomogenity of stars in @xmath3 cen , from the large color width of the red giant branch ( rgb ) stars in the cmd shown by the photographic photometry of woolley ( 1966 ) , which was later confirmed by cannon & stobie ( 1973 ) .",
    "freeman & rodgers ( 1975 ) and butler , dickens , & epps ( 1978 ) also confirmed a diversity of chemical composition from the rr lyrae variables in this cluster ( see also gratton , tornambe , & ortolani 1986 ; rey et al . 2000 ) .",
    "recently , a series of spectroscopic studies for large samples of the rgb stars in @xmath3 cen verified the range in abundances and derived detailed abundance patterns ( e.g. , brown & wallerstein 1993 ; vanture , wallerstein , & brown 1994 ; norris & da costa 1995 ; smith , cunha , & lambert 1995 ; norris , freeman , & mighell 1996 ; suntzeff & kraft 1996 ; smith et al . 2000 ; pancino et al .",

    "; origlia et al .",
    "it has been reported that the abundance of iron spans a range from [ fe / h ] @xmath7 -2.0 up to -0.5 , along with high abundance of the s - process elements over the whole [ fe / h ] range .",
    "it also appears that this anomaly of chemical inhomogeneity found in @xmath3 cen is closely linked to the kinematics and spatial distribution of the stars .",
    "norris et al .",
    "( 1997 ) found that the metal - rich rgb stars are more centrally concentrated and furthermore show evidence for different velocity dispersion and rotation properties compared to the dominating population of more metal - poor stars .",
    "the metal - poor population rotates , but the metal - rich stars do not . from this apparent difference in kinematics between the metal - poor and the metal - rich stars , as well as a second peak in the metallicity distribution",
    ", they suggested a merger of two clusters as a possible origin of @xmath3 cen .",
    "the difference in spatial distribution between different metallicity populations is also confirmed by successive studies ( jurcsik 1998 ; pancino et al .",
    "2000 , 2003 ; hilker & richtler 2000 ; see also freeman 1985 ) .",
    "most recently , ferraro , bellazzini , & pancino ( 2002 ) suggested that the newly discovered metal - rich rgb stars with [ fe / h ] @xmath7 -0.6 may have a different proper motion distribution that is not compatible with that of the dominant metal - poor population of @xmath3 cen , while platais et al .",
    "( 2003 ) commented that this could arise as a spurious effect in the proper motion determination .",
    "the close connection of metal abundance to the kinematics and spatial distribution of stars in @xmath3 cen would provide some important constraints for its star formation and chemical enrichment histories when combined with wide - field high precision photometric data .",
    "the first comprehensive and wide - field photographic study for @xmath3 cen was undertaken by woolley ( 1966 ) .",
    "it remained the only wide - field study of @xmath3 cen for more than three decades .",
    "he , and co - workers , obtained a cmd for several thousand stars which extends to about 1 mag fainter than the horizontal branch ( hb ) , however the photometric errors for even bright rgb stars were somewhat large .",
    "these data are too shallow to allow accurate study of the properties of various populations in this cluster , despite being spatially complete .",
    "recent wide field studies were initiated by lee et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , who obtained high - precision homogeneous @xmath0 ccd cmds for more than 130,000 stars in the field toward @xmath3  cen , which represents one of the most extensive photometric surveys to date for this cluster ( see also pancino et al . 2000 ; hilker & richtler 2000 ; majewski et al .",
    "lee et al .",
    "( 1999 ) discovered multiple rgbs , especially noteworthy being a red , metal - rich ( [ fe / h ] @xmath7 -0.5 ) sequence well separated from other , bluer , metal - poor ones in the cmd .",
    "this feature was not evident in previous photometry due to larger photometric uncertainties ( e.g. , woolley 1966 ) and usually much smaller sample sizes . an independent survey by pancino et al .",
    "( 2000 ) confirmed the reality of this discovery .",
    "furthermore , the most metal - rich population in @xmath3  cen appears to be a few billion years younger than the most metal - poor ( [ fe / h ] @xmath7 -1.8 ) population in this system ( lee et al .",
    "1999 ; hughes & wallerstein 2000 ; hilker & richtler 2000 ) .",
    "the multimodal metallicity distribution function and the apparent age - metallicity relation would suggest that the protocluster of @xmath3  cen was massive enough to undergo some self - enrichment ( e.g. , suntzeff & kraft 1996 ; ikuta & arimoto 2000 ) and several early bursts of star formation with a variable rate .",
    "this suggests that @xmath3  cen evolved within a dwarf galaxy size gas - rich subsystem until it merged and disrupted with our galaxy a few billion years after the formation of its first generation of metal - poor stars , leaving its core as today s gc @xmath3  cen ( freeman 1993 ; norris et al .",

    "1999 ; majewski et al .",
    "2000 ; hughes & wallerstein 2000 ; hilker & richtler 2000 ) .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that there is similarity in the distinct appearance of multiple stellar populations with an internal age - metallicity relation for both @xmath3 cen and the sagittarius dwarf galaxy ( sarajedini & layden 1995 ; layden & sarajedini 1997 , 2000 ; bellazzini et al .",
    "1999a , 1999b ) ; the latter includes m54 , the second most massive ggc as its nucleus and is now in a process of tidal disruption by the milky way , leading eventually to a complete merger .    in this paper , we discuss our photometry of @xmath3 cen , which is the same data set used in the preliminary study by lee et al .",

    "we covered nine regions in a 3 @xmath10 3 grid of @xmath3 cen through the johnson @xmath11 and @xmath12 filters , and observed 6 to 8 sequences of this grid per night . in total , 40 to 42 frames were taken in each filter and each field .",
    "our whole program field , centered on the cluster , encompasses approximately a @xmath13 arcmin@xmath9 area of @xmath3 cen , which approximates the area enclosed by the half - tidal radius .",
    "exposure times were 180 sec and 120 sec for @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively .",
    "the seeing was between 1.0 and 1.7 arcsec , and all of the observing nights were fully photometric .",

    "the raw ccd frames were processed by zero - level subtraction followed by sky flat - field division using the iraf quadproc routines to take into account the four amplifiers used .",
    "all exposure times were sufficiently long so that the center - to - corner shutter timing error was negligible . typically , these procedures produced object frames flattened to better than 0.7% .",
    "each of the 40 - 42 ccd frames for each filter and each field was reduced separately using the daophot ii and allstar photometry package ( stetson 1987 , 1995 ) . between 50 and 100 bright and isolated stars",
    "were used to construct the point - spread function ( psf ) for each frame .",
    "the shape of the psf was made to vary quadratically with radial position in the frame .",
    "the mean difference between the psf - based magnitude and the total magnitude of selected psf stars was calculated , and this aperture correction was applied to psf - based instrumental magnitude for every star in each frame .",
    "the daomatch / daomaster programs ( stetson 1992 ) were then used to match stars of all frames for each filter and each field , and to derive their average instrumental magnitudes and rms scatters , keeping only those stars that were detected in at least 20 frames for each filter and each field . finally , the mean instrumental @xmath11 and @xmath12 magnitudes were matched to form the @xmath14 color .    on each night ,",
    "standard stars from the list of landolt ( 1992 ) were observed to derive coefficients of the transformation equations between the instrumental magnitudes and the standard system magnitudes .",
    "the 33 standard stars observed cover @xmath14 and @xmath12 ranges of -0.27 to 1.91 and 11.08 to 15.02 , respectively .",
    "the atmospheric extinction coefficients in each color have been determined by the same standard stars at different air masses .",

    "the details of observations and data reductions for these frames are described in rey et al .",
    "we used these photometric data in order to discriminate the foreground galactic field stars from the @xmath3 cen member stars using different distributions in the @xmath4[=@xmath5 vs. @xmath6 diagram ( see section 3.2 ) .",
    "we compared our @xmath0 ccd photometry with data taken from other studies for the stars in common .",

    "3.2 ) , we matched @xmath0 photometric data with those from @xmath1 & strmgren @xmath2 photometry .",

    "1995 ; kaluzny et al .",
    "1996 , 1997 ) , obviously complicates the interpretation of the data for some interesting sequences such as the red horizontal - branch ( rhb ) , the asymptotic giant - branch ( agb ) , and the rgb .",
    "the field star contamination can be minimized by using the metallicity - sensitive @xmath4 index , defined as @xmath21 from the @xmath1 & strmgren @xmath2 photometric system ( anthony - twarog et al . 1991 ; twarog & anthony - twarog 1995 ; anthony - twarog & twarog 1998 ) .",

    "as shown in the @xmath24 @xmath25 of figure 6 , at a given @xmath6 , more metal - rich stars are offset from the metal - poor ones by virtue of a larger @xmath4 index , therefore an upper envelope line which differentiates field stars can be drawn .",

    "the radial distribution of the field star candidates is uniform and is significantly different from that of the @xmath3 cen rgb sequence , which confirms that most of our selected field star candidates are in fact not members of @xmath3 cen ( see fig .",

    "2002 ) .    in order to investigate the nature of the rgb , in figure 8 , we plot histograms of the rgb color distribution for two magnitude ranges ( 12.5 @xmath20 @xmath12 @xmath20 13.0 and 13.0 @xmath20 @xmath12 @xmath20 13.5 ) .",

    "the presence of three pronounced rgbs [ i.e. , most metal - poor ( mmp ) , metal - poor ( mp ) , and metal - rich ( mr ) rgbs ] can be identified , while the mmr component is not as well distinguished as it is in the cmds due to the small sample size of such stars in these magnitude ranges .",
    "because the intrinsic color of the rgb will vary with its metallicity , we obtained mean [ fe / h ] abundances for the four main components using the relation between [ fe / h ] and @xmath31 at fixed magnitude , based on the data of ggcs compiled by ferraro et al .",

    "these properties of @xmath3 cen are also consistent with the characteristics of local group dwarf spheroidal galaxies , which are known to have complex star formation histories with extended timescales , and clearly distinct from the single age and metallicity characteristics of a typical ggc ( mateo 1998 ; van den bergh 1999 ; grebel 2001 ) .    the relatively extended enrichment period of @xmath7 4 gyrs then indicates that the initial evolution of @xmath3  cen occurred away from the dense central regions of the young milky way because at smaller galactocentric distances , such as the current location of @xmath3  cen , we would expect the gaseous materials to have been stripped from the proto @xmath3  cen on a much shorter timescale as a result of disk shocking or similar processes .",

    "( 2002 ) suggested that the mmr stars were part of a small independent stellar system that has been accreted by the proto larger @xmath3 cen .",
    "they propose this idea as an example of hierarchical merging on the subgalactic scale .    alternatively ,",
    "the observational results of cold kinematics and central concentration for more metal - rich stars with respect to the metal - poor ones can lead to the speculation that the mmr stars were formed from the chemically enriched gas which has selectively low angular momentum and was moved to the center of the cluster ( norris et al .",
    "1997 ; freeman 2002 ) .",
    "this may be possible from the barlike asymmetry in the inner region which occurred in the process of the interactions between @xmath3 cen and the milky way ( norris et al . 1997 ; mayer et al .",
    "2001a , 2001b ) .",
    "close to the pericentric passage , @xmath3 cen could develop a central bar , allowing part of the gas to funnel into the center of @xmath3 cen and generating one burst of star formation .",
    "stars in this central region could more efficiently lose their angular momentum because of the bar instability ( mayer et al .",
    "2001a , 2001b ) .",
    "probably the past  tidally stirred \" interaction between @xmath3 cen and the milky way has disrupted the previously smooth and well - ordered distributions of the metal - poor populations in @xmath3 cen and made it more efficient to trigger star formation of the mmr stars .",
    "if this is the case , the overall star formation of @xmath3 cen must be an outside - in process .",
    "the initial star formation of the old mpp and mp populations occurred over the whole proto @xmath3 cen far away from the young milky way , and susequent bursts of the young and more metal - rich populations were progressively more centrally concentrated , which may be dynamically connected to interactions with the milky way ( mayer et al .",
    "2001a , 2001b ; see also strader et al .",
    "2003 for the fornax dwarf galaxy ) .",
    "if the mmr population was formed during the accretion to the milky way , the age of the mmr population may provide a hint of time taken for @xmath3 cen to be accreted into the galaxy .    while the detailed mechanism of star formation in @xmath3 cen is not currently clear , all of above information strongly suggest that @xmath3  cen is a relict or nucleus of a disrupted dwarf galaxy .",
    "the cases of @xmath3  cen and the sagittarius dwarf system therefore provide direct evidence for past and continuing accretion of protogalactic fragments , which suggest that similar accretion events may have continued throughout the history of milky way formation in the context of surviving `` building blocks '' of large galaxies ( e.g. , searle & zinn 1978 ; larson 1988 ; zinn 1993 ) .      finally , it is of interest to note that @xmath3 cen and m54 , now proposed as possible nuclei or parts of disrupted dwarf galaxies , are respectively the most massive gc and second most massive gc in our galaxy .",
    "thus it is interesting to examine other massive gcs for indications that they have similar histories , and of these ngc 6388 and ngc 6441 deserve detailed examination .",
    "they are the 3rd and 5th most massive ggcs , respectively , and they both have very peculiar bimodal hb distributions . in particular , they show color spreads among the rgb stars which appear to be larger than the effects expected from photometric errors and differential reddenings ( rich et al .",
    "moreover , recent studies also have suggested a possible intrinsic spread in metallicity of these two clusters , although direct star by star metallicity determinations need to be made ( piotto et al .",

    "2001 ; sweigart 2002 ) .",
    "our population models for these unusual clusters show that the adoption of two distinct populations within the systems and very mild internal age - metallicity relations between the two populations can reproduce the observed features on the hb and the rgb ( ree et al . 2002 ; yoon , ree , and lee 2003 ) .",
    "the age and metallicity spreads , required to reproduce their cmd morphologies , are only about 1.2 gyr and 0.15 dex for both clusters .",
    "this conclusion is also supported by the fact that the mean period of rr lyrae variables in these clusters are too long for their high metallicities ( [ fe / h ] @xmath7 -0.5 - -0.6 , pritzl et al . 2000 ) , which is understood in the two populations scenario if the rr lyraes are highly evolved stars from the older and metal - poor bhb population .",
    "it is worth noting that the most recent observations of the gc g1 in m31 , which is more than twice as massive as @xmath3 cen , also shows intrinsic metallicity dispersion ( meylan et al .",

    "<S> the hb distribution is also found to be consistent with the multiple stellar populations of the rgb . from our population models , </S>",
    "<S> we propose that the most metal - rich population is about 4 gyr younger than the dominant metal - poor population , indicating that @xmath3 cen was enriched over this timescale . </S>",
    "<S> we identify , for the first time , a continuous and slanting rgb bump in the cmd of @xmath3 cen , which is due to the metallicity spread amongst the rgb stars . </S>",

    "<S> the discovery of several populations and the internal age - metallicity relation of @xmath3 cen provides good evidence that @xmath3  cen was once part of a more massive system that merged with the milky way , as the sagittarius dwarf galaxy is in the process of doing at the present time . </S>"
