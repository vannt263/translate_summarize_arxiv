    "the hubble space telescope ( hst ) archival pure parallel program , started in 1997 shortly after the second hubble servicing mission , was implemented to provide the maximum amount of science possible with hst and its primary cameras : the wide  field planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) , the near - infrared camera and multi  object spectrograph ( nicmos ) , and the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) . during observations of a target by the primary instrument ,",
    "the other instruments make a preplanned series of observations in nearby fields , the positions of which are determined by the focal plane offset of the instrument and the roll angle of hst .",
    "the resulting observations are placed in the hubble data archive at the space telescope science institute , and are made immediately available to the astronomical community .",
    "the stis parallels include broadband camera images and full field slitless spectroscopy .",
    "full details of the stis parallel survey ( sps ) capabilities and techniques can be found in gardner et al .",
    "the imaging mode has a very broad bandpass ( fwhm @xmath3 5000 ) peaking at 5500  and ranging from @xmath3 2500  to 10300 .",
    "the full field spectroscopy mode has a wavelength range of 5200  to 10300 , and a dispersion of 4.9  per pixel . in an imaging mode observation of 2000 seconds , point sources as faint",
    "as @xmath4 can be detected with a s / n of 5 , and the spectra can achieve a limiting magnitude of 22 under the same circumstances .    approximately 6000 stis parallel images and spectra were taken in the first year of the parallel program , comprising more than 1000 separate fields .",
    "of these , over 300 images and spectra are of the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) .",
    "these data represent a unique opportunity to peer deeply into the lmc and investigate many of its physical properties .",
    "planetary nebulae ( pne , singular pn ) provide a way to study several important properties of the lmc , including kinematics ( vassiliadis , meatheringham & dopita 1992 ) , dynamical and chemical evolution and can also be used as distance indicators ( for example , feldmeier , ciardullo & jacoby 1997 and references therein ) .",
    "nearly 300 pne have been found in the lmc ( leisy et al .",
    "lmc pne are of particular importance in the determination of the pne luminosity function , since they all lie at approximately the same distance .",
    "unfortunately , the great distance to the lmc means that most pne are very faint and unresolvable by ground based telescopes , and the typically crowded lmc fields make studying the pne very difficult .    the high spatial resolution of hst and low sky background of earth orbit provide an advantage for studying lmc pne ( for example , dopita et al .",
    "in particular , stis can record spatially resolved spectra of the larger , fainter pne . here",
    "we report on the serendipitous stis parallel observations of the planetary nebula m9420 , first discovered by morgan ( 1994 ) in a ground  based emission line survey of the lmc .",
    "the stis camera mode images clearly resolve the nebula to be @xmath32 arcseconds in diameter and also detect the central star .",
    "the spectra provide identification of several emission lines in the nebula .",
    "the low resolution of the stis spectra together with the relatively large angular extent of the nebula blends the nebular diagnostic emission lines , but the images and spectra are still a useful tool in investigating extragalactic pne and can be used to plan followup observations , both ground and space  based .",
    "six images and two spectra were taken of the field containing the planetary nebula m94 - 20 .",
    "the total exposure times were 1100 and 1200 seconds for the images and spectra , respectively .",
    "the observations were taken as part of the stis archival pure parallel program , hst program i d 7783 , s. baum , principal investigator .",
    "wfpc2 was the prime instrument during the stis parallels , observing the lmc as part of the hst program `` star formation history of the large magellanic cloud '' , hst i d 7382 , smecker ",
    "hane , principal investigator .",
    "the primary target was lmc - disk1 at @xmath5  and  @xmath6 .",
    "stis was located approximately five arcminutes north of wfpc2 during the observations .",
    "the stis parallel images were formatted as 1024x1024 arrays ( one pixel = 0051 ) , while the spectra were automatically binned onchip in the y  direction to 1024x512 ( one pixel = 0051 in the spectral direction , and 0102 in the spatial direction ) .",
    "the observations were taken over two orbits , and there was a 08 ( 15.5 stis ccd pixels ) telescope slew to the southwest between the two sets of observations .",
    "the offsets between images were determined by cross  correlating a small subsection in each , which were then used to shift and combine the images .",
    "the offsets were applied with appropriate binning to the spectra which were shifted and combined as well .",
    "the images and full field spectra were processed using stis investigation definition team pipeline calibration software which performs basic data reduction steps such as bias and dark current subtraction .",
    "the observation particulars are shown in table 1 .",
    "for the analysis using the imaging mode , the sky background was subtracted by taking a simple median of the area near the pn .",
    "the background in the full field spectral image was subtracted from the spectrum using a column  by  column median , employing sigma  clipping to remove the positive bias of the stellar contamination .",
    "figure 1 shows the full field processed image containing m9420 .",
    "the pn is located at the top of the image , centered roughly in the horizontal ( x  axis ) direction .",
    "north is to the left and east is down ; we display the image in this way so that it has the same sense as the spectrum , which disperses light along the x  direction . though close to the detector edge",
    ", the nebula is located fully inside the image .",
    "note the small irregular galaxy located 9 arcseconds to the north of m9420 , and another located 22 arcseconds to the south .",
    "although both lie in the dispersion direction of the pn , neither interferes significantly with the spectrum .",
    "the bright diagonal line in the image is a diffraction spike from a star located just off the detector , and the circular features near bright stars are internal reflections in stis .",
    "the inset shows a close  up of just the nebula .",
    "the pn , unresolved in the discovery survey ( morgan 1994 ) , is clearly resolved in the stis image .",
    "the measured properties of the nebula and central star ( see section 3.2 ) are listed in table 2 .",
    "the nebula is slightly elliptical , with a mean diameter of roughly 2 arcseconds , making this one of the largest pne in the lmc .",
    "most lmc pne are smaller than 1 arcsecond in diameter , with the notable exception of lmc ",
    "smp72 , a bipolar pn measuring approximately 2 x 3 arcseconds ( dopita et al .",
    "m9420 has a bright elliptical rim , and the outermost parts of the nebula also show some faint structure , reminiscent of the double  elliptical structure of ngc 6543 ( aka the `` cat s eye '' ) .",
    "one of the outer ellipses is aligned with the inner rim , while the other has a position angle of @xmath7 .",
    "the large angular extent of the pn implies that this is an evolved object .",
    "a subarray of the spectrum containing m9420 is shown in figure 2 ( _ top _ ) .",
    "the extracted subarray covers the full spectral range of the original spectrum , but only 32 pixels ( @xmath8 ) in the spatial direction .",
    "the stars in the image appear as sources of continuum , while m9420 is clearly an emission  line object .",
    "figure 2 ( _ middle _ ) shows a closeup of the nebular spectrum from 6000  to 7200  as well as the positions of the line images using ellipses with major and minor axes corresponding to those measured in the camera mode image ( _ bottom _ ) .",
    "the bright elliptical patch corresponds to the lines of h@xmath9 and [ nii ] in m9420 . at this resolution ,",
    "the [ nii ] 6548  and 6584lines are separated from h@xmath9 by only 3 and 4 pixels , respectively .",
    "the nebula itself is about 40 pixels or ten times that size , so the three spectral line images overlap .",
    "the blended nebular spectral image is about 4 pixels wider than the nebular image in the camera mode , also indicating that more than one line is present .",
    "the [ oi ] line at 6300  is also clearly seen .",
    "the [ sii ] 6717 , 6731  emission line images are barely detected in the spectrum .",
    "we also note that we may have a detection of [ siii ] 9069  and pa@xmath10,[siii ] at 9545 , which does not reproduce well in figure 2 but can be seen very faintly in the original data .",
    "we flux calibrated the brighter emission lines using the absolute sensitivity of stis for a point source ( collins and bohlin 1998 ) , correcting the sensitivity curve for a slitless spectrum of an extended line emission object , and masking out the continuum spectra of nearby stars that overlapped the pn spectrum .",
    "we find that the total observed h@xmath9 + [ nii ] 6548 , 6584  flux is @xmath11 .",
    "d. morgan and q. parker ( 1998 , private communication ) made followup observations of many of the pne found by morgan ( 1994 ) , and for m9420 detected [ oiii ] 4959 , 5007and h@xmath9 .",
    "they report the [ oiii ] flux to be @xmath12 . the value of the ratio of h@xmath9 + [ nii ] 6548 , 6584  to [ oiii ] 4959 ,",
    "5007   in lmc pne is typically 34 ( for example , vassiliadis , dopita , morgan and bell 1992 ) ; which is somewhat lower than but consistent with these measurements .",
    "the typical value of the ratio of [ oi ] 6300  to h@xmath9 in lmc pne is approximately 0.07 .",
    "we find the [ oi ] 6300  flux is @xmath13 , which again gives a ratio higher than but consistent with the typical value .",
    "morgan and parker also find an upper limit to the h@xmath14 flux of @xmath15 , making m9420 a relatively faint lmc pn ( vassiliadis , dopita , morgan and bell 1992 ) .",
    "we note that our measurements may also be upper limits , since background subtraction is difficult due to the stellar spectra superposed on the pn spectrum .",
    "the detection of [ sii ] 6717 , 6731  is very weak and is complicated by their proximity to the h@xmath9 + [ nii ] 6548 , 6584  lines .",
    "we subtracted a linear fit to the slope of the wing of the h@xmath9 + [ nii ] lines to find the total flux of the [ sii ] lines , and get an upper limit of @xmath16 .",
    "the emission lines from the pn are remarkably featureless spatially , given the obvious structure in the camera mode image .",
    "the spectral mode of stis has a blue cutoff at @xmath175300 , while the imaging mode goes down to @xmath172000 .",
    "the imaging mode will therefore detect the lines of h@xmath14 , the [ oii ] doublet at 3727 and 3729 , and the lines of [ oiii ] at 4959 , 5007 .",
    "the emission lines seen in the imaging mode but not in the spectroscopic mode must account for these features .",
    "the central star , as well as two other superposed stars , are clearly visible in the camera mode image .",
    "relative to the fine guidance sensor guide stars , we find the j2000 coordinates of the central star are @xmath18 , in good agreement with those found in leisy et al .",
    "the spectrum of the star is too weak to determine a temperature , so we used the camera mode sensitivity of stis to flux calibrate blackbody models of 20000k , 40000k and 100000k .",
    "the calibrated models were then folded into a johnson v filter bandpass to find the v magnitude of the star .",
    "we found the central star magnitude to be @xmath1 .",
    "the sensitivity of stis in the imaging mode drops rapidly with decreasing wavelength , so the calculated magnitude does not depend strongly on the temperature of the star .",
    "given the magnitude and a distance to the lmc of 55 kpc , we find that the luminosity of the central star is 0.09 solar , and @xmath19 for a typical white dwarf radius of @xmath20 .",
    "the low temperature indicates this may be a relatively old white dwarf , which is consistent with the evolved nature of the pn .",
    "there are approximately 300 known pne in the lmc ( leisy et al .",
    "the number density is highest near the bar and tapers off rapidly with distance ( morgan 1994 ) .",
    "m9420 lies over a degree from the bar , near the edge of the lmc .",
    "over 300 observations comprising 70 separate fields have been taken in the lmc by stis .",
    "of these , 29 also have associated full field spectra , enhancing the ability to detect candidate pne ( i.e. , emission line objects ) clearly .",
    "the detection limit of an observation depends most strongly on the brightness and the size of the nebula in a given emission line and the integration time .",
    "the 1200 second exposure of the m9420 observations is fairly typical of parallels , and noting that the [ sii ] 6717 , 6731  emission lines in the nebula are barely detected , we expect to detect any nebula the size of m9420 brighter than about @xmath21 in a line for a typical lmc pn . a smaller nebula would be detectable at fainter limits , with the brightness scaling inversely with the area .",
    "we note here again that m9420 is a relatively faint , large lmc pn .",
    "no other previously catalogued lmc pne have been observed by stis in the parallel survey .",
    "we have processed and examined the other fields in the lmc and also 20 stis fields in the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) and have found no other extended pne to within the detection limits , catalogued or otherwise , although large hii regions are common and easily detected . unresolved or partially resolved pne are difficult to identify in this case because most of the full  field spectra in the lmc and smc are either single observations or have one cosmic ray split ( that is , two observations without telescope movement ) , making the differentiation of sharp spectral features from cosmic rays and hot pixels difficult .",
    "we note here that in many other fields , stis observations have two or more cosmic ray splits , making unresolved pn detection relatively easier .",
    "we have also searched the relevant wfpc2 parallel fields ; no known lmc or smc pne are located within these parallel survey fields . discovering previously unrecorded pne using wfpc2 parallels is more difficult due to the lack of unambiguous spectral information in the broad passbands used .",
    "although the odds of finding pne in the random stis parallels are low for the lmc or smc , we are encouraged by the observations of m9420 .",
    "the ability of stis to get deep , spatially resolved spectra makes it an excellent instrument for tagging objects for further deep ground ",
    "based spectroscopy .",
    "stis parallels will continue to be taken in the magellanic clouds , and it is only a matter of time before additional pne are observed .",
    "interestingly , pne in nearby galaxies can also be detected in stis parallels , although this becomes a difficult process as pne at that distance are no longer resolved spatially .",
    "however , it also means that the larger volumes of space on the scale of the host galaxy are observed as well .",
    "ground  based surveys using narrow passband filters centered on [ oiii ] 5007  and h@xmath9 have found many pn candidates in m31 and m33 ( ciardullo et al .",
    "1989 ; bohannan , conti & massey 1985 ) .",
    "we made a preliminary search of stis parallel fields in m31 and ngc 205 which yielded several emission lines objects .",
    "at least one of these objects is a planetary nebula , even though only a small fraction of the surface area of those galaxies has been observed .",
    "a similar search in m33 fields has also resulted in several detections .",
    "these observations are awaiting ground  based followups to get spectra with wavelength coverage that includes @xmath22 and [ oiii ] 5007  to help distinguish pne from hii regions .",
    "future stis parallels will undoubtedly find more pne , especially if the narrow [ oii ] 3727  and [ oiii ] 5007  filters are used in imaging mode in conjunction with the g430l grating , which has a bandpass that includes these emission lines .",
    "we note finally that the use of stis parallels goes well beyond that of finding ( or adding to our knowledge of pre  existing ) pne .",
    "moderate redshift galaxy counts ( gardner et al . 1998 ) , research on stellar population counts , low mass stars ( plait 1999 ) , globular clusters in nearby galaxies , and many other fields can benefit from a relatively simple search of the parallel archive .",
    "since the data already exist and are publically accessible , the stis parallels are a excellent tool that should be exploited to their fullest extent .",
    "figure 2. ( _ top _ ) a subarray of the full field spectrum containing m9420 .",
    "the subarray covers the full spectral range of the original spectrum , and 32 pixels ( @xmath8 ) in the spatial direction .",
    "several emission lines can be seen in this log scale image , while stars appear as streaks .",
    "the close  up of the region from 6000  to 7200   is also shown ( _ middle _ ) along with a schematic of the positions of the detected emission lines ( _ bottom _ ) .",
