    "the flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) processes in the @xmath10 transition are sensitive to the effects of new physics ( np ) beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "recently , both cdf and d collaborations have announced their measurements of extracted cp violating phase @xmath11 associated with @xmath0 mixing @xcite . the cp violating phase measured by both cdf and d is @xmath12 $ ] at 95% c.l .",
    "@xcite , which is much larger than its sm value @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "more recently , the d collaboration has reported evidence for an anomalously large cp violation in the like - sign dimuon charge asymmetry in semileptonic b - hadron decays @xmath14 @xcite , which differs by 3.2 standard deviations from the sm prediction @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "although the errors of the data are still large , these deviations from the sm could be attributed to the presence of non - sm flavor violationin the @xmath16 nonleptonic decays .",
    "recently , the cdf collaboration has made the first measurement of charmless two - body @xmath17 decay , @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "the measurement is important for understanding @xmath19 physics , and also implies that many @xmath19 decay modes could be precisely measured at the lhc - b . comparing with the theoretical predictions for these observables in refs .",
    "@xcite , one would find that the experimental measurements of branching ratio are in agreement with the sm predictions within their large theoretical uncertainties .",
    "however , np effects would be still possible to render other observable deviated from the sm expectation with the branching ratios nearly unaltered @xcite .",
    "supersymmetry ( susy ) is an extension of the sm , which emerges as one of the promising candidates for np beyond the sm . in general susy ,",
    "a new source of flavor violation is introduced by the squark mass matrices , which usually can not be diagonalized on the same basis as the quark mass matrices .",
    "this means gluinos ( and other gauginos ) will have flavor - changing couplings to quarks and squarks , which implies the fcncs could be mediated by gluinos and thus have strong interaction strength .",
    "it is customary to rotate the effects so they occur in squark propagators rather than in couplings , and to parameterize them in terms of dimensionless mass insertion ( mi ) parameters @xmath20 with @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "@xmath23 mixing , @xmath1 and @xmath24 decays are all induced by the @xmath25 transition , and they involve the same set of the mi parameters .",
    "inspired by the recent measurements from cdf and d collaborations , we study @xmath23 mixing , @xmath1 and @xmath24 decays in the usual mi approximation @xcite of general susy models , where flavor violation due to the gluino mediation can be important .",
    "the chargino - stop and the charged higgs - top loop contributions are parametrically suppressed relative to the gluino contributions , and thus are ignored following @xcite . following the similar way to our previous article @xcite",
    ", we consider the ll , rr , lr and rl four kinds of the mis with @xmath26 , respectively .",
    "we find that the ll and rr insertions for all cases of @xmath27 values as well as the lr insertion for @xmath7 case could explain current experimental data simultaneously . for @xmath7 ,",
    "the constrained lr mi could significantly affect all observables of @xmath1 decays except @xmath28 without conflict with all related data at 95% c.l . while the constrained ll and rr insertions from @xmath23 mixing have small effects in @xmath1",
    "decays because of the absence of gluino mass enhancement .",
    "therefore , with the ongoing @xmath29-physics at tevatron , in particular with the onset of the lhc - b experiment , we expect a wealth of @xmath30 data and measurements of these observables could restrict or reveal the parameter spaces of the lr ( ll and rr ) insertions in the near future .",
