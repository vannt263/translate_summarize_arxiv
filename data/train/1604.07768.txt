    "from the way graphene is prepared it is quite plausible that disorder is ubiquitous in it .",
    "defect based nano - engineering of graphinic structures have always focused on tubular forms @xcite@xmath0 @xcite in addition to sheets .",
    "not only local defects like adatoms or vacancies but also extended defects like stone - wales @xcite or patches of other allotropes in a pristine graphene background have been studied @xcite@xmath0@xcite .",
    "first principle studies of extended defects have been beyond the scope of mean - field approaches .",
    "the most successful among these , the coherent potential approximation ( cpa ) can study only very local disorder .",
    "the alternative supercell approaches always lead to sharp bands , or the singularities of the spectral function are _ always _ real .",
    "this is because on some length scale ( size of the super - cell ) lattice translation symmetry and bloch s theorem still hold .",
    "any estimate of disorder related life - times or band broadening requires smoothening with external parameters . in that sense",
    "the approach is not fully ab - initio .",
    "however , the purely real space based recursion method , proposed by the cambridge group @xcite , appears to be ideally suited for the study of such extended defects .",
    "it is surprising that its use has been rather limited in this particular area of study .",
    "we shall present here a recursion based study of such defects and their influence on the electronic structure of graphene nano - tubes . .",
    "the recursion method @xcite@xmath0@xcite introduced by heine and co - workers is a powerful alternative to the bloch theorem based techniques and comes to its own when bloch theorem is violated .",
    "a large body of work exist using the recursion method on the study of systems like plane and rough surfaces@xcite@xmath0@xcite and interfaces@xcite , defects and dopants , disordered alloys @xcite , amorphous networks @xcite@xmath1@xcite and frustrated spin systems@xcite .",
    "-0.4 cm      the left panel ( a ) in fig.[grph ] shows a pristine two - dimensional honeycomb structure .",
    "if we fold this about x - axis then we obtain a zigzag type nanotube ( fig.[grph ] middle panel ( b ) ) . whereas folding about y - axis leads to a nanotube of the armchair type @xcite@xmath1 @xcite@xmath0@xcite ( fig.[grph ] right panel ( c ) ) .",
    "a general identification of the type of nanotube is given by chiral vectors .",
    "a zigzag type nanotube is described by @xmath2 and and armchair type by @xmath3 .",
    "fig.[grph](b ) is a ( 6,0 ) and fig.[grph](c ) is a ( 3,3 ) nanotube .",
    "electronic properties of these two types have been investigated by other techniques before and accordingly zigzag type nanotubes are called semiconductor nanotubes and armchair types are known as metallic nanotubes @xcite .",
    "we studied the electronic properties of these two types with and without stone - wales ( s - w ) defects .",
    "stone - wales ( s - w ) defects @xcite@xmath0@xcite are pure geometrical extended defects which occur due to rotation of two neighbouring atoms shown in red in fig.[defects ] , followed by rebonding of the dangling bonds so produced .. a single s - w defect spreads over sixteen atoms and transforms four adjacent hexagonal cells into two pentagonal and two heptagonal cells shown in green in fig.[defects](a ) . in a double s - w defect , twenty four atoms are involved and six adjacent hexagonal cells transform into one rhombic , two pentagonal and four heptagonal cells shown in green in fig.[defects](b ) .",
    "the elements of the representation of the tight binding anderson hamiltonian @xcite have been obtained first from an ab - initio , self - consistent , tight - binding linear muffin - tin orbitals technique ( tb - lmto)@xcite@xmath0@xcite .",

    "our interest is in the @xmath7 sector only .",
    "we then use the n - th order muffin - tin orbital ( nmto method ) @xcite@xmath1@xcite and massively downfold to obtain the @xmath7 hamiltonian .",
    "@xmath8 0.5 cm the nmto hamiltonian for the @xmath7 sector of c    @xmath9    where the site labelled basis @xmath10 is used for representation , @xmath11 refer to nearest neighbour pairs in the material and @xmath12 .",
    "the recursion transformation of basis from @xmath13 to @xmath14 , which converts the tight - binding hamiltonian into a jacobian matrix has been described in great detail by haydock _ et.al .",

    "note that there is absolutely no symmetry restriction on the matrix : no translation symmetry or local geometric symmetries .",
    "it is enough that the basis is denumerable .",
    "the recursion method does not necessarily invoke the bloch theorem and therein lies its strength .",
    "@xmath15    now , the diagonal element of green s function in matrix representation given as : @xmath16    the terminator @xmath17 is built up from the asymptotic behaviour of initial coefficients together with the known singular points in the    the local density of states ( ldos ) and total density of states ( tdos ) are defined as @xmath18    numerically , we can not iterate the continued fraction for infinite number of steps , so , we must terminate this continued fraction at some stage . a good description of terminators is given by muller and viswanath @xcite . the manner in which the coefficients behave as @xmath19 reflects upon the band widths and integrable singularities on the compact spectrum    we have used terminators of type given as - @xmath20 with expansion coefficients @xmath21 where @xmath22 are the band edges . using terminators the @xmath23 and @xmath24",
    "are plotted against @xmath25 in fig.[ab ] for some cases .",
    "this section is divided in two parts : in the first we present a discussion on how the calculated values of hamiltonian parameters @xmath26 and @xmath27 obtained by the tight binding linear muffin tin orbitals method(tb - lmto / nmto ) reproduce results in case of nanotubes with defects . in the second we present a comparative discussion between the ldos for zigzag type and armchair type nanotubes with s - w defects .    in earlier works",
    "the energy was usually expressed in terms of @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the bandwidth and @xmath30 is the number of nearest neighbours of each atom .",
    "so , they chose @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "however when defects are introduced @xmath33 varies with @xmath25 and this shift of the origin to a constant value of @xmath34 is not possible any more .",
    "but the scaling of energy by the bandwidth(@xmath35 ) still remains valid .",
    "also in such cases the symmetry of the dos is lost because the odd moments of ldos are functions of @xmath23 @xcite . in our study , the hamiltonian parameters @xmath34 and @xmath27 are obtained from an initial tb - lmto followed by a massive down - folding to obtain their effective @xmath7 parts@xcite .",
    "fig.[gdos](a ) gives the dos of pristine graphene sheet with hopping parameter @xmath36 and the potential energy term @xmath31 ( not the calculated value ) .",
    "this is symmetric about the minima , i.e , @xmath37 and the maxima are at @xmath38 .",
    "this dos is similar to those calculated by other methods earlier .",
    "only difference is that we found the peaks at @xmath39 and in those papers they are at @xmath40 as , in most of the papers the values that they put are @xmath41 and @xmath32 .",
    "now , putting the calculated value of @xmath42 we find fig [ gdos](b ) .",
    "as expected , the entire graph shifts towards left by an amount @xmath43 and is symmetric about @xmath44 .    in figs.[gdos ]",
    "the ldos for pristine nanotube of ( a ) ( 6,0 ) zigzag type , ( b ) ( 3,3 ) armchair types and ( c ) ( 6,6 ) armchair types are shown .",
    "there are some geometric distinctions between the infinite flat sheet and the nanotube .",
    "both geometries have no open edges , though , in the tube , this is achieved by periodicity along one edge and shifting other edge to infinity ; while for the sheet all edges are shifted to infinity . in spite of these similarities ,",
    "the ldos are quite different as seen in fig.[gdos ] . as we compare fig.[gdos](b ) with fig.[gdos](d ) and ( e ) , we find ldos of graphene sheet has more differences with ldos of ( 3,3 ) armchair nanotube as compared to the ( 6,6 ) type .",
    "this is expected as nanotubes with higher chirality has surface with less curvature , so , has less dis - similarities with infinite sheet .",
    "we can understand this from the recursion coefficients .",
    "in pristine graphene @xmath33 are independent of @xmath25 and consequently all odd moments of green s function are zero .",
    "this leads to ldos symmetric about the origin .",
    "however to interpret fig [ gdos](d ) and ( e ) correctly , we compare fig [ ab](a ) with ( b ) and ( c ) ; and note that in the latter @xmath33 oscillates with @xmath25 while in the former it is a constant .",
    "this leads to asymmetric structures in the ldos for graphene with defects .",
    "when topological defects are introduced , the geometrical symmetry is broken , so , the diagonal term of tb - hamiltonian plays a big role in determining the exact shape of the ldos .",
    "we should like to emphasize this point , so that the general practice of shifting the origin to a @xmath31 is discouraged .",
    "ldos at the point e of zigzag type nanotube with single s - w defect ( refer to fig.[ldos](e ) closely resembles fig.[gdos](c ) with a semiconductor like feature near fermi energy ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "as we enter the defect region , this energy range of low ldos is filled up with impurity states .",
    "this is also true for nanotubes with double s - w defects ( refer to fig.[ldos](f ) . in case of armchair nanotube ldos at e",
    "is more metallic in nature ( fig.[ldos](g ) . as we get near to the defect , ldos at @xmath45 increases leading to greater metallicity .",
    "the effect of the double s - w defects ( refldos(h ) are rather similar except that the metallicity increases further . from this",
    "we can surmise that incorporation of s - w defects should increases the metallicity in graphene nanotubes .",
    "we have shown that the recursion method is ideally suited for the study of electronic structure in graphinic materials with extended defects . this method coupled with the tb - lmto /",
    "nmto provides a first principles description and our application to graphene nanotubes justifies this view .",
    "moreover , the same recursion method , suitably modified can be used to study response functions like resistivity and optical conductivity@xcite , phonons and thermal conduction@xcite and magnetism .",
    "we propose this unified technique for our future work ."
