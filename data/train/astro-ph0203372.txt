    "collimated radio - luminous outflows are by now detected from the cosmological neighborhood up to redshifts in excess of five . according to the unified scheme these jet - sources come in two classes : radio - loud quasars , where the current redshift record is @xmath6 ( @xcite ) , and radio galaxies . among the latter ones the highest known redshift is @xmath7 ( @xcite ) .",
    "infrared observations indicate that radio galaxies contain a luminous quasar hidden by a dusty torus , at least at redshift above @xmath8 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the maximum power of radio galaxies increases with redshift ( @xcite ) , the suspicion being that the most powerful active galaxies at @xmath9 develop into bcgs ( @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "this idea is supported e.g. by the fact that the co - moving space density of clusters at low redshift is comparable to that of powerful agn at @xmath10 ( @xcite ) .",
    "there is good reason to believe that the jets of higher redshift sources bore into a medium of higher density .",
    "if one just considers the cosmological expansion , the number density of the intergalactic material ( igm ) scales like @xmath11 , on large scales .",
    "this means e.g. that if the well known radio galaxy , which has a surrounding igm number density of a few times @xmath12 ( @xcite ) , was located at redshift @xmath13 , its jet had to bore into a medium with @xmath14 .",
    "however , the environments of the most powerful radio galaxies , which are believed to highlight the highest density peaks in the early universe , are not a priori expected to simply follow the hubble flow .",
    "for example , it has to be taken into account that the associated galaxies appear as bright ellipticals only at redshift @xmath15 , whereas above this redshift one finds clumpy regions , distributed over upto 100 kpc ( @xcite ) , and a considerable fraction of the gas is transformed into stars around that redshift .",
    "direct estimates from emission line observations indicate igm densities in the range of @xmath16 ( @xcite ) upto @xmath17 , if one ascribes the dominant energy source for ionization to the bow shock of the jet ( @xcite ) .",
    "if the jets themselves consist in electron proton plasma and are subrelativistic on large scales ",
    "e.g. in a kpc scale jet velocity ( @xmath18 ) of 0.4 @xmath19 is favoured ( @xcite , @xmath19 being the velocity of light )  the number density in the jet ( @xmath20 ) is given by @xmath21 here @xmath22 is the jet s mass flux rate ( in solar masses per year ) , @xmath23 is the jet radius ( about 0.6 kpc in cygnus a , @xcite ) , and @xmath24 the mass of hydrogen .",
    "adopting an igm number density of @xmath25 for high redshift radio sources gives a density contrast @xmath26 .",
    "due to the lower environment density ( @xcite ) , @xmath27 is thought to be higher in low redshift sources . because the expansion velocity of the radio structure scales proportional to @xmath28 , the average extension of radio galaxies with @xmath15 of 100 kpc versus 10 kpc at @xmath9 ( @xcite )",
    "could be nicely explained by such a cosmological igm density increase , if the average active time stays constant .",
    "another indication for high density environments at high redshift is the observed bending of the kpc scale radio jets ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this underlines the clumpy nature of the igm around high redshift radio galaxies ( hzrg ) .",
    "the optical emission of radio galaxies is often aligned with the jet axis . while below @xmath29 this emission",
    "is highly polarized , indicating mainly scattered light from a hidden agn , above @xmath30 less then 2% polarization is found and stellar absorption lines are detected ( @xcite ) .",
    "this could indicate that  at high redshift ",
    "jets induce star formation .",
    "the aligned light could also reflect the large scale matter distribution ( @xcite ) .",
    "radio galaxies are surrounded by a ly-@xmath31 halo .",
    "the size of this halo grows with redshift ( @xcite ) .",
    "whilst sources at @xmath15 have halos of @xmath32 and an extension of 10 kpc , @xmath9 sources have 100 kpc halos of @xmath33 .",
    "the width of the emission lines is typically @xmath34 km / s ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "hzrg with diameters less than 50 kpc show associated narrow absorption lines with a width of @xmath35 km / s ( @xcite ) .",
    "the absorption is often saturated with column densities of @xmath36 , and is preferentially blue - shifted by upto 250 km / s .",
    "these absorption systems were thought of to consist of @xmath37 solar system sized clouds by van ojik et al .",
    "advanced modeling with photoionization codes lead to the proposition that the absorber was a low density region , surrounding every hzrg ( @xcite ) .",
    "none of these models take into account the hydrodynamic facet of the problem .",
    "this letter is therefore dedicated to an understanding of the above mentioned features based on hydrodynamic modeling of hzrgs .",
    "one of the basic differences between jets at low and high redshift is the environmental density .",
    "we consider a  typical  jet with a density contrast of @xmath38 , a velocity of @xmath39 cm / s ( internal mach number 85 ) , a jet radius of 1 kpc , and a density of the homogeneous external medium of 1 @xmath40 .",
    "this results in a kinetic jet luminosity of @xmath41 erg / s , which is transfered by some efficiency factor to radio luminosity .",
    "the velocity of advancement of the jet s head  and the bow shock in front of it  is expected to be @xmath42 km / s .",
    "this velocity causes the external gas to get heated to a temperature of @xmath43 , according to standard hydrodynamic shock jump conditions , neglecting the internal energy of the pre - shock gas .",
    "the cooling time of this post - shock gas due to thermal bremsstrahlung with an emissivity of @xmath44 @xmath45 will be : @xmath46 which is less than the typical lifetime of a jet .",
    "therefore , cooling has a major effect on the evolution of the post - shock gas .",
    "this gas will cool down to high densities and a temperature of about @xmath3 k , where the cooling curve drops significantly ( @xcite ) .",
    "we have solved the hydrodynamic equations for the above mentioned parameters numerically with the code _ nirvana_c _",
    "( @xcite ) , upgraded due to optically thin cooling ( @xcite ) .",
    "nirvana_c is a second order accurate finite difference scheme .",
    "cooling comes into play via the equation for the internal energy density ( @xmath47 ) : @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the global cooling function .",
    "nirvana_c also solves the ionization and recombination equations , by a time implicit method , in order to allow for nonequilibrium processes . for the present simulation ,",
    "three species were used , namely ionized and neutral hydrogen , and electrons . below @xmath50 k ,",
    "an average cooling curve for solar metalicity was applied ( @xcite ) .",
    "the simulation was carried out in axisymmetry ( 2.5d ) , and the jet is resolved with 10 points . with that resolution , nirvana_c marginally resolves shocks in the jet beam and gets basic flow parameters right .",
    "turbulence on small scales as well as details of the beam , especially of the head region , are unresolved ( @xcite ) .",
    "the simulation was stopped when the thickness of the shell behind the bow shock shrinked below the resolution , which was clearly the case after a simulation time of @xmath51 yrs . the results are quite unusual compared to simulations of higher @xmath27 : most of the mass accumulates into an almost spherical shell behind the bow shock .",
    "the maximum density there is @xmath52 , and the gas has cooled to an average temperature of @xmath53 k in regions with density above @xmath54 , which still cover almost the whole shell surface .",
    "the mass accumulated in this shell is @xmath55 , 75  % of which are neutral .",
    "this gives an average neutral column for the shell of @xmath56 , which has to be compared to the amount of matter displaced by the shell : @xmath57 .",
    "it follows , that 98 % of the mass are accumulated in the thin shell .",
    "therefore 2 % of the mass or @xmath58 were entrained into the cocoon .",
    "the cocoon itself has a very peculiar structure .",
    "it is well known , that jet cocoons broaden when lowering @xmath27 ( @xcite ) .",
    "but in this simulation , the cocoon is not elongated along the jet beam , forming individual vortices . instead",
    ", all the vortices join into one big vortex with a diameter of roughly 8 kpc .",
    "the vortex shedding is sometimes violent : while , at the time shown , only a small eddy is ejected at the beam head , at other times we observed upto half the jet beam splitting and forming an eddy .",
    "the big vortex turns around at a maximum velocity of @xmath59 .",
    "the velocity of the jet head differs considerably from higher @xmath27 simulations . at early times",
    ", it is about 10 times higher than the expectation above . only after about two million years",
    ", the jet head moves , relatively constant , at maximum expected pace .    within the cocoon ,",
    "the sound speed is , on average , 20000 km / s .",
    "therefore , pressure differences within the cocoon gas are rapidly communicated , with the result that the pressure is almost constant .",
    "the simulation shows that the bow shock is , at early times , perfectly spherical .",
    "it looks more like a supernova bubble than a jet cocoon .",
    "indeed , if one compares the velocity of a spherical blast wave ( e.g. @xcite , with constant energy ejection ) : @xmath60 to the velocity of the jet head , one finds , that the jet head outruns the blast wave only at times above @xmath61 yrs , for the parameters of our simulation .",
    "this is what we observe .",
    "we rewrite the above equation for the case , when the energy injection comes from a jet : @xmath62 .",
    "the blast wave velocity depends on @xmath63 , whereas the jet head velocity depends on @xmath64 ( light jet limit ) .",
    "because of that , the spherical state of the bow shock can be observed only at the earliest times , for higher @xmath27 .",
    "because of the large neutral column , this shell is a good candidate for the absorber in hzrgs",
    ". the width of an absorption line caused by this absorber would be approximately the sound speed within it ( @xcite ) , which is in our simulation about 55 km / s , on average .",
    "this is also in remarkable agreement with observations ( @xcite ) .",
    "typically , the material that is just heated by the shell emits lyman @xmath31 at a few percent of the kinetic jet luminosity .",
    "this is less then the observed ly @xmath31 luminosity , indicating that the bow shock is not the main emitter . at late times",
    "compared to @xmath65 , it is justified to approximate the bow shock with an isothermal shock description . following steffen et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , we derive for the thickness of the spherical thin shell : @xmath66 here , @xmath67 denotes the mean molecular weight per proton mass .",
    "the sound crossing time through this shell is about @xmath68 yrs , which is much longer than the cooling time ( about @xmath3 yrs , @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , it is possible , that the shell breaks up into individual subshells ( @xcite ) .",
    "this could well correspond to the multiple associated absorption systems , often observed in hzrgs .",
    "these absorbers are preferentially blue shifted , a natural feature of our model . but almost never , a velocity above 250 km / s is observed . approximating the sideways expansion of the shell by the laws for the spherical shell also for some time after the jet head begins to shape the shell",
    ", one can calculate @xmath27 , given the bubble size ( @xmath69 kpc ) at observation time .",
    "this yields @xmath70 , which means that the full range of currently known observations can be explained if the environmental density is @xmath71 .",
    "@xmath27 in the above formula could be replaced by @xmath72 to account for a declining density distribution .",
    "the @xmath73 would be lower , in that case .",
    "it is interesting to note here , that very similar numbers have been found from quite different arguments for the environment of the radio galaxy 4c 41.17 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the bubble interior looses a considerable amount of internal energy via synchrotron radiation , which is not included in the simulation .",
    "this lowers the requirement for the external density .",
    "although the observed hydrogen mass in these systems barly exceeds @xmath5 , it is likely that they contain significantly more mass . given that hzrg host the most powerful quasars of the universe , we should expect black hole masses of the order @xmath5 . the gas mass should be more than that .",
    "if the gas mass would be of the order @xmath74 , as is suggested here , the gas to black hole mass ratio would be similar to the bulge to black hole mass ratio found at low redshift . in that case",
    ", most of the shell s mass would be  at any evolutionary state , the systems are observed at so far  in cold fragments just about to form stars .",
    "the shell is not only thermally , but also gravitationally unstable .",
    "the time , when the instability on the shell surface occurs for the first time is ( @xcite , again for constant energy injection rate and for the parameters of our model ) : @xmath75 . gravitational and thermal instability",
    "will support each other .",
    "the jeans mass in the shell is @xmath76 .",
    "hence , the shell will form stars in globular clusters of that mass .",
    "assuming an efficiency of @xmath77 , the shell would form , roughly , @xmath3 globular cluster systems .",
    "this is in remarkable agreement to what is found in nearby bcgs , like e.g. ( @xcite ) : bcgs show an excess of globular cluster systems of about @xmath78 compared to non bcg ellipticals with comparable luminosity . sometimes , two distinguished globular cluster populations are observed .",
    "harris et al .",
    "( 1998 ) consider various formation scenarios in detail and conclude that a kind of galactic wind must have driven out a large fraction of the galaxies gas , before it was able to form stars .",
    "when the shell fragments , its covering factor decreases further and the absorption vanishes .",
    "this scenario could nicely explain , why no absorbers are observed for galaxies larger than 50 kpc .",
    "afterwards the shell would become visible in the optical , due to the newly born stars , which will also increase the ionization of the remaining parts of the absorbing shell .",
    "a bubble shaped star forming region like that can be found around the radio galaxy ( @xcite ) .",
    "these associated absorption systems also seem to be observed in high redshift quasars ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "there , they have velocities of a few thousand km / s , consistent with the model , if one assumes that the line of sight in quasars is not far from the jet axis .",
    "in addition , this part of the shell could be accelerated by photoabsorption of photons from the quasar ( @xcite ) .    in the simulation",
    ", we find that @xmath79 of shocked igm are entrained into the cocoon .",
    "this number should not be taken too literally , because small scale turbulence could change that and high resolution studies are required to get this number accurate . nevertheless , it is slightly more than the typical observed lyman @xmath31 emitting gas mass .",
    "higher resolution would also be essential in order to determine the mixing properties and density of this gas .",
    "the big vortex , we observe in the cocoon is an ideal accelerator for the entrained gas . in the simulation ,",
    "the gas is swept along , and accumulates mainly on the left - hand side and along and next to the jet beam . there",
    "it is spun up to a velocity of @xmath80 km / s .",
    "we expect , that at higher resolution , small scale kelvin - helmholtz instabilities will entrain mass at the boundary of the vortex .",
    "this is also observed in other simulations ( @xcite ) .",
    "given the high velocity of this propeller , it seems quite likely that emission line gas could be accelerated to the observed velocity of @xmath81 1000 km / s .",
    "all that should be studied in more detail with simulations of higher resolution .",
