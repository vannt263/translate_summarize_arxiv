    "the rotation curves of dark - matter - dominated galaxies probe the mass profile of their galactic halos",
    ". the observed rotation curves of dwarf and low - surface - brightness ( lsb ) disk galaxies , therefore , offer a relatively direct test of theories of cosmological halo formation , free of the complicating effects of the dynamical coupling of dissipationless dark matter and dissipative baryonic matter which affect the mass profiles of baryon - dominated galaxies . recently",
    ", attention has focused on the apparent conflict between the singular halo density profiles predicted by cdm n - body simulations and the observed rotation curves , which favor a flat - density core ( cf .",
    "moore et al .",
    "this has led to intense scrutiny of both the observations and the cdm model , primarily in one of three directions : improvement in the numerical resolving power of the cdm n - body simulations to determine better the logarithmic slope of the predicted density profiles at small radii ( e.g. moore et al .",
    "1999 ) , ideas for modifying the microscopic properties of the dark matter so as to retain the more successful aspects of the cdm model while flattening the halo density profiles at small radii ( e.g. dav et al . 2000 , and references therein ) , and suggestions that the rotation curve data lack sufficient spatial resolution near the center to distinguish unambiguously between a density profile with a flat - density core and the singular profiles predicted by cdm n - body simulations ( e.g. van den bosch & swaters 2000 ) . despite these uncertainties ,",
    "a meaningful comparison between the data and predictions for the _ global _ properties of the rotation curves of dark - matter - dominated galaxies is possible which serves to test the cdm model and discriminate amongst different background cosmologies . to demonstrate this ,",
    "we show how the mass and formation epoch of a halo can be extracted from its observed rotation curve , by application of an analytical model for halo formation which reproduces the empirical description of these rotation curves extremely well .",
    "@xcite showed that the observed rotation curves of several dark - matter - dominated dwarf galaxies are consistent with a common density profile with a flat - density core , according to @xmath3 @xcite found that the rotation curves for a larger sample which included both dwarf and lsb galaxies are well fit by a similar universal halo profile given by @xmath4 with @xmath5 , which is only slightly steeper than the burkert profile in the core but shares the slope at large radii , where @xmath6 .",
    "the circular velocity profiles [ i.e. @xmath7/r)^{1/2}$ ] ] for equations ( [ rho_b ] ) and ( [ general_profile ] ) are virtually indistinguishable at all radii , even near the center , where @xmath8 , since @xmath9 or @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "this contrasts with the halo profiles found by n - body simulations of the standard cdm model .",
    "the universal fitting formula for simulated halos reported by navarro , frenk , & white ( 1997 ; nfw ) is equation  ( [ general_profile ] ) with @xmath11 , while @xcite find @xmath12 .",
    "however , the circular velocity profiles for these halos differ significantly from those implied by equations ( [ rho_b ] ) and ( [ general_profile ] ) only at very small radii where the uncertainties in the shape of the observed rotation curves currently makes discrimination difficult . in the meantime ,",
    "equation  ( [ rho_b ] ) generally fits the data better than does the nfw profile even when the latter is also an acceptable fit .",
    "the burkert profile , then , continues to serve as a useful empirical description of the universal mass profiles of dark - matter - dominated galactic halos .",
    "we show here that the truncated , nonsingular isothermal sphere model we derived elsewhere ( shapiro , iliev & raga 1998 , paper i ; iliev & shapiro 2000 , paper ii ) has a density profile for which the circular velocity profile is essentially indistinguishable from that of the burkert profile and , as such , provides a theoretical motivation for the latter .",
    "the tis model goes well beyond the prediction of density profile and rotation curve , however , to provide the size , mass , velocity dispersion and collapse epoch of the halo , as well .",
    "this makes possible the further interpretation of observations of dark - matter - dominated galaxies for comparison with the predictions of various cosmological models . at the same time , the tis model can be shown to reproduce many of the average properties of the halos found in simulations of the standard cdm model , outside of the innermost region where the tis halo has a flat - density core , unlike the cdm halos . as a result",
    ", a comparison of the analytical tis predictions with observed properties of galaxies also offers insight into the standard cdm model . finally ,",
    "if suggestions like the self - interacting dark matter proposal of @xcite are correct , that cdm might be more `` collisional '' as a way to eliminate the central cusp of standard cdm halos , then our tis solution will also apply to these models , to the extent that the halo relaxation process makes the final equilibrium approximately isothermal .    in ",
    "[ tis ] , we briefly summarize the relevant properties of the tis model and present a simple analytical formula for it with which to fit an observed rotation curve . in ",
    "[ applic_rot_curves ]",
    "we demonstrate the excellent agreement between the tis model rotation curve and that implied by equation  ( [ rho_b ] ) and show how this allows us to deduce the total mass and collapse epoch of a given halo directly from the parameters of its observed rotation curve . in ",
    "[ vm_rm_sect ] , we describe how the dependence of the average formation epoch of a halo on its mass in the cdm model results in statistical correlations amongst the parameters of the observed rotation curves . as an example , we use this approach to derive analytically the known correlation between the maximum velocity of each rotation curve and the radius at which it occurs .",
    "the tis model is a particular solution of the lane - emden equation ( suitably modified when @xmath13 ) which results from the collapse and virialization of a top - hat density perturbation ( c.f .",

    "the tis model quantitatively reproduces the average structural properties of halos found in cdm simulations to good accuracy , suggesting that it is a useful analytical approximation for halos which form from more realistic initial conditions .",
    "an exception to this agreement is the very inner profile , where the tis has a uniform - density core instead of a central cusp .",
    "our tis predictions agree to astonishingly high accuracy ( i.e. to of order 1% ) with the cluster mass - radius and radius - temperature relationships and integrated mass profiles derived from detailed cdm simulations of x - ray cluster formation by evrard , metzler , and navarro ( 1996 ) .",
    "apparently , these simulation results are not sensitive to our disagreement in the core .",
    "a direct comparison of the tis and nfw mass profiles reveals a very close agreement ( fractional deviation of less than @xmath34 ) at all radii outside of a few tis core radii ( i.e. about one king radius ) , for nfw concentration parameters @xmath35 .",

    "the result in figure  [ fit ] , with @xmath42 and @xmath43 , shows extremely good agreement , with a fractional deviation below 10% from @xmath44 to @xmath17 and below 4% over the range @xmath45 . for the tis , the maximum circular velocity and its location",
