    "many appealing properties of graphene  a monoatomic crystalline sheet of carbon  stem from its unique electronic structure.@xcite specifically , its honeycomb lattice combined with the conjugation of @xmath0-electrons over the entire sheet results in the electronic spectrum of a zero - gap semiconductor with `` ultra - relativistic '' electrons and holes.@xcite already this makes graphene enormously appealing from both basic and application standpoints .",
    "what makes graphene even more attractive is the possibility to tune these properties in a wide range by patterning , chemical functionalization , doping etc .",
    "for example , shifting the fermi level away from the charge neutrality ( dirac ) point by applying the back - gate voltage , and , therefore , changing the graphene s electrical conductivity , can become useful in graphene - based electronics.@xcite    the improved electrical conductivity of a back - gated or chemically doped graphene sample leads to qualitative changes in its optical properties .",
    "in particular , collective excitations ( plasmons ) , rather then single - particle excitations ( electron - hole pairs ) , are expected to define an electronic response of graphene to a low - frequency optical perturbation .",
    "plasmons in graphene are of great interest from the basic perspective , as collective excitations in a two - dimensional electron gas with very peculiar properties . besides , the graphene plasmonics holds promise for , e.g. , photonic and optoelectronic devices , as well as metamaterials.@xcite plasmons in graphene have been predicted and studied , theoretically@xcite but experimental studies of this phenomenon are still very sparse.@xcite    in this paper we propose an experimental technique to probe plasmons in graphene .",
    "the technique is based on the frster resonance energy transfer between a fluorescent semiconductor quantum dot ( or a dye molecule ) and a nearby graphene layer .",
    "efficient energy transfer between a dye molecule and graphene has been theoretically predicted by swathi and sebastian@xcite and later confirmed experimentally.@xcite however , swathi and sebastian described electronic excitations in graphene on the single - particle level , which is accurate only for a nearly undoped ( charge - neutral ) graphene . in this paper ,",
    "electronic excitations are treated more accurately by adopting the random - phase approximation , which allows for recovering the collective electronic behavior .",
    "we demonstrate that electronic excitations in graphene , both single - particle and collective , can be sensitively probed by studying the fluorescence quenching of the quantum dot due to the energy transfer to graphene .",
    "specifically , we show how the plasmon dispersion can be extracted from experiment .    the expected advantage of the proposed technique over the typically used electron energy loss spectroscopy ( eels)@xcite is its intrinsic locality , i.e.",
    ", plasmons are proposed to be probed _ locally _ by a semiconductor quantum dot ( typically a few nanometers in diameter ) .",
    "in contrast , eels averages the plasmonic response over a certain portion of a graphene sample , thus , adding the inhomogeneous broadening due to , e.g. , charge puddles,@xcite to experimental observables .",

    "frster resonance energy transfer ( fret ) refers to the transfer of electronic excitation energy between chromophores@xcite mediated by the nonradiative coulomb coupling.@xcite this process consists of deexcitation of an initially ( optically ) excited donor chromophore and the simultaneous excitation of an acceptor chromophore .",
    "an example of such a process is the energy transfer between a semiconductor quantum dot ( qd ) and a non - fluorescent organic molecule as an acceptor chromophore.@xcite as the energy transfer to the non - fluorescent `` dark '' molecule ( i.e. , quencher ) competes with the intrinsic fluorescence of the `` bright '' qd , the fret rate can be assessed through the effective decrease ( quenching ) of the qd fluorescence quantum yield , and/or through the shorter apparent fluorescence lifetime , measured by time - resolved fluorescence spectroscopy . specifically , the apparent fluorescence lifetime is given by @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the lifetime of the isolated qd and @xmath3 is the fret ( quenching ) rate .",
    "accordingly , the decreased fluorescence quantum yield in the presence of fret is given by @xmath4 .",
    "therefore , @xmath3 can be extracted provided @xmath5 and @xmath2 are known from experiment .",
    "the efficiency of fret is strongly affected by parameters of the acceptor s excitation spectrum .",
    "a trivial example is a vanishing fret rate in a system where an acceptor chromophore does not have excitations resonant to the lowest excited state of a donor chromophore .",
    "this allows one to use fret as a spectroscopic tool to probe an electronic structure of a system of interest .",
    "an advantage of this method is the near - field regime of the donor - acceptor interaction , which allows for probing excitations forbidden in the far - field ( optical ) regime due to , e.g. , the large wavelength mismatch between optical photons and material electronic excitations .",

    "our numerical tests show that the exponential decay of qe is typically already established at @xmath23 comparable with the plasmon wavelength @xmath145 . on the other hand ,",
    "estimations by various authors suggest that the plasmon propagation length could be as high as 10 - 100 @xmath145.@xcite therefore , we expect qe to decay exponentially at @xmath146 , thus allowing for extraction of plasmon dispersion . the onset of deviations from this exponential decay at larger qd - graphene distances , @xmath147 , naturally provides a good estimate for the plasmon propagation length .",
    "based on the detailed analysis of fluorescence quenching efficiency in the qd - graphene complex , we have proposed a method of probing and studying electronic excitations in graphene . the method has been demonstrated to be sufficiently sensitive to allow the extraction of the dispersion relation of plasmon in graphene .",
    "we hope that this study will stimulate experimental efforts in this direction , especially because the proposed method is based on the qd - graphene complex which can be of interest not only as a means to probe electronic excitations in graphene , but also on its own merit as a key component of hybrid nanostructures with promising properties .",
    "for example , the ability to excite plasmon locally in graphene using a semiconductor quantum dot can become of great use in graphene plasmonics .",
    "another recently proposed use of qd - graphene complexes is in photovoltaics.@xcite    the rpa - based description of electronic excitations in graphene , adopted in this paper , does not include such many - body effects as exchange and correlation , impurity and defect scattering , or electron - phonon coupling",
    ". these effects can affect the plasmonic response of graphene in two ways .",
    "first , there can be deviations of the actual plasmon dispersion relation from the one shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : p_im](b ) .",
    "second , additional channels of plasmon damping can appear , as discussed in the previous section .",
    "the proposed experimental technique is capable of assessing both the dispersion relation and the damping and , thus , is expected to stimulate the development of beyond - rpa theoretical methods by providing a necessary experimental validation .",
