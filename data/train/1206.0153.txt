    "a put option on a stock can be interpreted as a contract between a holder and a writer which allows the former to claim from the latter at an exercise time @xmath0 the amount @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a fixed amount called the option s strike , @xmath3 is the stock price at time @xmath0 and @xmath4 . in the american options case",
    "its holder has the right to choose any exercise time before the contract matures while in the game options case the contract writer also has the right to terminate it at any time before its maturity but then he is required to pay a cancellation fee in addition to the payoff above .",
    "the fair price of american options and of game options is defined as the minimal amount the writer needs to construct a self - financing portfolio which covers his obligation to pay according to the option s contract .",
    "it is well known that in the american options case the fair price can be obtained as a value of an appropriate optimal stopping problem while for game options we have to deal with an optimal stopping ( dynkin ) game ( see @xcite ) . in general , both for american options and , even more so , for game options with finite maturity explicit formulas for their price are not available and approximation methods come into the picture while estimates of their errors become important .",
    "one of most easily implemented methods is the binomial approximation of stock prices modelled by the geometric brownian motion and  @xcite provided corresponding error estimates for american put options . in the present paper",
    "we extend this approach in order to provide error estimates of binomial approximations for game put options .",
    "we observe that for perpetual game options some explicit formulas can be obtained ( see @xcite ) but the finite maturity case studied here seems to be more realistic .",
    "approximating the brownian motion by appropriately normalized sums of bernoulli random variables the paper @xcite provided ( error ) estimates const@xmath5 and const@xmath6 for the difference between the price of an american put option and the price of its corresponding @xmath7th binomial model approximation .",
    "using again the binomial approximation of the brownian motion as above we construct in this paper two approximating procedures such that the difference between the price of a game put option and its @xmath7th approximation in the first procedure is between const@xmath5 and const@xmath8 and in the second procedure is between const@xmath8 and const@xmath6 .",
    "the error estimates here are somewhat worse than in the case of american put options which is due to the lack of a smooth fit on the boundary of the writer s stopping region which causes substantial difficulties in the study of regularity of payoff functions .",
    "we observe that specific properties of game put options had to be used in order to obtain error estimates with the above precision .",
    "for instance , when payoffs are path dependent ( and not only dependent on the present value of the stock ) @xcite provides error estimates of similar binomial approximations only of order @xmath9 .",
    "since price functions of game options can be represented as solutions of doubly reflected backward stochastic differential equations the results of @xcite are also related to game options approximations .",
    "nevertheless , approximations in @xcite are not by binomial models , where computations can be done by means of the effective dynamical programming algorithm ( see @xcite ) , but by time discretizations , and so relevant probability space and @xmath10-algebras remain infinite which prevents effective computations . furthermore , error estimates in @xcite applied to our situation are of order @xmath11 , i.e. they are worse than for binomial approximations which we construct here for the specific case of game put options .",
    "our exposition proceeds as follows . in section [ sec2 ]",
    "we provide basic results concerning game put option price functions , introduce our approximation processes and formulate our main result theorem [ main_theorem ] . in section [ sec3 ]",
    "we show that the price function can be represented as a solution of a variational inequality problem closely related to the stefan problem ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "we then use this representation to study regularity properties of the price function near the free boundary of the option s holder exercise region . in section [ sec4 ]",
    "we study the price function near the boundary of the exercise region of the writer .",
    "we use the information about this region from  @xcite in order to represent the price function as an explicit solution of the heat equation .",
    "this representation enables us to understand better the behavior of the price function near the boundary .",
    "we estimate also the rate of decay of the price function when the initial stock price tends to infinity .",
    "section [ sec5 ] is devoted to the proof of theorem [ main_theorem ]",
    ". finally , in section [ sec6 ] we exhibit some computations of the price functions and of the free boundaries .",
    "the black  scholes ( bs ) model of a financial market consists of two assets among which one is nonrisky and the other one is risky . a nonrisky asset is called a bond and its price @xmath12 at time @xmath0 is given by the formula @xmath13 where @xmath14 is interpreted as the interest rate .",
    "a risky asset is called a stock and its price at time @xmath0 is determined by a geometric brownian motion @xmath15 where @xmath16 is called volatility and @xmath17 is a standard brownian motion defined on a complete probability space @xmath18 . if @xmath19 we write also @xmath20 for @xmath3 .",
    "the fair price of an american put option at time @xmath0 with a strike ( price ) @xmath2 and a maturity ( horizon ) time @xmath21 can now be written as a function @xmath22 of time and the current stock price having the form ( see , for instance , @xcite ) , @xmath23 where @xmath24 denotes the set of all stopping times of the brownian filtration with values in the interval @xmath25 $ ] and @xmath26 is the expectation with respect to the measure @xmath27 .",

    "it is convenient to view @xmath48 as defined on the sequence space @xmath49 by the formula @xmath50 if @xmath51 .",
    "then @xmath52 will be defined on the probability space @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the product measure and @xmath55 is generated by cylinder sets .",
    "now set @xmath56 which is the price of the american put option with a maturity @xmath32 and a strike @xmath2 provided the initial stock price is @xmath2 .",
    "it is easy to see that if the penalty @xmath57 then it does not make sense for the writer to cancel the corresponding game put option ( see lemma 3.1 in @xcite ) , and so in this case the prices of american and game options are the same , i.e. @xmath58 . since approximations of american options were studied in @xcite we assume in this paper that @xmath59 . observe that @xmath60 is continuous in @xmath0 and it is strictly decreasing to 0 as @xmath0 increases to @xmath32 , and so for each @xmath61 $ ] there exists a unique @xmath62 such that @xmath63 .",

    "but from the computational point of view we can obtain @xmath96 only approximately using , for instance , the algorithm from @xcite .",

    "the general strategy of the proof resembles that of @xcite but the study of the price function of game put options is more complicated than in the american options case , in particular , because of appearance of two exercise boundaries ( holder s and writer s ) having different properties .",
