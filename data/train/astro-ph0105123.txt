    "angular momentum is clearly one of the key physical ingredients in the process of galaxy formation .",
    "the total angular momentum , and its distribution , must have a crucial role in determining the galaxy history and final type .",
    "it has therefore been a subject for classical investigations , pioneered by hoyle ( 1949 ) , and then analysed qualitatively by peebles ( 1969 ) .",
    "this led to the ` standard ' theory for the origin of angular momentum in the framework of hierarchical cosmological structure formation , the tidal - torque theory ( ttt ) due to doroshkevich ( 1970 ) and white ( 1984 ) .",
    "special interest in the subject has been revived recently because of a  spin crisis \" , arising from cosmological simulations of galaxy formation which use hydrodynamical gravitational codes to follow the gas dynamics inside dark - matter haloes , and semi - analytical recipes for star formation and feedback .",
    "these simulations seem to yield luminous galaxies that are significantly smaller , and of much less angular momentum than observed disc galaxies ( navarro , frenk & white 1995 ; navarro & steinmetz 1997 , 2000 ) . the discovery of massive black holes in galactic centers ( kormendy & richstone 1995 ; magorrian 1998 ; gebhardt 2000a , b ) provides another motivation for understanding the detailed distribution of angular momentum within galaxies .",
    "a general need for a detailed recipe for the build - up of angular momentum in galaxies comes from the developing semi - analytic models , which have been proven very useful in the study of galaxy formation ( e.g. white & frenk 1991 ; kauffmann , white & guiderdoni 1993 ; cole et al . 1994 ; somerville & primack 1999 ) .",
    "another current motivation comes from weak lensing studies .",
    "our ability to reconstruct maps of the cosmic mass distribution from weak gravitational lensing measurements ( bacon , refregier & ellis 2000 ; kaiser , wilson & luppino 2000 ; van waerbeke 2000 , 2001 ; wittman 2000 ) is hampered by the unknown intrinsic distribution and alignment of galaxy shapes .",
    "as a first guess , one crudely assumes that the shapes and orientations of background galaxies are uncorrelated in space , and that the detected correlations of galaxy ellipticities are solely due to the lensing by the foreground mass distribution .",
    "however , a series of observations ( brown 2000 ; pen , lee & seljak 2000 ) and numerical simulations ( croft & metzler 2000 ; heavens , refregier & heymans 2000 ; dekel 2000 ) evidenced that both the intrinsic galaxy shapes and their spins are spatially correlated .",
    "theoretical models for the alignment of disc galaxies orientations tend to assume that they are induced by spin correlations ( catelan , kamionkowski & blandford 2001 ; crittenden 2001 ) .",
    "these issues add a timely aspect to the motivation for revisiting the classical problem of angular momentum , in an attempt to sharpen our understanding of its various components .",
    "this includes the first step of angular - momentum acquisition by dark haloes , which might be particularly assumed to be fairly well understood .",
    "the basic idea of ttt is that most of the angular momentum is being gained gradually by proto - haloes in the linear regime of density fluctuations growth , due to tidal torques from neighboring fluctuations , and that this process continues until the proto - halo reaches its maximum extent .",
    "the further assumption is that only little angular momentum is being exchanged between haloes later on in the non - linear regime , after the proto - haloes have decoupled from the expanding background and collapsed to virialized systems .",
    "it is commonly assumed that the baryonic material , which in general follows the dark - matter distribution inside each proto - halo , gains a similar specific angular momentum and carries it along when it contracts to form a luminous galaxy at the halo centre .",
    "this should allow us to predict galactic spins using the approximate but powerful analytic tools of quasi - linear theory of gravitational instability .    in a series of papers",
    ", we evaluate the performance of the ttt approximation , and trace the roles of its various ingredients , using a cosmological @xmath0-body simulation with thousands of well - resolved haloes .",
    "as we do so , we find to our surprise that some of the basic ingredients of ttt , which are commonly assumed to be of ` text - book ' status , involve certain unjustified assumptions and confused understandings , which may lead to poor approximations .",
    "these papers represent attempts to clarify some of these controversial issues .",
    "we address the ttt at different levels . in this paper ( paper i )",
    ", we evaluate how well does the approximation predict the final angular momentum of a halo , given full knowledge of the corresponding initial proto - halo and the cosmological realization . in paper ii ( porciani , dekel & hoffman 2001 ) , we attempt a deeper level of understanding of the origin of halo angular momentum , by investigating the relation between the different components of ttt .",
    "this study connects to the fundamental open question of how to identify a proto - halo in a given realization of initial conditions . in paper iii ( porciani & dekel in preparation ) , we revise the standard scaling relation of ttt , based on the fact that the shear tensor is only weakly correlated with the density contrast of the proto - halo ( the density and shear being the trace and traceless parts of the same , deformation tensor ) .",
    "this scaling relation is used to predict the typical angular - momentum profile of haloes ( dekel 2001 ; bullock 2001b ) , and to provide a simple way to incorporate angular momentum in semi - analytic models of galaxy formation ( maller , dekel & somerville 2002 ) .    given the initial conditions of a proto - halo and its environment , ttt predicts the final halo angular momentum based on four specific assumptions as follows : ( a ) the flow is laminar , with a one - to - one correspondence of eulerian and lagrangian positions , or the velocity field is properly smoothed such that laminarity prevails in practice .",
    "( b ) the velocities obey the zeldovich approximation .",
    "( c ) the potential at every point within the proto - halo can be approximated by its taylor expansion to second order ( with respect to spatial separation ) about the centre of mass .",
    "( d ) there is little contribution to the halo angular momentum from non - linear effects . in the current paper",
    ", we set to evaluate the global success of ttt in this task , and try to address the validity of each of the above assumptions .",
    "the role of non - linear effects , in particular , turns out to be the key issue .",
    "this will be an attempt to follow and improve on earlier work by white ( 1984 ) , hoffman ( 1986 , 1988 ) , barnes & efstathiou ( 1987 ) , catelan & theuns ( 1996 ) , lee & pen ( 2000 ) and sugerman , summers & kamionkowski ( 2000 ) .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows : in we summarize the basics of linear tidal - torque theory . in",
    "we describe the simulation and the halo finder . in",
    "we describe the implementation of ttt to proto - haloes . in we",
    "evaluate the success of ttt in predicting the amplitudes of halo spins . in",
    "we assess the success of ttt in predicting the directions of halo spins . in",
    "we address the spatial coherence of spin directions , which is directly relevant to intrinsic alignments in the context of gravitational lensing . in",
    "we discuss our results and conclude .",
    "we start by summarizing the basics of linear tidal - torque theory .",
    "the framework is the standard friedmann - robertson - walker cosmological model in the matter - dominated post - recombination era , in which the matter is assumed to be a collision - less fluid and the dynamics is driven by gravity only . in the linear regime ,",
    "the developing proto - haloes are assumed to be small perturbations about the mean universal density .",
    "the peculiar velocity field , due to the growing mode of gravitational instability , describes a potential flow with no curl , assuming that any primordial source of vorticity ( , due to some primordial turbulence , see jones 1976 ) has decayed away due to the expansion of the universe .",
    "given a proto - halo , a patch of matter occupying an eulerian volume @xmath6 that is destined to end up in a virialized halo , the goal is to compute the halo angular momentum about the centre of mass , to the lowest non - vanishing order in perturbation theory .",
    "the angular momentum at time @xmath7 is defined by @xmath8 \\times \\left [ \\bfv ( t)-\\bfv_{\\rm cm}(t ) \\right ] d^3r \\ , , \\label{eq : lprop}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the position and peculiar velocity vectors , and the centre - of - mass quantities , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , are defined as usual .",
    "the term proportional to @xmath12 does not contribute to @xmath13 , and it will not be considered any further .",
    "re - write in comoving units , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the universal expansion factor , and replace @xmath17 with the density contrast @xmath18 with respect to the average density @xmath19 , to obtain @xmath20 \\left [ \\bfx ( t)-\\bfx_{\\rm cm}(t ) \\right ] \\times \\dot{\\bfx } \\ , d^3x \\ , .",

    "is given by its initial , lagrangian position @xmath22 plus a displacement : @xmath23 .",
    "when fluctuations are small , or when the flow is properly smoothed , the mapping @xmath24 is reversible and the flow is _",
    "laminar_. then the jacobian determinant @xmath25 does not vanish , and the continuity equation implies @xmath26=j^{-1}(\\bfq , t)$ ] . substituting in we",

    "barred quantities are averages over @xmath22 in @xmath28 .",
    "note that is exact in the absence of orbit crossing .",
    "the displacement @xmath29 is now spelled out using the _",
    "zeldovich _ approximation ( zeldovich 1970 ) , which is linear in lagrangian terms and mildly non - linear in eulerian space .",
    "it assumes that the proportionality between the velocity potential and the gravitational potential @xmath30 , which holds in the linear regime for the growing mode of density fluctuations @xmath31 , can be extended into the mildly non - linear regime .",
    "this implies that the spatial and temporal dependences of @xmath29 can be decoupled , @xmath32 where @xmath33 ( with @xmath34 newton s gravitational constant ) .",
    "it also implies that the peculiar velocity and acceleration fields are parallel .",
    "substituting into one obtains @xmath35 we see that the explicit growth rate is @xmath36 . for an einstein - de sitter universe",
    "this is @xmath37 .",
    "holds to an excellent accuracy , and it deviates only slightly for open cosmologies . ]    next , assume that the potential is smoothly varying within the volume @xmath28 , such that it can be approximated by its _ second order _",
    "taylor expansion about the centre of mass @xmath38 , @xmath39 where @xmath40 .",
    "( where @xmath41 is in comoving units ) . ]",
    "substituting in one obtains the basic ttt expression for the @xmath42th cartesian component : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the fully antisymmetric rank - three tensor , and the two key quantities are the _ deformation _ tensor at @xmath45 , @xmath46 and the _ inertia _ tensor of @xmath28 , @xmath47 note that only the traceless parts of the two tensors matter for the cross product in .",
    "these are the velocity _ shear _ or _ tidal _ tensor , @xmath48 , and the traceless quadrupolar inertia tensor , @xmath49 .",
    "thus , to the first non - vanishing order in perturbation theory , angular momentum is transferred to the developing proto - halo by the gravitational coupling of the quadrupole moment of its mass distribution with the tidal field exerted by neighboring density fluctuations .",
    "the torque depends on the proto - halo shape , the external tidal field , and the _ misalignment _ between the two . in particular , @xmath13 vanishes",
    "if @xmath28 is a sphere or is bounded by an equipotential surface of @xmath50 .",
    "there is no justification for truncating the expansion of the potential after second - order , .",
    "more generally , the expansion includes further terms , @xmath51\\ , , \\nonumber \\label{eq : lzel3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath52 here , multipole moments of a given order of the proto - halo mass distribution are coupled with spatial derivatives of the same order of the potential .",
    "this is a consequence of the @xmath53 scaling of gravitational interactions , and indeed , the total torque for a localized charge in an external electrostatic field admits a similar expansion ( , jackson 1975 , exercise 4.5 ) .",
    "note that dipole interactions [ , terms proportional to @xmath54 with @xmath55 the mass dipole moment and @xmath56 the gravitational acceleration ] do not contribute to the torque because the spin is considered in the centre - of - mass frame , where the mass dipole vanishes . on the other hand ,",
    "dipole interactions are expected to play an important role in the evolution of orbital angular momentum .",
    "after the dark - matter haloes have detached from the expanding background and collapsed into condensed systems , the tidal torquing continues , but at a highly reduced rate .",
    "peebles ( 1969 ) estimated the typical torque exerted on a quadrupolar mass distribution by a population of point - like galaxies , showing that the transfer of angular momentum becomes less and less efficient with time .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that haloes become small when they collapse , as well as the fact that they tend to move away from each other due to the hubble expansion .",
    "the @xmath0-body simulation analysed here was performed as part of the gif project ( , kauffmann 1999 ) using the parallel , adaptive particle - particle / particle - mesh ( ap@xmath57 m ) code developed by the virgo consortium ( pearce 1995 ; pearce & couchman 1997 ) . as an example",
    ", we use a simulation of the @xmath58cdm scenario , in which the cosmology is flat , einstein - de sitter with density parameter @xmath59 , and hubble constant @xmath60 with @xmath61 .",
    "the power spectrum of initial density fluctuations is cdm with shape parameter @xmath62 .",
    "the amplitude of the power spectrum is set such that the rms overdensity in top - hat spheres of radius @xmath63 , as extrapolated using linear theory to the present epoch , is @xmath64 .",
    "neutrinos produces an additional background of relativistic @xmath65 and @xmath66 neutrinos , thus delaying the onset of matter domination and lowering the effective value of @xmath28 ( bond & efstathiou 1991 ; efstathiou , bond & white 1992 ; white , gelmini & silk 1995 ) . here",
    "it simply serves us as a scenario which obeys many of the observational constraints from large - scale structure , including the normalizations set by cluster abundance and by cobe s measurements of large - angle anisotropies in the cmb , independently of its physical origin . ]",
    "the simulation was performed in a periodic cubic box of side @xmath67 , with the mass represented by @xmath68 particles of @xmath69 each .",
    "long - range gravitational forces were computed on a @xmath70 mesh , while short - range interactions were calculated as in efstathiou & eastwood ( 1981 ) . at late times ( @xmath71 ) , the corresponding gravitational potential asymptotically matches a plummer law with softening @xmath72 both at large and small scales .",
    "the simulation started at a redshift @xmath73 and ended at the present time , @xmath74 .",
    "the initial conditions were generated by displacing particles according to the zeldovich approximation from an initial stable ` glass ' state ( e.g. white 1996 ) .",
    "more details are given in jenkins ( 1998 ) .",
    "we identify virialized dark - matter haloes at @xmath74 as follows .",
    "first , we select an initial set of groups of particles using a friends - of - friends method ( , davis 1985 ) with a linking length @xmath75 in units of the average inter - particle distance .",
    "this algorithm identifies regions bounded by a surface of approximately constant density contrast , @xmath76 ( e.g. cole & lacey 1996 ) . assuming that the density profiles of these groups approximate singular isothermal spheres",
    ", the selection criterion can be expressed in terms of the average density contrast in the halo , @xmath77 .",
    "thus , @xmath75 corresponds to haloes with a mean density contrast @xmath78 , in general agreement with the predictions of the spherical collapse model for perturbations whose outer shells have collapsed recently .",
    "we then remove unbound particles from each halo by the following iterative procedure . at each step , we compute the energies of all particles in the current centre - of - mass frame , and remove the most unbound particle .",
    "we then re - compute the energies of all the particles and so on .",
    "the iteration stops when no unbound particles are found .",
    "note that a particle that has been removed is allowed to re - enter the halo if it becomes bound at a later step due to changes in the position and velocity of the centre of mass .",
    "clumps which end up containing between 100 and 200 particles loose , on average , @xmath79 per cent of their mass as unbound particles .",
    "in a few cases , typical of small haloes , the friends - of - friends algorithm identifies ` fake ' haloes which are not bound gravitationally .",
    "for example , seven friends - of - friends haloes ( out of @xmath80 ) composed by more than 100 particles end up containing only 10 bound particles or less after the un - binding procedure .",
    "more massive haloes are , naturally , less affected by unbound interlopers because their potential wells are typically deeper . for instance , the mean fraction of unbound mass removed from clumps which end up containing between 200 and 1000 ( 1000 - 3000 ) particles is @xmath81 per cent ( @xmath82 per cent ) . in the following we consider only haloes which contain more than 100 particles after the un - binding procedure is applied .",
    "our conclusions regarding ttt turn out to be insensitive to the removal of unbound particles , and to increasing the minimum - mass threshold . in order to try to restrict ourselves to galactic haloes",
    ", we also exclude all the @xmath83 haloes which consist of more than 3000 particles ",
    "these tend to have more substructure and are likely to correspond to groups or clusters of galaxies .",
    "the robustness of our conclusions regarding ttt with respect to the halo - finding algorithm ( , friends - of - friends versus fitting a spherical or ellipsoidal density profile , bullock 2001a ) is investigated in another paper in preparation .",
    "note that all the haloes in our current sample are not subclumps of larger host haloes , for which linear theory is not expected to be valid .",
    "this excludes about @xmath84 per cent of the haloes that are more massive than @xmath85 ( sigad 2001 ) .",
    "the proto - halo regions @xmath28 in lagrangian space are defined straightforwardly by tracing all the halo particles into their lagrangian positions .",
    "generally , most of the proto - halo mass is contained in a simply connected lagrangian region , but in some cases the proto - halo may be divided into several compact regions which are connected by thin filaments . nearly 10 per cent of the proto - haloes",
    "are characterized by extended filaments departing from a compact core .",
    "we stress that the proto - haloes at earlier times are defined solely based on their identification as virialized haloes at @xmath74 , without worrying about the details of the merger history , and without applying any other criteria at the initial conditions .",
    "some of the results reported below are specific to this choice of considering all today s halo particles at all times rather than , e.g. , investigating the history of the halo major progenitor ( vivitska et al .",
    "2001 ; wechsler et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .    for each proto - halo , we compute the lagrangian inertia tensor by direct summation over its @xmath0 particles of mass @xmath86 each : @xmath87 with @xmath88 the position of the @xmath89-th particle with respect to the halo centre of mass .",
    "we use three alternative methods to measure the shear tensor at the proto - halo centre of mass in the initial conditions of the @xmath0-body simulation .",
    "_ method 1 , top - hat smoothing : _ we smooth the gravitational potential used to generate the initial zeldovich displacements , and then differentiate it two times with respect to the spatial coordinates to obtain the deformation tensor",
    ". smoothing is done using a top - hat window function , while derivatives are computed on a grid . the top - hat smoothing radius in comoving units , @xmath90 , is taken to be defined by @xmath91 , with @xmath92 the virial halo mass .",
    "this is the only practical method for application in analytic and semi - analytic modelling of galaxy formation .",
    "we refer to is as the _ standard _ method of ttt .",
    "_ method 2 , fit total : _ the smoothing applied in method 1 is associated with a loss of information .",
    "first , the coarse - graining procedure averages over small - scale structure .",
    "second , the spherical smoothing kernel does not maintain the details of the proto - halo shape , since , as we find in paper ii , most proto - haloes are far from being spherically symmetric .",
    "we minimize smoothing in the computation of the tidal tensor in the following way . the comoving linear velocity field , in the proto - halo centre - of - mass frame ,",
    "is expanded in terms of the corresponding eulerian comoving separation , @xmath93 , as @xmath94 the components of the deformation tensor @xmath95 are computed by least - squares fitting to the simulation data ( cf .",
    "kaiser 1991 ) .",
    "this is realized by solving the system of equations @xmath96 & = & \\\\ \\sum_{n=1}^{n } [ v_i^{(n ) } x_j^{(n)}&+ & v_j^{(n ) } x_i^{(n)}]\\;. \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since the linear growing mode of the gravitational velocity field is curl - free , has been derived after imposing the condition @xmath97 .",
    "we then compute the symmetric , traceless shear tensor @xmath98 . the shear field computed",
    "this way corresponds to minimal smoothing , at the level of the individual particles in the @xmath0-body simulation .",
    "however , even though no velocity averaging is performed , method 2 is , in some sense , similar to using a smoothing kernel which adapts itself to the proto - halo shape .",
    "the resulting @xmath99 describes the quadrupolar structure of the velocity field in the proto - halo at the particle level .",
    "method 2 is therefore expected to provide better predictions for @xmath13 than method 1 whenever the top - hat smoothing is associated with a severe loss of information .",
    "= 8 cm    _ method 3 , fit external : _ the interactions between particles that belong to the same proto - halo can not create any net angular momentum .",
    "this motivates us to consider the shear tensor generated solely by the density perturbations lying outside the proto - halo volume , @xmath28 .",
    "this is realized by decomposing the linear velocity field into two parts , @xmath100 , accounting for the gravitational pull of the mass lying in and outside the proto - halo , respectively . in practice , for each particle in @xmath28 , we first compute the linear gravitational acceleration generated at @xmath73 by all the other point masses forming the proto - halo .",
    "> from this quantity , we then subtract the acceleration caused by the same particles as if they were part of a uniform background .",
    "this is computed using the unperturbed particle positions of the glass state which , formally , correspond to @xmath101 . rescaling the result we obtain @xmath102 .",
    "the difference between the actual velocity of the particles in the simulation at @xmath73 and this  self \" gravitationally induced term is taken to represent @xmath103 .",
    "indeed , our estimate for @xmath103 generates , in practice , the same spin as the total velocity field .",
    "eventually , the external tidal field is computed by least - squares fitting .",
    "note that , since @xmath104 , the self field does not contribute to the angular momentum also at a linear level ",
    "i.e. there is no self - torquing .",
    "the results obtained by method 2 and method 3 contain spurious contributions due to errors in the determination of the deformation tensor by the fit of a linear model to a discrete set of points .",
    "however , since the external shear is expected to vary more smoothly than the self gravity on a proto - halo scale , @xmath105 should be described more accurately by the linear expansion of the velocity field . for this reason ,",
    "method 3 should provide a better estimate of the angular momentum .",
    "note , however , that additional noise is introduced in method 3 by replacing the uniform background density distribution with the glass state .",
    "given a proto - halo at the initial conditions , we first investigate the performance of ttt , , in terms of predicting the amplitude of the halo angular momentum .",
    "any systematic deviation of the mean predicted amplitude from that obtained in the simulations can be eliminated by adjusting the effective time near turn - around at which the linear ttt growth is assumed to stop .",
    "random deviations , both due to the approximations made already at the initial conditions as well as non - linear effects at late epochs , can not be avoided and should be estimated .",
    "we start by testing the accuracy of ttt in the linear regime , at the _ initial _ time , @xmath73 . for each halo , we compute the inertia tensor @xmath106 and the shear tensor @xmath99 using the three different methods described in .",
    "we then compute the amplitude @xmath107 as predicted by , and compare it with the actual angular momentum of the proto - halo particles , @xmath108 .",
    "the distribution of the ratio of the two over the protohaloes is shown in , and characterized in table  [ apct ] .",
    "the mean ( median ) values for methods 1 , 2 , 3 are 0.95 ( 0.83 ) , 1.05 ( 0.99 ) , 1.01 ( 0.95 ) respectively . in all cases the probability distribution",
    "is positively skewed , and is leptokurtic ( with a sharp peak and long tails ) with respect to a gaussian distribution in log - space . it is therefore not very useful to quantify the dispersion about the mean by a single standard deviation , so we quote instead the 68.3 per cent confidence interval , obtained by locating the values corresponding to the 15.9 and 84.2 percentiles in the cumulative distribution . for methods 1 , 2 , 3",
    "we find @xmath109 , @xmath110 , @xmath111 respectively . as a single measure of scatter",
    "we use half the 68.3 per cent range , which is @xmath112 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 respectively .",
    "all three methods involve the second - order truncation of the expansion of the potential and some smoothing .",
    "these are the only sources of error , since the zeldovich approximation is exact at the initial conditions of the simulation by construction .",
    "even though the cases with minimum smoothing ( methods 2 and 3 ) involve noisy fits of the small - scale structure , they give somewhat more accurate predictions .",
    "the external fit does just a little better than the total fit , both in terms of systematic error and scatter .",
    "however , the smoothed tidal field ( method 1 ) , which is the only practical method for semi - analytic modelling of galaxy formation , also leads to a small systematic deviation of the mean , of only @xmath115 per cent .",
    "the scatter , though , is of the order of the signal for all three methods already at the initial conditions .",
    "these numbers change only slightly when restricting the analysis to the very well - resolved haloes containing 1000 particles or more . in this case , the mean ( median ) of the distribution of the amplitude ratio is @xmath116 ( 0.79 ) , @xmath117 ( 1.02 ) , @xmath118 ( 0.98 ) for methods 1 , 2 , 3 respectively .",
    "the corresponding scatter is @xmath119 , @xmath120 , @xmath121 .",
    "when we add the _ third - order term _ in the taylor expansion of the gravitational potential , i.e. , the second term in the right - hand side of , we find no significant improvement in the systematic error and in the scatter . in this case",
    "the mean ( median ) and scatter of @xmath122 are 0.95 ( 0.83 ) @xmath123 , almost identical to the second - order results ( top - hat smoothing is adopted in both cases ) .",
    "a more detailed inspection reveals the following .",
    "when considering only those haloes for which standard second - order ttt over - predicts or under - predicts the spin amplitude by more than a factor of 3 , we find that by adding the third - order term one improves the prediction in about 75 per cent of the cases , though the overall scatter increases . in the case of severe over - prediction ,",
    "the mean ( median ) and scatter are 4.54 ( 3.41 ) @xmath124 for second - order ttt and 3.81 ( 2.63 ) @xmath125 for third - order ttt . in the case of severe under - prediction , the numbers are 0.25 ( 0.26 ) @xmath126 for second - order ttt and 0.40 ( 0.33 ) @xmath127 for third - order ttt . on the other hand ,",
    "when the second - order ttt predictions are reasonably good , the addition of the third - order term makes no general improvement . for the haloes",
    "were the prediction is within 30 per cent of the true value , the mean ( median ) and scatter are 0.94 ( 0.92 ) @xmath128 for second - order ttt and 0.94 ( 0.91 ) @xmath129 for third - order ttt .",

    "a shear signal , interpreted as a result of gravitational lensing due to the large - scale distribution of matter , has been detected by several groups ( bacon 2000 ; kaiser 2000 ; van waerbeke 2000 , 2001 ; wittman 2000 ) .",
    "lensing shear maps can be used to directly reconstruct the mass distribution , free of galaxy biasing . however",
    ", a significant uncertainty arises due to possible intrinsic coherent alignment of galaxy shapes . indeed , brown ( 2000 ) ( see also pen 2000 ) claim to have detected a non - vanishing correlation between galaxy ellipticities in the local universe , over a range of angular separations between 1 and 100 arc - minutes .",
    "since the galaxy samples used for these studies are relatively nearby , a lensing interpretation is highly improbable , so this signal is likely to reflect intrinsic galaxy alignments .",
    "the simplest theoretical approach is to link galaxy shapes to halo spins by assuming that galaxy discs are perpendicular to the spin vector of their host haloes .",
    "the spins are expected to be correlated because the tidal field , that plays a key role in generating the angular momentum , is expected to have a non - negligible coherency over large scales ( catelan & porciani 2001 ) .",
    "alternative models assume that the light profile of elliptical galaxies approximate the shape of their hosting haloes ( croft & metzler 2000 ; heavens 2000 ) .",
    "we introduce two statistics for measuring two - point spin correlations",
    ". the two - point correlation function of spin directions is simply , @xmath206 the function @xmath207 ^ 2 \\rangle-{\\frac}{1}{3}\\ ] ] measures the correlation of spin axes independent of the sense of rotation , and is therefore more directly relevant to the intrinsic correlations of shape orientations that mimic lensing signal .    in",
    "we compare the functions @xmath208 and @xmath209 , at different epochs of the simulation , with the prediction of ttt as evaluated from the initial density and velocity fields .",
    "we see in the simulation that at high redshift there is a positive spin ",
    "spin correlation at separations of a few comoving megaparsecs , but the correlation signal on these scales is much weaker at @xmath74 .",
    "this is mainly due to non - linear effects . on the other hand ,",
    "the ttt approximation maintains the same correlation function at all times , because it keeps the spin directions fixed , by construction . at @xmath73 , ttt matches well the simulation data , and since it always builds upon the initial conditions , it maintains the same correlation signal at late times as well .",
    "the linear ttt approximation naturally fails to include the non - linear effects that weaken the correlations on scales @xmath4 , and it thus overestimates the correlation at late times .",
    "the weakening of the correlation signal on the scales shown can be attributed to two non - linear effects .",
    "first , the members of galaxy pairs tend to get closer due to the evolving clustering .",
    "second , the spin directions themselves evolve away from the ttt predictions . as a result of the first effect",
    ", the linear correlation signal simply shifts to smaller scales .",
    "the interpretation of the second could be that non - linear dynamics erases the linear spin - spin correlations on all scales , while non - linear halo - halo interactions build up a new correlation signal on small scales ( note , for example , that for @xmath210 , @xmath211 is positive at @xmath73 , while it is not positive at @xmath74 ) .",
    "we distinguish between these effects by also showing in the spin - spin correlation functions as computed using the ttt predictions for the halo spins but located at the actual halo positions at @xmath74 .",
    "even though this model does a better job than linear ttt , it still over - predicts the correlations measured in the simulations at @xmath74 .",
    "this demonstrates that non - linear halo - halo interactions and angular - momentum exchanges with additional infalling material play an important role in determining spatial spin correlations on small scales . using a simulation of higher resolution",
    ", one can indeed detect significant spin correlations at @xmath74 on scales below @xmath212 ( dekel 2000 ) .",
    "since present - day galactic discs have been probably assembled sometime around @xmath213 , we also compute spin - correlations for haloes selected at that epoch . in",
    ", we show the results for @xmath214 haloes containing 100 particles or more ( left panel ) , and for @xmath215 haloes containing at least 10 particles ( right panel ) .",
    "linear correlations are significantly weakened by non - linear effects already at @xmath213 .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the amplitude of the correlation function @xmath209 for haloes selected at @xmath216 in our simulation is in good agreement with the observed alignment of galaxy shapes in the local galaxy population ( e.g. see figure 1 in pen 2000 ) .",
    "this indicates that spin correlations between dark matter haloes might be related to the correlations of galaxy shapes .    in summary :",
    "our results show that linear ttt over - predicts spin - correlations for non - linear dark matter haloes by a factor of a few .",
    "therefore , caution should be applied when using standard ttt to predict the effects of intrinsic alignments in weak lensing studies .",
    "an alternative model for spin - spin correlations have been proposed by lee & pen ( 2000 , lp ) and pen ( 2001 ) .",
    "it is also based on linear perturbation theory , but it tries to bypass the difficulties associated with determining the inertia tensor of protohaloes by assuming that the spin directions are statistically correlated with the local tidal field in a specific way .",
    "the basic ansatz is @xmath217 where @xmath218^{1/2}$ ] is the trace - free unit shear tensor , and @xmath219 is a correlation parameter , whose value is to be determined .",
    "the average is over all possible inertia tensors that are compatible with a given realization of the tidal field .",
    "one then assumes that the inertia tensors of protohaloes at different locations are statistically independent ( which is questionable , since the inertia tensors are found to be strongly correlated with the tidal field ; see paper ii ) .",
    "this allows one to perform the ensemble average in two steps , first averaging over the inertia tensors for a given tidal field , and then over the realizations of @xmath99 .",
    "this leads to @xmath220 while @xmath221 is non - gaussian , @xmath222 is assumed to be gaussian , so one can proceed with the calculation if one is willing to assume further that @xmath223 applying wick s theorem , lp obtained this way the approximation @xmath224 ^ 2 ,   \\label{eq : lp_eta2}\\ ] ] where @xmath225 and @xmath226 are respectively the two - point correlation function and the variance of the mass overdensity field smoothed on the typical proto - halo scale . by including all the terms of the same order as @xmath227 , catelan & porciani ( 2001 ; equation 20 ) provided the more complete expression : @xmath228 where @xmath229 . for scale - free power spectra , @xmath230 is indeed proportional to @xmath227 , as in .",
    "spin - spin correlations as predicted by are compared to the simulation results in and .",
    "we see that there is a reasonable qualitative agreement , but not in quantitative detail .",
    "the smoothing length adopted to compute the analytic prediction corresponds to the mass of the smallest ( and most abundant ) haloes in each figure . note that , because of the @xmath231 term at the denominator , the analytic result for @xmath230 ( with a fixed @xmath219 ) depends strongly on @xmath92 for separations much larger than the smoothing length .",
    "the value of the parameter @xmath219 is fixed by matching the prediction and the numerical result at @xmath232 .",
    "for the haloes selected at @xmath74 , it is @xmath233 at @xmath73 , and @xmath234 at @xmath74 .",
    "however , a direct estimation of @xmath219 in , using the @xmath235 correlations found in the same simulation in paper ii , yields different results .",
    "for example , considering haloes selected at @xmath74 , we find @xmath236 at @xmath73 , and @xmath237 at @xmath74 , namely , a difference by a factor of two to four .",
    "this difference seems to indicate that either or some of the simplifying assumptions leading to are not good approximations .",
    "it is also worth noticing that , for a given spin correlation function , the value of @xmath219 in must depend on the scale over which the tidal field is smoothed .",
    "we find that this dependence is likely to be spurious , because when we evaluate @xmath219 directly from using two alternative smoothing kernels ( either corresponding to the halo mass or 8 times bigger ) we see no significant scale dependence ( paper ii ,  7 ) .",
    "the dependence on the smoothing radius implied by probably originates from the questionable assumption made in .",
    "this ambiguity regarding the scale dependence may affect the interpretation of the observed tidal field , which can be measured reliably only on scales much larger than the galactic scales where @xmath219 is defined .",
    "for example , lee & pen ( 2001 ) measure @xmath238 from the pscz data smoothed by wiener filter on large scales , and then obtain @xmath239 by extrapolation to galactic scales using the ambiguous scale dependence implied by . by construction , does not account for non - linear effects , which affect both the spin direction and the clustering growth , but we see that its accuracy is limited even in the linear regime . the fact that with @xmath240 provides an approximate description of spin correlations in our simulation at @xmath241 and in observational data should therefore be attributed to a lucky coincidence .",

    "we have evaluated the performance of linear tidal - torque theory in predicting the spin of galactic haloes using @xmath80 well - resolved virialized dark - matter clumps extracted from a cosmological @xmath0-body simulation .",
    "we defined haloes in today s density field using the standard friends - of - friends algorithm , but it would be useful for future work to check robustness to alternative halo finders as well as to different cosmological scenarios .",
    "we found that , for a given proto - halo at the initial conditions , ttt provides a successful order - of - magnitude estimate of the final halo spin amplitude .",
    "the ttt prediction matches on average the spin amplitude of today s virialized haloes if linear ttt growth is assumed until about @xmath242 , or about 5/9 of the turn - around time for each halo .",
    "the random error , from halo to halo , is about a factor of two .",
    "this makes ttt useful for studying certain aspects of galaxy formation , such as the origin of a universal spin profile in haloes ( bullock 2001b ; dekel 2001 ) , but only at the level of average properties .",
    "non - linear evolution causes significant variations in spin direction , which limit the accuracy of the ttt predictions to a mean error of @xmath2 . furthermore",
    ", spatial correlations of spins on scales @xmath4 are strongly weakened by non - linear effects .",
    "this limits the usefulness of ttt in predicting intrinsic galaxy alignments in the context of weak gravitational lensing ( catelan 2001 ; crittenden 2001 ) .",
    "this situation may improve if the orientations of today s discs were determined by the halo spins at a very high redshift , which are better described by ttt .",
    "on the other hand , we know this only for the haloes selected at @xmath74 , and not necessarily for the subhaloes which host disc formation at higher redshifts .",
    "a detailed study of this effect would require a high - resolution simulation in which a detailed galaxy formation scheme is incorporated .",
    "a preliminary analysis performed by using dark matter haloes selected at @xmath213 showed that , also in this case , non - linear effects decrease linear spin - spin correlations by a factor of a few .    for practitioners of ttt",
    ", we found that the standard approximations made in ttt , such as the second order expansion of the zeldovich potential , and the smoothing of the shear tensor on the proto - halo scale , are hard to improve upon .",
    "the inaccuracies in the ttt predictions are dominated by real non - linear effects rather than the above approximations .    in order to deepen our understanding of how ttt actually works , we investigate in paper ii the cross - talk between the proto - halo inertia tensor and the external shear tensor .",
    "we find to our surprise that they are strongly correlated , in the sense that their minor , major and medium principal axes tend to be aligned , in this order .",
    "this means that the angular momentum , which plays such a crucial role in the formation of disc galaxies , is only a residual which arises from the little , @xmath243 per cent deviations from perfect alignment of @xmath244 and @xmath245 .",
    "we find there that the @xmath246 correlation induces a weak tendency of the proto - halo spin to be perpendicular to the major axis of @xmath244 , but non - linear changes in spin direction erase almost any memory of the initial shear tensor , and therefore observed spin directions can not serve as very useful indicators for the initial shear tensor ( cf .",
    "lee & pen 2000 ) .",
    "on the other hand , the strong @xmath246 correlation investigated in paper ii provides a promising hint for how to solve a long - standing problem in galaxy formation theory , of identifying the boundaries of proto - haloes in cosmological initial conditions ( porciani , dekel & hoffman , in preparation ) .    in our studies of the cross - talk between the different components of ttt",
    ", we have also realized another surprise that leads to a revision in the standard scaling relation of ttt ( while 1984 ) .",
    "we find in paper iii ( porciani & dekel in preparation ) that the off - diagonal , tidal terms of the deformation tensor , which drive the torque , are weakly correlated with the diagonal terms , which determine the overdensity at the proto - halo centre .",
    "the latter enters the ttt scaling relation via the expected collapse time of the proto - halo , and the weak correlation with the torque leads to a modification in the scaling relation .",
    "the revised scaling relation can be applied shell by shell , together with an extended press - schechter recipe for merger history , in order to explain the origin of the universal angular - momentum profile of haloes ( bullock 2001b ; dekel 2001 ) .",
    "it can also be very useful in incorporating spin in semi - analytic models of galaxy formation ( maller , dekel & somerville 2002 ) .",
