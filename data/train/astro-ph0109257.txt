    "one of the key problems discussed over the last three decades is the evolutionary status of i zw 18 : is this galaxy young or old ?",
    "the evolutionary status of i zw 18c has not been discussed in comparable detail .",
    "high signal - to - noise spectra of i zw 18c reveal blue continua and show only emission and absorption hydrogen balmer lines .",
    "heavy element emission lines are not detected in the spectra , which precludes a metallicity determination of i zw 18c .",

    "however , the spectra obtained for i zw 18c allow to study stellar populations and constrain their age with various techniques .",
    "a useful technique for determining the age of a galaxy is to fit its observed spectral energy distribution ( sed ) by theoretical seds calculated for various stellar population ages and star formation histories .",
    "this method ( alone or in combination with photometric data ) has been applied to some extremely metal - deficient bcds with @xmath19 = ( 1/20  1/40)@xmath18 ( e.g. , sbs 0335052 ( izotov et al .",

    "it was shown that , after subtraction of ionized gas emission , the underlying stellar components of these galaxies are consistent with populations not older than a few hundred myr .",
    "however , the spectral energy distribution fitting method is subject to uncertainties in the extinction , resulting in an age overestimate , if the adopted extinction is too low .",
    "therefore , other methods are desirable to constrain the stellar population ages .",
    "we discuss in this section two such methods , one relying on the balmer nebular emission line equivalent widths and the other on the balmer stellar absorption line equivalent widths .      on the assumption of a dust - free ionization - bounded h ii region , the strongest hydrogen recombination emission lines h@xmath0 and h@xmath1",
    "provide an estimate of the age of the young stellar population when o and early b stars are still present .",
    "however , even if dust is present in h ii regions , the age estimate is quite robust .",
    "this is because the ionizing flux from such a young stellar population and hence the equivalent widths of the balmer emission lines have a very strong temporal evolution .",
    "therefore , the dating method based on the h@xmath0 and h@xmath1 emission lines is relatively insensitive to dust extinction .",
    "the h@xmath0 and h@xmath1 emission lines are detected in i zw 18c in both regions c and e ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "their fluxes and equivalent widths are listed in table [ tab1 ] . the exception is the keck ii spectrum of region e , where h@xmath1 emission was not detected .",
    "this non - detection is probably due to the patchy distribution of the ionized gas . in fig .",
    "[ fig3]a we compare the measured h@xmath0 and h@xmath1 emission line equivalent widths with those predicted for an instantaneous burst as a function of age .",
    "the theoretical dependences have been kindly calculated for us by d. schaerer using the schaerer & vacca ( 1998 ) code with the @xmath19 = 0.0004 geneva evolutionary tracks from lejeune & schaerer ( 2001 ) .",
    "they are shown by solid lines .",
    "the age derived from different hydrogen nebular emission lines in the various spectra is in a narrow range around @xmath5 15 myr .",
    "hence , the gas in i zw 18c is likely to be ionized by early b stars .",
    "another method of stellar population age determination is based on the equivalent widths of absorption features .",
    "this method probes larger ages as compared to the previous method because the most prominent hydrogen absorption lines are formed in the longer - lived a stars .",
    "gonzalez delgado & leitherer ( 1999 ) and gonzalez delgado , leitherer & heckman ( 1999 ) have calculated a grid of synthetic profiles of stellar hydrogen balmer absorption lines for effective temperatures and gravities , characteristics of galaxies with active star formation .",
    "they developed evolutionary stellar population synthesis models , synthesizing the profiles of the hydrogen balmer absorption lines from h@xmath1 to h13 for an instantaneous burst with an age ranging from @xmath20 to @xmath21 yr .",
    "the calculations were made for a stellar initial mass function with salpeter slope and with mass cutoffs @xmath22 = 1 @xmath23 and @xmath24 = 80 @xmath23 .",
    "the h@xmath2 , h@xmath3 and higher order hydrogen absorption lines due the underlying stellar populations are clearly seen in the keck ii spectra of i zw 18c ( fig .",
    "[ fig2]a - [ fig2]b ) .",
    "some hydrogen absorption lines are also seen in the 4 m kpno and mmt spectra ( fig .",
    "[ fig2]c - [ fig2]d ) .",
    "however , the signal - to - noise ratio is not high enough in the latter two spectra to measure equivalent widths .",
    "although higher - order hydrogen balmer absorption lines are seen in the spectrum of i zw 18c , they are not suitable for age determination because of ( a ) the relatively low signal - to - noise ratio at short wavelengths and uncertainties in the placement of the continuum in the blue region caused by many blended absorption features , and ( b ) the weak dependence of their equivalent widths on age ( gonzalez delgado et al . 1999 ) .    in table",
    "[ tab2 ] we show the equivalent widths of the h@xmath3 and h@xmath2 absorption lines measured in the spectra of regions c and e in i zw 18c .",
    "we need to correct the equivalent widths of the absorption lines for the contamination by nebular emission . for region",
    "c we use the intensity of the h@xmath1 emission line to calculate the intensity of the h@xmath3 emission line adopting case b at the electron temperature of @xmath5 20000k ( e.g. , aller 1984 ) .",
    "we do not use the h@xmath2 absorption line in the spectrum of this region because of the strong contamination by nebular emission .",
    "the h@xmath1 emission line is not definitely detected in the keck ii spectrum of region e. for this region , the intensity of h@xmath0 emission line is used to correct equivalent widths of the absorption lines for the same effect .",
    "the corrected equivalent widths of h@xmath3 and h@xmath2 absorption lines are shown in table [ tab2 ] .    in fig .",
    "[ fig3]b we show by solid lines the predicted behaviour of the equivalent widths of the h@xmath2 and h@xmath3 absorption lines with age for an instantaneous burst at a metallicity @xmath19 = 1/20 @xmath18 ( gonzalez delgado et al . 1999 ) .",
    "the measured equivalent widths are shown for region c by filled circles and for region e by stars .",
    "their values are consistent with an age of @xmath5 15 myr .",
    "this age estimation is in excellent agreement with that obtained from the nebular emission line analysis implying that the light of i zw 18c is dominated by a young stellar population .",
    "however , the age we derive here is significantly lower than the value of 40 myr derived by dufour et al .",
    "( 1996b ) for the brightest stars from",
    "_ hst _ cmds of i zw 18c .",
    "although our two age estimates are consistent with each other , there are a number of uncertainties which may affect the result .",
    "a major uncertainty is the unknown metallicity of the stars in i zw 18c .",
    "we have assumed for simplicity the metallicity to be equal to that of the ionized gas in i zw 18 .",
    "note , however , that a lower stellar metallicity would increase the age and vice versa .    to estimate an age from the emission lines",
    "we have assumed a dust - free ionization - bounded h ii region .",
    "if the h ii region is density - bounded or dust is present , then some of the ionizing photons escape the h ii region or are absorbed .",
    "equivalent widths of the balmer emission lines give in this case an upper limit to the age .",
    "another source of uncertainty comes from the small number of massive stars in i zw 18c .",
    "our age estimates are based on models where the stellar initial mass function is well - behaved and can be approximated by an analytical function .",
    "however , small number statistics can introduce stochastic fluctuations at the high star mass end of the imf .",
    "recently cervio , luridiana & castander ( 2000 ) have analyzed how such stochastic effects influence the observed parameters of young stellar clusters with solar metallicity such as the h@xmath1 equivalent width and the number of the ionizing photons .",
    "the number of ionizing photons in i zw 18c derived from the h@xmath1 emission line ( table 1 ) is @xmath5 2 @xmath15 10@xmath25 s@xmath14 and 4 @xmath15 10@xmath25 s@xmath14 for the e and c regions respectively . with an equivalent width @xmath5 6  7   of the h@xmath1 emission line , this corresponds to the case of a 10@xmath26 @xmath27 stellar cluster ( cervio et al .",
    "for such a cluster the age variations at a fixed h@xmath1 equivalent width can be as high as 15 percent at the 90% confidence level .",
    "hence , the age of i zw 18c derived from the emission lines can lie in the range @xmath5 10  25 myr , with a central value of 15 myr .",
    "similarly , age estimates based on absorption lines can also be slightly modified by stochastic effects .",
    "however , calculations are not yet available in the literature .",
    "gonzalez delgado et al . ( 1999 ) do not calculate the temporal evolution of the equivalent widths of the balmer absorption lines for the heavy element mass fraction @xmath19 = @xmath18/50 .",
    "therefore , we use models with @xmath19 = @xmath18/20 .",
    "extrapolation to the metallicity of i zw 18 would result in a @xmath6 1  decrease of the equivalent widths at a fixed age , or an age increase of up to 25 myr .    finally , the age determination depends on the star formation history in the galaxy which we consider next .",
    "our estimates for the stellar population age in i zw 18c in sect .",
    "[ ageem ] and [ ageab ] are based on the assumption of an instantaneous burst of star formation .",
    "now we discuss how that age changes if continuous star formation is considered .",
    "we adopt a constant star formation rate in the interval between the initial time @xmath28 when star formation starts and the final time @xmath29 when it stops .",
    "time is zero at the present epoch and increases into the past .",
    "using model equivalent width of the emission and absorption lines and spectral energy distributions for instantaneous bursts ( schaerer , private communication ; lejeune & schaerer 2001 ; gonzalez delgado et al .",
    "1999 ) , we calculate the temporal evolution of the hydrogen emission and absorption line equivalent widths for continuous star formation . the results of calculations are presented in figure [ fig3 ] . by dashed , dot - dashed and dotted lines are shown the temporal dependences of the equivalent widths of the h@xmath1 and h@xmath0 emission lines ( fig .",

    "in other words , the equivalent widths of the above four lines in the spectrum of the stellar population formed between @xmath28 and @xmath29 have a value @xmath30 at time @xmath28 in fig .",
    "[ fig3]a and [ fig3]b . at a fixed @xmath30 , the general trend seen from fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] for continuous star formation is that the younger the youngest stars , the larger the time interval @xmath31 , and the older the oldest stars .",
    "another feature is that , at a fixed age @xmath29 of the youngest stars , the age @xmath28 of the oldest stars derived from the observed emission line equivalent widths , differs from that derived from the observed absorption line equivalent widths . in particular , in the model where star formation stopped 5 myr ago ( dashed lines ) , the age of the oldest stars derived from hydrogen emission lines exceeds 100 myr , while the age of the oldest stars derived from hydrogen absorption lines is only @xmath5 50 myr .",
    "this model seems to be excluded by consideration of the luminosity of the ionizing radiation .",
    "the most massive stars in the stellar population with age 5 myr would have masses as high as 40 @xmath27 ( meynet et al .",
    "the number of the ionizing photons produced by a single 40 @xmath27 star is equal to @xmath32(lyc ) @xmath33 1.5 @xmath15 10@xmath34 s@xmath14 ( vacca , garmany & shull 1996 ) , larger than that derived from the observed flux of the h@xmath1 emission line in i zw 18c ( table [ tab1 ] ) , assuming an ionization - bounded h ii region .",
    "there can be an upward correction factor of @xmath6 2 due to the extinction , but the corrected @xmath32(lyc ) would still be below the value for a single 40 @xmath27 star .",
    "these estimates can however be modified by massive star small number statistics caused by the stochastic nature of star formation .    though smaller , the difference between the age of the oldest stars derived from the equivalent widths of emission lines ( 50 myr ) and that derived from the equivalent widths of absorption lines ( 40 myr ) , is present in the continuous star formation model with age of the youngest stars equal to 8 myr ( dot - dashed lines in fig .",

    "if star formation is continuous , then the equivalent widths are best reproduced by a short star formation episode continuously occurring between @xmath5 10 myr and @xmath5 25 myr ago .",
    "uncertainties in the observations and models may extend this range to between @xmath5 10 myr and @xmath6 100 myr ago .",
    "spectral energy distributions of the central ( c ) and eastern ( e ) regions of i zw 18c are used to derive extinction .",
    "the equivalent widths of the hydrogen emission and absorption lines and the spectral energy distributions are modeled by a 15 myr single stellar population if the extinction coefficient @xmath35(h@xmath1 ) = 0.1  0.3 , corresponding to @xmath4 = 0.20  0.65 mag .    \\3 . with the usually assumed distance of @xmath5 10 mpc the stellar population age derived from _",
    "color - magnitude diagrams is too large as compared to the young age derived from the spectroscopic data .",
    "one possible source of the difference is interstellar extinction .",
    "furthermore , to have agreement between the cmds and the ionization state of i zw 18c , the distance to the bcd should be increased to @xmath5 15 mpc .",
    "concerning the extended emission around i zw 18 , keck ii spectra show h@xmath0 emission as far as 30  from the main body .",
    "the equivalent widths of emission lines are particularly strong in the extended envelope ( @xmath30(h@xmath1 ) = 471 ) , implying a dominant contribution of the ionized gas emission in the outermost regions of i zw 18 . within the large uncertainties of the continuum level ,",
    "the emission at @xmath5 15  from i zw 18 is consistent with pure ionized gas emission .",
    "we do not find evidence for an old extended low - surface - brightness stellar component in the outlying regions of i zw 18 down to the surface brightness level @xmath7 @xmath5 27 mag arcsec@xmath8 , contrary to suggestions by kunth & stlin ( 2000 ) .",
    "it will be very difficult to detect the extended stellar emission at @xmath7 @xmath5 28 mag arcsec@xmath8 postulated by legrand ( 2000 ) , because of the important ionized gas emission at large distances .",
