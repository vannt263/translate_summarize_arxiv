    "residual finiteness is one of the most important algebraic finiteness conditions , and has been widely studied in the context of groups , semigroups , monoids and other algebraic structures . in group theory , following the famous results of malcev @xcite and other pioneers such as hirsch @xcite , gruenberg @xcite and hall @xcite , there is now a large body of literature devoted to this property ; for an early survey see @xcite . in semigroup",
    "theory early work had a similar nature as in groups ; for example see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "samples of more recent work can be found in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , .",
    "the work on residual finiteness in other algebraic structures includes rings and modules ( @xcite , @xcite ) , lie algebras ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , lattices ( @xcite ) , and universal algebra ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to discuss residual finiteness for monoids .",
    "associated with an arbitrary monoid @xmath0 are a number of natural actions . a monoid acts on its green s @xmath4-classes via right multiplication , and , dually , on its @xmath5-classes via left multiplication ( see section [ sec2 ] for background on green s relations ) .",
    "of course @xmath0 also acts on its elements by right multiplication . arising from this action",
    "is a family of groups , called the schtzenberger groups of @xmath0 , found by taking the action of the set - wise stabiliser of an @xmath6-class @xmath7 , restricted to @xmath8 and made faithful by factoring out the kernel .",
    "these groups encode much of the group theoretic structure of @xmath0 .",
    "for instance , every maximal subgroup of @xmath0 arises as a schtzenberger group .",
    "the obvious connections between actions and congruences leads one to consider the relationship between residual finiteness of @xmath0 and the properties of the natural actions associated with @xmath0 outlined above .",
    "more precisely , here we will explore the connections between a monoid @xmath0 being residually finite and the residual finiteness of :    * the schtzenberger groups of @xmath9-classes of @xmath0 ; * the action of @xmath0 on its @xmath2-classes ; * the ( left ) action of @xmath0 on its @xmath1-classes .    for a while during this investigation the authors had hoped that the following general assertion might be true : a monoid is residually finite if and only if its schtzenberger groups , and its actions on @xmath1- and @xmath2-classes are all residually finite .",
    "for instance , golubov @xcite proves that a _ regular _ monoid in which each @xmath3-class @xmath10 has only finitely many @xmath1- and @xmath2-classes is residually finite if and only if all its maximal subgroups are residually finite . here",
    "the maximal subgroups _ are _ the schtzenberger groups , while the finiteness condition on @xmath3-classes ( we will call this _ finite type _ ) implies residual finiteness of the actions on @xmath1- and @xmath2-classes ( see theorem [ thm10 ] ) .",
    "sadly , our hopes were premature : the desired general result does not hold in either direction , as we will see below .",
    "in this paper we will systematically compare and contrast regular and non - regular monoids , in the following situations :    * general monoids ( section [ sec3 ] ) ; * monoids in which every @xmath3-class is of finite type ( sections [ sec4 ] and [ sec4b ] ) ; * monoids with finitely many left- and right ideals ( section [ sec5 ] ) .    section [ sec4a ] contains a couple of further auxiliary results , concerning ideals and rees quotients .",
    "we state our results for monoids , for the sake of convenience of having an identity element around .",
    "the results remain valid verbatim for semigroups , which can be seen by utilising the standard device of adjoining an identity element to a semigroup .",
    "the results of the paper are summarised in table  [ table1 ] .",

    "this is equivalent to the following properties :    * there exists a congruence @xmath15 of finite index ( i.e. with finitely many classes ) on @xmath0 such that @xmath16 ; * the intersection of all congruences of finite index on @xmath0 is trivial .",
    "green s equivalences @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath9 and @xmath17 are defined as follows : @xmath18 also for a set @xmath19 we let @xmath20 a monoid @xmath0 is said to be _ regular _ if for every @xmath21 there exists @xmath22 such that @xmath23 . in a regular monoid every @xmath1-class and every @xmath2-class contain at least one idempotent . if an @xmath9-class contains an idempotent , then it is a group ; these are precisely the maximal subgroups of @xmath0 .    clearly",

    "let us fix an element @xmath53 , and let @xmath505 satisfy @xmath506 , and @xmath507 ( such elements exist by proposition  [ schutzstabproperties ] ( iii ) ) . since the schtzenberger group @xmath508 is residually finite , there is a normal subgroup @xmath12 of @xmath51 of finite index such that @xmath509 and @xmath510 belong to different cosets of @xmath12 in @xmath51 .",
    "let @xmath511 ( @xmath512 ) be the cosets of @xmath12 in @xmath51 where @xmath513 , and let @xmath514 now partition @xmath7 as @xmath515 where @xmath516 . observe that the @xmath419 blocks are preserved by right multiplication from @xmath45 , for @xmath517 for all @xmath518 , @xmath492 .",
    "let @xmath489 be the equivalence relation on @xmath0 with equivalence classes given by the partition @xmath519 , where @xmath520 .",
    "we claim that the right congruence @xmath521 has finite index .",
    "once established , this will complete the proof of the theorem , since @xmath388 and @xmath444 belong to different equivalence classes of @xmath489 and hence belong to different classes of @xmath521 . in order to prove that @xmath521 has finite index it suffices to prove that the collection of sets @xmath522 , @xmath492 , @xmath523 ( see ) is finite .",
    "note that @xmath524 .",
    "thus it is sufficient to prove the following      to prove the claim , let @xmath492 and fix a finite cross - section of the @xmath4-classes of @xmath0 .",

    "pick an element @xmath527 .",
    "denote by @xmath528 the @xmath4-class of @xmath0 that contains @xmath7 .",
    "since @xmath4 is a right congruence , we have @xmath529 .",
    "since @xmath530 it follows that @xmath531 ; let @xmath532 be the @xmath6-class of @xmath533 .",
    "since @xmath534 it follows from proposition  [ schutzstabproperties ] ( iv ) that @xmath535 , and we can partition @xmath57 into blocks @xmath536 where @xmath537 is a fixed element of @xmath57 .",
    "these blocks have the property that for all @xmath538 , and all @xmath539 , we have @xmath540 if and only if @xmath541 .",
    "suppose that @xmath542 .",
    "we claim that @xmath543 indeed , if @xmath544 then since @xmath545 we can write @xmath546 for some @xmath547 . now @xmath545 and @xmath548 which implies that @xmath549 .",
    "it follows that @xmath550 and therefore that @xmath551 . since @xmath552 we can write @xmath553 where @xmath554 .",
    "now we have @xmath555 proving the direct inclusion of .",
    "the converse inclusion may be proved using a symmetric argument .",
    "note that the collection of sets @xmath556 , appearing as the right hand side of , is finite .",
    "indeed , it depends only on : ( i ) @xmath526 , one of the finitely many @xmath4-class representatives ; ( ii ) @xmath557 , one of the finitely many @xmath6-classes in @xmath528 ; and ( iii ) @xmath558 , one of the finitely many blocks of @xmath557 .",
    "this completes the proof of claim , and also of the theorem .",
    "we observe that theorem [ thm16 ] and its proof remain valid if finiteness condition on @xmath0 is weakened to the following : @xmath0 has finite @xmath3-type , and for every @xmath3-class @xmath10 there are only finitely many @xmath3-classes above it .",
    "( compare this with ( * ? ? ?",
    "* corollary 4.3 ) , where the same finiteness condition appears in a slightly different guise . ) an anonymous referee of a precursor to this paper pointed out that with only a little extra work the second of these assumptions can be further weakened to the following : for every @xmath21 there exist @xmath559 such that @xmath560 and the intervals @xmath561 $ ] , @xmath562 $ ] are finite .",
