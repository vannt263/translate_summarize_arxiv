    "the malfunction of the delivery of lipids and cholesterol from the liver to the cells has important ramifications .",
    "there is strong medical evidence linking high plasma concentrations of low - density lipoproteins ( ldl ) to the development of atherosclerosis , the deadliest disease in industrialised countries  @xcite .",
    "however , ldl is just one species in a metabolic cascade by which different lipoproteins  ( table  [ table0 ] ) are synthesised , degraded and absorbed . in this complex network",
    ", it is important to investigate how metabolic control is exercised and if dynamical features , other than high ldl concentrations , could be useful markers for the detection of disease states .",
    "previous modelling efforts of lipoprotein metabolism vary in scope .",
    "some models have concentrated on detailed aspects of the system , such as the fluid dynamics of lipid accumulation on the arterial walls  @xcite or the chemical kinetics of ldl oxidation  @xcite , but do not describe the processes at the cellular or physiological level .",
    "other approaches have modelled the lipoprotein network as a whole with linear compartmental models  . although these models can be fitted to match experimental data , the compartments lack rigorous physiological meaning , thus making it difficult to describe the underlying biochemical processes .",
    "for instance , compartments added to represent subclasses of lipoproteins can always be reduced to one compartment because of the linearity of the models  @xcite .",
    "our model of lipoprotein metabolism is a relatively low - dimensional system of nonlinear differential equations which are strongly linked to the underlying physiological processes .",
    "the system can undergo a transition between low and high ldl steady states , a feature which is robust to randomness and uncertainty in the parameters .",
    "because the equations are directly related to physiological processes , the model can be used to study the effect of genetic or behavioral conditions and could serve as an aid to test hypotheses for diagnosis and intervention . in what follows",
    ", we derive our model from the main physiological processes ; we then analyse the system and carry out a sensitivity analysis ; finally , we show how the results can be related to experiments and medical conditions .",
    "lipoproteins constitute the primary means of transport of lipids from the liver to the cells via the blood stream .",
    "lipoprotein dynamics is intimately connected to lipid and cholesterol metabolic networks .",
    "figure  [ fig7 ] provides a schematic overview of the origin , transport and fate of the different lipoproteins in the human body at two levels : the macroscopic and the cellular .",
    "lipoproteins are globular aggregates of lipids and proteins : cholesterol ester and triacylglycerol form the core ; amphiphilic phospholipids surround them forming the hull ; and different apolipoproteins ( apo a , apo b , apo c , and apo e ) , which function as trigger - molecules for specific reactions , are embedded in the surface .",
    "lipoproteins are classified in five standard groups ( table  [ table0 ] ) , based on density and the apolipoproteins attached to them . in increasing order of density and decreasing order of size ( the fewer lipids relative to its size , the denser the lipoprotein is ) : chylomicrons ( chyl ) , very low - density lipoproteins ( vldl ) , intermediate - density lipoproteins ( idl ) , low - density lipoproteins ( ldl ) , and high - density lipoprotein ( hdl ) .    .*the properties and composition of the five standard lipoprotein classes * @xcite : chylomicrons ( chyl ) , very low - density lipoproteins ( vldl ) , intermediate - density lipoproteins ( idl ) , low - density lipoproteins ( ldl ) , and high - density lipoproteins ( hdl ) . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      +    most of the medical observations in  @xcite refer to mutation classes 3 and 4 , both hetero- and homozygous . in terms of our model ,",
    "heterozygous mutations 3 and 4 would halve @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "this produces roughly a two - fold ( up to four - fold ) increase in @xmath2 $ ] , as deduced from the lower bound in  ( [ bound2 ] ) and table  [ table1 ] .",
    "one of the homozygous mutations blocks the binding of both idl and ldl to lr , hence @xmath3 .",
    "again from  ( [ bound2 ] ) , this would increase @xmath2 $ ] by a factor @xmath4 , which is roughly 10-fold ( and up to several hundred times - fold ) .",
    "these numerical factors correspond well to those in the literature  @xcite . under another homozygous mutation 3 and 4 ,",
    "ldl receptors bind to idl but not to ldl , i.e. , @xmath5 .",
    "this produces an increase of @xmath2 $ ] in the lower branch by a factor of @xmath6 , which is two - fold ( up to nine - fold ) but still an order of magnitude smaller than that of the other homozygous case .",
    "moreover , the characteristic time scale for the catabolism of ldl ( see section  [ section : time - dependent ] ) increases from @xmath7 ( around two days ) to @xmath8 ( over a week ) .",
    "again , this coincides with experimental observations that the removal of ldl from the plasma is delayed and the increase in plasma ldl is moderate  @xcite .",
    "medical evidence for mutations 1 - 2 and 5 is scarcely reported . in our model",
    ", they would translate into an increase of @xmath9 which would have a small effect on the plasma concentrations on the lower cholesterol branch .",
    "however , as seen in eqs .",
    "( [ bif_reduced1 ] )  and  ( [ bif_reduced2 ] ) , an increase in @xmath10 would lower the bifurcation point , making it easier to jump to the high cholesterol branch in response to an increase in @xmath11 or a decrease in @xmath12 .",
    "therefore , under these mutations the parameter region where the lower cholesterol regime exists would be reduced .",
    "other observations in  @xcite could also be interpreted in terms of our model .",
    "for example , it was reported that despite treatment with statins and lipid - lowering medications , the plasma cholesterol of some patients remained between 600 and @xmath13 , five to ten times the normal levels . as seen in figs .",
    "[ bifd ]  and  [ bifd2 ] and discussed further in section  [ section : slow_drift ] , the presence of bistability means that once on the upper branch it is more difficult to return to the low cholesterol state by reducing @xmath11 , e.g.  through statin medication .",
    "another intriguing observation is the dramatic clinical variability among fh patients with the same genetic mutation .",
    "a possible explanation is the robustness of @xmath14_{eq}$ ] to variations in the physiological parameters .",
    "indeed , from the lower bound in  ( [ bound4 ] ) we estimate that @xmath14 $ ] would only increase by 1.1 to 1.5 times under homozygotic fh , while the corresponding increase in @xmath2 $ ] would range from one to almost three orders of magnitude .",
    "this would allow the development of individuals who would have similar levels of intracellular cholesterol while the ldl plasma levels could be very high in some cases , with different clinical consequences .",
    "the time scales of the system span from a few hours up to a week .",
    "these time scales govern the way in which the system responds to external drives or perturbations to the variables .",
    "to clarify their dynamical role , we use singular perturbation methods to obtain slow and fast manifolds  @xcite relevant to the system .",
    "we have seen previously that the lower bound  ( @xmath15 ) and upper bound  ( @xmath16 ) are approached asymptotically as @xmath17 and as @xmath18 , respectively . in these singular asymptotic limits ,",
    "the system  ( [ full1])([full5 ] ) reduces to a linear system of the form : @xmath19 where @xmath20\\ [ idl]\\ [ ldl]\\ [ ic]]^\\mathrm{t } , \\quad \\mathbf{b}=[u_v\\ 0\\ 0\\ 0]^\\mathrm{t}$ ] , @xmath21 , \\ , \\",

    "the inverse of the matrix eigenvalues are the characteristic times for each variable to return to equilibrium : @xmath23 all of them given in hours .",
    "note that the slowest time scale increases from @xmath7 ( on the scale of a day ) on the lower branch to @xmath8 ( over one week ) on the upper branch .",

    "( b ) bottleneck dynamics caused by the ` ghost ' saddle - node around the bifurcation .",
    "the jump to the upper branch occurs a year after a small , but permanent , perturbation of @xmath11 has occurred . ]",
    "the response of the system to a slowly drifting input @xmath27 , which varies on a time scale slower than @xmath8 , will be quasi - static , tracking the equilibrium points .",
    "this can reveal nonlinear behaviour , such as hysteresis and bottleneck phenomena  @xcite , which can have physiological ramifications .    if the system is in a parametric region where it can undergo bifurcations ( as in figs .",
    "[ bifd ] and [ bifd2 ] ) , it will exhibit standard hysteresis when @xmath11 is swept continuously from the lower branch to the upper branch and backwards ( figure  [ fig : hyster_ghost]a ) .",
    "this means that once in the upper branch it is more difficult to return to the low cholesterol state by reducing @xmath11 ( e.g. , through statin medication ) .",
    "another effect of the existence of saddle - node bifurcations is the possibility of bottleneck dynamics caused by saddle - node ghosts .",
    "this can translate into long - lived transients when the system is parametrically close to the bifurcation points .",
    "figure  [ fig : hyster_ghost]b shows the time evolution of the system for two values of @xmath11 , one below and one above ( but very close ) to the bifurcation .",
    "the former remains in the low cholesterol branch and the latter jumps the high cholesterol solution .",
    "however , although the actual transition is relatively sudden ( on the order of a week , @xmath8 ) , it occurs after a prolonged period of more than a year in which the system behaves as if in the ( no longer existing ) low cholesterol state .",

    "$ ] is relatively insensitive to the oscillatory drive , while @xmath31 $ ] exhibits large oscillatory amplitudes both for small and large drives .",
    "however , the salient feature is the different amplitude of the response of @xmath14 $ ] in both regimes .",
    "qualitatively , this can be understood from the fact that @xmath14 $ ] changes from being tightly linked to @xmath31 $ ] at low drives , when the amount of ldl receptors is high , to being governed by @xmath2 $ ] on the upper branch , where the low @xmath32 makes idl endocytosis virtually impossible while ldl can still be absorbed through the non - receptor mediated route .",
    "a quantitative understanding of the responses in figure  [ graph6 ] emerges from a more detailed analysis . if we consider a periodic input @xmath33 it follows that the time response of the asymptotic system  ( [ eq : linearasymptotic ] ) is sinusoidal of the form @xmath34 with average @xmath35 and amplitude @xmath36 .",

    "however , the _ relative _ amplitude of the oscillations of @xmath2 $ ] in both asymptotic regimes is of the same order .",
    "it is precisely at the bifurcation point , when the system oscillates between the low and high cholesterol regimes , that the oscillations are larger in relative terms ( figure  [ 100days ] ) .",
    "this could be used to characterise the system if sufficiently frequent measurements are available .",
    "understanding lipoprotein metabolism is important because high lipoprotein concentration in the plasma is a major risk factor for atherosclerosis , the most common cause of death in western societies .",
    "we have introduced a dynamical model of lipoprotein metabolism derived by combining physiological cascading and cellular processes .",
    "the model goes beyond compartmental models in that we have included both the nonlinear absorption of idl and ldl by cells , and a feedback mechanism by which the cell regulates the number of its ldl receptors based on the concentration of intracellular cholesterol ic .",
    "this low - dimensional , nonlinear model shows bistability and hysteresis between a low and a high cholesterol state . our bifurcation analysis of the key control parameters ( @xmath11 and @xmath12 ) can be related to physiologically meaningful processes : diet and statin medication in the case of @xmath11 ; reverse cholesterol transport through hdl in the case of @xmath12 .",
    "we have checked that the observed behaviour is relatively robust with respect to all other parameters .",
    "an important outcome of our sensitivity analysis is that the most robust feature in the low cholesterol state is the concentration of intracellular cholesterol @xmath14 $ ] , while the plasma concentrations @xmath31 $ ] and @xmath2 $ ] can vary widely .",
    "this indicates that plasma cholesterol is not a tightly controlled variable in the system , implying that very different values of plasma @xmath2 $ ] can be compatible with viable cellular function .",
    "it is conceivable , however , that the high levels of @xmath2 $ ] , innocuous at the cellular level , could lead to the initiation of disease - linked processes at the physiological level .",
    "we have also obtained estimates for the characteristic time scales governing the dynamics of the model in the low and high cholesterol states .",
    "these time scales account for the dynamical responses of the system to forced input oscillations with very different periods .",
    "the model shows dynamical behaviour which could be used to diagnose the state of the system if repeated measurements of plasma and/or cellular cholesterol with the correct timing and periodicity are performed , as indicated by figs .",
    "[ graph6 ]  and  [ 100days ] .",
    "if measurements are too sparse , the onset of permanent high cholesterol levels might go undetected , with the possibility of a difficult return to lower levels due to hysteretic effects .",
    "measurements taken periodically on the order of hours or months could provide complementary clues to the state of the system . if we assume that periodic inputs to the system are important , measuring the relative variability of ldl and cellular cholesterol ( possibly through skin tests ) could lead to markers for the detection of the intrinsic regime of the system .    our dynamical model is directly derived from the underlying physiological and cellular processes . however , some of our approximations are crude and several directions for improvement could be pursued .",
    "the level of the plasma cholesterol on the high cholesterol branch ( @xmath54_{eq}+[idl]_{eq}+[ldl]_{eq}$ ] ) is unphysiologically high in the current model .",
    "this suggests the presence of other physiological mechanisms of elimination that have not been included in the model .",
    "another extension would include time delays  @xcite to account for mass transfer ( e.g. , the delayed intake of idl and ldl via lr - mediated endocytosis ) and control mechanisms ( e.g. , the delayed genetic regulatory loop in the synthesis of lr ) .",
    "furthermore , the model could be extended to include explicitly the regulatory and synthetic pathways involving the intracellular ldl receptors .",
    "it would also be important to distinguish between hepatic and non - hepatic cells , as hepatic cells play a more central role in lipoprotein metabolism .",
    "in particular , the rate of lipoprotein uptake in liver cells is different ; increased uptake of ldl in liver cells lowers the production rate of vldl ( i.e. , @xmath11 ) through an additional regulating feedback ; and statins reduce the inhibiting effect of @xmath14 $ ] on the synthesis of lr in liver cells only .    especially important would be to extend our description of reverse cholesterol transport to include @xmath55 $ ] explicitly as a variable .",
    "indeed , @xmath56 of the total plasma cholesterol in healthy individuals ( @xmath57 ) is carried by hdl .",
    "our preliminary work in this direction indicates that the number of nonnegative equilibria remains unchanged in the enlarged system that includes @xmath55 $ ] , and the qualitative features of the system should hold . because the relationship between plasma @xmath2 $ ] and @xmath55 $ ] is of major importance in clinical trials , this would be a crucial element to enhance the applicability of the model .",
    "further modelling of lipoprotein metabolism could bring light to several open questions . to name but a few ,",
    "it is still unknown why the plasma cholesterol concentrations in adult humans are so unnecessarily high  @xcite ; what the exact effects of statins in the metabolic system are  @xcite ; and which of the processes could be best targeted to reduce plasma ldl concentrations .",
