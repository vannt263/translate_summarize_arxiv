    "every ( abstract ) graph has a realization as a geometric graph ( by simply mapping the vertices into distinct points in the plane , no three of which are collinear ) , and every planar graph can be realized as a plane graph by fry s theorem  @xcite .",
    "the number of @xmath1-vertex labeled planar graphs is at least @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "however , there are only @xmath4 plane graphs on any given set of @xmath1 points in the plane  @xcite .",
    "we consider a generalization of plane graphs . a geometric graph @xmath2 is _ @xmath5-plane _ for some @xmath6",
    "if it admits a partition of its edges @xmath7 such that @xmath8 are each plane graphs .",

    "denote by @xmath9 the family of @xmath5-plane graphs with vertex set @xmath0 . with this terminology , @xmath10 is the family of plane graphs with vertex set @xmath0 , and @xmath11 is the family of 2-plane graphs ( also known as _ biplane graphs _ ) with vertex set @xmath0 .    in this and a companion paper  @xcite , we study @xmath11 and contrast combinatorial properties between plane graphs @xmath10 and biplane graphs @xmath11 .",
    "plane graphs have limitations in achieving some desirable properties , such as high connectivity , as it is known that every plane graph @xmath12 has a vertex with degree at most @xmath13 , hence @xmath14 ( we use standard graph theory notation as in  @xcite ) .",
    "it is natural to expect that significantly better values can be obtained if the larger family @xmath11 is used .",
    "this is precisely the topic we explore in these papers , mostly focusing on graph size and vertex connectivity .",
    "one reason for the study of the family @xmath11 , instead of the most general family @xmath9 , is that testing when a geometric graph is @xmath5-plane can be done in @xmath15 time for @xmath16 , but it is np - complete for any @xmath17  @xcite . on the other hand , to imagine biplane graphs we can suppose that the plane has two sides , with the vertices of a graph being on both sides but each edge on only one side . in this way , biplane graphs can model some physical networks , as , for example , printed circuit boards ( pcb ) .",

    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    note that the above generalization of plane graphs is reminiscent to , although more restrictive than , the notion of thickness , geometric thickness , and book thickness , which are defined for abstract graphs  @xcite .",
    "we recall their definitions for ease of comparison . the _ thickness _ of an ( abstract ) graph @xmath2 is the smallest @xmath6 such that @xmath18 admits an edge partition @xmath7 with the property that @xmath8 are each planar graphs .",
    "the _ geometric thickness _ of an ( abstract ) graph @xmath2 is the smallest @xmath6 such that @xmath18 admits an edge partition @xmath7 satisfying that @xmath8 can be simultaneously embedded as plane graphs where the vertex set is mapped to a common labeled point set .",
    "the _ book thickness _ is a restricted version of the geometric thickness where @xmath19 are simultaneously embedded on a point set in convex position .",
    "notice that every @xmath5-plane graph , if interpreted as an abstract graph , has geometric thickness at most @xmath5 , but in addition we are given a specific embedding in the plane in which the decomposition into @xmath5 plane layers is possible . in other words , the term @xmath5-plane graph refers to a geometric object , a drawing , while having geometric thickness @xmath5 is a property of the underlying abstract graph .",
    "for example , the cycle @xmath20 has geometric thickness @xmath21 , but a drawing connecting the points @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 in this cyclic order with straight - line segments would have a crossing and be @xmath26-plane .    for disambiguation , we also mention two additional notions , which are commonly used in the graph drawing community , but have little to do with our subject . an ( abstract ) graph is called _",
    "@xmath5-planar _ if it has a drawing in the plane ( where the edges are jordan arcs ) such that each edge crosses at most @xmath5 other edges .",
    "it is already np - hard to recognize 1-planar graphs  @xcite .",
    "the other notion worth mentioning is _ 1-plane _ , which is used for a specific geometric drawing of a 1-planar graph  @xcite in which edges are crossed at most once .",

    "this involves the concepts of _ maximum _ ( graphs with the largest possible number of edges ) and _ maximal _ graphs ( i.e. , graphs in which the addition of any edge would break the biplane property ) . in section  [ sec : mini ] we formally define both concepts , and study several fundamental properties . among other results ,",
    "we show that two maximal biplane graphs on the same point set do not necessarily have the same number of edges .",

    "recall that a maximal plane graph in @xmath10 is a _ triangulation _ , that is , a plane graph where all bounded faces are triangles , and the boundary of the outer face is the convex hull @xmath30 .",
    "it is well known that any two triangulations on the same point set have the same number of edges . moreover ,",

    "if @xmath380 and @xmath388 , then @xmath120 is a corner vertex , and @xmath120 alone has 14 neighbors .    according to proposition  [ prop : nodiscon2 ] the above result says that if we want to disconnect exactly two vertices from @xmath354 , we must remove at least @xmath241 vertices .",

    "[ prop : nodiscon3 ] for any @xmath389 , and set @xmath286 of size @xmath390 , we have @xmath360 .",

    "3 .   there exists an index @xmath297 such that the line @xmath298 contains a vertex of @xmath280 , and either the four previous lines or the four following lines contain no vertices of @xmath280 .",
    "we now use a reasoning analogous to the one given in proposition  [ prop_10 ] : since @xmath280 is minimal , no vertex of @xmath293 can have a unique neighbor in @xmath280 .",
