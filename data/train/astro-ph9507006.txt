    "the idea that the dark matter in the universe may contain both a ` cold ' as well as a ` hot ' component @xcite first arose as a serious possibility @xcite within the framework of grand unified theories ( which also inspired inflation , cosmic strings , baryogenesis , etc . ) . in the original models the cold component was the axion ,",
    "although nowadays the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) often plays that role .",
    "lightly massive neutrinos are the hot component , and it was usually assumed that the neutrinos would display the hierarchical mass spectrum characteristic of the quarks and charged leptons , with a single neutrino ( _ e.g. _ , @xmath0 ) dominating the mass density of the hot component .",
    "however , it was noted from the beginning @xcite that because of their special nature , nearly degenerate massive neutrinos is a logical , albeit not necessarily the simplest , possibility .",
    "the cosmological implications of neutrinos that are closely degenerate in mass has received much recent attention @xcite , inspired to some extent by the remarkable series of neutrino oscillation experiments ( solar , atmospheric , and more recently accelerator ) which suggest that two or more neutrino flavors may contribute to the hot dark matter in the universe .    before discussing the impact of neutrino oscillation experiments on the cold plus hot dark matter ( c@xmath7hdm ) scenario ,",
    "let us briefly recall why the latter has attracted so much recent attention . from the mid to the late 1980s evidence was mounting that the so - called  standard \" cold dark matter ( cdm ) scenario had trouble providing a consistent explanation of small ( @xmath8 galactic ) as well as large scale structure",
    ". on the contrary , a c@xmath7hdm model ( with @xmath9 ) provided a far more consistent fit to the data @xcite . in order to provide additional tests ,",
    "the quadrupole anisotropy of the microwave background expected in c@xmath7hdm models was estimated in 1989 @xcite and compared with the cdm prediction .",
    "normalized to the ` small ' scale data , it was found that the c@xmath7hdm prediction exceeded the cdm value by a factor of about two , and this was dramatically verified when the cobe team @xcite made its announcement in 1992 @xcite .    in the last two years , particularly after extensive numerical simulations of galaxy and cluster formation @xcite and more detailed analytical work @xcite , additional support for the c@xmath7hdm model has emerged .",
    "it appears that this model provides the simplest ( consistent ) realization of an inflationary scenario for large scale structure formation .",
    "it has recently been pointed out @xcite , ( and our results are in agreement ) that with two or more neutrino flavors contributing to the hot dark matter , somewhat better fits to the present data may be possible . for fixed @xmath10 there is also some dependence both on the spectral index as well as the hubble constant .",
    "it must be admitted , though , that within the framework of grand unified theories , it may not be easy to realize scenarios with two or three nearly degenerate ( in mass ) neutrinos .",
    "furthermore , in some of the scenarios we consider , one needs to invoke a fourth ( sterile ) neutrino which is nearly degenerate in mass with the electron neutrino .",
    "precisely why this singlet state can be so light is an important question for future research .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows . in section 2.1",
    "we list three sets of observations related to solar , atmospheric , and dark matter neutrinos which provide hints for non - zero neutrino masses . for completeness",
    ", we also summarize the results of the lsnd experiment at los alamos , although we will not include them among the constraints to be satisfied .",
    "we then proceed to a discussion of three distinct schemes which are consistent with the observed solar and atmospheric @xmath11 oscillations , and which also allow for neutrino dark matter .",
    "we discuss the implications of these schemes for a variety of experiments , particularly the @xmath12 and @xmath4 oscillation experiments at accelerators . in section 3",
    "we address the main issues raised by neutrino oscillations for cosmological structure formation within the c@xmath7hdm framework .",
    "we review the physics of the differences between having one and more than one massive neutrino flavor , giving some analytic formula to estimate the scale ( section 3.1 ) and amplitude ( section 3.2 ) of the effects on the growth of primordial density fluctuations . in 3.3",
    "we give results of some more detailed numerical computations of the cosmological models based on the solutions to the oscillation data , including some models , in 3.4 , motivated by the lsnd results .",
    "finally , in section 3.5 we discuss the dependence on the cosmological parameters ( hubble constant , spectral index @xmath13 , and baryonic density fraction ) of conclusions drawn from comparing specific models to large scale structure data .",
    "one of the greatest challenges in particle physics today pertains to the issue of the neutrino masses .",

    "[ for completeness , we also summarize the recent findings of the lsnd experiment at los alamos . ] in section 2.2 , we discuss scenarios for neutrino masses and mixings which can simultaneously accommodate these observations .",

    "we feel that this position is justified at this time , especially in view of the fact that a different analysis of the lsnd data has yielded considerably weaker limits on the mixing parameters @xcite .",
    "we find it remarkable however , that independent of the lsnd data , two of the three scenarios which can accommodate points ( 1)(3 ) above , imply an observable signal at accelerator @xmath45 oscillation experiments .",
    "* 2.2 theoretical schemes : *    let us focus on the solar , atmospheric and hot dark matter neutrinos , leaving out the lsnd results which will not play a role in determining the viable scenarios .",

    "assuming that there are no additional light neutrinos , one concludes that the three neutrinos @xmath49 should be nearly degenerate in mass .",

    "the solar neutrino data requires the mass splitting @xmath65 between @xmath14 and @xmath22 to be @xmath118 , but the masses themselves may be in the cosmologically interesting range of a few ev . since this pair behaves like dirac neutrinos , there is no conflict with @xmath119 constraints .",
    "for cosmology however , the hot dark matter may be a linear combination of @xmath14 and @xmath120 .",
    "if the total mass of @xmath121 pair exceeds that of @xmath14 , we call it a ( 2 + 1 ) c@xmath7hdm scheme , and if the @xmath14 mass dominates over @xmath121 , it is a ( 1 + 2 ) scheme . of course , one could also recover the one flavor case by making the mass of @xmath33 pair much smaller than 1 ev .",

    "this basic problem is neatly resolved in a cold plus hot dark matter scenario because the growth of the density perturbations on small scales is damped by the presence of the hot dark matter component @xcite . since the neutrino oscillation experiments may be telling us that the neutrino component is spread among several flavors we would like to understand , in a quantitative way , how this changes the usual ( one flavor ) cold plus hot dark matter model .",
    "we will begin with a general description of the effects of a hot component on the growth of density fluctuations .",

    "the only feature imprinted on the initial spectrum at this time is a decrease of amplitude on length scales smaller than the horizon at matter domination .",

    "baryonic density fluctuations can not grow until the photon temperature decreases to allow the stable formation of neutral hydrogen . because photon ",
    "baryon decoupling does not happen until after matter domination , the baryons are prevented from falling into the gravitational wells supplied by the cold dark matter .",
    "this leads to a damping in the growth of density fluctuations ( relative to a case with no baryons ) .",
    "the amount of damping ( on scales smaller than the horizon size at photon baryon decoupling ) in the final amplitude of density fluctuations is constant , so the effect is quite similar to changing the number of degenerate neutrino flavors .",

[ dampmax ] ) , to get a curve similar to the previous one we can increase @xmath13 to 0.98 , which increases the amplitude at the cluster mass by @xmath264 , ( eq . [ masspect ] ) , so we get very nearly the same fit at the cluster scale .",
