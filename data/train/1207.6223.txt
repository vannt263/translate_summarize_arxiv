    "recent claims by @xcite and @xcite of a cosmic dipole signal in the fine structure constant deriving from their extensive compilation of keck and vlt quasar absorption line measurements have been greeted with a healthy mix of excitement and skepticism by cosmologists at large . while undoubtably controversial with respect to the prevailing picture of a copernican universe , homogeneous in its composition and physical laws on the largest scales , the possibility of _ some _ late - time variation in the `` fundamental constants '' has been expressly identified within a number of well - studied cosmological theories .",
    "the touchstone for skeptical reaction to these claims was in fact the close alignment between the equator of the alleged dipole and the north ",
    "south divide between the sightlines of the two telescopes used to collect these data ; the skeptical interpretation being that systematic errors of opposing sign are to blame for the apparent signal . crucially , while the presence of an unexplained error term in the quasar dataset has been acknowledged by the webb et al .  team , to - date all estimates of statistical significance for the dipole ( i.e. , those by the webb et al .  team and their colleagues at unsw ; @xcite ) have been computed under the assumption of strictly unbiased , normal errors . hence , the motivation for our bayesian re - analysis of the dataset under a variety of biased and unbiased , normal and non - normal error models .",
    "the bayesian model selection ( bsm ) framework used herein aims to identify the most plausible model to explain the observed data ( with the hope of minimizing the posterior predictive error ) from amongst a pre - defined set of hypotheses @xcite .",
    "the quantitative basis for the bsm procedure is , characteristically , a ratio of marginal likelihoods @xcite ; the resulting `` bayes factor '' operating much like an automatic ockham s razor favouring simplicity over complexity ( cf.@xcite ) . as a well - motivated , `` automatic '' procedure",
    "to distinguish between rival theories , given even limited or heterogeneous data , bsm has become highly popular in cosmological ( and astronomical ) research with novel applications @xcite now abounding in the literature and user - friendly software packages for marginal likelihood estimation @xcite readily available .",
    "however , with this powerful machinary at hand it can be all too easy to fall into the trap of navely / lazily applying the bsm technique without due regard for its limitations , most notably the sensitivity of bayes factors to the chosen priors on the internal parameters of each candidate model .",
    "hence , in the present study we give particular attention to demonstrating the key elements of principled bsm with prior - sensitivity analysis @xcite ; in this endeavour we hope to provide a minimal template for future cosmological bsm studies .",
    "though we restrict the present investigation to the usual case of parametric model selection , in a companion work ( paper ii ) we extend our methodology to a potentially more challenging semi - parametric formulation .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in the remainder of the introduction",
    "we give a detailed , historical overview of the observational evidence for and against a cosmic variation in the fine structure constant . in section [ quasardataset ]",
    "we describe the webb et al .",
    "team s publically - available `` quasar dataset '' and give a preliminary investigation into the nature of the unexplained error term .",
    "in section [ generativemodels ] we propose a number of candidate mathematical forms for the latter , explain our choice of prior densities on their governing parameters , and examine the resulting posterior distribution of each . in section [ rlr ] we briefly review the reverse logistic regression procedure for marginal likelihood estimation , before proceeding to report and compare the latter for each hypothesis plus error model pairing ( and to conduct our prior - sensitivity analysis ) in section [ marginallikelihoods ] . finally , we summarize our conclusions and discuss the merits of possible follow - up observational strategies for resolving this debate in section [ conclusions ] .      introduced in 1916 by arnold sommerfeld to abbreviate a recurring , dimensionless factor in his relativistic extension of the bohr model for the hydrogen atom , the fine structure constant , @xmath0 ,",
    "is now recognized as one of the fundamental coupling terms of quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) . in this context",
    "@xmath0 serves to characterize the strength of the electromagnetic interaction and has been humorously dubbed , `` the peter sellers of qed '' @xcite , owing to the many different roles it plays within this theory : setting the scale for all electromagnetic cross - sections , binding energies , and decay rates ; and , of course , the scale of fine structure splitting in atomic and ionic spectral lines ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "defined by the ratio of the squared elementary charge , @xmath1 , to the permittivity of free space , @xmath2 , the reduced planck constant , @xmath3 , and the vacuum speed of light , @xmath4 , @xmath5 the fine structure constant has an on - earth laboratory value , known to remarkable precision through exacting experimentation on quantum scale systems , of @xmath6 @xcite . though nominally designated a `` constant '' there are various theoretical foundations to support a time-/space - varying @xmath0 , if empirical evidence of such can be definitively established",
    "; most notably , within electrodynamic scalar field models @xcite and grand unification theories @xcite . an historical evolution ( with respect to cosmological time ) of the fine structure constant driven by a decreasing speed of light could even offer a compelling solution to the infamous `` horizon problem '' of big bang cosmology without inflation @xcite .",
    "at present there exist just a handful of different approaches , both terrestrial and astronomical , through which one may search for this experimentalist s `` holy grail '' .",
    "these include : ( i ) the in - laboratory comparison of optical atomic clocks @xcite ; ( ii ) the nuclear modelling of samarium isotopes extracted from the oklo natural fission reactor @xcite or rhenium extracted from earth - fallen meteorite samples @xcite ; ( iii ) the cosmological modelling of angular fluctuations in the temperature and polarization of the cosmic microwave background @xcite ; and/or ( iv ) the identification of telltale frequency shifts in @xmath0-sensitive features of astronomical spectra , most notably the fine structure emission lines of ionized carbon observed in radio waves from distant lensed galaxies @xcite and the ionic absorption lines of various species observed in the visible / near - visible light from distant quasars @xcite . after a number of initial disagreements between rival teams ",
    "see @xcite , for instance  now resolved , only the post - millennial quasar - based studies at present claim to have recovered any significant evidence for an evolving fine structure constant .",
    "first identified in 1966 @xcite the distinctive absorption lines apparent to earth - bound observers at uv - to - optical wavelengths in the light from distant quasars arise from the interaction of this light with ions of various species encountered during its passage through intervening gas clouds ; these residing in the extensive halos of both bright , star - forming galaxies and dark proto - galaxies .",
    "the potential of these absorption lines ( especially the singly and triply ionized silicon [ siii and siiv ] doublets ) as probes of the fundamental constants at extra - galactic distances , complementary to the already - used emission line technique @xcite , was quickly realized by @xcite and used to constrain the cosmic variation of @xmath0 to within @xmath710% of its on - earth value ( @xmath8[0.05 ] ) , is used to represent the fractional offset of the fine structure constant in the extra - galactic system under study from its on - earth laboratory value , i.e. , @xmath9/\\alpha_\\mathrm{earth}$ ] . ] in the direction of one particular quasar ( 3c 191 ) .",
    "improvements in astronomical instrumentation have since allowed far stronger constraints on @xmath0 variation to be established through this approach .",
    "@xcite , for instance , have demonstrated @xmath10 ( 95% ci ) in the early universe ( at @xmath74 gyr after the big bang ; @xmath79.4 gyr ago ) through siiv doublet observations along nine quasar sightlines from a ground - based russian telescope ( the bta-6 at the special astrophysical observatory ) .    to search for cosmic @xmath0 variation below this limit ( of roughly one part in ten thousand ) with quasar absorption line spectra",
    "requires application of the `` many multiplet '' ( mm ) technique @xcite in which the relative frequency shifts of _ multiple _ ionic species are simultaneously compared ; the transitions of those species relatively insensitive to @xmath0 variation ( e.g.  singly ionized magnesium [ mgii ] ) effectively serving as calibration benchmarks for the stronger shifters ( e.g.  singly ionized iron [ feii ] ) .",
    "implementation of the mm technique necessarily involves a multi - parameter fit to constrain not only @xmath11 but also a suite of nuisance parameters accounting for the physical structure of the intervening gas cloud ( i.e. , column density , kinetic temperature , and the dominant line broadening mechanism ) . pioneering this technique in 1999 the webb et al .",
    "team @xcite recovered tentative evidence that @xmath0 may have been lower in the past from a sample of 30 extra - galactic absorbers spanning @xmath12 ( here @xmath13 denotes the cosmological redshift of the absorber(s ) under study ) observed with the keck telescope ( @xmath14 \\times 10^{-5}$ ] ) .",
    "this exciting result was quickly heralded as support for a certain class of cosmological model admitting a decelerating speed of light @xcite , though the claimed theoretical basis for the well - publicized davies et al .",
    "interpretation  derived from a ( mistaken ) consideration of black hole thermodynamics  was soon disproven @xcite . more interestingly from a statistical point of view was the webb et al .",
    "team s concern for a possible underestimation of the true errors in their quoted uncertainties , with a remarkably strong dip in their @xmath0 estimates over a narrow redshift interval ( @xmath15 ) suggesting the presence of an unexplained source of observational error .",
    "further post - millennial studies by the same team @xcite with the keck telescope  expanding their original sample to a total of 141 absorbers and their redshift baseline to @xmath16ultimately strengthened the apparent weight of evidence for a time - varying fine structure constant beyond the `` 4@xmath17 level '' ; given the particular assumptions of the statistical analysis employed .",
    "chief amongst these the absence of any _ bias _ in the afore - mentioned unexplained error term  its presence still inferred from a marked excess of the sample variance over that expected from known sources of observational noise , seemingly greatest within the high redshift population . at this time",
    "@xcite proposed a number of potential explanatory factors for an additional error term unique to high redshift systems  including the entry of damped lyman - alpha absorbers ( dense clouds of neutral hydrogen featuring complex velocity structures more challenging to model via the mm technique ) into the sample at @xmath18 ( where the rest - frame ultra - violet of their characteristic spectral lines is redshifted within the optical window accessible to on - earth observers ) .",
    "an alternative hypothesis , the imprint of a spatial variation in @xmath0 ( as we describe below ) , was discounted at this stage as only weakly supported by the available data ( according to a bootstrap significance test ) ; see @xcite .",
    "it was thus a great surprise in 2010 when new @xmath19 estimates for 154 ( primarily southern hemisphere ) absorption systems along 60 quasar sightlines ( 52 new and 8 in common with the original keck sample ) derived by the same team @xcite  but this time using archival spectra from the very large telescope ( vlt ) in chile  appeared to indicate the opposite evolutionary trend with redshift .",
    "namely , that the fine structure constant was in fact higher in the past for these absorbers ( @xmath20 \\times 10^{-5}$ ] ) . to resolve this contradiction",
    "the team were forced to resurrect the spatial variation hypothesis , proposing a smooth transition in @xmath0 across the universe manifest to the on - earth observer as a ( @xmath21-invariant ) monopole plus a ( @xmath21-dependent - invariant dipole , a @xmath22-dependent dipole , and an @xmath23-dependent dipole ( with @xmath23 the cosmological lookback distance ) . all exhibit ( bootstrap randomization - based ) statistical significances of @xmath74@xmath17 over a monopole - only null .",
    "however , we note that : ( i ) a @xmath21-invariant dipole implies a strong breaking of the copernican principle  namely , that the earth - bound observer does not occupy a privileged position within the cosmos ; and ( ii ) the @xmath22- alternative ( which encompasses a close approximation to the @xmath23- model at @xmath24 ) already appears from the @xcite study to be an over - fitting of the available data .",
    "hence , we focus exclusively on the ( monopole+)@xmath23-dipole scenario in the present analysis . for reference ,",
    "this was also the approach taken by @xcite . ] ) dipole field .",
    "we illustrate graphically in figure [ kingmodel ] the nature of the spatial variation in @xmath25 under the best - fit model of this form ( cf .",
    "section [ generativemodels ] ) from @xcite on a color-/symbol - coded map of the celestial sphere .",
    "note the scale of the inferred variation , which is at the @xmath26 level only accessible ( as noted earlier ) via the mm technique .",
    "in figure [ kingdipole ] we present a comparable visualization of the `` raw '' @xmath27 variation in the webb et al .  team s quasar dataset from which the apparent dipole effect was inferred . to this end",
    "we compute in each bin of right ascension and declination containing at least one quasar sightline ( but typically two or more ; noting as well that there are on average 2 - 3 absorbers per sightline ) the weighted mean , @xmath28 here @xmath29 and @xmath30 represent the standard deviations of the explained and unexplained error terms , respectively , in the webb et al .",
    "team s proposed generative model ( which we detail in section [ quasardataset ] ) . despite the substantial degree of noise",
    "evident in these measurements ( note the increase in scale with respect to that of figure [ kingmodel ] ) one may yet discern an excess of negative @xmath19 estimates in the far north and an excess of positive @xmath19 estimates in the far south as per the dipole hypothesis .",
    "though , in anticipation of the skeptical interpretation of these results ( i.e. , that biases of opposite sign in the measurements from each telescope are to blame for the apparent north  south divergence ) , we note also that the equator of the alleged dipole provides a near perfect subdivision of the sample into its vlt and keck constituents .",
    "a `` 4@xmath17 level '' significance for the spatial variation hypothesis was calculated by @xcite through a bootstrap randomization of @xmath25 estimates across sightlines and surveys against the simple monopole ( i.e. , time-/space - invariant with constant [ non - zero ] earth - to - quasar offset ) alternative  a result echoed by @xcite in their review of the dataset using the akaike information criterion , the @xmath31 statistic , and the `` error ellipsoid method '' . with the new vlt sample apparently just as subject to unexplained measurement noise as the original keck dataset , however , a number of strong assumptions were required to justify the significance testing procedures employed . in particular , it was considered necessary to treat the aforesaid as strictly normal and strictly unbiased ( viz .",
    "zero mean and mode ) . assessing",
    "the impact of these assumptions , which are easily relaxed within a bayesian framework as we demonstrate herein , thus represents an essential `` next step '' in the analysis of this observational benchmark given the profound implications for both fundamental physics and cosmology if the dipole interpretation is to become accepted .",
    "following the extensive world - wide media coverage of their work the webb et al .",
    "team s spatial variation hypothesis was strongly criticized in a number of public forums , including the popular science blogs , `` uncertain principles '' by < http://scienceblogs.com/principles/2010/09/>[chad orzel ] and `` cosmic variance '' by < http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2010/10/18/the-fine-structure-constant-is-probably-constant/>[sean carroll ] .",
    "the former citing the evident alignment of the alleged dipole s equator with the coverage overlap of the keck and vlt telescopes ( cf .",
    "figure [ kingdipole ] ) as an indicator that biases of opposite sign in the observations from each might well be to blame ; and the latter citing the extraordinarily low mass - energy budget ( @xmath7@xmath32 gev ) for the underlying scalar field implied by the cosmic expanse of the fitted dipole . from a bayesian perspective",
    "these objections may be viewed as disagreements over the relative prior probabilities of competing proposals .",
    "namely , the degree to which the particular model for the unexplained error term adopted by the experimenters should be favoured over some alternative model ( or family of models ) , and the degree to which the null hypothesis ( of a time-/space - invariant @xmath0 ) should be favoured `` theoretically '' over the proposed dipole hypothesis .",
    "in this study we examine the publicly - available quasar dataset of @xcite : a single catalogue listing for each of the 295 intervening absorbers ( 141 keck plus 154 vlt ) identified along the 131 quasar sightlines probed to - date their mm - based estimates of @xmath13 , @xmath33 , and @xmath29 ; the last a standard deviation characterizing the uncertainty in each @xmath33 estimate arising from explained sources of observational error .",
    "also listed are the j2000 identifier ( encoding right ascension and declination in the equatorial coordinate system ) and redshift , @xmath34 , of each background quasar , the telescope on which the corresponding observation was made , and the @xmath35 group to which that observation has been assigned for error analysis ",
    "namely , vlt , keck low contrast ( lc ) , or keck high contrast ( hc ) .",
    "an additional flag highlights two `` suspect '' absorbers in this catalogue  the @xmath36 system toward j00048@xmath37415728 and the @xmath38 system toward j194454 + 770552 .",
    "these objects were omitted from the webb et al .",
    "team s most recent work , and so for consistency are omitted from our reanalysis as well .",
    "the quasar dataset thus described is available in electronic form from professor michael murphy s http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/~mmurphy/kingj_12a_vlt+keck.dat[homepage ] at the swinburne university of technology .",
    "an astronomical spectrograph , such as hires on keck or uves on the vlt , uses a high - resolution diffraction grating to isolate distinct wavelength components of the incoming light , projecting these onto a charge - coupled device ( ccd ) for digital intensity measurement .",
    "the capture of a raw astronomical spectrum thus constitutes a photon counting experiment in which the count in each pixel of the ccd represents a single draw from a poisson distribution with mean value set by the integrated flux intensity of light ( within a narrow wavelength interval ) from the observed source _ plus _ a contaminating contribution from the background sky and even possibly other non - target emission ( e.g.stray light from other bright sources in the field of view ) ; all _ modulated _",
    "( i.e. , non - linearly transformed ) by the inherent response characteristic of the telescope and device . in the webb",
    "team s analysis multiple such raw spectra for each quasar were sourced from the keck and vlt archives and reduced ( i.e. , combined and `` cleaned '' ) to single sequences of ( high quality ) absorption line profiles ready for modelling .",
    "the reduction process necessarily involves yet further complex transformations of the raw data ( including `` stacking '' , `` flat fielding '' , `` bias frame subtraction '' , `` wavelength calibration '' , `` cosmic ray removal '' , and `` continuum subtraction '' ; the essential cleaning and calibration procedures of precision ccd photometry ) , which ultimately correlate to some extent both nearby and not - so - nearby pixels in the output profile sequence .",
    "however , given the almost overwhelming complexity of accounting directly for each stage of the data reduction pipeline in a statistical modelling context the extent of this correlation is assumed negligible  as is standard practice in the field  with each pixel in the reduced spectrum ultimately treated as independent of all others and assigned an observational standard deviation , @xmath39 .. ]    as noted earlier the mm method for deriving from the reduced spectrum a @xmath25 estimate for each intervening absorber involves a complex multi - parameter fit across its signature absorption lines . due to both natural ( collisional ) and doppler ( thermal and/or turbulent ) broadening , the imprint of each line will be typically spread out over multiple resolution elements and a profile function thus required to characterize its shape and recover its centroid ( i.e. , the precise redshift of that component ) .",
    "the voigt profile function.]with three governing parameters : redshift , column density , and velocity width ; the latter being constrained jointly ( as the kinetic temperature ) across all species detected in the thermal broadening case , but treated as independent in the turbulent case  is well - established as the natural basis for this procedure .",
    "however , the number of such bases required to accurately model a particular system , itself a function of the number of distinct `` velocity components '' present in the intervening cloud , is of course _ a priori _ unknown .",
    "thus , the webb et al .  team chose to fit each absorber sequentially , starting with a single voigt profile function for each line and adding components until a `` statistically acceptable '' solution was achieved @xcite ; with the benchmark for acceptability characterized by a @xmath40-weighted sum of squared residuals ( wssr ) approximately equal to the number of pixels fit minus the number of free parameters ( dubbed , `` the degrees of freedom '' , in their analysis though the fitted model is in fact non - linear )",
    ". the known limitations of the wssr as a stopping criterion for model selection ( cf.@xcite ) may well contribute to the unexplained errors of the quasar dataset discussed below .",
    "of those voigt profile models ( both thermal and turbulent ) tested up to this maximum number of components the model with minimum akaike information criterion ( corrected for small @xmath41 ) was then selected as the best choice for _ refitting _ with @xmath25 ( now ) a free parameter .",

    "team estimate the magnitude of their explained error term , @xmath29 , from the local curvature of the likelihood surface in @xmath25 ; adopting the normal approximation , @xmath42 .",
    "the validity of this approximation to the shape of the likelihood surface in the stated context has been confirmed via markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) exploration , as described by @xcite .      as mentioned in the introduction this estimate of the uncertainty in @xmath43 derived during profile fitting and governed by the ( photon counting ) realization noise of the observed",
    "spectrum has been declared insufficient by the webb et al .",
    "team to explain the apparent noise level in the quasar dataset .",
    "numerous possible reasons for this have been proposed and discussed at length by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these may be divided broadly into two classes : ( i ) methodological limitations of the fitting procedure rendering inadequate the adopted @xmath44 distribution , or ( ii ) hitherto unmodelled sources of additional noise ( possibly systematic ) . from the first class we note",
    "the neglected impact of structural uncertainty in the profile fit with regard to the choice of line broadening mechanism and number of velocity components to include ; with perhaps a tendency toward underestimation of the latter owing to the known pitfalls of the wssr stopping criterion adopted . from the second class",
    "we have the chance blending of lines from absorbers at different redshifts , and/or run - to - run errors in the wavelength calibration solution @xcite .",
    "dedicated investigations of the latter by @xcite and @xcite have exposed the presence of intra - order velocity shifts against iodine cell reference spectra imaged on both the hires and uves spectrographs of sufficient magnitude to potentially impact on estimates of the fine structure constant ; see also the novel asteroid - based calibration study of @xcite .    to account for the inadequacy of @xmath44 in their analysis the webb et al .",

    "while the scaled residuals now bear a greater similarity to the standard normal , from a skeptical perspective the rough agreement seen here can not be considered reassuring , especially given the lack of any strong justification for the supposed form of @xmath73 . by including below a number of plausible parametric alternatives to the webb et al .",

    "although the keck and vlt telescopes cover generally well - separated regions of sky  the hawaii - based keck being largely restricted to targets in the northern hemisphere , and the chile - based vlt restricted to targets in the southern hemisphere ",

    "the predominance of negative differences observed here ( eight of the eleven ) hints at the presence of systematic biases in the @xmath25 values recovered from one or both of these telescopes ; and indeed a wilcoxon signed - rank test @xcite allows rejection of the zero mean difference hypothesis at the 5% significance level ( @xmath76 ) . though admittedly not of overwhelming power due to the small sample size available this result nevertheless serves as further motivation ( in addition to the alignment of the alleged dipole s equator along the coverage overlap of the keck and vlt telescopes ) for the biased error models we consider in our bayesian reanalysis of the quasar dataset below .",
    "having established our motivation for a bayesian reanalysis of the quasar dataset , and for exploring in this context both unbiased and biased error terms , in the introduction and section [ quasardataset ] , respectively , we now proceed to outline formally the generative models and priors required for this endeavour .      in the interests of thoroughness we explore four alternative , parametric forms for the total error term operating in each @xmath35 group ; each candidate form allowing a quite different distribution for the unexplained error component . for reference",

    "one way to do this is via monte carlo simulation of future bayes factors , assuming the dipole plus ( unbiased ) normal error model pairing as truth .",
    "we perform such computational simulations here by repetition over the following procedure .",
    "first , we draw a @xmath232 pair of dipole hypothesis plus @xmath84@xmath84@xmath84 error model parameter vectors from the current posterior . for each of @xmath233 proposed targets",
    "we draw a @xmath234 estimate accordingly with reference to its nominated telescope ( i.e. , @xmath235 group ) , sightline , and redshift , plus a @xmath29 sampled ( with replacement ) from the current quasar dataset .",
    "we then compute the marginal log likelihoods of these mock observations under both the strict null and dipole hypotheses , proposing a biased error model for the former and an unbiased error model for the latter , and treating our current posteriors for each as priors . in the case of limited new data",
    "this computation can be efficiently and accurately performed via importance sampling from our earlier reverse logistic regression draws ; that is , for @xmath233 small enough the updated posterior will not differ too markedly from the current posterior .",
    "for reference we also perform these simulations with unbiased error models assigned to both hypotheses .",
    "the distribution of future bayes factors under a proposed observing strategy approximated in this manner can be termed the `` predicted posterior odds distribution '' ( or ppod ; @xcite ) .",
    "in figure [ future ] we present the ( log ) ppod for three basic targetting strategies , all supposing 25 detected absorbers with @xmath19 measurements from observations on each of the keck and vlt telescopes . )",
    "is consistent with expectations for the ongoing vlt large program @xcite . ] in the first , all targets are supposed placed at the current maximum a posteriori sightline of the pole ( for the vlt ) or anti - pole ( for the keck ) ; in the second , all targets are supposed placed on the dipole s equator ( accessible to both telescopes ) ; and in the third a compromise is made with ten measurements on the equator and the remainder on the pole or anti - pole ( as appropriate ) . as expected it is indeed the first strategy that gives the greatest chance of recovering the desired additional support of a further @xmath2365 on the log bayes factor of the null vs.  dipole comparison with the unbiased error model applied to both .",
    "the mixed targetting strategy performs a little worse than the dipole - only case , while the equator - only strategy performs worst of all . with regards to choosing between the null and dipole when allowing for a biased error model on the former",
    "the performance of our three strategies is in fact reversed , such that the equatorial design offers the greatest chance of a conclusive outcome",
    ". an intuitive interpretation of this result is simply that for distinguishing between a biased and unbiased error model under two competing hypotheses the most effective design is to observe at locations where those underlying hypotheses are already in close agreement .",
    "finally it is worth noting the wide range of predicted bayes factors under all these possible observating strategies , which are so broad as to include a non - trivial possibility of rejecting the true hypothesis despite an optimal experimental design .",
    "this phenomenon arises principally from the broad range allowed for the strength parameter of the dipole , @xmath151 , under the current posterior ( see figure [ mcmcmb ] ) , which gives non - negligible weight to the possibility that the dipole signal is far too small ( with respect to the observational errors ) to confidently recover from an @xmath237 sample .",
    "thus , we reach the final conclusions of our bayesian reanalysis of the quasar dataset . namely , that : ( i ) given both our incomplete understanding of the observational errors and our limited theoretical ( prior ) expectations regarding the properties of any spatial variation in the fine structure constant , the present observational coverage ( featuring limited overlap of the two telescopes for which opposing biases might be suspected ) must be deemed inadequate to properly distinguish the webb et al .",
    "team s proposed dipole field from the ( strict or monopole ) null ; and ( ii ) one can not afford to overlook the importance of observations along the equator of the alleged dipole in additon to those proposed along its poles when planning future campaigns with the keck and vlt telescopes for the purpose of settling this debate .",
    "we have also demonstrated in this study the utility of the reverse logistic regression technique for marginal likelihood computation with efficient prior - sensitivity analysis .",
