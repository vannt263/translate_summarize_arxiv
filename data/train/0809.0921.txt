    "white dwarf stars ( wds ) are the endpoints of evolution for most stars .",
    "their internal structures provide key clues into their complex pre - wd evolution . as wds ,",
    "their subsequent evolution is dominated by cooling .",
    "the older they are , the cooler they become .",
    "why then , does there exist a range of temperatures within which we hardly see any he atmosphere wds ( dbs ) while we see both the h atmosphere wds ( das ) and non - das ( he atmosphere dos and dbs ) at both hotter and cooler temperature than this ?",
    "this paradox is the so - called `` db gap '' ( fontaine & wesemael 1987 ) .",
    "recently , sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) data have shown us that the db gap is not completely void of dbs , but rather deficient in the number of dbs ( eisenstein et al .",
    "the current best explanation for this effect is based on wds having specific layer masses ( the large gravity in a wd makes it compositionally stratified ) which mix and settle at certain temperatures , causing the surface `` flavor '' of a wd to change with time and temperature ( fontaine & wesemael 1987 ) .",
    "this explanation demands a thin h layer in at least a substantial fraction of das .",
    "however , there have been several works ( fontaine et al .",
    "1992 ; clemens 1994 ; fontaine et al . 1994 ; robinson et al .",
    "1995 ; kleinman et al . 1998 ; benvenuto et al . 2002 ) suggesting that perhaps all das have thick h layers and if so , spectral evolution by the current model can not happen .",
    "once a wd cools past the onset of its instability strip ( at a temperature primarily determined by its atmospheric composition and total mass ) , it begins pulsating in a series of non - radial g - modes , allowing us to study its interior via the technique of asteroseismology .",
    "asteroseismology , the study of stellar pulsations , is an important way to directly measure quantities of the stellar interior . and",
    "understanding the interior structure of the dbvs is one very important way to address some of the mysteries of db evolution . among the 9 dbvs known prior to our work",
    ", the first dbv discovered ( winget et al .",
    "1982 ) , gd358 , is by far the best studied wd pulsator .",
    "it has had its internal structure substantially explored by asteroseismology ( winget et al .",
    "1994 , bradley & winget 1994 ; vuille et al .",
    "2000 ; metcalfe salaris & winget 2002 ; metcalfe 2003 ; kepler et al . 2005 ; metcalfe et al .",
    "2005 ) . the results from the asteroseismological investigations of gd358 ( winget et al",
    ". , 1994 ) are impressive : total mass of @xmath0 , he layer mass of log@xmath1 , @xmath2 , he to c transition zone thickness of about 8 pressure scale heights , absolute luminosity log@xmath3 hence a distance of @xmath4 , weak magnetic field of @xmath5 g and the measurements of radial differential rotation .",
    "more recent detailed model fitting techniques using genetic algorithms along with improvements to the models have been successful in revealing even more information .",
    "we now have a measurement of the oxygen mass fraction in the core which places constraints on both the nuclear burning rate @xmath6 and even more detailed structure information , such as the extent of the he / c envelope beneath the pure he envelope ( metcalfe , salaris & winget 2002 ; metcalfe 2003 ; metcalfe et al .",
    "2005 ) . except for one other dbv ,",
    "the rest of the class have not been so forthcoming in revealing their internal structures , primarily due to their lack of the abundance of pulsation modes compared to gd358 s over 100 detected frequencies .",
    "cbs114 is a dbv which showed promise for successful asteroseismological analysis by exhibiting a rich pulsation spectrum , but earlier observational comparisons to the models produced a @xmath7 nuclear burning rate which was at odds with that obtained from gd358 ( handler , metcalfe & wood 2002 ) .",
    "after several years of additional observations of cbs114 , which lead to identifying eleven independent pulsation modes ( four of which were new ) along with improvements in pulsation models and fitting techniques , metcalfe et al.(2005 ) have achieved new asteroseismological results for both stars which are now in agreement with each other .",
    "the one thing cbs114 did not show and which gd358 did were the many fine structure splittings of the pulsation modes caused predominantly by stellar rotation .",
    "our understanding of the pulsation amplitude determining mechanism on these stars is incomplete and we can not explain why we see significant fine - structure splitting in gd358 and not much in cbs114 .",
    "we certainly do not believe it is due to lack of rotation on cbs114 s part though it could be due to the star being observed near pole on .",
    "so the search goes on for a third solvable pulsator to try and distinguish modes , models , fits and reality in these objects .",
    "another important reason to study dbvs is that they are great cosmic laboratories for high energy physics .",
    "winget et al . (",
    "2004 ) predict that hot dbs should have significant plasmon neutrino production .",
    "their db models suggest that 30,000k , @xmath8 dbs have a neutrino luminosity that is 1.8 times higher than their photon luminosity . on the cool end , 22,000k ,",
    "@xmath8 dbv models have a neutrino luminosity less than half of their photon luminosity .",
    "thus the hottest dbvs should be losing energy and cooling significantly faster than the cooler ones . since",
    "a pulsation mode s period is a function of temperature , we can directly measure a star s cooling rate by measuring a mode s rate of period change ( e.g. kepler et al .",
    "2005b ) . and",
    "thus , the dbvs may be quite revealing laboratories for neutrino physics .",
    "finally , an increase in the number of known dbvs will help us understand their properties as a group .",
    "clemens ( 1994 ) and kleinman ( 1995 , 1998 ) found that the da pulsators break down nicely into two distinct classes , each subclass exhibiting common class properties which they have used to investigate the dynamics of the pulsation mechanism in these stars . by increasing the number of known dbvs , we can search for possible subclass distinctions .",
    "nather , robinson & stover ( 1981 ) noted that the interacting binary white dwarf stars will each eventually form a single db at the end of their evolution .",
    "this means that there may be more than one evolutionary channel leading to the dbs .",
    "perhaps we will find two distinct classes , each of them retaining the evidence of their evolutionary paths in their pulsation structures .",
    "sdss is a photometric and spectroscopic survey of the sky covering about 10,000 square degrees around the northern galactic cap ( york et al .",
    "1996 ; stoughton et al . 2002 ; gunn et al . 1998 ; gunn et al .",
    "2000 ) . in sdss",
    "s sixth data release ( adelman - mccarthy , et al .",
    "2008 ) , there are photometry of close to 10,000 square degrees in five filters ( fukugita et al .",
    "1996 ) and 1.27 million spectra .",
    "although the survey s main goal was to produce a 3d map of the large scale structure of the universe , it also contains data on many galactic stellar objects , including wds .",
    "sdss data provide the perfect basis set for finding new dbvs which will eventually help solve the db gap mystery , measure the neutrino production rates inside the dbs , as well as answer some other questions about wd structure and evolution .",
    "kleinman et al . ( 2004 ) published the first wd catalogue based on the spectra obtained by sdss . and doubled the number of then known wds .",
    "the newest wd catalogue from the sdss ( eisenstein et al .",
    "2006b , dr4 wd catalogue hereafter ) has almost quadrupled the number of wds . among the new wds",
    "are dbs whose physical parameters determined from model fitting suggest they are inside the instability strip . therefore , we started a project to search for new dbvs using our spectroscopic fits to sdss spectra , originally from kleinman et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and later using the dr4 wd catalogue , to identify likely dbv candidates and follow them up with time - series photometry .",
    "this survey is the counterpart to the search for new sdss davs reported by mukadam et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , mullally et al.(2005 ) , kepler et al .",
    "( 2005a ) and castanheira et al .",
    "( 2006a , 2007 ) .",
    "we selected our dbv candidates based on the effective temperatures published in the sdss wd catalogues ( kleinman et al .",
    "2004 ; eisenstein et al . 2006 ) .",
    "as described in those works , each spectrum was fit with detlev koester s atmosphere models ( koester et al .",
    "2001 ) to obtain an effective temperature and surface gravity .",
    "the db models used in the catalogues are pure he models .",
    "beauchamp et al . ( 1994 ) showed the physical parameters of the model fit of dbs can change if he atmosphere models with trace amount of h are used .",
    "since we do not know how much h , if any , our candidate sdss dbs have , the pure he atmosphere models fits are as good as any other . given the currently known coolest dbv being 21,800k ( beauchamp et al .",
    "1994 ; castanheira et al .",
    "2006b ) , we chose to select all dbs with effective temperatures higher than 21000k as dbv candidates .",
    "the blue edge of the instability strip is currently defined by ec20058 , the second hottest db known ( beauchamp et al .",
    "1999 ; sullivan et al .",
    "2008 ) prior to the new dbs discovered by the sdss .",
    "the hottest db known prior to the sdss is pg0112 + 104 with @xmath9k which defines the cool end of the db gap .",
    "time series observations of this star have not detected any pulsations ( provencal 2006 ) .",
    "nonetheless , given a boundary determined only by one object , we decided to place no upper limit on our candidate stars effective temperatures .",
    "we observed our dbv candidates using the argos ccd camera ( nather & mukadam 2004 ) on the 2.1 m telescope at mcdonald observatory , spicam on the 3.5 m telescope at apache point observatory and soar optical imager ( soi ) on the southern astrophysical research telescope ( soar ) .",
    "more than half of the new h atmosphere white dwarf variables ( davs ) reported in the past few years have been discovered using argos ( mukadam et al .",
    "2004 ; mullally et al .",
    "2005 ; castanheira et al .",
    "we observed and reduced the data from argos in the same manner as described in mukadam et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and mullally et al .",
    "exposure times ranged from 5s to 30s , depending on the brightness of the target and condition of the sky .",
    "the readout time was negligible due to the use of a frame transfer detector .",
    "for some of the objects , we used a bg40 filter to suppress the redder portion of the flux which is dominated by noise .",
    "after we applied bias and flat field corrections to all ccd frames , we extracted sky - subtracted lightcurves via aperture photometry for the variable candidates and at least one comparison star in the field .",
    "we then divided the target star s lightcurve by the sum of the comparison stars lightcurves to take out any transparency variations in the sky .",
    "we normalized the result so that the average brightness of the star is equal to 0 and the lightcurve shows the fractional intensity variation , and applied a barycentric correction to the times .",
    "the resulting lightcurves for the new dbvs are shown in the left panel of figure  1 .",
    "spicam was not built for fast time series data acquisition and therefore we binned and used partial readout to achieve a reasonable duty cycle for this project .",
    "the binning and window size of the chip depended on the seeing and field of the target since we needed at least one comparison star .",
    "once we acquired the data , we followed a similar procedure as with argos data to produce our lightcurves .",
    "we used soi to discover our 9th dbv .",
    "soi has also contributed to discoveries of 18 new davs ( kepler et al .",
    "2005 ; castanheira et al .",
    "it is a ccd camera with reasonably fast readout time ( 6.3s ) .",
    "we used 30s integration time for the data we gathered on sdss  j085202.44 + 213036.5 again , we followed a similar procedure as with argos data to produce our lightcurves .",
    "table  1 is our journal of observations .",
    "we tried to observe each object for at least two  hours on two separate occasions .",
    "the second observation is to confirm and test the results of the first observation . as you can see from table  1",
    ", we have been able to get the second observation for five of the new dbvs , but not for all of the objects reported in this paper . for the dbs which did not show pulsations during the first observations , additional data are still very important .",
    "the lack of variability in the first observation may simply be due to amplitude modulations or beating of closely spaced modes which are not resolved in our @xmath102 hours observations .",
    "it is also important to obtain a good amplitude limit ( 1mma or smaller ) to which we see no variability since some currently known pulsators have similarly small amplitudes .",
    "we note that some of the das which had no detectable pulsations in mukadam et al .",
    "( 2005 ) turned out to be davs after additional observations lowered the detectable amplitude limit ( castanheira , et al .",
    "both these examples suggest more data are still needed for many of our dbs which did not show pulsations .",
    "figure  1 shows the lightcurves and their fourier transforms for the nine new dbvs we have found so far .",
    "we list the frequencies , periods and the amplitudes of the large observed peaks in the fts in table  2 .",
    "the g magnitudes from the sdss imaging data , the plate , mjd and fiber number which specify unique spectra used for the model fitting , the effective temperature , surface gravity and their uncertainties of each observed object are given in table  3 .",
    "the last column in table  3 indicates if the object was found to vary .",
    "if we saw no variability , then this column contains the amplitude limit ( in mma ) we currently have .",
    "the amplitude limit is defined as three times the average noise between 1000 - 10,000@xmath11hz . for equally spaced data ,",
    "this limit translates into a @xmath12 probability of identifying false peak as a real one ( e.g. kepler 1993 ) .",
    "this frequency range corresponds to periods of 100@xmath13 to 1000@xmath13 where the pulsations in dbvs have been detected .",
    "we also note that some of the lightcurves contain noise at low frequencies ( less than few hundred @xmath11hz which corresponds to several thousand seconds and longer in period ) , probably due to transparency variations or thin cirrus .",
    "if we included this noise in our estimate , our amplitude limits would have been higher and not reflective of our true ability to detect variation within the frequency range of interest .    in figure  2 , we plot the effective temperatures and the surface gravities for dbs in the dr4 wd catalogue . newly found dbvs , represented by large solid dots with their uncertainties in effective temperature and surface gravity , cluster around @xmath14k , although many more objects still need observation ( the hollow dots ) .",
    "we did not plot each set of error bars to avoid clutter in the figure .",
    "many of the dbs for which we did not see any variability ( represented by squares in figure  2 ) have not been observed a second time , mainly because we have not yet had time to do so . as you can see from table  1 , only two objects ( sdss j090409.03 + 012740.9 and sdss j141258.17 + 045602.2 ) were observed more than once with combined amplitude limits of 3.5mma and 2.6mma , respectively .",
    "these amplitude limits are by no means good enough to call them non - pulsators since some wd pulsators are known to have lower amplitudes than this .",
    "our current results are consistent with , but do not demand , a pure dbv instability strip .",
    "we need to eventually achieve at least 1mma detection limit for all the dbv candidates we observe before investigating the purity of the instability strip .",
    "we observed four dbs with @xmath15k , i.e. dbs in the `` db gap '' , but we did not see any pulsations so far . like other dbs we observed and not detected pulsations ,",
    "these objects need to be followed up before they can be declared non - pulsators . in the past",
    ", the instability strip was defined by the 9 known dbvs shown by triangles in figure  2 .",
    "the blue edge of the instability strip was defined by one dbv , ec20058 .",
    "we have not found any pulsator hotter than ec20058 and hence the best chance of determining the neutrino production rates still lies with this star .",
    "from the dr4 wd catalogue , we have about 70 dbv candidates brighter than @xmath16mag . to date ,",
    "we have observed 29 of them and found nine new dbvs , doubling the number of known dbvs .",
    "we seek an increased number of dbvs to help us understand their group properties , better determine the location of the instability strip , and perhaps find hot dbvs we can use to measure their cooling rates and place a limit on the neutrino production rate in their interiors .",
    "based on these statistics , we can expect at least another 12 new dbvs from the dr4 sample and 20 more from dr6 .",
    "these are probably lower limits though , since we suspect additional observations of our 29 currently observed objects will probably reveal new low amplitude pulsators as well .",
