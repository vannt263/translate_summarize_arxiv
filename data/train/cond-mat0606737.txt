    "half metallic heusler alloys ( also known as half metallic ferromagnets , hmf ) are those class of materials in which the majority spin band is of metallic character , while the minority spin band is semiconducting , with a band gap at fermi level ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "this remarkable property makes them potential candidates for magnetic field sensors and spintronics devices .",
    "a large body of literature have been devoted to experimental and theoretical studies of such systems .",
    "the first compound to be identified as hmf by de groot @xcite was nimnsb . since then many different kinds of hmf have been reported , such as zinc - blende structured mnas , cras , crsb @xcite-@xcite , prevoskite structured la@xmath2sr@xmath3mno@xmath4 @xcite , rutile structured cro@xmath5 @xcite and co based co@xmath5mnsn @xcite .",
    "we focus our attention on the pseudo - heusler alloys .",
    "this is a pseudo hmf because unlike hmf it does not show a true gap at e@xmath6 in the minority band .",
    "still this is an important material because of its ferromagnetic character at room temperature and at this particular concentration it shows a high magneto - resistance ratio of up to @xmath7 at a relatively low field of @xmath8 t @xcite-@xcite . in addition it shows phase separation @xcite and tunnel magneto - resistance @xcite-@xcite at room temperature for the magnetic tunnel junction which utilizes and co@xmath5mnal as an electrode .",
    "there have been several theoretical attempts in understanding the electronic and magnetic behavior of heusler alloys . among them",
    "is the full - potential screened korringa - kohn - rostocker(kkr ) method in conjunction with either coherent potential approximation or super cell construction to account for the random distribution of cr and fe atoms .",
    "results using fully relativistic version of the kkr - cpa formalism has been reported in reference @xcite for x = 0 , 0.4 and 1.0 to study the magnetic nature of the alloy .",
    "they have studied the l2@xmath0 , b2 and a2 phases and their combinations separately . for the l2@xmath0 phase and for x = 0.4",
    "their site projected magnetic moment for co , cr and fe were 0.94 , 1.42and 2.92respectively , whereas their experimental values were 1.11 , 0.36and 2.64respectively .",
    "reference @xcite reported super cell based fully relativistic lmto calculation of for x=0 , 0.125 , 0.25 , 0.375 , 0.5,0.625 , 0.75 and 1 .",
    "their observation was , that the concentration and arrangement of fe played a decisive role in determining the magnetic properties of the alloy and its constituents .",
    "their theoretically calculated magnetic moments for fe and co were quite near to their experimental values , but that for cr was highly overestimated .",
    "the large overestimation of the cr moment is common to all the theoretical approaches . for all other phases",
    "their results also show higher magnetic moment than the experimental observations .",
    "miura @xcite theoretically studied the using kkr - cpa formalism .",
    "their findings indicate that spin polarization of at @xmath9 , decreases with increasing fe concentration in both the l2@xmath0 and b2 phases and disorder effect plays a significant role on the spin polarization(at @xmath9 ) at low fe concentration .",
    "elmers @xcite used magnetic circular dichroism ( mcd ) and x - ray absorption spectroscopy ( xas ) to study the experimentally . from these data",
    "they have also obtained site projected magnetic moments using magneto - optical sum rules and have compared them with band structure calculations . recently there has been a spurt in experimental activity on thin films of and .",
    "reference @xcite reported magnetic properties of both @xmath10 polycrystalline and epitaxial @xmath10- structured films on gaas(001 ) substrate .",
    "their observations showed the existence of uniaxial magnetic anisotropy along the [ 1 - 10 ] for . on",
    "the other hand showed an isotropic m - h loop .",
    "in an another work kelekar @xcite reported a method of development of single - phase epitaxial thin films for and observed large hall resistivity in the range @xmath11 @xmath12 m at 5 k for x=0.4 .",
    "in this communication we have investigated the magnetic and electronic properties of the bulk and @xmath13 thin film of hmf alloy , using tb - lmto and asr formalism .",
    "here we have taken @xmath10 unit cell with @xmath14 symmetry , with experimental lattice parameter @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "the co site is at @xmath16 and the al site is situated at @xmath17 .",
    "the fe and cr occupy the @xmath18 site with probability @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the unit cell of a heusler alloy .",
    "this is an ideal case for for the study of partial disorder ( pd ) in the l2@xmath0 phase . here",
    "the @xmath21 and @xmath22 sites are occupied by the respective atoms with probability 1 , and disorder shows up in the @xmath23 sites only .",
    "this consideration is of prime importance in order to account for the occupancy of the sub lattice positions in l2@xmath0 when we are away from the stoichiometric case ( or ) . to mimic a free standing fe / cr and",
    "al terminated partially disordered thin film of , we have considered a nine layer thick films separated by seven layers of empty sphere .",
    "in this section we generalize the tb - lmto - asr formalism to many atoms per unit cell , which is required to study systems having different disorder in different sub lattices . since the recursion method needs a localized , short - ranged basis for its operation , one can implement augmented space recursion in the framework of the tb - lmto formalism .",
    "the second order tb - lmto hamiltonian in the most localized representation is given by ,    @xmath24    where , + @xmath25    * @xmath26 denotes a _ cell position _",

    "to incorporate disorder in the system , we consider @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 to be random , while the structure matrix is non random .",
    "the justification for the non randomness of the structure matrix is that , we calculate properties of those alloys , where the effect due to individual component size mismatch is negligible .",
    "we introduce a site - occupation variable @xmath42 which takes values 0 or 1 depending upon whether site @xmath30 in the @xmath26-th cell is occupied by an a or a b atom . in the absence of short - range ordering ,",
    "the probability density of these variables are given by :    @xmath43    @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the concentrations of a and b components occupying the @xmath30 labeled atom in the unit cell .    for _ partial disorder _",
    "this is a random variable whose probability density depends upon which sub lattice it belongs to , hence the label @xmath30 is associated with it . in terms of @xmath42",
    "the random site and angular momentum diagonal potential parameters take the following form :    @xmath46    where , @xmath47 can be any one of @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "we now obtain the hamiltonian @xmath52 as a function of the random occupation variables by inserting above expressions in @xmath53 and finally inserting @xmath53 in expression ( 1 ) . to set up the effective hamiltonian from which we may obtain the configuration averaged green function , we follow the prescription of the augmented space theorem @xcite . with each random variable @xmath42",
    "we associate an operator * m*@xmath54 whose spectral density is the probability density of @xmath55 .",
    "the theorem tells us that :    @xmath56    the augmented hamiltonian @xmath57 is constructed by replacing the random site occupation variables @xmath58 by their corresponding operators @xmath59 .",
    "the eigenstates @xmath60 and @xmath61 of @xmath59 span the _ configuration space _ @xmath62 .",
    "the effective hamiltonian @xmath57 is an operator in the augmented space @xmath63 , where _ h _ is the space spanned by the tb - lmto basis @xmath64 .",

    "this is called the _",
    "cardinality _ sequence .",
    "the _ average _ configuration is one which has @xmath75 everywhere : or the null cardinality sequence @xmath76 .",
    "a little algebra yields the following : if @xmath77 is a random potential parameter , diagonal in real and angular momentum space ( as defined earlier ) then we may define the following operators in configuration space :    @xmath78    the augmented space hamiltonian then has the following compact form :    @xmath79    thus :    @xmath80    using the augmented space theorem , we can write the expression of configuration averaged green function as ,    @xmath81    where ,    @xmath82    in order to obtain the green function we shall use the recursion method of haydock @xcite .",

    "first , the electronic structure and magnetic properties of pure compounds is compared with the l2@xmath0 partially disordered alloy .",
    "the spin resolved total dos for the three cases x = 0,0.4 and 1 are displayed in figure [ fh1 ] .",
    "it shows that the fermi level is situated in a valley in the minority spin density of states .",
    "it is seen that for x = 0 , spin minority band shows a gap which is a hall mark of hmf , but with increase in the fe concentration first the gap disappears and then for x = 1 it exhibits a sharp dip forming a pseudo gap .",
    "this can be understood from the fact , that with the introduction of disorder in the @xmath23 site , the van hove singularities are washed away and consequently the band gap in the minority state is filled up .",
    "yet , vestiges of the kink singularities remain in the dos as a signature of partial disorder .",
    "the contribution from majority density of states at @xmath1 decreases with increase in fe concentration .",
    "this decrease is monotonic in nature and maximum for . a more detail study of the spin resolved site projected dos ( figure [ fh2 ] ) reveals that in the the bonding states in the minority band is more co like , where the anti - bonding state is dominated by cr .",
    "the same feature has also been reported by earlier studies .",
    "for the structures below the fermi level are dominated by the co majority band . but above @xmath9 it has contribution from both co and fe . in the majority band",
    "we see that the two distinct peaks of fe reinforces the sharp peaks of co. in the the feature is little different .",
    "we see from figure [ fh2 ] that both fe and cr almost retain their structures with respect to parent compounds except the peak in majority band of cr at the @xmath9 has been shifted slightly towards right .",
    "this has major significance in the magnetic moment of cr which we will discuss later .",

    "this is due the fact that it has lost @xmath108 amount of charge ( with respect to pure compound ) from majority band .",
    "a more careful study reveals that major portion of the charge is lost from majority @xmath109 band .",
    "this is also evident in the cr projected dos shown in figure [ fh2 ] where we see that the sharp peak at @xmath9 has been pushed right wards from the fermi level which accounts for the charge loss . since the dos of fe is almost same with respect to , it also retains the value of its magnetic moment .",

    "we have also studied the variation of the site - projected magnetic moments as a function of the fe - cr disorder , which is shown in figure [ magmom ] .",
    "the trends are very similar to those reported earlier ( @xcite ) .",
    "the overestimation of the cr moment , in comparison with experiment , is consistent for all concentrations and of the same order of magnitude as earlier work using different theoretical techniques .",
    "we shall comment on this in our concluding section",
    ".    it would be interesting to compare our density of states results with experimental photoemmission spectra for excited by hard x - rays as reported by wurmehl @xcite .",
    "the experimental data ( figure [ fig11 ] ) indicate a broad feature of width about 2 ev is seen just below the fermi energy .",
    "a second feature is seen between 4 ev and 7 ev below the fermi energy .",
    "the figure [ fig11 ] shows the comparison between the vb - xps data and the total density of states convoluted with the fermi function corresponding to the experimental temperature .",
    "the density of states show two distinct features .",
    "first , the structure due to the @xmath109-states around and just below the fermi energy going down almost 5 ev below it .",
    "below this are the features due to the @xmath110-@xmath111 states down to 10 ev below the fermi energy .",
    "the figure shows that the total width of the structures due to the @xmath109-states has a width of about 7 ev , which is also the conclusion from the high - resolution , high - energy spectra .",
    "the disagreement between the emission spectrum and the total dos is qualitatively similar to the work of wurmehl ( @xcite ) .",
    "the dos shows a maximum at around 1.2 ev below the fermi energy , which is reproduced in the xps .",
    "however , the spectral feature lying from 4 to 7 ev below the fermi energy is not reproduced at all by the local spin - density approximation based theoretical calculations .",
    "this disagreement is qualitatively similar to the earlier works references .",
    "earlier works which ignored disorder suggested that disorder could be a factor , however , our work which includes disorder rules this out .",
    "we may speculate , with wurmehl @xcite that this may point to some deficiencies of the local spin - density approximation .",
    "the methodology we have used to study a ( 100 ) nine layered thin film of is same as that of bulk .",
    "here we have carried out a tb - lmto asr calculation , to obtain the layer , site as well as orbital ( @xmath112-@xmath113-@xmath114 ) resolved density of states .",
    "the recursion method is ideal for application to systems with surfaces .",
    "it was originally suggested by haydock ( @xcite ) precisely for such a problem . with these results at our disposal we have performed a detailed analysis of how charge redistributes itself amongst the various orbitals as a result of alloying in the cr / fe site and due to the quasi two dimensional nature of the system .",
    "the layer resolved dos are shown in figure [ fh3 ] .",
    "all the three surface states(al , fe and cr ) exhibits characteristic surface narrowing due to reduced coordination .",
    "the majority surface state of cr shows a broadening at @xmath1 and is also slightly but importantly shifted towards left , whereas the minority band has almost been pushed out of the @xmath1 , and this is of prime importance , which results in a large increase in the cr magnetic moment in surface .",
    "the majority surface state of fe does not show much change apart from the fact that the lowest lying peak has broadened out compared to bulk .",
    "the structure and height of the minority surface fe are less developed compared to its bulk counterpart below @xmath1 , whereas above the @xmath1 its structure though prominent , is broadened , left shifted and less sharp than the bulk ones .",
    "the layer below the surface layer are occupied by co and its relative peak width and height have changed with respect to bulk co. as as we move down to the central layers , they start resembling the bulk dos for all types .",
    "this reflects a very important phenomenon of electronic structure , that the local density of states is exponentially insensitive to boundary conditions , i.e. , the heine s black body theorem .",
    "table-2 shows the magnetic moments of cr , fe and co in different sites ( layer projected ) of the thin film and bulk .",
    "we can see the magnetic moment for the cr surface state is spectacularly enhanced whereas for the surface fe , the enhancement is more conservative .",
    "the co magnetic moment below the surface is slightly suppressed compared to its bulk value . from third layer",
    "onwards the magnetic moments are more in tune with their bulk counterparts , which is precisely reflected in the layer variation of the dos .",
    "since both , and have been considered in the @xmath115 phase , owing to the cubic symmetry of the crystal structure in this phase , the five - fold degenerate @xmath109-orbitals of the atomic case is broken into the three fold degenerate @xmath116 orbitals ( @xmath117,@xmath118 and @xmath119 ) and the two fold degenerate @xmath120 orbitals ( @xmath121 and @xmath122 ) . but for a ( 100 ) thin film the z - direction is also rendered inequivalent with respect to x and y directions .",
    "this results in further lifting of the degeneracies .",
    "now the out of the five @xmath109-orbitals only two states still retain their degeneracy ( @xmath118 and @xmath119 ) as a signature of the remnant planar x - y symmetry of the smooth thin film . in a ( 100 ) film",
    "the three orbitals have their lobes ( @xmath118,@xmath119and @xmath122 ) pointing towards the vacuum and other two ( @xmath121 and @xmath117 ) have their probability distribution perpendicular to vacuum .",
    "figure [ fh4 ] shows the spin resolved dos for constituent @xmath109-orbitals of surface fe ( upper panel ) and cr ( lower panel ) and are compared with their bulk counterparts .",
    "table-3 shows the ( @xmath112-@xmath113-@xmath114 ) resolved charges and the resulting magnetic moment for surface and bulk states of fe and cr .",
    "the cr majority @xmath117,@xmath118 and @xmath119 surface states show reduction in peak heights for the lower lying states within @xmath1 whereas the peaks near @xmath1 shows a marked sharpening and are importantly shifted to higher energies .",
    "the same can be said about the majority @xmath122 state . for the @xmath121 state ,",
    "its peak near @xmath1 is also shifted toward the left , but not sharpened . below @xmath1 all the minority @xmath109-states of surface cr , with the exception of @xmath121 , are less sharp than corresponding bulk ones , whereas the structure of the dos are more developed above @xmath1 . the @xmath121 state displays an opposite behavior .",
    "consequently , for cr each of the majority @xmath109-orbitals gain a sizable amount of charge compared to bulk , whereas for minority @xmath109-orbitals each of them loses charge , except for a small gain in @xmath123 state .",
    "this results in a large enhancement in magnetic moment of surface cr .",
    "since among all the @xmath109-orbitals minority state of @xmath117 loses the maximum amount of charge , its enhancement is maximum .",
    "the surface enhancement of cr though remarkable is not surprising , as even for a anti - ferromagnetic thin film of pure cr , the surface cr states exhibit a similar enhancement .",
    ".the magnetic moment of fe and cr and co for different layers of the thin film and bulk . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ ttc1 ]    unlike cr at the surface , where the individual @xmath109-orbitals participate in surface enhancement , the magnetic moment of the fe @xmath121 orbital is suppressed .",
    "the majority band of the @xmath121 state of a surface fe has its peak near @xmath1 substantially reduced .",
    "the main role in the magnetic suppression of surface fe @xmath121 state is played by its minority component .",
    "the density of states for minority @xmath121 state is pushed below @xmath1 with respect to the corresponding bulk state .",
    "this results in a gain in charge in the minority state and consequent reduction in the moment of fe .",
    "the fe @xmath118 and @xmath119 at the surface share a similar fate by virtue of remnant planar symmetry .",
    "their majority sates have their low lying peaks within @xmath1 almost at the same energy as that of the corresponding bulk state , whereas the peaks near @xmath1 , are shifted to its left , resulting in small charge gain .",
    "their minority band at the surface have their peaks near @xmath1 are sharpened as compared to the corresponding bulk state resulting in small loss of charge compared to the bulk .",
    "this in turn results in small moment enhancement for @xmath118 and @xmath119 .",
    "the surface @xmath122 of fe displays similar changes as the @xmath118 and @xmath119 states , when compared to its bulk , with the exception that its peak height near @xmath1 is less than that of its bulk . as a result",
    "its contribution to the surface enhancement is less than @xmath118 and @xmath119 states .",
    "the major contribution to the surface enhancement of fe comes from the @xmath117 state .",
    "the reason for this is that its minority band is almost pushed out of @xmath1(i.e .",
    ", to its right ) .",
    "in the majority band the structure near @xmath1 is relatively well developed(i.e .",
    ", compared to its bulk state ) among all the @xmath109-states of surface fe atoms .",
    "it is because of the @xmath117 state , that there is an enhancement in moment of surface fe , despite moment suppression in the @xmath123 state at the surface .",

    "we have presented here a version of the tb - lmto based augmented space recursion technique , modified to include systems with many atoms per unit cell and disorder only in one specific lattice site in the basis .",
    "we have shown that the technique is ideally suited to describe the pseudo - heusler alloy system both in the bulk and at a surface .",
    "we examine the local , component projected magnetic moments , which we believe are sensitively dependent on the accuracy with which we can describe the chemical environment of a component atom .",
    "our predictions agree well with experiment and qualitatively with earlier work .",
    "this is with the exception of the gross over - estimation of the cr moment for all disorder compositions .",
    "all earlier work also overestimated the cr moment quantitatively as much as ours .",
    "the question arises , do we understand why this is so ?",
    "miura @xcite studied the effect of disorder in the al and co sites on the behavior of .",
    "they found that disorder between cr and al hardly changes matters , while the disorder between cr and co leads to a large decrease in the cr moment .",
    "however antonov @xcite argue that such disorder is highly unlikely energetically . that leaves us without a reasonable explanation for the large overestimation of cr moment .",
    "it seems from our work that this discrepancy can not lie at the door of the type of electronic structure method used ( kkr or lmto ) or the method used to deal with the partial disorder ( cpa , supercell or asr ) .",
    "we speculate that this overestimation may be either due to the use of the density functional approximation which can not take into account correlation in the localized @xmath109-states of the constituents properly .",
    "alternatively , one should examine the experimental data in some more detail to determine if sub - lattice disorder does exist because of the way the alloys have been prepared . for the atoms on a ( 100 ) surface of cr shows a very large enhancement of its local magnetic moment .",
    "fe also shows a moderate enhancement .",
