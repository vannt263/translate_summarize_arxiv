    "space - time ( st ) coding is a bandwidth - efficient transmission technique that can improve the reliability of data transmission in mimo wireless systems @xcite .",
    "orthogonal space - time block coding ( ostbc ) is one of the most attractive st coding approaches because the special structure of orthogonality guarantees a full diversity and a simple ( linear ) maximum - likelihood ( ml ) decoding .",
    "the first ostbc design was proposed by alamouti in @xcite for two transmit antennas and was then extended by tarokh _ et .",
    "_ in @xcite for any number of transmit antennas . a class of ostbc from complex design with the code rate of @xmath2 was also given by tarokh _ et",
    "_ in @xcite .",
    "later , systematic constructions of complex ostbc of rates @xmath3 for @xmath4 or @xmath5 transmit antennas for any positive integer @xmath6 were proposed in @xcite .",
    "however , the ostbc has a low code rate not more than @xmath7 for more than two transmit antennas @xcite .    to enhance the transmission rate of the stbc ,",
    "various stbc design approaches were proposed such as quasi - ostbc @xcite and algebraic number theory based stbc @xcite .",
    "the quasi - ostbc increases the code rate by relaxing the orthogonality condition on the code matrix , which was originally proposed in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , independently .",
    "due to the group orthogonality , the ml decoding is performed pair - wise or group - wise with an increased complexity compared to the single - symbol decoding . in @xcite , quasi - ostbc",
    "was studied in the sense of minimum decoding complexity , i.e. , a real pair - wise symbols decoding . in @xcite ,",
    "the pair - wise decoding was generalized to a general group - wise decoding .",
    "the decoding for these codes is the ml decoding and their rates are basically limited by that of ostbc .",
    "the algebraic number theory based stbc are designed mainly based on the ml decoding that may have high complexity and even though some near - ml decoder , such as sphere decoder @xcite can be used , the expected decoding complexity is still dominated by polynomial terms of a number of symbols which are jointly detected @xcite .    to reduce the large decoding complexity of the high rate stbc aforementioned , several fast - decodable stbc",
    "were recently proposed @xcite@xcite .",
    "the stbc proposed in @xcite achieves a high rate and a reduced decoding complexity at the cost of loss of full diversity .",
    "the fast - decodable stbc in @xcite can obtain full rate , full diversity and the reduced ml decoding complexity , but the code design is limited to @xmath8 and @xmath9 mimo transmissions only .",
    "another new perspective of reducing the decoding complexity was recently considered in @xcite and @xcite to resort to conventional linear receivers such as zero - forcing ( zf ) receiver or minimum mean square error ( mmse ) receiver instead of the ml receiver to collect the full diversity .",
    "the outage and diversity of linear receivers in flat - fading mimo channels were studied in @xcite , but no explicit code design was given to achieve the full diversity when the linear receivers are used .",
    "based on the new stbc design criterion for mimo systems with linear receivers , toeplitz stbc @xcite and overlapped - alamouti codes @xcite were proposed and shown to achieve the full diversity with the linear receivers . recently , some other new designs of stbc with linear receivers were proposed @xcite . however , the code rate of stbc achieving full diversity with linear receivers is upper bounded by one .",
    "later , guo and xia proposed a partial interference cancellation ( pic ) group decoding scheme @xcite which can be viewed as an intermediate decoding approach between the ml receiver and the zf receiver by trading a simple single - symbol decoding complexity for a high code rate larger than one symbol per channel use .",
    "moreover , in @xcite an stbc design criterion was given to achieve full diversity when the pic group decoding is applied at the receiver .",
    "the proposed pic group decoding in @xcite was also connected with the successive interference cancellation ( sic ) strategy to aid the decoding process , referred to as pic - sic group decoding .",
    "a few code design examples were presented in @xcite , but a general design of stbc achieving full diversity with the pic group decoding remains an open problem .    in this paper , we propose two designs of stbc which can achieve full diversity with the pic group decoding for any number of transmit antennas .",
    "the first proposed stbc have a structure of multiple diagonal layers and for each diagonal layer there are exactly @xmath10 coded symbols embedded , being equal to the number of transmit antennas , which are obtained from a cyclotomic lattice design .",
    "indeed , each diagonal layer of the coded symbols can be viewed as the conventional rate - one diagonal stbc @xcite .",
    "the code rate of the proposed stbc can be from one to @xmath10 symbols per channel use by adjusting the codeword length , i.e. , embedding different number of layers in the code matrix . with the pic group decoding the code rate of the first proposed full - diversity stbc can be only up to @xmath0 symbols per channel use , i.e. , for two layers . for more than two layers embedded in the codeword ,",
    "the code rate is increased at the cost of losing full diversity with the pic group decoding .",
    "however , with the pic - sic group decoding , the proposed stbc with arbitrary number of layers can obtain full diversity and the code rate can be up to @xmath10 .",
    "the second proposed stbc is designed with three layers of information symbols embedded in the codeword and the pic group decoding can be performed in three separate groups accordingly . without loss of decoding complexity compared to the first proposed stbc",
    ", the second proposed stbc can achieve full diversity and a code rate larger than @xmath0 .",
    "note that the code rate for the first proposed full - diversity stbc with pic group decoding can not be above @xmath0 . in the pic group decoding of the proposed stbc ,",
    "every @xmath10 neighboring columns of the equivalent channel matrix are clustered into one group .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . a system model of st transmission over mimo channels with the pic group decoding",
    "is introduced in section [ sec : system ] . in section",
    "[ sec : new ] , a design of high rate stbc with the pic group decoding is proposed , which contains multiple diagonal layers of coded symbols . for a particular code design with two diagonal layers , the full diversity with the pic group decoding is proved . for the code with pic - sic group decoding , the full diversity is shown for any number of diagonal layers .",
    "several full - diversity code design examples are given in section [ sec : example ] . in section [ sec : xu ] , another design of high rate stbc with the pic group decoding is proposed , which can achieve full diversity with three layers .",

    "the decoding complexity of the zf detection is @xmath63 , i.e. , @xmath33 times of the cardinality of the signal constellation .",
    "it is equivalent to the single - symbol decoding complexity .",
    "the decoding complexity of the ml detection is @xmath64 , i.e. , the complexity of the _ full _ exhaustive search of all @xmath33 information symbols drawn from the constellation @xmath35 .",

    "define index set @xmath65 as @xmath66 where @xmath33 is the number of information symbols in @xmath41 .",
    "we then partition @xmath65 into @xmath67 groups : @xmath68 with @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the cardinality of the subset @xmath71 .",
    "we call @xmath72 a grouping scheme .",

    "if @xmath84 does not have full column rank , then we need to pick a maximal linear independent vector group from @xmath84 and in this case a projection matrix @xmath77 can be found too @xcite .",
    "afterwards , the symbols in the group @xmath76 are decoded with the ml decoding algorithm as follows , @xmath85    the above pic group decoding is connected to some of the known decodings as in the following remarks .",
    "for one special case of @xmath86 , the grouping scheme is @xmath87 with @xmath88 . from ( [ eqn : qp ] ) , we have @xmath89 .",
    "then , the pic group decoding is equivalent to the ml decoding where all information symbols are jointly decoded .    for the special case of @xmath90 ,",
    "the grouping scheme is @xmath91 i.e. , every single symbol is regarded as one group .",
    "then , the pic group decoding is equivalent to the zf decoding where every single symbol is separated from all the other symbols and then decoded .",
    "the pic group decoding with @xmath92 can be viewed as an intermediate decoding approach between the ml decoding and the zf decoding .",
    "alternatively , the ml decoding and the zf decoding can both be regarded as the special cases of the pic group decoding corresponding to @xmath86 and @xmath90 , respectively .    for the pic group decoding ,",
    "the following two steps are needed : the group zero - forcing to cancel the interferences coming from all the other groups as shown in ( [ eqn : gzf ] ) and the group ml decoding to jointly decode the symbols in one group as shown in ( [ eqn : gml ] ) .",
    "therefore , the decoding complexity of the pic group decoding should reside in the above two steps .",
    "note that the interference cancellation process shown in ( [ eqn : gzf ] ) mainly involves with linear matrix computations , whose computational complexity is small compared to the ml decoding for an exhaustive search of all candidate symbols .",
    "therefore , to evaluate the decoding complexity of the pic group decoding , we mainly focus on the computational complexity of the ml decoding within the pic group decoding algorithm . according to _ definition 2 _ ,",
    "the ml decoding complexity in the pic group decoding algorithm is @xmath93 .",
    "it can be seen that the pic group decoding provides a flexible decoding complexity which can be from the zf decoding complexity @xmath94 to the ml decoding complexity @xmath95 .    in @xcite , an sic - aided pic group decoding algorithm , namely pic - sic group decoding was proposed .",
    "similar to the blast detection algorithm @xcite , the pic - sic group decoding is performed after removing the already - decoded symbol set from the received signals to reduce the interference .",
    "if each group has only one symbol , then the pic - sic group will be equivalent to the blast detection .",
    "the performance of a decoding algorithm for a wireless communication system is related to the diversity order .",
    "if the average probability of a detection error for communication over a fading channel usually behaves as : @xmath96 where @xmath97 is a constant and @xmath98 is called the _ diversity order _ of the system . for an mimo communication system ,",
    "the maximum diversity order is @xmath99 , i.e. , the product of the number of transmit antennas and the number of receiver antennas . in order to optimize the reception performance of the mimo system , a full diversity is usually pursued which can be achieved by a proper signal transmission scheme or data format ( e.g. , stbc ) . in @xcite , the `` rank - and - determinant criterion '' of stbc design",
