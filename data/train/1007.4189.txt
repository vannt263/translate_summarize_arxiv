    "in his landmark work of 1968 , brandon carter derived a new constant of motion that pertained to orbital motion in the gravitational field of a kerr black hole ( kbh ) @xcite .",
    "in due course , this constant became known as the carter constant , which joins the set of important constants of motion : orbital angular momentum ( @xmath11 , @xmath12-axis projection ) , orbital energy ( @xmath13 ) , and finally the carter constant ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "these constants of motion can be developed rigorously from the hamilton - jacobi equation @xcite .",
    "an extreme mass ratio binary black hole system is composed of a secondary object ( which may be a compact object ( co ) of several solar masses ) in orbit around a primary object ( which is a massive black hole ( mbh ) of several million solar masses ) . extreme mass ratio inspirals ( emris ) are expected to emit gravitational wave radiation ( gw ) of sufficiently high energy and in the appropriate frequency band for detection by the laser interferometer space antenna ( lisa ) to be feasible @xcite .",
    "the emission of gw causes the constants of motion to evolve , which in turn affects the gw power spectrum .",
    "therefore some useful methods have been developed to describe this evolution .",
    "for example , the quadrupole formalism @xcite and the teukolsky equation @xcite have yielded important results .",
    "the analytical description of the evolution of @xmath1 has been more difficult to achieve than it has for the other two constants of motion @xcite ; although the use of the teukolsky equation has shown great promise @xcite in this endeavour .    as the co inspirals",
    ", the gravitational radiation reaction causes the value of @xmath1 to change @xcite .",
    "therefore a non - equatorial orbit lists as its angle of inclination , @xmath0 , increases with respect to time ; a near - polar prograde orbit becomes polar , and ultimately retrograde @xcite .",
    "such listing behaviour of an inclined orbit has been studied and confirmed using the most current teukolsky - based fluxes @xcite .",
    "it is our goal to develop an analytical and numerical methodology for testing and improving radiation reaction models for predicting orbit listing and inspirals for near - polar orbits .",
    "our interest lies in studying kbh systems ; yet , the schwarzschild black hole ( sbh ) is an important datum .",
    "an infinitesimal amount of spin angular momentum ( @xmath14 ) may be imparted to an mbh such that , for practical purposes , it can be regarded as an sbh ( by virtue of its minuscule effect on the surrounding spacetime ) ; and yet , the spherical symmetry of the system has been broken and a @xmath12-axis defined .",
    "then an sbh can be considered to have a prograde or retrograde inclined orbit ; and the set of polar orbits define the abutment , at which @xmath1 will be at its maximum value ( @xmath1 is non - negative for any bound orbit ) , for given values of @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath5 ( _ ceteris paribus _ ) .    in section [ sec : the - motion - of - a - test - particle ] the motion of a test - particle in an inclined orbit is analysed from first principles @xcite to yield the effective radial potential and an analytical expression of @xmath15 for a last stable orbit ( lso ) . in section [ sec : analysis - of - the - trajectory - equations ] we continue our analysis to find the roots of the effective radial and polar - angle potentials and use them to derive analytical expressions for @xmath16 and @xmath17 ( where @xmath18 ) .",
    "the concept of the abutment is then refined . in section [ sec : the - characteristics - of - the - carter - constant - equations ] , we derive a set of critical formulae that express @xmath1 at the lso , along the abutment , and for the set of polar orbits . the interrelationships between these formulae",
    "are examined and a map of admissible values of @xmath1 , with respect to @xmath2 and @xmath3 is drawn . in section [ sec : the - analysis - of - the - carter - constant ] , this map is used to better understand the path in the @xmath1-@xmath2 plane that is followed by an evolving circular orbit .",
    "we demonstrate the importance of the first and second derivatives of @xmath1 ( on the abutment ) with respect to @xmath2 for understanding the rate of change of @xmath0 as the orbit lists .",
    "we shall use geometrical units by in addition , many of the parameters we use will be normalised with respect to the mass of the black hole ( @xmath19 ) or with respect to the test - particle mass ( @xmath20 ) . in appendix",
    "a , the symbols used in this paper are tabulated . by emphasising normalised variables , the analytical equations and numerical formalism",
    "are much better handled .",
    "a sound mathematical analysis can be made on the assumption that the secondary body is of infinitesimal mass ( i.e. a test - particle ) . in such a case , the background metric of the mbh dominates . in the case of emris",
    ", the small ratio of the co mass to the mbh mass ( @xmath21 ) warrants our use of idealised test - particle calculations @xcite .",
    "we begin by considering a test - particle in orbit about a kbh of arbitrary spin , @xmath5 , for which the four - momentum can be given the general definition @xcite,@xmath22,\\label{eq : fourmomentumnormalised}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where@xmath23 and    @xmath24    unlike the analysis in komorowski et al .",
    "@xcite , we shall use normalised variables at the outset and offer a more thorough treatment . because we are now considering inclined elliptical orbits",
    ", one can not simplify the four - momentum by setting @xmath25 .",
    "but by knowing the carter constant in terms of normalised variables ( i.e. obtained by dividing through by @xmath26 ) , @xmath27 one can obtain the component of orbital angular momentum , @xmath28 , projected upon the equatorial plane of the kbh ,    @xmath29    and substitute it into the expression for the four - momentum :    @xmath30.\\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the invariant quantity ,    @xmath31    is calculated tensorially using the inverse kerr metric ( see appendix b ) and used to develop the radial orbital equation for a test - particle:@xmath32 by setting @xmath33 , equation ( [ eq : orbital_equation_q ] ) reduces to the equation for an equatorial orbit ( see @xcite )    at the radial turning points , @xmath34 .",
    "equation ( [ eq : orbital_equation_q ] ) becomes:@xmath35    in the limit @xmath36 ( set @xmath37 while retaining a non - zero value for @xmath1 ) equation ( [ eq : orbital_equation_q_turning_point ] ) becomes@xmath38 thus , the square of the total orbital angular momentum , @xmath39 , confirms that , for the specific case of an sbh , @xmath1 represents the square of the component of angular momentum projected on @xmath40 plane of the coordinate system ( see appendix b in schmidt @xcite and appendix c in this paper for a more detailed treatment ) .",
    "some important research @xcite has been performed by working with the orbital inclination angle , @xmath0 , instead of @xmath1 ; but in our study , the value of @xmath1 will be taken as a system parameter .",
    "if @xmath1 is chosen to be zero , then the orbital plane coincides with the equatorial plane of the kbh ( i.e. @xmath41 and @xmath42 ) and for a test - particle in a polar orbit ( i.e. @xmath43 and @xmath44 ) @xmath15 must vanish .",
    "the choice of working directly with the carter constant , @xmath1 , as a system parameter is consistent with the approach taken by carter @xcite and more recently emphasised by others @xcite .",
    "to proceed , we use a version of equation ( [ eq : orbital_equation_q ] ) , which is quadratic in , @xmath16 , @xmath45 the roots of this equation can be used to determine the effective potential of the test - particle ( @xmath46):@xmath47 where@xmath48 when the last stable orbit ( lso ) is reached , @xmath16 corresponds to a local maximum of @xmath49 closest to the event horizon .",
    "therefore one calculates the derivative of @xmath49 with respect to @xmath50 and equates it to zero , i.e.    @xmath51",
    "where@xmath52 and@xmath53      we can now develop an equation for the @xmath15 of a test - particle in an inclined orbit about a kbh ( in a manner similar to that described in @xcite ) and extend the concept to general orbits .",
    "it should be noted , the value of @xmath15 considered here is not valid for general orbits , but pertains to the lso . after eliminating the square root in equation ( [ eq : diffvbyr ] ) to yield a new equation that is quadratic in , @xmath54",
    ", the solution is found to be :    @xmath55    which provides a relationship between @xmath15 and @xmath50 ( which here , represents the pericentre radius ) of the test - particle lso .",
    "this result is independent of whether one begins the calculation with @xmath49 or @xmath56 .",
    "one can now plot @xmath15 with respect to the value of the pericentre ( the point of closest approach , @xmath57 ) for an lso for the cases where @xmath58 ( figure [ fig : sbh ] ) , @xmath59 ( figure [ fig : kbh_s_0.5 ] ) and @xmath60 ( figure [ fig : kbh_s_0.99 ] ) .",
    "the values of @xmath15 calculated for an sbh are plotted in figure [ fig : sbh ] for the range of @xmath1 values @xmath61 to @xmath62 .",
    "for an sbh , the prograde ( plus ) and retrograde ( minus ) formulae for @xmath63 ( equation ( [ eq : lzsquared ] ) ) are reflections of one another about the @xmath50 axis ( figure [ fig : sbh ] ) .",
    "but when @xmath64 , the plus equations are pulled below the @xmath50 axis and this symmetry is lost ( figures [ fig : kbh_s_0.5 ] and [ fig : kbh_s_0.99 ] ) . there",
    "now exists a set of retrograde lsos which are governed by the plus form of equation ( [ eq : lzsquared ] ) .",
    "the importance of this fact is revealed when we set the quantity beneath the square root in equation ( [ eq : lzsquared ] ) to zero ; i.e.@xmath65 the polynomial describes the boundary at which the plus and minus equations for @xmath63 are equal and it offers an insight into the behaviour of @xmath1 for lsos that are nearly polar ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "if @xmath37 , then for an elliptical lso @xcite , @xmath67 by substituting equation ( [ eq : r_pericentre ] ) into equation ( [ eq : r_lso_abutment ] ) and solving for @xmath1 , one obtains:@xmath68^{-1}.\\label{eq : q_lz_schwarzschild}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this result applies to lsos at the boundary and specifies an upper limit on @xmath1 for orbits around an sbh .",
    "now we must develop these ideas for general orbits about a kbh that have not yet reached their lso .",
    "there exist four trajectory equations @xcite in two categories :      ( those that are periodic in radius , @xmath50 , or polar angle , @xmath69 )    @xmath70    @xmath71      ( those that are monotonically increasing in azimuthal angle , @xmath72 , or coordinate time , @xmath73 )    @xmath74    @xmath75    see appendix b to see equations for functions @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 .",
    "we have already developed equation ( [ eq : rho - drbydt ] ) in section [ sub : basic - orbital - equations ] ( equation ( [ eq : orbital_equation_q ] ) ) . and equation ( [ eq : rho - dthetabydt ] ) can also be developed by a similar method ( see appendix c ) .",
    "one obtains , _ viz .",

    "the same result is found when starting with equation ( [ eq : rho - drbydt ] ) instead .",
    "two other important integrals that can be calculated for coordinate time and azimuthal angle are given in schmidt ( equations ( 14 ) and ( 15 ) @xcite ) in which a detailed analysis is made on the basis of the hamiltonian .",
    "equation ( [ eq : tao - integral ] ) can be solved to yield elliptic functions @xcite ; therefore , the roots of @xmath83 and @xmath84 contain information necessary for deriving analytical formulae for @xmath1 in terms of @xmath2 and @xmath3 ( for given @xmath5 ) and @xmath0 as a function of @xmath1 .",
    "this will be shown in sections [ sub : roots - of - the - polar - angle - equation ] and [ sec : the - characteristics - of - the - carter - constant - equations ] .",
    "we introduce @xmath18 and convert equation ( [ eq : orbital_equation_q_turning_point ] ) to the form:@xmath85 this substitution is consistent with the approach in @xcite and that undertaken by glampedakis and kennefick @xcite ; and it will help us to derive the latus rectum of the lso . analytically , the use of @xmath17 in this case offers an advantage over the use of @xmath86 .      by finding the four roots of equation ( [ eq : orbital_equation_q_x ] )",
    "one can derive analytical formulae for @xmath87 and @xmath16 , in terms of @xmath3 , @xmath2 , @xmath1 , and @xmath5 , which apply to general orbits ( and are not limited to the lso ) . although the roots are easily obtained in terms of the constants of motion : @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath1 ; they are complicated and as such not helpful . to simplify the analysis",
    ", we assume _ a priori _ that an inclined orbit can be characterised by an eccentricity , @xmath3 @xcite .",

    "simplifies to    @xmath127    which is the expression for @xmath16 in an equatorial orbit .",
    "it is interesting to observe that for an inclined orbit around an sbh ( @xmath37 ) , the equation for @xmath16 ( equation ( [ eq : e4 ] ) ) reduces to @xmath128 which is the expression for orbital energy of a test - particle in orbit around an sbh , ( cutler , kennefick , and poisson ( see equation ( 2.5 ) in @xcite ) ) .",
    "further , this equation for @xmath16 shows no dependence on @xmath1 .",
    "this property is expected since the orbital energy must be independent of orientation in the spherically symmetric coordinate system of an sbh .    in the general case ,",
    "we observe that @xmath16 is a function of @xmath17 ( see equation ( [ eq : e4 ] ) ) ; and thus it is not in explicit form because @xmath18 .",
    "therefore the use of @xmath17 in place of @xmath129 simplifies the analysis by avoiding an unending recursive substitution of @xmath16 into the equation .",
    "although one may derive a formula for @xmath16 in explicit form , it is better to perform the analysis using equation ( [ eq : e4 ] ) .    to calculate an analytical expression for @xmath17 , we substitute equation ( [ eq : e4 ] ) into our original quartic ( equation ( [ eq : orbital_equation_q_turning_point ] ) ) and evaluate it at either @xmath130 or @xmath104 ( the two simplest choices of the four roots ) to yield:@xmath131 by eliminating the square root , and solving for @xmath17 in the resulting quadratic , one obtains :    @xmath132    where@xmath133    @xmath134    @xmath135 @xmath136 and    @xmath137    @xmath138 has a minus and a plus solution , which we will carefully describe in the next section .",
    "we have avoided the analytical difficulties that would arise by working with @xmath15 directly .",
    "indeed , the advantage of using @xmath18 is more than a simple change of variables , but rather an essential step in solving these equations .",
    "the expression for @xmath138 ( see equation ( [ eq : x2 ] ) ) contains the square root , @xmath139 , for which , @xmath1 is found only in @xmath140 as a quadratic .",
    "therefore it is easy to derive an expression for @xmath1 for which @xmath141 and thus determine where the minus and plus equations for @xmath138 meet or abut ( _ viz . _",
    "@xmath141 ) .",
    "this information is important for determining which form of equation ( [ eq : x2 ] ) to use .",
    "we will call the set of general orbits for which @xmath141 , the abutment , to avoid confusing it with the result for the boundary between the plus and minus forms of @xmath15 at the lso .",
    "a prograde orbit has an @xmath142 .",

    "when using the minus and plus forms of the equation for @xmath138 ( equation ( [ eq : x2 ] ) ) , one must recognise that @xmath145 governs all of the prograde orbits , the polar orbits , and the near - polar retrograde orbits up to the abutment ; and @xmath146 governs the remaining retrograde orbits .",
    "if one considers an sbh system then the abutment will be comprised only of polar orbits ( and it is only then that @xmath138 cleanly separates the prograde and retrograde orbits ) .",
    "if @xmath64 , the abutment will always consist of retrograde orbits .    for orbits governed by @xmath146 , @xmath147",
    "; but for those governed by @xmath145 , the choice of sign depends on the value of @xmath1 .",
    "the plot of @xmath145 with respect to @xmath1 for a circular orbit with @xmath148 about a kbh of @xmath59 ( figure [ fig : x2plot ] ) shows that for @xmath149 to remain continuous over the range of real values of @xmath1 , the minus sign must be chosen when evaluating @xmath150 for @xmath151 . an analytical formula for @xmath152",

    "this result confirms the choice of the minus sign in solving the quadratic equation ( [ eq : latusrectumgeneralabutment ] ) for @xmath186 .",
    "recall that equation ( [ eq : x2 ] ) applies to bound orbits in general and is not restricted to lsos ( as is the case for @xmath86 ( see equation ( [ eq : lzsquared ] ) ) ) ; therefore , the value of @xmath186 can be evaluated for all values of @xmath195 ; and it will apply to both sets of orbits governed by @xmath145 or @xmath146 .      we shall consider polar orbits in this paper ; although orbits of arbitrary inclination are also important . the polar orbit ( governed by @xmath145 ) is precisely defined by setting @xmath144 from which we obtain @xmath196 ; therefore , we can derive an analytical formula for @xmath1 of a polar orbit ( @xmath197 ) of arbitrary @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "we have the formula for @xmath145 in terms of @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath1 ( see equation ( [ eq : x2 ] ) ) ; and @xmath16 can also be expressed in these terms ( see equation ( [ eq : e4 ] ) ) . therefore @xmath198 can be simplified and factored to yield:@xmath199 where              the factor , @xmath205 , offers no physically meaningful results .",
    "it does not provide a solution for @xmath1 ; and for @xmath206 and @xmath207 , we find that @xmath208 , which lies beyond the lso .",
    "the factor , @xmath209 , yields the result@xmath210 and the factor , @xmath211 , yields the result@xmath212    we examine equations ( [ eq : q_polar_physical ] ) and ( [ eq : q_polar_unphysical ] ) to discover which one is physically significant . in the schwarzschild limit ( @xmath36 ) we find that they coincide .",
    "but let us consider the weak - field limit ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "equation ( [ eq : q_polar_physical ] ) , @xmath213 , can be expanded in powers of @xmath2 . and the terms with powers of @xmath214 and lower approach zero as @xmath9 to yield the asymptotic limit of equation ( [ eq : q_polar_physical ] ) : @xmath215 in a similar treatment of equation ( [ eq : q_polar_unphysical ] ) one obtains : @xmath216 which we can disregard as unphysical because it incorrectly implies that the spin of the kbh influences the trajectory of a test - particle at infinity .",
    "this situation differs from that described by equation ( [ eq : q_switch_large_l ] ) , which does not describe a trajectory .",
    "test calculations confirm that equation ( [ eq : q_polar_physical ] ) is the appropriate choice and equation ( [ eq : q_polar_unphysical ] ) can be disregarded since the values of @xmath167 obtained by solving equation ( [ eq : q_polar_unphysical ] ) are less than ( or equal to ) the results from equation ( [ eq : q_polar_physical ] ) ( _ ceteris paribus _ ) . equation ( [ eq : q_polar_physical ] ) applies to all bound orbits , hence @xmath197 can be evaluated over a range @xmath195 ; but it applies only to orbits governed by @xmath145 . in the sbh case ( @xmath37 ) , @xmath217 and @xmath218 .",
    "therefore            in figures ( [ fig : s=00003d0.99 ] ) and ( [ fig : the - three - important ] ) one observes that the functions for @xmath186 and @xmath184 intersect at a single tangential point , which represents the value of @xmath2 of an lso that lies at the abutment described by @xmath138 .",
    "the equation @xmath220 ( see equations ( [ eq : q_abutment ] ) and ( [ eq : q_lso ] ) ) can be solved to yield:@xmath221 where@xmath222 @xmath223 @xmath224 @xmath225 @xmath226 @xmath227 and@xmath228    it is at this tangential point that the @xmath184 curve is split into two segments : the minus segment ( @xmath229 ) that defines the values of @xmath167 ( and @xmath184 ) associated with inclined lsos that are governed by @xmath145 ; and the plus segment ( @xmath230 ) , which corresponds to inclined lsos governed by @xmath146 . consequently , the points beneath @xmath184 define only orbits governed by @xmath145 .",
    "further , orbits with @xmath2 and @xmath1 values that lie to the left of the minus segment of @xmath184 are undefined .",
    "therefore the @xmath184 curve for @xmath229 and the @xmath186 curve for @xmath230 define a curve along which the upper limit of @xmath1 is specified .",
