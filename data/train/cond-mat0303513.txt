    "that a large hund coupling as used here suppresses double occupancy of the same orbital , and in this respect behaves as a hubbard @xmath63 interaction .",
    "in addition , a robust coupling @xmath0 also acts as a @xmath64 repulsion between electrons in the same site but different orbitals . as a consequence ,",
    "it is a reasonable approximation to neglect the coulombic interactions in the problem , which simplifies enormously the computational effort .",
    "the model will be analyzed primarily using a classical monte carlo ( mc ) procedure for the localized spins and phonons , in conjunction with exact diagonalization of the conduction electron system .",

    "the simulations usually started with random states at high temperature , and then the temperature was decreased slowly , but at very low temperatures some of the simulations started with ordered states to speed up the convergence .",
    "the results of the simulations were analyzed using three separate but related quantities : the spin structure factor @xmath67 of the classical spins , the charge structure factor @xmath68 and the orbital structure factor defined as , @xmath69 with @xmath70 and @xmath71= @xmath72 -@xmath73 . frequently , visual investigations of snapshots of the spin and phononic configurations at low temperatures were useful to guide the intuition .",

    "the actual correlations for this phase will not be shown explicitly here since they have appeared in some previous investigations@xcite and our results agree very well with those results . however , there are issues to remark not discussed before .",
    "for example , note that the ce phase is present not only at large @xmath0 but also at small electron - phonon coupling .",
    "this last result suggests that a nonzero @xmath1 is sufficient to stabilize the zigzag chains characteristic of the ce region .",
    "et al._@xcite proposed that a band - insulator picture is needed to understand this phenomenon , and the present results support this view .",
    "it is the geometry of the zigzag chains that plays the key role in stabilizing the ce state .",
    "this result may have important consequences for experiments as discussed below .",
    "the dotted line represents a continuous transition between the standard ce phase and a novel canted ce phase . to understand the characteristics of the new ce state , note that the standard ce phase can also be interpreted as an arrangement of parallel af zig - zag chains , displaced one lattice parameter in the x- and y - directions simultaneously .",
    "when the relative spin angle between the neighboring af zig - zags is @xmath80 , we have the normal ce phase . in the ce regime",

    "this phase has not been observed yet experimentally , but there is no reason to believe that the state can not exist in some mn oxide . within the accuracy of our study ,",
    "this af phase is believed to have no long - range order in the orbital and charge degrees of freedom .",
    "this corresponds to a nearly uniform arrangement of charge at small @xmath0 .",
    "however , at large electron - phonon coupling the situation changes qualitatively . in this regime",
    ", a `` polaronic '' state seems to be stabilized , where the 8 electrons present in the 16-sites cluster studied here become trapped in random locations .",
    "if in this random distribution some of the electrons are close to one another , local orbital order similar to that of the @xmath4=0 limit was observed .",
    "again , this af phase has not been observed experimentally yet , but the recent progress in the discovery of new phases ( see next section ) suggests that this remains a serious possibility .",
    "the regime of small @xmath1 coupling is dominated by fm states .",
    "the large-@xmath0 zone has a novel state which is discussed in the next section . at intermediate and small couplings ,",
    "the state that dominates at low temperature has the characteristics of the fm metallic state well - known to exist in three - dimensional mn oxides .",
    "for instance , in the charge sector there is no order . regarding orbital order",
    ", the correlations suggest the presence of a uniform arrangement .",
    "this uniform orbital order at small @xmath0 is not produced through a spontaneous - symmetry - breaking process , but it exists as a direct consequence of the form of the kinetic energy in our two - dimensional simulations . to show this , the procedure is the following . consider the limit of hund coupling infinite as in our studies , and also @xmath0=@xmath1=0 . in this case",
    ", the hamiltonian can be diagonalized exactly in momentum space and the ground state for the 4@xmath654 cluster can be exactly constructed . in this state",
    ", the mean value of the number operator for the two orbitals of relevance can be calculated as well .",
    "the results are not equal for the two orbitals , but there is an asymmetry in favor of the @xmath85-@xmath86 orbital .",
    "then , in this respect the uniform orbital - order in the state is explicit in the model , and it is not induced by the jt phonons .",
    "these conclusion were also checked on larger lattices , such as 20@xmath6520 , and in three - dimensional clusters .",
    "it is interesting to remark that the phase diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig : figure1 ] contains not only the fm - metallic and ce - insulating phases  well - established experimentally  but other phases as well .",
    "for example , at large @xmath1 an af phase exists in a wide range , and this phase could be observed in future experimental investigations , as already discussed .",
    "even more exciting is the case of the ferromagnetic charge - ordered ( fm / co ) phase in the upper - left corner of fig .",

    "the disorder sensitivity of the ce - phase may arise from the _ fragility of the zigzag chains_. as argued before , the realistic regime of couplings , with @xmath0 of order 1 , presents a charge - ordering pattern which is far from the extreme limit 3+/4 + , rendering the staggered charge - ordering less robust than previously believed .",
    "in addition , the one - dimensional nature of the zigzag chains also contributes to this fragility .",
    "imperfections can easily destroy these nontrivial geometrical arrangement of chains .",
