    "chandrasekhar first obtained the maximum possible mass for a stable white dwarf ( wd ) to be @xmath2 @xcite , @xmath3 being the mass of sun . later",
    ", several magnetized wds have been discovered with surface fields @xmath4 g @xcite .",
    "it is likely that stronger fields ( @xmath5 g ) exist at their centers , which , however , can not be probed directly .",
    "high magnetic field strength modifies the equation of state of the degenerate matter by causing landau quantization of the electrons . in the present work",
    ", we study the effect of magnetic field strengths @xmath6 g on the electron degenerate matter and hence obtain the modified mass - radius relation of the strongly magnetized wd .",
    "interestingly , we find that it is possible to have a super - chandrasekhar wd having mass @xmath7 , provided it has an appropriate magnetic field strength and central density",
    ". incidentally , there have been recent observations of peculiar type  1a supernovae - sn2006gz , sn2007if , sn2009dc - which invoke super - chandrasekhar wds of mass up to @xmath8 as their progenitors @xcite .",
    "these observations remarkably concur with the super - chandrasekhar wds obtained in this work .",
    "the energy states of a free electron in a uniform magnetic field @xmath9 are quantized into landau orbitals , which defines the motion of the electron in a plane perpendicular to @xmath9 . the relevant equations ( see ref .",
    "4 ) are obtained by solving the dirac equation in a strong magnetic field , such that @xmath10 g. the maximum number of landau levels occupied by a gas of cold electrons in a magnetic field is given by @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the rest mass of the electron , @xmath13 the speed of light , @xmath14 the maximum fermi energy of the system and @xmath15 .",
    "thus a high @xmath16 corresponds to a low @xmath17 , i.e. , a smaller number of landau levels are occupied , which is when the magnetic field plays an important role in modifying the equation of state ( eos ) of the relativistic electron degenerate gas .",
    "next , in order to obtain the new mass - radius relation for a strongly magnetized wd , we combine the modified eos with the condition of magnetostatic equilibrium .",
    "if the wd is approximated to be spherical , then its mass @xmath18 is obtained from : @xmath19_r ~{\\rm and}~~ \\frac{dm}{dr } = 4\\pi r^{2}\\rho , \\label{mass}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is the radial distance from the center of the wd , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the pressure and density of the electron degenerate matter respectively and @xmath23 is newton s gravitation constant .",
    "however , if the magnetic field is very strong , then the pressure becomes anisotropic @xcite and also a magnetic tension develops in the combined fluid - magnetic medium @xcite , which flattens the wd along the direction of @xmath9 .",
    "we estimate the effect of deviation from spherical symmetry by assuming a cylindrical geometry , such that @xmath18 is now obtained from : @xmath24_{r_{eq } } { \\rm and}~~ \\frac{dm}{dr_{eq } } = 2\\pi r_{eq } h \\rho , \\label{meq}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is the equatorial distance from the center of the wd and @xmath26 denotes an average height of the cylinder , which also quantifies the degree of flattening @xcite ( note @xmath27 and @xmath28 differ according to the chosen co - ordinate systems ) . at high @xmath9",
    ", the wd will be more flattened and @xmath26 will be small , whereas at low @xmath9 it will be less flattened and hence @xmath26 will be large .",
    "note that in this work our interest is to see the effect of the magnetic field of the central region of the wd , where the field is supposedly ( almost ) constant .",
    "hence , the gradients of @xmath9 are negligible in eqs .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 2 ) .",
    "see ref . 5 for details .",
    "moreover , any currents generated near the surface , where @xmath9 varies , would not affect our main conclusion .",
    "# 1    ( # 1 )    figure 1(a ) shows the mass - radius relations for spherical wds corresponding to different magnetic field strengths , along with chandrasekhar s mass - radius relation .",
    "we observe that as @xmath9 decreases , or equivalently as @xmath29 increases , the mass - radius relations approach chandrasekhar s relation . also , as @xmath9 increases , the wds become more compact in size and have larger masses .",
    "we note that the most massive wd , corresponding to a 1-level system ( with @xmath30 g and @xmath31 ) , has @xmath32 2.3 @xmath33 .",
    "figure 1(b ) shows the mass - radius relation for the flattened wds corresponding to a 20-level system , along with the one for the corresponding spherical case .",
    "we observe that the flattened mass - radius relation exhibits a higher wd mass , with a maximum mass @xmath34 , compared to the spherical one , which has a maximum mass @xmath35 .",
    "thus , even for a much lower magnetic field strength ( with @xmath36 g for @xmath37 ) , wds having @xmath38 are obtained if one includes the appropriate flattening effect .",
    "note that the radius for the flattened case is the equatorial radius ( @xmath39 ) , which is automatically larger than the spherical radius ( @xmath40 ) as a consequence of the flattening effect .",
    "we find that the effect of landau quantization due to a strong magnetic field on the underlying electron degenerate matter gives rise to significantly super - chandrasekhar wds @xcite .",
    "the maximum mass obtained for magnetized wds is about @xmath41 , corresponding to a central magnetic field @xmath42 g. increasing the magnetic field leads to masses up to @xmath43 .",
    "however , the magnetic tension due to strong magnetic field causes a deformation in the wds which adopt a flattened shape .",
    "incorporating this flattening effect leads to more massive wds ( compared to the corresponding spherical ones ) even at relatively lower magnetic field strengths - such relatively weakly magnetized white dwarfs are more probable in nature .",
