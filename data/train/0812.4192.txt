    "in the presence of an external magnetic field @xmath0 the problem of two charged particles can not be solved in a closed form as the relative motion and the motion of the center of mass are coupled to each other .",
    "therefore no theory exists for a solution of this problem that is uniformly valid for any strength of the magnetic field and the coulomb force between the particles .",
    "the energy loss of ion beams and the related processes in a magnetized plasmas which are important in many areas of physics such as transport , heating , magnetic confinement of thermonuclear plasmas and astrophysics are examples of physical situations where this problem arises .",
    "recent applications are the cooling of heavy ion beams by electrons  der77,der78,sor83,pot90,mes94 and the energy transfer for heavy - ion inertial confinement fusion ( icf ) ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite for an overview ) .",
    "the classical limit of a hydrogen or rydberg atom in a strong magnetic field also falls in this category ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite and references therein ) but in contrast to the free - free transitions ( scattering ) the total energy is negative here .",
    "numerical calculations have been performed for binary collisions ( bc ) between magnetized electrons  @xcite and for collisions between magnetized electrons and ions @xcite . in general the total energy @xmath1 of the particles interacting in a magnetic field",
    "is conserved but the relative and center of mass energies are not conserved separately .",
    "in addition , the presence of the magnetic field breaks the rotational symmetry of the system and as a consequence only the component of the angular momentum @xmath2 parallel to the magnetic field @xmath3 is a constant of motion .",
    "so , the constants of motion @xmath4 and @xmath3 reduce the phase space of the relative motion .",
    "a different situation arises for the bc between an electron and uniformly moving heavy ion .",
    "as an ion is much heavier than an electron , its uniform motion is only weakly perturbed by collisions with the electrons and the magnetic field . in this case",
    "@xmath3 is not conserved but there exists a conserved generalized energy @xmath5 @xcite involving the energy of relative motion and a magnetic term .",
    "the apparently simple problem of charged particle interaction in a magnetic field is in fact a problem of considerable complexity and the additional degree of freedom of the cyclotron orbital motion produces a chaotic system with two degrees ( or one degree for heavy ions ) of freedom  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we consider the bc between two charged particles treating the interaction ( coulomb ) as a perturbation to their helical motions . for electron - heavy ion collisions",
    "this has been done previously in first order in the ion charge @xmath6 and for an ion at rest @xcite and in up to @xmath7 for uniformly moving heavy ion  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite three regimes are identified , depending on the relative size of the parameters @xmath8 ( the cyclotron radius ) , @xmath9 ( the distance of the closest approach ) , and @xmath10 ( the pitch of the helix ) . in earlier kinetic approaches",
    "@xcite only two regimes have been distinguished : fast collisions for @xmath11 , where the coulomb interaction is dominant and adiabatic collisions for @xmath12 , where the magnetic field is important , as the electron performs many gyrations during the collision with the ion .",
    "the change @xmath13 of the energy of the ion has been related to the square of the momentum transfer @xmath14 , which has been calculated up to @xmath15 .",
    "this is somewhat unsatisfactory , as there is another @xmath16 contribution to @xmath17 , in which the second - order momentum transfer enters linearly .",
    "moreover , for applications in plasma physics ( e.g. , for calculation of the ion energy loss in a magnetized plasma ) one calculates the angular averaged energy transfer which vanishes within first - order perturbation theory due to symmetry reasons and the ion energy change receives contribution only from higher orders  @xcite .",
    "indeed , the transport phenomena , etc . , are of order @xmath16 in the ion charge .    here",
    "we focus on bc between two magnetized identical particles ( e.g. electrons ) within the second order perturbation theory and its comparison with classical trajectory monte ",
    "carlo ( ctmc ) simulations .",
    "the present work considerably extends our earlier studies in refs .",
    "@xcite where the second - order energy transfer for an ion ",
    "electron collision was calculated with the help of an improved bc treatment which is valid for any strength of the magnetic field and does not require the specification of the interaction potential .",
    "in addition , we consider here the impact parameter - averaged energy transfer for the bc between magnetized electron and heavy ion moving uniformly along the magnetic field which has not been yet considered in refs .",
    "@xcite , and will give new analytical expressions which are more appropriate for an explicit calculation of the energy loss .",
    "physically these two distinct cases are similar except the time - dependent center of mass cyclotron motion in the case of two identical particles .",

    "[ sec : s1 ] starting from the exact equation of motion of two charged particles moving in a magnetic field we discuss some basic results of the exact bc treatment for the energy and velocity transfers as well as the energy conservation . in the following sec .",
    "[ sec : s2 ] , we discuss the velocity and energy transfer during bc of magnetized particles for arbitrary magnetic fields and strengths of the two - particle interaction potential",
    ". the equations of motion are solved in a perturbative manner up to the second order in interaction force starting from the unperturbed helical motion of the particles in a magnetic field . then in sec .",
    "[ sec : s3 ] we turn to the explicit calculation of the second order energy transfer for electron - electron collision but without any restriction on the magnetic field @xmath0 .",
    "the obtained energy transfer involves all cyclotron harmonics of the electron helical motion . for further applications ( e.g. , in cooling of ion beams , transport phenomena in magnetized plasmas ) we consider the regularized and screened interaction potential which is both of finite range and less singular than the coulomb interaction at the origin and as the limiting cases involves the debye ( i.e. , screened ) and coulomb potentials .",
