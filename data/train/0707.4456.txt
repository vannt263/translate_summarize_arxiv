    "2d euler equation of inviscid incompressible fluids is the key in understanding the chaotic ( turbulent ) solutions of 2d navier - stokes equation in the infinite reynolds number limit @xcite @xcite .",
    "moreover , it is the simplest fluid equation .",
    "there are two distinct phenotypes of chaos : sensitive dependence on initial data , and recurrence .",
    "sensitive dependence on initial data can often be proved by shadowing technique or smale horseshoe construction @xcite . to accomplish this , one often needs detailed information on the dynamics ( e.g. existence of a homoclinic orbit ) .",
    "this poses tremendous analytical challenge for 2d euler equation @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the well - known poincar recurrence theorem was proved primarily from the first - principle of measure theory under extremely general conditions of finite measure space and measure - preserving map .",
    "therefore , it seems to have a good chance of success even for 2d euler equation .",
    "the serious complication comes from the fact that natural finite dimensional measures ( e.g. gibbs measure ) do not have good counterparts in infinite dimensions .",
    "it is well - known that the kinetic energy and enstrophy are invariant under the 2d euler flow .",
    "but it is difficult to use them to define finite measures in infinite dimensions .",
    "it seems possible to study the poincar recurrence problem directly from banach norms rather than measures .",
    "nadirashvili gave a counter - example of poincar recurrence along this line @xcite .",
    "of course , the most exciting and challenging problem shall be the general description of poincar recurrence or non - recurrence for 2d euler equation directly from banach norms .",
    "this is our main research project . in this note",
    ", we will fix the problems in the nadirashvili s proof of poincar non - recurrence near a particular solution to the 2d euler equation .",
    "because nadirashvili s is the first and a beautiful counter - example in this content , we feel that such a note is worth - while .",
    "let ( @xmath0 ) be a finite measure space and @xmath1 be a measure - preserving transformation .",
    "for any @xmath2 ( @xmath3-algebra of subsets of @xmath4 ) , the measure @xmath5 that is , almost every point returns infinitely often .",
    "this proof is owned by koro .",
    "http://planetmath.org/?op=getobj&from=objects&id=6035    let @xmath6 then @xmath7 and @xmath8 thus @xmath9 and @xmath10 we have @xmath11 notice that @xmath12 the theorem is proved .",
    "the proof in @xcite is incorrect .",
    "the geometric intuition of the poincar recurrence theorem is that in a finite measure space ( or invariant subset ) , the images of a positive measure set under a measure - preserving map will have no room left but intersect the original set repeatedly .",
    "the measure of the space @xmath4 being finite is crucial .",
    "for example , consider the two - dimensional hamiltonian system of the pendulum @xmath13 its phase plane diagram is shown in figure [ ppd ] .",
    "if the invariant region includes orbits outside the cat s eyes , then the measure of the region will not be finite , and the poincar recurrence theorem will not hold .",
    "one can see clearly that the orbits outside the cat s eyes will drift to infinity .",
    "the boundaries of the cat s eyes are called separatrices ( heteroclinic orbits ) . for 2d euler equation of inviscid incompressible fluids",
    ", it has been conjectured that unstable fixed points are connected by heteroclinic orbits @xcite .",
    "so the poincar recurrence shall not be sought in the whole phase space .",
    "in the case of 2d euler equation of inviscid incompressible fluids , nadirashvili was the first one who gave an example showing that the poincar recurrence does not occur .",
    "unlike in finite dimensions , here there is no proper measure . therefore , there is no invariant region with a properly defined finite measure .",
    "thus the condition of the poincar recurrence theorem does not hold .",
    "even in finite dimensions , the finite measure condition is crucial as shown in example [ pex ] .    in the original article @xcite of nadirashvili ,",
    "the setup was incorrect , where a @xmath14 velocity space was taken as the phase space .",
    "the reason is that one needs at least @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) initial data in velocity to get @xmath14 ( in space ) velocity solution of the 2d euler equation @xcite @xcite . in general",
    ", @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) initial data can lead to @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) solutions @xcite .",
    "so @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) is not a good space for a dynamical system study either . on the other hand",
    ", nadirashvili s is a beautiful example ; therefore , it should be set right . in this note , we will select an appropriate phase space .          consider the 2d euler equation in its vorticity form @xmath24",
    "let @xmath25 be the space @xmath26 then for any @xmath27 , there is a unique solution to the 2d euler equation ( [ euler ] ) @xmath28 for all @xmath29 , with the initial data @xmath30 .",
    "in fact , @xmath31 is a classical solution in the sense that ( [ euler ] ) is satisfied for all @xmath32 and @xmath33 ( @xcite , pp.73 ) . in terms of the new phase space",
    ", the nadirashvili s theorem @xcite can be restated as follows :    there exists a @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 such that for any initial condition @xmath37 satisfying @xmath38 , the corresponding solution @xmath31 of the 2d euler equation satisfies @xmath39 for all @xmath40 .          by the biot - savart formula for multi - connected domain ( @xcite , pp.16 ) , we have @xmath48 where @xmath49 it is easy to estimate @xmath50 : @xmath51 estimating @xmath52 is more complicated .",
    "we know that @xmath53 is given by the single layer potential ( @xcite , pp.171 ) @xmath54 where the moment @xmath55 is given by ( @xcite , pp.174 ) @xmath56 using an approximation ( e.g. as in @xcite , pp.95 ) , one can show that @xmath57 thus @xmath58 which is an if and only if condition for the existence of a solution to ( [ moe ] ) in @xmath59 , and @xmath60 in fact @xmath61 ( @xcite , pp.160 ( 3.14 ) ) .",
    "notice that ( @xcite , pp.163 ) @xmath62 and @xmath63 thus @xmath64 is bounded on @xmath65 .",
    "we have from ( [ moe ] ) that @xmath66 this is the estimate we need . from ( [ slp ] )",
    ", @xmath67 thus @xmath68 the proof is complete .",
    "[ proof of the theorem ] let @xmath69 then @xmath70 let @xmath71 choose @xmath72 such that @xmath73 for any initial condition @xmath37 such that @xmath38 , let @xmath31 be the corresponding solution of the 2d euler equation ( [ euler ] ) with @xmath74 .",
    "let @xmath75 be the corresponding velocity given by lemma [ vvl ] .",
    "when @xmath76 is small enough , @xmath77 for all @xmath29 .",
    "let @xmath78 .",
    "then ( @xmath79 ) solves the 2d euler equation ( [ euler ] ) with @xmath80 , @xmath74 .",
    "@xmath81 defines for each @xmath82 an area - preserving diffeomorphism @xmath83 of the annulus @xmath19 ( @xcite , theorem 3.1 , pp.72 ) .",
    "the boundaries @xmath21 and @xmath22 are mapped into themselves by @xmath83 .",
    "we have @xmath84 thus the corresponding angular velocities are greater than @xmath85 on @xmath21 and smaller than @xmath86 on @xmath22 .",
    "the image @xmath87 of the segment @xmath88 under the diffeomorphism @xmath83 will wrap around in the annulus with angular coordinates of the two ends diverging faster than @xmath89 .",
    "so @xmath90 will wrap around the inner circle with more and more loops .",
    "thus when @xmath91 , @xmath90 will always intersect @xmath92 . notice that the value of @xmath31 is carried over by @xmath90 and @xmath93 on @xmath90 .",
    "hence , for @xmath91 , we have @xmath94 .        in terms of lagrangian",
    "coordinates , unlike the nadirashvili s example ; shnirelman proved a theorem on the wandering nature of the configuration map induced by the 2d inviscid incompressible fluid motion in @xmath97 .",
    "the form of the fluid ( particle trajectory ) equation considered by shnirelman is @xmath98 defined on @xmath97 , where @xmath99 is the configuration map induced by the fluid motion in @xmath97 , and @xmath100 is the vorticity .",
    "let @xmath101 and @xmath102 ( @xmath103 ) be its fourier transform .",
