    "there is another aspect of such processes which merits particular study .",
    "soft rescattering effectively leads to the _ absorption _ of leading neutrons with feynman @xmath7 ( which we denote @xmath8 ) close to 1 ; the role of this correction was originally studied in refs .",
    "@xcite . at that time , these were essentially theoretical studies , which provided predictions for future measurements .",
    "now detailed leading neutron data have become available from the experiments at hera .",

    "the hera data offer the opportunity of seeing how absorption changes as a function of all these kinematic observables .",
    "we also show the importance of _ migration _ , or change of the kinematic variables , of the leading neutron due to rescattering effects .",
    "the ways to estimate the effects of absorption and of migration are discussed in sections 3 and 4 respectively .",
    "the description of the hera data , @xmath14 , is presented in section 5 .",
    "for completeness , in section 6 , we discuss the behaviour of leading baryons produced in hadron - hadron collisions , in particular in the processes @xmath15 and @xmath16 .    in _ exclusive _ reactions ,",
    "the rescattering could produce new secondaries which has the effect of suppressing the rate .",
    "that is , an exclusive cross section is suppressed by absorptive effects . on the other hand , for an _ inclusive _ process the rescattering , will just change the energy and transverse momentum of the leading baryon , and will depopulate the region of large @xmath8 and small @xmath10 . from the viewpoint of an experimental trigger , for @xmath17",
    "this appears as absorption , but it is better to consider it as a _ migration _ into an enlarged phase space . in particular , such a migration can affect the form of the effective ( that is measured ) @xmath5 trajectory , leading to a larger mean @xmath10 at lower @xmath8 .",
    "of course , this may also modify the measurement of the pion structure function , @xmath6 , which is extracted from the hera data .",

    "moreover , both the old hadron - hadron interaction data and the recent hera results on the spectra of neutrons @xcite clearly indicate the reggeization of pion exchange .",
    "in fact , detailed studies of hadronic interactions in the reggeized pion - exchange model @xcite have shown that the formula can be used in a broad range of @xmath8 , with @xmath26 .",
    "the contribution of reggeized pion exchange to the inclusive production of baryons , @xmath27 with @xmath28 , is of the form  =  f^2(t )  ^tot_a(m^2 )  ( 1-x_l)^1 - 2_(t ) , [ eq : pi ] where @xmath29 is the pion trajectory with slope @xmath30 , and @xmath31 @xcite .",

    "the born - type regge pole exchange diagram of fig .  [ fig:1 ] represents only the first approximation to the description of the leading neutron spectra at high energies .",
    "multi - pomeron exchanges introduce modifications of the amplitudes , and lead to the restoration of unitarity @xcite .     or @xmath15 .",
    "the two types of multi - pomeron absorptive corrections are indicated symbolically by the shaded areas ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "the corresponding corrections to the cross section are shown in fig .",

    "[ fig:3],height=188 ]    we use the space - time diagram of fig .",

    "the other possibility is the rescattering of the leading hadron on one of the intermediate partons in the central rapidity region , indicated by exchange ( b ) .    .",
    "the extra lines denoted by p , which surround the triple - regge interaction , represent multi - pomeron exchanges between the leading hadrons .",

    "the mass @xmath32 of the produced system @xmath33 is assumed to be sufficiently large for both the rapidity intervals @xmath57 and @xmath58 to accommodate pomeron exchange .",
    "the extra lines denoted by p , which are coupled directly to the ingoing @xmath22 or outgoing @xmath43 , represent multi - pomeron exchanges .",
    "[ fig:5],height=188 ]    in terms of feynman diagrams , an additional pomeron exchange leads to a negative contribution ; that is absorptive corrections diminish the size of the predicted cross section . from the physical point of view",
    ", the inelastic interaction , shown by either exchange ( a ) or exchange ( b ) in fig .  [ fig:3 ] , produces new secondary particles which populate the rapidity gaps and carry away energy from the leading neutron . in other words a leading neutron , with a large energy fraction @xmath8 , can only be observed in the small fraction of events which have no secondary inelastic interactions .",
    "the rescattering corrections therefore reduce the probability that the leading neutrons will be found in the large @xmath8 bins .",
    "technically the absorptive corrections are calculated in the following way .",
    "the most familiar are the eikonal - type corrections which are shown symbolically in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] , where only elastic rescatterings are taken into account .",
    "the corrections are well known : d  =  ( -(s,_t ) )  d_0(s,_t ... ) , [ eq : eik ] where @xmath59 is the impact parameter , and @xmath60 is the contribution to the cross section for leading neutron production from the lowest order diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig:1](b ) .",
    "the opacity @xmath61 is the impact representation of the single - pomeron contribution to elastic scattering , which can be determined from studies of the total and elastic processes ; for a recent review see , for example , ref .",
    "the formalism can easily be extended to take into account diffractive excitations of the initial and final hadrons .",

    "diagrams of this eikonal type have been considered in previous estimates of absorptive corrections to the spectra of leading baryons @xcite .",
    "note that since @xmath62 increases with energy , the suppression of the born cross section @xmath60 also increases with energy .",
    "the damping factor , exp@xmath63 , is strongest for small values of the impact parameter @xmath59 . thus the absorptive suppression is greater for the @xmath64 reggeons than for @xmath5-exchange , which , due to the @xmath65 behaviour at small @xmath66 , has a broader distribution in @xmath59 .",
    "the unitarity corrections have an interesting effect on the @xmath66-dependence of the cross section driven by pion - exchange , .",
    "as the pion pole is approached , that is as @xmath67 , the corresponding impact parameter becomes very large , @xmath68 , and the gap survival damping factor s^2(_t ) ( - ) 1 .",
    "thus we anticipate a more complicated @xmath66 dependence than that given by eqs . and .",
    "first , at very small @xmath69 , the survival factor @xmath70 rapidly decreases from @xmath71 at @xmath72 , finally reaching a value @xmath73 at large @xmath74 . however before then , the additional @xmath66-dependence coming from the pion vertex and trajectory reveals itself , namely @xmath75 exp@xmath76 with @xmath77 .",
    "so , in , we have f(t)=f_v(t)s(t ) .",
    "[ eq : fs ] thus fitting the data using the single exponential form may confuse the situation .",
    "note that in the discussion below we will use the average value of @xmath70 ^2  =  ( -(_t ) ) .",
    "another class of multi - pomeron diagrams corresponds to the modification of the upper reggeon in the triple - pomeron diagram ( fig .",

    "[ fig:5 ] are only expected to become relevant at sufficiently high energies .",

    "[ fig:66 ] .",
    "indeed the diagram is related to the triple - pomeron diagram for the elastic amplitude by the agk cutting rules @xcite .",
    "the corresponding coefficient is 4 .",
    "so it is straightforward to obtain the correction to the @xmath20 cross section from diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig:5]a , provided we know the cross section of fig .  [ fig:66 ] in the triple - pomeron region , @xmath17 . by fitting this cross section to the triple - pomeron formula we can extract the strength of the vertex @xmath92 @xcite .",
    "if we take the value of the _ effective _ vertex @xmath92 determined in the analysis of the old hadron data , then we find the correction due to the enhanced absorptive diagrams to be about 15@xmath44 .",
    "-channel discontinuity of the triple - pomeron diagram for the elastic @xmath91 scattering amplitude , [ fig:66],height=188 ]",
    "so there is a relatively small contribution coming from the enhanced graphs of fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] , that is from the rescattering of intermediate partons , as indicated by the shaded region ( b ) of fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that within the hera range ( @xmath93 gev ) no energy dependence is observed in the leading neutron yields ; see , for example , figs .",
    "6 of @xcite , and tables 14 , 18 and figs .",
    "11 , 12 of @xcite which show , for fixed @xmath11 , the same probability , to observe the rapidity gap associated with pion - exchange . ] to observe a leading neutron for values of @xmath94 which decrease by more than an order of magnitude corresponding to an increase of the photon laboratory energy by more than a factor of 10 .",
    "this flat experimental behaviour of the probability indicates that actually the absorptive corrections caused by the rescattering of intermediate partons are much smaller than might be expected from leading - order perturbative qcd calculations , similar to those presented in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also the discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "in order to compute the spectra of leading neutrons , we must consider the effects of _ migration _ , as well as of absorption .",
    "we assume that each rescattering spreads out the @xmath95 spectra of the leading baryon according to distribution space , there may be charge - exchange ( that is neutron to proton transitions ) .",
    "we neglect this effect since the goal of the present section is not a precise quantitative description , but rather a qualitative evaluation of the role and possible size of the ` migration ' phenomena . for the same reason we use a simplified form , ( [ m1 ] ) , of the leading baryon distribution . ]",

    "thus , after two rescatterings @xmath99 [ m1a ] =   exp(-p^2_tb_m/2 )  . correspondingly , after @xmath100 rescatterings the distribution becomes [ m2 ]  =   exp(-p^2_tb_m / k )   .",

    "here we focus attention on migration effects in @xmath14 , so @xmath103 .",
    "the cross section @xmath104 is , however , not the @xmath105 total cross section , since the process proceeds in two stages .",
    "first the photon fluctuates into a @xmath25 pair , which may be considered as a sum of vector mesons , and then the vector mesons rescatter on a nucleon . we therefore assume @xmath104 is the @xmath106 total cross section having in mind the additive quark model and/or @xmath107 meson dominance .",
    "@xmath108 is the slope of the rescattering _ amplitude _ ( which we take to be @xmath109 gev@xmath97 ) .",

    "however , due to the rather large values of @xmath110 , we may expect that the absorptive and migration effects will not be too strong  since the transverse distance between the leading baryon and the incoming photon ( or @xmath112-pair ) , _ t _",

    "[ fig:4 ] .    to account for the fact that @xmath59 and @xmath110 are not the same , for each value of @xmath110",

    "we find @xmath123 only after integration over the neutron transverse momentun @xmath10 .",
    "however to simplify the computations , here we use the semiclassical approximation , which assumes @xmath124 , using the fourier transform just for the cross section .",
    "this approach , which is usually used in monte carlo simulations , may be justified by the fact that the effect of migration becomes important only at relatively large @xmath10 , see fig .",

    "so after we integrate up to @xmath125 gev we find that the equality @xmath123 holds to rather good accuracy .",

    "thus , to calculate the inclusive cross section for leading neutron production we have to integrate over the impact parameter @xmath59  =  d^2_t  d^2_n   w(_t,_n ) f(_t,_n , x_l )  , [ mf1 ] where [ mf2 ] f(_t,_n , x_l )  =  ( _ t ) e^-(_t )  .",

    "now , it is crucial to note that the @xmath158-pomeron vertex depends strongly on the value of @xmath159 , leading to an effective factor @xmath160 at @xmath161 . in the physical region of negative @xmath66",
    "this factor is expected to be @xmath162 in the cern isr energy range @xcite . indeed , the indications for such absorptive corrections to @xmath5-exchange were observed in data for @xmath163 production @xcite .",
    "spectra of leading baryons in the reggeized pion - exchange model have been described in papers @xcite . in papers",
    "@xcite a phenomenological form - factor , which to some extent mimic absorptive effects , has been used .",
    "the situation with inclusive nucleon - charge exchange in @xmath164 ( and @xmath165 ) collisions , that is in the spectra of neutrons in @xmath164-collisions and protons in @xmath166-collisions , is not clear .",
    "the largest set of the highest energy data was obtained at the cern isr , refs.@xcite and @xcite .",
    "these isr spectra of neutrons have a rather different form .",
    "it was emphasized in ref .",
    "@xcite that the data of @xcite are strongly different from predictions of the pion - exchange model , and lead to a violation of the energy - momentum sum rule , while the data of @xcite are in a reasonable agreement with theoretical predictions @xcite . as mentioned above , the models of refs .",
    "@xcite are based on reggeized pion - exchange , with the gap survival factor @xmath167 represented by a form factor which , however , gave only a rather small effect ( @xmath168 ) . the equivalent process @xmath169 was also measured @xcite over range of energies , which partly overlap with isr energy range and are consistent with the model of ref .  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand there are data on the process @xmath169 at relatively low energies ( 11.6 gev ) , which are lower than predictions of the pion - exchange model without the @xmath167 factor .",
    "thus the final picture for hadron - hadron processes is not clear .",
    "some experiments are in agreement with the theoretical expectations of appreciable absorptive corrections to @xmath5-exchange , while others appear to be described by simplified @xmath5-exchange .",
    "we have described all the main features of the leading neutrons observed at hera , both in photoproduction and as a function of @xmath11 .",
    "for photoproduction we may refer to fig .",
    "[ fig : r1 ] .",
    "we see that reggeized pion - exchange on its own is insufficient to describe the production of leading neutrons .",
    "however the inclusion of _ absorptive _ corrections are found to reduce the @xmath5-exchange prediction by a factor of just less than 0.5 , and to bring the theoretical expectation in line with the data .",
    "thus , after accounting for the rapidity gap survival factor @xmath167 , such data can be used to measure the @xmath49 cross section and the pion structure function .",
    "moreover the value of the gap survival factor @xmath167 may be monitored by comparing the spectra of leading neutrons in dijet production at low @xmath170 with those for @xmath171 , where the cross section is dominated by the direct , point - like photon .",
    "next , the dependence of the survival factor @xmath167 ( which specifies the probability to observe a leading neutron ) on the photon energy may be used to experimentally probe the contribution of the enhanced absorptive corrections of fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] .",
    "the data appear to be flat in energy indicating only a small contribution from enhanced diagrams .",
    "this is relevant to the proposed higgs searches in exclusive diffractive production at the lhc .",
    "thus we conclude that the additional suppression of the exclusive higgs cross section caused by the enhanced diagrams can not be as large as mentioned in ref .",
    "@xcite , see @xcite for a detailed discussion .",
    "we also found that the neutron spectrum shows some evidence of _ migration _ effects , see fig .",
    "[ fig : r1 ] . including migration",
    "slightly reduces the value extracted for the slope of the pion regge trajectory ; the reduction is about @xmath172 depending on the interval of @xmath8 used to measure @xmath173 .",
    "finally , in section 6 , we briefly reviewed the available experimental data for leading baryons produced in hadron - hadron interactions , which were obtained about 30 years ago . here",
    "the experimental situation is confusing .",
    "some experiments are in line with theoretical expectations , while others are not .",
