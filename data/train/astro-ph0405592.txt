    "the spitzer wide - area infrared extragalactic legacy survey , swire @xcite , has recently begun observations .",
    "the survey was designed to dramatically enhance our understanding of galaxy evolution .",
    "we will study the history of star - formation , the assembly of stellar mass , the nature and impact of accretion processes in active nuclei , and the influence of environment on these processes at all scales .",
    "the survey will detect around two million galaxies at infrared wavelengths ranging from 3.6  to 160  , over 50  square degrees .",
    "the analysis of the clustering of galaxies has been an important tool in cosmology for many years ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "originally galaxies were assumed to trace the mass density field ( modulo some `` bias '' factor ) and their clustering was used to constrain cosmological models .",
    "for example , the angular correlation function of the apm galaxy survey was able to rule out the once standard cold dark matter model @xcite .",
    "today the cosmological models are usually constrained by observations of the cosmic microwave background ( e.g. @xcite ) and conventional models of the evolution of structure under gravity can then provide us with estimates of the statistical properties of the mass density field .",
    "hence studies of galaxy clustering can now be used to understand the relationship between galaxy formation and the mass field , i.e.  the galaxy bias ( e.g. @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    "we take the first step towards an understanding of the clustering of the swire sources , by measuring the angular correlation function of those galaxies that are detected at 3.6  ( @xmath10 band ) with the infrared array camera ( irac ) . for galaxies at @xmath11",
    "the 3.6  band probes the rest - frame @xmath6-band and so their clustering can be compared directly with that from local @xmath6-band surveys such as the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . at this wavelength ,",
    "the emission is dominated by older stellar populations so these galaxies are tracing the sites of star - formation in the distant past and we are probing the bias at even earlier epochs .",
    "the catalogs that we are using are all the ones that were available in march 2004 , i.e.  our validation `` tile '' in the lockman hole region ( 0.4  deg@xmath12 ) and two tiles in the elais n1 region ( each 0.8  deg@xmath12 ) .",
    "the data are available from the spitzer science archive as programs progid=142 and progid=185 respectively .",
    "the data processing will be described in detail in a future paper @xcite .",
    "the 5@xmath13 limit of the 3.6 @xmath0 m catalogs is @xmath14  @xmath0jy @xcite ; in the analysis that follows we consider only those galaxies that have @xmath15  @xmath0jy , a flux - limited sample with typically very high signal - to - noise ratio ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "contaminating stars will reduce the galaxy clustering signal , and so we have investigated two procedures for separating stars and galaxies .",
    "the first method uses our supporting optical data in the central 0.3  square degrees of the lockman tile .",
    "we select objects with optical counterparts and detections in at least four bands ( u , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , 3.6  , 4.5  ) . from these , we reject objects that are morphologically classified as stellar and are brighter than @xmath20  mag ( below this limit , the star / galaxy separation becomes unreliable ) .",
    "we also reject those objects which have good optical / infrared data , but for which no galaxy or agn template spectrum provides a good fit @xcite .",
    "this method provided us with 872 stars and 2115 galaxies , with 727 irac sources rejected .",
    "the stellar number count models of @xcite predict 620 sources , therefore we expect the stellar contamination in our catalog to be small .    in the second method we use the irac color from 3.6 to 4.5  : @xmath21 .",
    "we model this color above @xmath22  @xmath0jy as a gaussian ( assuming these to be stars , but fitting only to the positive half of the distribution to avoid residual contamination from galaxies ) .",
    "we find a mean @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "we then apply a three - sigma cut and reject stars with @xmath25 . with this color criterion and the 3.6  flux limit ,",
    "the 4.5  completeness limit of @xmath26  @xmath0jy has no impact on the identification of the stars .",
    "in addition , we exclude all objects associated with stars from the 2mass catalog @xcite .",
    "the number of star rejected is shown in table  [ tab : wtheta ] .",
    "the stellar count model @xcite predicts 2074 stars per square degree , thus this method also excludes around 2000 galaxies per square degree with stellar colors .",
    "these are a minor fraction of our sample ( @xmath27 per cent ) and this will not bias our results , so long as the excluded galaxies do not cluster differently to the remaining sample . since we include galaxies with both redder and bluer colors , this seems a reasonable assumption .",
    "we compared the two different methods of star / galaxy separation in the 0.3  square degrees of the lockman field where both methods could be applied . in this region ,",
    "the optical selection yielded 872 stars and the infrared selection method yielded 1100 stars .",
    "of these , 450 sources are common to both lists , making them the most reliable stellar identifications . however , these common sources are not a complete list of the stars  the stellar count model @xcite predicts 620 sources in this field , leaving around 170 stars ( 27 per cent ) that were not selected by both methods concurrently .",
    "further , if we consider the 2mass point source catalog to be a second reliable list of stellar identifications , then we find that 96 of these 2mass stars ( 23  per cent ) were not identified as such using the optical selection method .",
    "combining these statistics gives an estimate of the stellar contamination in the galaxy catalogs of @xmath288  per cent for the lockman optical / irac catalog , and @xmath29  per cent for the three irac - only catalogs .",
    "we have adopted a simple but conservative selection function .",
    "our high flux limit ( @xmath30  @xmath0jy , typically signal - to - noise @xmath16 ) means that even in regions of higher than average noise ( low coverage ) we will still have reasonable signal - to - noise and be well above the completeness level , thus our selection function is uniform .",
    "a bright star can cause artifacts that will affect our source detection , however , so we excluded regions around bright 2mass stars , and also regions near the boundaries of the survey fields .",
    "we calculated the angular correlation function @xmath1 following the same techniques as @xcite , using the @xcite estimator .",
    "we applied corrections for the finite survey area ( the integral constraint ) and the stellar contamination , following the method of , for example , @xcite .",
    "we calculated @xmath31 for each of our three independent fields : lockman , elais n1 tile 2_2 and elais n1 tile 3_2 .",
    "we have made a seperate measurement in the center of the lockman field with deep optical coverage , using a different star / galaxy classification as described in section [ sec : stargal ] .",
    "each of these correlation functions are plotted in figure  [ fig : wtheta ] and tabulated in table  [ tab : wtheta ] .",
    "we note that , as with any angular correlation analysis , the data points are not independent .",
    "we fit the model to the data over @xmath32  deg ( 11 )  on smaller scales the correlation function clearly departs from a power law , indicating an excess of close pairs relative to the clustering on larger scales .",
    "this excess is most - likely due to interacting / merging galaxies @xcite , but our large source detection aperture ( 6 ) limits our ability to investigate this so we will explore this in more detail in a future paper .",
    "the strength of clustering in the lockman optical field appears to higher than the other fields ; this might be because the additional optical selection criteria reduce the effective depth of the field and shallower surveys will always have stronger angular clustering .",
    "the best - fitting parameters to the three combined samples ( excluding the lockman optical dataset ) are : @xmath4 for a fixed @xmath3 ; and @xmath33 with @xmath34 for a free fit .",
    "the sources detected in the 3.6  band will be similar in nature to sources detected in a @xmath6-band survey , as both sample the old stellar populations . in the absence of @xmath6-band data in our fields , we used simulated catalogs from @xcite to estimate the effective @xmath6-band limit in three different ways , giving answers ranging from @xmath35  mag to @xmath36  mag .",
    "although this model over - predicts the 3.6  number counts @xcite we only need the colours and not the overall normalisation to be correct .",
    "firstly we determined the median @xmath37 color of galaxies with @xmath38  @xmath0jy to be 1.1 ; our limiting flux thus translates to @xmath39  mag .",
    "secondly we examined the @xmath6-band counts of a @xmath38  @xmath0jy simulated catalog and estimated a completeness limit of @xmath35  mag ( n.b .",
    "the overall normalisation of the count model does not affect this result ) .",
    "the parameter of interest is not really the @xmath6 magnitude but redshift ; so for our third method we constructed @xmath6 magnitude limited samples with varied limits and found that a magnitude limit of @xmath36 gives the same median redshift as we predict for our sample ( @xmath40 , see section [ sec : nz ] below ) .",
    "thus we define our effective @xmath6-band limit to be @xmath41  mag , recognizing that there is some uncertainty in this value by up to @xmath42  mag .    in figure",
    "[ fig : comp ] we compare our amplitude with that from various @xmath6-band surveys .",
    "our errors are much smaller than existing measurements in these range but there is a very good agreement , the main issue is the uncertainty in how to compare the @xmath6- and @xmath10-band limits .",
    "@xcite have modeled the clustering of @xmath6-band sources with the auto - correlation function evolving as @xmath43 setting the local @xmath44  mpc @xcite and using their own model for the redshift distribution , they estimate the angular correlation function as shown in figure  [ fig : comp ] .",
    "we find good agreement with their stable clustering , @xmath45 , model .",
    "interestingly their model appears to over - predict the strength of the 2mass clustering @xcite , though these data have been plotted with the slightly shallower best - fit slopes @xmath46 .",
    "we can use our two - dimensional clustering measurement to infer the three - dimensional clustering statistics . to do this",
    "we need to know the shape of the redshift distribution @xmath47 . in the absence of spectroscopic redshifts or photometric redshifts for all our sources we use the model of @xcite to estimate the redshift distribution .    we know that this model over predicts the 3.6  number counts @xcite , so it is important to demonstrate that this model can nevertheless predict the shape of the redshift distribution . in figure",
    "[ fig : nz ] we compare the model with the observed redshift distribution from the k20 sample @xcite .",
    "the shape is a reasonable fit .",
    "the median redshift of the k20 sample is @xmath48 ; for our model starbursts and spirals we find @xmath49 , while for the spheroids @xmath50 , and the model as a whole has @xmath51 .",
    "the median redshift of the k20 sample is biased by a sharp peak at @xmath52 , which is presumably an artifact of clustering .",
    "so although the k20 sample has a slightly lower median @xmath53 than our model , we regard the approximate agreement between the redshift distributions in figure  [ fig : nz ] as reasonable confirmation of the model .    using this model",
    "we estimate that our @xmath38  @xmath0jy sample has a median redshift of @xmath54 .",
    "if the median redshift is lower than this , say by a factor of 0.8 as in the k20 comparison above then the median redshift might be @xmath55 .    using the limber s equation @xcite inversion technique adopted by @xcite , which uses a redshift distribution parameterized by the median redshift , we estimate the real - space correlation function @xmath56 for our combined sample and find @xmath57  mpc .",
    "the results for individual fields are shown in table  [ tab : wtheta ] . adopting the lower redshift , @xmath58",
    ", this drops to @xmath59  mpc . for comparison",
    "the correlation function of quasars in the range @xmath60 has @xmath61  mpc , with @xmath62 @xcite and hyper - luminous infrared galaxies also have a clustering strength similar to agn at @xmath63 @xcite .",
    "the uncertainty in our correlation function is clearly dominated by our uncertainties in the redshift distribution and emphasizes the need to establish the redshift distribution of the swire galaxies .",
    "we have performed the first clustering analysis on the swire survey .",
    "we have a very strong detection of clustering with amplitude similar to @xmath6-band surveys but with smaller errors .",
    "we are thus consistent with an existing phenomenological model of @xmath6-band selected galaxies @xmath64 .",
    "physically this model could be interpreted as stable clustering , i.e.  that galaxies have broken free from the hubble expansion , though this seems implausible on large scales . however , since @xmath6-band surveys sample different galaxies at different redshifts the interpretation of the phenomenological model is not this straightforward . now that we have high quality data in the rest - frame @xmath6 at high redshift we need phenomenological models specifically designed to interpret these .",
    "when we have a larger survey area available , and detailed selection functions , we will be able to extend the analysis to our completeness limit , which is fainter by a factor of nearly 10 in flux ( or 2.5 magnitudes ) .",
    "we will then be able to subdivide our sample by flux and explore the evolution of clustering in much more detail .",
    "we will investigate the excess clustering seen on smaller angular scales , and we will also explore the clustering in the longer wavelength irac bands and the relative clustering of star - forming galaxies and passively evolving systems , thus gaining insights into the nature of galaxy bias .",
