    "kaluza - klein type models involving compactified extra dimensions produce effective 4d theories containing moduli fields ( radions ) that are associated with scale factors of the compact dimensions .",
    "particle masses typically exhibit a radion dependence , and local matter sources contribute to an effective potential for these scalar fields . if the compactification is _ inhomogeneous _ , particle masses and charges can have spatial and temporal variations .",
    "soliton - like structures associated with these scalars may result ( see , for example , @xcite ) , with possibly observable consequences .",
    "an extreme condition is considered here , where the matter density from an evaporating microscopic black hole ( mbh ) may become large enough to give rise to an inhomogeneous compactification , resulting in a radionic cloud around the black hole .",
    "the reflective properties of this cloud endow the near horizon region with a radion induced albedo .",
    "scenarios of this type involving a radion coupled to the radiative field around an evaporating black hole have been studied previously in refs . @xcite and @xcite . in @xcite",
    "rather general conditions were considered , and in @xcite attention was focused on finite temperature , one - loop quantum corrections due to a partially thermalized medium surrounding an evaporating black hole .",
    "the resulting effective potential is quite complicated , and difficult to represent in a simple closed form . here , however , i take a more classical approach and consider a simple , but explicit , class of potentials @xmath0 for the radion field @xmath1 .",
    "this type of radion potential was studied first by davidson and guendelman in @xcite in the context of a freund - rubin compactification , and later by carroll , geddes , hoffman , and wald ( cghw ) in @xcite , using an extra dimensional two - form magnetic field .",
    "both treatments result in the same radion potential for the case of two extra dimensions , but the former treatment also holds for an arbitrary number @xmath2 of extra dimensions . in either case , the resulting potential has a rather simple form for an assumed set of parameter relations . for simplicity and concreteness ,",
    "i specialize to the case of two extra dimensions , and refer to the radion potential @xmath0 as the dg - cghw radion potential , although its generalization for arbitrary @xmath3 given by @xcite , is also given below .",
    "in addition to functional simplicity , the potential allows the extra dimensions to be stabilized classically , without explicit quantum corrections .    using this simple dg - cghw model ,",
    "the full effective radion potential @xmath4 can be developed which includes a matter - sourced correction due to the hawking radiation matter field .",
    "the matter source contribution to the radion effective potential @xmath4 depends , in a simple way , upon the local matter density @xmath5 and radion mass @xmath6 .",
    "a knowledge of these parameters then allows , in principle , a determination of the spatial and temporal variation of the radion field in the vicinity of the evaporating hole . the matter contribution can induce a shift , or complete destabilization , of the radion vacuum near the horizon , resulting in a radion cloud  around the mbh",
    "this cloud has an associated energy - dependent reflectivity , which can result in a distortion of the infrared portion of the hawking radiation spectrum , as well as a partial reflection of low energy particles incident upon the mbh from the outside . by looking at the forms of the effective potential @xmath7 near the hole s horizon and at asymptotic distances",

    "the effects of curved space would alter the gradient terms appearing in the @xmath269 portion of the radion eom , and therefore the gradient nature of the solution @xmath201 .",
    "the exact expressions for @xmath241 and @xmath270 would depend on the exact solution @xmath1 , but the basic qualitative features mentioned above for @xmath241 are not expected to be significantly affected .      in the limit of a static , ideal fluid in thermodynamic equilibrium , the local total energy density , or @xmath272 where @xmath273 is the fraction of energy carried by nonmassless particles . ]",
    "is@xcite @xmath274 , where @xmath275 is the blue - shifted hawking temperature . in this limit @xmath276 can become quite large or divergent near the horizon ( or would - be horizon ) .",
    "( there can be significant backreactions on the metric , and the studies@xcite,@xcite suggest that the horizon could be removed by a ( static ) hawking atmosphere , with @xmath135 remaining finite . ) if the horizon is not removed by backreactions , the local energy density can diverge on the horizon , due to the diverging blue - shifted local temperature@xcite .",
    "furthermore , quantum field effects such as vacuum polarization@xcite,@xcite,@xcite are expected to play important roles and may contribute to the @xmath277 term in the effective potential . in any case , whether @xmath135 diverges or remains finite near the black hole , the local value of @xmath175 and @xmath86 may become extremely large in the near horizon region , possibly leading to either @xmath257 or @xmath258 . in either of these cases",
    "@xmath278 , indicating an infrared radionic reflectivity .",
    "a kaluza - klein model with two spherically compactified extra dimensions , studied previously by davidson and guendelmann@xcite and by carroll , geddes , hoffman , and wald@xcite , is examined here with attention focusing on the development of a radion cloud around an evaporating neutral , nonrotating mbh .",
    "the cloud owes its existence not to the gravitational field alone ( a schwarzschild solution is accompanied by a trivial radion solution @xmath64 ) , but arises in response to the environmental effect of the hawking radiation .",
    "the radiation is modeled as a fluid with an effective energy density @xmath279 contributing to the radion equation of motion .",
    "an effective pressure @xmath126 is assumed to be related to @xmath135 through an equation of state @xmath142 const . with @xmath125 , resembling the perfect fluid hawking atmosphere  models of refs . @xcite and @xcite . for the particular case @xmath132 ,",
    "as is expected for a fluid of noninteracting masseless particles in thermal equilibrium , there is no environmental effect on @xmath1 .",
    "however , it is not assumed here that the fluid is in equilibrium , and the particle modes contributing to the energy density @xmath280 ( where @xmath136 is due to massless particle modes ) are those associated with particles of nonzero rest mass . the matter contribution to the radion effective",
    "potential is @xmath281 @xmath282 , which can be positive , negative , or zero , depending on the sign of @xmath283 .",
    "a classical description has been used to estimate the @xmath284 term in the radion equation of motion , but near the horizon quantum field effects such as vacuum polarization@xcite,@xcite,@xcite are expected to be important and may contribute to a shift in the radion vacuum .",
    "the radion @xmath1 approaches a normal vacuum value @xmath285 ( @xmath249 ) asymptotically , where the hawking radiation energy density vanishes , but near the mbh the radion is shifted to a value @xmath185 ( @xmath187 ) for any @xmath184 .",
    "gradients of @xmath1 and a nonzero radion potential @xmath0 then give rise to a radion cloud with nonvanishing energy density around the mbh .",
    "this radion cloud has an estimated size @xmath286 and an energy dependent reflection coefficient @xmath241 as studied in@xcite .",
    "this reflection coefficient has a maximum value @xmath10 ( given by ( [ a1 ] ) for the case of electromagnetic radiation in the flat space limit ) , which depends upon the parameter @xmath159 near the horizon .",
    "@xmath254 begins to become significant for particle energies @xmath287 .",
    "since the asymptotic compactification radius for the extra dimensions is @xmath288 , the size of the cloud compared to that of the extra dimensions in asymptotic space is @xmath289 which is initially small , but becomes of order unity at the end stages of the evaporation .",
    "an infrared portion of the hawking spectrum detected by an external observer will be suppressed if @xmath278 , and some low energy particles incident upon the mbh from the outside will be reflected back .",
    "the amount of reflectivity depends upon the temperature @xmath79 of the mbh ( and therefore the parameter @xmath159 near the horizon ) and particle energy @xmath243 . for high energy particles ( @xmath290 )",
    "the radion cloud is transparent .",
    "the hawking radiation contributes heavily to the effective potential @xmath4 for large @xmath175 , in which case @xmath10 may approach unity . for @xmath291",
    "one may have a vacuum with @xmath258 , while for positive values @xmath169 , the effective potential @xmath4 is completely destabilized , i.e. , a local minimum disappears . in this case",
    "the slope of @xmath7 is negative , and the radion rolls outward in time with @xmath292 increasing . in either case ,",
    "when @xmath184 , a radion cloud must develop , since @xmath64 and @xmath63 is not a solution of the radion eom .",
    "for @xmath184 the radion infrared albedo effect increases as the mbh evaporates .",
    "since transparency begins to set in at particle energies @xmath293 , the energy range of observable albedo effects ( @xmath294 ) will be very sensitive to the radion mass @xmath6 and therefore the size of the extra dimensions ."
