    "with a very broad redshift distribution and a mean redshift of around @xmath0@xcite , gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are becoming extremely useful tracers of star - forming galaxies .",
    "long - duration grbs are known to be associated with the deaths of short - lived massive stars@xcite and thus have the essential advantage that their detection requires only a single stellar progenitor .",
    "therefore , their detection is in principle independent of host galaxy luminosity .    the _ swift _ satellite and a suite of ground - based observatories are detecting , localizing and studying a large homogeneous sample of grbs .",
    "to take advantage of this unique sample , we have launched a dedicated programme aimed at building up a sample of host galaxies , based on _ swift _ detections and vlt follow - up .",
    "this is a large programme to be executed over a period of two years .",
    "the resulting host sample will be largely unaffected by dust extinction and entirely independent of host galaxy luminosity .",
    "a more thorough description of the survey and preliminary results are presented in hjorth et al .",
    "( in prep ) .",
    "the details of the sample selection are relatively straight - forward , i.e. the grbs have to be well - placed for optical follow - up observations : ( i ) detected by _ swift _ after 1 march 2005 when it was fully operational and automatically slewing .",
    "( ii ) an x - ray position is available , obtained by the _ swift _ xrt detector .",
    "( iii ) the galactic extinction is less than @xmath1mag .",
    "( iv ) declination favorable for vlt and not at a polar declination , i.e. @xmath2 .",
    "the concrete goals of the programme are to : ( i ) identify the grb hosts , reaching a limit of around @xmath3 and @xmath4 , which will allow us to detect extremely red objects . for non - detections of hosts",
    "we will spend additional time to reach a limit of around @xmath5 .",
    "while hosts have been detected for nearly all pre-_swift _ localized grbs , almost none have been detected in the _ swift _ era .",
    "( ii ) measure redshifts for grbs without absorption redshifts .",
    "( iii ) search for the ly@xmath6 emission line when possible , i.e. for bursts with a known redshift @xmath7 .",
    "( iv ) study the effects of dust reddening within hosts .",
    "( v ) determine the host luminosity function .",
    "finally , we will perform detailed studies of particularly interesting targets , e.g. short - duration grb hosts and very bright hosts .",
    "specifically , we will carry out emission line diagnostics , e.g. metallicity estimates via the @xmath8 method.@xcite",
    "the final host sample is expected to consist of approximately 70 galaxies of which a major fraction will have redshifts .",
    "the programme so far has consisted mostly of target build - up , observational preparation , data taking and preliminary analysis . to date , only six months after the start of the programme , we have completed roughly half of item ( i ) above ; @xmath9- and @xmath10-band imaging of three of the hosts is displayed in fig .",
    "[ hosts.fig ] as an example .",
    "the current average and median @xmath9-band magnitude of the sample is fainter than 25.5 .    with this programme",
    ", we hope to detect a number of faint galaxies ( such as the grb 030323 host@xcite ) that possibly dominate@xcite the total star - formation density at @xmath7 , but are impossible to find and study by other methods than grb selection . but most importantly , we will produce a coherent sample of grb host galaxies for future follow - up with the _ hst _ , _ spitzer _ , vlt , and later with alma and _"
