    "the recent successful preparation of monolayer graphene has generated a lot of interest in the physics community and efforts are underway to study the electronic properties of graphene @xcite .",
    "the nature of quasiparticles called dirac electrons in these two - dimensional systems is very different from those of the conventional two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) realized in semiconductor heterostructures .",
    "graphene has a honeycomb lattice of carbon atoms .",
    "the quasiparticles in graphene have a band structure in which electron and hole bands touch at two points in the brillouin zone . at",
    "these dirac points the quasiparticles obey the massless dirac equation . in other words , they behave as massless dirac particles leading to a linear dispersion relation @xmath1 ( with the characteristic velocity @xmath2 .",
    "this difference in the nature of the quasiparticles in graphene from conventional 2deg has given rise to a host of new and unusual phenomena such as anomalous quantum hall effects and a @xmath3 berry phase@xcite@xcite . among the electronic properties of interest",
    "is the interaction of electrons with artificially created periodic potentials .",
    "it has been observed that if conventional 2deg is subjected to artificially created periodic potentials in the submicrometer range it leads to the appearance of weiss oscillations in the magnetoresistance .",
    "this type of electrical modulation of the 2d system can be carried out by depositing an array of parallel metallic strips on the surface or through two interfering laser beams @xcite .",
    "besides the fundamental interest in understanding the electronic properties of graphene there is also serious suggestions that it can serve as the building block for nanoelectronic devices @xcite .    in conventional 2deg systems ,",
    "electron transport in the presence of electric and magnetic modulation has continued to be an active area of research @xcite .",
    "recently , electrical transport in graphene monolayer in the presence of electrical modulation was considered and theoretical predictions made @xcite .",
    "we have also carried out a study of magnetoconductivity when graphene monolayer is subjected to magnetic modulation alone@xcite . along the same lines , in this work we investigate low temperature magnetotransport of dirac electrons in a graphene monolayer subjected to both electric and magnetic modulations with the same period . from a practical point of view , this is important to consider as magnetic modulation of graphene can be realized by magnetic or superconducting stripes placed on top of graphene which in turn act as electrical gates that induce electric modulation . the relative phase of the two modulations can have important consequences for magnetotransport in the system as was seen in conventional 2deg . therefore in this work",
    "we investigate weiss oscillations in magnetoconductivity @xmath0 in a graphene monolayer for both the cases when the electric and magnetic modulations are in - phase and when they are out of phase .",
    "we consider two - dimensional dirac electrons in graphene moving in the @xmath4plane .",

    "we consider the perpendicular magnetic field @xmath5 modulated weakly and periodically along one direction such that @xmath7 . here",
    "@xmath8 is the strength of the magnetic modulation and @xmath9 with @xmath10 being the modulation period .",

    "hence the energy eigenvalues in the presence of the periodic magnetic modulation are @xmath39 with  @xmath40 $ ] .",
    "we observe that the degeneracy of the landau level spectrum of the unmodulated system with respect to @xmath41 is lifted in the presence of modulation with the explicit presence of @xmath41 in @xmath42 the @xmath43 landau level is different from the rest as the energy of this level is zero and electrons in this level do not contribute to diffusive conductivity calculated in the next section .",
    "the rest of the landau levels broaden into bands .",
    "the landau bandwidths @xmath44 oscillates as a function of @xmath23 since @xmath38 are oscillatory functions of the index @xmath23 .",

    "the main contribution to weiss oscillations comes from the scattering induced migration of the larmor circle center .",
    "this is diffusive conductivity and we shall determine it following the approach in @xcite where it was shown that the diagonal component of conductivity @xmath0 can be calculated by the following expression in the case of quasielastic scattering of electrons@xmath73\\tau(e_{\\zeta})(\\upsilon_{y}^{\\zeta})^{2 } \\label{10}%\\ ] ] @xmath74 , @xmath31 , are the dimensions of the layer , @xmath75  is the inverse temperature with @xmath76 the boltzmann constant , @xmath77 is the fermi dirac distribution function , @xmath78  is the electron relaxation time and @xmath79 denotes the quantum numbers of the electron eigenstate .",

    "to better understand the effects of in - phase modulations on the conductivity we consider the asymptotic expression of the quantity @xmath90 given by eq.(16 ) that appears in the magnetoconductivity @xmath0 .",
    "the asymptotic results are valid when applied magnetic field is weak such that many landau levels are filled .",

    "to get a better understanding of the results of the previous section we will consider the asymptotic expression of conductivity where analytic results in terms of elementary functions can be obtained following @xcite .",
    "the asymptotic expression of @xmath90 can be obtained by employing the following asymptotic expression for the laguerre polynomials which is valid in the limit of large @xmath23 when many landau levels are filled @xcite@xmath97 with the result that the in - phase bandwidth can be written as@xmath98 where the ratio between the two modulation strengths @xmath99 the flat band condition from the above equation is @xmath100 where @xmath101 is an integer .",

    "the phase factor @xmath120 depends on the relative strength of the two modulations .",

    "the change in @xmath46 results in a corresponding change in both @xmath121 and @xmath120 . from fig.(3 ) , we observe that the position of the extrema in magnetoconductivity as a function of the inverse magnetic field depends on the relative strength of the modulations .",

    "the energy eigenvalues are@xmath124 and the bandwidth is@xmath125 the term responsible for weiss oscillations is the @xmath126 term under the square root which can be readily seen by considering the large @xmath23 limit of the bandwidth",

    "\\label{28}%\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from the expression of the out - of - phase bandwidth given by eq.(25 ) we find that weiss oscillations in the bandwidth are absent for relative modulation strength @xmath127 , the same is reflected in @xmath90 as the term responsible for weiss oscillations ( @xmath131   $ ] ) vanishes for @xmath127 as can be seen from the above equation .",
    "therefore the magnetoconductivity @xmath0 does not exhibit weiss oscillations when the relative modulation strength @xmath132the conductivity as a function of magnetic field when the electric and magnetic modulations are out - of - phase is shown in fig.(4 ) .",

    "the other parameters are the same as in figs.(1,2,3 ) .",
    "as @xmath46 is varied there is a corresponding change in @xmath134 we find that the positions of the extrema of @xmath0 as a function of the inverse magnetic field do not change as @xmath121 is varied since the phase factor @xmath120 does not appear in the expression of conductivity when the two modulations are out of phase .",
    "it is also observed in fig.(4 ) that there is a @xmath96 phase difference between the curves for @xmath135 and @xmath136 the same behavior is observed in the bandwidth which is reflected in the magnetoconductivity . in this work",
    "we have considered weiss oscillations and have not taken pure shubnikov de hass ( sdh ) oscillations into account but sdh oscillations do appear superimposed on weiss oscillations in the region of strong magnetic field as can been seen in all of our figures .",
    "in addition , since this work was motivated by@xcite , it is important to compare the results obtained here for graphene monolayer with those presented for standard 2deg .",
    "in contrast to the work presented here , in @xcite sdh are explicitly taken into account but we find that our principal expressions eq.(23 ) , ( 28 ) reduce to the expressions there when the terms contributing to sdh oscillations are ignored .    in the end , we would also like to mention relevance of this work in experimental studies of transport in graphene .",
    "experiments on graphene monolayer in the presence of modulated electric and magnetic fields have not been realized yet , this theoretical work is in anticipation of experimental work .",
    "we expect that modulation effects predicted here can be observed in graphene employing established techniques that were used for the two - dimensional electron gas systems found in semiconductor heterostructures @xcite . in conventional semiconductor systems ,",
    "modulation of the potential seen by electrons can be produced by molecular beam epitaxy , chemical vapor deposition as well as sputtering techniques @xcite . in graphene",
    ", we expect that modulation effects can be introduced by adsorbing adatoms on graphene surface using similar techniques , by positioning and aligning impurities with scanning tunneling microscopy or by applying top gates to graphene .",
    "epitaxial growth of graphene on a patterned substrate is also possible @xcite .    in conclusion",
    ", we have determined the effects of both the electric and magnetic modulations on the magnetoconductivity of a graphene monolayer .",
    "appearance of weiss oscillations in the magnetoconductivity @xmath0 is the main focus of this work .",
    "these oscillations are affected by the relative phase of the two modulations and position of the oscillations depends on the relative strength of the two modulations . we find complete suppression of weiss oscillations for particular relative strength of the modulations when the modulations are out - of - phase .",
