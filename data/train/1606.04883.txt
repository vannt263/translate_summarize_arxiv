    "it is well recognised that solutions of water with organic molecules may show closed - looped phase diagrams with a miscibility gap .",
    "the occurrence of such phase diagrams with more than one critical point is very different from what is observed in mixtures of simple fluids . in simple fluids ,",
    "the two fluids form a homogeneous mixed phase at higher temperatures , whereas they phase separate at lower temperatures .",
    "the appearance of an upper critical point ( ucp ) terminating the two - phase coexistence results from a competition between the entropy of mixing and the energy . in the case of mixtures of complex species , such as water and some organic molecules ,",
    "the mechanism behind the occurrence of the miscibility gap is rather involved . as argued in refs .",
    "@xcite , the existence of a lower critical point ( lcp ) can be due to formation of directional bonds between water and the organic molecules , e.g. , hydrogen bonding .",
    "below the lcp , strong hydrogen bonding promotes mixing at the expense of rotational degrees of freedom of molecules , which are effectively `` frozen out '' by the bonding . at higher temperatures , thermal fluctuations `` unfreezes '' these rotational degrees of freedom so that the hydrogen bonding gets destroyed and the mixed phase separates .",
    "theoretical studies of simple lattice models and within the landau - ginzburg approach have demonstrated that the miscibility gap in liquid mixtures may indeed emerge due to angular dependent attractive interactions on top of the spherically symmetric ones  @xcite .",
    "experiments show that the shape of closed - loop phase diagrams of aqueous solutions of organic molecules near the lcp is very flat , i.e. , concentrations of the species in the two coexisting phases near lcp vary strongly with temperature .",
    "such behavior indicates that in both coexisting liquid phases some local structures are formed which are determined by hydrogen bonding between water and the organic molecules .",
    "the features of the miscibility gap , in particular its sensitivity to changes of the intermolecular interactions , has been studied theoretically  @xcite , by computer simulation ( for tetrahydrofuran - water mixtures )  @xcite , and experimentally  @xcite by several techniques , e.g. by deuteration of water , addition of electrolytic impurities or hydrotrops . as follows from these studies ,",
    "the details of the interactions affect the critical temperature as well as the detailed shape of the phase diagram .",
    "the aqueous solution of 2,6-lutidine ( 2,6-dimethylpyridine ) is a binary liquid mixture , which has gained considerable attention in context of its wetting behaviour at silica walls  @xcite , porous glass  @xcite , and colloids  @xcite .",
    "of particular interest has been the effect of temperature changes on the reversible aggregation of colloidal particles dispersed in a 2,6-lutidine / water mixture  @xcite .",
    "more recently , 2,6-lutidine / water mixtures were used to determine critical casimir interactions in colloidal systems @xcite .",
    "the reason for the popularity of 2,6-lutidine / water mixture in these studies is that it possesses a closed loop phase diagram with a relatively wide temperature miscibility gap , i.e. , the difference between the upper and lower critical point is large ( @xmath1197@xmath2 ) .",
    "further , the lcp is conveniently located near room temperature . the phase diagram as well as static and dynamic critical properties of 2,6-lutidine / water",
    "were studied intensively experimentally  @xcite .",
    "the lcp has been reported to occur at @xmath3k and at the lutidine mole fraction @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "the location of the lcp is , however , strongly affected by impurities and , moreover , it is sensitive to the method of determination .",
    "this is why the values of the lower critical temperature and the critical mass , volume or mole fraction vary in the literature  @xcite .",
    "such uncertainty is especially troublesome for application of a 2,6-lutidine / water liquid mixture as solvent in colloidal systems tuned by critical casimir interactions , where the precise knowledge of the deviation in temperature and concentration from the critical values is required .",
    "computer simulations of the 2,6-lutidine / water mixture are thus highly desirable . moreover",
    ", such simulations can help to better understand the molecular mechanisms behind the lower critical point , and are a necessary prerequisite for studies of more complicated phenomena such as , for example , formation of of mesostructures in a mixture of water / organic solvent by adding an antagonistic salt , which is composed of hydrophilic cation and hydrophobic anion .",
    "such mesostructures were observed recently in sans experiments in a mixture of water/3-methylpyridine / nabph@xmath5 near the lower critical point @xcite and off - critical point @xcite .",
    "a similar observation is reported for 2,6-lutidine / water mixture @xcite .",
    "these phenomena are only partially explained theoretically @xcite . another interesting topic , which can be an extension of the present work is critical adsorption of 2,6-lutidine / water mixture containing salt ( inorganic one ) at a charged and selective wall .",
    "this phenomenon is of crucial relevance to recent experiments on critical casimir interactions @xcite .",
    "the findings of these experiments were not yet clarified in a satisfactory manner and there is some controversy about their origin .",
    "some analytical studies of this problem are available in the literature @xcite .",
    "however , these results were obtained within a mesoscopic model and by using various approximations and thus they need to be verified by means of microscopic simulations .    in the present paper",
    "we propose an atomistic description of the 2,6-lutidine molecule and apply it to study the bulk 2,6-lutidine liquid as well as the 2,6-lutidine / water mixture near the lcp by molecular dynamics simulations . the goal is to check whether our model of the 2,6-lutidine molecule is able to capture the main features of the bulk fluid as well as those of the aqueous solution .",
    "all simulations were performed by the gromacs/4.6.7 package  @xcite .",
    "the gromos54a7 force field  @xcite was applied for lennard - jones ( lj ) pair potential parameters , bond lengths and bonded parameters for angles , and dihedrals .",
    "the particle mesh ewald ( pme ) approach  @xcite was applied for electrostatic interactions , while a cut - off length @xmath6 nm was applied to the lj interactions .",
    "simulations in this work were either performed in the npt ensemble ( constant pressure ) or nvt ensemble ( constant volume ) ; the type of ensemble is mentioned in the text in each case . in the npt ensemble ,",
    "the temperature and the pressure were controlled by a v - rescale thermostat @xcite and a parrinello - rahman barostat @xcite ( isotropically to @xmath7 atm ) , respectively . for the nvt ensemble ,",
    "the temperature was controlled by v - rescale and no pressure coupling was applied .",
    "all bond lengths were constrained with the lincs algorithm @xcite . for water",
    "the tip4p/2005 model was used @xcite .",
    "the simulation outcomes were analyzed through our own programs , gromacs and vmd plugins @xcite .",
    "-groups are considered as united atoms . ]",
    "we represent the 2,6-lutidine molecule , c@xmath8h@xmath9n , by 11 atoms wit the two ch@xmath10 groups treated as single united atoms as shown in fig .  [ model ] , while the hydrogen atoms that are attached to the ring carbons are explicitly included .",
    "the gromos force field does not provide partial charges on 2,6-lutidine molecule , therefore , we obtained an initial estimation of these charges from quantum chemistry simulations .",
    "then , we varied the values of these charges until two goals were achieved : ( i ) an agreement with the experimental results for the density @xmath11 and the heat of vaporization @xmath12 for liquid lutidine at temperatures around room temperature , and ( ii ) the existence of the lcp for the mixture of 2,6-lutidine and water in the experimental range ( details of 2,6-lutidine / water simulation will be given in subsec .",
    "[ w+l ] ) .",
    "more precisely , we gradually scaled the partial charges of 2,6-lutidine molecule by a factor in order to change its coulomb interaction with water until we obtained the lcp temperature close to experimental value . from experiments , we know that we should have a mixture at @xmath13 k and a phase - separated system at @xmath14k .",
    "therefore , for each rescaled charge distribution , simulations were carried out at these two temperatures .",
    "the appearance of mixed and phase - separated phases at these two temperatures ensures that the lcp is located somewhere in between . during the rescaling",
    ", we also took advantage of the fact that the molecule is symmetric and that the total charge is zero .",
    "moreover , we kept the charges on the hydrogen atoms and ch@xmath10-groups consistent with the gromos force field and just vary the remaining 3 parameters .      simulations were performed for @xmath15ns using a @xmath16 time step in the npt ensemble for the bulk system and in the nvt ensemble for the surface tension calculation .",
    "results collected after an equilibration of 10 ns , are presented together with the corresponding experimental data taken from refs .",
    "@xcite in table .",
    "the simulations provide data for the density @xmath17 , the static dielectric constant @xmath18 and the heat of vaporization @xmath19 in a fair agreement with the experimental ones .",
    "the heat of vaporization was calculated as   @xmath20 where @xmath21 denotes time average . @xmath22 and @xmath23 are potential energies of lutidine in the gas and liquid phases .",
    "the gas phase is considered as ideal so @xmath22 contains only interactions within the molecules .",
    "the surface tension @xmath24 was obtained from simulations of the liquid with two flat surfaces .",
    "this system was created by increasing the periodic box size of the equilibrated bulk system by one order of magnitude in one direction .",
    "the usage of a 1.2  nm cut - off for the lj interactions has resulted in a too small surface tension .",
    "therefore , we performed simulations of this system using pme treatment of lj interactions ( lj - pme ) .",
    "this gave the surface tension of @xmath25 mn / m in a better agreement with experiment .",
    "with the fractional charges used in the present model , the dipole moment of lutidine is @xmath26d .",
    "the experimental gas phase value is @xmath27d ( no experimental value is available for liquid ) .",
    "similar differences are encountered for most water models ; typically they predict about 30% larger dipole moment than possessed by water in a gas phase , although the difference here is slightly bigger .",
    "these differences are caused by the mutual polarization of molecules in the liquid phase .",
    "the good agreement between the experimental dielectric constant and the one calculated from fluctuations in the total dipole moment of the entire simulation box is reassuring and indicates that the electrostatic properties of the 2,6 lutidine fluids are properly modelled .",
    "finally , the heat capacities at constant pressure and constant volume , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , were calculated from the enthalpy and energy fluctuations in the simulations as @xmath30 the calculated value for @xmath28 given in the last row of the table .",
    "[ tab1 ] shows a substantial difference compared to the experimental value .",
    "the reason for this is that the _ classical _ treatment of the lutidine molecules allows too much energy to be taken up by degrees of freedom that in reality are _ quantum mechanical_. a quantum - correction could , however , be added to the classical heat capacity assuming that the relevant degrees of freedom could be approximated as coupled harmonic oscillators . to do this we follow refs .",

    "[ lj+coul ] ( right ) shows the number of hydrogen bonds between water and 2,6-lutidine molecules per lutidine molecule . from the figure",
    "it is seen that upon decreasing temperature the number of hydrogen bonds between water and 2,6-lutidine molecules increases , in line with the behaviour seen in fig .",

    "in this study , we have proposed an atomistic description of the 2,6-lutidine molecule which we have shown is able to successfully describe bulk 2,6-lutidine liquid .",
    "we then have employed this model together with the tip4p/2005 water model to study the phase behaviour of 2,6-lutidine / water mixture near the lcp .",
    "we conclude that by using these models for molecules it is possible to describe the critical properties of the mixture well . from the density profiles computed in simulations",
    "we have obtained phase diagram of the mixture with the lower critical temperature @xmath31 , which is just a couple of degrees higher than the experimental value  @xcite .",
    "we have found that the ucp is located between @xmath32-@xmath33  k , in agreement with experiments  @xcite .",
    "we have computed the order parameter , the surface tension and the correlation length as a function of temperature .",
    "as expected , the order parameter and the surface tension vanish upon approaching the lcp from above , while the correlation length increases .",
    "moreover , we have found that close to @xmath34 the temperature dependence of these quantities is well described by power laws .",
    "the calculated exponents deviate less than about @xmath35 from those of the 3d ising universality class  @xcite to which the studied system belongs",
