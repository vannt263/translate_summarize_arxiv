    "gamma - ray burst ( grb ) light curves at @xmath3-ray energies are often highly variable , and generally this is attributed to internal shocks occurring at some radius @xmath4 cm from the center of a relativistic outflow produced by a violent collapse or merger , beyond the  photospheric \" radius at which the flow becomes optically thin to scattering by electrons associated with the baryons entrained .",
    "this photosphere is a source of soft thermalized radiation , which may be observationally detectable in some grb spectra , and may also result in inverse compton cooling of the non - thermal electrons accelerated in the shocks occurring outside it , thereby enhancing a hard gev non - thermal component at the expense of the usual mev synchrotron component .    at small enough radii",

    "bursts dominated by either the baryonic photosphere or by pair - producing shocks may be identified with x - ray excess bursts ( preece 1996 ) , while the latter resemble at least the harder examples of the proposed x - ray flash ( heise 2001 ) sub - class of grb .",
    "the existence of a limiting pair - forming shock radius provides also a scenario which combines recent work on the interpretation of afterglow light - curve breaks in terms of a jet opening angle ( frail 2001 ; panaitescu & kumar 2001 ; piran 2002 ) or a universal jet shape ( rossi , lazzati & rees 2002 ; zhang & 2002 ; salmonson & galama 2002 ) , and work on the gamma - ray variability - luminosity relationship ( fenimore & ramirez - ruiz 2001 ; reichart 2001 ) . identifying the pair shock radius as an approximate boundary above which shocks lead to more strongly variable gamma - ray light curves and below which shocks result in smoother x - ray rich light curves , a phenomenological jet model leads to a simple physical explanation of the quantitative form of the variability - luminosity relationship .",

    "a strong baryonic photosphere dominated burst ( with quasi - thermal @xmath77 mev spectrum ) is possible ( for shock efficiencies @xmath208 ) for @xmath209 , and such a component may be detectable already for @xmath210 . on the other hand ,",
    "slower @xmath211 outflows are likelier to make x - ray rich bursts through a pair - shock component .",
    "we argue also that the relationship between variable gamma - ray radiation and the limiting pair - shock radius leads , using the phenomenologically inferred dependence between isotropic luminosity and jet angle , to a simple analytical interpretation for the observed variability - luminosity relation @xmath212 ( e.g. fenimore and ramirez - ruiz 2001 ; see also kobayashi 2002 ) .",
    "the positive correlation between variability and harder @xmath213 peaks discussed by lloyd - ronning & ramirez  ruiz ( 2002 ) also finds a qualitatively similar interpretation in terms of a higher variability corresponding to closer - in shocks , which are more specifically in the present model shocks occurring just above the limiting pair - forming shock radius .",
    "several physical explanations have been proposed for the presence of a cutoff above about 1 hz in the power density spectrum of grb light curves ( beloborodov 1998 ) in terms of baryonic electron scattering ( e.g. panaitescu 2000 ; spada 2000 ; ramirez - ruiz & lloyd - ronning 2002 ) . here",
    "we point out a different explanation for this , which is based on the existence of a minimum @xmath3-ray variability timescale ( equation [ [ eq : tvpm ] ] ) above which shock radiation is free from smoothing by opacity from pair - formation .",
    "this is seen in figure 1 , which shows that shocks associated with the variability timescales @xmath214 s and @xmath215 common among observed grb occur above the pair photosphere .",
