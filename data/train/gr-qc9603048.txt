    "compact binaries in their late stage of evolution are very relativistic systems in which the two compact objects ( neutron stars or black holes ) orbit around eachother with velocities as large as 30  % of that of light . the gravitational radiation these systems emit during the inspiral phase preceding the coalescence of the two objects is expected to be routinely analyzed in future detectors like ligo and virgo ( see @xcite for reviews ) .",
    "hundreds to tens of thousands of gravitational - wave cycles should be monitored in the detectors sensitive frequency bandwidth .",
    "the combination of high orbital velocities and a large number of observed rotations , together with the fact that the emitted waves are highly predictable , implies that high - order relativistic ( or post - newtonian ) effects should show up in the gravitational signals observed by virgo and ligo @xcite . alternatively , this means that high - order post - newtonian effects should be known in advance so that they can be included in the construction of theoretical filters ( templates ) to be cross correlated with the outputs of the detectors .",
    "the relevant model for describing most of the observed inspiral phase is a model of two point masses moving on a circular orbit .",
    "radiation reaction forces tend to circularize very rapidly the orbit . on the other hand ,",
    "point masses can be used in the case of non - rotating and ( initially ) spherically symmetric compact objects up to a very high precision @xcite .",
    "this is due to a property owned by general relativity of `` effacing '' of the internal structure . even in the case of stars with intrinsic rotations",
    "the dynamics of the binary is likely to be dominated by post - newtonian gravitational effects @xcite .",
    "high - order post - newtonian effects that are measurable are mainly those affecting the orbital phase evolution of the binary , which in turn is determined using a standard energy balance argument by the total power emitted in the form of gravitational waves by the system at infinity , or total luminosity in the waves .",
    "to what level in a post - newtonian expansion should we know the gravitational luminosity ( or energy loss ) in order to guarantee an optimal detection of the signal ( given some power spectral density of the noise in a detector ) is still unclear , but the theory of black - hole perturbations can be used to gain insights in this problem .",
    "black - hole perturbations , which deal with the special case of a test mass orbiting a massive black hole , have been recently the focus of intense activity @xcite .",
    "it emerges from this field that neglecting even a so high approximation as the third post - newtonian ( 3pn ) one , i.e. neglecting the relativistic corrections in the luminosity which are of relative order @xmath0 ( or below ) , is likely to yield unacceptable systematic errors in the data analysis of binary signals @xcite .",
    "this shows how relativistic are inspiralling compact binaries , as compared for instance to the binary pulsar for which the newtonian approximation in the luminosity ( einstein quadrupole formula ) is adequate .",
    "the post - newtonian theory is presently completed through the second post - newtonian ( 2pn ) approximation , i.e. , through relative order @xmath1 ( both in the waveform and in the associated energy loss ) .",
    "two computations were performed to this order , one by blanchet , damour and iyer @xcite based on a post - minkowski matching formalism , and one by will and wiseman @xcite using an approach initiated by epstein and wagoner @xcite and generalized by thorne @xcite .",
    "the common result of these two computations for the energy loss was summarized in ref .",
    "@xcite , and the waveform can be found in @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we develop the post - minkowski matching formalism one step beyond the work of refs .",
    "@xcite by computing the 2.5pn order in the energy loss of an inspiralling binary .",
    "this entails extending both ref .",
    "@xcite on the general formalism valid for an arbitrary ( slowly - moving ) source , and ref .",
    "@xcite dealing with the specific application to the binary .",
    "the computation of the waveform of the binary to 2.5pn order ( the square of which should give back the 2.5pn energy loss ) will be left for future work .    the post - minkowski matching formalism is a wave generation formalism which is especially suited for `` semi relativistic '' sources whose internal velocities can reach 0.3c at most ( say ) , as in the case of inspiralling compact binaries ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the formalism combines ( i ) an analytic post - minkowskian approximation scheme for the computation of the gravitational field in the exterior of the source where multipole expansions can be used to simplify the problem , ( ii ) a direct post - newtonian approximation scheme for the resolution of the field equations inside the near - zone of the source , and ( iii ) an asymptotic matching between both types of solutions which is performed in the exterior part of the near zone .",
    "the necessicity of using a post - minkowskian approximation scheme first is because its validity extends up to the regions far away from the system where the observer is located , contrarily to the post - newtonian approximation whose validity is limited to the near zone .",
    "the exterior field is computed using an algorithm developed in ref .",
    "@xcite which set on a general footing previous investigations by thorne  @xcite and bonnor  @xcite .",
    "the implementation of the wave generation formalism ( i)-(iii ) was done at first with 1pn accuracy in ref .",
    "@xcite which obtained the 1pn correction terms in the mass - type quadrupole moment of the source ( and in fact in all the mass - type multipole moments ) .",
    "the dominant nonlinear contribution in the radiation field was added in ref .",
    "@xcite and shown to be due to the contribution in the wave zone of the well - known  tail \" effect .",
    "the inclusion of this nonlinear contribution pushed the accuracy of the formalism to 1.5pn order in the energy loss .",
    "the 2pn precision both in the energy loss and waveform was reached in ref .",
    "@xcite where the second ( 2pn ) correction terms in the mass - type multipole moments and the first ( 1pn ) ones in the current - type multipole moments were obtained . an equivalent expression of the 1pn current - type moments had been derived earlier @xcite , however in a different form which is not amenable to generalization to higher order ( but turned out to be useful in applications @xcite ) .",
    "the main result of the present paper is the expression of the 2.5pn - accurate energy loss by gravitational radiation from a general ( semi relativistic ) source , and from an inspiralling compact binary . in the latter case of application , the 2.5pn contribution in the energy loss",
    "is found to be entirely due to tails in the wave zone ( this is like the 1.5pn contribution ) , and to reduce in the test - body limit to the known result of perturbation theory @xcite .    with the energy loss one can derive the laws of variation of the inspiralling binary s orbital frequency and phase using an energy balance equation .",
    "however note that this is a weak point of the analysis because the latter energy balance equation has been proved to hold only at the newtonian order ( see @xcite for general systems , and @xcite for binary systems ) , and more recently at the 1pn order @xcite .",
    "it is also known to hold for the specific effects of tails at 1.5pn order @xcite .",
    "to prove this equation at the 2.5pn order as we would need below , one should in principle obtain the equations of motion of the binary up to the very high 5pn order ( or order @xmath2 ) beyond the newtonian acceleration .",
    "indeed the radiation reaction forces which are responsible for the decrease of the binding energy of the binary are themselves dominantly of order 2.5pn beyond the newtonian term .",
    "the only method which is available presently in order to deal with this problem is to _ assume _ that the 2.5pn - accurate radiation reaction forces are such that there is exact agreement between the loss of 2.5pn - accurate binding energy of the binary ( as computed from the damour - deruelle equations of motion @xcite ) and the 2.5pn - accurate energy flux we shall compute below .",
    "this assumption is verified at the 1.5pn order and sounds reasonable , but will have to be justified in future work .    as an indication of the quantitative importance of the 2.5pn approximation in the orbital phase of the binary ,",
    "we compute the contribution of the 2.5pn term to the number of gravitational - wave cycles between the entry and exit frequencies of some detector .",
    "essentially we find that the 2.5pn approximation is of the same order of magnitude as the 2pn term ( computed in @xcite ) , but opposite in sign .",
    "in the case of two neutron stars of mass @xmath3 and of the frequency bandwidth [ 10 hz , 1000 hz ] , the 2pn term contributed to @xmath4 units to the total number of cycles @xcite .",
    "we find here that the 2.5pn term contributes to @xmath5 cycles in the same conditions .",
    "this shows the importance of the 2.5pn approximation for constructing accurate theoretical templates .",
    "[ however , we find that the contribution of the finite mass effects in the 2.5pn term ( which can not be obtained in perturbation theory ) is numerically small . ]    in the present paper we shall make a thorough investigation ( see sections  ii , iii and iv below ) of all the relativistic corrections in the multipole moments of the system which contribute to the 2.5pn - accurate energy loss .",
    "however when we are interested only in the application to inspiralling compact binaries , this investigation can be seen a posteriori to be unnecessary .",
    "indeed the orbit of an inspiralling binary is _ circular _ , and we shall prove in this case that the 2.5pn relativistic corrections in the multipole moments give in fact no contribution in the energy loss . as we said above",
    ", the only contribution is that of the tails present at this order ( see section vi ) .",
    "a simple argument ( concerning the result at 2.5pn order of a contracted product of tensors made of the relative separation and velocity of the bodies ) could be used beforehand to see that this is true . but because inspiralling compact binaries may not constitute the only sources for which the 2.5pn approximation in the energy loss is needed , or simply because one may need in the future to consider the case of a binary moving on an eccentric orbit , we have chosen in this paper to compute systematically all the terms which enter the 2.5pn - accurate energy loss for general systems .",
    "this permits us to show explicitly that all the terms but the tail terms give zero in the energy loss for ( circular ) inspiralling binaries .",
    "the simple argument mentioned above may be used in future work to simplify the investigation of higher post - newtonian orders .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in the following section ii and in the next one iii we follow step by step the derivation done in ref .",
    "@xcite of the near - zone gravitational field and the corresponding matching equation , and show how this derivation can be extended to the 2.5pn order . in section iv we obtain the explicit 2.5pn corrections arising in the mass - type multipole moments .",
    "section  v deals with the derivation of the energy loss formula valid for general systems ( however some coefficients are left un - specified in the formula ) .",
    "finally these results are applied in section  vi to inspiralling compact binaries .",
    "appendix a derives a useful integration formula and appendix b presents a relevant summary of the 2.5pn equations of motion .    throughout this paper",

    "following the plan of paper  i we first investigate the gravitational field generated by a slowly moving isolated source in its _ near zone _ , which is defined in the usual way as being a zone whose size is of small extent with respect to a typical wavelength of the emitted radiation .",
    "two distinctive methods are used .",
    "the first one is a direct post - newtonian iteration ( speed of light @xmath6 ) of the field equations inside the source , and is valid all - over the near zone .",

    "<S> this paper derives the total power or energy loss rate generated in the form of gravitational waves by an inspiralling compact binary system to the five halves post - newtonian ( 2.5pn ) approximation of general relativity . extending a recently developed gravitational - wave generation formalism valid for arbitrary ( slowly - moving ) systems , we compute the mass multipole moments of the system and the relevant tails present in the wave zone to 2.5pn order . in the case of two point - masses moving on a quasi - circular orbit , </S>",
    "<S> we find that the 2.5pn contribution in the energy loss rate is entirely due to tails . </S>",
    "<S> relying on an energy balance argument we derive the laws of variation of the instantaneous frequency and phase of the binary . </S>",
    "<S> the 2.5pn order in the accumulated phase is significantly large , being grossly of the same order of magnitude as the previous 2pn order , but opposite in sign . </S>",
    "<S> however finite mass effects at 2.5pn order are small . </S>",
    "<S> the results of this paper should be useful when analyzing the data from inspiralling compact binaries in future gravitational - wave detectors like virgo and ligo . </S>"
