    "in recent years , several authors have proposed methods to test the so - called cosmic distance duality relation ( cddr ) , which is derived from etherington reciprocity theorem @xcite . in the astronomical framework , considering that photons number is conserved over the cosmic evolution and that they follow null ( unique ) geodesics , the cddr is expressed as @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the luminosity and angular diameter distances in a given redshift , @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "the cddr plays an essential role in observational cosmology and any departure from it could point to exciting new fundamental physics , such as , photon coupling with particles beyond the standard model of particle physics , variation of fundamental constants , absorption by dust or unaccounted systematic errors ( for a detailed discussion , see @xcite and @xcite ) . nowadays , the results from different methods , involving luminosity distances of type ia supernovae , angular diameter distances of galaxy clusters , gas mass fractions of galaxy clusters , the blackness of the cosmic microwave background and gamma - ray bursts , have been consistent with the validity of the cddr at least within 2@xmath7 level  @xcite .",
    "however , new methods with different astronomical observations and redshift range offer a path to validate the whole cosmological framework as well as to detect unexpected behavior or systematic errors .",
    "very recently , observations of strong gravitational lenses systems were used to perform tests of the cddr @xcite . in this paper",
    "we explore further possible constraints on the cddr with this kind of observation .",
    "strong gravitational lens is an important effect arising from einstein s theory of general relativity which has played a very important role as a probe of the nature of dark matter in the universe as well as in tests of cosmological models @xcite .",
    "a known quantity is the einstein radius , which varies with cosmological models via the ratio of the angular diameter distances between lens / source and observer / source .",
    "basically , it occurs when the source ( s ) , the lens ( l ) and the observer ( o ) are well aligned with the observer - source direction @xcite .",
    "the einstein radius @xmath11 , under the simplest assumption describing the mass distribution in lenses , the singular isothermal sphere ( sis ) , is given by    @xmath12    where @xmath13 is the speed of light , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the angular diameter distances between lens - source and source - observer , respectively , and @xmath16 is the velocity dispersion due to lens mass distribution .    briefly , by changing the ratio between angular diameter distances by a between luminosity distances via a deformed cddr , @xmath17 , it is possible to perform constraints on @xmath5 functions ( see next section for details ) .",
    "for instance , by considering @xmath18 , the authors of @xcite used 95 data points from 118 strong gravitational lensing ( sgl ) systems obtained by @xcite , 580 type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) from union2.1 @xcite , the latest results from _ planck _",
    "collaboration @xcite and wmap9 satellite @xcite to put limits on @xmath19 . in @xcite",
    "was proposed a cosmological - model independent test ( only a flat universe was assumed ) by assuming @xmath20 and using 60 sgl - sne ia pairs from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the results from both works confirmed the validity of the cddr ( @xmath21 into 1 @xmath7 c.l . ) .",
    "however , the sample from @xcite has sgl systems that reach @xmath3 up to 3.5 and , consequently , a basic limitation of the analyses quoted above is the impossibility of using the entire sgl sample .",
    "the reason is very simple : to perform the test it is necessary to find sne ia and sgl systems at identical redshifts , but several lenses of the sgl data lie at @xmath22 , which is the maximum redshift of the sne ia in the union2.1 compilation .",
    "therefore , several sgl systems were excluded in the previous analyses . on the other hand , since one of the main goal of this kind of analysis is to test the validity of the cddr at different regimes , reaching higher redshifts is of fundamental importance to put limits on a possible @xmath5 evolution .    in this paper , based on the method proposed by @xcite , we test the cddr validity up to high redshifts by using all the 118 sgl systems from @xcite , sne ia from the union2.1 compilation and the latest gamma - ray burst distance module data @xcite .",
    "gamma - ray bursts ( grb s ) are the most energetic explosions in the universe being detectable up to very high redshifts .",
    "the new data corresponds to 162 points in the redshift range @xmath4 , therefore , beyond the sne ia redshifts . in this way",
    ", we added to the sne ia union2.1 data all gamma - ray bursts with @xmath23 , the limit redshift of the sne ia sample , resulting in 677 luminosity distances . from the theoretical viewpoint , we consider two @xmath5 functions , namely , @xmath24 ( p1 ) and @xmath25 ( p2 ) @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : section ii briefly revises the method proposed by ref .",
    "@xcite . in section",
    "iii we present the samples used in the analysis . in section",
    "iv we show and discuss the main results of this paper .",
    "we summarize the results of this work in section v.",
    "the method to test the cddr validity proposed by @xcite uses sgl systems and sne ia observations and does not depend on assumptions concerning the details of cosmological model ; only a flat universe is assumed .",
    "firstly , let us consider eq .",
    "( 2 ) and define the observational quantity : @xmath26 on the other hand , in a flat universe , the comoving distance @xmath27 is given by @xcite @xmath28 now , using @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 , we find @xmath32 finally , using the deformed cddr , such as , @xmath33 , the above expression can be written as @xmath34 then , with sgl measurements and the luminosity distances to the lens and source of each system known , it is possible to study the evolution of the @xmath5 function and test the cddr .",

    "in our work , we use the following data sets : +    * 118 sgl systems from ref .  @xcite . these systems were observed in sloan lens acs survey ( slacs ) , boss emission - line lens survey ( bells ) , lenses structure and dynamics survey ( lsd ) and strong legacy survey sl2s surveys with redshift ranges : @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "we consider the two approaches of @xcite to describe the lensing systems : the sis model where a spherically symmetric mass distribution in lensing galaxies is also assumed .",
    "but the rigid assumption of the sis model was relaxed in favor of a more general power - law index @xmath37 , @xmath38 ( plaw model ) .",
    "this kind of model is important since several studies have shown that slopes of density profiles of individual galaxies show a non - negligible scatter from the sis @xcite . under this assumption",
    "the einstein radius is : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the stellar velocity dispersion inside the aperture of size @xmath41 and @xmath42 ^ 2.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] therefore : @xmath43 the distribution becomes a sis for @xmath44 . in table 1 of @xcite",
    "is displayed all relevant information necessary to obtain @xmath45 in eq.(7 ) for both models and perform our fit .",
    "it is important to stress that the @xmath16 in eq.(3 ) is not to be exactly equal to the observed stellar velocity dispersion @xmath46 since there is a strong indication that dark matter halos are dynamically hotter than the luminous stars based on x - ray observations .",
    "in order to account for this difference it is introduced a phenomenological free parameter @xmath47 , defined by the relation : @xmath48 , where @xmath49 @xcite . when the plaw model is considered",
    "we perform our analysis by using a flat prior on @xmath50 : @xmath51 . also following these authors , we replace @xmath40 by @xmath46 in the plaw model . +",
    "* the full sne ia sample compiled by suzuki et al .",
    "( 2012 ) @xcite , the so - called union2.1 compilation , see fig.(1 ) .",
    "this sample comprises 580 data points in the redshift range @xmath52 . + * grb distance moduli , @xmath53 , from demianski et al .",
    "( 2016 ) @xcite .",
    "the original data set has 167 grb s in the redshift range @xmath4 ( see fig .",
    "it is worth mentioning that , although details of the physical mechanism behind grb explosions are not completely known yet , an important observational aspect of long grb s are the several correlations between spectral and intensity properties , which suggest that grb s can be used as distance indicators .",
    "the authors of @xcite used a local regression technique jointly with sne ia luminosity distances ( union2.1 compilation ) to calibrate these correlations .",
    "a possible redshift dependence of the correlation and its effect on the grb hubble diagram were tested and no significant redshift dependence was found .    finally , we added to sne ia data 97 grb with @xmath3 s higher than 1.42 .",
    "we obtain the luminosity distance , @xmath9 , to each sne ia and grb from : @xmath54 mpc and @xmath55 .",
    "then , we parameterize their luminosity distances with a second degree polynomial function was compatible with 0 at 1@xmath7 , @xmath56 . ] , such as : @xmath57 ( in mpc ) , with @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 , with @xmath63 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . following @xcite , we added a 0.15 systematic error to sne ia data",
    ". therefore , due to high @xmath64 of the grb , the @xmath1 function can provide the luminosity distances to the lens and source of each sgl system in @xcite .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the constraints on the @xmath19 parameter are derived by evaluating the likelihood distribution function , @xmath65 , with @xmath66 ^ 2}{\\sigma_i^2 }                                                                 \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 ( p1 ) and @xmath18 ( p2 ) , @xmath67 stands for the statistical errors associated to the @xmath1 function of the sne ia , grb s , the gravitational lensing observations and it is obtained by using standard propagation errors techniques . for the gravitational lensing error one may show that : @xmath68 while for @xmath1 function :    @xmath69    since our @xmath1 comes from a polynomial function , the points @xmath70 and @xmath71 are correlated .",
    "however , we constructed the covariance matrix and the terms off diagonal are negligible .    our results for the p1 and",
    "p2 functions are plotted in figures ( 2a ) and ( 2b ) .",
    "the solid blue and dashed black lines correspond to the likelihood distribution functions for the @xmath19 parameter by using the plaw and sis models , respectively .",
    "the black solid horizontal lines correspond to 1 and 2 @xmath7 ( c.l . ) .",
    "the values of @xmath19 are displayed in table i along with the results from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "as one may see , differently from previous analyses , our likelihoods depend more strongly on the @xmath5 functions , probably due to the high-@xmath3 data used in the analysis .",
    "for instance , the analysis using the sis model excludes the cdrr validity in @xmath72 ( c.l . ) when p1 is used . on the other hand , using p2 the cddr validity is verified at 1@xmath7 .",
    "however , when the plaw model is considered , the @xmath19 is compatible with @xmath6 into 1.5@xmath7 c.l .",
    "regardless of the @xmath5 function used . as commented earlier , since",
    "several studies have shown that slopes of density profiles of individual galaxies show a non - negligible scatter from the sis , we can conclude that our results do not show any indication for deviations from cddr validity .",
    "in the last few years , the main fundamental hypotheses of the standard cosmology have been tested thanks to the improved precision of cosmological data .",
    "one of them is the so - called cosmic distance duality relation involving angular diameter , @xmath10 , and luminosity distances , @xmath73 .",
    "this result is theoretically valid for all cosmological models based on the riemannian geometry , being independent either upon einstein field equations or the nature of matter .",
    "nowadays , model - independent tests using exclusively cosmological distances have been restricted up to redshifts @xmath74 , the maximum @xmath3 of type ia supernovae compilations . in this paper , we have proposed a test that consider 118 angular diameter distances of the strong gravitational lens systems in the redshift range @xmath75 @xcite and 677 luminosity distances comprising 580 type ia supernovae from union2.1 compilation plus 97 gamma - ray bursts with @xmath76 .",
    "these gamma - ray bursts are from a sample of 162 distance moduli with the redshift range @xmath4 from @xcite .",
    "we have parameterized the luminosity distances of the type ia supernovae plus gamma - ray bursts with a second degree polynomial ( @xmath63 ) and used the following deformed cosmic distance duality relations : @xmath77 ( p1 ) and @xmath78 ( p2 ) to constrain the allowed interval of @xmath19 .",
    "we have obtained that the cdrr validity verification depends on the assumptions used to describe the lensing systems ( see figs .",
    "2a and 2b ) .",
    "for instance , when the power law model was considered , the @xmath19 value was compatible with @xmath6 into 1.5@xmath7 c.l .",
    "regardless of the @xmath5 function used .",
    "the simplest model , the singular isothermal sphere model , excludes the cdrr validity in @xmath72 level for p1 . therefore , since recent studies have shown that slopes of density profiles of individual galaxies show a non - negligible scatter from the singular isothermal sphere model , we may conclude that our results at high redshifts do not indicate any significant deviation from the cddr .",
