    "while some physical disciplines such as classical mechanics and electrodynamics underwent profound changes with the birth of quantum mechanics and relativity , thermodynamics proved impressively robust over the last century .",
    "the main reason is that the formulation of thermodynamics rests on few pillars only , such as entropy , temperature and the three laws relating these state variables .",
    "the grandness of thermodynamics is that these concepts hold independently of the details of the corresponding total system dynamics .",
    "nonetheless , the statistical mechanical foundation of thermodynamics strongly relies on the quantum mechanical properties of matter in particular what concerns the low temperature behaviour .",
    "statistical mechanics gives rise to some subtle issues when going from a closed description of all degrees of freedom , including those of large environments , to a reduced description of an _ open _ system where all bath degrees of freedom are traced over .",
    "generally no problems arise in the weak - coupling limit where the system - bath interaction tends to zero .",
    "this is the situation typically assumed explicitly , or at least implicitly , in the majority of textbooks . even in this limit , however , pitfalls can arise in the quantum case , as recently elucidated in @xcite .",
    "generally , care must also be taken in defining correctly the expression for ( gibbs ) work in the first law , as recent debates on the validity of nonlinear fluctuation theorems have given evidence @xcite .    in this work",
    "we emphasize the finiteness of the coupling between the open quantum system and an environment of temperature @xmath4 .",
    "the finite coupling will be modelled in terms of a generalized quantum langevin equation ( gle ) with a velocity - proportional memory friction , i.e. ohmic damping .",
    "an equivalent microscopic approach is provided by a bilinear coordinate - coordinate coupling between system degrees of freedom and environmental degrees of freedom , see e.g. in @xcite and references given therein .",
    "the presence of an ohmic friction term leads to an irreversible motion with a unique stationary state .",
    "already at this level , prominent differences with the classical situation emerge .",
    "as is well known , the classical canonical thermal equilibrium probability assumes the familiar gibbs - boltzmann expression @xmath5 , with @xmath6 being the bare system hamiltonian in absence of interaction .",
    "most remarkably , this classical result holds true independently of friction strength . in striking contrast , the equilibrium density operator of an open quantum system becomes a function of the friction strength @xcite , thus exhibiting a dependence on the coupling to the environmental degrees of freedom .",
    "this feature can explicitly be inspected for an ohmic - like , damped harmonic quantum oscillator @xcite : only in the weak coupling limit does the canonical density operator reduce to the common gibbs state , where @xmath6 then represents the operator - valued system hamiltonian .",
    "given this observation in the preceding paragraph it should not come as too big a surprise that the evaluation of thermodynamic quantities for an open quantum system , such , for example , as its specific heat , is also plagued with subtleties .",
    "these difficulties all originate from the assumed finite system - bath interaction . for the case of specific heat of a linear quantum oscillator of finite friction strength",
    "this was explicitly demonstrated in a recent work @xcite . while in absence of damping zero entropy is approached exponentially fast ,",
    "this approach is weakened with finite friction to a power law dependence in friction strength and temperature @xcite .",
    "the third law has also been validated for the quantum dissipative oscillator in the presence of velocity - coordinate and velocity - velocity couplings @xcite as well as for a charged oscillator in a magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the main finding is that the thermodynamic entropy of the open system vanishes according to a power law in temperature with the same exponent that characterizes the frequency dependence of the memory friction in the limit of vanishing frequency .",
    "it was remarked in @xcite , however , that the definition of the specific heat is ambiguous and may lead to pronouncedly different values .",
    "therefore , the relation to experimental observations needs scrutiny , in particular in the study of nanosystems that behave quantum in nature but still are coupled with finite strength to an environment .",
    "another surprising observation is that the familiar von - neumann entropy for a quantum dissipative oscillator _ fails _ to approach zero for vanishing bath temperature @xcite .    in the following we elucidate in detail the complications that arise",
    "when evaluating thermodynamic quantities of open quantum systems whose dissipation strength is finite .",
    "a most suitable test bed is the case of a _",
    "free quantum particle _ @xcite .",
    "it is our working hypothesis that this simple system better be understood first before daring to embark on more complex physical situations . as is well known",
    ", a classical free particle does not obey the third law .",
    "surprisingly , the coupling to a heat bath renders the system more quantum thereby helping to restore the third law @xcite .    the work is organized as follows . in the next section we couple a free quantum particle to a heat bath which exerts a finite dissipation on the free particle .",
    "we then focus on the evaluation of thermal equilibrium quantities , in particular the specific heat . in",
    "we introduce two definitions of the specific heat which a priori both seem physically well motivated .",
    "their properties are investigated in sections [ sec : energy ] and [ sec : entropy ] .",
    "the emerging results cause worrisome `` baffling '' which we attempt to resolve by inspecting more closely the underlying density of states of a dissipative free particle .",
    "some conclusions and consequences are given in our final section .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction a free particle , or more generally , an ensemble of non - interacting , distinguishable particles fails to approach zero entropy at accessible temperatures .",
    "this classical behaviour is modified when the particle is able to exchange energy with a heat bath .",
    "we therefore focus on the simplest situation of a free quantum particle of mass @xmath7 which is coupled to a heat bath made up of harmonic oscillators .",
    "the total hamiltonian of particle plus bath thus reads ( see ) @xmath8 where @xmath9 describes the free particle with momentum operator @xmath10 , and @xmath11 represents a set of harmonic oscillators constituting the heat bath which is bi - linearly coupled to the free particle via its position operator @xmath12 by @xmath13 here , the coupling constants have been chosen without loss of generality in such a way that the ensemble of free particle and heat bath is translationally invariant so that the damped particle can still be considered as free .     which is coupled with finite strength @xmath1 through an interaction @xmath14 to a bath described by a hamiltonian @xmath15 .",
    "the total system composed of system plus bath is weakly coupled to a super - bath which provides the working temperature @xmath16 in thermal equilibrium.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    elimination of the heat bath leads to an effective equation of motion for the position operator of the damped free particle , the quantum langevin equation of a free particle , reading @xmath17 the coupling to the heat bath results in a damping kernel @xmath18 and an operator - valued noise term @xmath19 \\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which depends on the initial conditions of free particle and heat bath .",
    "the sum of the second and third contribution of this expression , i.e. @xmath20 only depends on the initial positions and momenta of the heat bath and is characterized by a vanishing first moment , @xmath21 while the symmetrized correlation function obeys @xmath22 here , @xmath23 denotes an expectation value with respect to the equilibrium density matrix @xmath24 $ ] of the isolated bath . the temperature @xmath16 is imposed on the heat bath via the weak coupling to a super - bath ( see ) .",
    "the commutator of the noise is non - vanishing , reading @xmath25=-\\mathrm{i}\\hbar\\sum_{i=1}^nm_i\\omega_i^3",
    "\\sin\\big(\\omega_i(t - s)\\big)\\,,\\ ] ] and guarantees that the familiar commutator - relation between position @xmath12 and momentum @xmath10 is obeyed at all times , as required by quantum mechanics .    in the following , we will restrict ourselves to the so - called drude model of quantum dissipation where the damping kernel describes exponential memory on the time scale @xmath26 . for positive arguments @xmath27 ,",
    "the damping kernel assumes the form : @xmath28 while for negative times we formally obtain @xmath29 .",
    "this in turn assures that the symmetrized correlation function of the time - homogeneous noise correlation in obeys a generalized einstein relation @xcite .",
    "the value @xmath1 yields the damping strength according to @xmath30 for later use we will also need the laplace transform of the damping kernel , which is given by @xmath31    the total mass of the heat bath can be expressed via the appealing formula @xcite @xmath32 as a consequence of the fact that the drude model behaves ohmic for low frequencies , i.e.  @xmath33 goes to a positive constant @xmath1 for @xmath34 , this heat bath behaves non - ballistic in the sense that it assumes an infinite mass .",
    "the drude model is typically employed for regularization purposes . as an example we mention that in the case of strict ohmic dissipation , i.e.  memoryless damping where @xmath35 , the second moment @xmath36 of the momentum @xmath10 with respect to the equilibrium density matrix of system plus bath exhibits an ultraviolet divergence . for the purposes of the regularization of such a quantity",
    ", it is assumed that @xmath26 is by far the shortest time scale in the problem apart possibly from the thermal time scale @xmath37 . for a free particle subject to drude damping one therefore typically assumes @xmath38 . in this paper",
    ", we drop the requirement of a high - frequency cutoff which in turn enables us to study also structured , uncommon environments which may contain a low - frequency cutoff @xmath39 , even smaller than the damping strength @xmath1 .",
    "the drude model represents the simplest reservoir with memory in the sense that the memory effect can be described by a single additional degree of freedom .",
    "in fact , the deterministic equation of motion , i.e. where @xmath40 is set to zero , is equivalent to @xmath41 this system of differential equations contains a zero - frequency mode because system plus bath is translationally invariant . the remaining two eigenfrequencies are obtained from the second and third equation which describe a damped harmonic oscillator with damping strength @xmath39 and oscillator frequency @xmath42 . for @xmath43 ,",
    "one finds exponentially damped motion which for very large cutoff frequencies contains the time scales @xmath1 and @xmath39 as expected .",
    "however , for sufficiently small cutoff frequency , where @xmath44 , the eigenvalues become complex and one observes a damped oscillation .",
    "this makes the drude model more interesting than one might initially expect .",
    "we note that a thermodynamic description of a free particle can be meaningful only if the particle is confined to stay within a box of finite size .",
    "the presence of the box leads to the quantization of the energy levels with the typical excitation energy @xmath45 between the first excited state and the ground state for a one - dimensional box of length @xmath46 with reflecting walls .",
    "this system in isolation ( i.e. in the absence of dissipation ) approaches zero entropy only at extremely low temperatures when the thermal energy is comparable to or below the energy difference between the first excited and the ground state .",
    "we will restrict our investigations to temperatures which are high enough such that the discreteness of the spectrum of a single free particle can be ignored even in the weak coupling limit , i.e. we will always assume that @xmath47 . for a helium atom at a temperature of approximately 500pk  the lowest temperature which can be reached today in the laboratory  the thermal energy and the excitation energy are equal for a cavity of linear size of the order of 30@xmath48 m .",
    "even for such extremely low temperatures a handy box of linear size of , say , 1 cm would suffice to meet the required condition with @xmath49 . in order that any quantum effects can survive under thermal conditions rendering the discreteness of the particle spectrum practically invisible , the bath must provide relevant energy scales that are large compared to the thermal energy . in the case of a bath with a drude cutoff",
    ", these relevant energies are given by the damping constant and the cutoff frequency .",
    "hence , a regime of low temperatures with @xmath50 exists where quantum effects can be expected to become relevant .",
    "we are interested in the specific heat of a free damped particle .",
    "the volume in which the particle can move , will be assumed very large but fixed . in this case , the specific heat is obtained from the internal energy @xmath51 by taking the derivative with respect to the temperature @xmath16 , i.e. @xmath52    usually , it is supposed that the coupling of the system to the heat bath defining the temperature can be treated in the limit of vanishing coupling strength . however , here we are interested in the case of finite coupling where the meaning of the system s internal energy is no longer obvious . in the following ,",
    "we will study two different approaches .",
    "one possibility is to replace @xmath51 by the energy @xmath53 defined as expectation value of the system hamiltonian @xmath6 @xmath54 where @xmath55}{\\tr_\\mathrm{s+b}[\\exp(-\\beta h)]}\\,.\\ ] ] this leads to our _ first _ definition of a specific heat @xmath56 this definition is based on the system hamiltonian @xmath6 and includes the interaction of the system with the bath only via the density matrix of the total system .",
    "alternatively , one can start from the well - known and widely used expression for the partition function of the reduced system : it is defined in terms of the partition functions of the coupled system and of the uncoupled bath as @xcite @xmath57 }    { \\tr_\\mathrm{b}[\\exp(-\\beta h_\\mathrm{b } ) ] } \\;,\\ ] ] where the total hamiltonian @xmath58 consists of contributions from the system , the bath , and the coupling according to . employing the standard relation between partition function and internal energy",

    "particularly disturbing is the observation that this difference is not solely given by the expectation value of the interaction hamiltonian @xmath14 , but still contains the difference of the bath energies caused by the interaction with the system .",
    "we can now proceed and define a _",
    "second _ specific heat , reading @xmath61 the partition function also allows us to define an entropy @xmath62\\,.\\ ] ] this results from the thermodynamic relation @xmath63 with the free energy @xmath64 .",
    "alternatively , the second specific heat can as well be derived from the entropy ; i.e. @xmath65 is equivalently obtained as @xmath66    our main concern is that these two routes of obtaining a specific heat generally yield different results .",
    "this will be elucidated further by studying the dissipation model of the drude form when applied to the simple quantum dynamics of a free particle .",
    "we start our exploration of the specific heat by employing the definition based on the expectation value of the system energy @xmath67 here , @xmath7 denotes the mass of the particle and @xmath10 the momentum operator . for a general heat bath leading to an equation of motion of the form and for thermal energies @xmath68 which are large compared to the energy scale @xmath69 one finds @xcite @xmath70\\ ] ] with the matsubara frequencies @xmath71 . in the high - temperature limit",

    "has @xmath73 and therefore @xmath75 .",
    "it is tempting to drop the second term in the numerator of the sum and to evaluate the resulting sum which converges even for strict ohmic damping .",
    "however , this would yield a specific heat which diverges as the temperature approaches zero ( see also the discussion after ) .",
    "the reason for this unphysical behaviour is that for constant @xmath33 the sum in does not converge and therefore derivatives should not be taken term - by - term .    for the drude model , one obtains with for the specific heat @xmath76 : @xmath77-\\frac{1}{2 } \\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath78 denotes the trigamma function and @xmath79 the behaviour of this result",

    "high _ temperatures @xmath16 much larger than @xmath82 and @xmath83 , the specific heat approaches the expected classical result with the leading quantum corrections reading @xmath84 at _ low _ temperatures , i.e for @xmath85 but still @xmath86 the specific heat goes to zero linearly according to @xmath87    this behaviour is in agreement with the third law : finite quantum dissipation thus restores the validity of the third law of a free particle already at temperatures for which the discreteness of the particle spectrum is still irrelevant .",
    "the limiting behaviour is inversely proportional to damping strength .",
    "put differently , strong dissipation diminishes the prefactor and thereby yields a turnover to the classical behaviour at higher temperatures only .",
    "the leading low - temperature behaviour of the specific heat only depends on the low - frequency behaviour of @xmath33 .",

    "this term is important because it ensures that the specific heat does not diverge for @xmath91 .",
    "in order to obtain the specific heat from the partition function , one must first determine the latter quantity for the damped free particle .",

    "we recall that the modifications due to the environmental coupling do not take into account the presence of confining walls . in using this expression for the partition function",
    ", we therefore assume a sufficiently large confining box so that boundary effects , which could show up in the partition function , can safely be neglected",
    ".    the specific heat can be calculated from the partition function either by means of the internal energy or the entropy .",
    "both routes lead to identical results . in order to stay close to the reasoning of the previous section , we choose the first alternative .",

    "an analysis along the lines presented above for the free damped particle indeed shows that the density of states , apart from a delta - function contribution , starts out at low temperatures with a positive value .",
    "however , the positivity condition of a density of states defined by is by no means obvious as we will discuss next .    by its statistical mechanical definition",
    "the partition function is the sum over the boltzmann factors counted with the multiplicity of the respective eigenenergies and therefore coincides with the laplace transform of the density of states as a function of the energy .",
    "the corresponding laplace variable is the inverse temperature @xmath140 .",
    "this in particular implies that the inverse laplace transform of any proper partition function must not assume any negative values .",
    "apparently , the positivity of the density of states is not automatically guaranteed by the above definition as can be seen in the case of a free particle .",
    "another example is provided by a system which is coupled to a rather trivial bath consisting of a single oscillator with angular frequency @xmath141 . in this case one",

    "these eigenenergies constitute a discrete spectrum .",
    "the first factor of the right - hand side coincides with the partition function of the total system , @xmath145 and the second term represents the inverse of the partition function of the bath consisting of a single oscillator .",

    "therefore , neither does @xmath126 represent a physically meaningful density of states nor must its laplace transform @xmath149 be interpreted as the partition function of the reduced system .    for reservoirs which represent true thermal baths both the total system and the reservoir alone will have a continuous spectrum such that a more subtle compensation of the different contributions to the inverse laplace transform may indeed lead to a positive density of states and a corresponding , physically meaningful partition function .",
    "in this work we compared two definitions of specific heat for a free quantum particle which interacts at a finite strength with an oscillator heat bath possessing a drude cutoff .",
    "the first definition was based on the assumption that the equilibrium expectation value of the hamiltonian @xmath150 of the system can be identified with the thermodynamic internal energy of the particle .",
    "the resulting specific heat approaches the classical result for high temperatures and goes to zero for vanishing temperature in accordance with the third law .",
    "the second definition is based on the ratio of the partition functions of the total system and the heat bath which traditionally is identified as the partition function of an open quantum system @xcite .",
    "the two definitions yield different results which even disagree in the high temperature regime in terms of their quantum corrections . if one associates ( as done commonly ) to each of the three partition functions of the total system , the system and the bath a free energy , the free energy of the open system is expressed as the difference of the free energies of the total system and the heat bath , in accordance with the `` most remarkable formula '' of ford , lewis and oconnell @xcite .",
    "we found that this definition may lead to unphysical results for the damped free particle , such as negative specific heat and negative regions of the density of states . a corresponding analysis of the respective quantities for a damped harmonic quantum oscillator though does not show any violations of their formal properties @xcite .",
    "this latter fact alone does not resolve the encountered baffling : the finding of a thermodynamic consistent result which is in no apparent violation with formal properties , such as a truly positive - valued density of states , does not necessarily imply that the so obtained values are physically meaningful .",
    "the definition of the specific heat via the expectation value of the system hamiltonian @xmath150 leads to a quantity that can be measured in principle .",
    "in contrast , no clear scheme seems to be available for a measurement of the specific heat that derives from the partition function of the reduced system .",
    "the conundrum of the physical meaning of a partition function of a reduced system that is coupled with finite strength to an environment thus still remains .",
    "we emphasize once more that the detected difficulties all `` evaporate '' when the dissipation can be described within the weak - coupling limit .",
    "however , the impressive experimental progress on tailored , well - defined nanosystems that behave quantum in nature but intrinsically are in interaction with omnipresent macroscopic environments requires to go beyond weak coupling .",
    "it thus calls for an urgent clarification of the thermodynamics of nanosystems and related issues .    financial support of the german excellence initiative via the _ nanosystems initiative munich _",
