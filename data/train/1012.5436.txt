    "the two - dimensional hubbard model @xcite on a square lattice is widely believed to hold a key role for the understanding of high - temperature superconductivity in the cuprates . in analogy to the cuprate phase diagram it seems to exhibit antiferromagnetic and @xmath0-wave superconducting order in close vicinity @xcite ; for a systematic overview , see ref . .",
    "the tendency toward @xmath0-wave superconductivity was already predicted by some strikingly simple scaling approaches @xcite . on a higher level of technical sophistication , the fermionic functional renormalization group approach @xcite has been of great help to analyze in detail the competition of different types of instabilities .    the main result of the present paper concerns the phase diagram in the low temperature regime , where spontaneous symmetry breaking occurs either in the antiferromagnetic or in the @xmath0-wave superconducting channel .",
    "the symmetry broken regimes are difficult to access for fermionic functional renormalization group studies such as @xcite .",
    "renormalized mean field investigations @xcite , based on a combination of the fermionic functional renormalization group approach with a mean field treatment , have already been able to study the mutual influence of the order parameters for antiferromagnetism and @xmath0-wave superconductivity .",
    "the functional renormalization group approach presented in this paper makes it possible to investigate this problem by entering the spontaneously broken regimes in a partially bosonized language where the different types of bosonic fields that are introduced correspond to the different types of possible order of the system .",
    "we find a region of electron fillings with competition between antiferromagnetic and superconducting order .",
    "the two phenomena show a strong tendency of mutual exclusion . nevertheless , we find regions where the two types of _ local _ order coexist , even though this coexistence may not be maintained on the length scales of global order .",
    "we also find near the van hove filling a considerable range of temperatures with local but not global antiferromagnetic order .",
    "for smaller electron filling the critical temperatures for the onset of local and global superconducting order almost coincide .",
    "an overview of our findings in form of the @xmath2-phase diagram ( for next - to - nearest neighbor hopping @xmath3 and hubbard repulsion @xmath4 ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ phasediag ] .",
    "the approach presented in this work focuses on the low temperature behavior and brings together earlier attempts @xcite to perform a functional renormalization group analysis of the two - dimensional hubbard model based on partial bosonization ( or hubbard - stratonovich transformation ) @xcite . in analogy to the parametrization methods for the fermionic four - point vertex proposed and developed in @xcite , this method makes it possible to treat the complex momentum dependence of this function in an efficient , simplified way , involving only a comparatively small number of coupled flow equations .",
    "the fermionic four - point vertex , which is a scale - dependent function of three independent momenta , is decomposed in terms of bosonic propagators and yukawa couplings , which are each functions of only one variable .",
    "the main advantage of the method used in the present work consists of the possibility of following the renormalization group flow into regimes where one or more symmetries of the hubbard hamiltonian are spontaneously broken .",
    "( for other renormalization group studies of symmetry broken phases in similar models see @xcite . ) at a certain scale @xmath5 of the renormalization flow , the momentum - dependent fermionic four - point vertex may diverge , and this signals the onset of local collective order . in order to extend the renormalization group treatment to the locally ordered regimes ,",
    "composite degrees of freedom such as magnons and cooper pairs are made explicit in terms of composite bosons .",
    "these correspond to different types of collective order the system might exhibit . a nonzero expectation value of the magnon field , for instance , signals the presence of some form of magnetic order , and a nonzero value of some cooper pair field signals superconducting order .",
    "different cooper pair fields are distinct due to different symmetries of the order parameters they correspond to .",
    "the language of partial bosonization , where the different types of bosons are taken into account explicitly , is therefore the right tool to investigate the regimes exhibiting different forms of collective order .",
    "a particular advantage of the present approach , which combines functional renormalization and partial bosonization , is that it allows to investigate the possible coexistence of different types of order in the same range of parameters .",
    "earlier renormalization group studies using the framework of partial bosonization ( see refs . ) incorporate only a comparatively small number of bosonic fields and therefore obtain a poorer resolution of the four - fermion vertex .",
    "in addition , they suffer from the so - called mean - field ambiguity @xcite which refers to the fact that by the use of the fierz relations the microscopic hubbard action can be mapped by different hubbard - stratonovich transformations into various equivalent descriptions involving different bosonic fields . in the presence of approximations the final results eventually depend on the specific choice of the decomposition . as argued in ref .",
    ", this shortcoming can be avoided in the present approach by explicitly keeping the original hubbard repulsion @xmath6 in the truncation .",
    "contributions to the four - fermion vertex that emerge during the flow are attributed to the different bosonic channels , depending on their momentum structure and therefore in an essentially unbiased way . a remaining bias concerns the choice of bosons taken into account .",
    "we choose to include four different bosons corresponding to magnetic , charge density , @xmath7-wave and @xmath0-wave superconducting order .",
    "this choice can be motivated by the structure of the one - particle - irreducible ( 1pi ) diagrams from which the contributions to the flow of the fermionic four - point vertex are derived @xcite .",
    "our truncation for the flowing action includes , for the symmetric regime , the parametrization of the four - fermion vertex already used in ref . .",
    "furthermore it contains quartic bosonic couplings for the antiferromagnetic and @xmath0-wave superconducting bosons as well as self - energy corrections for the fermions in terms of a frequency - dependent wave function renormalization .",

    "our main conclusion is that functional renormalization combined with partial bosonization can give direct and physically transparent access to the low temperature behavior of the hubbard model .",
    "we have computed the temperature dependence of the superfluid density or the antiferromagnetic order parameter for temperatures below the critical temperature from which the associated gaps for the electrons can easily be determined .",
    "taking into account the fluctuations of composite bosons we can incorporate the important contributions from collective spin waves or @xmath0-wave superconducting bosons .",
    "this allows us to compute the critical temperature as a function of the chemical potential and therefore to establish the phase diagram .",
    "the physics of collective boson fluctuations is quantitatively important .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ phasediag ] by the substantial difference between the pseudocritical temperature ( which is often associated with the critical temperature in other approaches ) and the true critical temperature .",
    "also the understanding of the region with coexisting local antiferromagnetic and superconducting order ( in fig .",
    "[ phasediag ] for @xmath300 between approximately @xmath301 and @xmath302 ) would be different without a proper understanding of the bosonic fluctuations .",
    "it is obvious that more extended truncations can substantially improve the quantitative accuracy .",
    "one may include into the flowing momentum - dependent four - fermion vertex ( instead of a constant @xmath6 ) the changes which can not be absorbed by bosonization into the present channels , or one could increase the number of bosonic channels retained .",
    "furthermore , a more accurate parametrization of the momentum and frequency dependence of the bosonic and fermionic propagators could be helpful .",
    "one may go beyond the quartic polynomial approximation for the effective bosonic potential , both in order to account for possible first order phase transitions and to give a more accurate description of the universal critical behavior for the second order phase transitions .    nevertheless , we believe that several of our findings are rather robust .",
    "this concerns the existence of an extended region in the phase diagram for which local order but no long - range order exists .",
    "in particular , the transition between antiferromagnetic and superconducting order is rather complex , with coexisting local antiferromagnetic and superconducting order , but also a strong tendency of exclusion of coexisting long - range order due to the bosonic fluctuations ."
