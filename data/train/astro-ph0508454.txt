    "using the wmap - determination of the baryonic density @xcite , one obtains predictions of the abundances of the light element isotopes produced in big bang nucleosynthesis @xcite . while the overall values from theoretical predictions and from the observational determinations of the abundances of d and @xmath4he are in good agreement , the theory tends to predict a higher @xmath0li abundance ( by a factor 2 to 3 ) than is observed in the atmospheres of halo dwarf stars @xcite .",
    "the nacre compilation @xcite provided a new set of reaction rates that were used to update the predictions of contemporary big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) @xcite . at that time , the baryonic densities obtained from cmb observations on the one hand and comparison between bbn calculations and spectroscopic data on the other hand were only marginally compatible @xcite . in order to improve the nuclear network ,",
    "@xcite recently performed a re - analysis of low energy data from the 10 key nuclear reactions involved in bbn , by using r - matrix theory @xcite and evaluating the remaining uncertainties in a statistically robust formalism . using this improved network ,",
    "@xcite have recently calculated bbn light element productions assuming for the baryonic density the very precise value provided by wmap @xcite and obtained @xmath2li / h@xmath5 compared to the observed value li / h @xmath6 , confirming the @xmath2li discrepancy .",
    "however , it has been shown @xcite that the @xmath2be(d , p)2@xmath3 reaction ( which destroys the @xmath2be that is the source of @xmath2li at high baryonic density ) , would solve the @xmath2li problem _ if _ its cross section were much higher than assumed .",
    "importantly , prior to the present work , _ no direct experimental data at bbn energies _ were available ( for @xmath7 gk , the gamow window is @xmath8 mev ) .",
    "in fact , the @xmath2be(d , p)2@xmath3 reaction rate relied on an extrapolation made by @xcite based on experimental data at center - of - mass ( c.m . ) energies of 0.6 to 1.3 mev from @xcite . in this experiment , protons corresponding to the @xmath9be @xmath10 ground state ( g.s . ) and first excited state ( 3.03 mev , @xmath11 ) were detected at 90@xmath12 using a nai(tl ) detector .",
    "assuming an isotropic angular distribution , @xcite multiplied the measured differential cross section by @xmath13 and by a further factor of 3 to take into account the estimated contribution of the higher energy @xmath9be states , not observed by @xcite .",
    "consequently , a constant @xmath14-factor of 100 mev - barn was adopted .    in order to obtain @xmath0be(d ,",
    "p)2@xmath3 reaction cross section at bbn energies , we have performed an experiment at the cyclone radioactive beam facility at louvain - la - neuve , belgium , using an isobarically pure @xmath0be radioactive beam . the experimental method and results",
    "are presented in section 2 .",
    "the astrophysical consequences are discussed in section 3 .",
    "the conclusions are given in section 4 .",
    "the measurements were performed using a post - accelerated @xmath2be@xmath15 radioactive beam at a nominal energy of 5.8 mev provided by the cyclone110 cyclotron .",
    "a detailed description of the production of the @xmath2be beam can be found in @xcite . to suppress the contamination from the @xmath0li isobaric beam , the @xmath0be beam",
    "was completely stripped to @xmath0be@xmath16 by transmission through a thin @xmath17c foil , prior to analysis by a dipole magnet .",
    "prior to the @xmath2be(d , p)2@xmath3 measurement , the beam energy was determined using a calibrated si detector situated at 0@xmath12 . a laboratory energy of 5.55 mev ( fwhm @xmath18 ) was determined , including a correction for pulse height defect .",
    "this energy was degraded to 1.71 mev ( fwhm @xmath19 ) using a 6 @xmath20 m mylar foil located at 50 cm upstream of the target .",
    "no @xmath0li contamination was observed , consistent with lithium isotopes being unable to support a 4 + charge state .",
    "the target consisted of a 200 @xmath20g/@xmath21 ( cd@xmath22)@xmath23 self - supporting foil . with this set - up",
    ", we were able to investigate the center - of - mass energy range between 1.00 and 1.23 mev ( for a beam energy of 5.55 mev , without degrader ) and between 0.13 and 0.38 mev ( for 1.71 mev , with degrader ) .",
    "the cross section measurement was averaged over these energy ranges .",
    "in addition to the feeding of the ground and first excited states of @xmath9be @xcite , we were able to observe the @xmath0be+d reaction via other kinematically allowed higher energy levels , mainly through a very broad @xmath24 state ( @xmath25 mev ) situated at an excitation energy of 11.4 mev in @xmath9be @xcite . at the beam energy of 5.55 mev , several states in @xmath9be above the @xmath0be+d - p threshold",
    "are present but due to the coulomb barrier in the final state , their contribution are expected to be negligible .",
    "the @xmath26 value of the @xmath0be(d , p)@xmath9be reaction is 16.49 mev , thus the laboratory energies of protons and @xmath3 particles are high .",
    "for example , a 5.55 mev @xmath0be beam traversing a 200 @xmath20g/@xmath21 ( cd@xmath22)@xmath23 target will lead to the production of protons with energies anywhere between about 7.5 and 22 mev , for the range of angles covered .",
    "thus , to clearly identify the protons from the @xmath0be+d reaction from those arising from reactions on the c content of the target , a stack of two ` leda ' silicon strip detector arrays @xcite were employed covering a laboratory angular range of @xmath27 .",
    "a schematic view of the experimental set - up is shown in figure 1 .",
    "the @xmath28 detector consisted of eight sectors of 0.3 mm thickness , while the @xmath29 detector consisted of four sectors of 0.3 mm thickness and four of 0.5 mm thickness .",
    "they were calibrated using a 3-line @xmath3-source ( @xmath30pu , @xmath31am , @xmath32 cm ) and a precision pulser .",
    "this @xmath33 detector system allowed a clear identification of the protons produced in the @xmath0be(d , p)@xmath9be reaction .",
    "all the particles that are not stopped in the front @xmath28 detector and that are either stopped or that left energy on the back @xmath29 detector are protons ( having an energy of more than 6.5 mev ) that populated levels up to the 11.4 mev state in @xmath9be .",
    "we were able to measure the @xmath2be(d , p)2@xmath3 cross section up to an excitation energy in @xmath9be of @xmath34 mev for a beam energy of 5.55 mev and of @xmath35 mev for 1.71 mev . only about 50% of the contribution of the @xmath24 broad state",
    "was observed at 1.71 mev . other light particles ( p , d , @xmath36he , @xmath4he ) from @xmath0be+@xmath17c reactions , as well as recoils and scattered particles , were completely stopped in @xmath28 .",
    "figures 2 and 3 show spectra obtained at beam energies of 5.55 and 1.71 mev , respectively .",
    "the spectrum obtained at 1.71 mev ( figure 3 ) was accumulated over about 26 hours of running time with an averaged @xmath0be beam intensity of @xmath37 pps .",
    "as can be seen , the proton signals are well separated from the background signals ( @xmath38 mev ) , which are produced by random coincidences of @xmath3 particles , scattered @xmath0be and recoil ions in the @xmath28 detector with @xmath39 particles in @xmath29 .",
    "the locus with negative slope contains protons that have passed through the front @xmath28 detector and stopped in the back @xmath29 detector .",
    "the two loci with positive slope are events in which the proton has sufficient energy to pass through both detectors completely .",
    "there are two bands because of the two different thickness @xmath29 detectors .",
    "the most strongly populated regions at the lower left of these bands correspond to protons losing the least energy in passing through the silicon , and thus to the highest energy events . by considering the kinematics and energy losses in silicon @xcite , together with the straggling of the beam and experimental energy resolution",
    ", one may then identify events on the positive slope locus up to 2.5 ( 3.9 ) mev for the 0.3 ( 0.5 ) mm si thickness wafer , as corresponding to events in which the recoiling @xmath9be nucleus is in either the @xmath10 g.s . or the @xmath11 excited state ( the energy resolution is insufficient to resolve the two ) .",
    "the total statistical error was 10% for the beam energy of 1.71 mev and less than 2% for 5.55 mev ( for protons populating the @xmath10 and @xmath11 states it was 13% and 2.5% , respectively ) .",
    "the absolute normalization was obtained using events arising from the elastic scattering of the @xmath0be on the c content of the target ( as recorded by the @xmath28 detector in which the @xmath0be are stopped ) , and assuming that the @xmath0be+@xmath17c elastic scattering follows the rutherford law .",
    "this assumption is realistic at energies below the coulomb barrier , as is the case here .    to calculate the average cross section over the energy ranges and angular coverages @xmath40 ,",
    "the number of counts was corrected for the detector solid angle ( uncertainty @xmath41 ) , the number of deuterons in the target ( @xmath42 ) and the total number of incoming beam particles ( @xmath43 and @xmath44 at the higher and lower beam energies , respectively ) , and transformed into the c.m .",
    "system .",
    "the proton angular distribution over the angular range covered here was found to be isotropic at both energies .",
    "thus , we assumed full isotropy and calculated the average cross sections , @xmath45 mb at the effective energy of 0.37 mev and @xmath46 mb at 1.15 mev .",
    "the summed contribution of the @xmath10 and @xmath11 states was about 64% of @xmath47 at 1.15 mev . at 0.37 mev",
    ", @xmath47 includes the contribution of the ground and @xmath11 states and about 50% of that of the @xmath24 broad state . due to the low penetration probability ( @xmath48 ) , the contribution of the @xmath24 state should be less than 36% .",
    "thus , the @xmath47 value at 0.37 mev corresponded to more than 80% of the total cross section ( for a @xmath24 state with @xmath25 mev ) . this was taken into account in the systematic uncertainty .    in nuclear astrophysics",
    "it is usual to present the cross section in the form of the astrophysical @xmath14-factor @xmath49 given by @xcite , @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the sommerfeld parameter ( @xmath52 , with @xmath53 and @xmath54 the charge numbers of the target and beam and @xmath55 is the velocity ) and @xmath56 is the effective c.m .  energy . in the absence of sharp resonances , the @xmath14-factor varies smoothly with energy . figure 4 shows the @xmath0be(d , p)@xmath9be astrophysical @xmath14-factor @xmath57 in mev - barn as a function of the c.m .  energy . for a comparison with the data of @xcite ( open circles ) , the present data including only contributions from the ground and first excited states of @xmath9be ( filled circles ) are shown .",
    "the agreement with the @xcite data at overlapping energies is satisfactory , given the systematic uncertainties .",
    "the total s - factor is also shown ( filled triangles ) .",
    "the present data show that the higher energy states not observed by @xcite contribute about 35% of the total @xmath14-factor instead of the 300% estimated by @xcite .",
    "hence , the @xmath0be(d , p)@xmath9be reaction rate is smaller by a factor of about 2 at energies in the range 1.0 to 1.23 mev and by about 10 at energies relevant to bbn , than previously estimated .",
    "this excludes a nuclear solution to the primordial lithium abundance problem via the @xmath0be(d , p)@xmath9be reaction as its effect is completely negligible compared to the 7% ( @xmath58 ) nuclear uncertainty on the @xmath0li yield .",
    "nevertheless , these results allow a more accurate determination of the @xmath0li abundance using bbn models .",
    "since the pioneering work of @xcite , who found a value of li / h@xmath59 independent of fe / h ( for [ fe / h]@xmath60 ) there have been many independent observations of li confirming the existence of a plateau and suggesting that this abundance reflects the primordial li value . however , the li abundance extracted from observations depends drastically on the assumed surface temperature of the star ( @xcite ) .",
    "recent observations @xcite have lead to li / h @xmath61 which is very close to the first evaluation @xcite .",
    "the more recent work studied and quantified the various sources of uncertainty : extrapolation , stellar depletion and stellar atmosphere parameters . compared to the wmap+bbn value , the discrepancy is a factor of @xmath62 .",
    "if it is shown that there is a mechanism by which the outer layers of population ii stars are transported deep into the stellar interior , then there are several ways in which li abundances might be depleted over the lifetime of the star . in this context , the current estimates for possible depletion factors may be in the range @xmath63 dex @xcite",
    ". however , the data typically show negligible intrinsic spread in the li abundance leading to the conclusion that depletion in these stars is of the order of 0.1 dex .",
    "recently , @xcite have obtained a higher value for the li plateau abundance ( @xmath64 ) due to a new effective temperature scale which is higher at low metallicity .",
    "this new evaluation diminishes the discrepancy , without canceling it .",
    "the observation of @xmath65li is also of interest , since , because it is more fragile than @xmath0li , it can provide yet more severe constraints upon possible depletion mechanisms @xcite . finally , in spite of the various uncertainties related to li observations and to the stellar models , it is very difficult to reconcile the bbn @xmath0li and the spite plateau which presents a narrow dispersion all along the metallicity scale .",
    "the existence of the spite plateau for li seems to indicate that low metallicity halo stars are indeed representative of the primordial bbn abundance . in particular",
    ", the isotope @xmath0li plays a key role as a bridge between big bang nucleosynthesis , stellar evolution and galactic cosmic - ray nucleosynthesis . at present",
    "there is a significant discrepancy between the bbn - predicted @xmath0li abundance ( assuming a baryon density consistent with the concordance model derived from observations of anisotropies in the microwave background ) and the abundance determined from the observations of li in the atmospheres of halo stars .",
    "the experiment reported here demonstrates that the @xmath2be(d , p)2@xmath3 @xmath14-factor at bbn energies was not underestimated by @xcite but , on the contrary , _",
    "overestimated_. the discrepancy can not therefore be resolved by nuclear physics inputs to bbn calculations .",
    "the remaining conventional options ( those not invoking physics beyond the standard model ) are an adjustment of the stellar input parameters needed to extract the li abundances from observations , or stellar depletion of @xmath0li .",
    "however , models must be constructed to avoid dispersion in the @xmath0li abundances over a wide range of stellar parameters , which is a real challenge .",
    "the origin of the discrepancy in the li abundance remains a challenging issue .",
    "this work was partially supported by the ec under contract no .",
