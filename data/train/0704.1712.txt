    "quantum entanglement is a form of correlation among quantum systems which can not be described by any classical ( local reality ) theory .",
    "this strange nonlocality in quantum mechanics , which albert einstein called `` spooky action at a distance '' , is now considered to be the key resource for quantum information processing such as quantum computation and quantum cryptography .",
    "it seems quite natural to think of analogies between quantum entanglement and topological entanglement , and some authors actually suggested such analogies @xcite . among them",
    ", we pick up the idea of aravind @xcite in this paper .",
    "he made the correspondence between quantum states and topological links by associating each particle with a ring , and measurement of a particle with cutting of the corresponding ring .",
    "however , there are many possible measurements of a particle , and the correspondence depends on the choice of the measurement .",
    "we reconsider it by using the partial trace of the density matrix instead of the measurement .    in the following , we first review the basics of quantum mechanics for convenience of the readers who are not familiar with quantum mechanics and entanglement",
    ". then we proceed to the discussion on the correspondence between quantum states and links .",
    "in this section we introduce basic concepts and tools of quantum mechanics according to chapter 3 of the text book by nielsen and chuang @xcite .",
    "the mathematical structure of quantum mechanics can be summarized in the following four postulates .",
    "associated to any isolated physical system is a complex vector space with inner product ( that is a hilbert space ) known as the _ state space _ of the system .",
    "the system is completely described by its _ state vector _ , which is a unit vector in the system s state space .",
    "we use the standard quantum mechanical notation @xmath0 to represent a vector , where @xmath1 is a label for the vector .",
    "its dual vector is denoted as @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath3 represents the inner product between the vectors @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "note that the product of the form @xmath6 is regarded as an operator which acts on a vector @xmath7 as @xmath8 .",
    "the evolution of a closed quantum system is described by a _",
    "unitary transformation_.    ideal quantum measurements are described by a collection @xmath9 of _ projection operators _ acting on the state space of the system .",
    "the index @xmath10 refers to the measurement outcomes .",
    "if the state of the quantum system is @xmath5 immediately before the measurement then the probability that result @xmath10 occurs is @xmath11 and the state of the system after the measurement is @xmath12 the projection operators satisfy the relation @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the identity operator , so that the probabilities sum to one .",
    "postulates 3 describes only ideal ( projective ) measurements , but actual measurements are rarely ideal .",
    "therefore some text books including @xcite adopt more general description of measurements from the beginning .",
    "however , general measurements can be represented by combining projective measurements and other postulates of quantum mechanics .",
    "since we use only projective measurements in this paper , we do not include general measurements in postulate 3 for simplicity .",
    "the state space of a composite physical system is the tensor product of the state spaces of the component physical systems .",
    "moreover , if we have systems numbered @xmath15 through @xmath16 , and system number @xmath17 is prepared in the state @xmath18 , then the joint state of the total system is @xmath19 .",
    "we often use abbreviated notations @xmath20 or @xmath21 to denote @xmath22 .    in the following , we consider composite systems consisting of _ qubits_. a qubit ( quantum bit ) is the simplest quantum mechanical system whose state space is two - dimensional .",
    "it is used as a unit of quantum information .",
    "we denote the basis vectors of the two - dimensional hilbert space as @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "the state vector formalism introduced in the last subsection can be used to describe a system whose state is completely specified .",
    "in such a case , the state is called a _ pure state_. in most situations , however , we do not have complete knowledge about the state .",
    "the density operator can be used to describe such a situation .",
    "suppose a quantum system is in one of a number of states @xmath18 , where @xmath17 is an index , with respective probabilities @xmath25 .",
    "the set @xmath26 is called an ensemble of pure states .",
    "the density operator for the system is defined as @xmath27 if @xmath28 for an index @xmath17 and",
    "all other probabilities are zero , the density matrix @xmath29 describes a pure state corresponding to the state vector @xmath18 .",
    "otherwise the density operator @xmath30 represents a _",
    "mixed state_.    in the density operator formalism , time evolution of a quantum system is described by a unitary operator @xmath31 as @xmath32 .",
    "the probability that the result labeled by @xmath10 occurs is @xmath33 , and the the state of the system after the measurement is @xmath34 .",
    "it is easy to check that the density matrix formalism reduces to the state vector formalism when it represents a pure state .",
    "an operator can be regarded as a density operator if and only if it is a positive operator with @xmath35 .",
    "if an operator satisfies this condition , it is obvious that the operator can be written in the form ( [ decomp ] ) , where @xmath25 is an eigenvalues of @xmath30 and @xmath18 is the corresponding eigenvector . therefore @xmath30 is the density operator associated to the ensemble @xmath36 .",
    "note , however , that the correspondence between density operators and ensembles is not one - to - one .",
    "there are infinitely many ensembles corresponding to a density operator .",
    "when we observe only a subsystem of a composite system , the subsystem is described by the reduced density operator .",
    "suppose we have a physical system composed of subsystems a and b , and its state is described by a density operator @xmath37 . the reduced density operator for system a is defined by @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the _ partial trace _ over system b. the partial trace is defined by @xmath40 and @xmath41 ( @xmath42 and @xmath43 ) are any two vectors in the state space of a ( b ) . in addition",
    ", we require the linearity of the partial trace , which completes the specification .",
    "let us consider a pure state of a system composed of subsystems a and b. if the state vector of the system can be written as a tensor product @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) is some state vector of subsystem a ( b ) , the state is called _",
    "separable_. it is known that if a pure state is not separable , there exists a bell - type inequality which is violated by this state @xcite .",
    "it means that the state has a correlation which can not be described by any classical ( local reality ) theory .",
    "such a state is called _",
    "entangled_. for example , it is not difficult to show that the following 2-qubit state @xmath46 can not be written as a tensor product of two single - qubit states . hence this state is entangled .",
    "an mixed state is called separable if it can be decomposed into the following form @xmath47 where @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) is a density matrix of subsystem a ( b ) , @xmath50 and @xmath51 . since @xmath48and @xmath49 can be represented by ensembles of pure states , ( [ sep_def ] ) means that a separable mixed state can be represented by an ensemble of separable pure states .    in this paper , a non - separable mixed state",
    "is called entangled .",
    "note , however , that the definition of entanglement is not so trivial for mixed states .",
    "for example , a separable mixed state satisfies all bell - type inequalities , but the converse does not hold @xcite .    in general , it is a difficult task to determine if a given mixed state is separable or not .",
    "however , there are some simple criteria for 2-qubit systems .",
    "one is peres criterion based on the positivity of the partial transposed density matrix @xcite .",
    "another useful criterion is based on the _ concurrence _",
    "@xcite , which is given by @xmath52 here , @xmath53s are the square roots of the eigenvalues of @xmath54 in decreasing order , where @xmath55 and @xmath56 a state represented by the density operator @xmath30 is separable if and only if @xmath57 .",
    "let us introduce a correspondence between quantum states and and links . in the following , we consider composite systems consisting of qubits , and associate a ring with a qubit",
    ". entangled two qubits are represented by entangled two rings ( fig .",
    "[ 2q_ent ] ) , and separable two qubits are represented by unentangled two rings ( fig .",
    "[ 2q_unent ] ) .",
    "then let us consider 3-qubit systems .",
    "the three qubits are named a , b and c , and the tensor product of the states of three qubits @xmath58 is denoted as @xmath59 , where @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 are labels for the states of a , b and c , respectively .    as the first example , we consider the greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) state @xmath63 and @xmath64 ( or more precisely , @xmath65 and @xmath66 , where @xmath14 is the identity operator for a qubit ) .",
    "since the ghz state is symmetric under permutations of the three qubits , it is enough to consider the measurement of a qubit , say , a. then the state of the system after the measurement is @xmath67 or @xmath68 , both of which are completely separable .",
    "if we associate the measurement with cutting of the corresponding ring , it means that the three rings are separated by cutting only one of the three rings .",
    "it is very nature of the famous borromean rings ( fig .",
    "[ borromean ] ) .",
    "however , there are many possible measurements for a qubit .",
    "for example , let us consider a measurement corresponding to the spin measurement along @xmath69-direction .",
    "the measurement operators are @xmath70 and @xmath71 , where @xmath72 therefore the state after the measurement is @xmath73 or @xmath74 this is a separable mixed state , because it is represented by an ensemble consisting of separable pure states @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "therefore this state corresponds to the borromean rings .",
    "thus we can establish a connection between qubits and rings in a basis - independent way .",
    "the next example is the so - called w state @xmath77 this state also has the permutation symmetry .",
    "if we trace out qubit a , the reduced density matrix is @xmath78 which is not separable .",
    "actually we can show the non - separability by explicit evaluation of the concurrence as follows .",
    "the density matrix @xmath79 and its conjugate @xmath80 can be written in the matrix form as @xmath81 hence @xmath82 therefore @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 , which means that , in contrast to the borromean rings , each pair of rings can not be separated even after the third ring is cut .",
    "this case is modeled by the `` three - hopf rings '' in fig .",
    "[ w ] .",
    "there is yet another type of 3-qubit entanglement .",
    "let us consider the following state @xmath86 with @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "this state does not have the full permutation symmetry , but is symmetric with respect to qubit a and qubit c. if we trace out qubit b , the remaining state is @xmath89 which is separable .",
    "if we trace out qubit a or c , however , the remaining state is still entangled .",
    "for example , if we trace out qubit c , the reduced density operator @xmath37 and its conjugate @xmath90 can be written in the matrix form as @xmath91 hence @xmath92 then we obtain @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 , and hence @xmath96 , which is positive if @xmath97 .",
    "this result means that the state ( [ chain_state ] ) is modeled by the rings of linear - chain type in fig .",
    "[ chain ] .",
    "we have shown some examples of the correspondence between quantum entanglement and topological entanglement for some 3-qubit cases .",
    "it would be interesting to construct such correspondences for systems with more qubits .",
    "for example , aravind argued a correspondence between the generalized ghz state @xmath98 and the generalized borromean rings . although our method does not uniquely determine a topological link corresponding to a quantum state , visualization of quantum states by topological objects could be a useful tool for the study of quantum entanglement ."
