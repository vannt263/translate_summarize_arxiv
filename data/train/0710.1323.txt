    "while studying the transformation properties of @xmath6 under @xmath7 , richard dedekind , in the 1880 s @xcite , naturally arrived at what we today call the _ dedekind sum _",

    "almost a century after the appearance of dedekind sums , leonard carlitz introduced the following polynomial generalization , which we will call a _ dedekind  carlitz polynomial _ : @xmath13 here @xmath1 and @xmath2 are indeterminates and @xmath3 and @xmath4 are positive integers .",
    "undoubtedly the most important basic property for any dedekind - like sum is _",
    "reciprocity_. for the dedekind ",
    "carlitz polynomials , this takes on the following form @xcite .",
    "[ carlitzreciprocity ] if @xmath1 and @xmath2 are indeterminates , and @xmath3 and @xmath4 are relatively prime positive integers , then @xmath14    carlitz s reciprocity theorem generalizes that of dedekind @xcite , which states that for relatively prime positive integers @xmath3 and @xmath4 , @xmath15 dedekind reciprocity follows from theorem  [ carlitzreciprocity ] by applying the operators @xmath16 twice and @xmath17 once to carlitz s reciprocity identity and converting the greatest - integer functions into fractional parts .",
    "our motivation for this paper stems from the appearance of dedekind sums in lattice - point enumerators for rational polyhedra .",
    "the first such instance was discovered by mordell @xcite ( the case @xmath18 in the following theorem ) and vastly generalized by pommersheim @xcite , who laid the foundation for the appearance of dedekind - like sums in _ ehrhart polynomials _",
    "@xmath19 ; here @xmath20 is a lattice @xmath21-polytope ( i.e. , @xmath20 has integral vertices ) and @xmath22 denotes a positive integer .",
    "[ thm.l ] let @xmath23 be the convex hull of @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 , where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are pairwise relatively prime positive integers .",
    "then the ehrhart polynomial of @xmath23 is @xmath30    there are natural geometric interpretations for three of the four coefficients appearing in the ehrhart polynomial of the mordell  pommersheim tetrahedron @xmath23 : the leading coefficient is the volume of @xmath23 , the second leading coefficient equals half of the sum of the areas of the faces of @xmath23 , and the constant term is the euler characteristic of @xmath23 .",
    "( in fact , similar interpretations hold for any @xmath21-dimensional lattice polytope @xcite . )",
    "however , aside from toric varieties attached to @xmath23 @xcite , a geometric reason for the appearance of dedekind sums in the linear term of the ehrhart polynomial in theorem  [ thm.l ] has so far eluded mathematicians . in this paper",
    "we attempt to shed some light on their appearance .",
    "we begin by studying dedekind ",
    "carlitz sums through the generating function attached to the lattice points of a rational polyhedron @xmath31 , namely , the _ integer - point transform _ @xmath32 where @xmath33 .",

    "* we give novel _ geometric _ proofs of theorem  [ carlitzreciprocity ] , some of its generalizations , and some new reciprocity theorems ( sections  [ carlitzrecsection ] and  [ variationssection ] ) .",
    "* we show that our geometric setup immediately implies that ( higher - dimensional ) dedekind  carlitz polynomials can be computed in polynomial time ( section  [ complexitysection ] ) . *",
    "we realize the equivalence of dedekind  carlitz polynomials and the integer - point transform of a two - dimensional analogue of the mordell  pommersheim tetrahedron ( section  [ trianglesection ] ) . *",
    "we give an intrinsic geometric reason why dedekind sums appear in theorem  [ thm.l ] by applying brion s decomposition theorem @xcite to the mordell  pommersheim tetrahedron ( section  [ mordellsection ] ) .",
    "while we believe that this paper constitutes the first fundamental study of carlitz  dedekind sum through a geometric setup , a part of this setup can implicitly be found in papers by solomon @xcite and chapman @xcite on generalized dedekind sums , as well as in @xcite .",
    "we start by decomposing the first quadrant @xmath34 into two cones , namely @xmath35 thus @xmath36 is closed , @xmath37 is half - open , and @xmath34 is the disjoint union of @xmath36 and @xmath37 . let s compute their integer - point transforms . by a simple tiling argument ( see , for example , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter  3 ) ) , @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the _ fundamental parallelogram _ of the cone @xmath36 .",

    "the reciprocity theorem for dedekind ",

    "we have constructed two cones @xmath36 and @xmath37 such that @xmath48 as a disjoint union . in the language of integer - point transforms ,",
    "this means @xmath49 we just computed the rational generating functions on the right - hand side , and the integer - point transform for the first quadrant is simple : @xmath50 .",
    "thus becomes @xmath51 which yields the identity of theorem [ carlitzreciprocity ] after clearing denominators .",
    "our new , geometric proof of carlitz s reciprocity theorem has a natural generalization to higher dimensions , which yields the reciprocity identity for the _ higher - dimensional dedekind ",
    "carlitz polynomials _",
    "@xmath52 where @xmath53 are indeterminates and @xmath54 are positive integers .",

    "[ carlitz reciprocity n - dim ] if @xmath54 are pairwise relatively prime positive integers , then @xmath55    analogous to our proof of theorem [ carlitzreciprocity ] , we construct a single ray in @xmath56-dimensional space , and then we decompose the non - negative orthant into @xmath56 cones as follows .",
    "let @xmath57 , denote the @xmath58 unit vector by @xmath59 , and define @xmath60 the fundamental parallelepiped of @xmath61 is @xmath62 thus a point in @xmath63 will look like @xmath64 and a slice of this parallelepiped at @xmath65 ( where @xmath66 ) will contain @xmath67 as the only integer point .",
    "note also that the integer point @xmath68 is in @xmath63 . combining this information as in section [ carlitzappearssection ]",
    "yields the integer - point transform @xmath69 where @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "since @xmath72 is a disjoint union of the nonnegative @xmath56-dimensional orthant , @xmath73 theorem [ carlitz reciprocity n - dim ] follows upon clearing denominators in this identity .    to virtually every theorem in this paper , there exist translate companions , i.e. , we can shift the cones involved in our proofs by a fixed vector .",
    "this gives rise to shifts in the greatest - integer functions , and the resulting carlitz sums are polynomial analogues of _ dedekind  rademacher sums _",
    "for the sake of clarity of exposition , we only give integer - vertex versions of our cones , but the reader should keep in mind that arbitrary vertices do , in principal , not cause any additional problems .",

    "the integer - point transform @xmath77 of a rational polyhedron @xmath20 can be computed as a sum of rational functions in @xmath78 in time polynomial in the input size of @xmath20 .",
    "note that barvinok s theorem says , in particular , that the rational functions whose sum represents @xmath79 are _ short _ , i.e. , the set of data needed to output this sum of rational functions is of size that is polynomial in the input size of @xmath20 .",
    "the application of barvinok s theorem to any of the cones appearing in the proof of theorem  [ carlitz reciprocity n - dim ] immediately yields the following novel complexity result .",
    "[ carcomplexity ] for fixed @xmath56 , the higher - dimensional dedekind ",

    "in particular , this result says that there is a more economical way to write the  long \" polynomial @xmath80 as a short sum of rational functions .",
    "theorem  [ carcomplexity ] implies that any dedekind - like sum that can be efficiently derived from dedekind  carlitz polynomials ( e.g. , by applying differential operators ) can also be computed efficiently .",
    "the geometry we have used so far is very simple : it is based on one ray in space .",
    "naturally , this can be extended in numerous ways .",
    "to illustrate one of them , consider two rays through the points @xmath81 and @xmath82 in the first quadrant of the plane , where @xmath83 are positive integers .",
