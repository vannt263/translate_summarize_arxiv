    "the number of known exoplanets has now well exceeded 500 , revealing a large diversity in both planetary properties and orbital characteristics . in the early days of exoplanet discoveries ,",
    "one of the first surprises was that of very short - period planets , the so - called hot jupiters .",
    "studies have been undertaken which attempt to find star ",
    "planet interactions between these hot jupiters and their host stars , and correlations of stellar activity with planetary emission spectra @xcite and surface gravities @xcite have been detected .",
    "evidence has also been found for a general increase in chromospheric activity of stars which harbor short - period planets @xcite and surveys have been undertaken which evaluate such activity in potential planet search targets @xcite .",
    "most of these effects are caused by interactions between coronal magnetic fields and the magnetospheres of the close - in planets @xcite .",
    "searches for observable signatures of such interactions have been undertaken for hd  189733 @xcite and corot-6 @xcite but the evidence has been inconclusive .",
    "@xcite observed synchronicity of the ca ii h and k emission for both hd  179949 and @xmath0  and with the rotation of their respective short - period planets , likely due to interactions with the stellar magnetic fields .",
    "the 2.82  day period planet orbiting hd  63454 ( hip  37284 , tyc  9385 - 1045 - 1 ) was first detected by @xcite using radial velocity data obtained with the high - accuracy radial - velocity planet searcher ( harps ) mounted on the eso 3.6 m telescope .",
    "the host star is a relatively young ( @xmath1  gyr ) late - type ( k4v ) star .",
    "the activity indicators in the discovery data show that the star is active and they report radial velocity jitter which is attributed to the stellar activity . since the star is young , it is predicted to have a relatively short rotation period of @xmath2  days .",
    "this star is extremely southern in declination ( @xmath3 ) and so follow - up observations of the system have been minimal since the planet s discovery .    here",
    "we present the results of photometrically monitoring hd  63454 as part of the transit ephemeris refinement and monitoring survey ( terms ; @xcite ) .",
    "the star was observed over a two week period in order to extract variability properties of the star .",
    "in particular , we are interested in variability that may correspond with the radial velocity jitter and/or the influence of the planet on the star .",
    "we find no evidence of such correlations which places limits on the causation of stellar activity due to the interactions of the planet .",
    "we present additional harps data which refines the period and redetermines the phase of the planet .",
    "we subsequently monitored transit windows which confirms that this planet does not transit the host star . with such a small orbital period",
    ", we use this result to place a lower limit on the mass of the planet and an upper limit on the radius of the planet .",
    "the original discovery of hd  63454b presented by @xcite included 26 radial velocity measurements acquired using the harps instrument and were subject to an additional analysis by @xcite .",
    "here we present 8 additional measurements from harps acquired since then which have been used to refine the orbital parameters and redetermine the phase of this planet .",

    "using the polynomial relations of @xcite , we derive revised stellar parameters of @xmath12 and @xmath13 for hd  63454 .",
    "we fit a single - planet keplerian solution to the rv data using the techniques described in @xcite and the partially linearized , least - squares fitting procedure described in @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of a linear trend to the solution reduced the @xmath14 from 30.68 to 10.14 and the rms of the residuals from 10.87 to 6.84 ms@xmath15 .",
    "while an offset between the bulk of the data and the final two measurements of @xmath16  ms@xmath15 would produce comparable reduction in the @xmath14 , harps is known to be extremely stable and such an offset is not considered plausible .",
    "this leads us to favour the solution which includes a trend .",

    "we estimate the planetary radius using the models of @xcite to be @xmath33 .",
    "this results in a predicted transit probability of 14.3% , a depth of 1.2% , and a transit duration of 0.13  days .",
    "a preliminary search by @xcite found no evidence for transits of this planet .",
    "in figure [ rvmodel ] we include a shaded region which indicates the calculated size of the transit window @xcite at the time of acquiring our photometry .",
    "this is described further in section [ transit ] where we present re - phased photometry which places limits on transits and the inclination or size of the planet .",
    "we investigated the low - frequency photometric stability of hd  63454 using observations from the _ hipparcos _ satellite .",
    "_ hipparcos _ observed the star during its three - year mission and acquired a photometric data set consisting of 124 measurements spanning a period of 1180 days @xcite , shown in figure [ phot_hip ] .",
    "the 1@xmath34 rms scatter of the 124 hd  63454 measurements is 0.031 mag , while the mean of the measurement uncertainties is 0.019 .",
    "the scatter is roughly 50% higher than the expected uncertainty of a single observation , but the range , 0.345 mag , is significantly more than that expected from a constant star .",
    "consequently , the _ hipparcos _ catalogue described by @xcite lists the variability type for hd  63454 as a blank , indicating that the star `` could not be classified as variable or constant . '' we performed a fourier analysis of the _ hipparcos _ data and do not detect any significant periodic variability .",
    "however , this only rules out activity above the 3% level . additionally , the nyquist frequency of the data is 0.0525  days@xmath15 which is slightly above the predicted frequency of the stellar rotation , thus resulting in substantial aliasing at smaller periods .",
    "the strongest peaks in the periodogram occur at 0.25 and 0.27 days but the power of these peaks are very low .",
    "observations of hd  63454 were carried out at the cerro tololo inter - american observatory ( ctio ) 1.0 m telescope using the y4kcam detector , which is a 4k@xmath354k ccd with a field of view of about 20 arcminutes on the side . the target was observed along with three comparison stars with a johnson @xmath36 band filter for 8 nights during the period 2230 january 2011 .",
    "an additional night of data was acquired using this telescope on the night of 5 april 2011 in order to complete phase coverage of the transit window ( see section [ transit ] ) .",
    "the brightness of the target ( @xmath37 ) led to exposure times of 812 seconds , high enough to eliminate the effects of shutter errors . the principal target and comparison stars",
    "were carefully placed on cosmetically clean regions of the ccd and kept in exactly the same place during the monitoring sequences to avoid inter - pixel sensitivities .",
    "the target star hd  63454 is known in the 2mass catalog as 2mass  j07392187 - 7816442 @xcite .",
    "there is a nearby fainter star 6.14 arcsecs away ( 2mass  j07391989 - 7816428 ) for which the @xmath38 magnitudes are 10.636 , 12.523 , and 12.350 respectively . according to the photometric quality flags of the 2mass catalog , the @xmath39 value represents an upper limit on the magnitude ( i.e.",
    ", represents a minimum brightness for the star ) .",
    "the @xmath40 value of 0.173 means the star is an early m star if on the main sequence .",
    "aperture photometry was performed on each star by extracting small regions from the image , @xmath41  100 pixels from the estimated center of the stellar point - spread function ( psf ) .",
    "the size of the photometric aperture was limited to restrict light contamination from the nearby star which was particularly important during nights of bad seeing which may cause the psf to spread further into the aperture . to achieve sufficient precision to detect low - amplitude variability including transit signals , we performed relative photometry using the methods described in @xcite .",
    "the resulting photometry were binned into equal time intervals of 5 minutes each and are shown in the top panel of figure [ phot_ctio ] . for most nights",
    "the 1@xmath34 rms was less than 3 millimags , but the combined dataset has a 1@xmath34 rms of 3.4 millimags .",
    "here we describe an analysis of the photometry for the purposes of studying the stability of the star .",
    "to investigate the high - frequency variability of hd  63454 , we used a weighted lomb - scargle ( l - s ) fourier analysis , similar to that described by @xcite .",
    "in particular , we are interested in activity related to the magnetic cycle and interactions of the magnetic field and chromosphere with the planet on the short timescales of its orbital period .",
    "investigation of the line bisector inverse slope by @xcite found no correlation with the orbital period . in the bottom - left panel of figure [ phot_ctio ]",
    "we show the complete ctio dataset folded on the orbital period from table [ fitparams ] .",
    "phase zero in this figure is the location of the predicted transit time of the planet .",
    "cc +   &   +    as described by @xcite , aliases in periodograms result from discrete sampling times which occur to a lesser degree with unevenly sampled data .",
    "the periodogram of the january 2011 photometry is shown in the bottom - right panel of figure [ phot_ctio ] .",
    "there are significant aliases at periods less than 1 day which are harmonics of the observing schedule , such as 0.20 , 0.26 , 0.60 , and 1.50 days . of note",
    "is the strongest peak located at 0.26 days since this lies between the two strongest peaks located in the hipparcos data ( see section [ hipparcos ] ) .",
    "this is assumed to be the result of the cadence and resulting nyquist frequency in each dataset , but we note it here as a possible indicator of low - amplitude high - frequency activity .",
    "observations each night lasted @xmath42  days which results in broadening of the peaks in the spectral window function and a double peak at 0.35 and 0.37 days .",
    "the strongest feature in the periodogram beyond a period of 1.5 days is a peak located at 2.90  days .",
    "although tantalizingly close to the measured orbital period of 2.82  days , the broadness of the peak and strength of the signal are inconclusive as to a planetary origin , particularly when it is equally close to an expected alias at 3.00 days . by way of contrast , the magnetic activity in corot-6 exhibits a photometric variation with a period of 6.4 days and an amplitude of 2.7% @xcite .",
    "we thus conclude that the star is stable at the 3 millimag level over both stellar rotation and planetary orbital timescales .    for short - period planets , the orbit may be inside the magnetic field of the host star in which case an electric field is generated by the interaction of the stellar and planetary magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "the planet orbiting hd  63454 is at a separation of 7.5  @xmath43 which , for the relatively young k dwarf ( @xmath1  gyr ) , may place it inside the stellar magnetosphere given the expected rotation period .",
    "thus , an additional test would be to attempt the detection of a time variable radio flux emission from the star ",
    "planet interaction as was performed for hd  189733b by @xcite .",
    "@xcite state that their photometry `` showed no planetary transit '' although they do not present the photometry or the precision of the measurements . here",
    "we present our photometry acquired during transit windows based upon the revised orbital parameters and ephemeris and discuss limits on the implied properties of the planet and orbital inclination . to demonstrate the importance of refining orbital parameters , the observations during the january ctio run",
    "were designed to cover two transit windows based upon the orbital parameters of @xcite . however , the orbital fit to the updated harps data shifted the predicted windows into the observing gaps in orbital phase , thus necessitating the additional night of data in april .",
    "extent of the transit window.,width=309 ]    figure [ tranphot ] shows a zoomed - in version of the lower - left panel of figure [ phot_ctio ] , where the data once again has been phased on a zero - point which is the location of the predicted transit mid - point .",
    "the vertical dashed lines indicate the 1@xmath34 extent of the transit window which is the predicted duration plus twice the transit mid - point uncertainty ( see section [ keplerian ] ) . in this case",
    ", the transit window size is evenly split between the duration and mid - point uncertainty yielding a total transit window size of 0.26  days  @xmath44  0.094 orbital phase .",
    "we calculated the predicted transit signature based upon the analytic models of @xcite , overplotted as a solid line in the figure .",
    "the conditions on the observing night in april 2011 were exceptional which produced the photometry that dominates the right - hand side of figure [ tranphot ] .",
    "the scatter in these data is larger than what is expected from photon counting statistics .",
    "this excess may be due to the nearby faint star but is more likely due to stellar photometric variations .",
    "the photometry for that night has a 1@xmath34 rms scatter of 2.3 millimags .",
    "the predicted transit depth ( 1.2% ) is therefore ruled out at the 5.4@xmath34 level .",
    "this means that , for a non - transiting planet , the orbital inclination of the planet is restricted to @xmath45 which results in a lower limit of the planetary mass of @xmath46 . on the other hand ,",
    "if the planet does transit then the photometric precision rules out planetary radii of @xmath47 .",
    "a radius just below this threshold would yield a density of 1.16  g  @xmath48 , resulting in the planet having remarkably similar properties to the large - cored planet hd  149026b @xcite , both in terms of orbital parameters and planetary characteristics .",
    "understanding the star  planet interaction for systems with hot jupiters presents an opportunity to further characterize these planets , particularly for transiting exoplanets where both the mass and radius of the planet are known .",
    "detection of magnetic field interactions would yield insight into the internal structure and rotation rate of these planets .",
    "the study of hd  63454 presented here was conducted as part of the transit ephemeris refinement and monitoring survey ( terms ) in order to detect or rule out both stellar variability and transit signatures due to the presence of the planet which has 14% transit probability and a predicted transit depth of 1.2% .",
    "this study includes new harps radial velocity data in order to redetermine the phase of the planet during times of photometric monitoring .",
    "the requirement for additional photometry in order to rule out a transit based upon the revised orbital parameters demonstrates the need for careful examination of the planetary phase when monitoring predicted transit windows .",
    "the _ hipparcos _",
    "photometry reveals no long - term variability of the star , although the sampling frequency and photometric precision are inadequate to detect periodicity related to the rotational timescale .",
    "the lack of high - frequency variability at the 3  millimag level may indicate that the planet is ( a ) outside the magnetosphere of the star , or ( b ) the planetary magnetosphere is very small , or ( c ) the interaction of the planetary magnetosphere bow shock with the stellar magnetic field is best detected at either higher precision or longer wavelengths ( radio ) .",
    "the lack of a transit signature detection indicates that either the mass of the planet is larger than 0.402  @xmath49 or that the radius is less than 0.77  @xmath50 . in the case of the latter ,",
    "this would imply that the planet has very similar properties to hd  149026b .",
