    "in the last years , all sorts of phenomenological equations of state ( eos ) , relativistic and non - relativistic ones , have been used to describe ( proto)neutron star matter .",
    "these eos are parameter dependent and are adjusted so as to reproduce nuclear matter bulk properties , as the binding energy at the correct saturation density and incompressibility as well as ground state properties of some nuclei and their collective responses @xcite .",
    "attempts to constrain the eos have been made and they were based either on finite nuclei experimental results , as for instance , the isoscalar monopole and the isovector dipole giant resonances @xcite and neutron skin thickness @xcite or on astrophysical observations @xcite . until 2010 ,",
    "when a star with a mass of almost 2 @xmath1 was confirmed @xcite , most eos were expected to produce maximum stellar masses just larger than 1.44 @xmath1 and radii of the order of 10 to 12 km .",
    "some of them , as the nl3 parametrization @xcite of the non - linear walecka model ( nlwm ) were even discarded to be considered too hard and to provide too large solar masses .",
    "recently a second very massive neutron star was detected @xcite and many parametrizations and models were revisited and readjusted to account for the new observations .",
    "also , many other constraints based on the above mentioned nuclear properties and also on the symmetry energy , its slope , skewness , dipole polarizabilities , heavy - ion collision flows , isobaric analog states , etc , have been proposed @xcite .",
    "as far as relativistic models are concerned , the @xmath0 interaction @xcite can be adjusted to reproduce experimental values of the symmetry energy and its related slope , the latest being strongly correlated with many nuclear @xcite and stellar properties @xcite .    on the other hand",
    ", it is well known that the eos and the internal constitution of the neutron stars depend on the nature of the strong interaction . in a compact star ,",
    "strangeness may occur in the form of baryons , such as @xmath2 and @xmath3 hyperons , as a bose condensate i.e. @xmath4 meson condensate , or in the form of strange quarks , in all cases influencing the star structure and its macroscopic properties @xcite .",
    "some years ago , it was suggested that above some critical density , the ground state of baryonic matter might contain a bose - einstein condensate of negatively charged kaons @xcite as far as a pion condensate also exists . in @xcite , another mechanism that allowed kaon condensation without pion condensation",
    "was proposed for the first time .",
    "there is a strong attraction between @xmath4 mesons and baryons which increases with density and lowers the energy of the zero momentum state .",
    "a condensate is formed when this energy equals the kaon chemical potential @xmath5 .",
    "when the electron chemical potential equals the effective kaon mass , the kaons are favored because they help in the conservation of charge neutrality once they are bosons and can condense in the lowest energy state .",
    "for this reason @xmath4 mesons that have the same electric charge as electrons , are the type of kaons that normally appear in a condensed state in stars .",
    "it is well known that the onset of the kaon condensation is model dependent and varies according to the strength of the kaon optical potential @xcite . in the present work",
    ", we revisit the possibility that a hybrid compact star can be constituted by hadrons and kaon condensed matter at higher densities @xcite by using the quark meson coupling ( qmc ) model at finite temperature @xcite with the inclusion of the @xmath0 interaction @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of this non - linear interaction was shown to soften the symmetry energy at high densities and to bring the qmc model properties closer to density dependent relativistic models @xcite . as the inclusion of this term allows us to tune the slope of the symmetry energy , shown to be strongly correlated with some star properties",
    ", it is an important ingredient in the investigation that follows . in a previous work",
    "@xcite a discussion on the onset of kaons and antikaons controlled by stiff and soft symmetry energy and eos was performed at zero temperature with four kinds of models : a standard relativistic mean field one , a density dependent model , a model with the @xmath0 interaction and a model with higher order coupling constants . it was found that although the last two models bear quite different symmetry energies , they yield very similar star masses and radii . in @xcite , it was seen that the effects of kaon condensation on metastable stars can be quite dramatic resulting in different neutrino emission signals .",
    "hence , for a better understanding of the role played by kaons inside a star , we use two different models , the qmc and the gm1 @xcite parametrization of the nlwm for three values of fixed entropies that correspond to different snapshots of the star evolution and discuss the effect of the symmetry energy .",
    "the properties of the stars are also studied .    in the qmc model ,",
    "nucleons are described as a system of nonoverlapping mit bags that interact through the scalar and vector mesons .",
    "the quark degrees of freedom are explicitly taken into account and the couplings are determined at the quark level . in the present work we also treat the kaons as mit bags @xcite and the couplings of the kaons with nucleons are determined in a self - consistent way .    in section",
    "ii , we discuss the formalism employed in finite temperature calculations . in section",
    "iii we present and discuss our results and compare them with the gm1 parametrization of the non - linear walecka model @xcite . for this comparison , in view of the fact that the symmetry energy slope regulates some physical properties ,",
    "it was chosen to be similar in both models . in the final section ,",
    "we draw our conclusions .",
    "in the qmc model , the nucleon in nuclear medium is assumed to be a static spherical mit bag in which quarks interact with the scalar @xmath6 and vector @xmath7 fields , and those are treated as classical fields in the mean - field approximation ( mfa ) .",

    "the energy of a static baryon bag consisting of three ground state quarks can be expressed as @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the parameter that accounts for zero point motion and @xmath37 is the bag constant .",

    "we next obtain the thermodynamic potential within the mean field approximation and perform a calculation similar to that carried out in @xcite .",
    "we assume that the kaons are described by the static mit bag in the same way as the nucleons .",

    "both models have a similar symmetry energy and corresponding slope at the saturation denstiy . including the @xmath128 term we build other eos from these models by changing the symmetry energy slope at saturation and keeping fixed the symmetry energy as 21.74 mev at @xmath129 @xmath130 . for each model , qmc and gm1 ,",
    "we have fixed three different values of the slope @xmath131 , roughly the same for both models , namely @xmath132 mev . with a similar behavior of the symmetry energy at saturation",
    ", we can discuss how the other properties of the eos affect the properties of neutron stars containing a kaon condensate . in table",
    "[ table0 ] we display the @xmath131 values and the related @xmath133 and @xmath134 for the models we investigate .",
    ".[table0 ] symmetry energy , its slope and related model parameters . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we also see , from fig . [ fig6 ] that the temperature values are somewhat similar , but still slightly larger for the smaller @xmath131 values if @xmath135 . in matter with larger values of @xmath131",
    "the number of neutrons and protons is closer , which correspons to a smaller temperature if we fix the entropy .",
    "no @xmath131 differences are seen in matter with @xmath136 , because in this case the entropy has an important contribution from neutrinos due to their almost zero mass .",
    "once the eos are determined , we use them as input in the tov equations to obtain the stellar macroscopic properties , which are shown in table [ table1 ] and figs .",
    "[ fig7 ] and [ fig8 ] .",
    "the result for @xmath137 mev is added only for completeness .",
    "the maximum masses for the cases with fixed entropy do not show a clear behaviour with the slope , but for a stable zero temperature system , they tend to decrease with the decrease of the slope for both models .",
    "if the slope @xmath131 is small the trend may invert due to two competing effects : a ) a smaller slope @xmath131 means a softer eos and , therefore , smaller maximum masses ; b ) however the onset of kaons for a softer eos occurs at larger densities , as seen from table [ table1 ] from the central energy densities of the threshold stars for the kaon onset . as a result stars obtained from an eos with larger @xmath131 contain larger amounts of kaons , which soften the eos . therefore",
    ", decreasing @xmath131 reduces the maximum star mass until a critical value of @xmath131 when the onset of kaons is shifted to much larger densities so that the overall softening due to the kaon fraction becomes negligeable .",
    "@xmath138 mev is one of these critical values of the slope .",
    "this effect is present in both gm1 and qmc and for cold and warm stars .",
    "a comment should also be done concerning the differences of maximum masses with @xmath131 . within the qmc",
    "the maximum mass diference is quite small , in fact not larger than @xmath139 m@xmath140 except for the @xmath135 , @xmath141 mev case , when the much larger mass is due to the non existing kaon condensation in the star , since only thermal kaons are present . within gm1 the differences are larger , but the main considerations above remain valid .",
    "the difference in this case is the fact that the nucleonic gm1 eos is harder than qmc at intermediate densities .",
    "the star radii , on the other hand , decrease with the decrease of the slope , see fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , as already seen in @xcite for different parametrizations of the nlwm ( excluding iu - fsu ) . in these figures",
    "the black dots indicate the onset of thermal kaons , which occurs for quite massive stars .",
    "therefore , we may state that the radius difference between the families of stars is mainly due to the different behavior of the symmetry energy with density and not to the presence of the kaons . according to @xcite",
    ", the radii of canonical @xmath142 neutron stars should lie within the range 9.7 - 13.9 @xmath143 . in table",
    "[ table1 ] we show our results for these canonical stars and see that , except for the @xmath144 case , a star which is not stable , our results fall inside the expected range . on the other hand ,",
    "other two different analyses of five quiescent low - mass x - ray binaries in globular clusters were performed to establish possible neutron star radii ranges . in the first analysis @xcite ,",
    "all neutron stars were assumed to have the same radii in the range @xmath145 .",
    "the second calculation @xcite , based on a bayesian analysis , estimates that neutron stars radii should lie in between 10.9 and 12.7 km .",
    "it is important to have in mind that measurement and assessment of neutron star radii still remain to be better understood , but if the above mentioned constraints are to be validated , our results would only be in accordance with the second analysis .",
    "the kaon onset energy density increases with decreasing @xmath131 as alreay referred , see @xmath146 in table [ table1 ] . however , since the existence of kaons softens the eos , the kaon threshold star mass is generally smaller for the smaller @xmath131 .",
    "notice that both models , even with the inclusion of kaons and the @xmath0 interaction , known to soften the eos , may account for the description of very massive stars .    in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] we display , both for the qmc and gm1 models and two values of the symmetry energy slope , the baryonic versus gravitacional masses for stars at different snapshots of their lives @xcite : a ) immediatly after the core bounce with trapped neutrinos @xmath136 and fixed lepton fraction @xmath114 ; b ) after neutrino diffusion @xmath147 and core heating due to deleptonization .",
    "the maximum entropy per baryon @xmath135 is attained at @xmath148 s ; c ) after core cooling with @xmath149 and @xmath147 .",
    "if no accretion occurs during the cooling process the transition between the different stages occurs at constant baryonic mass , i.e. along vertical lines @xcite .",
    "we identify with a full black dot and a red asterisk , respectively , the minimal configuration with a kaon condensate in the centar and with a fraction of at least 10@xmath150 of kaons .    some configurations obtained for @xmath135 and neutrino - free matter can not be populated since their baryonic mass is larger than the maximum baryonic mass obtained with @xmath136 and trapped neutrinos . in particular , all stars with @xmath151 for @xmath135 and @xmath141 mev belong to this set of stars .",
    "it is also seen that within the qmc model ( but not gm1 ) it may occur that a star has a kaon condensate in its center during the neutrino trapped phase .",
    "after the neutrinos diffuse out the condensate melts and finally it is once more formed after cooling .",
    "these transformations should result in neutrino signals after the supernova explosion and before the cooling of the star .",
    "some conclusions are in order : a ) from both fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] and table [ table1 ] we conclude that for @xmath141 mev no blackhole will be formed during the cooling process since the maximum baryonic mass at @xmath136 and @xmath114 is not larger than the maximum baryonic mass at @xmath149 .",
    "this is not the case for gm1 .",
    "this model predicts the formation of low mass backhole during cooling ; b ) decreasing the symmetry energy slope @xmath131 may modify some of the above conclusions .",
    "in particular , for @xmath152 ( but not anymore for 59 mev ) within qmc there is a small range of star configurations ( @xmath153 ) that will decay to a blackhole during cooling . within gm1",
    "the number of star configurations that decay into blackholes increases when @xmath131 goes from 93 to 70 mev , but decreases if @xmath131 is further reduced to 59 mev .",
    "this is due the smaller kaon content in these last stars together with a central density that is not much larger ; c ) the cooling of the stars that contain a kaon condensate , in same cases , involves the melting of the condensate at an intermediate stage ( @xmath135 ) and a second formation of the condensate at @xmath154 .",
    "we should point out that we are studying the evolution of the stars without considering finite size effects as in @xcite . in the present calculation",
    "the kaon potential is not strong enough to give rise to a first order phase transtion , and corresponds to a second order phase transition .",
    "in the present work we have revisited the qmc model at finite temperature to investigate the thermal kaon effects on stellar properties . the @xmath0 interaction was included because it softens the very hard qmc symmetry energy at high densities and can be used to tune the values of the slope of the symmetry energy . as had already been seen in @xcite , lower values of the slope",
    "yield smaller amounts of strangeness if hyperons are considered for a given density .",
    "the same conclusion is here obtained if kaons are the carriers of strangeness instead of the hyperons .    as compared with the results obtained with the gm1 parametrization of the nlwm ,",
    "the qmc eos is generally softer , the only exception being the @xmath135 case for @xmath155 mev ( see table [ table1 ] ) , which is due to the fact that no kaon condensate is formed because the central temperatures of the star lie above the melting temperature of the condensate .",
    "a softer eos at intermediate densities implies a smaller amount of kaons and as a consequence within qmc no black - hole formation is expected during the cooling of the a protoneutron star with a kaon condensate in the core , if @xmath131 is large enough . for smaller values of @xmath131 , but not too small , the set of stars that could cool to a black - hole is very reduced and certainly much smaller than what is expected with gm1 .    it is interesting to identify the role of the density dependence of the symmetry energy on the possible evolution of a compact star with a kaon condensate . within qmc no black - hole",
    "is formed either if @xmath131 is large or @xmath131 small .",
    "this is due to the balance between the softening of the eos when @xmath131 is smaller , together with a less pronounced softening of the eos because less kaons are formed . within gm1",
    "there are always a quite large set of stars that cool to a black - hole , although this set is larger for intermediate values of @xmath131 .",
    "we have also shown that the complex evolution of the star may include the melting and formation of a new kaon condensate .",
    "the first transformation is driven by the neutrino diffusion and the second is due to cooling .",
    "these processes could be responsible for a neutrino signal followed by a gamma ray burst after the supernova explosion .",
    "finally , we point out that both models can describe very massive stars , namely stars as massive as the pulsars psr j16142230 @xcite and psr j0348 + 0432 @xcite .",

    "<S> in this work we investigate protoneutron star properties within a modified version of the quark coupling model ( qmc ) that incorporates a @xmath0 interaction plus kaon condensed matter at finite temperature . </S>",
    "<S> fixed entropy and trapped neutrinos are taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> our results are compared with the ones obtained with the gm1 parametrization of the non - linear walecka model for similar values of the symmetry energy slope . </S>",
    "<S> contrary to gm1 , within the qmc the formation of low mass black - holes during cooling are not probable . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the evolution of the protoneutron star may include the melting of the kaon condensate driven by the neutrino diffusion , followed by the formation of a second condensate after cooling . </S>",
    "<S> the signature of this complex proccess could be a neutrino signal followed by a gamma ray burst . </S>",
    "<S> we have seen that both models can , in general , describe very massive stars . </S>"
