    "the measurement of spin observables in hadronic exclusive processes is the only way to obtain the full knowledge on the corresponding set of scattering amplitudes , and in particular , their relative size and phase difference . taking the specific case of proton - proton elastic scattering",
    ", a reconstruction of the five amplitudes has been worked out in the low - energy domain @xcite .",
    "this situation is very different at high energy ; due to the lack of data , in the range @xmath2 100 - 300 gev , besides the non - flip hadronic amplitude @xmath3 , only the hadronic helicity - flip amplitude @xmath4 is known and to a rather poor level of accuracy .",
    "the advent of the bnl - rhic @xmath1 collider , where the two proton beams can be polarized , longitudinally and transversely , up to an energy @xmath5 , offers a unique opportunity to measure single- and double - spin observables , and thus to provide the determination of the spin - dependent amplitudes , which remain unknown so far .    for instance , for an elastic collision of transversely polarized protons , the differential cross section as a function of the momentum transfer @xmath6 and the azimuthal angle @xmath7 , reads @xmath8~ , \\label{anexp}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the beam polarizations , @xmath0 the analyzing power and @xmath11 , @xmath12 are double spin asymmetries ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for definitions ) . in this expression ,",
    "the values of the beam polarizations have to be known accurately in order to reduce the errors on the spin asymmetries .",
    "so new measurements are indeed required to achieve an amplitude analysis of @xmath1 elastic scattering at high energy , and the success of the vast bnl - rhic spin programme @xcite also relies heavily on the precise determination of the beam polarizations .",
    "one possibility for an absolute polarimeter is provided by the measurement of the analyzing power @xmath0 , in the very forward @xmath13 region , where significant coulomb nuclear interference ( cni ) occurs @xcite .    in the calculation of the analyzing power an important question",
    "arises : is the interference fully dominated by the hadronic non - flip amplitude with the one - photon exchange helicity - flip amplitude or must one also take into account the contribution of the hadronic helicity - flip amplitude @xmath4 , mentioned above ?",
    "several arguments concerning the magnitude and phase of @xmath4 in the small @xmath6-region , have been discussed in great detail in ref .",
    "@xcite and it was concluded that the measurement of @xmath0 in the cni region was badly needed to get the answer . the purpose of this paper is to study this problem in the framework of the impact picture developed almost three decades ago @xcite , which has led to a very successful phenomenology , repeatedly verified by high - energy experiments , including near the forward direction .",
    "forward scattering amplitude is a real challenge for the lhc @xcite . ]",
    "in the impact picture , the spin - independent hadronic amplitude @xmath14 for @xmath15 and @xmath16 elastic scattering reads as @xcite @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the momentum transfer ( @xmath19 ) and @xmath20 is the opaqueness at impact parameter @xmath21 and at a given energy @xmath22 .",
    "we take @xmath23 here the first term is associated with the pomeron exchange , which generates the diffractive component of the scattering and the second term is the regge background .",
    "the pomeron energy dependence is given by the crossing symmetric expression @xcite @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the third mandelstam variable .",
    "the choice one makes for @xmath26 is crucial and , as explained in ref .",
    "@xcite , we take the bessel transform of @xmath27 ^ 2~{a^2 + t \\over a^2 -t } ~.\\ ] ] here @xmath28 stands for the proton electromagnetic form factor , parametrized as @xmath29 the slowly varying function occurring in eq .",
    "( [ formf ] ) reflects the approximate proportionality between the charge density and the hadronic matter distribution inside a proton @xcite .",
    "so the pomeron part of the amplitude depends on only _ six _ parameters @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "the asymptotic energy regime of hadronic interactions are controlled by @xmath32 and @xmath33 , which will be kept , for all elastic reactions , at the values obtained in 1984 @xcite , namely @xmath34 the remaining four parameters are related , more specifically to the reaction @xmath1 ( @xmath16 ) and they have been fitted in @xcite by the use of a large set of elastic data .",
    "we now turn to the regge background .",
    "a generic regge exchange amplitude has an expression of the form @xmath35 [ \\frac{s}{s_0}]^{\\alpha_i(t ) } \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath36 is the regge residue , @xmath37 refers to an even- or odd - signature exchange , @xmath38 , is a standard linear regge trajectory and @xmath39gev@xmath40 . if @xmath41 is the sum over all the allowed regge trajectories , the regge background @xmath42 in eq .",
    "( [ opac ] ) is the bessel transform of @xmath43 . in @xmath1 ( @xmath16 ) elastic scattering ,",
    "the allowed regge exchanges are @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , so the regge background involves several additional parameters , which are given in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in earlier work , spin - dependent hadronic amplitudes were implemented @xcite , using the notion of rotating matter inside the proton , which allowed us to describe the polarizations and spin correlation parameters , but for the present purpose hadronic spin - dependent amplitudes will be ignored . in order to describe the very small @xmath6-region we are interested in",

    "the analyzing power @xmath0 has been measured at high energy for @xmath52 , but before turning to the calculation of this quantity , it is necessary to look at the predictions for the differential cross section , at the corresponding energies .",
    "they are given in the upper plot in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] and compared with the available experimental results at @xmath53 = 13.7 and 19.4  gev .",
    "we underestimate a bit the data for high @xmath6-values , at @xmath54 , which might indicate the presence of a small hadronic spin - dependent amplitude . however , this is not the case at @xmath55 , where the agreement is excellent , as shown in the lower plot in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "note that the momentum transfer runs over four decades and the cross section over eleven orders of magnitude , which is a good illustration of the validity of the impact picture . concerning the energy @xmath56",
    ", we can not make a detailed comparison with the data .",
    "the pp2pp experiment @xcite has only determined the slope of the cross section for @xmath57 , which is @xmath58 , consistent with the average value obtained in the impact picture , namely @xmath59 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] , we compare the predictions with the data , for @xmath0 in the cni region versus @xmath13 , for three different energies and let us make the following remarks . first , there is almost no energy dependence between @xmath53 = 13.7 and 19.4 gev , but the curve has a slightly different shape at @xmath53 = 200 gev .",
    "second , although this is not obvious from the plot , @xmath0 does not vanish for @xmath60 and we would like to stress that for @xmath1 elastic scattering at high energy , in the dip region , the hadronic and the coulomb amplitudes are of the same order of magnitude @xcite , so the behavior of spin observables is sensitive to this interference . finally , indeed the predictions agree well with the present experimental data and in view of future data taking in the bnl - rhic spin programme , we display in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] some predictions at @xmath53 = 62.4 gev and @xmath53 = 500 gev .",
    "when the energy increases the maximum of @xmath0 decreases and occurs at a lower @xmath6 value , which clearly reflects the rise of the total cross section @xcite .",
    "the above discussion shows that the hadronic spin - flip amplitude is not necessary to describe the analyzing power , at least when compared with the data with the present day accuracy .",
    "a similar conclusion was obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite , which contains the best data sample so far .",
    "note that their analysis , based on ref .",
    "@xcite , was done using a simple model for @xmath61 and they did nt introduce the full expressions for the coulomb amplitudes @xmath62 , as we do here for consistency . + before going to the conclusion , it is worth mentioning some very recent data at @xmath53 = 6.7 gev @xcite , with a statistically limited accuracy , which might indicate the existence of a non - zero @xmath63 .",
    "however this energy is too low to allow a simple theoretical interpretation of @xmath63 in terms of a non - zero pomeron flip coupling and would require a more elaborated phenomenological analysis , including dominant regge contributions .    predictions for the analyzing power @xmath0 versus the momentum transfer @xmath6 for two energies.,width=302 ]",
    "we have shown , in the context of the impact picture , that the analyzing power @xmath0 can be described in the cni region by the interference between the non - flip hadronic amplitude and the single - flip coulomb amplitude .",
    "unfortunately the data set at @xmath56 is too limited to confirm the predicted trend .",
    "it should be extended to make sure this method is a reliable high - energy polarimeter .",
    "the rhic machine offers a unique opportunity to measure single- and double - spin observables , with both longitudinal and transverse spin directions , and we believe it worthwhile to improve such measurements , in particular in the small momentum transfer region , as discussed in ref .",
    "so far @xmath11 was found consistent with zero within 1.5@xmath64 @xcite .",
    "it is a trivial statement to say that at the moment we know almost nothing on the @xmath1 spin - flip amplitudes at high energy , due to the scarcity of previous experiments performed at cern and fermilab .",
    "they do nt allow us to make a reliable amplitude analysis , which requires these new measured observables , in a significant range of momentum transfer .",
    "this will be important for our understanding of spin - dependent scattering dynamics .",
