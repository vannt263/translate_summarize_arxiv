    "the formalism of quantum operation can be used to describe a very large class of dynamical evolution of quantum systems , including quantum algorithms , quantum channels , noise processes , and measurements . the task to fully characterize an unknown quantum operation @xmath0 by applying it to carefully chosen input state(s ) and analyzing the output is called quantum process tomography .",
    "the parameters characterizing the quantum operation are contained in the density matrices of the output states , which can be measured using quantum state tomography  @xcite .",

    "the method in  @xcite has been experimentally demonstrated and used to benchmark the fidelities of teleportation @xcite and the gate cnot @xcite , and to investigate the validity of a core assumption in fault tolerant quantum computation @xcite .",
    "the number of parameters characterizing a quantum operation @xmath2 , and therefore the experimental resources for any method of quantum process tomography , are determined by the input and output dimensions of @xmath2 .",
    "however , different methods can be more suitable for different physical systems .",
    "furthermore , each method defines a procedure to convert the measured output density matrices to a desired representation of @xmath2 , and a simpler procedure will enhance the necessary error analysis .    in this paper , we describe in detail the method initially reported in @xcite , which is derived as a simple corollary of a mathematical proof reported in @xcite .",
    "our goal is two - fold .",
    "we hope to make this interesting proof more accessible to the quantum information community , as well as to provide a simple recipe for obtaining the kraus operators of the unknown quantum operation . in the rest of the paper , we review the different approaches of quantum operations , describe choi s proof and the recipe for quantum process tomography in sections [ sec:3approachs ] , [ sec : proof ] , and [ sec : qpt ] .",
