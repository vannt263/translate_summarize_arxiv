    "in a hierarchical universe , galaxy mergers are thought to play an important role during structure formation , particularly at higher redshifts .",

    "simulations of mergers involving gas - rich discs suggest that major mergers can trigger violent starbursts and transform discs into spheroidals .",
    "however the role of mergers in the galaxy assembly and star formation processes is still unclear .",
    "the observed correlation between galaxy morphology and color indicates that the star formation history of a galaxy is closely tied to its morphology evolution .",

    "the main difficulty of this method is that the conversion from @xmath17 to @xmath10 is unclear .",
    "it is also difficult to disentangle projection pairs from true physical pairs when using photometric redshifts alone .",
    "additionally , not all galaxies in a physical pair will merge , as the galaxies may be unbound .    from an observational point of view , it is difficult to estimate whether @xmath6 depends on the redshift and to determine the correct value of @xmath10 .",
    "a direct measurement of merger features in distant galaxies is difficult , as tidal tails and distortions generally have low surface brightness ( see mihos 1995 ; hibbard & vacca 1997 ) .",
    "a powerful method for measuring the galaxy merger rate is to count the incidence of strongly disturbed galaxies ( with strong asymmetries , double nuclei or prominent tidal tails ) , the so - called cas method ( conselice 2003 ) .",
    "there are several methods to quantify the frequency of strongly distorted galaxies : visual classification , quantitative measures of asymmetries such as the cas system ( conselice 2003 ) and the gini - m20 system ( lotz et al 2006 ) .",
    "all asymmetries suffer from surface brightness ( sb ) dimming , but the outer low sb features suffer more strongly from it .",
    "cas misses the latter features , but visual classification captures many of these .",
    "simulations ( conselice 2006 ) as well as empirical studies ( jogee et al . 2007 , 2008 ) show that visual classifications capture a larger fraction of strongly distorted galaxies than the cas merger criteria , as the eye is sensitive to asymmetries over a larger dynamic range .",
    "the cas method , applied to the _ hubble deep field _",
    "( _ hdf _ ) , provides an estimate of @xmath10 ranging from 4 to 6 ( conselice et al .",
    "2003 ; but @xmath18 in the re - analysis of these data by conselice 2006 ) .",
    "based on the results of the cas analysis , conselice ( 2006 ) suggests that equation ( [ eq : eq1 ] ) is inaccurate for some galaxy types ( especially for small galaxies ) and for high redshifts ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "the cas method provides a more straight - forward estimate of merger rate than the incidence of close pairs of galaxies .",
    "however , positioning a galaxy in the cas plane is sometimes problematic .",
    "furthermore , the connection between high asymmetry / lumpiness s and merger history implies a number of assumptions .    for these reasons , lavery et al .",
    "( 2004 ; hereafter l04 ) proposed to use ring galaxies as a more direct tracer of galaxy mergers . in fact , a high fraction of ring galaxies [ @xmath20 per cent , few & madore ( 1986 ) ] , called p - type ring galaxies , are thought to have collisional origin .",
    "recent @xmath21-body simulations ( mapelli et al .",
    "2008a , 2008b , and references therein ) show that the ring phase is quite short - lived : it lasts only for @xmath22 myr after the galaxy collision .",
    "moreover , ring galaxies are easier to identify than other interaction signatures ( e.g. tidal tails ; see mihos 1995 ; hibbard & vacca 1997 ) .",
    "thus , the number of collisional ring galaxies ( hereafter crgs ) may be a straight - forward tracer of the galaxy interaction rate .",
    "unfortunately , most ring galaxies with measured distances are relatively nearby [ @xmath23 ; see e.g. the sample of 68 ring galaxies in few & madore ( 1986 ) ] .",

    "however , their estimate is affected by large uncertainties , as they have redshift measurements only for 6 of their 25 crgs . for the remaining 19 galaxies ,",
    "they derive an estimated redshift , by assuming that crgs have similar visual magnitude .",
    "recently , elmegreen & elmegreen ( 2006 , hereafter e06 ) analyzed other 24 crgs in the gems and goods fields .",
    "for these galaxies redshift measurements are available . in this paper",
    "we present an attempt to derive the merger and the crg formation rate from cosmological simulations .",
    "the simulations can estimate the rate of minor and major mergers in progenitors of the present - day galaxy haloes and establish whether the merger rates and crg formation rates are related .",
    "we calculate the evolution of the merger and crg formation rate up to redshift 2 .",
    "we use a cosmological cube a factor of three larger and higher numerical resolution than adopted in the sph simulations of maller et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and our numerical resolution is higher of almost a factor of ten than the millennium run used in fakhouri & ma 2008 ) .",

    "we present details of the numerical simulation and analysis procedure .",
    "section  3 discusses our main results , while section  4 summarizes our conclusions and implications .",
    "we analyze a cosmological @xmath21-body simulation of the lambda cold dark matter ( lcdm ) cosmogony , with cosmological parameters chosen to match the 3-yr wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap3 ) constraints ( spergel et al .",
    "these are characterized by the present - day matter density parameter , @xmath25 , a cosmological constant contribution , @xmath26=0.762 , and a hubble parameter @xmath27 ( @xmath28 km s@xmath29 mpc@xmath29 ) .",
    "the mass perturbation spectrum has a spectral index of @xmath30 , and is normalized by the linear rms fluctuation on @xmath31 mpc/@xmath32 radius spheres , @xmath33 .",
    "we follow the evolution of @xmath34 particles of mass @xmath35 in a box of 90 mpc ( or 65.7 mpc / h ) ( comoving ) on a side , by using the @xmath21-body code pkdgrav ( stadel 2001 ) .",
    "gravitational interactions between pairs of particles are softened with a fixed comoving softening length of 1.16 kpc .",
    "non - linear structures at @xmath36 are identified using the classic friends - of - friends ( fof ) algorithm with a linking length equal to @xmath37 times the mean comoving interparticle separation . for each fof halo",
    "we identify the most bound particle and adopt its position as the halo centre . using this centre , we compute the ` virial radius ' of each halo , @xmath38 , defined as the radius of a sphere of overdensity @xmath39 ( relative to the critical density for closure ) ; with @xmath40 .",
    "quantities measured within @xmath38 will be referred to as ` virial ' , for short .",
    "we select for our analysis all haloes with masses in the range @xmath41 to @xmath42 m@xmath43 .",
    "the resulting haloes have @xmath44 between @xmath45 and @xmath46 particles within the virial radius .      for each of the haloes in our @xmath36 sample we have constructed a merger tree over the period @xmath47 , based on fof haloes .",
    "we use the fof merger tree to define and quantify the accretion and merger rates of haloes .",
    "other authors have previously used this technique or used substructure directly .",
    "we prefer to avoid the use of substructure since at a fixed mass resolution , smaller haloes are less resolved and have less substructure than larger haloes due to the classic overmerging problem ( moore et al 1996 ) .",
    "we consider a fof halo identified at @xmath48 to be progenitors of a @xmath36 system if at least 50 per cent of its particles are found within the latter . using this definition we can identify , at all times , the list of progenitors of a given @xmath36 halo and track their properties through time . in the tree to identify halo mergers , we denote a halo as a major merger remnant if at some time during @xmath49z@xmath50 its major progenitor was classified as a single group in one output but two separate groups with a mass ratio @xmath51 in the preceding output ( see donghia & burkert 2004 ) . as already noted in previous works ( e.g. gottloeber et al .",
    "2001 , berrier et al .",
    "2006 , fakhouri & ma 2008 ) , the merger tree can result in fragmentation events , in which particles of a progenitor halo end up in two distinct halo descendants .",
    "this spurious fragmentation is an artifact of the fof halo identification scheme . during the initial merge phase the halo finder associates and dissociates particles inside and outside the bound region .",
    "we noted that the fragmentation event of a halo progenitor lasts for less than 0.5 gyr .",
    "after this time usually the progenitor merges again .",
    "if this fragmentation is not properly treated , the risk is to count twice the same merger event for the current halo .",
    "we avoid this risk by assuming that the merger happens the first time the progenitor halo is considered part of the descendant .",
    "our method to handle fragmentation events is similar to the ` stitching ' method assumed from fakhouri & ma ( 2008 ) .",
    "each fof halo at @xmath48 in the tree catalog is assigned a mass counting the number of particles associated with the fof group , rather than a mass defined with the overdensity criterion .",
    "halo progenitors of interest contain at least @xmath52 particles .",
    "an additional problem with the merger tree is that the mass of a descendant halo is not exactly the sum of all the progenitors , but it may count inside the halo a diffuse mass component which is not resolved in subhaloes due to limited numerical resolution . the diffuse mass component may dominate the merger events at high redshift , when it is more difficult to resolve progenitors , owed the limited numerical resolution .",
    "however our current numerical resolution is almost a factor of ten higher than the millennium run used from fakhouri & ma ( 2008 ) and of the sph simulation of maller et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and allows us to resolve progenitors and relative mergers and guarantees that we do not miss any relevant major merger event and interaction of haloes progenitors back in time .",
    "previous studies built the halo merger trees by connecting subhaloes instead of fof haloes across the snapshot outputs ( gottloeber et al .",
    "2001 , maller et al .",
    "2006 , berrier et al .",
    "2006 ) . in these papers",
    "the procedure to define descendants and progenitors is similar to that one assumed for fof trees : a subhalo at a given redshift is assumed to be descendant of a progenitor subhalo defined at higher redshift if it contains a fixed percentage of particles .",
    "in particular berrier at al .",
    "( 2006 ) uses a hybrid n - body simulation plus analytic substructure model to predict the number of pairs , which is the quantity often used to infer the observed galaxy merger rate .",
    "since the observed number of close companions rises with redshift slower than the halo major merger rates predicted from previous simulations , they assume a halo - occupation model , in order to match the observed number of close companions inferred from current data .",
    "indeed , our algorithm is based on a fof halo tree and does not include subhaloes .",
    "however , a merger tree constructed on subhaloes inside a parent halo is mainly required to analyze galaxy - cluster sized haloes and massive galaxy - group sized haloes .",
    "the cosmological cube considered here contains only one cluster - sized halo .",
    "the galaxy - sized haloes and galaxy - group sized haloes defined in our sample are located in low density environments and are compared to galaxies which are not located in clusters , but mostly in the field .",
    "it worth noting that when merger trees are based on subhaloes it is difficult to estimate the mass of a subhalo located within a larger halo .",
    "tidal stripping occurring when a subhalo enters into larger halo can reduce significantly the mass of the subhalo before it approaches the pericentric distance , with implications for the inferred mass ratio of the merging events .",
    "since our merger trees are based on fof haloes and do not consider subhaloes , our analysis does not suffer of this problem .",
    "since our simulations are based on dark matter only , we can not directly trace the formation of crgs .",
    "however , we can estimate the rate of crg formation from our models adopting the following criteria . at each redshift",
    "we select a sample of progenitor haloes in the range of mass of a few @xmath53 to @xmath54 ( corresponding to the typical masses of observed crgs ) and we consider the encounters between them .",
    "we consider a list of 8 progenitors ordered by decreasing mass and we examine the collisions between the most massive and the second most massive progenitor and all the possible combinations amongst progenitors along the list .",
    "we assume that a crg is formed whenever two haloes undergo an encounter in which :    * the mass ratio between the bullet ( hereafter intruder halo ) and the most massive progenitor ( hereafter target halo ) is @xmath55 ; * the pericentric distance @xmath56 is less than @xmath5715 per cent of the expected disc radius of the target galaxy ( i.e. @xmath58 kpc , lynds & toomre 1976 ) .",
    "the first constraint comes both from observations of nearby crgs whose intruder is known , and from numerical simulations showing that the ring is hard to form when the mass ratio between the intruder and the target galaxy is @xmath59 ( hernquist & weil 1993 ; mihos & hernquist 1994 ; horellou & combes 2001 ; mapelli et al .",
    "2008a , 2008b ) .",
    "the second condition assumes results from numerical simulations showing that circular rings form only when the impact parameter is small .",
    "the larger the impact parameters , the more asymmetric is the resulting ring ( hernquist & weil 1993 ; mihos & hernquist 1994 ; horellou & combes 2001 ; mapelli et al .",
    "2008a , 2008b ) .",
    "finally , we do not put any limitation on the inclination angle @xmath60 ( between the disc axis of the target and the velocity of the intruder ) .",
    "lynds & toomre ( 1976 ) indicated that relatively symmetric ring galaxies can form at least for @xmath61 .",
    "recent simulations ( ghosh & mapelli 2008 ) show that regular ( although warped ) rings form also for @xmath62 .",
    "so , we can reasonably assume that ring galaxies can form also for high values of @xmath60 .",
    "thus , our estimate of the crg formation rate represents an upper limit and should be rescaled by an unknown factor @xmath63 .",
    "to predict the merger fraction as a function of redshift using observations of galaxy pairs is a difficult task , due to the complexity of establishing the time over which the merger occurred .",
    "estimates of merger fractions using galaxy pairs come from patton et al .",
    "( 2000 , 2002 ) , le fvre et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and lin et al .",
    "( 2004 ) for @xmath64 .",
    "however , owing to projection effects , some pairs might not be a physically bound system and merging may last for a long time or may never occur .",
    "on the other hand , in simulations we assume that a merger occurs when the smaller halo enters into the virial radius of the host halo , whereas the distance between the observed pairs is generally smaller than the virial radius of the progenitor .",
    "in fact , the baryonic component of the two galaxies is within @xmath65 per cent of the virial radius .",
    "a comparison of the merger rates extracted from the simulations for dark haloes to galaxy merger rates has some limitations .",
    "a direct comparison implies a conversion between halo mass and galaxy mass / light .",
    "many models usually adopted to this conversion , e.g. , see van den bosch et al .",
    "( 2007 ) and reference therein , have a strong dependence upon halo ( or galaxy ) mass .",
    "these models imply that a merger between a dark matter halo and another halo of one - tenth its mass may not be equivalent to a merger between a galaxy and another one of one - tenth its mass . over the mass range @xmath66 to @xmath67 , the variation in m",
    "/ l ratio with halo mass is approximately a constant in the hod models , so this approximation is good . for larger mass haloes we should compress our merger mass scale by  30% , but this depepence is model based and would introduce an error smaller than the observations currently suffer from . ideally we would use hydrodynamical simulations that accurately resolve the star - formation and luminosity evolution of galaxies .",
    "this is a few years away before becoming achievable computationally .",
    "the timescale over which the merger between a pair of galaxies is deemed visible is estimated as a fraction of the crossing time @xmath68 of the infalling halo into the host halo .",
    "the crossing time for realization of 1:1 merger simulations is @xmath69 gyr",
    ". simulations of 1:1 - 1:2 - 1:3 mergers show that the timescale over which merger features are visible is @xmath70 gyr for systems with different orbital inclinations ( conselice 2006 ) .",
    "we therefore define the halo merger fraction @xmath71 as @xmath72 where @xmath73 and @xmath74 are the total number of haloes and the number of haloes undergoing a ( minor or major ) merger at a given time interval @xmath75 and for a given mass @xmath76 , respectively .",
    "@xmath77 is the fraction of the time interval over which the merger signature is visible . in the time interval between z=0 and z=0.3",
    "the time is longer than the merger time so we did not account for the time delay @xmath77 .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     we calculated equation  ( [ eq : lavery ] ) for different values of @xmath10 and for @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "results are reported in table  3 .",
    "our cosmological simulations show that 23 crg form between @xmath80 and @xmath81 , leading to the value of @xmath82 , which is lower than the one obtained by l04 ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "however , if we consider the simulated crgs forming up to @xmath83 , @xmath10 is slightly lower : 46 crgs are expected to form if @xmath84 .    if we adopt the model by carlberg ( 1990a , 1990b ) , a value of @xmath85 is in disagreement with the cosmological parameters measured by wmap3 .",
    "in fact , equation  ( [ eq : eq2 ] ) implies @xmath86 for @xmath85 , at odds with the estimate of wmap3 .",
    "_ viceversa _ if @xmath87 is assumed , in agreement with wmap3 data , a value of @xmath88 is derived from equation  ( [ eq : eq2 ] ) .",
    "for @xmath88 the predicted number of newly formed crgs in simulations up to @xmath89 is @xmath90 ( see table 3 ) , too low with respect to the observations of lo4 .",
    "furthermore , in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : fig6 ] we plot the evolution in redshift of the number of crgs obtained in cosmological simulations ( hatched histogram ) compared with the number of crgs predicted from equation  ( [ eq : lavery ] ) ( open histogram with dashed line ) .",
    "we note the different evolution of the two distributions with redshift : the former decreases , the latter increases with redshift .",
    "the null hypothesis probability that the two histograms are drawn from the same distribution is 0.19 , corresponding to a non - reduced @xmath91 .",
    "( with 10 data points , 1 parameter , and assuming poissonian errors ) .",

    "we stressed that the crg formation rate is a good tracer of the merger rate . for comparison ,",

    "then , conselice s formula reproduces the evolution of the crg formation rate as well as of the total merger rate .",
    "we have used cosmological numerical simulations to study the rate of mergers of haloes with mass @xmath103 and the crg formation rate .",
    "the large volume combined with the selection criterion used to identify halo progenitors allows us to quantify the cosmic merger fraction , the merger rate and the crg formation rate among haloes .",

    "predictions of the merger fraction and merger rates are in fair agreement with the current observational data , within the great uncertainties .",
    "this implies that the observed decrease of the cosmic star formation rate since z@xmath1041 is not tied to a disappearing population of major mergers , at least according to our models .",
    "we calculate that the number of mergers a progenitor of a halo with mass @xmath105 will undergo from z@xmath106 to z@xmath107 is @xmath108 .",
    "we find that there are still major mergers occurring at redshift lower than z@xmath104 1 , mainly due to the late assembly of large mass systems . *",
    "the formation rate of crgs is a good tracer of the merger rate . * assuming that the galaxy interaction rate per unit volume is proportional to @xmath5 , as suggested by previous models , we derive @xmath85 from our numerical simulations of the concordance cosmological model .",

    "<S> we compare the observed merger rate of galaxies over cosmic time and the frequency of collisional ring galaxies ( crgs ) , with analytic models and halo merger and collision rates from a large cosmological simulation . in the lambda cold dark matter model ( lcdm ) </S>",
    "<S> model we find that the cosmic _ merger fraction _ does not evolve strongly between 0.2@xmath0z@xmath02 , implying that the observed decrease of the cosmic star formation rate since z@xmath1 might not be tied to a disappearing population of major mergers . </S>",
    "<S> haloes hosting massive galaxies undergo on average @xmath2 mergers from z@xmath3 up to present day , reflecting the late assembly time for the massive systems and the related downsizing problem . the cosmic _ merger rate _ declines with redshift : at the present time it is a factor of 10 lower than at z@xmath2 , in reasonable agreement with the current available data . </S>",
    "<S> the rate of crg formation derived from the interactions between halo progenitors up to @xmath4 is found to be a good tracer of the cosmic merger rate . in the lcdm model </S>",
    "<S> the rate of crgs as well as the merger rate do not scale as @xmath5 , as suggested by previous models . </S>",
