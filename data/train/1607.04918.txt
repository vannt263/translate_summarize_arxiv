    "the interest in studying rare @xmath0 decays is immense .",
    "this is due to the circumstance that these decays , such as @xmath5 , are flavour - changing - neutral - current ( fcnc ) processes , involving the quantum number transitions @xmath6 . in the sm @xcite , they are not allowed at the tree level , but are induced by loops and are governed by the gim ( glashow - iliopoulos - maiani ) mechanism @xcite , which imparts them sensitivity to higher masses , @xmath7 . as a consequence",
    ", they determine the ckm @xcite ( cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ) matrix elements . of these ,",
    "the elements in the third row , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are of particular interest . while @xmath11 has been measured in the production and decays of the top quarks in hadronic collisions @xcite , the first two are currently not yet directly accessible . in the sm",
    ", these ckm matrix elements have been indirectly determined from the @xmath12 - @xmath13 and @xmath14 - @xmath15 mixings .",
    "rare @xmath0-decays provide independent measurements of the same quantities .    in theories involving physics beyond the sm ( bsm ) , such as the 2-higgs doublet models or supersymmetry , transitions involving the fcnc processes are sensitive to the masses and couplings of the new particles .",
    "precise experiments and theory are needed to establish or definitively rule out the bsm effects .",
    "powerful calculation techniques , such as the heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) @xcite and the soft collinear effective theory ( scet ) @xcite have been developed to incorporate power @xmath16 and @xmath17 corrections to the perturbative qcd estimates .",
    "more importantly , they enable a better theoretical description by separating the various scales involved in @xmath0 decays and in establishing factorisation of the decay matrix elements . in exclusive decays ,",
    "one also needs the decay form factors and a lot of theoretical progress has been made using the lattice qcd @xcite and qcd sum rule techniques @xcite , often complementing each other , as they work best in the opposite @xmath18-ranges .",
    "it is this continued progress in qcd calculational framework , which has taken us to the level of sophistication required to match the experimental advances .    in this paper ,",
    "i review what , in my view , are some of the key measurements in the radiative , semileptonic and leptonic rare @xmath0-decays and confront them with the sm - based calculations , carried out with the theoretical tools just mentioned .",
    "however , this is not a comprehensive review of this subject , but the hope is that the choice of topics reflects both the goals achieved in explaining some landmark measurements and focus on open issues . in section 2 , i review the inclusive and some exclusive radiate rare @xmath0-decays.there are no burning issues in this area - at least not yet . in section 3 ,",

    "<S> experimental era of rare @xmath0-decays started with the measurement of @xmath1 by cleo in 1993 , followed two years later by the measurement of the inclusive decay @xmath2 , which serves as the standard candle in this field . </S>",
    "<S> the frontier has moved in the meanwhile to the experiments at the lhc , in particular , lhcb , with the decay @xmath3 at about 1 part in @xmath4 being the smallest branching fraction measured so far . experimental precision achieved in this area has put the standard model to unprecedented stringent tests and more are in the offing in the near future . </S>",
    "<S> i review some key measurements in radiative , semileptonic and leptonic rare @xmath0-decays , contrast them with their estimates in the sm , and focus on several mismatches reported recently . </S>",
    "<S> they are too numerous to be ignored , yet , standing alone , none of them is significant enough to warrant the breakdown of the sm . </S>",
    "<S> rare @xmath0-decays find themselves at the crossroads , possibly pointing to new horizons , but quite likely requiring an improved theoretical description in the context of the sm . </S>",
    "<S> an independent precision experiment such as belle ii may help greatly in clearing some of the current experimental issues .    </S>",
