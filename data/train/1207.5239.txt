    "the recent developments in computation and communication tasks have underlined the necessity to preserve quantum coherence in states shared by a large number of quantum systems @xcite .",
    "feynman proposed that complex and large quantum systems can be efficiently simulated only by using a quantum computer @xcite .",
    "shor s algorithm demonstrated that quantum algorithms can be used to efficiently solve problems that may not be possible with classical ones @xcite . to build a viable quantum computer that can compile and implement a quantum algorithm , which outperforms the ones running on classical machines , requires quantum coherence preserved in a system of about @xmath0 qubits @xcite .",
    "coherence in quantum states of a large number of particles is one of the essential ingredients for building a quantum communication network @xcite .",
    "such exciting developments on the theoretical front were accompanied by several experimental proposals and realizations , by using e.g. photons , ion traps , cold atoms , and nuclear magnetic resonance @xcite .    since preserving quantum coherence in states shared between multiparticle quantum systems is one of the basic necessities for many communicational and computational tasks , it is important to build a macroscopic entangled state .",
    "such an entangled state was first introduced by schrdinger in his seminal 1935 paper @xcite through the concept of the schrdinger cat , which is an entangled state between a microscopic system and a macroscopic one .",
    "the microscopic system can be an atom , that can decay spontaneously , with the undecayed state @xmath1 and the decayed state @xmath2 making up a two - dimensional complex hilbert space ( qubit ) .",
    "the macroscopic system was also conceived as a qubit made up of the alive and dead states of a cat , respectively denoted as @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the quantum state of the combined micro - macro system is considered to be @xmath5 apart from its significance in technological pursuits , it is also important for understanding the quantum measurement problem and the quantum - to - classical transition @xcite .",
    "the classic example of the schrdinger cat is the greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) state @xcite , given by @xmath6 the party denoted by @xmath7 is the microscopic part of the schrdinger cat , while the parties @xmath8 through @xmath9 make up the macroscopic portion of the same . the microscopic part is a single qubit , and is spanned by the orthonormal states @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the macroscopic portion is built out of @xmath12 qubits , denoted as @xmath13 , with each being spanned by the orthonormal states @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "noise effects on the ghz state have been studied by using a variety of models @xcite . however , as is well - known , the ghz state loses _ all _ quantum coherence if even a single qubit is lost .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a macroscopic state , which we call the w - cat state , shared between @xmath14 particles , given by @xmath15 here , @xmath16 is the @xmath12-particle w state @xcite , given by @xmath17 where the sum denotes an equal superposition of all @xmath12 particle states consisting of a single @xmath11 and ( @xmath18 ) @xmath10s .",
    "we show that the w - cat state is robust , i.e. can preserve quantum coherence in the form of entanglement between its micro and macro sectors , against loss of a finite fraction of its particles and against local depolarizations on all its particles , and with the simultaneous action of both these noise effects .",
    "we then compare the robustness of this state with other macroscopic states , that can potentially be used as cat states .",
    "in particular , we find that for a finite number of particles in the macroscopic part , the w - cat state is more robust to local depolarizing noise than the ghz state .",
    "such investigations can potentially be a step towards building quantum memory devices using macroscopic systems .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec - env ] , we discuss the noise models that we have considered in this paper . the structure of the w - cat state that make it a schrdinger cat is revealed in sec .",

    "is briefly discussed in sec .",

    "[ sec - conclu ] .",
    "it is of vital importance to investigate the effects of environmental noise on a schrdinger cat , in understanding its fundamental as well as technological implications .",
    "usually , the environmental effect that is considered for a schrdinger cat is decoherence .",
    "here we consider the coherence properties of the schrdinger cat after it has been subjected , _ simultaneously _ as well as separately , to local decoherence channels , in the form of local depolarizing channels , on all its constituent particles ( in the micro as well as the macro sectors ) and to loss of a finite fraction of its particles ( in the macro part ) .",
    "the depolarizing channel destroys off - diagonal elements of a quantum density matrix , destroying quantum coherence in the state , and is the usual model for decoherence phenomena @xcite .",
    "decoherence has , for example , been used to understand the transition of a quantum system to an effectively classical system @xcite .",
    "protecting a quantum system from decoherence is one of the main challenges faced by quantum experimentalists and engineers .",
    "mathematically , the action of a general depolarizing channel , denoted by @xmath19 , on a qubit is given by @xcite @xmath20 so that qubit remains unchanged with probability @xmath21 and gets disturbed , by white noise , with probability @xmath22 .",
    "here , @xmath23 denotes the identity matrix in the qubit hilbert space .",
    "note that this is a _ local _ noise model , which is a natural choice for multiparty experimental situations , and our interest is in analyzing the coherence retained after the action of this local noise on all the qubits building up a schrdinger cat .",
    "the cat state is also simultaneously inflicted by loss of some qubits .",
    "the effects of local decoherence and particle loss , are also considered separately as special cases .",
    "in search for a cat state , that better withstands the environmental effects including particle loss , we propose the w - cat state , @xmath24 . the states @xmath3 and @xmath4 of the original schrdinger cat are certainly macroscopically different . in the `` ghz - cat '' state , @xmath25 , these are replaced by the states @xmath26 and @xmath27 respectively .",
    "they are macroscopically different with respect to their magnetizations , i.e. with respect to their average values for the operator @xmath28 , where @xmath29 . in case of the w - cat state ,",
    "the states @xmath3 and @xmath4 of the original cat state are replaced respectively by the states @xmath16 and @xmath26 .",
    "the latter are macroscopically different in terms of their violation of local realism .",
    "it is well - known that quantum mechanics is inconsistent with the assumption of an underlying hidden variable ( `` realistic '' ) theory that is also local .",
    "this is the statement of the celebrated bell theorem @xcite .",
    "an important quantity quantifying the amount of violation of local realism by a quantum mechanical state is the critical visibility beyond which the state violates local realism . among the `` alive '' and `` dead '' cat states that are used to build the w - cat state ,",
    "the state @xmath26 certainly does not violate any local realism .",
    "however , the state @xmath16 has a critical visibility , given by @xcite @xmath30 which tends to zero as @xmath31 .",
    "it is in this sense that the states @xmath16 and @xmath26 of the macroscopic part of the w - cat state are macroscopically different .",

    "as mentioned before , it is important to understand the amount of environmental effect that a certain cat state can withstand .",
    "the `` cat - ness '' of a schrdinger cat is in the quantum coherence that exists between the micro and the macro sectors of the state .",
    "we measure the quantum coherence between these two sectors by using an entanglement measure .",
    "entanglement of a two - party system shared between two parties @xmath34 and @xmath35 , like the micro - macro system in the cat states , is defined as the inability of a quantum state of that system to be expressed in the separable form @xmath36 where @xmath37 forms a probability distribution , and @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) are states of the party @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) @xcite .    a convenient quantity to measure",
    "the entanglement in bipartite systems is the logarithmic negativity @xcite , defined , for a quantum state @xmath40 of a two - party system , as @xmath41 where the `` negativity '' , @xmath42 , is given by the sum of the absolute values of the negative eigenvalues of the partial transpose of @xmath40 with respect to either of the two parties .",
    "if either of the two parties is a qubit , the maximal value of @xmath43 is unity .",
    "in this section , we investigate the situation where the system looses a certain number of particles from its macroscopic part .",
    "suppose @xmath32 looses @xmath44 particles from among the @xmath12 particles constituting the macroscopic portion of the system .",

    ", we find the entanglement of the resultant state ( after particle loss ) in the @xmath49 bipartition .",

    "the partial transposed state of @xmath54 is seen to be block - diagonal .",
    "the negative eigenvalue of the partial transposed state , denoted by @xmath55 , is given by @xmath56 therefore , the entanglement of w - cat state after the loss of @xmath44 particles is given by @xmath57 for large @xmath12 , and for possibly large @xmath44 satisfying @xmath58 , the entanglement between the microscopic and macroscopic subsystems reaches unity , irrespective of the value of @xmath44 , and hence the state is ( nearly ) maximally entangled in this bipartition , as is also clear from fig .",

    "we now consider the situation where the w - cat state is affected by local decoherence as well as by particle loss .",

    "4 , we consider the case when the macroscopic system is constituted out of @xmath84 particles , and we find that the entanglement in the micro : macro bipartition remains almost at its initial maximal value even with the loss of about @xmath85 of its particles .",
    "entanglement remains nonzero even when the remaining 90% particles are fed to local depolarizing channels until @xmath86 .",
    "in this section , we consider some other states which may potentially be considered as cat states , and compare their ability to withstand particle loss .",

    "this state , however , becomes separable if , for any @xmath12 , we lose more than two particles .",
    "another state that can be considered as the cat state is apparently quite similar to the w - cat state , with only the n - qubit w state state replaced by the state @xmath94 .",
    "this state is given , therefore , by @xmath95 this state is a cat state in the same sense as the w - cat state  the bell inequality violations of @xmath94 and @xmath96 are drastically different .",
    "moreover , the states @xmath94 and @xmath96 are also macroscopically different in terms of their @xmath93-magnetizations .",
    "this state becomes separable if , for any @xmath12 , we lose more than one particle .",
    "an interesting generalization of the ghz state is the concatenated ghz state @xcite , and is given by @xmath97 where @xmath98 here there are @xmath14 logical qubits , and each logical qubit is built by using @xmath99 physical qubits .",
    "loss of all physical qubits from a logical qubit renders this state separable , like the ghz state .",
    "also , loss of some physical qubits from different logical qubits leads to separable states .",
    "the concept of the schrdinger cat is an important aspect of quantum physics with significance on the fundamental front as well as in useful applications .",
    "there is an ongoing effort towards experimental realization of such cat states in a variety of physical substrates .",
    "we have proposed a schrdinger cat , whose `` alive '' and `` dead '' states are modelled by two quantum states that drastically differ by their amounts of violation of bell inequalities .",
    "we show that this state is robust against loss of a finite fraction of its particles and simultaneously against local depolarizing channels , modelling a local decoherence mechanism .",
