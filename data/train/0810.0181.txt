    "the atlas combined reconstruction software uses several approaches to calculating the missing transverse energy ( missing et @xcite ) .",
    "the simplest approach is to use as input all calorimeter cells , which are calibrated based on the cell energy density and position , and muons which leave little energy in the calorimeter .",
    "this approach is expected to be robust in early data and is constructed from three terms : the _ calo term _ is calculated from all calorimeter cells , the _ muon term _ from muons measured in the muon system with @xmath7 @xmath8 2.7 and the _ cryostat term _ corrects for energy deposited in the cryostat between the electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters . a more sophisticated approach ,",
    "called the refined missing et , is to modify these calorimeter cell weights according to the object ( electron , jet etc ) that they are attached to .",
    "the linearity is defined to be : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the true missing et calculated from non - interacting truth particles .",
    "the performance is shown for a number of samples in figure 1 . in the left plot points with true missing et of 20 gev",
    "are from @xmath0 @xmath1 @xmath2 , at 35 gev from @xmath11 @xmath1 e/@xmath12 , at 68 gev from semileptonic @xmath5@xmath6 events , at 124 gev from @xmath3 @xmath1 @xmath2 with @xmath13 = 800 gev and at 280 gev from events with supersymmetric particles with a mass scale of 1 tev .",
    "the right plot shows a more detailed version for @xmath3 @xmath1 @xmath2 with @xmath13 = 800 gev - the non - linearity at low true missing et is due to the finite detector resolution and is not a bias in the algorithm .",

    "there are a number of sources of fake missing et : instrumental effects which can be understood using real data - beam gas , beam halo and noisy or dead cells , inefficiencies in reconstructing high @xmath18 muons , fake muons from e.g. jets punching through calorimeters and jet leakage from calorimeters .",

    "the first data will be used to calibrate the calorimeter and understand instrumentation failures . subsequently the @xmath0 @xmath1 @xmath2 process can be used to determine the missing et scale in situ with a systematic uncertainty of 8@xmath19 .",
    "the @xmath11 @xmath1 @xmath20 decays can be used to test the missing et reconstruction over the energy range 20 to 150 gev .",
    "top pair production will allow the reconstruction of genuine missing et to be tested in an enviroment relevant to supersummetry ( susy ) .",
    "the missing et resolution is shown as a function of @xmath15 for various processes at four different stages of the refined missing et calibration in the right plot of figure 3 .",
    "the minimum bias sample will have large statistics in the first data and thus it will be very useful for commissioning the missing et reconstruction .",
