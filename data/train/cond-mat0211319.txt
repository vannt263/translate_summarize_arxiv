    "the so(5 )  theory of high - t@xmath0 superconductivity , unifying antiferromagnetism and superconductivity was proposed to combine so(3 ) antiferromagnetic ( af ) staggered magnetization with superconducting ( sc ) two - component u(1 ) real paring field into a new order parameter.@xcite the smallest symmetry group meeting this requirements is the so(5 ) group .",
    "it contains so(3 ) group of spin rotation and u(1 ) gauge group of charge rotationas subgroups along with additional , the so - called @xmath1operators rotating af to sc state and vice versa . in the so(5 )  theory ordered phases arise once so(5 )  symmetry is spontaneously broken : with so(3 ) symmetry breaking af phase arises , while for u(1 ) symmetry breaking sc phase appears .",
    "consequently , af  and sc order parameters are grouped in five component vector called superspin , which direction is related to the competition between af  and sc states and the kinetic energy of the system is that of a so(5 ) quantum rigid rotor .",
    "the low - energy dynamics is determined in terms of the goldstone modes and their interactions specified by the so(5 ) symmetry .",
    "although , the so(5 ) theory was originally proposed in the context of an effective quantum non - linear @xmath2 model ( nlq@xmath2 m ) description of the so(5 ) rotor model its predictions were tested also within microscopic models .",
    "calculations based on nlq@xmath2 m showed that the features of the phase diagram deduced from the so(5 )  theory agree qualitatively with the global topology of the observed phase diagrams of high - t@xmath0 superconductors .",
    "@xcite magnetic correlation functions within the so(5 )  theory were investigated showing that the theory predicts a scenario for the evolution of magnetic behaviour , which is qualitatively consistent with experiments .",
    "@xcite furthermore , the study of the quantum critical point scenario within the concept of the so(5 ) group showed that the scaling of the contribution to the electrical resistivity due to spin fluctuations , displayed a linear resistivity dependence on temperature for increasing quantum fluctuations , which is a hallmark example of anomalous properties of cuprate materials.@xcite finally , thermodynamic properties of the so(5 ) model were studied , where entropy and specific heat were calculated and compared with experimental findings.@xcite    many experimentally observed properties of high - t@xmath0 cuprates show strong dependence on the magnetic field , e.g. entropy , specific heat , magnetic susceptibility , electrical resistivity , etc .",
    "therefore , a proper theory of high - t@xmath0 superconductors must be able to explain the magnetic properties of these materials .",
    "since , so(5 ) model in the presence of finite chemical potential and a finite zeeman magnetic field has the exact su(2)@xmath3u(1 ) symmetry , the zeeman magnetic field can be introduced , and the so(5 ) theory can be tested in any doping level.@xcite    the aim of this paper is to study influence of the zeeman magnetic field within the so(5 )  theory . obtained results ( e.g. specific heat ) can be then ( qualitatively ) compared with the relevant experiments and test the basic principles of the so(5 ) theory .    the outline of the reminder of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii we introduce the quantum so(5 )  hamiltonian in the zeeman magnetic field and find the corresponding lagrangian of nlq@xmath2 m . in section",
    "iii we establish the phase diagram of the system in an applied magnetic field .",
    "section iv is devoted to the study of magnetic dependence of various thermodynamic functions : free energy , entropy and the specific heat . finally , in section v we summarize the conclusions to be drawn from our work .",
    "we start from the low - energy hamiltonian of superspins @xmath4 placed in the discrete 3d s.c .",

    "the superspin components , labeled by @xmath11 and @xmath12 refer to af ( @xmath13 ) and sc ( @xmath14 ) order parameters , respectively .",
    "the superspin components are mutually commuting variables@xcite and their values are restricted by the rigid rotator constraint @xmath15 .",
    "the so(5 ) hamiltonian @xmath16 consists of three parts :  the kinetic energy of the rotors ( where @xmath17 is an analogue of moment of inertia ) , intersite interaction energy ( with @xmath18 being the stiffness in the charge and spin channel ) and so(5 ) symmetry breaking part ( including the zeeman magnetic field acting in af sector ) .",
    "the quantities @xmath19 are generators of the lie so(5 ) algebra ( related to the total charge , spin and so - called ` @xmath1 ' operators@xcite ) and @xmath20 are linear momenta given by : @xmath21 = i\\delta _ { \\mu \\nu } \\text{.}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] furthermore , we assume that @xmath22 is nonvanishing for the nearest neighbours and its fourier transform @xmath23 is simply @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the structure factor for the 3d s.c .",
    "lattice.@xcite    the last three parts of the hamiltonian provide so(5 )  symmetry breaking terms . in the result of their interplay ,",
    "the system favours either the ` easy plane ' in the sc space @xmath26 , or an ` easy sphere ' in the af space @xmath27 .",
    "two of the three terms influence directly af order parameter : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the anisotropy constant , @xmath5 is the zeeman magnetic field and @xmath30 is @xmath6 component of the spin vector .",
    "positive values of @xmath29 and @xmath31 favour the af state .",
    "the remaining term acts on sc sector and contains total charge operator @xmath32 , whose expectation value yields the doping concentration and the chemical potential @xmath11 ( measured from half - filling ) , which positive value fovours the sc state .",

    "regions of af  and sc phases are separated by the first order transition line ( for @xmath59 ) given by the condition of equality of free energies of both states , which reads : @xmath60    it is instructive to present the phase diagram as a function of physically measured quantity  the charge concentration @xmath61 instead of the chemical potential . in the so(5 )  theory , the charge concentration can be deduced from the free energy : @xmath62    the temperature - charge concentration phase diagram is depicted in fig . 1 . here ,",
