    "the _ toric surface code _ @xmath0 , first introduced by hansen in @xcite , is defined by evaluating the polynomials in @xmath11 at all the points @xmath12 in the algebraic torus @xmath13 . to be more precise",
    ", @xmath0 is a linear code whose codewords are the strings @xmath14 for @xmath15 .",
    "it is convenient to assume that @xmath3 is contained in the square @xmath16 ^ 2 $ ] so that all the monomials in @xmath11 are linearly independent over @xmath10 .",
    "thus @xmath0 has block length @xmath17 and dimension equal to the number of the lattice points in @xmath3 .",
    "note that the weight of each non - zero codeword in @xmath0 is the number of points @xmath18 where the corresponding polynomial does not vanish .",
    "therefore , the minimum distance of @xmath0 ( which is the minimum weight for linear codes ) equals @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the number of zeroes ( i.e. points of vanishing ) in @xmath13 of @xmath21 .",
    "the name _ toric surface code _ comes from the fact that @xmath3 defines a toric surface @xmath22 over @xmath23 ( strictly speaking the fan that defines @xmath22 is a refinement of the normal fan of  @xmath3 ) , where @xmath24 can be identified with the space of global sections of a semiample divisor on @xmath22 ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "this allows to exploit algebraic geometric techniques to produce results about the minimum distance of @xmath0 .",
    "in particular , little and schenck in @xcite used intersection theory on toric surfaces to come up with the following general idea : if @xmath25 is sufficiently large then polynomials @xmath15 with more absolutely irreducible factors will necessarily have more zeroes in @xmath13 ( @xcite , proposition 5.2 ) .    in this paper",
    "we expand this idea to produce explicit bounds for the minimum distance of @xmath0 in terms of certain geometric invariant @xmath2 , which we call the full minkowski length of @xmath3 .",
    "essentially @xmath2 tells you the largest possible number of absolutely irreducible factors a polynomial @xmath15 can have , but it derives it from the geometry of the polygon @xmath3 ( see definition  [ d : maximal ] ) .",
    "the number @xmath2 is easily computable  we give a simple algorithm which is polynomial in the number of lattice points in @xmath3 .",
    "moreover we obtain a description of the factorization @xmath26 for @xmath15 with the largest number of factors .",
    "more precisely , in proposition  [ p : hwl ] we show that the newton polygon @xmath27 ( which is the convex hull of the exponents of the monomials in @xmath28 ) is either a primitive segment , a unit simplex , or a triangle with exactly 1 interior and 3 boundary lattice points , called an",
    "_ exceptional triangle_. this description enables us to prove the following bound :    let @xmath29 be a lattice polygon with area @xmath30 and full minkowski length  @xmath31 . then for @xmath32 , where @xmath33 , the minimum distance of the toric surface code @xmath0 satisfies @xmath34    the condition that no factorization @xmath26 contains an exceptional triangle ( as the newton polygon of one of the factors ) is geometric and can be easily checked for any given @xmath3 ( we provide a simple algorithm for this which is polynomial in the number of lattice points in @xmath3 ) . in this case",
    "we have a better bound for the minimum distance of the toric surface code :    let @xmath29 be a lattice polygon with area @xmath30 and full minkowski length @xmath31 . under the above condition on @xmath3 , for @xmath35 , where @xmath36 , the minimum distance of the toric surface code @xmath0 satisfies @xmath37    we remark that our thresholds for @xmath25 where the bounds begin to hold are much smaller than the ones in little and schenck s result ( @xcite , proposition 5.2 ) .",
    "although , as mentioned above , the minimum distance problem for toric codes is tightly connected to toric varieties , all our methods are geometric and combinatorial and do not use algebraic geometry ( except for the hasse  weil bound , see section  [ s : prelim ] ) . in section  [",

    "section  [ s : alg ] is devoted to the above mentioned algorithms for computing @xmath2 and determining the presence of an exceptional triangle .",

    "\\(1 ) the proof is somewhat technical so we will sketch its major steps .",
    "assume @xmath3 has 4 or more interior lattice points .",
    "first , it is not hard to show that one can choose 4 interior lattice points in @xmath3 so that after an @xmath80-transformation they form either a unit square : @xmath130 or a base 2 isosceles triangle : @xmath131 .    in the first case ,",
    "note that @xmath3 must include a lattice point which is distance one from the square and lies on one of the lines containing the sides of the square . by symmetry",
    "we can assume it is @xmath132 . in figure",
    "[ f : square ] on the left , the solid dots represent the 5 points that now belong to @xmath3 , the crosses represent the points that can not belong to @xmath3 ( otherwise its length would be greater than 2 ) .",
    "now if point @xmath133 does not belong to @xmath3 ( the middle picture in figure  [ f : square ] ) then either @xmath134 or @xmath135 does .",
    "but in either case the four points of the unit square can not all lie in the interior of @xmath3 .",
    "if point @xmath133 does belong to @xmath3 then it produces more forbidden points ( the rightmost picture in figure  [ f : square ] ) .",
    "then again , it is not hard to see that no such @xmath3 can exist .    playing the same game",
    "one can show that no @xmath3 exists in the second case as well .",
    "\\(2 ) first one can show that the three interior lattice points can not be collinear .",
    "thus we can assume that they are @xmath136 .",
    "our first case is when @xmath121 also lies in @xmath3 . since this must be a boundary point and there are no more interior points in @xmath3 we see that @xmath134 and @xmath133 are the only possible boundary points of @xmath3 on the line @xmath137 .",
    "similarly , @xmath132 and @xmath138 are the only possible boundary points of @xmath3 on the line @xmath139 .",
    "since both @xmath134 and @xmath138 can not belong two @xmath3 , using symmetry we arrive at two possibilities for the boundary piece of @xmath3 containing @xmath121 , depicted in figure  [ f:3points ] on the left . as in part",
    "( 1 ) we crossed out the points which can not appear in @xmath3 since @xmath126 .",
    "then it becomes clear that the only @xmath3 ( up to symmetry ) containing @xmath136 and @xmath121 are @xmath59 and @xmath60 in figure  [ f : length2 ] .    in the second case ,",
    "when @xmath121 does not lie in @xmath3 we can assume that @xmath140 and @xmath141 do not lie in @xmath3 as well , otherwise we can reduce it to the previous case by a unimodular transformation .",
    "also , both @xmath138 and @xmath134 can not lie in @xmath3 , so by symmetry we can assume that @xmath138 does not . as before crossing out forbidden points we obtain the rightmost picture in figure  [ f:3points ] .",
    "now it is easy to see that the only @xmath3 containing the 3 points in the interior is @xmath142 in figure  [ f : length2 ] .",
    "\\(3 ) by ( 2 ) it is enough to check that @xmath143 for every @xmath144 and any exceptional triangle @xmath145 .",
    "we first look at @xmath59 . by lemma  [ l : triangles ] and remark  [ r : invtzero ] we have @xmath146 for any primitive segment @xmath48 except for the three special segments @xmath114 , @xmath115 , @xmath147 that connect the interior lattice point of @xmath145 to its vertices .",

    "in what follows we will always assume that @xmath166 .",
