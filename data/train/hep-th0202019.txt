    "in this paper we demonstrate dirac s variation method @xcite on a brane .",
    "dirac s motivation was to describe the electron as a bubble living in a background of electromagnetic field .",
    "since the bubble has one dimension less then the background manifold , it is actually a boundary between the inner and outer parts of the surrounding manifold .",
    "a self consistent model is obtainable by the principle of least action , the action must not change under small variations both in the electromagnetic field and in the location of the bubble .",
    "dirac claims that the naive way for varying the location of the bubble is wrong .",
    "this naive way is : parameterizing the bubble by the coordinates @xmath1 and the surrounding manifold by the coordinates @xmath2 , the variation in the location of the bubble is naively @xmath3 , but this will lead to the wrong equations . the right way to describe",
    "this variation is more complicated , this calls for a new coordinate system @xmath4 in the surrounding manifold . in the @xmath5-system the bubble s location is fixed , while the variation in the location is done by varying the whole @xmath6-system with respect to the @xmath5-system . therefore the action must be written in terms of the @xmath5-system , and the canonical fields are the electromagnetic field and the @xmath6-coordinate system .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to demonstrate dirac s method , and to generalize it to include gravity .",
    "this paper is built as follows , in section [ sec : snell ] we give a simple example for this method .",
    "this example is snell s law of geometrical optics .",
    "we show that the naive variation leads to the wrong condition , and only dirac s method gives the correct law . in section",
    "[ sec : general ] we start from the general action in @xmath7 dimensions , which includes gravity in @xmath7-dimensions and an @xmath0-dimensional brane .",
    "we perform the variation with respect to the @xmath5-system where the brane is fixed , and derive the equations of motion .",
    "the equations of the brane are not new .",
    "these are ; ( i ) israel junction conditions @xcite , ( ii ) generalized energy - momentum conservation on the brane , and , ( iii ) the geodetic equation of the brane @xcite .",
    "in geometrical optics we describe the light as rays propagating with the speed @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the index of refraction .",
    "we start with two media with coefficients @xmath10,@xmath11 , a light source is placed in the first medium while the observer is in the second , see fig .",
    "[ snellfig ] .     to @xmath12 , crossing the point @xmath13 . ]",
    "the point @xmath14 where the ray crosses the surface between the two media is the analog of the brane ( here it has a zero dimension ) .",
    "the surrounding manifold is the @xmath6-axis , the brane separates the axis into two parts .",
    "the canonical variable here is the height @xmath15 , while the action is the total time , it can be written as an integral over @xmath6 @xmath16 the naive variations are @xmath17 and @xmath18 . at the end points and on the brane ,",
    "the variation of @xmath19 vanishes and therefore the variation of the action is @xmath20 the equation of motion within each medium is simply @xmath21 , which means that the light propagates in straight lines .",
    "the variation with respect to @xmath14 will lead to the equation @xmath22 the geometrical relations @xmath23 will lead us to the * wrong * relation @xmath24 the reason for this wrong relation is that a variation in @xmath14 will change the path of the ray everywhere and therefore can not be regarded as an independent variation . with the specific boundary conditions , to calculate the total action as a function of @xmath14 and to impose @xmath25 . ]",
    "now we will use dirac s method for the variation . take another coordinate for the axis , and call it @xmath5 . in the @xmath5-axis ,",
    "the location of the point does not change .",
    "the action ( [ snellaction ] ) is written as an integral over @xmath5 @xmath26 the prime denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath5 .",
