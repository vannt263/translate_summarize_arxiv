    "technicolor ( tc )  @xcite provides the dynamical origin of the electroweak ( ew ) symmetry breaking by triggering condensation of techni - fermion bilinear , without introduction of a fundamental higgs boson as in the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "however , the original version of tc  @xcite , a naive scale - up version of qcd , has already been excluded due to the excessive flavor changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) .    the solution to the fcnc problem",
    "was given by the walking tc having large anomalous dimension @xmath0 due to the scale - invariant ( conformal ) gauge dynamics with non - running coupling  @xcite : the coupling is actually slowly running ( walking ) in a non - perturbative sense a la miransky  @xcite .",
    "( subsequently similar ideas were proposed without notion of the anomalous dimension and the scale invariance  @xcite ) .   and @xmath1 parameters .",
    "this may also be improved in the walking tc  @xcite .",
    "even if the walking tc in isolation can not overcome this problem , there still exist a possibility that the problem may be resolved in the combined dynamical system including the sm fermion mass generation such as the extended tc ( etc ) dynamics  @xcite , in much the same way as the solution ( `` ideal fermion delocalization '' )  @xcite in the higgsless models which simultaneously adjust @xmath2 and @xmath1 parameters by incorporating the sm fermion mass profile . ]",
    "the mass of techni - fermion @xmath3 is generated dynamically in such a way that @xmath4 near the critical coupling @xmath5 can be exponentially smaller than the cutoff @xmath6 ( to be identified with the scale of etc  @xcite @xmath7 ) , so - called miransky scaling  @xcite , closely tied with the conformal phase transition  @xcite",
    ". then the walking behavior extends in a wide region @xmath8 .",
    "such a scale - invariant dynamics may be realized in a model having a large number of techni - fermion flavors ( @xmath9 ) , as exemplified by the large @xmath10 qcd which has an approximate infrared fixed point ( irfp )  @xcite in the two - loop beta function  @xcite : thanks to the irfp the two - loop coupling is almost non - running up till the scale @xmath11 , an analogue of @xmath12 , above which the coupling runs as in a usual asymptotically free gauge theory like qcd and hence @xmath11 plays the role of the cutoff .",
    "in the same a way as the scale - invariant case , @xmath4 can be generated much smaller than @xmath11 a la miransky scaling and hence the non - perturbative walking regime of the coupling extends in a wide region of energy scale , @xmath13 , whereas the asymptotically free region @xmath14 will be embedded in an etc  @xcite .",
    "the chiral condensate is enhanced by the large anomalous dimension of techni - fermion bilinear operator @xmath15 , so that realistic masses of sm light fermions can be realized without suffering from the fcnc problem  .",
    "other dynamics such as the top quark condensate  @xcite may be required .",
    "however , it was found  @xcite that if we include additional four - fermion interactions like strong etc , the anomalous dimension becomes much larger @xmath16 , which can boost the etc - origin mass to arbitrarily large up till the techni - fermion mass scale ( `` strong etc model '' ) .",
    "( subsequently the same effects were also noted without concept of the anomalous dimension  @xcite . ) ] .    as a concrete realization of the walking tc which generally needs a large number of technifermion flavors we may consider the farhi - susskind one - family model  @xcite , which consists of one - family of the techni - fermions ( techni - quarks and -leptons ) having the same sm gauge charges as those of the sm fermions ( ordinary quarks and leptons ) .",
    "the global chiral symmetry breaking then gets enhanced from the minimal structure , @xmath17 as in the sm , to an extended one , @xmath18 , and hence gives rise to the associated sixty pseudo - nambu goldstone bosons (  techni - pions \" ) .",
    "( three of the total sixty - three are eaten by the sm weak bosons . ) probing those techni - pions at collider experiments is thus necessary for discovering the walking tc .",
    "the presence of the wide walking region implies approximate scale invariance , which is broken spontaneously by the techni - fermion mass generation at the same time the chiral symmetry is broken .",
    "the associated pseudo - nambu goldstone boson ,  techni - dilaton \"  @xcite , therefore emerges as a light composite scalar formed as techni - fermion and anti - techni - fermion bound state .",
    "the walking low - lying spectra would thus consist of techni - pions and techni - dilaton (  walking pseudo s \" ) , whose collider signatures would therefore serve as definite benchmarks toward discovery of the walking tc .    actually , the techni - dilaton signatures at the lhc have recently been discussed  @xcite in comparison with the sm higgs . it was shown that the characteristic signatures are seen through the diphoton channel either at around 125 gev consistently with the currently reported diphoton excess  @xcite or above 600 gev as a nonresonant excess in a higher energy region of the diphoton invariant mass distribution .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , on the other hand , the current lhc limits on techni - pions have also been discussed focusing on isospin - color singlet techni - pion ( denoted as @xmath19 in the original literature  @xcite ) in the diphoton and tau lepton pair channels , taking the pion mass as a free parameter . in the case of the one - family walking tc ,",
    "however , the techni - pion masses can be pulled up to a higher scale than that expected from naive scaling of qcd  @xcite .",
    "such a naively believed folklore would be clarified by explicit estimate of techni - pion masses incorporating the essential features of walking dynamics , which would also find out more relevant parameter regions to search for walking techni - pions at the lhc .",
    "actually , such explicit calculations have not been done so far .    in this paper",
    ", we compute the mass and the coupling of techni - pions of a typical walking tc , the farhi - susskind one - family model  @xcite , using recent results on a nonperturbative analysis based on the ladder schwinger - dyson equation employed in a modern version of walking tc  @xcite .",
    "the masses of techni - pions charged under the ew gauges are calculated by evaluating one - ew gauge boson exchange diagrams , so that the contributions are cast into the form of integral over the momentum square @xmath20 with respect to difference between vector and axialvector current correlators @xmath21 , similarly to computation for charged pion mass in qcd .",
    "though those current correlators are quite sensitive to ultraviolet behavior and thus the walking dynamics , it turns out that the ew gauge boson exchange contributions dramatically cancel each other in the ultraviolet region , as was discussed long ago for the naive - scale up version of qcd  @xcite , so that there arise no sizable corrections to the masses .",
    "the colored techni - pions , on the other hand , get sizable ultraviolet contributions from one - gluon exchange diagram , in contrary to the charged pions .",
    "the size of corrections without ultraviolet cancellation is actually enhanced by a large logarithmic factor scaled with the ultraviolet scale of tc , @xmath11 , compared to the naive - scale up version of qcd  @xcite .",
    "this is due to the characteristic ultraviolet scaling of @xmath22 in the walking tc : the @xmath22 in the walking tc damps with the large anomalous dimension @xmath23 more slowly than that in qcd - like dynamics with @xmath24 , in such a way that @xmath25 .",
    "thus the amount of integration over the momentum square @xmath20 gets larger than that in the case of qcd - like dynamics , depending on the size of the ultraviolet cutoff @xmath11 , as was indicated in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "as in ref .",
    "@xcite , etc - induced four - fermion interactions breaking the full chiral @xmath26 symmetry into the separate chiral symmetries for techni - quarks and -leptons give the masses to techni - pions coupled to the separate chiral currents .",
    "the masses also get enhanced due to the chiral condensate enhanced by the large anomalous dimension , as has been expected  @xcite .",
    "precise estimates of the masses can then be made by using the recent nonperturbative results  @xcite on the techni - fermion chiral condensate @xmath27 combined with the pagels - stokar formula  @xcite for the techni - pion decay constant @xmath28 , which allows us to evaluate @xmath27 in terms of @xmath28 fixed as @xmath29 gev . as a result",
    ", it turns out that all the techni - pions are on the order of several hundred gev ( see table  [ tab : tp ] ) .    based on our estimation",
    ", we then discuss the phenomenological implications to the lhc signatures , focusing on neutral isosinglet techni - pions , in comparison with the sm higgs .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ tpcouplings - masses ] we start with a brief review of a low energy effective lagrangian , which consists of the walking pseudo s ( techni - pions and techni - dilaton ) , based on nonlinear realization of both chiral and scale symmetries  @xcite .",

    "the building blocks consist of the usual chiral nonlinear base @xmath31 and techni - dilaton field @xmath32 .",
    "the @xmath31 is parametrized as @xmath33 where @xmath34 @xmath35 with @xmath36 being generators of @xmath37 and @xmath28 denotes the decay constant associated with the spontaneous breaking of the chiral symmetry .",
