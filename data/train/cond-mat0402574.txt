    "our current understanding of critical phenomena results from an intensive interplay between experimental studies of a large variety of physical systems , ground - breaking theoretical developments ( including renormalization group methods , finite - size scaling theory and conformal invariance ) and extensive numerical investigations of model systems . in many cases",
    "the systems under investigation are treated as bulk systems , thus neglecting the existence of surfaces which are unavoidable in real physical systems .",
    "discarding surfaces in systems with short - range interactions is justifiable when studying bulk critical properties , as the contribution of the surface to extensive quantities is vanishing in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "however , a surface breaks the translation symmetry of a system and changes local quantities .",
    "thirty years ago , it has been realized that this leads to surface critical behaviour which differs from the bulk critical behaviour .",
    "since that time numerous theoretical and experimental studies have been undertaken in order to determine local critical quantities in systems with perfect surfaces .",
    "real surfaces , however , are usually not perfectly smooth but display some degree of roughness due to the presence of surface defects as for example steps , islands , or vacancies .",
    "impurities are also often encountered at crystalline surfaces and may be viewed as the source of some disorder at the surface .",
    "furthermore , experimentalists nowadays create thin films which do not appear in nature , by growing artificial structures on the film surface .",
    "all these defects have some impact on magnetic surface quantities .    the present work reviews the recent progress achieved in the study of critical phenomena in systems with boundaries . besides semi - infinite systems and films with perfect surfaces , more complex geometries with wedges and corners as well as more realistic surfaces with defects are discussed .",
    "the review hereby focuses on the question whether the different types of geometries and/or of surface defects have an impact on the surface critical behaviour .",
    "it is therefore complementary to earlier reviews on surface criticality @xcite that exclusively considered flat , perfect surfaces .",
    "the thermodynamics of a surface is completely described by the surface free energy per area @xmath0 .",
    "singularities occurring in @xmath0 determine the phase diagram of semi - infinite systems . at some phase boundaries of this phase diagram surface and bulk free energies both exhibit singularities , whereas at other boundaries only @xmath0 becomes singular .",
    "an example for the former case is the * ordinary transition * where bulk and surface ordering occur at the same temperature , whereas the latter case is encountered at the so - called * surface transition * where the surface layer alone orders , while the bulk remains disordered .",
    "this surface transition is encountered at temperatures higher than the bulk critical temperature , the critical fluctuations of the @xmath1-dimensional semi - infinite system then being essentially ( @xmath2)-dimensional , corresponding to a phase transition in @xmath2 dimensions .    in section 2 the critical behaviour at perfect surfaces",
    "is discussed . at the bulk critical point",
    "different surface universality classes are obtained for every bulk universality class .",
    "these universality classes are discussed and their differences emphasized .",
    "furthermore , recent progress in our understanding of surface critical behaviour in systems with competing interactions is reviewed .",
    "surface critical dynamics and the effect of symmetry breaking surface fields are also briefly discussed .",
    "section 3 is devoted to more complex geometries with a wedge .",
    "wedge - shaped models are very interesting systems where local critical exponents , which change continuously with the wedge opening angle , arise because of the particular geometrical properties of the wedge . however , at a given opening angle , surface critical behaviour at the ordinary transition is still universal and does not depend on microscopic details of the model as for example the lattice type or the strengths of the local interactions .",
    "this is completely different at the surface transition , where under certain circumstances non - universal local critical behaviour can be observed . at a fixed opening angle ,",
    "edge critical exponents then not only depend continuously on the values of the local couplings but also reflect the existence of the disordered bulk .",
    "this intriguing behaviour results from the fact that at the surface transition the edge acts like a defect line in a two - dimensional critical system .",
    "corner critical behaviour is discussed in this section , too . in the last years a great deal of activity focused on the critical behaviour of wedges in presence of external surface fields .",
    "this rapidly developing field is also briefly summarized .",
    "section 4 deals with the important issue of thin films and semi - infinite systems with non - perfect surfaces .",
    "surfaces are very often naturally rough , due to the growth mechanism or because of erosion effects .",
    "adatom islands , vacancy islands or steps are typical defects encountered at real surfaces . on the other hand , specific surface structures , as for example lines of adatoms or regular geometrical patterns , can be created on purpose by using advanced experimental methods .",
    "as these surface defects have an impact on local surface quantities , one has to ask the question whether they do change the surface critical behaviour . for semi - infinite systems we must again distinguish between the ordinary transition and the surface transition . at the ordinary transition , common surface defects ( presence of a step ,",
    "surfaces with uncorrelated roughness , amorphous surface ) are usually irrelevant for the surface critical behaviour , but there are some notable exceptions . at the surface transition , defect structures like steps and additional lines of atoms located at the surface may yield non - universal local critical exponents , as observed in semi - infinite ising models with additional surface structures .",
    "interestingly , additional lines located at the surface of thin ising films always lead to a non - universal local critical behaviour .",
    "section 5 finally contains concluding remarks .",
    "the aim of this section is to review the main results on surface criticality in systems with flat , perfect surfaces . in sections 2.1 and 2.2",
    "we pay special attention to the phase diagrams of semi - infinite systems as well as to the sets of critical exponents characterizing the different surface phase transitions . as",
    "the amount of papers published on this topic is rather impressive , only selected results are presented .",
    "the interested reader is referred to the reviews of binder @xcite , abraham @xcite , and diehl @xcite for further readings .",
    "the main experimental techniques available for the investigation of surface critical behaviour are reviewed in the book of dosch @xcite .",
    "section 2.3 is devoted to critical phenomena in thin films , whereas in section 2.4 the recent studies of surface criticality in systems with competing interactions are discussed .",
    "brief accounts of works on surface critical dynamics and on surface critical behaviour in presence of external fields close this section .      when comparing systems with and without surfaces , one remarks that extensive quantities are altered by the presence of surfaces",
    "thus , the free energy is given by @xcite @xmath3 with the bulk free energy per volume @xmath4 and the surface free energy per surface area @xmath0 .",
    "@xmath5 and @xmath6 are the volume and the surface of the system , respectively .",
    "further terms in equation ( [ gl:3_2 ] ) may result from the presence of edges , as discussed in section 3 .",
    "similar corrections also show up in other extensive quantities .",
    "the surface free energy @xmath0 completely describes the thermodynamics of the surface .",
    "similar to @xmath4 , singularities occur in @xmath0 .",
    "the values of the variables of @xmath0 , where these singularities appear , determine the boundaries separating the different phases of the surface phase diagram .",
    "as we shall see later in the course of this section , at some phase boundaries both @xmath4 and @xmath0 exhibit singularities whereas at other ones only @xmath0 becomes singular .",
    "local quantities as the local magnetisation density ( often called local magnetisation for brevity ) or the local energy density are also modified by the presence of a surface .",
    "examples of order parameter profiles obtained by monte carlo simulations of three - dimensional ising films with @xmath7 layers at temperatures below the bulk critical temperature @xmath8 are shown in figure [ fig_surf_1 ] @xcite . here , all the couplings involved have been chosen to have equal strength @xmath9 and no magnetic fields have been retained .",
    "the surface magnetisation @xmath10 , related to @xmath0 by the equation @xmath11 is smaller than the bulk magnetisation due to the reduced coordination number at the surface .",
    "the field @xmath12 acts exclusively on the surface layer .",
    "the magnetisation increases from its surface value to the bulk value at distances exceeding the bulk correlation length @xmath13 . in case",
    "the thickness of the film is not large compared to @xmath13 ( as for example at the temperature @xmath14 in figure [ fig_surf_1 ] ) the bulk magnetisation is never reached . for surface couplings exceeding the bulk couplings by a large amount , magnetisation profiles decreasing monotonically towards the center of the system may also be observed .",
    "for ising models in film geometry we have the general hamiltonian @xmath15 where the spins @xmath16 can take on the values @xmath17 .",
    "the first sum runs over bonds connecting neighbouring spins where at least one of the spins is a bulk spin , whereas the second sum runs over all surface links .",
    "bulk couplings , @xmath9 , and surface couplings , @xmath18 , are ferromagnetic .",
    "the bulk field @xmath19 acts on all the spins , the surface field @xmath12 only on spins located at the surface , i.e. a surface spin sees the field @xmath20 . sometimes a different coupling constant is used for the bonds connecting surface and bulk spins @xcite . in general , the perturbations due to the presence of a surface are supposed to be of short range .",
    "analytical results on surface critical behaviour are commonly obtained in the framework of continuum field theory , see @xcite for comprehensive reviews . the standard @xmath21 ginzburg - landau model , appropriate for the universality class of the ising model , is thereby augmented in order to include contributions coming from the surface : @xmath22 with @xmath23 , whereas @xmath24 is related to the surface enhancement of the spin - spin coupling constant in the corresponding lattice model .",
    "the resulting ginzburg - landau free energy density is readily generalized to cases where the order parameter exhibits a different symmetry .",
    "layer - dependent quantities are very useful when investigating systems with surfaces .",
    "examples are the magnetisation per layer @xmath25 and the susceptibility per layer @xmath26 where @xmath27 labels the layers parallel to the surface .",
    "the surface magnetisation is @xmath28 and the local susceptibility at the surface , i.e.   the response of the surface magnetisation to a surface field , @xmath29 , is given by @xmath30 .",
    "from the profiles @xmath25 and @xmath26 one also obtains the surface excess quantities @xmath31 and @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the bulk magnetisation and the bulk susceptibility . of further importance is the surface layer susceptibility , i.e.the response of the local surface magnetisation to a bulk field , usually denoted by @xmath35 .",
    "the critical surface pair correlation function behaves as @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the scaling dimension of the surface order parameter . for a @xmath1-dimensional model",
    "@xmath38 is a @xmath39-dimensional vector parallel to the surface .",
    "this behaviour of the surface correlation function differs from that of the bulk correlation function : @xmath40 where the value of the bulk scaling dimension @xmath41 is usually smaller than that of @xmath37 . here",
    "@xmath42 is a @xmath1-dimensional vector .",
    "critical correlations between a surface point and a bulk point exhibit a power law behaviour with the exponent @xmath43 .",
    "the surface critical exponents associated with the different critical quantities are listed in table [ table_surf_1 ] .",
    ".[table_surf_1 ] surface critical exponents and their definitions . [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     to explain these findings , note that the corners are intersection points of edges and recall that at the surface transition the critical fluctuations are essentially two - dimensional .",
    "the critical exponent of the corner magnetisation , @xmath44 , has been related to that of the magnetisation at the intersection of three semi - infinite defect lines in the two - dimensional ising model .",
    "the critical exponent @xmath45 for star defects formed by three intersecting ladder defects has been calculated by henkel _",
    "one may assign to the edges an effective ladder coupling @xmath46 by setting @xmath47 . inserting",
    "this effective coupling into the equation derived for a star defect formed by three ladder defects @xcite then gives @xmath45 .",
    "the comparison of @xmath44 with @xmath45 yields a satisfactory agreement , see table [ table_edge_3 ] .",
    "of course , a more refined analysis would focus on the fact that the correct geometry of the present problem is not that of a plane but that of a cone with three defect lines meeting at an angle @xmath48 @xcite ( see @xcite for a recent discussion of ising models with conical singularities ) .",
    "furthermore , the rather complicated nature of the edge as a simultaneously ladder- and chain - type defect line as well as the effect of the bulk spins on the corner magnetisation should then also be taken into account .",
    "the critical behaviour near edges has also been studied recently at the normal transition @xcite .",
    "the authors investigated critical adsorption near edges due to the presence of symmetry - breaking surface fields in a wedge .",
    "besides studying the problem in mean - field approximation , they also presented some exact results for the two - dimensional case .",
    "especially , the critical edge exponent @xmath49 was discussed .",
    "it was shown that at the normal transition local critical exponents also depend continuously on the opening angle .",
    "critical adsorption near edges is , however , only one of the many intriguing phenomena encountered in systems with both wedges and surface fields . in the case of adsorption of a fluid on a solid substrate with wedge geometry",
    "@xcite it is expected from thermodynamic arguments that the liquid fills the wedge completely at temperatures @xmath50 , where the filling temperature @xmath51 is lower than the wetting temperature @xmath52 of a planar , but otherwise identical , wall @xcite . in a series of recent papers parry _ et al . _",
    "@xcite studied the corner filling transition in detail , focusing especially on fluctuation effects and on the universality classes of filling transitions .",
    "one of their prediction was that critical filling , i.e.  the filling transition for @xmath53 , could be continuous even in cases where the related wetting transition is of first order .",
    "they also studied the divergence of various length scales associated with this phase transition and predicted , basing themselves on a fluctuation theory , that the interfacial height @xmath54 from the bottom of the wedge should diverge as @xmath55 @xcite .",
    "the wedge filling transition can be studied in ising models with wedge geometries by applying surface fields which favor one of the two phases in the wedge @xcite .",
    "exact results in the two - dimensional case @xcite permit to establish the existence of this kind of transition .",
    "recent numerical investigations @xcite revealed a very good agreement with the theoretical predictions of parry _",
    "et al_. in addition , a new type of interface localisation - delocalisation transition was revealed in the three - dimensional double wedge forming a pore with a square cross section @xcite .",
    "the critical exponents of this transition can be related to the critical exponents of the filling transition in a simple wedge .",
    "the influence of wedges on critical behaviour has not only been studied in equilibrium systems but also in non - equilibrium systems .",
    "@xcite introduced an edge into a directed percolation process and analysed the impact this edge has on the non - equilibrium phase transition observed in this system .",
    "this work generalized earlier studies of directed percolation in a semi - infinite geometry @xcite to the wedge geometry . angle dependent edge critical exponents were observed in this non - equilibrium case , too .",
    "directed percolation processes have also been studied in two - dimensional parabolic - like systems with a free surface at @xmath56 @xcite . for @xmath57 , @xmath27 being the dynamical exponent",
    ", the surface shape is a relevant perturbation and the tip order parameter displays a stretched exponential behaviour . in the marginal case , @xmath58 , a non - universal local critical behaviour",
    "is again observed .",
    "other non - equilibrium absorbing phase transitions have also been studied in semi - infinite systems recently @xcite , but these studies have not been extended to wedge - shaped geometries .",
    "in the preceding sections we discussed critical phenomena in systems with various geometries : semi - infinite systems , wedge - shaped systems , and cubes .",
    "all the results presented so far have in common that only idealized , perfect surfaces were considered",
    ". however , real surfaces are often naturally rough , as steps or islands occur during growth processes or result from the effect of erosion .",
    "furthermore , methods from nanoscience permit to create artificial structures on top of films .",
    "examples include lines of adatoms or regular arrangements of geometric structures .",
    "all these defects have some impact on magnetic surface quantities .    in the following i review theoretical studies where surface critical phenomena in systems with various surface defects have been investigated .",
    "section 4.1 deals with semi - infinite ( i.e.  bulk terminated ) systems , whereas section 4.2 is devoted to the influence of surface defects on the critical behaviour of ( ultra)thin films .",
    "geometric surface imperfections ( e.g. , islands or vacancies ) and impurities may be stable on the time scale of magnetic phenomena and thus lead to quenched surface disorder @xcite .",
    "some experiments indicate an enhancement of disorder near surfaces , thus pointing to the possible realisation of quenched surface disorder in systems where bulk disorder is negligible . in a theoretical description , this kind of surface disorder is usually mimicked by random surface fields or by random surface couplings .",
    "early studies mainly focused on the global phase diagram observed in systems with random surface couplings or random surface fields . in @xcite",
    "dilute semi - infinite ising models with bond and site dilution both in the bulk and at the surface were considered .",
    "mean - field results obtained for semi - infinite ising models with random surface and bulk fields were presented in @xcite .",
    "the possible types of phase diagrams were established and the phase transitions as well as multicritical points were discussed .",
    "phase diagrams obtained for semi - infinite transverse ising models with random surface and bulk fields were analysed recently in @xcite .    in a series of papers ,",
    "kaneyoshi ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) studied semi - infinite ising systems with an amorphous surface layer in detail .",
    "the amorphous surface can be mimicked by choosing randomly weak or strong nearest - neighbour ferromagnetic couplings between surface spins .",
    "sometimes , he also considered random couplings between surface spins and the underlying bulk spins . using different analytical approaches , surface magnetic properties as ,",
    "for example , the magnetisation of the surface layer , were analysed .",
    "the corresponding phase diagrams were derived from the results of an effective field theory which includes correlations . one interesting result obtained in these studies concerns the location of the special transition point .",
    "kaneyoshi observed that the critical coupling ratio @xmath59 is shifted to higher values in systems with a diluted surface and he conjectured that this is a common effect of surface amorphisation .",
    "this was confirmed by a monte carlo study @xcite where the strength of surface bonds was chosen randomly between two different values @xmath60 and @xmath61 , the ratio @xmath62 measuring the degree of dilution .",
    "for @xmath63 the special transition point is located at the mean coupling ratio @xmath64 for the simple cubic lattice , noticeably larger than the value obtained for the perfect surface @xmath65 , see section 2.1 . in order to understand this shift we recall that in the limit @xmath66 the surface effectively decouples from the underlying bulk and",
    "can be regarded as a two - dimensional system .",
    "however , it is well known that at a given mean coupling @xmath67 the critical temperature of the two - dimensional ising model is reduced by randomness @xcite . therefore , for fixed @xmath68 , increasing randomness shifts the line of the surface transition to lower temperatures which in turn shifts the location of the special transition point to larger values of the coupling ratio .    sometimes , alloy surfaces are mimicked by semi - infinite surfaces with randomly decorated magnetic and nonmagnetic atoms located on the surface @xcite .",
    "again , the location of the special transition point is observed to shift as a function of the model parameters .",
    "quantities having an impact on this shift are for example the concentration of the nonmagnetic surface atoms or the spin of the magnetic atoms .",
    "the investigations reviewed so far almost exclusively focused on global phase diagrams of semi - infinite systems with non - perfect surfaces .",
    "the different authors did not try to study in detail the influence of these imperfections on the surface critical behaviour .",
    "however , as a certain degree of imperfections is unavoidable when studying surfaces experimentally , it is very important to clarify whether the surface critical exponents are robust against surface imperfections .",
    "a first step in this direction was taken by mon and nightingale in their study of the influence of a random surface field on the surface critical behaviour of the semi - infinite ising model @xcite .",
    "this work was motivated by the determination of the surface order parameter critical exponent @xmath69 in a study of wetting phenomena of binary mixtures consisting of a polar and a nonpolar liquid @xcite .",
    "the value obtained for @xmath69 in that study was compatible with the value encountered in the semi - infinite ising model with a perfect surface , even so @xmath69 described the vanishing of the surface order parameter in the presence of a random surface field with zero average strength . using a harris type criterion @xcite , mon and nightingale conjectured that , at the ordinary transition , a random surface field is irrelevant for the surface critical behaviour of the ising model .",
    "they verified their prediction with the aid of monte carlo simulations . using renormalization group techniques it was shown in @xcite",
    "that surface bond - dilution is irrelevant for the semi - infinite ising model , the universality classes of the different transitions being those of the pure system .    in an extensive study , diehl and",
    "nsser @xcite derived harris type criteria for various types of quenched surface disorder with the aim to assess the relevance or irrelevance of these random imperfections on the pure system surface critical behaviour . in his original work , harris @xcite studied the stability of critical bulk systems in the presence of randomness .",
    "the well - known harris criterion states that , in the weak - disorder limit , bond disorder is irrelevant for the bulk critical behaviour provided the specific heat critical exponent @xmath70 is negative .",
    "disorder is relevant for @xmath71 , whereas the case @xmath72 is marginal .",
    "looking at the ising model , one concludes , based on the harris criterion , that in three dimensions disorder is relevant as @xmath73 , whereas in two dimensions one encounters the marginal case @xmath72 which has attracted much interest @xcite .",
    "one should note that the condition for irrelevance of disorder resulting from a harris type criterion is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for the stability of the pure system s critical behaviour .",
    "nevertheless , a harris type criterion is usually a reliable indicator for the irrelevance of randomness .",
    "the harris criterion generalized in @xcite to surface critical behaviour states that short - range correlated disorder is relevant or irrelevant depending on whether some ( surface ) susceptibility , which depends on the kind of randomness under investigation , diverges or is finite at the critical point . for random surface fields",
    "the quantity of interest is the surface susceptibility @xmath74 of the pure system , whereas for random surface couplings the relevant susceptibility is the local specific heat @xmath75 @xcite . as these generalized susceptibilities have a singularity of the form @xmath76 at the critical point , the criterion indicates that the disorder is relevant for positive @xmath77 ( i.e.  @xmath78 or @xmath79 ) , but that it is irrelevant for negative @xmath77 .",
    "this criterion has been applied by diehl and nsser in various cases involving surfaces .",
    "thus , the presence of random surface fields is expected to be irrelevant at the ordinary transition for all @xmath80 models with @xmath81 if the dimension @xmath82 , in accordance with the results obtained by mon and nightingale @xcite for the special case of the semi - infinite ising model ( @xmath83 ) .",
    "interestingly , feldman and vinokur recently showed @xcite that weak quenched surface disorder destroys bulk ordering in the case of a system with continuous symmetry ( as the @xmath84 model ) , leading to a power law decay of correlation functions and therefore to the appearance of quasi - long - range order . in the two - dimensional semi - infinite ising model",
    "the perturbation caused by the random surface field is marginal so that the criterion does not yield a definite answer .",
    "this case was studied subsequently in @xcite where it was shown that the surface critical behaviour of the 2d ising model is described by ising critical exponents with logarithmic corrections to scaling . for the special transition point",
    ", the harris like criterion of @xcite indicates that random surface fields are relevant in dimensions @xmath85 .",
    "however , the three - dimensional semi - infinite ising model with quenched random surface fields does not present a special transition point nor an extraordinary transition , as the surface transition line , where the surface orders alone , does not exist anymore .",
    "this follows from the fact that at finite temperatures random bulk fields destroy long - range order in the two - dimensional bulk ising system @xcite . in the cases where the extraordinary transition still exists in the presence of random surface fields ,",
    "the criterion predicts that the disorder is then irrelevant . for random surface couplings ,",
    "the perturbation is found to be irrelevant both at the ordinary and at the extraordinary transitions .",
    "more interesting is the situation at the special transition point where early estimates of the critical exponent @xmath79 in three dimensions yielded small negative @xcite _ or _ small positive values @xcite , implying that short - range enhancement disorder is close to being relevant in three dimensions .",
    "recently , new field - theoretical estimates also resulted in negative values for @xmath79 @xcite .",
    "the monte carlo results obtained for three - dimensional semi - infinite ising models with random surface - bond disorder @xcite are also compatibel with the irrelevance of random surface enhancement for the special transition point critical behaviour .",
    "however , as short - range random surface enhancement is close to being relevant , one might expect long - range correlated enhancement disorder to be relevant at the special transition point @xcite .",
    "diehl and nsser also studied the impact of surface - enhancement disorder at the special transition of a bulk tricritical system .",
    "as in this case the harris criterion did not permit a definite prediction , renormalization group techniques were used in a second paper @xcite to clarify the situation .",
    "the robustness of the surface critical exponents at the ordinary transition against two types of surface imperfections was established in a monte carlo study @xcite .",
    "the studied imperfections correspond to an amorphous surface , mimicked by random strong and weak couplings in the surface , and to a simple case of corrugation , due to the presence of a step of monoatomic height superimposed on a perfect surface . for the amorphous surface",
    ", the monte carlo results showed that the dilution , at a fixed temperature @xmath86 , decreases the magnetisation at and near the surface .",
    "the effective critical exponent , derived from the magnetisation of the diluted surface , follows in the ising case closely that of the perfect case , yielding the same asymptotic value @xmath87 .",
    "randomness in the surface couplings is therefore irrelevant for the asymptotic behaviour of the surface magnetisation , and even of minor importance for the corrections to scaling @xcite .",
    "similarly , the estimate for surface susceptibility critical exponent @xmath88 is compatibel with the one in the perfect case .",
    "these numerical findings provide support for the conjecture of @xcite that surface enhancement disorder is irrelevant at the ordinary transition .",
    "the robustness of the critical exponent @xmath69 against dilution observed in the numerical study was later proven by diehl @xcite who derived upper and lower bounds on the surface magnetisation of the diluted surface and showed in a rigorous way that @xmath69 takes the same value in the diluted system as in the perfect system .    in @xcite the effect of corrugation on surface critical behaviour",
    "was studied in ising systems where an extra half layer in the form of a strip - like terrace of monoatomic height was superimposed on a perfect surface , as shown in figure [ fig_dirt_1 ] . for this geometry",
    "the magnetisation at the step - edge deviates most significantly from the magnetisation of the perfect surface .",
    "the local critical exponent describing the behaviour of the step - edge magnetisation was found to have the value 0.800(15 ) , in agreement with that of the magnetisation of the flat surface .",
    "however , in contrast to the case of random couplings , corrections to scaling are here distinctively different from those of the perfect surface .",
    "diehl also considered this type of imperfections in @xcite and showed in a rigorous way that the critical exponent of the step - edge magnetisation is identical to that of the magnetisation of a perfect surface .",
    "note that at the surface transition local critical magnetic exponents are expected to be non - universal close to the step - edge .",
    "indeed , the step - edge should then act like a defect line in a system governed by two - dimensional critical fluctuations .",
    "this is supported by monte carlo simulations which yield for @xmath89 the value @xmath90 for the step - edge magnetisation critical exponent @xcite in the ising model .",
    "the study of magnetic properties of rough , corrugated surfaces near criticality is a rather new and promising field .",
    "the case of one additional terrace on an otherwise perfect surface may be generalized to the more complex situation of vicinal surfaces with terraces separated by equally spaced monoatomic steps @xcite . in nature , rough surfaces often result from a growth process and strongly affect the surface magnetisation .",
    "diffusion - limited growth results in a rough growth front following a poisson distribution .",
    "this may be realized in simulations by considering a surface formed of columns of random heights @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "layer - by - layer growth , however , may result in films with a finite number of complete layers and one partially filled layer , thus yielding a different type of roughness @xcite . whereas the different kinds of roughnesses discussed so",
    "far have been shown to be ( or are supposed to be ) irrelevant for the surface critical behaviour at the ordinary transition , this is not always the case . in a recent interesting work ,",
    "hanke and kardar @xcite showed that self - affine rough surfaces may give rise to novel surface critical behaviour with surface critical exponents different from those of the perfect case .",
    "similar results have previously been obtained in two - dimensional systems with fractal boundaries @xcite yielding new multifractal boundary exponents .",
    "these results in two dimensions have been interpreted in terms of a scale - dependent distribution of opening angles of the fractal boundary @xcite .",
    "the same analogy has been evoked in the discussion of the surface critical behaviour of self - affine surfaces in @xcite .",
    "hanke and kardar also studied critical correlations in the vicinity of a regularly patterned surface ( as might for example result from a lithographic preparation of the surface ) . using a perturbative calculation in the deformations in height from a flat surface they showed that the leading power law decay of the correlations is the same as for a flat surface , but with a modulated amplitude reflecting the shape of the surface @xcite .",
    "extended surface defects have been studied intensively in two dimensions . in the hilhorst - van leeuwen model",
    "@xcite one considers a semi - infinite square lattice with inhomogenous couplings ( alternatively , the triangular lattice has also been investigated ) . in the direction parallel to the surface one has couplings with a constant strength @xmath91 , whereas the strength of the couplings varies perpendicular to the surface as a function of the distance @xmath92 to the surface : @xmath93 this extended perturbation is irrelevant for @xmath94 , yielding the same critical behaviour as the homogeneous semi - infinite system . for @xmath95 , however , the perturbation is relevant and a spontaneous surface magnetisation is observed at the bulk critical point .",
    "the most interesting case is @xmath96 , where the perturbation is marginal . here",
    "a spontaneous surface magnetisation is again observed for values of @xmath97 larger than some threshold @xmath98 , whereas for @xmath99 the scaling dimension @xmath37 varies continuously as a function of @xmath97 : @xmath100 .",
    "this intriguing behaviour has attracted much interest in the past @xcite and has recently led to the discovery of an up to then unnoticed effect in the short - time non - equilibrium critical dynamics at surfaces @xcite .",
    "finally , before turning to thin films with surface imperfections , let us briefly mention some recent work concerning surface critical behaviour in an ising model with quenched random defects in the bulk .",
    "in the three - dimensional bulk ising model , quenched random defects are a relevant perturbation leading to modified critical bulk exponents @xcite .",
    "the surface critical behaviour of the three - dimensional ising model with quenched bulk disorder has been investigated both at the ordinary @xcite and at the special transition point @xcite , using different renormalization group techniques .",
    "the crossover behaviour between these two transitions was studied recently in @xcite .",
    "interestingly , modified surface critical behaviour is encountered independently whether quenched surface disorder is present or not .",
    "the corresponding marginal case @xmath101 has also been studied in detail recently @xcite , yielding ising surface critical exponents with logarithmic corrections to scaling .",
    "boundary critical behaviour of @xmath102-state random potts models hase been studied in @xcite for @xmath103 .",
    "it should be noted that the problem of bond percolation has also been investigated in semi - infinite geometries @xcite . in this case",
    "distinct surface percolation transitions have been identified and the values of the local critical exponents have been computed .      in a series of papers",
    "aaro reis studied the dependence of physical quantities in two - dimensional ising stripes @xcite and three - dimensional ising thin films @xcite on the surface roughness . using transfer matrix methods ,",
    "reis investigated stripes where the column heights were chosen according to a gaussian distribution with mean @xmath104 ( @xmath104 : integer ) and variance @xmath105 @xcite .",
    "two different cases were considered : @xmath106 constant and @xmath107 with some constant @xmath108 . whereas the roughness becomes unimportant for large @xmath104 in the former case , in the latter case the roughness increases with the mean thickness .",
    "reis paid special attention to the finite - size scaling and to the finite - size corrections due to randomness .",
    "in @xcite he also considered the case of noninteger mean @xmath104 and showed that the free energy displays an interesting oscillating behaviour as function of continuously changing @xmath104 due to oscillations in the mean coordination number . recently",
    "@xcite , he completed his investigation of stripes of random width by studying roughness of the more general form @xmath109 with @xmath110 .",
    "he also considered correlated roughness by imposing the maximal height difference between neighbouring columns to be not larger than one lattice constant .",
    "interestingly , these computations showed that the correlations had no systematic effect on the corrections to scaling .",
    "more relevant to the understanding of the critical behaviour of real films are reis studies of films with rough surfaces @xcite . using monte carlo techniques",
    ", he studied the same kind of uncorrelated roughness as for the stripes : gaussian distribution of thicknesses with integer mean @xmath104 and @xmath106 constant for all @xmath104 or @xmath107 @xcite as well as noninteger mean @xmath104 @xcite .",
    "these studies were partly motivated by the observation that some film quantities depend on the growth condition , the different growth mechanism leading to different types of roughness .",
    "reis studied the magnetic susceptibility , the specific heat , and the total magnetisation of films with different thicknesses . especially , he showed that the simple equation ( [ gl:5_1 ] ) connecting the critical temperature of finite films with the bulk critical temperature does not hold for noninteger mean thicknesses @xmath104 , as @xmath111 shows a convex behaviour between two consecutive integer values of @xmath104 @xcite .",
    "he also studied the critical behaviour of rough films and thereby observed that the considered types of disorder are irrelevant : as for flat films , the critical exponents of the two - dimensional ising model are recovered in rough thin films .",
    "up to now only rough films with uncorrelated roughness have been studied .",
    "it would be very interesting to investigate the influence of spatial correlated roughness on the critical thin film behaviour as well .",
    "the impact of additional regular structures , located on the surface , on the critical behaviour of ising films is studied numerically in @xcite .",
    "the additional structures consist of one or two adjacent lines formed by adatoms as well as straight steps of unit height .",
    "one may introduce local couplings with different strengths , similar to what has been done in section 3.1 for the edges .",
    "for example , the strength of the bonds connecting two neighbouring adatoms in the defect line or the strength of the coupling between the adatoms and the underlying magnetic film may be varied .",
    "the main finding of @xcite is that non - universal critical behaviour is encountered in ising films with additional surface defects : the local magnetic critical exponents close to the defects depend continuously on the local couplings as well as on the layer thickness .",
    "interestingly , the presence of an additional line is already enough to change the local critical exponent of a one - layer system by a large amount .",
    "indeed , in the case where all the couplings have equal strength one obtains the value @xmath112 for the critical exponent of the local order parameter @xcite .",
    "it is worthwhile mentioning that related experiments on films with additional adatom lines have been published @xcite , even if there the lines of adatoms were not connected magnetically to the film .",
    "the magnetism of lines of @xmath113 adatoms on ag surfaces has been the subject of some theoretical studies @xcite .",
    "the magnetic behaviour of thin films with large terraces has also been analysed experimentally @xcite .    increasing the film thickness further",
    ", the semi - infinite system with surface imperfections is reached at the end .",
    "the following two typical scenarios must be distinguished : ( i ) for @xmath114 , bulk and surface order at the same temperature ( ordinary transition ) , whereas ( ii ) for @xmath115 the surface orders at a higher temperature than the bulk ( surface transition ) .",
    "@xmath59 is the critical coupling ratio of the multicritical point , see section 2.1 .",
    "therefore , a completely different behaviour of local quantities near the surface imperfections is expected in both cases when varying the number of layers @xmath104 .",
    "numerical simulations of non - perfect films are in complete agreement with this expectation @xcite . for @xmath114 the surface critical exponent @xmath116",
    "is obtained in the limit @xmath117 everywhere on the surface , independently of any additional surface structure , as discussed already in section 4.1 . in a film the local magnetisation near",
    "the defect closely follows the local magnetisation of the corresponding semi - infinite system for low temperatures . at temperatures where the correlation length is comparable with the thickness of the film a crossover from a regime with isotropic three - dimensional fluctuations to a regime dominated by two - dimensional critical fluctuations takes place . increasing the film thickness the crossover temperatures approaches the bulk critical temperature , yielding in the limit of the semi - infinite system , @xmath117 , the value @xmath118 for the critical exponent of the local magnetisation .",
    "choosing @xmath115 , non - universal local critical behaviour close to the adchain is expected at the surface transition even in the limit @xmath117 .",
    "this situation is indeed comparable to that of an edge at the surface transition , the edge corresponding to an extended defect line as discussed in section 3.2 .",
    "the local magnetic critical exponents should therefore depend continuously on the local couplings at the additional line .",
    "this has been studied in @xcite by examining the case @xmath119 .",
    "the results obtained show that near an additional line @xmath120 is affected both by the values of the local couplings and by the presence of additional bulk - like layers leading to non - universal local critical behaviour .",
    "further results have been obtained for systems with a straight step on top of film . at the ordinary transition ,",
    "a straight step on top of a semi - infinite system does not change the local critical exponents @xcite . in thin films",
    "the critical behaviour is however quite different @xcite . introducing a straight step by adding half a layer of magnetic adatoms to the surface of the magnetic film one observes two sharp peaks in the specific heat @xcite , see figure [ fig_dirt_2 ] , pointing to the existence of two different phase transitions .",
    "in fact , when considering a system with one half layer on top of a film one is dealing with a composite system displaying in the thermodynamic limit two distinct phase transitions at two different temperatures . consider for simplicity the case of a single layer plus half a layer .",
    "one phase transition then takes place at the critical temperature of the 2d ising model , @xmath121 and one at the critical temperature of the double layer , @xmath122 .",
    "the value of the critical exponent of the step magnetisation at the higher temperature phase transition is 1/2 , i.e.  is identical to the value of the surface critical exponent of the two - dimensional ising model . at the lower critical temperature",
    "the single semi - infinite layer then orders in presence of ordered surface spins , the ordered double layer acting at that transition as a surface field .",
    "one is therefore dealing with the normal transition .",
    "the same scenario is expected to hold for finite films with an additional half layer with @xmath123 , yielding at @xmath124 the critical exponent 1/2 near the step edge , in accordance with the numerical findings of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "note that very recently @xcite , two sharp susceptibilities peaks observed experimentally in thin films with large terraces have been interpreted as the signatures of two distinct phase transitions .",
    "thin films with an additional terrace covering half of the surface are only one example of composite systems displaying two distinct phase transitions .",
    "further examples include two - dimensional ising models with a defect column where the bonds differ on the two sides of the column @xcite , ising quantum chains where couplings and transverse fields differ in the two half chains @xcite , or layered magnetic systems consisting of thin layers of coupled ising spins with @xmath125 and @xmath126 @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "wetting phenomena were studied in models consisting of two semi - infinite systems with unequal critical temperatures connected by a defect plane .",
    "finally , let us briefly mention that in the context of spin systems with continuous spin symmetry thin films with selected surface defects ( amorphisation of the surface layer @xcite or steps @xcite ) have been considered in some cases , but no systematic study of the critical behaviour of this kind of systems has been done up to now .",
    "surface criticality has been the subject of intensive studies in the last thirty years .",
    "thereby a large variety of different methods ( analytical , numerical , and experimental ) has been used , yielding a host of interesting results , as reviewed in this work .",
    "critical phenomena at perfect surfaces are now in general well understood , at least when dealing with static critical quantities .",
    "this is not really the case for dynamic critical behaviour at surfaces for which a coherent picture has not yet emerged .",
    "a major problem in this context is the total lack of experimental studies on surface dynamic properties at criticality .",
    "the situation is also not very satisfactory from the theoretical point of view , as only selected results on equilibrium and non - equilibrium surface dynamic behaviour at criticality have been published . clearly , this is one of the most important aspects of surface criticality that warrants more attention in the future .",
    "wedge - shaped geometries , which can be viewed as generalisations of semi - infinite systems , have also been discussed in detail in this review .",
    "it is encouraging that the effect of curved surfaces on the local critical behaviour has been observed in simulations of liquid - vapour transitions near a weakly attractive surface .",
    "this may point to possible experimental systems where this kind of problems can be studied .",
    "there are indeed a vast number of theoretical predictions for this kind of geometry , and experimental investigations are therefore welcomed .    in the last years",
    "the focus of research on surface criticality has somehow shifted , as the main emphasis has been on more realistic surfaces .",
    "the facts that real surfaces are usually rough , displaying a variety of different surface defects , and that experimental physicists can create artificial structures on top of a surface directly lead to the question whether these quantities have an impact on local critical behaviour . we have presented a comprehensive overview of the field , thereby discussing in detail critical behaviour in semi - infinite systems with surface defects as well as in thin films with additional surface structures .",
    "some common surface defects have been shown to be irrelevant for the surface critical behaviour at the ordinary transition .",
    "there are however some interesting exceptions , as for example the case of self - affine rough surfaces .",
    "the situation is even more complex at the surface transition where in a three - dimensional system the critical fluctuations are of two - dimensional nature . indeed",
    ", additional structures as steps or lines of adatoms have been shown in numerical studies to lead to non - universal local critical behaviour where the values of the local critical exponents reflect the strengths of the coupling constants as well as the presence of the disordered bulk .",
    "it is worth noting that in thin films this kind of additional surface structures in general leads to non - universal critical behaviour .",
    "it is obvious from our overview that a large number of recent studies of the effects of surface defects on the local critical behaviour are either of purely numerical nature or are using rather crude approximations .",
    "this is especially the case when dealing with non - perfect surfaces at the surface transition .",
    "there is a need for more elaborate analytical approaches , and it is one of the intention of this review to encourage further theoretical ( and also experimental ) investigations of critical phenomena at non - perfect surfaces .    it is a pleasure to thank all my collaborators who worked with me on various aspects of surface criticality : f.   .",

    "<S> it is therefore important to clarify whether these defects are relevant or irrelevant for the surface critical behaviour .    </S>",

    "<S> special attention is thereby paid to new developments as for example the study of surface critical behaviour in systems with competing interactions or of surface critical dynamics . in the second part </S>",
    "<S> the effect of surface defects ( presence of edges , steps , quenched randomness , lines of adatoms , regular geometric patterns ) on local critical behaviour in semi - infinite systems and in thin films is discussed in detail . whereas most of the defects commonly encountered are shown to be irrelevant , some notable exceptions are highlighted . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown furthermore that under certain circumstances non - universal local critical behaviour may be observed at surfaces . </S>"
