    "there are six cubic invariants ; three trivial ones @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 , and three nontrivial ones @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 these can also , in principle , be added to the hamiltonian , but resulting proliferation of parameters would make the problem intractable , and for that reason we neglect them here .",

    "any given magnetization can be realized by a large number of ( continuously degenerate ) spin configurations . within our model , the energy of these states",
    "is uniquely determined by the second order invarients @xmath97 .",
    "therefore , by mapping out the extrema of these invariants , we exhaust all possible ground states selected by four spin interactions @xmath98 .",
    "doing so enables us not only to confirm the results of the stability analysis above , but to make some further observations about the magnetization process @xmath99 and possible first order transitions .",
