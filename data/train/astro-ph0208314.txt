    "the resonance lines of he  i ( at 584.3  ) and he  ii ( at 303.8  ) show unusual behaviour when compared with other strong emission lines in solar euv spectra .",
    "reviews of observations of the helium resonance lines and attempts to model their formation can be found in hammer and macpherson & jordan ( hereafter mj99 ) , but the details relevant to the present work are summarized here .",
    "early observations ( e.g.  tousey 1967 ) showed that the helium resonance lines are reduced significantly in intensity in coronal holes compared with the average quiet sun , while other lines formed at similar temperatures show only very small reductions in intensity . in the quiet sun , the helium resonance line intensities are too large to be reproduced by emission measure distributions that account for other transition region ( tr ) lines , a problem identified by jordan ( 1975 ) , who found disagreements by factors of 15 for he  i and 6 for he  ii .",
    "corresponding factors of at least 10 and 13 , respectively , were found by mj99 .",
    "radiative transfer calculations have also been unable to reproduce the observed resonance line intensities without invoking either a ` plateau ' in the model atmosphere ( see e.g. vernazza , avrett & loeser 1981 ; andretta & jones 1997 ) , which leads to other lines formed in the lower tr being over - estimated @xcite , or some departure from equilibrium ( e.g.  fontenla , avrett & loeser 1993 ; avrett 1999 ) .",
    "these results have been taken to imply that some process preferentially enhances the helium resonance line intensities with respect to other lines formed in the tr in the quiet sun , and that the enhancement is reduced in coronal holes .",
    "recent results from the solar and heliospheric observatory ( _ soho _ ) show that the helium resonance line intensities are reduced by factors of 1.52.0 ( peter 1999 ; jordan , macpherson & smith 2001 ) in coronal holes .",
    "many possible enhancement processes have been investigated , but a completely convincing explanation has not yet been found .",
    "the effects of photoionization by coronal radiation have been suggested as a natural explanation of the coronal hole / quiet sun contrast @xcite , and photoionization - recombination ( pr ) appears to be important in the formation of some lines in the helium spectrum ( he  ii 1640.4    wahlstrm & carlsson 1994 , he  i 10830    andretta & jones 1997 ) .",
    "although pr probably contributes to the formation of the he  i 584.3-  line , evidence @xcite suggests that the he  ii 303.8-  line and , to a lesser extent , the 584.3-  line , are formed principally by collisional excitation . if this is the case , then because the helium resonance lines have unusually large values of @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the excitation energy , their collisional contribution functions are sensitive to excitation by suprathermal electrons .",
    "any process exposing helium ions to larger populations of suprathermal electrons than in equilibrium will tend to increase the collisional excitation rates of the helium lines , while lines with smaller @xmath1 will be relatively unaffected .",
    "two processes by which this might occur were suggested by jordan ( 1975,1980 ) : the transport of high energy electrons from the upper tr or corona to the lower tr , or the transport of he atoms and ions by turbulent motions to regions of higher electron temperature .",
    "both processes would be expected to depend on the magnitude of the temperature gradient , which could explain the coronal hole / quiet sun contrast , since munro & withbroe found d@xmath3d@xmath4 to be an order of magnitude smaller inside coronal holes .",
    "shoub investigated the former process in his study of the shape of the electron velocity distribution function ( evdf ) in the transition region .",
    "his calculations suggested that evdfs in the lower tr should have more heavily populated suprathermal tails than the local maxwellian distribution .",
    "he found that this could lead to enhanced collisional excitation and ionization in helium , but did not calculate intensities to compare with observations .",
    "anderson , raymond & ballegooijen ( 1996 ) did calculate intensities for the he  ii resonance line under excitation by several different non - maxwellian evdfs , and found enhancements over maxwellian collisional excitation , but their calculations could not reproduce the observed intensities of all the lines they studied simultaneously .",
    "radiative transfer calculations of the helium resonance line intensities using evdfs approximating those derived by shoub ( 1982,1983 ) have been performed , and are reported in a companion paper ( smith , in preparation ",
    "hereafter paper ii ) .",
    "the calculations suggest that the he  i and he  ii resonance line intensities could be increased by non - maxwellian collisional excitation , but that this process would produce signatures in the line ratios that contradict observations .",
    "the second process is the subject of this paper .",
    "the temperature gradients in the solar tr are such that velocities of order 10 km s@xmath5 could carry material into regions of significantly higher electron temperature .",
    "such mixing could be caused by non - thermal motions in the tr that can be inferred from observations of the excess widths of optically thin lines ( e.g.  berger , bruner & stevens 1970 ; boland et al .  1973 ; doschek et al .",
    "1976 ; chae , schhle & lemaire 1998 .",
    "see also section [ sec2.3 ] ) .",
    "helium ions would reach statistical equilibrium at the new local temperature much more slowly than the bulk of the material owing to their long excitation and ionization times .",
    "the helium resonance lines would be excited collisionally at higher temperatures and hence with greater rates than would be the case in statistical equilibrium at the temperatures determining the ground state populations , while other transition region lines are relatively unaffected .",
    "jordan investigated the effects of the process on the he  ii 303.8-  line , and a more extensive study has been made recently by andretta et al .  , who termed the process ` velocity redistribution . '",
    "this work represents the application of similar methods to more specific examples of temperature gradients , which are no longer assumed to be constant over the path of the moving clump of plasma .",
    "a new treatment is used for the mean lifetime of the helium ground state , and the analysis is extended to the cases of the he  i 584.3-and 537.0-  lines in a first approximation .    in section [ sec2 ]",
    "earlier work on non - thermal transport of helium is reviewed , and the methods and atmospheric parameters used here to calculate the enhancements of the helium line intensities are introduced . in section [ sec3 ] the calculations of the velocity redistribution enhancement factors for the 303.8-  line and",
    "the 584.3-  and 537.0-  lines are described in detail .",
    "the possible effects of non - maxwellian electron distributions in the transition region on the calculations are assessed . in section [ sec4 ]",
    "the results of the calculations are discussed .",
    "the derived enhancement factors are compared with the results of mj99 , to determine whether the process can explain quantitatively the anomalously large helium line intensities .",
    "more qualitative comparisons are made with observations of the spatial variations of the helium line intensities in the quiet sun with respect to each other and to other transition region lines .",
    "comparisons are also made with the results of a separate investigation into the possibility that the helium resonance line intensities are enhanced by excitation by non - local suprathermal electrons ( paper ii ) .",
    "jordan ( 1980 ) investigated the enhancement that would occur in the he  ii 303.8-  line intensity if the line were collisionally excited at a higher temperature than that appropriate to conditions of statistical equilibrium .",
    "starting at an initial temperature of @xmath6 k , she assumed that he  ii ions are carried up the temperature gradient at the local non - thermal ( macroturbulent ) velocity derived from the excess widths observed in lines formed near the initial temperature .",
    "she wrote the excitation time of the ion s ground state as the reciprocal of the collisional excitation rate ( at the final temperature  see below for a discussion of this point ) . the excitation time and",
    "the non - thermal velocity were used to calculate a free path travelled by the ion before it is excited .",
    "the final temperature of excitation was then computed using a mean temperature gradient .",
    "using values of the non - thermal velocity and the temperature gradient appropriate to different regions of the atmosphere ( quiet sun , coronal holes , active regions ) , she found intensity enhancements of up to a factor of 5 .",
    "this was of the right order needed to explain the discrepancy between observed and calculated intensities reported in jordan .",
    "andretta et al .   followed the same approach for the he  ii resonance line , but instead of a using single upward non - thermal velocity , they considered an ensemble of plasma elements ( clumps ) in an isotropic turbulent velocity field with a gaussian distribution having a standard deviation equal to the root - mean - squared non - thermal velocity @xmath7 .",
    "andretta et al .  ( 2000 ) also used @xmath8 k and assumed a constant pressure in the transition region .",
    "they calculated the enhancement factor over a parameter space of @xmath9 and d@xmath3d@xmath4 appropriate to conditions in the tr , and for values of the electron pressure corresponding to quiet sun and active region conditions .",
    "enhancement factors of up to about 5 were obtained for values of the parameters typical of current models and observations of the quiet sun transition region ( @xmath10 @xmath11 k , @xmath12 km s@xmath5 , d@xmath3d@xmath13 k km@xmath5 ) . scaling arguments derived from their analysis show reasonable agreement with observations of the 303.8-  line compared with the 599.6-  line .",
    "they concluded that the process could account for at least some of the enhancement required in the 303.8-  line intensity .",
    "our calculations of the effects of non - thermal motions follow the approaches of jordan and andretta et al . , but with certain changes .",
    "the above studies used the ` coronal approximation , ' assuming that in the resonance lines radiative decay is balanced by collisional excitation .",
    "radiative transfer calculations suggest that this is certainly realistic in the case of the he  ii resonance line @xcite , so this assumption is also made here . in treating the he  i lines ,",
    "advantage is taken of information from radiative transfer calculations made using full atmospheric models .    in the coronal approximation the enhancement factor in the intensity of the 303.8-  line is given approximately by the ratio of the collisional excitation rate at the final temperature to that at the initial temperature .",
    "the collisional excitation rate @xmath14 is given by the expression @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the statistical weight of the lower level and @xmath17 is the collision strength , which is approximately constant over the temperature range of interest .",
    "the intensity enhancement ratio is therefore given approximately by @xmath18 assuming the electron pressure to be constant in the transition region , using equation ( [ eq0 ] ) , this becomes @xmath19    the final temperature @xmath20 depends on the velocity of the emitting plasma in the direction of the temperature gradient . in order to generalize the calculation of the enhancement factor to an ensemble of plasma elements",
    "andretta et al .",
    "( 2000 ) convolved equation ( [ eq2 ] ) with a normalized gaussian distribution of turbulent velocities with standard deviation @xmath21 : @xmath22 to give an intensity ratio of @xmath23      equation ( [ eq3 ] ) was used in calculations of the enhancement factors in the present work , but the free path and final temperature @xmath20 of each plasma element were computed by different methods to those used by jordan ( 1980 ) and andretta et al .",
    "these new techniques use the temperature gradient ( now allowed to change over the path of the clump of plasma ) derived from emission measure distributions found from observations of other transition region lines .",
    "specific values of @xmath24 suggested by observations were used . for the 584.3-  and 537.0-  lines of he",
    "i the excitation rate ratio in equation ( [ eq2 ] ) was also modified .    both jordan ( 1980 ) and andretta et al .",
    "( 2000 ) defined the lifetime of the ground state as @xmath25 .",
    "this provides a lower limit on the lifetime and hence on the final temperature reached by the moving plasma .",
    "this may be appropriate if ions are carried rapidly to a higher temperature and remain there until excited .",
    "here we use @xmath26 , as we consider this timescale to better reflect the dependence of the enhancement process in question on the long excitation and ionization times of the helium ions at the equilibrium temperatures of resonance line formation .",
    "it is these timescales , long with respect to those for other tr lines , which allow unresolved turbulent motions to carry helium ions to the higher temperatures where excitation occurs .",
    "@xmath27 is chosen to represent the ` normal ' temperature of resonance line formation , in the absence of non - equilibrium processes .",
    "@xmath20 is found by integrating the temperature gradient over the path traversed in time @xmath28 .",
    "the ( varying ) temperature gradient between @xmath27 and @xmath20 is derived from the mean intrinsic emission measure distribution ( emd ; see section [ sec2.3 ] ) .",
    "the intrinsic emission measure is defined as @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are electron and hydrogen number densities respectively and @xmath32 is defined as the interval of height in a plane - parallel atmosphere corresponding to @xmath33(log  @xmath34 ) = 0.3 dex , the temperature interval over which most lines are typically formed . defining electron and hydrogen pressures as @xmath35 and @xmath36 , the emission measure may be re - written as an integral over the temperature interval in which a line is formed : @xmath37 @xmath38 is the temperature at which the line contribution function peaks , and is the geometric mean of the limits of the integral , which represent a change in @xmath34 of a factor of 2 .",
    "if @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 are each averaged over the temperature range of the integral , the emission measure becomes @xmath42 the assumption of constant pressures over the region of line formation is a good one , and although the assumption of a a constant temperature gradient in the same region is less good , it is often used in constructing an initial model from the emd ( see e.g.  jordan & brown 1981 ) .",
    "if the mean emd as a function of temperature is known from several lines , the path of material travelling up the temperature gradient can be divided into smaller temperature intervals .",
    "here we use intervals of 0.1 dex in log  @xmath34 . in each of these intervals ,",
    "the mean temperature gradient is calculated from the emd , at the mean value of log  @xmath34 , using equation ( [ eq4 ] ) . in most of the temperature range of interest",
    ", hydrogen is fully ionized and @xmath43 .",
    "this is a very good approximation above log  @xmath34 = 4.9 ( i.e. in the he  ii calculation ) , and is correct to better than 10 per cent down to log  @xmath34 = 4.5 ( the temperature range of the he  i calculation ) .",
    "thus , in plane - parallel geometry , taking @xmath44 , the increment of height @xmath45 corresponding to the temperature interval @xmath33(log @xmath34 ) is given approximately by @xmath46 where @xmath47 spans the range log  @xmath48 .",
    "the travel time required by a clump of material to traverse each @xmath45 is determined by assuming a constant upward velocity @xmath49 .",
    "the definition of @xmath45 thus introduces a quantization of the ( logarithmic ) temperatures used in calculating the enhancement factor . for computational convenience",
    "this is carried over into the integration over velocities in equation ( [ eq3 ] ) . in this formulation , the integrand",
    "may only be evaluated correctly for values of @xmath20 occurring at intervals of 0.1 dex in log  @xmath34 from the initial temperature @xmath27 ( log  @xmath20 = log  @xmath27 + 0.1@xmath50 , for integer @xmath50 ) .",
    "the values of @xmath49 used as points in the integration correspond to velocities required to reach these @xmath20 in a time equal to the lifetime of the ion s ground state at @xmath27 .",
    "the velocity mesh that results introduces some uncertainty into the calculation of the enhancement factors .",
    "the emds used here to derive the variation of temperature with height in the lower tr were determined from observed line fluxes and the appropriate atomic data using now - standard methods ( see mj99 and references therein ) .",
    "mj99 derived separate emds for mean network and cell interior regions from observations of uv lines from the quiet sun transition region made using the cds ( coronal diagnostic spectrometer ) and sumer ( solar ultraviolet measurements of emitted radiation ) instruments on board _ soho_. equation ( [ eq4 ] ) , used to determine the temperature gradient from the emission measure , assumes a one - component plane - parallel atmosphere . in the network model proposed by gabriel ,",
    "open magnetic field lines are most vertical over the boundaries , but expand into the corona with a horizontal component in the cell interiors .",
    "since we adopt a plane parallel atmosphere we use the network boundary emd of mj99 as the observed emd .    of the lines observed by mj99 , those formed at temperatures below @xmath51 k ( except for he  ii )",
    "were observed with sumer , and those formed at higher temperatures ( and the helium lines ) were observed with cds .",
    "mj99 found that the relative intensities of the he  i lines observed with cds and with sumer in second order suggest that the sumer lines might need to be reduced in intensity by a factor of 1.5 if the landi et al .",
    "calibration were adopted .",
    "this would lead to the emission measure distribution below @xmath51 k , derived from the sumer lines , being lowered relative to the higher temperature part derived from the cds lines .",
    "this uncertainty inspired the use of a second emd , derived from observations of @xmath52 boo a , a g8 v star , made with the goddard high resolution spectrograph ( ghrs ) instrument on the hubble space telescope @xcite .",
    "the emd was scaled by a constant factor such that its minimum ( at 1  @xmath53 k ) fits the minimum of the network emission measure of mj99 .",
    "the resulting emd is lower , by up to an order of magnitude , at temperatures below log  @xmath54 , but is very similar to the solar emd at higher temperatures .",
    "jordan et al . found that below @xmath55 k the emission measure distributions of main sequence stars with hot coronae have approximately the same dependence on @xmath34 , which is supported by a direct linear correlation between the c  ii and c  iv emission line fluxes in such stars @xcite .",
    "capelli et al",
    ".   found that the c  ii ",
    "c  iv correlation also holds for solar observations at various spatial resolutions .",
    "the discrepancy between the _ soho _ observations and the earlier results may be due in part to the different spatial resolutions of the two instruments used ( cds and sumer ) .",
    "a more serious problem is that sumer could not observe the same location on the sun in all of the lower tr lines , or the same location at the same time as in the cds observations ( see jordan et al.2001 ) .",
    "thus there are fundamental uncertainties in the shape of the emd derived from _",
    "soho _ observations at temperatures below log  @xmath56 .",
    "the @xmath52 boo a emd was therefore used to explore the possible effects of this uncertainty on the present calculations .",
    "the solar emd derived by mj99 is hereafter referred to as emd s , and that based on the @xmath52 boo a emd is referred to as emd x ; they are shown in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "the lines observed by mj99 did not allow determination of the full emd above log  @xmath34 = 5.3 .",
    "the emds used in the present calculations above this temperature are therefore based on energy balance arguments described below ( see also jordan 2000 and philippides 1996 ) .",
    "= 3.6 in    in the lower tr , below log  @xmath57 , some non - thermal source of heating is required to account for the rising emission measure at low temperatures . in the upper tr , however ,",
    "the radiation losses are small compared with the conductive flux from the corona , and may be balanced by energy deposited by the divergence of the conductive flux , or , if that flux is conserved , by a small amount of additional heating .",
    "the emds used here were determined assuming the former to be the case above log  @xmath34 = 5.3 .",
    "the equation expressing energy balance as a function of height in this region is then @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the rate of radiative energy loss per unit volume , and @xmath60 is the classical conductive energy flux through an area @xmath61 normal to the radial co - ordinate @xmath62 .",
    "the radiation loss term is given by @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the radiative power loss in all lines and continua , as a function of temperature in a plasma of known composition .",
    "@xmath64 is calculated here using the power law fit to the radiative power loss curve adopted by philippides : @xmath65 @xmath66 is given by @xmath67 where the spitzer - hrm conductivity @xmath68 erg cm@xmath5 k@xmath70 s@xmath5 at @xmath71 k @xcite .",
    "that value is used here , as @xmath72 is only 30% smaller at @xmath73 k. energy transfer by mass motions of any kind ( including the turbulent motion assumed in the enhancement factor calculations ) is not considered in the energy balance equation used in the upper tr .",
    "combining the energy balance equation ( [ eq5 ] ) with equation ( [ eq4 ] ) for the emission measure in terms of the temperature gradient gives an expression for the logarithmic gradient of the emission measure with temperature @xcite : @xmath74    assuming forms for @xmath75 and @xmath76 , this equation may be integrated numerically from given boundary conditions to give the emission measure as a function of temperature in that part of the atmosphere where the energy balance is described by equation ( [ eq5 ] ) . in this case",
    "the electron pressure was assumed to vary according to hydrostatic equilibrium ( the use of a constant value of @xmath39 in equation ( [ eq2 ] ) in calculating the intensity enhancement is a good approximation in the lower tr , owing to its small vertical extent ) .",
    "@xmath76 was taken only to vary with the expansion with height of a spherically symmetric atmosphere ; assuming that emission comes from a uniform layer at each height , this is consistent with the use of the empirical emds derived in the plane - parallel approximation in the lower tr , because the small extent of that part of the atmosphere makes the two approaches approximately equivalent .",
    "the assumptions about @xmath76 represent a significant simplification .",
    "the emd derived below log  @xmath77 represents an average over any unresolved structure within the network boundaries , while the emd computed using equation ( [ eq8 ] ) is the ` intrinsic ' value ; they are unlikely to match at log  @xmath78 .",
    "if the calculated emission measure at log  @xmath77 is greater than the value derived from spatially averaged observations , this implies that only some fraction of the observed region is occupied by emitting material .    with the assumed forms for @xmath75 and @xmath76 ,",
    "the emd for the upper tr was determined using equation ( [ eq8 ] ) , choosing values of the emission measure , electron pressure , and coronal temperature @xmath79 at the top of the region .",
    "@xmath79 was chosen such that log  @xmath80 , as cds observations suggest that there is little material at higher temperatures in the quiet corona @xcite . for a given coronal pressure and temperature",
    ", the coronal emission measure can not exceed a certain value if the rhs of equation ( [ eq8 ] ) is to remain positive above log  @xmath77 , as is required by the observed gradient of the emd .",
    "there is hence a ` critical solution , ' with the largest possible value of the coronal emission measure which reproduces the observed minimum in the emd at log  @xmath81 .",
    "if @xmath82 is larger than this value , conduction from the corona deposits more energy in the upper tr than can be lost by radiation .",
    "the mean pressure in the boundary regions used in deriving emd s below log  @xmath77 was found by mj99 to be log  @xmath83 , with a standard deviation of @xmath84 . using a coronal pressure that reproduces this pressure ( @xmath85 @xmath11 k ) at log  @xmath77 in the critical solution gives emd ( a ) shown in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "this is lower than the observed emission measure at log  @xmath77 , suggesting that a slightly higher pressure is needed for a continuous emd through this temperature .",
    "emd ( a ) also predicts substantially less mg  ix and mg  x emission than observed by mj99 ( when the photospheric abundance of mg is used in both @xmath64 and in calculating the line intensities ) .",
    "there are problems with such a comparison , however , as the intensities used by mj99 correspond to areas defined as network boundaries in the cds transition region lines , and the details of the connection between the tr network and the corona are unknown .",
    "open field regions would be expected to expand in the corona , but the network boundaries may also contain closed field emitting regions unconnected to the corona .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] also shows emd ( b ) , a second upper tr emd calculated to give a higher transition region pressure of @xmath86 @xmath11 k , which corresponds to the largest pressures found by mj99 ( in cell interiors ) and is similar to values used in earlier models of the atmosphere ( e.g.  vernazza et al .  1981 ) .",
    "it provides a much better match to the mg  ix and mg  x data , although , as stated above , these do not provide a stringent constraint .",
    "emd ( b ) predicts an intrinsic emission measure at log  @xmath77 that is larger than the apparent ( plane - parallel ) emission measure .",
    "this discontinuity can be explained in terms of an area filling factor below log  @xmath77 ( see sim & jordan 2001 ) . for a filling factor @xmath87 ,",
    "the intrinsic emission measure below log  @xmath77 is @xmath88 where @xmath89 is shown in figure [ fig1 ] . in the theoretically derived upper tr",
    "the filling factor is assumed to be 1.0 . scaling the lower tr emd to match",
    "the upper tr emd ( b ) at log  @xmath77 suggests a filling factor in the lower tr of 0.16 ( within the area of @xmath90 3.4 arcsec@xmath91 resolved by cds ) .",
    "the continuous emd then describes the restricted areas where the filling factor is 1.0 .",
    "the lines used to find the lower tr emd are not sensitive to @xmath39 , so a similar matching procedure may be considered for any lower pressure above about @xmath92 @xmath11 k , for which the theoretical upper emd would match the observed emission measure at log  @xmath77 , with a filling factor of 1.0 .",
    "equations ( [ eq4 ] ) and ( [ eq15 ] ) show that the temperature gradient derived from @xmath93 scales as @xmath94 , but the value of @xmath87 ( i.e.  the factor by which the theoretical and observed emds differ at log  @xmath77 ) required for a continuous emd through log  @xmath77 scales as @xmath95 .",
    "if the filling factor in the lower tr is regarded as a free parameter , the distribution of d@xmath96d@xmath4 is the same for all continuous emds in which a lower tr emd is scaled to match an upper tr emd , and it is independent of the assumed pressure .",
    "the distributions of d@xmath96d@xmath4 derived in this manner for the cases of lower tr emds s and x were used in the calculations of the helium line enhancement factors . in order to investigate the effect of the possible solutions suggested by emds ( a ) and ( b ) , the calculations were performed for electron pressures representing these limits , @xmath97 @xmath11 k and @xmath86 @xmath11 k ( the lower pressure is not technically consistent with the filling factor argument , but , considering other approximations involved in the calculations , provides a useful lower limit ) . because the temperature gradients used in the enhancement factor calculations are independent of the assumed pressure , the pressure adopted influences only the excitation time .",
    "the excitation time scales as @xmath98 ; hence the velocity required to reach a given @xmath20 , @xmath99 , scales as @xmath39 .",
    "a higher pressure will therefore lead to larger @xmath99 , causing contributions from higher temperature regions to be suppressed by the gaussian term , @xmath100 , in the enhancement factor integral .",
    "the values of @xmath9 used in the integral in equation ( [ eq3 ] ) were determined from empirical relations fitted to observational data . from early rocket experiments ( e.g.berger et al .",
    "1970 ; boland et al .  1973 ) to recent results from _ soho _",
    "( e.g.  chae et al .  1998 ;",
    "peter 2001 ) , solar observations of optically thin tr lines have shown widths in excess of those due to thermal motion at the temperatures at which the lines are thought to form .",
    "the non - thermal component of the broadening could be due to unresolved upflows and downflows , to acoustic or mhd waves , or to small scale turbulence .",
    "we interpret the non - thermal widths in the tr as evidence of turbulent motions of unspecified origin .",
    "since the line profiles are approximately gaussian , assuming a gaussian distribution of non - thermal velocities allows the most probable turbulent velocity @xmath52 to be extracted from the line width using the expression @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the full width at half maximum , @xmath103 is the wavelength of the line , @xmath104 is the ion temperature of line formation , and @xmath105 the mass of the emitting ion .",
    "the mean squared non - thermal velocity @xmath106 is given by the relation @xmath107 .",
    "up to log  @xmath108 , both recent _ soho _ measurements of @xmath109 @xcite and earlier measurements ( see jordan 1991 ) are fitted quite well by the relation @xmath110 , which would be expected if a wave flux from lower regions were conserved through the transition region to be dissipated at greater heights .",
    "the values of @xmath111 used in the present study are found using @xmath112 the value of @xmath109 and hence @xmath113 used to characterize the velocity field in each calculation was taken to be the value given by equation ( [ eq17 ] ) at the initial temperature @xmath27 .",
    "peter has found that some transition region lines ( forming in the temperature range @xmath114  log  @xmath115 ) can be fitted more precisely with two gaussian components .",
    "the widths of the core components are similar to those found by chae et al .",
    "( 1998 ) ; the widths of the broad components are significantly larger , but are also consistent with @xmath116 .",
    "peter interprets the broad components as evidence of the passage of magnetoacoustic waves in coronal funnels in the network .",

    "these discrepancies could also be explained by the factors found here .",
    "similar arguments hold for the 537.0-  line , for which an enhancement of a factor of up to about 25 is predicted by the calculations presented here .",
    "it is interesting that greater enhancement factors are predicted for the 537.0-  line than for the 584.3-  line , as radiative transfer calculations using the val models @xcite show the predicted ratio @xmath0(537.0  )/@xmath0(584.3   ) to be smaller than observed .",

    "1997 calibration of cds ; @xmath127 using the brekke et al .",
    "2000 calibration ) , but calculations using the val models give values of about 0.08 .",
    "enhancements of the two lines in the ratio derived here would help resolve this disagreement .",
    "radiative transfer calculations using a model atmosphere based on emd s produce a value of 0.117 ( paper ii ) ; the enhancements predicted here would therefore worsen agreement with observations .",
    "nevertheless , the enhancement factors calculated here give an intensity ratio much closer to that observed than do radiative transfer calculations of the effects of non - local suprathermal electrons which produce enhancement factors of the same order ( paper ii ) .",
    "in the formulation used here , the efficiency of the non - thermal transport process increases with decreasing pressure .",
    "for example , the predicted 303.8-  and 584.3-  line intensity enhancements are increased by about 30 per cent when the pressure is reduced by a factor of 3 .",
    "this would appear to conflict with observations of coronal holes , where electron pressures are lower than in the quiet sun by factors of 2  3 @xcite , but where helium line intensities ( and required enhancements ) are smaller .",
    "however , the energy balance adopted here in the upper tr ( equation ( [ eq5 ] ) ) takes no account of the fast solar wind and the term in @xmath61 does not allow for super - radial expansion . for non - thermal transport calculations appropriate to coronal holes ,",
    "energy balance calculations specifically for coronal holes are required ; these could be combined with observed emds in a similar manner to that described here .",
    "further observations of the helium lines in coronal holes on the disk would be useful ( to avoid the problems of limb darkening / brightening seen in polar coronal holes ) .",
    "it would also be interesting to investigate non - thermal transport in active regions ( for which andretta et al .",
    "2000 predict smaller enhancements ) , where electron pressures are higher and turbulent velocities lower than in the quiet sun .",
    "turbulent transport could help explain the spatial variations of the intensities of the helium lines with respect to each other and to other tr lines in the quiet sun .",
    "the increases in the heights of peak line formation predicted here are not large enough to be resolved directly at the limb , but the effects of the increased _ temperatures _ of emission may perhaps be seen in observations of the network , the appearance of which changes between the low and high tr .",
    "the turbulent motions of the largely ionized gas would be influenced by the direction of the network field , so that material moving to greater heights would trace the expansion of the network ( see e.g.  gabriel 1976 ) .",
    "the width and the contrast of the network observed in the and lines seem to resemble that seen in high tr lines like those of ne  vi ( log  @xmath128 ) and ne  vii ( log  @xmath129 ) , rather than that seen in lower tr lines of c  ii ( log  @xmath130 ) , c  iii ( 4.9 ) , or even o  iii ( 5.05 ) , o  iv ( 5.25 ) or o  v ( 5.4 ) @xcite .",
    "patsourakos et al .",
    "( 1999 ) found that gabriel s ( 1976 ) model predicts a network width which increases with temperature , reaching the width observed in helium at log  @xmath131 .",
    "the present calculations predict he  i emission to peak at log  @xmath132 , and he  ii emission to peak at log  @xmath81 , but with significant contributions in each case from temperatures up to log  @xmath133 .",
    "there is little contribution to intensity above log  @xmath134 , but the calculations assume different pressures and temperature gradients ( and overall geometry ) to those in the gabriel ( 1976 ) model , making quantitative comparisons difficult .",
    "qualitatively , however , turbulent transport in an expanding network could explain why the pattern of helium emission resembles that seen in lines formed in equilibrium at higher temperatures and heights . in a similar geometry , suprathermal electrons streaming down the field lines from the upper tr would be expected to be funnelled into the network in the low tr , which would concentrate any enhanced helium emission in the centre of the network , which would be less consistent with the observed width of the network .",
    "turbulent transport of helium in an expanding network is also qualitatively consistent with observed variations in the ratio of the intensities of the lines , @xmath0(537.0  )/@xmath0(584.3   ) .",
    "the excitation rate ratio for the 537.0-  line peaks at a slightly higher temperature and falls off more slowly at higher temperatures than for the 584.3-  line .",
    "this suggests that the network could appear wider in the 537.0-  line than in the 584.3-  line , which is broadly consistent with rastered images in the two lines ( mj99 ) , although further observations of the two lines would be useful .",
    "the ratio @xmath0(537.0  )/@xmath0(584.3   ) would be expected to increase towards the edges of the network , but the variation would be relatively small , since the ratio of the enhancement factors of the two lines changes by only 25 per cent between log  @xmath34 = 4.8 and log  @xmath34 = 5.7 .",
    "this factor is consistent with values of the ratio observed by mj99 , who found only small variations of the ratio , but a consistent increase in the ratio in regions of smaller absolute intensity .",
    "enhanced excitation by non - local suprathermal electrons in the low tr would tend to produce a larger variation in the opposite sense with absolute intensities ( paper ii ) .    in a more refined approach to turbulent transport calculations",
    ", improvements could be made to the simple geometry adopted here .",
    "flux tubes with various inclinations could be modelled , allowing a more quantitative examination of how the spatial variation of helium emission may be affected .",
    "mj99 found steeper temperature gradients in cell interiors than in the network , but these gradients may be _ across _ magnetic structures . in the expanding network picture ,",
    "the temperature gradient _ along the field _ is smaller , which would reduce the enhancement factor , as would the higher pressures found by mj99 in cell interiors .",
    "the greater helium line enhancements required by mj99 s observations in cell interiors could possibly be caused by photon scattering from the boundaries ; radiative transfer using two - component model atmospheres is needed to test this point .    as described in section [ sec3.3 ] , even significantly non - maxwellian evdfs",
    "are expected to have relatively little effect on turbulent transport of helium in the quiet sun .",
    "as enhancements of the helium line intensities by non - thermal motions occur at temperatures much higher than the normal temperature of peak line formation , and enhancement by non - local suprathermal electrons occurs largely at lower temperatures ( paper ii ) , the two processes could be operating simultaneously .",
    "if non - thermal motions do produce the enhancement factors calculated here , these would dominate over the effects of non - local electrons , provided departures from maxwellian evdfs are realistic ( paper ii ) .",
    "the present calculations do not include radiative transfer , which could have significant effects on , but which would be less important for .",
    "radiative transfer calculations including non - thermal motions ( and possibly non - maxwellian evdfs as well ) are needed to place our conclusions on a firmer footing .",
