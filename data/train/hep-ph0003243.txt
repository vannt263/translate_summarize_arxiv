    "totally inclusive deep - inelastic scattering ( dis ) in the past years provided us with rather precise knowledge of the distribution functions of the proton and the neutron , helping us to understand their inner structure and raising questions yet unanswered .",
    "semi - inclusive dis displays even richer characteristics . detecting at least one of the hadrons produced in the high - energy scattering process and measuring its momentum ,",
    "one is then sensitive not only to the distribution of partons inside the target hadron , but also to the mechanism of hadronization , through which a quark gives rise to a jet of new hadrons .",
    "we are then able to measure not only the distribution functions , but also the so - called fragmentation functions . neither the distribution nor the fragmentation functions can be calculated from first principles within perturbative qcd , because they belong to the non - perturbative realm of bound states .",
    "therefore , models are required .",
    "if only the dominant light - cone component of the momentum of the outgoing hadron is measured , its transverse components being integrated over , then the structure functions appearing in cross - sections will be products of a distribution and a fragmentation function .",
    "the already established knowledge of the distribution functions enables one to extract the shape of the fragmentation functions  ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) and to compare it with other results coming from different experiments , such as electron - positron annihilation .    on the other hand ,",
    "if we manage to measure the transverse momentum of the outgoing hadron we have the opportunity to study some new interesting distribution and fragmentation functions . in particular , already to leading order in an expansion in powers of @xmath4 we have access to chiral odd and time - reversal odd functions , as well as functions related to the transverse momentum carried by quarks relative to their parent hadrons momentum  @xcite .",
    "these functions are presently considered to be very interesting and their experimental measurement is in progress ( hermes , compass , rhic ) .",
    "the only major inconvenience of dealing with cross sections differential in the transverse momentum of the outgoing hadron is that the structure functions are no more simple products of a distribution and a fragmentation function , but rather convolutions of those .    in this",
    "context model evaluations of the structure functions can be very useful .",
    "the spectator model proved to be in qualitative agreement with the known ( transverse momentum integrated ) distribution and fragmentation functions evolved at low energies @xcite .",
    "therefore , we expect it to give reasonable estimates for the convolution integrals in semi - inclusive dis , provided that the inclusion of transverse momentum of partons does not spoil factorization properties , as it is usually assumed @xcite .",
    "we are aware that our results can not be considered as precise predictions of experimental quantities , because of the limitations and the simplicity of the model .",
    "the model incorporates only valence quark distribution and fragmentation , neglecting the presence of sea - quarks , gluons and evolution .",
    "therefore , it is supposed to reproduce the shape of the valence - quark distribution and fragmentation at a low energy scale , which is not known a priori . to give an estimate of this scale , one can compare the total momentum carried by quarks as given by the spectator model with the same quantity as given by parameterizations of the distribution functions at a known energy scale .",
    "such a comparison suggests that the spectator model is valid at an energy scale of about 0.2 - 0.3 gev .    in principle ,",
    "the results we obtain need to be evolved to higher energy scales by means of evolution equations for a final comparison with experiment .",
    "evolution equations for transverse momentum dependent functions are not yet known . in this article , therefore , we refrain from taking into account radiative corrections .",
    "nevertheless , we are confident to describe correctly the main features and properties of the structure functions at low ( intrinsic ) transverse momentum , since perturbative corrections are expected to affect mainly the high transverse momentum tails of these functions .",
    "the spectator model is a semi - phenomenological model , which relies mainly on the idea of describing the hadron as an ensemble of a free parton ( struck in the scattering process ) and a fictitious , unphysical particle , the spectator , with the right quantum numbers .",
    "the model , at least in its present version , can not describe time - reversal odd functions , since it does not incorporate final state interactions . on the other hand ,",
    "the advantages of the model resides in the fact that it is simple , it is covariant and it gives a clear estimate of the distribution of partonic transverse momentum .",
    "last but non least , the model can be treated in wide parts analytically .",
    "some numerical integrations are required only when the cross section is kept differential also in the transverse momentum of the produced hadron .    in sec .",
    "[ s : sidis ] we briefly review the general formalism utilized to treat semi - inclusive dis , with emphasis on the structure functions calculable using the spectator model . in sec .",
    "[ s : main ] we present the basic properties of the model and we give the results of our analysis , highlighting what are the broad features that could possibly be observed in experiments .",
    "the cross section for a semi - inclusive dis event can be written in terms of the contraction between a lepton and a hadron tensor .",
    "for instance in the target rest frame we can make use of the formula @xcite @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the momentum of the outgoing hadron,@xmath7 is the absolute value of the virtuality of the exchanged photon , @xmath8 is the fine structure constant , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the energy of the incident lepton before and after the collision , respectively .",
    "@xmath11 is the lepton tensor and @xmath12 is the hadronic tensor .",
    "following a purely phenomenological approach , the hadronic tensor can be parameterized using scalar structure functions .",
    "a priori , the maximum number of independent structure functions in an arbitrary dis process is 16 . since we will be interested only in electromagnetic scattering ,",
    "this number is reduced to 9 by the gauge invariance condition , @xmath13 .",
    "a convenient set of functions is formed by the spherical basis structure functions ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .    in the spherical basis ,",
    "constraints coming from angular momentum conservation take a simpler form . from now on ,",
    "we want to consider only leading terms in an expansion over @xmath4 . in the case of polarized semi - inclusive scattering ,",
    "helicity conservation considerations allow us to say that five of the structure functions vanish at leading order , leaving only four non - zero structure functions .",
    "the complete form of the hadronic tensor at leading order is then @xmath14 where the curly brackets indicate symmetrization of the indices . for the definitions of the tensor structures appearing in the formula we need to define a normalized time - like and a normalized space - like vector @xmath15 by means of which we can define the structures @xmath16    by calculating the contraction between leptonic and hadronic tensor we can eventually write the following formula for the cross section @xcite in the target rest - frame : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the helicity of the electron , @xmath19 is the angle between the scattering plane and the outgoing hadron s momentum ( see fig .  [",
    "f : beta ] ) and where @xmath20 @xmath21 being the scattering angle of the electron .",
