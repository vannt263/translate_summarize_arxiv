    "inflation @xcite is currently the most promising candidate to solve many cosmological problems .",
    "it is , however , still unclear yet how to implement a consistent and successful scenario in the context of string theory .",
    "fortunately , after the de sitter vacua construction in type iib theory @xcite , there have been considerable advances to this end for recent years @xcite .",
    "an inflaton candidate of particular interest is the string axion , which is known to exist abundantly in string theory , and they have flat potentials even after all the moduli are stabilised .    in this paper , we study a simple inflation model which consists of two axion fields .",
    "since there are plenty of axions , it is not difficult to construct an inflation model with the number of @xmath0-folds far larger than 60 using many fields .",
    "as inflation proceeds , however , fewer and fewer fields are responsible for inflation because heavy fields drop out of the inflationary regime and contribute no more .",
    "thus , it is very conceivable that in the final stage of inflation , i.e. the last 60 @xmath0-folds relevant for the observable universe , significantly smaller number of fields drive inflation . in this regard ,",
    "it is natural to consider the simplest two - field model first which is considered important in building inflation models with multiple fields @xcite .",
    "this paper is outlined as follows . in section  [ secpotential ]",
    "we briefly review the potential of two axion fields . in section  [ secinflation ]",
    "we study the dependence of the number of @xmath0-folds on the parameters of the potential and the density perturbations produced during inflation . in section  [ secremedies ] we discuss how the problems associated with the simplest model could be alleviated . in section  [ summary ] we give a brief summary .",
    "as mentioned in the previous section , we will be interested in the two - field case , so the potential is written as @xmath1 + \\lambda_\\psi^4 \\left [ 1 + \\cos \\left ( \\frac{2\\pi\\psi}{f_\\psi } \\right ) \\right ] \\",
    ", , \\ ] ] where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the dynamically generated axion potential scales , and @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the axion decay constants .",
    "we expect both @xmath6 and @xmath7 are smaller than @xmath8 , especially the potential scale could be significantly so .",
    "there are many maxima , minima and saddle points , and they lead to a very rich structure of the potential depending on the values of the parameters .",
    "we illustrate a region of the potential in fig .",
    "[ figpotential ]    for simplicity , we concentrate on @xmath9 and @xmath10 , and occasionally we will omit the subscripts . then from above we can write the hubble parameter as @xmath11 near an extremum point , the effective mass is given by @xmath12 .",
    "hence @xmath13 i.e. the mass is very heavy and therefore the slow - roll condition @xmath14 is badly broken .",
    "to compute the evolution of the scalar field on the potential given by eq .",
    "( [ potential ] ) , it is convenient to modify the equations of motion for @xmath15 and @xmath16 and to eliminate the scale factor @xmath17 . using @xmath18 , we can derive the equations in terms of the number of @xmath0-folds @xmath19 as @xmath20 where a prime denotes a derivative with respect to @xmath19 , @xmath21 and the indices @xmath22 and @xmath23 denote the canonical fields ] where @xmath24 is the metric of the field space , the equations are given by @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the christoffel symbol constructed by @xmath24 . ]",
    "@xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "now we study the trajectory of the field starting from a maximum of the potential .",
    "when the field is about to roll down the potential from a maximum , we need to specify two quantities , namely , the displacement ( how far is the field off from the maximum ? ) and the misalignment ( where is the field heading for ? ) .",
    "it is plausible to expect that due to quantum fluctuations the field is off the maximum by an amplitude of @xmath27 . for the misalignment @xmath28 , which should be written as @xmath29 first we note that near a maximum we have an approximate @xmath30 symmetry .",
    "hence we can infer that as long as there is enough time for the field to get arbitrary orientation , every direction is equivalent near a maximum . to estimate this time",
    ", we note that the field is placed away from the maximum by @xmath31 .",
    "therefore , we can change the question to ask how long it takes for the field to get randomly placed on a circle of radius @xmath31 . to have inflation , we require that @xmath32 and hence @xmath33 thus , we can estimate @xmath34 i.e. the field is randomly placed almost instantaneously .    some results of the numerical evolution of the field according to eq .",
    "( [ fieldeq ] ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ fieldfig ] .",
    "the left panel shows the field evolution along @xmath15 and @xmath16 directions when @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and the initial misalignment @xmath37 .",
    "note that the initial misalignment is very small from @xmath38 , the field rolls towards a saddle point and hence @xmath15 settles down at a minimum first .",
    "this is clearly seen from several trajectories shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fieldfig ] .",
    "[ efoldfig ] illustrates the dependence of the number of @xmath0-folds on the energy scale @xmath39 and the decay constant @xmath40 .",
    "one interesting thing is that locked inflationary phase @xcite hardly occurs .",
    "this could be seen from the fact that there is no interaction term in the potential , e.g. , such as @xmath41 .",
    "thus the oscillation of , say , @xmath15 is not transmitted to the effective mass of @xmath16 to hold the field at a saddle point .",
    "note that even if we include an interaction term of the form @xmath42 this term is suppressed by @xmath43 and does not lead to any significant change .",
    "also we note that the dependence of the number of @xmath0-folds on the initial misalignment @xmath28 @xcite is very weak .",
    "we are considering @xmath44 , and the slow - roll parameter @xmath45 , see eq .",
    "( [ sreta ] ) .",
    "hence the field is very quickly rolling , and this makes the total number of @xmath0-folds more or less the same irrespective of the initial misalignment @xmath28 . in table",
    "[ tabangdep ] , we present several results depending on @xmath28 .",
    ".several results depending on different initial misalignment @xmath28 .",
    "parameters are given by @xmath46 and @xmath36 .",
    "note that the number of @xmath0-folds varies less than 1 .",
    "[ cols= \" > , < , < , < , < ,",
    "< , < \" , ]     [ tabangdep ]    now let us turn our attention to the perturbations produced during inflation . at the early stage of inflation when the field is very close to a maximum , we can split the field into the radial and angular components - folds is large enough by e.g. some mechanism discussed in section  [ secremedies ] and the perturbations produced when the field is around a maximum is far outside the horizon , then this decomposition may complicate the matter . in this case , one can just write @xcite @xmath47 to calculate the power spectrum of the adiabatic perturbations after inflation . ]",
    "@xmath48 and @xmath28 , i.e. @xmath49 and @xmath28 as eq .",
    "( [ ang ] ) . note that near a maximum , @xmath30 symmetry is good enough .",
    "the radial component @xmath48 thus plays the role of the  inflaton \" , yielding adiabatic perturbations , while the angular component @xmath28 is orthogonal to the field trajectory and its fluctuations correspond to the isocurvature perturbations .",
    "therefore the radial fluctuations follow the form of those from the usual inverted quadratic potential @xcite , but the angular ones are very close to those of massless scalar field and the spectrum is nearly scale invariant @xcite . now",
    ", we can follow the @xmath50 formalism @xcite to write the power spectrum of the primordial density perturbations as @xmath51 where it is clear that both the adiabatic and the isocurvature components contribute to the final perturbations .",
    "for the isocurvature perturbations to dominate the primordial perturbations , we require that @xmath52 since the adiabatic component is boosted by a factor of @xmath53 , generally we need @xmath54 , i.e. , the number of @xmath0-folds is highly dependent on where the field is rolling towards .",
    "but as we have seen in table  [ tabangdep ] , the number of @xmath0-folds is more or less the same irrespective of the misalignment .",
    "thus @xmath55 so the contribution of the isocurvature component is negligible , and the density perturbation spectrum is completely dominated by the contribution of the inflaton component which is highly scale dependent .    now let us consider the case when @xmath56 , i.e. the potential is not symmetric but `` squeezed '' .",
    "then , the field tends to roll along the squeezed direction first irrespective of the initial misalignment , because that direction is ( much ) steeper than the other one .",
    "hence the isocurvature perturbations , i.e. the perturbations orthogonal to the field trajectory , become irrelevant and the  inflaton \" perturbations are dominant .",
    "let us assume that @xmath16 direction is squeezed so that @xmath57 with @xmath58 . with the rotated slow - roll parameters @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath61 denote the inflaton and the isocurvature components respectively , the evolution of the isocurvature perturbations is given by @xcite @xmath62 h\\mathcal{s } \\nonumber \\\\ & \\simeq \\left ( -2\\epsilon - \\frac{\\alpha^2 - 1}{\\alpha^2 } \\frac{m_\\mathrm{pl}^2}{f_\\psi^2 } \\right ) h\\mathcal{s } \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is always negative .",
    "intuitively , as a direction becomes more and more squeezed , the potential becomes closer to the single field case where only the inflaton perturbations exist .",
    "in the previous section , we have seen that the number of @xmath0-folds obtained during inflation driven by two decoupled string axion fields is generally not enough to solve many cosmological problems .",
    "also the power spectrum of density perturbations is completely dominated by the radial contribution which is not scale invariant .",
    "the naive inflation model of the two string axions is thus not sufficient and we need some amendments to improve the situation . in this section",
    "we briefly summarise some known remedies .",
    "one obvious modification is to add more contribution to @xmath31 so that the field receives greater friction and can roll down the potential slowly .",
    "one would be tempted to add a positive cosmological constant , but this may cause two difficulties . when the cosmological constant is too large , it may render the universe to expand forever even after the field has settled down at a minimum .",
    "also , since the observed dark energy density is of @xmath63 , the magnitude of the cosmological constant one would like to add is severely constrained .",
    "it is possible , however , to increase @xmath31 by adding more fields and make them rolling slowly for many @xmath0-folds @xcite .",
    "then eq .",
    "( [ fieldeq ] ) becomes @xmath64 where the contribution @xmath65 by other fields is dependent on models : for example , if we adopt n - flation @xcite and add @xmath66 additional axions , we have @xmath67 where we assume that each axion field is displaced not too far from the minimum .",
    "it is possible that by some of the added fields further perturbations are generated after inflation @xcite , but the parameter space is heavily restricted for this mechanism to work properly @xcite .",
    "another clear way we can take is to make the axion decay constant @xmath40 larger than @xmath8 and follow the original wisdom of natural inflation @xcite .",
    "one difficulty we meet is that because it is required that @xmath68 to satisfy the slow - roll conditions , @xmath40 is outside the region of the effective field theory description and is out of our control . an interesting alternative to build a model where the above problem could be evaded is to identify the extra component @xmath69 of a gauge field in a 5d theory with the inflaton @xcite . because this model is based on higher dimensional theory , the effective decay constant @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the radius of the circle where the extra dimension is compactified , is reliable .",
    "another way of constructing @xmath72 is to incorporate two different gauge groups , making the effective decay constant larger than @xmath8 by imposing a symmetric relation between the couplings of the axions to the gauge groups @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ largeffig ] several results of @xmath0-folds depending on @xmath40 and @xmath28 are shown .",
    "note that when the field rolls towards a saddle point , generally it acquires extra @xmath0-folds but the scale invariance of the perturbation spectrum is broken when the field leaves the saddle point @xcite . to avoid this",
    ", we should put strong constraints on the parameters @xcite .",
    "also note that when @xmath68 , the minima are separated by a distance far larger than @xmath8 .",
    "hence , the extrema which intervene between those minima become the sources of eternal topological inflation @xcite . for example , a saddle point which separates two minima along ( say ) @xmath16 direction , it becomes a domain wall and in its vicinity we have an eternally inflating regime .",
    "one fundamental question we can ask at this point is whether it is possible to find regimes of moduli space where @xmath68 in string theory .",
    "it seems that , unfortunately , there exists no consistent scenario yet @xcite although not all the possibilities are explored . building a consistent scenario where a large decay constant could arise is still an interesting and challenging topic .",
    "we have investigated a simple inflation model which consists of two non - interacting axions .",
    "the number of @xmath0-folds @xmath19 achieved while the field rolls off from a maximum is dependent on both the energy scale @xmath39 and the decay constant @xmath40 : we obtain larger @xmath19 with smaller @xmath39 and with bigger @xmath40 , but generally @xmath19 is not sufficient to solve cosmological problems .",
    "interestingly , in spite of the rich geometry of the potential , the initial misalignment @xmath28 hardly affects @xmath19 because of the absence of the interaction term , which also leads to no locked inflationary phase .",
    "the perturbation spectrum is highly scale dependent , because the scale invariant spectrum which arises from the isocurvature component is greatly suppressed .",
    "to alleviate this situation , we may either increase @xmath31 by adding more axion fields , or make @xmath40 bigger than @xmath8 which is still unclear in the context of string theory .",
