    "the riemann @xmath0 function s first critical zeroes are surprisingly large : about @xmath7 .",
    "our main interest in this paper is the following question :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ does any other automorphic l - function have a larger first zero ? _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    this question was raised by odlyzko ( @xcite ) , who proved that the dedekind zeta function of any number field has a zero whose imaginary part is less than 14 .",
    "odlyzko also proved related conditional results for artin l - functions .",
    "every automorphic l - function conjecturally factors into products of standard l - functions of cusp forms on @xmath8 over the rationals , and we shall be content to discuss these .",
    "in fact , by twisting a cuspidal automorphic representation of @xmath9 by a power of the determinant , it is possible to shift the zeroes any amount vertically , so we restrict ourselves to studying cuspidal automorphic representations @xmath10 of @xmath9 whose central character is normalized to be trivial . in most examples coming from number theory",
    "the archimedean type @xmath11 is real , i.e. the gamma factors multiplying @xmath12 have real shifts .",
    "our first result answers the question for such cusp forms :    [ realarch ] let @xmath13 be a cuspidal automorphic representation of @xmath8 over @xmath14 with a real archimedean type and a trivial central character",
    ". then @xmath12 has a low zero which either ( i ) is on the critical axis between @xmath15 or ( ii ) violates the generalized riemann hypothesis ( grh ) in an effective range .",
    "when we speak of a zero violating grh `` in an effective range , '' we mean that should conclusion ( i ) fail , then one could theoretically find an effective constant @xmath16 such that the box @xmath17i$ ] contains a zero . for brevity we will use the following terminology :    * definition * : an l - function has a _ low zero _ if it either vanishes on the critical axis between @xmath15 , or violates grh in an effectively - bounded range ( see section  [ wogrh ] ) .",
    "we will use this definition to state unconditional results , but not much is actually gained philosophically or numerically in this problem by assuming grh .",
    "the l - functions in theorem  [ realarch ] include those of dirichlet characters , rational elliptic curves , and conjecturally all rational abelian varieties .",
    "of course they are also expected to include all artin l - functions , for example l - functions of galois representations .",
    "we have been unable to squeeze our technique to answer odlyzko s question in full generality , but can prove many cases .",
    "for example :    let @xmath13 be a cuspidal automorphic representation of @xmath18 over @xmath14 with a trivial central character .",
    "then @xmath12 has a _ low zero _ ( which is on the critical axis between @xmath15 or else violates grh in an effective range ) .",
    "[ gl2thm ]    this includes modular form and maass form l - functions .",
    "other results can be proven about low zeroes .",
    "for example , every l - function which is related to itself by an odd functional equation automatically vanishes at @xmath19 . for a fixed degree @xmath20 ,",
    "most cuspidal automorphic representations of @xmath8 over @xmath14 with a trivial central character have low zeroes .",
    "in fact , the possible exceptions all lie in a bounded subset of the unitary dual and have bounded level .",
    "this subset tends to be devoid of cusp forms , which is why our method is successful .",
    "thus odlyzko s question is related to vanishing theorems about automorphic forms .",
    "our technique uses weil s explicit formula relating the coefficients and zeroes of automorphic l - functions .",
    "it is a variation on the stark - odlyzko positivity technique , as formulated by serre , poitou , mestre , and others ",
    "see @xcite for a survey .",
    "in particular , one can compute an exact formula for sum of certain test functions over the critical zeroes . if we use a test function which is positive only in a certain range , then finding this sum is positive ensures a zero in that range .",
    "on the other hand , if this sum is negative , then we can often construct another test function which is positive in the critical strip , yet whose sum over the zeroes is negative .",
    "this contradiction shows that the l - function actually could not have existed to begin with .",
    "our main difficulty is that it is often very difficult to construct this second test function given the failure of the first .",
    "the latter contradiction , of positive terms yielding a negative sum , can be used to prove vanishing theorems about automorphic forms , since they can not exist when their l - functions do not .",
    "independent of our interest in low zeroes , this leads to applications in group cohomology and spectral theory .",
    "one of the consequences of the ramanujan - selberg temperedness conjecture is that the discrete cuspidal spectrum of the laplacian @xmath21 on @xmath2 is contained in the continuous spectrum of @xmath21 on @xmath22 .",
    "( we always normalize @xmath21 so that this continuous spectrum is the interval @xmath23 . )",
    "this consequence should be true more generally for congruence covers of @xmath5 , but in this particular case slightly more was proven in @xcite :    ( @xcite ) : there exists a constant @xmath24 such that the laplace eigenvalue of every cusp form @xmath25 on @xmath5 satisfies @xmath26 [ imrn ]    our new result is superior for small @xmath20 :    let @xmath25 be a cuspidal eigenfunction of the non - euclidean laplacian @xmath21 on @xmath27 .",
    "then @xmath25 s laplace eigenvalue satisfies @xmath28 [ newlamb1 ]    it can be applied to answer a question of alexander lubotzky : when does the eigenvalue of a noncuspidal , square - integrable eigenfunction of the laplacian on @xmath27 lie outside @xmath23 ?",
    "if   @xmath29 , any non - constant eigenfunction of @xmath21 in @xmath2 has laplace eigenvalue greater than @xmath30 , but the first laplace eigenvalue of @xmath31 is in fact approximately @xmath32    finally , we can apply our technique to cuspidal cohomology and extend a result in @xcite , where it was shown that @xmath27 has no _ harmonic _ cuspidal automorphic forms for @xmath33 :    the constant - coefficients cuspidal cohomology of @xmath34 @xmath35 vanishes for @xmath36    the technique used to prove this theorem is related to the one in @xcite .",

    "see @xcite for a proof of ( [ weil ] ) .    if @xmath54 is supported in the interval @xmath61 $ ] then the formula can be viewed as giving the value of the sum over the zeroes from the gamma factors : @xmath62 the basis of the positivity technique is the observation that if @xmath63 for each zero , then the sum on the right - hand side of ( [ simplexplic ] ) must also be positive .",
    "this immediately gives a lower bound on the conductor @xmath45 , which is the original application of the positivity technique .",
    "fortunately the sum on the right - hand side of ( [ simplexplic ] ) is explicitly computable in terms of the @xmath48 s and @xmath45 ; if it is negative then the l - function @xmath12 can not exist and hence neither can the original cusp form @xmath13 .    upon assuming grh , let @xmath64 be the imaginary parts of the zeroes of @xmath12 .",
    "let @xmath54 and @xmath65 be chosen so that @xmath66 on @xmath67 and let @xmath24 be a cutoff parameter .",

    "we can explicitly compute the functions @xmath80 for our choices of @xmath54 and examine where they are positive and negative within the critical strip . since the density of zeroes increases only logarithmically with their height ( with an effective constant ) , and our functions @xmath81 decay polynomially as @xmath82 in the critical strip , the zero must be contained in an effectively bounded region of the critical strip .    as an example , figure  [ h1msupport ] is a contour plot of the function @xmath83 defined at the end of section  [ library ] .",

    "<S> thus the argument is a combination of proving low zeroes exist and that certain cusp forms do not . </S>",
    "<S> consequently we are able to prove vanishing theorems and improve upon existing bounds on the laplace spectrum on @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> these in turn can be used to show that @xmath3 has a discrete , non - constant , non - cuspidal eigenvalue outside the range of the continuous spectrum on @xmath4 , but that this never happens for @xmath5 in lower rank . </S>",
    "<S> another application is to cuspidal cohomology : we show there are no cuspidal harmonic forms on @xmath5 for @xmath6 . </S>"
