    "the requirement of such system for the _ ltp_is 10  @xmath10 for @xmath11mhz . in order to assess whether or not the system is compliant with the requirement we need to place the thermistors in a thermal environment more stable than the required _ net _ ,",
    "i.e. , we must screen out laboratory temperature fluctuations to measure only the noise of the system .",
    "this implies the need to construct an insulator able to shield ambient temperature fluctuations about 5 orders of magnitude in the mili - hertz range .",
    "the concept of the insulator and the results obtained for a test campaign are shown in figure  [ insulator ] where it is shown that the requirements for the _",
    "ltp_are fulfilled  @xcite .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ] , title=\"fig : \" ]",
    "once the requirements for the _ ltp_have been accomplished the next question , with an eye on _ lisa _ , is : do we have the same noise levels at 0.1  mhz ?",
    "in principle , the electronic noise of the _ tms_should remain flat for all the frequencies due to the measurement method used  @xcite , however , unexpected excess noise might appear at very low frequencies ( 0.1  mhz ) , specially , due to the semiconductor nature of the temperature sensor itself  @xcite .",
    "the tests in the submili - hertz region are considerably more complicated than the tests performed for the mili - hertz range . at frequencies down to 0.1mhz",
    "the ambient temperature fluctuations become much larger and , in turn , the passive insulator attenuation appears to be quite poor , unless a prohibitively large insulator is built .",
    "the _ nominal _ ambient temperature fluctuations in the laboratory and the required temperature fluctuations inside the insulator are @xmath12 from equations ( [ lisa.ambient ] ) and ( [ lisa.insulator ] ) the needed attenuation at 0.1  mhz is readily calculated @xmath13    in order to obtain such an attenuation the needed passive insulator would consist in a aluminium sphere of 0.4  m diameter surrounded by a 2  m diameter polyurethane foam layer . however , the most discouraging reason to discard using a passive insulator is its time constant which is about 10  days . in consequence",
    ", temperature stabilisation down to 10  @xmath10 at 0.1  mhz by using a mere passive insulator appears unreasonable .",
    "a straight forward solution to avoid the need of a giant insulator is the use of differential temperature measurements instead of absolute temperature measurements . for the differential measurements we have that @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the noise of each of the thermistors plus electronic noise .",
    "thus , the differential measurement fluctuations are @xmath17    ideally , when differential measurements are made , only noise from the thermistors and the electronics is measured , since the common temperature fluctuations cancel out .",
    "therefore , a very simple passive insulator would be enough .",
    "however , different non - idealities arise in the practical implementation which are discussed in the next section . finally , we must keep in mind that the main concern about the potential @xmath1 noise in the submili - hertz range comes from the _ ntc_thermistors which can be detected despite the differential measurements since we assume the @xmath1 noise of both thermistors is uncorrelated .",
    "different non - idealities impede the straightforward tests of the _ tms_at very low frequency proposed in the previous section .",
    "the main limitations in the measurement that need to be overcome are :    * temperature coefficient ( _ tc _ ) of the electronics ( @xmath18 ) , * cables connecting the thermistors to the electronics ( @xmath19 ) , * intrinsic differences between thermistors ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "all these effects couple into the measurement and disturb the @xmath1 noise investigations .",
    "the apportioning of the these effects appears in the differential temperature measurements as ( we have omitted the frequency dependent argument in the notation for simplicity ) @xmath21 where @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 stand for the temperature fluctuations in the electronics , in the laboratory and inside the insulator , respectively .",
    "the main objective is to determine @xmath25 , hence , all the other contributions must be minimised . more specifically , we assign @xmath26 for each of the three disturbing terms .    the following sections detail these non - idealities and the solution adopted to overcome them .",

    "tc_below 5  @xmath2khz@xmath3 the _ fee_temperature fluctuations must be lower than 0.35  khz@xmath3 within the _ mbw _ which , in turn , means that the _ fee_must be thermostated since the ambient temperature fluctuations are around 1  khz@xmath3 at the 0.1  mhz range .",
    "the solution to this problem was solved by controlling the _ fee_temperature by means of a feedback control see figure  [ fbff.impl ] ( right ) .",
    "cables are a fair way for the ambient temperature fluctuations to appear in the thermistors measurements  @xcite .",
    "theoretically , differential measurements should fully reject the common mode ambient temperature , however , this is not the case due to mismatching between the cables and thermal resistance of both thermistors .",
    "this can be expressed as follows @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the transfer functions relating the ambient temperature fluctuations to the thermistors ones .",
    "an estimation of @xmath34 was obtained by modeling the cables and the thermal contacts using a electrical analogy  @xcite see figure  [ cables.test ] .     and @xmath33 .",

    "left : lumped model for the @xmath34 transfer function .",

    "cables are assumed identical for both sensors ( @xmath35=0.25  m and 24 awg ) and thermal resistance are ( measured ) : 95  kw@xmath29 and 100  kw@xmath29 for each of the thermistors.[cables.test ] ]    the rejection of the ambient temperature is @xmath36 at the frequencies of interest .",
    "this means that if ambient temperature fluctuations are about 1  khz@xmath3 at 0.1  mhz , the differential temperature measurement can result in about 3  mkhz@xmath3 , which is unacceptable considering that @xmath375  @xmath2khz@xmath3 is the budgeted fluctuation for this effect .",
    "the solution adopted to reduce the common mode leakage is shown in figure  [ thermal.trap ] and consists of  @xcite :    * use of very thin cables ( awg32 instead of awg24 ) , * use of longer cables ( from @xmath35=0.25  m to @xmath35=2  m ) , * attach cables to the aluminium block in order to dissipate the ambient temperature fluctuations prior to _ reach _ the thermistors : thermal trap .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ] , title=\"fig : \" ]      once the problem of the leakage from the ambient temperature is solved , there is still another non - ideality : the inherent mismatch between each individual thermistor , i.e. , even when two thermistor are measuring the same temperature , the differential temperature read - out is not zero due to differences in the response of each thermistor .",
