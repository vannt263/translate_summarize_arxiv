    "investigating deuterium chemistry is useful to put constraints on the ionization fraction , temperature , density and thermal history of dense molecular clouds @xcite .",
    "the observations of multiply deuterated molecules in space , e.g. @xcite and references therein , have shown the necessity to reexamine some reaction rates in chemical networks @xcite , elemental d / h ratio in cold dense gas @xcite and the density structure in sources such as l1544 and @xmath11  oph d @xcite , as well as the effects of accretion on grains @xcite , possible effects of internal dynamical motion @xcite , and the evolution of ice mantles in dense clouds and cores @xcite .",
    "the first multiply deuterated interstellar molecule detected has been d@xmath1co almost twenty years ago @xcite . since then",
    ", the study of deuterated molecules in the ism has rapidly increased as they have been proven to be a unique observational probe of the early stages in low - mass star formation .",
    "multiply deuterated species such as triply deuterated ammonia have been detected with a surprisingly high abundance ratio of 10@xmath12 with respect to their fully hydrogenated forms @xcite . by comparing this ratio with the elemental d / h ratio ( 1.65@xmath13 , linsky et al .",
    "1993 ) it is easily seen that there is a remarkable enrichment in deuterium in this and other molecules . in iras",

    "( 2004 ) measured cd@xmath0oh / ch@xmath0oh = 1.4% .",
    "this enrichment in deuterium has mainly been explained by the exothermicity of the h - d exchange reactions , and by the depletion of co and o onto dust grains @xcite , which enhances the abundance of the multiply deuterated forms of h@xmath14 and , upon dissociative recombination , the d / h ratio .",
    "roberts et al .",
    "( 2003 ) calculated d / h abundance ratios close to 0.3 ( 20,000 times the cosmic value ) , in regions with large amount of co freeze - out .    despite extensive studies of nearly 30 deuterated molecules in the interstellar gas , the processes regulating their formation",
    "are not completely understood , in particular the relative importance of gas - phase versus grain - surface chemistry .",
    "for example , simple gas phase chemical models do not reproduce the deuterium enrichment observed in some of these species .",
    "in particular , the formation of methanol on grain mantles is presented as an explanation for its enhanced deuteration @xcite ; for h@xmath1co instead , the gas - phase reaction path can not be excluded .",
    "in fact , in the orion bar photodissociation region hdco seems to be formed solely in the gas phase @xcite .",
    "deuteration of ammonia can be reproduced with gas - phase models ( e.g. roueff et al .",
    "2005 ) , although nh@xmath0 and its deuterated forms are also expected to form on the surface @xcite .",
    "the first detection of c - c@xmath0h@xmath1 in the laboratory @xcite allowed the identification of several u - lines previously detected in space @xcite , namely the strong lines at 85338 and 18343 mhz .",
    "since then , cyclopropenylidene has been proven to be one of the most abundant and widespread molecules in our galaxy .",
    "it has been observed in the diffuse gas , cold dark clouds , giant molecular clouds , photodissociation regions , circumstellar envelopes , and planetary nebulae @xcite .",
    "given the high abundance of the normal species , both c - c@xmath0hd and the singly substituted @xmath9c species ( off axis ) have been observed with a good signal to noise in cold dark clouds .",

    "the observations have been carried out from 2012 september 28 until october 2 at the iram 30 m telescope , located in pico veleta ( spain ) , towards the starless cores tmc-1c and l1544 .",
    "the choice of the sources has been made on the basis of two simple criteria : the abundance of the normal species ( c - c@xmath0h@xmath1 ) and a high deuterium fractionation .",
    "both sources are in the taurus molecular cloud , one of the closest dark cloud systems and low - mass star forming regions in our galaxy .",
    "l1544 is a perfect test bed to investigate the initial conditions of protostellar collapse : its structure is consistent with a contracting bonnor - ebert sphere , with central densities of about 10@xmath19 @xmath20 and a peak infall velocity of @xmath210.1 km s@xmath22 at about 1000 au from the center ( e.g. keto & caselli 2010 ) .",
    "its centrally concentrated structure and measured kinematics suggests that this is a pre - stellar core at a late stage of evolution , toward star formation .",

    "a summary of the observed lines is reported in table 1 .",
    "the emir receivers in the e090 configuration were employed , and observations were performed in a frequency switching mode with a throw of @xmath31 mhz .",
    "all four emir sub - bands were connected to the fts spectrometer set to high resolution mode ; this delivered a final spectrum with 50 khz channel spacing ( corresponding to 0.15 km s@xmath22 at 3 mm ) and a total of 7.2 ghz of spectral coverage ( nominal bandpass of 1.8 ghz per sub - band ) .",
    "telescope pointing was checked every two hours on jupiter and was found accurate to  3 - 4 arcsec .",

    "the gildas software @xcite was employed for the data processing : high order polynomials had to be used for baseline subtraction given the strong baseline produced by the frequency switching observing mode .",
    "the column densities and optical depths given in table 1 were calculated using the expressions given in the appendix . as was already pointed out by bell et al .",
    "( 1988 ) , c - c@xmath0h@xmath1 shows two velocity components towards tmc-1c , one more intense at 6 km s@xmath22 and one less intense at 5.4 km s@xmath22 , see figure 1 .",
    "there is a hint of detection of the component at 5.4 km s@xmath22 also in c - h@xmath9cc@xmath1h , but no clear presence in the deuterated species .",
    "assuming that all lines have the same excitation temperature in both components , we expect for the component at 5.4 km s@xmath22 a line intensity of 0.06 k for c - c@xmath0hd ( 3@xmath35 - 2@xmath36 ) and 0.013 k for c - c@xmath0d@xmath1 ( 3@xmath37 - 2@xmath38 ) . comparing these estimates with the noise level in our spectra ( 0.007 k for c - c@xmath0hd and 0.002 k for c - c@xmath0d@xmath1 )",
    "we can say that the lower velocity component is absent in the deuterated species of cyclopropenylidene : this behavior may suggest that the lower velocity component traces a hotter region , where the deuterated molecules are not present in detectable amounts .      the observed line intensity ratios of c - c@xmath0d@xmath1 pose the question whether local thermal equilibrium is a valid assumption for its excitation . only for _",

    "collision rates of c@xmath0h@xmath1 with h@xmath1 calculated by chandra et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and supplied by the lamda database @xcite were used together with molecular constants of _ para_-c@xmath0d@xmath1 .",

    "para_-c@xmath0d@xmath1 , n(_para_-c@xmath0d@xmath1 ) , and the results are shown in figure 2 .",
    "it is in principle possible to read the column density of c - c@xmath0d@xmath1 from figure 2 , by knowing the density of molecular hydrogen .",
    "the nominal observed line ratios would , particulary for l1544 , result in very high column densities . the lines would be very subthermally excited and very optically thick .",
    "however , given the fact that the observed line strengths run parallel to each other , a small change in the observed value would result in a substantial change in the ratio .",
    "the line intensities and @xmath42 contours of both lines show that the line strengths are very close to each other along a diagonal line spanning a large range of densities and column densities ( filling factors smaller than unity would move this line to the right in the plot ) , so that much smaller values of column densities and opacities are also in agreement with the data .",
    "the predicted excitation temperatures tend to be rather low , in the range 33.5  k , which introduces a considerable uncertainty in the column density determinations .",
    "since the transitions used for the excitation calculation for c - c@xmath0hd and c - c@xmath0d@xmath1 have similar upper state energy , the excitation behavior will naturally be degenerated .",
    "therefore , in the absence of data for more transitions for c - c@xmath0d@xmath1 , c - c@xmath0hd or c - h@xmath9cc@xmath1h , it is difficult to derive conclusive results . despite these uncertainties ,",
    "we have assumed local thermodynamic equilibrium with @xmath43 values as described in the appendix .",
    "in addition to the observation of two lines of c - c@xmath0h@xmath1 , one line of c - h@xmath9cc@xmath1h ( with the @xmath9c off of the molecular axis ) , and two lines of c - c@xmath0hd , we also claim the detection of three lines of c - c@xmath0d@xmath1 in both tmc-1c and l1544 .",
    "this first interstellar detection of c - c@xmath0d@xmath1 is validated by the following reasons :    * we detected all favorable transitions of c - c@xmath0d@xmath1 available in the covered frequency range .",
    "* the rest frequencies employed have laboratory accuracy @xcite , and in both sources the line shapes and velocities are in agreement with each other and with those observed for more abundant isotopologues ( see figure 1 ) . * the intensities of the c - c@xmath0d@xmath1 lines are consistent with what is expected from the deuteration of the ring in these sources , i.e. c - c@xmath0h@xmath1/c - c@xmath0hd is consistent with c - c@xmath0hd / c - c@xmath0d@xmath1 , as will be discussed below .    in table 2 we present the relative abundances of the deuterated species with respect to the hydrogenated ones for cyclopropenylidene over the 27@xmath30 beam for tmc-1c and l1544 obtained from this work , and also for h@xmath1co , hco@xmath17 , n@xmath1h@xmath17 and nh@xmath0 obtained from previous work . the abundance of doubly deuterated cyclopropenylidene with respect to the normal species is ( 0.4 - 0.8)% in tmc-1c and ( 1.2 - 2.1)% in l1544 .",
    "this interval has been determined considering the differences in @xmath44 obtained from different lines .",
    "the deuteration of c - c@xmath0h@xmath1 follows the same trend observed for other molecules in both sources .",
    "it is interesting to note that the ratios [ c - c@xmath0d@xmath1]/[c - c@xmath0hd ] and [ c - c@xmath0hd]/[c - c@xmath0h@xmath1 ] are quite similar in both sources .",
    "we calculated the d / h ratio of c - c@xmath0h@xmath1 in prestellar cores using the network model of aikawa et al .",
    "( 2012 ) . for the physical structure of the core , we adopt the collapsing core model of aikawa et al .",
    "( 2005 ; the @xmath46=1.1 model ) and also a static model of l1544 from keto & caselli ( 2010 ) . for co depletion factors consistent with those of the two objects , i.e. @xmath47 = 3.8 for tmc-1c @xcite and @xmath47 = 14 for l1544 @xcite ,",
    "the calculated column density ratio of c - c@xmath0d@xmath1/c - c@xmath0h@xmath1 is @xmath48 , consistent with the observed value of 0.6% for tmc-1c and 1.5% for l1544 .",
    "there is no need for any deuterium fractionation reactions of c - c@xmath0h@xmath1 on grain surfaces to account for the observed d / h ratio : the deuteration of cyclopropenylidene can be explained solely by gas - phase reactions .",
    "the main route of formation of deuterated cyclopropenylidene is the successive deuteration of the main species via reaction with h@xmath1d@xmath17 , d@xmath1h@xmath17 , and d@xmath14 .",
    "an example of the reaction scheme is sketched in figure 3 , considering only h@xmath1d@xmath17 as reaction partner .",
    "the depicted cycle of reactions starts with c - c@xmath0h@xmath1 and h@xmath1d@xmath17 , producing in the first step c - c@xmath0hd and subsequently c - c@xmath0d@xmath1 .",
    "the same reactions happen with d@xmath1h@xmath17 and d@xmath14 .",
    "the overall process is a series of two reactions : the proton - deuteron transfer ( slow step , red arrows ) , and the subsequent dissociative recombination with electrons ( fast step , blue arrows ) .",
    "the presence of this deuteration cycle results in a time dependent deuterium fractionation . assuming low levels of deuteration at the start",
    ", it is expected that this level increases as a function of time , reaching a stationary level after some time .",
    "other deuteration processes , e.g. the formation of c - c@xmath0hd from the reaction of c@xmath0h@xmath17 with hd , were found to be negligible .",
    "the d / h ratio of cyclopropenylidene is , therefore , directly related to that of h@xmath14 , the main deuterium donor in dark interstellar clouds .",
    "recently huang & lee ( 2011 ) have calculated highly accurate spectroscopic constants for @xmath9c and d isotopologues of c - c@xmath0h@xmath14 in order to guide the laboratory and astronomical search .",
    "since these species are intermediates in the formation of isotopic species of c - c@xmath0h@xmath1 , their detection would be useful to put more constraints on the models .",
    "doubly deuterated cyclopropenylidene appears to be a very interesting probe for the earliest stages of star formation .",
    "its formation mechanism puts important constraints on gas - phase deuteration models , and suggests the possibility of using c - c@xmath0d@xmath1 as a chemical clock .",
    "furthermore the brightness of the @xmath49 line of c - c@xmath0d@xmath1 at 97 ghz in l1544 would allow to make an on the fly map ( otf ) of the core in a reasonable amount of time , for the first time for a doubly deuterated molecule . during our observations , the line was observed with a s / n of more than 6 after just 30 minutes .",
    "emission from c@xmath50s is spread over 10 arcmin@xmath51 in l1544 @xcite .",
    "we estimated that an otf map of 6 arcmin@xmath51 with a noise level of 20 mk at the iram 30 m telescope with the emir receivers would be possible in 14 hours , allowing to map at the same time c - c@xmath0h@xmath1 and c - c@xmath0d@xmath1 . by mapping the core",
    "it will be possible to locate the deuteration peak , and put more constraints on current gas - grains models .",
