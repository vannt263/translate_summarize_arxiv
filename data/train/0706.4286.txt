    "the possible detection of gravitational waves by detectors such as ligo and lisa is driving rapid progress in the binary black hole ( bbh ) problem .",
    "the final stages of the inspiral and coalescence are believed to be primary sources of gravitational waves at frequencies accessible by such detectors .",
    "theoretical models that accurately predict these final stages of inspiral are needed to help analyze and improve the rate of detection with future data .",
    "there are two techniques commonly used to study such systems , the post newtonian approximation and numerical relativity . since post newtonian methods are expected to break down at smaller separations , accurate models of final stage inspirals need to be handled with numerical techniques .",
    "numerical relativity breaks the problem into two parts , the specification of initial data and the numerical time evolutions of this data . with recent advances in evolutions@xcite",
    ", it is as important as ever to fully understand the initial data one is starting with .",
    "post newtonian methods have shown that bbhs starting with large separation will evolve toward an adiabatic inspiral that follows a series of quasi - circular orbits@xcite .",
    "this quasicircular inspiral is thought to last till late stages where the black holes plunge toward coalescence .",
    "most work to date in both the construction of bbh initial data and evolutions have focused on quasi - circular configurations . but the study of binaries in truly eccentric orbits near coalescence may be important for gravity - wave detectors ( especially lisa ) and , in any case , is of considerable theoretical interest .",
    "a primary goal of this paper is to take a preliminary look at how current quasiequilibrium methods for constructing bbh initial data can be extended to construct general eccentric configurations .",
    "to predict quasicircular orbits , two techniques have commonly been used : the effective - potential ( ep ) method@xcite and the komar - mass ansatz @xcite .",
    "the komar - mass ansatz compares two definitions of energy : the adm energy@xcite and the komar mass@xcite .",
    "the adm energy gives a proper definition of energy at spatial infinity in all cases , but the komar mass is only accurate when a configuration is at least momentarily stationary .",
    "so , the komar - mass ansatz posits that when these two energies are equal , the system should be in quasiequilibrium .",
    "the ep technique is motivated by the newtonian effective one - body problem , and determines a quasi - circular configuration by finding models that have a minimum in the binding energy along a sequence of constant angular momentum , constant masses , and constant spins .",
    "the two methods have been contrasted and largely agree , with significant differences occurring only at separations close to final plunge of the bbhs@xcite .",
    "it has been conjectured@xcite that the ep method , when used with methods for constructing quasiequilibrium initial data , should generalize to represent bbhs in eccentric orbits . for initial - data methods designed to produce quasiequilibrium data ,",
    "the generalization is not obvious because the individual black holes will not follow the integral curves of any approximate killing field .",
    "we will explore this conjecture extensively in this paper . in order for this conjecture to be true ,",
    "the initial data used to construct the effective potentials must represent bbhs at turning points in their orbits .",
    "unfortunately , we can not test this property of the data directly .",
    "we will justify the assumption that the data represent bbhs at turning points and test it by comparison to various results from post - newtonian methods .    by constructing effective - potentials that represent bbhs in eccentric orbits , it becomes possible to make direct estimates of the eccentricity of an orbital configuration .",
    "of course , it is not possible to justify a unique definition for eccentricity for relativistic configurations where elliptic orbits do not exist .",
    "instead , we compare several different definitions@xcite and show that they give reasonable and consistent results . because there is no unique definition of eccentricity",
    ", it is perhaps not the best quantity for parameterizing eccentric orbits .",
    "we find that the `` komar - mass difference '' , the quantity that is set to zero in the komar - mass ansatz for defining circular orbits , may serve as a useful parameterization of eccentric orbits .",

    "minimal initial data for a cauchy evolution requires that we fully specify @xmath2 and the extrinsic curvature @xmath5 ( essentially a first time derivative of the spatial metric ) defined as @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the time - like unit normal to the @xmath8 initial - data surface .    the conformal thin - sandwich ( cts )",
    "approach requires a conformal decomposition of @xmath2 , and that we specify the conformally related metric @xmath9 . in this work",
    "we will always take @xmath9 to be flat .",
    "we must also specify the time derivative of the conformal metric @xmath10 and the trace of the extrinsic curvature .",
    "we fix both quantities to be zero .",
    "the cts approach then requires that we determine the conformal factor @xmath11 relating @xmath2 and the conformal metric , and the shift vector @xmath12 .",
    "these are obtained by solving elliptic versions of the hamiltonian and momentum constraint equations ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) .",
    "finally , the extended cts approach also requires that we determine the lapse function @xmath3 by fixing the time derivative of the trace of the extrinsic curvature and then solving the evolution equation for the trace of the extrinsic curvature as an elliptic equation .",
    "we fix the trace of the extrinsic curvature to be constant in time .    in constructing black - hole initial data",
    ", we excise the black - hole interior from the computational domain and must impose boundary conditions at the excision surfaces when solving the elliptic equations for @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath3 .",
    "we demand that each black hole be in quasiequilibrium by imposing the boundary conditions worked out in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite .",
    "the assumptions of quasiequilibrium are essentially the same as those required of an `` isolated horizon '' ( see refs .",
    ". we must also impose boundary conditions at the outer boundary of the computational domain ( either at infinity or some large radial distance from the black holes ) .",
    "for this , we assume that our configuration is asymptotically flat .",
    "however , asymptotic flatness does not fully fix the boundary conditions on the constrained data .",
    "the asymptotic condition on the shift is @xmath13 where @xmath14 is an angular velocity vector .",
    "the time coordinate threading through our initial - data slice is defined by @xmath15 imposing eq .",

    "nevertheless , @xmath14 represents the orbital angular velocity of the binary as measured by observers at infinity . from a computational perspective",

    "ultimately , it is the effect of different choices for @xmath14 that we will be exploring in this paper .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , two independent methods for choosing the magnitude of @xmath14 were compared .",
    "both methods attempt to produce a binary system that is in quasiequilibrium with the black holes in quasi - circular orbits .",
    "one method is based on the komar - mass ansatz , first proposed by gourgoulhon et.al.@xcite , which posits that if @xmath16 is chosen so that the adm energy @xmath17 and the komar mass @xmath18 of a system are equal , then the system will be nearly stationary ( i.e.  in quasiequilibrium ) and the binary will be in a quasi - circular orbit .",
    "these masses are defined via @xmath19 where @xmath20 , @xmath21 is the flat metric , and @xmath22 is the covariant derivative compatible with @xmath2 .",
    "the second method assumes that quasi - circular orbits are found at the minima of a reduced two - body effective potential .",

    "the horizontal axes display the dimensionless proper separation of the binary @xmath28 .",
    "it is important to note that each ep curve consists of a sequence of models where the value of @xmath16 changes monotonically .",
    "passing through the minima of the ep curves is the `` ep sequence '' defined as the sequence of quasi - circular orbit models where quasi - circular orbits are defined via the effective - potential method . also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : num_non ] is the `` komar sequence '' defined as the sequence of quasi - circular orbit models defined via the komar - mass ansatz .",
    "it is clear that the two sequences agree quite well except for the smallest separations .",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite for a more detailed comparison .",
    "most important for our considerations is that both the komar - mass and ep methods choose particular models on each ep curve , with very similar values of @xmath16 , as quasi - circular orbit models",
    ".    these sequences of quasi - circular orbit models represent a good approximation to the adiabatic inspiral of a black - hole binary so long as the binary separation is not too small . for large enough separation , the time scale for radiation reaction to induce a significant change in the orbital radius is much larger than the orbital period . at small enough separations ,",
    "radiation reaction becomes significant and the sequences of quasi - circular obits will eventually become a poor approximation to an adiabatic inspiral .",
    "it is difficult to estimate exactly where this transition occurs , but it will certainly occur at separations larger than the inner - most stable circular orbit ( isco ) .",
    "for a komar sequence , the isco is defined to occur at the minimum in the binding energy . for an ep sequence",
    ", the isco is defined to occur at the point where the ep curves no longer have a local minimum .",
    "both iscos occur near @xmath29 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : num_non ] ) .",
    "when the cts equations and excision boundary conditions as described above are used to construct initial data for binaries in quasi - circular orbit , the resulting data are consistent with a system in quasiequilibrium .",
    "in particular , we have both bodies in the binary following the integral curves of an approximate helical killing vector ( the time coordinate ) . furthermore , half of the initial data that must be specified is also consistent with this notion of quasiequilibrium .",
    "recall that the conformal metric @xmath9 , the trace of the extrinsic curvature , and their time derivatives must be specified , and that _ we take all of the time derivatives to vanish_. as long as the binary is in a circular orbit , the notion of quasiequilibrium is satisfied .",
    "however , we are left to wonder , what happens if we choose @xmath16 so that the binary is _ not _ in a quasi - circular orbit ? in ref .",
    "@xcite , we made the assertion that the resulting initial data would represent a binary at either pericenter or apocenter of a general bound or unbound orbit .",
    "to arrive at this conclusion , we are forced to give up the notion that the helical time vector represents an approximate killing vector of the space - time .",
    "our goal below is to see if this interpretation is reasonable .",
    "in newtonian physics , 1-d effective potentials nicely capture the important features of certain dynamical systems . in the case of the reduced gravitational 2-body problem , for a given orbital angular momentum",
    ", the effective potential can be used to locate the turning points for an elliptic orbit of given energy , or the radius and energy of a circular orbit .",
    "no such 1-d effective potential can be rigorously and uniquely derived for the fully relativistic gravitational 2-body problem . however",
    ", a useful effective potential has been defined@xcite in direct analogy with the newtonian gravitational effective potential .",
    "in essence , an ep curve is the total energy of the system for a sequence of configurations where the radial separation varies , but all other physical parameters are held fixed . in order to correspond to an effective potential ,",
    "the velocity of the generalized coordinate that is allowed to vary ( the radial separation in this case ) must vanish so that there is no associated kinetic energy .",
    "binary systems in bound orbits with vanishing radial velocity are either at apocenter or pericenter , and collectively we refer to these as turning points in the orbit .    for black - hole binaries ,",
    "we use the following functional definition for an ep curve .",
    "we consider a sequence of initial - data configurations that hold constant the apparent - horizon masses of the individual black holes ( @xmath30 and @xmath31 ) , the magnitude and direction of the spins of the individual black holes , and the total angular momentum of the system .",
    "we also require that the binary be at a turning point in the orbit . for the value of the effective potential",
    ", we could simply use the total adm energy of the system .",
    "however , it is more intuitive to use the binding energy since this allows us to estimate if a given configuration is in a bound orbit .",
    "the binding energy requires that we subtract from the total energy , the total mass of the system at infinite separation ( i.e.  the sum of the masses of the individual black holes ) .",
    "unfortunately , there is no rigorous way of defining the total mass of an individual black hole at finite separation .",
    "this is a fundamental uncertainty in defining a relativistic effective potential .",
    "the total mass of an individual black hole includes both its irreducible mass and the kinetic energy associated with the spin . in general",
    ", we can not rigorously define the spin of an individual black hole , nor do we know how to compute the total mass of an individual black hole given the spin and apparent - horizon mass .",
    "a reasonable approximation is to define the total mass of an individual black hole , @xmath32 , via the christodoulou formula@xcite @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the magnitude of the spin of the black hole and we can approximate the irreducible mass , @xmath35 , with the apparent - horizon mass .    to avoid some of these ambiguities",
    ", we will define the binding energy as the adm energy minus the sum of the apparent horizon masses .",
    "@xmath36 because we keep the apparent - horizon masses constant along an ep curve , this constant shift does not affect the effective potential .",
    "but , since we do not keep the total mass constant along an ep curve , the uncertainty in the definition of the total mass contributes to the uncertainty in the definition of an ep curve .",
    "another fundamental uncertainty in our numerical ep curves is the assumption that they are constructed of turning points in eccentric orbits .",
    "when the ep method was introduced , it was applied while using the conformal imaging decomposition which allowed one to directly set the radial momentum of the two holes to zero@xcite . in the cts decomposition ,",
    "there is no mechanism to directly set such data .",
    "however , as discussed at the end of sec .",
    "[ sec : quas - init - data ] , we conjecture that our initial data does have zero radial momentum .",
    "the reasoning behind this conjecture is that the time derivative of the conformal metric is still taken to vanish , so that at least instantaneously we expect each black hole to be at a turning point .",

    "the numerical data and the 3pn data begin to diverge as the angular momentum decreases .",
    "this is not surprising as it is well known the pn expansion is less accurate for tighter binary systems and the same is true for the numerical initial data models .",

    "[ sec : effective - potentials ] gives us confidence that the numerical data represent systems at either pericenter or apocenter .",

    "our next goal is to determine the eccentricities of the data in our ep curves and determine if the definition of eccentricity in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : e_o ] ) yields reasonable results .",
    "we start by computing @xmath54 for the non - spinning equal - mass models represented in the numerical ep curves displayed in fig .",

    "[ fig : non_newt ] , plotted against @xmath46 . the @xmath54 definition of eccentricity should give reasonable results when the corresponding orbit is sufficiently newtonian .",
    "the orbits become more relativistic as the total angular momentum associated with the orbit gets smaller . throughout this paper",
    ", we will use the following convention to easily differentiate which ep curves represent large , intermediate and small values of angular momentum .",

    "figure  [ fig : non_newt ] shows only a limited range of eccentricities for each value of angular momentum .",
    "there are several reasons for this , both physical and computational .",
    "first , to compute the eccentricity , we require data from two corresponding turning points on the same ep curve . that is , we need two points with the same value of the binding energy .",
    "because we do not construct models at arbitrarily large separation , some data at pericenter have no matching data at apocenter . in this case",
    ", the eccentricity can not be computed .",
    "clearly , we can not compute eccentricities using this method for pericenter data corresponding to unbound orbits , but there there are additional limitations associated with the shape of the effective potential at small separation . because of strong - field effects , the effective potentials reach a local maximum at small separation ( cf.the effective potential for massive test particles orbiting schwarzschild ) . for bound orbits ,",
    "we are limited to computing eccentricities for configurations with energies lower than that of the local maximum for each ep curve .",
    "so , the eccentricities plotted in fig .  [ fig : non_newt ] correspond to data in the neighborhood of the local minimum of each ep curve and extending only as far as the lowest local maximum on either side .     the relative difference between the @xmath54 and @xmath50 definitions of eccentricity for the non - spinning equal - mass black hole numerical ep curves .",

    "[ fig : non_diff_geom ] , we show the relative difference of the two measurements @xmath56 .",
    "note that we have manually removed data corresponding to points near the minima of the ep curves since both definitions of eccentricity yield zero at the minimum and the relative error for neighboring points is dominated by numerical noise .",

    "the evaluation of @xmath54 was limited in this range because the numerical data did not extend out to sufficiently large separations and @xmath54 requires pairs of turning points to measure the eccentricity .",

    "finally , our goal has been to gauge whether or not @xmath54 was a reasonable definition of eccentricity . in fig .",
    "[ fig : non_3pn_om ] , we show the difference between the @xmath54 and 3pn definition of eccentricity @xmath64 .",
    "we plot @xmath73 against @xmath54 rather than a relative difference to avoid division by small number issues that make the graph difficult to read ( recall that @xmath54 and @xmath64 do not evaluate to zero for the same data points ) . as expected",

    "there is some jaggedness at @xmath74 caused by the polynomial fitting used to estimate the minima of the ep curves .",
    "a careful examination of the apocenter data points ( positive @xmath54 ) shows that relative errors for modest values of @xmath54 do not exceed 20% for even the smallest values of @xmath72 .",
    "of course , the relative errors near @xmath70 are unbounded .",
    "this comparison suggests that the use of either @xmath54 or @xmath64 yield reasonable measures for the eccentricity when applied to the numerical initial - data sets , although we should be more cautious in trusting results for pericenter data with small values of the angular momentum .      the first application of the @xmath64 and @xmath65 definitions to non - spinning , equal - mass black - hole binary initial data was undertaken by berti et .",
    "al.@xcite . in this work , they considered initial data sets that satisfy the komar - mass criteria for circular orbits and showed that the 3pn definitions of eccentricity @xmath64 and @xmath65 yield non - zero results for these configurations which are supposed to be in circular orbits .",
    "we reproduce these results in fig .",
    "[ fig:3pn_non_komar ] .",
    "we note that , while it is true that the circular orbit data have non - vanishing 3pn eccentricity , the magnitude of this eccentricity smoothly approaches zero as the separation increases .",

    "@xcite and @xcite , that the energy based definition @xmath64 yields consistently smaller values of eccentricity for the `` quasi - circular '' data than does the angular momentum based definition @xmath65 .",
    "the 3pn eccentricity measures @xmath64 and @xmath65 applied to both komar and ep sequences of non - spinning equal - mass black holes . note that the ep minima yield quasi - circular data with a smaller eccentricity than is obtained from the komar - mass ansatz . ]    in ref .",
    "@xcite , we showed that circular orbits defined by the ep method yield models that are very similar to those defined by the komar - mass ansatz .",
    "we also showed that , while very similar , all quantitative measurements of the quality of the circular orbits showed that the ep method yields better results .",

    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:3pn_non_komar ] , where it is clear that the the ep method yields consistently smaller values of eccentricity for quasi - circular orbit data .",
    "although the ep method yields consistently better results for circular orbits than can be obtained using the komar - mass method , the differences are in general not sufficiently significant to outweigh the considerable computational expense associated with the ep method . when we compute eccentricities using the @xmath54 definition , the overhead of using the ep method is even larger",
    ". it would be useful to find another means of estimating the eccentricity of binary initial data .",
    "the eccentricity measure @xmath54 applied to non - spinning equal - mass black holes computed along numerical ep curves and plotted against the komar - mass difference @xmath75 .",

    "however , on the horizontal axis , we plot the dimensionless komar - mass difference @xmath76 we see a very strong correlation in the data , though the correlation weakens as we move further from quasi - circular orbits .",
    "it is worth noting that the ep curves with low @xmath72 curve back towards zero @xmath75 for configurations with negative eccentricities ( pericenter ) and small @xmath23 .",
    "this behavior is for data in the region of the local maxima in the ep curves . that this occurs is consistent with the notion that these local maxima represent unstable quasi - circular orbits , and",
    "hence we will find the komar - mass difference vanishing in this region .",
    "more importantly , it shows that all of the definitions of eccentricity we have used will break down in this highly relativistic region .",
    "so far we have restricted ourselves to the case of non - spinning black holes . however , corotating configurations have received considerable attention in spite of the fact that we do not expect to see corotating black holes in nature .",
    "in addition to the non - spinning case , berti et .",
    "al.@xcite also computed the 3pn eccentricities for the corotating data presented in ref .",
    "@xcite and we reproduce these results in fig .  [",
    "fig : co_correction ] .",
    "one of the primary reasons that the initial data for corotating black holes has been studied so extensively is that there is a simple and unique means of enforcing the condition of corotation on the black holes .",
    "this is in contrast to any attempt to enforce a specific value of spin ( even no spin ) on each black hole , which necessarily includes the uncertainty in how we define the spin of an individual black hole in a binary configuration .     the 3pn eccentricity measures @xmath64 and @xmath65 applied to both komar and ep sequences of _ corotating _ equal - mass black holes .",
    "the dot - dashed(blue ) lines correspond to quasi - circular data defined via the komar - mass ansatz and where the newtonian notion of corotation is used in the 3pn equations .",
    "the dashed(red ) lines show the improvement obtained by including the 1pn correction to the notion of corotation .",
    "the solid(black ) lines show the added improvement of using quasi - circular data based on the ep method . ]",
    "the newtonian concept of corotation implies that each black hole rotates with a spin angular velocity @xmath77 that is equal to the orbital angular velocity . this newtonian notion of corotation ( i.e.@xmath78 ) was used to fix the spin parameters in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : total_e ] ) and ( [ eq : total_j ] ) when using these 3pn equations to compute @xmath64 and @xmath65 . to our knowledge , this newtonian notion of corotation has been used in _ all _ pn computations dealing with corotation ( cf refs .",
    "@xcite ) . however , in ref .",
    "@xcite , we have shown that there are relativistic corrections to the spin angular velocity associated with corotating black holes .",
    "we find @xmath77 , including the 1pn correction , to be of the form @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the symmetric mass ratio which takes the value of @xmath81 for equal - mass binaries . also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : co_correction ] are the two 3pn eccentricities computed using the corrected definition for @xmath77 .",
    "we find that using this corrected definition significantly decreases the 3pn estimated eccentricity for these circular - orbit models .    as with the non - spinning case",
    ", we can also compute the eccentricities for the corotating equal - mass binaries in quasi - circular orbits defined in terms of the ep method rather than the komar - mass ansatz . including also the improved definition for @xmath77 in the 3pn definitions of eccentricity , we find the evaluated eccentricities are smallest when evaluated for quasi - circular data defined by the ep method .",
    "this can also be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : co_correction ] .",
    "even with the correction to @xmath77 , we notice the magnitude of the 3pn eccentricities computed for `` circular '' data are consistently larger for corotating binary data than for non - spinning data",
    ". we can not be certain why this is the case , but we should keep in mind that there is an inherent inconsistency in any attempt to attach the notion of eccentricity to corotating configurations .",
    "all of our definitions for eccentricity , including the 3pn definitions that can be evaluated using information from a single data set , ultimately rely on information from both a pericenter and an apocenter configuration . for eccentric orbits ,",
    "the spins of corotating black holes will change from pericenter to apocenter . since the spins ( including spin - orbit and spin - spin couplings ) contribute to the total energy , this variation of the spin throughout the orbit must impact upon our definitions of eccentricity .",
    "this is likely to cause few problems when considering nearly circular orbits ( where the spin varies little from pericenter to apocenter ) , but our definitions of eccentricity may not yield reasonable results for orbits that deviate significantly from being circular .",
    "in this paper , we have examined several basic questions associated with the construction of binary black - hole initial data .",
    "when we construct binary initial - data sets using the extended cts equations and fix the freely - specifiable parts of the data and boundary conditions to be consistent with the assumptions of quasiequilibrium , we obtain models for black holes in circular orbits . but what happens if we set aside the quasiequilibrium assumption that imposes circular orbits ?",
    "the resulting data can no longer evolve in a quasiequilibrium manor as the orbit will have a significant eccentricity .",
    "our investigations suggest that the initial data models we obtain represent , in general , binaries that are at _ turning points _ ( either apocenter or pericenter ) of some general eccentric orbit .",
    "the specific notion of quasiequilibrium that we set aside is implemented by imposing either the komar - mass condition or by choosing the minimum of an ep curve as our circular orbit model .",
    "if , as it seems , general initial - data models on an ep curve are at turning points , then we can use information from these models to estimate the eccentricity of the model s orbits .",
    "of course , there is no unique definition of eccentricity .",
    "we have examined several possible definitions for eccentricity . using only information from the initial - data sets on an ep curve ,",
    "we have defined two eccentricities for an orbit ( @xmath54 and @xmath50 ) , but these definitions require that we have representative models at both the pericenter and apocenter turning points of a given orbit ( assumed to have constant binding energy ) . we have compared these definitions of eccentricity to the 3pn definitions ( @xmath64 and @xmath65 ) developed by mora and will@xcite .",
    "all of the definitions agree quite well for non - relativistic orbits .",
    "they are also in reasonably good agreement for more tightly - bound and relativistic orbits as well , although the results are quantitatively different .    one might ask which definition is better for more relativistic situations .",
    "however , it is nt clear that there is a meaningful answer . in comparing the numerical and 3pn eccentricity measures for relativistic cases , we have noticed an interesting and unexpected feature of the 3pn equations .",
    "figure  [ fig : non_const_j ] compares numerical and 3pn ep curves for equal - mass non - spinning black - hole binaries .",
    "the ep curves each have a constant value for the orbital angular momentum .",
    "all of the numerical ep curves cover a finite range of separations ( parameterized by @xmath82 ) .",
    "this is because it becomes computationally expensive to compute models at very large separations ( small @xmath82 ) and it becomes increasingly difficult to obtain convergent solutions at very small separations .",
    "_ what was unexpected is that the 3pn ep curves also cover a finite range of separations . _    for sufficiently small values of @xmath23",

    "[ fig : non_const_j ] includes a curve that marks the boundary ( for both large and small separation ) of the 3pn ep curves .",
    "this is most easily seen for the 3pn ep curves near the bottom of fig .",
    "[ fig : non_const_j ] . here",
    "we can see that the 3pn ep curves do not extend to arbitrarily small values of @xmath82 , but the numerical ep curves do ( although we do not compute them for arbitrarily large separation ) .    that this behavior is not an artifact of our method for computing the 3pn ep curves",
    "can be seen by examining fig .",
    "[ fig:3pn_lines_j ] .",
    "recall that angular momentum is held constant along ep curves , so an ep curve is represented by a horizontal line in this figure .",
    "notice that all curves of constant eccentricity have a local minimum .",
    "for @xmath83 , an ep curve can extend from @xmath84 .",
    "however , for @xmath85 , can only extend from @xmath86 to a maximum eccentricity that is less than @xmath87 , and which is determined by which curve of constant @xmath37 has its minimum tangent to the ep curve .",
    "it is physically reasonable that large eccentricity orbits should not exist as the orbits become sufficiently relativistic since the finite size of the black holes would lead to a collision .",
    "however , the pn equations treat the black holes as point particles and should not be sensitive to this limitation . also , we remind the reader that the numerical ep curves have no difficulty in extending to large separation ( @xmath88 ) for relativistic orbits .",
    "this suggests that , for relativistic orbits , there may be a problem with the definition of eccentricity and semilatus rectum used by mora and will@xcite to parameterize the pn energy and angular momentum .",
    "we do not consider this to be a serious problem , but rather an indication that any definition of eccentricity is of limited value for orbits where the interaction between the black holes becomes highly relativistic",
    ".    given the strong correlation between the various measures of eccentricity and the difference between the komar mass and the adm energy as measured by @xmath75 and seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : non_komar_newt ] , we suggest that perhaps @xmath75 can serve as a useful invariant means of parameterizing the eccentricity of an orbit",
    ". however , initial - data studies can at best suggest possible useful parameterizations",
    ". it will be most useful to evolve initial data that are significantly eccentric and examine the orbital dynamics to better understand both the parameterization of eccentricity and its effects on the dynamics .",
