    "we study markov processes on a complex of half - lines @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is finite , and all half - lines are connected at a common origin . on a given half - line",
    ", a particle performs a random walk with a heavy - tailed increment distribution , until it would exit the half - line , when it switches ( in general , at random ) to another half - line to complete its jump .    to motivate the development of the general model ,",
    "we first discuss informally some examples ; we give formal statements later .",
    "the _ one - sided oscillating random walk",
    "_ takes place on two half - lines , which we may map onto @xmath8 . from the positive half - line ,",
    "the increments are negative with density proportional to @xmath14 , and from the negative half - line the increments are positive with density proportional to @xmath15 , where @xmath16 .",
    "the walk is transient if and only if @xmath17 ; this is essentially a result of kemperman  @xcite .",
    "the oscillating random walk has several variations and has been well studied over the years ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "this previous work , as we describe in more detail below , is restricted to the case of _ two _ half - lines .",
    "we generalize this model to an arbitrary number of half - lines , labelled by a finite set @xmath13 , by assigning a rule for travelling from half - line to half - line .",
    "first we describe a deterministic rule .",
    "let @xmath18 be a positive integer .",
    "define a _ routing schedule of length _",
    "@xmath18 to be a sequence @xmath19 of @xmath18 elements of @xmath13 , dictating the sequence in which half - lines are visited , as follows .",
    "the walk starts from line @xmath20 , and , on departure from line @xmath20 jumps over the origin to @xmath21 , and so on , until departing @xmath22 it returns to @xmath20 ; on line @xmath23 , the walk jumps towards the origin with density proportional to @xmath24 where @xmath25 .",
    "one simple example takes a cyclic schedule in which @xmath26 is a permutation of the elements of @xmath13 . in any case , a consequence of our results is that now the walk is transient if and only if @xmath27 where @xmath0 is the number of times @xmath3 appears in the sequence @xmath26 . in particular ,",
    "in the cyclic case the transience criterion is @xmath28 .    it is easy to see that , if @xmath13 contains two elements , the _ cotangent criterion _ is equivalent to the previous one for the one - sided oscillating walk ( @xmath29 ) . for more than two half - lines",
    "the criterion is non - linear , and it was necessary to extend the model to more than two lines in order to see the essence of the behaviour .",
    "more generally , we may choose a random routing rule between lines : on departure from half - line @xmath30 , the walk jumps to half - line @xmath31 with probability @xmath32 .",
    "the deterministic cyclic routing schedule is a special case in which @xmath33 for @xmath34 the successor to @xmath35 in the cycle . in fact",
    ", this set - up generalizes the arbitrary deterministic routing schedule described above , as follows .",
    "given the schedule sequence @xmath26 of length @xmath18 , we may convert this to a cyclic schedule on an extended state - space consisting of @xmath0 copies of line @xmath3 , and then reading @xmath26 as a permutation .",
    "so the deterministic routing model is a special case of the model with markov routing , which will be the focus of the rest of the paper .",
    "our result again will say that is the criterion for transience , where @xmath0 is now the stationary distribution associated to the stochastic matrix @xmath32 .",
    "our general model also permits _ two - sided _",
    "increments for the walk from some of the lines , which contribute terms involving @xmath36 to the cotangent criterion .",
    "these two - sided models also generalize previously studied classical models ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "again , it is only in our general setting that the essential nature of the cotangent criterion becomes apparent .    rather than @xmath12",
    ", one could work on @xmath37 instead , with mass functions replacing probability densities ; the results would be unchanged .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : results ] we formally define our model and describe our main results , which as well as a recurrence classification include results on existence of moments of return times in the recurrent cases . in section  [ sec : oscillating ] we explain how our general model relates to the special case of the oscillating random walk when @xmath13 has two elements , and state our results for that model ; in this context the recurrence classification results are already known , but the existence of moments results are new even here , and are in several important cases sharp .",
    "the present work was also motivated by some problems concerning many - dimensional , partially homogeneous random walks similar to models studied in  @xcite : we describe this connection in section  [ sec : many - dim ] .",
    "the main proofs are presented in sections  [ sec : proofs ] , [ sec : moments ] , and  [ sec : critical ] , the latter dealing with the critical boundary case which is more delicate and requires additional work .",
    "we collect various technical results in appendix  [ sec : appendix ] .",

    "an irreducibility argument shows that our markov chain @xmath96 displays the usual recurrence / transience dichotomy and exactly one of these two situations holds ; however , our proofs establish this behaviour directly using semimartingale arguments , and so we may avoid discussion of irreducibility here .    throughout we",

    "<S> we study a random walk on a complex of finitely many half - lines joined at a common origin ; jumps are heavy - tailed and of two types , either one - sided ( towards the origin ) or two - sided ( symmetric ) . </S>",
    "<S> transmission between half - lines via the origin is governed by an irreducible markov transition matrix , with associated stationary distribution @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath1 is @xmath2 for one - sided half - lines @xmath3 and @xmath4 for two - sided half - lines , and @xmath5 is the tail exponent of the jumps on half - line @xmath3 , we show that the recurrence classification for the case where all @xmath6 is determined by the sign of @xmath7 . in the case of two half - lines , </S>",
    "<S> the model fits naturally on @xmath8 and is a version of the _ oscillating random walk _ of kemperman . in that case , the cotangent criterion for recurrence becomes linear in @xmath9 and @xmath10 ; our general setting exhibits the essential non - linearity in the cotangent criterion . </S>",
    "<S> for the general model , we also show existence and non - existence of polynomial moments of return times . </S>",
    "<S> our moments results are sharp ( and new ) for several cases of the oscillating random walk ; they are apparently even new for the case of a homogeneous random walk on @xmath8 with symmetric increments of tail exponent @xmath11 .    _ </S>",
