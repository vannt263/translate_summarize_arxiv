    "infinity algebras commonly arise in both -gradings and -gradings .",
    "for example , in the study of supersymmetry , a -grading is natural . in topological or algebraic contexts ,",
    "though , a -grading is often preferable . in this article",
    ", we explore the relationship between  structures with these two different gradings .",
    "because both the -graded and -graded  algebras on three - dimensional spaces have been thoroughly studied in @xcite , we will use structures on these spaces to illustrate this relationship .",
    "every -graded space has a natural -grading , and since the signs which arise in the computations depend only on this -grading , every -graded infinity algebra induces a -graded infinity algebra . because of",
    "additional restrictions on the structures in the -graded case , not every -graded infinity algebra on a space will be a -graded infinity algebra . from a naive point of view",
    ", it would seem that the -graded infinity algebras are just a subset of the -graded infinity algebras .",
    "however , the moduli space of infinity algebras consists of equivalence classes of isomorphic structures , and the notion of isomorphism depends on whether the structure is considered as -graded or -graded . since every isomorphism in the -graded category is also an isomorphism in the -graded category , there is a natural map from the moduli space of -graded infinity algebras to the moduli space of -graded infinity algebras .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to explore this map .",
    "we shall see that in some cases the map is bijective , but in others the map may fail to be injective or surjective .    in the -graded category",
    ", there are only a few types of three - dimensional vector spaces",
    ". the dimension of a -graded space is denoted in the form @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the number of even basis elements and @xmath2 is the number of odd basis elements .",
    "thus , three - dimensional -graded algebras are all of dimension @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 or @xmath6 .",
    "there are an infinite number of possible three - dimensional -graded spaces , which may be identified with a triple @xmath7 of nondecreasing integers , representing the -graded degrees of the three basis vectors .",
    "each -graded space also has a -graded dimension , depending on which basis vectors are even and odd .",
    "most -graded spaces have only a finite number of -algebra structures . however , a few special cases where the integers are consecutive ( studied in @xcite ) or where two of the integers coincide ( see @xcite ) have a richer moduli space .",
    "we will concentrate our study on these more interesting cases .",
    "it can easily be shown that any nontrivial  structure on a vector space of type @xmath6 must be a classical lie algebra , and that there are no nontrivial  structures on spaces of type @xmath8 ( for arbitrary @xmath2 ) , so we do not have to consider spaces of type @xmath3 .",
    "thus , the interesting examples are of -graded spaces of -graded dimension @xmath5 or @xmath4 , which allows us to draw upon earlier work concerning -graded spaces . in @xcite ,",
    "structures on -graded spaces of dimension @xmath5 were completely classified , and @xcite classified  structures on -graded spaces of type @xmath4 .    since the -grading determines the signs in the computation of brackets , it is not surprising that -graded spaces which are of dimension @xmath4 in the induced -grading have a completely different bracket structure than those whose induced -grading is of dimension @xmath5 .",
    "accordingly , we will treat these two cases separately .",
    "it is interesting to note that since the signs in the bracket computations are entirely determined by the induced -grading , the brackets of elements in a -graded space can be calculated using exactly the same formulas that are used in the -graded case .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows .",
    "sections 2 through 4 cover preliminary notions about the moduli space of algebras and the deformation theory of these algebras . in section [ sec1bar2 ] , we consider the most interesting -graded example of dimension @xmath5 , the vector space of type @xmath9 , in considerable detail . in this particular example , we show that the -graded moduli space is the same as the -graded moduli space , down to the smallest detail that can be obtained from the deformation picture .    in section [ sec2bar1 ] , we will consider -graded spaces of dimension @xmath4 , where there are two interesting examples .",
    "the moduli space of the -graded vector space of type @xmath10 is relatively simple , and it maps injectively ( but not surjectively ) to the -graded moduli space .",
    "for a -graded vector space of type @xmath11 , the map of the moduli spaces of codifferentials of order less than three _ is _ surjective .",
    "however , this map fails to be injective , due to a symmetry arising from an action of the symmetric group @xmath12 on the -graded space that does not appear in the -graded case .",
    "nevertheless , the structures of the moduli spaces are surprisingly similar .    for each space that we study",
    ", we will first establish a classification of the codifferentials of a fixed degree .",
    "next , we will use cohomology in order to determine the nonequivalent extensions .",
    "these are the elements of our moduli space .",
    "finally , in order to understand how the space is glued together , we will study versal deformations of each of our elements .",
    "since our primary aims are to assemble a picture of the moduli space and to compare the -graded and the -graded moduli spaces , we will provide computational details only when they are essential .",
    "the calculations are given in more detail in @xcite .",
    "we would like to thank jim stasheff for raising this question .",
    "let @xmath13 be a graded vector space .",
    "if @xmath13 is -graded , then the _ desuspension _ @xmath14 of @xmath13 is defined by @xmath15 . for a -grading",
    ", this simply corresponds to reversing the parity of each element , and the resulting -graded space is called the _",
    "parity reversion_. originally ,  algebras @xcite were defined as structures on the exterior algebra @xmath16 , motivated by the definition of a lie algebra , which is given by a map @xmath17",
    ". one can translate the definition of an infinity algebra to the desuspended @xmath14 picture , where it becomes a structure on the symmetric coalgebra @xmath18 .",
    "although less natural , it is simpler to express the notion of an  algebra in the @xmath14 picture , because then an  algebra is simply a codifferential on the ( graded ) symmetric coalgebra of @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "this is the point of view we will take in this article .",
    "a codifferential is a coderivation whose square is zero . for -graded  algebras ,",
    "the codifferential is required to be odd , while for -graded  algebras , the codifferential is required to have degree 1 .",
    "( note that it is also possible to work with the suspension , rather than the desuspension of @xmath13 , in which case the codifferentials will have degree @xmath19 . )",
    "every -graded vector space is naturally -graded , and coderivations with respect to the -grading are also coderivations with respect to the -grading . since coderivations of degree 1 are odd , one can view -graded  algebras as special cases of -graded  algebras .    if @xmath20 and @xmath21 are codifferentials on @xmath14 and @xmath22 resp .",
    ", then a morphism of  algebras is a coalgebra morphism @xmath23 satisfying @xmath24 .",
    "when @xmath25 and @xmath26 is an automorphism of @xmath18 , then @xmath27 , and we say that @xmath28 .",
    "thus @xmath29 acts on the  structures , and we denote @xmath30 .",
    "the equivalence classes of this action are called the _ moduli space _ of  algebras on @xmath14 .",
    "the classification problem for  algebras is the study of the structure of this moduli space .",
    "note that for -graded  algebras , we require a morphism of symmetric algebras to be a degree 0 map , while for -graded algebras , the map is required to be even .",
    "thus every morphism of -graded symmetric algebras is also a morphism of -graded symmetric algebras . from this",
    "it follows that two  algebras which are equivalent as -graded  structures are equivalent as -graded  algebras .",
    "thus there is a map from the moduli space of -graded  algebra structures to the moduli space of -graded  algebras .",
    "there are fewer -graded  structures on @xmath14 , but at the same time , the notion of equivalence is more restrictive , so it is not obvious whether the map between these moduli spaces is injective or surjective .",
    "as we shall see , in general it is neither .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to study the relationship between the moduli space of -graded  algebras on a three - dimensional vector space @xmath31 and the corresponding moduli space of -graded  algebras .",
    "the -graded  structures on such a vector space were studied in @xcite , while -graded  structures on a three - dimensional space were studied in @xcite .",
    "define @xmath32 to be the space of @xmath33-cochains , that is , the cochains of exterior degree @xmath34 , and @xmath35 to be the @xmath33-cochains of internal degree @xmath36 .",
    "we will omit the adjectives internal and exterior when the meaning is clear from the context .",
    "a -graded codifferential @xmath20 lies in @xmath37 , so we can express @xmath38 , where @xmath39",
    ". there is a natural isomorphism between @xmath40 and @xmath41 , the space of graded coderivations of the symmetric algebra on @xmath14 , so that @xmath42 inherits the structure of a graded lie algebra .",

    "the condition that @xmath20 is a codifferential is that @xmath44=0 $ ] .",

    "since @xmath48 is itself a codifferential , we can classify all possible  structures by first identifying all nonequivalent codifferentials @xmath48 , and then finding all of their nonequivalent extensions ( to include those codifferentials which have higher order terms ) .",
    "if we define @xmath50 by @xmath51 $ ] , then @xmath52 is a codifferential on @xmath42 ; , @xmath53 .",
    "this allows us to define the cohomology @xmath54 as @xmath55 .",

    "\\forall\\ n\\geq k.\\ ] ] this formula is familiar to deformation theorists , and essentially implies that  algebras are deformations of the codifferential of the leading term .",
    "in fact , one can show that if the relations hold up to order @xmath2 , then the term on the right hand side in is always a cocycle with respect to the coboundary operator @xmath52 . a coderivation @xmath20 which satisfies the relations for all @xmath58",
    "is called an @xmath59 algebra .",
    "we can interpret the relations as saying that an @xmath59 algebra can be extended to an @xmath60 algebra structure precisely when the cocycle on the right hand side of is a coboundary .",
    "we will use this observation extensively in our construction of equivalence classes of  structures .",
    "an automorphism @xmath61 of @xmath18 is called _ linear _ if @xmath62 note that this implies that @xmath63 is an isomorphism .",
    "not every automorphism is linear ; in fact , if an even ( degree 0 for the -graded case ) element @xmath64 for @xmath65 is considered as a coderivation of @xmath18 , then @xmath66 is an automorphism of @xmath18 .",
    "moreover , every automorphism @xmath26 can be uniquely expressed in the form @xmath67 where @xmath61 is a linear automorphism and @xmath68 , and every such expression yields a well defined automorphism .",
    "the term @xmath61 is called the _ linear _ part of @xmath26 , and the term @xmath69 is called the _ higher order _ part of @xmath26 .",
    "we can express the action of @xmath26 on codifferentials by the formula @xmath70 which means that the action of the higher order part of @xmath26 on @xmath42 can be computed in terms of brackets of coderivations .    if @xmath20 is a coderivation , then its automorphism group @xmath71 is the subgroup of @xmath29 which leaves @xmath20 invariant .",
    "for a codifferential @xmath48 of fixed degree , it is easy to see that its automorphism group is generated by the linear automorphisms @xmath61 fixing @xmath48 , together with the exponentials of the even ( degree 0 ) cocycles for the coboundary operator @xmath72 determined by @xmath48 .",
    "if @xmath20 and @xmath21 are two equivalent codifferentials , then their leading terms are of the same degree @xmath46 and linearly equivalent ; , @xmath73 for some linear automorphism @xmath61 .",
    "thus the first step in classifying the equivalence classes of codifferentials on @xmath18 is to find the linear equivalence classes of degree @xmath46 codifferentials , which we call the moduli space of degree @xmath46 codifferentials .",
    "if @xmath74 , where @xmath75 and @xmath76 refers to terms whose degrees are higher than @xmath77 , then @xmath78 is called the _ second term _ of @xmath20 .",
    "it is immediate that @xmath79 , so @xmath78 is a cocycle .",
    "a codifferential is said to be in _ standard form _ if its second term , if any , is a nontrivial cocycle .",
    "if the second term of a codifferential is a coboundary , say @xmath80 for some @xmath81 , then @xmath82 is an equivalent codifferential whose second term has higher degree than @xmath77 .",
    "thus every codifferential is equivalent to one in standard form , and the study of nonequivalent extensions of @xmath48 can be reduced to the study of nonequivalent extensions of codifferentials in standard form .",
    "if two extensions of @xmath48 are in standard form , then the second term of each has the same degree @xmath77 , and the cohomology classes of these second terms are linearly equivalent .",
    "we say that two cohomology classes @xmath83 and @xmath84 are linearly equivalent if there is a linear automorphism @xmath61 of @xmath48 such that @xmath85 .",
    "note that this action is well defined because @xmath86 leaves @xmath48 invariant .    if @xmath87 is a codifferential and @xmath88 for all @xmath89 , then any extension of @xmath20 is equivalent to @xmath20 .",
    "this observation will be used extensively in this paper to simplify the classification of -graded codifferentials .",
    "for details of the theory of deformations of  algebras , see @xcite . here",
    "we recall the basic notions .",
    "suppose that @xmath48 is a codifferential , and @xmath90 is a complete set of representatives for the cohomology with regard to @xmath48 , in other words , a basis of a preimage of the cohomology ( where @xmath91 is an index for the basis , not the degree of @xmath92 ) .",
    "then the _ universal infinitesimal deformation _",
    "@xmath93 of @xmath48 is given by @xmath94 where the @xmath95 s are parameters .",
    "( note that we use the einstein summation convention . )",
    "the _ miniversal deformation _ is the most general extension of the universal infinitesimal deformation to a formal deformation , and its primary importance is that it induces all possible formal deformations .",
    "we will use the miniversal deformation to determine the neighborhood of a given codifferential in the moduli space . in @xcite ,",
    "miniversal deformations were constructed for  algebras of _ finite type _ , which includes the finite dimensional case we are considering here .    to construct the miniversal deformation ,",
    "we compute @xmath96 $ ] , and look at the higher order terms which appear . since the bracket must be a cocycle , it can be expressed as a sum of coboundary terms and nontrivial cocycles .",
    "the coboundaries may be eliminated by adding higher order terms , so that eventually one obtains a coderivation @xmath97 which has the property that its self - bracket contains no coboundaries .",
    "however , the nontrivial cocycles appearing in the bracket can not be eliminated by this process .",
    "accordingly , we obtain some relations on the parameters which must be satisfied if the bracket is to vanish . these relations are called the relations on the base of the versal deformation , which is the algebra @xmath98 $ ] modulo the ideal generated by these relations .",
    "( here , @xmath99 is the base field , which we will assume later is just @xmath100 . )    in the process which we are describing , one can proceed level by level , constructing at each stage an @xmath2-th order deformation , for which the bracket vanishes up to order @xmath101 , except for terms involving the nontrivial cocycles , which give rise to @xmath2-th order relations . in the limit",
    "we obtain the miniversal deformation @xmath97 and relations which are given as a formal power series .",
    "the process described above potentially requires an infinite number of steps , although , in practice , it often terminates after a finite number of steps .",
    "it is often more practical to construct the miniversal deformation recursively as follows .",
    "set @xmath102 where @xmath90 are representatives of the odd cohomology classes , @xmath103 are preimages of the even coboundaries , and @xmath104 are formal power series in the parameters @xmath95 . to determine the coefficients @xmath104 , we express @xmath105=\\alpha_i r^i + \\beta_i s^i + \\tau_i y^i,\\ ] ] where @xmath106 are representatives of the even cohomology classes , @xmath107 is a basis of the even coboundaries , and @xmath108 are a basis of the even cochains .",
    "it follows from @xcite that @xmath109 for all @xmath91 , @xmath110 are formal power series in the parameters @xmath95 , and @xmath111 .",
    "moreover , the equations @xmath109 can be solved to obtain the expressions for @xmath104 as formal power series in the parameters @xmath95 .",
    "suppose that we have constructed a miniversal deformation @xmath112 suppose some set of values of the parameters @xmath95 satisfy the relations on the base .",
    "the codifferential obtained by substituting these values into the formula for the miniversal deformation is a well - defined codifferential in the moduli space .",
    "we can think of the values of the parameters which satisfy the relations as determining a variety in the @xmath113 space , and the miniversal deformation as a description of the elements in the moduli space which are near to it .",
    "thus the miniversal deformation provides information about how the moduli space is glued together .",
    "a one parameter family @xmath114 of deformations of @xmath48 is a curve in the @xmath113 space such that @xmath115 .",
    "it can happen that there is a codifferential @xmath21 such that @xmath116 whenever @xmath117 . in this case , the one - parameter family of deformations is called a _",
    "jump deformation_. otherwise , @xmath114 is called a family of smooth deformations .",
    "it is interesting to note that jump deformations are one way transformations ; if @xmath20 has a jump deformation to @xmath21 , then there is never any jump deformation in the opposite direction .",
    "suppose that there is a smooth family @xmath114 of deformations of @xmath20 .",
    "then this family is said to factor through a jump deformation from @xmath20 to @xmath21 if there is a family @xmath118 of deformations of @xmath21 such that @xmath119 whenever @xmath120 . in this case",
    ", we do not consider the deformations @xmath114 to belong to the same _ stratum _ of the moduli space of @xmath20 , which is determined by the smooth families of deformations of @xmath20 which do not factor through jump deformations .",
    "we will not explain here why the notion of stratum is well defined , but use this notion only for describing the moduli space .",
    "the pattern we will observe in this paper is that the moduli space has a decomposition in terms of these strata , and that each stratum is an orbifold .",
    "the smooth deformations which do not factor through jump deformations determine how a stratum is glued together , and the jump deformations determine how the strata are glued to each other .",
    "it is customary when working with -graded spaces to list the even elements of a basis first , and we will follow this convention even though it means that our basis elements will not be listed in the consecutive order that is natural from the -graded point of view . in order to express our codifferentials in a compact form , we will use the following notation . let @xmath121 be a fixed basis of @xmath14 .",
    "then @xmath122 is defined by @xmath123 the factorials in the above definition give rise to simpler formulas for the brackets of coderivations . in order to make it easier to distinguish between even and odd coderivations ,",
    "if @xmath124 is odd , we will denote it as @xmath125 instead . in section [ secmodspace ] , we defined @xmath32 to be the space of @xmath33-cochains , and @xmath35 to be the cochains of internal degree @xmath36",
    ". then @xmath126 , where @xmath127 is the difference of the degrees of the output and input of @xmath128 ( , the degree of @xmath128 as a map ) .",
    "from now on , let us assume that the base field is @xmath100 .",

    "this automorphism is even , but not of degree 0 and @xmath481 this means that @xmath482 as -graded codifferentials , but not as -graded codifferentials .",
    "this example shows that the map from the moduli space of -graded codifferentials to the moduli space of -graded codifferentials is not injective .",
    "note that the map from the -graded moduli space in the previous section is injective , because the -graded space in that case does not include codifferentials on which the map fails to be injective .",
    "the -graded codifferentials of the first kind are labeled projectively by points @xmath159 .",
    "the matrix of @xmath483 is @xmath484.\\ ] ] the rank of this matrix is equal to 2 except when @xmath485 or @xmath169 , when the rank is 1 .",
    "this means , that the codifferential @xmath486 is special .",
    "we will study the extensions of the generic case first .",
    "we have @xmath488 because of this , there are no nontrivial extensions of @xmath158 .",
    "note that when @xmath476 , we must have @xmath167 , and then @xmath489 for all @xmath490 , so that @xmath491 has no extensions or deformations .",
    "we have @xmath492    because the cohomology does not vanish identically for @xmath172 , there are nontrivial extensions of @xmath493 . if @xmath184 , the extension @xmath494 is nontrivial when @xmath495 .",
    "note that if @xmath496 , then @xmath497 so that when @xmath189 we can assume that @xmath143 .",
    "moreover , one can show that @xmath498 for @xmath89 , so that @xmath194 itself has no nontrivial extensions .",
    "a codifferential of the first kind of degree @xmath46 is equivalent to @xmath158 or @xmath194 .",
    "we will study the deformations of this space in order to obtain a more detailed picture of the moduli space of codifferentials of the first kind .",
    "if @xmath499 , then @xmath500 , so we always have a deformation along the codifferentials of degree @xmath46 ; in other words , we can deform along the family . if @xmath501 , this completes the picture in terms of deformations to codifferentials of the same order .",
    "however , for @xmath186 , we can deform to @xmath194 for any @xmath184 . on the other hand , @xmath194 deforms to @xmath502 for every @xmath503 , because @xmath504 remains a cohomology class for @xmath194 .",
    "we can also deform to lower order codifferentials .",
    "the codifferential @xmath158 deforms to @xmath505 for any @xmath257 and all @xmath506 , as well as to @xmath507 if @xmath508 .",
    "similarly , @xmath194 deforms to @xmath505 for any @xmath257 and all @xmath506 , as well as to @xmath507 if @xmath509",
    ". finally , everything deforms to @xmath491 , which has no deformations .",
    "a codifferential of the second kind is equivalent to one with leading term of the form @xmath510 .",
    "since @xmath511 it follows that @xmath48 deforms to @xmath512 precisely when @xmath259 .",
    "thus the moduli space of codifferentials of the second kind is another discrete chain , with jump deformations to lower elements on the chain .",
    "a picture of the moduli space appears in figure [ casetwo_label ] .",
    "= 4.9 in = 3.0 in",
    "applications of infinity algebras occur in both -grading and -grading , so it is important to understand the relationship between them .",
    "we showed in this paper that even for 3-dimensional infinity algebras this relationship is not trivial .",
    "sometimes ( as seen in section [ sec1bar2 ] ) the natural map between the moduli space of -graded infinity algebras and the moduli space of -graded infinity algebras is an isomorphism . in the example in section [ sec1bar2 ] , the moduli spaces are quite complicated , but some seemingly unlikely coincidences conspire to yield identical moduli spaces .",
    "in fact , there are twice as many -graded codifferentials , but the group of equivalences is just larger enough to identify them with the -graded codifferentials .    in general , the space of -graded codifferentials will be much sparser than the -graded codifferentials , as is illustrated by the example in section [ injectiveexample ] .",
    "in that example , the map from the moduli space of -graded codifferentials to the space of -graded codifferentials was at least injective .",
    "when the moduli space of -graded codifferentials is sparse , it is not really surprising that the map should be injective , but not surjective .    in the example in section [ badexample ] ,",
    "the map from the moduli space of -graded codifferentials fails to be injective in a very interesting manner .",
    "the map takes a stratum of the -graded moduli space which is a @xmath513 to an orbifold stratum of the -graded moduli space given by a @xmath514 , due to an extra symmetry induced by the larger group of equivalences in the -graded case .",
    "thus even though the map fails to be injective , the -graded moduli space is closely related to the -graded moduli space .",
    "note that in each @xmath515-dimensional  algebra examined here , we have shown that the moduli space is decomposable in a unique manner as a union of orbifolds ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , with the distinct strata glued together by jump deformations . in each example",
    ", the map between the moduli spaces respects this stratification , and in the one example where it fails to be injective , the map has a very interesting structure on the stratum on which it fails to be injective .    from the examples",
    ", we can deduce that the study of moduli spaces of -graded and -graded moduli spaces can not be reduced to a study of only one of these types .",
    "nevertheless , it may be possible to deduce important information about the -graded moduli space from that of the -graded one .",
    "explorations of higher dimensional examples may reveal more information about this connection .",
