    "three - fold symmetry is at the heart of a lot of interesting mathematics and physics .",
    "this paper shows that it also plays an unexpected role in planar geometry , in that the familiar euclidean geometry is only one of a trio of interlocking metrical geometries .",
    "we refer to euclidean geometry here as _ blue _",
    "geometry ; the other two geometries , called _ red _ and _ green , _ are relativistic in nature and are associated with the names of lorentz , einstein and minkowski .",
    "the three geometries support each other and interact in a rich way .",
    "this transcends klein s erlangen program , since there are now _ three groups _ acting on a space .",
    "remarkable algebraic identities lie at the heart of the explanations .",
    "the results described here are just the tip of an iceberg , leading to many rich generalizations of results of euclidean geometry , with much waiting to be discovered and explored , see for example @xcite for applications to conics and @xcite for connections with one dimensional metrical geometry .",
    "the basic structure of all three geometries are the same  they are ruled by the laws of _ rational trigonometry _ as developed recently in @xcite , which hold over a general field not of characteristic two .",
    "although over the rational numbers ( or the ` real numbers ' ) there are significant differences between the euclidean ( blue ) version and the other two ( red and green ) , it is the _ interaction _ of all three which yields the biggest surprises .    to start the ball rolling , this paper first introduces the phenomenon in the context of the classical euler line and nine - point circle of a triangle .",
    "then we recall the main laws of rational trigonometry , introduce the basic facts about the three geometries and state some explicit formulas , and then show how chromogeometry allows us to enlarge our understanding of the geometry of a triangle .",
    "in particular we associate to each triangle @xmath0 in the cartesian plane a second interesting triangle which we call the @xmath1__-triangle _ _ of @xmath2 .",
    "the results are verified by routine but sometimes lengthy computation , and they inevitably reduce to algebraic identities , some of which are quite lovely . the development takes place in the framework of _ universal geometry _ , so that we are interested primarily in what happens over _ arbitrary fields_. the paper ( @xcite ) shows that universal geometry also extends to arbitrary quadratic forms , and embraces both spherical and hyperbolic geometries in a projective version .",
    "recall that for a triangle @xmath2 the intersection of the medians is the * centroid * @xmath3 the intersection of the altitudes is the * orthocenter * @xmath4 and the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors of the sides is the * circumcenter * @xmath5 which is the center of the circumcircle of the triangle .",
    "remarkably , it was left to euler to discover that these three points are collinear , and that @xmath6 divides @xmath7 in the ( affine ) proportion @xmath8 furthermore the center @xmath9 of the circumcircle of the triangle @xmath10 of midpoints of the sides of @xmath2 ( called the * nine - point circle * of @xmath2 ) also lies on the euler line , and is the midpoint of @xmath11    chromoex2blue.eps    this is above shown for the triangle @xmath2 with points@xmath12{lllll}% $ a_{1}\\equiv\\left [   0,0\\right ]   $ &   & $ a_{2}\\equiv\\left [   6,1\\right ]   $ &   & $ a_{3}\\equiv\\left [   2,3\\right ]   .$% \\end{tabular}\\ ] ] the triangle @xmath2 is in black , while the circumcircle and nine - point circle are in blue ( the latter more boldly ) , as are the euler line and the points @xmath13 and @xmath14 which are given the subscript @xmath15 for blue , and henceforth referred to as the * blue euler line * , the * blue orthocenter * etc .",
    "planar euclidean geometry rests on the * blue quadratic form * @xmath16 ( or if you prefer the corresponding symmetric bilinear form , or dot product ) .",
    "it is also interesting to consider the * red quadratic form * @xmath17 which figures prominently in two dimensional special relativity . in this case ,",
    "two lines are red perpendicular precisely when one can be obtained from the other by ordinary euclidean reflection in a * red null line , * which is red perpendicular to itself , and has usual slope @xmath18    it turns out that for any triangle @xmath2 the three red altitudes also intersect , now in a point called the * red orthocenter * and denoted @xmath19 and the three perpendicular bisectors also intersect in a point called the * red circumcenter * and denoted @xmath20 .",
    "this latter point is the center of the unique red circle through the three points of the triangle , where a * red circle * is given by an equation of the form @xmath21 this is what we would usually call a rectangular hyperbola , with axes in the red null directions .",
    "chromoex2red.eps    this diagram shows the same triangle @xmath2 , as well as the red circumcircle , the red nine - point circle and the red orthocenter , circumcenter , nine - point center and centroid @xmath6 , the latter being independent of colour .    note that these points all lie on a line  the * red euler line * , and the affine relationships between these points is exactly the same as for the blue euler line , so that for example @xmath22 is the midpoint of @xmath23 .    in the classical framework , there are some difficulties in setting up this relativistic geometry , as ` distance ' and ` angle ' are problematic . in universal geometry",
    "one regards the _ quadratic form _ as primary , not its _ square root _ , and by expressing everything in terms of the algebraic concepts of _ quadrance _ and _ spread _ , euclidean geometry can be built up so as to allow generalization to the relativistic framework , and indeed to geometries built from other quadratic forms .",
    "this approach was introduced recently in @xcite , see also @xcite , and works over a general field with characteristic two excluded for technical reasons , as shown in @xcite .",
    "the possibility of relativistic geometries over other fields seems particularly attractive .",
    "there is a third geometry , that associated to the * green quadratic form * @xmath24 two lines are green perpendicular when one is the ordinary euclidean reflection of the other in a line parallel to the axes , the latter being a * green null line*.    since @xmath17 and @xmath25 are conjugate by a simple change of variable , it should be no surprise that the corresponding relations between the green orthocenter @xmath26 green circumcenter @xmath27 , green nine - point center @xmath28 and the centroid @xmath6 hold as well .",
    "here is the relevant diagram for our triangle @xmath29",
    "chromoex2green.eps    i conjecture that _ most theorems of planar euclidean geometry , when formulated algebraically in the context of universal geometry , extend to the red and green situations_. however there are exceptions . for example , over the ` real numbers ' there are no equilateral triangles in the red or green geometries , so napoleon s theorem and morley s theorem will not have direct analogs .",
    "much could be said further to support this conjecture , but this is not what i wish to pursue here .",
    "instead , let s consider a completely new phenomenon .",
    "observe what happens when the three diagrams are put together !",
    "chromoex2.eps    we get remarkable collinearities , for example between @xmath30 @xmath20 and @xmath26 and between @xmath31 @xmath22 and @xmath27 , with furthermore @xmath20 the midpoint of @xmath32 and @xmath22 the midpoint of @xmath33 .",
    "also we observe that , for example , @xmath34 and @xmath35 lie on the blue circumcircle of @xmath36 while @xmath20 and @xmath27 lie on the blue nine - point circle of @xmath2 .",
    "the three colours generally interact symmetrically , so the same relations hold if we permute colours .",
    "however there are some aspects of chromogeometry in which this symmetry is broken . the blue geometry",
    "as we shall see behaves somewhat differently from the red and the green in certain contexts , and when we come to explicit formulas we will see that the green geometry is often simpler .",
    "the red geometry seems less inclined to distinguish itself .",
    "let s now proceed more formally , beginning with the main definitions and laws of rational trigonometry .",
