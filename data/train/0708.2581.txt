    "with the rapid progress in nano - technology , the investigation of quantum processes in systems coupling to a mesoscopical measurement device becomes a very active research field in recent years.@xcite not only its practical application to quantum communication and quantum computation,@xcite but also the theoretical interests in the measurement - induced quantum decoherence @xcite have attracted much attention . in particular , in the investigation of the solid - state quantum computer with charge qubits , the quantum point contact ( qpc ) has been served as an ultrasensitive electrometer @xcite . in the literature ,",
    "the measurement of charge qubit through the qpc has been treated based on the so - called markovian approximation,@xcite in which the time scale of the qubit dynamics is assumed much larger than that of the tunneling - electron correlation in the qpc .",
    "this theoretical treatment based on the markovian approximation describes only the qubit dynamics in the time - asymptotic quasi - equilibrium state .",
    "mesoscopically , the qubit decoherence occurs in the time scale of the same order of the tunneling - electron correlation time in the qpc , where the non - markovian dynamics of the qubit is significant .",
    "thus , a non - equilibrium description to the qubit dynamics is more desired .",
    "recently , the considerations of the solid - state system processing in the non - markovian regime have indeed received more attention .",
    "for instance , a local electron spin coupling with a nuclear spin bath through the fermi contact hyperfine interaction in which the electron spin dynamics is in the time scale shorter than the nuclear dipole - dipole correlation time@xcite , and electron transports of interacting electron systems most likely involve the non - markovian dynamics@xcite . in our previous work@xcite , the non - equilibrium effect of the qpc on the qubit dynamics was studied by treating the fermi energy fluctuation of the qpc reservoirs perturbatively . in this paper , a fully non - equilibrium theory describing the qubit decoherence by the qpc measurement is developed using schwinger - keldysh s approach@xcite .",
    "historically , the schwinger - keldysh s approach is well developed to systematically treat the non - equilibrium dynamics of a many - body system.@xcite for electron transports in nano - devices , this approach has been used to study the transport current fluctuation and the full counting statistics in the single - electron transistor@xcite , the current fluctuation in kondo system@xcite , and the noise spectrum in the qpc measurement of the charge qubit@xcite . to treat the non - equilibrium effect of the electrical reservoir , literaturely",
    "the real - time diagrammatic technique was constructed to diagrammatically calculate correlation functions of the electrical reservoir order by order.@xcite for the investigation of the non - markovian dynamics in our system , an alternative real - time diagrammatic technique is developed .",
    "the master equation for the charge qubit dynamics is derived and expressed in terms of all orders irreducible diagrams to all orders .",
    "the non - markovian processes in the qubit dynamics can be fully taken into account .",
    "the effect of the time variated reservoir fluctuation on the qubit dynamics can then be explicitly studied in this formulism .",
    "in addition , the assumption of the constant hopping amplitude of tunneling electrons across the qpc barrier together with a constant density of state of the qpc reservoirs is usually utilized to specify the qpc structure related to the two reservoirs band structure coupling to the two metal gates .",
    "it eventually leads to the qubit dynamics in the markovian limit.@xcite however , the qpc structure determines the correlation time scale of the tunneling electron fluctuation in the qpc .",
    "the non - markovian processes of the qubit dynamics can emerge if a particular design of the qpc structure is taken into account .",
    "we will consider in this work a lorentzian - type spectral density to characterize the energy - level dependence of the hopping amplitude and the density of state .",
    "a close relation between the qubit decoherence and the time correlation of the tunneling - electron fluctuation shows that the qubit decoherence can be controlled through the measurement operation itself .",

    "the transmissions of all tunneling channels cross the qpc barrier are small enough such that the electron tunneling becomes sensitive to the qubit state .",
