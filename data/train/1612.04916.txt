    "( [ holeham ] ) shows that the particle - hole transformation changes the sign of @xmath52 and the chirality of the dirac hamiltonian .",
    "the form of the electron - magnon hamiltonian ( @xmath192 ) , on the other hand , does not change under the particle - hole transformation : @xmath193 since the magnon operators couple not to the charge density but to the hole spin density that has the same matrix representation as the electron spin density .",
    "in the following , we consider the electron dirac hamiltonian with @xmath194 .",
    "this hamiltonian is equivalent to the hole dirac hamiltonian with @xmath195 .",
    "the scattering term ( @xmath90 ) for this hole dirac hamiltonian has the same magnitude but the opposite sign as that for the electron dirac hamiltonian with @xmath195 due to its opposite chirality , while the definition of the electric field ( @xmath106 ) for the hole dirac hamiltonian has the opposite sign as that for the electron dirac hamiltonian due to its opposite charge .",
    "thus , the induced electric field for the hole dirac hamiltonian with @xmath195 is the same as that for the electron dirac hamiltonian with @xmath195 , or equivalently , the induced electric field for the electron dirac hamiltonian is unchanged as @xmath196 .",
