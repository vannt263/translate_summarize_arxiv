    "one of the principal goals of the study of field theories on fuzzy spaces is to develop an alternative non - perturbative technique to the familiar lattice one @xcite . to date , this new approach in the case of four dimensional field theories has been limited to studies of euclidean field theory on @xmath0 @xcite , @xmath1 @xcite and @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "all but @xmath0 have additional complications .",
    "for example , @xmath1 is not spin but spin@xmath3 and @xmath2 is really a squashed @xmath4 and includes many unwanted massive kaluza - klein type modes .",
    "even @xmath0 is not ideal since it has curvature effects that drop off as power corrections rather than exponentially as in the case of toroidal geometries .",
    "the fuzzy approach does , however , have the advantage of preserving continuous symmetries such as the @xmath5 symmetry of a round @xmath6 and does not suffer from fermion doubling @xcite .",
    "the advantages are gained at the cost of introducing a non - locality associated with the non - commutativity of the fuzzy sphere .",
    "there is therefore a balance of advantages and disadvantages associated with the fuzzy approach .",
    "the final decision on whether the approach has real advantages over the standard lattice approach should be determined by doing genuine simulations .",
    "for this reason monte carlo simulations of the fuzzy approach are now in progress . in the lattice approach non - locality",
    "is also a problem when fermions are included .",
    "so our expectation is that as far as monte carlo simulations are concerned the fuzzy approach will not be competitive with the lattice one until fermions are included .",
    "the approach will gain further advantages in situations where symmetries are more important .",
    "it also extends naturally to allow for supersymmetry .",
    "( see @xcite where a fuzzy supersphere was constructed ) .",
    "so we expect the true power of the approach to emerge when supersymmetry and chiral symmetry are present in a model .",
    "a radically different alternative to the euclidean monte carlo approach becomes available once one has a fuzzy three - dimensional space .",
    "such a space has the advantage that it allows one to develop very different non - perturbative methods , since now one can address the non - perturbative questions from a hamiltonian point of view .",
    "the purpose of this article is to introduce precisely such fuzzy three - dimensional spaces .",
    "we will begin by presenting a fuzzy version of the circle @xmath7 , from which one can obtain tori of arbitrary dimension .",
    "we will then present a fuzzy approximation to the three - sphere , @xmath8 .",
    "unfortunately , both of these spaces are still not ideal in that they involve many unwanted additional degrees of freedom which we suppress so that they do not contribute to the low energy physics .",
    "the presence of additional degrees of freedom is probably unavoidable as it seems to be the price one pays for the classical space not being a phase space .",
    "the three - sphere is also curved and hence the results obtained from studies of field theories on this space will approach those of a flat three - dimensional space with polynomial corrections .",
    "it has , however , the advantages of preserving the full @xmath9 symmetry of a round @xmath10 . from the construction",
    "it seems clear that both of these spaces will also be free of fermion doubling problems",
    ".    we will restrict our focus here to scalar field theories and demonstrate how the unwanted degrees of freedom can be suppressed so that the limiting large matrix theory of a scalar field theory recovers field theory on the commutative spaces .",
    "we will argue that the data specifying the geometries can be cleanly specified by giving a suitable laplace - type operator for the scalar field , which together with the matrix algebra and its hilbert space structure gives a spectral triple .    aside from our personal motivations , non - commutative geometry",
    "has recently become a very popular area of research from both the point of view of possible new physics in string theory and @xmath11-brane theory , @xcite , and as a new regularisation technique in ordinary quantum field theory , @xcite-@xcite and @xcite-@xcite . in both these endeavours",
    "`` fuzzy '' spaces play an important rle . roughly speaking a fuzzy space",
    "is a finite matrix approximation to the algebra of functions on a continuous manifold , the seminal example being the fuzzy two - sphere , @xcite .",
    "it has the important property of preserving the isometries of the space that it is approximating .",
    "as such the idea can serve as a source of examples related to matrix models in string theory and as a regularisation technique for ordinary quantum field theory . as a regularisation method it provides",
    "one that preserves the underlying space - time symmetries and is amenable to numerical computation .",
    "fuzzy spheres in dimensions other than two were analysed in @xcite-@xcite , but the construction there was incomplete .",
    "they also advocate projecting out the unwanted modes and working with a non - associative algebra which we consider unsatisfactory . also",
    "the case of odd spheres works very differently to that of even spheres .",
    "an alternative approach for the fuzzy four - sphere , @xmath12 , was given in @xcite , based on the fact that fuzzy @xmath4 and @xmath13 are well understood @xcite , and , in the continuum limit , @xmath4 is an @xmath6 bundle over @xmath2 .    in this paper",
    "we show how the odd - dimensional fuzzy spheres @xmath7 and @xmath8 can be extracted from the matrix algebras associated with the fuzzy complex projective spaces @xmath14 and @xmath15 . an alternative approach to obtaining a finite approximation to @xmath16 , based on conformal field theory , was presented in @xcite , however , in this approach it is unclear how the unwanted modes are to be suppressed .",
    "our method uses a similar suppression mechanism to that used for @xmath12 in @xcite .",
    "although there is no closed finite dimensional matrix algebra for @xmath17 unless @xmath18 , the relevant degrees of freedom when @xmath19 and @xmath20 are contained in the matrix algebras for @xmath21 and @xmath4 respectively .",
    "one can therefore obtain functional integrals for field theories over @xmath7 and @xmath8 by starting with functional integrals over @xmath22 and @xmath15 and then suppressing the unwanted modes so that they do not contribute to the functional integral .",
    "because of the high degree of symmetry inherent in the construction , the unwanted modes can be suppressed simply by using appropriate quadratic casimirs in the laplacian . in",
    "this way we by - pass the problems associated with the fact that the algebra of matrices associated with functions on the sphere does not close on the sphere , but necessarily lifts into the enveloping complex projective space . in a similar fashion",
    "we expect that when a hamiltonian approach to field theory is developed using these spaces the unwanted modes will cause no difficulties since they can be made arbitrarily difficult to excite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ geometry ]",
    "we summarize how a given geometry is captured in the fuzzy approach .",
    "section [ circle ] then gives our construction of a fuzzy circle , @xmath7 .",
    "section [ 4sphere ] summarises the construction of @xmath12 presented in @xcite and in section [ 3sphere ] we present our fuzzy three - sphere , @xmath8 .",
    "section [ 3sphere : v2 ] gives an alternative construction of @xmath8 which lends itself to a generalisation to @xmath17 for any @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "frhlich and gawdzki @xcite ( following connes , @xcite ) have demonstrated that the abstract triple @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the hilbert space of square integrable functions on the manifold @xmath26 , with laplace - beltrami operator @xmath27 , @xmath28 being the metric , and @xmath29 is the algebra of smooth bounded functions on @xmath26 , captures a topological space together with its metrical geometry .    in a similar fashion",
    "one can specify a fuzzy space , @xmath30 , as the sequence of triples @xmath31 parameterized by @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the hilbert space acted on by the complete matrix algebra @xmath34 of dimension @xmath35 with inner product @xmath36 and @xmath37 is a suitable laplacian acting on matrices .",
    "one can readily extract information such as the dimension of the space from these data .",
    "the laplacian comes with a cutoff and so the dimension can be read from the growth of the number of eigenvalues .",
    "sub - leading corrections give such quantities as the euler characteristic and other information about the space .",
    "the data contained in the triple @xmath24 are precisely the data that go into the euclidean action for a scalar field theory on the space @xmath26 and hence specifying the scalar action is a convenient method of prescribing these data .    in the fuzzy approach",
    "the algebra will always be a matrix algebra and we will retain the hilbert space inner product specified above so the only data from the triple , @xmath38 , remaining to be supplied are the permitted matrix dimensions , @xmath35 and a realization of the laplacian , @xmath37 .",
    "once this information is given the fuzzy geometry is specified .    though it may be convenient to give a map to functions",
    "this is not necessary .",
    "once the laplacian is given its eigenmatrices and spectrum can be used to provide such a map if needed .",
    "suppose for example that the spectrum of @xmath37 is identical to that of @xmath39 up to some cutoff and a complete set of eigenmatrices is given by @xmath40 with the corresponding commutative eigenfunctions being @xmath41 , then the symmetric symbol - map @xmath42 given by @xmath43 provides a map to functions with @xmath44 the function corresponding to the matrix @xmath45 .",
    "by construction the map has no kernel and the symbol - map induces a @xmath46 product on functions given by @xmath47 which represents matrix multiplication in terms of an operation on the image functions .",
    "the @xmath46 product depends on @xmath42 , a different but equivalent one could be obtained by giving a nonzero weighting @xmath48 to the different terms in the sum ( [ symbol_map ] ) . in the case of @xmath49 a particular choice of the @xmath48 will give the diagonal coherent state prescription is referred to as the covariant symbol of the matrix @xmath45 and since the coefficients @xmath48 are not one it will differ from the corresponding contravariant symbol , see berezin @xcite .",
    "the symbol - map is referred to as symmetric when its covariant and contravariant symbols are equal and coincides with the case of @xmath50 . ] as discussed in @xcite .    if the symbol - map ( [ symbol_map ] ) has the property that @xmath51 where @xmath39 is a natural laplacian for the space to be approximated , then the spectrum of the fuzzy space will be precisely a cutoff version of that of the commutative space @xmath26 .",
    "this is precisely what happens in the case of @xmath52 , see @xcite .",
    "however , it is convenient to extend the definition of fuzzy space to the case where the spectrum coincides for low - lying eigenvalues , but deviates for a family of eigenvalues that can be given arbitrarily high value and which correspond to degrees of freedom that have no counterpart in the commutative space @xmath26 .",
    "this allows us to obtain fuzzy approximations to additional spaces  in particular , as we will see , to tori and the three sphere .",
    "if one takes the euclidean quantum field theory point of view then the desired geometry appears as that associated with the accessible configurations of the field theory and the deviations are suppressed in a probabilistic fashion .",
    "a successful method of suppressing the unwanted modes would be to add to the scalar action a term @xmath53 $ ] which is non - negative for any @xmath54 , zero only for matrices that correspond to functions on @xmath26 , and positive for those that do not .",
    "the modified action would therefore be of the form @xmath55+h s_i[\\phi]$ ] .",
    "the parameter @xmath56 should be chosen to be large and positive .",
    "the probability of any given matrix configuration then takes the form @xmath57=\\frac{{\\rm e}^{-s[\\phi]-hs_i[\\phi]}}{z } \\label{prob_of_config}\\ ] ] where @xmath58 { \\rm e}^{-s[\\phi]-hs_i[\\phi ] } \\label{partition_fn}\\ ] ] is the partition function of the model .",
    "if the prescription is to work for free field theories , then @xmath53 $ ] should be at most quadratic in @xmath54 .",
    "this can then be thought of as a modification of the laplacian in the triple ( [ fuzzy_triple ] ) .",
    "furthermore the problem of uv / ir mixing in scalar theories can be removed by including a higher derivative operator in the quadratic term of the field theory such that it renders all diagrams finite when the matrix size is sent to infinity .",
    "with such a prescription since each diagram has a limiting commutative value in the large matrix limit each diagram must take this value and hence no uv / ir mixing can occur .",
    "the prescription of sending the matrix size to infinity and sending the coefficient of the irrelevant higher derivative operator to zero do not commute .",
    "this prescription of adding an irrelevant operator to the action is simpler than the normal ordering prescription proposed in @xcite and works for any dimension .    from the above discussion",
    "it should be clear that the entire problem of constructing a fuzzy approximation to a space is the problem of giving a suitable prescription for the matrix laplacian .",
    "consider the finite matrix algebra representation of the fuzzy sphere @xmath59 @xcite .",
    "the algebra of @xmath60 matrices , which will be denoted by @xmath61 , has the same dimension as the number of degrees of freedom in a spherical harmonic expansion of a function on @xmath6 , truncated at angular momentum @xmath32 , @xmath62 that is@xmath63 the precise identification between a matrix @xmath64 and a cut - off function @xmath65 , as discussed in the preceding section , is not unique , but the possible maps can be given in terms of coherent states or the symmetric symbol - map @xmath42 of ( [ symbol_map ] ) , and the resulting product of functions is non - commutative for finite @xmath32 .",
    "it is crucial to our construction that only maps for which the product of functions becomes commutative in the limit @xmath66 be considered .",
    "the symbol - map ( [ symbol_map ] ) associates orthonormal @xmath67 polarisation tensors @xmath68 with spherical harmonics @xmath69 .",
    "the conventions used here will be that @xmath70 where the polarisation tensors @xmath71 are those of @xcite .",
    "the @xmath72 symmetric laplacian , @xmath73 , on the fuzzy sphere acts on matrices @xmath54 and is represented by the second order casimir corresponding to the adjoint action of the angular momentum generators @xmath74 in the @xmath60 representation : @xmath75.\\ ] ] hence the action can be taken to be @xmath76={1\\over l+1 } tr\\left ( { 1\\over 2}\\phi^\\dagger \\lap^2\\phi + v(\\phi)\\right ) \\label{fs2action}\\ ] ] for some scalar potential @xmath77 , which is assumed to be bounded below .",
    "this action can then be used in a partition function which involves ordinary integration over @xmath78 degrees of freedom @xmath79}. \\label{z}\\ ] ] the probability distribution for field configurations is then @xmath57=\\frac{{\\rm e}^{-s[\\phi]}}{z } \\label{prob_of_s2}\\ ] ] where @xmath55 $ ] given is by ( [ fs2action ] ) .",
    "this probability distribution is associated with the geometry @xmath80 which specifies a round fuzzy sphere .",
    "the field theory with quadratic potential , however , suffers from uv / ir mixing problems @xcite .",
    "if we add the term @xmath81 to the laplacian and use the triple @xmath82 the uv / ir mixing problem is removed and we recover a field theory on the commutative @xmath6 in the infinite matrix size limit .",
    "the parameter @xmath83 can finally be sent to zero with the result that the critical value of the mass parameter will be sent to infinity .",
    "the process of taking the large matrix limit and sending @xmath83 to zero do not commute . to obtain the commutative theory on the sphere",
    "the matrix size must be sent to infinity for non - zero @xmath83 .",
    "there is no finite matrix approximation to the algebra of functions on @xmath84 .",
    "nevertheless , the degrees of freedom relevant to a circle are certainly contained in @xmath61 .",
    "focusing on the top harmonic in ( [ ylm ] ) , with @xmath85 , the @xmath86 contain all @xmath87 and thus reproduce functions on the circle as @xmath88 .",
    "this implies that the partition function and correlation functions for a field theory on a circle can be extracted from that of the fuzzy sphere by suppressing all the modes with @xmath89 in ( [ z ] ) .",
    "one way of achieving this is to penalise modes with @xmath89 by giving them a large positive weight in the action . to this end",
    "we modify the action ( [ fs2action ] ) to @xmath90={1\\over l+1 } tr\\left\\{{1\\over 2 } \\phi^\\dagger [ l_3,[l_3,\\phi]]+ { h\\over 2}\\phi^\\dagger\\left(l(l+1)-\\lap^2\\right)\\phi + v(\\phi)\\right\\}.\\ ] ] all modes with @xmath89 now have the wrong sign for @xmath73 and , when @xmath56 is very large , are heavily penalised in the partition function ( [ z ] ) , contributing nothing as @xmath91 . in this limit",
    "only the modes with @xmath85 remain and these have the correct sign for their kinetic energy , because the term linear in @xmath56 vanishes on these and only these modes .",
    "the ` wrong sign ' for the @xmath73 contribution to the kinetic energy here is analogous to an anti - ferromagnetic coupling in a lattice theory and just as in the lattice theory with an anti - ferromagnetic coupling the action here is also bounded below . that the action remains bounded from below is intimately related to the fact that there is an ultraviolet cutoff in the model and therefore a maximum eigenvalue for the laplacian or equivalently a shortest wavelength .    to see that the commutative algebra of functions on @xmath84 is recovered in the @xmath85 sector of the fuzzy sphere as @xmath66",
    ", we first decompose the matrix @xmath54 using the basis of polarisation tensors : @xmath92 in our conventions ( [ tlm ] ) the commutator of the polarisation tensors is given by ( see e.g. @xcite page 191 , equation ( 46 ) ) @xmath93&= & \\sqrt{(2l_1 + 1)(2l_2 + 1)\\over l+1 } \\sum_{l=0}^l(-1)^{l - l}\\left\\{1-(-1)^{l_1+l_2+l}\\right\\ } \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\hspace{50pt}\\times   \\left\\ { \\matrix{l_1 & l_2 & l \\cr l/2 & l/2 & l/2\\cr}\\right\\ } c_{l_1m_1,l_2m_2}^{lm}\\hat y_{lm},\\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath94 are @xmath95-symbols and @xmath96 are clebsch - gordon co - efficients .",

    "we can encode the geometry specifying a fuzzy circle by the triple @xmath103 with @xmath104 .",
    "this picks out the fuzzy circle from the top angular momentum polarization tensor @xmath105 .",
    "one could equally pick it out from a lower one , @xmath106 by modifying the term proportional to @xmath56 to @xmath107 .",
    "this latter choice may have advantages for the suppression of uv / ir mixing effects in the fuzzy context .",
    "it roughly corresponds to a mixture of ` nearest neighbour ' and next nearest neighbour ferromagnetic and anti - ferromagnetic couplings .    having constructed a fuzzy circle it is now clear that there is no obstacle to constructing fuzzy tori of arbitrary dimension , simply by taking products of fuzzy circles .",
    "this has the obvious advantage for numerical simulation of avoiding power - law curvature effects .",
    "we can use a similar procedure to approximate @xmath10 from a finite approximation to @xmath2 but first , in this section , we summarise the construction of the fuzzy @xmath2 from fuzzy @xmath4 given in @xcite .",

    "all such representation , for @xmath114 , appear in the tensor product @xmath115 since the dimension of @xmath116 is @xmath117 the representations in ( [ matcp2 ] ) constitute a @xmath118 matrix and are thus in one - to - one correspondence with elements @xmath54 of @xmath34 .",

    "the extraction of a fuzzy @xmath2 from this algebra further relies on the curious fact that there is another possibility for the laplacian on @xmath136 that has a lower symmetry , @xmath137 , coming from the fact that it is also possible to represent @xmath4 as the coset space @xmath138 . in this representation",
