    "1996 , 1997b ) , and is unlikely to be the result of a single mechanism . with the exceptions of 3c171 ( clark et al.1998 ) and 3c368 ( dickson et al .  1995 ;",
    "stockton , ridgway & kellogg 1996 ) , nebular continuum fails to explain more than a fraction of the aligned light in objects for which deep spectroscopy has been obtained .",
    "scattering of a hidden quasar nucleus is expected to add to the aligned light , and the detection of broad , polarised mgii emission in a number of these objects ( e.g.  3c265 and 3c324 ; dey & spinrad 1996 ; cimatti et al .",
    "1996 ) shows that this can be an important contributor .",

    "most proposed mechanisms for producing radio  optical alignments are expected to depend to some extent on the agn luminosity .",
    "the radio luminosity and the strength of narrow optical emission lines in radio galaxies have been known to correlate for some time ( baum & heckman 1989 ; rawlings et al .",
    "recently , a correlation of the optical continuum luminosity of steep - spectrum radio - loud quasars with radio luminosity has also been established ( serjeant et al .",
    "both these imply a close relationship between the optical / uv luminosity of the agn and the radio luminosity , presumably via a correlation with the bulk kinetic power of the radio jets ( rawlings & saunders 1991 ) . given this ,",
    "it is not surprising that the optical emission aligned with the radio jet seen in high redshift radio galaxies might also correlate with radio luminosity .",
    "two studies in the near - infrared , that of dunlop & peacock ( 1993 ) and of eales et al .",
    "( 1997 ) found that this `` alignment effect '' was unmeasurably small in samples of @xmath5 radio sources approximately ten and four times fainter than 3c respectively .",
    "both these studies were , however , carried out under conditions of poor ( @xmath6 ) seeing , and in the @xmath7-band ( roughly 1-micron in the rest - frame ) , where the alignment effect is weak even in 3c ( rigler et al .",
    "they therefore could not usefully constrain how strongly the alignment effect depended on radio luminosity .",
    "the question of the luminosity dependence of the alignment effect is also related to the extent to which the onset of the alignment effect at @xmath8 in flux - limited samples such as 3c is a true evolutionary effect , or just an effect due to sources in a flux - limited sample becoming more luminous with redshift .    in this paper",
    ", we present optical images of a sample of @xmath0 radio galaxies whose radio luminosity is approximately twenty times lower than those of 3c radio galaxies at the same redshift . using these images and data on a comparison sample of 3c objects obtained from the hst archive , we quantify and compare the strength of the alignment effect in the two samples .",

    "emission line fluxes are listed in table 2 , where the estimated emission line contamination of the optical images is also shown .",
    "( 500,650 ) ( 0,0 )    [ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , > \" , ]     we also checked the extent to which the two samples are similar in terms of properties other than radio luminosity . the spectral index and physical size distributions of the two samples were compared using the k.s .",
    "test which showed that the distributions of these quantities are very similar ; the probability of the null hypothesis that both are drawn from the same distribution is more than 40 per cent using a two - sided test .",
    "similarly the magnitudes within 15 and 50 kpc are consistent with being the same to 30 per cent on a two - sided test .",
    "though the results of section 5 are admittedly based on small samples and are not of great statistical significance , they are quite suggestive . we seem to have significant alignment on a 15 kpc scale in a sample of radio galaxies whose luminosity is @xmath2020 times fainter than that of the 3c sample . of course , even if we are correct in finding almost comparable percentage alignments in the 7c sample and the 3c sample at @xmath2015 kpc , this does not necessarily translate into ascribing the same alignment mechanism to the two samples .",
    "an important difference seems to be in the scale of the aligned material .",
    "we have shown that in this sample , the 3c objects are aligned over a large range in scales , whereas in the 7c samples the alignments seem mostly to disappear between 15 and 50 kpc . in",
    "the extensively studied @xmath21 3c galaxies , of which these are probably a reasonably typical subset ( though at slightly lower @xmath22 ) , it is known that there is a variety of causes for the alignment effect , some of which would work fairly well at large scales , such as scattering .",
    "further evidence for a large - scale aligned component in the 3c radio galaxies is that we find on average twice as much flux above the isophotal cutoff in the 3c as in the 7c in the 15  50 kpc annulus , albeit with great dispersion ( although we note that the difference in the median magnitudes at 15 and 50kpc is similar in the two samples , suggesting it is relatively compact material in the 3c objects which dominates the large - scale alignments ) .    though we do not have in our 3c sample any obvious examples in which the very small scale , `` jet path '' aligned morphology ( e.g 3c 324 ) dominates , a very small scale alignment mechanism may still be contributing , but is swamped by emission from the more dominant elliptical host .",
    "we can probably assume that in this 3c sample the same wide range of mechanisms determined in the @xmath23 samples are contributing , and some of these mechanisms are obviously effective at scales of @xmath2050 kpc .",
    "one possibility is that there may simply be less material at larger scales in the 7c environments to be aligned or to act as a scattering medium .",
    "an argument against this is the lack of any correlation observed between radio luminosity and galaxy cluster environment at @xmath24 ( hill & lilly 1991 ) .",
    "[ our not data will eventually be used to quantify the environments of the 7c galaxies directly ( wold , lacy & lilje 1998 ) . ]",
    "why , then , are the galaxies in this 7c sample aligned ?",
    "we have no information , of course , at the very small ( 01 ) scale at which some 3c objects show alignment , and our result , though reasonably good statistically , is based on a few objects .",
    "furthermore , these objects themselves show significant variation in the type of aligned morphology .",
    "so it is difficult to tell what the likely mechanisms are , and why they do not seem to be operating at @xmath20 50 kpc scales .",
    "nevertheless , we discuss some possibilities below .",
    "two of the most common alignment mechanisms known to operate in the 3c sample are scattering and nebular continuum emission .",
    "both of these should scale approximately as the emission line strengths , which are found to scale with the radio luminosity to about the 6/7 power ( rawlings & saunders 1991 ; willott et al .",
    "we should therefore expect contributions from scattering and nebular continuum emission to be about a factor of 15 less in the 7c sample than in the 3c sample ; were the percentage alignments this much diminished they would have been undetectable .",
    "consistent with this is the fact that some of the 7c radio galaxies have weak or undetectable emission lines , and the quasar fraction is much lower than in 3c ( see discussion in section 5 ) .",
    "one would also expect both optical synchrotron and inverse compton emission ( daly 1992 ) to scale directly with the radio luminosity .",
    "the probable luminosity dependence of other mechanisms are less clear , but they may scale less severely with radio power .",
    "jet - induced star formation , if it occurs , may even be favoured in lower luminosity sources where the bulk kinetic energy carried by the radio jet is lower .",
    "simulations of shocks propagating into cool clouds have been carried out by a number of groups .",
    "stone & norman ( 1992 ) and klein , mckee & colella ( 1994 ) have looked at the purely hydrodynamic effects , and show that shock waves with velocities appropriate to supernovae ( and therefore probably to most radio - jet induced shocks too ) lead to an adiabatic equation of state in the shocked clouds .",
    "such clouds are crushed and shredded due to hydrodynamic instabilities .",
    "mac low et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , however , include the effects of magnetic fields , and find that an equipartition magnetic field may be able to stabilise the clouds against shredding .",
    "foster & boss ( 1996 ) include self - gravity in their simulations , and find that shocks can promote cloud collapse if the shocked gas remains isothermal [ typically the case for slow ( @xmath25kms@xmath10 ) shocks ] , but that adiabatic shocks still lead to cloud shredding . as",
    "jet speeds are probably relativistic in frii radio sources with similar radio luminosities to the 7c sources discussed here ( hardcastle et al .",
    "1998 ) , it certainly seems unlikely that the strong shocks associated with the radio source , for example the bow shock , can lead to star formation .",
    "other , weaker shocks associated with , for example , backflow or the sideways expansion of the lobe , may be more successful , however , particularly on smaller scales within the host galaxy where the densities are high enough that some shocks may be close to isothermal . on the basis of these arguments it seems unlikely that a strong radio jet will be any more successful at forming stars than a weaker one",
    "the `` selection bias '' effect of eales ( 1992 ) should also operate effectively in the 7c sample .",
    "the strength of the effect in a sample with a narrow redshift range is dependent on the luminosity function at the mean redshift of the sample .",
    "6 shows the predicted radio  optical position angle distribution for a variety of flux limits at @xmath26 , using the dunlop & peacock ( 1990 ) luminosity - density evolution model .",
    "this shows that the 7c sample is sufficiently above the break in the luminosity function that there is very little dimunition of this effect in the 7c sample relative to the 3c .",
    "in at least one case ( 7c 1748 + 6731 ) the observed alignment may be due to a dust disk whose axis aligns with the radio jet axis .",
    "aligned dust disk axes are reported to be fairly common in the @xmath27 3c radio galaxies of the hst snapshot survey ( de koff et al .",
    "1995 ) , and in other hst data on nearby radio galaxies ( van dokkum & franx 1995 ) .",
    "they are thus a viable candidate for producing the 15-kpc scale alignments in the 7c sample .",
    "only one of the 7c ( and none of the 3c ) sample , however , show evidence for dust lanes , though more may become apparent in the 7c sample at higher resolution .",
    "studies of radio - optical alignments in low radio - luminosity radio galaxies have , with one or two exceptions , so far been restricted to low redshifts ( @xmath27 ) , due to the lack of suitable radio source samples selected at fainter flux levels than 3c .",
    "a few individual cases of alignments have been found , but no systematic survey has been fully written up in the literature , although dey & van breugel ( 1993 ) report finding aligned uv emission in about 30 per cent of nearby ( @xmath28 ) powerful radio galaxies . since the pool of potential sources is very large , and",
    "only `` interesting '' cases have been published , it is hard to assess whether the low redshift cases are merely coincidences or not , and hard to determine whether there is real evolution between @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "one systematic survey that has been made is the hst snapshot survey .",
    "objects in the same luminosity range as the 7c objects are in the redshift range @xmath31 ( fig .  8) . in fig .",
    "7 we plot the difference between the radio and optical position angles for 3c objects in this redshift range , as tabulated by de koff et al .",
    "although the isophotal limits and the rest - frame wavelength of observations are somewhat different , both sets of images are taken above the 4000@xmath2break , so the underlying stellar population might be expected to dominate in both samples .",
    "although there may be a weak alignment trend ( note , for example , the lack of objects in the 80 - 90@xmath32 bin ) , there is clearly no strong alignment effect in this sample .",
    "pa for the 40 objects in the hst snapshot survey with @xmath33 ( de koff et al .",
    "1998 ) . ]",
    "the individual low redshift cases of radio  optical alignment that have been published actually span a wide range in radio luminosity . to illustrate this , in fig .",
    "8 we plot some of the better known low luminosity aligned objects , together with our 3c and 7c samples , on the radio - luminosity redshift plane .",
    "perhaps the most famous example of an fri radio source with aligned emission is pks0123 - 016a , where the blue peculiar galaxy known as minkowski s object is seen apparently interacting with the radio jet ( van breugel et al .  1985 ) .",
    "the fri radio sources in a1795 and a2597 have been studied by mcnamara and collaborators .",
    "they find excess blue light in the host galaxies which appears to trace the radio lobes but which is unpolarised ( mcnamara et al .",
    "1997 ; mcnamara et al .  1996 ; sarazin et al .  1995 ; mcnamara & oconnell 1993 ) .",
    "all these cases of the alignment effect in fri radio galaxies seem best explained via jet - induced star formation . indeed , as discussed in section 6.2",
    ", jet - induced star formation may be easier in sources with lower jet velocities .",
    "3c285 is an frii radio source close to the fri / frii boundary which has a blue aligned component projected @xmath34kpc from the nucleus which van breugel & dey ( 1993 ) ascribe to jet - induced star formation ( the host galaxy itself is not aligned ) .",
    "pks 2152 - 699 , another low luminosity frii has an aligned blue knot whose light is polarised at @xmath35 to the radio axis , which suggests that scattered light from the nucleus is responsible .",
    "( di serego alighieri 1989 ; fosbury et al .",
    "both these objects are a little less radio - luminous than the 7c objects .",
    "aligned emission has also been seen in more powerful frii radio sources , notably 3c171 ( where nebular continuum seems to be responsible ; clark et al .",
    "1998 ) , pks 2250 - 41 ( clark et al .  1997 ) and 3c435a ( rocca - volmerange et al .  1994 ) .",
    "the latter two cases are discussed below .",
    "two of the objects in the 7c sample , 7c1807 + 6831 and 7c1826 + 6510 have aligned components with red stellar populations .",
    "furthermore , the morphology of these components is peculiar , with both having fainter aligned material strung out along the line joining them to the radio source host galaxy .",
    "there are a number of other similar red aligned objects in the literature , and they provide some of the most puzzling manifestations of the alignment effect .",
    "examples include 3c34 ( best et al .",
    "1997a ) , 3c114 ( dunlop & peacock 1993 ; leyshon & eales 1998 ) 3c212 ( the se component ; ridgway & stockton 1997 ; stockton & ridgway 1998 ) , 53w091 ( spinrad et al .",
    "1997 ) , 3c356 ( whichever of ` a ' or ` b ' is the true host ; lacy & rawlings 1994 ; cimatti et al .",
    "1997 ) , 3c435a ( rocca - volmerange et al .",
    "1994 ) , pks 2250 - 41 ( clark et al .",
    "1997 ) and 3c441 ( lacy et al .  1998 ) .",
    "these objects can be divided into two classes , those where the companion is just beyond a radio hotspot ( 3c212 , 53w091 , 3c435a , 3c441 , pks2250 - 41 ) and those where it is within a lobe ( 3c34 , 3c114 , 3c356 , 7c 1807 + 6831 , 7c1826 + 6510 ) .    those with optical components close to hotspots can probably be explained in terms of a radio jet colliding with a galaxy in the same group or cluster as the host .",
    "the increase in external density will raise the ram pressure in the head of the source , enhancing the synchrotron emissivity and thereby pushing the source into a flux - limited sample .",
    "those with optical components in the lobe are more puzzling [ except perhaps for 3c114 which is polarized in @xmath7-band ; leyshon & eales ( 1998 ) ] .",
    "chance , or unusually well - aligned manifestations of the selection effect of eales ( 1992 ) could explain their presence , but if so their often peculiar morphogies ( e.g.  3c34 and the two 7c objects in this paper ) remain a puzzle . a possible , but perhaps unlikely explanation , given the discussion in section 6.2 , is that jet - induced star formation could occur with an imf weighted heavily towards massive stars and lead to an aligned component dominated by a red stellar population in @xmath36 yr ( lacy & rawlings 1994 ; best et al .",
    "1997a ) .",
    "could a component of aligned light on large scales whose luminosity is proportional to that of the agn affect near - infrared studies of @xmath5 radio galaxies ?",
    "roche , eales & rawlings ( 1998 ) find that the @xmath7-band sizes and magnitudes of @xmath5 radio source hosts differ significantly between the 3c and 6c samples , which are only a factor of four different in radio flux limit , and best et al .",
    "( 1998 ) claim to find extended haloes around their hst images of 3c radio galaxies which they suggest may be cd galaxy haloes . however , there is a significant @xmath7-band alignment effect seen in 3c radio galaxies ( rigler et al .",
    "1992 ; dunlop & peacock 1993 ; ridgway & stockton 1997 ) which is not present in the 6c objects ( eales et al .",
    "also , the 6c and 7c samples follow similar @xmath37 relations despite the factor of five between the 6c and 7c flux limits ( rawlings et al .",
    "1997 ) , again consistent with the idea that the 3c galaxies are significantly contaminated by emission which scales with the power of the agn",
    ". estimates of the amount of agn light contributing in the @xmath7-band fall short of the amount required to explain the difference between the 3c and 6c/7c @xmath37 relations , however .",
    "rigler et al .  (",
    "1992 ) argue that the aligned component seen in the 3c galaxies contributes only @xmath38 per cent of the total near - infrared emission , and simpson , rawlings & lacy ( 1998 ) show that the effect of the reddened quasar nucleus is only about a 15 per cent correction to the mean magnitude at @xmath39 .",
    "this would predict that 3c galaxies should be about 0.25 mag brighter than 6c ones , compared to the 0.59 mag difference between the 3c and 6c mean galaxy magnitudes ( in 63.9 kpc apertures ) measured by eales et al .",
    "( 1997 ) . as",
    "yet there is also no direct evidence that the larger scale - sizes of the 3c radio galaxies are connected to the aligned light .",
    "nevertheless , the difference in the mean magnitudes of 3c and 6c galaxies after allowing for the contributions of aligned light and reddened quasar nuclei is sufficiently small that high spatial resolution infrared imaging and spectroscopy will probably be required to finally resolve this issue .",
    "a possible explanation for the scale difference we see in the alignments of the 3c and 7c radio galaxies is that the alignment mechanisms that operate at the large scales in the 3c are the most luminosity dependent .",
    "both scattering and nebular continuum could be argued to fall into this catagory provided enough material exists at large radius to intercept light from the hidden quasar .",
    "the small - scale alignment that we seem to see in the 7c sample indicates that some less luminosity - dependent alignment mechanism , effective at moderately small scales , may be contributing to the `` alignment effect '' that we see in radio sources .",
    "that the 3c alignments extend to larger scales could mean that this less - luminosity dependent alignment mechanism is swamped by other effects , such as scattering , in the more powerful radio sources .",
    "possible candidates for this small - scale alignment mechanism include jet - induced star formation , dust discs with axes parallel to the radio axis , and the selection effect of eales ( 1992 ) ( assuming the pa of the host galaxy is parallel to that of the major axis of the density distribution on the scale size of the radio source ) .",
    "in addition , there are two cases of more extended aligned light in the 7c sample . in both cases",
    "old stellar populations are seen in the brightest aligned components .",
    "they may be present due to selection effects , but jet - induced star formation with a peculiar imf can not be ruled out , and may explain the unusual morphology of the aligned light .",
    "the detection of alignment in the @xmath0 7c sample also suggests the alignment effect has a component which is truly due to cosmic evolution in the host galaxies of radio sources , and not just due to the increase in radio luminosity with redshift present in flux - limited samples .",
    "systematic observations of low redshift 3c radio galaxies in directly comparable wavebands are required to confirm this , however .",
    "the presence of an alignment mechanism ( or mechanisms ) which scales only weakly with radio luminosity may imply that even a fairly weak radio agn can influence the morphology and perhaps even stellar content of its host .",
    "this would have implications for attempts to search for old elliptical galaxies at high redshifts through spectroscopy of faint radio sources ( e.g.  dunlop et al .",
    "1996 ) . on the other hand , if dust lanes or selection effects are responsible , then such galaxies may be ideal for studying the oldest stellar populations at high redshift .",
    "it is thus important to establish what this small - scale alignment mechanism is , and it is clear that higher resolution observations of a fainter radio source sample than 3c would be of great help in this respect .",

    "<S> we present an optically - based study of the alignment between the radio axes and the optical major axes of eight @xmath0 radio galaxies in a 7c sample . </S>",
    "<S> the radio galaxies in this sample are @xmath1-times less radio luminous than 3c galaxies at the same redshift , and are significantly less radio - luminous than any other well - defined samples studied to date . using nordic optical telescope images taken in good seeing conditions at rest - frame wavelengths just longward of the 4000@xmath2break , we find a statistically significant alignment effect in the 7c sample . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , in two cases where the aligned components are well separated from the host we have been able to confirm spectroscopically that they are indeed at the same redshift as the radio galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> however , a quantitative analysis of the alignment in this sample and in a corresponding 3c sample from hst archival data indicates that the percentage of aligned flux may be lower and of smaller spatial scale in the 7c sample . </S>",
    "<S> our study suggests that alignments on the 50-kpc scale are probably closely related to the radio luminosity , whereas those on the 15 kpc scale are not . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss these results in the context of popular models for the alignment effect .    </S>",
