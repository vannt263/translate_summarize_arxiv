    "the interplay between spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) and topological band theory gives rise to a new state of quantum matter known as a topological insulator ( ti)@xcite in which band orderings become inverted in relation to their natural order at certain high symmetry points in the bulk brillouin zone .",
    "tis support spin - dependent conductive states at their boundaries while remaining insulating in the bulk , and are thus topologically distinct from the normal insulators .",
    "the topological surface states are protected by time reversal symmetry and exhibit nearly linear energy dispersion with unique spin - textures where spin is locked perpendicular to momentum .",
    "the topological protection guarantees backscattering - free transport at the boundaries of tis . due to the existence of these novel surface states ,",
    "the tis not only offer potential applications in quantum computing and spintronics@xcite , but also pave the way for realizing novel quantum phenomena such as weyl semimetals@xcite , majorana - fermions@xcite and higgs mechanism@xcite in a condensed matter system .",
    "first principles calculations have led to the prediction of a large number of three - dimensional ( 3d ) and two - dimensional ( 2d ) tis , which include 2d hgte / cdte quantum wells@xcite , bismuth and antimony based v@xmath0vi@xmath3 binary thermoelectrics@xcite , and many ternary compounds ranging from the tl - compounds to the half - heusler family , among others@xcite .",
    "tis usually feature a band inversion , driven by the high soc associated with the heavier atoms in the material , at the time reversal invariant momenta ( trim ) in the bulk brillouin zone .",
    "thus the tuning of soc can provide a pathway for inducing topological phase transitions ( tpt ) from the normal to the topological insulator state .",
    "one approach is to undertake chemical tuning , which however often entails uncontrolled effects of chemical disorder .",
    "another common approach is to attempt modifying the band topology by adjusting lattice constants or internal atomic positions in the unit cell@xcite .",
    "many theoretical studies show that a 2d ti or a quantum spin hall ( qsh ) insulator , along with tpts therein , are possible by tuning the thickness of quantum wells or via reduced dimensionality of 3d tis in the form of thin - films .",
    "the band topology of the thin films can also be controlled through an external transverse electric field@xcite , which could be provided by the substrate and/or controlled via gating . despite many theoretical proposals",
    ", the qsh state has been realized to date only in hgte / cdte and inas / gasb / alsb quantum well systems@xcite .",
    "the need for finding new 2d materials , in which the qsh state tpts can be realized , is thus clear .    in this paper , using systematic _ ab - inito _ calculations , we show that a 3d topological insulating phase as well a tpt can be induced in tlbis@xmath0 through external strain , and that thin films of this material can realize the qsh phase and undergo a tpt as a function of external electric field .",
    "tlbis@xmath0 is found to be a trivial insulator both theoretically and experimentally with a direct band gap at the @xmath1 point.@xcite it exhibits a layered crystal structure with strong ionic and covalent type bonds within as well as between the layers . in sharp contrast , in the bi@xmath0se@xmath3 family of compounds,@xcite blocks of layers are held together by weak van der waals type bonding .",
    "the strong bonding between the layers in tlbis@xmath0 , on the other hand , makes this system a good prototype for the tuning and inversion of the band gap via the interlayer distance .",
    "bearing the preceding considerations in mind , we delineate in this study the evolution of topological band order in tlbis@xmath0 with strain .",
    "our analysis shows that a 3d - tpt occurs when a compressive strain is applied along the ( 111 ) direction , yielding an inverted band gap larger than 250 mev . the critical point between the normal and topological phase",
    "is accompanied by the formation of a single 3d bulk dirac cone at the bulk brillouin zone center with a nearly linear energy dispersion over a substantial energy range .",
    "our slab computations further show that the ( 111 ) surface of strained tlbis@xmath0 supports a single dirac cone surface state at the @xmath1-point .",
    "this surface state displays a large in - plane spin - polarization with small hexagonal warping effects .",
    "moreover , we show that a 2d tpt as well as the qsh state can be realized in thin films of pristine tlbis@xmath0 through an out - of - the - plane electric field .",
    "the critical point in this case supports six spin - polarized dirac cones along the @xmath4 directions .",
    "finally , we discuss a simple @xmath2 model hamiltonian that captures the salient features of our first - principles bulk and surface states in tlbis@xmath0 .",

    "surface relaxation is well - known to play an important role in slab computations@xcite , and therefore , all atomic positions were optimized until the residual force on each atom was less than 0.005 ev/. in order to resolve spin - textures of topological states , we carried out computations on a fine k - mesh in the vicinity of the dirac point , and obtained the three spin components at each k - point from the expectation values of the three pauli spin matrices @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",

    "when we include the soc , a large shift in the energies of all the bands occurs throughout the bulk brillouin zone ( bz ) , and the band gap shrinks significantly to a value of 0.26 ev [ fig .",
