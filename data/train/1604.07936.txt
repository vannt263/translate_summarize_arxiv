    "the research on the collective behavior of _ identical _ oscillators has been revitalized with the discovery of chimera @xcite .",
    "kuramoto and battogtokh @xcite discovered that the population of identical oscillators is subdivided into two incongruous domains : in one domain the neighboring oscillators are synchronized whereas in another domain the oscillators are desynchronized .",
    "this intriguing spatiotemporal state was named as chimera by strogatz @xcite and it has been in the center of attention over the last decade . after its discovery in phase oscillators under nonlocal coupling by kuramoto and battogtokh @xcite",
    "other chimera states have also been discovered .",
    "amplitude mediated chimera was reported in @xcite where , under strong _ global coupling _ , a network of complex ginzberg - landau oscillators show fluctuations in both the phase and amplitude part in the incoherent region .",
    "later , _ amplitude chimera _ was discovered by @xcite where all the oscillators in a network have the same phase velocity but differ in amplitude in the incoherent region .",
    "recently , chimera state is observed in _",
    "nearest neighbor coupling @xcite also , which proves that a nonlocal or strong global coupling is not an essential requirement to achieve chimera .",
    "the robustness of chimera has been proved through a series of experiments : the first experimental observation of chimera was reported in optical system @xcite and chemical oscillators @xcite .",
    "later , chimera has been observed experimentally in several other systems ; for example , in mechanical system @xcite and time - delay laser system @xcite to name a few .",
    "recently , @xcite reports the experimental observation of chimera state in globally coupled minimal network of four optoelectronic oscillators .",
    "apart from these man - made experimental setups the occurrence of chimera has been reported in real physical and biological systems : for example in squid meta material @xcite , ecology @xcite , and quantum system @xcite .",
    "ever since its discovery , the chimera state has been strongly connected to the several neuronal processes , like unihemispheric slow - wave - sleep of some mammals in aquatic species , like dolphin , eared seals and manatees @xcite , and some migratory birds @xcite . during slow - wave - sleep , these species shut - down only one cerebral hemisphere of the brain , and close the opposite eye . during this time",
    ", the other half of the brain monitors what is going in the environment ( for migratory birds ) and controls breathing functions ( for aquatic mammals ) .",
    "it strongly indicates that in the awake part of the cerebral hemisphere , neuronal oscillators are desynchronized while in the sleepy part neuronal oscillators are very much synchronized , which resemblances the chimera state .",
    "therefore , systematic studies on chimera in neuronal systems deserve special attention .",
    "earlier works on network of neuronal oscillators considered fitzhaugh - nagumo model having type - ii excitability @xcite and sniper model of type - i excitability @xcite ; those works deal with the spiking neurons ( as those models could not produce bursting behavior ) . in this context neuronal oscillation modeled by the hindmarsh - rose ( hr )",
    "model is much more realistic because , depending upon parameter values it shows both type - i and type - ii excitability and can produce a plethora of physiologically relevant neuronal oscillations , like square wave bursting ( both periodic and chaotic ) , plateau bursting , spiking , mixed mode bursting , etc .",
    "@xcite reported the occurrence of chimera in a network of hr - neuron under nonlocal coupling .",
    "but the considered nonlocal coupling has an ideal rectangular kernel , which has less biological relevance as per as the coupling function is concerned .    in this context ,",
    "synaptic coupling is one of the most realistic coupling schemes through which neurons are connected . in the context of inter - neuronal communication",
    "two variants of synapses exist : chemical and electrical synapse .",
    "@xcite considered the chemical synaptic coupling with nonlocal , global and local nearest neighbor coupling topology and established the occurrence of chimera .",
    "but in that work , only excitatory coupling with symmetric synaptic coupling strength was considered in all three coupling topologies .",
    "normally , in a network of neuronal oscillators both excitatory and inhibitory interactions are present @xcite . in the absence of time delay , in general , fast excitatory coupling leads to synchronization and fast inhibitory coupling promotes anti synchronization .",
    "@xcite showed that the synergistic effect of excitation and inhibition leads to complete synchronization ( i.e. , synchrony in both burst and spike ) with lesser coupling threshold .",
    "thus , it is important to study their simultaneous effect on the occurrence of multi - cluster synchrony or chimera state .",
    "the simultaneous effect of excitatory and inhibitory coupling is best represented by _",
    "gradient coupling _ : in this coupling scheme , one can control the strength of excitation and inhibition by simply controlling the parameter associated with the gradient coupling .",
    "earlier the effect of the gradient coupling was studied in the context of oscillation suppression in nonlinear oscillators with time - delay diffusive coupling @xcite , synchronization of nonlinear coupled systems @xcite and control of spatiotemporal chaotic systems @xcite , but its influence on the occurrence of chimera has not been studied yet .    in this paper , for the first time , we investigate the effect of local chemical _",
    "synaptic gradient _ coupling on the occurrence of chimera state .",
    "we choose a network of identical square - wave bursting hindmarsh - rose neuronal oscillators and show that depending upon the proper choice of the coupling parameter associated with the gradient coupling we can attain three different coupling topologies , namely _ one - way _ excitatory local coupling , nearest neighbor _ asymmetric _ excitatory coupling and _ simultaneous excitatory - inhibitory _ coupling .",
    "remarkably , we find chimera even in the _ one - way _ excitatory local coupling that further relaxes the essential requirement of getting chimera in a network . we identify and confirm the occurrence of a new chimera pattern , namely the",
    "_ imperfect traveling chimera _ in the network with nearest neighbor asymmetric excitatory coupling .",
    "we further map in parameter space the transitions among chimera patterns , synchronized state , and amplitude death state with the variation of the synaptic and gradient coupling strengths .",

    "we have observed the imperfect traveling chimera for asymmetric excitatory coupling . whereas for the one - way excitatory coupling and also for simultaneous excitatory - inhibitory coupling",
    "we have observed traveling chimera : although the direction of travel in those states are reversed .",
    "we also observed pronounced change in the time series of the neuronal oscillators : for predominating excitation , square - wave bursting changes to plateau bursting and then amplitude death occurs ; in contrast , when both inhibitory and excitatory coupling are present , with the increase of gradient coupling strength ( @xmath28 ) square - wave bursting eventually changes into the spiking behavior .",
    "since here we have considered a nearest neighbor and one - way local coupling thus it is intuitive to observe traveling wave solutions but it is _ counter - intuitive _ to observe chimera patterns .",
    "the present study is important in the context of neuroscience in the sense that this study gives evidence that local synaptic ( gradient ) coupling not only provides synchrony @xcite or amplitude death @xcite but under certain circumstances it may drive the neuronal network to chimera state .",
