    "are perturbative corrections to the coulomb potential which are known to two loops  @xcite .",
    "the static potential for a color singlet @xmath16 pair is often defined in terms of the expectation value of a rectangular wilson loop of width @xmath17 and length @xmath18 : @xmath19 the feynman diagrams corresponding to this expectation value build up the exponential of the static potential . as a result , in computing the static potential @xmath15 at order @xmath20 ,",

    "the potential @xmath6 is computed as a matching coefficient at the scale @xmath29 between qcd and an effective theory for non - relativistic qcd valid below the scale @xmath30 .",
    "the effective theory is constructed to have the same infrared structure as perturbative qcd for the two heavy quark system .",
    "therefore , defining the potential as a matching coefficient provides an infrared safe definition .",
    "for instance , ref .",
    "@xcite shows how the three - loop matching potential @xmath6 is infrared safe , despite the divergence in the qcd potential of appelquist , dine and muzinich@xcite .",
    "although several different formulations of the effective theory for non - relativistic qcd are currently in use  @xcite , certain universal features have emerged .",
    "the on - shell degrees of freedom in the effective theory include quarks with energy @xmath31 and momentum @xmath32 , soft gluons with @xmath33 , and ultrasoft gluons with @xmath34 .",
    "the soft and ultrasoft modes are distinct , for instance a consistent power counting in @xmath4 demands that the ultrasoft gluon interactions are multipole expanded@xcite , while soft gluon interactions are not .",
    "the soft gluons are essential to correctly reproduce the beta function in the effective theory  @xcite , and run between the scales @xmath30 and @xmath8 .",
    "other massless on - shell fields , such as light quarks , will have ultrasoft and soft components too .",
    "there are also important off - shell field components , such as the exchange of gluons with @xmath31 and @xmath32 that build up the potential .",
    "soft heavy quarks with @xmath33 are also off - shell relative to the heavy quark states of interest .",
    "these off - shell field components can be integrated out of the lagrangian in the effective theory .",
    "doing this leaves a lagrangian that is non - local at the scale @xmath8 , but local at @xmath9 .",
    "this procedure , which treats the potential components as four quark operators , was first seriously investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite , and the resulting effective theory is referred to as pnrqcd . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was proposed that the matching onto effective theories should take place in two stages : at @xmath29 one matches qcd onto nrqcd as originally defined in ref .",
    "@xcite , and then matches nrqcd onto pnrqcd at the scale @xmath35 .",
    "the matching of four - quark operators at @xmath30 was considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , following the proposal in ref .",
    "@xcite that the matching procedure should be similar to that in hqet .",
    "however , in general this procedure seems to be slightly problematic@xcite .",
    "first note that it is necessary to include the kinetic term for the potential quarks immediately below the scale @xmath30 .",
    "for instance , this is necessary to reproduce the threshold value of the two - loop anomalous dimension for the heavy quark production current @xcite in the effective theory @xcite . with",
    "the kinetic energy term included at leading order , the consistency of the @xmath4 power counting forces us to have both ultrasoft and soft modes _ right below _",
    "@xmath30 ( along with the multipole expansion etc . ) .",
    "if we note that the kinetic energy term is necessary to correctly reproduce the coulombic infrared divergences in the effective theory , then it might seem obvious that it must be included in order to have the correct infrared structure . at one - loop ,",
    "matching exactly at threshold in dimensional regularization seemed to provide a method of avoiding this  @xcite , but this procedure fails at two - loops .",
    "since we must include the kinetic energy term for all @xmath36 it seems quite natural to immediately consider matching at @xmath29 onto an effective theory where the off - shell potential gluons and soft quarks have been integrated out .",
    "such a formulation was proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite and will be considered in this paper .",
    "it will be referred to as vnrqcd . in this theory",
    "it is more appropriate to consider the running from @xmath30 to the scales @xmath8 and @xmath9 in a single step .",
    "this is accomplished by using the velocity renormalization group  @xcite .",
    "once the vnrqcd effective theory has been run down to the low scale the soft degrees of freedom have served their purpose and may be integrated out . in this final effective theory",
    "no additional running needs to be considered .    in this paper",
    "we compute the one - loop matching for the @xmath37 and @xmath38 potentials between qcd and vnrqcd up to corrections of order @xmath0 .",

    "@xcite and @xcite is the way in which large logarithms of @xmath4 are summed in the effective theory .",
    "there is also some difference in the matching corrections ; some contributions in vnrqcd that arise at the scale @xmath29 are instead computed at @xmath39 in pnrqcd .",
    "we will discuss the differences between the two approaches in the text of the paper .",

    "( [ ratio ] ) is of order unity , and can not be treated as small .",
    "for this reason , in section  ii we redo the qcd calculation keeping the full dependence on this ratio for both the color singlet and octet channels . for the order @xmath44 spin - independent potential , terms proportional to @xmath45 which were dropped in previous calculations @xcite are necessary to match infrared divergences between the full and effective theories .    in section iii",
    "we discuss the order @xmath44 potential of the form @xmath46 for free quark states this potential vanishes on - shell by energy conservation , @xmath47 , and need not be included in the potential if one uses on - shell matching  @xcite .",
