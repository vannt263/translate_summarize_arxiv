    "the subject of gravitational lensing by black holes has received great attention in the last decade , basically due to the strong evidence about the presence of supermassive black holes at the center of galaxies , including ours @xcite .",
    "the study of black hole gravitational lenses can be simplified by using the strong deflection limit , which is an approximate analytical method for obtaining the positions , magnifications , and time delays of the images .",
    "it was introduced by darwin @xcite for the schwarzschild geometry , rediscovered by several authors @xcite , extended to reissner - nordstrm geometry @xcite , and to general spherically symmetric black holes @xcite .",
    "kerr black holes were also analyzed adopting the strong deflection limit @xcite .",
    "numerical studies @xcite were done too .",
    "another related aspect that was considered , with the intention of measuring the properties of astrophysical black holes , are the shadows cast by rotating ones @xcite , which present an optical deformation caused by the spin , instead of being circles as in the non - rotating case .",
    "this subject have been recently re - examined by several authors @xcite in the belief that the direct observation of black holes will be possible in the next years .",
    "black holes coming from alternative theories @xcite , braneworld cosmologies @xcite and even naked singularities @xcite were considered as lenses . in the recent review article by bozza @xcite ,",
    "these topics are discussed with more detail , including the observational prospects and additional references .",
    "+ the problem of singularities in general relativity , where the theory breaks down , is a long standing one , involving both black holes and cosmological solutions .",
    "regular black holes are solutions of the equations of gravity for which an event horizon is present , but the spacetime is free from singularities .",
    "the first regular black hole was introduced by bardeen @xcite .",
    "this solution has both an event and a cauchy horizons , but with a regular center , and it was shown by borde @xcite that the absence of the singularity is related to topology change . in bardeen model",
    "the singularity is replaced by a de sitter core .",
    "the bardeen black hole can be interpreted as a magnetic solution of the einstein equations coupled to nonlinear electrodynamics @xcite .",
    "other spherically symmetric black holes with a regular center were studied by several authors , mainly in the context of non - linear electrodynamics @xcite ( for a recent review see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . + in this article , we study gravitational lensing by a regular bardeen black hole , in the strong deflection limit .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "2 we find the strong deflection limit approximation for the deflection angle ; in sec .",
    "3 we obtain the positions and magnifications of the relativistic images and we calculate the observables corresponding to the supermassive galactic black hole ; finally , in sec 4 we summarize the results obtained .",
    "bardeen black holes are described by a spherically symmetric metric of the form @xmath0 where the metric functions , working in geometrized units ( speed of light in vacuum c=1 and gravitational constant g=1 ) , are given by @xcite @xmath1 with @xmath2 being the mass and @xmath3 a constant , which can be interpreted as a charge in the context of nonlinear electrodynamics @xcite .",
    "for @xmath4 we recover the schwarzschild geometry , which has a singularity at its center . when @xmath5 this metric is regular everywhere , with a de sitter behavior for small values of the radial coordinate @xmath6 , and an asymptotically schwarzschild behavior for large @xmath6",

    "we have found that when @xmath118 increases , the relativistic images are closer to the black hole .",
    "the angular separation @xmath69 also grows with @xmath118 , which means that the first relativistic image and the asymptotic limit of the angular positions of the images are more separated than in the case of the schwarzschild black hole .",

    "then , for a bardeen black hole , the first relativistic image is less intense with respect to the others than in the schwarzschild geometry .",
