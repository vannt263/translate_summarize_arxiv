    "suffers from detrimental effects related to resonant interactions mediated by photons .",
    "for example , state - of - the - art in situ florescence detection  @xcite can not image an optical lattice site with more than one atom occupancy without losing the extra atoms in pairs .",
    "similarly , absorption imaging is perturbed by resonant dipole interactions , and the atomic density information can not be faithfully retrieved via the beer - lambert law  @xcite . to mitigate the effect one may saturate the atomic transition with a strong probe , resulting in images with excessive photon shot noise  @xcite . off resonant imaging  @xcite",
    "provides a solution to the density dependent line - broadening problem , since the variation of probe light phase shift due to line shape changes vanishes at large detuning .",
    "however , the magnitude of the phase shift due to a single atom reduces with detuning , while the phase shift sensitivity is limited by the photon shot noise as @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the average number of probe photons detected by a pixel . imaging with optimal use of the sensor depth and at the photon shot",
    "noise limit is essential for detecting the weak probe absorption / phase shift from few or single atoms . since @xmath5 , the maximum pixel count , it is difficult with phase - contrast imaging to achieve a sensitivity below 5  mrad using standard cameras , and the amount of detuning allowed for off - resonant detection of cold atoms is correspondingly limited .",
    "this work is motivated by an advantage of holographic microscopy  @xcite , that has to our knowledge been overlooked : it has the capability of detecting objects with weak phase shift / absorption ( e.g. mrad/@xmath6 level ) , such as with off - resonant imaging of single atoms , where the probe photon shot noise may prohibit detection using standard imaging techniques with a regular camera ( e.g. with @xmath7 ) .",

    ", approaches implemented to overcome the twin - image problem in cold atom imaging fall into two categories : firstly , spatial heterodyning can be explored to uniquely determine the phase of @xmath8 in an interferometric setup  @xcite .",
    "indeed , outside of cold atom research , spatial and/or temporal heterodyning methods have been developed for shot - noise limited holography  @xcite .",
    "however , the heterodyning setup is complex and typically has a limited na and spatial resolution .",
    "secondly , with simple setups , defocus - contrast imaging  @xcite and diffraction contrast imaging  @xcite exploit the monomorphous responsivity of atoms .",
    "however , these methods are limited to detecting an atomic sample with a uniform refractive index while its real part must be negative , and the methods do not completely suppress the so - called dc noise , as will be detailed in this paper .",
    "proposals for cold atom imaging  @xcite with phase shifting ( temporal heterodyning ) holography  @xcite promise twin image removal with fast reconstruction , but demand multiple and typically slow exposures .    in this work , we present the first demonstration of diffraction limited holographic imaging of cold atoms with photon shot - noise limited sensitivity .",
    "we introduce a hybrid geometry ( fig .",
    "[ fig1]b ) to solve the twin image problem , and demonstrate shot noise limited holographic imaging in the presence of laser speckle noise .",
    "furthermore , by taking advantage of point source holographic recording , we achieve @xmath11  mrad phase shift and @xmath12 absorption sensitivities , beyond the photon shot noise limit imposed by @xmath13 in standard imaging  @xcite .",
    "our atom detection sensitivity is near the single atom level with resonant probing , which is achieved at na=0.075 and thus a moderate resolution of @xmath14 m . by improving the spatial resolution to the wavelength limit , which would not require precision high - na optics  @xcite",
    ", we expect dramatic improvement of the detection sensitivity , allowing precise phase imaging of confined atoms with single atom resolution . with these features ,",
    "we discuss the method for off - resonant imaging of high density ultra - cold gases , and for non - destructive probing of optical lattices with multiple atom occupancy per site .",
    "our approach to retrieval of @xmath8 from holograms is an extension of the gerchberg - saxton iterative method  @xcite for localized samples with concrete supports  @xcite . as detailed here , by increasing the information contained in the reference field @xmath10 , our hybrid geometry helps to improve both the speed and robustness of the @xmath8 convergence , even for samples with large spatial extent , signal near the photon shot noise level , and no presumption on the sample polarizability  @xcite .",
    "the major disadvantages of our method include a factor - of - two reduction in signal compared to standard absorption / phase contrast imaging , a low dynamic range for atom signal detection which arises from speckle noise , and iterative reconstruction preventing instantaneous imaging .",

    "although we reach the shot - noise limit for small samples , the speckle induced blurring ( figs .",
    "[ fig2]b ,  [ fig4]b ) limits the magnitude of the snr for samples with large optical depth .",
    "the effect depends on the location of the scatterers that generate the speckle noise .",
    "our maximum snr @xmath191 suggests a maximum phase shift ( absorption ) of 60 mrad ( @xmath192 ) before speckle noise noticeably affects imaging .",
    "including @xmath99 into the reference field phase estimation , as in our preliminary additional work , shows substantial speckle noise suppression  @xcite for imaging samples with larger optical depth .",
    "the largest retrievable phase shift @xmath193 is related to the instability in removing the intense dc term ( eq .  ( [ eq : eh ] ) , sec .  [ secdc ] ) , a topic needing further investigation . in our setup , with an extended sample where the camera is at the near field of @xmath8 , we find that @xmath194  rad , while for smaller samples @xmath195 can be larger .    the lengthy numerical process may be sped up with advanced algorithms  @xcite and processing reconstructions using graphics processing units .",

    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the aberration in the latter case is self - suppressed due to the common optical paths for @xmath8 and @xmath10 when @xmath198 , and can be further corrected numerically . with a factor of 10 increase in na to 0.7 and using a camera with q=0.8 ( q=0.1 in this work )",

    ", the @xmath13-limited sensitivity @xmath153 can be improved further , even if the camera is magnified by lenses . with a spin - polarized sample to increase @xmath201 , @xmath202 should be achievable for @xmath203 , allowing off - resonant imaging with single atom sensitivity .",
    "this could be a favorable scenario for precise phase imaging of cold atoms at high density , where the line shift / broadening due to multiple scatterings has been shown to prevent faithful and efficient resonant imaging  @xcite .",
    "we conclude by mentioning the possibility of non - destructive probing of multiple atoms in single sites of an optical lattice  @xcite .",
    "the idea is based on optical shielding  @xcite : blue detuned light enhances the repulsion between symmetrically excited atom pairs . in the proposed scheme ,",
    "atoms are trapped in single lattice sites with strong @xmath204 confinement . a blue detuned probe and auxiliary cooling beams , all with polarization in the @xmath205 plane , switch on adiabatically so that atoms confined in single sites find new equilibrium positions separated along @xmath206 .",
    "the blue - detuned molasses should allow sub - doppler cooling of the atom array confined in the lattice site for continuous , holographic detection of the probe light phase shift / absorption as in this work .",
    "more investigations are needed to confirm the applicability of this method , which may substantially extend the range of observables in quantum gas microscopy  @xcite .",

    "reconstruction of the @xmath21 focal point also provides an estimate of the relative phase @xmath225 between @xmath21 and @xmath23 .",

    "we apply a mask that blocks the geometric shadow of the sample in @xmath9 and @xmath28 .",
