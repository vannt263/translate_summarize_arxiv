    "the xmm-_newton _ data were calibrated and analyzed with the xmm science analysis system ( sas ) version 10.0.0 . to exclude high background activity , which can affect the observations ,",
    "we extracted light curves of photons above 10 kev from the entire field - of - view of the cameras , and excluded time intervals with count rate higher than 3 @xmath15 above average to produce a gti file . unfortunately , the observation obsid 0503780301 was affected by a high and variable soft proton background level ( lumb et al .",
    "2002 ) , whereas the other one obsid 0550170101 is unaffected by background fluctuations . in order to avoid contamination for high background patterns ,",
    "hereafter our analysis concerns only the second observation .",

    "the x - ray emission of the snr peaks in the 0.53.0 kev energy range and it is clearly dominated by thermal emission .",
    "thus , we used a pshock model affected by an absorption interstellar model ( phabs ; balucinska - church and mccammon 1992 ) to fit it .",

    "the background spectrum was estimated from an annular region with radii of 8 and 25 arcsec .",
    "the spectrum of the source is shown in figure 2 ( right panel ) .    in order to study the x - ray properties of this compact source we fitted its spectrum with several spectral models . however , due to the low - photons statistic , the most representative one is a simple power - law ( pl ) model that yields a neutral hydrogen absorption column @xmath1=0.55 @xmath140.1 @xmath5 , an index @xmath39=4.3 @xmath140.7 and a normalization of 6.1(@xmath142.5)@xmath310@xmath40 @xmath5 .",

    "this fact , supports the possibility that the point source detected at the geometrical centre of the snr has a real physical connexion with g296.8 - 0.3 .",
    "in addition , we found no significant pulsed signal with a period greater than twice the read - out time of the epic - pn camera in the ff mode ( 73.3 ms ) , which corresponds to a nyquist limit of 0.146 s.",

    "these images were re - processed with the regular mips pipeline ( version s18.7.0 ) , and then mosaicked using mopex ( version 18.3.1 ) and the standard mips 24@xmath11 m mosaic pipeline .    in fig .",

    "is strongly correlated with the radio shells , with several faint filaments coincident on the northwest and southeast parts of the snr .",

    "two possible evolutionary scenarios to explain the unusual morphology observed at radio frequencies in snr g296.8@xmath00.3 , were initially studied by gaensler et al .",
    "these authors suggested that the biannular appearance is induced by axial symmetry in the progenitor wind , or the snr morphology resulted from the inhomogeneous ism into which it is expanding .",
    "they conclude that the second possibility is more probable and that g296.8@xmath00.3 seems consistent with being the remnant of a single explosion , where the unusual linear feature running north - south through the remnant may represent a low density tunnel which has been re - energized by an encounter with the sn shock .",
    "it is clear that g296.8 - 0.3 is found in a complex area in the scutum - crux arm of our galaxy , where the ism is particularly inhomogeneous and density variations in the pre - shock medium are present .",
    "the radio , infrared and x - ray observations of g296.8 - 0.3 here analyzed , can provide crucial information about the origin and evolution of the snr , as well as regarding the age , energetics , ambient conditions and the presence of heated dust .",
    "with all this information in mind , we could outline a possible framework that allows to explain the characteristics of the emissions observed from the snr .",
    "the xmm observations reveal that there is diffuse x - ray emission in the interior of the snr well - correlated with the unusual rectangular strip running through its center seen at radio frequencies , a bright soft shell - like feature coincident with the internal northwest radio shell , and several hard point - like sources ( possibly background agns ) .",
    "moreover , the 24 @xmath11 m observations show two limb - brightened shell - like structures on the northwest and southeast parts of the snr , and faint filaments strongly correlated with the radio shells .",
    "the emission measure ( em ) computed for the global region of the snr can allow us to estimate the corresponding density of the x - ray emitting gas . from the x - ray image",
    ", we can roughly assume that the x - ray emission fills an ellipsoid with radii of @xmath2 3 @xmath3 4 arcmin and estimate the volume @xmath37 of the x - ray emitting plasma .",
    "at a distance of 9 kpc , the snr defines an x - ray emitting volume @xmath54= 6.1@xmath310@xmath55 @xmath56 . based on the em determined by the spectral fitting ( see table 1 )",
    ", we can estimate the electron density of the plasma , @xmath57 , by @xmath57=@xmath58 , which results in @xmath57@xmath2 0.18 @xmath9 . in this case , the number density of the nucleons was simply assumed to be the same as that of electrons .",
    "the age @xmath59 is determined from the ionization timescale , @xmath60 , by @xmath59=@xmath60/@xmath57 . therefore , the elapsed time after the plasma was heated is @xmath59 @xmath2 1.0@xmath310@xmath61 yr .",
    "this result shows that g296.8@xmath00.3 is a middle - aged snr .",
    "assuming that the snr is in the adiabatic ( sedov - taylor ) phase , gaensler et al .",
    "( 1998 ) obtained several physical parameters for the object .",
    "taking into account a kinetic energy of the initial explosion of @xmath62= 10@xmath63 erg , and that the snr expands in an ism with a density of 0.2 @xmath9 , these authors computed an age of @xmath59=(10@xmath142)@xmath310@xmath64 yr for g296.8 - 0.3 .",
    "this value agrees very well with the age obtained by us above using the x - ray information .      concerning the point - like x - ray source located close to the geometrical center of the radio structure , we see no significant variability that disfavors an accreting binary origin , a soft thermal spectrum that eliminates a background active nucleus , lack of radio counterpart , and absence of a surrounding pulsar wind nebula . at first sight",
    ", we can see that the source displays some characteristics of the so - called cco ( see pavlov et al .",
    "2004 , for a review ) , a new population of isolated neutron stars ( nss ) with clear differences from isolated rotation - powered pulsars and accretion - powered x - ray pulsars in close binary systems .",
    "the nature of these objects is still unclear .",
    "it is thought that the x - ray emission from ccos is generally due to the thermal cooling of the ns ( e.g zavlin , trumper & pavlov 1999 ) , with typical temperatures of a few 10@xmath65 k , as inferred from their thermal - like spectra .",
    "they have x - ray luminosities ( @xmath66 ) in the range of 10@xmath67 - 10@xmath68 erg s@xmath13 and display x - ray spectra characterized by a blackbody model with temperatures ( @xmath7 ) in the range of 0.2 - 0.5 kev or a power - law model with very steep index @xmath39 ( see pavlov et al .",
    "halpern & gotthelf ( 2010 ) have recently suggested that these objects could be weakly magnetized nss ( @xmath69 g ) , i.e. , a kind of `` anti - magnetars '' .    in order to check the characteristics of 2xmmi j115836.1 - 623516 , we computed its @xmath66 and spin - down luminosity @xmath70 , to compare with other well - known ccos ( pavlov et al .",

    "these results suggest that the system g296.8 - 0.3/2xmmi j115836.1 - 623516 is a thermal snr with , possibly , a nondetected ns .",
    "plausible reasons for the nondetection of a ns are the low - photon statistic , a short rotation period or unfavorable geometrical conditions .",
    "we have analyzed radio , infrared and x - ray data of the snr g296.8 - 0.3 to investigate the origin of the radiative process involved in the generation of the emission observed .",
    "the diffuse x - ray emission is clearly correlated with the unusual rectangular strip running through its center seen at radio frequencies , where we found a region with significant lower density , and a bright x - ray shell - like feature at the northwest part of the snr coincident with the internal boundary of the radio shell .",
    "the 24 @xmath11 m observations show two limb - brightened shell - like structures on the northwest and southeast parts of the snr , and faint filaments strongly correlated with the radio shells .",
