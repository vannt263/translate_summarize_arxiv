    "in recent years much effort has been devoted to the study of the inequivalence of ensembles of systems with long - range interactions @xcite .",
    "systems where the interaction decays as @xmath3 , with @xmath4 less than or equal to the dimension of the system , are said to be of long - range .",
    "such systems are non - additive , meaning that interface energies between macroscopic systems are not negligible compared to the bulk energies .",
    "non - additive , long - range interacting systems are found in many areas of physics , prominent examples being self - gravitating systems @xcite and spin systems of mean field nature @xcite . some characteristics of long - range interactions have also been observed in driven systems with only local stochastic dynamics @xcite",
    ". an important feature of systems with long - range interactions is that thermodynamical properties can be dependent on from which ensemble they were derived @xcite . for example , the specific heat in the canonical ensemble is always positive , but may become negative in the microcanonical ensemble @xcite . for more features , intricacies and examples of long - range systems we refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "it has been conjectured in @xcite that a necessary condition for ensemble inequivalence to occur in statistical long - range interacting systems is that the system undergoes a first - order phase transition .",
    "this statement has not yet been proven generally , but has been put on a solid basis for many cases in @xcite .",
    "a paradigmatic system with long - range interactions is the infinite - range @xmath0-spin model , also known as the ising model with infinite - range @xmath0-body interactions .",
    "notable variants are the blume - capel @xcite and the blume - emery - griffiths @xcite models in the infinite - range limit , in which @xmath1 and a spin can take the values @xmath5 . it was shown in @xcite and @xcite that the blume - capel model and a model with infinite - range and short - range interactions exhibit ensemble inequivalence in the region of their phase diagram where first - order transitions occur . also , a generalized xy model with two - body ( @xmath1 ) and four - body @xmath6 was studied in the microcanonical ensemble in @xcite .",
    "it has not been studied , however , what would happen if a long - range interacting system has randomness .",
    "this problem is of interest , because it is the target of extensive studies in the field of spin glasses @xcite .",
    "almost all calculations so far have been done in the canonical ensemble for spin glasses with many - body interactions .",
    "it should be necessary to check if any different results may be derived in the microcanonical ensemble .",
    "it is quite difficult to analyze spin glass systems with many - body interactions using the microcanonical ensemble .",
    "even the analysis in the canonical ensemble is plagued by the complications of replica symmetry breaking @xcite , and we will have to develop ingenious methods to treat systems with randomness in the context of the microcanonical ensemble .",
    "we therefore set our goal more modest in the present paper and study the random - field ising model with @xmath0-body interactions in the hope that some general features of the interplay between many - body interactions , randomness and first - order transitions may manifest themselves , leading to non - trivial consequences in ensemble inequivalence already in this relatively simple random system .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : model ] we introduce the model and derive the thermodynamic potentials , the free energy in the canonical ensemble and the entropy in the microcanonical ensemble , and discuss some of their general features . in section  [ sec : comparison ]",
    "we compare the phase diagrams of both ensembles and discuss their differences .",

    "in this section we introduce the ferromagnetic @xmath0-spin model (= ising model with @xmath0-body interactions ) in random fields , derive the thermodynamical potentials in the canonical and microcanonical ensembles for later comparison in section  [ sec : comparison ] .",
    "the ferromagnetic @xmath0-spin model in external fields describes a system of @xmath7 spins , in our case ising spins ( @xmath8 ) , with infinite - range @xmath0-body interactions and each site is subject to a random external field .",
    "it is defined by the hamiltonian , @xmath9 with @xmath10 . throughout this study",
    "we will set @xmath11 without loss of generality .",
    "the external field is assumed to obey a quenched bimodal distribution given by @xmath12",
    "the partition function can be calculated in the standard manner by the introduction two auxiliary fields @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the inverse temperature .",
    "evaluating this integral by the saddle point method , together with the saddle - point equations @xmath15 leads to the mean - field free energy per spin , @xmath16 where @xmath17 obeys the self - consistent equation @xmath18 we have used the self - averaging property @xcite ( meaning that @xmath19 is equal to the configurational average of @xmath20 for sufficiently large @xmath7 , where @xmath21 is some physical quantity ) to rewrite the site average in the first line of ( [ eqn : cn_f ] ) by the randomness average in the second line .",

    "it is seen that the entropy for this case with a first - order transition is not a continuous function of the magnetization for energies lower than @xmath26 , which lies below the critical energy for the phase transition , @xmath27 .",

    "the calculations are straightforward , as sketched in [ sec : app_entropy ] , and the result is @xmath32 in the microcanonical ensemble , the basic strategy , corresponding to the free - energy minimization in the canonical ensemble , is the maximization of the entropy .",
    "see figure  [ fig : mc_entropies ] for the entropy as a function of the magnetization at different energies for @xmath1 .",
    "we have a paramagnetic phase , when the entropy at @xmath23 is the global maximum .",
    "when the transition is second order as in figure  [ fig : mc_entropies ] a ) , the entropy flattens around @xmath23 as the energy decreases and develops a maximum at a non - zero value of the magnetization , while the region around @xmath23 becomes a minimum , which implies an instability of the paramagnetic phase . in the case of a first - order transition ( figure  [ fig : mc_entropies ] b ) ) , as the energy decreases , the entropy develops a second maximum , and at a critical value @xmath33 the two maxima are of equal height .",
    "as the energy decreases further , this second maximum dominates . at some energy",
    "@xmath26 the entropy becomes a discontinuous function of the magnetization and the ergodicity is broken : intermediate values of the magnetization are not allowed , and consequently , the system in the low-@xmath17 region can not evolve dynamically to the high-@xmath17 region . as a consequence ,",
    "the metastable state with @xmath23 has a divergent relaxation time @xcite .",
    "the energy , where ergodicity is broken , lies below the critical energy @xmath27 for @xmath1 , but for @xmath34 we have @xmath35 for high @xmath22 , while for low @xmath22 the ergodicity breaks after the phase transition takes place .",
    "figure  [ fig : p3_me ] shows this property as the restriction on the accessible region in the @xmath36-plane , the non - convexity of the region being closely related to the ergodicity - breaking .",

    "the vertical dashed line shows at which energy @xmath33 the microcanonical phase transition occurs . for @xmath37",
    "the phase transition occurs before the ergodicity breaks , while for @xmath38 the ergodicity breaks before the phase transition . ]",
    "in this section we investigate the thermodynamic properties of the model ( 1 ) introduced in the previous section .",
    "we compare and discuss the phase diagrams for the cases @xmath1 and @xmath2 in the canonical and microcanonical ensembles and show explicitly that in certain intervals of @xmath22 and @xmath31 the specific heat of the ferromagnetic phase is negative in the microcanonical ensemble , which is a clear indication of ensemble inequivalence .",
    "the phase diagram of the model with @xmath1 , as shown in figure  [ fig : p2_pd ] a ) , is qualitatively the same as the phase diagram of the models discussed in @xcite . for small @xmath22",
    "there is a continuous ( second - order ) transition in the canonical ensemble up to the canonical tricritical point , beyond which the transition becomes of first order @xcite . in the microcanonical ensemble the continuous transition coincides , for small @xmath22 , with the canonical one , but persists to a higher value of @xmath22 up to the microcanonical tricritical point .",
    "the first - order transition in the microcanonical ensemble manifests itself as a jump in the temperature and is represented by two lines in the @xmath39 plane , the mc-@xmath40 and mc-@xmath23 lines in figure  [ fig : p2_pd ] a ) .",
    "the reason for this jump is that the entropy has two maxima , one at zero magnetization and one at finite magnetization indicated by the arrows in figure  [ fig : mc_entropies ] b ) .",
    "since the temperature is calculated from the relation @xmath41 ( see ( [ eqn : beta ] ) in [ sec : app_entropy ] ) , and there are two values for @xmath42 , zero and another finite value , there is a temperature jump in the phase diagram due to @xmath43 for @xmath44 .",

    "the region of negative specific heat disappears and for @xmath56 all stable ferromagnetic solutions have positive specific heat .    .",

    "the mixed phase below @xmath94 splits again into two regions , one where the ferromagnetic solution has positive specific heat and another region where the specific heat may take negative values .",
    "also , no conventional maxwell construction is possible for @xmath2 , in contrast to the case of @xmath1 , where it could reconcile the microcanonical and canonical phase diagrams .",
    "the reason for this is that , while for @xmath1 the metastable solutions are joined smoothly by the unstable solutions , for @xmath53 the unstable solution does not touch the paramagnetic metastable solution . for high values of the external field ,",
    "the ergodicity is broken before the phase transition occurs , and the unstable solution does not even exist there . in the limit @xmath75 the canonical phase diagram can be obtained analytically .",

    "some already known features , like ergodicity breaking and negative specific heat , have shown up also in this model .",
    "new features of the system emerge when @xmath2 , such the impossibility of the conventional maxwell construction or the breaking of ergodicity before or after the phase transition occurs , depending on the external control parameter . clearly , these facts demand more detailed studies of the effect of randomness in long - range interacting systems .",

    "<S> we study the effect that randomness has on long - range interacting systems by using the ferromagnetic ising model with @xmath0-body interactions in random fields . </S>",
    "<S> the case with @xmath1 yields a phase diagram similar to that of previously studied models and shows known features that inequivalence of the canonical and microcanonical ensembles brings with it , for example negative specific heat in a narrow region of the phase diagram . when @xmath2 , however , the canonical phase diagram is completely different from the microcanonical one . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature does not necessarily determine the microcanonical phases uniquely , and thus the ferromagnetic and paramagnetic phases are not separated in such a region of a conventional phase diagram drawn with the temperature and field strength as the axes . below a certain value of the external field strength , part of the ferromagnetic phase </S>",
    "<S> has negative specific heat . for large values of the external field strength the ergodicity </S>",
    "<S> is broken before the phase transition occurs for @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , for @xmath2 , the maxwell construction can not be derived in a consistent manner and therefore , in contrast to previous cases with negative specific heat , the maxwell construction does not bridge the gap between the ensembles .    </S>",
