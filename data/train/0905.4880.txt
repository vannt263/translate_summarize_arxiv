    "while the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) @xcite has proven to be a very useful numerical tool for the study of strongly correlated quantum many - body systems in one dimension , applications to higher dimensions have remained very limited so far because an exponential growth of the complexity with system size is recovered in general .",
    "monte carlo simulations , on the other hand , are not limited by the dimensionality of the problem , but perform well only for non - frustrated bosonic systems .",
    "extensions of the dmrg method to two dimensions are therefore highly desired .    in recent years",
    ", insights from quantum information theory have led to an understanding of the success of dmrg in terms of entanglement of the ground state : the renormalization procedure of choosing the dominant eigenvectors of the reduced density matrix picks out states with a large contribution to the entanglement entropy .",
    "it can therefore be regarded as a low - entanglement ansatz for the ground state ; the entanglement that can be encoded is bounded by @xmath0 , where @xmath1 denotes the number of states kept in a renormalization step . since for non - critical systems the amount of entanglement saturates as a function of system size @xcite",
    ", a finite @xmath1 will be able to capture the physics of such systems even in the thermodynamic limit . for weakly entangled systems",
    ", the ansatz will be a very accurate description even for very small @xmath1 .",
    "since the block entanglement does not saturate in the thermodynamic limit for two - dimensional systems , the matrix size needs to grow exponentially with the system size in an approach based on dmrg to obtain a fixed accuracy @xcite .",
    "however , one can hope that the entanglement grows less than the volume of the system ; indeed , it has been shown that for many classes of interesting strongly correlated systems an _ area law _ holds @xcite , i.e. that the entanglement between a given block within a system and the rest of the system will scale with the surface between the two .",
    "therefore , algorithms that obey an area law by construction appear as a viable approach to higher - dimensional systems .",
    "one example for such an algorithm will be the topic of this paper .",

    "we will focus on an ansatz that was first suggested by g. sierra and m. a. martin - delgado under the name of vertex matrix product ansatz @xcite and subsequently applied to evaluate the partition function of a 3d classical model by nishino and okunishi @xcite . a first application to infinite , homogeneous quantum systems is found in @xcite . a formalism for inhomogeneous ,",
    "finite systems was proposed by verstraete and cirac @xcite under the name of _ projected entangled - pair states_. in @xcite , infinite systems were reconsidered from the point of view of extending verstraete and cirac s formalism . for this paper , we choose to refer to the ansatz as pep states .",
    "since it was first proposed , many studies of classical and quantum systems using this family of states have appeared @xcite .",

    "a tensor is associated with each vertex ; the tensor has one index for each edge emanating from it plus one physical index ( a specific choice of basis is implied ) .",
    "specializing to the square lattice in two dimensions , we have rank 5 tensors . in the following",
    ", we will choose the dimensions of all indices between tensors equal to @xmath1 and denote the dimension of the physical hilbert space by @xmath10 .",
    "the bond dimension @xmath1 provides a systematic refinement parameter : while for ground state properties , an @xmath11 peps corresponds to a mean - field state , the class of states is complete in the limit of @xmath12 .",
    "the values of @xmath1 attainable in practical calculations are very limited due to a strong , but polynomial increase of the computation time with @xmath1 .",
    "on the other hand , the fact that for increasing dimension of the lattice , typical ground states of local hamiltonians are closer to mean - field states suggests that the dimension of the bonds in a peps can be chosen smaller than in an mps . nevertheless , this is the most serious limitation to the accuracy of the algorithm .",
    "one of the main purposes of this paper will be to assess the accuracy obtained with peps for the values of @xmath1 attained in practical calculations .    for a wide variety of systems , the peps may provide a very efficient representation of the exponential number of coefficients with a small number of parameters .",
    "however , the aforementioned results on the accuracy of mps for gapped and even critical systems can not be extended to peps .",
    "additionally , it can be shown that the exact calculation of an expectation value based on such a network , i.e. the trace over all indices , is an exponentially hard problem and therefore intractable directly for larger system sizes @xcite . to overcome this limitation ,",
    "approximate contraction schemes have been devised .",
    "we will discuss the _ infinite projected entangled - pair states algorithm _",

    "the treatment of the infinite lattice depends on the observation that the infinite tensor network can be regarded as transfer operator acting on some boundary state and all correlators can be expressed in terms of the dominant eigenvectors of this transfer operator .",
    "this represents a renormalization scheme that replaces expectation values of local operators with expectation values of effective operators that take into account long - range correlations , but can be evaluated locally .",
    "it should be emphasized that we do not handle boundary conditions explicitly . in some cases ,",
    "the boundary state that we use to locally approximate expectation values becomes degenerate , in which case a choice of boundary condition is implied by the choice of boundary state from the manifold of degenerate states . for systems with a broken local symmetry , this degeneracy is related to the degeneracy of states with different symmetry breaking direction .",
    "we however predetermine this direction by the choice of the initial state , which is not symmetric and therefore favours a symmetry sector . in the case of topological order ,",
    "this situation is much more intricate .",
    "for the purpose of this paper , we therefore restrict ourselves to systems where only local symmetries are relevant .",
    "systems with topological order have been treated elsewhere , e.g. @xcite .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : in section [ sect : ipeps ] , we will illustrate the details of the infinite projected entangled - pair algorithm and discuss properties of the ansatz in the vicinity of a first - order phase transition . in section [",
    "sect : nonfrust ] , we apply the algorithm to well - known non - frustrated systems and assess the accuracy of the results in comparison to quantum monte carlo simulations . in section [ sct :",

    ", width=192 ]      several schemes are available for the approximation of the infinite tensor network by a small tensor network in which operators can be evaluated efficiently .",
    "this includes a scheme based on boundary infinite matrix - product states as eigenvectors of diagonals or rows / columns of the lattice ( cf .",
    "[ fig : scheme ] ) @xcite and the corner - transfer matrix scheme originally proposed in the context of tensor - product states by nishino and okunishi @xcite and recently revisited by orus and vidal @xcite .    while the direct comparison of the two methods in @xcite by example of the two - dimensional quantum ising model in transverse field yields slightly better results for the corner - transfer matrix , this is expected to be due to the fact that a very small bond dimension @xmath13 is sufficient to capture the physics of the ising model . in this paper",
    ", we will consider models with more entangled ground states where errors result from insufficient @xmath1 instead of an inaccurate contraction of the environment .",
    "therefore , we do not expect significant improvement from the use of the corner - transfer matrix .",
    "we have checked this for @xmath14 by example of the heisenberg model ( section [ sct : xxxxy ] ) and the dimerized heisenberg model ( section [ sct : dimerized_hb ] ) and found the deviations between the boundary mps method and the ctm to be negligible . in the case of the frustrated model ( section [ sct : frust ] ) , we use a slightly different scheme to update the boundary mps in order to accomodate for the enlarged unit cell .",

    "the trace over all bonds yields the expectation value of @xmath15 .",
    "[ fig : eff_operator],width=302 ]    finding the dominant eigenvectors of the infinite transfer operator can be performed in several ways .",
    "most commonly , the itebd algorithm for non - unitary evolution @xcite is applied .",
    "we find that for lattices with a larger unit cell , better numerical stability can be achieved using an algorithm based on the optimization of fidelity without requiring orthogonalization ; such an approach was suggested in @xcite . for the boundary of the strip ( cf .",
    "[ fig : scheme ] ( b ) ) , it is sufficient to use a single tensor as boundary .    in order to reduce the complexity of operations , transfer matrices are not stored explicitly . instead",
    ", iterative schemes are applied where the matrix - vector product is implemented by exploiting the tensor structure in such a way that only two tensors are contracted at a time , storing the result in a temporary tensor .",
    "this operation can be mapped to a matrix multiplication , for which efficient computer libraries exist .",
    "the optimal order of contractions has to determined depending on the dimension of each bond .",
    "the local environment provides a means of expressing diagonal or off - diagonal operators @xmath15 in an effective form acting on peps tensors , @xmath16 where the @xmath17 are peps tensors that can be regarded as vectors in @xmath18 . the accuracy to which expectation values of effective operators approximate the exact expectation value is controlled by the bond dimension of the boundary matrix - product states , @xmath19 .",
    "the computational cost of increasing @xmath19 is very large , since the itebd algorithm requires the singular - value decomposition of a matrix of dimension @xmath20 , which scales as @xmath21 ; for realistic choices of @xmath19 and @xmath1 , where @xmath22 , this becomes the most time - consuming operation of the algorithm . in the simulations , we choose @xmath19 large enough such that the results do not change with increased @xmath19 ; nevertheless , we should mention that errors made at this step enter both into the calculation of the ground state and the evaluation of expectation values .    in order to project the state into the ground state , imaginary time evolution is performed . for a hamiltonian that can be written as a sum of strictly local terms , @xmath23",
    ", the operator @xmath24 can be expanded straightforwardly by discretizing time @xmath25 and applying a trotter decomposition @xcite , @xmath26 in the case of imaginary time evolution , trotter errors do not accumulate and can largely be eliminated by reducing the time step during the simulation and using higher - order expansions .    applying the evolution gate directly to the peps tensors and transforming back to the previous form increases the bond dimension of the peps .",
    "therefore , time evolution can only be approximated by finding the state @xmath27 that minimizes @xmath28 in order to achieve an optimal approximation , the norm @xmath29 has to be chosen in such a way that the correlations in the system are taken into account .",
    "to this end , the evolution operator @xmath30 can be renormalized to @xmath31 using the scheme discussed above . equation ( [ eqn : opti ] ) can then be written as @xmath32    minimizing this in @xmath33 and @xmath34 leads to a set of coupled linear equations which is solved iteratively by fixing one tensor and optimizing in the other , sweeping back and forth until convergence is reached .    in the following ,",
    "we have used two different unit cells : a staggered ab unit cell , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme ] , which allows for ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic order , and an enlarged four - site unit cell , which allows more general types of order ( cf . also fig .",
    "[ fig : dimerization ] ) .",
    "we start each simulation with a large timestep of the order of @xmath35 , which is decreased to @xmath36 during the simulation .",
    "convergence is checked not only for the energy , but also for all other local observables that are being evaluated .",
    "as initial state for calculations with @xmath14 , we use either a completely random state or a product state , e.g. the nel state , with a small amount of disorder added . for calculations with larger @xmath1 , we start from extrapolations of previous results to save computation time .",
    "the ipeps method is very suitable to first - order phase transitions . in a previous work by ors et al @xcite , a phase transition in the anisotropic quantum orbital compass model",
    "was studied and the transition point located using adiabatic time evolution .",
    "we will take a different approach based on the observation that the dynamics close a first - order phase transition differ fundamentally between simulations on finite lattices and on infinite lattices with translational invariance .",
    "if the system is taken across the phase transition from phase a to phase b , phase a becomes meta - stable .",
    "since phase a can not locally be continuously deformed into phase b ( assuming pure states ) , the dominant process by which the meta - stable state decays is the condensation of finite clusters of phase b ( see , e.g. , binder @xcite ) , thereby breaking translational symmetry .",
    "this process is suppressed by enforcing translational symmetry .",
    "the imaginary time evolution we simulate therefore has a strongly suppressed probability of tunneling from one phase to the other in the phase coexistence regime where the energy densities of phase a and b are similar .",
    "we can therefore expect to find only homogeneous systems of one phase in the vicinity of the transition . by preparing a state deep within one phase and using this state as initial state for the imaginary time evolution of the hamiltonian with different parameters",
    ", we can find the energy density of each phase for a relatively wide space of parameters .",
    "the transition point can then be located to high accuracy as the crossing point of the ground - state energy densities of the two phases ; simultaneously , the existence of this stability allows us to clearly distinguish the nature of the phase transition .",
    "we study several non - frustrated spin-@xmath37 models on the square lattice , where results can easily be compared to previous results and quantum monte carlo calculations , which we perform using the alps package @xcite . as a first test case and complementary to previous results @xcite , we study a first - order phase transition in the xxz model in external field , which maps to the bose - hubbard model in the hard - core limit .",
