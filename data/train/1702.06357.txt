    "despite the fact that general relativity ( gr ) is a well understood theoretical framework with some strong empirical supports , it breaks down at very small length scales and a quantum theory of gravity is required .",
    "in fact , to achieve a coherent picture of the universe from its beginning until today , we need a unified framework of general relativity and quantum filed theory .",
    "current speculative approaches to quantum gravity such as string theory , loop quantum gravity , deformed spacial relativity and also quantum physics of black holes , phenomenologically steer one toward replacing the concept of point in spacetime geometry with an _ `` invariant minimal length''_. this feature can be encoded at the high energy regime by generalizing the standard heisenberg uncertainty principle to the so called _ `` gravitational ( generalized ) uncertainty principle '' ( gup ) _",
    "@xcite .    even though quantum gravity is still under development , all proposed approaches so far such as loop quantum gravity @xcite , string theory @xcite , doubly special relativity @xcite and noncommutative geometry @xcite require existence of an invariant minimum length on the order of the planck length , @xmath0 .",
    "astonishingly , in the light of taking such a fundamental length in physics of black holes , some issues such as the _ information loss paradox _ , have been alleviated in recent years @xcite . from an experimental standpoint , the fundamental length may be accessible by test particles of short wavelength ( high energy)@xcite .",
    "however , in this regime , the spacetime structure significantly is affected by the quantum gravitational effects of the test particles . technically speaking , beyond the planck scale due to quantum fluctuations of the background metric",
    ", topology of spacetime changes in essence and spacetime manifold turns to be discrete . if one incorporate the gravitational effects in quantum phenomena ( remember the heisenberg electron microscope thought experiment ) , then the standard uncertainty principle changes to the generalized uncertainty principle ( gup)@xcite ( see also @xcite ) . from an algebraic viewpoint , the generalization of the standard heisenberg commutators between position and momentum in hilbert space guarantees appearance of an invariant minimum length .",
    "we note that in the framework of polymer quantization a similar commutator relations can be obtained as well ( see for instance @xcite-@xcite and references therein ) . briefly speaking , in the context of gup by concerning on the minimum length solely",
    ", we are dealing with two types of representations .",
    "as the first type , one can follow works such as @xcite-@xcite where a particular representation of the operators in the modified heisenberg commutator , @xmath1=i\\big(1+\\beta\\frac{\\hat{p}^2}{m_{pl}^2}\\big)$ ] has been considered .",
    "we note that the phenomenological outcomes risen from this version ( specifically , upper bounds extracted for the modified dimensionless parameter @xmath2 which is expected to be of the order of unity ) are not so interesting theoretically since they are _",
    "representation dependent_. in other words , within the mentioned approach , there are many possible representations for operators @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the second type has been suggested through the deformation of the classical newtonian mechanics .",
    "more technically , it has been introduced via modifying the standard poisson brackets as @xmath5 so that in a sense it looks like the quantum commutator , @xmath6= i(1+\\beta_0\\hat{p}^2)$ ] where @xmath7 ( see for instance @xcite-@xcite ) . a serious criticism about this version is that it seems rational that gr to be deformed at order of @xmath2 and not newtonian formalism @xcite . in other words",
    ", this version of the deformed heisenberg algebra in the limit @xmath8 reproduces the newtonian classical mechanics and not gr . therefore some commutators containing corrections relevant to gr also must be proposed additionally . in ref .",
    "@xcite a new version of gup with minimal length has been realized in which rather than focusing on given representations of canonical operators @xmath3 and @xmath4 or modifications of the classical newtonian mechanics , one starts from a pure quantum effect known as the _  hawking evaporation\"_. interestingly , in the mentioned reference @xcite , the authors were able to explicitly link the minimal length modification of the schwarzschild geometry to the uncertainty relation independent to any given representation of commutators .",
    "also in this new version , without recourse to the poisson brackets and newtonian mechanics , the standard gr automatically retrieves in the limit @xmath8 .",
    "a prominent feature of the new approach is that the equation of motion of test particle yet obeys the standard geodesics equation .",
    "+ with these preliminaries , in this paper we study some phenomenological aspects arising from incorporation of a minimal measurable length into schwarzschild geometry according to the metric introduced in @xcite .",
    "the interesting feature of this metric is that it is equipped with a minimal measurable length whilst it still respects the equivalence principle . for this purpose",
    ", we have devoted sections ii to v to four noteworthy astrophysical phenomenons respectively as : 1 ) the stability status of circular orbits of a black hole accretion disk , 2 ) the redshift of the black hole accretion disk , 3 ) gravitational tidal forces and 4 ) the geodetic drift rate .",
    "then the paper follows by summary and conclusion .",
    "we use the signature @xmath9 through this paper .",
    "in this section we derive an energy condition ( and subsequently a shape equation ) in schwarzschild geometry equipped with a minimal measurable length @xcite",
    ". then we study the effect of minimal measurable length on the stability of circular trajectories of massive gas particles in black hole accretion disk . for this purpose",
    ", we firstly extract the effect of the minimal length correction terms for the geodesics in the gup - deformed schwarzschild geometry . by avoiding details ( as have been reported in @xcite ) , a deformed schwarzschild metric with a minimal measurable length is as follows    @xmath10    with this deformed line element , the gup - deformed hawking temperature can be recovered interestingly .",
    "the third term in @xmath11 can be considered as a perturbation term due to incorporation of a natural cutoff as a minimal measurable length .",
    "note that @xmath12 is of the order of unity , that is , @xmath13 with possibly negative sign . in this paper",
    "we consider only the leading order modification in the dimensionless parameter @xmath12 .",
    "even for the case that @xmath12 is very close to unity , since @xmath14 is usually small ( for instance , it is @xmath15 at the surface of sun ) , our approximation is justified .",
    "the deformed lagrangian relevant to line element ( [ e2 - 1 ] ) is given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 with @xmath18 and @xmath19 is a parameter along the geodesics .",
    "after substituting the above modified lagrangian into the euler - lagrange equations , @xmath20 we arrive at the following geodesic equations for schwarzschild spacetime deformed by a minimal length @xmath21 here the quantities @xmath22 and @xmath23 are constants that their physical meaning will be uncovered . without loss of generality , we restrict our attention to particles moving in the equatorial plane , @xmath24 . replacing the second geodesic equation by a first integral of the non - null geodesics with @xmath25 , we infer that the worldline @xmath26 ( where @xmath27 is the proper time along the geodesics ) of a massive particle must satisfy the following equations @xmath28 in these equations a dot marks derivative with respect to the proper time @xmath29 . substituting the first and third equations of ( [ e2 - 4 * ] ) into the second one",

    "we note that the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ e2 - 5 ] ) can be interpreted as a constant of the motion so that in general case it must be @xmath32 ( here @xmath33 and @xmath34 are respectively the total and rest energies of the particle in its orbit ) . in order to determine @xmath35 which represents the shape of the orbit of rotating particles",
    ", we need another equation known as the _ `` shape equation''_. since @xmath36 in the above deformed energy equation can be written as @xmath37 by a change of variable as @xmath38 , we find @xmath39 this is our _ `` minimal length deformed shape equation''_. setting conditions @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) into eq .",
    "( [ e2 - 7 ] ) , we obtain the following relation for the quantity @xmath23 @xmath42 also eqs .",
    "( [ e2 - 8 ] ) and ( [ e2 - 5 ] ) jointly give the relation @xmath43 for the constant @xmath22 .",
    "to determine whether the circular orbits are bounded in this setup , we can use the relation @xmath32 which requires @xmath44 .",
    "therefore , the limits on @xmath45 for the orbit to be bounded are given by @xmath46 , which is satisfied if @xmath47 the net result of analysis done so far suggests that the closest bound circular orbit around a black hole deformed by a natural cutoff as a minimum measurable length , can be formed at interval @xmath48 which as compared with the prediction of gr , deviates with the value of @xmath49 . substituting the expression of ( [ e2 - 8 ] ) for @xmath50 into the third geodesic equation in ( [ e2 - 4 * ] ) , we find @xmath51 one can easily demonstrate that here @xmath52 satisfies the geodesic equation ( @xmath53 ) while in its gr counterpart this is not the case . in other words , unlike gr , based on the gup deformed line element ( [ e2 - 1 ] ) , for a free massive particle there is the possibility of having a circular orbit at @xmath52 .",
    "+ in which follows , we treat the stability of circular orbits in this minimal length deformed framework . using the deformed energy equation ( [ e2 - 5 ] ) ,",
    "the effective potential per unit mass can be identified as @xmath54 which has an additional term proportional to @xmath55 as compared with the gr one . the additional term which depends on the sign of @xmath12",
    "can be thought as a repulsive / attractive term .",

    "let us start our analysis from solution ( [ e2 - 14 ] ) .",
    "physically , it means that there is only one extremum or turning point in the orbit for the relevant range of @xmath62 .",
    "the solution is acceptable i.e. @xmath63 only if @xmath64 and @xmath65 . depending on the fixed values for @xmath12 and @xmath62 , we will deal with different @xmath66 limited to interval @xmath67 .",
    "of course , some of @xmath66 s are excluded due to the violation of constraint ( [ e2 - 10 ] ) .",
    "so only the values belonging to the interval @xmath68 are allowed . putting ( [ e2 - 14 ] ) into the second derivative of the gup - deformed effective potential @xmath69 we find that under all allowed values of @xmath66 , one has @xmath70 .",
    "therefore , it can be said that the solution ( [ e2 - 14 ] ) addresses _ exactly stable orbits _ because the local minimums in the potential are the locations of stable circular orbits . at first look",
    ", it seems that ( [ e2 - 15 ] ) supports existence of three turning points .",
    "however , with a direct analysis one can realize that this is not actually the case since the second and third equations in ( [ e2 - 15 ] ) do not obey the condition @xmath71 and therefore are unacceptable .",
    "therefore , here we face also with just one turning point as the former case . the first solution in ( [ e2 - 15 ] ) can be favorable if @xmath72 ( except for @xmath73 ) so that @xmath74",
    ". as before , the solution also results in local minimums in the gup - deformed effective potential , @xmath75 . as a result , among four possible turning points only the couple @xmath76 and @xmath77 have physical meaning so that both amazingly result in exactly stable circular orbits .",
    "we can conceive ourselves with solutions @xmath76 and @xmath77 as innermost and outermost orbits respectively relevant to massive accretion disk around schwarzschild black hole described by deformed metric ( [ e2 - 1 ] ) . despite a feint similarity with gr one ,",
    "the above results released in the presence of a minimal length are different from what we have expected from gr - based effective potential . here",
    "we face with a spectrum of innermost orbits which the smallest orbit may be formed in @xmath78 while in gr for a given value of @xmath79 we have an innermost circular orbit in definite value @xmath80 . on the other hand ,",
    "the stability status of the innermost circular orbit in gr is _ _ marginally _ _ at a radius @xmath81 , the conditions @xmath82 should be fulfilled . in this case",
    "three behaviors are possible : a )  @xmath83 : massive particles are on a stable circular orbit and are constrained to remain exactly at that value of @xmath84 .",
    "b )  @xmath85 : the particles straddles the boundary between two regions with @xmath86 ; if the orbit is perturbed in one direction it falls into the hole , while if it is perturbed in the opposite direction it moves outward and then turns back inward .",
    "in this case , the particles are on an unstable circular orbit .",
    "c )  @xmath87 : this is an intermediate case between the last two cases : a marginally stable circular orbit .",
    "_ ] @xcite , while here this orbit is exactly stable . in the context of gr , stability of circular motion of massive particles on the innermost radius @xmath80 is not lasting in response to a typical perturbation",
    "; rather it will collapse into the black hole .",
    "however , as we have seen , by considering a fundamental minimal length scale in the outer geometry of a schwarzschild black hole , the stability status of the innermost circular orbit improves towards an exactly stable orbit .",
    "as another important issue from a phenomenological viewpoint , here we study redshift of the photon gas accreting on a none - rotational black hole which its outside geometry is determined by a minimal length deformed schwarzschild metric as ( [ e2 - 1 ] ) . to avoid unnecessary complications , we take the disc to be oriented edge - on to the observer so that all orbits are located in the plane of the observer and the disc ( again we set @xmath24 in our calculations ) . for the ratio of the photon s frequencies at the reception and emission points",
    "we find @xmath88 where @xmath89 and @xmath90 denote the photon four - momenta at emission and reception points , respectively .",
    "also @xmath91 and @xmath92 are the four - velocity of the particles at emission and reception , respectively .",
    "the components of @xmath92 in the @xmath93 coordinates system with the assumption that the observer is fix at infinity can be written as @xmath94 . besides , based on the assumption that the particles are moving in a circular orbit one has @xmath95 so that    @xmath96    now we can specify @xmath97 by using the fact that @xmath98 for time - like geodesics . under the condition that the emitting particles are at a coordinate radius @xmath45",
    ", we then have @xmath99^{-\\frac{1}{2}}~.\\ ] ] therefore we can rewrite the general expression for ( [ e3 - 1 ] ) as @xmath100 the plus sign in this equation corresponds to the emitting photons on the side of the disc moving towards the observer , while the minus sign corresponds to the photons on the other side . to fix the ratio @xmath101",
    "we can apply the null geodesic relation @xmath102 for the photon s worldline as @xmath103 a special and simple case happens when the photon is emitted from matter moving transversely to the observer i.e. @xmath104 or @xmath105 which results in @xmath106 .",
    "we note that in this case the disc is viewed face - on .",
    "accordingly , the observed frequency ratio in the presence of a fundamental minimal length is given by @xmath107 where @xmath108 is a dimensionless parameter .",
    "it is easily verifiable that in the absence of the minimal length modification ( i.e. for @xmath31 ) , equation ( [ e3 - 6 ] ) recovers its gr counterpart as @xmath109 the other special case occurs when the matter is moving either directly towards or away from the observer i.e. @xmath110 ( here the disc is viewed edge - on ) . in this case after a little calculation , one obtains the following relation @xmath111 for the photon frequency shift in the context of gup .",
    "once again , by discarding the minimal length effects in our calculations , eq .",
    "( [ e3 - 7 ] ) recovers the same expression that we expect from gr @xmath112    c    in fig . 1",
    ", we have depicted the qualitative behavior of eqs .",
    "( [ e3 - 6 ] ) and ( [ e3 - 7 ] ) to see the impact of the minimal length deformation on gr prediction .",
    "in contrast to the standard accretion disk formalism , here there is a possibility of radiation for regions smaller than @xmath113 .",
    "the plots depicted in fig . 1 implicitly display the fact that the smallest frequency shifts in the presence of a minimal measurable length are below the gr prediction .",
    "this point is reliable since in the standard gr when one computes the radiation of a standard accretion disk by taking rotation of the black hole ( kerr metric ) into account , the smallest frequency shifts then could be lower than the case without rotation @xcite .",
    "in the same streamline as previous sections , now we are going to study gravitational tidal forces near a gup - deformed schwarzschild black hole described by the deformed line element ( [ e2 - 1 ] ) .",
    "a set of orthonormal basis vectors defining an instantaneous inertial rest frame for one of the particles can be considered as @xmath114 where @xmath115 runs from @xmath116 to @xmath117 correspond to @xmath93 .",
    "the general expression for calculation of the tidal forces is written as @xmath118 here @xmath119 denotes the riemann tensor in the schwarzschild coordinates with the following general expression @xmath120 where @xmath121 to receive our goal in this section , we need to know the minimal length deformed expressions of the riemann tensor .",
    "the non - zero elements of the metric components @xmath122 from the gup - deformed line element ( [ e2 - 1 ] ) are given by @xmath123 then , the non - zero connection coefficients are calculated as @xmath124 now we can split eq .

    "first of all , we see that in the limit @xmath31 , the above expressions recover their gr counterparts . at",
    "once , one finds that radial dependence of the gup deformation term in each three components is the same and as @xmath55 , while the gr term is as @xmath127 . when the gup - deformed gravitational tidal force becomes dominant ,",
    "we are faced with more different possibilities in comparison with standard gr .",
    "if we take the positive sign for @xmath12 ( @xmath128 ) , the gup - deformation term then resists against tension or stretching generated by gr term in the radial direction @xmath129 as far as @xmath130 where transition from tension to compression happens .",
    "also gup - deformation term creates a repulsion against pressure or compression arising from gr term in the transverse directions ( @xmath131 and @xmath132 ) as far as @xmath133 where compression converts into tension . on the other hand , deformed line element ( [ e2 - 1 ] )",
    "discloses this point that in the presence of a minimal length , the schwarzschild radius can not be fixed at the value @xmath134 rather , depending on @xmath128 , it is located in the range @xmath135 . as a result , a freely falling particle passing the smallest schwarzschild radius and entering the region @xmath136 , gets squeezed in all directions .",
    "however , as it arrives at the region @xmath137 , despite contraction in the radial direction continues , the particle expands in the transverse directions .",
    "we note that for possible negative sign of @xmath12 , the effect of tension and compression enhance in the radial and transverse directions , respectively .",
    "unlike the former possibility , in this case as gr , no transition takes place .",
    "inspired by the fact that the motion of spin vector of a test body ( we mean a very small object with spin such as a small gyroscope ) can be employed to probe geometry of a curved spacetime , here we demand this issue for the gup - deformed schwarzschild geometry ( [ e2 - 1 ] ) to study geodetic drift rate .",
    "due to the motion of a test body along a timelike geodesic , four - velocity @xmath138 is parallel - transported along its worldline . therefore , in some coordinate system , the components of @xmath138 satisfy the following equation @xmath139 assuming that the spin of the test body is characterized by the @xmath140 along the geodesic , one can require the following orthogonality condition @xmath141 at all points along the geodesic .",
    "this condition is imposed from the fact that the spin vector has no timelike component in the instantaneous rest frame of the test body .",
    "parallel transport of @xmath138 along its geodesic dictates @xmath142 now by supposing that the test body is in a circular orbit of coordinate radius @xmath45 in the equatorial plane @xmath143 ) of the schwarzschild geometry deformed by a minimal length , eq .",
    "( [ e5 - 3 ] ) then reduces to @xmath144 the four - velocity of the test body can be written as @xmath145 ( see section 2 ) .",
    "therefore , from eq .",
    "( [ e5 - 2 ] ) one can extract the following result @xmath146 using this relation along with connection coefficients listed in ( [ e4 - 6 ] ) , one can rewrite eq.([e5 - 4 ] ) as @xmath147 it is straightforward to prove that in the absence of @xmath12 , the above four independent equations reduce to three equations since the first and fourth ones are actually the same in this case . at this point one",
    "usually converts the @xmath29-derivatives in the above equations to @xmath148-derivatives which will be done through the relation @xmath149 .",
    "therefore , except for the second equation , the rest become as @xmath150 respectively . with these relations , the second equation in ( [ e5 - 6 ] )",
    "can be rewritten as the following two forms @xmath151 in terms of @xmath148-derivative respectively . finally , with assumption",
    "that the initial spatial direction @xmath152 of the spin vector to be radial ( i.e. @xmath153 ) , the corresponding solutions to the system of equations ( [ e5 - 6 * ] ) and ( [ e5 - 7 ] ) then are obtained as @xmath154 and @xmath155 respectively .",
    "once again we stress that by suppressing the effect of the minimal length , the first and the third cases in eq .",
    "( [ e5 - 8 ] ) are the same so that two equations in ( [ e5 - 9 ] ) reduce to one equation , as we expect from gr .",
    "the solution ( [ e5 - 8 ] ) reveals clearly that the angular parts of the spin vector rotate relative to the radial direction with two distinct angular speeds @xmath156 in the negative @xmath157-direction . on the other hand ,",
    "the radial direction itself rotates with the same angular speeds , this time in the positive @xmath157-direction .",
    "the difference between these two angular speeds leads to a phenomena known as _  geodesic precession effect \" _ or _",
    " geodetic drift rate\"_. this phenomena is detectable via angle , the final direction of spin vector does not return to the starting state , rather there would be a small shift i.e. @xmath158 .",

    "we stress that @xmath162 addresses the geodesic precession effect only for the positive values of @xmath12 , exclusively in the region @xmath163 which is forbidden from gr perspective .",
    "however , it can not be valid physically because it diverges ( see fig . 2 ( left panel ) ) .",
    "c    nevertheless , qualitative behavior of @xmath164 in fig .",
    "2 ( right panel ) is noteworthy because in the same allowable range in gr ( that is , @xmath165 ) it shows the effect of gup - deformation on the geodetic drift rate .",
    "in other words , for @xmath128 , @xmath164 shifts towards below the gr result while for @xmath166 it shifts up to the gr result .",
    "although this effect is very tiny , it may be detectable experimentally by measuring the spacelike spin vector of a gyroscope in an orbiting spacecraft .",
    "one of the main goals of the _ gravity probe b _ project as a space - based experiment , was test of the geodetic drift rate predicted by gr @xcite . after analyzing all data , the value has reported is nearly @xmath167 arc - second / yr ( or @xmath168 rad / yr ) which has a negligible difference with the prediction of gr , i.e .",
    "nearly @xmath169 arc - second / yr ( or @xmath170 rad / yr ) .",
    "we remind that within the context of gr , this deviation can be explained by the fact that the actual geometry outside of rotating earth is kerr geometry not the static schwarzschild one . for a more detailed discussion we provide a numerical analysis on the dependency of @xmath164 to @xmath12",
    "( see table i ) .",
    "the content of table i explicitly reflects the fact that incorporating a fundamental minimal length scale into the schwarzschild geometry with the relevant positive dimensionless parameter constrained as @xmath171 , leads to improving the prediction of gr for a better compliance with experiment . as is shown in table i , by fixing @xmath172 we arrive at @xmath173 arc - second /",
    "yr which is closer to released value from _ gravity probe b _ in comparison with _",

    "it is worth to note that a similar situation has occurred in section 3 about the issue of _ `` the smallest frequency shifts''_. in the light of the results obtained in this paper , we are able to justify at least a part of the small deviation between the gr and experimental results by incorporation of the quantum gravity effect via a minimal measurable length into the schwarzschild geometry without considering the small effect of the earth rotation .",
    "the attractive point of this analysis is that a simple deformation of the schwarzschild metric as ( [ e2 - 1 ] ) has the potential to derive more or less the same phenomenological adjustment arising from a complicated metric such as the kerr metric .",

    "the summary and main results are as follows :    * as the first issue , by considering a minimal length in our calculation , we derived the deformed energy equation for the @xmath45-coordinate along with relevant shape equation to explore stability of circular trajectories of massive particles ( particularly , accretion disk around a schwarzschild black hole which is deformed by a minimal length ) .",
    "we firstly found that by fixing the deformation parameter into interval @xmath175 ( except for @xmath73 ) , unlike our expectation from gr , the closest bound circular orbit may be formed at range @xmath176 .",
    "as a direct consequence of incorporating the minimal length into schwarzschild geometry , we showed that a free massive particle is able to keep its circular orbit at @xmath52 , which is impossible in gr .",
    "then by regarding the minimal length into the effective potential as well as applying some explicit constraints on dimensionless angular parameter @xmath62 and @xmath12 , we extracted two physical solutions among four possible ones which can be thought as innermost and outermost circular orbits in this setup . however , these two solutions have a different status than what are derived from gr - based effective potential .",
    "one will find that here depending on @xmath12 and @xmath62 , there is a spectrum of innermost orbits which the smallest orbit is formed at @xmath177 .",
    "this is the case in the situation that in the context of gr for a given value of @xmath178 we have only one innermost circular orbit at @xmath80 .",
    "more importantly , while the stability status of the innermost circular orbit in gr is marginally , here we obviously showed that it is exactly stable .",
    "namely , according to gr despite the stable circular motion of massive particles on the innermost radius @xmath179 , it is not durable against a typical perturbation so that it falls down into the black hole .",
    "_ in conclusion , our analysis reveals that embedding a fundamental minimal length into the outer geometry of the schwarzschild black hole improves the stability status of innermost circular orbit towards exactly stable one .",
    "_ * as the second issue , we have calculated in some straightforward cases the redshift of the photon gas accretion around a gup - deformed schwarzschild black hole . in more details , we have derived the frequency shift for two special cases : 1 ) when the photon is emitted from matter moving transverse to the observer ( @xmath104 or @xmath105 ) .",
    "2 ) when the matter is moving either directly towards or away from the observer ( @xmath110 ) .",
    "we note that in contrast to the standard accretion into black hole , for regions smaller than @xmath113 there is a possibility of radiation so that the smallest frequency shifts are below the gr prediction .",
    "it seems defendable in the sense that by considering the rotation of black hole ( kerr metric ) in calculations of the standard accretion disk , the photon frequency shift obtained from schwarzschild black hole reduces by a small amount .",
    "* as the third issue , we have studied the gravitational tidal forces around a gup - deformed schwarzschild black hole . unlike the gr case",
    ", here depending on the sign of @xmath12 , we are dealing with some new physics . in the case",
    "@xmath128 , gup - deformation term resists against tension or stretching produced via gr term in the radial direction @xmath129 as far as @xmath130 where a transition from tension to compression situates .",
    "also gup - deformation term creates a repulsion against pressure or compression arising from gr term in the transverse directions ( @xmath131 and @xmath132 ) as far as @xmath133 where compression changes to tension .",
    "it is clear from the deformed line element ( [ e2 - 1 ] ) that in the presence of a minimal length , the schwarzschild radius depending on the @xmath128 is located in the range @xmath135 .",
    "therefore , a freely falling particle passing the smallest of the schwarzschild radius and entering the region @xmath136 , gets squeezed in all directions .",
    "as soon as its arrival to the region @xmath137 , despite continuing the contraction in the radial direction , the particle expands in the transverse directions . in case of choosing the negative sign for the @xmath12 , the effect of tension and compression enhances in the radial and transverse directions , respectively . in this case as gr , there is no transition .",
    "* as the forth issue , we proposed the geodetic drift rate within the context of the gup - deformed schwarzschild geometry .",
    "interestingly , our analysis reveals that in the case of choosing the positive values for the deformation parameter @xmath128 , gr prediction gets improved . in other words , deformation term in the line element ( [ e2 - 1 ] ) can lead to fill at least a part of the typical gap reported between gr prediction and data analysis released in gravity probe b experiment .",
    "as table i shows , by setting @xmath172 one finds @xmath173 arc - second / yr in our setup which is much closer to the released value by _ gravity probe b _",
    "( @xmath180 arc - second / yr ) in comparison with _",
    "metric _ result , @xmath181 arc - second / yr ."
