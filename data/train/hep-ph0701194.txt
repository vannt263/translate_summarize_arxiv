    "some years ago , it was suggested that the 511 kev radiation observed from the galactic bulge by the spi / integral satellite @xcite may be the product of dark matter annihilations @xcite . for dark matter particles to generate the observed spectral line width of this signal , their annihilations must inject positrons with energies below a few mev @xcite and , therefore , such particles must be much lighter than the range of masses typically associated with dark matter .",
    "it has long been understood that weakly interacting particles with masses smaller than a few gev ( but larger than @xmath01 mev ) are expected to be overproduced in the early universe relative to the measured dark matter abundance @xcite .",
    "this conclusion can be modified , however , if new light mediators are introduced which make dark matter annihilations more efficient @xcite .",
    "for example , neutralinos within the mssm are required by this argument to be heavier than @xmath020 gev @xcite . within extended supersymmetric models with light higgs bosons mediating neutralino annihilation , however , much smaller masses are possible  @xcite .    for dark matter particles with 0.5 - 3 mev masses to generate the measured dark matter abundance , they must annihilate during the freeze - out epoch with a cross section of @xmath1 pb .",
    "to inject the flux of positrons needed to generate the signal observed by spi / integral , however , an annihilation cross section of @xmath2 pb is required .",
    "together , these requirements lead us to consider dark matter particles with s - wave suppressed annihilations ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "such behavior can be found , for example , in the case of fermionic or scalar dark matter particles annihilating through a vector mediator .",
    "for such a dark matter particle to annihilate sufficiently in the early universe to not be overabundant today , the mediating boson would also have to be quite light  @xcite .",
    "the existence of a new gauge boson which couples to dark matter and ( at least some of the ) standard model fermions would have a number of potentially observable consequences .",
    "constraints on such a scenario have been placed by collider experiments @xcite , neutrino experiments @xcite , atomic physics experiments @xcite and by observations of core - collapse supernovae @xcite .    in this letter , we present a new way in which a gauge boson associated with mev - scale dark matter may be detected . in particular , neutrinos produced in cosmic ray accelerators could interact with cosmic background neutrinos via the resonant exchange of the new gauge boson , resulting in an absorption line in the high - energy cosmic neutrino spectrum .",
    "this resembles , in some respects , the scattering of ultra - high energy neutrinos through resonant @xmath4-exchange , known as @xmath4-burst mechanism  @xcite .",
    "similar ideas have also been explored for very light gauge bosons associated with the generation of neutrino masses @xcite .",
    "we find that if the new gauge boson s coupling to neutrinos is larger than approximately @xmath5 , then this process will efficiently deplete the neutrino flux over a range of energies , @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the redshift of the neutrino source and @xmath8 is the mass of the gauge boson . although challenging , such a feature could potentially be observed by future high - energy neutrino telescopes .",
    "if a new gauge boson exists which couples to neutrinos , then propagating neutrinos will scatter with the cosmic neutrino background at a resonant energy of @xmath9 , where @xmath8 is the mass of the new gauge boson . for a gauge boson with an mev - scale mass , and considering @xmath00.1 ev neutrinos",
    ", this corresponds to a resonance at @xmath101 - 10 tev .",
    "although the couplings of a light gauge boson to neutrinos are quite tightly constrained by @xmath11 scattering experiments  @xcite , over very long baselines , high - energy neutrinos may interact efficiently with cosmic background neutrinos via the exchange of the new boson , even if the relevant couplings are very small .",
    "these resonant interactions will be elastic in nature ( @xmath12 ) or , if @xmath13 , produce electron - positron pairs ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "we first focus on the case in which @xmath15 .",
    "@xmath12 processes will deplete the number of neutrinos in the resonance range , leading to an absorption line and a slight  pile up \" feature in the cosmic neutrino spectrum . near resonance , the neutrino - antineutrino cross section is well approximated by @xmath16},\\ ] ] where @xmath17 is the @xmath18 s coupling to neutrinos .",
    "the decay width of the gauge boson is given by : @xmath19 where the sum is over the three neutrino species .",
    "at the resonant energy , this leads to a cross section of @xmath20 and a corresponding mean free path for a neutrino of @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the number density of cosmic background neutrinos ( per flavor ) .",
    "although this mean free path is very short by the standards of neutrino astronomy , the width of the corresponding resonance is also very narrow . for a 1 mev gauge boson and a 0.1 ev neutrino mass , a neutrino will scatter on resonance only within a small range of energies : @xmath23 .",
    "the neutrino s energy moves relative to the resonance as a result of redshift energy losses , however , effectively broadening the resonance considerably @xcite .",
    "the depth of such a resonance will be sufficient to deplete the neutrino flux over an energy range @xmath24 if the distance propagated while on resonance is larger than the mean free path : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the rate of hubble expansion .",
    "this condition is satisfied if the @xmath27 coupling is larger than : @xmath28 where @xmath7 is the redshift at which the neutrino possesses the energy needed to scatter at resonance .    even if the gauge boson is heavy enough to decay to @xmath29 , the result of eq .",
    "[ condition ] is expected to remain largely unchanged .",
    "although the resonant cross section would be modified by a factor of @xmath30 by allowing such decays , the change in the width of the resonance will counteract this effect .",
    "considering the @xmath13 case , therefore , makes the condition of eq .",
    "[ condition ] only slightly less restrictive .    in figs .",
    "[ g ] and [ z ] , these results are illustrated . for a gauge boson with a @xmath311 mev mass and couplings to neutrinos of order @xmath0@xmath32",
    ", high - redshift sources will have their neutrino flux considerably suppressed within the range @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the resonant energy .",
    "in the basic scenario we are considering here , there are a number of potentially free parameters , including the gauge boson s couplings to various fermions , the gauge boson s coupling to dark matter , and the masses of the gauge boson and dark matter particle .",
    "these quantities can be constrained by a number of considerations .",
    "firstly , the product of the gauge boson s couplings to neutrinos and electrons is constrained by @xmath11 scattering experiments , such that @xmath35 @xcite . to satisfy this constraint and at the same time",
    "generate the observed abundance of dark matter , some care must be taken .",
    "the most simple solution would be to set the @xmath18 s couplings to all left - handed fermions ( including neutrinos ) to zero . in this case",
    ", there will be no observable consequences in @xmath11 experiments , or for neutrino astronomy .",
    "on the other hand , if the @xmath18 s couplings to left and right - handed fermions are similar in magnitude ( or the right - handed couplings are sub - dominant or zero ) we find that these couplings can be as large as @xmath36 . if we consider the case of @xmath37 , we can simultaneously satisfy @xmath11 scattering and generate a significant degree of neutrino absorption ( _ ie .",
    "_ satisfy the condition of eq .",
    "[ condition ] ) for high - redshift sources ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "if the coupling @xmath17 is somewhat larger than the corresponding coupling to electrons , less distant sources could also possess this feature .",
    "detecting an absorption feature in the high - energy cosmic neutrino spectrum will be challenging for a number of reasons .",
    "most importantly , a very large number of neutrinos would need to be detected before the spectrum could be adequately reconstructed . in the tev energy region ,",
    "in which we have focused on in this letter , next generation kilometer - scale neutrino telescopes , such as icecube , will detect @xmath010 muon events per energy decade ( from charged - current muon neutrino interactions ) per year if an optimistic neutrino flux is assumed ( saturating the waxman - bahcall bound @xcite , for example ) @xcite . of these ,",
    "only those events which can be identified ( by timing and directional considerations ) to have originated from high - redshift sources will be of use in detecting an absorption feature .",
    "furthermore , each muon track reveals , at most , the energy of the muon produced , and not the total energy of the responsible neutrino . to measure the cosmic neutrino spectrum with sufficient resolution to detect an absorption feature would require a detector capable of measuring the energy of both the muon track and the accompanying hadronic shower .",
    "alternatively , charged - current electron or tau neutrino interactions could be used , which produce showers containing all of the neutrino s energy .",
    "such events could , however , be confused with showers produced through neutral current interactions .    assuming good neutrino energy resolution ( using well reconstructed , contained events )",
    ", it may be possible to reliably detect ( or exclude ) the presence of an absorption line .",
    "even with a low threshold , kilometer - scale experiment and an optimistic neutrino flux , such a determination would likely require many years of exposure , however . to convincingly resolve such",
    "a feature would require an experimental program with a greater effective volume and energy resolution than current or planned experiments .    in fig .",
    "[ bins ] , we illustrate what would be required of a future high - energy neutrino telescope to observe an absorption feature by plotting the number of events averaged in @xmath39 energy bins at energies around an absorption feature . here , we have used @xmath40 mev , @xmath41 and have considered sources at a redshift of @xmath42 .",
    "we have used an optimistic high - redshift cosmic neutrino flux of @xmath43 gev @xmath44 s@xmath45 and an experiment with a cubic kilometer instrumented volume , and ten years of observation time .",
    "in this letter , we have pointed out that the existence of a new mev - scale gauge boson coupled to neutrinos would lead to absorption features in the high - energy cosmic neutrino spectrum .",
    "the very narrow resonance at a center - of - mass energy equal to the gauge boson s mass will deplete the neutrino flux over an energy range given by @xmath33 , where @xmath34 and @xmath7 is the redshift of the source .",
    "the depletion of the flux in this range will be efficient if the gauge boson s coupling to neutrinos is larger than approximately @xmath5",
    ".    the possible existence of a light gauge boson has previously been motivated by the observation of 511 kev photons from the galactic bulge , which could be generated by mev - scale dark matter annihilating through the exchange of the new gauge boson .",
    "if such scenario is indeed found in nature , high - energy neutrino astronomy may be able to offer complementary insights into the nature of dark matter .",
