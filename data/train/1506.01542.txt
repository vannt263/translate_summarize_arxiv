    "magnetoresistance , the property of a material that its electrical resistivity changes when exposed to an external magnetic field , was first discovered by lord kelvin@xcite .",
    "more recent discoveries are the giant magnetoresistance ( gmr)@xcite , the colossal magnetoresistance ( cmr)@xcite , the tunnel magnetoresistance ( tmr)@xcite , the extraordinary magnetoresistance ( emr)@xcite , and the large magnetoresistance ( lmr)@xcite . all these spectacular properties were found in either magnetic systems or in special geometrical structures .    even in ordinary non - magnetic bulk materials",
    "there are interesting magnetoresistance effects . for all conducting pure single crystals",
    "it is experimentally found that the application of a magnetic induction @xmath1 results in an increase of the resistivity @xmath2 ; the magnetoresistance ratio , or just magnetoresistance , defined as @xmath3/\\rho \\left ( 0 \\right)$ ] is positive .",
    "this general behavior of the crystalline state is in sharp contrast to the conduction properties of a number of heavily doped semiconductors where one observes a negative magnetoresistance .",
    "there are many different models@xcite in the literature trying to explain this anomalous behavior .",
    "they are all related to a model by toyozawa@xcite where the conduction electrons scatter against localized spins .",
    "we refer the reader to the review article by alexander and holcomb@xcite for the discussion of some of these models .",
    "the discussion is organized around a model which includes three main features : above the critical donor concentration , @xmath4 , the electrons are delocalized ; above a second critical donor concentration , @xmath5 , the fermi level passes into the conduction band of the host crystal ; for @xmath6 the electrons exist in a poorly understood `` impurity band '' leading to anomalous propeties .",
    "we proposed a different description@xcite where the donor electrons end up in the conduction band of the host already at the critical concentration @xmath4 .",
    "the anomalous properties on the metallic side of and close to the transition point we suggested were caused by many - body effects .",
    "examples of anomalous behavior is that the resistivity , the heat capacity , and the spin susceptibility are all enhanced close to @xmath4 .",
    "another example is the negative magnetoresistance that we treat in this work .",
    "lately much research has been devoted to systems with positive magnetoresistance showing a linear dependence on the applied magnetic field@xcite .",
    "several mechanisms have been suggested to explain this behavior from geometrical@xcite , classical@xcite , quantum@xcite , and effective medium@xcite perspectives .    in this work",
    "we focus on the magnetoresistance of heavily doped semiconductors near and on the metallic side of the metal - non - metal transition .",

    "phosphorous was implanted at room temperature .",
    "six implantations with energies of 180 , 120 , 80 , 55 , 30 and 15 kev were accumulated in each sample with proper doses to result in a plateau like profile of p from the surface to the depth of 0.30@xmath8 with @xmath9 deviation , according to trim code simulation@xcite .",
    "the implanted p doses were @xmath10 ( at 180 kev ) , @xmath11 ( at 120 kev ) , @xmath12 ( at 80 kev ) , @xmath13 ( at 55 kev ) , @xmath14 ( at 30 kev ) , and @xmath15 ( at 15 kev ) in order to achieve a p concentration of @xmath16 .",
    "the simulated concentration profile is shown in fig.[figu1 ] .",
    "the doses in the other samples were scaled to this sample , according to the ratio of the desired p concentration .",
    "samples with implanted p concentrations of @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath16 were prepared .",
    "the damage annealing and the electrical activation of p were performed at 900 @xmath21 for 20 minutes in argon atmosphere in a conventional furnace .",
    "van der pauw structures@xcite were fabricated by manually applied indium contacts at the corners of square @xmath22 samples .",
    "annealing at 300 @xmath21 on a hot plate was performed to improve the contacts .",
    "the implantation process as well as the obtained values of the electron concentrations are also described in detail in refs.@xcite and@xcite .",
    ".,width=302 ]    we performed magneto - transport measurements on the described structures with van der pauw geometries , exploiting conventional lock - in technique with frequencies 7 - 13 hz , in the temperature range of 1.5 - 4.2 k and bias current of 10 @xmath23 which is low enough to prevent heating effect and at the same time provide a well defined signal for our measurements .",

    "apart from the kinetic energy there are contributions from the interactions between the electrons ( the exchange and correlation energy , @xmath35 ) and from the interactions with the ionized - donor potentials ( the band - structure energy , @xmath36 ) .",
    "these interaction energies lead to a deformation of the parabolic band dispersion and a modification of the density of states .",

    "this causes the initial negative magnetoresistance .",
    "the enhancement of the density of states at the fermi - level for both spin types as function of magnetic induction is shown in fig.[figu7 ] for the sample with doping concentration @xmath83 @xmath25 at @xmath84 k.    there is another effect that acts in the same direction .",
    "there are friedel oscillations@xcite in the screening - charge density centered around each impurity potential with fourier component @xmath85 or @xmath86 .",
    "this leads to an enhanced scattering rate in the back scattering direction across the fermi spheres and an enhancement of the resistivity . at zero magnetic field",
    "the friedel oscillations have the same periodicity for spin up and spin down electrons ; both type of electrons scatter equally strongly against both friedel oscillations . when the magnetic field is turned on the friedel oscillations will split up into two ; one with fourier component @xmath87 ; one with fourier component @xmath88 .",
    "this means that the back - scattering rate for an electron of a certain spin against the friedel oscillations of the opposite spin is reduced .",
    "the enhancement of the resistivity is thus reduced leading to a negative magnetoresistance . however , this effect is expected to give a much smaller contribution to the negative magnetoresistance than the density of states effect since the electron can scatter with a wave number ranging from zero up to two times the fermi wave number .",
    "all our calculations are for zero temperature .",
    "what happens for non - zero temperatures ?",
    "if we study classical experiments@xcite we find that the negative magnetoresistance effect is gradually reduced when the temperature is enhanced .",
    "this is consistent with our theory .",
    "the peak at the fermi - level of the density of states is expected to be broadened . besides , at zero temperature only states at the fermi - level takes part in the conductivity .",
    "when the temperature goes up also states away from the fermi - level where the enhancement in the density of states is weaker take part .",
    "both these effects are expected to gradually remove the negative magnetoresistance .",
    "the temperature effects are expected to be more and more important the lower the density .",
    "this is also what is found experimentally@xcite .",
    "@xmath25 at @xmath84 k. , width=302 ]        in fig.[figu8 ] we see that the maximum negative magnetoresistance increases linearly on a log - log plot when the density is reduced . for finite temperature",
    "the maximum is expected to start decreasing at a density that depends on the temperature . the higher the temperature the earlier the decrease",
    "is expected to set in . in fig.8 of ref.@xcite this decrease is observed .",
    "we have performed magnetoresistance measurements of heavily phosphorous doped silicon and compared the results to theory .",
    "the resistance was calculated using the so - called generalized drude approach taking many - body effects into account .",
    "we propose that the origin of the negative magnetoresistance is a combination of two effects .",
    "the many - body effects lead to an enhancement of the density of states at the fermi level which in turn results in an enhancement of the resistivity .",
    "friedel oscillations in the screening charge density cause an enhanced back - scattering rate across the fermi volumes leading to an additional enhancement of the resistivity .",
    "when the magnetic field is turned on the enhancement of the density of states for each spin type is split up into two peaks , one at the fermi - level and one that moves away from the fermi - level with enhanced magnetic field .",
    "this reduces the resistivity .",
    "also , the back - scattering rate against the friedel oscillations will be reduced in the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "both these effects act towards a negative magnetoresistance .",
    "the first effect is expected to be dominating .",
    "we would have liked to have samples that cover a broader range of doping concentrations from closer to @xmath4 to a much higher value .",
    "unfortunately , we have had contact problems preventing high quality measurements .",
    "we hope to come back with complementary results in the near future .",
    "from our work we can deduce that the metal - non - metal transition in heavily @xmath0-doped si is driven by electron - electron and electron doping - ion interactions and not by spin - flip scattering or spin - orbit scattering .",
    "this is in line with the findings in ref.@xcite for @xmath89-doped si ( si : b ) where these conclusions could be drawn from the universal scaling of the magnetoconductance of that system .    we have not been able to find any recent work on the magnetoresistance of heavily doped si near the metal - non - metal transition .",
    "we hope that the present work will inspire the readers to perform new such measurements .",
    "recently@xcite one has managed to produce samples of sulfur - doped silicon at non - equilibrium concentrations in a range covering the concentration of the metal - non - metal transition .",
    "this was achieved by using ion implantation followed by pulsed - laser melting and rapid resolidification .",
    "sulfur is a deep level impurity in crystalline silicon and @xmath4 is much higher than for phosphorus doping .",
    "one estimated @xmath4 to be between 1.8 and @xmath90 , i.e. , two orders of magnitude higher than for phosphorous doping .",
    "it would be very interesting to see magnetoresistance measurements being performed on these samples .",
