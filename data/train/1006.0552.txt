    "the behavior of the transition strength of the scissors mode at small @xmath92 may be explained by the small mixing of the oscillator state with @xmath109 , @xmath110 and @xmath111 into the condensate because the scissors mode is mainly excited through the transitions from the component of the oscillator state with @xmath109 , @xmath110 and @xmath111 in the condensate to the oscillator states with @xmath109 , @xmath110 and @xmath107 .",

    "the small transition strength of the scissors mode implies that the scissors mode may be easily masked by the @xmath67 quadrupole mode if there is a tiny change in the shape of the trapping potential during the excitation process of the scissors mode .",
    "since the number of the harmonic oscillator states needed in our approach rapidly increases with increasing number of fermions , we can only manage rather small systems .",

    "@xcite . it is pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite that in a spherically symmetric trapping potential , dipolar fermion gases with the closed - shell configurations where the oscillator states up to a certain oscillator shell are fully occupied have small interaction energy and negligible deformation because of the cancelation between the attractive and repulsive parts of the dipolar interaction . the numbers of fermions corresponding to the closed - shell configurations are @xmath115 , 10 , 20 , 35 , 56 , and so on . since such closed - shell gases are rather exceptional , we first consider a deformed gas consisting of 18 fermions , which has a simple configuration with two fermions removed from the @xmath116 closed - shell configuration . since the dipolar interaction favors a density distribution elongated along the polarized axis , a configuration where the oscillators states with the highest @xmath117 are empty has the lowest energy among the configurations with @xmath118 as long as the interaction is not strong : these vacated states are the oscillator states with @xmath119 , @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
