    "recent chandra and xmm observations of hot gas in clusters and galaxies have radically altered our previous models for cooling flows and presented new possibilities for understanding them in a different way .",
    "x - ray spectra taken with the xmm rgs ( reflection grating spectrometer ) fail to show line emission from ions having intermediate or low temperatures , implying that the cooling gas is somehow hidden from view or that the cooling rate is at least 5 or 10 times less than previously assumed ( e.g. peterson et al .",
    "2001 ; tamura et al . 2001 ; kaastra et al . 2001 ; xu et al . 2001 ; sakelliou , et al .",
    "xmm - epic observations also fail to detect cooling gas ( molendi & pizzolato 2001 ; bhringer et al .",
    ". however , x - ray images reveal that the hot gas inside the e or cd galaxies located at the centers of cooling flows is often highly disturbed ( e.g. bhringer et al . 1993 ; fabian et al 2000 ; mcnamara et al . 2000 ; loewenstein et al . 2000 ; blanton et al 2001 ; jones et al .",
    "2002 ; forman et al . 2001 ; buote et al . 2002 ; trinchieri & goudfrooij 2002 ) .",
    "evidently , massive black holes , thought to lie at the centers of all stellar bulges , become intermittently active possibly stimulated by the inflow of hot gas . of particular interest",
    "are the cavities in the hot gas that are often ( but not always ) associated with radio lobes as in perseus / ngc 1275 ( fabian et al 2000 ) and hydraa/3c295 ( mcnamara et al .",
    "2000 ; david et al . 2001 ; allen et al 2001 ) .",
    "cavities occur when ultrahot or relativistic gas displaces the hot thermal gas .",
    "since the rims surrounding the x - ray cavities are typically no hotter than other ambient gas ( fabian 2001 ; mcnamara 2001 ) , strong shocks do not seem to be involved in producing the holes so the innerhole gas is in approximate pressure equilibrium with gas in the rims ( nulsen et al 2002 ; soker , blanton & sarazin 2002 ; brighenti & mathews 2002c ) .",
    "obviously the holes must be buoyant ( churazov et al . 2001 ) and their formation and subsequent evolution must feed energy into the cooling flow gas .",
    "can the heating visible in chandra images explain the absence of cooling in xmm spectra ?",
    "this question can be answered only from studies of the global effect of many heating episodes over many gyrs .",
    "recently we presented a number of evolutionary models of so - called cooling flows that were heated by a variety of scenarios initiated by gas flowing into the central black hole ( brighenti & mathews 2002b ) .",
    "none of the flow models we considered were satisfactory ; whenever the heating was sufficient to reduce the rate that gas cools near the center , the flow was highly disrupted and spatially distributed cooling occurred at larger radii at essentially the same rate as in the unheated flows .    in the light of several recent developments  including the significant continued interest in heated flows  we are encouraged to reconsider such models again here .",
    "our first motivation is the argument by narayan & medvedev ( 2001 ) that thermal conductivity is reduced only by @xmath3 in the presence of tangled magnetic fields which are expected in cooling flows .",
    "secondly , in a recent paper ruszkowski & begelman ( 2002 ) demonstrated that heating and thermal conduction can conspire to produce successful cluster cooling flows that have the characteristic positive temperature gradient at small radii , a common observed feature in all these flows .",
    "finally , in our models we follow the prescription of ruszkowski & begelman and other authors ( e.g. binney & tabor 1995 ; tucker & david 1997 ; ciotti & ostriker 2001 ) by considering cluster and galactic flows in which the mechanical energy released by the central agn is exactly proportional to the mass of gas that flows into the center of the flow , optimizing the effect of the energy feedback .    in the following models we consider the long term evolution of hot gas on both cluster and galactic scales but with different approaches .",
    "our models are intended to be generic , but as a guide to their success we compare them with recent observations of abell 1795 and ngc 4472 for cluster and galactic flows respectively . since cluster flows",
    "are occasionally disturbed by merging events , we begin with a quiescent post - merger flow initially in hydrostatic equilibrium and follow its evolution for several gyrs under the influence of radiative cooling , agn feedback heating in the core , and thermal conduction . for galactic flows ,",
    "we begin with a model elliptical having an additional complement of circumgalactic hot gas and follow its evolution for 12 gyrs under the influence of radiative cooling , agn heating and conduction as well as the additional effects of type ia supernovae and stellar mass loss appropriate to galactic flows .",
    "we find that it is possible to get marginally satisfactory solutions for cluster flows provided the parameters are chosen within rather narrow limits .",
    "however , our models of galactic cooling flows with the same choice of parameters are inadequate or require additional possibly unsatisfactory assumptions .",
    "the calculations described below are based on the same flow equations described in detail in our previous work on heated cooling flows ( brighenti & mathews 2002b ) and the reader is referred to that paper for details .",
    "we assume no distributed radiative cooling , but this may occur naturally in convective regions when mass elements collide and compress . in such instances",
    "we remove the gas from the flow when the temperature has dropped to @xmath4 k as described in brighenti & mathews ( 2002b ) .",
    "results of 1d and 2d are in essential agreement when applied to the same flow ( see brighenti & mathews 2002b ) although 2d flows are essential to describe flows with off - center heating .",
    "the grid spacing we use varies with the overall scale of the flow and the number of dimensions considered . _",
    "2d cluster _ : for these flows we use @xmath5 cylindrical zones .",
    "the grid is uniform at 2.5 kpc spacing for the inner @xmath6 zones extending to @xmath7 kpc . beyond this region",
    "the zone size increases geometrically to 2 mpc .",
    "we find very similar results with a @xmath8 grid where the inner @xmath9 zones are 0.4 kpc wide . _",
    "1d cluster _ : these calculations are done with 360 zones increasing in size from 0.5 kpc at the center to an outer boundary at 3 mpc . _",
    "2d galaxy / group _ : these flows are calculated with @xmath10 cylindrical zones . the grid is uniform at 0.25 kpc spacing for the inner @xmath11 zones that extend to @xmath12 kpc . beyond this region",
    "the zone size increases geometrically to 1.7 mpc .",
    "_ 1d galaxy / group _ : here we use 350 zones increasing in size from 0.05 kpc at the center to an outer boundary at 1.6 mpc .",
    "our cluster flow calculations begin in hydrostatic equilibrium with temperature and density profiles based on the well - observed cluster abell 1795 assumed to be at a distance of 243 mpc .",
    "abell 1795 is a typical rich cluster with a central cd galaxy and reasonably relaxed overall structure ( boute & tsai 1996 ) .",
    "abell 1795 has the usual attributes of normal cooling flows : strong central peak in x - ray surface brightness ( e.g. tamura et al . 2001 ) , a central radiative cooling time @xmath13 yrs that is much less than the cluster age ( e.g. edge et al .",
    "1992 ; fabian et al .",

    "1795 chandra images reveal an x - ray emission feature aligned with an optical filament ( fabian et al .",
    "this and the central total mass profile , @xmath14 inside 40 kpc , which is somewhat flatter than nfw , suggest a possible deviation from hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "deprojections of rosat images of abell 1795 led allen et al .",
    "( 2000 ) to conclude that the total cooling rate is @xmath15 @xmath16 yr@xmath17",
    ". however , the xmm rgs spectrum showed no evidence of gas with temperatures less than @xmath18 kev , corresponding to a much smaller upper limit to the cooling rate , @xmath19 @xmath16 yr@xmath17 .",
    "this is consistent with a rate @xmath20 @xmath16 yr@xmath17 estimated from chandra observations ( ettori et al .",
    "2002 ) .    in the upper two rows of figure 1",
    "we show electron density and temperature profiles of abell 1795 determined from observations with xmm ( filled triangles ; tamura et al .",
    "2001 ) and chandra ( open triangles ; ettori et al .",
    "the chandra temperatures have been spatially deprojected and are therefore slightly lower .",
    "we inserted the observed density and temperature profiles into the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium to determine the mass distribution . in this process",
    "we ignore the possible deviations from equilibrium suggested by the chandra observations .",
    "nevertheless , our results described below are independent of the particular mass profile assumed which could have been strictly nfw for example .",
    "our adopted fits @xmath21 and @xmath22 to the observed profiles are shown as dot - dashed lines in the first column of figure 1 .",
    "the central density and temperature in these fits are @xmath23 @xmath24 and @xmath25 k.      in the first column of figure 1 we illustrate the evolution of abell 1795 as determined by radiative losses only with no agn or conductive heating .",
    "our calculations are done in 2d and the results in figure 1 are azimuthally averaged .",
    "for standard cosmological parameters ( @xmath26 ; @xmath27 ; @xmath28",
    "km s@xmath17 mpc@xmath17 ) large clusters like abell 1795 were formed only recently , so we consider their evolution for only 7 gyrs . as gas within",
    "@xmath29 kpc cools , a subsonic inflow develops to reestablish approximate equilibrium , forcing the central density to rise above the observations . in the bottom row of figure 1",
    "we plot the evolution of the cooling rate @xmath30 which increases from @xmath20 @xmath16 yr@xmath17 at the beginning of the calculation toward an asymptotic value of @xmath31 @xmath16 yr@xmath17 after @xmath32 gyrs when a quasi - steady inflow is established .",
    "not only does this @xmath30 exceed the cooling rate allowed by xmm spectra , all the cooling occurs at the very center where @xmath33 @xmath16 accumulates every gyr .",
    "such an unacceptably huge mass would double the mass of the central cd in a few gyrs .",
    "the results of each evolutionary calculation are summarized in table 1 .      in the next series of models we consider the effect of central and off - central agn heating .",
    "the heating power @xmath34 erg s@xmath17 is proportional to the rate @xmath35 that gas flows into the central grid zone .",
    "the efficiency @xmath36 is a combined measure of both the agn power generated and the fraction that is delivered to the hot cluster gas . as in our previous paper ( brighenti & mathews 2002b ) we assume that the heating is instantaneously transferred to the hot gas near the flow center and that the degree of heating has a gaussian profile @xmath37 $ ] .",
    "the spatial scale of the heated region @xmath38 has only a secondary influence on our results ; we restrict our discussion here to @xmath39 kpc .",
    "our two dimensional ( 2d ) calculations of heated flows create buoyant bubbles that transport energy to larger radii where they eventually dissolve into the background .",
    "the merging of the hot bubbles with the background flow is probably an artifact of numerical diffusion in our code , but a similar dissipation may be naturally accomplished by thermal conduction at the bubble surfaces , where the surface area is greatly enlarged due to rayleigh - taylor instabilities .",
    "we do not attempt to follow the detailed bubble physics here , but only ensure that the injected energy is globally conserved .",
    "the second and third columns in figure 1 shows the consequences of gaussian feedback heating on the 2d flow in the first column using @xmath40 and @xmath41 respectively .",
    "when @xmath42 , the flow evolves in a manner similar to the unheated flow in the first column .",
    "irregularities in the density and temperature profiles are introduced by the heating intermittancy . with @xmath40",
    "the density and temperature profiles after 4 and 7 gyrs are almost acceptable , but @xmath43 ( third row of fig .",
    "1 ) is too large , @xmath44 @xmath16 yr@xmath17 beyond 4.5 gyrs . when the heating efficiency is increased to @xmath45 ( third column of fig .",
    "1 ) , the central cooling rate , @xmath46 @xmath16 yr@xmath17 , is acceptable .",
    "however , for this higher efficiency the gas is much too hot within the heated region and resembles no known cluster .",
    "the results of similar evolutionary calculations with off - center heating ( similar to a one - sided jet ) are shown in the final two columns of figure 1 .",
    "the gaussian heating is displaced 50 kpc from the flow center along the @xmath47-axis , @xmath48 , but all other parameters are identical to the centrally heated flows .",
    "figure 1 shows azimuthally averaged profiles of 2d calculations .",
    "the @xmath40 case has a marginally acceptable central cooling rate ,",
    "@xmath49 @xmath16 yr@xmath17 , but the gas temperature profile within @xmath50 kpc is flatter than normal . as before @xmath45 lowers @xmath43 to acceptable values but clearly overheats the gas .    in summary , both heated and unheated flows deviate from typical cluster profiles after a few gyrs .",
    "when the heating is large enough to satisfy the upper limits on @xmath43 imposed by xmm spectra , the flow profiles are too distorted to be acceptable .",
    "there is only a very small range of heating efficiencies for which these problems are minimized ( but not removed ) .",
    "these general conclusions also apply to similar calculations with different heating scales @xmath38 .",
    "finally , all the gas cools at or near the origin in these heated flows ( table 1 ) .",
    "since the temperature gradient is negative throughout the observed region in abell 1795 , the central parts of the flow are conductively heated from the outside .",
    "however , just after the center of the flow is heated with agn energy , thermal conduction rapidly transfers this energy outward toward larger radii .",
    "we first discuss the influence of conduction alone and then the combined effect of conduction plus heating on the evolution of abell 1795 . because of the shorter computational time steps",
    "when conduction is included , we describe the evolution of these flows in 1d . based on examples discussed in our previous paper ( brighenti & mathews 2002b ) , we are confident that the 1d calculations are trustworthy since 1d and 2d models are in essential agreement in every case that we have tested .    thermal conductivity in a hot plasma , @xmath51 erg / sec cm",
    "k can be important at high temperatures , but is reduced by magnetic fields .",
    "the effect of magnetic suppression on the thermal flux @xmath52 is represented with a coefficient @xmath53 which is assumed to be uniform in the flow .",
    "it is well known that thermal conduction perpendicular to a uniform magnetic field is lowered by many orders of magnitude , so it has generally been assumed that @xmath54 applied to any plasma with a reasonably tangled magnetic field .",
    "however , narayan & medvedev ( 2001 ) have recently shown that @xmath55 is appropriate for thermal conduction in a hot plasma with chaotic magnetic field fluctuations and this opens up new possibilities for cooling flows .",
    "the evolution of abell 1795 with thermal conduction but no agn heating is illustrated in the first column of figure 2 .",
    "each curve in figure 2 is labeled with three parameters , ( @xmath36,@xmath56,@xmath57 in gyrs ) .",
    "the influence of conduction on unheated cluster flows is quite sensitive to @xmath56 .",
    "when @xmath58 the conductive flux is so high that the solution begins to deviate from the observations after only 1 gyr and by 4 gyrs the temperature profile is almost isothermal .",
    "this @xmath22 is clearly discordant with observations although @xmath43 is nicely suppressed ( table 1 ) .",
    "the flow with @xmath59 is similar to that of the unheated flow in figure 1 .",
    "the value of @xmath56 required to maintain the observed profiles in abell 1795 is @xmath0 ( see table 1 ) , but this optimal value probably varies from cluster to cluster .",
    "the fine - tuning of the @xmath56 parameter as well as the difficulty in balancing radiative losses near the centers of cooling flows with the inward conduction of heat from larger radii are well known from previous studies ( stewart , canizares , fabian & nulsen 1984 ; bertschinger & meiksin 1986 ; meiksin 1988 ; bregman & david 1988 ; loewenstein , zweibel & begelman 1991 ; brighenti & mathews 2002b ) .    however , the effect of thermal conduction in heated flows helps to spread the agn heating into the flow , preserving smooth temperature profiles resembling the observations .",
    "flows with agn heating and conduction are shown in the second and third columns of figure 2 . for @xmath59 and @xmath60 ( second column of fig .",
    "2 ) both the density and temperature profiles are maintained for up to 4 gyrs .",
    "these results are similar to the model described by ruszkowski & begelman ( 2002 ) in which a cluster flow is heated by conduction from the outside and the entire flow is instantaneously heated from the inside when gas flows into the central agn .",
    "we have duplicated the ruszkowski - begelman cluster flow with our own program using their type of agn heating . in general a combination of central agn heating and thermal conduction can produce cluster flows with many desirable features . while the details of the flows depend on the spatial scale @xmath38 of the centrally heated regions , satisfactory gasdynamic flows in general agreement with cluster observations can be found for a wide range of feedback heating scales @xmath38 .",
    "however , unlike ruszkowski & begelman , we find that the results are sensitive to the value of the magnetic suppression coefficient @xmath56 , as illustrated in the third column of figure 2 .",
    "for a given heating efficiency @xmath36 the flow evolves toward isothermality if @xmath61 and cools similar to the unheated flow ( column 1 , fig .",
    "1 ) if @xmath62 .",
    "the @xmath43 for the @xmath63 solution also exceeds the observed limits for @xmath64 gyrs .",
    "happily , these bad outcomes bracket the value @xmath65 proposed by narayan & medvedev ( 2001 ) .",
    "all the heated flows shown in figure 2 vary with time within @xmath66 kpc .",
    "but the negative thermal gradients produced by intermittent heating in this region are short - lived because of the efficiency of the outward heat flux due to thermal conduction .",
    "since none of the times at which the heated flows are plotted in figure 2 directly follows a heating episode , the temperature gradients shown there are generally positive .",
    "the combination of heating and thermal conduction also has a dramatic influence on the cooling rate @xmath43 shown in the bottom row of figure 2 and in table 1 .",
    "of the four combinations of @xmath36 and @xmath56 shown in the last two columns of figure 2 , only @xmath40 and @xmath63 has a cooling rate @xmath43 that exceeds the xmm upper limits for ngc 1795 after time 4 gyrs .",
    "since we do nt know how old abell 1795 is or when it may have been thermally upset by a major merger , the age of the cluster flow must be regarded as an additional parameter in addition to @xmath36 and @xmath56 .",
    "the density and temperature profiles plotted in the second column of figure 2 are in satisfactory agreement with abell 1795 observations for @xmath67 gyrs . at later times both",
    "flows continue to agree well with the observed profiles until @xmath68 gyrs when @xmath43 exceeds the xmm upper limits and cooling features develop just beyond the region of agn heating at @xmath69 kpc . within the uncertainties ,",
    "the two solutions in column 2 successfully match the observations of abell 1795 for @xmath70 gyrs .",
    "temperature profiles in the outer regions of clusters can also be used to constrain the thermal conduction parameter @xmath56 , but the observations are controversial .",
    "temperature profiles observed in cluster samples by markevitch et al .",
    "( 1998 ) with _ asca _ and de grandi & molendi ( 2002 ) with _ bepposax _ characteristically decline by a factor of @xmath18 between 0.1 and 0.5 of the virial radius @xmath71 .",
    "loeb ( 2002 ) points out that the outward conductive flux in this region would erase the negative temperature gradients unless @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the cluster age and the mean temperature @xmath74 is weighted toward larger radii . when applied to abell 1795 ( assuming @xmath75 kev ) we find @xmath76 , which is comparable to the maximum @xmath58 that we consider in our models .",
    "however , the thermal profiles @xmath22 determined by various detectors and x - ray data reduction procedures are inconsistent .",
    "for example , the xmm - pn gas temperature profile of abell 1795 from tamura et al .",
    "( 2001 ) that we plot in figures 1 and 2 continues to rise slowly at @xmath77 whereas the original combined xmm data is nearly isothermal from 0.1 to 0.4 @xmath71 ( arnaud et al . 2001 ) .",
    "both xmm data sets differ greatly from the mean cluster profile of markevitch et al .",
    "for which @xmath78 throughout this region .",
    "several additional clusters observed more recently with xmm also have nearly isothermal thermal profiles ( arnaud et al . 2002 ; pratt & arnaud 2002 ) .",
    "since the original cluster temperature is likely to decrease with radius ( e.g. loken et al . 2002 ) , these nearly isothermal clusters clusters suggest that @xmath56 may exceed the maximum set by loeb .    in many respects",
    "a combination of agn heating with efficiency @xmath79 and conductive suppression @xmath80 gives excellent results for the evolution of rich clusters like abell 1795 .",
    "however , abell 1795 is far away and details of the flow near its central cd galaxy are not available . in central e or cd galaxies in nearby clusters ",
    "m87 in virgo , ngc 4874 in coma and the cd in abell 1060  the gas temperature drops to @xmath81 kev inside the optical galaxy ( m87 with xmm : bhringer et al . 2001 ; molendi & gastaldello 2001 ; ngc 4874 with chandra : vikhlinin et al .",
    "2001 ; abell 1060 with chandra : yamasaki , ohashi & furusho 2002 ) .",
    "it is clear from the second column of figure 2 that the temperature at a few kpc exceeds 1 kev , particularly if @xmath82 .",
    "all our calculations for abell 1795 included a massive central e galaxy with stellar mass loss etc .",
    "so the temperature comparison can be made rather accurately . in our recent paper on m87 and ngc 4874 ( brighenti & mathews 2002a ) we showed that the sharp central temperature drop in the central e galaxy is possible only if @xmath83 .",
    "perhaps our results in figure 2 would improve if @xmath56 decreased at small galactic radius .",
    "we now apply the same combination of thermal conduction and heating to flows on galactic scales . for a representative x - ray galaxy",
    "we choose ngc 4472 , a well - observed massive e1 galaxy and the brightest galaxy in the virgo cluster , assumed to be at a distance of d = 17 mpc .",
    "ngc 4472 is also a typical group - centered e galaxy since it is surrounded by an extended cloud of hotter gas at @xmath84 kev , similar to the virial temperature of the galaxy group from which ngc 4472 formed .",
    "although the hot gas distribution in ngc 4472 is asymmetric at large radii , perhaps due to an interaction with the virgo cluster , its azimuthally averaged density , shown in the top row of figure 3 , is similar to many other group - dominant e galaxies with extended x - ray emission .",
    "our evolutionary calculation for the galaxy / group differs somewhat from that of for the cluster .",
    "we assume that the stellar configuration in ngc 4472 was assembled at some early time @xmath85 gyr in an nfw dark halo of total mass @xmath86 @xmath16 .",
    "the stellar density distribution @xmath87 has a constant de vaucouleurs profile ( total mass : @xmath88 @xmath16 ; effective radius : @xmath89 kpc ) with a core @xmath90 within the break radius @xmath91 pc ( gebhardt 1996 ; faber et al .",
    "1997 ) . as the ( essentially ) single burst stellar population evolves , it expels mass at a rate @xmath92 gm @xmath24 s@xmath17 where @xmath93 s@xmath17 and @xmath94 gyrs is the current cosmic time .",
    "we assume that gas ejected from stars rapidly merges with the hot gas ( in @xmath95 yrs ) .",
    "a modest amount of additional heating is provided by type ia supernovae at a rate snu@xmath96snu@xmath97 where snu@xmath98 in snu - units ( supernovae per @xmath99 per 100 years ) gives good agreement with the currently observed iron abundance in the hot gas of ngc 4472 .",
    "the circumgalactic hot gas component , required to reproduce the x - ray image far beyond @xmath100 , is also added at time @xmath101 in hydrostatic equilibrium with the nfw halo ; we find that a variety of different scenarios for creating the circumgalactic gas gives similar results at time @xmath102 .      as before we begin with a 2d cooling flow model for ngc 4472 without agn or conductive heating , but with radiative cooling .",
    "the evolved state of this model at time @xmath94 gyrs is shown in the first column of figure 3 .",
    "the temperature distribution is in good agreement with the observed profile , the gas cools by radiation losses as it flows inward .",
    "however , the computed density clearly exceeds the observed density within about 10 kpc and fails to develop the small central core characteristic of e galaxies observed with chandra ( loewenstein et al .",
    "this density discrepancy is a generic difficulty with all simple cooling flows of this type .",
    "the current cooling rate at the center of ngc 4472 is @xmath103 @xmath16 yr@xmath17 , but it was larger in the past . since time @xmath85 gyr , a total mass @xmath104 @xmath16 has cooled , but @xmath105 can be reduced somewhat if 4472 is assumed to form at a later time . aside from the unrealistic rise in density , the problems with this model are that @xmath105 is too large ( for any reasonable @xmath101 ) and @xmath43 is probably about 5 or 10 times too large , based on xmm rgs observations of ngc 4636 , an e galaxy similar to ngc 4472 ( xu et al . 2001 ) .      the second and third columns in figure 3 show the effect of feedback heating for three efficiencies @xmath36 using a gaussian heating profile with @xmath106 kpc .",
    "these are 2d flows , azimuthally averaged in the figure .",
    "centrally heated flows with @xmath107 and @xmath108 ( in column 2 ) differ little from the unheated flow except for fluctuations that accompany quasi - periodic heating episodes captured in the figure at time @xmath102 during a short - lived excursion .",
    "the global properties of these two models in table 1 are comparable .",
    "the total cooling rate @xmath43 is not appreciably reduced until @xmath36 is increased to @xmath41 , but at this level of cooling the computed density and ( especially the ) temperature profiles strongly disagree with observations .",
    "the flows shown in the third column of figure 3 are heated off - center with the gaussian heating shifted to half the effective radius , @xmath109 kpc .",
    "the azimuthally averaged profiles of these 2d flows shown at time @xmath102 in figure 3 have almost nothing in common with the observations and must be rejected .",
    "finally , we note that the gas cools in a larger volume ( @xmath110 kpc ) in the heated flows ( table 1 ) .",
    "this distant cooling arises when convective elements collide at times prior to a heating episode when the mean gas density is high ; see brighenti & mathews ( 2002b ) for a more detailed discussion of this .",
    "the influences of thermal conductivity and agn heating on 1d flows are shown in the fourth and fifth columns of figure 3 .    in the fourth column of figure 3",
    "we show the influence of adding thermal conduction but with no additional agn heating .",
    "each flow is labeled in the figure with values of ( @xmath36 , @xmath56 ) also listed in table 1 .",
    "the 1d ( @xmath111 , @xmath56 ) solutions in column four fit the observed inner density profile at time @xmath102 but this is a momentary fluctuation .",
    "these solutions undergo quasi - cyclic transitions in @xmath112 kpc between high density states ( as in column 1 of fig .",
    "3 ) and the low density states shown in column 4 , figure 3 .",
    "the low density phase of the cyclic variation occurs just after an episode of enhanced cooling very near the center of the flow",
    ". then the density slowly increases toward a high state that exceeds observed densities in @xmath112 kpc .",
    "these cycles do not appear in similar flows without thermal conduction .",
    "the sharp rise in the gas temperature within @xmath113 kpc ( column 4 , figure 3 ) is due to gravitational compression by the large centrally concentrated mass of cooled gas , which was not included in the previously discussed 2d calculations .",
    "this feature is of debatable relevance and would be much less pronounced if the galaxy formation time @xmath101 were later ( see below ) .",
    "although the cooling rate @xmath43 shown in column 4 of figure 3 is clearly reduced by conduction , all of the cooling occurs at the center of the flow where the cold gas mass at @xmath102 is @xmath114 @xmath16 for all @xmath56 considered .",
    "these centrally cooled masses are unacceptably large , but most of this cooling occurred at very early times ( @xmath115 ) when the galactic evolution is uncertain .",
    "for a cosmology with @xmath116 km s@xmath17 mpc@xmath17 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 our initial time @xmath85 gyr corresponds to a redshift @xmath117 , somewhat larger than may be plausible . in the fourth column of figure 3",
    "we plot a third solution with @xmath118 and @xmath119 but with the calculation starting at time @xmath120 gyrs corresponding to @xmath121 . in this case",
    "less gas is expelled from the stars and a much smaller mass of gas cools at the center ( table 1 ) . in this flow",
    "the central density profile exceeds observed values , similar to the unheated flow without conduction in the first column .    in the final column of figure 3",
    "we show two flows with both agn heating and thermal conduction .",
    "the flow with @xmath45 and @xmath59 is an excellent fit to the density and temperature profiles , disregarding the central spike in the temperature created as gas is compressed by the point - like gravitational attraction of centrally cooled gas .",
    "but the global cooling rate for this solution , @xmath122 @xmath16 yr@xmath17 , is too large to be consistent with typical xmm spectral limits .",
    "another solution of this type with @xmath123 and @xmath119 is seen to have a good density profile and a very low @xmath43 , but the temperature is clearly too high for @xmath124 kpc .",
    "this temperature rise is an important defect in the flow and one that can not be removed by fine - tuning @xmath36 and @xmath56 . because of the lower temperature and conductivity @xmath125 in galaxy / group flows",
    ", the conduction needs to be much closer to the spitzer value in order to achieve results similar to the cluster flows .",
    "another quite different problem with these marginally acceptable galaxy / group flows is the iron abundance in the hot gas .",
    "typically the iron abundance is @xmath126solar near the cores of group - centered e galaxies ( e.g. buote et al .",
    "2002 ) where the gas is enriched by type ia supernovae , each producing @xmath127 @xmath16 of iron .",
    "at least some of this iron must go into the hot gas phase since the iron abundance in the gas increases toward the center of the stellar system .",
    "however in otherwise acceptable flows such as those in the last two columns of figure 3 , where the gas density approximately agrees with observations , our computed iron abundance is much larger than observed .",
    "the iron abundance at @xmath102 is shown in figure 4 for the flow with @xmath123 and @xmath119 .",
    "for example , the iron abundance in the computed flow greatly exceeds that observed by buote ( 2000 ) .",
    "one way to avoid this problem , and also retain some of the good features of the heating plus conduction solutions , may be to carefully regulate ( i.e. , fine - tune ) the fraction of type ia iron that ultimately goes into the hot gas .",
    "alternatively , the gas may be cooling in some fashion that can not be observed with xmm .",
    "cluster flows computed with both agn heating and thermal conduction reduced by a factor @xmath0 from the spitzer value can provide acceptable fits to cluster flow observations . within broad limits ,",
    "successful flows are insensitive to the ( gaussian ) width @xmath38 of the feedback - heated region . the observed density and temperature profiles",
    "can be maintained with lower cooling rates as required by xmm spectra .",
    "nevertheless , in these solutions the gas temperature may be too high within @xmath1 kpc of the center , i.e. inside the central cd galaxy .",
    "if so , it may be necessary to consider flows with a radially variable conductive suppression factor @xmath56 .",
    "flows on galactic scales also benefit from the combined effects of agn heating and conduction , but the agreement is less satisfactory than for cluster flows . the parameters that provide marginally acceptable , but not ideal , flow solutions on galaxy / group scales  ( @xmath36,@xmath56 ) = ( 0,0.5),(0,1 ) and ( @xmath128,1 )  require that @xmath56 be much closer to the spitzer value than for cluster flows . such large values @xmath129  at the higher temperatures of clusters",
    " would be inconsistent with the `` cold fronts '' observed in clusters ( e.g. markevitch et al .",
    "2000 ) and may promote cluster isothermality as described by loeb ( 2002 ) .",
    "values of @xmath130 also exceed the predictions of narayan & medvedev ( 2001 ) .",
    "perhaps the field geometry is more favorable to thermal conduction in undisturbed parts of the flows , which we emphasize here , than in the cold fronts where fields transverse to the thermal gradient are expected ( ettori & fabian 2000 ) .",
    "nevertheless , higher values of the conductivity coefficient @xmath56 are required in galaxies / groups to achieve the same benefits as in hotter cluster gas and it can be doubted if such large conductivities are physically acceptable .",
    "another difficulty with our galaxy / group heated flows are the high hot gas iron abundances , several times higher than observed .",
    "the high iron abundance occurs in the computed flows when the gas density is lowered ( by heating ) to fit the observed profile .",
    "the type ia supernova rate that we assume , snu@xmath98 snu , is already much lower than the combined rate observed in e and s0 galaxies , @xmath131 ( cappellaro et al .",
    "1999 ) . therefore , to fully accept the beneficial effects of heating plus conduction in galactic flows , it is also necessary to hypothesize some means of reducing the computed iron abundance : some ( but not all of ) the iron produced in type ia may cool before entering the hot gas , some distributed cooling is present to remove the excess iron , etc .",
    "flows on the galaxy / group scale are much more constrained by x - ray observations than cluster scale flows , although the latter have received by far the most attention from observers .",
