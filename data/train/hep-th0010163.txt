    "in modern theories of unified physical interactions , spacetime has more than four dimensions .",
    "it is well - known that kaluza - klein theory  @xcite tells us that the spacetime which has more than four dimensions .",
    "superstring theories ( e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) are at the moment the most promising candidates for a unified description of the basic physical interactions .",
    "there are five anomaly - free , perturbative superstring theories .",
    "the critical dimensions of spacetime are ten for these theories .",
    "there is now evidence that the five superstring theories are related with each other by dualities .",
    "it is conjectured that these theories can be regarded as the limits of an unique theory , so called m - theory , in which spacetime has eleven dimensions .",
    "m - theory seems to be related to @xmath4 , @xmath5 supergravity theory at low energy .",
    "conventionally , it is thought that the extra dimension is quite small , say the planck scale , and then it has not been observed yet",
    ".    how does compactification of the extra dimension take place ?",
    "the explanation is through multidimensional cosmology  @xcite . in general relativity ,",
    "the geometry of spacetime is dynamical .",
    "the three - dimensional space we observe was once as small as the internal space , and expanded during evolution of the universe , while internal space contracted or has remained small during evolution of the universe .",
    "therefore , internal space is microscopic and is not observable .",
    "this explanation is called dynamical compactification .",
    "one of alternative approaches by branes in string theory has been suggested  @xcite .",
    "that is the brane world scenario , where the standard model gauge and matter fields exist inside branes while gravitons propagate in the bulk of spacetime .",
    "if this is true , the situation in which gravity exists in the bulk of the 11-dimensional spacetime , while the standard model particles exist on a 3-brane is possible .",
    "phenomenologically , the brane world scenario was proposed to solve the hierarchy problem ( e. g. refs .",
    "this type of the brane world scenario may be motivated by hoava and witten  @xcite .",
    "hoava - witten scenario is reduced to five - dimensional effective theory at low energy .",
    "indeed , lukas and et al  @xcite have shown that this five - dimensional theory admits a supersymmetric solution describing a pair of thin domain walls .",
    "one of the four - dimensional domain walls in five - dimensional spacetime is considered as our universe .",
    "randall and sundrum ( rs1 )  @xcite proposed a toy model to solve the hierarchy problem .",
    "this model is the system with two branes like the hoava - witten scenario .",
    "in addition , randall and sundrum ( rs2 )  @xcite presented the scenario with noncompact extra space .",
    "this model is the system with a single positive tension brane . in this scenario , although the hierarchy problem is not solved , it is very interesting that gravity is localized on 3-brane due to the exponentially decreasing warp factor of the bulk metric . in the basis of the scenario ,",
    "the brane world cosmology has been studied so far  @xcite .",
    "the low - energy effective theories of superstring theories and m - theory are supergravity theories , including dilaton field and antisymmetric tensor field etc  @xcite .",
    "the dilaton field exists naturally in string theories . since we might be able to assume that the antisymmetric field behaves as a cosmological constant effectively , it is interesting to investigate dilatonic brane world scenario with a cosmological constant .",
