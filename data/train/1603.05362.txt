    "two kinds of important optimal control problems for linear controlled systems are minimal time control problems and minimal norm control problems .",
    "a minimal time control problem is to ask for a control ( taking values from a control constraint set which is , in general , a closed and bounded subset in a control space ) which drives the corresponding solution of a controlled system from an initial state to a target set in the shortest time , while a minimal norm control problem is to ask for a control which has the minimal norm among all controls that drive the corresponding solutions of a controlled systems from an initial state to a target set at fixed ending time .",
    "several important issues on minimal time ( or minimal norm ) control problems are as follows : the pontryagin maximum principle of minimal time ( or minimal norm ) controls ( see , for instance , @xcite ) ; the existence of minimal time ( or minimal norm ) controls ( see , for instance , @xcite ) ; their connections with controllabilities ( see , for instance @xcite ) ; numerical analyses on minimal time ( or minimal norm ) controls ( see , for instance , @xcite ) ; and the bang - bang property of minimal time ( or minimal norm ) controls ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .    in this paper , we concern the bang - bang properties for these two kinds of problems in the case that both state and control spaces are real hilbert spaces , controlled systems are linear and time - invariant , target sets are the origin of state spaces , control constraint sets are closed balls in control spaces ( centered at the origin ) and controls are @xmath4 functions .",
    "the bang - bang property for a minimal time control problem means that any minimal time control , as a function of time , point - wisely takes its value at the boundary of the control constraint set , while the bang - bang property for a minimal norm control problem means that each minimal norm control , as a function of time , point - wisely takes the minimal norm .",
    "the significance of the bang - bang property for minimal time control problems can be explained from the following aspects : ( i ) mathematically , the bang - bang property means that each minimizer of a functional ( from @xmath18 to a bounded and closed subset in a hilbert space ) point - wisely takes value on the boundary of this subset .",
    "( ii ) from application point of view , the bang - bang property means that each minimal time control takes the most advantage of possible control actions .",
    "for instance , controls always have bounds which are designed by peoples .",
    "the bigger bounds are designed , the more costs peoples pay .",
    "if the bang - bang property holds for a minimal time problem , then the designed bound for controls will not be wasted at almost each time .",
    "( iii ) the bang - bang property is powerful in the studies of minimal time control problems .",
    "for instance , in many cases , the uniqueness of minimal time controls follows from this property ; in some cases , this property can help people to do more dedicate numerical analyses on minimal time controls ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .",
    "we can also explain the significance of the bang - bang property for minimal norm control problems from both mathematical and application points of view .",
    "in most literatures on the bang - bang property for the minimal time ( or minimal norm ) control problems , peoples mainly concern about : ( i ) for a given problem , whether the bang - bang property holds ; ( ii ) applications of the bang - bang property ( see , for instance , @xcite and the references therein ) .    in this paper , we study the bang - bang properties of the minimal time control problems and the minimal norm control problems from a different perspective .",
    "the motivation of this study is as follows : two typical minimal time and minimal norm control problems in the finitely dimensional setting are as follows : let @xmath19 and @xmath20 ( with @xmath21 ) be the state space and the control space .",
    "let @xmath8 be a pair of matrices in @xmath22 .",
    "given @xmath3 and @xmath23 , consider the minimal time control problem : @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 is the solution to the equation : @xmath27 given @xmath23 and @xmath28 , consider the minimal norm control problem : @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 is the solution to the equation : @xmath32 in the problem @xmath33 , @xmath34 is called the minimal time ; @xmath35 is called an admissible control if @xmath36 for some @xmath37 ; @xmath38 is called a minimal time control if @xmath39 and @xmath40 over @xmath41 .",
    "we say that the problem @xmath33 has the bang - bang property if any minimal time control @xmath42 verifies that @xmath43 for a.e .",
    "when @xmath33 has no any admissible control , we agree that it does not hold the bang - bang property and @xmath45 . in the problem @xmath46 , @xmath47 is called the minimal norm ; @xmath48 is called an admissible control if @xmath49 ; @xmath50 is called a minimal norm control if @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "we say that the problem @xmath46 has the bang - bang property if any minimal norm control @xmath53 verifies that @xmath54 for a.e .",
    "when @xmath46 has no any admissible control , we agree that it does not hold the bang - bang property and @xmath56 .",
    "when @xmath8 is fixed in @xmath22 , the problem @xmath33 depends only on the pair @xmath5 which belongs to the product space : @xmath57 and the problem @xmath46 depends only on the pair @xmath6 which belongs to the space : @xmath58 by applying the kalman controllability decomposition to the pair @xmath8 ( see , for instance , lemma 3.3.3 and lemma 3.3.4 in @xcite ) , we can easily divide the space @xmath59 into two disjoint parts so that when @xmath5 is in one part , the corresponding @xmath33 has the bang - bang property ; when @xmath5 is in another part , the corresponding @xmath33 has no any admissible control ( which implies that it does not hold the bang - bang property ) .",
    "the same can be said about the space @xmath60 .",
    "we call such decompositions as the bbp decompositions for @xmath33 and @xmath46 , respectively .",
    "the exact bbp decompositions for the above two problems are the following ( p1 ) and ( p2 ) : @xmath61 here , @xmath62 where @xmath63 @xmath64 where @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "( notice that both @xmath67 and @xmath68 are not empty .",
    "these are proved in appendix a , see ( [ appendixwang8.17 ] ) and ( [ newyearyuan1.12 ] ) . )",
    "the proofs of ( p1 ) and ( p2 ) , via the kalman controllability decomposition , are given in appendix a. though the proofs are quite simple , such bbp decompositions seem to be new .",
    "( at least we do not find them in any published literature . ) _ a natural question is how to extend the above - mentioned bbp decompositions to the infinitely dimensional setting where state and control spaces are two real hilbert spaces , @xmath11 is a generator of a @xmath12-semigroup on the state space and @xmath13 is a linear operator from the control space to the state space . _",
    "the purpose of this paper is to build up such bbp decompositions in the infinitely dimensional setting .",
    "the main difficulty to get such extension is the lack of the kalman controllability decomposition in the infinitely dimensional setting .",
    "our first key to overcome this difficulty is to find two properties held by any pair of matrices @xmath8 in @xmath9 so that they have the following functionalities : ( i ) with the aid of these properties , we can get the decompositions ( p1 ) and ( p2 ) , without using the kalman controllability decomposition ; ( ii ) these properties can be easily stated in the infinitely dimensional setting .",
    "the first one is a kind of unique continuation property from measurable set for functions : @xmath69 , with @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "this property follows immediately from the analyticity of the function @xmath72 , @xmath73 , in the finitely dimensional setting . in our infinitely dimensional setting",
    ", it is the assumption ( h2 ) given in the next subsection .",
    "the second property is quite hidden : _ for all @xmath74 and @xmath1 , with @xmath75 , and @xmath76 , with supp @xmath77 , there is @xmath78 , with supp @xmath79 , so that @xmath80 , where @xmath81 and @xmath82 denote the solutions of ( [ 0123-intro-2 ] ) with the same initial datum @xmath83 and controls @xmath84 and @xmath85 , respectively . _",
    "( proposition  [ lemma-8ex1 - 1 ] in appendix b proves that each pair of matrices @xmath8 in @xmath22 holds this property . )",
    "the assumption ( h1 ) given in the next subsection is exactly the same version of the second property in our finitely dimensional setting .",
    "about ( h1 ) , two facts are given in order : first , for a pair @xmath8 in the finitely dimensional setting , it may happen that the above - mentioned second property holds but @xmath8 is not controllable .",
    "second , even in the infinitely dimensional setting , the null controllability of @xmath8 implies that the above - mentioned second property ( see proposition  [ wgswgslemma2.15 ] ) .",
