    "planets are formed in a disk around a star called a protoplanetary disk , which is composed of gas and dust .",
    "terrestrial planets are formed mainly from the dust component .",
    "their formation process can be divided into three stages .",
    "the first stage is the formation of a large number of kilometer sized bodies called planetesimals by accretion among dust particles ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the second stage ,",
    "these planetesimals collide to produce a few tens of mars - sized objects called protoplanets ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the final stage is the formation of terrestrial planets from protoplanets ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the collisions among protoplanets are referred to as giant impacts , and thus this final stage is known as the giant impact stage .",
    "giant impacts have a large influence on the various features such as the number of terrestrial planets formed , their mass and spin state ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "giant impacts are highly energetic events , and are responsible for the creation of large satellites , like the moon ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and planets with extremely large cores such as mercury ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "moreover , giant impacts are closely related to the thermal state such as a magma ocean ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the origins of the terrestrial planet atmospheres @xcite .    a large number of simulations of giant impacts have been devoted to the specific giant impact events related to the origin of the moon or mercury .",
    "however , since it is recently believed that multiple giant impacts are common during the last stage of terrestrial planet formation , several studies @xcite have investigated the giant impact simulations under various impact parameters .",
    "@xcite were the first to show that collisions of protoplanets during the giant impact stage are not always merging events , that is , two colliding protoplanets sometimes move apart after the collision .",
    "they called such a collision a hit - and - run collision . except for @xcite , all the previous studies on the orbital and accretional evolution of protoplanets during the giant impact stage have been based on the assumption of perfect accretion , where two colliding protoplanets always merge .",
    "however , the hit - and - run collisions demonstrated by @xcite may have an important influence on many of the physical characteristics of terrestrial planets .    in order to investigate the effects of such imperfect accretion of protoplanets on terrestrial planet formation",
    ", the merging criteria during protoplanet collisions must be clarified .",
    "@xcite performed 48 simulations of the collisions between same - sized protoplanets with masses of @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the earth mass .",
    "they found that hit - and - run collisions occurred when @xmath9 for @xmath10 , and @xmath11 for @xmath12 or @xmath13 , where @xmath3 is the impact velocity , @xmath6 is the two - body escape velocity ( equation [ [ eq : esc ] ] ) , and @xmath2 is the impact angle . since they varied @xmath3 in steps of @xmath14 for low - velocity collisions , the transition between the merging and hit - and - run collisions was estimated to be @xmath15 for @xmath10 , and @xmath16 for @xmath12 or @xmath13 .",
    "subsequently , @xcite investigated collisions between different - sized protoplanets with mass ratios of 1:2 and 1:10 .",
    "their results were presented in @xcite .",
    "the transition was able to be estimated as follows . in the case of a 1:2 mass ratio ,",
    "the transition occurs at @xmath15 for @xmath10 and @xmath16 for @xmath12 or @xmath13 , whereas in a case of 1:10 mass ratio , @xmath17 for @xmath10 , @xmath18 for @xmath12 , and @xmath19 for @xmath20 .",
    "@xcite and @xcite investigated collisions of the rocky and icy super - earths ( up to @xmath21 ) , respectively .",
    "they focused on the stripping of the rocky or icy mantle resulting from a high - velocity impact .",
    "although they did not perform the various simulations with low - impact velocities , we were able to find that the transition occurs at roughly @xmath22 from their figures .",
    "as described above , the merging criteria has already been roughly determined for certain discrete values of the impact parameters . however , in order to carry out n - body orbital calculations with the merging criteria for the giant impact stage , a simple formula describing the dependence of the merging criteria on the impact parameters is required .",
    "to achieve this , it is necessary to determine the merging criteria over a wide range of impact parameters . in the present study",
    ", we performed more than 1000 simulations of giant impacts for various impact parameter sets using the smoothed particle hydrodynamic ( sph ) method in order to formulate the merging criteria .    in section [ sec : method ] , we present the sph code and initial conditions used in our giant impact simulations . in section [ sec :",
    "outcomes ] , we show the collision outcomes , and investigate the transition between merging and hit - and - run collisions .",
    "we also perform a resolution test on the simulations . in section [ sec : criteria ] , we derive the merging criteria as a function of the impact parameters , and compare the results with those of previous studies . using the derived criteria , we then discuss the merging probability of protoplanets during the giant impact stage in section [ sec : probability ] .",
    "in order to perform impact simulations for protoplanets , we used the sph method ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , which is a flexible lagrangian method of solving hydrodynamic equations , and has been widely used in previous giant impact simulations .",
    "the sph method can easily deal with large deformations and shock waves .",
    "our numerical code is based on @xcite ; here , we briefly describe its essential points .",
    "the equation of the motion for the _ i_-th sph particle is given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the velocity of the _ i_-th sph particle , @xmath25 is the time , and @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the pressure gradient and mutual gravity terms between the _ i_-th and _ j_-th particles , respectively .",
    "several forms have been used for the pressure gradient term , none of which appear to be clearly superior to the others . in this paper , we use the following symmetric expression , @xmath28 where @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 are the mass , pressure , and density of the _ j_-th particle , respectively , @xmath32 is the artificial viscosity , @xmath33 is the kernel function , @xmath34 is the distance between the _ i_-th and _ j_-th particles , and @xmath35 is the average smoothing length of the _ i_-th and _ j_-th particles . for the artificial viscosity @xmath32 , we use a von neumann - richtmyer - type viscosity with parameters of @xmath36 and @xmath37 , as described in @xcite . for the kernel function @xmath33",
    ", we use the spherically symmetric spline kernel function proposed by @xcite : @xmath38 this function satisfies @xmath39 , and has a zero value when @xmath40 . in our code",
    ", @xmath41 is variable for each particle and with time , and determined to satisfy the condition that the number of neighboring particles ( @xmath42 ) within @xmath43 is almost constant , @xmath44 .",
    "we used a maximum value of the smoothing length ( @xmath45 ) to save computational cost when searching for neighboring particles and calculating the pressure gradient term .",
    "the value of @xmath45 is determined from @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the minimum density , which is set to @xmath48 in our simulations .    the mutual gravity term in equation ( [ eq : sph_eom ] )",
    "can be written as @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the gravitational constant , and @xmath51 is the effective mass of the _ j_-th particle toward the _",
    "i_-th particle defined by @xmath52 this equation gives @xmath53 when @xmath54 .    the mutual gravity term between all sph particles",
    "was directly computed using a special - purpose computer for gravitational n - body systems named grape-6a @xcite .",
    "the grape-6a can search for and produce lists of neighboring particles while simultaneously calculating their mutual gravity .",
    "this list of neighbors is used to compute the pressure gradient term in the equation of motion and the time derivative of the internal energy . in a simulation over a period of @xmath55 sec with 20,000 sph particles ,",
    "the typical cpu time was about 4 hours .",
    "thus , the grape-6a allowed us to systematically explore a wide range of impact parameters .",
    "time integration was performed using a pec ( predict , evaluate , and correct ) scheme with variable time steps ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which is second - order accurate in time .      here",
    "we describe the modeling method for the pre - impact protoplanets .",
    "all the protoplanets are assumed to be differentiated , with a 30% iron core and 70% silicate mantle by mass . in our sph simulations",
    ", we used the tillotson equation of state @xcite , which has been widely applied to giant impact simulations involving shock waves ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the tillotson equation of state contains ten material parameters , and the pressure is expressed as a function of the density and the specific internal energy , which is convenient for treating fluid dynamics .",
    "we used the parameter sets of granite for the silicate mantle and iron for the iron core , which are listed on page 234 of @xcite .",
    "all sph particles in the protoplanets was set to have the same mass , and the total number of particles used for impact simulations was fixed at 20,000 .",
    "for example , in the case of a collision of protoplanets with a mass ratio of 1:9 , the smaller protoplanet consisted of 2,000 particles , and the larger one 18,000 particles . to model the pre - impact protoplanets",
    ", we placed the sph particles in a 3d lattice ( face - centered cubic ) with iron particles on the inside , and rocky particles outside .",
    "the internal energy of the sph particles was set to @xmath56 j / kg .",
    "beginning with this configuration , we calculated vibrations of the protoplanet until the particle velocities become slower than 100 m / s , which is much less than the impact velocity ( order of km / s ) .",
    "after this operation , we used these relaxed objects as the protoplanets for impact simulation .",
    "as a first step , the protoplanets were assumed to have no spin .    in order to set impact parameters such as the impact velocity ( @xmath3 ) and impact angle ( @xmath2 ) , we need to determine the radius of the pre - impact protoplanets . since the surface boundary of the protoplanets described by the sph particles is obscure owing to the smoothing length ( @xmath41 ) , we determined the radius of the pre - impact protoplanet ( @xmath57 ) by the following equation .",
    "@xmath58      we prepared more than 1000 sets of initial conditions for the giant impact simulations .",
    "the parameters used were the mass ratio of the protoplanets ( @xmath59 , where @xmath60 and @xmath61 are the mass of the target and impactor , respectively ) , the total mass of the two protoplanets ( @xmath62 ) , the impact angle ( @xmath2 ) , and the impact velocity ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "we systematically varied the mass ratio as @xmath63 1 , 2/3 , 1/2 , 1/3 , 1/4 , 1/6 , and 1/9 . for @xmath63 1 , 1/4 , and 1/9 , we considered three different values of @xmath1 . in total",
    ", we used 13 different combinations for the two colliding protoplanets ( see table  [ mass ] ) . for each mass combination",
    ", we varied the impact angle in the range @xmath64 in @xmath65 steps , and the impact velocity in the range @xmath66 in @xmath67 steps , where @xmath6 is the two - body escape velocity defined as @xmath68 where @xmath69 and @xmath70 are the radius of the target ( larger protoplanet ) and the impactor ( smaller protoplanet ) , respectively .",
    "to precisely determine the transition between merging and hit - and - run collisions , we varied @xmath3 with a smaller step size of 0.02 @xmath6 near the transition . in total , we performed more than 1000 runs , consisting of 13 ( mass combinations ) @xmath71 6 ( angles ) @xmath71 16 ( 11 runs with 0.2@xmath6 steps and @xmath72 5 runs with 0.02@xmath6 steps ) .",
    "the impact parameters @xmath3 and @xmath2 are defined when the two protoplanets are in contact with each other ( see figure [ fig : impact_angle ] ) .",
    "we assumed that the two protoplanets are mass points , and calculated backward the positions of two mass points until their distance was apart at a distance of 3 ( @xmath70+@xmath69 ) .",
    "then , we performed the giant impact simulations over a period of @xmath55 sec .",
    "the outcomes of the collisions between the protoplanets are divided into two types : merging and hit - and - run collisions . according to the previous studies @xcite ,",
    "the collision outcomes are subdivided into several regimes ( e.g. , partial accretion , fragmentation and so on ) . however , we classify collision outcomes into only two regimes of merging and hit - and - run collisions , because it is the most essential to the evolution of protoplanets during the giant impact stage that only one big body is left after the giant impact ( i.e. , merging collision ) or two big bodies are left ( i.e. , hit - and - run collision ) . additionally , we need to classify collision outcomes as simply as possible , in order to incorporate those into _ n_-body simulation .",
    "figure [ fig : snapshots ] shows snapshots of two typical collisions . panels ( a ) to ( h ) in figure [ fig : snapshots ] show the time sequence for a relatively low - velocity collision ( @xmath73 ) of same - sized protoplanets ( @xmath74 ) with @xmath10 .",
    "after the first contact , the protoplanets become separated ( see panel ( e ) ) , but remain gravitationally bound .",
    "although some amount of mantle material is ejected , almost all parts of the colliding protoplanets finally merge .",
    "we refer to this type of collision as `` a merging collision '' . on the other hand",
    ", a relatively high - velocity collision leads to a completely different result .",
    "panels ( i ) to ( l ) show the time sequence of a collision with @xmath75 .",
    "the impact angle and protoplanet masses are the same as in panels ( a ) to ( h ) .",
    "after the first contact , the protoplanets escape from each other and are no longer gravitationally bound .",
    "we refer to this type of collision as `` a hit - and - run collision '' . by examining snapshots at @xmath76",
    ", we could easily classify almost all the simulations performed in this study as either merging or hit - and - run collisions .",
    "however , in some cases , the protoplanets were separated but still gravitationally bound at @xmath77 . since those protoplanets are expected to eventually merge , we classified such a case as a merging collision .      here , we consider the mass of the protoplanet after the collision . we briefly describe the method to determine the mass of the gravitationally bound objects from the sph particle data after @xmath77 . in the first step ,",
    "we roughly identify clumps of sph particles using a friends - of - friends algorithm ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we then iteratively check whether or not any sph particles not belonging to clumps are gravitationally bound to clumps . finally , we iteratively identify pairs of clumps that are gravitationally bound .",
    "such clumps should merge after @xmath77 , and we can thus regard them as a single object .",
    "we define the mass of the largest object as @xmath78 and the second largest object as @xmath79 .    figure [ fig : result_1vs1_30deg ] shows the mass of the largest object normalized by the total mass , @xmath80 , as a function of the impact velocity normalized by the escape velocity , @xmath81 , for collisions of same - sized protoplanets with @xmath10 .",
    "this figure also shows the numerical results of @xcite for collisions of same - sized protoplanets with @xmath7 , which are in good agreement with our results for total mass @xmath82 of @xmath83 .",
    "we also performed simulations for @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "as seen in figure [ fig : result_1vs1_30deg ] , @xmath80 does not depend on the total mass , when the normalized impact velocity , @xmath81 , is considered .",
    "the insensitivity to the total mass holds true to collisions between protoplanets , which has been predicted by @xcite .",
    "if the material properties such as strength dominates over gravity ( typically collision between smaller bodies with less than 1 km in radius ) , the collision outcomes would depend on the total mass @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : result_1vs1_30deg ] indicates that @xmath80 changes sharply around @xmath86 .",
    "collisions at impact velocities less than this velocity result in almost perfect accretion ( i.e. , @xmath87 ) , and thus are classified as merging collisions . for the case of a near head - on collision ( @xmath88 )",
    ", @xmath80 gradually decreases with the increase of @xmath3 .",
    "although such a collision should be classified as a partial accretion collision or a fragmentation collision according to @xcite and @xcite , we here classify those as a merging collision because only one large body remains after the collision .",
    "since the probability of a near head - on collision with high velocity is quite low during the giant impact stage , our treatment would not become a serious problem .",
    "on the other hand , figure [ fig : result_1vs1_30deg ] indicates that the collisions at impact velocities higher than @xmath86 result in @xmath89 .",
    "some amount of material become stripped from the protoplanets , and the protoplanets escape from each other .",
    "these collisions are classified as hit - and - run collisions .",
    "we refer to the impact velocity at the transition between merging and hit - and - run collisions as the critical impact velocity , @xmath4 .",
    "the normalized critical impact velocity , @xmath5 , is not strongly dependent on the total mass , @xmath1 .",
    "we obtain @xmath5 = @xmath90 , @xmath91 , and @xmath91 for @xmath92 and @xmath85 , respectively .",
    "the critical impact velocity is expected to depend on the impact angle .",
    "figure [ fig : result_1vs1_60deg ] is similar to figure [ fig : result_1vs1_30deg ] , but for the collisions with @xmath93 .",
    "as is the same in the case of @xmath10 , @xmath80 for @xmath93 does not depend on the total mass .",
    "however , collisions with @xmath93 result in lower @xmath5 values than the @xmath10 case .",
    "the calculated values are @xmath5 = @xmath94 , @xmath95 , and @xmath95 for @xmath92 and @xmath85 , respectively .",
    "this result implies that collisions at higher impact angles are more like to be hit - and - run collisions .    the critical impact velocity is also expected to depend on the mass ratio of the protoplanets ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "figure [ fig : result_1vs4_30deg ] shows the results for @xmath96 ( mass ratio of 1:4 ) and @xmath10 .",
    "it can be seen that in this case also , @xmath80 does not depend on the total mass .",
    "this has also been verified for @xmath97 ( mass ratio of 1:9 ) , although the results are not shown here .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : result_1vs4_30deg ] , @xmath80 changes sharply around @xmath98 .",
    "the normalized critical impact velocities are @xmath5 = @xmath99 , @xmath100 , and @xmath100 for @xmath101 and @xmath102 , respectively , which are larger than for the case of collisions between same - sized protoplanets .",
    "in addition to the impact simulations with 20,000 sph particles ( standard case ) , we performed simulations with 3,000 ( low - resolution case ) , 60,000 and 100,000 particles ( high - resolution cases ) for certain impact parameters in order to check the dependence of convergence on particle number .",
    "although we found that the critical impact velocity for the low - resolution case was slightly different from that for the standard case , the high - resolution cases yielded the same results .",
    "for example , for @xmath103 , @xmath104 , and @xmath105 , we obtained @xmath106 for both the standard and high - resolution cases . therefore , using 20,000 sph particles is enough for determining the critical impact velocity .    in subsection",
    "[ sec : pre - impact ] , the initial internal energy of the sph particles was set to @xmath56 j / kg . to investigate the effect of the initial thermal state of the protoplanets",
    ", we prepared pre - impact protoplanets with an internal energies of @xmath107 ( cold - state case ) and @xmath108 j / kg ( hot - state case ) .",
    "we then performed simulations of collisions between same - sized protoplanets with impact parameters near the transition between merging and hit - and - run collisions .",
    "we found that although the results for the very low - impact angle case ( @xmath109 ) showed a very slight dependence on the initial thermal state , for all other cases no such dependence was observed .",

    "[ fig : cr_data ] , we plot the average of these three results .",
    "the critical impact velocities estimated by @xcite and @xcite are also plotted in figure [ fig : cr_data ] .",

    "for a mass ratio of 1:2 , we obtained @xmath118 for @xmath10 , @xmath114 for @xmath12 , and @xmath95 for @xmath20 , and these values are in good agreement with those of @xcite .",
    "although we did not perform simulations for a mass ratio of 1:10 , our data points for 1:9 ( @xmath97 ) seem to fall within the range obtained by @xcite .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : cr_data ] , @xmath5 increases with decreasing impact angle or mass ratio , which means that collisions with low impact angles or low mass ratios tend to be merging events .",
    "this can be explained in terms of the size of the overlapping volume of the colliding protoplanets . since this is geometrically smaller for higher impact angle , the fraction of kinetic energy converted to thermal energy of protoplanets and kinetic energy of the fragments is small , resulting in a hit - and - run collision .",
    "in addition , in the case of a small impactor ( i.e. , small @xmath0 ) , most of the volume of the impactor tends to overlap with the target .",
    "therefore , the impactor can not easily be ejected , which leads to be a merging collision .    in the following ,",
    "we consider a simple physical model in order to express the critical impact velocity as a function of the impact angle and mass ratio . for two spheres with radii @xmath69 and @xmath70 colliding with an impact angle @xmath2 ( see figure [ fig : simple_model ] ) , the mass fractions of the overlapping volumes for the target and impactor ( @xmath119 and @xmath120 , respectively )",
    "are geometrically given by @xmath121 @xmath122 where @xmath123 and @xmath124 are the masses of the overlapping volumes for the target and impactor , respectively .",
    "a constant density is assumed for simplicity .    as illustrated in figure [ fig :",
    "simple_model ] , we divide the spheres into overlapping parts and non - overlapping parts , and consider the momentum exchange between the overlapping parts",
    ". using the parameter of the degree of the momentum exchange ( @xmath125 ) , the post impact velocities of the overlapping parts ( @xmath126 and @xmath127 ) are expressed as @xmath128 where @xmath129 is the velocity of the center of mass of the overlapping parts , and is written as @xmath130 for example , when @xmath131 , the velocities of the overlapping parts ( @xmath126 and @xmath127 ) become @xmath129 owing to the complete momentum exchange .",

    "( [ eq : overlap_post_velocity ] ) - ( [ eq : post_mass_cons ] ) gives @xmath135 if the relative velocity of post - impact objects is higher than the two - body escape velocity , a hit - and - run collision should occur .",

    "we could roughly reproduce the dependence of @xmath5 on @xmath2 and @xmath0 , but detail features , especially the case for the low - impact angle and low - mass ratio , could not be reproduced .",
    "for such a collision , the role of fragmentation that has not been considered here may become important .",
    "it should be also noted that @xmath139 would not be applied to collisions other than giant impacts between rocky protoplanets .",
    "in addition to the above physical model , we tried to mathematically fit the numerical data for the critical impact velocity .",
    "of the many possibilities available , we found that the following simple formula with five fitting parameters , @xmath140 to @xmath141 , was most effective , @xmath142 where @xmath143 , and @xmath144 .",

    "they found that some basic properties such as the final number , mass , orbital elements , and growth timescale of planets did not change very much , but the spin angular velocity of the fully formed planets was about 30@xmath150 smaller than that for the perfect accretion model .",
    "they also determined that 49% of all impact events were hit - and - run collisions , which is also consistent with our estimate .    in this paper",

    "using our simulation data for more than 1000 collisional events , we can estimate the change in the core - mantle ratio during the giant impact stage .",
    "this is highly relevant to the formation of mercury , and the formation probability of such planets with very large cores will be investigated .",
