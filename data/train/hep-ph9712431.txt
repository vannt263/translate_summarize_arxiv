    "effective chiral field theories in terms of a unitary matrix field @xmath6 are considered as appropriate tool for the study of hadronic physics at very low energies  @xcite .",
    "the chiral field @xmath7 comprises the lowest pseudoscalar meson multiplet for @xmath8 flavors as goldstone bosons of the spontaneously broken chiral symmetry of qcd .",
    "a most attractive feature of these models is the possibility to identify baryon number @xmath9 with the winding number  @xcite [ b ] b= ^i j k tr l_i",
    "l_j l_k d^3x ,  l_i = u^_i u , that characterizes the map of compactified coordinate space onto the @xmath10 manifold of the chiral fields .",
    "this concept has a profound basis  @xcite in the anomaly structure of underlying qcd , and it has found many successful applications as efficient description for meson - baryon systems without explicit use of fermion fields . specifically , for @xmath11 flavors , it is the nontriviality of the third homotopy group @xmath12 which allows for the existence of baryons as topological defects in the chiral pion field .    it is expected that with increasing temperature the spontaneously broken chiral symmetry gets restored , such that beyond a critical temperature the chiral condensate vanishes and the goldstone bosons acquire dynamical mass .",
    "numerous examples in condensed matter systems  @xcite show the decisive role of topological defects for the dynamics of phase transitions if spatial and internal dimensions allow for nontrivial homotopy groups . for the cooling process of hot hadronic matter",
    "the topological arguments have been used @xcite to obtain estimates for the baryon - antibaryon yield along the lines of the kibble  @xcite mechanism .    on the other hand",
    ", it is expected that near and above the critical temperature @xmath13 it may be important to allow for additional degrees of freedom .",
    "apart from vector mesons it appears natural to include ( for @xmath11 ) the scalar partner of the pseudoscalar pions into a common chiral field @xmath14 , and to relax the constraint to the @xmath15 3-sphere @xmath16 .",
    "thus the @xmath17-symmetric nonlinear @xmath18 model is replaced by the @xmath1-symmetric linear @xmath18-model  @xcite , where the fields @xmath19 can freely explore the full 4-dimensional chiral space .",
    "this allows for a very convenient description of chiral symmetry restoration at finite temperatures  @xcite , to study critical fluctuations of the chiral condensate near the phase transition , or to follow the dynamical formation of the condensate after a quench .",
    "it has been suggested that the exponential growth of collective amplitudes in the dynamical evolution of chiral field configurations after a quench may lead to disoriented chiral condensates in macroscopic regions of space  @xcite -@xcite .",
    "these considerations have been based  @xcite -@xcite on calculations within the framework of the @xmath1 model  @xcite with chiral fields embedded in the simply connected @xmath0 internal space .",
    "unfortunately , with the unconstrained embedding of the chiral field @xmath20 into a simple @xmath0 manifold the concept of baryon number @xmath9 as winding index of topological defects is lost because the topological connectedness of this manifold is trivial . of course ,",
    "also in this embedding we may find nontrivial defect solutions which correspond to local minima in the energy hypersurface .",
    "although they may be separated from the vacuum configuration @xmath21 by a potential barrier which prevents their decay within classical dynamics , they no longer are topologically protected against decay into mesonic fluctuations .",
    "cohen  @xcite has argued that the corresponding quantum mechanical tunneling amplitude vanishes in tree approximation in the limit where the number of colors @xmath22 . but a possible suppression for finite @xmath23 through quantum corrections to our knowledge has never been proven . by suitable changes in the parameters of the model ( e.g. by increasing the temperature )",
    "the decay process becomes even classically allowed .",
    "of course , we can not have baryon number violated just by increasing the temperature .",
    "apparently , we have to conclude that within the linear @xmath18-model it makes no sense to identify winding number with baryon number .",
    "that conclusion , however , is quite unsatisfactory : it would imply that we have lost a fundamental symmetry of qcd in a model which we consider the appropriate tool for the study of hadronic physics near @xmath2 .",
    "we would naturally expect that in cooling a hot hadronic plasma baryon - antibaryon production rates depend crucially on respecting this symmetry .    to avoid the above conclusion it would be desirable to combine the attractive features of the @xmath1 model with the topological advantage of the nonlinear @xmath18-model .",
    "the decisive feature is the angular nature of the chiral field .",
    "it is well known ( see e.g. the discussion in  @xcite ) that to specify an action in the continuum limit is not sufficient to fully specify a model .",
    "additionally , the nature of the variables ( continuous or periodic ) must be specified on physical grounds . in our case",
    "it is baryon number conservation which therefore requires embedding the linear @xmath18-model into the @xmath24 manifold as natural extension of the nonlinear @xmath18-model , in contrast to the commonly used @xmath0 embedding .",
    "this means to insist on the angular nature of the chiral fields , i.e. on the factorization [ phi ] = r(,t ) u(,t ) ,  ( u su(2 ) ) . where the unitary part @xmath7 as usual is parametrized by three chiral angles @xmath25,@xmath26,@xmath27 [ abc ] u=(i ) ,  = ( , , ) .",
    "this generates a discrete set of different continuous manifolds of angles @xmath28 which all describe the vacuum configuration @xmath29 which the field must approach at spatial infinity @xmath30 .",
    "they constitute distinct sets of boundary conditions for field configurations with finite energy and definite winding number .",
    "( in the plain @xmath0 embedding it is not possible to distinguish these different boundary conditions ) . as long as one of those boundary conditions",
    "is held fixed during the time evolution , the winding number as defined in ( [ b ] ) is conserved while the field @xmath20 can explore the manifold @xmath24 without any further constraint .",
    "thus identification of @xmath9 with baryon number is meaningful .    whenever a field configuration @xmath31 ( which we shall briefly call a trajectory ) at some point in space and time acquires the value @xmath32 , i.e. if a trajectory moves across the origin @xmath33 , the angular fields will jump by multiples of @xmath34 . with boundary conditions on the angular fields fixed during the time evolution , this can not happen , therefore trajectories will not be able to move across the origin and curled - up configurations will not be able to unwind by crossing the origin .",
    "it is , however , not necessary to enforce this by a constraint on @xmath35 , or by a singularity of the potential at the origin .",
    "it is enforced by the boundary conditions on the angular fields alone and reflects the fact that in the @xmath24 manifold the origin @xmath33 as a highly singular branching point is excluded .",
    "one may ask how this will affect the time evolution of trajectories which move according to the standard action of the @xmath1 model .",
    "ideally , without any damping mechanism , continuous trajectories moving across the origin will develop hairpin slings which tie them to the origin and serve to satisfy the angular boundary conditions , but do not otherwise affect the motion of the trajectories . in a real cooling process , however , all fluctuations are subject to dissipative damping which will be especially efficient for the high fourier components of the slings . as a result , different embeddings will lead to different final configurations , irrespective of the precise nature of the dissipative mechanism .    due to their topological equivalence",
    "the 1 + 1 dimensional @xmath36 model can serve as a transparent illustration for the effects we may expect in the 3 + 1 dimensional @xmath1 model . in the following sections we discuss some typical aspects : in sect.ii we compare in",
    "angular and cartesian embedding the motion across the origin for very simple trajectories without and with potential ; in sect.iii we determine the classical stable configurations and we show how the angular boundary conditions stabilize nontrivial solutions which collapse in the usual @xmath5 embedding to a point ; finally , in sect.iv , we follow the time evolution of random initial configurations after a quench .",
    "for the case of the 1 + 1 dimensional @xmath36 model the two different embeddings are easily visualized : in the usual @xmath5 embedding the two - component chiral field @xmath37 lives on the @xmath5 plane spanned by cartesian components @xmath38 . the origin is naturally included without any singularity .",
    "the angular @xmath39 embedding in radial and angular variables ( @xmath40 ) [ sigpi ] ( x , t)=r(x , t)(x , t ) ,  ( x , t)=r(x , t)(x , t ) creates a manifold which consists of multiple sheets tied together at the origin @xmath41 as branching point , like the riemann sheets of the complex plane .",
    "this is illustrated in fig.1 which schematically shows the @xmath5 plane and the @xmath39 manifold with the different sheets pulled apart in vertical direction .",
    "imagine a path embedded in the @xmath39 manifold connecting two points which differ in @xmath42 by @xmath43 .",
    "its projection into the @xmath5 plane is a closed loop which can be contracted to a point .",
    "but , evidently , with the endpoints fixed , the path on the angular manifold can not be pulled across the origin and thus can not be reduced to a point .",
    "specifically , let the discrete manifold [ nvac ] r = f _ ,  = n 2 , ( @xmath44 integer ) represent an infinite set of distinct degenerate vacua .",
    "choosing for a trajectory @xmath45 fixed boundary conditions @xmath46 fixes the net winding number @xmath9 [ bnum ] b=_-^ ( x , t ) dx = n_+-n_- , so that identification of @xmath9 with conserved baryon number is possible .    on the other hand , in the cartesian @xmath5 embedding all field configurations with boundary conditions [ bcsig ] ( -,t)=(+,t)=f _",
    ",   ( -,t)=(+,t)=0 , represent closed loops in the @xmath18-@xmath34 plane which can be contracted continuously into the unique vacuum configuration @xmath47 and the integral ( [ bnum ] ) changes by one unit whenever the loop is pulled across the origin of the @xmath18-@xmath34 plane .    as a most simple example",
    "let us consider the time evolution of a circular string moving to the right with a constant initial velocity across the origin in the absence of any potential .",
    "so the underlying lagrangian density simply is [ l0 ] l_0 ( ) = _ ^. in cartesian form the equations of motion are and @xmath48 denote dimensionless spacetime variables .",
    "where numbers are given , space and time are measured in units of the inverse physical pion decay constant of 93 mev . ] [ xy ] =  - ,   =  - with boundary conditions @xmath49 , and in angular form [ rs ] = r  - r(^2-^2 ) - ,   =  + ( r- ) - with boundary conditions @xmath50 . in both sets of differential equations the same dissipative terms ( linear in the first time - derivatives )",
    "have been added to smoothen fluctuations which build up in the angular parametrization .",
    "the effect of the dissipative terms can be seen in both cases as slowing down the translational motion .",
    "figures 2a , b show the same ten consecutive equal time steps in a numerical evolution in the @xmath18-@xmath34 plane ( a ) and in the @xmath51-@xmath42 manifold ( b ) .",
    "evidently , as consequence of the topological constraint in case ( b ) the circular trajectory after crossing the origin drags behind it a tail of fluctuations , their precise form depending on mesh and damping details .",
    "adding now to @xmath52 the standard bell - shape potential [ pot ] v ( ) = ( ^2 - f_^2)^2 we may again in the two different manifolds follow the time evolution of the same circular trajectory ( initial radius @xmath53 with constant initial velocity in positive @xmath18 direction ) on the way to its final configuration located at the bottom of the well @xmath54 .",
    "up to the point where the trajectory meets the origin both evolutions are identical .",
    "while the left part of the circle is slowing down as it moves up towards the center top of the potential , the right half is rapidly accelerated downhill towards the bottom of the well .",
    "( fig.3a shows the timesteps @xmath48=0 , 0.5 , 1.5 , 2.5 ) . in the @xmath18-@xmath34 evolution",
    "the left part then freely moves across the origin and follows the right half downhill into the same section of the bottom circle .",
    "( fig.3b shows the timesteps @xmath48=2.4 , 4.8 , 7.2 ) .",
    "in contrast to this , the @xmath51-@xmath42 evolution is held up at the origin and then slowly accelerated downhill on the left side of the well ( fig.3c shows the same timesteps as fig.3b ) .",
    "fig.3d shows both trajectories at time @xmath55 , where the right halfs both have settled at the bottom @xmath54 , the left part of the @xmath18-@xmath34 trajectory is approaching the bottom on the same side , while the left part of the @xmath51-@xmath42 trajectory is still moving downhill to complete after a few further timesteps the full circle which conserves the winding number of the initial @xmath48=0 configuration . evidently , we can have with identical dynamics a dramatic difference of the evolutions in the different manifolds .",
    "of course this only happens if the initial velocity is sufficient for the trajectory to overcome the center top of the potential . for smaller velocities both trajectories will evolve identically and both conserve winding number .",
    "the defects which carry winding number are not necessarily stable static configurations . therefore , if their winding number is not topologically protected unstable defects will unwind and disappear . on the other hand",
    ", unstable topological defects will degenerate into spatially isolated singularities .",
    "it is therefore natural to expect that the stabilization mechanism of solitonic configurations will play an essential role for the evolution of trajectories .    in the 3 + 1-dimensional",
    "@xmath1-model soliton stabilization requires terms of higher chiral order , like the fourth - order skyrme term  @xcite .",
    "the spatial extent of the angular chiral soliton profile scales as @xmath56 where the skyrme parameter @xmath57 remains essentially unchanged with increasing temperature .",
    "the angular winding length @xmath58 as the characteristic length scale for stable field configurations then increases with increasing temperature . the radial bag with increasing @xmath59 gets very shallow , i.e. @xmath60 stays very close to @xmath61 as @xmath61 approaches zero with increasing temperature .",
    "so the static soliton dissolves together with restoration of chiral symmetry .",
    "but the baryon number defined through the choice of boundary condition in the @xmath24 embedding continues to be carried by the hot chiral gas even if the soliton has dissolved into chiral fluctuations around the vanishing mean value of the condensate .",
    "it is nice to observe that also in the @xmath36 model there is a simple way to destabilize static solitons and thus to choose any desired angular winding length .",
    "but unlike in the @xmath1 case , here the mechanism is tied to explicit breaking of the @xmath36 symmetry . evidently , the static configuration [ static ] r = f _ ,   = b(1+x / l ) , ( @xmath62 is the size of the spatial box ) which rests at the bottom of the well and winds @xmath9 times around the center , is stable for unbroken symmetry .",
    "it is also evident , that if we add a symmetry - breaking term @xmath63 to the potential [ brokpot ] v ( ) = ( ^2 - f^2)^2 - h .",
    "there will be a maximal value of @xmath64 which characterizes the onset of instability of static configurations with nonvanishing winding number . in order to keep the minimum of @xmath65 for finite @xmath64 at @xmath66 we define f^2 = f^2_- .",
    "the stable solitons correspond to bound trajectories of a classical point particle moving in the potential @xmath67 , starting from the maximum of @xmath67 and returning to it after an infinite time .",
    "these configurations sling around the hat of the potential @xmath65 close to ( but inside of ) the bottom of the valley . balancing centrifugal forces and potential gradient for such a classical particle",
    "provides the limiting value of @xmath64 : stable solitons exist , as long as the inequality [ ineq ] < 0.047 is satisfied . in terms of @xmath18- and @xmath34-masses [ masses ] m_^2= ,  m_^2=2 f_^2 + m_^2 we find from ( [ ineq ] ) approximately @xmath68 , as stability condition .",
    "the angular winding length @xmath69 ( i.e. the inverse of the gradient of the angular field near the center of the soliton ) defines the typical spatial extent of the stable soliton . in the symmetry limit",
    "@xmath70 @xmath71 approaches @xmath72 , so in this limit the soliton completely occupies the spatial box of length @xmath62 . with increasing @xmath59",
    "the radial bag @xmath73 gets very shallow , i.e. @xmath73 stays very close to @xmath61 .",
    "suppose that @xmath64 , @xmath74 and @xmath61 satisfy condition ( [ ineq ] ) for @xmath75 and suppose we have a baryon represented by a stable trajectory with @xmath76 . with increasing temperature @xmath77 , the inclusion of loop corrections into a renormalized @xmath78 will lead to a decrease in @xmath79 while the coupling constant @xmath74 and @xmath64 remain unrenormalized .",
    "this causes the soliton radius to decrease . at a certain temperature",
    "the value of @xmath80 will exceed the critical stabilizing value ( [ ineq ] ) , and in an @xmath5 embedding the sling will collapse to the vacuum point @xmath81 , and the baryon has disappeared .    if we repeat these considerations in the @xmath82 embedding starting with a stable trajectory at @xmath75 with boundary conditions @xmath83 , increase the temperature , then at the critical value ( [ ineq ] ) for @xmath84 the sling will now collapse to a narrow hairpin around the origin which connects the vacua ( [ nvac ] ) with @xmath85 and @xmath86 , @xmath87 . the radial field , however , still obeys a nonlinear equation [ radeq ] r-r ( r^2-f^2)+h=0 with nontrivial solutions satisfying [ hairpin ] r(|x|0 ) + 0 ,  r(x ) f_-ae^-m_|x| . which represent the bag profile of the remaining baryon with @xmath76 .",
    "although its angular winding length @xmath59 has shrunk to zero , the radial bag still has a nonzero radius in coordinate space which increases with temperature as long as the @xmath18-mass decreases ( in this particular stabilization mechanism which is peculiar to 1 space dimension ) . in fig.4 soliton profiles",
    "are shown for two values of @xmath88 above and below the critical value ( [ ineq ] ) .",
    "the stable soliton solutions above critical symmetry breaking do not exist in the @xmath5 embedding of this model .",
    "it is an interesting question to ask whether and how the topological aspects discussed above may affect the time evolution of chiral fields after a quench where an initially hot hadronic gas is rapidly cooled down across the chiral phase transition .",
    "the initial configuration therefore is characterized by an ensemble of randomly curled up trajectories which reflect the unbroken symmetry of the hot chiral gas phase .",
    "the time evolution of each trajectory after the quench then is governed by the equations of motion in the low temperature effective potential . in the commonly used @xmath0 embedding",
    "the initial configurations therefore can be created as random gaussian ensembles centered around the origin @xmath20=0  @xcite . in the angular representation ( [ phi]),([abc ] ) of the chiral fields this would correspond",
    "to uniform deviates in the three chiral angles @xmath89 however , in @xmath90 embedding the chiral angles extend over all values @xmath91 and chiral symmetry requires equal probability for all values .",
    "so with each point of each trajectory all integer multiples of @xmath43 should also be included .",
    "this implies that initial field configurations could curl arbitrarily often back and forth around the origin from one lattice point to the next , with only the net winding number @xmath9 of the configuration inside the whole spatial box of radius @xmath92 fixed . with our interpretation of the jacobian b()=^2 as local baryon density such configurations",
    "apparently should be very much suppressed .    instead , for high values of the temperature @xmath77 the initial ensemble should be such that the correlation function at @xmath93 is characterized by a small correlation length @xmath94 [ corru ]  u^(+,0)u(,0 ) ~e^-|r|/_0 . with dominant individual configurations characterized by a small local baryon density . with @xmath95",
    "such configurations again wind many times back and forth around the origin within the whole spatial box , but most of the phase differences between neighbouring lattice points should be less than @xmath43 ,    starting from such initial configurations , together with a gaussian deviate in @xmath96 around @xmath33 , in @xmath90 embedding the growth of collective motion in radial direction towards the condensate can not proceed ( even for @xmath97 ) through unwinding random multiple twists around the origin by moving the curled - up trajectories across the origin . furthermore , while the evolution of the radial part @xmath60 towards the condensate is driven by the slope of the potential @xmath98 , there is no corresponding driving force to unwind the large amplitude fluctuations in the angles @xmath28 . however , inclusion of dissipative terms will relax also the random angular fluctuations into a quasistable ensemble of @xmath99 solitons and @xmath100 antisolitons ( with @xmath101 ) distributed randomly within the spatial box .",
    "although the configuration then is characterized by a phase correlation length of order @xmath59 it generally will contain many sections winding back and forth around the origin .",
    "whether optimal unwinding ( @xmath102 ) can be achieved depends on the ratio of three different length scales : the initial phase correlation length @xmath103 ( @xmath104 the lattice constant ) , the winding length @xmath59 of stable ( anti)solitons i.e. on the stabilization mechanism , and on the size @xmath92 of the box .",
    "a necessary condition for optimal unwinding is @xmath105 , because otherwise the initial configuration will be close to some quasistable soliton - antisoliton trajectory with comparable large mean square deviations @xmath106 in the chiral angles .",
    "if @xmath107 , the quasistable trajectory can be very different from the initial incoherent fluctuations but still may contain many multiply curled - up sections .",
    "only if @xmath59 is comparable or larger than @xmath108 then no stable soliton - antisoliton configurations fit into the box and the dissipative term can completely unwind all fluctuations .",
    "of course , in all cases the net winding number @xmath9 will be conserved .",
    "because the different length scales change with temperature , the detailed study of the cooling process of the hot pion gas in this extended @xmath24 frame ( as compared to  @xcite ) might provide interesting features of baryon - antibaryon formation .",
    "again it is possible and illustrative to simulate such time evolutions in the @xmath82 @xmath36 model .",
    "as discussed above the initial configurations should reflect the high value of the temperature @xmath77 through a small correlation length @xmath94 characterizing the angular correlation function at @xmath93 [ corr ] e^i(x_0+x,0)e^-i(x_0,0)=e^-^2=e^-|x|/_0 .",
    "this shows that the mean square net winding increases linearly with @xmath109 . on a lattice with lattice constant @xmath110",
    "this corresponds to a random walk with @xmath111 steps with a mean square step size of @xmath112 . identifying @xmath103 with the lattice constant",
    "we obtain suitable initial configurations for the angles @xmath113 by random walks with gaussian deviate for mean square step sizes of order two , and fixed value of total net winding @xmath44 .",
    "if @xmath114 these configurations wind many times back and forth around the origin , but most of the phase differences between neighbouring lattice points are less than @xmath43 , i.e. the local baryon density @xmath115 is small .",
    "the actual value of the total winding number @xmath116 of the configuration apparently is of minor importance for the general features of the evolution : as long as the field curls many times back and forth around the origin , it is not essential at which multiple of @xmath43 it ends .    as an illustration we consider the time evolution of an initial configuration on 128 lattice points in a box @xmath117 ( @xmath118 ) which consists of a gaussian deviate in the radial field @xmath73 around the origin @xmath41 and the angular configuration @xmath71 given by a gaussian random walk which begins at @xmath119 and ends near @xmath120 ( cf .",
    "the linespoints in fig.5 ) . in order to have integer @xmath9 we put @xmath121 and keep both boundary values @xmath122 , @xmath123 fixed for all times @xmath48 . for a comparison with an evolution in @xmath5 embedding",
    "we obtain the corresponding cartesian initial configuration from ( [ sigpi ] ) which then , of course , satisfies @xmath124 . for the sake of our comparison we keep this boundary condition",
    "also fixed during the cartesian evolution .",
    "the time evolution for @xmath125 is governed by the potential ( [ pot ] ) .",
    "( we take @xmath126 mev and @xmath127 ) .",
    "again we add dissipative terms in the equations of motion as in ( [ xy]),([rs ] ) .",
    "so , in angular form we have @xmath128    let us first consider the case of unbroken symmetry , i.e. @xmath129 . as we discussed in the previous section , in this case the slings ( [ static ] ) which rest at the bottom of the well and wind @xmath9 times around the origin are stable classical solutions which finally will be approached by any evolution in time .",
    "the early phase ( @xmath130 ) of each evolution , angular or cartesian , is characterized by a rapid increase in the average radius of the trajectory towards the bottom of the well . during this early phase the cartesian trajectory crosses the origin repeatedly at different points in space and time with corresponding changes in net winding number @xmath9 . in the following ( @xmath131 ) the evolutions",
    "are characterized by smoothing of the rapid random fluctuations .",
    "finally , the remaining long - range variations of the trajectories are slowly reduced until finally the stable slings ( [ static ] ) are approached ( @xmath132 ) .",
    "fig.5 shows for the angular evolution the typical situation ( @xmath133 ) after the second phase : the rapid fluctuations of the ( @xmath93 ) random walk in the angle @xmath134 ( linespoints ) are smoothed away , the resulting smooth curve ( full line ) still follows the average path of the random walk , necessarily always connecting the fixed boundary values and thus conserving the winding number ( @xmath135 in our example ) .",
    "the corresponding trajectories at the same point in time ( @xmath133 ) for both evolutions are compared in figs.6a , b .",
    "the radius of both configurations has settled already at the final limit @xmath136 ( in units of @xmath61 ) , the angle of the angular evolution ( a ) ( as shown in fig.5 ) curls several times back and forth around the origin with net winding @xmath137 .",
    "in contrast to this the trajectory ( b ) of the cartesian evolution has at an early stage of the evolution suffered several changes of winding number and is approaching a final configuration with @xmath138 .",
    "as discussed in the previous section , in this simple 1 + 1 dimensional model we have to break the @xmath36 symmetry explicitly in order to destabilize the static solutions and allow for varying angular winding length @xmath59 of the static solitons . from ( [ ineq ] )",
    "the critical destabilizing value is @xmath139 mev , so for values @xmath140 mev the cartesian evolution rapidly ends at the trivial solution @xmath141 with @xmath97 .",
    "for @xmath142 mev there is a chance for nonvanishing final values of @xmath9 , but they are less likely because already in the very early stage of the cartesian evolution the broken symmetry drags the whole initial configuration across the origin towards the minimum of the potential .",
    "in contrast to this , in the angular evolution @xmath9 is conserved for all values of @xmath88 and the decreasing angular winding length of the soliton solutions allows the evolution to approximate the original random fluctuations by an increasing number of metastable kink and antikink configurations . to demonstrate this effect we compare in figs.7a , b ,",

    "mev the angular field at time @xmath133 has evolved into a @xmath145 kink - antikink configuration shown in fig.7a which firmly rests in a local minimum of the energy hypersurface such that it does not evolve any further .    for @xmath88-values above 154 mev",
    "we ideally expect a sequence of step functions in the angular distribution , while in the radial field the solitons still should have finite spatial extent ( cf.([radeq ] ) ) .",
    "this is shown in figs.7b , c for the angular evolution at time @xmath133 with @xmath146 and @xmath147 mev . again",
    "the resulting configurations rest quasistable in local energy minima . in the numerical evolution due to the finiteness of the grid the kinks in the angle",
    "can not really become step functions and the radial bags do not reach the value of @xmath41 at their center ( cf .",
    "it is natural to expect that also in the continuum limit , when the random walk initial configurations approach continuous differentiable functions the evolution will lead to trajectories which approximate these functions by a series of kinks and antikinks , or step functions ( if the symmetry breaking exceeds the critical value ( [ ineq ] ) ) , with conserved net winding .",
    "their local density will depend on the ratio of their winding length to the size of the box , and on the local gradients of the initial trajectory , i.e. on the initial local baryon density .",
    "in the commonly used @xmath0 embedding of the linear @xmath1 @xmath18 model the angular nature of the chiral field is lost . as a consequence",
    "the winding number is not conserved and therefore no longer can be identified with baryon number , the latter concept being well established in the @xmath148 nonlinear @xmath18 model .    for the early stages in the evolution of a hot hadron gas after a quench from the symmetric phase into the spontaneously symmetry - breaking cold phase this can be of crucial importance , because structures with nontrivial winding number contained in the random initial configurations can trivially unwind in the @xmath0 embedding and thus allow for the formation of large domains with uniform orientation of the chiral field .",
    "this has led to suggest spontaneous formation of macroscopic domains with differently oriented chiral condensates if the explicit symmetry breaking is sufficiently small .    on the other hand , in @xmath24 embedding , trajectories which are constrained by fixed boundary conditions on the angular variables can not unwind and thus always reflect the net baryon number of the considered domain .",
    "dissipative terms which must be present in the evolution equations will produce smooth trajectories which approximate the initial random angular configurations by random sequences of stable soliton and antisoliton structures .",
    "their density depends crucially on the ratio of their angular winding length @xmath59 to the size of the domain considered , but for sufficiently small @xmath59 they closely reflect the local winding structure of the random initial configuration , as in the kibble mechanism .    in the 1 + 1 dimensional @xmath36 model used here for illustration the angular winding length of nontrivial soliton solutions",
    "is tied to explicit symmetry breaking . for @xmath129 the final trajectories evolving after a quench interpolate linearly between the values @xmath122 and @xmath123 at the boundaries of the domain with size @xmath62 . with explicit symmetry breaking these differ by multiples of @xmath43 for sufficiently large domains .",
    "small angular winding lengths @xmath59 require large symmetry breaking",
    ". so the evolution of random initial configurations into soliton- antisoliton sequences within a given domain can be studied , but disoriented domains can not be obtained within this simple model . this deficiency is absent in 3 + 1 dimensional @xmath1 models where the mechanism which determines the angular winding length of nontrivial structures is largely independent of explicit symmetry breaking .    to summarize , if we want to maintain the topological concept of baryon number conservation in effective chiral theories near the chiral phase transition , we have to observe the angular nature of the chiral field and allow for a multitude of distinct sets of angles which describe the same physical situation .",
    "partition functions in the usual @xmath0 embedding of the @xmath1 model contain trajectories with fluctuating values of baryon number @xmath9 with comparable weight , while the angular embedding allows to select also near and above @xmath2 only configurations with the same baryon number that characterizes the system at @xmath75 .",
    "this feature is a natural ingredient of the nonlinear @xmath18 model for pions and it should not be lost when the chiral partner of the pion is included as important degree of freedom near @xmath2 .",
