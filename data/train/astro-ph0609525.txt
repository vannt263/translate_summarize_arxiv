    "the atmospheres of main - sequence ( ms ) stars with spectral types later than f5 exhibit the effects of magnetic activity . at ages of a few hundred myr ,",
    "ms stars have magnetic activity levels higher than the sun but considerably lower than what is typically observed in close binary rs cvn systems or in by dra stars .",
    "systematic photometric monitoring of ms fgk stars has been pursued for more than three decades to study starspots in these stars ( see , e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . in particular",
    ", @xcite reported that two out of eleven stars monitored in strmgren @xmath4 passbands showed light variations anti - correlated with the contemporaneous h&k s - index .",
    "@xcite found small - amplitude variations in @xmath5 and @xmath6 filters for about ten of 41 stars in their lowell observatory program , monitored for about eleven years , and reported photometric variability correlated with mean chromospheric activity . in a more recent paper , @xcite analyzed the same dataset and found short - term variability behavior due to rotational modulation in at least 15 of the solar - like stars in their sample .    recently",
    ", several studies have been conducted to analyze the photospheric and chromospheric active regions in young stars ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , but all the objects studied in these works are ultra - fast rotators ( ufr ) or pre - main sequence ( pms ) stars . in particular , @xcite found a marginal correlation between the starspot distribution and chromospheric inhomogeneities in lq hya , a rapidly rotating ( @xmath7 ) single k2 v star , probably just arriving on the zero age main sequence ( zams ) .",
    "however , they could not discriminate between plages and local velocity fields as the cause of the observed variations in the full - width half - maximum ( fwhm ) of the h@xmath3 line . on the other hand ,",
    "the two very active rapidly rotating pleiades stars hii 686 and hii 3163 studied by @xcite did not display the maximum of h@xmath3 and infrared triplet ( irt ) emission at the same phase of the spot transit .",
    "a rotational modulation of the h@xmath3 emission with maximum nearly coincident with the minimum of the light curve has been instead detected by @xcite in the active rapidly rotating binary tz crb .",
    "recently , @xcite presented the first photospheric / chromospheric study of hd 206860 , a solar - type star with an activity level intermediate between the sun and very active pms and ufr stars ; they used h&k and h@xmath3 lines as chromospheric indicators and photometric observations as a photospheric indicator .",
    "they found a clear rotational modulation in all the chromospheric and photospheric indicators , proving the presence of an uneven distribution of long - lived active regions and a spatial association between photospheric spots and chromospheric plages , as displayed in the sun and in the most active rs cvn systems .",
    "in this paper , we study the photospheric and chromospheric surface inhomogeneities in four young ms stars with activity levels intermediate between the sun and the very active ufr stars .",
    "we use light curves and/or temperature measurements as diagnostics of photospheric inhomogeneities and the h@xmath3 and d@xmath8 lines as chromospheric diagnostics .    only for @xmath2 cet ,",
    "for which we obtained contemporaneous photometric and temperature rotational modulations , are we able to determine a unique solution for the spot parameters ( area and temperature ) following the method described in @xcite ; for the other stars we give only a rough estimate of these spot parameters .",
    "moreover , we apply a spot / plage model to the photospheric and chromospheric rotational modulations in order to investigate the degree of spot / plage association in these mildly active stars , comparing the results with previous results obtained for very active binaries @xcite and single stars @xcite .",
    "we selected four early - g to early - k main sequence stars to be observed spectroscopically .",
    "we also have contemporaneous photometry for two of the stars ( @xmath2  cet , @xmath1  ori ) .",
    "the other two stars ( hd 166 , @xmath0  eri ) lack contemporaneous photometry .",
    "all four stars are listed by hd number in table [ tab : tbl-1 ] , along with each star s name , @xmath9 color index , spectral type , @xmath10 , the photometric comparison star ( for the two stars observed photometrically ) , and the stellar templates we used for spectral subtraction .",
    "a summary of spectroscopic and photometric observations is listed in table [ tab : tbl-2 ] .",
    "the photometric observations of @xmath2  cet and @xmath1  ori were acquired with the t4 0.75  m automatic photoelectric telescope ( apt ) at fairborn observatory in southern arizona ( usa ) .",
    "the apt is equipped with an emi 9124qb photomultiplier detector that measures stars sequentially through strmgren @xmath5 and @xmath6 filters .",
    "the observations are reduced differentially and corrected for extinction with nightly extinction coefficients and transformed to the strmgren system with yearly mean transformation coefficients .",
    "a complete discussion of the operation of this telescope and the reduction of the resulting data can be found in @xcite . in this paper , we have analyzed data on @xmath2  cet and @xmath1  ori acquired from november 2000 to january 2001 , i.e. , contemporaneous to the spectroscopic observations .",
    "spectroscopic observations have been performed in 2000 and 2001 at the _ m. g. fracastoro _ station ( serra la nave , mt . etna ) of catania astrophysical observatory with fresco ( fiber - optic reosc echelle spectrograph of catania observatory ) .",
    "the _ chelle _",
    "spectrograph is connected to the 0.91  m telescope through a fiber link .",
    "the spectral resolution was @xmath1114000 , with a 2.6-pixel sampling .",
    "the data reduction was performed with the echelle task of the iraf package following the standard steps : background subtraction , division by a flat field spectrum from a halogen lamp , wavelength calibration using the emission lines of a th - ar lamp , and normalization to the continuum through a polynomial fit .",
    "further details about the instrumentation and data reduction can be found in @xcite .",
    "our spectra include the h@xmath3-@xmath126563 and -@xmath125876 lines and a number of photospheric lines used for the temperature determination described in section [ sec : temp ] .",
    "temperature determinations of our target stars have been obtained by measuring the depth ratio of several line pairs following a method described by @xcite .",
    "the line - depth ratios ( ldrs ) allow us to resolve temperature variations as small as 10k @xcite , and the precision improves when one considers the average of several line pairs .",
    "for example , @xcite have demonstrated that ldrs can be used to detect the rotational modulation of the disk - averaged stellar temperature caused by the passage of cool spots across the photospheric disks of active rs  cvn stars .",
    "the h@xmath3 line has proven to be a very good diagnostic of stellar chromospheric activity and is easily accessible at optical wavelengths .",
    "consequently , we have extracted the excess emission in the h@xmath3 line that , in mildly active stars , partially fills the core of the h@xmath3 absorption profile .",
    "the emission contribution has been extracted with the  spectral synthesis \" method .",
    "high @xmath13 spectra of standard stars with negligible activity have been used as inactive templates for the spectral subtraction ( see table  [ tab : tbl-1 ] ) .",
    "the convolution of the template spectra with a proper rotational profile to mimic the @xmath14 of each target was not necessary because the stars analyzed in this paper have rotational velocities lower than 7 km s@xmath15 , which is about the fresco resolution .",
    "as an additional diagnostic of the upper chromosphere , we have used the @xmath125876 line which is seen as an absorption feature in the residual spectra .",
    "( @xmath16=441 ) is a main sequence star that was first detected as an astrometric binary by @xcite and then discovered to be a long - period sb1 ( @xmath17 = 5156@xmath187 ) by @xcite .",
    "however , the presence of a low - mass companion in such a wide system should not affect the activity pattern of @xmath1  ori .",
    "from a long - term h&k chromospheric emission analysis , @xcite observed significant variability but with no clear period .",
    "the star is a relatively rapid rotator since it is a young star belonging to the ursa major cluster with an age of about 300 myr .",
    "@xcite find @xmath19 @xmath20 and @xmath21 @xmath20 from an @xmath22-band image of the secondary component taken with the keck adaptive optics system .",

    "fig : f1 ] .",
    "the data have been folded in phase with the ephemeris @xmath23 , where the initial epoch is the date of the first observation and the rotational period is from @xcite .",
    "the @xmath24 photometry shows a low amplitude modulation of @xmath25002 .",
    "however , neither the net h@xmath3 equivalent width nor the derived temperature of @xmath1  ori appear to exhibit rotational modulation ( fig .",
    "[ fig : f1 ] ) .",
    "the maximum derived temperature is 5828 k , which is close to the value of 5838 k in @xcite , found by means of spectral line - depth ratios from high - resolution spectra .",
    "spectra of the h@xmath3 line of all four stars in our sample are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : f2 ] .",
    "the h@xmath3 profile in @xmath1  ori and the other three stars is always partially filled - in by emission .",
    "since @xmath1 ori is a rather active star , as denoted by its excess h@xmath3 emission , it may be that the lack of rotational modulation in temperature and h@xmath3 emission is due to observations that were acquired at an epoch of relatively low activity or at a time when the active regions were evenly distributed in longitude .",
    "this could also explain the very low amplitude of the light curve .",
    "the line is also detected as an absorption feature in the spectra of @xmath1  ori with values of equivalent width around 30 m , but it does not show a modulation with the phase .",
    "@xcite find a value of @xmath26=29 m , and @xcite obtain @xmath26= 25 m , i.e. very close to the equivalent width measured in this work .",
    "( @xmath16=483 ) is a nearby ( 9.16 pc ) single g5 dwarf .",
    "evidence of rotational modulation of h&k chromospheric emission has been found by @xcite .",
    "changes in its photometric ( rotational ) period suggest a combination of differential rotation and concentration of starspots at different stellar latitudes from year to year ( @xcite ) , consistent with a latitude drift of starspots during an activity cycle .",
    "in fact , @xcite find the existence of a solar - like starspot cycle of 5.9 years , which is similar to the chromospheric activity cycle of 5.6 years found by @xcite .",
    "@xcite estimated an age of 750 myr for @xmath2  cet from the relatively rapid rotation period of 92 seen in the spot modulation and suggested that the star is a likely member of the hyades moving group .",
    "the line was observed in absorption by @xcite , and its equivalent width in the @xmath27 m  range appeared rotationally modulated .",

    "the rotational phases have been computed from the ephemeris @xmath28 , where the initial epoch is the date of the first observation and the mean rotational period is from @xcite .",
    "the two curves correlate fairly well , each with a minimum around @xmath29 and a maximum near @xmath30 .",
    "the amplitude of the temperature curve is about 40 k , with an average value of @xmath255730  k , close to the values of 5718 k and 5747 k measured by @xcite and @xcite by means of spectroscopic analyses .",
    "the light curve has an amplitude of about 004 .    a spectrum of @xmath2  cet in the h@xmath3 region is shown in fig .  [ fig : f2 ] .",

    "the net equivalent width , as measured in the residual spectra , and the average temperature values are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : f3 ] .",
    "an anti - correlation between the light curve and @xmath31 modulation is apparent with the h@xmath3 minimum at @xmath32 and the h@xmath3 maximum near @xmath33 , i.e. , at the same rotational phases as the maximum and the minimum of the light and temperature curves , respectively .",
    "this implies a strong spatial correlation between the stellar spots and the chromospheric plages .",
    "the residual h@xmath3 profile of @xmath2  cet is relatively narrow ( @xmath34  ) and does not display the broad wings or asymmetric shapes observed in very active rs cvn stars .",
    "this implyes that the chromospheric active regions in this solar - type star , which is more active than the sun , nonetheless has a structure similar to the solar plages and lacks the strong mass motions and broadening effects observed in many of the more active rs  cvn stars ( @xcite ) .",
    "the line is always observed as an absorption feature whose intensity varies slightly .",
    "the large relative errors prevent us from reliably establishing any correlation with the rotational period .",

    "we have analyzed the photospheric and chromospheric activity in four young , magnetically active solar - type stars , namely @xmath1 ori , @xmath2 cet , hd  166 and @xmath0 eri .",

    "the he line is always present in our spectra , but the @xmath26 measurements show too much scatter to reveal any modulation with the rotational phase .",
    "thus , in general , the active regions in mildly active stars seem to have structures similar to solar active regions .    the spectroscopic measurements of hd  166 and @xmath0 eri span about five stellar rotations , but the spot / plage configuration seems to be largely unchanged , as observed in some other young solar analogues where the light curve remains stable for several rotations ( @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , from a simple spot / plage model analysis , we have derived the spot and plage parameters ( temperature and area ) . in the case of @xmath2 cet ,",
    "for which we had both simultaneous photometric and spectroscopic data , spot temperature and area have been uniquely determined .",
    "the grid of the temperature solutions is flat caused by the small - amplitude of the temperature curve of this ms star , and this leads to great errors in the unique spot solution . for hd  166 and @xmath0 eri , we have also presented a rough estimate of these two parameters .",
    "finally , the temperature difference @xmath59 between the quiet photosphere and spots , a key parameter tied to the blocking effect on convection produced by the intensification of the magnetic field , seems to be higher compared to that derived by @xcite for the stars with lower gravity , such as i m peg ( @xmath60 448 k ) and hk lac ( @xmath60 767 k ) .",
    "on the other hand , the spot filling factors seem to be smaller than those obtained for these active stars . moreover , the chromospheric plages are larger than the associated spots , as observed in the sun . as a consequence ,",
    "the increasing dissipation of magnetic energy with height above the photosphere , a characteristic of the sun , seems to occur for these solar - type stars as well .    in future studies , we want first to extend the number of main sequence targets and then investigate the inhomogeneities at photospheric and chromospheric levels in pre - main sequence , rapidly rotating stars to separate gravitational effects from activity level effects .",
