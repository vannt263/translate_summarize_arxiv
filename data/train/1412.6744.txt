    "nitric acid ( hno@xmath0 ) , in spite of its low concentration , makes a significant contribution to the infrared ( ir ) spectrum of the earth s atmosphere , since it has a number of strong absorption bands absorption lying in the water transparency window @xcite .",
    "yet its spectrum remains poorly characterized with , for example , no transition wavenumbers above 2000 @xmath1  included in the hitran database @xcite , despite the fact that several fundamental bands lie at higher wavenumbers .",
    "this issue is not due to any lack of attempts to measure the ir spectrum of hno@xmath0 @xcite , but rather to do with the difficulty of interpreting its spectrum and making line assignments .",
    "experimental line intensities have also been the subject of number of studies @xcite .",
    "the study of the hno@xmath0 spectrum over a range of temperatures is a difficult experimental and theoretical problem .",
    "experimental study of the hno@xmath0 ir spectrum is challenging because in the gas phase it is a mixture containing significant numbers of dimers and complexes , as well as the products of its dissociation ( no@xmath3 , h@xmath3o , o@xmath3 ) .",
    "therefore , experimental hno@xmath0 spectra are usually processed spectra in which spectra due to dimers , complexes and dissociation products have been subtracted .",
    "in addition , hno@xmath0 is a chemically aggressive species , which greatly complicates the experimental study of its spectrum at higher temperatures .    from the theoretical perspective , study of the ro - vibrational infrared spectrum of the hno@xmath0 is difficult because of the relatively large number of the vibrational degrees of freedom , @xmath4 , and the large anharmonicity of its vibrations .",
    "there are only limited attempts to solve the vibrational and ro - vibrational problems using full - dimensionality @xcite .",
    "benderskii and vetoshkin @xcite used a perturbative approach to study the tunneling dynamics of internal rotation .",
    "lauvergnat and nauts @xcite also concentrated on these levels in both reduced and full dimensionality .",
    "@xcite used second - order vibrational perturbation theory ( vpt2 ) to help interpret their experimental findings .",
    "more recently , avila and carrington @xcite have performed full - dimensional variational calculations with a particular focus on how to make such studies efficient .",
    "none of these studies considered transition intensities and amongst various _ ab initio _ studies using more approximate treatments @xcite , only lee and rice @xcite appear to have considered ( harmonic ) intensities .",
    "recently , we @xcite developed a hybrid variational - perturbational calculation scheme for computing ir spectra of polyatomic species .",
    "hno@xmath0 was one of the species used to test this methodology . here",
    "we present calculations of the infrared spectrum of hno@xmath0 performed using this method .",
    "the calculations provide a comprehensive room temperature line list covering the range 0 - 7000 @xmath1 .",
    "our vibration - rotation hamiltonian written in curvilinear internal coordinates and an eckart embedding has the form @xcite @xmath5 where @xmath6 are the rotational coordinates and @xmath7 is the vibrational part of the hamiltonian @xmath8 @xmath9 here @xmath10 are internal , vibrational curvilinear coordinates given by changes in the bond lengths , valence bond angles , and dihedral angles from the corresponding equilibrium values ; @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 are the euler angles between the axes of the equilibrium moment of inertia tensor and external cartesian coordinate axes ; @xmath14 are elements of the inverse of the moment of inertia tensor , @xmath15 ; @xmath16 is the vibrational kinetic energy operator and @xmath17 are elements of the kinetic energy coefficients matrix @xmath18 and @xmath19 $ ] .",
    "finally , @xmath20 is the molecular potential energy .",
    "after transformation , the vibrational kinetic operator can be written as @xmath21 where @xmath22\\right\\ } , \\end{split}\\ ] ] is the pseudo - potential or watson term @xcite ; @xmath23 are elements of @xmath24 .",
    "we have performed calculations @xcite which suggest that the pseudo - potential eq .",
    "( [ e : pseodopot ] ) makes only a small contribution to the vibrational energy levels of polyatomic molecules such as hno@xmath0 .",
    "for the water molecule this contribution is less than 1.3 , 1.0 and 1.9  @xmath1for the fundamental energy levels @xmath25@xmath26 , @xmath25@xmath3 and @xmath25@xmath0 respectively . with the growth in the size of the molecule and",
    "increase in its total mass , the contribution of the pseudo - potential to the vibrational energy levels decreases significantly @xcite .",
    "therefore , to simplify and speed - up the calculations we neglect the contribution of pseudo - potential .",
    "some of this contribution will be incorporate in our final , empirical potential energy surface ( pes ) .",
    "elements of the @xmath18 matrix are , in general , a complicated function of the vibrational coordinates @xcite . as an example",
    ", table  [ tab : gm1 ] gives elements of @xmath18 for the stretching and bending ( inter - bond angle ) modes .",
    "the latter in the case of hno@xmath0  are the angles @xmath27 n - o - n and n - o - h .",
    "the elements of @xmath18 are presented for two cases : for the bending coordinates given in the form of @xmath28 , and in the form of its cosine , @xmath29 . in total for hno@xmath0there",
    "are 55 elements of @xmath18 .    as can be seen from table  [ tab : gm1 ] , expressing the bending coordinates as a change in the angle leads to a simplied expression for the matrix elements of @xmath18 because their dependence on @xmath30 is a linear or quadratic .",
    "however , in general @xmath18 is a complicated function of the internal coordinates .",
    "general expressions of its elements are given elsewhere @xcite .",
    "in general terms , if both coordinates represent changes in bond lengths then @xmath31 if one coordinate represents a change in the bond length and the second is an angular coordinate then @xmath32 and if both represent angular coordinates it becomes @xmath33 in these expressions @xmath34 is bond length of the @xmath35-th bond and @xmath36 represents the angular coordinates .      to simplify the calculation of the vibrational hamiltonian matrix elements in block 2 ( see below ) , which correspond to the perturbative contribution for the matrix elements from the main block 1 ( see below ) , the vibrational kinetic energy coefficients are expanded in the polynomial form and truncated at the second order @xmath48 this form is convenient because it allows faster , by an order - of - magnitude or more , computation of the coefficients without significant loss of accuracy .",
    "the potential energy function used by us is a fourth - order polynomial @xmath49 where morse coordinates , @xmath50 , are used to represent changes of all bonds for hno@xmath0 molecule and @xmath51 for angular coordinates .",
    "for ease of use and better convergence of the basis functions , the @xmath52 are generally chosen to form a complete orthonormal set . in variational calculations of vibrational energy levels ,",
    "the hamiltonian matrix elements are computed using the product form @xmath53 of the basis functions , which are eigenfunctions of the morse or harmonic oscillators .",
    "morse oscillator functions , @xmath54 , are used for the stretching coordinates , @xmath55 , for which the potential is given using a morse coordinate .",
    "harmonic basis functions , @xmath56 , are used for the other coordinates , which are represented using curvilinear normal coordinates @xmath57 expressed as a linear sum over the internal coordinates , @xmath10 , for which the potential function is defined as a taylor series .",
    "the coordinates @xmath58 are those which diagonalize the harmonic part of the hamiltonian given in the internal coordinates @xmath10 . with these definitions , all multi - dimensional integrals required to calculate the hamiltonian matrix elements are separated into products of one - dimensional integrals between either morse functions or harmonic oscillators .",
    "all these integrals have a simple analytic form which results in high - speed computation of the hamiltonian matrix elements .    the vibrational hamiltonian matrix constructed in this way is then diagonalized to give the vibrational energy levels @xmath59 and the corresponding wave functions @xmath60 .",
    "our implementation relies on the particular structure of the hamiltonian matrix ordered by increasing polyad ( total vibrational excitation ) number , @xmath61 @xmath62 where @xmath63 is some weighting which is often roughly proportional to the inverse of the frequency @xcite . for simplicity in this work",
    "we use @xmath64 for all @xmath65 .",
    "this gives the size of the basis set , @xmath66 in terms of the maximum polyad number , @xmath67 , @xmath68    calculating all @xmath69 vibrational term values for hno@xmath0 with an accuracy better than 0.3 @xmath1 requires basis functions with @xmath70 .",
    "this means that the hamiltonian matrix must include all the basis functions for which the difference in @xmath71 is larger than 9 .",
    "thus , an accurate calculation of the fourth overtones and combination frequencies ( @xmath72 ) demands a variational basis for hno@xmath0 ( @xmath73 ) which includes @xmath74 basis functions .",
    "we use a hybrid variational - perturbation method for calculating ro - vibrational energy levels of a polyatomic molecules @xcite .",
    "it combines the advantages of both variational calculations and perturbation theory .",
    "the vibrational problem is solved by diagonalizing a hamiltonian matrix , which is partitioned into two sub - blocks , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "the first , smaller sub - block includes matrix elements with the largest contribution to the energy levels targeted in the calculations ( @xmath75 ) .",
    "the second , larger sub - block comprises those basis states which have little effect on these energy levels .",
    "numerical perturbation theory , implemented as a jacobi rotation , is used to compute the contributions from the matrix elements of the second sub - block .",
    "only the first sub - block needs to be stored in memory and diagonalized .",
    "the size of block 1 , @xmath76 , is given by eq .",
    "( [ e : n_bmax ] ) using @xmath77 as the number of the largest polyad included in block 1 .    in the first step of our approach all the matrix elements from blocks 1",
    "are computed along with the diagonal matrix elements of block 3 .",
    "the second step involves computing the off - diagonal elements of block 2 and accounting for their effect on the matrix elements of the block 1 using one jacobi rotation @xcite .",
    "considering a contribution from off - diagonal element @xmath78 in block 2 , which couples the diagonal elements @xmath79 in block 1 and @xmath80 in block 3 , the diagonal element in block 1 is perturbatively adjusted using the jacobi formula @xmath81 where @xmath82 and @xmath83    for ro - vibrational energy levels it is necessary to calculate elements of the complex hermitian hamiltonian matrix @xmath84 using the basis functions @xmath85 where @xmath86 is a ( complex ) wigner function . in this case @xmath87 the vibrationally averaged moment of interia , @xmath88 , is expanded to second - order as a taylor series @xmath89 @xmath90 and all the integrals reduce to products of one - dimensional integrals over either morse or harmonic oscillators .",
    "the off - diagonal elements of the vibration - rotation hamiltonian matrix @xmath91 differ significantly in magnitude , depending on whether they are diagonal in the vibrations , @xmath92 , or couple different vibrational states , @xmath93 .",
    "when calculating the vibrational - rotational energy levels , the off - diagonal elements @xmath94 corresponding to different vibrational states @xmath93 give a much smaller contribution ( change in the diagonal elements in the block that will be diagonalized ) to the calculated energy levels than the off - diagonal elements @xmath95 within the vibrational state in question .",
    "these changes are given approximately by @xmath96 @xmath97 however , @xmath98 involves only a change in the rotational energy level , while @xmath99 involves also a change in the vibrational energy level . for semi - rigid molecules with small values of the vibrational quantum numbers the following condition usually holds @xmath100 which results from the slight change in the effective geometry of the molecule upon vibrational excitation .",
    "this feature of the vibrational - rotational hamiltonian matrix is common for large molecules and underpins the ro - vibrational version of our hybrid approach @xcite .",
    "again we use second - order perturbation theory , as defined by a jacobi rotation , to transform the @xmath101 matrix to a series of much smaller rotational sub - matrices corresponding to different vibrational states @xmath102 , @xmath103 .",
    "the dimension of each rotational sub - block is @xmath104 only and we consider @xmath105 sub - matrices that correspond to @xmath105 vibrational states .",
    "the resulting block - diagonal form is then diagonalized for each @xmath102 sub - matrix separately .",
    "thus our algorithm replaces the diagonalization of a huge [ @xmath114-dimensional ro - vibrational matrix with a number of diagonalizations of much smaller dimenionsional-[@xmath104 ] matrices .",
    "an important factor in solving the anharmonic vibrational problem is the choice of internal curvilinear vibrational coordinates , @xmath10 .",
    "this choice determines how close the truncated polynomial potential function of eq .",
    "( [ e : potential ] ) is to the real pes of the molecule , as well as the specific form of the kinetic energy coefficients matrix , @xmath18 , see eqs .",
    "( [ e : g0 ] ) , ( [ e : g1 ] ) and ( [ e : g2 ] ) .",
    "the structure of the hno@xmath0 molecule and the atom numbering we use is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] . for hno@xmath0",
    "we employ the following vibrational coordinates :    * four coordinates represent changes in the length of valence bonds between atoms @xmath116 where @xmath117 are lengths of the bond vectors @xmath118 with the vectors pointing from the first to the second atom . *",
    "four coordinates represent changes in the cosines of angles between the valence bonds @xmath119 which contain one dependent or redundant angle .",
    "this dependence is removed upon the introduction of @xmath58 coordinates , see eq .",
    "( [ e : q - normal ] ) .",

    "molecule.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    this physically - motivated choice of internal curvilinear vibrational coordinates ensures that quartic expansion of the potential , eq .",
    "( [ e : potential ] ) , stays close to the real pes in the region around the minimum .",
    "for example , hno@xmath0 has a low frequency mode , @xmath25@xmath127 , corresponding to rotation of the @xmath124 bond around the @xmath120 bond which is approximately represented by the coordinate @xmath128 .",
    "this vibrational mode is characterized by very large anharmonicity , as it has large amplitude and a strongly anharmonic potential function .",
    "quantum - chemical calculations carried out by lauvergnat and nauts @xcite show that this rotation corresponds to the potential curve which is close to a sine wave .",
    "our quantum - chemical calculations show that in the expansion of the pes as a function of coordinate @xmath128 in eq .",
    "( [ e : potential ] ) gives a nonzero quadratic term for coordinate @xmath128 but zero cubic and quartic terms .",
    "this is because writing the potential function in the form @xmath129 is equivalent to defining it as a sine wave in the angle of rotation of the @xmath124 bond .",
    "thus , choosing the vibrational coordinates in the form of change of sine of the angle for this mode provides a compact definition of the strongly anharmonic sinusoidal potential function as a single term in the expansion eq .",
    "( [ e : potential ] ) . as a result",
    ", we obtain good agreement between the experimental and calculated vibrational terms values for @xmath130@xmath25@xmath127 using our _ ab initio _ potential parameter , see table  [ tab : n9 ] .",
    "this in turn means that the calculated spectrum reproduces the absorption intensities for the hot bands starting from the @xmath25@xmath127 , 2@xmath25@xmath127 , 3@xmath25@xmath127 states which are shifted from the main absorption bands and which are characteristic of hno@xmath0 , see figure  [ fig : h2 ] and discussion below .",
    ".experimental ( exp . ) @xcite and calculated ( calc . ) vibrational term values for excitation of the @xmath25@xmath127 mode using _ ab initio _ potential parameters ; the result of lauvergnat and nauts @xcite are given for comparison [ cols= \" > , > , > , > \" , ]     table  [ tab : int ] shows experimental and calculated intensities for different frequency regions using the initial ( calculation a ) and fitted ( calculation b ) values of the parameters @xmath131 , @xmath132 and @xmath133 in the dmf .",
    "this table shows that the use of the _ ab initio _ dmf leads to a systematic overestimation of the calculated intensities : by an average of 40%for the fundamentals bands and by 90%  for the first overtones and first combination bands .",
    "fitting gives greatly improved agreement between the calculated and experimental intensities . in this case , the average difference for the intensities of the fundamental transitions is only 0.3%  and for the first overtone and combintation bands",
    "it is 40% .",
    "these differences between the computed and measured band intensities are within the experimental uncertainties .",
    "for example in the region of the fundamental bands , intensities from hitran are on average 10%  higher than the absorption cross sections given by pnnl . at the same time , the intensity of the @xmath25@xmath134+@xmath25@xmath127 combination band is 30% less in hitran than pnnl . in addition ,",
    "the pnnl spectrum which we used becomes very noisy for low intensity absorptions .",
    "therefore , at present , it does not make sense to further improve the agreement between calculated and experimental intensities .",
    "figure [ fig : h1 ] compares our calculated spectra for hno@xmath0 at 296 k with the data from hitran .",
    "although hitran aims to be comprehensive for atmospherically important molecules such as hno@xmath0 , it actually contains only a few hno@xmath0 vibrational bands which means that hitran gives much less complete coverage than the measured cross sections from pnnl .",
    "in particular , hitran has no data for wavenumbers higher than 1900 @xmath1 .",
    "figures [ fig : p1 ] give a similar overview comparison of our calculated spectrum with the 298  k pnnl cross sections .",
    "figure  [ fig : h2 ] presents more detailed comparisons for the main bands in hitran below 700 @xmath1 .",
    "generally the agreement is very good .",
    "hitran is systematically missing data on hot bands even when they give rise to strong , sharp features .",
    "for example , the @xmath25@xmath127 band region is missing several , intense hot bands which are found in our calculation and which have been experimentally observed @xcite .",
    "a similar situation arises for the @xmath25@xmath134 band , see fig .",
    "[ fig : hp ] .",
    "this band is the only one for which a direct comparison of hitran and pnnl data is possible .",
    "again our calculations predict sharp hot - band features which are absent from the hitran spectra . despite becoming increasingly noisy at low frequencies , the strongest of these hot - band features",
    "can clearly be seen in the pnnl cross sections . it should be noted that the anharmonic character of the torsion @xmath25@xmath127 mode gives rise to a sequence of hot bands in the region 370510  @xmath1 , significantly shifted from the center of @xmath25@xmath127 .",
    "figure  [ fig : p2 ] presents detailed comparisons of our calculated cross sections with those of pnnl measured at @xmath135 k. our spectra were converted to cross sections using a voigt profile @xmath136 @xmath1 ( a half width at half maximum ( hwhm ) of 0.153 @xmath1 ) , chosen to match spectra from the pnnl database @xcite . as can be seen",
    ", our calculated spectrum reproduces the pnnl cross sections very well both in the overall shape and magnitude of the band .",
    "this is also true for the finer details of the spectrum .",
    "for example , the 1800  2000 @xmath1  region shows many features due to hot bands and combination bands which are generally well - represented in our calculated spectum .",
    "the data necessary to reproduce the spectrum of hno@xmath0 at temperatures up to 300  k in the 0 - 7000  @xmath1  range has been stored in a variety of formats . in particular , we have created a line list in the exomol format @xcite .",
    "the list contains transitions involving rotational quantum number @xmath137 up to 70 for @xmath138 vibration - rotation energy levels belonging to 1715 vibrational states and associated transitions probabilities , in form of einstein a coefficients .",
    "the rotational angular momentum threshold of @xmath137 = 70 provides a complete set of rotational energy levels up to 1050  @xmath1 . to reduce the very large number of transitions between different ro - vibrational energy levels we only retain those transitions for which the intensity is greater than @xmath139",
    "cm / molecule at 296 k. in total the line list contains about two billion transitions ; it can be found on the exomol @xcite website www.exomol.com .",
    "key information on the calculation in form of the initial and refined coefficients of the potential and dipole moment functions can be found in the supplementary data to this article @xcite .",
    "we present a detailed study of the infrared spectrum of nitric acid .",
    "calculations are performed using a hybrid variational - perturbation procedure which allows the whole spectrum can be calculated rapidly on a standard desktop computer when combined with the initial guess on the intensities of strong lines provided by experiment .",
    "this has allowed us to tune both the potential energy surface and dipole moment function to the available experimental data .",
    "comparison with the experimental compilations available in hitran @xcite and the pnnl database @xcite generally give excellent agreement .",
    "however we find that hitran is systematically missing features due to hot bands , even when these are rather strong .",
    "hno@xmath0 has a strong spectral signature in the earth s atmosphere which can be clearly seen from space .",
    "as such it is one of a number of species that are considered to be possible signatures of life ( biosignature ) . to help aid the detection of life outside the solar system and other studies on hot astronomical bodies",
