    "the lattice can make a major contribution to the understanding of flavor physics through the computation of the properties of heavy - light mesons . among the important quantities to calculate are the heavy - light decay constants , form factors , and @xmath2 parameters .",
    "( see ref .",
    "@xcite for recent reviews . )",
    "however , the `` traditional '' lattice approach , using quite massive light quarks , is likely to produce results that have large systematic errors coming from the long chiral extrapolation @xcite .",
    "an alternative approach that seems very promising is to use staggered ( kogut - susskind ) fermions for both the light valence and sea quarks @xcite .",
    "an exact chiral symmetry for staggered quarks at finite lattice spacing allows simulations to be performed at small quark mass , deep in the chiral regime .",
    "staggered quarks have `` taste '' symmetry , a four - fold remnant of the doubling symmetry .",
    "taste symmetry is broken at @xmath5 in the lattice spacing , resulting in rather large discretization effects . even at the smaller lattice spacing",
    "employed in current milc simulations with improved staggered quarks @xcite ( the `` fine '' set with lattice spacing @xmath6 ) , the effects are not negligible in any quantity which is sensitive to pseudoscalar meson loops .",
    "this has been understood in the light meson sector using staggered chiral perturbation theory ( s0.4expt ) @xcite .",
    "we now extend this program to include heavy quarks , thus merging heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) with s0.4expt .",
    "we then calculate the leptonic decay constants , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , at one loop in s0.4expt  in both the partially quenched and full qcd cases .",
    "this is one of the simpler quantities to calculate both in lattice simulations @xcite and in the s0.4expt  formalism .",
    "simulations with staggered fermions such as refs .",
    "@xcite , use the `` fourth root trick '' @xcite , designed to reduce the number of tastes per flavor from 4 to 1 in the continuum limit .",
    "the validity of the fourth root trick has not been proven , although various recent studies have , in our opinion , made it rather plausible @xcite . in the following ,",
    "we _ assume _ that this trick is valid , and that it can be represented in the chiral theory by insertions of factors of @xmath4 for each sea quark loop @xcite .",
    "we employ a quark - flow analysis @xcite to locate these sea quark loops . the `` replica method '' @xcite is an alternative technique for inserting the appropriate factors .",
    "it is theoretically cleaner than quark flow , but usually somewhat more complicated to implement in practice .",
    "one would start with @xmath9 staggered fields for each continuum sea - quark flavor desired , and take the limit @xmath10 at the end .",
    "the two approaches yield identical results in the current case , and in all other cases that have been investigated to date .",
    "a brief discussion of the current results , as well as the application to semileptonic form factors , was previously presented in ref .",
    "a detailed description of the semileptonic calculation is in preparation @xcite .",
    "the s0.4expt  forms obtained have already been used for the chiral ( and continuum ) extrapolations of numerical lattice results for heavy - light semileptonic @xcite and leptonic @xcite decays .    in this paper the heavy quark mass @xmath1 is taken to be large compared to @xmath11 , so that working to leading order in the heavy quark expansion ( _ i.e. _ ,  neglecting @xmath0 terms ) is a reasonable first approximation .",
    "we also do not include , in our effective theory , discretization errors coming from the heavy quark .",
    "we assume that such errors can be adequately estimated independently , using hqet as the effective theory description of the lattice heavy quark @xcite .",
    "however , in order to separate light and heavy quark discretization errors , our analysis requires that the heavy quark mass not be much greater than one in lattice units .",
    "the rather counterintuitive restriction arises because the heavy quark action no longer sufficiently suppresses doublers when @xmath12 .",
    "indeed , in the large @xmath13 limit , the heavy quark action becomes a static lattice action , where there is no suppression of spatial doublers at all , since a static quark s energy is independent of its momentum .",
    "when heavy quark doublers are insufficiently suppressed , the light and heavy quarks in a heavy - light meson can exchange gluons of momenta @xmath14 , leading to `` mixed '' 4-quark operators ( products of heavy and light bilinears ) in the symanzik action that violate taste . in order to avoid treating this complication  which would inextricably mix light- and heavy - quark discretization errors  we do not allow @xmath12 in our analysis",
    ". on the other hand , typical values of @xmath13 in practical calculations with the fermilab @xcite or nrqcd @xcite heavy quarks are likely to be acceptable . with this restriction ,",
    "all taste - violations in the @xmath5 symanzik action occur solely in the light quark sector ; the taste - violating terms are thus the same as in refs .",
    "more details , including a discussion based on the symmetries of the lattice action , appear in .    incorporating heavy quarks into s0.4expt",
    "produces a large number of terms in the chiral lagrangian involving combinations of the heavy - light and the light mesons .",
    "all of these terms , which arise due to the taste symmetry breaking , are however non - leading : they do not appear in one - loop diagrams for the heavy - light quantities and enter the decay constant result through a single analytic term .",
    "non - trivial taste violations arise only in the light meson propagators in the one - loop diagrams .",
    "since the taste - violating low energy constants in the light meson sector have been determined from simulations and s0.4expt  fits @xcite , the new analytic term is the only additional fit parameter beyond those low - energy constants that appear in the continuum , such as the @xmath2-@xmath15-@xmath16 coupling @xmath17 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first describe the symanzik action to @xmath5 in .",
    "the s0.4exptlagrangian , here including heavy - light mesons , is then constructed from a spurion analysis in , where the latter focuses on the @xmath5 terms involving heavy - light mesons . in sec .",
    "[ sec : fb ] we calculate the one - loop expression for the chiral logarithms that arise in the leptonic decay constant , @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the flavor of the light valence quark .",
    "we write down the final results for various cases in sec .",
    "[ sec : final_results ] and discuss some features of the low energy constants ( lecs ) in .",
    "finite volume effects are treated in sec .",
    "[ sec : fin_vol ] .",
    "we finish with some remarks and conclusions in sec .",
    "[ sec : conc ] .",
    "for concreteness , we consider here a heavy quark that is simulated either with nrqcd @xcite or with the fermilab interpretation @xcite of a clover or more highly improved quark .",
    "what is crucial for us about these possible heavy quark actions is that they describe a single physical fermion  doubler .",
    "its `` rest mass '' is defined to be the energy of the state when all 3-momentum components are exactly @xmath14 or 0 .",
    "since these states are always suppressed in the cases considered here , we do not need to be concerned that the interpretation of such states as additional heavy _",
    "particles _ is problematic : with wilson - like or non - relativistic fermions , their energy _ decreases _ when one of the large components of momentum changes away from @xmath14 . ]",
    "masses are assumed to be larger than the physical heavy quark mass by an amount of order of the cutoff , _",
    "i.e. _ ,  @xmath20 .",
    "this means that the heavy quark fields in the symanzik action will have no degree of freedom corresponding to `` taste . ''    in the limit @xmath21 , however , it will not be possible to neglect the doublers with either the fermilab or the nqrcd actions .",
    "that is because these actions approach a static lattice theory , which has no intrinsic suppression of spatial doublers : the energy of a static quark is independent of its three - momentum .",
    "this would not be a problem if the light quark in a heavy - light bound state were simulated as a wilson - like fermion . in that case , the light - quark wilson term would suppress gluon exchanges of momentum @xmath14 between the light and heavy quarks , by forcing the light quark far off shell . but emission or absorption of such a gluon is not suppressed by the staggered light action , and indeed is simply a taste - changing interaction . to keep the analysis manageable , we must assume that the _ heavy _ quark action suppresses these exchanges .",
    "we define @xmath22 to be the splitting between ( the rest masses of ) the physical heavy quark and the closest doublers . to be able to ignore the effect of doubler states in the low energy effective theory",
    ", we must have @xmath23 .",
    "however , for the fermilab or nrqcd action , @xmath22 goes like @xmath24 for @xmath12 ; eventually the condition @xmath23 will be violated as @xmath1 grows at fixed @xmath25 .",
    "we wish to correct a possible misunderstanding here .",
    "when @xmath26 , one might worry that doublers can not be neglected relative to the physical heavy quark since both physical and doubler masses are formally @xmath27 .",
    "however , what is important is not ( say ) the ratio of doubler mass to physical mass , but the _ splitting _",
    "@xmath22 between doubler masses and the physical mass .",
    "as long as @xmath23 , the doubler states can treated as `` integrated out '' and their effects can be summarized by higher - dimension operators in the symanzik / hqet theory @xcite involving only the light quarks and the _ physical _ heavy quark .",
    "systematic errors coming from doublers are thus included in estimates of heavy - quark discretization effects from higher operators .",
    "( see further discussion below ) .",
    "it is instructive to estimate @xmath22 in some practical situations . for wilson - type quarks , the rest ( or `` pole '' ) mass @xmath28 of the physical quark",
    "is given at tree level by @xmath29 , where @xmath30 , with @xmath31 the hopping parameter and @xmath32 its critical value .",
    "for the lowest doubler , with momentum @xmath14 in a single lattice direction , the wilson term @xmath33 becomes 2 instead of 0 , and the doubler rest mass @xmath34 is given by @xmath35 .",
    "for the milc `` coarse '' lattices @xcite , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 , the hopping parameter of a @xmath39 quark is @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "this gives @xmath41 .",
    "alternatively , using the tadpole improvement @xcite parameter @xmath42 gives @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "these values of @xmath22 , which are comparable to other masses dropped in 0.4expt  ( _ e.g. _ ,  @xmath45 ) , are probably large enough to neglect the effect of doublers in the current chiral analysis .",
    "however , it is clear that applying this analysis to any lattices that are significantly coarser than the milc coarse lattices will be problematic .",
    "for example , at @xmath46 , we estimate @xmath47 , which is certainly not much larger than @xmath48 . with @xmath22",
    "this low , any effective chiral theory becomes very complicated , and there also would be practical problems in separating the physical state from the doubler states in simulations .",
    "a similar analysis applies in nrqcd . using a bare mass @xmath49 for @xmath39 quarks on the milc coarse lattices and a stabilization parameter @xmath50 @xcite , we find @xmath51 , which should be adequate .",
    "however , with @xmath46 , @xmath52 , again much too low to omit the effects of doublers from the effective chiral theory .",
    "if heavy quark doubler effects may be neglected , the analysis of the symanzik action is very similar to that in ref .",
    "@xcite , which considers ginsparg - wilson valence quarks coupled to staggered sea quarks .",
    "taste violations at @xmath5 appear only in four - quark operators composed exclusively of light ( staggered ) quarks . these terms in the symanzik action are identical to those in @xcite .",
    "`` mixed '' four - quark operators consisting of the product of a light quark bilinear and a heavy quark bilinear do not break taste symmetry . physically , operators that violate taste symmetry require momentum @xmath14 gluon exchanges , which we ban from the symanzik action when we omit doubler states from the low - energy theory .",
    "a more rigorous proof that follows from the symmetries of the lattice action can also be constructed .",
    "the proof is identical to that presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , so we do not include it in detail here .",
    "the basic idea is that the continuum , physical , heavy quark fields transform trivially under translations by one lattice unit .",
    "staggered bilinears with non - singlet taste , on the other hand , get multiplied by phase factors under single - site translations .",
    "therefore mixed four quark operators can not be translation singlets unless the light bilinear is a singlet under taste .",
    "the mixed four - quark operators are thus irrelevant from the point of view of our heavy - light chiral theory .",
    "such operators are invariant under the light quark chiral symmetries since they do not break taste ( or , trivially , flavor ) symmetries and are independent of the light quark masses ( otherwise , they would have dimension greater than 6 ) .",
    "we therefore can classify the discretization errors caused by such operators as `` heavy - quark errors . ''",
    "these errors can be estimated by the methods of refs .",
    "( see especially the appendix of ref.@xcite for estimates of heavy quark discretization errors in a practical case . ) in fact , one expects that errors from mixed four - quark operators will be rather smaller than the more familiar ones from heavy - quark bilinear operators , since the former are @xmath53 for improved staggered ( `` asqtad '' ) light quarks @xcite ; while the latter are @xmath54 or @xmath5 .",
    "it is important to keep in mind , however , that such error estimates are based on power counting and dimensional analysis and must be considered as rough guides only .",
    "precise quantification of the total discretization error will always require simulation at several lattice spacings .",
    "four - quark operators built entirely out of heavy quarks are also invariant ( trivially ) under the light quark symmetries .",
    "therefore , the arguments of the previous paragraph apply , with the exception that the discretization errors are now @xmath55 : there is no suppression of the exchange of a single gluon with momentum @xmath14 between the two quarks , unlike the cases where one or both of the quarks has the asqtad action .",
    "the relevant part of the symanzik action may now be written as @xmath56 , with @xmath57 where @xmath58 comes from light four - quark operators only .",
    "@xmath59 is the continuum limit of the lattice theory with @xmath60 staggered light quarks ( each with 4 tastes ) , and a single heavy quark .",
    "it has the form @xmath61 here @xmath62 is the heavy quark velocity , and @xmath63 runs over the light quark flavors .",
    "@xmath64 has a heavy quark @xmath65 spin symmetry and , in the limit that @xmath66 , a chiral @xmath67 symmetry .",
    "the @xmath5 term @xmath68 in eq .   is a sum over all 4-light - quark operators in the two classes @xmath69 and @xmath70 identified in ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath71 @xmath69 consists of ten operators that do not violate continuum rotation symmetry , while the four operators in @xmath70 violate this symmetry . for @xmath60 staggered fields ,",
    "the operators in each of these classes are written down in ref .",
    "every operator is a product of two bilinears , each of which has the same spin and taste . denoting the five possible spins structures by @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and similarly for tastes ,",

    "the operators in @xmath85 are more complicated : spin and taste indices are summed together , and two terms , with different treatment of the tensor indices , are subtracted to cancel taste- or spin - singlet contributions .",

    "@xcite and @xcite , the leading order ( lo ) chiral lagrangian for light - light pseudoscalars is found for the one - flavor and many - flavor cases , respectively . there",
    "the only available lorentz 4-vector in the chiral theory is the partial derivative operator @xmath89 . to construct a chiral operator with the symmetries of @xmath90 operators",
    "requires at least two derivatives and two explicit taste indices .",
    "such operators are @xmath91 , where the factors of lattice spacing @xmath25 come from the explicit violation of taste symmetry , and the factors of @xmath92 come from the derivatives .",
    "these operators then only occur at next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) in the chiral lagrangian , unlike the representatives of @xmath79 which are lo .",
    "the @xmath90 representatives are therefore omitted in refs .",
    "@xcite , although they are included in ref  @xcite , which works to nlo .    in the heavy - light case",
    ", however , there are two 4-vectors available in the chiral theory whose presence does not raise the order of the operator : the heavy quark 4-velocity @xmath93 and the light quark gamma matrix @xmath94 .",

    "the heavy - light part of the chiral lagrangian is identical at leading order to that in the continuum , aside from the extra taste degrees of freedom , which enter trivially .",

    "the light meson masses and splittings , as well as the values of @xmath565 and @xmath566 , come from measurements of the light hadron spectrum and decay constants @xcite .",
    "we have used the value @xmath567 for the sea quark mass .",
    "we set @xmath568 and choose @xmath505 to give a slope at large mass similar to what is seen in simulations .",
    "the continuum result shows the characteristic divergence of partially quenched chiral perturbation theory as the valence mass is taken to zero for fixed sea mass .",
    "the taste violations , however , completely wash out this behavior and give a result that looks rather linear .",
    "this is in fact an example of an infrared sensitive quantity for which the chiral and continuum limits in s0.4expt  will not commute @xcite .",

    "<S> we incorporate heavy - light mesons into staggered chiral perturbation theory ( s0.4expt ) , working to leading order in @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the heavy quark mass . at first non - trivial order in the chiral expansion , </S>",
    "<S> staggered taste violations affect the chiral logarithms for heavy - light quantities only through the light meson propagators in loops . </S>",
    "<S> there are also new analytic contributions coming from additional terms in the lagrangian involving heavy - light and light mesons . using this heavy - light s0.4expt </S>",
    "<S> , we perform the one - loop calculation of the @xmath2 ( or @xmath3 ) meson leptonic decay constant in the partially quenched and full qcd cases . in our treatment </S>",
    "<S> , we assume the validity both of the `` fourth root trick '' to reduce four staggered tastes to one , and of the s0.4expt  prescription to represent this trick by insertions of factors of @xmath4 for each sea quark loop . </S>"
