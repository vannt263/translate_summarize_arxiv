    "in presence of magnetic field and at low temperatures , quantum hall ( qh ) edge modes appear in a 2deg@xcite . in such 2d qh bar ,",
    "edge modes flow in a manner ( shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) ) such that at the top edge electrons only move in one direction to the right . at the other ,",
    "i.e. , bottom edge electrons flow to the left in exactly opposite direction .",
    "so if a electron in the top edge has to change its direction , it has to scatter to the opposite edge ( bottom ) , according to the chiral traffic rule@xcite . at low temperatures and in samples , e.g. , mercury telluride ( hgte / cdte ) heterostructures@xcite with strong spin - orbit coupling quantum spin hall ( qsh ) edge modes appear .",
    "herein spin of the electron is locked to its momentum . if at the top edge of the sample spin up electrons are moving in one direction ( say",
    ", right ) then spin down electrons are moving in the opposite direction ( left ) . and at the bottom edge vice versa .",
    "thus a new traffic rule comes into effect - helical traffic rule and these edge modes are therefore helical@xcite .",
    "to scatter , an electron into the opposite direction its spin has to flip .",
    "this is prohibited by time reversal(tr ) symmetry as qsh samples obey tr symmetry in contradistinction to qh samples which do nt .",
    "the reason it is necessary to probe helicity is because the qsh state is a new state of matter- it is a 2d topologically ordered phase in absence of magnetic field .",
    "the qsh edge modes due to the potent spin - orbit interaction , realize a 1d metal wherein spin is tied to the direction of motion .",
    "this unique state of matter has to be experimentally and rigorously probed such that its existence is beyond doubt .",
    "further , as the qsh edge modes can be used in low power information processing due to their robustness against disorder , it is very important to identify these helical edge modes .     + ( a ) +   + ( b ) +    there are different methods for detecting helicity and chirality .",
    "the usual way to probe the existence of chiral / helical edge modes is via conductance measurements in multi terminal transport experiments .",
    "lets consider an elementary set - up as in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b)- a two terminal conductor with probes 1 and 2 as source and sink . if a third probe is added in between probe 1 and 2 as a voltage probe ( fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) ) then for qh sample one edge mode enters probe 3 from source and another edge mode goes out from it .",
    "so to maintain net current zero at probe 2 its potential is adjusted to potential of the source , and the two terminal conductance of the sample remain the same as before ( without voltage probe 2 )",
    ". we can understand this from landauer - buttiker formalism@xcite .",
    "current through voltage probe- @xmath0 leads to @xmath1 .",
    "but in qsh sample one edge mode enters the voltage probe from source and two edge modes come out of the voltage probe .",
    "the current through voltage probe- @xmath2 leads to @xmath3 , @xmath4 @xmath5 , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "so its potential is adjusted to half of the potential of the source@xcite .",
    "the conductance as a consequence is also half the conductance from before ( without voltage probe ) . while the conductance of the qh sample does not change with addition of an extra voltage probe , in qsh samples the conductance",
    "is reduced by adding a voltage probe .",
    "measuring the conductance with the inclusion of a voltage probe one can differentiate between the helical and chiral edge modes .",
    "further , since the non - local resistance in qh vanishes but is finite for qsh@xcite , measuring the non - local resistance too one can distinguish chiral from helical edge modes . in two of our recent works@xcite",
    "we also have explored the distinct attributes of chiral qh and helical qsh edge modes . while qh edge modes are robust to disorder and inelastic scattering , qsh edge modes are affected by the same .",
    "the robustness of qh edge modes to disorder and inelastic scattering also could be a tool to detect chiral or helical edge modes .",
    "further , to the aforesaid works , few more papers @xcite have explored this topic using superconductors@xcite , with polarized stm tips@xcite , with corner junctions@xcite and finally exploiting the rashba coupling@xcite . all these works while relying on different systems have a common conductance measurement which acts as the arbiter of helicity .",
    "since in quantum spin hall systems spin is locked to momentum , relying on just conductance measurements is risky , wherein detecting degree of spin polarization in samples exposed to disorder and spin - flip scattering will be tricky . in this paper",
    "we aim to use the hanbury - brown and twiss or shot - noise correlations to probe the presence of helical edge modes .",
    "non - local shot noise correlations on the other hand are seen to use the disorder and/or spin - flip scattering present as a resource in being better able to differentiate between chirality and helicity .",
    "further , while local shot noise correlations have been calculated in some recent works with qsh samples@xcite to our knowledge this is the first work wherein the non - local shot noise correlations has been used as a probe of helicity . in 1950 , r hanbury brown and r twiss found out the diameter of radio stars via a intensity - intensity correlation experiment@xcite .",
    "the fermionic analog of this famous experiment was realized in ref.@xcite for a 2deg in the qh regime .",
    "the current - current correlations were shown to be completely anti - correlated meaning fermions in obedience to paulli principle exclude each other .",
    "these current - current correlations also go by the name of shot noise which measures the correlations between fluctuations of the current@xcite . in this work",
    "we find that measuring the non - local hbt noise correlations between two disordered probes in presence of inelastic scattering via a voltage probe one can differentiate between the chirality or helicity of the edge modes .",
    "we observed that in the mentioned condition while the cross correlations are always negative for qh case , it can be positive or negative depending on the disorder in the qsh case .",
    "so getting a positive nonlocal correlation in these conditions identifies helical edge modes .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows , first we focus on the qh case and calculate the non - local `` hbt  correlations for two disordered probes in our set - up , then proceed to case of all disordered probes . next we add inelastic scattering to our set - up with two disordered probes and finally ending with all disordered probes with inelastic scattering . we see in all these cases non - local hbt correlations are always negative .",
    "we next focus on qsh case , herein we distinguish between the non - local charge and spin correlations .",
    "similar to the qh case we calculate the the non - local ' ' hbt ",
    "correlations for two disordered probes in the qsh set - up , then discuss the case of all disordered probes . like the qh case we next add inelastic scattering to the qsh set - up with two disordered probes and finally to all disordered probes with inelastic scattering .",
    "we see that the non - local charge correlations can be positive in presence of inelastic scattering .",
    "if there is no spin - flip scattering then charge and spin correlations are identical .",
    "finally , we include spin flip scattering too in addition to disorder and inelastic scattering in the qsh setup .",
    "we see inclusion of spin - flip scattering leads to difference between non - local charge and spin correlations .",
    "the non - local spin hbt correlations turns completely positive with increasing spin flip scattering but the non - local charge correlations turn absolutely negative .",
    "we end the paper with a conclusion and a perspective on applications to other materials .",

    "we can understand this in this way that qsh edge modes are spin polarized and there are spin up electrons , which after getting out of the probe 2 ( voltage probe which redistributes the current ) follow one edge of the hall bar and directly reach the contact 3 ( a detector ) , at the same time spin down electrons after getting out from same contact 2 follow the other edge of the hall bar reaching contact 4 ( another detector ) via contact 1- and these two electrons can be correlated positively .",
    "since these two electrons are traveling via two completely different paths and as different probes are disordered with varying degrees of disorder these two paths will have different transmission probabilities .",
    "but in qh case ( as discussed in section ii ) if there are two edge modes , they do not travel via different paths ( one can not separate the paths taken by the two edge modes from voltage probe to detector ) and therefore even if probes are affected with varying degrees of disorder the transmission probabilities of two edge modes will be identical .",
    "that s why positive non - local correlation is not observed in the qh set - ups as in section ii even in presence of disorder and inelastic scattering .",
    "the set - up for this case is depicted in fig . [",
    "m5](b ) . the scattering matrix relating the incoming wave to the outgoing one",
    "is given as eq . .",
    "here we have considered @xmath22 , and @xmath23 . as contact 2",
    "is the voltage probe , substituting @xmath62 gives @xmath107 .",
    "now the fermi - dirac distribution functions as usual at zero temperature and with probes 3 and 4 as detectors are as follows- @xmath24 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 ( for @xmath26 ) , @xmath51 ( for @xmath52 ) and @xmath53 ( for @xmath54 ) .",
    "thus , from eqs .  , and ( 14 ) one can calculate the non - local correlation @xmath95 , as the expressions are large we will analyze them in fig .",
    "[ n6](c ) .",
    "positive non - local correlations are obtained in this case similar to the two probe case discussed above , while inelastic scattering and the fact that up and down spin edge modes have different transmittances through the sample ( due to the difference in their paths ) is critical to getting positive correlations , the effect of disorder on these positive correlations is more ambiguous .",
    "some disorder is of course necessary to have noise but other than that there is no clear cut influence of increasing / decreasing disorder on the positive correlations so obtained .",
    "till now we have only considered non - magnetic disorder in the contacts .",
    "now we ask the question what happens to the positive correlations in presence of magnetic disorder in the sample ?",
    "of course the answer is simple , it will lead to spin flip scattering . in the next section",
    "we address this question .",
    "we consider spin - flip scattering within the sample between any two probes .",
    "spin - flip parameter f is the probability of a electron to flip its spin indicated at particular regions in fig .",
    "[ s7](a ) by starry blobs .",
    "the case represented in fig .",
    "[ s7](a ) , depicts two disordered probes with inelastic scattering and spin - flip scattering .",
    "the scattering matrix relating the incoming to the outgoing wave is given as follows :    @xmath108    whenever there is a spin flip we introduce a @xmath109 phase in the scattering amplitude . here",
    "too as before we have @xmath22 , and @xmath23 . as",
    "contact 2 is a voltage probe , putting @xmath62 gives @xmath110 . at zero temperature ,",
    "the fermi - dirac distribution functions are as follows : @xmath24 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 ( for @xmath26 ) , @xmath51 ( for @xmath52 ) and @xmath53 ( for @xmath54 ) . from eqs .",
    ", , ( 14 ) and ( 15 ) one can calculate the non - local charge correlation @xmath95 as well as spin correlation @xmath111 , as the expressions are large we will analyze them via plots fig .",
    "[ s7](a ) and ( b ) . as spin flip scattering probability f",
    "is increased to 0.25 fig .",
    "[ s7](a ) the correlation can be positive or negative depending on the disorder at probe 1 , and as f is increased to 0.5 one can see that non - local charge correlation becomes completely negative irrespective of the disorder .",
    "strong spin flip scattering completely destroys the positive correlation effect induced in the non - local fluctuation by the inelastic scattering in qsh sample .",
    "one can also calculate the non - local spin shot noise correlation from eq .  , ( 10),(14 ) and ( 15 ) .",
    "this is plotted in fig .",
    "[ s7](c ) . in this case",
    "we see opposite behavior to the non - local charge correlation shown in fig .",
    "[ s7](a ) .",
    "the non - local spin correlation turns completely positive with spin flip scattering .",
    "of course the non local charge and spin correlations are identical for qh case as well as when spin flip scattering is absent in qsh samples .",
    "the nonlocal hbt spin correlation can thus be a good detector of spin flip scattering if present .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "to conclude we establish here that we can probe helical edge modes via non - local hbt correlations",
    ". these can be positive with helical qsh edge modes but will always be negative with chiral qh edge modes .",
    "further , we show that the difference between the non - local charge and spin correlations can also distinguish between the chiral and helical edge modes , while the non - local charge correlations turn completely negative with increasing spin - flip scattering , the non - local spin correlations turn completely positive . in table 1",
    "we summarize the results .",
    "finally , the difference between the non - local charge and spin correlations can be used to detect if there is any spin flip scattering present in the system .",
    "to end , we would like to point out that although in our work we have exclusively focused on qh and qsh edge modes our detection technique ( non - local hbt correlations ) can be a very effective tool to probe helicity in weyl semi metals@xcite too .",
