    "the emerging field of organic spintronics aims to combine the advantages of molecular electronics , such as device miniaturisation and fabrication ease , with the massive potential for application inherent in spintronics @xcite .",
    "organic materials are particularly promising in spintronic devices as they exhibit weak spin - orbit and hyperfine interactions , resulting in long spin coherence times @xcite .",
    "moreover , they have a high chemical diversity and offer the possibility for selectively tuning their electronic and magnetic properties via ligand modification .",
    "the first reported organic spin valve used a thin layer of alq@xmath6 as an organic spacer between lsmo and co electrodes @xcite . recently , a magnetoresistance of 300% was found for the same structure @xcite . in an effort to meet the demand for miniaturisation there has been a drive to use single organic molecules as spacer elements @xcite .",
    "an added advantage is that the resistance of such a device would be considerably smaller than that of a thin - film based device .",
    "very high magnetoresistance effects have already been predicted @xcite and achieved @xcite in such single molecule spin - valves for both the tunnelingand conducting regime .    in many cases",
    "it is the interface between the organic molecule and the inorganic electrodes that determines the spin injection properties .",
    "the exchange - split densities of states of the electrodes result in the spin - selective shift and broadening of the molecular orbitals .",
    "the result is a spin - polarized interface , the so - called ` spinterface ' @xcite .",
    "the spin - split molecular orbitals @xcite as well as the spin - polarized interface itself @xcite have been directly observed .",
    "even a single organic molecule has been demonstrated to be capable of locally manipulating the spin polarization emerging from a clean magnetic surface .",
    "this was shown by atodiresei et al .",
    "@xcite and brede et al .",
    "@xcite who considered the effect the adsorption of small organic molecules can have on a ferromagnetic fe / w(110 ) surface .",
    "they found that even a molecule as small as a benzene ring ( bz ) can act as an efficient spin filter , capable of inverting the spin polarization of the surface , due to the particular hybridization of orbitals at the interface  an effect which has also been observed for single atoms adsorbed on magnetic surfaces @xcite .",
    "most organic - inorganic interfaces studied to date involve ferromagnetic surfaces @xcite .",
    "more recently , the adsorption and coupling of molecules on substrates with layered antiferromagnetic order has been used to explore spin - polarized transport and the exchange bias effect @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we consider a surface with a more complex spin structure  a monolayer of mn on the w(110 ) surface  which has been characterized on the atomic scale @xcite .",
    "it has been found to exhibit a spin spiral ground state propagating along the [ @xmath7 direction with an angle of @xmath8173@xmath9 between magnetic moments on adjacent rows @xcite .",
    "this means that neighbouring rows of mn atoms have magnetic moments approximately opposite in direction but with an orientation relative to the film that varies slowly across the surface .",

    "this surface has already been used as as a magnetic template in order to determine and manipulate the spin direction of individual co adatoms on the atomic scale @xcite .",
    "here , we explore the effect of single molecules on its local magnetic properties .",
    "we present a density functional theory study of the structural , electronic and magnetic properties of several simple organic molecules adsorbed on the mn / w(110 ) surface . due to the long period of the spin spiral",

    "the molecules under investigation include benzene ( bz : c@xmath0h@xmath0 ) , cyclooctatetraene ( cot : c@xmath1h@xmath1 ) and the small benzene - transition metal complex bzv .",
    "we show that due to hybridization with the molecule the magnetic moments of the adjacent mn atoms can be strongly reduced and that the spin polarization of such an organic - antiferromagnetic interface is modulated on the atomic scale and can be enhanced and inverted with respect to the clean mn film .",
    "the modification of the spin polarization due to this interface can be revealed by spin - polarized scanning tunneling microscopy ( sp - stm ) as demonstrated by our calculations .",
    "we find that the exact magnitude and sign of the spin polarization in the vacuum above the molecule is strongly dependent on the bonding details at the interface and , due to the antiferromagnetic surface , exhibits a strong intra - molecular spatial dependence . in almost all cases ,",
    "the sign of the vacuum spin polarization above the adsorbed molecule is inverted and its magnitude enhanced .",
    "we demonstrate that this modification of the charge density in the vacuum is a hybridization - induced effect between the @xmath5-orbitals of the organic molecule and the spin - split @xmath3-orbitals of the magnetic surface .",
    "the effect of the non - collinear spin structure of the mn monolayer on the spin - polarized stm images is also calculated , using a model based on that of tersoff and hamann @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "after briefly describing the computational method , the structural details of the adsorbed molecules are discussed .",
    "this is followed by a description of the electronic and magnetic properties of the hybrid organic - inorganic interface . in particular , we discuss the spin resolved local density of states as calculated in the vacuum above the molecules , i.e. the simulated stm images . finally , we consider in an approximate way the effect the true spin spiral ground state can have on the simulated sp - stm images .",
    "the final section summarizes our main conclusions .",

    "the central quantity of this scheme is the spin dependent local density of states in the vacuum integrated over a particular energy range corresponding to an experimental bias voltage .",
    "the substrate is modelled using a 3 layer slab of w atoms and one layer of mn atoms in the collinear checkerboard antiferromagnetic configuration .",
    "the gga calculated lattice constant of w is 3.17  , in good agreement with the experimental value of 3.165  .",
    "the size of the supercell was chosen such that a distance of at least 12.5   was maintained between the centre of neighbouring molecules .",
