    "polaron formation as a consequence of electron - phonon coupling appears in many contexts in condensed matter physics , including charge carriers in colossal magnetoresistance materials @xcite and in high - temperature superconductors @xcite . as theoretical research in this field spans over five decades ,",
    "many analytical techniques have been applied to this problem @xcite .",
    "the applicability of these methods is usually limited to a particular parameter regime , frequently far from the physically most interesting crossover regime . despite extensive analytical work in this field , there remain many open problems including the nature of the crossover to large polaron mass , the form of various correlation functions , the nature of the polaron excited states , and dynamic properties of the polaron .",
    "constantly growing computer capabilities have allowed research in this field to take advantage of various numerical methods , including exact diagonalization techniques ( ed ) @xcite , quantum monte carlo calculations ( qmc ) @xcite , variational methods including the global - local method ( gl ) @xcite , and recently developed density matrix renormalization group techniques ( dmrg ) @xcite .",
    "a comparison of results obtained by different methods for energy bands and effective masses is contained in the work of romero _ et al .",
    "although most of these methods give reliable results in a wide range of parameter regimes , each suffers from different shortcomings .",
    "the ed technique gives reliable results on small lattices ( up to 20 sites @xcite ) for ground and excited state properties .",
    "results are limited to discrete momentum @xmath1points .",
    "qmc methods can treat large system sizes ( over 1000 lattice sites ) and provide accurate results for thermodynamic polaron properties .",
    "dynamic properties , however , require analytic continuation from imaginary time , which is an ill - posed problem that is extremely sensitive to statistical noise .",
    "the gl method gives reliable results for energy bands and the polaron effective mass on reasonably large system sizes ( 32 sites ) , however , it is limited to ground state properties .",
    "the dmrg method seems to be most successful in computing ground state properties including various correlation functions . despite the lack of translational symmetry",
    ", it provides reasonably accurate results for energy bands and the effective mass",
    ". it can deal with large system sizes ( _ e.g. _ 80 sites and 30 phonons per site ) , delivering reliable results in the intermediate and strong coupling regime .",
    "dmrg is less reliable in the weak coupling regime .",
    "it generally treats large systems with open boundary conditions and does not allow the calculation of dynamic or large @xmath0 properties or excited states , although there are some exceptions to these rules @xcite .",
    "in this paper we focus on several issues of the holstein problem .",
    "we present a simple and computationally efficient method based on the exact diagonalization technique .",
    "we apply the method to the one - dimensional , single - electron holstein model . among the advantages of our method",
    "are the simplicity of our approach , the efficiency in selecting the variational space , and the ability to compute both ground and excited state physical properties of the system at continuous total wavevector @xmath0 .",
    "we define the variational space on an infinite lattice .",
    "even though most of our calculations were done on a workstation , our results are often superior to those of other numerically more intensive methods @xcite .",
    "we test the method by comparing results for the energy band , effective mass , quasiparticle weight and correlation functions with some of the most successful recent numerical methods .",
    "the second part of this paper is devoted to the investigation of the first excited state of the model . using our numerical method as well as a strong coupling analytical approach",
    ", we find a phase transition between a state where the polaron forms a bound state with an additional phonon excitation , and one where there is no bound state .",
    "generalizations of this method can even be used to calculate coherent quantum dynamics far from equilibrium , including those of a polaron driven by a strong electric field @xcite , and of an electron tunneling across a potential drop while coupled to phonons @xcite .",
    "we consider the holstein hamiltonian @xcite    @xmath2    where @xmath3 creates an electron and @xmath4 creates a phonon on site @xmath5 .",
    "we consider the case where a single electron hops between nearest neighbor wannier orbitals in 1d , and interacts with dispersionless optical phonons .",
    "the electron - phonon coupling strength is @xmath6 , and is local in real space ( @xmath0-independent ) .",
    "the parameters @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath6 all have units of energy , and can be used to form two dimensionless ratios .",
    "( different conventions for the parameters are sometimes used in other papers . )",
    "it is clear at the outset that for any finite values of the parameters , the exact groundstate will be a delocalized state with momentum @xmath9 , and not a `` self - trapped '' solution that breaks translation - invariance .",
    "the simple argument is that if the ground state were self - trapped , its center could be shifted and a degenerate ground state obtained .",
    "if the hamiltonian has any nonzero matrix element between states with different centers , a lower energy state can be obtained by a phased superposition of wavefunctions with different centers ( a bloch state ) .",
    "the only known way that this argument can fail is with ( unphysically ) strong electron - phonon coupling as @xmath10 to a gapless phonon spectrum , in which case the matrix element between different centers can vanish @xcite . in that case",
    ", an exact ground state can be written as either self - trapped or as a bloch state .",
    "self - trapping can not occur here because the phonon spectrum has a gap .",
    "although the exact ground state is a bloch state , for some parameters ( e.g.  very large @xmath6 ) , a self - trapped solution can have a low variational energy@xcite .",
    "it has indeed been proven that polaron ground state properties , including the energy and effective mass , are analytic functions of the hamiltonian parameters @xcite .",
    "we will see below that such a theorem can not be extended to include excited states .",

    "if a basis state can be generated in more than one way , only one copy is retained .",
    "all nonzero matrix elements of the hamiltonian between retained basis states are included .    a small variational hilbert space is shown in fig .",
    "( [ tight ] ) .",
    "the dots may be thought of as basis states in the many - body hilbert space , or alternatively as wannier orbitals in a periodic ( one - body ) tight - binding model , with hopping matrix elements given by the bonds .",
    "the variational space shown in fig .",
    "( [ tight ] ) is still infinite , since the lattice repeats periodically to infinity .",
    "it is clear from bloch s theorem , however , that each eigenstate can be written as @xmath16 , where @xmath0 is the momentum , @xmath5 is the unit cell , and @xmath17 is a set of @xmath18 complex amplitudes , one for each state in the unit cell ( @xmath19 for the example of fig .",

    "the ac conductivity of the polaron , for example , appears as an `` interband '' transition in this mapping .",
    "the largest variational basis that we have used has @xmath21 , or @xmath22 states .",
    "it is usually unnecessary to use such a large basis for intermediate - coupling ground state properties , even to obtain 12-digit accuracy for the energy .",
    "the variational hilbert space we construct is not a standard one , and appears to add basis states more efficiently than some other methods .",

    ", there is a basis state with @xmath27 quanta on the electron site and an equal number simultaneously on a first neighbor site .",
    "the maximum distance that a phonon excitation can appear from the electron is @xmath28 , but then only a single quantum and only if there are no phonons excited elsewhere in the system @xcite . only the basis states from a single unit cell ( a single electron position )",
    "are stored in computer memory .",
    "the energy of a polaron for a finite chain of @xmath29 sites with periodic boundary conditions is _ lower _ than that for an infinite lattice with the same parameters .",
    "( this is easily to verify in weak - coupling perturbation theory , or numerically . )",
    "thus , previous exact diagonalization and most other variational approaches produce energies that are variational for the particular lattice size @xmath29 that they treat , but are not variational in the thermodynamic limit @xmath30 .",
    "the energy we calculate is , in contrast , variational in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "( the quoted dmrg energies are extrapolated and not variational , although they are generally rather accurate . )    having the capability to compute the polaron energy @xmath31 at any @xmath0 rather than being limited to multiples of @xmath32 makes our method more accurate for computing the effective mass of the polaron using the standard formula @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the effective mass of a free electron .",
    "the second derivative is evaluated by small finite differences in the neighborhood of @xmath35 .",
    "note that although the calculated energy @xmath31 is a variational bound for the exact energy , there is no such control on the mass , which may be either above or below the exact answer , and is expected to be more difficult to obtain accurately .",
    "nevertheless , in the intermediate coupling regime where our method at @xmath36 gives an energy accuracy of 12 decimal places , one can calculate the effective mass extremely accurately ( 6 - 8 decimal places ) by letting @xmath37 .",
    "further information about the quasiparticle may be obtained by computing the quasiparticle residue , the overlap ( squared ) between a bare electron and a polaron , @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the state with no electron and no phonon excitations , and @xmath40 is the polaron wavefunction at momentum @xmath0 .",

    "we find good agreement with gl away from strong coupling and good agreement in all regimes with dmrg .",
    "dmrg calculations are not based on finite-@xmath0 calculations due to a lack of periodic boundary conditions , so they extrapolate the effective mass from the ground state data using chains of different sizes , which leads to larger error bars and more computational effort .",

    "the energy of the first excited state is nonanalytic ( discontinuous first derivative ) at @xmath150 .",
    "the bound state formation is unusual for several ( related ) reasons : ( a ) for @xmath151 , the binding energy is linear in @xmath152 for small @xmath152 , rather than the @xmath153 dependence that is typical for 1d bound state problems .",
    "( b ) for @xmath149 , the phase shift is zero between the polaron and an additional unbound phonon of relative momentum @xmath154 .",
    "the polaron and additional phonon pass through each other transparently , in contrast to the usual repulsive phase shift .",
    "( c ) at @xmath150 , even for finite @xmath29 ( periodic boundary conditions ) , there are two exactly degenerate ground states , in contrast to the usual avoided crossing .",
    "these unexpected properties result in part from the fact that the central site in the tight - binding model ( eq .  [ v1 ] ) becomes uncoupled from the rest of the lattice precisely at @xmath150 .",

    "the method allows the computation of energy bands and other physical properties at continuous wavevectors . for intermediate coupling strengths we are able to reach an accuracy of 12 digits for the ground state energy at small @xmath0 with as few as @xmath49 basis states and only a few seconds of cpu time on a workstation .",

    "correlation functions @xmath86 computed at different @xmath0 provide detailed information on how the weak coupling polaron transforms as @xmath0 increases from @xmath47 to @xmath85 .    using numerical and strong - coupling approaches",
    ", we find a true phase transition ( rather than a crossover ) in the first excited state , where a polaron plus phonon system changes from unbound at weak coupling to bound at strong coupling .",
    "the first excited state does not contribute to the optical conductivity , but rather is raman active .",
    "there are a number of extensions to this work that we have not included in this paper .",
    "it is straightforward to consider anharmonic phonons .",
    "( in fact , the extreme double - well limit where only the lowest two states are retained is numerically less demanding than the linear case . ) the ac conductivity and spectral function of a polaron can be calculated by the same methods .",
    "properties of other hamiltonians , including those with ssh - type couplings where phonons modify the hopping @xmath7 can be calculated .",
    "extensions that allow certain phonon excitations to be infinitely far from the electron are possible .",
    "properties in higher spatial dimensions can be calculated .",
