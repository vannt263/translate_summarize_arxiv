    "in the recent years there has been an increasing demand on ultrashort electron bunches to drive short - wavelength free - electron lasers and study novel accelerating techniques such as plasma - based accelerators  @xcite .",
    "short bunches are commonly obtained by magnetic compression . in this latter scheme",
    ", the bunch is compressed using a series of dipoles arranged in a chicane configuration such to introduce an energy - dependent pathlength .",
    "therefore an electron bunch having the proper time - energy correlation can be shortened in the chicane .",
    "however , problems inherent to magnetic compression such as momentum spread and transverse emittance dilution due to the bunch self - interaction via coherent synchrotron radiation  @xcite has brought back the idea of bunching the beam with radio - frequency ( rf ) structures  @xcite .    it was recently proposed to incorporate the latter method ( henceforth named velocity bunching ) into the next photo - injector designs  @xcite .",
    "the velocity bunching relies on the phase slippage between the electrons and the rf - wave that occurs during the acceleration of non ultra - relativistic electrons . in this paper after presenting a brief analysis of the velocity bunching scheme , we report on its exploration at the deep ultraviolet free - electron laser ( duv - fel ) facility of brookhaven national laboratory ( bnl ) .",
    "the measurements are compared with numerical simulations performed with the computer program astra  @xcite .",

    "the evolution of @xmath6 can be expressed as a function of @xmath7 solely : @xmath8 introducing the parameter @xmath9 , we write for the energy gradient  @xcite : @xmath10 the system of coupled differential equations ( [ eqn : psi ] ) and ( [ eqn : gammap ] ) with the initial conditions @xmath11 and @xmath12 describe the longitudinal motion of an electron in the rf structure .",

    "we note that there are two contributions to @xmath27 : the first term @xmath28 comes from the phase slippage ( the injection and extraction phases are generally different ) . the second term @xmath29 is the contribution coming from the initial energy spread . to illustrate the compression mechanism we consider a two macro - particles model",

    "the structures are approximately 3  m long and can operate with an average accelerating voltage up to 20  mv / m . nominally the bunch is shortened using a magnetic bunch compressor chicane located between the second and third linac sections . in this latter case , the linac sections l1 , l3 , l4 are ran on - crest while the linac l2 is operated to impart the proper time - energy correlation along the bunch to enable compression as the beam pass through the magnetic chicane .",
    "+ to investigate the velocity bunching scheme , the linac section l1 was used as a buncher : its phase was varied and , for each phase setting , the section l2 was properly phased to maximize the beam energy with sections l3 and l4 turned off .",

    "we use the linac section l3 to cancel the incoming time - energy correlation , and operate the linac l4 at zero - crossing to introduce a linear time - dependent energy chirp along the bunch ( we have investigated both zero - crossing points ) .",

    "[ fig : zerophasingsim ] . to generate the presented data we started with a longitudinal phase space which has a third order distortion but no linear correlation ( as it should be downstream from linac l3 ) we then set the constant @xmath43 to have a full - width fractional momentum spread of approximately @xmath48  % similar to the value imposed by the finite size of the viewer ( diameter @xmath3215  mm ) used for the measurement of the bunch energy distribution .",
    "the figure  [ fig : zerophasingsim ] demonstrates the impact of the third order distortion in the longitudinal phase space : depending on the chosen zero - crossing phase , it contributes to an elongation or a contraction of the measured time profile compared to the real profile .",
    "for the rms bunch length measurements reported hereafter we computed the average bunch length measured for the two zero - crossing points and reported the difference as an error bar .",
    "for the reported bunch profiles we use the bunch profile corresponding to the case when the phase space has no fold over .",
    "hence we expect the bunch time - profile reported hereafter to be longer than in reality .",
    "+ as the phase of the linac section l1 was varied and l2 tuned to maximize the energy gain , the beam energy was measured .",

    "fig : e_vs_phil1 ] and the corresponding plot for the bunch length is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bl_vs_phil1 ] .",
    "as predicted , we observed that operating the linac at lower phases ( thereby giving the bunch head less energy than the tail ) provides some compression .",

    "two cases of measured and simulated bunch time - profile are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : profile_sim_vs_meas ] . again , the agreement between simulation and experiment is fairly good taking into account the uncertainties associated to the zero - phasing method .",
    "noteworthy is the achieved peak current of @xmath32150  a.    the frequency - domain technique is based on the measurement of the coherent radiation emitted by the electron bunch via some electromagnetic process . in the coherent regime (",
    "i.e. for frequencies @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the rms bunch duration ) the radiated power scales with the squared charge and depends on the bunch form factor .",
    "thus it provides indirect informations on the bunch time - profile . in duv - fel",
    ", we detect the far - field radiation associated to the geometric wake field caused by aperture variation along the accelerator ( e.g. the irises of the rf - structure ) .",
    "the radiation shining out of a single - crystal quartz vacuum window , located prior to the linac section l3 , was detected with a he - cooled bolometer .",

    "[ fig : bolom_compare ] , the measured bolometer output signal versus the phase of l1 is compared with the expectation ( 1 ) calculated from the simulated phase space density and ( 2 ) computed from the measured bunch time profile obtained by zero - phasing . as expected the increase of the coherent signal is an unambiguous signature of the bunch being compressed ( the charge was monitored during the measurement and remained constant to 200@xmath4720  pc ) .",
    "+ the data points computed from the measured time profile @xmath57 were obtained by numerically computing the fourier transform of the bunch time - profile ( using a fft algorithm ) and by performing the integration : @xmath58 where @xmath59 stands for the frequency response of the detection system .",

    "we have measured the bunch length dependence on the phase of a traveling wave accelerating structure located just downstream from an rf electron source .",
    "we could compress the bunch by a factor > 3 , down to @xmath320.5  ps , for a bunch charge of 200  pc . in our experimental setup ,",
    "a stronger compression is currently difficult to achieve without significantly impinging the transverse phases - pace quality .",
    "the linac section used for the compression also plays a crucial role in achieving low emittance since it quickly accelerates the beam at energies of approximately 60  mev thereby freezing the transverse phase space .",
    "hence operating the first linac far off - crest reduces the final energy and impact the emittance since transverse space charge forces scale as @xmath67 .",
    "an improvement of our experiment would be to surround the accelerating structure used as a bunch compressor with a solenoidal lens to enable a better control of the beam transverse envelope and emittance  @xcite .",
