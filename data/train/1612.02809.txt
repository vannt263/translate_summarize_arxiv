    "brown dwarf spectra contain a wealth of information about the physical and chemical processes occurring in their atmospheres .",
    "such processes include , but are not limited to : vertical atmospheric energy balance , disequilibrium chemistry , cloud formation / distribution and subsequent impact on molecular composition , and links to formation and evolution ( see marley & robinson 2015 review ) .",
    "the main diagnostic quantities that provide insight into these processes , that can be obtained directly from a spectrum are : vertical thermal structure , molecular abundances , spectroscopic radius , and cloud properties .",
    "deriving these diagnostic quantities is no simple task .",
    "progress in characterization always involves the interplay between observational and modeling efforts .",
    "it is from the comparison with models that we aim to understand the underlying physics and chemistry in substellar atmospheres .",
    "the classic method for interpreting brown dwarf spectra is generating a set of self - consistent radiative- convective - thermochemical equilibrium models to which the data can be compared ( allard et al .",

    "grids of model spectra are typically generated by varying only a few parameters , usually gravity and effective temperature ( kirpatrick 2005 ) with all of the physics and chemistry in the atmospheres assumed ( e.g. , self - consistent radiative equilibrium plus equilibrium chemistry is used to predict the thermal structures and molecular abundances ) .",
    "these models are then interpolated along these dimensions via a chi - squared search until a best fit , or range of best fit parameters are found ( e.g. , cushing et al .",

    "are not enough to adequately explain the spectra .",
    "often times the fits are rather poor making any inference about these quantities and their corresponding uncertainties invalid ( czekala et al .",
    "this suggests that the physical assumptions made within the grid models are not adequate enough to describe the data and that the grid models are underutilizing the full information content of the data . to remedy these issues some modelers chose to add additional physical parameters to their models to accommodate for new assumptions not previously ( as of then ) taken into account such as disequilibrium chemistry via an eddy diffusivity ( saumon et al .",

    "here we briefly summarize our methodologies extensively described in part i. we couple a simple thermal emission radiative transfer forward model ( line et al . 2013a ; 2014a , b ; 2015 ) with the powerful emcee sampler ( foreman - mackey et al .",

    "we neglect scattering due to clouds and treat everything as pure absorption .",

    "the retrieved temperature profiles are summarized in figure [ fig : figure4 ] .",
    "we then present the molecular abundance results , their chemical plausibility , derived elemental abundances , and resulting diagnostic trends , implications for cloud formation , and finally comment on the retrieved evolutionary related parameters ( gravity , effective temperature , and radius ) .",
    "understanding atmospheric energy balance requires knowledge of the temperature - pressure profiles ( tp - profile ) .",
    "the tp - profile of a sub - stellar atmosphere is largely governed by the opacity structure and internal heat flux , which is in turn dictated by the mass and age ( e.g. , allard et al . 1996 ; burrows 2001 ; saumon & marley 2008 ) .",
    "the two dominant energy transport mechanisms are radiation and convection .",
    "radiative energy transport tries to eliminate any vertical radiative flux divergence .",
    "thermal structures that meet this criterion are said to be in radiative - equilibrium . at deep enough layers , where the mean opacities are large , radiative energy transport is no longer effective at carrying the heat flux . at this point",
    ", convective energy transport dominates .",
    "the location of this radiative convective boundary is predicted to occur at pressures deeper than @xmath550 bars , or at atmospheric temperatures of @xmath51500k , for late t - dwarfs ( burrows et al .",
    "additional heating due enhanced opacity from cloud particulates can sometimes result in multiple convection zones separated by a radiative zone ( burrows et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "other non - traditional sources of heating / cooling that could impact the tp - profiles and/or their time dependence ( e.g. , robinson & marley 2014 ) have been hypothesized .",
    "latent heat release due to cloud condensation can result in a shallower adiabat than predicted from pure gas phase chemistry alone ( tan & showman 2016 ) , though the latent heat of typical l - t dwarf clouds are not particularly large ( say , compared with water or ammonia , which are important in the solar system gas - giant atmospheres ) .",
    "double diffusive convection resulting from vertical composition gradients can also result in shallower tp - profiles in the mid to deep atmospheres ( tremblin et al .",
    "chromospheric heating can cause a more isothermal behavior in the upper ( @xmath8 ) atmospheres ( sorahana et al .",
    "additional dynamical effects like gravity wave breaking and horizontal dynamics can also cause perturbations to the tp - profile beyond the traditional assumption of 1d - radiative convective equilibrium . determining tp - profiles over a wide range of altitudes / pressures and comparing these derived profiles to radiative - convective equilibrium profiles allows us to diagnose additional atmospheric energetic processes .",
    "figure [ fig : figure4 ] shows the tp - profiles for the 11 t - dwarfs in our sample . as in part i , we summarize the tp - profiles with a median , 68%- , and 95%-confidence intervals .",
    "we also show a nominal ( median retrieved effective temperature and gravity ) pre - computed grid model ( saumon & marley 2008 ) .",
    "thermal emission contribution functions are shown to indicate where in the atmosphere we are sensing  the photosphere , typically between @xmath550 - 0.3 bar .",
    "the y- , and j - band peaks probe the deepest levels , while the high opacity regions between these bands probe the lowest pressure levels ( highest altitudes ) .",
    "the tp - profiles within the photosphere are considered the most robust .",
    "typical 1-sigma photospheric temperature uncertainties are @xmath530 - 100 k. tp - profile information outside of those regions ( @xmath9 bar and @xmath10 bar ) are largely driven by the tp - profile parameterization ( via the smoothing prior described in detail in part i ) and should not be too heavily interpreted .",
    "finally , we show the equilibrium condensation curves for kcl , na@xmath0s , and mgsio@xmath2 .    in general ,",
    "as we found for the two objects explored in part i , the retrieved tp - profiles and predicted radiative - convective equilibrium grid models agree quite well over the photosphere .",
    "deviations begin to occur outside of the photosphere .",
    "in part i we suggested that the shallower tp - profile gradient below the @xmath550 bar level maybe indicative of the double - diffusive convection suggested by tremblin et al .",
    "however , there is very little contribution to the overall emission at these deeper levels due to the increasing opacity of the collision induced molecular hydrogen along with the alkali metal and water opacities at the j- and y - band peaks . above the photosphere ( @xmath10bar )",
    ", we typically find that the tp - profiles become more isothermal than predicted from radiative - convective equilibrium , possibly hinting at some sort of additional heating , but again , temperature constraints are unreliable in this region .    late t - dwarfs ( and y - dwarfs ) offer the best chances of learning bout the tp - profiles of brown dwarfs because of the large spectral dynamic range sculpted by strong water vapor absorption and predominately cloud free atmospheres .",
    "this high spectral dynamic range provides leverage on the tp - profile over a wide range of photospheric pressures .",
    "however , as seen here , it is difficult to push towards deeper pressures due to the increasing significance of collision induced opacities .",
    "higher resolution spectra near the water band - heads ( between the y - j - h bands ) or longer wavelengths with higher opacity could allow us to probe _ lower _ pressures ( higher altitudes ) than probed here , permitting more precise upper atmosphere temperature constraints .",
    "hotter objects , mid t - s and beyond , will present a challenge as their photospheres narrow due to the presence of clouds , preventing us from accessing the deeper atmospheric levels . any temperature profile information below where the cloud opacities become large will have to come from extrapolation via parameterizations or assumed from physically motivated models .",
    "regardless , assumptions will have to be made and these assumptions will have to be tested .",
    "we show , for the first time , the molecular abundances derived for an ensemble of t - dwarfs . molecular abundance determinations are diagnostic of the atmospheric chemical processes as well as the underlying elemental abundances .",
    "we present the retrieved uniform - with - altitude molecular abundances for 7 gases : h@xmath0o , ch@xmath1 , co , co@xmath0 , nh@xmath2 , h@xmath0s , na+k , where na+k represents the combination of sodium and potassium , where their ratio is assumed to be solar .",
    "the first 7 columns of figure [ fig : figure5 ] show the marginalized gas posterior distributions for the 11 objects , sorted in effective temperature ( low - high ) . as in part",
    "i , we find that h@xmath0o , ch@xmath1 , nh@xmath2 , and",
    "the alkalis are the only species with bounded constraints . we can derive only upper limits for the other species ( co , co@xmath0,h@xmath0s ) , consistent with a non - detection of these gases ( e.g. , see the bayes factor analysis in part 1 ) .",
    "this is unsurprising given their low abundances predicted from thermochemical equilibrium ( lodders et al .",
    "2002 ) .      because we are retrieving each gas phase absorber individually , it is possible to obtain chemically implausible combinations ( e.g. , heng & lyons 2016 ; stevenson et al .",
    "it is therefore prudent to check the plausibility of our results against a chemical model . for simplicity",
    ", we compare our results to predictions from a thermochemical model ( chemical equilibrium with applications code 2 , gordon & mcbride 1996 , see part i for implementation details and relevant references ) in figure [ fig : figure5 ] .",
    "briefly , the model computes the thermochemical equilibrium molecular ratios at a given p - t pair and set of elemental abundances ( lodders & fegley 2002 ) . the model accounts for both gas phase and condensed phase species in local thermochemical equilibrium , but does not take into account the rain - out paradigm whereby elemental species are depleted due to their sequestration into condensates that form large droplets and  rain \" out into the deeper unobservable atmosphere ( e.g. , fegley & lodders 1994 ; marley & robinson 2015 ) .",
    "we do accommodate for the influence of main rain out process ( enstatite and forsterite condensation , fegley & lodders 1994 ) on the elemental abundances ( and subsequent equilibrium molecular abundances ) by manually removing 3.28 oxygen atoms per silicon atom ( sharp & burrows 1999 ) .    as in part",
    "i , we compute the equilibrium molecular abundances along the median of the retrieved tp - profiles for each object ( from figure [ fig : figure3 ] ) .",
    "we compare the retrieved molecular abundances for only the well constrained species ( shaded regions in figure [ fig : figure5 ] ) to the equilibrium composition computed with solar elemental ratios ( solid curves in figure [ fig : figure5 ] ) . in general we find that the retrieved mixing ratios qualitatively agree with what is expected from thermochemical equilibrium at these temperatures : ch@xmath1 and h@xmath0o are the most abundant species followed by nh@xmath2 and then the alkalis .",
    "we emphasize that both the retrieved and thermochemically calculated mixing ratios are really only relevant over the photosphere ( @xmath530 - 0.3 bar , figure [ fig : figure3 ] ) . upon more careful inspection",
    "we find some inconsistencies between the thermochemical predictions at solar composition and the retrieved mixing ratios .",
    "we then adjust the metallicity ( [ fe / h ] ) by rescaling all elements heavier than h and he and the carbon - to - oxygen ratio ( c / o ) to by - hand  fit \" the thermochemical model ( dashed curves in figure [ fig : figure5 ] corresponding to the inset values ) to the retrieved mixing ratios , exactly as was done in part i. this is by no means a rigorous fit ( see  [ sec : element_abund ] for a more quantitative analysis ) , but is meant to show that we can obtain consistency between the thermochemical prediction and the retrieved mixing ratios by adjusting these two quantities , suggesting that we have retrieved _ chemically plausible _ molecular abundance combinations .",
    "we do find some preliminary , though not robust , evidence of disequilibrium ammonia chemistry ( as discussed in saumon et al .",
    "2006 ; cushing et al . 2008",
    "; stephens et al .",
    "2009 with respect to mid infrared data ) .",
    "for most objects the thermochemically computed value of ammonia over the photospheric pressures probed by spex is lower than the retrieved values .",
    "however , the thermochemical predictions at the artificial base of the atmosphere are consistent with the retrieved values , suggesting a deep quench level ( @xmath11100 bars ) could be possible in explaining the ammonia mixing ratios .",
    "finally , we find some inconsistencies in between predicted and retrieved alkali abundances . this could be due to the difficulties in properly modeling the far pressure broadened wings of the alkali lines ( allard et al .",
    "2009 ) and/or the details of condensate rainout chemistry ( of which our model does not account for ) , though it need not be that all elemental abundance ratios are solar .    in the next section we will use this thermochemical modeling approach to derive the intrinsic bulk metallicity and carbon - to - oxygen ratios for each object .",
    "an advantage of retrieval methods over grid models is that we can directly determine the molecular abundances rather than assume / compute them , and from trends in those abundances , infer physical / chemical processes . as an initial look",
    ", we focus on molecular abundance trends with effective temperature ( figure [ fig : figure7 ] ) . chemical processes ( e.g. , equilibrium chemistry , condensate processes ) tend to depend strongly on temperature ( e.g , burrows & sharp 1999 , lodders & fegley 2002 ) ; we would therefore expect molecular abundances to change with temperature . specifically , we focus on trends associated with the well constrained species , e ..",
    "g , those with bounded constraints , which include h@xmath0o , ch@xmath1 , nh@xmath2 , and the alkali metals .",
    "the other species ( co , co@xmath0 , and h@xmath0s ) , while chemically interesting , simply do not have the precisions required to identify diagnostic trends .",
    "we would predict water and methane to have little or no trend with temperature over our sample temperature range ( @xmath5 600 - 850 k ) as they are thermochemically constant ( e.g. , burrows & sharp 1999 figure 5 ) and largely unaffected by disequilibrium processes ( saumon et al .",
    "2006 ) at these temperatures .",
    "unsurprisingly , we indeed do not find any statistically robust trends of water and methane with temperature , as both are consistent with the null , no - trend , hypothesis ( figure [ fig : figure7 ] , to panels ) .",
    "ammonia ( figure [ fig : figure7 ] , bottom left ) , on the other hand , is thermochemically predicted to decrease by nearly an order of magnitude over this temperature range over the photospheric pressure levels ( burrows & sharp 1999 ) . given the uncertainties , we should be able to identify such a trend if it existed ; the lack of trend is interesting .",
    "perhaps the lack of trend is speaking to perturbations due to disequilibrium chemistry dredging up ammonia from these deeper layers . depending on the degree of dispersion in the vertical mixing strength amongst these objects (",
    "can depend on internal heat flux , rotation rate , magnetic field strength , flasar and gierasch , 1977 ; visscher et al .",
    "2010 ) , it is not surprising that the thermochemically predicted trend of decreasing abundance with temperature is not so clearly borne out .",
    "a more striking trend is that of the alkali metal abundances with temperature ( figure [ fig : figure7 ] , bottom right ) , with the null hypothesis being rejected at @xmath325@xmath4 .",
    "over the @xmath5 600 - 850 k range , the alkali metal abundance increases by nearly an order of magnitude .",
    "we attribute this trend to the condensation of salt sulfide ( na@xmath0s ) and potassium chloride ( kcl ) clouds ( dominated by the kcl condensation as k dominates the alkali absorption neary y - band by a few to @xmath51 order magnitude over na at solar na / k ratios)20 times more abundant than k , the absorption cross section of k is @xmath5100 greater at shorter wavelength resulting in k dominating the opacity by nearly an order of magnitude ] .",
    "the general hypothesis being , that as these objects cool , the tp - profile - condensate intersection point moves deeper into the atmosphere ( as seen in figure [ fig : figure4 ] where the dashed curves intersect the blue solid blue curve ) .",
    "gas phase sodium and potassium only exist in appreciable quantities _ below _ the tp - profile - condensate intersection point . therefore , as the tp - profile - condensate intersection point moves deeper into the atmosphere , the overall integrated column abundance of gas phase elemental sodium and potassium decreases over the photospheric regions .",
    "this is hypothesis is further confirmed in figure [ fig : figure8 ] . the left panel shows the pressure levels where the na@xmath0s and kcl condensate curves intersect the retrieved tp - profiles for each object ( as can be readily determined from the tp - profiles in figure [ fig : figure4 ] ) , as a function of effective temperature . as expected , as cooler temperatures occur at lower pressures for hotter objects , the condensates are in turn expected to form at these lower pressures ( higher altitudes ) .",
    "we can then map back the retrieved alkali abundance trend with the pressure level of of the tp- profile - condensate intersection .",
    "indeed we do find a trend , thus confirming our argument that hotter objects have a greater column of gas phase alkalis , of which our ensemble analysis is sensitive to .",
    "there have long been two ` schools ' of how condensate chemistry should be treated in brown dwarf atmospheric models . in the pure equilibrium school condensates",
    "are considered to continue to be in chemical equilibrium with their surrounding gas , even after condensation ( for example burrows & sharp 1999 ) . in the second school , commonly followed in solar system chemistry ( fegley & lodders 1994 ) condensed species `",
    "rain out ' of the atmosphere and are no longer are available to react with surrounding gas at lower temperatures . in the pure equilibrium school for example gaseous na and k",
    "react with previously condensed aluminum and silicate compounds to form feldspar minerals such as sanadine and albite ( see burrows et al .",
    "2001 for a discussion ) .",
    "meanwhile in the rain out conception the aluminum oxides and silicates rain out of the atmosphere after they condense and the feldspars do not form .",
    "instead the gaseous na and k form chloride salts at much lower temperatures ( lodders 1999 ) . a number of lines of evidence ( marley et al .",
    "2002 , morley et al .",
    "2012 ) , have pointed towards rainout chemistry as being the most applicable to brown dwarf atmospheres , but conclusive evidence of na and k depletion in the atmosphere over the expected temperature range has been somewhat lacking . given our observed trend , and its correlation with the condensate base pressure , we have provided definitive evidence that this rain out paradigm is indeed correct .              as demonstrated in ",
    "[ sec : element_abund ] and  [ sec : trends ] , condensates are likely responsible for the depletion of oxygen and the alkali metal trend .",
    "we might anticipate the resulting clouds to impact the spectrum .",
    "as such , we have included the impact of a gray non - scattering cloud in our retrieval scheme ( equation [ eq : cloud_eq ] ) . to investigate the importance of clouds , from the three retrieved cloud parameters in equation [ eq : cloud_eq ]",
    "we can compute the column integrated optical depth histograms over the photospheres for each object , shown in the last column ( @xmath12 ) of figure [ fig : figure3 ] .",
    "the cloud optical depth histograms for each object all show a dramatic decline in probability near optical depths of unity ( vertical dotted lines ) .",
    "this suggests that for these objects , larger cloud optical are rejected by the data indicating that optically thick clouds are not present .",
    "this is consistent with our findings in part i where we applied bayesian hypothesis testing to show that the inclusion of clouds for gl570d and hd3651b was not justified given the data nor did their inclusion impact the retrieved values for any of the other parameters .",
    "we note , that for some objects there is a small trickle of probability towards higher optical depths , though not significant relative to the total integrated probability .",
    "the lack of large cloud optical depth is in reasonable agreement with expectations for late t - dwarfs from forward modeling investigations ( lodders 1999 ; lodders & fegley 2002 ; visscher et al .",
    "2006;2010 ; morley et al .",
    "2012 ) . based upon the intersection of the enstatite condensation curve with the tp - profiles ( figure [ fig : figure4 ] ) ,",
    "we find that the silicate clouds largely reside below the photosphere , e.g. , the gaseous opacities become optically thick at pressure levels above where the enstatite cloud should form and thus should have no impact on the emergent spectrum .",
    "this is consistent with the findings of morley et al .",
    "( 2012 ) , where forward models of objects covering a similar temperature range suggest that the silicate clouds are are largely below the photosphere except for the objects approaching @xmath5900k .",
    "figure [ fig : figure4 ] and the alkali metal trend suggests that na@xmath0s and kcl clouds should form within the photosphere .",
    "morley et al . ( 2012 ) showed that the largely neglected cloud species na@xmath0s , kcl , mns , and zns can form within cool dwarf atmospheres .",
    "they showed that , depending on gravity and the degree of droplet sedimentation ( higher gravity and more vertically extended clouds result in higher cloud optical depths ) , the optical depths of na@xmath0s ( more so than kcl ) can range from negligible to a few within the 1 - 6@xmath13 m photospheres of late t - dwarfs ( their figure 4 and 8) .",
    "our photospheric optical depth upper limits suggest that the cloud optical depths can not be significantly greater than unity ) , which would allow for higher optical depths by a factor of @xmath5(1-@xmath14 ) ] .",
    "this may potentially place constraints on the vertical extent of the clouds , largely favoring more vertically compact clouds ( higher degree of sedimentation within their modeling framework ) .",

    "<S> brown dwarf spectra are rich in information revealing of the chemical and physical processes operating in their atmospheres . </S>",
    "<S> we apply a recently developed atmospheric retrieval tool to an ensemble of late t - dwarf ( 600 - 800k ) near infrared spectra . with these spectra </S>",
    "<S> we are able to place direct constraints the molecular abundances of h@xmath0o , ch@xmath1 , co , co@xmath0 , nh@xmath2 , h@xmath0s , and na+k , gravity , thermal structure ( and effective temperature ) , photometric radius , and cloud optical depths . </S>",
    "<S> we find that ammonia , water , methane , and the alkali metals are present and well constrained in all 11 objects . from the abundance constraints we find no significant trend in the water , methane , or ammonia abundances with temperature , but find a very strong ( @xmath325@xmath4 ) increasing trend in the alkali metal abundances with effective temperature , indicative of alkali rainout . </S>",
    "<S> we also find little evidence for optically thick clouds . with the methane and water abundances , </S>",
    "<S> we derive the intrinsic atmospheric metallicity and carbon - to - oxygen ratios . </S>",
    "<S> we find in our sample , that metallicities are typically sub solar and carbon - to - oxygen ratios are somewhat super solar , different than expectations from the local stellar population . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that the retrieved vertical thermal profiles are consistent with radiative equilibrium over the photospheric regions . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we find that our retrieved effective temperatures are lower than previous inferences for some objects and that our radii are larger than expectations from evolutionary models , possibly indicative of un - resolved binaries . </S>",
    "<S> this investigation and methodology represents a paradigm in linking spectra to the determination of the fundamental chemical and physical processes governing cool brown dwarf atmospheres . </S>"
